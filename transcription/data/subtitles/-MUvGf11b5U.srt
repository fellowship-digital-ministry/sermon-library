1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
and I'll be looking at verses 12 down through verse number 30.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
If you've noticed in the bulletin, I've titled the message this evening,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Joseph in the Pit.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And of course, if we're familiar with the account of Joseph,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
as many of us would be, we understand it's in the passage here

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
that he ends up in a pit before being sold into slavery.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I trust that as we look at the passage of Scripture

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and seek to make application in our own lives that God will help us

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
to draw closer to him.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
In our previous message from the book of Genesis,

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
we learned of Joseph's two dreams and how he then shared

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
those dreams with his family.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We read of the response, in particular, the response of the brothers,

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and we'd say that it was less than desirable when the brothers,

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
according to Genesis 37, in verse number 8, it says that

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
they hated him yet the more for his dreams and for his words.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Now remember, before he ever shared his dreams with his brothers,

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
the Bible said that they hated him and could not speak peaceably unto him.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And after hearing the dreams and what he said,

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
they understood what was being revealed.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
They hated him yet the more.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
We find that as we look at the passage before us this evening,

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
it begins in verse number 12, when the Bible simply says this,

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
and his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Now, the time that would pass between Joseph revealing the dreams

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
to his brothers and the response and what have you,

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
and the brothers departing to go to Shechem is unknown.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
We don't know how much time takes place between verse 11 and 12.

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It does not seem that there'd be a great amount of time that takes place,

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
but there's some time that takes place, and we find that they depart

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
in order to go feed their father's flock there in Shechem.

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
We're not sure as to the exact reason, but it seems clear

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
as you look at the text of Scripture.

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's obvious that Joseph did not travel with his brethren for this particular task.

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
No, Joseph remained in Hebron with his father.

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It's kind of interesting as you begin to think about Joseph staying there

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
with his father.

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
He's sent out, of course, and we understand that according to verse number 14.

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
But I want you to think about the name of the city, Hebron,

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
depending on how you want to say it.

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
That word means association.

42
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
And it really carries with it the idea of fellowship.

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And I want you to think just for a moment as Joseph,

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
and we understand his position within the family.

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
We've already read of the dysfunction, and we've talked about those things,

46
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
and we've understood that Joseph is the favored son, the favorite.

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
He's been given this coat of many colors and all of these things,

48
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
but we find that he's there, and he stays in Hebron,

49
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
and he's there, and he's having this fellowship with his father.

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And you think about the boys that have left, and you see what's going on,

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
and no doubt with all that would take place in the home life of Joseph,

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
it was probably a pretty peaceful situation.

53
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
The brothers that hated him, the brothers that could not speak peaceably unto him,

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
they were gone, and they were taking care of the flock.

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And he's there, and his father's there, and there's a fellowship that's taking place.

56
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And we find that according to our text of Scripture,

57
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
that Israel's dad comes and speaks to Joseph.

58
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Notice the Bible tells us in verse number 13,

59
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And Israel said unto Joseph,

60
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Do not by brethren feed the flock in Shechem.

61
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Come, and I will send thee unto them.

62
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
And he said to him, Here am I.

63
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
And he, that's Jacob, said to him, Joseph,

64
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy brethren,

65
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
and well with the flocks, and bring me word again.

66
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron,

67
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
and he came to Shechem.

68
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Verse 15 says, A certain man found him,

69
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
and, behold, he, Joseph, he was wandering in the field.

70
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
The man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?

71
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
He said, I seek my brethren.

72
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Tell me, I pray thee, where they feed their flocks.

73
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
The man said, They are departed hence,

74
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan.

75
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
And Joseph went after his brethren,

76
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
and found them in Dothan.

77
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
So we look at the passage of Scripture this evening,

78
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
and we'll go down through verse number 30.

79
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
In fact, we'll even make mention of verse 36.

80
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
But I want you to notice this evening,

81
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
if you are taking notes, number one, the concern of Jacob.

82
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
We find that in verses 12 through 17,

83
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
we read of Joseph's departure,

84
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
but we find that the real reason

85
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
that Joseph is sent on this task

86
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
is because of the concern that Jacob has.

87
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Now, the source of the concern,

88
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
the reason that Jacob has this concern,

89
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
is certainly open to our understanding,

90
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
debating, if you will.

91
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I believe that there's at least two very prominent reasons

92
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
that could lead to Jacob being concerned.

93
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
One could be that their expected return date had been missed.

94
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And they were gone longer

95
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
than they were expected to be away for,

96
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
and that could be reason for Jacob to be concerned.

97
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
They do not have technology in this time like we have today.

98
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Some of us today were able to just send a quick note

99
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
and find out, hey, what's going on, and we get a delay.

100
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You know, hey, I got caught up with this, that, or the other,

101
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
and it's going to be a little bit of time.

102
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
But do you remember back in the day, like, you know,

103
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
20 years ago when you didn't have that technology,

104
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
and people would be standing at the door

105
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
waiting for a loved one that was traveling

106
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
and just anxiously waiting for their arrival?

107
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I remember as a child when we would travel

108
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
from North Carolina up to New Jersey

109
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
to visit with my grandparents,

110
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
and I remember my grandparents waiting anxiously

111
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
and patiently, my grandfather at least,

112
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
by anxiously awaiting the arrival of our family.

113
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And some of you can relate to that and you can understand.

114
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And so Jacob has a measure of concern.

115
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Maybe it's because the boys have not returned

116
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
at the appointed time.

117
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I believe that another reason that would lead Jacob

118
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
to being concerned, thus sending Joseph,

119
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
is because he understood,

120
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
he was aware of the behavior of his boys.

121
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And certainly these boys could get themselves in trouble.

122
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
And he was aware of their behavior,

123
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
he was aware of how they acted and what they did,

124
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
and perhaps it was a situation where Jacob was concerned

125
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
about the boys because,

126
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I'm not sure what their behavior may have led to,

127
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
what kind of trouble they might be in.

128
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
And so we find that Jacob,

129
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
and whether you have other ideas

130
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
as to why it is that he's concerned,

131
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
but we know that the Bible says that he calls Joseph to him

132
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
and he says in verse 13,

133
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
come and I will send thee unto them.

134
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And he said to him, here am I.

135
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And so when I think about the concern of Jacob,

136
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
we see in the text of scripture

137
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
that this concern on the part of Jacob

138
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
leads to a mission for Joseph.

139
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
This concern of Jacob leads to a mission for Joseph.

140
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
And I want you to notice,

141
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
as we see the response of Joseph,

142
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
the Bible says at the end of verse number 13,

143
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
that he simply responds by saying, here am I.

144
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Here am I.

145
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Now we notice that Joseph understands

146
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
what Jacob is going to send him to do.

147
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
The very boys that cannot speak peaceably unto him,

148
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
the brothers that hate him,

149
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Joseph is being given this assignment from his father

150
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
to go and to check on them.

151
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
The Bible tells us, again, remember he was in Hebron.

152
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
He's there having fellowship with his father.

153
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
The brothers are not there.

154
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
There's a measure of peace and maybe safety, if you will.

155
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And he says, here am I.

156
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
And here's what Jacob says to him in verse 14.

157
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy brethren

158
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
and well with the flocks and bring me word again.

159
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron

160
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
and he came to Shechem.

161
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
And I want you to think about this passage of Scripture

162
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
from the perspective we see the concern,

163
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
but as we know the mission that's been assigned to Joseph

164
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
and we know that his response is one that is immediate.

165
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
He immediately responds in obedience to the command,

166
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
to the mission that's been given to him.

167
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
This particular response is not only immediate,

168
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
but it's complete.

169
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I want you to notice that in verse number 15,

170
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
the Bible says that a certain man found him

171
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
and behold, he was wandering in the field.

172
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
And so what happens?

173
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Well, he goes, he's leaving as he was assigned to do so.

174
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
He's told to go to Shechem.

175
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Now Shechem is about a 60-mile journey from where he is.

176
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Now again, I mentioned this morning about the journey of Elijah

177
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
being a hundred miles or so from Cherith over to Zarephath.

178
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And you think about a 60-mile journey,

179
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
again, much more complicated than a 60-mile journey

180
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
for us today.

181
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
We think about the 60-mile journey that he'd go on

182
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
and you think about some of the dangers

183
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
and so on and so forth.

184
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
In fact, even as you would think about the story

185
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
that the brothers give to dad

186
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
about the supposed demise of Joseph

187
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
and it's being believable,

188
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
the fact of the matter is that this was potentially

189
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
some dangerous territory to travel.

190
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
We find that the Bible says that he's wandering in the field.

191
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
So what's he doing?

192
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
He doesn't find them.

193
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
They're not there.

194
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
They're not in Shechem,

195
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
the place where Jacob thought they would be.

196
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
He didn't just turn around and go home.

197
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
This wasn't a half-hearted effort.

198
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
This wasn't a matter of obedience of checking the box,

199
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
like, okay, well, I went and I just couldn't find them.

200
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Right?

201
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You ever tell your kids to clean the room?

202
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
They come back and they say,

203
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
clean the room!

204
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Like, there's no way you cleaned your room that fast.

205
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It's just not possible.

206
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Right?

207
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You understand what I'm saying?

208
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
And then what happens?

209
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You go in there and you,

210
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
don't open the closet!

211
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,239
closet, right? Don't look under the bed. Why? Because it's not a full job. See, I see in

212
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:14,039
Joseph here that even though the task that was assigned would be a task that personally,

213
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:17,920
and I think if you'd be honest this evening, that you wouldn't want to do this. Why would

214
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:23,159
you want to go find the boys, your brothers, that hate you, that want to kill you, that

215
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:32,680
can't speak peaceably unto you. But Joseph goes. He's obedient. He finds as he's wandering

216
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,959
there that there's some man that asks him saying, what seekest thou? He said, I seek

217
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:41,119
my brethren. Tell me, I pray thee, where they feed the flock. And the Bible tells us that

218
00:10:41,119 --> 00:10:45,880
the man replied and said that they've departed from hence. And I heard them say, let us go

219
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:50,759
to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren and found them in Dothan. That's an additional

220
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:58,479
twelve mile journey. Seventy-two miles. It's a long journey. And Joseph takes this journey

221
00:10:58,479 --> 00:11:06,360
and he responds to the mission that was assigned again. The concern of Jacob led to a mission

222
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:11,919
for Joseph. And we understand the physical nature of the relationship between Joseph

223
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:17,599
and Jacob and his brothers. And we understand what's taking place here contextually, historically.

224
00:11:17,599 --> 00:11:22,120
And I want you to think this evening, if we could make spiritual application here,

225
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:28,220
I wonder how it is that we respond to our Father when He gives us a mission. When God

226
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:36,199
gives us a task to do, when God gives us a mission, how do we respond? Do we respond

227
00:11:36,199 --> 00:11:43,400
in obedience? Do we respond immediately? Do we, do we do it wholeheartedly? Do we do it

228
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:51,839
to the, to the manner in which we ought to do it as far as all in, a hundred percent?

229
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:57,319
Do you understand what I'm saying? Not just a, oh yeah, I did that, and it'd just be a

230
00:11:57,319 --> 00:12:04,839
half-hearted type of effort. We find in the text of Scripture that, yes, this is an account

231
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:09,059
that's provided to us that's in a historical account, but we find that there's, the Bible's

232
00:12:09,059 --> 00:12:13,919
been given to us and we obviously can take application. And I think about the response

233
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:19,300
of Joseph here in verse 13 when he says, here am I. Hold your place here in terms of Isaiah,

234
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:23,179
and I know that you're familiar with Isaiah, but I want you to read it with me in Isaiah

235
00:12:23,179 --> 00:12:28,820
chapter number six this evening. And I want you to consider that this account that is

236
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:33,699
given to us in the book of Isaiah, of the call of Isaiah, the commission of Isaiah.

237
00:12:33,699 --> 00:12:39,820
Now remember, Joseph says, here am I. And we find that as we come to the book of Isaiah

238
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:46,460
in the sixth chapter, that it's the year that King Uzziah died, and Isaiah says that he

239
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:52,860
saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.

240
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:57,699
What a sight Isaiah six provides us with into the throne room of heaven. We find that he

241
00:12:57,699 --> 00:13:04,820
hears the angel singing, holy, holy, holy, and we notice all that's taking place, and

242
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:09,139
then after the interaction, we're not taking the entire time to look at all these verses,

243
00:13:09,139 --> 00:13:13,699
but I want you to notice that Isaiah hears the voice of the Lord in verse number eight,

244
00:13:13,699 --> 00:13:17,740
and the voice of the Lord he hears saying, whom shall I send and who will go for us?

245
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:27,220
Then said I, what does it say? Here am I. Here am I, send me. We don't see in Genesis

246
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:36,139
37 that Joseph says, here am I, send me, but I think it could be easily understood

247
00:13:36,139 --> 00:13:43,580
that that's what he was saying. Why? Well because Jacob says, come and I will send thee

248
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:51,419
unto them. And Joseph says, here am I. You know that reveals to me a complete submission

249
00:13:51,419 --> 00:13:58,220
to his father. It's a complete submission to his father. Now I understand historical

250
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:02,259
context. I understand what's taking place, and we could talk about relationships and

251
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:07,380
what have you, but I want to make the spiritual application this evening, and I wonder this

252
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:13,539
evening do we have that complete submission to our heavenly father? That when our heavenly

253
00:14:13,539 --> 00:14:23,420
father gives us a task, a mission, that it is met with immediate obedience, here am I.

254
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:32,739
I'll go. I'll do. I'll say. I'll be. Here am I. Complete submission. Complete surrender.

255
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:38,339
That's a good place to be in our lives. So often in our lives if we're not careful, we're

256
00:14:38,859 --> 00:14:45,619
going to hold certain parts back for us. And we think that we can manage this part or manage

257
00:14:45,619 --> 00:14:51,779
that part and we can, no, no, no. We learn in life it's so much better if we just let

258
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:59,019
God have His way. We live in that condition of absolute surrender. And here in our text

259
00:14:59,019 --> 00:15:06,660
of Scripture, I do not want us to miss it this evening that Joseph was completely submitted

260
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:12,459
and surrendered to his father. And by way of spiritual application this evening, I hope

261
00:15:12,459 --> 00:15:18,260
that each and every one of us could say, it's a personal evaluation that we need to make.

262
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:26,700
Am I completely surrendered and submitted to the will of my father? If I say that I

263
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:33,339
am, I don't know where he's going to send me. It's okay, because he'll be with you and

264
00:15:33,339 --> 00:15:40,739
he'll use you. And it will be worth it. Back to the historical account, as we continue

265
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:45,660
in our text of Scripture, we begin looking through, beginning in verse number 18 there,

266
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:48,820
we see number two, if you're taking notes, not only the concern of Jacob, but number

267
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:53,299
two, we see the conspiracy of the brothers, the conspiracy of the brothers. Notice the

268
00:15:53,299 --> 00:16:01,420
Bible says, it begins in verse number 18, and when they saw him afar off, even before

269
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:10,980
he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him. Wow. They saw him from afar.

270
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:16,339
How do you think they saw him from afar? I think that coat of many colors had a big part.

271
00:16:16,339 --> 00:16:22,420
And then being able to easily identify who it was that was making their way toward him,

272
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:27,559
them. We find that it was obvious that there's Joseph, he's coming over here. And I want

273
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,799
you to notice as you look at the text of Scripture, I want you to, in your sanctified imagination,

274
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:38,000
as you look at the passage and try to hear the tone, if you will, of the brothers, the

275
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,679
Bible says that even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him.

276
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:48,959
And notice what they say in verse number 19, they said one to another, behold, this dreamer

277
00:16:49,359 --> 00:16:56,160
cometh. Think they're still upset about the dreams? Sure they are. Fresh on their mind.

278
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:04,399
And the Bible says, come now therefore, and let us slay him and cast him into some pit,

279
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:11,480
and we will say, some evil beast hath devoured him, and we shall see what will become of his

280
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:21,079
dreams. I mean, can you hear the tone of the voice of the brothers? Evil. We've heard these

281
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:25,079
dreams, behold, this dreamer cometh. Let's see what's going to become of his dreams.

282
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:34,600
Here's what we're going to do. We've got this plan. We see their evil hearts. The conspiracy

283
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:40,359
to kill him and to throw him into a pit. They even went through such lengths of developing

284
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:46,760
a plan to cover their actions, where they say in verse number 20 that we will say, some

285
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:50,959
evil beast hath devoured him, and we shall see what will become of his dreams. We find

286
00:17:50,959 --> 00:17:55,880
that that's exactly what happens. They give that story to Jacob at the end of the text

287
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:00,959
of Scripture. We'll look at that next Sunday evening. But we find that this plan, as they

288
00:18:00,959 --> 00:18:07,160
develop this plan, they develop a cover story. How are we going to cover this up? What are

289
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:14,839
we going to say? Reuben steps in. He hears of what's taking place, and he offers an alternative.

290
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:18,920
We find that the alternative is given in verse 21. It says, And Reuben heard it, and he delivered

291
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:25,279
him out of their hands, and said, Let us not kill him. And Reuben said unto them, Shed

292
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:30,200
no blood, but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon

293
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:35,679
him, that ye might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again. So he

294
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:42,359
didn't really stand up to his brothers like he should have. He offers an alternative plan,

295
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:47,400
and we find that he's going to then try to come behind the scenes, if you will, and deliver

296
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:52,760
Joseph back to his father. And it says then in verse 23, And it came to pass, when Joseph

297
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:58,000
was coming to his brethren, he's not even to them yet. All of this is happening. I mean,

298
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,200
he's just approaching them. By the way, why did Jacob want him to go find out? He wanted

299
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:10,200
to bring him word again. I think Jacob wanted his sons to come back to Hebron. They had

300
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,719
departed. They had left the place of association or fellowship, and he wanted the brothers

301
00:19:14,719 --> 00:19:20,960
to come back, and he sends Joseph to go. And before Joseph even enters into their presence,

302
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:28,520
they have this plan devised on how they're going to get rid of Joseph. The Bible says

303
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:34,219
in verse 23 that they stripped Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colors that

304
00:19:34,219 --> 00:19:40,200
was on him. They took him and cast him into a pit. The pit was empty. There was no water

305
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:45,380
in it. I want you to think about verse 23 and 24. Can you imagine Joseph coming? He's

306
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:53,520
just being obedient. It was not the idea, the thought of Joseph, of, hey, dad, the brothers,

307
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,979
they haven't been back for a little while, and should I go and check on them? No. This

308
00:19:56,979 --> 00:20:00,020
was the plan of his father. His father sent him...

309
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:02,660
on this mission and he goes and he's there

310
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,500
and as soon as he arrives, can you imagine

311
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,540
as he's met by these boys that grab him

312
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,220
and they tear this coat off of him

313
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,860
and they throw him into a pit.

314
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,340
Man, it's terrible.

315
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,100
The place where he finds his brothers is called Dothan.

316
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:22,160
It's believed that this particular city

317
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,960
was known as having two wells

318
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,920
and perhaps it's one of those wells

319
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,560
that became this pit where it's dry

320
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,240
because wells sometimes dry up.

321
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,600
We find that the Bible specifically tells us,

322
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,000
I want you to notice verse 24 and 25

323
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,360
where they took him and they cast him into a pit.

324
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,560
The pit was empty, there was no water in it.

325
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,960
And then the very next statement says,

326
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,460
and they sat down to eat bread.

327
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,500
Does that just baffle your mind?

328
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:59,500
They sat down to eat bread, their brother.

329
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:08,800
Came on a mission in obedience to dad.

330
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:13,700
They strip him of his clothes and they cast him in a pit.

331
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,000
As they cast him in a pit,

332
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,880
they simply sit down to eat bread.

333
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,720
Talk about cold hearted, cruel.

334
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,700
What depravity.

335
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,300
The Bible says they sat down to eat

336
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,520
according to verse number 25.

337
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,700
And there's a final twist that is given to us

338
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,720
with regard to the conspiracy.

339
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:42,140
For they lift up their eyes and they looked

340
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:44,200
and behold a company of the Ishmaelites

341
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,220
came from Gilead with their camels

342
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:49,140
bearing spicery and balm and myrrh

343
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,140
going to carry it down to Egypt.

344
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:56,540
Judah is the second brother that's named specifically.

345
00:21:56,540 --> 00:22:00,140
Reuben in verse 21, now Judah in verse 26.

346
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:02,260
Notice what he says to his brothers.

347
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:04,940
What profit is it if we slay our brother

348
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,500
and conceal his blood?

349
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,460
Come and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites

350
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,780
and let not our hand be upon him

351
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:14,780
for he is our brother in our flesh.

352
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,380
And his brethren were content.

353
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,740
Why kill him when we can sell him?

354
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:24,980
Because if we kill him, we don't really get anything.

355
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:28,300
But if we sell him, then we can make something.

356
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,740
This is terrible.

357
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,860
Joseph was then sold, the Bible tells us in verse 28.

358
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:39,140
Then there passed by Midianites, merchant men

359
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,700
and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit

360
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:45,700
and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for 20 pieces of silver.

361
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:51,100
And they, the Ishmaelites, brought Joseph there to Egypt.

362
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,460
I want you to see what's happening

363
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,300
as you look at this text of scripture.

364
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:58,580
And think about the price that was put on Joseph's head.

365
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,020
20 pieces of silver.

366
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,620
How many brothers?

367
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,460
10.

368
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,180
Yeah, two pieces of silver each.

369
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,540
Two pieces of silver each.

370
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:10,300
And you know what else they got?

371
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:13,900
A guilty conscience for years.

372
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,380
Hold your place here in Genesis 37

373
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:17,720
and just turn over a few pages of Genesis 42.

374
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,520
And I want you to see what they lived with for years.

375
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,920
In Genesis chapter 42,

376
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,360
we'll get to this text of scripture in,

377
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,720
I don't know, a few months, hopefully not.

378
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,040
It'd be sooner than that.

379
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:39,480
But in Genesis chapter 42, it's the record

380
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,700
of the brothers first coming to Egypt because of the famine.

381
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:48,620
We find that they encounter some difficulties

382
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:49,460
and what have you.

383
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,420
It would seem as you look at the text of scripture,

384
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:55,300
there's about 20 years that had passed

385
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,660
from when he was sold, Joseph, into slavery

386
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,060
and when his brothers come.

387
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:03,860
The Bible tells us in verse 21

388
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:06,460
that after they encountered some of this difficulty,

389
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:08,260
and we won't get into all of what they dealt with.

390
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,420
We'll get to it as we get to this particular chapter.

391
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:12,180
But I want to draw your attention

392
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,660
to what the Bible says in verse 21.

393
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,980
And they said one to another,

394
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:19,020
we are verily guilty concerning our brother

395
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:23,020
in that we saw the anguish of his soul

396
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:26,940
when he besought us and we would not hear.

397
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:31,900
Therefore, is this distress come upon us?

398
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:35,700
Seems like it's about 20 years as you do the calculations

399
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:40,700
and follow the timeline here in the book of Genesis.

400
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,940
That two pieces of silver was long gone.

401
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:47,540
That two pieces of silver was long gone.

402
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,020
They had a guilty conscience.

403
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:53,300
The hardships came and immediately,

404
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,980
you know what their immediate response was?

405
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,960
We're guilty concerning our brother.

406
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,740
We're guilty concerning our brother.

407
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:05,340
And we find here that as we look at this text of scripture

408
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:07,500
and we see what's taking place,

409
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,660
the Bible tells us that they say

410
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:12,340
that we saw the anguish of his soul

411
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:14,580
and he besought us and we would not hear.

412
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,980
Again, the text in Genesis 37 says

413
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:20,060
they threw him into a pit and they sat down to eat.

414
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,980
But here years later,

415
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,540
it's as if they could hear his voice

416
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:34,940
when he was calling out, seeing his face.

417
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:39,740
We come back to Genesis 37.

418
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,580
We see the concern, the conspiracy.

419
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:47,300
I want you to see the confusion of Joseph, number three.

420
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,580
The confusion of Joseph.

421
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,060
The Bible tells us in verse 28

422
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:55,140
that he sold for 20 pieces of silver.

423
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:57,580
Reuben then returns according to verse number 29

424
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:00,180
and the Bible says that he returned to the pit

425
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,780
and behold, Joseph was not in the pit

426
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,900
and he rent his clothes and returned unto his brethren

427
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,740
and said, the child is not nigh, whither shall I go?

428
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,980
I don't know, the Bible doesn't tell us

429
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:11,260
where Reuben went during this transaction

430
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:15,740
that took place when they sold Joseph into slavery.

431
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,860
But the Bible tells us that Midianites sold him

432
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:20,740
into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's

433
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:24,460
in verse number 36 and captain of the guard.

434
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:28,420
Joseph is now on his way to Egypt as a slave.

435
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:33,400
We find that as the mission began,

436
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,360
as the instruction was given from Jacob,

437
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,840
notice it says in verse number 14,

438
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,400
he said to him, go, I pray thee,

439
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,840
see whether it be well with thy brethren and with thy flock

440
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,120
and notice where he says, and bring me word again.

441
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,320
You know, I think Jacob had the expectation

442
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,780
that Joseph was gonna return.

443
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,720
I think Joseph had the expectation that he's gonna return.

444
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:01,280
But now here is Joseph after being sold into slavery,

445
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,640
after all that he's experienced, being in the pit

446
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,240
and then taken out, the brother saying,

447
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,440
hey, listen, he's our brother.

448
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:09,440
Can you imagine hearing your brother say?

449
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,560
He's our brother.

450
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,300
Well, I mean, what good does it do if we kill him?

451
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,760
Let's just go ahead and sell him into slavery.

452
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,220
I think there's gotta be confusion.

453
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:24,120
The part of Joseph is he's traveling now

454
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:29,120
this long, dreary road to Egypt as a slave.

455
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:34,980
I wonder this evening what questions might flood your mind

456
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,120
given the circumstances of Genesis 37.

457
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,840
What kind of questions will we ask?

458
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,400
Would we ask, why is this happening?

459
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,320
Probably some of us would.

460
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,440
If we'd be honest tonight,

461
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,400
some of us would probably say, why is this happening?

462
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,360
Maybe some of us would ask this question,

463
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,360
what's gonna happen when I get to Egypt?

464
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,880
I didn't know anybody in Egypt.

465
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,840
Different land, different people, different culture.

466
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,640
Who's gonna purchase me?

467
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,480
What's gonna happen?

468
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,680
Can you imagine?

469
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:15,680
I mean, I begin to think about the process of Joseph

470
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:20,480
and the confusion and we find that Genesis 42 and verse 21

471
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,280
tells us that Joseph besought his brothers.

472
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:27,120
Now, I'm not sure as you look at Genesis 42 and 21,

473
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,720
we mentioned it just a moment ago,

474
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,920
but when the Bible says that they were guilty

475
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:34,840
concerning our brother in that we saw the anguish of his soul

476
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:39,000
when he besought us and we would not hear.

477
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,200
Therefore, this distress come upon us.

478
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,380
Now, could it be that Joseph besought his brothers

479
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,480
while he was being thrown into the pit?

480
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,320
Sure.

481
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:51,960
Could it be that during the negotiations

482
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,679
with the Ishmaelites as he's gonna be sold into slavery

483
00:28:54,679 --> 00:28:57,679
that he's pleading with his brothers?

484
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:00,040
Why are you doing this?

485
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,720
Don't sell me to these people.

486
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,300
Could you imagine?

487
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:06,119
The Bible says that they saw the anguish of his soul

488
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:11,119
and when he besought us and we find that Joseph is here

489
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,980
and while he's in the pit

490
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:16,239
and while they're negotiating with the Ishmaelites,

491
00:29:16,239 --> 00:29:21,119
I think that he's confused about these events.

492
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:22,280
What's going on?

493
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,380
What's gonna happen?

494
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:27,739
We find as we read already in verse 36 of Genesis 37

495
00:29:27,739 --> 00:29:30,100
that Joseph arrives in Egypt

496
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:34,500
and the Bible tells us that he's purchased by Potiphar.

497
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:38,420
Now, for us this evening, most of us tonight,

498
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:41,420
if I were to put most of us on the spot

499
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:42,700
and have you come stand up here and say

500
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,940
what happens next in the life of Joseph,

501
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:49,820
give me just a five-step overview,

502
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:53,520
you would quickly get to the palace part of Joseph.

503
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,660
Joseph doesn't know that at this point.

504
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:02,980
know at this point what the future holds, what's going to happen.

505
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:09,360
As we begin to think about Joseph, and we notice what's happening, and we see the events

506
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:18,280
as they unfold, the book of Psalms in the 90th chapter gives us this truth concerning

507
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:25,820
our lives, and I want you to turn there quickly, Psalm 90, I want you to look at what the Bible

508
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:34,100
says in verse number 9, look at just a couple of verses here.

509
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:39,880
The Bible tells us in Psalm 90 in verse number 9, for all our days are passed away in thy

510
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,880
wrath.

511
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:48,000
Notice what it says, we spend our years as a tale that is told.

512
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,040
The Bible says in verse number 10, the days of our years are threescore years and ten,

513
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:56,400
for by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength, labor, and sorrow

514
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,600
for to soon cut off and we fly away.

515
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:03,680
So verse 12 says teach us to number our days that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.

516
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:09,120
I want you to notice the end of verse number 9 where the Bible says that we spend our years

517
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,880
as a tale that is told.

518
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:17,960
For us this evening we have the privilege of reading the story of Joseph, the account

519
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,840
that God has given us.

520
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:25,960
The tale, if you look at this verse of Psalm 99, we spend our years as a tale that is told.

521
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:33,480
We're reading Joseph's story, the account of his life.

522
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:37,440
And I want you to understand that at this particular time in Joseph's life that there

523
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:43,000
are some events that have taken place that could certainly lead to confusion.

524
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:50,200
No doubt there are times in your lives, in my life, in your life, when things seem to

525
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,600
take what we might call an unexpected turn.

526
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,600
They're happen.

527
00:31:54,600 --> 00:32:01,080
You say, I didn't see this coming, I didn't know that was going to happen, I didn't think

528
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:06,920
these people were going to treat me this way, or I didn't, an unexpected turn.

529
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:11,400
And the question that we must ask ourselves and when that happens in our life, and we'll

530
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:17,360
note this as we continue to study the life of Joseph, is that when that moment comes

531
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:24,040
and maybe you're in that kind of a moment this evening, when that unexpected rises and

532
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:31,880
comes in your life, we must learn to rest and to trust in our Heavenly Father, knowing

533
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,360
that He's a plan for our life.

534
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:40,280
We may not know what the plan is, in fact we may not be able to see beyond right here

535
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:44,600
to even think about there's a plan.

536
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:50,560
It's amazing to me when you look at the entire account of the book of Genesis of the life,

537
00:32:50,560 --> 00:33:01,080
the days of Joseph, that when he reveals his identity to his brothers, he says, God sent

538
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:06,840
me before you to preserve life.

539
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:12,280
He says it again in Genesis 50 after Jacob dies because the brothers think, okay, Joseph's

540
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:15,800
been nice to us because dad was alive and so on and so forth and now we're really going

541
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,600
to get what we deserve.

542
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:23,180
And Joseph says, no, no, no, in Genesis chapter 50 it's such a powerful truth that we see

543
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:27,840
in the text of Scripture where he says to his brothers in verse number 19, and Joseph

544
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:36,240
said to them, fear not, for am I in the place of God, but as for you, you thought evil against

545
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:42,920
me, but God meant it unto good to bring to pass as it is this day to save much people

546
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:48,280
alive.

547
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:55,280
That perspective of Joseph is precious and it's one that we need to have.

548
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:59,960
You say, well, you don't know what that person did to me.

549
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:04,520
Did you just read what I read in Genesis 37?

550
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:11,440
If anyone honestly could get a pass, I think Joseph would be near the top of the list.

551
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,520
Do you understand what I mean by saying that?

552
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:19,560
Like if somebody could get a pass for, Joseph, you know what, we understand, I mean, it was

553
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:27,880
just really tough what happened and I understand that, no, he kept his eyes on the Lord.

554
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:33,000
Remember we talked about being at Bethel, the place of God, the house of God?

555
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,640
He was there.

556
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:40,840
And Joseph, he had developed that character, he had known something about the truth of

557
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:45,200
Jehovah God and serving God, and we'll see this as we continue to study through his life

558
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:49,960
and understand what's been revealed to us in the pages of Scripture through the account

559
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:54,440
of Joseph, but I want you to understand this evening that there are times in your life

560
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:59,960
that you might be confused of what's going on.

561
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:03,160
You can be there.

562
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:12,760
But in that moment of confusion, never stop trusting God because God is greater.

563
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:15,200
God is greater.

564
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,200
But these people, God is greater.

565
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,480
But did you hear, God is greater?

566
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:25,840
You can go on the internet, you can watch conspiracy theory stuff until you're dead,

567
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,840
honestly.

568
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,840
Crazy.

569
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,480
Ultimately, God is in control.

570
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,360
God is in control.

571
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,680
God is in control.

572
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:39,840
As I look at Genesis 37 and I think about that truth in Psalm 90 that we spend our days

573
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:47,960
of the tale that is told, there are times in the story of our lives, the record of our

574
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:55,760
lives that somebody else might have seemingly had the pen.

575
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:00,360
The brothers, they're the ones kind of calling the shots here in Genesis 37.

576
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:03,000
They're the ones that have taken Joseph and thrown him in the pit and they're the ones

577
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,720
that make the decision that we're going to sell him into slavery.

578
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:13,920
Joseph's just at their whim, seemingly having no control.

579
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:19,280
But ultimately, God sent me before you.

580
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:23,600
That's Joseph's testimony and that is powerful.

581
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:31,440
If we could just get to that point in our lives, honestly, where we let God be God and

582
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:38,560
we recognize that these things, God is sovereign, God is in control, God has a plan, God has

583
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,560
a purpose.

584
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,560
Listen, what would happen?

585
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:48,440
How would we read the account in Joseph, excuse me, in Genesis if Joseph just went ahead and

586
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:54,000
forsook everything that he knew about God and just gave up on life and said, this isn't

587
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
fair?

588
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,840
You know when people say life isn't fair today?

589
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:01,240
Seems like you can hear it all the time, right?

590
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,440
Life isn't fair.

591
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:06,960
Life isn't fair.

592
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:12,600
How would you read the rest of Genesis if Joseph responded that way?

593
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:19,880
Joseph just quit living a righteous life because he had some hard times.

594
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:24,480
I don't think you'd read of Joseph ending up in the palace.

595
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,480
Do you?

596
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:28,000
I don't think so.

597
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,440
We see that he kept his eyes on the Lord.

598
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:33,040
This evening, two points of application.

599
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:39,880
Number one, Joseph was given a mission by his father.

600
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:44,760
Joseph's response to that mission reveals to us his complete submission and surrender

601
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,120
to the plan of his dad.

602
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,640
This evening, you and I have a heavenly father.

603
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:56,360
He has a mission for us, he has a plan for us, he has a purpose for our lives.

604
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,280
How is it that we respond to him?

605
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:03,080
Do we respond immediately with complete submission and surrender?

606
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,200
Lord, here's my life.

607
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,720
Do what you want to do.

608
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,720
Have thine own way, Lord.

609
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:14,320
My life, Lord, is yours to control.

610
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,320
Why?

611
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:19,080
I've been bought with a price.

612
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:22,400
Number two, your life might take an unexpected turn.

613
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:30,040
In fact, I think all of us, as we live, we can think of times when our life did take

614
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,600
an unexpected turn.

615
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:37,120
And don't think that the last one is the last one.

616
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:41,960
There may be other unexpected turns that lie ahead.

617
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:48,120
But we find that in those moments, we must keep our eyes on Jesus and we must trust him

618
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:52,200
to know that he always does what's best.

619
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,160
He knows what's right.

620
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:59,560
I trust that this evening we'd be challenged by this account from the life of Joseph.

621
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:05,680
We see the historical aspect of it, but oh, let's take application and let's respond as

622
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,680
we should.

623
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,240
Father, we love you.

624
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,360
We thank you for loving us.

625
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:12,580
Thank you for the truth of your word.

626
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:17,240
Thank you for the record that you've given us, Lord, here of the life of Joseph.

627
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:24,360
And as we think about his life at this particular time and these events that unfold, we understand

628
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:27,560
that there could certainly be a measure of confusion.

629
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:30,920
He besought his brothers, the Bible tells us.

630
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,320
They saw the anguish on his face.

631
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:38,000
But at times in our lives, if we'd be honest, we just don't understand maybe all that's

632
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,400
going on.

633
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:44,440
God, I pray that you'd help us tonight to trust you.

634
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:49,480
You'd help us to know how great you are and to know the plan that you have for us.

635
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:54,080
God, to know that you do all things well.

636
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:57,640
I pray that we would be in complete submission.

637
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:08,220
surrender to you and to your will, that we'd simply say, here am I. Lord, we thank you

638
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:13,220
for this record and testimony. I pray that you'd just work in our hearts now. We'll

639
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:16,660
thank you for every decision that's made, for it's in Christ's name we pray. Would

640
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:19,780
you stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed. Kimberly's going to play quietly

641
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:23,980
on the piano. Maybe God spoke to your heart this evening and maybe you just want to come

642
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:28,720
and maybe you're in the midst of an unexpected turn, something that's transpired, you just

643
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:35,160
don't understand. Say, God, I don't understand right now, but I'm trusting you. I'm believing

644
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:41,560
you. Maybe this evening if you're honest in your evaluation, you're not completely submitted

645
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:47,120
and surrendered to the will of your heavenly Father. Maybe you need to come this evening

646
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:54,300
and get that taken care of and fully surrender. As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
