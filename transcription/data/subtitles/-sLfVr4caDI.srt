1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,960
And as you're turning there, let me remind you to continue to pray for the Beacon of

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:13,079
Truth Ministries and got some opportunities for a number of Bibles and we're thankful

3
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:16,479
for the opportunity to assemble the scriptures here, but very exciting about what's going

4
00:00:16,479 --> 00:00:17,479
on.

5
00:00:17,479 --> 00:00:21,959
They have a deadline of getting those Samoan Bibles done and ready for shipment by October.

6
00:00:21,959 --> 00:00:25,280
And so if you'd pray with them about that, I know they'd greatly appreciate that.

7
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:30,000
First chapter number 11 and that this portion of scripture, just looking at a few verses

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,959
this morning from numbers 11, but let me remind you that one of the characteristics that God

9
00:00:34,959 --> 00:00:41,700
gives us in 2 Timothy chapter number three of the last days is that people will be unthankful.

10
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,000
And it's very interesting as you think about the lack of gratitude that is prevalent in

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,200
our society today.

12
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,400
I believe that really it doesn't take us long to just look around and listen to some things,

13
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:59,840
interact with some people, and we find in our society that there is a prevalent spirit

14
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,000
of lacking thankfulness, of discontent.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,959
And we see it in all sorts of spheres of our society today.

16
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:14,879
And the reality is that oftentimes as we look at all that's taking place, I believe that

17
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:20,480
as the people of God, the attitude of discontent, the lack of thanksgiving really should alarm

18
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,480
us.

19
00:01:21,559 --> 00:01:25,839
It should cause us to be greatly concerned and we should really put up guards that we

20
00:01:25,839 --> 00:01:27,720
are not influenced by it.

21
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,000
We'll get into the message this morning and I'll make a statement that I'll make now as

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,839
well that to complain is contagious.

23
00:01:35,839 --> 00:01:41,000
And really there's a spirit of complaining that as you live in our society and you see

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,720
these things that are happening, that it's very easy to join in and to begin to participate

25
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,440
in that same level of behavior.

26
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:55,000
It is often said, and you would think of the truth of the nation of Israel, we'll look

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
at this passage of Scripture this morning and a number of others here in the Old Testament,

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,440
when you think about the children of Israel, often we are quick to criticize them for their

29
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,440
complaining.

30
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,039
We read of their murmuring and their complaining all throughout the Old Testament.

31
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:13,759
It's very easy for us to quickly criticize them for it, but it's been often observed

32
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:18,839
that if we're not careful, we too will imitate that behavior that we criticize.

33
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:24,479
And how careful we must be, I think of this when I think about this spirit of discontent,

34
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:29,639
this lack of thankfulness in our society today, that oftentimes it is manifested through a

35
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:32,000
complaining spirit.

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,960
You interact with people just as I do and you know that it's very easy to be able to

37
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:42,880
begin a conversation with someone and to immediately begin to hear of complaints.

38
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:47,720
And that's amazing as to what we as human beings are able to complain about.

39
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:52,279
In fact, I've often thought if we'd put as much effort into finding things to rejoice

40
00:02:52,279 --> 00:02:58,639
in, it'd certainly be a blessing because it seems as if sometimes it's very much effort

41
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:04,039
that is put into the idea of complaining and looking for things to complain about.

42
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:10,679
Notice in Numbers chapter 11, the Bible says this, and when the people complained, it displeased

43
00:03:10,679 --> 00:03:11,679
the Lord.

44
00:03:11,679 --> 00:03:18,639
And the Lord heard it, and His anger was kindled, and the fire of the Lord burnt among them

45
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:22,600
and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the camp.

46
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:28,679
Verse 2, the people cried unto Moses, and when Moses prayed unto the Lord, the fire

47
00:03:28,679 --> 00:03:29,800
was quenched.

48
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:36,720
And he called the name of the place Tiberia because the fire of the Lord burnt among them.

49
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:42,399
I'm thankful that as Moses prayed that the fire was quenched, our God is gracious.

50
00:03:42,399 --> 00:03:43,399
He's merciful.

51
00:03:43,399 --> 00:03:46,800
He's full of compassion, and for that we ought to rejoice.

52
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:52,520
But you look at the first verse of Numbers 11, and we'll use it as our title this morning,

53
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,080
when the people complained.

54
00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:01,039
The word complain means to utter expressions of censure or resentment, to murmur, to find

55
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:02,039
fault.

56
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:06,559
And if you look at this, and I think it's a wise observation, that fault is the easiest

57
00:04:06,559 --> 00:04:09,119
thing in the world to find.

58
00:04:09,119 --> 00:04:10,380
Think about that.

59
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:15,919
And so often it's easy for us to find fault with the society in which we live and all

60
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:21,239
sorts of things that we encounter, and we find here as we look at this passage of Scripture

61
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:25,880
that there's rich truth for us to glean from that I believe God will help us.

62
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:30,799
If you're taking notes this morning, notice number one, the tendency to complain.

63
00:04:30,799 --> 00:04:32,399
The tendency to complain.

64
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:37,519
As you trace the steps of the children of Israel, you will find over and over the murmuring

65
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:43,399
and the complaining that is so prevalent amongst the children of Israel, the people of God,

66
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:46,760
there is a tendency on their part to complain.

67
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:52,640
I believe that it's a human tendency for us to complain, and we find that it's easy to

68
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:57,519
complain about things, and it's easy to get into the spirit of complaint, and we find

69
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:01,600
that their tendency, the tendency of the children of Israel is well documented in the

70
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,959
Old Testament.

71
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:08,399
Notice if you will, go back to the book of Exodus in chapter number 14, and we read in

72
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:13,799
Exodus chapter number 14 of just great might and great power and how God demonstrated this

73
00:05:13,799 --> 00:05:18,920
power in drying up the Red Sea, and you think about the miracle of the crossing of the Red

74
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:23,119
Sea, and you think about what the people as they feared, and it tells us in verse number

75
00:05:23,119 --> 00:05:27,720
10 that when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and behold,

76
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,000
the Egyptians marched after them, and they were sore afraid, and the children of Israel

77
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,279
cried unto the Lord, and they were fearful for their very existence, and Moses speaks

78
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:43,359
to them, and the Lord speaks, and Moses says, the Lord shall fight for you in verse number

79
00:05:43,359 --> 00:05:49,320
14, and ye shall hold your peace, and God says in verse number 15 that Moses is to speak

80
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:55,559
unto the children of Israel that they go forward, that they will see the salvation

81
00:05:55,559 --> 00:06:01,559
of the Lord, and you know the account and what a record it is in Exodus 14 to see how

82
00:06:01,559 --> 00:06:07,079
the Lord allowed for the children of Israel to cross over on dry ground, and God destroyed

83
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:13,079
the Egyptians who assayed to go in after them, and God worked miraculously, and after they

84
00:06:13,119 --> 00:06:19,559
had crossed, and after God had allowed the Egyptians to drive heavily their wagons there,

85
00:06:19,559 --> 00:06:24,040
their chariots, we find that God closed up the Red Sea, and He destroyed the children

86
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:30,160
of Israel, and it was reason to rejoice, and in Exodus chapter 15 you see the song of deliverance,

87
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:36,239
you see the rejoicing, they say this in verse number 1 of Exodus 15, then sang Moses and

88
00:06:36,239 --> 00:06:41,440
the children of Israel this song unto the Lord, and spake, saying, I will sing unto

89
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,440
the Lord.

90
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,440
Why?

91
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,640
For he hath triumphed gloriously.

92
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,679
The horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.

93
00:06:48,679 --> 00:06:55,239
Notice in verse 13, thou in thy mercy hath led forth the people which thou hast redeemed.

94
00:06:55,239 --> 00:07:00,239
Thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation.

95
00:07:00,239 --> 00:07:03,239
Verse 18, the Lord shall reign forever and ever.

96
00:07:03,239 --> 00:07:07,200
I mean, they're rejoicing, and rightly so.

97
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,200
God had worked miraculously.

98
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,839
It's amazing, on the heels of seeing such miraculous deliverance, on the very heels

99
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:22,279
of singing such a wonderful song of deliverance, the Bible tells us in verse number 22, so

100
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:27,200
Moses brought Israel from the Red Sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur,

101
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:32,959
and they were three days, they went three days in the wilderness and found no water.

102
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:39,920
So just a few days after seeing the miraculous, powerful hand of God Almighty, after singing

103
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:46,320
his triumphs and singing his praises and singing how the Lord shall reign forever and ever,

104
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:51,600
and God led them, we understand, by the pillar of cloud by day, the pillar of fire by night,

105
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,839
and they come to a place, and the Bible tells us that they find no water, and they came

106
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:59,399
to Marah in verse 23, and they could not drink of the waters.

107
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:00,399
Why?

108
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:05,519
Because they were bitter, and notice it says in verse 24, and the people murmured against

109
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:06,519
Moses.

110
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:12,119
It didn't take long for these nation of Israel, these people of God to begin to murmur and

111
00:08:12,119 --> 00:08:13,839
complain about what?

112
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:19,079
About their circumstances, about their situations, about the things that they were facing.

113
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:22,440
The reality is that God knows that they needed water.

114
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,519
Amen?

115
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:24,839
God knows what our needs are.

116
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:29,679
He knows where we need to be, and God, he doeth all things well.

117
00:08:29,679 --> 00:08:32,880
He led them exactly to where they were supposed to be.

118
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,520
We find that they find themselves here in this portion of Scripture where they're murmuring

119
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:42,780
against Moses, and they say, what shall we drink?

120
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:46,840
Notice in verse 25 that he cried unto the Lord Moses, and the Lord showed him a tree,

121
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:50,880
and he cast it into the waters, and the waters were made sweet, and he made for them a statute

122
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:56,520
and ordinance, and there he proved them, and what a great truth of seeing the power of

123
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,520
God.

124
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,059
Now, I want you to think about the experience of the children of Israel, their tendency

125
00:09:01,059 --> 00:09:02,119
to complain.

126
00:09:02,119 --> 00:09:04,260
They would see God work miraculously.

127
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,159
They would see God provide for them.

128
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:11,979
They would see God prove them, and he would prove himself and his power, and yet they

129
00:09:11,979 --> 00:09:13,760
would face another obstacle.

130
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,700
They would face a circumstance, a situation that perhaps we would describe as being less

131
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:23,500
than desirable, and immediately, what would their default setting be?

132
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,479
It would be this tendency to complain.

133
00:09:26,479 --> 00:09:28,559
It was like a default setting.

134
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:32,359
In verse number, excuse me, in chapter number 16, you find the Bible tells us that they

135
00:09:32,359 --> 00:09:37,979
took their journey from Elam, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came

136
00:09:37,979 --> 00:09:42,840
unto the wilderness of Sin, and it says, which is between Elam and Sinai, on the fifteenth

137
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:46,400
day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt.

138
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,799
So I want you to consider with me that it's only the two and a half months after they'd

139
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:55,960
seen God work miraculously and deliver them, and think about all of the wonders that they

140
00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:00,039
saw in the plagues in Egypt, and then delivering.

141
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:03,719
and the crossing of the Red Sea, and then the waters healed at Marah.

142
00:10:03,719 --> 00:10:07,319
And the Bible tells us here in Exodus chapter number 16

143
00:10:07,319 --> 00:10:10,439
that they go through and they are complaining again.

144
00:10:10,439 --> 00:10:11,639
In verse number 3, it says,

145
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:13,079
"...the children of Israel said unto them,

146
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:17,879
Would to God we had died by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt,

147
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:21,239
when we sat by the flesh pots, and when we did eat bread to the full.

148
00:10:21,239 --> 00:10:22,279
Notice what they said,

149
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:24,759
For ye have brought us forth into this wilderness

150
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:28,279
to kill this whole assembly with hunger."

151
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:32,119
Notice what the Lord said unto Moses in verse number 4.

152
00:10:32,119 --> 00:10:32,519
He said,

153
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:35,239
"...I will rain bread from heaven for you,

154
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:38,999
and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day,

155
00:10:38,999 --> 00:10:43,159
that I may prove them whether they will walk in my law or no."

156
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:46,439
I want you to think about the next 40 years,

157
00:10:46,439 --> 00:10:49,879
how the children of Israel would receive this bread daily.

158
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:54,439
And God miraculously provided day by day.

159
00:10:54,439 --> 00:10:56,359
Of course, we understand that on the Sabbath,

160
00:10:56,359 --> 00:10:58,999
He would not send the manna for on the sixth day.

161
00:10:58,999 --> 00:11:00,679
They were to gather twice as much.

162
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:04,679
And He here in Exodus chapter number 16 provides all of the details

163
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:08,359
and how He was going to prove His people,

164
00:11:08,359 --> 00:11:10,359
and He was going to prove His power.

165
00:11:10,359 --> 00:11:12,759
And we find that the children of Israel, however,

166
00:11:13,319 --> 00:11:16,519
they were murmuring against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness,

167
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:18,199
according to verse number 2.

168
00:11:18,199 --> 00:11:19,239
And they say,

169
00:11:19,239 --> 00:11:22,519
"...it would have been better for us to have died in Egypt."

170
00:11:23,079 --> 00:11:26,039
Certainly, for a people that had experienced

171
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:28,759
what they had experienced up to this point in their lives,

172
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:32,439
the default setting should no longer be complaining.

173
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:34,059
Amen?

174
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:39,319
The default setting could be a wonder how God is going to work.

175
00:11:39,319 --> 00:11:41,719
What is God going to do in this situation?

176
00:11:41,719 --> 00:11:43,479
Let us seek the face of God.

177
00:11:43,479 --> 00:11:46,439
Let us praise God for the place in which He's brought us,

178
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:50,599
and let us look to Him for how He will provide for us.

179
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:52,359
But no, the people murmur.

180
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,039
They murmur against Moses and against Aaron.

181
00:11:56,839 --> 00:11:58,759
God proves them in chapter 16.

182
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:01,479
We read about the manna.

183
00:12:01,479 --> 00:12:04,359
It tells us in verse number 35 of Exodus 16,

184
00:12:04,359 --> 00:12:06,599
that the children of Israel did eat manna 40 years

185
00:12:07,479 --> 00:12:09,799
until they came to a land inhabited.

186
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:13,319
They did eat manna until they came into the borders of the land of Canaan.

187
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:18,839
And then we enter into the 17th chapter of the book of Exodus,

188
00:12:19,719 --> 00:12:20,599
the book of Exodus.

189
00:12:20,599 --> 00:12:23,319
We're speaking this morning of the tendency to complain

190
00:12:23,319 --> 00:12:27,079
and how the tendency of the children of Israel is well-documented.

191
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:31,079
In chapter 17 of verse number 1, it says,

192
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:33,239
and all the congregation of the children of Israel

193
00:12:33,239 --> 00:12:36,519
journeyed from the wilderness of sin after their journeys

194
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:38,119
according to the commandment of the Lord,

195
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:40,839
and pitched in Rephidim,

196
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:42,759
and there was no water for the people to drink.

197
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:46,119
So, the Bible tells us that they were in that place

198
00:12:46,119 --> 00:12:48,599
according to the commandment of the Lord in verse number 1.

199
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:51,559
The Bible tells us of their circumstances

200
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:52,839
that there's no water to drink,

201
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:54,679
and it tells us in verse number 2

202
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:56,839
that the people did chide with Moses.

203
00:12:56,839 --> 00:12:58,359
If you look at verse number 3,

204
00:12:58,359 --> 00:13:00,439
it's the people thirsted there for water

205
00:13:00,439 --> 00:13:02,679
and the people murmured against Moses.

206
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:06,999
We read of this tendency of the children of Israel

207
00:13:06,999 --> 00:13:10,279
and we read how that as they had barely finished

208
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:12,439
seeing God provide miraculously,

209
00:13:12,439 --> 00:13:14,759
they would complain about their situation

210
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:17,399
and then God would graciously provide for them

211
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:19,079
and he would prove his power,

212
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:21,239
and yet they would face another difficulty

213
00:13:21,239 --> 00:13:24,359
and they would complain, the tendency of complaining.

214
00:13:25,319 --> 00:13:27,879
Turn over to the book of Numbers

215
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:30,199
where we are here this morning in chapter number 11,

216
00:13:30,199 --> 00:13:34,359
and really much of the remainder of the book of Exodus

217
00:13:34,359 --> 00:13:38,119
would communicate for us the 10 commandments,

218
00:13:38,119 --> 00:13:40,359
the requirements and the instructions

219
00:13:40,359 --> 00:13:42,999
with regard to the tabernacle and all of those things.

220
00:13:42,999 --> 00:13:44,759
And of course, the book of Leviticus

221
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:47,799
providing for us much detail with regard to the law.

222
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:49,479
And we come here and really kind of pick up

223
00:13:49,479 --> 00:13:52,599
the journey of the children of Israel in Numbers 11.

224
00:13:52,599 --> 00:13:53,799
You find that the Bible says,

225
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:55,639
and when the people complained,

226
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:57,319
it was a default setting,

227
00:13:57,319 --> 00:13:59,559
it was a tendency for the children of Israel.

228
00:14:00,199 --> 00:14:02,199
And it's a tendency in our human nature,

229
00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:03,239
and we must be careful,

230
00:14:03,239 --> 00:14:06,839
we must guard against this tendency of complaining.

231
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:09,319
I would say that, as I mentioned by way of introduction,

232
00:14:09,319 --> 00:14:10,919
that complaining is contagious.

233
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:13,079
You get around at the workplace

234
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:15,639
and you begin to complain about the job,

235
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:18,279
you begin to complain about the supervisor,

236
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:20,039
you begin to complain about the requirements

237
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:22,039
and the responsibility and the lack of pay,

238
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:23,639
and there's no this and there's no that.

239
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:24,279
And guess what?

240
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:26,599
Before long, you got a whole crowd that wants to chime in

241
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:29,639
and wants to join in and sing the complaints

242
00:14:30,199 --> 00:14:32,439
about the circumstances, right?

243
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:34,759
We see it in the job place.

244
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:36,279
I worked in the corporate world for years.

245
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:37,159
I know how it works.

246
00:14:38,599 --> 00:14:40,039
Complain about gas prices.

247
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:42,199
You hear that complaint recently?

248
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:44,059
Right?

249
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,359
It's all over the place, right?

250
00:14:46,359 --> 00:14:49,319
Complaining about gas prices, right?

251
00:14:49,319 --> 00:14:51,719
Complaining about I had to dip into my savings,

252
00:14:51,719 --> 00:14:53,799
I had to take out whatever.

253
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:55,239
I was talking to the kids and I said,

254
00:14:55,239 --> 00:14:56,279
you know, I said,

255
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:57,399
one of the things that's interesting

256
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:59,159
is if we change our perspective,

257
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:01,159
maybe instead of complaining about the gas prices,

258
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:03,879
we can rejoice that God provided for us in advance

259
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:05,239
so that we could pay for the gas.

260
00:15:06,199 --> 00:15:09,639
It's just a change of perspective, right?

261
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:10,839
What we sang this morning,

262
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:12,999
God is so good.

263
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:16,359
Is he good even if the gas prices go through the roof?

264
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:17,719
Sure he is.

265
00:15:18,439 --> 00:15:20,599
Is he good if the boss requires you to do more

266
00:15:20,599 --> 00:15:21,399
than you think that?

267
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:22,199
Yes, he is.

268
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:24,439
He's good.

269
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:26,519
He's good.

270
00:15:27,319 --> 00:15:29,639
And so often we find in our society

271
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:32,119
that there's this tendency to complain

272
00:15:32,119 --> 00:15:33,479
and it's contagious.

273
00:15:33,479 --> 00:15:35,239
It's something that impacts us.

274
00:15:35,239 --> 00:15:37,079
We see people complaining in their homes.

275
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:39,879
We see people complaining about their spouses.

276
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:41,719
We see people complaining about their children.

277
00:15:41,719 --> 00:15:43,799
We see children complaining about their parents.

278
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:46,599
And I mean, the list just goes on and on and on.

279
00:15:48,119 --> 00:15:51,399
And lest we fool ourselves this morning,

280
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:52,919
we must acknowledge this morning

281
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:54,999
that there's a tendency to complain still today,

282
00:15:54,999 --> 00:15:56,359
even amongst the people of God,

283
00:15:58,039 --> 00:15:59,079
in the house of God.

284
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:00,439
Amen.

285
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:01,799
It happens.

286
00:16:02,359 --> 00:16:03,959
There's a tendency to complain.

287
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:07,639
I remember when we lived out in Nevada,

288
00:16:08,199 --> 00:16:11,799
hearing a story of a situation with a preacher

289
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:13,399
that was out in that area.

290
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:14,999
And if you've been out to the northwest part

291
00:16:14,999 --> 00:16:15,799
of the United States,

292
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:18,439
you'll find that in a number of those states

293
00:16:18,439 --> 00:16:21,319
in Nevada and up into Idaho

294
00:16:21,319 --> 00:16:25,799
and some of the other parts of that area of the country,

295
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:29,319
you'll find that there are few and far of churches,

296
00:16:29,319 --> 00:16:30,839
Bible-believing churches.

297
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:34,519
The town that we lived in in Nevada,

298
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:38,359
if we wanted to go to a church like our church today,

299
00:16:38,359 --> 00:16:41,639
we would have had to have driven about 120 miles one way.

300
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:46,679
It's crazy.

301
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:50,279
And I heard a man make the statement

302
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:53,399
about a man that was complaining about his church.

303
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:56,119
And he said, you know, you ought to be thankful

304
00:16:56,119 --> 00:16:56,999
you have a church.

305
00:16:58,199 --> 00:16:59,319
Because I live in a place,

306
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:00,679
and he noted where he lived,

307
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:02,839
and he said, I can't hear preaching

308
00:17:03,479 --> 00:17:05,079
that's solid to the Word of God.

309
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:07,879
I can't be in a place

310
00:17:07,879 --> 00:17:09,639
where we can fellowship with believers

311
00:17:09,639 --> 00:17:11,959
because there's just no church.

312
00:17:13,479 --> 00:17:15,959
I have to listen to, back then when I heard this,

313
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:17,959
they listened to the church on the radio.

314
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:20,359
He said, if I want to hear good preaching,

315
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:21,879
I have to listen to the radio.

316
00:17:22,999 --> 00:17:25,639
He said, so before you complain again about your church,

317
00:17:25,639 --> 00:17:27,559
I want you to consider some things.

318
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:30,039
Man, that was impactful to me as a young person.

319
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:32,999
And thinking about the tendency,

320
00:17:32,999 --> 00:17:34,359
listen, it's easy to complain.

321
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:35,559
I mentioned by way of introduction

322
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:37,399
that somebody made the observation

323
00:17:37,399 --> 00:17:39,399
that finding fault is one of the easiest things

324
00:17:39,399 --> 00:17:40,359
to find in the world.

325
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:41,559
Isn't it true?

326
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:44,039
Man, we can have a wonderful meal,

327
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:46,359
and there could be 95% of the things

328
00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:47,799
could be just perfect.

329
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:48,839
I mean, spot on.

330
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:52,599
But we find fault in that one little thing, right?

331
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:56,039
It's a tendency of human nature.

332
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:57,159
We see the tendency.

333
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:59,559
It's well-documented for the children of Israel.

334
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:01,399
It's amazing as you look through

335
00:18:01,399 --> 00:18:03,479
and you begin to see all that happens

336
00:18:03,479 --> 00:18:06,999
in the testimony of the children of Israel

337
00:18:06,999 --> 00:18:09,319
and their complaining spirit

338
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:12,599
and this tendency of theirs.

339
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:14,439
And again, how we criticize them,

340
00:18:14,439 --> 00:18:15,959
but if we're not careful,

341
00:18:15,959 --> 00:18:18,919
how we also will come to the place

342
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:20,919
where we imitate them.

343
00:18:21,639 --> 00:18:23,159
We'll get there in just a few minutes,

344
00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:24,439
but it's interesting how that

345
00:18:24,439 --> 00:18:26,759
in the 21st chapter of the book of Numbers.

346
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:28,519
In fact, why don't you turn over there now?

347
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:30,919
I want you to look in Numbers 21.

348
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:34,279
I want you to see just the extent

349
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,799
of this tendency.

350
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:38,279
It tells us in verse 4 of Numbers 21,

351
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:38,759
it says,

352
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:41,559
Now, and they journeyed from Mount Hor

353
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:42,759
by the way of the Red Sea

354
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:44,519
to compass the land of Edom.

355
00:18:45,719 --> 00:18:46,440
It says this,

356
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,479
that the soul of the people

357
00:18:47,479 --> 00:18:49,639
was much discouraged because of the way.

358
00:18:51,479 --> 00:18:53,479
The people, they spake against God

359
00:18:53,479 --> 00:18:55,159
and they spake against Moses.

360
00:18:55,719 --> 00:18:56,519
Here's what they said,

361
00:18:56,519 --> 00:18:58,519
Wherefore have you brought us up

362
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:00,359
out of Egypt to die in the wilderness?

363
00:19:01,239 --> 00:19:02,199
Notice what they say,

364
00:19:02,919 --> 00:19:04,039
For there is no bread,

365
00:19:05,239 --> 00:19:06,839
neither is there any water,

366
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,639
and our soul loatheth this light bread.

367
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:14,359
Now in their complaint,

368
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:17,159
they were discouraged about the way.

369
00:19:17,159 --> 00:19:19,880
In their complaint, they said two things.

370
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,399
Number one, there's no bread.

371
00:19:21,399 --> 00:19:22,759
And number two, there's no water.

372
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:25,000
And then their third complaint

373
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,519
is that our soul hates,

374
00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:28,759
loatheth this light bread.

375
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:29,719
Now they just got done saying

376
00:19:29,719 --> 00:19:32,039
there was no bread, right?

377
00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:34,039
And now they're saying

378
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:35,479
our soul loatheth,

379
00:19:35,479 --> 00:19:36,839
hateth this light bread.

380
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:37,799
What are they referring to?

381
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:39,179
Manna.

382
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:43,079
The manna that God graciously

383
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:46,279
and miraculously provided for them.

384
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:48,519
The manna that rain from heaven

385
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:50,519
that we looked at in Exodus 16

386
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:51,320
when God said,

387
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,279
I'm going to prove them

388
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:53,000
and I'm going to,

389
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,159
I'm going to rain bread from heaven.

390
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:57,320
And the people of God

391
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,880
are complaining about the.

392
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:04,520
provision of God, and we can criticize them.

393
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:11,020
And by the way, it's okay to criticize them, because God wasn't pleased with them.

394
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:16,040
And it's not appropriate behavior, but in the very midst of their complaint, it shows

395
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,420
their inconsistency.

396
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:22,220
It shows that their perspective is wrong.

397
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:26,320
Notice with me not only the tendency of complaining, but notice the tragedy of complaining.

398
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,880
Go back to Numbers 11, if you will.

399
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:32,160
I want you to look at the tragedy of complaining.

400
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:39,520
And honestly, this morning, it is a tragedy when people complain, it really is.

401
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:45,320
In Numbers 11, the Bible says this in verse number 1, and when the people complained,

402
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:50,840
notice this, it displeased the Lord.

403
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,840
What is it?

404
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,380
Well, it's their complaining.

405
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:58,180
It is their complaining that was the reason for God being displeased with them.

406
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:04,300
It's interesting, as Paul would deal with this truth for the church in Corinth in 1

407
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:07,300
Corinthians chapter number 10, and you don't need to turn there, but I'll reference two

408
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:12,500
verses of Scripture in 1 Corinthians 10, in verse number 5, God says this, but with many

409
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:16,020
of them, God was not well pleased.

410
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:20,380
In verse number 10, the final example that he uses of the behavior that did not please

411
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:26,640
the Lord, he says, neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured and were destroyed

412
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,940
of the destroyer.

413
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:33,380
The tragedy of complaining, number one, it displeased the Lord.

414
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:37,260
I don't want to do anything in my life that would displease the Lord.

415
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:42,500
I didn't say that I never displeased the Lord, I said I don't want to do anything that displeases

416
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,500
the Lord.

417
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:48,260
And we need to come to that place in our life where we say, I don't want to displease God.

418
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:54,460
I don't want to displease my Father, because truly God is good and I don't want to displease

419
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,460
Him.

420
00:21:55,460 --> 00:22:00,060
And when He tells us of things in His Word specifically that would displease Him, then

421
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:02,380
I want to stay far away from that.

422
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:04,900
I want to avoid it.

423
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:08,660
Notice, you continue reading in Numbers 11 and verse number 1, it says, and when the

424
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,559
people complained, it displeased the Lord.

425
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:14,779
But notice this, and the Lord heard it.

426
00:22:14,779 --> 00:22:16,500
The Lord heard it.

427
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:20,980
You know, God hears everything.

428
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,980
God hears everything.

429
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:27,540
It's kind of interesting because in the New Testament when it talks about complaining

430
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:34,260
and murmuring, it kind of has the idea of having something that's just not well-known

431
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:38,040
and well-documented, something that's done in secret.

432
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,620
But God knows.

433
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,100
God hears.

434
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:46,020
And the Bible tells us that it displeased the Lord, but it says the Lord heard it.

435
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:51,660
Isn't it so much better for the Lord to hear the praise of His people?

436
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,100
Seriously.

437
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:58,460
That He would hear the praise of His people, not the complaints of His people.

438
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:06,380
It's not for us to complain and we must recognize the tendency, but it's important that we understand

439
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:12,220
the tragedy of complaining, that it displeases the Lord, that He hears it.

440
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:18,540
And then notice as we continue in verse number 11, it says, and His anger was kindled.

441
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:24,419
Oftentimes we see that the complaining of the people of God resulted in severe judgment.

442
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:29,360
Here in Numbers 11, the Bible tells us that the fire of the Lord burnt among them and

443
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,980
consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the camp.

444
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,660
The Lord heard their complaining.

445
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,980
The Lord was displeased with their complaining.

446
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:41,380
And the Lord brought judgment because of their complaining.

447
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:44,419
Now again, I want to steer clear of the judgment of God.

448
00:23:44,419 --> 00:23:45,860
Amen?

449
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:48,139
I want to steer clear of the judgment of God.

450
00:23:48,139 --> 00:23:53,620
And we find that there are many examples in which God has given us, especially as we look

451
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:57,500
in the Old Testament here, with regard to the complaining spirit of the children of

452
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:02,139
Israel and their tendency to complain, and the tragedy and the results of the severe

453
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,300
judgment.

454
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:08,340
Here in Numbers 11, again in Numbers chapter 16, you see that there's a plague as a result.

455
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,180
We see the fire at the beginning of the chapter.

456
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:12,500
You see the plague near the end of the chapter.

457
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,460
And in chapter 16, you see the plague.

458
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,179
In Numbers chapter 12, guess what?

459
00:24:16,179 --> 00:24:20,500
Miriam and Aaron, they're complaining, they're speaking against Moses, and Miriam is stricken

460
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,220
with leprosy.

461
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:28,020
We find that the Bible tells us in Numbers chapter 16 that those that were complaining,

462
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:31,860
that the earth opened up and swallowed them.

463
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:37,540
Wow, amazing, the severe judgment of God.

464
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:41,899
In Numbers 21 that we looked at just a moment ago where they were complaining and saying

465
00:24:41,899 --> 00:24:47,739
that our soul loatheth this light bread, they had complained about the way, they were discouraged

466
00:24:47,739 --> 00:24:50,660
because of the way in which they had been led by God Almighty.

467
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:55,260
They were discouraged and they were complaining, and the Bible tells us in verse number 6 of

468
00:24:55,260 --> 00:25:01,200
Numbers 21 that the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people

469
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,559
and much people of Israel died.

470
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:09,160
We read about the brazen serpent and how that Moses obeyed the instruction of the Lord and

471
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:12,440
he gave the instruction of the people that if they were to look, they would live.

472
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:16,399
And certainly that was accomplished, and you see that at the end of the chapter, or at

473
00:25:16,399 --> 00:25:20,679
the end of the passage in verse number 9, that truth of looking and living.

474
00:25:20,679 --> 00:25:25,600
And we sing the song, Look and Live, and it's certainly derived from this portion of Scripture.

475
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:30,800
And I want you to think about the complaint of the people and the judgment, the severe

476
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,440
judgment.

477
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:36,040
They're complaining about no water and no bread and they were discouraged about the

478
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,360
way and God sent fiery serpents.

479
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:44,440
I bet you all of a sudden they weren't too upset about the way.

480
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:47,200
They weren't too concerned about the manna, right?

481
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:52,040
Because now they've got fiery serpents.

482
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:55,559
This morning as we think about the tragedy of complaining, I want to draw your attention

483
00:25:55,559 --> 00:26:03,339
to a verse in the book of Psalms, Psalm 106, Psalm 106, I want you to think about the impact

484
00:26:03,339 --> 00:26:05,720
of our complaining on others.

485
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:10,679
I mentioned already that complaining is easy and the tendency of complaining and the fact

486
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:16,920
that complaining is contagious and we've kind of given some truth with regard to various

487
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:21,720
circumstances and environments in which complaining takes place.

488
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:29,000
I want you to think about the way in which our complaining impacts others.

489
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,800
We look in Psalm 106 and the Bible tells us, it's an interesting verse of Scripture in

490
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:38,360
verse number 25, it's speaking of the children of Israel and going through several of their

491
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,279
things, their history and how they believed.

492
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:46,399
It's interesting, look in verse 12, they believed, then believed they His words, they

493
00:26:46,399 --> 00:26:48,800
sang His praise.

494
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:52,800
They soon forgot His works, they waited not for His counsel.

495
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:57,239
They forgot God in verse 21, their Savior, which had done great things in Egypt.

496
00:26:57,239 --> 00:27:02,000
It's amazing how quickly things can change and how they were remembering and praising

497
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,119
and then they're forgetting because of some circumstances and they're complaining.

498
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:12,080
It says in verse 24, yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not His word,

499
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:19,720
but murmured in their tents and hearkened not unto the voice of the Lord.

500
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:24,520
What is representative here of this phraseology, but murmured in their tents, this would be

501
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,860
their dwelling place.

502
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:30,559
We would say this, it would be in our homes, right?

503
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:37,440
When you think about the murmuring in our homes and perhaps the impact and the influence

504
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:44,080
upon a future generation, we've already mentioned the fact that God hears our complaints, but

505
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:49,080
we must also recognize this morning that there are other people that hear our complaints.

506
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:54,520
And when they hear our complaints, we must ask ourselves, how does it impact them?

507
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,320
How does it affect them?

508
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:01,360
What image are we portraying of our God when we're complaining about our circumstances,

509
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:08,119
when we're complaining about the environment in which God has placed us?

510
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:10,179
How's it impacting them?

511
00:28:10,179 --> 00:28:12,760
We criticize the children of Israel, why?

512
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:17,959
Because they're complaining, they're not trusting God, they're not delighting in what God has

513
00:28:17,959 --> 00:28:20,920
provided and how God has directed.

514
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:25,559
And we can look at their lives and we can criticize them, but the reality is that we

515
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:30,559
must understand there's this tragic impact of complaining and you think about how others

516
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:38,440
will hear, again, how wonderful for God to hear the praises of His people.

517
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:44,880
But even for others that hear our praises as opposed to our complaints, they hear that

518
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,880
our God is good.

519
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:51,280
I mean, in the midst of a society, again, as we mentioned there in 2 Timothy 3, that

520
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:54,479
one of the characteristics is that people will be unthankful.

521
00:28:54,479 --> 00:29:00,080
It doesn't take us long as we go through this world to see that there's this complaining

522
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:04,679
spirit that is prevalent, but when they see something different about you and I, when

523
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:10,440
they see that we're not complaining about all of the things, the hot topics in the news

524
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:15,200
this week and what they will be next week and how we complain about all those things,

525
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,359
but they're hearing us sing praise to our God, that He's in control, that He doeth all

526
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:25,320
things well, that He has a plan, that He has a purpose, that we're not living under the

527
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:32,080
circumstances, we're living trusting that God is doing all things well.

528
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:38,880
We see the tragedy of complaining, not only the way in which it displeases the Lord, but

529
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:45,280
the way in which it impacts others, and certainly complaining has an impact on other people.

530
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:51,200
This morning we've noted from Numbers 11 the tendency of complaining, the tragedy of complaining.

531
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:56,559
Number three, I want you to think of this to triumph over complaining.

532
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:59,880
If we acknowledge this morning that there's a tendency amongst...

533
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,880
the children of Israel.

534
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,520
And if we'd be honest with ourselves

535
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,600
and we'd be honest before the Lord

536
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,240
that we'd say even in our own lives,

537
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,220
for some of us, there's a tendency to complain.

538
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:12,080
There's this human response to the adversities,

539
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,880
to the difficulties, to the things

540
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,940
that we just flat out don't like, that we just complain.

541
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,780
That we'd understand this morning

542
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:22,320
that there's that tendency and it's a tragedy,

543
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,880
then I must come to the place where I say,

544
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:27,000
can I, how can I triumph over this?

545
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,080
How can I have victory over this complaining spirit

546
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:35,480
that's so prevalent in our society today that impacts me?

547
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,760
Listen, when you go to the workplace

548
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,160
and you hear other people complaining,

549
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,320
even when you set out that today

550
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,520
is going to be the day, I am not gonna complain today.

551
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,300
And then all of a sudden, things happen.

552
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,480
People talk to you.

553
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,760
I can't believe, did you hear what?

554
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:56,240
And all of a sudden, man, it just, right?

555
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,440
That's how it works.

556
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,960
But look at the book of Philippians, if you will.

557
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,580
Look at the book of Philippians in chapter number two.

558
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:10,140
How to triumph over complaining,

559
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:13,540
we could ask ourselves this question, is it even possible?

560
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,560
Is it possible as we live in the midst

561
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,720
of a crooked and perverse generation,

562
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,240
is it possible as we live in the midst of a people

563
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,600
in these last days that will be characterized

564
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,680
as being unthankful and we hear it

565
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,080
and we're bombarded with it,

566
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,600
and you can ask somebody today, hey, how are ya?

567
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,120
It's a little bit too cold.

568
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,680
You ask them yesterday, how are ya?

569
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,980
It's a little bit too hot.

570
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:35,520
You ask them yesterday, how are ya?

571
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,840
It's a little bit too windy.

572
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:40,400
I mean, we just complain about everything, right?

573
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,180
In the midst of that type of an environment,

574
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,720
I believe that we as the people of God

575
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,120
can triumph over complaining.

576
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,160
Notice in Philippians two and verse number 14,

577
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,960
notice what God says.

578
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:03,240
Do all things without murmurings and disputings.

579
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,920
How many things?

580
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,000
All things.

581
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:13,120
There's really in our minds sometimes in this day

582
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,520
in which we live, we like to separate

583
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,520
the sacred from the secular.

584
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:21,000
Compartmentalize, if you will.

585
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,940
But the reality is that for the people of God,

586
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,600
there's no real separation between

587
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,720
the sacred and the secular, amen?

588
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,880
And sometimes we think, well, we understand

589
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,520
the importance of the sacred over here

590
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:37,419
and this is this particular pillar in which we live in,

591
00:32:37,419 --> 00:32:38,960
but then the secular over here.

592
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,800
But the reality is that when he says

593
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,639
do all things without murmurings and disputings,

594
00:32:43,639 --> 00:32:45,260
we're not putting those categories,

595
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,559
we're not separating ourselves,

596
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:49,440
we're saying I am a child of God, that's who I am,

597
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,800
that's my identification and I belong to him

598
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:57,800
and I'm to do all things without murmurings and disputings.

599
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,840
Focus on that first thing there,

600
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,160
do all things without murmurings.

601
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:07,000
And as our subject matter this morning

602
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,160
would lead us to thinking of that truth,

603
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:13,120
and he says to do all things without murmurings.

604
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,720
Listen, there are some things that are easy

605
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,800
to do without murmuring, right?

606
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,960
There's some things that are just,

607
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,460
it's a delight for us to do them.

608
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,880
It's a joy, it's a privilege,

609
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,800
and it's something that we enjoy doing,

610
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,240
and so therefore, to do that thing,

611
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,800
whatever that thing is, and it's different

612
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,279
for each and every one of us,

613
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:33,800
it's easy for us to do it without complaining,

614
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,820
without murmuring.

615
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,400
But in like fashion for every single one of us,

616
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,720
there are some things that are a little bit

617
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:43,680
more difficult to do without murmuring, right?

618
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,760
We know, you know yourself.

619
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,360
I know myself.

620
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:53,160
And there are tasks, there are things

621
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:57,840
that sometimes it's some task that we have before us

622
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,900
that it's hard for us to do without murmuring.

623
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,559
It's gonna be a challenge.

624
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,400
And we come to the place where we say,

625
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,200
well, God said do all things,

626
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:13,540
not do the things I like without murmuring,

627
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:16,360
not do the things that are easy without murmuring,

628
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,239
not do the things that bring me joy

629
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,440
or bring me satisfaction without murmuring,

630
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:24,600
but he said do all things without murmurings

631
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,760
and disputings.

632
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,760
And so I think about these murmurings

633
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,119
and these do all things without murmurings,

634
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:33,559
and we say can we triumph over complaining?

635
00:34:33,559 --> 00:34:34,520
Is it possible?

636
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,520
And I would say yes, absolutely,

637
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,980
with the help of the Lord.

638
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,880
Let me say this, there is no command

639
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:43,540
that God has given us that he will not enable us to keep.

640
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,660
Amen?

641
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:46,700
I believe that.

642
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:49,520
That God has, if he's told us to do all things

643
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,380
without murmurings and disputings,

644
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:54,200
that with the help of God and by the grace of God,

645
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:58,920
by his enablement, we are able to do all things

646
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,040
without murmuring.

647
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:05,040
Even that thing that is the least on our list, right?

648
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:08,860
We can do it without murmuring, without complaining,

649
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:12,140
only with the help of God.

650
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:15,020
Notice, if you will, in 1 Thessalonians chapter five.

651
00:35:15,899 --> 00:35:18,339
I believe that this goes hand in hand

652
00:35:18,339 --> 00:35:20,860
and we're familiar with the latter part

653
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:23,700
of 1 Thessalonians five and how many

654
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,779
just simple verses of scripture

655
00:35:25,779 --> 00:35:28,940
and just commands and instructions that are given

656
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:31,540
in these closing verses of scripture.

657
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:33,619
In verse number 18, a familiar verse,

658
00:35:33,619 --> 00:35:35,980
the Bible says in everything give thanks

659
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:40,080
for this is the will of God and Christ Jesus concerning you.

660
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,700
Why would I use this verse of scripture

661
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:45,279
in connection with this spirit of complaining

662
00:35:45,279 --> 00:35:47,440
and this tendency to complain,

663
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,119
the tragedy that is associated with complaining

664
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:52,559
and how we would have victory over complaining?

665
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:54,480
It's that we change our perspective.

666
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,399
It's that we come to the place where in everything

667
00:35:57,399 --> 00:35:58,480
we give thanks.

668
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,320
Why?

669
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:03,440
For this is the will of God and Christ Jesus concerning you.

670
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:07,540
I have the privilege of fill in the blank.

671
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:12,179
I remember hearing years ago,

672
00:36:12,179 --> 00:36:14,020
it was an account that was given

673
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,660
while I was still in Bible college

674
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:19,420
and I think it was kind of given to us as a primer

675
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:21,640
to help us have the right response

676
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:24,179
if we were to encounter this situation.

677
00:36:24,179 --> 00:36:25,700
But it was a situation in which a young man

678
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:29,339
was interviewing for a ministry position

679
00:36:29,339 --> 00:36:32,420
and this particular pastor that would interview

680
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:35,279
for this position, every time in the midst of the interview,

681
00:36:35,279 --> 00:36:37,300
he would have his secretary call in

682
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:39,779
and tell him that there was an overflowing toilet

683
00:36:39,779 --> 00:36:42,779
in the men's bathroom and they needed immediate assistance

684
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:47,100
just to see how the one being interviewed would respond.

685
00:36:48,899 --> 00:36:49,860
Would they go and help?

686
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,660
Would they not?

687
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:54,619
And it's kind of interesting how we say,

688
00:36:54,619 --> 00:36:56,140
in everything give thanks,

689
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:58,980
for this is the will of God and Christ Jesus concerning you

690
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:02,020
that we can rejoice that God's given us the opportunity.

691
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:04,420
As I mentioned, we complain about the gas prices

692
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:06,260
but God's provided for us.

693
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,420
Thank you, Lord.

694
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:12,059
Well, I got to dip into my savings.

695
00:37:12,059 --> 00:37:14,500
I heard somebody say that when I was in Tennessee.

696
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:19,500
It was no one of you, nobody that I even knew.

697
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,260
Ah, I got to dip into my savings.

698
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:23,779
Hey, what about being thankful you have a savings?

699
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:27,660
That God provided for you in abundance

700
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:32,020
at some time previous so that you could have a savings.

701
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:35,559
Right, it's a change of perspective is really what it is.

702
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:40,399
You think about Joseph in Egypt.

703
00:37:40,399 --> 00:37:42,880
There were seven years of plenty.

704
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,679
If God had not graciously given that dream to Pharaoh

705
00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:50,640
and God had not enabled Joseph to interpret that dream,

706
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,399
what do you think the Egyptians would have done

707
00:37:52,399 --> 00:37:54,000
for those seven years of plenty?

708
00:37:54,959 --> 00:37:56,600
They would have feasted.

709
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,520
And then what would have happened

710
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,360
in the seven years of famine?

711
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,200
They would have died.

712
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,920
It wouldn't have lasted seven years, right?

713
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,720
Because they wouldn't have had enough.

714
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:10,880
And so God provides graciously.

715
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,279
And as he provides, we see that his provision

716
00:38:14,279 --> 00:38:15,279
sometimes is immediate.

717
00:38:15,279 --> 00:38:18,000
Sometimes his provision was years ago

718
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,200
on allowing us to be in the position

719
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:24,080
where we can handle what God has allowed to happen.

720
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:26,600
I understand there's all reasons.

721
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,279
Listen, everybody wants to point fingers

722
00:38:28,279 --> 00:38:30,239
about gas prices today.

723
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:31,839
Everybody.

724
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:32,660
Point fingers.

725
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:33,500
It's this person's fault.

726
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,859
This thing, blah, blah, blah, right?

727
00:38:35,859 --> 00:38:39,660
And oh, it's easy for us to get caught into the trap.

728
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:41,619
Right?

729
00:38:42,619 --> 00:38:45,260
I use that because it's just so prevalent right now.

730
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:49,739
They got little stickers on gas pumps all over the place

731
00:38:49,739 --> 00:38:50,820
that you go to pump gas.

732
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:53,119
I mean, it's just, it's crazy what's going on.

733
00:38:54,419 --> 00:38:58,020
And if we're not careful, we can fall into the same trap.

734
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:00,900
And so how do we triumph over complaining?

735
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:04,500
It's possible because God said, let all things be done.

736
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:08,660
Do all things without murmurings and disputings.

737
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:10,539
So if he's given me a command,

738
00:39:10,539 --> 00:39:15,539
he also will enable me to meet that, to keep that command.

739
00:39:15,739 --> 00:39:17,299
And it's that change of perspective

740
00:39:17,299 --> 00:39:20,059
that God is good all the time.

741
00:39:21,479 --> 00:39:22,979
All the time, God is good.

742
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:26,059
We find ourselves in this situation

743
00:39:26,059 --> 00:39:27,820
as we sing about the goodness of God.

744
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:30,059
And it was really sweet this morning in Sunday school

745
00:39:30,059 --> 00:39:32,020
singing that song, God is so good.

746
00:39:32,979 --> 00:39:35,260
And I could just hear the voice of the people.

747
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:37,500
I mean, I believe we believe it.

748
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,419
God is good.

749
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:42,520
God was good to the children of Israel, was he not?

750
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:45,380
It didn't stop them from complaining though.

751
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:48,419
They complained about the very provision of God Almighty.

752
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:51,780
They complained about the very direction of God Almighty.

753
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:54,220
They complained about what God had provided for them

754
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:56,059
and how God had directed them.

755
00:39:56,059 --> 00:39:57,099
Instead of rejoicing,

756
00:39:57,099 --> 00:39:59,940
instead of expecting that God would work great,

757
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:05,880
There's a pastor friend that I know, when you chat with him as soon as you, you know,

758
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:10,180
some people have these interesting responses when you say, hey, how are you?

759
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:13,180
You see somebody, you talk to them on the phone, you see them in person, you shake their

760
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:15,300
hand and ask how they're doing.

761
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,640
For Mr. Don, it's absolutely wonderful.

762
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,900
Most of us have gotten to the point where we've understood that and we've heard that.

763
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:25,020
We have some people, thankfully none that are part of our congregation, at least not

764
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:29,300
that I've heard that I've experienced in the past that say, well, under the circumstances,

765
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:33,260
you know, it's kind of that Eeyore personality of, oh, bother, right?

766
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:38,140
Things are just kind of, and, you know, you see these different people, some people say

767
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:39,140
this, how are you?

768
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:40,140
Hey, I'm better than I deserve.

769
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:42,380
You ever heard somebody say that?

770
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:46,960
I've heard people say, I like that response, I'm better than I deserve.

771
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:51,020
This pastor friend of mine, as you chat with him, he'll say this, when you ask him how

772
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:54,540
he's doing, he'll say, if I complained, I'd be lying.

773
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:56,940
That's what he says.

774
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:57,940
It's kind of catchy.

775
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:00,740
It's kind of like thought provoking.

776
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:05,860
I've never heard anyone say that before when I've greeted them, but when I greet him, he'll

777
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:09,300
say, well, brother man, if I'd complain, I'd be lying.

778
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,779
That's what he says.

779
00:41:11,779 --> 00:41:14,420
You know what he means by that?

780
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:15,420
God is good.

781
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:22,620
And so if I complain, I'm lying, because I'm saying that God isn't good.

782
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:29,139
Because whatever I'm complaining about, ultimately, my charge is against God.

783
00:41:29,139 --> 00:41:35,660
How many times did the children of Israel complain toward Moses and toward Aaron?

784
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:38,700
But who really was their complaint directed at?

785
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:41,700
It was directed at God.

786
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,860
I mean, think about Moses just for a moment.

787
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,020
And I'm going to close with this.

788
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:48,819
Jim, I'm going to mess you up, because I'm going to come down here, and he's got to move

789
00:41:48,819 --> 00:41:51,980
the camera all around.

790
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:54,540
But I want you to think about Moses.

791
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:57,580
The people come to Moses and say, you led us here.

792
00:41:57,580 --> 00:42:00,620
Moses is like, you don't see the pillar?

793
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:05,959
What do you mean, I led you here?

794
00:42:05,959 --> 00:42:07,100
Do you not see the pillar?

795
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:11,100
We were following the pillar, right?

796
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:12,300
But who are the people complaining against?

797
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:13,860
Well, they want to complain about Moses.

798
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:14,860
Why?

799
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:16,699
They don't really want to complain.

800
00:42:16,699 --> 00:42:19,100
Now, sometimes they did complain directly about God.

801
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:25,380
But typically, we want to complain about someone human, not about God.

802
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:31,540
But the reality is that if God had provided the human leader, Moses, and had provided

803
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:39,740
the direction, then as they complained about Moses, really, their complaint was about God.

804
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:43,540
Do we believe that God is sovereign?

805
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:45,940
He is.

806
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:47,699
We believe He's in control.

807
00:42:47,699 --> 00:42:50,100
He's sitting on His throne.

808
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:53,180
He knows exactly what's going on in the world today.

809
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:55,500
He's not surprised by anything that's going on in the world today.

810
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:56,500
We believe all that, right?

811
00:42:56,500 --> 00:43:01,740
So when we begin to complain about what's taking place, who ultimately are we complaining

812
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:02,740
about?

813
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:03,740
God.

814
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:06,059
When we complain, I almost hit that cello.

815
00:43:06,059 --> 00:43:08,580
That would have been a big mistake.

816
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:09,580
Is that yours?

817
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:11,900
That would have been a really big mistake.

818
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:14,260
Steve, I'd just say, sorry.

819
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:18,260
I've got to live with Brianna.

820
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:19,260
Amen.

821
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:22,339
That just messed me all up.

822
00:43:22,339 --> 00:43:26,660
But the reality is that when we complain, we're complaining about God.

823
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:30,460
We come to the place where we say, you know what?

824
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:35,339
I want to have victory in this area of my life.

825
00:43:35,339 --> 00:43:41,220
I know there's a tendency on the part of us as human beings to complain.

826
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:48,180
If we're not careful and if we don't guard against it, every single one of us can fall

827
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:50,180
prey to complaining.

828
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:51,559
We really can.

829
00:43:51,559 --> 00:43:58,419
We can just come to the place where we just get into that rut, complain about this and

830
00:43:58,419 --> 00:44:00,860
complain about that.

831
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:08,979
We see it in our society, but it ought not be amongst the people of God.

832
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:10,460
Amen?

833
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:12,419
It ought not be amongst the people of God.

834
00:44:12,419 --> 00:44:13,419
Why?

835
00:44:13,419 --> 00:44:16,420
Because our God is good all of the time.

836
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:20,059
Before I almost ran into the cello, I was going to go to the book of Daniel.

837
00:44:20,059 --> 00:44:25,500
I won't take time to do it at this point, but you think about the truth that God gives

838
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:33,220
in the book of Daniel with regard to God being in control of the affairs of mankind.

839
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:35,700
We complain about our government leadership.

840
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:41,899
Listen, those people are only in place because God's allowed them to be in place.

841
00:44:41,899 --> 00:44:42,899
I've said this before.

842
00:44:42,899 --> 00:44:47,660
In fact, just a few weeks ago, I said as we preached on the subject of prayer, what place

843
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:50,179
does prayer have in our lives?

844
00:44:50,179 --> 00:44:54,459
God said that we're to pray for those in leadership.

845
00:44:54,459 --> 00:44:59,220
We're to pray for those that are in authority.

846
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:02,980
It's easier to complain about them, right?

847
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:03,980
You got a bad boss.

848
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:08,739
It's easier to complain about them than to pray for them.

849
00:45:08,739 --> 00:45:14,660
And this morning, when the people complained, it displeased the Lord.

850
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:20,739
He heard them, and His anger was kindled against them.

851
00:45:20,739 --> 00:45:26,220
It's tragic, but I'm thankful this morning that we can triumph.

852
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:32,540
We can be victorious over this matter of complaining, and oh, that God would help us.

853
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:33,540
Let's pray together.

854
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:37,260
We thank You for the Word of God.

855
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:43,260
We thank You for the truth, and we thank You for how You've provided these Old Testament

856
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:58,140
records and samples, as Paul said to the believers in Corinth, for our admonition, for our instruction,

857
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:05,100
that we would learn, even from this particular message this morning, that which would displease

858
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:06,100
You.

859
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:13,179
And Lord, I pray that as we would take a few moments this morning to honestly evaluate

860
00:46:13,179 --> 00:46:21,860
our lives, that as we would take the time to let a man examine himself, that it's easy

861
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:24,339
for us to criticize those that complain.

862
00:46:24,339 --> 00:46:30,980
It's easy for us to criticize the children of Israel for their complaining, but far too

863
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:36,380
often we imitate their behavior.

864
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:46,779
For all that You've done for us, for how good You've been to us, how sad that we would complain.

865
00:46:46,779 --> 00:46:55,540
I pray that You'd help us as we evaluate our own lives personally to be honest.

866
00:46:55,540 --> 00:47:03,940
God that we'd be able to identify if there's that tendency in our lives, that we'd run

867
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:11,179
to You seeking Your help so that we might triumph over it, that we would not get caught

868
00:47:11,179 --> 00:47:26,420
up in these complaining sessions, these workplace, church house, wherever it might be, but God

869
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:33,980
we'd look to You and see how good You are and how good You've been, that we'd do all

870
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:37,299
things without murmurings.

871
00:47:37,299 --> 00:47:42,299
Would You move and work as only You can, help us Lord to be honest with You, to be

872
00:47:42,299 --> 00:47:44,820
doers of the Word, we'll thank You for it.

873
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:45,820
Would You stand with me?

874
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:48,700
Heads are out, eyes are closed.

875
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:52,100
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano.

876
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:54,660
As she does, the altar's open.

877
00:47:54,660 --> 00:48:00,899
Maybe for someone there's confession that needs to take place, there's been complaining

878
00:48:00,899 --> 00:48:03,959
and you want to just come get it right with God.

879
00:48:03,959 --> 00:48:08,119
Maybe for someone this morning there's a recognition of that tendency and you want

880
00:48:08,119 --> 00:48:12,399
God to help you so that you can triumph and you maybe need to visit this altar this morning

881
00:48:12,399 --> 00:48:19,119
and ask God to just protect you and help you to prevent you from falling into that complaining

882
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:21,279
spirit.

883
00:48:21,279 --> 00:48:24,000
Maybe God's spoken to your heart in some other way.

884
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,799
Maybe you just want to come and thank Him this morning.

885
00:48:26,799 --> 00:48:28,760
But as Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
