WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.960
And as you're turning there, let me remind you to continue to pray for the Beacon of

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:13.079
Truth Ministries and got some opportunities for a number of Bibles and we're thankful

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:16.479
for the opportunity to assemble the scriptures here, but very exciting about what's going

00:00:16.479 --> 00:00:17.479
on.

00:00:17.479 --> 00:00:21.959
They have a deadline of getting those Samoan Bibles done and ready for shipment by October.

00:00:21.959 --> 00:00:25.280
And so if you'd pray with them about that, I know they'd greatly appreciate that.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:30.000
First chapter number 11 and that this portion of scripture, just looking at a few verses

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.959
this morning from numbers 11, but let me remind you that one of the characteristics that God

00:00:34.959 --> 00:00:41.700
gives us in 2 Timothy chapter number three of the last days is that people will be unthankful.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.000
And it's very interesting as you think about the lack of gratitude that is prevalent in

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.200
our society today.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:52.400
I believe that really it doesn't take us long to just look around and listen to some things,

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:59.840
interact with some people, and we find in our society that there is a prevalent spirit

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.000
of lacking thankfulness, of discontent.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.959
And we see it in all sorts of spheres of our society today.

00:01:08.959 --> 00:01:14.879
And the reality is that oftentimes as we look at all that's taking place, I believe that

00:01:14.879 --> 00:01:20.480
as the people of God, the attitude of discontent, the lack of thanksgiving really should alarm

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.480
us.

00:01:21.559 --> 00:01:25.839
It should cause us to be greatly concerned and we should really put up guards that we

00:01:25.839 --> 00:01:27.720
are not influenced by it.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.000
We'll get into the message this morning and I'll make a statement that I'll make now as

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.839
well that to complain is contagious.

00:01:35.839 --> 00:01:41.000
And really there's a spirit of complaining that as you live in our society and you see

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.720
these things that are happening, that it's very easy to join in and to begin to participate

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.440
in that same level of behavior.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.000
It is often said, and you would think of the truth of the nation of Israel, we'll look

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
at this passage of Scripture this morning and a number of others here in the Old Testament,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.440
when you think about the children of Israel, often we are quick to criticize them for their

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.440
complaining.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.039
We read of their murmuring and their complaining all throughout the Old Testament.

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.759
It's very easy for us to quickly criticize them for it, but it's been often observed

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:18.839
that if we're not careful, we too will imitate that behavior that we criticize.

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:24.479
And how careful we must be, I think of this when I think about this spirit of discontent,

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:29.639
this lack of thankfulness in our society today, that oftentimes it is manifested through a

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:32.000
complaining spirit.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.960
You interact with people just as I do and you know that it's very easy to be able to

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:42.880
begin a conversation with someone and to immediately begin to hear of complaints.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.720
And that's amazing as to what we as human beings are able to complain about.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.279
In fact, I've often thought if we'd put as much effort into finding things to rejoice

00:02:52.279 --> 00:02:58.639
in, it'd certainly be a blessing because it seems as if sometimes it's very much effort

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:04.039
that is put into the idea of complaining and looking for things to complain about.

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:10.679
Notice in Numbers chapter 11, the Bible says this, and when the people complained, it displeased

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:11.679
the Lord.

00:03:11.679 --> 00:03:18.639
And the Lord heard it, and His anger was kindled, and the fire of the Lord burnt among them

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:22.600
and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the camp.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:28.679
Verse 2, the people cried unto Moses, and when Moses prayed unto the Lord, the fire

00:03:28.679 --> 00:03:29.800
was quenched.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:36.720
And he called the name of the place Tiberia because the fire of the Lord burnt among them.

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:42.399
I'm thankful that as Moses prayed that the fire was quenched, our God is gracious.

00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:43.399
He's merciful.

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:46.800
He's full of compassion, and for that we ought to rejoice.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:52.520
But you look at the first verse of Numbers 11, and we'll use it as our title this morning,

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.080
when the people complained.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:01.039
The word complain means to utter expressions of censure or resentment, to murmur, to find

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:02.039
fault.

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:06.559
And if you look at this, and I think it's a wise observation, that fault is the easiest

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:09.119
thing in the world to find.

00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:10.380
Think about that.

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:15.919
And so often it's easy for us to find fault with the society in which we live and all

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:21.239
sorts of things that we encounter, and we find here as we look at this passage of Scripture

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.880
that there's rich truth for us to glean from that I believe God will help us.

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.799
If you're taking notes this morning, notice number one, the tendency to complain.

00:04:30.799 --> 00:04:32.399
The tendency to complain.

00:04:32.399 --> 00:04:37.519
As you trace the steps of the children of Israel, you will find over and over the murmuring

00:04:37.519 --> 00:04:43.399
and the complaining that is so prevalent amongst the children of Israel, the people of God,

00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:46.760
there is a tendency on their part to complain.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:52.640
I believe that it's a human tendency for us to complain, and we find that it's easy to

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.519
complain about things, and it's easy to get into the spirit of complaint, and we find

00:04:57.519 --> 00:05:01.600
that their tendency, the tendency of the children of Israel is well documented in the

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.959
Old Testament.

00:05:02.959 --> 00:05:08.399
Notice if you will, go back to the book of Exodus in chapter number 14, and we read in

00:05:08.399 --> 00:05:13.799
Exodus chapter number 14 of just great might and great power and how God demonstrated this

00:05:13.799 --> 00:05:18.920
power in drying up the Red Sea, and you think about the miracle of the crossing of the Red

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:23.119
Sea, and you think about what the people as they feared, and it tells us in verse number

00:05:23.119 --> 00:05:27.720
10 that when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and behold,

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.000
the Egyptians marched after them, and they were sore afraid, and the children of Israel

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.279
cried unto the Lord, and they were fearful for their very existence, and Moses speaks

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:43.359
to them, and the Lord speaks, and Moses says, the Lord shall fight for you in verse number

00:05:43.359 --> 00:05:49.320
14, and ye shall hold your peace, and God says in verse number 15 that Moses is to speak

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:55.559
unto the children of Israel that they go forward, that they will see the salvation

00:05:55.559 --> 00:06:01.559
of the Lord, and you know the account and what a record it is in Exodus 14 to see how

00:06:01.559 --> 00:06:07.079
the Lord allowed for the children of Israel to cross over on dry ground, and God destroyed

00:06:07.079 --> 00:06:13.079
the Egyptians who assayed to go in after them, and God worked miraculously, and after they

00:06:13.119 --> 00:06:19.559
had crossed, and after God had allowed the Egyptians to drive heavily their wagons there,

00:06:19.559 --> 00:06:24.040
their chariots, we find that God closed up the Red Sea, and He destroyed the children

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:30.160
of Israel, and it was reason to rejoice, and in Exodus chapter 15 you see the song of deliverance,

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:36.239
you see the rejoicing, they say this in verse number 1 of Exodus 15, then sang Moses and

00:06:36.239 --> 00:06:41.440
the children of Israel this song unto the Lord, and spake, saying, I will sing unto

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:42.440
the Lord.

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:43.440
Why?

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.640
For he hath triumphed gloriously.

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.679
The horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.

00:06:48.679 --> 00:06:55.239
Notice in verse 13, thou in thy mercy hath led forth the people which thou hast redeemed.

00:06:55.239 --> 00:07:00.239
Thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation.

00:07:00.239 --> 00:07:03.239
Verse 18, the Lord shall reign forever and ever.

00:07:03.239 --> 00:07:07.200
I mean, they're rejoicing, and rightly so.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.200
God had worked miraculously.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:15.839
It's amazing, on the heels of seeing such miraculous deliverance, on the very heels

00:07:15.839 --> 00:07:22.279
of singing such a wonderful song of deliverance, the Bible tells us in verse number 22, so

00:07:22.279 --> 00:07:27.200
Moses brought Israel from the Red Sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur,

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:32.959
and they were three days, they went three days in the wilderness and found no water.

00:07:32.959 --> 00:07:39.920
So just a few days after seeing the miraculous, powerful hand of God Almighty, after singing

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:46.320
his triumphs and singing his praises and singing how the Lord shall reign forever and ever,

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:51.600
and God led them, we understand, by the pillar of cloud by day, the pillar of fire by night,

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:55.839
and they come to a place, and the Bible tells us that they find no water, and they came

00:07:55.839 --> 00:07:59.399
to Marah in verse 23, and they could not drink of the waters.

00:07:59.399 --> 00:08:00.399
Why?

00:08:00.399 --> 00:08:05.519
Because they were bitter, and notice it says in verse 24, and the people murmured against

00:08:05.519 --> 00:08:06.519
Moses.

00:08:06.519 --> 00:08:12.119
It didn't take long for these nation of Israel, these people of God to begin to murmur and

00:08:12.119 --> 00:08:13.839
complain about what?

00:08:13.839 --> 00:08:19.079
About their circumstances, about their situations, about the things that they were facing.

00:08:19.079 --> 00:08:22.440
The reality is that God knows that they needed water.

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:23.519
Amen?

00:08:23.519 --> 00:08:24.839
God knows what our needs are.

00:08:24.839 --> 00:08:29.679
He knows where we need to be, and God, he doeth all things well.

00:08:29.679 --> 00:08:32.880
He led them exactly to where they were supposed to be.

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:37.520
We find that they find themselves here in this portion of Scripture where they're murmuring

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:42.780
against Moses, and they say, what shall we drink?

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:46.840
Notice in verse 25 that he cried unto the Lord Moses, and the Lord showed him a tree,

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:50.880
and he cast it into the waters, and the waters were made sweet, and he made for them a statute

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:56.520
and ordinance, and there he proved them, and what a great truth of seeing the power of

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:57.520
God.

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:01.059
Now, I want you to think about the experience of the children of Israel, their tendency

00:09:01.059 --> 00:09:02.119
to complain.

00:09:02.119 --> 00:09:04.260
They would see God work miraculously.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.159
They would see God provide for them.

00:09:06.159 --> 00:09:11.979
They would see God prove them, and he would prove himself and his power, and yet they

00:09:11.979 --> 00:09:13.760
would face another obstacle.

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:18.700
They would face a circumstance, a situation that perhaps we would describe as being less

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:23.500
than desirable, and immediately, what would their default setting be?

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:26.479
It would be this tendency to complain.

00:09:26.479 --> 00:09:28.559
It was like a default setting.

00:09:28.559 --> 00:09:32.359
In verse number, excuse me, in chapter number 16, you find the Bible tells us that they

00:09:32.359 --> 00:09:37.979
took their journey from Elam, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came

00:09:37.979 --> 00:09:42.840
unto the wilderness of Sin, and it says, which is between Elam and Sinai, on the fifteenth

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:46.400
day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:50.799
So I want you to consider with me that it's only the two and a half months after they'd

00:09:50.799 --> 00:09:55.960
seen God work miraculously and deliver them, and think about all of the wonders that they

00:09:55.960 --> 00:10:00.039
saw in the plagues in Egypt, and then delivering.

00:10:00.039 --> 00:10:03.719
and the crossing of the Red Sea, and then the waters healed at Marah.

00:10:03.719 --> 00:10:07.319
And the Bible tells us here in Exodus chapter number 16

00:10:07.319 --> 00:10:10.439
that they go through and they are complaining again.

00:10:10.439 --> 00:10:11.639
In verse number 3, it says,

00:10:11.639 --> 00:10:13.079
"...the children of Israel said unto them,

00:10:14.039 --> 00:10:17.879
Would to God we had died by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt,

00:10:17.879 --> 00:10:21.239
when we sat by the flesh pots, and when we did eat bread to the full.

00:10:21.239 --> 00:10:22.279
Notice what they said,

00:10:22.279 --> 00:10:24.759
For ye have brought us forth into this wilderness

00:10:24.759 --> 00:10:28.279
to kill this whole assembly with hunger."

00:10:28.839 --> 00:10:32.119
Notice what the Lord said unto Moses in verse number 4.

00:10:32.119 --> 00:10:32.519
He said,

00:10:32.519 --> 00:10:35.239
"...I will rain bread from heaven for you,

00:10:35.799 --> 00:10:38.999
and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day,

00:10:38.999 --> 00:10:43.159
that I may prove them whether they will walk in my law or no."

00:10:43.159 --> 00:10:46.439
I want you to think about the next 40 years,

00:10:46.439 --> 00:10:49.879
how the children of Israel would receive this bread daily.

00:10:50.679 --> 00:10:54.439
And God miraculously provided day by day.

00:10:54.439 --> 00:10:56.359
Of course, we understand that on the Sabbath,

00:10:56.359 --> 00:10:58.999
He would not send the manna for on the sixth day.

00:10:58.999 --> 00:11:00.679
They were to gather twice as much.

00:11:00.679 --> 00:11:04.679
And He here in Exodus chapter number 16 provides all of the details

00:11:04.679 --> 00:11:08.359
and how He was going to prove His people,

00:11:08.359 --> 00:11:10.359
and He was going to prove His power.

00:11:10.359 --> 00:11:12.759
And we find that the children of Israel, however,

00:11:13.319 --> 00:11:16.519
they were murmuring against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness,

00:11:16.519 --> 00:11:18.199
according to verse number 2.

00:11:18.199 --> 00:11:19.239
And they say,

00:11:19.239 --> 00:11:22.519
"...it would have been better for us to have died in Egypt."

00:11:23.079 --> 00:11:26.039
Certainly, for a people that had experienced

00:11:26.039 --> 00:11:28.759
what they had experienced up to this point in their lives,

00:11:29.639 --> 00:11:32.439
the default setting should no longer be complaining.

00:11:33.559 --> 00:11:34.059
Amen?

00:11:34.839 --> 00:11:39.319
The default setting could be a wonder how God is going to work.

00:11:39.319 --> 00:11:41.719
What is God going to do in this situation?

00:11:41.719 --> 00:11:43.479
Let us seek the face of God.

00:11:43.479 --> 00:11:46.439
Let us praise God for the place in which He's brought us,

00:11:46.439 --> 00:11:50.599
and let us look to Him for how He will provide for us.

00:11:50.919 --> 00:11:52.359
But no, the people murmur.

00:11:53.879 --> 00:11:56.039
They murmur against Moses and against Aaron.

00:11:56.839 --> 00:11:58.759
God proves them in chapter 16.

00:11:58.759 --> 00:12:01.479
We read about the manna.

00:12:01.479 --> 00:12:04.359
It tells us in verse number 35 of Exodus 16,

00:12:04.359 --> 00:12:06.599
that the children of Israel did eat manna 40 years

00:12:07.479 --> 00:12:09.799
until they came to a land inhabited.

00:12:09.799 --> 00:12:13.319
They did eat manna until they came into the borders of the land of Canaan.

00:12:14.759 --> 00:12:18.839
And then we enter into the 17th chapter of the book of Exodus,

00:12:19.719 --> 00:12:20.599
the book of Exodus.

00:12:20.599 --> 00:12:23.319
We're speaking this morning of the tendency to complain

00:12:23.319 --> 00:12:27.079
and how the tendency of the children of Israel is well-documented.

00:12:28.679 --> 00:12:31.079
In chapter 17 of verse number 1, it says,

00:12:31.079 --> 00:12:33.239
and all the congregation of the children of Israel

00:12:33.239 --> 00:12:36.519
journeyed from the wilderness of sin after their journeys

00:12:36.519 --> 00:12:38.119
according to the commandment of the Lord,

00:12:39.639 --> 00:12:40.839
and pitched in Rephidim,

00:12:40.839 --> 00:12:42.759
and there was no water for the people to drink.

00:12:43.879 --> 00:12:46.119
So, the Bible tells us that they were in that place

00:12:46.119 --> 00:12:48.599
according to the commandment of the Lord in verse number 1.

00:12:49.559 --> 00:12:51.559
The Bible tells us of their circumstances

00:12:51.559 --> 00:12:52.839
that there's no water to drink,

00:12:52.839 --> 00:12:54.679
and it tells us in verse number 2

00:12:54.679 --> 00:12:56.839
that the people did chide with Moses.

00:12:56.839 --> 00:12:58.359
If you look at verse number 3,

00:12:58.359 --> 00:13:00.439
it's the people thirsted there for water

00:13:00.439 --> 00:13:02.679
and the people murmured against Moses.

00:13:04.039 --> 00:13:06.999
We read of this tendency of the children of Israel

00:13:06.999 --> 00:13:10.279
and we read how that as they had barely finished

00:13:10.279 --> 00:13:12.439
seeing God provide miraculously,

00:13:12.439 --> 00:13:14.759
they would complain about their situation

00:13:14.759 --> 00:13:17.399
and then God would graciously provide for them

00:13:17.399 --> 00:13:19.079
and he would prove his power,

00:13:19.079 --> 00:13:21.239
and yet they would face another difficulty

00:13:21.239 --> 00:13:24.359
and they would complain, the tendency of complaining.

00:13:25.319 --> 00:13:27.879
Turn over to the book of Numbers

00:13:27.879 --> 00:13:30.199
where we are here this morning in chapter number 11,

00:13:30.199 --> 00:13:34.359
and really much of the remainder of the book of Exodus

00:13:34.359 --> 00:13:38.119
would communicate for us the 10 commandments,

00:13:38.119 --> 00:13:40.359
the requirements and the instructions

00:13:40.359 --> 00:13:42.999
with regard to the tabernacle and all of those things.

00:13:42.999 --> 00:13:44.759
And of course, the book of Leviticus

00:13:44.759 --> 00:13:47.799
providing for us much detail with regard to the law.

00:13:47.799 --> 00:13:49.479
And we come here and really kind of pick up

00:13:49.479 --> 00:13:52.599
the journey of the children of Israel in Numbers 11.

00:13:52.599 --> 00:13:53.799
You find that the Bible says,

00:13:53.799 --> 00:13:55.639
and when the people complained,

00:13:56.279 --> 00:13:57.319
it was a default setting,

00:13:57.319 --> 00:13:59.559
it was a tendency for the children of Israel.

00:14:00.199 --> 00:14:02.199
And it's a tendency in our human nature,

00:14:02.199 --> 00:14:03.239
and we must be careful,

00:14:03.239 --> 00:14:06.839
we must guard against this tendency of complaining.

00:14:06.839 --> 00:14:09.319
I would say that, as I mentioned by way of introduction,

00:14:09.319 --> 00:14:10.919
that complaining is contagious.

00:14:11.799 --> 00:14:13.079
You get around at the workplace

00:14:13.079 --> 00:14:15.639
and you begin to complain about the job,

00:14:15.639 --> 00:14:18.279
you begin to complain about the supervisor,

00:14:18.279 --> 00:14:20.039
you begin to complain about the requirements

00:14:20.039 --> 00:14:22.039
and the responsibility and the lack of pay,

00:14:22.039 --> 00:14:23.639
and there's no this and there's no that.

00:14:23.639 --> 00:14:24.279
And guess what?

00:14:24.279 --> 00:14:26.599
Before long, you got a whole crowd that wants to chime in

00:14:26.599 --> 00:14:29.639
and wants to join in and sing the complaints

00:14:30.199 --> 00:14:32.439
about the circumstances, right?

00:14:33.399 --> 00:14:34.759
We see it in the job place.

00:14:34.759 --> 00:14:36.279
I worked in the corporate world for years.

00:14:36.279 --> 00:14:37.159
I know how it works.

00:14:38.599 --> 00:14:40.039
Complain about gas prices.

00:14:40.759 --> 00:14:42.199
You hear that complaint recently?

00:14:43.559 --> 00:14:44.059
Right?

00:14:44.759 --> 00:14:46.359
It's all over the place, right?

00:14:46.359 --> 00:14:49.319
Complaining about gas prices, right?

00:14:49.319 --> 00:14:51.719
Complaining about I had to dip into my savings,

00:14:51.719 --> 00:14:53.799
I had to take out whatever.

00:14:53.799 --> 00:14:55.239
I was talking to the kids and I said,

00:14:55.239 --> 00:14:56.279
you know, I said,

00:14:56.279 --> 00:14:57.399
one of the things that's interesting

00:14:57.399 --> 00:14:59.159
is if we change our perspective,

00:14:59.159 --> 00:15:01.159
maybe instead of complaining about the gas prices,

00:15:01.159 --> 00:15:03.879
we can rejoice that God provided for us in advance

00:15:03.879 --> 00:15:05.239
so that we could pay for the gas.

00:15:06.199 --> 00:15:09.639
It's just a change of perspective, right?

00:15:09.639 --> 00:15:10.839
What we sang this morning,

00:15:10.839 --> 00:15:12.999
God is so good.

00:15:13.879 --> 00:15:16.359
Is he good even if the gas prices go through the roof?

00:15:16.999 --> 00:15:17.719
Sure he is.

00:15:18.439 --> 00:15:20.599
Is he good if the boss requires you to do more

00:15:20.599 --> 00:15:21.399
than you think that?

00:15:21.399 --> 00:15:22.199
Yes, he is.

00:15:23.559 --> 00:15:24.439
He's good.

00:15:25.799 --> 00:15:26.519
He's good.

00:15:27.319 --> 00:15:29.639
And so often we find in our society

00:15:29.639 --> 00:15:32.119
that there's this tendency to complain

00:15:32.119 --> 00:15:33.479
and it's contagious.

00:15:33.479 --> 00:15:35.239
It's something that impacts us.

00:15:35.239 --> 00:15:37.079
We see people complaining in their homes.

00:15:37.079 --> 00:15:39.879
We see people complaining about their spouses.

00:15:39.879 --> 00:15:41.719
We see people complaining about their children.

00:15:41.719 --> 00:15:43.799
We see children complaining about their parents.

00:15:43.799 --> 00:15:46.599
And I mean, the list just goes on and on and on.

00:15:48.119 --> 00:15:51.399
And lest we fool ourselves this morning,

00:15:51.399 --> 00:15:52.919
we must acknowledge this morning

00:15:52.919 --> 00:15:54.999
that there's a tendency to complain still today,

00:15:54.999 --> 00:15:56.359
even amongst the people of God,

00:15:58.039 --> 00:15:59.079
in the house of God.

00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:00.439
Amen.

00:16:01.159 --> 00:16:01.799
It happens.

00:16:02.359 --> 00:16:03.959
There's a tendency to complain.

00:16:04.839 --> 00:16:07.639
I remember when we lived out in Nevada,

00:16:08.199 --> 00:16:11.799
hearing a story of a situation with a preacher

00:16:11.799 --> 00:16:13.399
that was out in that area.

00:16:13.399 --> 00:16:14.999
And if you've been out to the northwest part

00:16:14.999 --> 00:16:15.799
of the United States,

00:16:15.799 --> 00:16:18.439
you'll find that in a number of those states

00:16:18.439 --> 00:16:21.319
in Nevada and up into Idaho

00:16:21.319 --> 00:16:25.799
and some of the other parts of that area of the country,

00:16:25.799 --> 00:16:29.319
you'll find that there are few and far of churches,

00:16:29.319 --> 00:16:30.839
Bible-believing churches.

00:16:31.799 --> 00:16:34.519
The town that we lived in in Nevada,

00:16:34.519 --> 00:16:38.359
if we wanted to go to a church like our church today,

00:16:38.359 --> 00:16:41.639
we would have had to have driven about 120 miles one way.

00:16:45.879 --> 00:16:46.679
It's crazy.

00:16:47.799 --> 00:16:50.279
And I heard a man make the statement

00:16:50.279 --> 00:16:53.399
about a man that was complaining about his church.

00:16:54.679 --> 00:16:56.119
And he said, you know, you ought to be thankful

00:16:56.119 --> 00:16:56.999
you have a church.

00:16:58.199 --> 00:16:59.319
Because I live in a place,

00:16:59.319 --> 00:17:00.679
and he noted where he lived,

00:17:00.679 --> 00:17:02.839
and he said, I can't hear preaching

00:17:03.479 --> 00:17:05.079
that's solid to the Word of God.

00:17:05.799 --> 00:17:07.879
I can't be in a place

00:17:07.879 --> 00:17:09.639
where we can fellowship with believers

00:17:09.639 --> 00:17:11.959
because there's just no church.

00:17:13.479 --> 00:17:15.959
I have to listen to, back then when I heard this,

00:17:15.959 --> 00:17:17.959
they listened to the church on the radio.

00:17:18.759 --> 00:17:20.359
He said, if I want to hear good preaching,

00:17:20.359 --> 00:17:21.879
I have to listen to the radio.

00:17:22.999 --> 00:17:25.639
He said, so before you complain again about your church,

00:17:25.639 --> 00:17:27.559
I want you to consider some things.

00:17:27.559 --> 00:17:30.039
Man, that was impactful to me as a young person.

00:17:30.759 --> 00:17:32.999
And thinking about the tendency,

00:17:32.999 --> 00:17:34.359
listen, it's easy to complain.

00:17:34.359 --> 00:17:35.559
I mentioned by way of introduction

00:17:35.559 --> 00:17:37.399
that somebody made the observation

00:17:37.399 --> 00:17:39.399
that finding fault is one of the easiest things

00:17:39.399 --> 00:17:40.359
to find in the world.

00:17:40.919 --> 00:17:41.559
Isn't it true?

00:17:42.119 --> 00:17:44.039
Man, we can have a wonderful meal,

00:17:44.039 --> 00:17:46.359
and there could be 95% of the things

00:17:46.359 --> 00:17:47.799
could be just perfect.

00:17:47.799 --> 00:17:48.839
I mean, spot on.

00:17:50.039 --> 00:17:52.599
But we find fault in that one little thing, right?

00:17:52.599 --> 00:17:56.039
It's a tendency of human nature.

00:17:56.039 --> 00:17:57.159
We see the tendency.

00:17:57.159 --> 00:17:59.559
It's well-documented for the children of Israel.

00:17:59.559 --> 00:18:01.399
It's amazing as you look through

00:18:01.399 --> 00:18:03.479
and you begin to see all that happens

00:18:03.479 --> 00:18:06.999
in the testimony of the children of Israel

00:18:06.999 --> 00:18:09.319
and their complaining spirit

00:18:09.319 --> 00:18:12.599
and this tendency of theirs.

00:18:12.599 --> 00:18:14.439
And again, how we criticize them,

00:18:14.439 --> 00:18:15.959
but if we're not careful,

00:18:15.959 --> 00:18:18.919
how we also will come to the place

00:18:18.919 --> 00:18:20.919
where we imitate them.

00:18:21.639 --> 00:18:23.159
We'll get there in just a few minutes,

00:18:23.159 --> 00:18:24.439
but it's interesting how that

00:18:24.439 --> 00:18:26.759
in the 21st chapter of the book of Numbers.

00:18:26.759 --> 00:18:28.519
In fact, why don't you turn over there now?

00:18:28.519 --> 00:18:30.919
I want you to look in Numbers 21.

00:18:30.919 --> 00:18:34.279
I want you to see just the extent

00:18:34.279 --> 00:18:35.799
of this tendency.

00:18:35.799 --> 00:18:38.279
It tells us in verse 4 of Numbers 21,

00:18:38.279 --> 00:18:38.759
it says,

00:18:38.759 --> 00:18:41.559
Now, and they journeyed from Mount Hor

00:18:41.559 --> 00:18:42.759
by the way of the Red Sea

00:18:42.759 --> 00:18:44.519
to compass the land of Edom.

00:18:45.719 --> 00:18:46.440
It says this,

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:47.479
that the soul of the people

00:18:47.479 --> 00:18:49.639
was much discouraged because of the way.

00:18:51.479 --> 00:18:53.479
The people, they spake against God

00:18:53.479 --> 00:18:55.159
and they spake against Moses.

00:18:55.719 --> 00:18:56.519
Here's what they said,

00:18:56.519 --> 00:18:58.519
Wherefore have you brought us up

00:18:58.519 --> 00:19:00.359
out of Egypt to die in the wilderness?

00:19:01.239 --> 00:19:02.199
Notice what they say,

00:19:02.919 --> 00:19:04.039
For there is no bread,

00:19:05.239 --> 00:19:06.839
neither is there any water,

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:11.639
and our soul loatheth this light bread.

00:19:12.919 --> 00:19:14.359
Now in their complaint,

00:19:15.079 --> 00:19:17.159
they were discouraged about the way.

00:19:17.159 --> 00:19:19.880
In their complaint, they said two things.

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:21.399
Number one, there's no bread.

00:19:21.399 --> 00:19:22.759
And number two, there's no water.

00:19:23.559 --> 00:19:25.000
And then their third complaint

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.519
is that our soul hates,

00:19:26.519 --> 00:19:28.759
loatheth this light bread.

00:19:28.759 --> 00:19:29.719
Now they just got done saying

00:19:29.719 --> 00:19:32.039
there was no bread, right?

00:19:32.679 --> 00:19:34.039
And now they're saying

00:19:34.039 --> 00:19:35.479
our soul loatheth,

00:19:35.479 --> 00:19:36.839
hateth this light bread.

00:19:36.839 --> 00:19:37.799
What are they referring to?

00:19:38.679 --> 00:19:39.179
Manna.

00:19:40.119 --> 00:19:43.079
The manna that God graciously

00:19:43.079 --> 00:19:46.279
and miraculously provided for them.

00:19:46.279 --> 00:19:48.519
The manna that rain from heaven

00:19:48.519 --> 00:19:50.519
that we looked at in Exodus 16

00:19:50.519 --> 00:19:51.320
when God said,

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:52.279
I'm going to prove them

00:19:52.279 --> 00:19:53.000
and I'm going to,

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.159
I'm going to rain bread from heaven.

00:19:55.799 --> 00:19:57.320
And the people of God

00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:59.880
are complaining about the.

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:04.520
provision of God, and we can criticize them.

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:11.020
And by the way, it's okay to criticize them, because God wasn't pleased with them.

00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:16.040
And it's not appropriate behavior, but in the very midst of their complaint, it shows

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:17.420
their inconsistency.

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:22.220
It shows that their perspective is wrong.

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:26.320
Notice with me not only the tendency of complaining, but notice the tragedy of complaining.

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:27.880
Go back to Numbers 11, if you will.

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:32.160
I want you to look at the tragedy of complaining.

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:39.520
And honestly, this morning, it is a tragedy when people complain, it really is.

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:45.320
In Numbers 11, the Bible says this in verse number 1, and when the people complained,

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:50.840
notice this, it displeased the Lord.

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:51.840
What is it?

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:54.380
Well, it's their complaining.

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:58.180
It is their complaining that was the reason for God being displeased with them.

00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:04.300
It's interesting, as Paul would deal with this truth for the church in Corinth in 1

00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:07.300
Corinthians chapter number 10, and you don't need to turn there, but I'll reference two

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:12.500
verses of Scripture in 1 Corinthians 10, in verse number 5, God says this, but with many

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:16.020
of them, God was not well pleased.

00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:20.380
In verse number 10, the final example that he uses of the behavior that did not please

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:26.640
the Lord, he says, neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured and were destroyed

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:28.940
of the destroyer.

00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:33.380
The tragedy of complaining, number one, it displeased the Lord.

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:37.260
I don't want to do anything in my life that would displease the Lord.

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:42.500
I didn't say that I never displeased the Lord, I said I don't want to do anything that displeases

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:43.500
the Lord.

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:48.260
And we need to come to that place in our life where we say, I don't want to displease God.

00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:54.460
I don't want to displease my Father, because truly God is good and I don't want to displease

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:55.460
Him.

00:21:55.460 --> 00:22:00.060
And when He tells us of things in His Word specifically that would displease Him, then

00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:02.380
I want to stay far away from that.

00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:04.900
I want to avoid it.

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:08.660
Notice, you continue reading in Numbers 11 and verse number 1, it says, and when the

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:10.559
people complained, it displeased the Lord.

00:22:10.559 --> 00:22:14.779
But notice this, and the Lord heard it.

00:22:14.779 --> 00:22:16.500
The Lord heard it.

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:20.980
You know, God hears everything.

00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:22.980
God hears everything.

00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:27.540
It's kind of interesting because in the New Testament when it talks about complaining

00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:34.260
and murmuring, it kind of has the idea of having something that's just not well-known

00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:38.040
and well-documented, something that's done in secret.

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:39.620
But God knows.

00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:41.100
God hears.

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:46.020
And the Bible tells us that it displeased the Lord, but it says the Lord heard it.

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:51.660
Isn't it so much better for the Lord to hear the praise of His people?

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:53.100
Seriously.

00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:58.460
That He would hear the praise of His people, not the complaints of His people.

00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:06.380
It's not for us to complain and we must recognize the tendency, but it's important that we understand

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:12.220
the tragedy of complaining, that it displeases the Lord, that He hears it.

00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:18.540
And then notice as we continue in verse number 11, it says, and His anger was kindled.

00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:24.419
Oftentimes we see that the complaining of the people of God resulted in severe judgment.

00:23:24.419 --> 00:23:29.360
Here in Numbers 11, the Bible tells us that the fire of the Lord burnt among them and

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:33.980
consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the camp.

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:35.660
The Lord heard their complaining.

00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:37.980
The Lord was displeased with their complaining.

00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:41.380
And the Lord brought judgment because of their complaining.

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:44.419
Now again, I want to steer clear of the judgment of God.

00:23:44.419 --> 00:23:45.860
Amen?

00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:48.139
I want to steer clear of the judgment of God.

00:23:48.139 --> 00:23:53.620
And we find that there are many examples in which God has given us, especially as we look

00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:57.500
in the Old Testament here, with regard to the complaining spirit of the children of

00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:02.139
Israel and their tendency to complain, and the tragedy and the results of the severe

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:03.300
judgment.

00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:08.340
Here in Numbers 11, again in Numbers chapter 16, you see that there's a plague as a result.

00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:10.180
We see the fire at the beginning of the chapter.

00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:12.500
You see the plague near the end of the chapter.

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:14.460
And in chapter 16, you see the plague.

00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:16.179
In Numbers chapter 12, guess what?

00:24:16.179 --> 00:24:20.500
Miriam and Aaron, they're complaining, they're speaking against Moses, and Miriam is stricken

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:23.220
with leprosy.

00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:28.020
We find that the Bible tells us in Numbers chapter 16 that those that were complaining,

00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:31.860
that the earth opened up and swallowed them.

00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:37.540
Wow, amazing, the severe judgment of God.

00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:41.899
In Numbers 21 that we looked at just a moment ago where they were complaining and saying

00:24:41.899 --> 00:24:47.739
that our soul loatheth this light bread, they had complained about the way, they were discouraged

00:24:47.739 --> 00:24:50.660
because of the way in which they had been led by God Almighty.

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:55.260
They were discouraged and they were complaining, and the Bible tells us in verse number 6 of

00:24:55.260 --> 00:25:01.200
Numbers 21 that the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:03.559
and much people of Israel died.

00:25:03.559 --> 00:25:09.160
We read about the brazen serpent and how that Moses obeyed the instruction of the Lord and

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:12.440
he gave the instruction of the people that if they were to look, they would live.

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:16.399
And certainly that was accomplished, and you see that at the end of the chapter, or at

00:25:16.399 --> 00:25:20.679
the end of the passage in verse number 9, that truth of looking and living.

00:25:20.679 --> 00:25:25.600
And we sing the song, Look and Live, and it's certainly derived from this portion of Scripture.

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:30.800
And I want you to think about the complaint of the people and the judgment, the severe

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:32.440
judgment.

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:36.040
They're complaining about no water and no bread and they were discouraged about the

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:38.360
way and God sent fiery serpents.

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:44.440
I bet you all of a sudden they weren't too upset about the way.

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:47.200
They weren't too concerned about the manna, right?

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:52.040
Because now they've got fiery serpents.

00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:55.559
This morning as we think about the tragedy of complaining, I want to draw your attention

00:25:55.559 --> 00:26:03.339
to a verse in the book of Psalms, Psalm 106, Psalm 106, I want you to think about the impact

00:26:03.339 --> 00:26:05.720
of our complaining on others.

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:10.679
I mentioned already that complaining is easy and the tendency of complaining and the fact

00:26:10.679 --> 00:26:16.920
that complaining is contagious and we've kind of given some truth with regard to various

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:21.720
circumstances and environments in which complaining takes place.

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:29.000
I want you to think about the way in which our complaining impacts others.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.800
We look in Psalm 106 and the Bible tells us, it's an interesting verse of Scripture in

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:38.360
verse number 25, it's speaking of the children of Israel and going through several of their

00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:41.279
things, their history and how they believed.

00:26:41.279 --> 00:26:46.399
It's interesting, look in verse 12, they believed, then believed they His words, they

00:26:46.399 --> 00:26:48.800
sang His praise.

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:52.800
They soon forgot His works, they waited not for His counsel.

00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:57.239
They forgot God in verse 21, their Savior, which had done great things in Egypt.

00:26:57.239 --> 00:27:02.000
It's amazing how quickly things can change and how they were remembering and praising

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.119
and then they're forgetting because of some circumstances and they're complaining.

00:27:06.119 --> 00:27:12.080
It says in verse 24, yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not His word,

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:19.720
but murmured in their tents and hearkened not unto the voice of the Lord.

00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:24.520
What is representative here of this phraseology, but murmured in their tents, this would be

00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:26.860
their dwelling place.

00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:30.559
We would say this, it would be in our homes, right?

00:27:30.559 --> 00:27:37.440
When you think about the murmuring in our homes and perhaps the impact and the influence

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:44.080
upon a future generation, we've already mentioned the fact that God hears our complaints, but

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:49.080
we must also recognize this morning that there are other people that hear our complaints.

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:54.520
And when they hear our complaints, we must ask ourselves, how does it impact them?

00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:56.320
How does it affect them?

00:27:56.320 --> 00:28:01.360
What image are we portraying of our God when we're complaining about our circumstances,

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:08.119
when we're complaining about the environment in which God has placed us?

00:28:08.119 --> 00:28:10.179
How's it impacting them?

00:28:10.179 --> 00:28:12.760
We criticize the children of Israel, why?

00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:17.959
Because they're complaining, they're not trusting God, they're not delighting in what God has

00:28:17.959 --> 00:28:20.920
provided and how God has directed.

00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:25.559
And we can look at their lives and we can criticize them, but the reality is that we

00:28:25.559 --> 00:28:30.559
must understand there's this tragic impact of complaining and you think about how others

00:28:30.559 --> 00:28:38.440
will hear, again, how wonderful for God to hear the praises of His people.

00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:44.880
But even for others that hear our praises as opposed to our complaints, they hear that

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:45.880
our God is good.

00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:51.280
I mean, in the midst of a society, again, as we mentioned there in 2 Timothy 3, that

00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:54.479
one of the characteristics is that people will be unthankful.

00:28:54.479 --> 00:29:00.080
It doesn't take us long as we go through this world to see that there's this complaining

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:04.679
spirit that is prevalent, but when they see something different about you and I, when

00:29:04.679 --> 00:29:10.440
they see that we're not complaining about all of the things, the hot topics in the news

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:15.200
this week and what they will be next week and how we complain about all those things,

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:19.359
but they're hearing us sing praise to our God, that He's in control, that He doeth all

00:29:19.359 --> 00:29:25.320
things well, that He has a plan, that He has a purpose, that we're not living under the

00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:32.080
circumstances, we're living trusting that God is doing all things well.

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:38.880
We see the tragedy of complaining, not only the way in which it displeases the Lord, but

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:45.280
the way in which it impacts others, and certainly complaining has an impact on other people.

00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:51.200
This morning we've noted from Numbers 11 the tendency of complaining, the tragedy of complaining.

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:56.559
Number three, I want you to think of this to triumph over complaining.

00:29:56.559 --> 00:29:59.880
If we acknowledge this morning that there's a tendency amongst...

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:00.880
the children of Israel.

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:02.520
And if we'd be honest with ourselves

00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:04.600
and we'd be honest before the Lord

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:06.240
that we'd say even in our own lives,

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:09.220
for some of us, there's a tendency to complain.

00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:12.080
There's this human response to the adversities,

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:13.880
to the difficulties, to the things

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:16.940
that we just flat out don't like, that we just complain.

00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:19.780
That we'd understand this morning

00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:22.320
that there's that tendency and it's a tragedy,

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:23.880
then I must come to the place where I say,

00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:27.000
can I, how can I triumph over this?

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:31.080
How can I have victory over this complaining spirit

00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:35.480
that's so prevalent in our society today that impacts me?

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:36.760
Listen, when you go to the workplace

00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:38.160
and you hear other people complaining,

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:40.320
even when you set out that today

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:43.520
is going to be the day, I am not gonna complain today.

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:47.300
And then all of a sudden, things happen.

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:50.480
People talk to you.

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:52.760
I can't believe, did you hear what?

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:56.240
And all of a sudden, man, it just, right?

00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:57.440
That's how it works.

00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:00.960
But look at the book of Philippians, if you will.

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:05.580
Look at the book of Philippians in chapter number two.

00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:10.140
How to triumph over complaining,

00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:13.540
we could ask ourselves this question, is it even possible?

00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:15.560
Is it possible as we live in the midst

00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:17.720
of a crooked and perverse generation,

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:20.240
is it possible as we live in the midst of a people

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:22.600
in these last days that will be characterized

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:24.680
as being unthankful and we hear it

00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:26.080
and we're bombarded with it,

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:29.600
and you can ask somebody today, hey, how are ya?

00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:31.120
It's a little bit too cold.

00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:32.680
You ask them yesterday, how are ya?

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:33.980
It's a little bit too hot.

00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:35.520
You ask them yesterday, how are ya?

00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:36.840
It's a little bit too windy.

00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:40.400
I mean, we just complain about everything, right?

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:47.180
In the midst of that type of an environment,

00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:48.720
I believe that we as the people of God

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:51.120
can triumph over complaining.

00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:54.160
Notice in Philippians two and verse number 14,

00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:56.960
notice what God says.

00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:03.240
Do all things without murmurings and disputings.

00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:05.920
How many things?

00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:08.000
All things.

00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:13.120
There's really in our minds sometimes in this day

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:15.520
in which we live, we like to separate

00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:18.520
the sacred from the secular.

00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:21.000
Compartmentalize, if you will.

00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:23.940
But the reality is that for the people of God,

00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:25.600
there's no real separation between

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:28.720
the sacred and the secular, amen?

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:31.880
And sometimes we think, well, we understand

00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:34.520
the importance of the sacred over here

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:37.419
and this is this particular pillar in which we live in,

00:32:37.419 --> 00:32:38.960
but then the secular over here.

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:40.800
But the reality is that when he says

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:43.639
do all things without murmurings and disputings,

00:32:43.639 --> 00:32:45.260
we're not putting those categories,

00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:46.559
we're not separating ourselves,

00:32:46.559 --> 00:32:49.440
we're saying I am a child of God, that's who I am,

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:52.800
that's my identification and I belong to him

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:57.800
and I'm to do all things without murmurings and disputings.

00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:01.840
Focus on that first thing there,

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:04.160
do all things without murmurings.

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:07.000
And as our subject matter this morning

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:10.160
would lead us to thinking of that truth,

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:13.120
and he says to do all things without murmurings.

00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:14.720
Listen, there are some things that are easy

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:17.800
to do without murmuring, right?

00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:18.960
There's some things that are just,

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:21.460
it's a delight for us to do them.

00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:22.880
It's a joy, it's a privilege,

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:25.800
and it's something that we enjoy doing,

00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:28.240
and so therefore, to do that thing,

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:29.800
whatever that thing is, and it's different

00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:31.279
for each and every one of us,

00:33:31.279 --> 00:33:33.800
it's easy for us to do it without complaining,

00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:34.820
without murmuring.

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:38.400
But in like fashion for every single one of us,

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:39.720
there are some things that are a little bit

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:43.680
more difficult to do without murmuring, right?

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:46.760
We know, you know yourself.

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:50.360
I know myself.

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:53.160
And there are tasks, there are things

00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:57.840
that sometimes it's some task that we have before us

00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:00.900
that it's hard for us to do without murmuring.

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:03.559
It's gonna be a challenge.

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:07.400
And we come to the place where we say,

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:10.200
well, God said do all things,

00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:13.540
not do the things I like without murmuring,

00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:16.360
not do the things that are easy without murmuring,

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:18.239
not do the things that bring me joy

00:34:18.239 --> 00:34:20.440
or bring me satisfaction without murmuring,

00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:24.600
but he said do all things without murmurings

00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:25.760
and disputings.

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:28.760
And so I think about these murmurings

00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:31.119
and these do all things without murmurings,

00:34:31.119 --> 00:34:33.559
and we say can we triumph over complaining?

00:34:33.559 --> 00:34:34.520
Is it possible?

00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:36.520
And I would say yes, absolutely,

00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:37.980
with the help of the Lord.

00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:39.880
Let me say this, there is no command

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:43.540
that God has given us that he will not enable us to keep.

00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:45.660
Amen?

00:34:45.660 --> 00:34:46.700
I believe that.

00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:49.520
That God has, if he's told us to do all things

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:51.380
without murmurings and disputings,

00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:54.200
that with the help of God and by the grace of God,

00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:58.920
by his enablement, we are able to do all things

00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:00.040
without murmuring.

00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:05.040
Even that thing that is the least on our list, right?

00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:08.860
We can do it without murmuring, without complaining,

00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:12.140
only with the help of God.

00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:15.020
Notice, if you will, in 1 Thessalonians chapter five.

00:35:15.899 --> 00:35:18.339
I believe that this goes hand in hand

00:35:18.339 --> 00:35:20.860
and we're familiar with the latter part

00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:23.700
of 1 Thessalonians five and how many

00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:25.779
just simple verses of scripture

00:35:25.779 --> 00:35:28.940
and just commands and instructions that are given

00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:31.540
in these closing verses of scripture.

00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:33.619
In verse number 18, a familiar verse,

00:35:33.619 --> 00:35:35.980
the Bible says in everything give thanks

00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:40.080
for this is the will of God and Christ Jesus concerning you.

00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:42.700
Why would I use this verse of scripture

00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:45.279
in connection with this spirit of complaining

00:35:45.279 --> 00:35:47.440
and this tendency to complain,

00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:50.119
the tragedy that is associated with complaining

00:35:50.119 --> 00:35:52.559
and how we would have victory over complaining?

00:35:52.559 --> 00:35:54.480
It's that we change our perspective.

00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:57.399
It's that we come to the place where in everything

00:35:57.399 --> 00:35:58.480
we give thanks.

00:35:58.480 --> 00:35:59.320
Why?

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:03.440
For this is the will of God and Christ Jesus concerning you.

00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:07.540
I have the privilege of fill in the blank.

00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:12.179
I remember hearing years ago,

00:36:12.179 --> 00:36:14.020
it was an account that was given

00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:15.660
while I was still in Bible college

00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:19.420
and I think it was kind of given to us as a primer

00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:21.640
to help us have the right response

00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:24.179
if we were to encounter this situation.

00:36:24.179 --> 00:36:25.700
But it was a situation in which a young man

00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:29.339
was interviewing for a ministry position

00:36:29.339 --> 00:36:32.420
and this particular pastor that would interview

00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:35.279
for this position, every time in the midst of the interview,

00:36:35.279 --> 00:36:37.300
he would have his secretary call in

00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:39.779
and tell him that there was an overflowing toilet

00:36:39.779 --> 00:36:42.779
in the men's bathroom and they needed immediate assistance

00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:47.100
just to see how the one being interviewed would respond.

00:36:48.899 --> 00:36:49.860
Would they go and help?

00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:51.660
Would they not?

00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:54.619
And it's kind of interesting how we say,

00:36:54.619 --> 00:36:56.140
in everything give thanks,

00:36:56.140 --> 00:36:58.980
for this is the will of God and Christ Jesus concerning you

00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:02.020
that we can rejoice that God's given us the opportunity.

00:37:02.020 --> 00:37:04.420
As I mentioned, we complain about the gas prices

00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:06.260
but God's provided for us.

00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:10.420
Thank you, Lord.

00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:12.059
Well, I got to dip into my savings.

00:37:12.059 --> 00:37:14.500
I heard somebody say that when I was in Tennessee.

00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:19.500
It was no one of you, nobody that I even knew.

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:21.260
Ah, I got to dip into my savings.

00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:23.779
Hey, what about being thankful you have a savings?

00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:27.660
That God provided for you in abundance

00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:32.020
at some time previous so that you could have a savings.

00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:35.559
Right, it's a change of perspective is really what it is.

00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:40.399
You think about Joseph in Egypt.

00:37:40.399 --> 00:37:42.880
There were seven years of plenty.

00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:46.679
If God had not graciously given that dream to Pharaoh

00:37:46.679 --> 00:37:50.640
and God had not enabled Joseph to interpret that dream,

00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:52.399
what do you think the Egyptians would have done

00:37:52.399 --> 00:37:54.000
for those seven years of plenty?

00:37:54.959 --> 00:37:56.600
They would have feasted.

00:37:58.600 --> 00:37:59.520
And then what would have happened

00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:01.360
in the seven years of famine?

00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:02.200
They would have died.

00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:03.920
It wouldn't have lasted seven years, right?

00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:05.720
Because they wouldn't have had enough.

00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:10.880
And so God provides graciously.

00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:14.279
And as he provides, we see that his provision

00:38:14.279 --> 00:38:15.279
sometimes is immediate.

00:38:15.279 --> 00:38:18.000
Sometimes his provision was years ago

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.200
on allowing us to be in the position

00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:24.080
where we can handle what God has allowed to happen.

00:38:25.119 --> 00:38:26.600
I understand there's all reasons.

00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:28.279
Listen, everybody wants to point fingers

00:38:28.279 --> 00:38:30.239
about gas prices today.

00:38:30.239 --> 00:38:31.839
Everybody.

00:38:31.839 --> 00:38:32.660
Point fingers.

00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:33.500
It's this person's fault.

00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:35.859
This thing, blah, blah, blah, right?

00:38:35.859 --> 00:38:39.660
And oh, it's easy for us to get caught into the trap.

00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:41.619
Right?

00:38:42.619 --> 00:38:45.260
I use that because it's just so prevalent right now.

00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:49.739
They got little stickers on gas pumps all over the place

00:38:49.739 --> 00:38:50.820
that you go to pump gas.

00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:53.119
I mean, it's just, it's crazy what's going on.

00:38:54.419 --> 00:38:58.020
And if we're not careful, we can fall into the same trap.

00:38:58.020 --> 00:39:00.900
And so how do we triumph over complaining?

00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:04.500
It's possible because God said, let all things be done.

00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:08.660
Do all things without murmurings and disputings.

00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:10.539
So if he's given me a command,

00:39:10.539 --> 00:39:15.539
he also will enable me to meet that, to keep that command.

00:39:15.739 --> 00:39:17.299
And it's that change of perspective

00:39:17.299 --> 00:39:20.059
that God is good all the time.

00:39:21.479 --> 00:39:22.979
All the time, God is good.

00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:26.059
We find ourselves in this situation

00:39:26.059 --> 00:39:27.820
as we sing about the goodness of God.

00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:30.059
And it was really sweet this morning in Sunday school

00:39:30.059 --> 00:39:32.020
singing that song, God is so good.

00:39:32.979 --> 00:39:35.260
And I could just hear the voice of the people.

00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:37.500
I mean, I believe we believe it.

00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:38.419
God is good.

00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:42.520
God was good to the children of Israel, was he not?

00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:45.380
It didn't stop them from complaining though.

00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:48.419
They complained about the very provision of God Almighty.

00:39:48.419 --> 00:39:51.780
They complained about the very direction of God Almighty.

00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:54.220
They complained about what God had provided for them

00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:56.059
and how God had directed them.

00:39:56.059 --> 00:39:57.099
Instead of rejoicing,

00:39:57.099 --> 00:39:59.940
instead of expecting that God would work great,

00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:05.880
There's a pastor friend that I know, when you chat with him as soon as you, you know,

00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:10.180
some people have these interesting responses when you say, hey, how are you?

00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:13.180
You see somebody, you talk to them on the phone, you see them in person, you shake their

00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:15.300
hand and ask how they're doing.

00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:17.640
For Mr. Don, it's absolutely wonderful.

00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:20.900
Most of us have gotten to the point where we've understood that and we've heard that.

00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:25.020
We have some people, thankfully none that are part of our congregation, at least not

00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:29.300
that I've heard that I've experienced in the past that say, well, under the circumstances,

00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:33.260
you know, it's kind of that Eeyore personality of, oh, bother, right?

00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:38.140
Things are just kind of, and, you know, you see these different people, some people say

00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:39.140
this, how are you?

00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:40.140
Hey, I'm better than I deserve.

00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:42.380
You ever heard somebody say that?

00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:46.960
I've heard people say, I like that response, I'm better than I deserve.

00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:51.020
This pastor friend of mine, as you chat with him, he'll say this, when you ask him how

00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:54.540
he's doing, he'll say, if I complained, I'd be lying.

00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:56.940
That's what he says.

00:40:56.940 --> 00:40:57.940
It's kind of catchy.

00:40:57.940 --> 00:41:00.740
It's kind of like thought provoking.

00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:05.860
I've never heard anyone say that before when I've greeted them, but when I greet him, he'll

00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:09.300
say, well, brother man, if I'd complain, I'd be lying.

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:11.779
That's what he says.

00:41:11.779 --> 00:41:14.420
You know what he means by that?

00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:15.420
God is good.

00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:22.620
And so if I complain, I'm lying, because I'm saying that God isn't good.

00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:29.139
Because whatever I'm complaining about, ultimately, my charge is against God.

00:41:29.139 --> 00:41:35.660
How many times did the children of Israel complain toward Moses and toward Aaron?

00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:38.700
But who really was their complaint directed at?

00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:41.700
It was directed at God.

00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:43.860
I mean, think about Moses just for a moment.

00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:45.020
And I'm going to close with this.

00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:48.819
Jim, I'm going to mess you up, because I'm going to come down here, and he's got to move

00:41:48.819 --> 00:41:51.980
the camera all around.

00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:54.540
But I want you to think about Moses.

00:41:54.540 --> 00:41:57.580
The people come to Moses and say, you led us here.

00:41:57.580 --> 00:42:00.620
Moses is like, you don't see the pillar?

00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:05.959
What do you mean, I led you here?

00:42:05.959 --> 00:42:07.100
Do you not see the pillar?

00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:11.100
We were following the pillar, right?

00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:12.300
But who are the people complaining against?

00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:13.860
Well, they want to complain about Moses.

00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:14.860
Why?

00:42:15.699 --> 00:42:16.699
They don't really want to complain.

00:42:16.699 --> 00:42:19.100
Now, sometimes they did complain directly about God.

00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:25.380
But typically, we want to complain about someone human, not about God.

00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:31.540
But the reality is that if God had provided the human leader, Moses, and had provided

00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:39.740
the direction, then as they complained about Moses, really, their complaint was about God.

00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:43.540
Do we believe that God is sovereign?

00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:45.940
He is.

00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:47.699
We believe He's in control.

00:42:47.699 --> 00:42:50.100
He's sitting on His throne.

00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:53.180
He knows exactly what's going on in the world today.

00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:55.500
He's not surprised by anything that's going on in the world today.

00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:56.500
We believe all that, right?

00:42:56.500 --> 00:43:01.740
So when we begin to complain about what's taking place, who ultimately are we complaining

00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:02.740
about?

00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:03.740
God.

00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:06.059
When we complain, I almost hit that cello.

00:43:06.059 --> 00:43:08.580
That would have been a big mistake.

00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:09.580
Is that yours?

00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:11.900
That would have been a really big mistake.

00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:14.260
Steve, I'd just say, sorry.

00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:18.260
I've got to live with Brianna.

00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:19.260
Amen.

00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:22.339
That just messed me all up.

00:43:22.339 --> 00:43:26.660
But the reality is that when we complain, we're complaining about God.

00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:30.460
We come to the place where we say, you know what?

00:43:30.460 --> 00:43:35.339
I want to have victory in this area of my life.

00:43:35.339 --> 00:43:41.220
I know there's a tendency on the part of us as human beings to complain.

00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:48.180
If we're not careful and if we don't guard against it, every single one of us can fall

00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:50.180
prey to complaining.

00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:51.559
We really can.

00:43:51.559 --> 00:43:58.419
We can just come to the place where we just get into that rut, complain about this and

00:43:58.419 --> 00:44:00.860
complain about that.

00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:08.979
We see it in our society, but it ought not be amongst the people of God.

00:44:08.979 --> 00:44:10.460
Amen?

00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:12.419
It ought not be amongst the people of God.

00:44:12.419 --> 00:44:13.419
Why?

00:44:13.419 --> 00:44:16.420
Because our God is good all of the time.

00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:20.059
Before I almost ran into the cello, I was going to go to the book of Daniel.

00:44:20.059 --> 00:44:25.500
I won't take time to do it at this point, but you think about the truth that God gives

00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:33.220
in the book of Daniel with regard to God being in control of the affairs of mankind.

00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:35.700
We complain about our government leadership.

00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:41.899
Listen, those people are only in place because God's allowed them to be in place.

00:44:41.899 --> 00:44:42.899
I've said this before.

00:44:42.899 --> 00:44:47.660
In fact, just a few weeks ago, I said as we preached on the subject of prayer, what place

00:44:47.660 --> 00:44:50.179
does prayer have in our lives?

00:44:50.179 --> 00:44:54.459
God said that we're to pray for those in leadership.

00:44:54.459 --> 00:44:59.220
We're to pray for those that are in authority.

00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:02.980
It's easier to complain about them, right?

00:45:02.980 --> 00:45:03.980
You got a bad boss.

00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:08.739
It's easier to complain about them than to pray for them.

00:45:08.739 --> 00:45:14.660
And this morning, when the people complained, it displeased the Lord.

00:45:14.660 --> 00:45:20.739
He heard them, and His anger was kindled against them.

00:45:20.739 --> 00:45:26.220
It's tragic, but I'm thankful this morning that we can triumph.

00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:32.540
We can be victorious over this matter of complaining, and oh, that God would help us.

00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:33.540
Let's pray together.

00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:37.260
We thank You for the Word of God.

00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:43.260
We thank You for the truth, and we thank You for how You've provided these Old Testament

00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:58.140
records and samples, as Paul said to the believers in Corinth, for our admonition, for our instruction,

00:45:58.140 --> 00:46:05.100
that we would learn, even from this particular message this morning, that which would displease

00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:06.100
You.

00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:13.179
And Lord, I pray that as we would take a few moments this morning to honestly evaluate

00:46:13.179 --> 00:46:21.860
our lives, that as we would take the time to let a man examine himself, that it's easy

00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:24.339
for us to criticize those that complain.

00:46:24.339 --> 00:46:30.980
It's easy for us to criticize the children of Israel for their complaining, but far too

00:46:30.980 --> 00:46:36.380
often we imitate their behavior.

00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:46.779
For all that You've done for us, for how good You've been to us, how sad that we would complain.

00:46:46.779 --> 00:46:55.540
I pray that You'd help us as we evaluate our own lives personally to be honest.

00:46:55.540 --> 00:47:03.940
God that we'd be able to identify if there's that tendency in our lives, that we'd run

00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:11.179
to You seeking Your help so that we might triumph over it, that we would not get caught

00:47:11.179 --> 00:47:26.420
up in these complaining sessions, these workplace, church house, wherever it might be, but God

00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:33.980
we'd look to You and see how good You are and how good You've been, that we'd do all

00:47:33.980 --> 00:47:37.299
things without murmurings.

00:47:37.299 --> 00:47:42.299
Would You move and work as only You can, help us Lord to be honest with You, to be

00:47:42.299 --> 00:47:44.820
doers of the Word, we'll thank You for it.

00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:45.820
Would You stand with me?

00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:48.700
Heads are out, eyes are closed.

00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:52.100
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano.

00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:54.660
As she does, the altar's open.

00:47:54.660 --> 00:48:00.899
Maybe for someone there's confession that needs to take place, there's been complaining

00:48:00.899 --> 00:48:03.959
and you want to just come get it right with God.

00:48:03.959 --> 00:48:08.119
Maybe for someone this morning there's a recognition of that tendency and you want

00:48:08.119 --> 00:48:12.399
God to help you so that you can triumph and you maybe need to visit this altar this morning

00:48:12.399 --> 00:48:19.119
and ask God to just protect you and help you to prevent you from falling into that complaining

00:48:19.119 --> 00:48:21.279
spirit.

00:48:21.279 --> 00:48:24.000
Maybe God's spoken to your heart in some other way.

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.799
Maybe you just want to come and thank Him this morning.

00:48:26.799 --> 00:48:28.760
But as Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
