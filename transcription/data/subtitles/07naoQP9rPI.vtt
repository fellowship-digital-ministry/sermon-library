00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.039
Revelation chapter number three,

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:07.079
often when we sing that song and think about that last verse,

00:00:07.079 --> 00:00:10.380
I think about Peter in Acts chapter number 12

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.020
and what peace of, the peace of God he had

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.219
as he's asleep between two prison guards,

00:00:17.219 --> 00:00:20.659
just having the peace of God and in that trial

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:24.459
and that situation, and I'm thankful that God leads

00:00:24.459 --> 00:00:27.659
and it is our responsibility to follow where he leads us.

00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:28.659
We're in chapter number three this evening

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:32.000
and last week we looked at part number one

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.860
of the church of the Laodiceans.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.360
We looked at verses 14 through 17

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.639
and while we noted that portion of scripture,

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:43.080
we understood that God reminded the church

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.779
of the Laodiceans of his position and of his power

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:50.439
and we were reminded that he introduces

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:52.880
as he's writing to them in verse number 14,

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.619
he's telling John to write this.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.759
He says, these things saith the amen

00:00:57.759 --> 00:01:00.979
and we made note of the name that is used there

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:04.000
and the significance of what the Lord Jesus Christ

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.599
is communicating to this church

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:10.199
and it was that what he says is so

00:01:10.199 --> 00:01:13.400
and the message that he was gonna deliver to this church

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.879
was not a message that anyone would like to receive.

00:01:16.879 --> 00:01:19.879
He has nothing to commend them for

00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:22.319
but he has much to correct them for.

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:25.500
We find that the message, we looked last week

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.019
and we found that this church,

00:01:27.019 --> 00:01:30.260
they were on a faulty path

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.019
and they were on a path that was led

00:01:33.019 --> 00:01:35.199
by their faulty perspective.

00:01:35.199 --> 00:01:37.580
They had this self-reliance

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.720
and this self-deception was going on

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.699
because of their self-reliance

00:01:42.699 --> 00:01:46.199
and we find that as we concluded the message last week

00:01:46.199 --> 00:01:50.660
that we said this, it is unfortunate yet I believe true

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.180
that as you study church history,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.720
there are far too many churches

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.500
that mirror the behavior of what we see

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.800
of the church of the Laodiceans

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.080
and I said this, it's a frequent path

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.760
but it doesn't have to be.

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:09.600
We can in 2025, we can be a church that honors God,

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:14.839
we can be a church that we determine

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:18.600
and we commit to doing God's work, God's way

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.740
and we can have God's blessing,

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.639
we can have revival,

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:26.300
we can have God's spirit present in our midst

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.979
and we are to worship him in spirit and in truth

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:32.380
and we find this evening that we can rejoice

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.059
in knowing that though the condition

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:37.259
as it's presented to us in Revelation 3

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:39.300
of the church of the Laodiceans,

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.619
though the condition is dim and unfortunate,

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:45.419
not every church has to mirror this condition

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:47.020
and I'm thankful for that

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.919
and I rejoice in that.

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:50.279
We'll be looking at verse 18

00:02:50.279 --> 00:02:52.279
down through verse number 22 this evening

00:02:52.279 --> 00:02:54.860
as we consider part two this evening.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.919
Notice as we begin reading in verse 18,

00:02:56.919 --> 00:03:00.800
the Bible says this, I counsel thee.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.600
Remember, John is writing but he's writing from the Lord,

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.960
the one who is the amen as he said in verse 14,

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.240
the one who is faithful,

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.399
who is the faithful and the true witness,

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:16.660
the one who is the owner and possessor,

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:17.860
creator of all things,

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.699
the beginning of the creation of God.

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:23.380
He says in verse 18, I counsel thee.

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.820
Now, counsel is something that's interesting.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.419
Counsel is only profitable when it's taken heed.

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:36.220
Counsel is given.

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.059
We find in verse 18 that he says, I counsel thee.

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:41.100
Notice what he's gonna counsel them to do,

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.100
really three things here in verse 18.

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:46.960
I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.000
that thou mayest be rich and white raiment

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.240
that thou mayest be clothed

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.399
and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:57.779
and anoint thine eyes with eyes of that thou mayest see.

00:03:57.779 --> 00:04:01.320
As many, verse 19, as I love, I rebuke and chase

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.360
and be zealous therefore and repent.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.160
Behold, I stand at the door and knock.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.460
If any man hear my voice and open the door,

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.960
I will come into him and will sup with him

00:04:13.779 --> 00:04:15.820
and he with me.

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.660
To him that overcometh will I grant

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.399
to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:24.619
and am set down with my father in his throne.

00:04:24.619 --> 00:04:26.260
Aren't you thankful that he conquered sin,

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:27.100
death, and the grave?

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.220
He overcame it all.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.480
He is victorious, amen, and what a blessing.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.700
But thanks be to God which giveth us the victory.

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:34.859
How does he give us victory?

00:04:34.859 --> 00:04:37.500
Because he is victorious.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.339
Verse 22, he that hath an ear,

00:04:40.339 --> 00:04:44.480
let him hear what the Spirit sayeth unto the churches.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:45.839
As we get into the text this evening,

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:47.480
I want you to note first of all,

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.720
from verse number 18, note the counsel.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.440
I've read the text of scripture,

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.559
but we find that in verse 18 that the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:04:54.559 --> 00:04:59.559
after communicating to this church of their true condition,

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.420
remember he tells them that they're lukewarm.

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.959
He tells them that he knows their works.

00:05:04.959 --> 00:05:07.000
Thou art neither cold nor hot.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.739
I would thou work cold or hot in verse 15.

00:05:09.739 --> 00:05:12.399
Verse 16, so then because thou art lukewarm

00:05:12.399 --> 00:05:16.200
and neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee out of thy mouth.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.519
He tells them in verse 17, here's what you say.

00:05:20.519 --> 00:05:24.600
I am rich, increased with goods, have need of nothing.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.600
But we find that God says that you do not know,

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.100
and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.239
and poor and blind and naked.

00:05:34.239 --> 00:05:37.799
And so after revealing their true condition,

00:05:37.799 --> 00:05:40.179
the amen, what he says is so,

00:05:40.179 --> 00:05:43.899
he now is going to provide them with counsel.

00:05:43.899 --> 00:05:46.619
Note with me, they don't ask for counsel,

00:05:46.619 --> 00:05:48.739
but God gives counsel.

00:05:48.739 --> 00:05:51.500
And it's a good thing to ask for counsel,

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.100
but I'm thankful that God, and what a truth about our God,

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.200
he's always pursuing his people.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.779
He's always pursuing his people.

00:05:59.779 --> 00:06:03.579
You know, God wants to have a close fellowship with you,

00:06:03.579 --> 00:06:06.420
but he doesn't make you have a close fellowship with him.

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:08.880
He wants it, he desires it.

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.679
He wants you to have that close fellowship with him,

00:06:12.679 --> 00:06:16.000
but he does not force himself upon you.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.880
And we find that he gives counsel,

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.839
and all of the counsel that he gives

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:22.600
is good counsel, by the way.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.959
He only can give good counsel.

00:06:24.959 --> 00:06:29.959
And he gives this counsel, and he tells them three things.

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:33.959
It's interesting to note what the Lord tells

00:06:33.959 --> 00:06:35.640
the believers in this church.

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:40.660
He says, first of all, to buy gold tried in the fire.

00:06:40.859 --> 00:06:42.899
That's very interesting because you understand

00:06:42.899 --> 00:06:44.700
that as you look in verse 17,

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:49.700
their perspective, their own idea of their condition

00:06:50.299 --> 00:06:54.500
was that I am rich and increased with goods.

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:56.500
And God says to them,

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:02.660
to buy of me gold tried in the fire.

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:04.760
I mentioned last Sunday evening

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.779
how that this church could be referred to

00:07:06.779 --> 00:07:09.339
as the rich, poor church.

00:07:09.339 --> 00:07:11.940
Oh, they were rich from a world's perspective,

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:14.700
maybe monetarily, but they were lacking

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:18.040
in the treasures that God has for us.

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:20.100
You find that the Bible talks about,

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:23.579
the psalmist reveals to us about the great delight

00:07:23.579 --> 00:07:26.940
and joy that he has in studying and reading God's word.

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:27.779
Why?

00:07:27.779 --> 00:07:31.179
Because he's finding as some that would find great treasure.

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:36.559
Oh, I'm thankful for the riches that we have in Christ.

00:07:36.559 --> 00:07:39.720
I said last week that we have in Christ

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.399
what money cannot buy us.

00:07:43.279 --> 00:07:45.760
We find that he says, buy of me.

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:50.279
Notice he says, buy of me gold tried in the fire

00:07:50.279 --> 00:07:54.059
that thou mayest be rich.

00:07:55.559 --> 00:07:58.279
The perspective of the world and the perspective of God

00:07:58.279 --> 00:08:00.959
is often quite different.

00:08:01.679 --> 00:08:05.880
We find that here God says to them in giving this counsel,

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:07.480
here's the first thing that you need to do.

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:10.079
You need to buy gold that is of me

00:08:10.079 --> 00:08:12.859
that is tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich.

00:08:12.859 --> 00:08:16.000
But remember, they're already saying that they are rich.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.119
He says, no, your perspective is faulty

00:08:19.119 --> 00:08:20.559
and you need to understand

00:08:20.559 --> 00:08:23.880
what the real important things are of life.

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:28.760
Our world places value on things that God does not value.

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:29.600
Amen?

00:08:29.619 --> 00:08:31.200
And it is absolutely imperative

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:34.479
that we as the people of God place proper value

00:08:34.479 --> 00:08:37.880
on what God places value upon.

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:40.039
We find that God gives them this counsel.

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:42.320
He continues with the counsel in verse 18.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:45.679
Notice he says, and white raiment.

00:08:45.679 --> 00:08:48.679
Notice what he says, that thou mayest be clothed

00:08:48.679 --> 00:08:52.760
and the shame of thy nakedness do not appear.

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:55.799
We find that he's giving them this counsel to buy gold

00:08:55.799 --> 00:08:57.520
and now to buy white raiment.

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:01.239
And we begin to think about the Lord making this statement

00:09:01.239 --> 00:09:02.520
and giving this counsel.

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.280
He told them, I know their works.

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:06.039
He's aware of their condition.

00:09:06.039 --> 00:09:08.419
And now he's telling them

00:09:08.419 --> 00:09:10.039
that they need to buy this white raiment.

00:09:10.039 --> 00:09:13.080
Notice that thou mayest be clothed.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:14.940
I think of what Paul says when he talks about

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:17.320
not being clothed with his own righteousness,

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.179
but with the righteousness of Christ.

00:09:20.179 --> 00:09:23.599
I think about having, as we know the white raiment,

00:09:23.599 --> 00:09:25.960
and you study that throughout the book of Revelation

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:29.039
and you understand the purity, the holiness, if you will,

00:09:29.039 --> 00:09:31.119
and you understand here this evening

00:09:31.119 --> 00:09:34.200
that the Lord is giving them counsel

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:37.080
that is contrary to what they have been practicing

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:40.400
in their life, the direction in which they've gone.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.679
And God is saying, no, listen,

00:09:42.679 --> 00:09:45.520
I'm going to give you counsel.

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:46.880
You've put value.

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:50.799
You've placed an emphasis on things that do not matter.

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.719
You need to have a change of perspective.

00:09:56.679 --> 00:09:58.559
You need to get my perspective,

00:09:58.559 --> 00:10:00.559
is what God is saying to this church.

00:10:00.559 --> 00:10:05.559
He says that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear.

00:10:05.559 --> 00:10:09.559
We find that he ends here at the end of verse 18 with the council,

00:10:09.559 --> 00:10:16.559
the third part of the council is to anoint thine eyes with eyesalve that thou mayest see.

00:10:16.559 --> 00:10:20.559
Now think about that just for a moment. Think about being the original recipient,

00:10:20.559 --> 00:10:25.559
somebody in the church there of the Laodiceans, and you're receiving this letter,

00:10:25.559 --> 00:10:28.559
and you're saying, hold on a minute, I already have riches,

00:10:28.559 --> 00:10:34.559
but God's telling me to buy this gold that he's speaking of that I might be rich.

00:10:34.559 --> 00:10:37.559
I'm already clothed, but he's telling me to buy this white raiment.

00:10:37.559 --> 00:10:42.559
I already can see, but he's telling me to anoint mine eyes.

00:10:42.559 --> 00:10:49.559
It's a worldly church, a church that was on a faulty path because of a faulty perspective,

00:10:49.559 --> 00:10:52.559
and they needed some counsel.

00:10:52.559 --> 00:10:55.559
The three main areas of industry in Laodicea,

00:10:55.559 --> 00:11:00.559
if you study history and look at some things, there are three main areas of industry.

00:11:00.559 --> 00:11:05.559
One was banking, one was the textile industry, and one was medicines.

00:11:05.559 --> 00:11:10.559
And you find that each of those three things are targeted in this counsel that God gives

00:11:10.559 --> 00:11:16.559
because what was happening is they thought that their trust that was in their own wealth,

00:11:16.559 --> 00:11:21.559
their own banking industry, the textile industry, the medications and medicines,

00:11:21.559 --> 00:11:26.559
the salves that they had, that that was where they had their confidence.

00:11:26.559 --> 00:11:32.559
And God's saying, no, your perspective's wrong. He gives them counsel.

00:11:32.559 --> 00:11:40.559
I would submit to you this evening that God's word is an open book of God's counsel to us as his people.

00:11:40.559 --> 00:11:44.559
I'm so thankful for God's word. Turn back to Psalm 19, if you will.

00:11:44.559 --> 00:11:49.559
And oftentimes we go to Psalm 119, but I want you to look at Psalm 19.

00:11:49.559 --> 00:11:58.559
Psalm 119 is just a wonderful chapter in God's word that just deals with just the rejoicing of the psalmist

00:11:58.559 --> 00:12:00.559
because of having God's word.

00:12:00.559 --> 00:12:04.559
When we look at Psalm 19, and it's kind of a condensed version, if you will,

00:12:04.559 --> 00:12:09.559
there's nowhere near as many verses here, but I want you to look at just the center section,

00:12:09.559 --> 00:12:13.559
if you will, here in Psalm 19, and I want you to see what the psalmist says.

00:12:13.559 --> 00:12:15.559
It's a psalm that's ascribed to David.

00:12:15.559 --> 00:12:21.559
And notice what he says in verse number seven, the law of the Lord is perfect.

00:12:21.559 --> 00:12:26.559
The law of the Lord is perfect. Notice what it says, converting the soul.

00:12:26.559 --> 00:12:33.559
The testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple.

00:12:33.559 --> 00:12:37.559
We think about conversion. We think about the truth of being saved.

00:12:37.559 --> 00:12:41.559
We're born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible by the word of God,

00:12:41.559 --> 00:12:45.559
which liveth and abideth forever, according to what Peter tells us.

00:12:45.559 --> 00:12:52.559
We think about the simple here, and he talks about how the testimonies of the Lord is sure,

00:12:52.559 --> 00:12:58.559
making wise the simple. This book is a book of counsel.

00:12:58.559 --> 00:13:04.559
It tells us in verse eight, the statutes of the Lord are, what does it say, right.

00:13:04.559 --> 00:13:11.559
The time, the period of the judges, every man was doing that which was right in his own eyes.

00:13:11.559 --> 00:13:14.559
But God's word is always right.

00:13:14.559 --> 00:13:18.559
My perspective and your perspective may be flawed, it may be faulty,

00:13:18.559 --> 00:13:23.559
but God's perspective is always right. God's word is always right.

00:13:23.559 --> 00:13:27.559
And he's given this counsel to the church of the Laodiceans, to the people there,

00:13:27.559 --> 00:13:31.559
because they need God's counsel and God's statutes are right.

00:13:31.559 --> 00:13:37.559
They rejoice the heart. The commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes.

00:13:37.559 --> 00:13:40.559
The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever.

00:13:40.559 --> 00:13:44.559
The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.

00:13:44.559 --> 00:13:49.559
And then notice in verse 10, more to be desired are they than gold.

00:13:49.559 --> 00:13:56.559
What is he referring to? The they that he's referring to is the law, the Lord, the testimony, the statutes.

00:13:56.559 --> 00:14:03.559
And he says that more to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold,

00:14:03.559 --> 00:14:06.559
sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.

00:14:06.559 --> 00:14:11.559
Moreover, notice what it says in verse number 11, by them is thy servant warned,

00:14:11.559 --> 00:14:17.559
and in keeping of them there is great reward.

00:14:17.559 --> 00:14:22.559
The people in Laodicea, they had a temporal perspective.

00:14:22.559 --> 00:14:27.559
Oh, they thought they had wealth physically.

00:14:27.559 --> 00:14:30.559
They thought they had great raiments physically.

00:14:30.559 --> 00:14:34.559
They thought they could see physically.

00:14:34.559 --> 00:14:37.559
But God says spiritually, spiritually.

00:14:37.559 --> 00:14:40.559
Remember what he says to them as we looked at it last week,

00:14:40.559 --> 00:14:46.559
you're wretched, miserable, poor, blind and naked.

00:14:46.559 --> 00:14:48.559
Wow, what an indictment.

00:14:48.559 --> 00:14:55.559
So understanding their true condition, that they were wretched and miserable, poor, blind and naked,

00:14:55.559 --> 00:15:01.559
God deals with those last three, poor, blind and naked, in the counsel that he gives.

00:15:01.559 --> 00:15:06.559
And that condition of being poor, blind and naked lead to being wretched and miserable.

00:15:06.559 --> 00:15:10.559
And he tells them, you're to buy of me gold that's tried in the fire.

00:15:10.559 --> 00:15:12.559
Why? That thou mayest be rich.

00:15:12.559 --> 00:15:16.559
You're naked, and so therefore buy of me white raiment that thou mayest be clothed,

00:15:16.559 --> 00:15:19.559
and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear.

00:15:19.559 --> 00:15:26.559
You're blind, and so therefore anoint thine eyes with eyesalve that thou mayest see.

00:15:26.559 --> 00:15:29.559
What good counsel that is.

00:15:29.559 --> 00:15:34.559
What good counsel we find here to the church of the Laodiceans.

00:15:34.559 --> 00:15:37.559
We note, first of all, the counsel as we continue through the text.

00:15:37.559 --> 00:15:39.559
We note, number two, the chastening.

00:15:39.559 --> 00:15:42.559
In verse number 19, God gives to us, reveals to us,

00:15:42.559 --> 00:15:46.559
something that has been previously discussed throughout his word.

00:15:46.559 --> 00:15:49.559
In fact, you can go all the way back to Proverbs, and we'll look at it just briefly.

00:15:49.559 --> 00:15:53.559
You can see in the book of Psalms, you can see broadly in the book of Hebrews,

00:15:53.559 --> 00:15:57.559
this truth of chastening.

00:15:57.559 --> 00:16:00.559
And we note in verse number 19, notice what the Bible says,

00:16:00.559 --> 00:16:05.559
as many as I love, I rebuke and chasten.

00:16:05.559 --> 00:16:10.559
You know what God reminds the people of? He reminds them that he loves them.

00:16:10.559 --> 00:16:13.559
Aren't you thankful for God's love?

00:16:13.559 --> 00:16:17.559
What a joy to know the love of Christ.

00:16:17.559 --> 00:16:21.559
To know that there's nothing that can separate me from God's love.

00:16:21.559 --> 00:16:25.559
We rejoice this evening in knowing that God loves us,

00:16:25.559 --> 00:16:32.559
but notice, because he loves us, as many as I love, notice, I rebuke and chasten.

00:16:32.559 --> 00:16:39.559
It is the truth of God's word that because he loves us,

00:16:39.559 --> 00:16:42.559
he rebukes and he chastens.

00:16:42.559 --> 00:16:48.559
He loves you too much. He loves me too much to leave us to ourselves and to our own resources.

00:16:48.559 --> 00:16:51.559
He's going to rebuke and he's going to chasten.

00:16:51.559 --> 00:16:54.559
He gives that counsel.

00:16:54.559 --> 00:17:00.559
And we find this evening that God is reminding not only the church of the Laodiceans,

00:17:00.559 --> 00:17:04.559
but we find that he's reminding every church of these seven churches

00:17:04.559 --> 00:17:08.559
and every church throughout the church age that would read the book of Revelation,

00:17:08.559 --> 00:17:12.559
he's reminding them that we can't just go off and do our own thing

00:17:12.559 --> 00:17:15.559
and do our own work the way that we want to do it.

00:17:15.559 --> 00:17:20.559
No, God loves us and he's going to chasten. He's going to rebuke.

00:17:20.559 --> 00:17:23.559
I made this comment not long ago,

00:17:23.559 --> 00:17:28.559
and the reality is that when God is going to work in our lives

00:17:28.559 --> 00:17:33.559
and he's bringing some level in our lives using his word to convict us,

00:17:33.559 --> 00:17:39.559
that conviction is good. It's good for us.

00:17:39.559 --> 00:17:44.559
Notice with me in Proverbs chapter 3, if you will,

00:17:44.559 --> 00:17:50.559
we'll look at just a few verses where this progressive truth is given to us through the Bible.

00:17:51.559 --> 00:17:54.559
In Proverbs chapter 3, and when you think of that chapter,

00:17:54.559 --> 00:17:58.559
no doubt your mind races to verses 5 and 6.

00:17:58.559 --> 00:18:03.559
But I want to remind you that in Proverbs chapter 3, verses 11 and 12,

00:18:03.559 --> 00:18:09.559
notice what God tells us.

00:18:09.559 --> 00:18:11.559
Proverbs 3 and verse 11,

00:18:11.559 --> 00:18:31.559
Notice Psalm 94, if you will.

00:18:31.559 --> 00:18:37.559
Psalm 94 and verse number 12, we know that the psalmist says it this way,

00:18:37.559 --> 00:18:40.559
dealing with the truth of the chastening of the Lord.

00:18:40.559 --> 00:18:42.559
I'll read verse 11 along with it.

00:18:42.559 --> 00:18:45.559
Psalm 94, verse 11 and verse number 12.

00:18:45.559 --> 00:18:47.559
The Bible says this in verse 11.

00:18:47.559 --> 00:18:51.559
The Lord knoweth the thoughts of man that they are vanity.

00:18:51.559 --> 00:18:54.559
God knows your thoughts. He knows my thoughts.

00:18:54.559 --> 00:18:58.559
Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O Lord,

00:18:58.559 --> 00:19:02.559
and teachest him out of thy law,

00:19:02.559 --> 00:19:05.559
that thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity

00:19:05.559 --> 00:19:08.559
until the pit be digged for the wicked.

00:19:08.559 --> 00:19:12.559
Think about this. It says, blessed is the man whom thou chastenest.

00:19:12.559 --> 00:19:17.559
We ought to start thanking God for the chastening of God, the correction of God.

00:19:17.559 --> 00:19:21.559
He says here to the church of the Laodiceans that who he loves,

00:19:21.559 --> 00:19:23.559
he rebukes and he chastens.

00:19:23.559 --> 00:19:25.559
Look in Hebrews chapter 12, if you will.

00:19:25.559 --> 00:19:28.559
And it's a familiar passage of scripture here.

00:19:28.559 --> 00:19:32.559
In fact, a number of years ago when we had as our theme counter blessings

00:19:32.559 --> 00:19:39.559
and throughout that calendar year, I preached messages on reasons to rejoice.

00:19:39.559 --> 00:19:41.559
And we had all sorts of reasons to rejoice.

00:19:41.559 --> 00:19:46.559
It was a very topical type of a study throughout that calendar year.

00:19:46.559 --> 00:19:52.559
And near the end of the year, I said that we ought to learn to rejoice for the chastening of God.

00:19:52.559 --> 00:19:56.559
And I preached from this passage of scripture in Hebrews chapter 12.

00:19:56.559 --> 00:19:58.559
In verse number four, the Bible says this,

00:19:58.559 --> 00:20:00.559
you have not yet resisted unto blood's trials,

00:20:00.559 --> 00:20:06.639
against sin, and you've forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children.

00:20:06.639 --> 00:20:10.919
My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked

00:20:10.919 --> 00:20:12.159
of him.

00:20:12.159 --> 00:20:19.159
For whom the Lord loveth, he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.

00:20:19.159 --> 00:20:23.479
If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons.

00:20:23.479 --> 00:20:27.839
For what son is he whom the Father chasteneth not?"

00:20:27.839 --> 00:20:32.319
You know, it's really a birthmark of a believer that God would chasten us.

00:20:32.319 --> 00:20:38.959
You know, it's an evidence of your salvation that God chastens you, that God doesn't just

00:20:38.959 --> 00:20:43.919
leave you to do whatever you want to do and lean on your own understanding and go down

00:20:43.919 --> 00:20:44.919
your own path.

00:20:44.919 --> 00:20:47.239
No, God will deal with you.

00:20:47.239 --> 00:20:49.879
He will chasten you.

00:20:49.879 --> 00:20:54.719
I believe that as you look in the passage, it says this in verse 8, but if ye be without

00:20:54.719 --> 00:21:02.359
chastisement whereof all are partakers, what a great parenthetical statement by the way,

00:21:02.359 --> 00:21:06.720
we're all partakers, then are ye bastards and not sons.

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:07.720
What's he saying?

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:12.799
Well, the Lord only chastens those that are his.

00:21:12.799 --> 00:21:16.439
Sometimes if we're not careful, we can be like Asaph and say, look at the wicked, look

00:21:16.439 --> 00:21:21.680
at how they're living, look at how they're prospering, why aren't they facing?

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:26.799
God says, they're not my children, they're not my children.

00:21:26.799 --> 00:21:31.879
I chasten my own, I chasten my own.

00:21:31.879 --> 00:21:38.639
He says in verse 9, furthermore, we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and

00:21:38.639 --> 00:21:39.799
we gave them reverence.

00:21:39.799 --> 00:21:41.439
What is the author doing?

00:21:41.439 --> 00:21:46.639
He's helping us understand this spiritual truth by relating it to a natural, a physical

00:21:46.639 --> 00:21:48.279
truth, a reality.

00:21:48.279 --> 00:21:51.239
I remember I was corrected as a child.

00:21:51.239 --> 00:21:54.559
By the way, I responded to the correction of my own parents.

00:21:54.559 --> 00:22:00.559
I wouldn't respond well to correction from someone that wasn't my parent.

00:22:00.559 --> 00:22:05.439
I'm not talking in a rebellious way, I'm somebody that wanted to treat me like I was their child.

00:22:05.439 --> 00:22:11.160
I don't go around disciplining your children because they're not my children, amen?

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:18.039
And here we find that he says using this illustration and helping to drive home the point, he says

00:22:18.039 --> 00:22:23.720
that we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence.

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:29.319
Shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and live?

00:22:29.319 --> 00:22:33.199
For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure.

00:22:33.199 --> 00:22:41.239
But notice this phrase, he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness.

00:22:41.239 --> 00:22:44.599
Now, no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous.

00:22:44.599 --> 00:22:48.720
Listen, if you've ever experienced the chastening hand of God, you will agree wholeheartedly

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:51.399
with verse number 11.

00:22:51.399 --> 00:22:53.759
It's not joyous.

00:22:53.759 --> 00:22:57.800
We take that step back and we say, oh God, thank you for dealing with me.

00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:59.179
Thank you for correcting me.

00:22:59.179 --> 00:23:05.599
Thank you for that conviction, the work of the Holy Spirit in your life and in my life.

00:23:05.599 --> 00:23:11.199
He says, but grievous nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness

00:23:11.199 --> 00:23:15.479
unto them which are exercised thereby.

00:23:15.479 --> 00:23:20.800
God says to these, he refers to the church of the Laodiceans.

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:22.279
He says, I counsel thee.

00:23:22.279 --> 00:23:23.800
We note the counsel.

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:25.059
We note the chastening.

00:23:25.059 --> 00:23:30.440
He says, as many as I love, I rebuke and chasten.

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:36.080
For this evening, how do we deal with God when he rebukes us, when he chastens us?

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:37.959
How do we respond to that?

00:23:37.959 --> 00:23:39.559
Do we respond properly?

00:23:39.559 --> 00:23:43.619
Do we respond well?

00:23:43.619 --> 00:23:48.839
As we look at the remainder of verse 19 and down through the chapter, I note this number

00:23:48.839 --> 00:23:51.720
three, the choice.

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:54.479
Why do I call it the choice?

00:23:54.479 --> 00:23:59.279
Well in verse number 19, excuse me, in verse number 18, he says, I counsel thee.

00:23:59.279 --> 00:24:04.520
But in verse number 19, to end the verse, he says, be zealous therefore and repent.

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:07.119
Now that's a choice that everyone has to make.

00:24:07.119 --> 00:24:08.979
It's a choice.

00:24:08.979 --> 00:24:13.619
Are we going to receive and respond properly to the counsel?

00:24:13.619 --> 00:24:16.020
The counsel is given.

00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:18.619
By the way, it's perfect counsel.

00:24:18.619 --> 00:24:20.940
It's good counsel.

00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:25.019
It's the Lord Jesus Christ, the amen, what he says is so.

00:24:25.019 --> 00:24:27.820
And he says, I counsel thee.

00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:31.679
And then he says, be zealous therefore and repent.

00:24:31.679 --> 00:24:36.559
Can I tell you this evening that God is not going to force the people in Laodicea, he's

00:24:36.559 --> 00:24:39.919
not going to force you and he's not going to force me to repent.

00:24:39.919 --> 00:24:42.440
It's a choice that you make.

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:45.179
It's a choice that you make.

00:24:45.179 --> 00:24:52.079
If you follow down and continue the path of disobedience and self-reliance and self-sufficiency,

00:24:52.079 --> 00:24:54.720
you will continue to lose the blessing of God.

00:24:54.720 --> 00:25:00.279
You will continue to deal with the chastening of the Lord.

00:25:00.279 --> 00:25:06.919
And the reality is that the Bible tells us in 1 Corinthians chapter 11 that some die

00:25:06.919 --> 00:25:10.639
because they don't respond to the chastening of God.

00:25:10.639 --> 00:25:13.079
For this cause, many are asleep.

00:25:13.079 --> 00:25:16.200
Does that not what the Bible tells us?

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:20.480
And so we find this evening that he says, be zealous therefore and repent.

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:23.639
But you know that he's not going to force you to repent.

00:25:23.639 --> 00:25:29.480
He didn't force you to get saved and he's not going to force you to repent.

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:30.480
He counsels you to.

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:32.519
It's a choice that you must make.

00:25:32.519 --> 00:25:34.079
It's a choice that I must make.

00:25:34.079 --> 00:25:35.359
Am I going to go God's way?

00:25:35.359 --> 00:25:36.600
Am I going to follow God's path?

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:38.639
Am I going to follow God's counsel?

00:25:38.639 --> 00:25:41.880
Or am I going to just continue to do things my way?

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:43.880
Am I going to continue to lean on my own understanding?

00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:50.480
Am I going to continue to enjoy this temporal level of benefit and of comfort?

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:53.919
Am I going to do things God's way?

00:25:53.919 --> 00:25:56.799
There's a choice to be made.

00:25:56.799 --> 00:25:59.279
And we see it in verse 18 and verse 19.

00:25:59.279 --> 00:26:01.760
We see it again in verse number 20.

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:05.279
Notice with me in verse 20, I alluded to this verse last week.

00:26:05.279 --> 00:26:10.160
And so often it's a verse that's used within the context of talking with lost people and

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:15.320
maybe in a soul winning type of a conversation.

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:20.639
But the reality is that contextually, it has absolutely nothing to do with that.

00:26:20.639 --> 00:26:25.200
Is everything to do with the head of the church, the Lord Jesus Christ, standing on the outside

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:26.760
of his church?

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:30.600
No, he purchased the church with his own blood, did he not?

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:32.119
Acts chapter 20.

00:26:32.119 --> 00:26:33.119
He's the rightful owner.

00:26:33.119 --> 00:26:34.679
What did he say in Matthew 16?

00:26:34.679 --> 00:26:36.279
I will build your church?

00:26:36.279 --> 00:26:38.600
Is that what he said?

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:43.519
No, he said, I will build my church, amen?

00:26:43.519 --> 00:26:44.880
He's the head of the church.

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:46.500
It's his rightful place.

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:51.239
And we find this evening that in verse number 20, he, Jesus, the one that is the head of

00:26:51.239 --> 00:26:56.320
the church, the one who purchased it with his own blood, he said, I stand at the door

00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:59.760
and knock.

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:04.440
What is the picture that's being given to the people of Laodicea?

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:07.079
The picture is that Jesus is on the outside.

00:27:07.079 --> 00:27:12.279
Listen, if you're on the inside and others are on the inside, you're not knocking on

00:27:12.279 --> 00:27:13.720
the door.

00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:20.000
He's on the outside of his own church and he's knocking on the door and he says, I stand

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.320
at the door and knock.

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:26.720
Do you see his patient pursuit of his people?

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:29.200
He loves us.

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:32.579
He created us to have fellowship with him.

00:27:32.579 --> 00:27:36.940
He wants us to be in his presence because in his presence is fullness of joy, but he

00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:40.700
never forces himself upon us.

00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:43.359
We make decisions.

00:27:43.359 --> 00:27:45.540
Obviously we're here this evening on a Sunday evening.

00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:51.239
We made a decision of our own will to come and to worship together and we make those

00:27:51.239 --> 00:27:52.239
decisions.

00:27:52.239 --> 00:27:56.600
You made a decision today on whether you were going to spend time with God and his word

00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:57.600
or not.

00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:00.799
You're going to make a decision tomorrow on whether you're going to spend time with God

00:28:00.799 --> 00:28:07.160
and his word or not and the reality is that God doesn't force us to.

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:09.399
He wants us to.

00:28:09.399 --> 00:28:14.600
It's as if he's waiting there for us and will you stop and will you fellowship with me or

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:22.799
we hurry through our day and just go along and just do things our way and he says I stand

00:28:22.799 --> 00:28:25.079
at the door and knock.

00:28:25.079 --> 00:28:33.440
If any man hear my voice and notice this, this is the choice and open the door and open

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:34.440
the door.

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:38.559
Have you ever had somebody come to your door and you didn't want to open it?

00:28:38.559 --> 00:28:39.559
Come on.

00:28:39.559 --> 00:28:42.080
Listen, we go door knocking.

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:48.760
If you have a ring camera, I wish that company didn't exist.

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:49.760
You know why?

00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:52.400
No one wants to answer their door when we knock on their door.

00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:55.440
They got this ring camera and they see us at the door.

00:28:55.440 --> 00:29:00.559
They don't know who we are and they say, if they say, can I help you?

00:29:00.559 --> 00:29:01.799
Yeah, I'm Chris.

00:29:01.799 --> 00:29:05.440
This is whoever I'm with and we're from Fellowship Baptist Church just out in the area visiting

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:07.440
some folks and not interested.

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:12.520
You don't even have an opportunity to talk to them.

00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:21.719
But before they had ring cameras, somebody knock on your door, shh, be quiet.

00:29:21.719 --> 00:29:26.919
Don't let them know we're home, you deceiver, right?

00:29:26.919 --> 00:29:27.919
Why?

00:29:27.919 --> 00:29:31.340
Because you didn't want to open the door.

00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:33.479
I've gone to doors that have these signs.

00:29:33.479 --> 00:29:34.840
Some of them just say no soliciting.

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:40.080
We joked about a neighborhood we were in just a few weeks ago and I said, I think someone

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:43.679
was going door to door to sell no soliciting signs.

00:29:43.679 --> 00:29:47.520
Because it seemed like we got into this one stretch of this neighborhood and every single

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:49.960
door had a no soliciting sign on it.

00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:51.880
And I thought somebody was selling those things, man.

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:54.080
They were selling them door to door, amen?

00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:55.799
And here's the deal.

00:29:55.799 --> 00:29:59.080
I've seen signs that say, I already have a vacuum.

00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:00.559
I already know Jesus.

00:30:00.559 --> 00:30:02.039
I already have insurance.

00:30:02.039 --> 00:30:03.159
I already have whatever.

00:30:03.159 --> 00:30:04.879
And they got all those things listed out

00:30:04.879 --> 00:30:07.239
of people that would normally go door to door.

00:30:07.239 --> 00:30:09.239
Do any of you remember when guys would go,

00:30:09.239 --> 00:30:11.719
Hoover guys go and sell, right?

00:30:11.719 --> 00:30:14.439
The, Kimberly, your dad used to sell Rainbow, right?

00:30:14.439 --> 00:30:15.679
It's a vacuum cleaner.

00:30:15.679 --> 00:30:16.499
I have one.

00:30:16.499 --> 00:30:17.339
It's a great vacuum cleaner.

00:30:17.339 --> 00:30:19.259
But they would literally kind of go door to door

00:30:19.259 --> 00:30:21.119
to try to sell their product.

00:30:21.119 --> 00:30:22.799
And so these signs say, I already have a vacuum.

00:30:22.799 --> 00:30:24.639
It just makes me laugh when I see it.

00:30:25.759 --> 00:30:28.939
But what I'm saying is that you have to open the door.

00:30:30.639 --> 00:30:32.719
Jesus, the God of the universe,

00:30:32.719 --> 00:30:36.219
the one who the preacher preached about this morning

00:30:36.219 --> 00:30:39.479
that is worthy, the one who created us,

00:30:39.479 --> 00:30:41.159
the one who has redeemed us,

00:30:41.159 --> 00:30:43.999
he stands at the door and he knocks and he says,

00:30:43.999 --> 00:30:46.159
if any man notice, he says,

00:30:46.159 --> 00:30:48.699
if they hear my voice and open the door,

00:30:48.699 --> 00:30:51.199
notice the wonderful fellowship.

00:30:51.199 --> 00:30:56.199
I will come into him and will sup with him and he with me.

00:30:57.039 --> 00:31:02.039
Wow, now on the flip side,

00:31:02.639 --> 00:31:06.579
have you ever been anxiously awaiting someone's arrival?

00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:10.360
I mean, you knew that a visitor was coming,

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:13.680
maybe it was a relative and before the day of GPS

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:15.439
and when they could send their notification

00:31:15.439 --> 00:31:18.279
and let you know with quite precision

00:31:18.279 --> 00:31:20.159
as to the time of their arrival,

00:31:20.159 --> 00:31:23.079
you would be anxiously awaiting their arrival, why?

00:31:23.079 --> 00:31:24.639
Because you wanted to open the door.

00:31:24.639 --> 00:31:27.040
It was almost as if they didn't even have to knock

00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:30.239
at the door because you were ready for their arrival.

00:31:32.439 --> 00:31:36.360
This evening, the Church of the Laodiceans,

00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:39.720
every church has a choice to make.

00:31:40.799 --> 00:31:43.659
We make choices every day, don't we?

00:31:45.379 --> 00:31:46.720
I said this to someone two weeks,

00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:50.439
no decision is still a decision.

00:31:51.439 --> 00:31:56.439
No response is still a response, right?

00:31:57.959 --> 00:31:59.199
It really is.

00:31:59.199 --> 00:32:02.000
You dig into that and you think about that.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:07.000
We find here, this church, they received counsel.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000
They were dealing with chastening.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.300
They had a choice to make.

00:32:15.119 --> 00:32:17.479
It's unfortunate, but God's word talks about the fact

00:32:17.479 --> 00:32:20.039
that we can grieve and quench the Holy Spirit.

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:24.419
We can grieve and we can quench the Holy Spirit,

00:32:25.279 --> 00:32:28.360
where we ought to be sensitive to the voice of God.

00:32:29.199 --> 00:32:32.599
We ought to be sensitive to his chastening in our lives

00:32:32.599 --> 00:32:35.119
and his counsel and his correction

00:32:35.119 --> 00:32:39.419
and that we ought to be quick to take heed to the counsel

00:32:39.419 --> 00:32:42.160
because counsel is only profitable

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:44.039
when we take heed to the counsel.

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:49.139
And this is good counsel because it's God's counsel.

00:32:49.979 --> 00:32:53.660
We find the promise again that's mentioned in verse 21

00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:55.500
that we've seen with many of these churches

00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:57.899
with regard to having victory

00:32:57.899 --> 00:33:00.619
into the millennial reign of Christ.

00:33:00.619 --> 00:33:03.860
And then it ends with that familiar verse

00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:05.779
that we've seen with each of these churches.

00:33:05.779 --> 00:33:09.419
He that hath an ear, let him hear

00:33:09.419 --> 00:33:12.699
what the Spirit saith unto the churches.

00:33:12.699 --> 00:33:16.940
Not only do we need to hear, but we need to do.

00:33:17.779 --> 00:33:20.860
Be doers of the word and not hearers only.

00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:24.179
Take a lesson from the church of the Laodiceans.

00:33:24.179 --> 00:33:27.979
As we spent these two weeks looking at these various aspects

00:33:27.979 --> 00:33:30.380
God tells them, here's your true condition.

00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:35.819
And then in his great love and his wisdom,

00:33:35.819 --> 00:33:37.720
he says, I'm gonna give you a counsel.

00:33:38.819 --> 00:33:40.739
Let me give you a counsel.

00:33:40.739 --> 00:33:43.619
By the way, the sooner we take heed to the counsel,

00:33:43.619 --> 00:33:45.979
the less chastening we have to experience.

00:33:47.059 --> 00:33:48.220
Amen?

00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:49.699
Is that not true for your children

00:33:49.699 --> 00:33:51.639
or for you when you were a child?

00:33:51.639 --> 00:33:52.479
Amen?

00:33:52.479 --> 00:33:55.580
If you do it again, here's what's gonna happen.

00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:57.099
Did any of you ever hear that as a child?

00:33:57.099 --> 00:33:58.239
I heard it.

00:33:58.239 --> 00:34:00.220
I think my dad's watching live stream tonight.

00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:02.720
He didn't even have to say the words, he just did this.

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:05.500
And I knew that this meant if you do it again,

00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:06.399
it's a problem.

00:34:09.259 --> 00:34:10.099
I did.

00:34:10.979 --> 00:34:13.739
And so the sooner I corrected my behavior,

00:34:14.739 --> 00:34:18.260
the sooner I took heed to the counsel,

00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:20.619
no more chastening.

00:34:22.899 --> 00:34:26.380
I'm thankful that God loves us enough to chasten us,

00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:28.980
but oh, that we'd respond to his counsel

00:34:29.899 --> 00:34:32.019
and that we'd make the right choice,

00:34:32.019 --> 00:34:37.019
that we'd repent and that we would open the door,

00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:41.139
have that fellowship with him, that sweet communion.

00:34:41.139 --> 00:34:42.540
What a joy.

00:34:42.579 --> 00:34:45.019
The God of the universe,

00:34:45.019 --> 00:34:47.660
the one who spoke it all into existence,

00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:49.179
the one who knows everything,

00:34:49.179 --> 00:34:51.660
he wants to have fellowship with you.

00:34:52.899 --> 00:34:54.079
Man, it's amazing.

00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:59.279
Oh, that God would help us to learn from the message

00:34:59.279 --> 00:35:01.419
that was given to the Church of the Laodiceans.

00:35:01.419 --> 00:35:02.239
Let us pray.

00:35:02.239 --> 00:35:03.119
Lord, we love you.

00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:05.380
Thank you for loving us.

00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:08.579
Thank you, God, for your word.

00:35:08.579 --> 00:35:11.459
I pray, Lord, that you would help us

00:35:11.459 --> 00:35:13.980
to be doers of the word and not hearers only.

00:35:15.019 --> 00:35:17.540
God, I pray that if there's some area in our lives

00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:18.459
where we have

00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:25.820
gotten self-sufficient, self-reliant,

00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:27.100
deceived,

00:35:28.299 --> 00:35:29.139
carnal,

00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:31.459
worldly,

00:35:31.459 --> 00:35:32.299
temporal,

00:35:33.299 --> 00:35:34.820
God, would you help us

00:35:37.059 --> 00:35:38.739
to take heed to the counsel,

00:35:39.739 --> 00:35:42.100
to make the right choice?

00:35:43.899 --> 00:35:47.260
God, you would help us to live in such a way

00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:49.059
that you'd be honored and glorified.

00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:52.059
Would you move and work in these moments of invitation

00:35:52.059 --> 00:35:52.940
as only you can?

00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:54.299
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:35:54.299 --> 00:35:55.139
Would you stand?
