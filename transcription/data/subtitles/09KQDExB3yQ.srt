1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,700
verses this evening from Genesis chapter 49.

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,380
And I had mentioned to someone this afternoon,

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:07,820
I said it this morning as well,

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:09,020
that I had planned to go through

5
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:10,739
the whole chapter this evening.

6
00:00:10,739 --> 00:00:12,819
And then I got into studying it and said,

7
00:00:12,819 --> 00:00:15,060
there's no way we're getting through the whole chapter.

8
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,739
And we're just getting near the end of our study

9
00:00:17,739 --> 00:00:19,139
through the book of Genesis.

10
00:00:19,139 --> 00:00:22,139
In fact, this is message number 98.

11
00:00:22,139 --> 00:00:24,500
And so if you've been with me through the whole process

12
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,680
of studying through the book of Genesis,

13
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:30,139
we are near the end and we're not quite there yet,

14
00:00:30,139 --> 00:00:31,819
but we are getting close.

15
00:00:31,819 --> 00:00:33,659
I wanna read just a few verses to you,

16
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:35,540
verses one and two and then verse number 28

17
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,740
before we dig into the text this evening.

18
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,139
The Bible says in Genesis 49 and verse number one,

19
00:00:40,139 --> 00:00:43,740
and Jacob called unto his sons and said,

20
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:47,220
gather yourselves together that I may tell you

21
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:51,740
that which shall befall you, notice, in the last days.

22
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,299
Gather yourselves together and hear,

23
00:00:55,319 --> 00:00:59,840
ye sons of Jacob and hearken unto Israel, your father.

24
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,720
Skip down if you will and look at verse 28.

25
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:06,199
The Bible says this, all these are the 12 tribes of Israel.

26
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:09,599
And this is it that their father spake unto them

27
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:11,599
and blessed them.

28
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:16,239
Everyone according to his blessing, he blessed them.

29
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:18,080
As we look at this portion of scripture,

30
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,519
we are mindful of the fact that Jacob's life

31
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:22,480
is coming to an end.

32
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,680
In fact, it's at the end of this chapter

33
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:28,419
that God records for us the death of Jacob.

34
00:01:28,419 --> 00:01:31,580
By the way, as we consider that truth this evening,

35
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:35,059
that day is going to come for each and every one of us,

36
00:01:35,059 --> 00:01:37,019
the day of our death, right?

37
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:40,459
That's going to happen and we understand that.

38
00:01:40,459 --> 00:01:43,220
And so we find that prior to the death,

39
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,220
Jacob, of course, we looked the last time in chapter 48

40
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:50,139
as he spoke with Joseph and had Ephraim and Manasseh

41
00:01:50,139 --> 00:01:52,300
before him and all that he said there.

42
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:54,839
But we come to the 49th chapter and we find that

43
00:01:54,839 --> 00:01:57,760
Jacob calls for his sons to gather themselves

44
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,680
in his presence throughout the chapter this evening

45
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,879
and over the next several Sunday evenings

46
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:05,919
as we study through Genesis 49,

47
00:02:05,919 --> 00:02:07,580
we will note several things.

48
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:11,520
Number one, we will note the purpose of this gathering.

49
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,119
And as we consider the purpose and recall

50
00:02:16,119 --> 00:02:19,880
what is taking place as God has recorded it for us,

51
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,740
we will see clearly the purpose of the gathering.

52
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,139
We find not only the purpose,

53
00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:27,520
but we find that there's a process that is followed.

54
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,740
And as we look at the purpose and the process,

55
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:35,740
we also see the prophetic view that is given to us.

56
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:38,100
You notice I mentioned at the end of verse number one

57
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:43,100
that it says, that which shall befall you in the last days.

58
00:02:43,339 --> 00:02:46,300
There were some things that would be soon fulfilled,

59
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,100
but there's many things within Genesis 49

60
00:02:49,119 --> 00:02:52,440
that look even still today to the future.

61
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,320
And we'll note that as we study

62
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,119
through the portion of scripture.

63
00:02:56,119 --> 00:02:57,759
What a scene this is.

64
00:02:58,839 --> 00:03:00,380
I want you to think about the scene.

65
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,720
As we kind of enter into the room with Jacob,

66
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,600
he's dying, he knows that he's on his deathbed

67
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,279
and he calls for his sons to gather themselves together

68
00:03:09,279 --> 00:03:11,000
to enter into his presence.

69
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,720
We find that each son will stand before their father.

70
00:03:15,619 --> 00:03:18,699
We find that the father Jacob here

71
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:19,940
in this portion of scripture,

72
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:22,539
he has his 12 boys and one by one,

73
00:03:22,539 --> 00:03:24,179
they will stand before him and he'll begin

74
00:03:24,179 --> 00:03:25,820
to say certain things,

75
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,199
some that are more lengthy than others

76
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:32,500
and some that are more of a blessing than others.

77
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,520
And we find that in this text of scripture,

78
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,300
we will consider a few things.

79
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,899
Again, over the next several weeks,

80
00:03:37,899 --> 00:03:40,940
we'll consider some with regard to the principle

81
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,279
of sowing and reaping.

82
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:44,820
Sowing and reaping.

83
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:49,059
Not only that, but we'll see how some receive a reward

84
00:03:49,059 --> 00:03:51,500
while others suffer loss.

85
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,119
I want you to think about that phraseology.

86
00:03:53,119 --> 00:03:56,500
I chose it on purpose because there's coming a day,

87
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,259
not that we'll stand before our earthly father,

88
00:03:59,259 --> 00:04:01,899
but we'll stand before our heavenly judge,

89
00:04:01,899 --> 00:04:03,259
the Lord Jesus Christ,

90
00:04:03,259 --> 00:04:05,899
and we'll stand before him at the judgment seat of Christ.

91
00:04:05,899 --> 00:04:08,899
And this is not the same as the judgment seat of Christ,

92
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:11,440
but certainly gives us that image,

93
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,320
that idea of what's happening.

94
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,200
And we find that as we look at this portion of scripture,

95
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,640
again, there's a clear purpose.

96
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,040
We find that there's a process that is followed

97
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,179
and there's definitely a view of prophetic statement

98
00:04:27,179 --> 00:04:29,160
that is given throughout the text.

99
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,559
Tonight, Lord willing, we'll look at Reuben,

100
00:04:31,559 --> 00:04:34,079
Simeon, Levi, and Judah.

101
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:36,679
We'll look at four of the sons that are mentioned

102
00:04:36,679 --> 00:04:38,260
beginning in verse number three.

103
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:40,239
I've titled the message, you see it there on the bulletin,

104
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:42,320
Jacob blesses his sons, part one.

105
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,000
And the points are really just the names of the sons.

106
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,160
All right, so number one, Reuben.

107
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,519
In verses three and four,

108
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:52,859
we read where Reuben stands before Jacob.

109
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:54,640
Notice the Bible says in verse number three,

110
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,299
Reuben, thou art my firstborn,

111
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:01,700
my might, the beginning of my strength,

112
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,480
the excellency of dignity,

113
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,700
and the excellency of power,

114
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,079
colon.

115
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:11,040
I think he wishes there was a period.

116
00:05:12,799 --> 00:05:15,200
Do you understand what I mean?

117
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,559
Because up to this point, it sounds pretty good.

118
00:05:17,559 --> 00:05:19,519
This is going in a good direction.

119
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:21,100
You're my firstborn.

120
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,720
You are the beginning of my strength,

121
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,880
the excellency of dignity, the excellency of power,

122
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,559
unstable as water.

123
00:05:32,239 --> 00:05:36,480
Thou shall not excel.

124
00:05:37,459 --> 00:05:42,459
Wow, how quickly the mood must change in the room.

125
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:46,820
Notice because, because why?

126
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,959
Well, remember I said we would look

127
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:50,420
and you would see some principles

128
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,100
with regard to sowing and reaping.

129
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:56,579
Because thou wentest up to thy father's bed,

130
00:05:56,579 --> 00:06:01,579
then defilest thou it, he went up to my couch.

131
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:06,299
And so as we look at this firstborn son,

132
00:06:07,119 --> 00:06:10,160
Reuben, standing before his father, Jacob,

133
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,519
we find that he mentions about his place

134
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:15,880
in the birth order, that he's his firstborn.

135
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,679
We notice and we could look in 1 Corinthians 5,

136
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:20,799
you might wanna reference it, verses one and two,

137
00:06:20,799 --> 00:06:23,839
how that his birthright was forfeited

138
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:26,640
and therefore the genealogy is not to be followed

139
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,239
after the Reuben being the firstborn.

140
00:06:29,239 --> 00:06:31,160
And we can read of that in 1 Chronicles 5

141
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,799
as the genealogy is given.

142
00:06:32,799 --> 00:06:34,519
But we notice in verse number four

143
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:39,519
that Jacob says unstable as water, thou shalt not excel.

144
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,980
Those are not words that you wanna hear.

145
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,179
Would you agree?

146
00:06:46,179 --> 00:06:48,059
I mean, these are not pleasant words.

147
00:06:48,059 --> 00:06:51,179
These are not words that one would be desiring to hear.

148
00:06:51,179 --> 00:06:54,239
But we find that as you continue to read in verse number four

149
00:06:54,239 --> 00:06:58,799
that what happens is there is sin exposed.

150
00:06:58,799 --> 00:07:00,880
We find that here in the text of Scripture,

151
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,899
something that had happened many years prior,

152
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:06,899
but evidently had never been dealt with

153
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:09,880
is now being exposed.

154
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,820
I would say that it seems as you read the Scriptures

155
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:16,700
that there's never a time in recorded Scripture

156
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:20,820
where Reuben has any level of brokenness or repentance.

157
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:24,540
And we find that this sin that had happened many years ago

158
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:28,299
is now being referenced and discussed

159
00:07:28,299 --> 00:07:30,779
at this last meeting with his father.

160
00:07:30,779 --> 00:07:32,700
The sin that is being spoken of

161
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:36,660
is the sin that's recorded in Genesis 35 and verse number 22.

162
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:40,100
It says that because thou wentest up to thy father's bed.

163
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:43,019
And we read in Genesis 35 and verse 22

164
00:07:43,019 --> 00:07:44,420
where the Bible says this,

165
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:47,019
and it came to pass when Israel dwelt in the land

166
00:07:47,019 --> 00:07:50,220
that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah,

167
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,760
his father's concubine, and Israel heard it.

168
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,540
Now the sons of Jacob were 12.

169
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:58,640
And so Israel heard, he knew about it,

170
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,820
but there's no record that anything was ever done.

171
00:08:01,859 --> 00:08:03,579
So we find now as Reuben,

172
00:08:03,579 --> 00:08:05,019
maybe something that he thought,

173
00:08:05,019 --> 00:08:07,619
man, I didn't really have any consequences.

174
00:08:07,619 --> 00:08:10,700
You know, sometimes sin has an immediate consequence

175
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,380
in your life.

176
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:15,179
Sometimes, however, you know, sowing and reaping,

177
00:08:15,179 --> 00:08:17,380
you don't always reap the day after you sow.

178
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:22,059
Many times, in fact, there's a long period of time.

179
00:08:22,059 --> 00:08:25,100
And we find that now as he's standing there

180
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,640
in the presence of his father,

181
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,260
that this act that had taken place many years prior

182
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,859
is brought up.

183
00:08:31,859 --> 00:08:35,479
But I want you to consider the way in which Jacob says

184
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:40,479
to Reuben, unstable as water, thou shalt not excel.

185
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:43,559
And when we consider that statement,

186
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,979
I want you to think about the Reubenites, if you will,

187
00:08:45,979 --> 00:08:47,940
as a tribe just for a moment.

188
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,380
And I'm gonna reference some passages of Scripture,

189
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,580
some verses of Scripture.

190
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:55,039
We're not necessarily gonna turn to all of them

191
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,419
for sake of time.

192
00:08:56,419 --> 00:08:58,859
But I want you to understand that in number 16

193
00:08:58,859 --> 00:09:02,859
in verse number one, and we will turn and read that.

194
00:09:02,859 --> 00:09:05,099
In number 16 in verse number one,

195
00:09:05,099 --> 00:09:09,260
God tells us about a rebellion that takes place.

196
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,799
And we find that the Bible tells us

197
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:14,280
of this rebellion of Korah.

198
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,179
Now notice in number 16 in verse number one,

199
00:09:17,179 --> 00:09:20,900
again, Jacob says to Reuben, unstable as water,

200
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,739
thou shalt not excel.

201
00:09:22,739 --> 00:09:26,200
It seems as if the only time there's any reference

202
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,000
in Scripture where any of the Reubenites rose up

203
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,520
to lead in any capacity would be this,

204
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,039
and it's a bad account.

205
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,679
The Bible says in verse number one,

206
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:39,239
now Korah, the son of Ishar, the son of Kohath,

207
00:09:39,239 --> 00:09:41,760
the son of Levi, and Daphan, and Abiram,

208
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,239
the sons of Eliab, and on the son of Peleth,

209
00:09:44,239 --> 00:09:47,280
sons of Reuben, took men.

210
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,000
And they rose up before Moses

211
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,479
with certain of the children of Israel,

212
00:09:50,479 --> 00:09:52,479
250 princes of the assembly,

213
00:09:52,479 --> 00:09:55,460
famous in the congregation, men of renown.

214
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,340
So these sons of Reuben, we find that are mentioned here

215
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,179
in verse number.

216
00:10:00,179 --> 00:10:07,819
chapter 16, there's some level of leading with regard to this rebellion that is recorded

217
00:10:07,819 --> 00:10:08,979
in number 16.

218
00:10:08,979 --> 00:10:15,459
By the way, this rebellion resulted in the lives of many thousands of people destroyed.

219
00:10:15,459 --> 00:10:20,459
Rebellion against God's man, Moses, and God's plan.

220
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:23,699
By the way, I said it this morning, God chose David.

221
00:10:23,699 --> 00:10:29,499
David didn't desire, he didn't say, I'm volunteering, I submitted my application for the job.

222
00:10:29,499 --> 00:10:32,699
And God chose Moses, amen?

223
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:36,699
And here there's rebellion that creeps in and we find that.

224
00:10:36,699 --> 00:10:41,339
I want you to also consider when you think about the tribe of Reuben, Reuben was the

225
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:48,499
first tribe to make the request to Moses to settle on the east side of the Jordan.

226
00:10:48,499 --> 00:10:52,299
They were the ones that they saw the land and said, hey, this is good for us.

227
00:10:52,299 --> 00:10:58,339
They settled not for what God had intended for them to have, but they settled for what

228
00:10:58,339 --> 00:10:59,619
was convenient.

229
00:10:59,619 --> 00:11:04,139
They asked, you could turn over to Numbers 32 and you could see how they settled on

230
00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:05,899
the east side of Jordan.

231
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:09,619
Reuben, Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh.

232
00:11:09,619 --> 00:11:12,339
So Reuben is the one that first makes that request.

233
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:17,579
Reuben is the tribe that is first taken into Assyrian captivity.

234
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:22,699
In 1 Chronicles 5 and verse 26, we'll note that passage of scripture in 1 Chronicles

235
00:11:22,699 --> 00:11:30,819
5, and it's sad because we can read with regard to the, of course, the nation of Israel

236
00:11:30,819 --> 00:11:34,219
going into captivity and the nation of Judah going into captivity.

237
00:11:34,219 --> 00:11:39,979
But here in 1 Chronicles 5 and verse 26, it begins to record for us the captivity of the

238
00:11:39,979 --> 00:11:44,739
two and a half tribes that are on the east side of the Jordan.

239
00:11:44,739 --> 00:11:49,939
It's really recorded in verses 23 through 26, and in verse number 26 it says, or verse

240
00:11:49,939 --> 00:11:54,979
25, it says, they transgressed against the God of their fathers and went a whoring after

241
00:11:54,979 --> 00:11:59,419
the gods of the people of the land whom God destroyed before them.

242
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:03,539
The God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Paul, king of Assyria, and the spirit of Tilgath

243
00:12:03,539 --> 00:12:09,139
Pilneser, king of Assyria, and he carried them away, even, notice the Reubenites, the

244
00:12:09,139 --> 00:12:14,779
Gadites, the half tribe of Manasseh, and brought them unto Hala and Habor and Hara and to the

245
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:18,419
river Gozan unto this day.

246
00:12:18,419 --> 00:12:25,739
And so we read here of this tribe, the tribe of Reuben, that stands first before Jacob

247
00:12:25,739 --> 00:12:32,539
and Jacob says, Reuben, unstable as water, thou shalt not excel.

248
00:12:32,539 --> 00:12:39,579
As you study the history of Israel, you really see the prophetic statement come to pass.

249
00:12:39,579 --> 00:12:42,299
There's no excelling within the tribe of Reuben.

250
00:12:42,299 --> 00:12:44,259
And we see that they're taken into captivity.

251
00:12:44,259 --> 00:12:46,139
They had requested that land.

252
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:51,019
We find that the scene quickly passes and now Reuben is no longer standing before his

253
00:12:51,019 --> 00:12:56,099
father and now in verses 5 through 7 we read of Simeon and Levi.

254
00:12:56,099 --> 00:13:00,659
Simeon and Levi, it seems as if they stand before their father together as we find in

255
00:13:00,659 --> 00:13:01,659
verse number 5.

256
00:13:01,659 --> 00:13:05,619
It says, Simeon and Levi are brethren.

257
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:08,419
Instruments of cruelty are in their habitations.

258
00:13:08,419 --> 00:13:15,939
O my soul, come not thou into their secret, unto their assembly, my honor, be not thou

259
00:13:15,939 --> 00:13:17,099
united.

260
00:13:17,099 --> 00:13:23,899
For in their anger they slew a man and in their self-will they dig down a wall.

261
00:13:23,899 --> 00:13:28,899
Just as the case was with Reuben where sin was exposed in verse number 4, we find that

262
00:13:28,899 --> 00:13:33,019
as Simeon and Levi stand before Jacob and we'll get to verse 7 in just a moment, we

263
00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:39,259
find that Jacob rehearses something again that had happened many years before.

264
00:13:39,259 --> 00:13:45,059
Here for these two tribes, for these two sons that represent the tribes of Simeon and Levi,

265
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:51,500
we find that judgment is here noted due to their vicious anger in destroying the men

266
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,599
of Shechem.

267
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:59,699
We can read, we won't take the time to do so, but in Genesis chapter 34, verses 25 through

268
00:13:59,699 --> 00:14:05,259
21, you can read of that account and you can read of their anger and notice in verse

269
00:14:05,259 --> 00:14:13,259
number 7, the Bible says, cursed be their anger for it was fierce and their wrath for

270
00:14:13,259 --> 00:14:14,839
it was cruel.

271
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:20,539
Now notice what Jacob says and this is that prophetic view, if you will.

272
00:14:20,539 --> 00:14:28,579
It says this, I will divide them in Jacob and scatter them in Israel.

273
00:14:28,619 --> 00:14:34,100
So Simeon and Levi, they work together, if you will, in this situation with Shechem that's

274
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:41,940
recorded in Genesis 34 and it's exposed here in this text of Scripture and Jacob says that

275
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:47,179
they're going to be divided in Jacob and scattered in Israel.

276
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:51,059
And so we find that as we were to look at the inhabiting of the land, if you think about

277
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:56,899
this time in Israel's history, just as early on as a nation, they just have gotten to Egypt,

278
00:14:56,899 --> 00:15:01,220
they're there for 17 years, they would be in Egyptian bondage, they'd have of course

279
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:05,739
the Exodus and eventually after 40 years of the wandering in the wilderness, they would

280
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:08,259
enter into the land of promise.

281
00:15:08,259 --> 00:15:12,820
The land that God promised Abraham and we find that they would enter into that land,

282
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:18,119
they would conquer the land, they would divide the land, they would inhabit the land.

283
00:15:18,119 --> 00:15:26,339
But Simeon, their inheritance is within the boundaries of Judah.

284
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:31,220
So if you were to look at a map of the inheritance of the nation of Israel when they entered

285
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:37,919
the land, the southern part of Israel is where Judah is and within Judah, it's almost like

286
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:40,779
a perfect circle, is Simeon.

287
00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:45,639
So they have a land that is within the land, if you will, of Judah, within the inheritance

288
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:46,639
of Judah.

289
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,279
We read of that in Joshua 19 and verse number 9.

290
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:55,299
If you have Bible maps in your Bible and you look at some that are dated with regard to

291
00:15:55,299 --> 00:16:00,299
the inhabiting and the dividing of the land, you'll notice how that they are within that

292
00:16:00,299 --> 00:16:02,619
inheritance that was given to Judah.

293
00:16:02,619 --> 00:16:06,940
It's interesting when you consider Simeon, and we'll look at both of these individually

294
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:13,059
though it seems as if they stand before Jacob together, by the time in the book of Numbers

295
00:16:13,059 --> 00:16:19,779
the second census is given, which is recorded for us in Numbers 26, verse number 14 with

296
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:26,220
regard to the Simeonites specifically, you will know that by that time the size of the

297
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:31,660
tribe of Simeon decreased by over 37,000 people.

298
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,579
That's a lot of people.

299
00:16:33,579 --> 00:16:41,100
The tribe during the first census, they were counted at 59,300 and by the time of the second

300
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:45,059
census they were down to 22,200.

301
00:16:45,059 --> 00:16:47,459
Wow.

302
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:50,179
We see the decrease in Simeon.

303
00:16:50,179 --> 00:16:55,299
We see, and we'll note it in just a moment in Deuteronomy chapter 33, but it's interesting

304
00:16:55,299 --> 00:17:00,339
because in Deuteronomy chapter 33, Moses is preparing to die.

305
00:17:00,339 --> 00:17:05,059
Here in Genesis 49, Jacob is going to die and he brings all of his sons before him and

306
00:17:05,059 --> 00:17:10,500
we find that in Deuteronomy chapter 33, Moses is not going to be permitted to enter into

307
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:15,500
the land and we find that prior to his death, Moses does something interesting.

308
00:17:15,539 --> 00:17:19,779
He begins to talk about all the tribes and, you know, if you were to study Deuteronomy

309
00:17:19,779 --> 00:17:26,459
chapter 33, you'll find that there's one tribe missing from all the tribes that are mentioned

310
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:27,539
by Moses.

311
00:17:27,539 --> 00:17:30,779
That one tribe, Simeon, Simeon.

312
00:17:30,779 --> 00:17:35,100
It's not there and you study that and you begin to see and you look here how it talks

313
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,699
about being scattered.

314
00:17:37,699 --> 00:17:42,299
He says, I will divide them in Jacob and scatter them in Israel and you think about how the

315
00:17:42,619 --> 00:17:46,940
Simeonites, they really did not have that identity, if you will, of their own little

316
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:52,619
tribe and to see the decrease in their census of their population to understand that they're

317
00:17:52,619 --> 00:17:57,820
not even mentioned there by Moses in Deuteronomy 33.

318
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:04,259
Levi, we see that they're both there and again, Levi is just as guilty as Simeon with regard

319
00:18:04,259 --> 00:18:09,259
to the situation with the sons of Shechem and we read of that and understand and he

320
00:18:09,259 --> 00:18:13,539
says that they shall, I will divide them in Jacob and scatter them in Israel.

321
00:18:13,539 --> 00:18:19,019
It's interesting when you think about Levi, there's no specific inheritance for Levi.

322
00:18:19,019 --> 00:18:24,100
God is their inheritance, rather we find with regard to having a particular spot, they have

323
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:27,899
48 cities that are scattered throughout the land.

324
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:32,260
Now it's very interesting when you begin to think about and understand the history of

325
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:38,219
Israel and looking at the Old Testament, you begin to see what is said here in Genesis

326
00:18:38,219 --> 00:18:43,260
chapter 49 with regard to Simeon and Levi, but then all of a sudden when you look in

327
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:53,299
Deuteronomy chapter 33, Simeon is missing, but Levi, well Moses has some very interesting

328
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,179
things to say about Levi.

329
00:18:55,179 --> 00:19:01,820
It's really almost as if the scattering of Levi, the tribe of the Levites really turned

330
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,880
into a blessing.

331
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:08,200
We find that the scattering of Levi, the way in which they would be found throughout the

332
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:12,799
land and we'll read in just a moment there in Deuteronomy 33 and verses 10 and 11 and

333
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:17,119
to see what their duties and responsibilities were, but I'd ask this question before we

334
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:21,839
get to that point in history for the nation of Israel is what changed?

335
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:27,760
Why is it that the Simeonites that are mentioned here by Jacob, Simeon and Levi together and

336
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:33,279
the anger and cursed be their anger and I will divide them in Jacob and scatter them

337
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:37,960
in Israel and we see Simeon with this decline and really no great references whatsoever,

338
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:45,000
but then you see Levi scattered 48 cities and you find that they have really a place

339
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,559
of prominence within Israel's history.

340
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:49,559
What changed?

341
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:55,200
Well I think, I'm not certain because God doesn't say this is what changed, but turn

342
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,599
over to the book of Exodus if you will in the 32nd chapter.

343
00:19:58,599 --> 00:20:00,080
In Exodus chapter 32.

344
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,080
We find that the people are guilty.

345
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:09,080
Moses is up on the mount and the people are there

346
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:12,080
and they say to Aaron,

347
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,080
and up make us gods which shall go before us.

348
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,080
You can read that in verse number one.

349
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:21,080
And he tells them what to do and he fashions this molten calf.

350
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:24,080
And it's a wicked scene in Exodus chapter 32.

351
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,080
I mean, it's a bad situation.

352
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,080
And we find that Moses, you remember singing the song,

353
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,080
Who is on the Lord's side?

354
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,080
Amen, it's a good song, right?

355
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,080
And we are on the Lord's side, amen?

356
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,080
And it's a great song and we sing it.

357
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:40,080
It comes from this passage of scripture.

358
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,080
Notice what Moses says in verse number 26.

359
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,080
Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp and said,

360
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,080
Who is on the Lord's side?

361
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,080
Let him come unto me.

362
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,080
And what does it say?

363
00:20:52,080 --> 00:21:01,080
All the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him.

364
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:04,080
That's a good decision by the people of Levi,

365
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,080
the tribe of Levi.

366
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,080
And it says in Exodus 32 and verse 26

367
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:15,080
that all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him.

368
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:19,080
Perhaps this gives us a little insight

369
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,080
as to why in Deuteronomy chapter 33,

370
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,080
what we could look at in Genesis 49

371
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,080
as being this scattering, this judgment, if you will,

372
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,080
is really turned into a blessing

373
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,080
because of what they did.

374
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,080
They stood for right.

375
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,080
By the way, it's always right to stand for right.

376
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,080
Amen?

377
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,080
Who is on the Lord's side?

378
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,080
Listen, I'd rather be on the Lord's side

379
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,080
than the world's side.

380
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,080
Amen?

381
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,080
And notice what the Bible says in Deuteronomy 33.

382
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,080
We'd eventually get here.

383
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,080
In Deuteronomy chapter 33,

384
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,080
notice what God says through Moses

385
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,080
in verses 10 and 11.

386
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,080
Again, this is a passage of Scripture.

387
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,080
I'll read verse 1 and then we'll get down

388
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,080
to verses 10 and 11.

389
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,080
But in Deuteronomy 33 and verse 1,

390
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,080
it says,

391
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,080
And this is the blessing wherewith Moses,

392
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,080
the man of God,

393
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,080
blessed the children of Israel

394
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,080
before his death.

395
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,080
You can go through here

396
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,080
and you can read beginning here

397
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,080
in this text of Scripture

398
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,080
in verse 6 with Reuben,

399
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,080
and you can go right down through

400
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,080
and you can see the tribes that are mentioned,

401
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,080
of course, not Simeon,

402
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,080
but all the other tribes mentioned.

403
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,080
Look down in verse number 10.

404
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,080
Actually, I'm going to back up to verse number 8.

405
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,080
It says,

406
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,080
And of Levi he said,

407
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,080
Let thy Thummim and Urim be with thy Holy One,

408
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,080
whom thou didst prove at Massah,

409
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,080
and with whom thou didst strive

410
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,080
at the waters of Meribah,

411
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,080
who said unto his father and to his mother,

412
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,080
I have not seen him,

413
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,080
neither did he acknowledge his brethren,

414
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,080
nor knew his own children,

415
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,080
for they have observed thy word

416
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,080
and kept thy covenant.

417
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,080
Do you see what it says

418
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,080
at the end of verse number 9?

419
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,080
They did.

420
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,080
They have observed thy word

421
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,080
and kept thy covenant.

422
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,080
Now, verse number 10 and 11,

423
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,080
this outlines for us the duties,

424
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,080
responsibilities, if you will,

425
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,080
for the Levites.

426
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,080
It says,

427
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,080
They shall teach Jacob.

428
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,080
Now, who's Jacob?

429
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,080
It's talking about Israel as a nation, right?

430
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:14,080
It's not talking about just Jacob as an individual.

431
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,080
He is, his name was changed to Israel.

432
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,080
We look at the tribulation,

433
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,080
the day of Jacob's trouble.

434
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,080
We speak of that and we see that.

435
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,080
And we find here,

436
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,080
They shall teach Jacob,

437
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,080
what, thy judgments,

438
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,080
and Israel thy law.

439
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,080
They shall put incense before thee

440
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,080
and hold burnt sacrifice upon thine altar.

441
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,080
Bless, Lord, his substance

442
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,080
and accept the work of his hands.

443
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,080
Smite through the loins of them

444
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,080
that rise against him

445
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,080
and of them that hate him

446
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,080
that they rise not again.

447
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,080
That's a pretty good situation,

448
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,080
is it not?

449
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,080
I mean, the responsibility that they roll,

450
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,080
that they have,

451
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,080
and that they'll play within

452
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,080
the nation of Israel's history.

453
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,080
And of course,

454
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,080
after they are serving

455
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,080
and all that they do,

456
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,080
and what a blessing to think about

457
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:05,080
the truth of how they responded

458
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:08,080
and what God then allows them to do.

459
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,080
So we see Reuben.

460
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,080
We see Simeon and Levi.

461
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,080
Number three, we see Judah.

462
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,080
In verses 8 through 12,

463
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:19,080
we read in Genesis 49 of Judah.

464
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,080
The Bible says in verse number 8,

465
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,080
Judah, thou art he

466
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:26,080
whom thy brethren shall praise.

467
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,080
The word means praise.

468
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,080
Thy hand shall be in the neck

469
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,080
of thine enemies.

470
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,080
Thy father's children

471
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,080
shall bow down before thee.

472
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,080
Judah is a lion's whelp

473
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,080
from the prey.

474
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,080
My son, thou art gone up.

475
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,080
He stooped down.

476
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,080
He couched as a lion

477
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,080
and as an old lion

478
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,080
who shall rouse him up.

479
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:48,080
The scepter shall not depart from Judah

480
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,080
nor a lawgiver from between his feet

481
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,080
until Shiloh come.

482
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,080
And unto him shall the gathering

483
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,080
of the people be,

484
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,080
binding his foal unto the vine

485
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,080
and his ass's colt

486
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,080
unto the choice vine.

487
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,080
He washed his garments in wine

488
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,080
and his clothes in the blood of grapes.

489
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,080
His eyes shall be red with wine

490
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:10,080
and his teeth white with milk.

491
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,080
As we look at these few verses

492
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,080
with regard to Judah,

493
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,080
we find it very interesting

494
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,080
as we look here at this portion of Scripture

495
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,080
and we've noted with Reuben

496
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,080
and with Simeon and Levi

497
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,080
and now we see with those three

498
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:27,080
how that past sin was exposed.

499
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,080
It was brought up.

500
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,080
You know, Judah was guilty

501
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,080
of some wicked behavior as well.

502
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:36,080
You can read in Genesis chapter number 38

503
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,080
in the situation with his marriage

504
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,080
and then with Tamar

505
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,080
and all that takes place

506
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,080
and you can read of that,

507
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,080
but you find here in the text of Scripture

508
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:47,080
it's not recorded.

509
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,080
It's missing.

510
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:52,080
But is it missing because Jacob forgot?

511
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,080
I think not.

512
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,080
In fact, if you were to think about

513
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,080
the events being chronological,

514
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,080
the situation with Simeon and Levi

515
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,080
happened first,

516
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,080
then the situation with Reuben

517
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:06,080
and then the situation with Judah.

518
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,080
And so I do not think it's a matter of

519
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,080
Jacob just forgetting of this situation

520
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:14,080
with Judah and all that took place.

521
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,080
No, rather I believe

522
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,080
that as we think here of Judah

523
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,080
standing before Jacob

524
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:22,080
and this blessing that we read of,

525
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,080
that one reason I believe,

526
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,080
the reason,

527
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,080
that nothing is brought up

528
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,080
with regard to what he had

529
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,080
previously been guilty of

530
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:33,080
is that when we look at the life of Judah

531
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:36,080
and we look at him standing in Egypt

532
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,080
before Joseph,

533
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:40,080
not knowing that it's Joseph,

534
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,080
we read in Genesis 44,

535
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,080
verses 14 through 34,

536
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:48,080
a man who is broken.

537
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,080
A broken man.

538
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,080
Over what?

539
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,080
Over sin.

540
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,080
Just over the sin of

541
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,080
the situation with Joseph?

542
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,080
I don't think so.

543
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,080
Yes.

544
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,080
Indeed, that's referenced there.

545
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,080
But think about what Judah

546
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,080
and even some of the other brothers,

547
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,080
what they had said

548
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,080
during that period of time.

549
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,080
All these things were happening.

550
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,080
Surely God is dealing with us.

551
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,080
Surely God remembers.

552
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,080
And we find that Judah is the one

553
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,080
that stands up before Joseph

554
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:22,080
and Judah is truly broken.

555
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,080
I said this when we preached

556
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,080
through the text of Scripture

557
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,080
in Genesis 44,

558
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,080
that it's a beautiful picture

559
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:30,080
of brokenness and repentance.

560
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,080
And we see, listen,

561
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,080
when we're broken and we're repentant,

562
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,080
guess what we have?

563
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,080
We have forgiveness.

564
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,080
We have forgiveness.

565
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,080
You know, it's interesting

566
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,080
as I say that this is kind of a picture,

567
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,080
if you will,

568
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,080
with regard to the situation

569
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,080
there in Genesis 49.

570
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,080
And we think about the forgiveness that we have.

571
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,080
You know, when God says that He forgives us,

572
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,080
He says He removes it

573
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,080
as far as the east is from the west.

574
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,080
Amen?

575
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,080
I'm thankful for that truth.

576
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:01,080
He that covereth his sins shall not prosper.

577
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:04,080
But whoso confesseth and forsaketh,

578
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:08,080
they shall find have mercy, grace.

579
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,080
What a blessing.

580
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,080
It's interesting.

581
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,080
We won't take time,

582
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,080
but you could read in Genesis 44,

583
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,080
beginning in verse number 14,

584
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,080
how Judah stands up

585
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,080
and all that he rehearses

586
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,080
and all that he says

587
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,080
and how he's completely broken.

588
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:26,080
And it was after that speech,

589
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,080
if you will,

590
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,080
as he pours out his heart

591
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,080
and brokenness before Joseph,

592
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,080
that Joseph in Genesis 45

593
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,080
could no longer refrain himself

594
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:39,080
and he makes known his identity.

595
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,080
Why?

596
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,080
Because Judah was broken.

597
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,080
He was repentant.

598
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:48,080
We find that here in this text of Scripture,

599
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:52,080
Judah in Genesis chapter 49,

600
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,080
back in verses 8,

601
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,080
down through verse number 12,

602
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,080
we begin to read of this blessing

603
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,080
and though there was fault in his life,

604
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,080
there was sin in his life,

605
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,080
it's not mentioned here

606
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,080
and I believe it's because of that brokenness,

607
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,080
but we see the blessing that's given Judah

608
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,080
would be the royal tribe.

609
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,080
He'd be the royal tribe.

610
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,080
Kings.

611
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,080
Not a blessing.

612
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,080
But I think more than just kings

613
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,080
that would rule over Israel,

614
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,080
in our text of Scripture,

615
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,080
there's no doubt that the Holy Spirit of God

616
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,080
has given us this portion of Scripture

617
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:27,080
and in view is the Lord Jesus Christ

618
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:30,080
who remember in Revelation 5

619
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,080
in verse number 5

620
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:37,080
is known as the lion of the tribe of Judah.

621
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:40,080
We know that in Hebrews 7

622
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,080
in verse number 14

623
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,080
when the Bible's speaking about the priesthood,

624
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,080
it says that we know that Jesus,

625
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,080
He didn't come from Levi.

626
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,080
No, He came from Judah,

627
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,080
from the tribe of Judah.

628
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,080
And so we find that here,

629
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,080
no doubt there's a view.

630
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,080
I mentioned already the purpose,

631
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,080
the process and the prophetic view.

632
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,080
There's a view here.

633
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:06,040
here in verses 8-12 that goes all the way through the Millennial Kingdom of Christ.

634
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:10,080
All the way back in Genesis 49.

635
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:14,340
I don't think Jacob fully understood all that he was saying.

636
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:18,920
We understand that here as we have the whole canon of Scripture and we're able to compare

637
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:26,720
Scripture with Scripture and we can see the far-reaching view of these statements made

638
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,600
by Jacob, these blessings if you will.

639
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:33,320
We find that he says in verse number 10, the scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a

640
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,980
lawgiver from between his feet.

641
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:37,920
Notice this, until Shiloh come.

642
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:43,360
It's kind of interesting because here in the text of Scripture in Genesis 49, Shiloh in

643
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:51,640
verse number 11, excuse me, in verse number 10 is not a place, it's a person.

644
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,720
A person.

645
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:57,960
You know Shiloh is very interesting, I mentioned this to Ronnie this afternoon, Shiloh has

646
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:06,440
the same root Hebrew word, the Hebrew root word for Shiloh is the same as shalom or peace.

647
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:12,440
Now Jesus is the Prince of Peace, right?

648
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:19,040
We see that of course in Isaiah 9 and verse number 6 and we find here that indeed the

649
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:27,160
Lord Jesus Christ is in view of being that one that will one day come, he is going to

650
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:30,520
rule and reign for a thousand years, amen?

651
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:34,800
I said this morning, it's worth repeating this evening, God's plan is going to come

652
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,800
to pass.

653
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,040
Thy will be done.

654
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,160
Listen there is going to be a rapture.

655
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:43,240
There is, there will be seven years of tribulation.

656
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:49,600
There will be a millennial reign of Christ and there will be eternity, hallelujah.

657
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,600
I'm thankful for that.

658
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:55,440
We stood and talked to a man yesterday, Tim was with me, I had both Joseph and Tim, we

659
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,400
took turns knocking doors yesterday so that we didn't show up with three of us at one

660
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:03,720
door, we just kind of rotated and we're there and one man says, I don't believe anything,

661
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,000
I don't believe any of that.

662
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,920
You're entitled to believe what you want to believe.

663
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:13,920
Everyone believes something and if you want to be your own authority, that's up to you

664
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:18,920
but one day you're going to find out the truth, amen?

665
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:24,860
And here we have in view, look at the beautiful picture of peace and plenty that is painted

666
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:31,300
for us in verses 11 and 12 which really will not be fully known until the millennial reign

667
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,540
of Christ.

668
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:37,100
In verse number 11 it says, binding is fall unto the vine.

669
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,460
No one does that.

670
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,220
Why?

671
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:47,460
Well because you're going to lose your animal because you're going to eat the vine, right?

672
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:50,780
He says look and his ass is cold under the choice vine.

673
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:55,460
They're going to eat it up and depart but it's going to be so plentiful, it's going

674
00:32:55,460 --> 00:33:02,020
to be so bountiful that one would be able to bind his fall unto the vine and his ass

675
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:04,900
is cold unto the choice vine.

676
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,180
What a beautiful picture.

677
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:11,820
The verbiage that is used in verses 11 and 12 paint for us this beautiful picture of

678
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:18,740
peace and plenty again which will not be fully realized or known until the millennial reign

679
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,500
of Christ.

680
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,960
God tells us much about the millennium.

681
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,820
We find that scattered throughout many of the prophets there are many references with

682
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:31,820
regard to the millennial reign of Christ and we find that here all the way back in Genesis

683
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:39,380
49 he speaks, Jacob does, when he is giving this blessing to Judah looking all the way

684
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:44,380
through human history down to the millennial reign of Christ.

685
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:47,140
That's amazing to me.

686
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:52,540
God was no doubt working and I think about Jacob and it's evident as we consider one

687
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:56,440
person said this, I think he was right on point when he made this statement.

688
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:03,140
He said in his carnal or fleshly person Jacob would like to have given this blessing that

689
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:07,660
he gives to Judah to Joseph.

690
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:15,660
But in his spiritual man the blessing is given to Judah because that was God's plan.

691
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:22,300
By the way, it ties hand in hand with the message from this morning, thy will be done.

692
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:26,540
See Joseph was Jacob's favorite, was he not?

693
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:28,060
He was the favorite son.

694
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,820
He was the one that got the coat of many colors.

695
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:36,060
He was the one that for 17 years, excuse me, for those first 17 years of his life he was

696
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:40,400
the one that was well loved and favored and all the others knew it.

697
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:44,940
And then for over 20 years he's there in Egypt and all that takes place and then for

698
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:51,540
17 years Jacob has an opportunity to see his son and to dwell there in the land.

699
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:58,980
And maybe in the carnal, fleshly mind of the individual he'd want to give such a blessing

700
00:34:58,980 --> 00:34:59,980
to Joseph.

701
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:04,060
But no, God said that blessing is for Judah.

702
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:08,540
We find that from Judah, by the way if you think about the kings, Saul was the first

703
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:12,380
one but that was not from the tribe of Judah, it was from the tribe of Benjamin and that

704
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:16,220
was because the people wanted to have a king.

705
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:20,900
We find that God did through Judah bring the kings and of course the Lord Jesus Christ

706
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,620
who will reign one day.

707
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:28,460
And so we look at these four sons and we find this picture this evening and I just wonder

708
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:32,460
and we'll say this kind of as we go through the next several weeks of messages as well

709
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:37,060
and look at each of these sons and what's mentioned about them and the tribes and what

710
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,060
have you.

711
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:43,100
But I wonder this evening, are we ready to stand in such a manner?

712
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:48,700
I wonder this evening, you know the Bible talks about let a man examine himself, right?

713
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:54,260
We read that often, we observe the Lord's Supper and what appropriate passage that is

714
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,860
in 1 Corinthians 11.

715
00:35:55,860 --> 00:36:00,020
But the reality is that every day of our lives we're going to be examining ourselves, being

716
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:04,980
ready to give an account because one day we will give an account.

717
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:08,900
So we see here in this passage of Scripture, what a scene.

718
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:17,260
We see that as Jacob is dying, he says, gather together and he begins to speak to his sons.

719
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:21,620
We see Reuben, Simeon, Levi and Judah.

720
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:26,340
Next week we'll look at the next however many and then we'll finish up Lord willing in a

721
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,460
couple of weeks after that.

722
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:28,460
Let's pray together.

723
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:30,100
Father we do love you.

724
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:34,020
We thank you for loving us and Lord I pray that as we look at a passage like this and

725
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:40,740
we can dig in and we can see and trace things throughout the history of Israel and notice

726
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:45,820
various things that are mentioned here and some of their fulfillment and some of the

727
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:53,660
prophecy that still lies ahead of us and Lord we can just rejoice in this passage and what

728
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:54,740
you've revealed to us.

729
00:36:54,740 --> 00:37:00,140
But I pray tonight that you'd help us to have a moment of examination Lord and help us to

730
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,380
be ready to give an account.

731
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:08,100
Lord we know that we are responsible, that Lord you've given us a responsibility.

732
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:13,180
You've blessed us with so many opportunities and I wonder this evening even as we have

733
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:19,020
this message right after we sing the song, I wonder have I done my best for Jesus?

734
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:22,300
And Lord I pray that you'd have your will and way in our hearts and lives in these next

735
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,300
few moments.

736
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,620
We'll thank you for it in Christ's name we pray.

737
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:26,620
Would you stand with me?

738
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:27,620
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

739
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,660
She's going to play quietly on the piano.

740
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:31,180
As she does the altar is open.
