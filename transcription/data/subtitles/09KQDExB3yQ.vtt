00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.700
verses this evening from Genesis chapter 49.

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.380
And I had mentioned to someone this afternoon,

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:07.820
I said it this morning as well,

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:09.020
that I had planned to go through

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:10.739
the whole chapter this evening.

00:00:10.739 --> 00:00:12.819
And then I got into studying it and said,

00:00:12.819 --> 00:00:15.060
there's no way we're getting through the whole chapter.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.739
And we're just getting near the end of our study

00:00:17.739 --> 00:00:19.139
through the book of Genesis.

00:00:19.139 --> 00:00:22.139
In fact, this is message number 98.

00:00:22.139 --> 00:00:24.500
And so if you've been with me through the whole process

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.680
of studying through the book of Genesis,

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.139
we are near the end and we're not quite there yet,

00:00:30.139 --> 00:00:31.819
but we are getting close.

00:00:31.819 --> 00:00:33.659
I wanna read just a few verses to you,

00:00:33.659 --> 00:00:35.540
verses one and two and then verse number 28

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.740
before we dig into the text this evening.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.139
The Bible says in Genesis 49 and verse number one,

00:00:40.139 --> 00:00:43.740
and Jacob called unto his sons and said,

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.220
gather yourselves together that I may tell you

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.740
that which shall befall you, notice, in the last days.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.299
Gather yourselves together and hear,

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:59.840
ye sons of Jacob and hearken unto Israel, your father.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.720
Skip down if you will and look at verse 28.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.199
The Bible says this, all these are the 12 tribes of Israel.

00:01:06.199 --> 00:01:09.599
And this is it that their father spake unto them

00:01:09.599 --> 00:01:11.599
and blessed them.

00:01:11.599 --> 00:01:16.239
Everyone according to his blessing, he blessed them.

00:01:16.239 --> 00:01:18.080
As we look at this portion of scripture,

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.519
we are mindful of the fact that Jacob's life

00:01:20.519 --> 00:01:22.480
is coming to an end.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.680
In fact, it's at the end of this chapter

00:01:25.019 --> 00:01:28.419
that God records for us the death of Jacob.

00:01:28.419 --> 00:01:31.580
By the way, as we consider that truth this evening,

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.059
that day is going to come for each and every one of us,

00:01:35.059 --> 00:01:37.019
the day of our death, right?

00:01:37.019 --> 00:01:40.459
That's going to happen and we understand that.

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:43.220
And so we find that prior to the death,

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.220
Jacob, of course, we looked the last time in chapter 48

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.139
as he spoke with Joseph and had Ephraim and Manasseh

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:52.300
before him and all that he said there.

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:54.839
But we come to the 49th chapter and we find that

00:01:54.839 --> 00:01:57.760
Jacob calls for his sons to gather themselves

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.680
in his presence throughout the chapter this evening

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.879
and over the next several Sunday evenings

00:02:03.879 --> 00:02:05.919
as we study through Genesis 49,

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:07.580
we will note several things.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.520
Number one, we will note the purpose of this gathering.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.119
And as we consider the purpose and recall

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:19.880
what is taking place as God has recorded it for us,

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.740
we will see clearly the purpose of the gathering.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.139
We find not only the purpose,

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:27.520
but we find that there's a process that is followed.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.740
And as we look at the purpose and the process,

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.740
we also see the prophetic view that is given to us.

00:02:35.919 --> 00:02:38.100
You notice I mentioned at the end of verse number one

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.100
that it says, that which shall befall you in the last days.

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:46.300
There were some things that would be soon fulfilled,

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.100
but there's many things within Genesis 49

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:52.440
that look even still today to the future.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.320
And we'll note that as we study

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.119
through the portion of scripture.

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:57.759
What a scene this is.

00:02:58.839 --> 00:03:00.380
I want you to think about the scene.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.720
As we kind of enter into the room with Jacob,

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.600
he's dying, he knows that he's on his deathbed

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.279
and he calls for his sons to gather themselves together

00:03:09.279 --> 00:03:11.000
to enter into his presence.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.720
We find that each son will stand before their father.

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:18.699
We find that the father Jacob here

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:19.940
in this portion of scripture,

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.539
he has his 12 boys and one by one,

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:24.179
they will stand before him and he'll begin

00:03:24.179 --> 00:03:25.820
to say certain things,

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.199
some that are more lengthy than others

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:32.500
and some that are more of a blessing than others.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.520
And we find that in this text of scripture,

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.300
we will consider a few things.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.899
Again, over the next several weeks,

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:40.940
we'll consider some with regard to the principle

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.279
of sowing and reaping.

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:44.820
Sowing and reaping.

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.059
Not only that, but we'll see how some receive a reward

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:51.500
while others suffer loss.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.119
I want you to think about that phraseology.

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:56.500
I chose it on purpose because there's coming a day,

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.259
not that we'll stand before our earthly father,

00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:01.899
but we'll stand before our heavenly judge,

00:04:01.899 --> 00:04:03.259
the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:05.899
and we'll stand before him at the judgment seat of Christ.

00:04:05.899 --> 00:04:08.899
And this is not the same as the judgment seat of Christ,

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:11.440
but certainly gives us that image,

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.320
that idea of what's happening.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.200
And we find that as we look at this portion of scripture,

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.640
again, there's a clear purpose.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.040
We find that there's a process that is followed

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.179
and there's definitely a view of prophetic statement

00:04:27.179 --> 00:04:29.160
that is given throughout the text.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.559
Tonight, Lord willing, we'll look at Reuben,

00:04:31.559 --> 00:04:34.079
Simeon, Levi, and Judah.

00:04:34.079 --> 00:04:36.679
We'll look at four of the sons that are mentioned

00:04:36.679 --> 00:04:38.260
beginning in verse number three.

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:40.239
I've titled the message, you see it there on the bulletin,

00:04:40.239 --> 00:04:42.320
Jacob blesses his sons, part one.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.000
And the points are really just the names of the sons.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.160
All right, so number one, Reuben.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.519
In verses three and four,

00:04:48.519 --> 00:04:52.859
we read where Reuben stands before Jacob.

00:04:52.859 --> 00:04:54.640
Notice the Bible says in verse number three,

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.299
Reuben, thou art my firstborn,

00:04:58.299 --> 00:05:01.700
my might, the beginning of my strength,

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.480
the excellency of dignity,

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.700
and the excellency of power,

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.079
colon.

00:05:09.079 --> 00:05:11.040
I think he wishes there was a period.

00:05:12.799 --> 00:05:15.200
Do you understand what I mean?

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.559
Because up to this point, it sounds pretty good.

00:05:17.559 --> 00:05:19.519
This is going in a good direction.

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:21.100
You're my firstborn.

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.720
You are the beginning of my strength,

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.880
the excellency of dignity, the excellency of power,

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.559
unstable as water.

00:05:32.239 --> 00:05:36.480
Thou shall not excel.

00:05:37.459 --> 00:05:42.459
Wow, how quickly the mood must change in the room.

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:46.820
Notice because, because why?

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:48.959
Well, remember I said we would look

00:05:48.959 --> 00:05:50.420
and you would see some principles

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.100
with regard to sowing and reaping.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:56.579
Because thou wentest up to thy father's bed,

00:05:56.579 --> 00:06:01.579
then defilest thou it, he went up to my couch.

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:06.299
And so as we look at this firstborn son,

00:06:07.119 --> 00:06:10.160
Reuben, standing before his father, Jacob,

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.519
we find that he mentions about his place

00:06:13.519 --> 00:06:15.880
in the birth order, that he's his firstborn.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.679
We notice and we could look in 1 Corinthians 5,

00:06:18.679 --> 00:06:20.799
you might wanna reference it, verses one and two,

00:06:20.799 --> 00:06:23.839
how that his birthright was forfeited

00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:26.640
and therefore the genealogy is not to be followed

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:29.239
after the Reuben being the firstborn.

00:06:29.239 --> 00:06:31.160
And we can read of that in 1 Chronicles 5

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.799
as the genealogy is given.

00:06:32.799 --> 00:06:34.519
But we notice in verse number four

00:06:34.519 --> 00:06:39.519
that Jacob says unstable as water, thou shalt not excel.

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.980
Those are not words that you wanna hear.

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:46.179
Would you agree?

00:06:46.179 --> 00:06:48.059
I mean, these are not pleasant words.

00:06:48.059 --> 00:06:51.179
These are not words that one would be desiring to hear.

00:06:51.179 --> 00:06:54.239
But we find that as you continue to read in verse number four

00:06:54.239 --> 00:06:58.799
that what happens is there is sin exposed.

00:06:58.799 --> 00:07:00.880
We find that here in the text of Scripture,

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.899
something that had happened many years prior,

00:07:03.899 --> 00:07:06.899
but evidently had never been dealt with

00:07:06.899 --> 00:07:09.880
is now being exposed.

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:12.820
I would say that it seems as you read the Scriptures

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:16.700
that there's never a time in recorded Scripture

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:20.820
where Reuben has any level of brokenness or repentance.

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:24.540
And we find that this sin that had happened many years ago

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:28.299
is now being referenced and discussed

00:07:28.299 --> 00:07:30.779
at this last meeting with his father.

00:07:30.779 --> 00:07:32.700
The sin that is being spoken of

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:36.660
is the sin that's recorded in Genesis 35 and verse number 22.

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:40.100
It says that because thou wentest up to thy father's bed.

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:43.019
And we read in Genesis 35 and verse 22

00:07:43.019 --> 00:07:44.420
where the Bible says this,

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:47.019
and it came to pass when Israel dwelt in the land

00:07:47.019 --> 00:07:50.220
that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah,

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:53.760
his father's concubine, and Israel heard it.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.540
Now the sons of Jacob were 12.

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:58.640
And so Israel heard, he knew about it,

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:01.820
but there's no record that anything was ever done.

00:08:01.859 --> 00:08:03.579
So we find now as Reuben,

00:08:03.579 --> 00:08:05.019
maybe something that he thought,

00:08:05.019 --> 00:08:07.619
man, I didn't really have any consequences.

00:08:07.619 --> 00:08:10.700
You know, sometimes sin has an immediate consequence

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:12.380
in your life.

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:15.179
Sometimes, however, you know, sowing and reaping,

00:08:15.179 --> 00:08:17.380
you don't always reap the day after you sow.

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:22.059
Many times, in fact, there's a long period of time.

00:08:22.059 --> 00:08:25.100
And we find that now as he's standing there

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:26.640
in the presence of his father,

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:30.260
that this act that had taken place many years prior

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:31.859
is brought up.

00:08:31.859 --> 00:08:35.479
But I want you to consider the way in which Jacob says

00:08:35.479 --> 00:08:40.479
to Reuben, unstable as water, thou shalt not excel.

00:08:41.979 --> 00:08:43.559
And when we consider that statement,

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:45.979
I want you to think about the Reubenites, if you will,

00:08:45.979 --> 00:08:47.940
as a tribe just for a moment.

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:51.380
And I'm gonna reference some passages of Scripture,

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:52.580
some verses of Scripture.

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:55.039
We're not necessarily gonna turn to all of them

00:08:55.039 --> 00:08:56.419
for sake of time.

00:08:56.419 --> 00:08:58.859
But I want you to understand that in number 16

00:08:58.859 --> 00:09:02.859
in verse number one, and we will turn and read that.

00:09:02.859 --> 00:09:05.099
In number 16 in verse number one,

00:09:05.099 --> 00:09:09.260
God tells us about a rebellion that takes place.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.799
And we find that the Bible tells us

00:09:11.799 --> 00:09:14.280
of this rebellion of Korah.

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:17.179
Now notice in number 16 in verse number one,

00:09:17.179 --> 00:09:20.900
again, Jacob says to Reuben, unstable as water,

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:22.739
thou shalt not excel.

00:09:22.739 --> 00:09:26.200
It seems as if the only time there's any reference

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:30.000
in Scripture where any of the Reubenites rose up

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.520
to lead in any capacity would be this,

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:34.039
and it's a bad account.

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:36.679
The Bible says in verse number one,

00:09:36.679 --> 00:09:39.239
now Korah, the son of Ishar, the son of Kohath,

00:09:39.239 --> 00:09:41.760
the son of Levi, and Daphan, and Abiram,

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.239
the sons of Eliab, and on the son of Peleth,

00:09:44.239 --> 00:09:47.280
sons of Reuben, took men.

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:49.000
And they rose up before Moses

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.479
with certain of the children of Israel,

00:09:50.479 --> 00:09:52.479
250 princes of the assembly,

00:09:52.479 --> 00:09:55.460
famous in the congregation, men of renown.

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:59.340
So these sons of Reuben, we find that are mentioned here

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:00.179
in verse number.

00:10:00.179 --> 00:10:07.819
chapter 16, there's some level of leading with regard to this rebellion that is recorded

00:10:07.819 --> 00:10:08.979
in number 16.

00:10:08.979 --> 00:10:15.459
By the way, this rebellion resulted in the lives of many thousands of people destroyed.

00:10:15.459 --> 00:10:20.459
Rebellion against God's man, Moses, and God's plan.

00:10:20.459 --> 00:10:23.699
By the way, I said it this morning, God chose David.

00:10:23.699 --> 00:10:29.499
David didn't desire, he didn't say, I'm volunteering, I submitted my application for the job.

00:10:29.499 --> 00:10:32.699
And God chose Moses, amen?

00:10:32.699 --> 00:10:36.699
And here there's rebellion that creeps in and we find that.

00:10:36.699 --> 00:10:41.339
I want you to also consider when you think about the tribe of Reuben, Reuben was the

00:10:41.339 --> 00:10:48.499
first tribe to make the request to Moses to settle on the east side of the Jordan.

00:10:48.499 --> 00:10:52.299
They were the ones that they saw the land and said, hey, this is good for us.

00:10:52.299 --> 00:10:58.339
They settled not for what God had intended for them to have, but they settled for what

00:10:58.339 --> 00:10:59.619
was convenient.

00:10:59.619 --> 00:11:04.139
They asked, you could turn over to Numbers 32 and you could see how they settled on

00:11:04.139 --> 00:11:05.899
the east side of Jordan.

00:11:05.899 --> 00:11:09.619
Reuben, Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh.

00:11:09.619 --> 00:11:12.339
So Reuben is the one that first makes that request.

00:11:12.339 --> 00:11:17.579
Reuben is the tribe that is first taken into Assyrian captivity.

00:11:17.579 --> 00:11:22.699
In 1 Chronicles 5 and verse 26, we'll note that passage of scripture in 1 Chronicles

00:11:22.699 --> 00:11:30.819
5, and it's sad because we can read with regard to the, of course, the nation of Israel

00:11:30.819 --> 00:11:34.219
going into captivity and the nation of Judah going into captivity.

00:11:34.219 --> 00:11:39.979
But here in 1 Chronicles 5 and verse 26, it begins to record for us the captivity of the

00:11:39.979 --> 00:11:44.739
two and a half tribes that are on the east side of the Jordan.

00:11:44.739 --> 00:11:49.939
It's really recorded in verses 23 through 26, and in verse number 26 it says, or verse

00:11:49.939 --> 00:11:54.979
25, it says, they transgressed against the God of their fathers and went a whoring after

00:11:54.979 --> 00:11:59.419
the gods of the people of the land whom God destroyed before them.

00:11:59.419 --> 00:12:03.539
The God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Paul, king of Assyria, and the spirit of Tilgath

00:12:03.539 --> 00:12:09.139
Pilneser, king of Assyria, and he carried them away, even, notice the Reubenites, the

00:12:09.139 --> 00:12:14.779
Gadites, the half tribe of Manasseh, and brought them unto Hala and Habor and Hara and to the

00:12:14.779 --> 00:12:18.419
river Gozan unto this day.

00:12:18.419 --> 00:12:25.739
And so we read here of this tribe, the tribe of Reuben, that stands first before Jacob

00:12:25.739 --> 00:12:32.539
and Jacob says, Reuben, unstable as water, thou shalt not excel.

00:12:32.539 --> 00:12:39.579
As you study the history of Israel, you really see the prophetic statement come to pass.

00:12:39.579 --> 00:12:42.299
There's no excelling within the tribe of Reuben.

00:12:42.299 --> 00:12:44.259
And we see that they're taken into captivity.

00:12:44.259 --> 00:12:46.139
They had requested that land.

00:12:46.139 --> 00:12:51.019
We find that the scene quickly passes and now Reuben is no longer standing before his

00:12:51.019 --> 00:12:56.099
father and now in verses 5 through 7 we read of Simeon and Levi.

00:12:56.099 --> 00:13:00.659
Simeon and Levi, it seems as if they stand before their father together as we find in

00:13:00.659 --> 00:13:01.659
verse number 5.

00:13:01.659 --> 00:13:05.619
It says, Simeon and Levi are brethren.

00:13:05.619 --> 00:13:08.419
Instruments of cruelty are in their habitations.

00:13:08.419 --> 00:13:15.939
O my soul, come not thou into their secret, unto their assembly, my honor, be not thou

00:13:15.939 --> 00:13:17.099
united.

00:13:17.099 --> 00:13:23.899
For in their anger they slew a man and in their self-will they dig down a wall.

00:13:23.899 --> 00:13:28.899
Just as the case was with Reuben where sin was exposed in verse number 4, we find that

00:13:28.899 --> 00:13:33.019
as Simeon and Levi stand before Jacob and we'll get to verse 7 in just a moment, we

00:13:33.019 --> 00:13:39.259
find that Jacob rehearses something again that had happened many years before.

00:13:39.259 --> 00:13:45.059
Here for these two tribes, for these two sons that represent the tribes of Simeon and Levi,

00:13:45.059 --> 00:13:51.500
we find that judgment is here noted due to their vicious anger in destroying the men

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:53.599
of Shechem.

00:13:53.599 --> 00:13:59.699
We can read, we won't take the time to do so, but in Genesis chapter 34, verses 25 through

00:13:59.699 --> 00:14:05.259
21, you can read of that account and you can read of their anger and notice in verse

00:14:05.259 --> 00:14:13.259
number 7, the Bible says, cursed be their anger for it was fierce and their wrath for

00:14:13.259 --> 00:14:14.839
it was cruel.

00:14:14.839 --> 00:14:20.539
Now notice what Jacob says and this is that prophetic view, if you will.

00:14:20.539 --> 00:14:28.579
It says this, I will divide them in Jacob and scatter them in Israel.

00:14:28.619 --> 00:14:34.100
So Simeon and Levi, they work together, if you will, in this situation with Shechem that's

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:41.940
recorded in Genesis 34 and it's exposed here in this text of Scripture and Jacob says that

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:47.179
they're going to be divided in Jacob and scattered in Israel.

00:14:47.179 --> 00:14:51.059
And so we find that as we were to look at the inhabiting of the land, if you think about

00:14:51.059 --> 00:14:56.899
this time in Israel's history, just as early on as a nation, they just have gotten to Egypt,

00:14:56.899 --> 00:15:01.220
they're there for 17 years, they would be in Egyptian bondage, they'd have of course

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:05.739
the Exodus and eventually after 40 years of the wandering in the wilderness, they would

00:15:05.739 --> 00:15:08.259
enter into the land of promise.

00:15:08.259 --> 00:15:12.820
The land that God promised Abraham and we find that they would enter into that land,

00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:18.119
they would conquer the land, they would divide the land, they would inhabit the land.

00:15:18.119 --> 00:15:26.339
But Simeon, their inheritance is within the boundaries of Judah.

00:15:26.339 --> 00:15:31.220
So if you were to look at a map of the inheritance of the nation of Israel when they entered

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:37.919
the land, the southern part of Israel is where Judah is and within Judah, it's almost like

00:15:37.919 --> 00:15:40.779
a perfect circle, is Simeon.

00:15:40.779 --> 00:15:45.639
So they have a land that is within the land, if you will, of Judah, within the inheritance

00:15:45.639 --> 00:15:46.639
of Judah.

00:15:46.639 --> 00:15:50.279
We read of that in Joshua 19 and verse number 9.

00:15:50.279 --> 00:15:55.299
If you have Bible maps in your Bible and you look at some that are dated with regard to

00:15:55.299 --> 00:16:00.299
the inhabiting and the dividing of the land, you'll notice how that they are within that

00:16:00.299 --> 00:16:02.619
inheritance that was given to Judah.

00:16:02.619 --> 00:16:06.940
It's interesting when you consider Simeon, and we'll look at both of these individually

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:13.059
though it seems as if they stand before Jacob together, by the time in the book of Numbers

00:16:13.059 --> 00:16:19.779
the second census is given, which is recorded for us in Numbers 26, verse number 14 with

00:16:19.779 --> 00:16:26.220
regard to the Simeonites specifically, you will know that by that time the size of the

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:31.660
tribe of Simeon decreased by over 37,000 people.

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:33.579
That's a lot of people.

00:16:33.579 --> 00:16:41.100
The tribe during the first census, they were counted at 59,300 and by the time of the second

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:45.059
census they were down to 22,200.

00:16:45.059 --> 00:16:47.459
Wow.

00:16:47.459 --> 00:16:50.179
We see the decrease in Simeon.

00:16:50.179 --> 00:16:55.299
We see, and we'll note it in just a moment in Deuteronomy chapter 33, but it's interesting

00:16:55.299 --> 00:17:00.339
because in Deuteronomy chapter 33, Moses is preparing to die.

00:17:00.339 --> 00:17:05.059
Here in Genesis 49, Jacob is going to die and he brings all of his sons before him and

00:17:05.059 --> 00:17:10.500
we find that in Deuteronomy chapter 33, Moses is not going to be permitted to enter into

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:15.500
the land and we find that prior to his death, Moses does something interesting.

00:17:15.539 --> 00:17:19.779
He begins to talk about all the tribes and, you know, if you were to study Deuteronomy

00:17:19.779 --> 00:17:26.459
chapter 33, you'll find that there's one tribe missing from all the tribes that are mentioned

00:17:26.459 --> 00:17:27.539
by Moses.

00:17:27.539 --> 00:17:30.779
That one tribe, Simeon, Simeon.

00:17:30.779 --> 00:17:35.100
It's not there and you study that and you begin to see and you look here how it talks

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:37.699
about being scattered.

00:17:37.699 --> 00:17:42.299
He says, I will divide them in Jacob and scatter them in Israel and you think about how the

00:17:42.619 --> 00:17:46.940
Simeonites, they really did not have that identity, if you will, of their own little

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:52.619
tribe and to see the decrease in their census of their population to understand that they're

00:17:52.619 --> 00:17:57.820
not even mentioned there by Moses in Deuteronomy 33.

00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:04.259
Levi, we see that they're both there and again, Levi is just as guilty as Simeon with regard

00:18:04.259 --> 00:18:09.259
to the situation with the sons of Shechem and we read of that and understand and he

00:18:09.259 --> 00:18:13.539
says that they shall, I will divide them in Jacob and scatter them in Israel.

00:18:13.539 --> 00:18:19.019
It's interesting when you think about Levi, there's no specific inheritance for Levi.

00:18:19.019 --> 00:18:24.100
God is their inheritance, rather we find with regard to having a particular spot, they have

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:27.899
48 cities that are scattered throughout the land.

00:18:27.899 --> 00:18:32.260
Now it's very interesting when you begin to think about and understand the history of

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:38.219
Israel and looking at the Old Testament, you begin to see what is said here in Genesis

00:18:38.219 --> 00:18:43.260
chapter 49 with regard to Simeon and Levi, but then all of a sudden when you look in

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:53.299
Deuteronomy chapter 33, Simeon is missing, but Levi, well Moses has some very interesting

00:18:53.299 --> 00:18:55.179
things to say about Levi.

00:18:55.179 --> 00:19:01.820
It's really almost as if the scattering of Levi, the tribe of the Levites really turned

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:03.880
into a blessing.

00:19:03.919 --> 00:19:08.200
We find that the scattering of Levi, the way in which they would be found throughout the

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:12.799
land and we'll read in just a moment there in Deuteronomy 33 and verses 10 and 11 and

00:19:12.799 --> 00:19:17.119
to see what their duties and responsibilities were, but I'd ask this question before we

00:19:17.119 --> 00:19:21.839
get to that point in history for the nation of Israel is what changed?

00:19:21.839 --> 00:19:27.760
Why is it that the Simeonites that are mentioned here by Jacob, Simeon and Levi together and

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:33.279
the anger and cursed be their anger and I will divide them in Jacob and scatter them

00:19:33.279 --> 00:19:37.960
in Israel and we see Simeon with this decline and really no great references whatsoever,

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:45.000
but then you see Levi scattered 48 cities and you find that they have really a place

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.559
of prominence within Israel's history.

00:19:48.559 --> 00:19:49.559
What changed?

00:19:49.559 --> 00:19:55.200
Well I think, I'm not certain because God doesn't say this is what changed, but turn

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:58.599
over to the book of Exodus if you will in the 32nd chapter.

00:19:58.599 --> 00:20:00.080
In Exodus chapter 32.

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:04.080
We find that the people are guilty.

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:09.080
Moses is up on the mount and the people are there

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:12.080
and they say to Aaron,

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:15.080
and up make us gods which shall go before us.

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:17.080
You can read that in verse number one.

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:21.080
And he tells them what to do and he fashions this molten calf.

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:24.080
And it's a wicked scene in Exodus chapter 32.

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:27.080
I mean, it's a bad situation.

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:29.080
And we find that Moses, you remember singing the song,

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:31.080
Who is on the Lord's side?

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:33.080
Amen, it's a good song, right?

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:35.080
And we are on the Lord's side, amen?

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:37.080
And it's a great song and we sing it.

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:40.080
It comes from this passage of scripture.

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:42.080
Notice what Moses says in verse number 26.

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:44.080
Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp and said,

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:48.080
Who is on the Lord's side?

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:50.080
Let him come unto me.

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:52.080
And what does it say?

00:20:52.080 --> 00:21:01.080
All the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him.

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:04.080
That's a good decision by the people of Levi,

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:06.080
the tribe of Levi.

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:09.080
And it says in Exodus 32 and verse 26

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:15.080
that all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him.

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:19.080
Perhaps this gives us a little insight

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:22.080
as to why in Deuteronomy chapter 33,

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:26.080
what we could look at in Genesis 49

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:30.080
as being this scattering, this judgment, if you will,

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:33.080
is really turned into a blessing

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:35.080
because of what they did.

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:36.080
They stood for right.

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:38.080
By the way, it's always right to stand for right.

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:39.080
Amen?

00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:41.080
Who is on the Lord's side?

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:43.080
Listen, I'd rather be on the Lord's side

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:45.080
than the world's side.

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:46.080
Amen?

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:48.080
And notice what the Bible says in Deuteronomy 33.

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:49.080
We'd eventually get here.

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:51.080
In Deuteronomy chapter 33,

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:53.080
notice what God says through Moses

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:55.080
in verses 10 and 11.

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:58.080
Again, this is a passage of Scripture.

00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:00.080
I'll read verse 1 and then we'll get down

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:01.080
to verses 10 and 11.

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:03.080
But in Deuteronomy 33 and verse 1,

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:04.080
it says,

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:07.080
And this is the blessing wherewith Moses,

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:08.080
the man of God,

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:10.080
blessed the children of Israel

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:13.080
before his death.

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:14.080
You can go through here

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:17.080
and you can read beginning here

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:19.080
in this text of Scripture

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:20.080
in verse 6 with Reuben,

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:22.080
and you can go right down through

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:24.080
and you can see the tribes that are mentioned,

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:26.080
of course, not Simeon,

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:28.080
but all the other tribes mentioned.

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:30.080
Look down in verse number 10.

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:32.080
Actually, I'm going to back up to verse number 8.

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:33.080
It says,

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:34.080
And of Levi he said,

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:37.080
Let thy Thummim and Urim be with thy Holy One,

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:39.080
whom thou didst prove at Massah,

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:41.080
and with whom thou didst strive

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:42.080
at the waters of Meribah,

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:44.080
who said unto his father and to his mother,

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:45.080
I have not seen him,

00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:47.080
neither did he acknowledge his brethren,

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.080
nor knew his own children,

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:51.080
for they have observed thy word

00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:52.080
and kept thy covenant.

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:53.080
Do you see what it says

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:54.080
at the end of verse number 9?

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:55.080
They did.

00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:56.080
They have observed thy word

00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:57.080
and kept thy covenant.

00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:59.080
Now, verse number 10 and 11,

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:01.080
this outlines for us the duties,

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:03.080
responsibilities, if you will,

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:04.080
for the Levites.

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:05.080
It says,

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:07.080
They shall teach Jacob.

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:08.080
Now, who's Jacob?

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:11.080
It's talking about Israel as a nation, right?

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:14.080
It's not talking about just Jacob as an individual.

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:16.080
He is, his name was changed to Israel.

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:18.080
We look at the tribulation,

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:20.080
the day of Jacob's trouble.

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:22.080
We speak of that and we see that.

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:23.080
And we find here,

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:24.080
They shall teach Jacob,

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:25.080
what, thy judgments,

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:26.080
and Israel thy law.

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:28.080
They shall put incense before thee

00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:31.080
and hold burnt sacrifice upon thine altar.

00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:33.080
Bless, Lord, his substance

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:35.080
and accept the work of his hands.

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:37.080
Smite through the loins of them

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:38.080
that rise against him

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:40.080
and of them that hate him

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:42.080
that they rise not again.

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:44.080
That's a pretty good situation,

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:45.080
is it not?

00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:47.080
I mean, the responsibility that they roll,

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:48.080
that they have,

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:50.080
and that they'll play within

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:53.080
the nation of Israel's history.

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:54.080
And of course,

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:57.080
after they are serving

00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:59.080
and all that they do,

00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:01.080
and what a blessing to think about

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:05.080
the truth of how they responded

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:08.080
and what God then allows them to do.

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:10.080
So we see Reuben.

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:12.080
We see Simeon and Levi.

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:14.080
Number three, we see Judah.

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:15.080
In verses 8 through 12,

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:19.080
we read in Genesis 49 of Judah.

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:21.080
The Bible says in verse number 8,

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:23.080
Judah, thou art he

00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:26.080
whom thy brethren shall praise.

00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:28.080
The word means praise.

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:30.080
Thy hand shall be in the neck

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:31.080
of thine enemies.

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:32.080
Thy father's children

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:35.080
shall bow down before thee.

00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:37.080
Judah is a lion's whelp

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:38.080
from the prey.

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:40.080
My son, thou art gone up.

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:41.080
He stooped down.

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:42.080
He couched as a lion

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:43.080
and as an old lion

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:45.080
who shall rouse him up.

00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:48.080
The scepter shall not depart from Judah

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:50.080
nor a lawgiver from between his feet

00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:53.080
until Shiloh come.

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:55.080
And unto him shall the gathering

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:56.080
of the people be,

00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:59.080
binding his foal unto the vine

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:00.080
and his ass's colt

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:01.080
unto the choice vine.

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:03.080
He washed his garments in wine

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:05.080
and his clothes in the blood of grapes.

00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:07.080
His eyes shall be red with wine

00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:10.080
and his teeth white with milk.

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:12.080
As we look at these few verses

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:14.080
with regard to Judah,

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:16.080
we find it very interesting

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:18.080
as we look here at this portion of Scripture

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:19.080
and we've noted with Reuben

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:21.080
and with Simeon and Levi

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:23.080
and now we see with those three

00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:27.080
how that past sin was exposed.

00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:29.080
It was brought up.

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:30.080
You know, Judah was guilty

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:33.080
of some wicked behavior as well.

00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:36.080
You can read in Genesis chapter number 38

00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:38.080
in the situation with his marriage

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:39.080
and then with Tamar

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:40.080
and all that takes place

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:41.080
and you can read of that,

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:43.080
but you find here in the text of Scripture

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:47.080
it's not recorded.

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:49.080
It's missing.

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:52.080
But is it missing because Jacob forgot?

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:54.080
I think not.

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:56.080
In fact, if you were to think about

00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:58.080
the events being chronological,

00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:00.080
the situation with Simeon and Levi

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:01.080
happened first,

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:03.080
then the situation with Reuben

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:06.080
and then the situation with Judah.

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:08.080
And so I do not think it's a matter of

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:11.080
Jacob just forgetting of this situation

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:14.080
with Judah and all that took place.

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:16.080
No, rather I believe

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:18.080
that as we think here of Judah

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:19.080
standing before Jacob

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:22.080
and this blessing that we read of,

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.080
that one reason I believe,

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:25.080
the reason,

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:26.080
that nothing is brought up

00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:28.080
with regard to what he had

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:29.080
previously been guilty of

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:33.080
is that when we look at the life of Judah

00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:36.080
and we look at him standing in Egypt

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:37.080
before Joseph,

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:40.080
not knowing that it's Joseph,

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:42.080
we read in Genesis 44,

00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:44.080
verses 14 through 34,

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:48.080
a man who is broken.

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:49.080
A broken man.

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:50.080
Over what?

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:52.080
Over sin.

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:54.080
Just over the sin of

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:57.080
the situation with Joseph?

00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:58.080
I don't think so.

00:26:58.080 --> 00:26:59.080
Yes.

00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:01.080
Indeed, that's referenced there.

00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:03.080
But think about what Judah

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:05.080
and even some of the other brothers,

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:06.080
what they had said

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:08.080
during that period of time.

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:10.080
All these things were happening.

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:12.080
Surely God is dealing with us.

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:13.080
Surely God remembers.

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:16.080
And we find that Judah is the one

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:18.080
that stands up before Joseph

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:22.080
and Judah is truly broken.

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:23.080
I said this when we preached

00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:24.080
through the text of Scripture

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:25.080
in Genesis 44,

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:27.080
that it's a beautiful picture

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:30.080
of brokenness and repentance.

00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:31.080
And we see, listen,

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:33.080
when we're broken and we're repentant,

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:34.080
guess what we have?

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:37.080
We have forgiveness.

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:38.080
We have forgiveness.

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:39.080
You know, it's interesting

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:41.080
as I say that this is kind of a picture,

00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:42.080
if you will,

00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:45.080
with regard to the situation

00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:47.080
there in Genesis 49.

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:49.080
And we think about the forgiveness that we have.

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:51.080
You know, when God says that He forgives us,

00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:52.080
He says He removes it

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:54.080
as far as the east is from the west.

00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:55.080
Amen?

00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:57.080
I'm thankful for that truth.

00:27:57.080 --> 00:28:01.080
He that covereth his sins shall not prosper.

00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:04.080
But whoso confesseth and forsaketh,

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:08.080
they shall find have mercy, grace.

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:09.080
What a blessing.

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:10.080
It's interesting.

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:11.080
We won't take time,

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:13.080
but you could read in Genesis 44,

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:14.080
beginning in verse number 14,

00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:17.080
how Judah stands up

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:19.080
and all that he rehearses

00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:20.080
and all that he says

00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:23.080
and how he's completely broken.

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:26.080
And it was after that speech,

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:27.080
if you will,

00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:28.080
as he pours out his heart

00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:30.080
and brokenness before Joseph,

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:32.080
that Joseph in Genesis 45

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:35.080
could no longer refrain himself

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:39.080
and he makes known his identity.

00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:40.080
Why?

00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:42.080
Because Judah was broken.

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:44.080
He was repentant.

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:48.080
We find that here in this text of Scripture,

00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:52.080
Judah in Genesis chapter 49,

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:54.080
back in verses 8,

00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:55.080
down through verse number 12,

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:57.080
we begin to read of this blessing

00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:59.080
and though there was fault in his life,

00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:01.080
there was sin in his life,

00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:03.080
it's not mentioned here

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:05.080
and I believe it's because of that brokenness,

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:07.080
but we see the blessing that's given Judah

00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:09.080
would be the royal tribe.

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:10.080
He'd be the royal tribe.

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:11.080
Kings.

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:13.080
Not a blessing.

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:15.080
But I think more than just kings

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:16.080
that would rule over Israel,

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:17.080
in our text of Scripture,

00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:19.080
there's no doubt that the Holy Spirit of God

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:23.080
has given us this portion of Scripture

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:27.080
and in view is the Lord Jesus Christ

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:30.080
who remember in Revelation 5

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:31.080
in verse number 5

00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:37.080
is known as the lion of the tribe of Judah.

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:40.080
We know that in Hebrews 7

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:41.080
in verse number 14

00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:43.080
when the Bible's speaking about the priesthood,

00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:45.080
it says that we know that Jesus,

00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:47.080
He didn't come from Levi.

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:49.080
No, He came from Judah,

00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:51.080
from the tribe of Judah.

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:53.080
And so we find that here,

00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:55.080
no doubt there's a view.

00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:57.080
I mentioned already the purpose,

00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:59.080
the process and the prophetic view.

00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:00.080
There's a view here.

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:06.040
here in verses 8-12 that goes all the way through the Millennial Kingdom of Christ.

00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:10.080
All the way back in Genesis 49.

00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:14.340
I don't think Jacob fully understood all that he was saying.

00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:18.920
We understand that here as we have the whole canon of Scripture and we're able to compare

00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:26.720
Scripture with Scripture and we can see the far-reaching view of these statements made

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:29.600
by Jacob, these blessings if you will.

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:33.320
We find that he says in verse number 10, the scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a

00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:34.980
lawgiver from between his feet.

00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:37.920
Notice this, until Shiloh come.

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:43.360
It's kind of interesting because here in the text of Scripture in Genesis 49, Shiloh in

00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:51.640
verse number 11, excuse me, in verse number 10 is not a place, it's a person.

00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:52.720
A person.

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:57.960
You know Shiloh is very interesting, I mentioned this to Ronnie this afternoon, Shiloh has

00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:06.440
the same root Hebrew word, the Hebrew root word for Shiloh is the same as shalom or peace.

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:12.440
Now Jesus is the Prince of Peace, right?

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:19.040
We see that of course in Isaiah 9 and verse number 6 and we find here that indeed the

00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:27.160
Lord Jesus Christ is in view of being that one that will one day come, he is going to

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:30.520
rule and reign for a thousand years, amen?

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:34.800
I said this morning, it's worth repeating this evening, God's plan is going to come

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:35.800
to pass.

00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:38.040
Thy will be done.

00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:40.160
Listen there is going to be a rapture.

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:43.240
There is, there will be seven years of tribulation.

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:49.600
There will be a millennial reign of Christ and there will be eternity, hallelujah.

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:50.600
I'm thankful for that.

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:55.440
We stood and talked to a man yesterday, Tim was with me, I had both Joseph and Tim, we

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:59.400
took turns knocking doors yesterday so that we didn't show up with three of us at one

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:03.720
door, we just kind of rotated and we're there and one man says, I don't believe anything,

00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:06.000
I don't believe any of that.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.920
You're entitled to believe what you want to believe.

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:13.920
Everyone believes something and if you want to be your own authority, that's up to you

00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:18.920
but one day you're going to find out the truth, amen?

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:24.860
And here we have in view, look at the beautiful picture of peace and plenty that is painted

00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:31.300
for us in verses 11 and 12 which really will not be fully known until the millennial reign

00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:32.540
of Christ.

00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:37.100
In verse number 11 it says, binding is fall unto the vine.

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:39.460
No one does that.

00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:41.220
Why?

00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:47.460
Well because you're going to lose your animal because you're going to eat the vine, right?

00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:50.780
He says look and his ass is cold under the choice vine.

00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:55.460
They're going to eat it up and depart but it's going to be so plentiful, it's going

00:32:55.460 --> 00:33:02.020
to be so bountiful that one would be able to bind his fall unto the vine and his ass

00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:04.900
is cold unto the choice vine.

00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:07.180
What a beautiful picture.

00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:11.820
The verbiage that is used in verses 11 and 12 paint for us this beautiful picture of

00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:18.740
peace and plenty again which will not be fully realized or known until the millennial reign

00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:20.500
of Christ.

00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:22.960
God tells us much about the millennium.

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:26.820
We find that scattered throughout many of the prophets there are many references with

00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:31.820
regard to the millennial reign of Christ and we find that here all the way back in Genesis

00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:39.380
49 he speaks, Jacob does, when he is giving this blessing to Judah looking all the way

00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:44.380
through human history down to the millennial reign of Christ.

00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:47.140
That's amazing to me.

00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:52.540
God was no doubt working and I think about Jacob and it's evident as we consider one

00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:56.440
person said this, I think he was right on point when he made this statement.

00:33:56.440 --> 00:34:03.140
He said in his carnal or fleshly person Jacob would like to have given this blessing that

00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:07.660
he gives to Judah to Joseph.

00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:15.660
But in his spiritual man the blessing is given to Judah because that was God's plan.

00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:22.300
By the way, it ties hand in hand with the message from this morning, thy will be done.

00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:26.540
See Joseph was Jacob's favorite, was he not?

00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:28.060
He was the favorite son.

00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:29.820
He was the one that got the coat of many colors.

00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:36.060
He was the one that for 17 years, excuse me, for those first 17 years of his life he was

00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:40.400
the one that was well loved and favored and all the others knew it.

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:44.940
And then for over 20 years he's there in Egypt and all that takes place and then for

00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:51.540
17 years Jacob has an opportunity to see his son and to dwell there in the land.

00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:58.980
And maybe in the carnal, fleshly mind of the individual he'd want to give such a blessing

00:34:58.980 --> 00:34:59.980
to Joseph.

00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:04.060
But no, God said that blessing is for Judah.

00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:08.540
We find that from Judah, by the way if you think about the kings, Saul was the first

00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:12.380
one but that was not from the tribe of Judah, it was from the tribe of Benjamin and that

00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:16.220
was because the people wanted to have a king.

00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:20.900
We find that God did through Judah bring the kings and of course the Lord Jesus Christ

00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:22.620
who will reign one day.

00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:28.460
And so we look at these four sons and we find this picture this evening and I just wonder

00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:32.460
and we'll say this kind of as we go through the next several weeks of messages as well

00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:37.060
and look at each of these sons and what's mentioned about them and the tribes and what

00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:38.060
have you.

00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:43.100
But I wonder this evening, are we ready to stand in such a manner?

00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:48.700
I wonder this evening, you know the Bible talks about let a man examine himself, right?

00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:54.260
We read that often, we observe the Lord's Supper and what appropriate passage that is

00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:55.860
in 1 Corinthians 11.

00:35:55.860 --> 00:36:00.020
But the reality is that every day of our lives we're going to be examining ourselves, being

00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:04.980
ready to give an account because one day we will give an account.

00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:08.900
So we see here in this passage of Scripture, what a scene.

00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:17.260
We see that as Jacob is dying, he says, gather together and he begins to speak to his sons.

00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:21.620
We see Reuben, Simeon, Levi and Judah.

00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:26.340
Next week we'll look at the next however many and then we'll finish up Lord willing in a

00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:27.460
couple of weeks after that.

00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:28.460
Let's pray together.

00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:30.100
Father we do love you.

00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:34.020
We thank you for loving us and Lord I pray that as we look at a passage like this and

00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:40.740
we can dig in and we can see and trace things throughout the history of Israel and notice

00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:45.820
various things that are mentioned here and some of their fulfillment and some of the

00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:53.660
prophecy that still lies ahead of us and Lord we can just rejoice in this passage and what

00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:54.740
you've revealed to us.

00:36:54.740 --> 00:37:00.140
But I pray tonight that you'd help us to have a moment of examination Lord and help us to

00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:01.380
be ready to give an account.

00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:08.100
Lord we know that we are responsible, that Lord you've given us a responsibility.

00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:13.180
You've blessed us with so many opportunities and I wonder this evening even as we have

00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:19.020
this message right after we sing the song, I wonder have I done my best for Jesus?

00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:22.300
And Lord I pray that you'd have your will and way in our hearts and lives in these next

00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:23.300
few moments.

00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:25.620
We'll thank you for it in Christ's name we pray.

00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:26.620
Would you stand with me?

00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:27.620
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:29.660
She's going to play quietly on the piano.

00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:31.180
As she does the altar is open.
