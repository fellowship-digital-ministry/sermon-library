1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,719
up the 7th chapter of the book of 2 Kings and if you're looking here, of course we've

2
00:00:05,719 --> 00:00:10,199
been looking in this chapter for the last couple of weeks and you'll be remembering

3
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:15,560
with me as we've studied through the life of Elisha that in chapter number 6 God gives

4
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:21,639
us the record of how the Syrians had successfully besieged the city of Samaria.

5
00:00:21,639 --> 00:00:25,159
In fact the inhabitants of Samaria were desperate.

6
00:00:25,159 --> 00:00:29,879
The picture that we see in the end of 2 Kings chapter number 6 would reveal to us that they

7
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:37,159
were hopeless and they were helpless and we find that we enter into the 7th chapter

8
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:42,419
of the book of 2 Kings and in chapter number 7 the text reveals to us, it starts with this

9
00:00:42,419 --> 00:00:49,119
great prophecy from Elisha and we see the declaration of Elisha and he says,

10
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:52,139
Hear ye the word of the Lord, thus saith the Lord,

11
00:00:52,139 --> 00:00:57,639
and I mean the prophecy is given and it's a prophecy of provision and what a blessing

12
00:00:57,639 --> 00:01:06,279
to see the confidence and the content in which is given to us with regard to this

13
00:01:06,279 --> 00:01:07,279
prophecy.

14
00:01:07,279 --> 00:01:12,580
Of course as we studied last week, the text of scripture then follows the lives of these

15
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:17,120
four leprous men and as you read about those four leprous men, remember they go through

16
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:22,199
that process of if we stay here we're going to die, if we go to Samaria there's no food

17
00:01:22,199 --> 00:01:26,160
there so we're probably going to die, but there's this potential that we can go to the

18
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:32,000
Syrians and they might show us kindness and we might live, they might kill us and so the

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,959
only hope of survival in their minds as they went through the process of determining the

20
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:43,639
decision that they would make, they determined that they would go and they would fall into

21
00:01:43,639 --> 00:01:44,639
the Syrians.

22
00:01:44,639 --> 00:01:50,339
Of course you'll remember that they get to the camp and there's no Syrians and the Lord

23
00:01:50,339 --> 00:01:56,819
had been working and the Lord had allowed the Syrians to hear this noise and he allowed

24
00:01:56,819 --> 00:02:02,180
them to hear a noise of chariots, a noise of horses, it was a great host of noise that

25
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:09,460
these soldiers, these warriors heard and they concluded that the king of Israel had hired

26
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:16,339
the Hittites and the kings of Egypt to come upon them and so they fled and we find that

27
00:02:16,339 --> 00:02:22,619
these leprous men, as we concluded last week, they said, we do not well.

28
00:02:22,619 --> 00:02:28,660
Today is a day of good tidings and we hold our peace and so they went back to the city

29
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,539
of Samaria and that's where we pick up this evening.

30
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:35,059
We find in our text of Scripture, we'll be looking at verses 11 through 20, I want you

31
00:02:35,059 --> 00:02:39,259
to notice verse number 16 and we'll read all of the text as we get through the message

32
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:43,899
this evening, but notice with me in verse number 16 the Bible says, and the people went

33
00:02:43,899 --> 00:02:48,179
out and spoiled the tents of the Syrians.

34
00:02:48,179 --> 00:02:53,899
So a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel and two measures of barley for a shekel

35
00:02:53,899 --> 00:02:57,639
according to the word of the Lord.

36
00:02:57,639 --> 00:03:01,899
If you're taking notes this evening, I've simply titled the message from verse number

37
00:03:01,899 --> 00:03:06,899
16, they spoiled the tents of the Syrians.

38
00:03:06,899 --> 00:03:12,479
They being the inhabitants of Samaria, the children of Israel, they spoiled the tents

39
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:13,919
of the Syrians.

40
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:17,440
As we look at our text of Scripture and work through the passage this evening, notice with

41
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,460
me first of all the doubt of the king.

42
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:25,600
In verse number 11, remember those four leprous men returned and they began to share tidings

43
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:30,039
about what it was that they had encountered and the Bible says he called the porters and

44
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:32,559
they told it to the king's house within.

45
00:03:32,559 --> 00:03:36,559
Notice verse number 12, and the king arose in the night and said unto his servants, I

46
00:03:36,559 --> 00:03:39,720
will now show you what the Syrians have done to us.

47
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,479
They know that we be hungry, therefore they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in

48
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:49,440
the field saying, when they come out of the city, we shall catch them alive and get into

49
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,000
the city.

50
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,720
And one of his servants answered and said, let some take, I pray thee, five of the horses

51
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,039
that remain, which are left in the city.

52
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:01,320
By the way, when you see that there are five of the horses that remain, obviously there

53
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,360
weren't a large number of horses that were there.

54
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:10,399
This siege that the Syrians had laid upon Samaria was just met with grave consequences.

55
00:04:10,399 --> 00:04:14,320
It continues and says, behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel that are left

56
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,320
in it.

57
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:19,959
Behold, I say, they are even as all the multitude of the Israelites that are consumed, and let

58
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,079
us send and see.

59
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,040
When we think about the doubt of the king, we find first of all that he received the

60
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,600
message from these four leprous men.

61
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,760
He received the message.

62
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:34,959
The Bible tells us in verse number 11 that when these, in verse number 10, when these

63
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:39,679
four leprous men came, they called him to the port of the city and they told him.

64
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:41,200
What did they tell the port of the city?

65
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:46,959
Well, according to verse number 10, they told this man, we came to the camp of the Syrians

66
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:52,640
and behold, there was no man there, neither voice of man, but horses tied and asses tied

67
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,480
and the tents as they were.

68
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:01,399
And so the Bible reveals to us in verse number 11 that he called the porters and they told

69
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:06,519
it to the king's house within, and then it tells us that the king arose in the night

70
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:08,559
and said unto his servants.

71
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:15,640
And so we find, according to verses 10 through 12, that the king received the message.

72
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:19,640
He received this faith, this good tidings.

73
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,279
That's how these four leprous men referred to it.

74
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:25,559
They said, this is a day of good tidings.

75
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:26,920
And what good news it was.

76
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:31,760
I mean, could you imagine being there in Samaria, we've gone through the sixth chapter already

77
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:38,160
and we've dealt with the severity of this situation and the fact that they had nothing

78
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,079
and they had turned to cannibalism.

79
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:44,359
I mean, it was a terrible, terrible situation.

80
00:05:44,359 --> 00:05:51,480
And now these four leprous men bring these good tidings and the king receives the message,

81
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,559
but he did not believe.

82
00:05:53,559 --> 00:05:55,160
He did not believe.

83
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:00,839
The Bible tells us that he concluded that really what was going on is the Syrians had

84
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:01,839
set a trap.

85
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:04,519
And he says, here, I'm going to tell you what's going on.

86
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:09,000
He tells them in verse number 12 that he said unto his servants, I will now show you what

87
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,519
the Syrians have done to us.

88
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:18,480
They know that we be hungry, therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves

89
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:24,079
in the field saying when they come out of the city, we shall catch them alive and get

90
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:25,399
into the city.

91
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:29,559
So he believed that there was a trap that had been set, that the Syrians had devised

92
00:06:29,559 --> 00:06:30,559
this plan.

93
00:06:30,559 --> 00:06:35,380
They knew that they had been successful at causing the city of Samaria to be without

94
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:39,320
and these inhabitants were hungry and they said, so here's what we'll do.

95
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:43,600
We're going to go hide and then they'll come out of the city and we'll then be able to

96
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,040
take the city.

97
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,839
And that was the conclusion that the king reached.

98
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:53,160
We find, however, that there were some servants, the Bible says in verse number 13, that there

99
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:58,399
were some servants there and one of them answered the king and he really was pleading with the

100
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:00,079
king.

101
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:07,119
And he says at the very end of the text, verse number 13, let us send and see.

102
00:07:07,119 --> 00:07:13,200
Let us at least go and investigate the claim that's been made by these four leprous men.

103
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:20,279
I mean, we have heard these good tidings and the king concluded something entirely different

104
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:25,679
and yet there's this servant really, I believe, that's pleading with the king and he's saying,

105
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:29,839
let's just send a few messengers and let them go and see.

106
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:31,959
And the king finally gives in.

107
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:36,799
The king, according to verse number 14, he gives in and he sends out these messengers

108
00:07:36,799 --> 00:07:38,920
to go verify the situation.

109
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:44,040
It says, then took, therefore, two chariot horses and the king sent after the host of

110
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,920
the Syrians saying, go and see.

111
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:54,920
Now I'm not sure if you can put your mind into each character throughout the passage

112
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:59,299
of Scripture that we deal with and looking at how the king was feeling and kind of put

113
00:07:59,299 --> 00:08:04,720
yourself in his shoes and trying to evaluate the situation, put yourself in the servant's

114
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,880
shoes that's pleading to send some messengers.

115
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,359
But now think about being one of the messengers.

116
00:08:10,359 --> 00:08:13,679
You've heard the report from the four leprous men.

117
00:08:13,679 --> 00:08:18,160
Perhaps you're aware of what they've concluded and what they've brought as these good tidings,

118
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,079
but you've also heard what the king said.

119
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:22,679
And so you don't know what you're going to find.

120
00:08:22,679 --> 00:08:25,519
You're going out and you go and see.

121
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:30,239
And so we find in these first few verses of the text before us this evening, the doubt

122
00:08:30,239 --> 00:08:31,839
of the king.

123
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:37,700
And we find as we move forward through the passage, the discovery of the messengers.

124
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:42,380
And the Bible tells us that they were given this responsibility to go and see.

125
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:47,260
And in verse number 15, it tells us, and they went after them unto Jordan.

126
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:56,219
Notice what the Bible says, and lo, all the way was full of garments and vessels, which

127
00:08:56,219 --> 00:08:59,820
the Syrians had cast away in their haste.

128
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,739
And the messengers returned and told the king.

129
00:09:02,739 --> 00:09:05,219
So I want you to think about these messengers.

130
00:09:05,219 --> 00:09:10,020
And as they went, and the Bible tells us that the entire way, all the way, it was full

131
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,859
of garments and vessels.

132
00:09:11,859 --> 00:09:17,859
Now remember, those four leprous men, the Bible tells us in verse number eight that

133
00:09:17,859 --> 00:09:20,940
when they went out, they were at the uttermost part of the camp.

134
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:26,140
They went into one tent, they did eat and drink, carried then silver and gold and raiment

135
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,859
and went and hid it.

136
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:31,979
Came again and entered into another tent and carried then also and went and hid it.

137
00:09:31,979 --> 00:09:35,820
And so we find that these messengers are now sent on this mission.

138
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:42,539
They have their marching orders, if you will, go and see, find out, verify that this claim

139
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:44,099
is really true.

140
00:09:44,099 --> 00:09:49,940
The king has his doubt, but then we find the discovery of these men, these messengers that

141
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:50,940
go out.

142
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,380
They find that it's full of garments and vessels.

143
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,900
There are no Syrians to be seen.

144
00:09:55,900 --> 00:10:00,219
We know because we're reading the written, recorded Word of God.

145
00:10:00,219 --> 00:10:05,439
that the Syrians fled because of what we mentioned in verse number six that the

146
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:09,599
Lord caused them to hear this great noise. And they fled and they left

147
00:10:09,599 --> 00:10:13,519
everything. What was God doing? God was fulfilling the prophecy that He had

148
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:19,719
given by the prophet Elisha. We know that God is able to do all things. He works in

149
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:23,279
a number of different ways. We find that it's interesting as you study the

150
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:28,119
scriptures and you study the various accounts that God gives us that God

151
00:10:28,119 --> 00:10:34,499
doesn't always work in the same way every time. But God always works. And we

152
00:10:34,499 --> 00:10:40,499
find here that God is working and these messengers they find all of these

153
00:10:40,499 --> 00:10:45,939
things. They find all of the substance. They find it just as the leper said. And

154
00:10:45,939 --> 00:10:50,199
we find that the Bible tells us at the end of verse number 15 that the

155
00:10:50,199 --> 00:10:57,499
messengers returned and told the king. Now I'd like to see the face of the king

156
00:10:57,559 --> 00:11:03,919
when these messengers returned with their verifying this claim of

157
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:07,879
these leprous men. And they come back. I'm assuming that they come back with a

158
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:14,159
level of excitement. I'm assuming that they come back with a readiness of going

159
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:19,479
and spoiling because we find that as we read in verse number 16 this fulfilled

160
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:24,479
prophecy, it's recorded in verse 16 and again in verse number 18, we find the

161
00:11:24,499 --> 00:11:29,219
fulfillment of the prophecy. The Bible says, and the people went out. Now these

162
00:11:29,219 --> 00:11:35,339
people were hungry. They had been dealing with this being besieged by the Syrians.

163
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:40,499
And we find that they went out and notice it says they spoiled the tents of

164
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:47,899
the Syrians. And then notice what it says. So a measure of fine flour was sold for

165
00:11:47,899 --> 00:11:54,299
a shekel and two measures of barley for a shekel. And then notice this phrase

166
00:11:54,299 --> 00:12:00,479
at the end of verse number 16, according to the word of the Lord. You remember

167
00:12:00,479 --> 00:12:04,119
that it was Elisha that stood up in verse number one. We said in the

168
00:12:04,119 --> 00:12:09,119
beginning even of our message this evening that this prophecy of provision,

169
00:12:09,119 --> 00:12:16,239
it was a detailed prophecy. We find that he, Elisha, stood up and said, hear ye the

170
00:12:16,239 --> 00:12:22,979
word of the Lord, thus saith the Lord. Notice tomorrow. Thus, he says, about this

171
00:12:22,979 --> 00:12:28,859
time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekel and two measures of

172
00:12:28,859 --> 00:12:34,479
barley for a shekel in the gate of Samaria. How did Elisha know that?

173
00:12:34,479 --> 00:12:41,319
Because God informed him. See, we serve the God that is eternal. He is, of course, he

174
00:12:41,319 --> 00:12:46,199
transcends time. He knows the end from the beginning. And so this prophecy of

175
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:52,039
provision that was given, we can see that it could be given with exact details as

176
00:12:52,059 --> 00:12:56,299
to what was going to happen. What was going to take place? It was going to be

177
00:12:56,299 --> 00:13:01,939
this measure, as we find here, of fine flour for a shekel and two measures of

178
00:13:01,939 --> 00:13:06,379
barley for a shekel. When was it going to happen? Tomorrow, about this time. Where

179
00:13:06,379 --> 00:13:11,259
was it going to happen? At the gate of Samaria. And we find that the very

180
00:13:11,259 --> 00:13:17,459
details in which God had given to Elisha, Elisha would speak those details and it

181
00:13:17,479 --> 00:13:22,679
comes to pass according to the Word of the Lord. This encourages us because we

182
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:28,739
know that God always does what God says he will do. In fact, a prophet, as you

183
00:13:28,739 --> 00:13:33,839
would study the Scriptures, if they would prophesy and it did not come to pass, it

184
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:38,639
was kind of a bad deal for them. They'd be put to death. But we know that Elisha

185
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:44,839
is a true prophet of God, and he's speaking the Word of God, and he stands

186
00:13:44,979 --> 00:13:48,459
up with a level of confidence. We mentioned that when we studied the

187
00:13:48,459 --> 00:13:53,839
prophecy a couple of weeks ago, and we spoke about the confidence that Elisha

188
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:59,979
had. And see, the reality today is that we have the complete canon of Scripture. We

189
00:13:59,979 --> 00:14:04,819
have truth that God has given us with regard to these last days in which we're

190
00:14:04,819 --> 00:14:09,439
living. We have truth that God has given us with regard to eschatology and the

191
00:14:09,439 --> 00:14:14,099
last days and the things that are going to still come to pass. We have the truth

192
00:14:14,099 --> 00:14:19,439
that Jesus Christ said, I will come again, and we can be very confident about

193
00:14:19,439 --> 00:14:24,879
that. We don't have to kind of, well, I think, no, he said he's gonna come again,

194
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:30,239
and we believe him. Why? Because he always does what he says he's going to do. We

195
00:14:30,239 --> 00:14:33,799
can read throughout the pages of Scripture, and we can see fulfilled

196
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:38,439
prophecy after fulfilled prophecy. We can see it in the life and ministry of the

197
00:14:38,439 --> 00:14:42,719
Lord Jesus Christ, and he gave his very word that he's coming again. I am

198
00:14:42,739 --> 00:14:47,819
understanding the Word of God to teach that the rapture is imminent. I mean, it

199
00:14:47,819 --> 00:14:53,399
could happen at any moment. We sing songs such as, listen for the trumpet, Jesus is

200
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:58,499
coming again, and we are absolutely assured of this truth. We understand that

201
00:14:58,499 --> 00:15:03,139
after that there will be a tribulation, seven years. There will be judgment that

202
00:15:03,139 --> 00:15:07,219
will be poured out upon the earth. We read about all of those judgments

203
00:15:07,219 --> 00:15:12,179
throughout the book of Revelation. There will be a judgment seat of Christ. There

204
00:15:12,199 --> 00:15:17,359
will be a marriage supper of the Lamb. There will be a great white throne. There

205
00:15:17,359 --> 00:15:22,319
will be all of eternity. We can be sure of it. We can be confident of it. Why?

206
00:15:22,319 --> 00:15:28,679
Because God's given us his Word, and we can, well, you remember there were

207
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:33,879
scoffers in those days. Peter deals with that in 2 Peter chapter number 3 when he

208
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:39,039
speaks specifically about the return of the Lord Jesus Christ, and it tells us in

209
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:43,899
2 Peter chapter number 3, in verse number 3, in fact, knowing this verse,

210
00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:48,699
that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lust.

211
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:52,379
And what is it that they're going to say? Well, according to verse number 4, where

212
00:15:52,379 --> 00:15:57,499
is the promise of his coming? You know what that tells me? They've heard that

213
00:15:57,499 --> 00:16:03,339
Jesus is going to come, but they don't believe it. They're scoffers. They're

214
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:10,559
mockers. We find that they use their faulty logic. They are willingly ignorant

215
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:16,839
according to verse number 5, but we find that the answer comes, the Lord is not

216
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:21,399
slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness. But as longsuffering to

217
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:24,359
us were not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to

218
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:29,159
repentance. In verse number 9, it says in verse number 10, the day of the Lord will

219
00:16:29,219 --> 00:16:35,019
come as a thief in the night. I mean, it's certain. It's absolutely positive, and we

220
00:16:35,019 --> 00:16:39,739
can have confidence. When we place our faith and trust in the truth of this

221
00:16:39,739 --> 00:16:45,699
book, we can have absolute confidence in what God says, knowing that it will come

222
00:16:45,699 --> 00:16:51,979
to pass. We find that Elisha makes this declaration, and we find that this

223
00:16:51,979 --> 00:16:56,819
prophecy is recorded, and it comes to pass according to the word of the Lord.

224
00:16:56,839 --> 00:17:01,379
Notice in verse number 18, and it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the

225
00:17:01,379 --> 00:17:05,519
king, saying, two measures of barley for a shekel and a measure of fine flour for

226
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:10,479
a shekel shall be tomorrow about this time in the gate of Samaria, and that's

227
00:17:10,479 --> 00:17:14,199
exactly what happened. And here's what's happening, is there's the rehearsing, if

228
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:19,119
you will, of the prophecy there in verse number 18, that this was going to happen.

229
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:26,239
And what happens now is God is going to remind us of that one servant that

230
00:17:26,259 --> 00:17:32,479
was kind of mocking and scoffing at the prophecy of Elisha, that prophecy of

231
00:17:32,479 --> 00:17:36,679
provision, and so we move from the doubt of the king to the discovery of the

232
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:40,819
messengers, and then notice with me number three, the death of the servant.

233
00:17:40,819 --> 00:17:44,939
The death of the servant. We read in verse number 17 that the Bible says that

234
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:49,979
the king appointed the Lord on whose hand he leaned

235
00:17:49,979 --> 00:17:54,579
to have the charge of the gate. The people trod upon him in the gate, and he

236
00:17:54,639 --> 00:18:00,039
died, as the man of God had said, who spake when the king came down to him. Do

237
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:03,459
you remember what he said? It's recorded again for us in verse number 19, and the

238
00:18:03,459 --> 00:18:07,959
Lord answered the man of God. Elisha stands up, and he makes that prophecy. He

239
00:18:07,959 --> 00:18:15,279
delivers the the word of the Lord, and this man responds to Elisha and says, as

240
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:22,859
we read in verse number 19, behold, if the Lord should make windows in heaven, might

241
00:18:22,859 --> 00:18:31,559
such a thing be. And he, that's Elisha, said unto this servant, behold, thou

242
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:39,159
shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof. And so it fell out unto

243
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:46,119
him, for the people trod upon him in the gate, and he died. Now, we mentioned a few

244
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:51,359
weeks ago as we studied verses 1 and 2 of 2 Kings 7, and we dealt with the way

245
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:56,779
in which this man replied to Elisha, and we mentioned that it was evident that he

246
00:18:56,779 --> 00:19:03,419
was coming with an attitude of being a scoffer, at mocking the man of God, and we

247
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:08,459
understand that because of the demise of this man, what happens. We find that

248
00:19:08,459 --> 00:19:14,099
Elisha announced that this man would, he would see it with his eyes, but that he

249
00:19:14,099 --> 00:19:19,179
would not taste it, he would not eat it, he would not have the privilege of

250
00:19:19,179 --> 00:19:24,439
partaking of that sustenance, that substance that would be found, as they

251
00:19:24,439 --> 00:19:30,399
would spoil the tents of the Syrians. They said that it was going to be

252
00:19:30,399 --> 00:19:34,319
specific, a measure of fine flour for a shekel, two measures of barley for a

253
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:38,159
shekel. He told him the time, tomorrow about this time, and he told him where,

254
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:41,959
at the gate of Samaria. And it's interesting because the king appointed

255
00:19:41,959 --> 00:19:46,319
the Lord, according to verse number 17, on whose hand he leaned, to have the charge

256
00:19:46,579 --> 00:19:50,299
what? Of the gate. Well that's where all the stuff was happening. I mean, these

257
00:19:50,299 --> 00:19:54,099
people are hungry. Can you see? I mean, you ever been out Black Friday shopping?

258
00:19:54,099 --> 00:19:58,299
It's insane, right? People trying to run people over to get something. Well,

259
00:19:58,299 --> 00:20:02,179
this was, I mean, this was...

260
00:20:02,179 --> 00:20:05,679
is that times 1,000 probably,

261
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,139
because what you're seeing

262
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:09,599
is a bunch of people that have been starving

263
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,339
and they're hopeless and helpless,

264
00:20:11,339 --> 00:20:12,839
and now there's substance.

265
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:14,799
Now there's something that's available.

266
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,719
And we find that the Bible tells us

267
00:20:16,719 --> 00:20:20,679
that the people trod upon Him in the gate

268
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:22,939
and He died.

269
00:20:22,939 --> 00:20:26,679
It's tragic what happened to this man.

270
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:29,679
We find this scoffer,

271
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:35,099
this one that was mocking the prophecy of Elisha.

272
00:20:35,099 --> 00:20:37,059
Oh, really, Elisha?

273
00:20:37,059 --> 00:20:39,019
I mean, do you not know what's going on?

274
00:20:39,019 --> 00:20:41,599
I understand that that's not what the Scriptures say,

275
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:43,719
but I get in my mind's eye

276
00:20:43,719 --> 00:20:46,339
as I see the words of this man

277
00:20:46,339 --> 00:20:49,059
and I see the end of this man.

278
00:20:49,059 --> 00:20:50,719
We find that he says,

279
00:20:50,719 --> 00:20:52,879
if the Lord would make windows in heaven,

280
00:20:52,879 --> 00:20:54,059
might this thing be?

281
00:20:54,059 --> 00:20:57,939
He's mocking. He's a scoffer.

282
00:20:57,979 --> 00:21:00,779
We find the death of the servant.

283
00:21:00,779 --> 00:21:02,819
As we look through the passage of Scripture

284
00:21:02,819 --> 00:21:04,979
and we end, we can rejoice in understanding

285
00:21:04,979 --> 00:21:09,239
that the Lord provided just as He said He would.

286
00:21:09,239 --> 00:21:13,319
Remember, it was at the end of chapter 6.

287
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:15,279
The Bible tells us in v. 33,

288
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:16,979
and while He yet talked with them,

289
00:21:16,979 --> 00:21:18,939
behold, the messenger came down unto Him

290
00:21:18,939 --> 00:21:21,779
and He said, behold, this evil is of the Lord.

291
00:21:21,779 --> 00:21:24,519
What should I wait for the Lord any longer?

292
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:27,159
The king didn't want to wait any longer.

293
00:21:27,199 --> 00:21:30,159
Elisha says, tomorrow, about this time,

294
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:32,699
here's what's going to happen.

295
00:21:32,699 --> 00:21:35,039
We find that God fulfilled.

296
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:40,239
God did exactly what He said He would.

297
00:21:40,239 --> 00:21:44,419
It's unusual how He accomplished His will.

298
00:21:44,419 --> 00:21:47,159
I mean, can you imagine a mighty army,

299
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:49,879
the Syrians, being scared away

300
00:21:49,879 --> 00:21:52,159
because of a noise that they heard?

301
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:53,499
God calls them to hear a noise.

302
00:21:53,499 --> 00:21:55,579
I mean, it was serious.

303
00:21:55,619 --> 00:21:57,419
God provided.

304
00:21:57,419 --> 00:22:00,539
See, I like, as we look through the Scriptures

305
00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:02,659
and even as we examine our own lives,

306
00:22:02,659 --> 00:22:04,999
it's so encouraging when we have the opportunity

307
00:22:04,999 --> 00:22:07,879
to see God work in such a way

308
00:22:07,879 --> 00:22:11,459
that it can only be that God did it.

309
00:22:11,459 --> 00:22:14,299
See, there was no way possible

310
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:16,299
that the inhabitants of Samaria,

311
00:22:16,299 --> 00:22:18,659
these hopeless and helpless,

312
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:20,799
these desperate individuals,

313
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,379
there was no way that they could bring this

314
00:22:22,379 --> 00:22:24,659
to pass on their own.

315
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:26,539
And yet, God worked.

316
00:22:26,539 --> 00:22:27,919
And see, our God is able to do

317
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:29,659
as we often quote Ephesians 3

318
00:22:29,659 --> 00:22:30,539
in verse number 20,

319
00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:33,500
exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think.

320
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,159
The king doubted.

321
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,079
But what was being communicated to him

322
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:42,159
from those four leprous men to the porter

323
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:46,299
to his home was that God had worked.

324
00:22:46,299 --> 00:22:49,699
And see, today, God still works.

325
00:22:49,699 --> 00:22:51,239
God's still on His throne.

326
00:22:51,239 --> 00:22:52,539
God's still eternal.

327
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:53,739
He's still omnipotent.

328
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:55,319
He's still able.

329
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:59,039
We find that God works in very specific ways

330
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,119
and He works in ways in which He alone

331
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:02,899
would be glorified.

332
00:23:02,899 --> 00:23:05,539
We see it throughout all of the Scripture.

333
00:23:05,539 --> 00:23:08,899
And oh, we can rest assured this evening

334
00:23:08,899 --> 00:23:12,279
that God will always do what God said He will do.

335
00:23:12,279 --> 00:23:14,079
And I am so thankful that as we read

336
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:16,819
a passage of Scripture in the life of Elisha

337
00:23:16,819 --> 00:23:18,119
and we see what's taking place

338
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:20,319
to reference what we said in the very beginning,

339
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:22,079
Elisha didn't have to be so concerned

340
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:24,239
with how God was going to do it.

341
00:23:24,239 --> 00:23:26,279
He just needed to know that it was God

342
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:28,159
who said He would do it.

343
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:31,699
And we focus on who, not how.

344
00:23:31,699 --> 00:23:34,419
Remember, it was Paul that was there shipwrecked

345
00:23:34,419 --> 00:23:37,619
in Acts 27 and we referenced that passage

346
00:23:37,619 --> 00:23:39,279
of Scripture a few weeks ago.

347
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:42,159
And I mean, it was a bad situation.

348
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:45,699
Uruk-Hidem was upon them, that terrible storm.

349
00:23:45,699 --> 00:23:47,539
They were wishing for the day.

350
00:23:47,539 --> 00:23:49,419
They had not seen the moon, the sun,

351
00:23:49,419 --> 00:23:51,159
the stars in a number of days.

352
00:23:51,199 --> 00:23:53,739
All hope was gone that they would be saved.

353
00:23:54,899 --> 00:23:59,000
And yet God came and delivered a message to Paul.

354
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,359
What does Paul say?

355
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:02,159
I believe God.

356
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,399
I don't need to know how God's gonna spare us,

357
00:24:05,399 --> 00:24:07,479
but I just know that God is,

358
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:09,739
because God said that He would.

359
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:11,439
Our God is able.

360
00:24:11,439 --> 00:24:14,659
And we need to focus on who, not how.

361
00:24:14,659 --> 00:24:18,039
So often I think we get kinda twisted up, if you will,

362
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:19,239
because we're always trying to figure out

363
00:24:19,239 --> 00:24:21,279
how God's gonna do something,

364
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,359
instead of just understanding that God can do it

365
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:25,279
however He wants to do it.

366
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,119
And most times He does it in a way

367
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:30,160
that only He will be glorified.

368
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,079
Father, we love You.

369
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:32,899
We thank You for loving us.

370
00:24:32,899 --> 00:24:36,940
Thank You for Thy Word, the truth contained therein.

371
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:39,160
We pray, Lord, that You would help us

372
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,660
to be encouraged this evening,

373
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:43,079
to be reminded once again that You always do

374
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:44,779
what You say You will do,

375
00:24:44,779 --> 00:24:49,079
even as we quickly reviewed some promises

376
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:51,339
that You've given us concerning the end times

377
00:24:51,339 --> 00:24:54,239
and looking at some of these things that we know

378
00:24:54,239 --> 00:24:55,500
will soon come to pass.

379
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,500
Lord, I pray that You would help us

380
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,160
to have a level of confidence

381
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:03,419
in knowing that You will do what You said You will do.

382
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:07,039
Father, I pray that You would work in and through our lives,

383
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,539
that You would work in such a way

384
00:25:08,539 --> 00:25:10,839
that You alone would be glorified.

385
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:13,039
Each one within our congregation

386
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:16,500
has unique circumstances and unique situations

387
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,759
in which they're dealing with.

388
00:25:17,799 --> 00:25:20,380
And God, we pray that You'd be glorified

389
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,139
in each of our lives.

390
00:25:22,139 --> 00:25:24,179
We thank You that You hear and answer prayer.

391
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:27,339
We thank You that You are the Lord God Almighty.

392
00:25:27,339 --> 00:25:29,100
We pray that You'd bless our time of prayer.

393
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,299
We thank You for the privilege.

394
00:25:31,299 --> 00:25:35,100
We pray that as we here at the church house pray together,

395
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,759
I pray that our season of prayer would be sweet.

396
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:39,259
Lord, I pray for each family,

397
00:25:39,259 --> 00:25:42,339
each individual that's tuned in to watch this evening.

398
00:25:42,339 --> 00:25:44,979
Lord, I pray that as we conclude the live stream,

399
00:25:44,979 --> 00:25:47,639
that they would spend time in prayer at home.

400
00:25:47,639 --> 00:25:51,720
Lord, that You would work as only You can.

401
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:55,940
We know that You have given us the privilege of prayer.

402
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,479
We know the power of prayer.

403
00:25:58,479 --> 00:26:01,139
I pray, Lord, that we would honor You

404
00:26:01,139 --> 00:26:03,779
and show our dependence upon Thee

405
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:06,220
as we seek Your face in prayer.

406
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:08,359
We'll give You honor and glory for all that You'll do.

407
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:11,220
We do ask that You would bless the AWANA meetings.

408
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,479
I thank You for each of our teachers and workers

409
00:26:13,479 --> 00:26:16,979
who have been faithful to continue

410
00:26:16,979 --> 00:26:20,859
in seeking to encourage and influence these young people.

411
00:26:20,859 --> 00:26:23,279
I pray, God, that You'd bless them, encourage them,

412
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:26,239
give them sweet times of fellowship

413
00:26:26,239 --> 00:26:28,160
and encouragement on the phones.

414
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,559
And Lord, we'll thank You for what You'll do there.

415
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:33,359
For it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
