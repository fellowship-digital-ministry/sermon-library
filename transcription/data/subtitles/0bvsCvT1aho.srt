1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,599
1 John chapter number two and verse number six.

2
00:00:03,599 --> 00:00:06,559
And we, of course, this Wednesday is actually

3
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:09,319
our fourth week dealing with this thought

4
00:00:09,319 --> 00:00:11,859
from 1 John chapter two and verse number six.

5
00:00:11,859 --> 00:00:14,800
And we've been dealing for a number of months now

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,239
here on Wednesday evenings with this series

7
00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:20,020
doing what we ought to do.

8
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,799
And a few weeks ago, as we started looking

9
00:00:22,799 --> 00:00:26,200
at 1 John chapter number six, we said this,

10
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,040
that we ought to walk as Christ walked.

11
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,440
And we gather that from this verse of scripture

12
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,759
in 1 John two and verse six.

13
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:37,279
The Bible says, he that saith he abideth in him,

14
00:00:37,279 --> 00:00:42,279
notice, ought himself also so to walk even as he walked.

15
00:00:44,959 --> 00:00:48,119
And of course, as we've gone through these last few weeks,

16
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:52,000
we said that Jesus walked wisely, he walked humbly,

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,680
he walked purposefully.

18
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,380
And last week we dealt with the subject

19
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:58,360
that he walked courageously.

20
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:00,319
And I'm thankful for the opportunity

21
00:01:00,319 --> 00:01:02,400
that we have to study the New Testament

22
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,080
and specifically with regard to this thought

23
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,160
as dealing with walking as Christ walked,

24
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,919
that we have the gospel records

25
00:01:09,919 --> 00:01:11,580
that have been provided for us

26
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:15,599
so that we can see how Christ lived his life,

27
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:18,580
how he walked, how he left us an example

28
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:21,040
that we should follow his steps.

29
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,559
And so this evening, it's the fifth point

30
00:01:23,559 --> 00:01:25,080
in this little mini series,

31
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,319
but it's the only one that we'll look at tonight.

32
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:29,680
I want you to consider this truth,

33
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,440
Jesus walked compassionately.

34
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,239
He walked compassionately.

35
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:36,440
And go back to the book of Mark, if you will,

36
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,279
we're gonna look at two passages of scripture

37
00:01:39,279 --> 00:01:41,400
in the gospels to prove the point

38
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,279
that our Lord walked with compassion

39
00:01:44,279 --> 00:01:46,559
and dealing with that subject

40
00:01:46,559 --> 00:01:49,319
and then what it means for us, for you and for me

41
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:51,959
to also walk with compassion.

42
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:56,040
How is it that we can walk with compassion as Christ did?

43
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,199
What does that look like?

44
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,879
What does it mean?

45
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:00,879
And so notice, if you will,

46
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:02,680
there in Mark chapter number one,

47
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,459
pick it up with me in verse number 40.

48
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:06,519
The Bible says this,

49
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:09,360
and there came a leper to him,

50
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,740
beseeching him and kneeling down to him

51
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,440
and saying unto him,

52
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:19,440
if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.

53
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:22,339
I want you to notice several things about this leper.

54
00:02:22,339 --> 00:02:25,639
We're gonna look at verse 41 and 42 in just a moment

55
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:29,279
as we deal with how Christ walked compassionately.

56
00:02:29,279 --> 00:02:32,000
But I want you to notice just a few things about this leper

57
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,399
as the Bible tells us in verse number 40

58
00:02:34,399 --> 00:02:35,679
that there was this leper.

59
00:02:35,679 --> 00:02:39,720
And of course, we understand the difficulty with leprosy

60
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,520
and the problem during,

61
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,160
especially in this particular time and what's going on.

62
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,880
The Bible says that he came to Jesus,

63
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,800
notice, beseeching him, begging,

64
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,960
and kneeling down to him.

65
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,919
And then notice what he says at the end of verse number 40.

66
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:00,919
He says, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.

67
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:05,360
And I love the way that this leper approaches

68
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,619
the Lord Jesus Christ,

69
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:09,559
because he obviously understood something

70
00:03:09,559 --> 00:03:11,960
about the power of the Lord Jesus Christ.

71
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:16,800
He understood that Christ had the power to heal him.

72
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,160
That's pretty amazing.

73
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,360
And you see the faith of the individual coming and asking,

74
00:03:22,399 --> 00:03:25,119
he's not gonna ask if he doesn't think it's possible.

75
00:03:25,119 --> 00:03:26,720
And he says that he knew this,

76
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,759
he had this understanding, if thou wilt.

77
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:31,720
Now, listen, we have to recognize

78
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,960
it's gotta be within God's will.

79
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,800
Amen.

80
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,800
And God can do anything.

81
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,160
And there are times in which,

82
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,440
and we find the scripture say

83
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,199
that we're to pray according to his will.

84
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:45,279
And we understand that principle.

85
00:03:45,279 --> 00:03:47,960
And here this leper says, if thou wilt,

86
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,080
thou canst make me clean.

87
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,919
And notice what Jesus in the response in verse 41,

88
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:57,199
the Bible says in Jesus, notice this,

89
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:59,979
moved with compassion.

90
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,720
He put forth his hand and touched him

91
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:08,720
and saith unto him, I will, be thou clean.

92
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,839
I want you to notice where the Bible says

93
00:04:11,839 --> 00:04:14,259
that he was moved with compassion.

94
00:04:14,259 --> 00:04:16,600
We find that that word compassion,

95
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,200
that emotion, if you will,

96
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,440
it carries with it the idea of painful sympathy.

97
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,839
It's really a mixed passion

98
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:27,200
compounded of both love and sorrow.

99
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,679
And we come up with this truth of the Lord Jesus Christ,

100
00:04:31,679 --> 00:04:33,239
he's moved with compassion,

101
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:36,720
he sees the condition of this individual.

102
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,720
And here in Mark chapter number one,

103
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,799
we find that Jesus is moved with compassion

104
00:04:42,799 --> 00:04:45,359
because of a physical need,

105
00:04:45,359 --> 00:04:47,320
because of a physical ailment,

106
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,880
because of something that was wrong

107
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,000
with this man physically, he was a leper.

108
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,959
And this was a serious condition, a serious situation.

109
00:04:55,959 --> 00:05:00,399
And the Bible says that Jesus is moved with compassion.

110
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:03,320
He puts forth his hand and he simply says this

111
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,679
after he touches him, by the way,

112
00:05:05,679 --> 00:05:07,640
that's amazing in of itself

113
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,679
because you wouldn't touch a leper.

114
00:05:09,679 --> 00:05:14,679
And he touched him and he said, I will, be thou clean.

115
00:05:15,679 --> 00:05:19,239
Now, I believe that the leper probably was pretty thankful

116
00:05:19,239 --> 00:05:22,440
that he asked Jesus, amen.

117
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,399
You know, what does he say?

118
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:27,279
You have not because you ask not.

119
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:28,920
Is that what the scriptures teach us?

120
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,720
The scriptures also teach us that you have not

121
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,320
because you ask amiss.

122
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,140
And so we understand those two principles,

123
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,880
but I want you to see here that this leper

124
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,799
had the courage and boldness to ask

125
00:05:39,799 --> 00:05:42,079
and Jesus says, I will be thou clean.

126
00:05:42,119 --> 00:05:47,119
And as soon, verse 42, as he had spoken immediately,

127
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:52,480
the leprosy departed from him and he was cleansed.

128
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:58,040
And we see here that Jesus walked compassionately.

129
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,260
We had visited this passage of scripture

130
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,839
a couple of weeks ago when we spoke about the fact

131
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:05,640
that Jesus walked purposefully,

132
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,799
that everything that Jesus did was with a purpose

133
00:06:08,799 --> 00:06:11,399
and on purpose and for a purpose.

134
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,519
And here as we continue through Mark chapter number one

135
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:18,559
and we come to this truth that he walked compassionately.

136
00:06:18,559 --> 00:06:20,480
I said this last Wednesday evening

137
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,720
that as we look at these various aspects

138
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,720
of how Christ walked, that what we have to understand

139
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,399
is that oftentimes they were all intertwined

140
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:30,559
one with the other.

141
00:06:30,559 --> 00:06:33,320
He walked purposefully, he walked courageously,

142
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,000
he walked compassionately.

143
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,019
Those are the last three that we've dealt with.

144
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:39,179
He walked in wisdom.

145
00:06:39,179 --> 00:06:41,059
We talked about the fact that he walked wisely.

146
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,559
He walked humbly.

147
00:06:42,559 --> 00:06:44,059
And so as we look at those things

148
00:06:44,059 --> 00:06:47,500
and we see how they're interconnected one with the other

149
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,899
and here because of a physical condition,

150
00:06:50,899 --> 00:06:53,640
Jesus is moved with compassion.

151
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,540
Notice, if you will, back in the gospel of Matthew

152
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:59,260
in Matthew chapter number nine.

153
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:02,019
And we find that the Bible would share with us

154
00:07:02,019 --> 00:07:03,540
a familiar passage of scripture,

155
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:08,079
one in which we're very familiar with in Matthew chapter nine

156
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:11,920
and it's a passage that we often reference

157
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,279
at least the latter part of verses 37 and 38

158
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:17,399
where Jesus gives the instruction

159
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:22,279
about the harvest being plenteous and the laborers are few.

160
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:25,119
But I want you to notice if you begin reading in Matthew nine

161
00:07:25,119 --> 00:07:28,040
in verse number 36, the Bible says,

162
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:32,200
but when he, speaking of Jesus, saw the multitudes.

163
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,480
Notice what the Bible says.

164
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:37,839
He was moved with compassion on them.

165
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,600
He was moved with compassion in Mark one.

166
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,600
And here in Matthew nine,

167
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,279
the Bible says that he saw the multitudes

168
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:48,160
and he was moved with compassion on them.

169
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,760
Notice why, because they fainted

170
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:55,579
and were scattered abroad as sheep having no shepherd.

171
00:07:55,579 --> 00:07:58,640
We find that Jesus then looks to his disciples

172
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,559
and he says to his disciples,

173
00:08:00,559 --> 00:08:04,200
the harvest truly is plenteous, but the laborers are few.

174
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,920
Pray therefore the Lord of the harvest

175
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:10,519
that he will send forth laborers into his harvest.

176
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:13,760
If it was true then, it is true now.

177
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,739
And we see it in such a great light this evening

178
00:08:17,739 --> 00:08:20,559
that indeed the harvest is plenteous,

179
00:08:20,559 --> 00:08:22,600
but the laborers are few.

180
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,440
And we're reminded of that regularly.

181
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,359
I was at a pastor's meeting,

182
00:08:27,359 --> 00:08:29,880
the monthly AIBF meeting that I attend.

183
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,880
And yesterday I was there

184
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:35,440
and heard more about churches without pastors

185
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,559
and that situation that's going on in mission fields

186
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,239
and missionaries coming home and so on and so forth.

187
00:08:41,239 --> 00:08:45,280
But I want you to notice that before we ever get that truth

188
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:49,159
that Jesus gives to the disciples in verse 37 and 38,

189
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:52,520
that we're told that Jesus, he saw the multitudes

190
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,000
and he was moved with compassion.

191
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,059
I would believe and I would say it this way,

192
00:08:57,059 --> 00:08:59,799
that in Mark chapter number one,

193
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:04,799
Jesus was moved with compassion over a physical need.

194
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,479
But here in Matthew chapter number nine,

195
00:09:07,479 --> 00:09:10,719
I believe that Jesus is moved with compassion

196
00:09:10,719 --> 00:09:12,520
over a spiritual need.

197
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,640
And we find that he says,

198
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,960
because they were as sheep scattered abroad

199
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,679
without a shepherd.

200
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:20,380
And we find that he then says

201
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,159
to pray to the Lord of the harvest

202
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:25,200
that he would send forth laborers into his harvest.

203
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,359
And so we'd see the spiritual aspect

204
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:31,500
of this particular text of scripture and the purpose.

205
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,719
There's many other examples that we could go to

206
00:09:35,539 --> 00:09:38,200
within the gospels in which Jesus moved with compassion

207
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,960
and we see the compassion of our God.

208
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,380
And we can rejoice that God tells us in his word

209
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,340
that he is compassionate.

210
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:49,099
And we see that declaration,

211
00:09:49,099 --> 00:09:52,320
but it's one thing to see and to hear where God says,

212
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,520
I am a compassionate God.

213
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:58,159
It's a whole nother thing to see him moved with compassion

214
00:09:58,159 --> 00:09:59,760
and to see how he

215
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,260
how that compassion is visible through his actions.

216
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:07,140
And so we find here in the text of scripture

217
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:11,380
that there's a spiritual situation, a spiritual need

218
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,660
that leads to the Lord Jesus Christ

219
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:16,700
being moved with compassion.

220
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,500
He knew their spiritual condition.

221
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,020
He was aware of their spiritual need

222
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:25,760
and he's moved with compassion.

223
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,740
Can I tell you this evening that both the physical

224
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,040
and the spiritual should have an influence

225
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,960
and an impact on us?

226
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:37,280
And it's amazing to me how easy it is

227
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:41,560
for people to be moved with compassion at physical needs

228
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,580
but not at spiritual needs.

229
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,120
And can I tell you this evening

230
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,520
that the greatest need of humanity is a spiritual need?

231
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:55,380
And I don't say that to minimize the physical needs

232
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,080
that individuals have.

233
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,900
I don't say that to minimize or to overlook

234
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:03,060
the fact that there are people that are hungry,

235
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,780
there are people that need clothing

236
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:07,060
and I understand that and so do you

237
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:10,020
but the reality is that you can feed someone,

238
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:13,740
you can clothe someone, you can teach someone,

239
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,660
you can give someone an education,

240
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,900
you can provide for them a job

241
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,980
and you can provide housing and so on and so forth

242
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:24,960
but if you never tell them about Jesus and about their soul

243
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,980
then what's gonna happen is they're gonna die

244
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,660
and then go to a Christless eternity

245
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:33,000
and all we've really done is made their life here

246
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,080
a little bit more comfortable.

247
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,400
Does that make sense tonight?

248
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,320
And I wanna say that with compassion

249
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,360
and I hope that it's being received

250
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,400
in the way that I'm seeking to communicate it this evening

251
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:48,080
because no doubt the physical need is real

252
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,680
and there are individuals with physical needs

253
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,120
but even as our missionaries and at times

254
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,680
as we've had opportunity to help in certain situations

255
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:00,780
with physical needs, our goal is not to stop

256
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:04,660
at the physical, our goal is also to try

257
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:07,020
to meet the spiritual need

258
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,780
because that's the greatest need

259
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,300
and so we find this evening

260
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,220
that Jesus, he walked compassionately.

261
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,820
So what's the, we see the truth,

262
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:20,720
we see the example in both of these passages of scripture

263
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,020
in Mark one and in Matthew nine

264
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,660
where he was moved with compassion

265
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:29,160
in Mark's gospel a physical condition or need,

266
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:33,000
in Matthew's gospel because of a spiritual condition or need

267
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,640
and so what is the instruction for us this evening?

268
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,680
Where is it that we find that we too are to walk

269
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,680
or to live with compassion?

270
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,560
Turn to the book of Luke if you will in the 10th chapter.

271
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,080
In Luke chapter number 10,

272
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:49,540
this too is a familiar passage of scripture

273
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:52,400
and I want you to see this truth

274
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,780
that is given to us this evening

275
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:57,740
in this portion of scripture with regard to us

276
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:01,140
and the need for us to be compassionate

277
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:03,940
with those that we come in contact with.

278
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,660
You're there in Luke chapter number 10,

279
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,340
the Bible says this beginning in verse number 30,

280
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,780
and Jesus answering said,

281
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:13,740
a certain man went down from Jerusalem.

282
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:17,340
He went from Jerusalem to Jericho and he fell among thieves

283
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,740
which stripped him of his raiment and wounded him

284
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:22,400
and departed leaving him half dead.

285
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,360
Can I pause just for a moment and let you know

286
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,160
that this did happen regularly.

287
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:30,640
This was a situation that Jesus is teaching

288
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,880
and it's something that they could identify with

289
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,400
and relate with that this was something

290
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,560
that took place on occasion.

291
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,440
And so we find that Jesus as he's answering

292
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,400
the one that says who is my neighbor

293
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,600
according to verse 29,

294
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,700
we find that Jesus gives him this scenario if you will,

295
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:53,580
and he says that this man, he was robbed,

296
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:57,260
he was left for dead, he was half dead, verse 31,

297
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:02,260
and by chance there came down a certain priest that way.

298
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,180
And so we find that the Bible says

299
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,360
that there's this certain priest that goes

300
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,560
and as he's journeying, Jesus as he's speaking to this man

301
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,800
and giving him the truth, he goes that way,

302
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,020
the way in which this man was left

303
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:18,940
and it says and when he saw him,

304
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:22,080
he passed by on the other side.

305
00:14:24,339 --> 00:14:25,860
That's interesting, is it not?

306
00:14:27,059 --> 00:14:29,339
The Bible clearly tells us that Jesus

307
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:33,339
in speaking to this man, he says he saw him.

308
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:34,980
You're in a situation where you try to act

309
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,860
like you didn't see something

310
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,300
because you don't want to be bothered by it,

311
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,820
you want to just be able to keep on going,

312
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,880
well, it says he saw him.

313
00:14:44,619 --> 00:14:46,779
And he passed by on the other side

314
00:14:46,779 --> 00:14:49,300
and likewise, so that was a priest in verse 32,

315
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:52,980
likewise a Levite, when he was at the place,

316
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:57,660
came and looked on him and passed by on the other side.

317
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:00,740
That's a step worse in my mind,

318
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:04,020
he didn't just see him as the priest did in verse 31,

319
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,700
but the Bible says that this Levite,

320
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:09,140
he comes at the same place and he looked on him.

321
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,540
There's a difference between seeing something

322
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:15,200
and looking at something, would you agree?

323
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,839
There's a difference between seeing something

324
00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:18,360
and looking at something.

325
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,440
And listen, there's some things you can't help seeing,

326
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,380
but you can choose what you look at, amen?

327
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:31,200
That's why Jesus in Hebrews, it says looking unto Jesus.

328
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,160
It's a decision, a choice that we make

329
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,000
on where we fix our gaze upon.

330
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,360
And here the Bible says that this Levite,

331
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:41,700
he came and he looked on him

332
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:44,700
and passed by on the other side.

333
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:50,059
Verse 33, but a certain Samaritan as he journeyed

334
00:15:50,059 --> 00:15:52,500
came where he was.

335
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,980
And when he saw him, notice what it says,

336
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:59,360
he had compassion on him.

337
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:04,580
Now, we understand and we don't have time this evening

338
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:07,300
to deal with all of the background

339
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:11,200
with regard to how the Jewish people viewed the Samaritans

340
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,320
and all that's taking place with regard to Jesus

341
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,240
talking about a priest and a Levite

342
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,160
and then a Samaritan in verse 33.

343
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,500
But we find that the Samaritan, it says of him

344
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,880
that he saw him and he had compassion on him.

345
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,880
And notice it says, and went to him and bound up his wounds,

346
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:33,480
pouring in oil and wine and set him on his own beast

347
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:37,980
and brought him to an inn and took care of him.

348
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:42,020
By the way, what you read in verse 34 and following

349
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:44,880
is what reveals the compassion.

350
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,339
We can say that we have compassion,

351
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:51,500
but it's seen in our actions.

352
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,619
Just as the case was with Jesus,

353
00:16:53,619 --> 00:16:56,100
he had compassion on the man, so what did he do?

354
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,940
He touched him and he healed him.

355
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:01,900
He had compassion on those that were scattered

356
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,960
without a shepherd, and so what does he say?

357
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,640
Pray to the Lord of the harvest, by the way, who is that?

358
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,660
It's Jesus, that he would send forth labors.

359
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,680
You know that that's a prayer that God answers.

360
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:16,279
God calls people and God sends people.

361
00:17:16,279 --> 00:17:18,720
And here we find that in verse number 35,

362
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,839
it continues and says, and on the morrow when he departed,

363
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,320
he took out two pence and gave them to the host

364
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:27,040
and said unto him, take care of him

365
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,760
and whatsoever thou spendest more when I come again,

366
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,220
I will repay thee.

367
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:36,240
Verse 36, Jesus says, which now of these three

368
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,440
thinkest thou was neighbor unto him

369
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,119
that fell among the thieves and he said,

370
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:43,680
he that showed mercy on him, then said Jesus unto him,

371
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:47,220
notice, go and do thou likewise.

372
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,339
I read an account years ago of a school of theology

373
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:56,600
where the students in a particular class

374
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,240
were tasked in this particular day

375
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:03,059
to come and to give a sermon.

376
00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:05,619
It was a short sermon that each of the individuals

377
00:18:05,619 --> 00:18:09,040
in the class were to give on this passage of scripture.

378
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,700
And the professor set a trap.

379
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,339
And here's what the professor did.

380
00:18:15,339 --> 00:18:18,040
The professor gave the assignment

381
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,619
that here's the text of scripture

382
00:18:19,619 --> 00:18:22,940
that you're gonna preach a little sermon on in class.

383
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:26,980
But what he did is he had something staged along the way

384
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,180
where there was a fellow student that was in need.

385
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,479
And everyone that was in that class

386
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:36,760
that was to preach on that particular text of scripture

387
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,400
passed right by their fellow student in need

388
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,160
so that they could get to class and preach a sermon

389
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,500
on the Good Samaritan.

390
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,320
Isn't that interesting?

391
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,119
The reality is that we find here in the text of scripture

392
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:55,200
that this illustration that Jesus gives

393
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,540
of the one, this Samaritan, that what did he do?

394
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,540
Well, because of his compassion,

395
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,700
because he saw someone in need,

396
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,020
and again, here in our text of scripture,

397
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,940
this is a physical need.

398
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,600
This is a physical need.

399
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,859
Well, the reality this evening

400
00:19:09,859 --> 00:19:13,380
is that we can't meet everyone's physical need.

401
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,859
You understand that?

402
00:19:14,859 --> 00:19:16,700
The physical needs of this world

403
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:20,220
far surpass our ability individually

404
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:24,020
or even collectively to be able to even begin to help.

405
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,380
It's amazing.

406
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:31,780
And we find that it requires much wisdom and discernment

407
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,780
with regard to several of those things,

408
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:36,340
and I don't wanna get into all of that this evening,

409
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,580
but if you have questions,

410
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:40,220
I'd be more than happy to discuss that with you

411
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:43,059
with regard to just having wisdom and discernment

412
00:19:43,059 --> 00:19:44,859
on where is it that I help?

413
00:19:44,859 --> 00:19:46,380
What is it that I help with?

414
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:51,380
And where's a need that I can try to help and satisfy?

415
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:56,799
But we find here that Jesus uses this account,

416
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,760
and he gives this parable, if you will.

417
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,400
with regard to this lawyer that was asking these questions,

418
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,100
and Jesus is painting this picture

419
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,340
and helping to illustrate, and then he says,

420
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:12,280
go and do thou likewise, in verse number 37.

421
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,300
And so we see here the instruction

422
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,920
with regard to our response

423
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:21,080
and being able to minister to individuals

424
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,820
and seeing a physical need

425
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:25,660
and where it is that God would allow us

426
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:29,680
to have opportunity to be able to help with those things,

427
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,780
by having compassion.

428
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:35,020
But now I want you to turn to the book of Jude, if you will.

429
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,660
Turn to the book of Jude,

430
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,220
and as you turn to the book of Jude,

431
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,560
it's only one chapter,

432
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:44,460
but what a power-packed chapter of God's word this is.

433
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:47,760
The book of Jude, just a, again, a very short letter,

434
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,800
25 verses in the book of Jude,

435
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:55,800
but you could spend just about a verse a week

436
00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:00,740
going through it and really getting what God has for us

437
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,960
throughout this text of scripture.

438
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,540
We find that as you begin looking through this short epistle

439
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:10,240
that there's an introduction that's given

440
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,740
with regard to the reason, really, for the writing,

441
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,580
and you see that in the very beginning

442
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:16,940
where it says in verse three

443
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,240
that it was needful for me,

444
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,680
right in the middle of the verse,

445
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,460
to write unto you and to exhort you

446
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,520
that you should earnestly contend for the faith

447
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:26,040
which was once delivered unto the saints.

448
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:26,880
Why?

449
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,280
Why is there this epistle, this short letter

450
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,760
that's being written to help these individuals

451
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,400
to earnestly contend for the faith?

452
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,080
Well, because in verse number four,

453
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,440
there are certain men crept in unawares

454
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,280
who were before of old ordained to this condemnation,

455
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,100
ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness

456
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,200
and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ,

457
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:54,760
and we find that then after the introduction is given

458
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,460
with regard to the reason for the writing

459
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:01,180
that the text begins to deal with

460
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:04,280
and exposing false teachers.

461
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:07,100
We find that as the text deals with the false teachers,

462
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,680
he uses examples from Old Testament,

463
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,840
he goes through and provides descriptions

464
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,880
and dealing with the judgments and so on and so forth,

465
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,680
and we see that really all the way to verse number 16,

466
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,920
and then you find that beginning in verse number 17,

467
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,200
it really changes a course, if you will,

468
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,920
the direction of the letter,

469
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:29,520
because in verse 17, it says, but beloved,

470
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,720
and so now after the instruction is given

471
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,360
with regard to the false teachers

472
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,720
that have crept in unawares and how they're operating

473
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,400
and all of those things,

474
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,520
the examples from the Old Testament

475
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,000
so that we could understand how they behave

476
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,680
and what their tactics are,

477
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,320
but also how God dealt with them,

478
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,160
we then find that he says, but beloved,

479
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:57,520
and so the letter is now going back to the believers

480
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,540
with regard to how they are to live

481
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,960
and really some instruction for us,

482
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,780
and I want you to notice that the Bible tells us

483
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:10,460
in verse 17, but beloved, remember ye the words

484
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:12,280
which were spoken before the apostles

485
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,120
of our Lord Jesus Christ,

486
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,480
how that they told you there should be mockers

487
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,520
in the last time who should walk

488
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,840
after their own ungodly lust.

489
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,840
Now isn't that interesting?

490
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,740
We've been studying in 2 Timothy chapter number three,

491
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:27,120
what does it begin with in verse number one?

492
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:31,080
This know also, and we dealt with that two weeks ago

493
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:34,820
on Sunday morning, and so hey, God has informed us,

494
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:37,720
he's let us know that there are going to be mockers.

495
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,600
Peter, in 2 Peter chapter three,

496
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,160
he talks about the scoffers and the mockers,

497
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,960
and so he says they're going to walk

498
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,120
after their own ungodly lust,

499
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,520
and so God has already told us that.

500
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,460
He says, remember that you've been told these things,

501
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:56,740
verse 19, these be they who separate themselves,

502
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:59,580
sensual, having not the spirit,

503
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:02,760
but again, notice he says, but ye, beloved,

504
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:06,560
building up yourselves on your most holy faith,

505
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:10,200
praying in the Holy Ghost, and so we find that again,

506
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,080
listen, this is going to happen.

507
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,000
We knew about these false teachers.

508
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,280
God informed us.

509
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:18,400
He let us know about this, but what do we do?

510
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,000
Do we just give up, give in, say, well, all hope is gone?

511
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,480
No, we build up ourselves.

512
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,040
Timothy says, continue.

513
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:29,040
That's what Paul says to Timothy in 2 Timothy three.

514
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,160
Listen, just because evil men and seducers

515
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,520
are going to wax worse and worse,

516
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,240
it doesn't mean you give up and give in.

517
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,279
It means you continue,

518
00:24:36,279 --> 00:24:41,180
and you stand in the face of the opposition.

519
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:44,660
Verse 21, keep yourselves in the love of God.

520
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:47,380
By the way, aren't you thankful that there's nothing

521
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:50,100
that can separate us from the love of God?

522
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,580
I mean, praise the Lord.

523
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:55,860
Jesus loves me, this I know, for the Bible tells me so,

524
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:58,260
and I know it's a little kid's Sunday school song,

525
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,860
but man, it's a precious song.

526
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:04,860
I love the song that we sing, Jesus Loves Even Me,

527
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:08,360
and many things in the Bible I read,

528
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,320
but this is the dearest,

529
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,460
that Jesus loves me, isn't that a wonderful song?

530
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,839
And praise the Lord for it,

531
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:18,760
and so here it says, keep yourselves in the love of God,

532
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,960
looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ

533
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,160
unto eternal life,

534
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,200
and then notice what the Bible says in verse 22,

535
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:31,200
and of some, have compassion making a difference.

536
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:38,040
Verse 23, and others, save with fear,

537
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,320
pulling them out of the fire,

538
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:44,320
hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.

539
00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:48,440
When I read verse 22 and 23, and of course we see,

540
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:51,440
and we've mentioned many times it's,

541
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,779
there's actually a song that we sang years ago

542
00:25:53,779 --> 00:25:56,320
from verse 22, called to make a difference,

543
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,920
and certainly we are called to make a difference,

544
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,119
and he says in verse 22, and of some,

545
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:04,680
have compassion making a difference.

546
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,540
Others, save with fear, pulling them out of the fire,

547
00:26:08,059 --> 00:26:10,380
hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.

548
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:12,880
You ever found if you, as you've tried,

549
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,380
and attempted to share the gospel with people,

550
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:18,100
that the same approach doesn't work with everyone?

551
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,460
The same approach doesn't work,

552
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:23,059
I don't mean the gospel doesn't work with everyone,

553
00:26:23,059 --> 00:26:26,360
obviously the gospel is the power of God unto salvation,

554
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,860
I'm not saying that we change our message,

555
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:30,420
I'm simply saying that our approach to them,

556
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:35,320
how we begin to communicate to them the truth of the gospel,

557
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:38,640
is going to vary based upon the individual.

558
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,360
And here the Bible says in verse 22,

559
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,920
and of some, have compassion.

560
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:48,980
You know, I find sometimes that maybe it's challenging

561
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:53,040
at times for us to have compassion on individuals,

562
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:57,720
because we really don't have the heart of Christ,

563
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,600
but we really look at them, I said this several weeks ago,

564
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,559
as being our enemies.

565
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:07,040
And I said this when I preached that text of scripture

566
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,040
on a Sunday morning, I said this,

567
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:13,880
that David never made Saul his enemy,

568
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:17,660
but Saul made David his enemy continually.

569
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,720
The Bible tells us in 1 Corinthians 2 and verse 14,

570
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,400
that the natural man receiveth not the things

571
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,820
of the Spirit of God, for there are foolishness unto him,

572
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:26,720
neither can he know them,

573
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,680
because they are spiritually discerned.

574
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,200
And sometimes what happens is because somebody

575
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,160
has a completely different worldview than we do,

576
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:38,880
they believe something entirely different than we do,

577
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,440
we look at them perhaps as being an enemy,

578
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,580
and we don't have compassion on them.

579
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,360
But the Bible says of some, have compassion,

580
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,020
making a difference.

581
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:56,040
It's amazing to me how blind, listen,

582
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,300
we understand 2 Corinthians 4, the God of this world,

583
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:01,119
that's a little g, God of this world, that's Satan,

584
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:04,800
hath blinded the minds of them which believe not,

585
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,080
lest the light of the glorious gospel

586
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,900
should shine in unto them.

587
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,140
When we approach people and begin to talk to them

588
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:14,520
about the Lord Jesus Christ, we must not approach them

589
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:18,480
and take this approach that I'm better than you.

590
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,360
No, we need to be compassionate,

591
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,559
because we understand their condition,

592
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,000
we understand they've been blinded,

593
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,480
we understand there's a spiritual battle

594
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:32,119
that's taking place for the soul of that individual,

595
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:35,119
and the enemy has done everything possible

596
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:38,919
to be able to keep them blinded to the truth of the gospel,

597
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:41,540
and then we come along and we have an opportunity

598
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,160
through whatever means it is,

599
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:46,040
whether it's just door knocking in a complete stranger,

600
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,479
or it's a neighbor, or it's a coworker,

601
00:28:48,479 --> 00:28:50,640
or maybe even a family member,

602
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,200
but we show them the love of Christ.

603
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,840
We have compassion, why?

604
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,840
Because we understand what happens to that individual

605
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,400
if they die without Christ.

606
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,479
We've read the entirety of the Bible,

607
00:29:06,479 --> 00:29:08,799
we've read Revelation chapter 20,

608
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,479
we're familiar with the judgment,

609
00:29:10,479 --> 00:29:11,880
the great white throne judgment,

610
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,359
and we know that, and therefore,

611
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:16,979
we ought to have some compassion.

612
00:29:20,479 --> 00:29:22,880
I said this before years ago,

613
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,500
and I believe that it's something that you've heard

614
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:29,380
from other sources as well, even within other contexts,

615
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:32,179
but the reality is that people in general

616
00:29:32,179 --> 00:29:33,820
don't really care how much you know

617
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:35,580
until they know how much you care.

618
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,059
And I find that to be a biblical philosophy,

619
00:29:40,059 --> 00:29:43,619
though you won't find those exact words in the scriptures,

620
00:29:43,619 --> 00:29:45,900
you will find that the Apostle Paul,

621
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:48,979
as he went to minister in the city of Thessalonica,

622
00:29:48,979 --> 00:29:51,059
as you read the book of 1 Thessalonians,

623
00:29:51,059 --> 00:29:53,859
you find that the Apostle Paul was a man

624
00:29:53,859 --> 00:29:57,460
that moved and worked with compassion.

625
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,100
He was a man that the Bible tells us,

626
00:29:59,100 --> 00:29:59,940
in fact, turn over.

627
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:04,900
and just look at it, in 1 Thessalonians chapter number one and two, notice what the Bible tells

628
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:10,740
us about Paul's ministry there in Thessalonica, because I believe it's important for us to

629
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:19,860
understand of some have compassion making a difference. We ought to love people,

630
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:25,060
to understand, listen, remember what's the compassion? Painful sympathy,

631
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:33,380
a mixed passion compounded of love and sorrow. I remember Chris asking me years ago,

632
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:40,260
why do you care about me? Why do you care so much? It's because you're going to die one day,

633
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:45,380
and I know what the Bible teaches, and if you die without Christ, you're going to spend

634
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:51,620
eternity in the lake of fire. We ought to be compassionate about that. The Bible says in

635
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:58,260
the book of 1 Thessalonians, notice in chapter number one, the Bible says in verse number four,

636
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:09,139
knowing, brethren, beloved, your election of God, for our gospel came not unto you in word only,

637
00:31:09,139 --> 00:31:12,900
but also in power to the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance, as you know,

638
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:19,620
what manner of men we were among you, notice, for your sake. And so we find that in verse number

639
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:25,139
five, Paul talks about the gospel coming to them. It came in word and in power of the Holy Ghost,

640
00:31:25,139 --> 00:31:32,100
with much assurance, but also notice he says, and what, and you know, what manner of men we were

641
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:38,500
among you, for your sake. And so Paul gives us some insight in verse number five, as to the

642
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:43,860
approach of ministry there in the city of Thessalonica. You could go back to Acts 17,

643
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:48,420
and you can read it during the second missionary journey, and you find there's not much given to

644
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:52,740
us there, because they're just there for about three Sabbaths, is what the Bible says. And so we

645
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:58,580
find that they got saved. The Bible says in verse number six, and you became followers of us, and of

646
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:04,980
the Lord, having received the word, and much affliction with joy of the Holy Ghost. And these

647
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:09,699
people got saved. And so why did they get saved? Well, just because they were kind men that came

648
00:32:09,699 --> 00:32:16,500
to the city of Thessalonica? No. Showing up as a kind person, and bringing some bread with you,

649
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:24,500
and some, that's not going to save anybody. Amen? We see the manner that they came, according to

650
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:30,339
verse number five, but they came with the gospel. Now, if they come with the gospel, and they come

651
00:32:30,339 --> 00:32:35,460
with a terrible attitude, and they come condemning, and all kinds of, are the people going to listen?

652
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:40,580
Are they going to be receptive? Do you understand? Can you, are you following tonight? And so we find

653
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:45,699
that the Bible says that they became followers of us, and of the Lord. They received the word,

654
00:32:45,699 --> 00:32:51,619
and much affliction with joy of the Holy Ghost. Notice in chapter number two, the Bible says this,

655
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:58,339
in verse number two, it says, but even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully

656
00:32:58,339 --> 00:33:04,500
entreated, as you know at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God

657
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:10,180
with much contention. For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile,

658
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:14,419
but as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak,

659
00:33:14,419 --> 00:33:20,260
not as pleasing men, but God which trieth the hearts, and so we trieth our hearts. So we understand

660
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:24,740
that even though they came in with a certain manner in verse number five of chapter one, and

661
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:29,220
we're going to get there in just a couple of more verses to really give you the full picture of what

662
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:35,860
this manner or behavior was in which they entered into the city, they came not just as nice people

663
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:41,619
bringing some, they came bringing the gospel, but their manner was appropriate, their position

664
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:45,940
and disposition. Could I use those two words tonight? We could track and follow that.

665
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:52,180
Listen, the position is important, Jesus alone, grace alone. Amen? Is that what the Bible teaches?

666
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:56,979
Jesus said, I am the way, the truth, and the life. No man cometh unto the Father but by me.

667
00:33:57,619 --> 00:34:01,699
But what's our disposition is we have the right position, we need to have the right

668
00:34:01,699 --> 00:34:07,059
disposition having that manner. And so Paul says, as we were allowed of God,

669
00:34:07,059 --> 00:34:11,619
notice what he says in verse four of chapter two, to be put in trust with the gospel,

670
00:34:11,619 --> 00:34:18,420
even so we speak. So he didn't change the message in order to be liked. Are you tracking?

671
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:27,619
Notice he says in verse number four, not as pleasing men, but God which trieth our hearts.

672
00:34:27,619 --> 00:34:33,700
So Paul says, we want to have the right disposition, but we can't sacrifice our position

673
00:34:34,339 --> 00:34:40,019
for our disposition. All right? So we have to speak the truth. We understand that we have to

674
00:34:40,019 --> 00:34:44,739
please God. We're not just trying to please men. You know what happens when you try to please men?

675
00:34:44,739 --> 00:34:49,380
Number one, you go insane because you can't do it. But number two, you start watering things down.

676
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:54,899
Because you know what we find in second Timothy chapter number four, the time will come when they

677
00:34:54,899 --> 00:35:01,220
will not endure, what does it say? Sound doctrine. Amen? And so we have to be careful. So Paul says

678
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:05,220
this is what we do. But notice as we continue in verse five, he says, for neither at any time

679
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:11,459
used be flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloak of covetousness. God is witness. Nor of men

680
00:35:11,459 --> 00:35:17,299
sought we glory, neither of you nor yet of others, when we might have been burdensome as apostles of

681
00:35:17,299 --> 00:35:22,739
Christ. And here it is. Here's the manner that he speaks of in chapter one in verse number five.

682
00:35:22,739 --> 00:35:33,860
But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children. So being affectionately

683
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:41,140
desirous, notice what it says, of you. We were willing to have imparted unto you, not the gospel

684
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:50,899
of God only, but also our own souls. Why? Because ye were dear unto us. That portion of scripture

685
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:57,220
is so impactful to me because it helps us understand a proper philosophy of ministry.

686
00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:01,059
We've got to have the right position, but we also have to have the right disposition.

687
00:36:02,019 --> 00:36:07,140
And we have to understand that compassion goes a long way. You know when somebody knows that

688
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:12,339
you love them and you care about them, like you truly care about their soul.

689
00:36:14,899 --> 00:36:19,380
It makes a difference on how they listen to your message. It makes a difference.

690
00:36:20,899 --> 00:36:25,619
Because they can see a genuine concern and a care and a compassion. And I believe that the

691
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:32,580
apostle Paul, I believe that he ministered with compassion. I don't believe that any of those that

692
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:38,019
he ministered to could honestly say, I know that people accused him in the attacks and so on and

693
00:36:38,019 --> 00:36:43,619
so forth that came, but I don't think they could accuse him and it be just an accusation that he

694
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:50,339
didn't care about people. He cared about them. He cared about them. And this evening, our Lord and

695
00:36:50,339 --> 00:36:55,540
Savior, he walked compassionately. By the way, I'm thankful for his compassion that he had on me.

696
00:36:56,660 --> 00:37:03,459
Amen? And God has called us to walk as Christ walked, and we see all of these things on how

697
00:37:03,459 --> 00:37:09,540
he walked, but we see tonight that he walked compassionately. So as I examine my life, as you

698
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:15,299
examine your life, we must ask ourselves this question, am I walking with compassion?

699
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:23,700
Is it obvious to others when I come in contact with them that I really, truly care? Or do we see

700
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:31,540
people as problems in my way? Do we have a situation like the disciples, hey Lord, they're

701
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:36,980
hungry and the day is far spent, send them home. Because we don't want to be bothered with it.

702
00:37:37,779 --> 00:37:43,860
But what does Jesus say? Give them something to eat. Right? Give them something to eat.

703
00:37:44,899 --> 00:37:54,260
And this evening, we cannot walk compassionately without walking in the Spirit.

704
00:37:56,500 --> 00:38:03,940
We cannot show the love of Christ without walking in the Spirit. We absolutely must abide in him.

705
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:10,980
Remember, it starts in 1 John 2 and verse 6, he that saith he abideth in him. The gospel of John,

706
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:17,700
15th chapter, we're to abide in him. And as we're walking with him and we're walking in the Spirit,

707
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:24,739
God enables us to have and to walk with compassion. Let's pray tonight. Father, we love you.

708
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:29,860
We thank you for loving us. Thank you for your Word, the truth contained therein. I pray that

709
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:36,340
you'd help us tonight. Lord, as we see the example of our Lord and Savior, I pray that you'd help us

710
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:42,340
also to receive the instruction for us to be compassionate, Lord, of some have compassion

711
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:50,179
making a difference. And God, help us to never sacrifice our position simply for sake of a

712
00:38:50,739 --> 00:38:59,619
disposition. But God, I pray that our disposition would align properly even as we see there

713
00:38:59,619 --> 00:39:06,260
in 1 Thessalonians. Help us, Lord, to walk with compassion. Thank you for the privilege of prayer.

714
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:10,900
I pray that you'd bless our time for it's in Christ's name we pray. Amen.
