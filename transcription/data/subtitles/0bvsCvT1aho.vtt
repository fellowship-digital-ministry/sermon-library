00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.599
1 John chapter number two and verse number six.

00:00:03.599 --> 00:00:06.559
And we, of course, this Wednesday is actually

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:09.319
our fourth week dealing with this thought

00:00:09.319 --> 00:00:11.859
from 1 John chapter two and verse number six.

00:00:11.859 --> 00:00:14.800
And we've been dealing for a number of months now

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.239
here on Wednesday evenings with this series

00:00:17.239 --> 00:00:20.020
doing what we ought to do.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.799
And a few weeks ago, as we started looking

00:00:22.799 --> 00:00:26.200
at 1 John chapter number six, we said this,

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.040
that we ought to walk as Christ walked.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.440
And we gather that from this verse of scripture

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.759
in 1 John two and verse six.

00:00:33.759 --> 00:00:37.279
The Bible says, he that saith he abideth in him,

00:00:37.279 --> 00:00:42.279
notice, ought himself also so to walk even as he walked.

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:48.119
And of course, as we've gone through these last few weeks,

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:52.000
we said that Jesus walked wisely, he walked humbly,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.680
he walked purposefully.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.380
And last week we dealt with the subject

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.360
that he walked courageously.

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:00.319
And I'm thankful for the opportunity

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:02.400
that we have to study the New Testament

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.080
and specifically with regard to this thought

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.160
as dealing with walking as Christ walked,

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.919
that we have the gospel records

00:01:09.919 --> 00:01:11.580
that have been provided for us

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.599
so that we can see how Christ lived his life,

00:01:15.599 --> 00:01:18.580
how he walked, how he left us an example

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.040
that we should follow his steps.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.559
And so this evening, it's the fifth point

00:01:23.559 --> 00:01:25.080
in this little mini series,

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.319
but it's the only one that we'll look at tonight.

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:29.680
I want you to consider this truth,

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.440
Jesus walked compassionately.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.239
He walked compassionately.

00:01:34.239 --> 00:01:36.440
And go back to the book of Mark, if you will,

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.279
we're gonna look at two passages of scripture

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:41.400
in the gospels to prove the point

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.279
that our Lord walked with compassion

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:46.559
and dealing with that subject

00:01:46.559 --> 00:01:49.319
and then what it means for us, for you and for me

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:51.959
to also walk with compassion.

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:56.040
How is it that we can walk with compassion as Christ did?

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.199
What does that look like?

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.879
What does it mean?

00:01:58.879 --> 00:02:00.879
And so notice, if you will,

00:02:00.879 --> 00:02:02.680
there in Mark chapter number one,

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.459
pick it up with me in verse number 40.

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:06.519
The Bible says this,

00:02:06.519 --> 00:02:09.360
and there came a leper to him,

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.740
beseeching him and kneeling down to him

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.440
and saying unto him,

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.440
if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:22.339
I want you to notice several things about this leper.

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:25.639
We're gonna look at verse 41 and 42 in just a moment

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:29.279
as we deal with how Christ walked compassionately.

00:02:29.279 --> 00:02:32.000
But I want you to notice just a few things about this leper

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.399
as the Bible tells us in verse number 40

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:35.679
that there was this leper.

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:39.720
And of course, we understand the difficulty with leprosy

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.520
and the problem during,

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.160
especially in this particular time and what's going on.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.880
The Bible says that he came to Jesus,

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.800
notice, beseeching him, begging,

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.960
and kneeling down to him.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.919
And then notice what he says at the end of verse number 40.

00:02:55.919 --> 00:03:00.919
He says, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:05.360
And I love the way that this leper approaches

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.619
the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:09.559
because he obviously understood something

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:11.960
about the power of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.800
He understood that Christ had the power to heal him.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.160
That's pretty amazing.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.360
And you see the faith of the individual coming and asking,

00:03:22.399 --> 00:03:25.119
he's not gonna ask if he doesn't think it's possible.

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:26.720
And he says that he knew this,

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.759
he had this understanding, if thou wilt.

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:31.720
Now, listen, we have to recognize

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.960
it's gotta be within God's will.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:34.800
Amen.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.800
And God can do anything.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.160
And there are times in which,

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.440
and we find the scripture say

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.199
that we're to pray according to his will.

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:45.279
And we understand that principle.

00:03:45.279 --> 00:03:47.960
And here this leper says, if thou wilt,

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.080
thou canst make me clean.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.919
And notice what Jesus in the response in verse 41,

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:57.199
the Bible says in Jesus, notice this,

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:59.979
moved with compassion.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.720
He put forth his hand and touched him

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.720
and saith unto him, I will, be thou clean.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.839
I want you to notice where the Bible says

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:14.259
that he was moved with compassion.

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:16.600
We find that that word compassion,

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.200
that emotion, if you will,

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.440
it carries with it the idea of painful sympathy.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.839
It's really a mixed passion

00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:27.200
compounded of both love and sorrow.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.679
And we come up with this truth of the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:04:31.679 --> 00:04:33.239
he's moved with compassion,

00:04:33.239 --> 00:04:36.720
he sees the condition of this individual.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.720
And here in Mark chapter number one,

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.799
we find that Jesus is moved with compassion

00:04:42.799 --> 00:04:45.359
because of a physical need,

00:04:45.359 --> 00:04:47.320
because of a physical ailment,

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.880
because of something that was wrong

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.000
with this man physically, he was a leper.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.959
And this was a serious condition, a serious situation.

00:04:55.959 --> 00:05:00.399
And the Bible says that Jesus is moved with compassion.

00:05:00.399 --> 00:05:03.320
He puts forth his hand and he simply says this

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.679
after he touches him, by the way,

00:05:05.679 --> 00:05:07.640
that's amazing in of itself

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.679
because you wouldn't touch a leper.

00:05:09.679 --> 00:05:14.679
And he touched him and he said, I will, be thou clean.

00:05:15.679 --> 00:05:19.239
Now, I believe that the leper probably was pretty thankful

00:05:19.239 --> 00:05:22.440
that he asked Jesus, amen.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.399
You know, what does he say?

00:05:23.399 --> 00:05:27.279
You have not because you ask not.

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:28.920
Is that what the scriptures teach us?

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.720
The scriptures also teach us that you have not

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.320
because you ask amiss.

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.140
And so we understand those two principles,

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.880
but I want you to see here that this leper

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.799
had the courage and boldness to ask

00:05:39.799 --> 00:05:42.079
and Jesus says, I will be thou clean.

00:05:42.119 --> 00:05:47.119
And as soon, verse 42, as he had spoken immediately,

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:52.480
the leprosy departed from him and he was cleansed.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:58.040
And we see here that Jesus walked compassionately.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.260
We had visited this passage of scripture

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.839
a couple of weeks ago when we spoke about the fact

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:05.640
that Jesus walked purposefully,

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.799
that everything that Jesus did was with a purpose

00:06:08.799 --> 00:06:11.399
and on purpose and for a purpose.

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:14.519
And here as we continue through Mark chapter number one

00:06:14.519 --> 00:06:18.559
and we come to this truth that he walked compassionately.

00:06:18.559 --> 00:06:20.480
I said this last Wednesday evening

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.720
that as we look at these various aspects

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.720
of how Christ walked, that what we have to understand

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.399
is that oftentimes they were all intertwined

00:06:29.399 --> 00:06:30.559
one with the other.

00:06:30.559 --> 00:06:33.320
He walked purposefully, he walked courageously,

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.000
he walked compassionately.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.019
Those are the last three that we've dealt with.

00:06:37.019 --> 00:06:39.179
He walked in wisdom.

00:06:39.179 --> 00:06:41.059
We talked about the fact that he walked wisely.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:42.559
He walked humbly.

00:06:42.559 --> 00:06:44.059
And so as we look at those things

00:06:44.059 --> 00:06:47.500
and we see how they're interconnected one with the other

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.899
and here because of a physical condition,

00:06:50.899 --> 00:06:53.640
Jesus is moved with compassion.

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:56.540
Notice, if you will, back in the gospel of Matthew

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:59.260
in Matthew chapter number nine.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.019
And we find that the Bible would share with us

00:07:02.019 --> 00:07:03.540
a familiar passage of scripture,

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:08.079
one in which we're very familiar with in Matthew chapter nine

00:07:08.079 --> 00:07:11.920
and it's a passage that we often reference

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:15.279
at least the latter part of verses 37 and 38

00:07:15.279 --> 00:07:17.399
where Jesus gives the instruction

00:07:17.399 --> 00:07:22.279
about the harvest being plenteous and the laborers are few.

00:07:22.279 --> 00:07:25.119
But I want you to notice if you begin reading in Matthew nine

00:07:25.119 --> 00:07:28.040
in verse number 36, the Bible says,

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:32.200
but when he, speaking of Jesus, saw the multitudes.

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:33.480
Notice what the Bible says.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:37.839
He was moved with compassion on them.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.600
He was moved with compassion in Mark one.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.600
And here in Matthew nine,

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.279
the Bible says that he saw the multitudes

00:07:46.279 --> 00:07:48.160
and he was moved with compassion on them.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.760
Notice why, because they fainted

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:55.579
and were scattered abroad as sheep having no shepherd.

00:07:55.579 --> 00:07:58.640
We find that Jesus then looks to his disciples

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:00.559
and he says to his disciples,

00:08:00.559 --> 00:08:04.200
the harvest truly is plenteous, but the laborers are few.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.920
Pray therefore the Lord of the harvest

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:10.519
that he will send forth laborers into his harvest.

00:08:10.519 --> 00:08:13.760
If it was true then, it is true now.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:17.739
And we see it in such a great light this evening

00:08:17.739 --> 00:08:20.559
that indeed the harvest is plenteous,

00:08:20.559 --> 00:08:22.600
but the laborers are few.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.440
And we're reminded of that regularly.

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.359
I was at a pastor's meeting,

00:08:27.359 --> 00:08:29.880
the monthly AIBF meeting that I attend.

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:31.880
And yesterday I was there

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:35.440
and heard more about churches without pastors

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:38.559
and that situation that's going on in mission fields

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:41.239
and missionaries coming home and so on and so forth.

00:08:41.239 --> 00:08:45.280
But I want you to notice that before we ever get that truth

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:49.159
that Jesus gives to the disciples in verse 37 and 38,

00:08:49.159 --> 00:08:52.520
that we're told that Jesus, he saw the multitudes

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.000
and he was moved with compassion.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.059
I would believe and I would say it this way,

00:08:57.059 --> 00:08:59.799
that in Mark chapter number one,

00:08:59.799 --> 00:09:04.799
Jesus was moved with compassion over a physical need.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.479
But here in Matthew chapter number nine,

00:09:07.479 --> 00:09:10.719
I believe that Jesus is moved with compassion

00:09:10.719 --> 00:09:12.520
over a spiritual need.

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:14.640
And we find that he says,

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:16.960
because they were as sheep scattered abroad

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.679
without a shepherd.

00:09:18.679 --> 00:09:20.380
And we find that he then says

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:22.159
to pray to the Lord of the harvest

00:09:22.159 --> 00:09:25.200
that he would send forth laborers into his harvest.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.359
And so we'd see the spiritual aspect

00:09:28.359 --> 00:09:31.500
of this particular text of scripture and the purpose.

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:34.719
There's many other examples that we could go to

00:09:35.539 --> 00:09:38.200
within the gospels in which Jesus moved with compassion

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.960
and we see the compassion of our God.

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:44.380
And we can rejoice that God tells us in his word

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:46.340
that he is compassionate.

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:49.099
And we see that declaration,

00:09:49.099 --> 00:09:52.320
but it's one thing to see and to hear where God says,

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.520
I am a compassionate God.

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:58.159
It's a whole nother thing to see him moved with compassion

00:09:58.159 --> 00:09:59.760
and to see how he

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:04.260
how that compassion is visible through his actions.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.140
And so we find here in the text of scripture

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:11.380
that there's a spiritual situation, a spiritual need

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:13.660
that leads to the Lord Jesus Christ

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:16.700
being moved with compassion.

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:19.500
He knew their spiritual condition.

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:23.020
He was aware of their spiritual need

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:25.760
and he's moved with compassion.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.740
Can I tell you this evening that both the physical

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:31.040
and the spiritual should have an influence

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.960
and an impact on us?

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:37.280
And it's amazing to me how easy it is

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:41.560
for people to be moved with compassion at physical needs

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:44.580
but not at spiritual needs.

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:47.120
And can I tell you this evening

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:51.520
that the greatest need of humanity is a spiritual need?

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:55.380
And I don't say that to minimize the physical needs

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:57.080
that individuals have.

00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:59.900
I don't say that to minimize or to overlook

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:03.060
the fact that there are people that are hungry,

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:04.780
there are people that need clothing

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:07.060
and I understand that and so do you

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:10.020
but the reality is that you can feed someone,

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:13.740
you can clothe someone, you can teach someone,

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:15.660
you can give someone an education,

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:17.900
you can provide for them a job

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:20.980
and you can provide housing and so on and so forth

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:24.960
but if you never tell them about Jesus and about their soul

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:26.980
then what's gonna happen is they're gonna die

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.660
and then go to a Christless eternity

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:33.000
and all we've really done is made their life here

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.080
a little bit more comfortable.

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:36.400
Does that make sense tonight?

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:39.320
And I wanna say that with compassion

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:41.360
and I hope that it's being received

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:44.400
in the way that I'm seeking to communicate it this evening

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:48.080
because no doubt the physical need is real

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.680
and there are individuals with physical needs

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:53.120
but even as our missionaries and at times

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:56.680
as we've had opportunity to help in certain situations

00:11:57.380 --> 00:12:00.780
with physical needs, our goal is not to stop

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:04.660
at the physical, our goal is also to try

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:07.020
to meet the spiritual need

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:08.780
because that's the greatest need

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:11.300
and so we find this evening

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:14.220
that Jesus, he walked compassionately.

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:16.820
So what's the, we see the truth,

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:20.720
we see the example in both of these passages of scripture

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:23.020
in Mark one and in Matthew nine

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:24.660
where he was moved with compassion

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:29.160
in Mark's gospel a physical condition or need,

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:33.000
in Matthew's gospel because of a spiritual condition or need

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.640
and so what is the instruction for us this evening?

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:38.680
Where is it that we find that we too are to walk

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:40.680
or to live with compassion?

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:43.560
Turn to the book of Luke if you will in the 10th chapter.

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:46.080
In Luke chapter number 10,

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:49.540
this too is a familiar passage of scripture

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:52.400
and I want you to see this truth

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:54.780
that is given to us this evening

00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:57.740
in this portion of scripture with regard to us

00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:01.140
and the need for us to be compassionate

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:03.940
with those that we come in contact with.

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:06.660
You're there in Luke chapter number 10,

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:09.340
the Bible says this beginning in verse number 30,

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:10.780
and Jesus answering said,

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:13.740
a certain man went down from Jerusalem.

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:17.340
He went from Jerusalem to Jericho and he fell among thieves

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:19.740
which stripped him of his raiment and wounded him

00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:22.400
and departed leaving him half dead.

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:24.360
Can I pause just for a moment and let you know

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:27.160
that this did happen regularly.

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:30.640
This was a situation that Jesus is teaching

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:33.880
and it's something that they could identify with

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:36.400
and relate with that this was something

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:38.560
that took place on occasion.

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:41.440
And so we find that Jesus as he's answering

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:43.400
the one that says who is my neighbor

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:45.600
according to verse 29,

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:49.700
we find that Jesus gives him this scenario if you will,

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:53.580
and he says that this man, he was robbed,

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:57.260
he was left for dead, he was half dead, verse 31,

00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:02.260
and by chance there came down a certain priest that way.

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:06.180
And so we find that the Bible says

00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:08.360
that there's this certain priest that goes

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:11.560
and as he's journeying, Jesus as he's speaking to this man

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:13.800
and giving him the truth, he goes that way,

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:16.020
the way in which this man was left

00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:18.940
and it says and when he saw him,

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:22.080
he passed by on the other side.

00:14:24.339 --> 00:14:25.860
That's interesting, is it not?

00:14:27.059 --> 00:14:29.339
The Bible clearly tells us that Jesus

00:14:29.339 --> 00:14:33.339
in speaking to this man, he says he saw him.

00:14:33.339 --> 00:14:34.980
You're in a situation where you try to act

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:36.860
like you didn't see something

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:38.300
because you don't want to be bothered by it,

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:39.820
you want to just be able to keep on going,

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:41.880
well, it says he saw him.

00:14:44.619 --> 00:14:46.779
And he passed by on the other side

00:14:46.779 --> 00:14:49.300
and likewise, so that was a priest in verse 32,

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:52.980
likewise a Levite, when he was at the place,

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:57.660
came and looked on him and passed by on the other side.

00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:00.740
That's a step worse in my mind,

00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:04.020
he didn't just see him as the priest did in verse 31,

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:05.700
but the Bible says that this Levite,

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:09.140
he comes at the same place and he looked on him.

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:12.540
There's a difference between seeing something

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:15.200
and looking at something, would you agree?

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:16.839
There's a difference between seeing something

00:15:16.839 --> 00:15:18.360
and looking at something.

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:22.440
And listen, there's some things you can't help seeing,

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:26.380
but you can choose what you look at, amen?

00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:31.200
That's why Jesus in Hebrews, it says looking unto Jesus.

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.160
It's a decision, a choice that we make

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:36.000
on where we fix our gaze upon.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.360
And here the Bible says that this Levite,

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:41.700
he came and he looked on him

00:15:42.779 --> 00:15:44.700
and passed by on the other side.

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:50.059
Verse 33, but a certain Samaritan as he journeyed

00:15:50.059 --> 00:15:52.500
came where he was.

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:55.980
And when he saw him, notice what it says,

00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:59.360
he had compassion on him.

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:04.580
Now, we understand and we don't have time this evening

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:07.300
to deal with all of the background

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:11.200
with regard to how the Jewish people viewed the Samaritans

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:14.320
and all that's taking place with regard to Jesus

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:16.240
talking about a priest and a Levite

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:19.160
and then a Samaritan in verse 33.

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.500
But we find that the Samaritan, it says of him

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:24.880
that he saw him and he had compassion on him.

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:29.880
And notice it says, and went to him and bound up his wounds,

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:33.480
pouring in oil and wine and set him on his own beast

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:37.980
and brought him to an inn and took care of him.

00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:42.020
By the way, what you read in verse 34 and following

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:44.880
is what reveals the compassion.

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:47.339
We can say that we have compassion,

00:16:47.339 --> 00:16:51.500
but it's seen in our actions.

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:53.619
Just as the case was with Jesus,

00:16:53.619 --> 00:16:56.100
he had compassion on the man, so what did he do?

00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:58.940
He touched him and he healed him.

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:01.900
He had compassion on those that were scattered

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:03.960
without a shepherd, and so what does he say?

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:06.640
Pray to the Lord of the harvest, by the way, who is that?

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:09.660
It's Jesus, that he would send forth labors.

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:12.680
You know that that's a prayer that God answers.

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:16.279
God calls people and God sends people.

00:17:16.279 --> 00:17:18.720
And here we find that in verse number 35,

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:21.839
it continues and says, and on the morrow when he departed,

00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:24.320
he took out two pence and gave them to the host

00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:27.040
and said unto him, take care of him

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:29.760
and whatsoever thou spendest more when I come again,

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:31.220
I will repay thee.

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:36.240
Verse 36, Jesus says, which now of these three

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:38.440
thinkest thou was neighbor unto him

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:40.119
that fell among the thieves and he said,

00:17:40.119 --> 00:17:43.680
he that showed mercy on him, then said Jesus unto him,

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:47.220
notice, go and do thou likewise.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.339
I read an account years ago of a school of theology

00:17:53.339 --> 00:17:56.600
where the students in a particular class

00:17:56.600 --> 00:18:00.240
were tasked in this particular day

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:03.059
to come and to give a sermon.

00:18:03.059 --> 00:18:05.619
It was a short sermon that each of the individuals

00:18:05.619 --> 00:18:09.040
in the class were to give on this passage of scripture.

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:12.700
And the professor set a trap.

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:15.339
And here's what the professor did.

00:18:15.339 --> 00:18:18.040
The professor gave the assignment

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:19.619
that here's the text of scripture

00:18:19.619 --> 00:18:22.940
that you're gonna preach a little sermon on in class.

00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:26.980
But what he did is he had something staged along the way

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.180
where there was a fellow student that was in need.

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:33.479
And everyone that was in that class

00:18:33.479 --> 00:18:36.760
that was to preach on that particular text of scripture

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:39.400
passed right by their fellow student in need

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:42.160
so that they could get to class and preach a sermon

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:43.500
on the Good Samaritan.

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:46.320
Isn't that interesting?

00:18:47.919 --> 00:18:51.119
The reality is that we find here in the text of scripture

00:18:51.119 --> 00:18:55.200
that this illustration that Jesus gives

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:58.540
of the one, this Samaritan, that what did he do?

00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:00.540
Well, because of his compassion,

00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:02.700
because he saw someone in need,

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:05.020
and again, here in our text of scripture,

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:06.940
this is a physical need.

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:08.600
This is a physical need.

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:09.859
Well, the reality this evening

00:19:09.859 --> 00:19:13.380
is that we can't meet everyone's physical need.

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:14.859
You understand that?

00:19:14.859 --> 00:19:16.700
The physical needs of this world

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:20.220
far surpass our ability individually

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:24.020
or even collectively to be able to even begin to help.

00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:26.380
It's amazing.

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:31.780
And we find that it requires much wisdom and discernment

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:33.780
with regard to several of those things,

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:36.340
and I don't wanna get into all of that this evening,

00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:37.580
but if you have questions,

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:40.220
I'd be more than happy to discuss that with you

00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:43.059
with regard to just having wisdom and discernment

00:19:43.059 --> 00:19:44.859
on where is it that I help?

00:19:44.859 --> 00:19:46.380
What is it that I help with?

00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:51.380
And where's a need that I can try to help and satisfy?

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:56.799
But we find here that Jesus uses this account,

00:19:56.799 --> 00:19:59.760
and he gives this parable, if you will.

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:03.400
with regard to this lawyer that was asking these questions,

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:06.100
and Jesus is painting this picture

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:08.340
and helping to illustrate, and then he says,

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:12.280
go and do thou likewise, in verse number 37.

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:15.300
And so we see here the instruction

00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:17.920
with regard to our response

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:21.080
and being able to minister to individuals

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:22.820
and seeing a physical need

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:25.660
and where it is that God would allow us

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:29.680
to have opportunity to be able to help with those things,

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:31.780
by having compassion.

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:35.020
But now I want you to turn to the book of Jude, if you will.

00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:36.660
Turn to the book of Jude,

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:38.220
and as you turn to the book of Jude,

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:39.560
it's only one chapter,

00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:44.460
but what a power-packed chapter of God's word this is.

00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:47.760
The book of Jude, just a, again, a very short letter,

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:50.800
25 verses in the book of Jude,

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:55.800
but you could spend just about a verse a week

00:20:56.120 --> 00:21:00.740
going through it and really getting what God has for us

00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:02.960
throughout this text of scripture.

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:07.540
We find that as you begin looking through this short epistle

00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:10.240
that there's an introduction that's given

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:13.740
with regard to the reason, really, for the writing,

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:15.580
and you see that in the very beginning

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:16.940
where it says in verse three

00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:18.240
that it was needful for me,

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:19.680
right in the middle of the verse,

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:21.460
to write unto you and to exhort you

00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:23.520
that you should earnestly contend for the faith

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:26.040
which was once delivered unto the saints.

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:26.880
Why?

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:30.280
Why is there this epistle, this short letter

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:33.760
that's being written to help these individuals

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:35.400
to earnestly contend for the faith?

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:37.080
Well, because in verse number four,

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:39.440
there are certain men crept in unawares

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:43.280
who were before of old ordained to this condemnation,

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:47.100
ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:50.200
and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ,

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:54.760
and we find that then after the introduction is given

00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:57.460
with regard to the reason for the writing

00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:01.180
that the text begins to deal with

00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:04.280
and exposing false teachers.

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:07.100
We find that as the text deals with the false teachers,

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:09.680
he uses examples from Old Testament,

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:11.840
he goes through and provides descriptions

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:14.880
and dealing with the judgments and so on and so forth,

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:18.680
and we see that really all the way to verse number 16,

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:21.920
and then you find that beginning in verse number 17,

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:24.200
it really changes a course, if you will,

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:25.920
the direction of the letter,

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:29.520
because in verse 17, it says, but beloved,

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:32.720
and so now after the instruction is given

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:34.360
with regard to the false teachers

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:37.720
that have crept in unawares and how they're operating

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:39.400
and all of those things,

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:41.520
the examples from the Old Testament

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:45.000
so that we could understand how they behave

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.680
and what their tactics are,

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:50.320
but also how God dealt with them,

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:53.160
we then find that he says, but beloved,

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:57.520
and so the letter is now going back to the believers

00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:00.540
with regard to how they are to live

00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:02.960
and really some instruction for us,

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:06.780
and I want you to notice that the Bible tells us

00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:10.460
in verse 17, but beloved, remember ye the words

00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:12.280
which were spoken before the apostles

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:14.120
of our Lord Jesus Christ,

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:16.480
how that they told you there should be mockers

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:18.520
in the last time who should walk

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:20.840
after their own ungodly lust.

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:21.840
Now isn't that interesting?

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:24.740
We've been studying in 2 Timothy chapter number three,

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:27.120
what does it begin with in verse number one?

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:31.080
This know also, and we dealt with that two weeks ago

00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:34.820
on Sunday morning, and so hey, God has informed us,

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:37.720
he's let us know that there are going to be mockers.

00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:39.600
Peter, in 2 Peter chapter three,

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:42.160
he talks about the scoffers and the mockers,

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:44.960
and so he says they're going to walk

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:47.120
after their own ungodly lust,

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:49.520
and so God has already told us that.

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:52.460
He says, remember that you've been told these things,

00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:56.740
verse 19, these be they who separate themselves,

00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:59.580
sensual, having not the spirit,

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:02.760
but again, notice he says, but ye, beloved,

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:06.560
building up yourselves on your most holy faith,

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:10.200
praying in the Holy Ghost, and so we find that again,

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:12.080
listen, this is going to happen.

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:14.000
We knew about these false teachers.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.280
God informed us.

00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:18.400
He let us know about this, but what do we do?

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:22.000
Do we just give up, give in, say, well, all hope is gone?

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.480
No, we build up ourselves.

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:26.040
Timothy says, continue.

00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:29.040
That's what Paul says to Timothy in 2 Timothy three.

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:31.160
Listen, just because evil men and seducers

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:32.520
are going to wax worse and worse,

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:34.240
it doesn't mean you give up and give in.

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:36.279
It means you continue,

00:24:36.279 --> 00:24:41.180
and you stand in the face of the opposition.

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:44.660
Verse 21, keep yourselves in the love of God.

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:47.380
By the way, aren't you thankful that there's nothing

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:50.100
that can separate us from the love of God?

00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:51.580
I mean, praise the Lord.

00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:55.860
Jesus loves me, this I know, for the Bible tells me so,

00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:58.260
and I know it's a little kid's Sunday school song,

00:24:58.260 --> 00:24:59.860
but man, it's a precious song.

00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:04.860
I love the song that we sing, Jesus Loves Even Me,

00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:08.360
and many things in the Bible I read,

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:10.320
but this is the dearest,

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:13.460
that Jesus loves me, isn't that a wonderful song?

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:14.839
And praise the Lord for it,

00:25:14.839 --> 00:25:18.760
and so here it says, keep yourselves in the love of God,

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:21.960
looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:23.160
unto eternal life,

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:26.200
and then notice what the Bible says in verse 22,

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:31.200
and of some, have compassion making a difference.

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:38.040
Verse 23, and others, save with fear,

00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:39.320
pulling them out of the fire,

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:44.320
hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.

00:25:44.839 --> 00:25:48.440
When I read verse 22 and 23, and of course we see,

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:51.440
and we've mentioned many times it's,

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:53.779
there's actually a song that we sang years ago

00:25:53.779 --> 00:25:56.320
from verse 22, called to make a difference,

00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:58.920
and certainly we are called to make a difference,

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:01.119
and he says in verse 22, and of some,

00:26:01.119 --> 00:26:04.680
have compassion making a difference.

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:07.540
Others, save with fear, pulling them out of the fire,

00:26:08.059 --> 00:26:10.380
hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.

00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:12.880
You ever found if you, as you've tried,

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:15.380
and attempted to share the gospel with people,

00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:18.100
that the same approach doesn't work with everyone?

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:20.460
The same approach doesn't work,

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:23.059
I don't mean the gospel doesn't work with everyone,

00:26:23.059 --> 00:26:26.360
obviously the gospel is the power of God unto salvation,

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:27.860
I'm not saying that we change our message,

00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:30.420
I'm simply saying that our approach to them,

00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:35.320
how we begin to communicate to them the truth of the gospel,

00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:38.640
is going to vary based upon the individual.

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:40.360
And here the Bible says in verse 22,

00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:42.920
and of some, have compassion.

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:48.980
You know, I find sometimes that maybe it's challenging

00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:53.040
at times for us to have compassion on individuals,

00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:57.720
because we really don't have the heart of Christ,

00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:00.600
but we really look at them, I said this several weeks ago,

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:02.559
as being our enemies.

00:27:03.559 --> 00:27:07.040
And I said this when I preached that text of scripture

00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:09.040
on a Sunday morning, I said this,

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:13.880
that David never made Saul his enemy,

00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:17.660
but Saul made David his enemy continually.

00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:21.720
The Bible tells us in 1 Corinthians 2 and verse 14,

00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:23.400
that the natural man receiveth not the things

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:25.820
of the Spirit of God, for there are foolishness unto him,

00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:26.720
neither can he know them,

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:28.680
because they are spiritually discerned.

00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:32.200
And sometimes what happens is because somebody

00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:35.160
has a completely different worldview than we do,

00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:38.880
they believe something entirely different than we do,

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:41.440
we look at them perhaps as being an enemy,

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:44.580
and we don't have compassion on them.

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:49.360
But the Bible says of some, have compassion,

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:51.020
making a difference.

00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:56.040
It's amazing to me how blind, listen,

00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:58.300
we understand 2 Corinthians 4, the God of this world,

00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:01.119
that's a little g, God of this world, that's Satan,

00:28:01.119 --> 00:28:04.800
hath blinded the minds of them which believe not,

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:07.080
lest the light of the glorious gospel

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:08.900
should shine in unto them.

00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:11.140
When we approach people and begin to talk to them

00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:14.520
about the Lord Jesus Christ, we must not approach them

00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:18.480
and take this approach that I'm better than you.

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:21.360
No, we need to be compassionate,

00:28:22.559 --> 00:28:24.559
because we understand their condition,

00:28:24.559 --> 00:28:26.000
we understand they've been blinded,

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.480
we understand there's a spiritual battle

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:32.119
that's taking place for the soul of that individual,

00:28:32.119 --> 00:28:35.119
and the enemy has done everything possible

00:28:35.119 --> 00:28:38.919
to be able to keep them blinded to the truth of the gospel,

00:28:38.919 --> 00:28:41.540
and then we come along and we have an opportunity

00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:43.160
through whatever means it is,

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:46.040
whether it's just door knocking in a complete stranger,

00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:48.479
or it's a neighbor, or it's a coworker,

00:28:48.479 --> 00:28:50.640
or maybe even a family member,

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:54.200
but we show them the love of Christ.

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:57.840
We have compassion, why?

00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:01.840
Because we understand what happens to that individual

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:04.400
if they die without Christ.

00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:06.479
We've read the entirety of the Bible,

00:29:06.479 --> 00:29:08.799
we've read Revelation chapter 20,

00:29:08.799 --> 00:29:10.479
we're familiar with the judgment,

00:29:10.479 --> 00:29:11.880
the great white throne judgment,

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:14.359
and we know that, and therefore,

00:29:14.359 --> 00:29:16.979
we ought to have some compassion.

00:29:20.479 --> 00:29:22.880
I said this before years ago,

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:25.500
and I believe that it's something that you've heard

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:29.380
from other sources as well, even within other contexts,

00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:32.179
but the reality is that people in general

00:29:32.179 --> 00:29:33.820
don't really care how much you know

00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:35.580
until they know how much you care.

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:40.059
And I find that to be a biblical philosophy,

00:29:40.059 --> 00:29:43.619
though you won't find those exact words in the scriptures,

00:29:43.619 --> 00:29:45.900
you will find that the Apostle Paul,

00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:48.979
as he went to minister in the city of Thessalonica,

00:29:48.979 --> 00:29:51.059
as you read the book of 1 Thessalonians,

00:29:51.059 --> 00:29:53.859
you find that the Apostle Paul was a man

00:29:53.859 --> 00:29:57.460
that moved and worked with compassion.

00:29:57.460 --> 00:29:59.100
He was a man that the Bible tells us,

00:29:59.100 --> 00:29:59.940
in fact, turn over.

00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:04.900
and just look at it, in 1 Thessalonians chapter number one and two, notice what the Bible tells

00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:10.740
us about Paul's ministry there in Thessalonica, because I believe it's important for us to

00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:19.860
understand of some have compassion making a difference. We ought to love people,

00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:25.060
to understand, listen, remember what's the compassion? Painful sympathy,

00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:33.380
a mixed passion compounded of love and sorrow. I remember Chris asking me years ago,

00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:40.260
why do you care about me? Why do you care so much? It's because you're going to die one day,

00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:45.380
and I know what the Bible teaches, and if you die without Christ, you're going to spend

00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:51.620
eternity in the lake of fire. We ought to be compassionate about that. The Bible says in

00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:58.260
the book of 1 Thessalonians, notice in chapter number one, the Bible says in verse number four,

00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:09.139
knowing, brethren, beloved, your election of God, for our gospel came not unto you in word only,

00:31:09.139 --> 00:31:12.900
but also in power to the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance, as you know,

00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:19.620
what manner of men we were among you, notice, for your sake. And so we find that in verse number

00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:25.139
five, Paul talks about the gospel coming to them. It came in word and in power of the Holy Ghost,

00:31:25.139 --> 00:31:32.100
with much assurance, but also notice he says, and what, and you know, what manner of men we were

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:38.500
among you, for your sake. And so Paul gives us some insight in verse number five, as to the

00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:43.860
approach of ministry there in the city of Thessalonica. You could go back to Acts 17,

00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:48.420
and you can read it during the second missionary journey, and you find there's not much given to

00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:52.740
us there, because they're just there for about three Sabbaths, is what the Bible says. And so we

00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:58.580
find that they got saved. The Bible says in verse number six, and you became followers of us, and of

00:31:58.580 --> 00:32:04.980
the Lord, having received the word, and much affliction with joy of the Holy Ghost. And these

00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:09.699
people got saved. And so why did they get saved? Well, just because they were kind men that came

00:32:09.699 --> 00:32:16.500
to the city of Thessalonica? No. Showing up as a kind person, and bringing some bread with you,

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:24.500
and some, that's not going to save anybody. Amen? We see the manner that they came, according to

00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:30.339
verse number five, but they came with the gospel. Now, if they come with the gospel, and they come

00:32:30.339 --> 00:32:35.460
with a terrible attitude, and they come condemning, and all kinds of, are the people going to listen?

00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:40.580
Are they going to be receptive? Do you understand? Can you, are you following tonight? And so we find

00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:45.699
that the Bible says that they became followers of us, and of the Lord. They received the word,

00:32:45.699 --> 00:32:51.619
and much affliction with joy of the Holy Ghost. Notice in chapter number two, the Bible says this,

00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:58.339
in verse number two, it says, but even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully

00:32:58.339 --> 00:33:04.500
entreated, as you know at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God

00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:10.180
with much contention. For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile,

00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:14.419
but as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak,

00:33:14.419 --> 00:33:20.260
not as pleasing men, but God which trieth the hearts, and so we trieth our hearts. So we understand

00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:24.740
that even though they came in with a certain manner in verse number five of chapter one, and

00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:29.220
we're going to get there in just a couple of more verses to really give you the full picture of what

00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:35.860
this manner or behavior was in which they entered into the city, they came not just as nice people

00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:41.619
bringing some, they came bringing the gospel, but their manner was appropriate, their position

00:33:41.619 --> 00:33:45.940
and disposition. Could I use those two words tonight? We could track and follow that.

00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:52.180
Listen, the position is important, Jesus alone, grace alone. Amen? Is that what the Bible teaches?

00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:56.979
Jesus said, I am the way, the truth, and the life. No man cometh unto the Father but by me.

00:33:57.619 --> 00:34:01.699
But what's our disposition is we have the right position, we need to have the right

00:34:01.699 --> 00:34:07.059
disposition having that manner. And so Paul says, as we were allowed of God,

00:34:07.059 --> 00:34:11.619
notice what he says in verse four of chapter two, to be put in trust with the gospel,

00:34:11.619 --> 00:34:18.420
even so we speak. So he didn't change the message in order to be liked. Are you tracking?

00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:27.619
Notice he says in verse number four, not as pleasing men, but God which trieth our hearts.

00:34:27.619 --> 00:34:33.700
So Paul says, we want to have the right disposition, but we can't sacrifice our position

00:34:34.339 --> 00:34:40.019
for our disposition. All right? So we have to speak the truth. We understand that we have to

00:34:40.019 --> 00:34:44.739
please God. We're not just trying to please men. You know what happens when you try to please men?

00:34:44.739 --> 00:34:49.380
Number one, you go insane because you can't do it. But number two, you start watering things down.

00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:54.899
Because you know what we find in second Timothy chapter number four, the time will come when they

00:34:54.899 --> 00:35:01.220
will not endure, what does it say? Sound doctrine. Amen? And so we have to be careful. So Paul says

00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:05.220
this is what we do. But notice as we continue in verse five, he says, for neither at any time

00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:11.459
used be flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloak of covetousness. God is witness. Nor of men

00:35:11.459 --> 00:35:17.299
sought we glory, neither of you nor yet of others, when we might have been burdensome as apostles of

00:35:17.299 --> 00:35:22.739
Christ. And here it is. Here's the manner that he speaks of in chapter one in verse number five.

00:35:22.739 --> 00:35:33.860
But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children. So being affectionately

00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:41.140
desirous, notice what it says, of you. We were willing to have imparted unto you, not the gospel

00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:50.899
of God only, but also our own souls. Why? Because ye were dear unto us. That portion of scripture

00:35:50.899 --> 00:35:57.220
is so impactful to me because it helps us understand a proper philosophy of ministry.

00:35:57.220 --> 00:36:01.059
We've got to have the right position, but we also have to have the right disposition.

00:36:02.019 --> 00:36:07.140
And we have to understand that compassion goes a long way. You know when somebody knows that

00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:12.339
you love them and you care about them, like you truly care about their soul.

00:36:14.899 --> 00:36:19.380
It makes a difference on how they listen to your message. It makes a difference.

00:36:20.899 --> 00:36:25.619
Because they can see a genuine concern and a care and a compassion. And I believe that the

00:36:25.619 --> 00:36:32.580
apostle Paul, I believe that he ministered with compassion. I don't believe that any of those that

00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:38.019
he ministered to could honestly say, I know that people accused him in the attacks and so on and

00:36:38.019 --> 00:36:43.619
so forth that came, but I don't think they could accuse him and it be just an accusation that he

00:36:43.619 --> 00:36:50.339
didn't care about people. He cared about them. He cared about them. And this evening, our Lord and

00:36:50.339 --> 00:36:55.540
Savior, he walked compassionately. By the way, I'm thankful for his compassion that he had on me.

00:36:56.660 --> 00:37:03.459
Amen? And God has called us to walk as Christ walked, and we see all of these things on how

00:37:03.459 --> 00:37:09.540
he walked, but we see tonight that he walked compassionately. So as I examine my life, as you

00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:15.299
examine your life, we must ask ourselves this question, am I walking with compassion?

00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:23.700
Is it obvious to others when I come in contact with them that I really, truly care? Or do we see

00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:31.540
people as problems in my way? Do we have a situation like the disciples, hey Lord, they're

00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:36.980
hungry and the day is far spent, send them home. Because we don't want to be bothered with it.

00:37:37.779 --> 00:37:43.860
But what does Jesus say? Give them something to eat. Right? Give them something to eat.

00:37:44.899 --> 00:37:54.260
And this evening, we cannot walk compassionately without walking in the Spirit.

00:37:56.500 --> 00:38:03.940
We cannot show the love of Christ without walking in the Spirit. We absolutely must abide in him.

00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:10.980
Remember, it starts in 1 John 2 and verse 6, he that saith he abideth in him. The gospel of John,

00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:17.700
15th chapter, we're to abide in him. And as we're walking with him and we're walking in the Spirit,

00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:24.739
God enables us to have and to walk with compassion. Let's pray tonight. Father, we love you.

00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:29.860
We thank you for loving us. Thank you for your Word, the truth contained therein. I pray that

00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:36.340
you'd help us tonight. Lord, as we see the example of our Lord and Savior, I pray that you'd help us

00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:42.340
also to receive the instruction for us to be compassionate, Lord, of some have compassion

00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:50.179
making a difference. And God, help us to never sacrifice our position simply for sake of a

00:38:50.739 --> 00:38:59.619
disposition. But God, I pray that our disposition would align properly even as we see there

00:38:59.619 --> 00:39:06.260
in 1 Thessalonians. Help us, Lord, to walk with compassion. Thank you for the privilege of prayer.

00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:10.900
I pray that you'd bless our time for it's in Christ's name we pray. Amen.
