1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,119
4, 1 John chapter number 4 this morning, 1 John chapter number 4, and we'll be looking

2
00:00:06,119 --> 00:00:19,760
at verses 7-10 this morning, 1 John 4 verses 7-10.

3
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,000
Notice with me, the Bible says, Beloved, let us love one another, for love is of God, and

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,520
everyone that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.

5
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:32,000
He that loveth not knoweth not God, for God is love.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,439
In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent His only begotten

7
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:40,900
Son into the world, that we might live through Him.

8
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:47,680
Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us, and sent His Son to be the

9
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,000
propitiation for our sins.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,560
As we make our return to the book of 1 John this morning, we'll be visiting a recurring

11
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,799
theme, if you will, from the book of 1 John.

12
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:04,839
It was many months ago when we looked at 1 John chapter 2, verses 7-11, in that passage

13
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:05,839
of Scripture.

14
00:01:05,839 --> 00:01:11,480
I titled the message, Love One Another, and we discovered how our love for the brethren

15
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:16,639
really revealed it was an evidence that we were walking in the light.

16
00:01:16,639 --> 00:01:22,000
And we understand our theme this year has been walking in the light, and we said this

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,639
many times as we've studied the book of 1 John that we can say anything, but God gives

18
00:01:27,639 --> 00:01:33,879
us in the book of 1 John some test, if you will, some ways that we can examine our own

19
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:36,199
selves, and this is the evidence.

20
00:01:36,199 --> 00:01:41,599
So if you say that you're walking in the light, the evidence of you walking in the light is

21
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:45,160
that you love one another, you love the brethren.

22
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:49,440
It's not that you love the brethren so that you can be walking in the light, no, you're

23
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:55,239
walking in the light, and the result of walking in the light is that you love one another,

24
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:56,519
you love the brethren.

25
00:01:56,519 --> 00:02:03,160
We also understood as we studied 1 John chapter 3, verses 11-18, and I preached a message

26
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:09,520
from that text of Scripture that I titled, Love in Deed and in Truth.

27
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,639
In that particular passage of Scripture, we found how that our love for the brethren is

28
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:19,199
not only evidence, as we mentioned in the second chapter, of our walking in the light,

29
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:25,240
but also evidence in 1 John chapter 3 that we truly are born again, that we belong to

30
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,320
the Lord.

31
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:32,520
And again, the test that we find in the book of 1 John are not do this so that you can

32
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:40,039
be saved, no, no, the test are if you are saved, here's the evidence, here are the birthmarks

33
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:41,600
of a believer.

34
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:46,479
And we find that as we begin the fourth chapter of the book of 1 John and look at the first

35
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:50,720
six verses, which there's been a period of time since we've been here in the book of

36
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:57,279
1 John, so just a quick overview of that introduction to this chapter, we find that in the beginning

37
00:02:57,279 --> 00:03:03,880
we're reminded of the responsibility that we have as the people of God to try the spirits.

38
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:10,399
We're giving that responsibility and we understand that there's a caution that is provided to

39
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,199
us regarding false teaching.

40
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:18,960
We find that he mentions here that many false prophets are gone out into the world.

41
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:25,119
He mentions about that spirit of Antichrist, and we understand that just as we've studied

42
00:03:25,119 --> 00:03:30,440
the Scriptures and we've seen the existence and the workings of false teachers, that they

43
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:36,440
still exist today, that they're still busy peddling their false ideologies and their

44
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:41,759
false teachings about the Lord Jesus Christ and about His Word.

45
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:46,919
It's interesting specifically in the first few verses of 1 John 4 that he tells us how

46
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:52,880
we're to try the spirits, and he mentions to be able to identify that false teaching,

47
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:57,960
one thing that you'll find consistent amongst false teachers is they get it wrong with Jesus.

48
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:03,119
And he provides us with that truth in this portion of Scripture, and then in the next

49
00:04:03,119 --> 00:04:09,279
few verses he deals with the victory that we have through the Lord Jesus Christ.

50
00:04:09,279 --> 00:04:13,440
We did not sing the song this morning, but for many of us we're knowledgeable, we're

51
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:19,040
aware of that wonderful hymn, Victory in Jesus, and what a great hymn it is, and how thankful

52
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:25,000
we are that we are more than conquerors through Christ, that we are, as the songwriter said

53
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,779
and as Curtis Hudson would often sing, we are on the winning side.

54
00:04:29,779 --> 00:04:34,779
We think about that victory and we find that we referenced that and we understood the victory,

55
00:04:34,779 --> 00:04:40,380
but we understood the reason for the victory is that the truth that he gives us that we

56
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:49,380
often quote in verse number 4, because greater is He that is in you than he that is in the

57
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,380
world.

58
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,940
Aren't you thankful for that powerful truth?

59
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:57,019
Listen, you're not victorious and I'm not victorious because of our own strength, because

60
00:04:57,019 --> 00:04:58,619
of our own abilities.

61
00:04:58,619 --> 00:05:03,339
It's because greater is He that is in me, greater is He that is in you than he that

62
00:05:03,339 --> 00:05:04,339
is in the world.

63
00:05:04,339 --> 00:05:09,420
And we find that we are reminded of those wonderful truths to begin the fourth chapter

64
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:17,380
of the book of 1 John, and then the remainder of the chapter deals with the subject of love.

65
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,739
The subject of love.

66
00:05:18,739 --> 00:05:24,700
What a powerful passage of Scripture we find here in 1 John chapter number 4, verses 7

67
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,500
down through verse number 21.

68
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,380
We won't study it all this morning, over the next couple of weeks we'll study the entirety

69
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:35,579
of this passage, but really it reminds us as John is writing under the inspiration of

70
00:05:35,579 --> 00:05:41,980
the Holy Spirit of God, it stands as a pillar, if you will, along with what Paul wrote under

71
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:45,220
the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God in 1 Corinthians 13.

72
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:49,619
And you think about these two passages of Scripture dealing with the subject matter

73
00:05:49,619 --> 00:05:55,079
of love, and it's in this particular passage in 1 John chapter number 4 that we are mindful

74
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,239
of two very familiar statements that we as believers make.

75
00:05:59,239 --> 00:06:04,119
One of them is this, God is love.

76
00:06:04,119 --> 00:06:06,720
Aren't you thankful for that Bible truth?

77
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:12,040
We find it here in verse number 8, for God is love is how the verse ends, and then right

78
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:18,500
in the middle of verse number 16, the Bible says God is love.

79
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:23,239
Not only this very familiar truth of the Word of God that we often would reference, but

80
00:06:23,239 --> 00:06:27,640
also this truth that we'd often reference as found in this passage of Scripture, where

81
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,959
we'll say this, we love Him, why?

82
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:32,839
Because He first loved us.

83
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:35,160
We read that in verse number 19.

84
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,559
We love Him, but we love Him because He first loved us.

85
00:06:38,559 --> 00:06:42,600
And you understand that as we look at this passage of Scripture this morning, I've titled

86
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:47,959
the message very simply from the end of verse number 8, God is love.

87
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:51,480
I want you to notice with me a few things as we study through this passage of Scripture.

88
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:56,079
Verse number 1, notice God's love revealed.

89
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:57,079
God's love revealed.

90
00:06:57,079 --> 00:07:01,000
We find that at the end of verse number 8, He simply makes that declaration, for God

91
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
is love.

92
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,540
And I want you to think about the human penman, and we understand that all Scripture is given

93
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:11,160
by inspiration of God, and it's profitable for us, and we understand that holy men of

94
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:18,359
God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Spirit, and we understand that this is God's Word,

95
00:07:18,359 --> 00:07:24,079
but God used human beings to be the human penman to the particular books that He's given

96
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:29,440
us, and that's an amazing work of God, by the way, how God would use the individual

97
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,920
personalities of the human beings and yet write Scripture in so much diversity amongst

98
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:39,760
the human penmans, but we understand that it's all through the inspiration of God Almighty.

99
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,260
It's an amazing truth of God's Word.

100
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:46,559
And I want you to think about the human penman just for a moment as John would write this

101
00:07:46,559 --> 00:07:50,720
portion of Scripture, again, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God, but I want you

102
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,519
to be mindful of John, the Apostle, the man that's writing these words, and I want you

103
00:07:55,519 --> 00:08:00,239
to be mindful of the Gospel of John and the way in which one of the most familiar verses

104
00:08:00,239 --> 00:08:08,239
of all of the Word of God is in John 3, in verse 16, for God so loved the world that

105
00:08:08,239 --> 00:08:13,519
He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish but have

106
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:15,480
everlasting life.

107
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:20,579
But aside from that verse and not to diminish the power of that verse, I want you to think

108
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:23,279
about John through the Gospel of John.

109
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:27,200
He refers to Himself never as John the Apostle.

110
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:31,640
He refers to Himself as the one that Jesus loved.

111
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:36,479
Man, that's how He refers to Himself.

112
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,080
Not only does He refer to Himself that way, but John, as he's writing again under the

113
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,719
inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God, as he writes about the miracle that we read of

114
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:50,479
in John chapter 11 when Lazarus is brought up from the dead, the Bible says this when

115
00:08:50,479 --> 00:08:59,880
those messengers come to Jesus, they announce it this way, He whom thou lovest is sick.

116
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:07,280
The Bible then declares in that text of Scripture that Jesus loved Mary and Martha and Lazarus.

117
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:13,159
The text declares in John chapter 11 as Jesus wept that even those Jews that were there,

118
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:18,640
they said, oh, how He loved Him.

119
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:28,119
John was there sitting as Jesus in John chapter number 13 displayed His humility in washing

120
00:09:28,119 --> 00:09:36,320
the feet of the disciples and providing that example of being a servant, and He ends that

121
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:42,359
whole period of time with the disciples at the end of John chapter number 13 by giving

122
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:44,960
them a new commandment.

123
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,239
What was the new commandment?

124
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:52,000
That you love one another as I have loved you.

125
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,960
Not the old commandment that you knew from the Pentateuch, from the law, that you love

126
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,960
your brother as yourself, but now love as I love.

127
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:04,120
And it's interesting, because to start John 13, in verse number 1, the Bible says that

128
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:11,520
Jesus loved them until the end.

129
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:19,240
John heard Jesus speak of love, and John heard Jesus give the instruction, he received the

130
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:29,200
love from Christ, and we find that now John is writing, and he says, God is love.

131
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,600
God is love.

132
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:37,720
It tells us in verse number 9 of our text of Scripture in 1 John 4, it says this, in

133
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:42,040
this was manifested the love of God.

134
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:46,160
The word manifest means to make known, it means to reveal.

135
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:53,040
And we find that John is going to tell us and help us to understand how God's love is

136
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,040
revealed.

137
00:10:54,040 --> 00:11:01,320
See, it's one thing for God to tell us that He loves, and I'm thankful that He does.

138
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,880
It's quite another thing for that love to be manifested, to be revealed, to be made

139
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,620
known.

140
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:14,480
We find that it tells us in verse number 9, in this was manifested the love of God toward

141
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:25,220
us, notice, because that God sent His only begotten Son into the world.

142
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:29,840
This is the way in which God's love is revealed toward mankind.

143
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,520
We find that Jesus was sent into the world.

144
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:36,000
We already have quoted John 3, in verse number 16.

145
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,920
It's in John 17, in verse number 18, that Jesus is praying there before He would go

146
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:46,660
to the cross of Calvary, and we find that He's given great truth in that 17th chapter.

147
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:53,280
But one amazing thing that He says in verse number 18, as thou hast sent Me into the world,

148
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:58,980
even so have I also sent them into the world.

149
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:04,880
Jesus was sent into the world and thus revealing the love of God, in this was manifested the

150
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,200
love of God toward us.

151
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,840
And the Bible says because that God sent His only begotten Son into the world, aren't you

152
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,260
thankful for the coming of Jesus?

153
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:19,160
I understand we're looking for a second coming, amen?

154
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:23,320
And we're thankful for that Bible truth, and we're anxiously awaiting, and we're told that

155
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:27,440
we're to redeem the time, we're to be busy about doing what God's called us to do, but

156
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:33,040
the reality is that we ought to be thankful and so overwhelmed with joy that He came the

157
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,320
first time.

158
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:42,720
Many of the Jews during that first time, they were looking for Jesus to establish His kingdom.

159
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,880
They were looking for Jesus to overthrow the Jews.

160
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:49,960
They were looking for some level of freedom, if you will, but we understand that Jesus

161
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,920
provided so much more.

162
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,780
They didn't get it.

163
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:59,960
They were looking for freedom from the oppression of the Romans, the bondage that they experienced,

164
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:05,280
but Jesus, what He did on that first coming was He provided deliverance from sin.

165
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:10,080
That's what we find in verse number 10 when we think about He was sent into the world.

166
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,140
Listen, He was sent here with a purpose.

167
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:18,280
He was sent here with a purpose, and it tells us in verse number 10, herein is love.

168
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,280
This is love.

169
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:24,720
In fact, you find that He says this, not that we loved God, but that He loved us, and notice,

170
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:31,240
and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins.

171
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,000
So we find that He says that God's love is revealed.

172
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,680
How is God's love revealed?

173
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,920
That Jesus was sent into the world in verse number 9, and we notice that in verse number

174
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:45,960
10 that He provides us with clear truth with regard to the reason, the purpose that Jesus

175
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,960
was sent.

176
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:53,520
Listen, He didn't come to just provide some example, though He did.

177
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:57,460
He didn't come just to teach, though He did.

178
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:01,440
He didn't come just to heal, though He did.

179
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:09,440
He came to be the propitiation for our sins, and that is the greatest purpose, and we look

180
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,920
here and we say, this is how God's love is revealed.

181
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:19,600
It is revealed to us, and we find that the Bible tells us of this great love.

182
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,120
What's your place here in 1 John, and turn to the book of Philippians, if you will, in

183
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:29,160
chapter 2, and what a powerful passage of Scripture in Philippians 2, in verses 5 through

184
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:35,040
8, and I'm going to read the entirety of those verses of Scripture so that we can understand

185
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:41,120
the love that was revealed through Calvary, the understanding that God sent His Son, Jesus,

186
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,980
but He came here with a purpose, and that is to be the propitiation for our sins.

187
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:51,540
That word is not used very often outside of biblical terminology, but we find that

188
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:55,660
really the word propitiation, it means to be the satisfaction.

189
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:59,020
It really is the picture of the Old Testament of the mercy seat.

190
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:04,940
Don't you think about, just before we read Philippians chapter number 2, the tabernacle

191
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,700
in the Old Testament.

192
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:10,460
Of course, it would then be replaced by the temple, but you would find that there was

193
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:16,060
the outer court, and then there's the holy place, and then there's the holy of holies.

194
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:21,820
And in that holy of holies, on once a year, the high priest would go in to place blood

195
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:25,140
there, and you would find that it's referred to as the mercy seat.

196
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:34,540
But that ark was an ark of judgment, aside from the mercy seat, and it perfectly, the

197
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:39,940
glory of the Lord was in that holy of holies, and it perfectly fit on top of that ark of

198
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:40,940
the covenant.

199
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:46,700
And we find that we look and we understand that our great high priest, the Lord Jesus

200
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,580
Christ, that he entered once, right?

201
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,700
He died for sin once.

202
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:56,220
And we read in Philippians 2, it says this, let this mind, in verse number 5, be in you

203
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:00,860
which was also in Christ Jesus, who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery

204
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:08,620
to be equal with God, but notice this, but made himself of no reputation, and took upon

205
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:14,380
him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men.

206
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:20,180
I hope that we never get over the incarnation.

207
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:30,780
Emmanuel, God with us, that he left the throne of heaven, though he was rich, he became poor

208
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:35,740
for our sakes, that we might be rich.

209
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:39,740
If you think about the fact that it tells us here in verse number 8, in being found

210
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:48,580
in fashion as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even the death

211
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,280
of the cross.

212
00:16:50,280 --> 00:17:00,340
Notice in Hebrews chapter number 2, in Hebrews chapter number 2, in verses 14 through 18,

213
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:07,820
we're reminded of Jesus being sent into the world and how his purpose of being the sacrifice

214
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:12,820
for us to be the propitiation for our sins, that God's love is revealed.

215
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:18,240
Notice in verse 14 of Hebrews 2, it says, for as much then as the children are partakers

216
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,860
of flesh and blood, he also himself took part of the same.

217
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:30,920
That through death, notice what he did, he might destroy him that had the power of death,

218
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:40,540
that is, the devil, and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject

219
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,340
to bondage.

220
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:49,420
You know, you meet people all the time that are afraid of dying, there's a fear of death.

221
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:52,000
I no longer fear death.

222
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:59,880
I mean, I'm not anxious to die in the sense of experiencing the process of death, but

223
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,120
I'm going to see Jesus face-to-face.

224
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,960
Can you imagine?

225
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:10,040
Ms. Joyce often talks about heaven.

226
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:15,680
Heaven is a wonderful place, but our mind cannot even come close to comprehending how

227
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,160
wonderful it is.

228
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,280
And when we shall see him, oh, what glory.

229
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:29,200
I no longer fear death because of what he accomplished, notice verse 16, for verily,

230
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,440
he took not on him the nature of angels, why not?

231
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:38,160
Because he couldn't die and provide propitiation for our sins if he was in the form of an angel.

232
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,200
He had to come in the likeness of men.

233
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:45,920
So it tells us at the end of verse number 16, but he took on him the seed of Abraham.

234
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:51,679
Wherefore in all things it behooved him to be made like unto his brethren, why?

235
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:57,240
That he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make

236
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:02,200
reconciliation for the sins of the people.

237
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:06,920
For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succor them that are

238
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,920
tempted.

239
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,440
I'm so thankful that he's our great high priest.

240
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:15,760
I'm so thankful that God's love is revealed as John here in this fourth chapter of the

241
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,040
book of first John begins to discuss again the subject of love.

242
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:26,040
He tells us that we must recognize and notice that God's love is revealed and that God is

243
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:32,480
love and here's how his love was manifested, was made known, was revealed is that God sent

244
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,840
his only begotten son to the world for the purpose of being the propitiation for our

245
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,240
sins.

246
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,880
Not only do we notice that God's love is revealed in this text of scripture, but I want you

247
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,160
to notice number two with me this morning.

248
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,360
Notice this, we are the recipients of God's love.

249
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:55,800
Just being able to meditate on this over the last few days.

250
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,520
What a joy to know that God loves us.

251
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,960
Amen.

252
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:05,800
saying in Sunday school this morning, Jesus loves me, this I know, for the Bible tells

253
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,800
me so.

254
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:12,860
Aren't you thankful to be the recipient of this wonderful love?

255
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:18,200
The Bible tells us here in the text of Scripture, notice in verse number nine, and this was

256
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:26,980
manifested, the love of God, then notice these two words, toward us, oh glory, toward us.

257
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:33,660
Notice it says in verse number ten, here in this love, not that we loved God, but that

258
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,700
He loved us.

259
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:40,100
And I understand this morning that many of us would stand and say, I love the Lord, but

260
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:43,180
you only love Him because He first loved you.

261
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:48,940
You weren't loving God and then got saved, no, God was loving you.

262
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,980
He found us.

263
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:54,380
His great love wherewith He loved us.

264
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:58,900
And we can rejoice this morning in knowing that we are the recipients of the love of

265
00:20:58,900 --> 00:20:59,900
God.

266
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,980
We must never doubt the love of God.

267
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:07,700
We must never in the midst of difficulty and tragedy and turmoil and whatever opposition

268
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:12,100
we face, we must never doubt the love of God.

269
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:15,580
Understand with me this morning that the enemy, the accuser of the brethren, he'll try to

270
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:18,340
get you to doubt the love of God.

271
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:24,020
He'll whisper in your ear that if these things are happening, then evidently God doesn't

272
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,660
love you.

273
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:28,460
Oh, never doubt the love of God.

274
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:32,940
We dealt with that in John 11 in Sunday school several weeks ago.

275
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:38,340
Jesus, He whom thou lovest is sick.

276
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,900
But Jesus didn't depart right away.

277
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,380
He waited.

278
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,380
He waited.

279
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:47,760
And He had purpose in waiting.

280
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,380
He said to the disciples, I'm glad for your sakes that I was not there through the intent

281
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,820
that you might believe.

282
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:59,180
And He performed a great miracle of calling Lazarus and raising him from the dead.

283
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:04,900
And we find that we must never doubt the love of God, and we understand that we are the

284
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,780
recipients of God's wonderful love.

285
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:13,220
The Bible says this in Romans 5 and verse number 8, but God commendeth His love.

286
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:18,060
Again, we see those words, toward us, and that while we're yet sinners, Christ died

287
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:19,060
for us.

288
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:24,340
Again, we see not only the fact that we're the recipients of His love there in Romans

289
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:28,700
5 and verse number 8, but we also see that it's revealed in that He died for us.

290
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,380
Notice what Jeremiah says.

291
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,380
You don't need to turn there.

292
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,380
I'll read the verse for you.

293
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:37,940
But in Jeremiah 31, Jeremiah is speaking about the love of God, and the Bible says this in

294
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:43,660
Jeremiah 31 and verse number 3, the Lord hath appeared of old unto me, saying, Yea, I have

295
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:50,140
loved thee with an everlasting love, therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee.

296
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:55,100
Listen, God's love is different than our love.

297
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,580
God's love is a perfect love.

298
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:00,420
God's love is towards me.

299
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:03,740
I'm the recipient of His love, and it's certainly a joy.

300
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:08,540
And when we think about the Bible truth that we're dealing with this morning, that God

301
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:13,380
is love, that His love is revealed, that we are the recipients of His love, you must understand

302
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:18,060
this morning that this is unique to biblical Christianity.

303
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:24,060
You begin to study the cults of the world and world religions, and you find that many

304
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:29,780
of those polytheistic religions and those false God-type of religions, so-called, you

305
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:38,620
would find that many times their deities are angry with people.

306
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:43,380
Those that are following such false teachings are always trying to do something to gain

307
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,900
the favor of some deity.

308
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:49,020
But our God, He says, I love you.

309
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,200
I love you.

310
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,660
We weren't lovable.

311
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:56,500
We were sinners, lost, undone, and God says, I love you.

312
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,000
Isn't that amazing?

313
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,900
It sets biblical Christianity apart.

314
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:07,100
Someone shared with me, I'm speaking to someone that was blinded by a false world's religion,

315
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:15,140
and he said to them, listen, I just want to leave you with this, God loves you.

316
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:22,180
That simple statement haunted that man for weeks, because he said, as I read through

317
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:29,300
the book that we would use as our Bible, our holy book, if you will, there's nowhere within

318
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:36,460
that book that I'm told that the one that I'm trying to worship loves me.

319
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:41,660
But yet, we see it all throughout the pages of God's Word, that He loves us, that we're

320
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:43,740
the recipients of His love.

321
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:46,500
Listen, we ought never get over that.

322
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,020
We must never doubt the love of God.

323
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:54,300
This morning, when we think about the love of God being declared and revealed, and we

324
00:24:54,300 --> 00:25:00,660
think about God's love being unique, we understand that the word used throughout the New Testament,

325
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:05,340
there are actually several words that are used that are translated in our Bible as love

326
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:08,180
that are different Greek words.

327
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:13,380
And we find that even for us today, we use one word, love, to define several different

328
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:18,380
things, and the context of our subject will determine, our statement will determine what

329
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:21,340
type of love we're speaking of.

330
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:24,500
How many of you have ever said something like, I love pizza?

331
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,500
I love chicken.

332
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,800
I love chicken, amen?

333
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:31,100
And I love some sweet tea.

334
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:35,260
But the reality is that when I use that term, when I say that, that's different than me

335
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:39,140
looking at Holly and saying, Holly, I love you, right?

336
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:43,940
It's different, completely different love.

337
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:48,020
Although Holly gave me a little plaque that sits next to, she's in a nursery.

338
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,820
She's probably listening to me, amen?

339
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,900
Y'all can make fun of her.

340
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,540
She gave me a little thing that sits on my nightstand, and it says, I love you more than

341
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:56,700
tacos.

342
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:00,640
If you know how much Holly loves tacos, I was just saying, well, at least I got a higher

343
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,840
place than tacos, amen?

344
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,480
But the reality is that she saw that thing.

345
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,240
I think one of these Hobby Lobby places, you know, all these ladies like going to Hobby

346
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,240
Lobby.

347
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,240
Some of the men, too.

348
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,240
I've been there a couple of times.

349
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,600
But the reality is that she saw that thing and wanted to get it.

350
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,920
But listen, in the Word of God, there's a few different words, Greek words.

351
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,680
You know, the Greek language is a very unique language.

352
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:24,320
The vocabulary is much broader than the English language, and so they would have different

353
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:31,800
words that we can only just interpret as love, translate, I should say, as love.

354
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,640
But there's a brotherly love.

355
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,240
How many of you have ever heard of the city of Philadelphia?

356
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,280
The city of what?

357
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:42,400
Brotherly love, or brotherly shove, as some people have said.

358
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,680
And if you've been there, maybe you'd agree with that, but it's the city of brotherly

359
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,680
love.

360
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,680
Why?

361
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:53,440
Well, the Greek word, the word for Philadelphia, phileo, is the word love.

362
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,280
That's what that word is.

363
00:26:55,280 --> 00:27:00,120
And so we see that there's different words, and the word for God's love throughout the

364
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,800
New Testament is agape.

365
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:08,360
And that word is a giving of oneself for another.

366
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,720
That's what it means.

367
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,000
It's a sacrificial love.

368
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,360
It's God's love.

369
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:22,560
When I think about being the recipient of God's love and understanding this morning

370
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:29,840
how much He loves us, man, it ought to just overwhelm us.

371
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:35,240
And we ought to be so thankful for God's love.

372
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:41,280
There's a number of songs that have been written about the love of God I referenced already.

373
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,020
Jesus Loves Me, This I Know.

374
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:48,120
But one of my, and I got a lot of favorites, and you know how it is, you read through this

375
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:54,360
songbook of this one, not quite as many as some others, over 800 hymns in our hymnal.

376
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:58,240
But I mean, there are thousands of hymns, there are so many good ones.

377
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:04,200
But I want you to think of the words of Mr. Bliss when he said, I am so glad that our

378
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:09,040
Father in heaven tells of His love in the book He has given.

379
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:13,680
Then he says this, wonderful things in the Bible I see.

380
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,680
Isn't that true?

381
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,460
I mean, there's some wonderful things in the Bible.

382
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:21,660
You read the Word of God and you're overwhelmed and you see all of these wonderful things,

383
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:29,820
but he says this, this is the dearest, that Jesus loves me.

384
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:33,619
I am so glad that Jesus loves me.

385
00:28:33,619 --> 00:28:36,380
Jesus loves even me.

386
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:39,980
Now you know you better than anyone else knows you, and I know me better than anyone else

387
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:40,980
knows me.

388
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:45,260
And we weren't very lovable, amen?

389
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:50,420
But God loved us, and we're the recipients of His love, and we ought to rejoice in that

390
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:51,420
this morning.

391
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:53,780
We ought to be overwhelmed with great joy.

392
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:58,860
Notice how His love is described for us in the book of Romans, in the eighth chapter,

393
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,140
in Romans chapter number 8.

394
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:06,540
And notice what is said here with regard to this love that we read of, this love of God

395
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:09,840
that we are the recipients of.

396
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,380
Many people today do not know the truth that God loves them.

397
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:17,820
Listen, there are many today that would speak of God being love, but they have absolutely

398
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:23,220
no idea what that means.

399
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:26,780
This morning we see God is love, and here's how it was revealed.

400
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:28,220
Here's what it means.

401
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:35,100
It means that He died for you because He loved you, and He did for you what no one else could

402
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:38,820
do for you, what you could not do for yourself.

403
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,619
God is love.

404
00:29:40,619 --> 00:29:44,540
It doesn't mean that we just run around and do whatever we want to do because God is love.

405
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:47,380
That's kind of the idea today.

406
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:54,540
Antinomianism has prevailed in so many arenas in our churches, in our culture, in our communities.

407
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:58,500
But we find that God's love is never described that way in the Word of God.

408
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:01,480
He loves us, and He is love.

409
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,559
And everything that He's given us,

410
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:07,760
we find that He's given us these truths.

411
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,920
Why? Because He loves us.

412
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:14,959
And He wants us to know.

413
00:30:14,959 --> 00:30:16,440
V. 37 of Romans 8,

414
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,899
"'Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors.

415
00:30:19,899 --> 00:30:25,219
Notice this, through Him that loved us.'"

416
00:30:25,219 --> 00:30:28,479
Notice the next two verses.

417
00:30:28,479 --> 00:30:29,600
I like how it starts,

418
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,020
I am persuaded.

419
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:33,180
You know, it's good for us to be persuaded of some things.

420
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,779
To be convinced of some things.

421
00:30:34,779 --> 00:30:36,540
To be settled on some things.

422
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,840
To have some knowledge. Amen?

423
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,939
He says this,

424
00:30:39,939 --> 00:30:44,639
"'That neither death, nor life, nor angels,

425
00:30:44,639 --> 00:30:47,919
nor principalities, nor powers,

426
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:51,180
nor things present, nor things to come,

427
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:53,599
nor height, nor depth,

428
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:56,880
nor any other creature..."

429
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,860
That's a pretty inclusive list, isn't it?

430
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:02,360
I mean, talk about covering all bases.

431
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,779
And He lists all of these things,

432
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:05,660
and then in case someone were to come up

433
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,660
with something that was not captured,

434
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:08,959
He says,

435
00:31:08,959 --> 00:31:14,139
"'nor any other creature shall be able

436
00:31:14,139 --> 00:31:18,000
to separate us from the love of God,

437
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,379
which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.'"

438
00:31:23,379 --> 00:31:26,080
It's overwhelming

439
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,760
when you think about the love of God,

440
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:34,099
and that we are the recipients of this love.

441
00:31:34,099 --> 00:31:36,779
This love that is beyond our ability

442
00:31:36,779 --> 00:31:40,220
to even fully comprehend.

443
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:41,580
But He loves us,

444
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:44,379
and we're the recipients.

445
00:31:44,379 --> 00:31:45,819
We sing the song,

446
00:31:45,819 --> 00:31:50,660
it's just like His great love.

447
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:53,500
You think about the love of God.

448
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,180
Oh, how we should just rejoice

449
00:31:55,199 --> 00:31:57,459
in being the recipient this morning

450
00:31:57,459 --> 00:31:59,500
of such love.

451
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,400
Notice in the passage of Scripture with me

452
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,819
in 1 John 4,

453
00:32:02,819 --> 00:32:08,020
not only that God's love is revealed,

454
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:10,559
rejoice that we are the recipients of God's love,

455
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:13,720
but notice number three,

456
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,020
our response to God's love.

457
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,720
How is it that we respond to such love?

458
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,660
Notice in verse 7,

459
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,559
the Bible says,

460
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:25,100
"'Let us love one another,

461
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,199
for love is of God,

462
00:32:26,199 --> 00:32:28,880
and everyone that loveth is born of God,

463
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,160
and knoweth God.

464
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,679
He that loveth not knoweth not God,

465
00:32:32,679 --> 00:32:33,919
for God is love.'"

466
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:35,600
That's strong language.

467
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,559
But the Bible is just straightforward.

468
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:39,520
Amen?

469
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,800
Some people today run around

470
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,520
talking about being politically correct.

471
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,919
We need to be biblically correct.

472
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:46,759
Amen?

473
00:32:46,759 --> 00:32:47,600
By the way,

474
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,919
it's more important to be biblically correct

475
00:32:48,919 --> 00:32:49,800
and biblically accurate

476
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,960
than it is to be politically correct.

477
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,199
Amen?

478
00:32:53,199 --> 00:32:54,039
You say,

479
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:54,860
pastor, be careful.

480
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:55,699
I understand,

481
00:32:55,699 --> 00:32:56,520
but listen,

482
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,600
you gotta be biblically accurate

483
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,559
and biblically correct.

484
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:01,839
And here the Bible,

485
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:03,779
it says it straightforward.

486
00:33:03,779 --> 00:33:04,619
Listen,

487
00:33:04,619 --> 00:33:07,500
if we are to understand the love of God,

488
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,119
if we understand that we,

489
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:11,160
that his love has been revealed in this manner

490
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,639
and that we are the recipients of his love,

491
00:33:12,639 --> 00:33:14,880
here's our response to his love.

492
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,460
And it deals with that loving one another,

493
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,940
but I want you to think of this,

494
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:22,500
it's the truth that we love him.

495
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,059
We love him.

496
00:33:24,059 --> 00:33:25,539
We read it in verse number 19.

497
00:33:25,539 --> 00:33:27,460
We love him because he first loved us.

498
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:29,179
Notice what it says in verse number 20.

499
00:33:29,179 --> 00:33:30,059
If a man say,

500
00:33:30,059 --> 00:33:32,580
I love God and hateth his brother,

501
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:33,460
he's a liar.

502
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,039
Notice what it says in verse number one

503
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:36,020
of chapter number five.

504
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:38,179
Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ

505
00:33:38,179 --> 00:33:41,179
is born of God and everyone that loveth him

506
00:33:41,179 --> 00:33:42,220
that begat,

507
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,059
that's the redeemer,

508
00:33:43,059 --> 00:33:45,119
loveth him also that is begotten of him,

509
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:46,300
that's the redeemed.

510
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,179
And we find that we must love God.

511
00:33:48,179 --> 00:33:49,779
Listen, when I understand his love,

512
00:33:49,779 --> 00:33:53,380
I love him because he first loved me.

513
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:55,080
But what does it mean to love God?

514
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,479
What does it mean to love God?

515
00:33:58,479 --> 00:34:01,580
So often, again, as we study the book of 1 John,

516
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:04,460
we find that statements are easy to make.

517
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:05,979
It's easy for people to run around today

518
00:34:05,979 --> 00:34:07,460
and say, I love Jesus.

519
00:34:08,899 --> 00:34:10,740
They put it on shirts and on coffee mugs

520
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:11,619
and all kinds of things.

521
00:34:11,619 --> 00:34:13,139
They say all sorts of things,

522
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:14,460
but if you look at their behavior,

523
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,019
what they're doing does not reveal

524
00:34:16,019 --> 00:34:17,140
that they love God.

525
00:34:18,859 --> 00:34:19,700
How do we know that?

526
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:23,660
Well, again, God's given us some test in his word.

527
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:26,100
And he says this in John 14, in verse number 15,

528
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:29,760
if you love me, keep my commandments.

529
00:34:31,059 --> 00:34:32,380
Amen?

530
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,779
So if we're not keeping his commandments,

531
00:34:33,779 --> 00:34:35,299
but we're running around saying we love Jesus,

532
00:34:35,299 --> 00:34:36,239
there's a problem.

533
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,260
Right?

534
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:41,820
Here in 1 John 5, notice what it says in verse number three,

535
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,619
for this is the love of God, what?

536
00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:45,420
That we keep his commandments.

537
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:48,700
And notice what it says, his commandments are not grievous.

538
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:49,579
Why are they not grievous?

539
00:34:49,579 --> 00:34:51,339
Listen, if you try to keep his commandments

540
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:53,140
and you're lost and you don't understand the love of God,

541
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,299
they're grievous.

542
00:34:55,619 --> 00:34:57,140
But his commandments are not grievous to me, why?

543
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:59,179
Because I know he loves me.

544
00:34:59,179 --> 00:35:00,420
And when I know that he loves me

545
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,739
and I know that he has my best interest, if you will,

546
00:35:02,739 --> 00:35:04,579
if I could use that terminology this morning,

547
00:35:04,579 --> 00:35:06,019
he's given us these truths,

548
00:35:06,019 --> 00:35:09,820
he's given us these commands and these requirements

549
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:11,980
as we live for him, he's giving them to us

550
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,820
because he loves us.

551
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:18,260
I say, man, his commandments, they're not grievous to me,

552
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:19,100
why?

553
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,660
Because I know he loves me and I know he's telling me,

554
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:25,380
listen, it's best for me to take heed to his word.

555
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,339
The Bible tells us in Psalm 19,

556
00:35:27,339 --> 00:35:30,100
as it speaks about the law of the Lord being perfect

557
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,700
and all that God's description is,

558
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:34,579
he says, moreover, by them is thy servant warned

559
00:35:34,579 --> 00:35:38,700
and in keeping of them, there is great reward.

560
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,420
It's interesting over in 2 John,

561
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,899
just one chapter in that particular epistle,

562
00:35:45,339 --> 00:35:46,179
but it says in verse number six,

563
00:35:46,179 --> 00:35:50,459
and this is love that we walk after his commandments.

564
00:35:50,459 --> 00:35:52,859
Listen, it's a repeated theme throughout the word of God

565
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:54,859
that if we love Jesus, if we love the Lord,

566
00:35:54,859 --> 00:35:56,660
we're gonna keep his commandments.

567
00:35:56,660 --> 00:36:00,079
And we love him, it's revealed through our obedience.

568
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:02,339
I want you to think about what Paul said,

569
00:36:02,339 --> 00:36:04,179
again, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

570
00:36:04,179 --> 00:36:08,480
but notice what Paul says in Galatians 2 in verse number 20.

571
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,619
We're familiar with the verse of scripture in Galatians 2

572
00:36:11,619 --> 00:36:13,299
in verse number 20, where the Bible says,

573
00:36:13,299 --> 00:36:14,820
I am crucified with Christ.

574
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,700
And just by using those words,

575
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:19,019
some people in their mind can already finish the verse,

576
00:36:19,019 --> 00:36:20,540
you're familiar with the verse.

577
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:23,859
But notice what he says, really, as I begin to understand,

578
00:36:23,859 --> 00:36:25,540
as I look at this verse of scripture

579
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:28,380
and seeing the response that Paul has

580
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:31,980
and how he's determining and he's giving this truth,

581
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:34,619
he's declaring that he's crucified with Christ,

582
00:36:34,619 --> 00:36:35,959
but there's a reason.

583
00:36:35,959 --> 00:36:37,980
Notice he says, I am crucified with Christ,

584
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:41,380
nevertheless I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.

585
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:43,100
And the life which I now live in the flesh,

586
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,399
I live by the faith of the Son of God,

587
00:36:45,399 --> 00:36:47,820
notice these words, who loved me

588
00:36:49,859 --> 00:36:52,820
and gave himself for me.

589
00:36:53,779 --> 00:36:56,959
Listen, because he loves me,

590
00:36:58,239 --> 00:36:59,859
because he gave himself for me,

591
00:36:59,859 --> 00:37:01,739
that's the way it was revealed, right?

592
00:37:01,739 --> 00:37:02,859
How is his love revealed?

593
00:37:02,859 --> 00:37:04,459
It's declared to us, but it's revealed

594
00:37:04,459 --> 00:37:05,779
through him dying for us.

595
00:37:05,779 --> 00:37:08,480
Paul says, my response to his love for me

596
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,579
is I'm gonna live for him.

597
00:37:10,579 --> 00:37:12,140
I am crucified with Christ.

598
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,579
That's my response to God's love.

599
00:37:15,579 --> 00:37:17,579
I wanna live my life to please him.

600
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,899
I wanna live my life to impact eternity.

601
00:37:20,899 --> 00:37:22,959
I know that I'm gonna see him one day.

602
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:27,380
When I see him, I wanna hear, well done,

603
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:32,299
the good and faithful servant, amen?

604
00:37:32,299 --> 00:37:33,859
What I understand is love.

605
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,980
I love him and I wanna live for him.

606
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:40,100
Contextually, we find in the verses

607
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,859
that we're studying specifically this morning

608
00:37:41,859 --> 00:37:43,660
in verses seven through 10,

609
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,540
not only do we love him, love the Lord,

610
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:46,899
but we love the brethren.

611
00:37:47,779 --> 00:37:49,179
Again, the Bible says, beloved,

612
00:37:49,179 --> 00:37:51,739
in verse number seven of 1 John 4,

613
00:37:51,739 --> 00:37:54,779
let us love one another, for love is of God

614
00:37:54,779 --> 00:37:58,299
and everyone that loveth is born of God and knoweth God.

615
00:37:58,299 --> 00:37:59,559
Love for the brethren.

616
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,140
I'm so thankful for the brethren,

617
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:05,260
brothers and sisters in Christ.

618
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:06,100
What a joy.

619
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:09,540
I'm thankful for our church.

620
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:13,160
I really, honestly, I know that we say this

621
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,619
at different times as we give testimony and what have you,

622
00:38:15,619 --> 00:38:18,540
but I honestly, I feel like we're a family.

623
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:23,339
And it's such a joy and such a blessing.

624
00:38:23,339 --> 00:38:28,339
I've had the privilege to be a part of other churches

625
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:33,460
over my time of being saved.

626
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,380
It's the only church I've ever had

627
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,900
the privilege of pastoring.

628
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:40,179
There's something unique about the family of God.

629
00:38:40,179 --> 00:38:41,580
Love for the brethren.

630
00:38:43,179 --> 00:38:46,179
Remember that Jesus said to the disciples

631
00:38:46,179 --> 00:38:48,340
that you love one another as I have loved you,

632
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:49,479
that you also love one another,

633
00:38:49,479 --> 00:38:51,460
but then he says this when we think about that love

634
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:55,299
and yes, being a family and having that love

635
00:38:55,299 --> 00:38:57,619
one for another, but he says, by this shall all men know

636
00:38:57,619 --> 00:39:00,219
that you're my disciples if you love one to another.

637
00:39:00,539 --> 00:39:05,539
It's a matter in which we can testify to even others.

638
00:39:07,099 --> 00:39:08,539
They see something different.

639
00:39:09,419 --> 00:39:11,659
I've had people that have visited our church over the years

640
00:39:11,659 --> 00:39:14,179
that have said, there's something just,

641
00:39:14,179 --> 00:39:16,260
it's like you guys care about each other.

642
00:39:17,179 --> 00:39:19,900
Like, yeah, imagine that.

643
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,299
But what a blessing.

644
00:39:24,299 --> 00:39:25,700
What a blessing.

645
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,820
Love one another.

646
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:33,539
And when we think about our response to the love of God

647
00:39:34,659 --> 00:39:38,020
and we think about the songs that have been written

648
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:42,859
and we think about love so amazing, so divine,

649
00:39:43,979 --> 00:39:45,539
right, it demands what?

650
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,900
My life, my all.

651
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:52,460
That's my response to the love of God.

652
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:54,760
This morning, we ought to be thankful

653
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,700
that God's love has been revealed

654
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,460
in this is man.

655
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:00,660
manifested the love of God toward us.

656
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:01,500
How?

657
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:04,200
That God sent forth his son.

658
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,600
We live through him.

659
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,340
We read that at the end of verse number nine.

660
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:09,240
And by the way, he said that he came

661
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,340
not only to give us eternal life,

662
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:12,840
but to give us abundant life

663
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,180
in John chapter number 10 and verse number 10.

664
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:19,420
Man, I live through him and I live for him.

665
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,420
And that's what he accomplished.

666
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,620
He came to be the propitiation for our sins.

667
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:23,920
And I'm the recipient.

668
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:27,020
I hope this morning, maybe for much of today,

669
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:29,480
we just meditate upon that thought.

670
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,360
God loves me.

671
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,860
Many things in the Bible I see.

672
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,660
Wonderful things, amazing things.

673
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:39,000
He parted the Red Sea.

674
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,600
He said that he created all of these things.

675
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,740
He made the stars also.

676
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,200
I mentioned that in Sunday school.

677
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,580
All of these amazing things and we stand in awe of him.

678
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:51,580
But this is the dearest, that Jesus loves me.

679
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:55,780
I am so glad, overwhelmed,

680
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,640
at the love of God.

681
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,080
But how do I respond?

682
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,620
What's my response?

683
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:02,440
I love him.

684
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:04,520
I live for him.

685
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:06,760
And I love the brethren.

686
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,460
And by this, shall all men know that we're his disciples,

687
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:12,360
by our love one for another.

688
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:15,360
This morning, God is love.

689
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,300
Let's pray.

690
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:21,240
Father, how we thank you for the word of God.

691
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,700
I thank you that you've revealed to us this morning,

692
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:31,180
reminded us this morning of this great Bible truth.

693
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,880
I'm so thankful for your love.

694
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:41,560
God, I pray that in these moments of invitation,

695
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:44,320
Lord, if there's someone here that's not saved,

696
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:49,300
they don't have their sins forgiven,

697
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:53,400
I pray they'd understand in a clear way,

698
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,560
how much you love them.

699
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:59,600
And understand this morning that you died for them,

700
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,240
so they could have eternal life.

701
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,140
God, I pray they'd be saved today.

702
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:12,320
Lord, perhaps there's many here this morning that are saved.

703
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:15,480
I just wanna thank you for your love.

704
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:18,560
Your great love.

705
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:23,020
Lord, as we consider your love,

706
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:25,460
I pray that we'd respond appropriately.

707
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,960
That we'd love you, we'd live for you.

708
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:32,380
We'd love one another.

709
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:35,940
God, I pray that in these moments of invitation,

710
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:40,440
the Holy Spirit of God would have free course,

711
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,280
have your will and way.

712
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,380
I pray that decisions would be made today.

713
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:49,580
Lord, that would cause us to be conformed

714
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:51,780
to the image of Christ and impact eternity.

715
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:55,440
We give you the honor and glory for all that you'll do.

716
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:57,620
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

717
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:58,880
Would you stand with me?

718
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,120
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

719
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,920
Kimberly's gonna play quietly on the piano.

720
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,120
Maybe this morning you're not saved.

721
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,160
We'd love to take a Bible and show you

722
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,720
how you can know for sure that heaven's your home.

723
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:09,960
Maybe this morning you just need to come

724
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,260
and visit this old-fashioned altar

725
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:12,740
and thank him for his love.

726
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,600
For being the recipient of his great love.

727
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:19,360
Maybe this morning you need to make a commitment

728
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,700
on how you're gonna respond to that great love.

729
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:26,440
My life, Lord, I'm gonna live for you

730
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,580
because you died for me, you loved me.

731
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:30,440
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
