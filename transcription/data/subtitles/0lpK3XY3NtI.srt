1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,239
chapter number three, 2 Thessalonians chapter number three,

2
00:00:04,239 --> 00:00:07,820
and I'll be looking at verse number 13 this evening.

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:10,239
And as you know, on Wednesday evenings,

4
00:00:10,239 --> 00:00:11,520
the last couple of weeks, of course,

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,239
last Wednesday was Missions Conference,

6
00:00:13,239 --> 00:00:16,760
the week before I had a lesson, a message,

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,840
kind of preparation, if you will, for Missions Conference.

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,920
And so this evening, after being away from the series

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,360
for a couple of weeks, we're returning to our series,

10
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,139
Walk Worthy, Please God.

11
00:00:28,139 --> 00:00:29,780
And we studied through the latter part

12
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,220
of 1 Thessalonians chapter number five,

13
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:35,599
and after we completed that, we began studying

14
00:00:35,599 --> 00:00:39,200
the latter part of 2 Thessalonians chapter number three,

15
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,319
and this is lesson number 21 in this series

16
00:00:43,319 --> 00:00:45,659
of Walk Worthy, Please God.

17
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:49,360
We understand, and just to kind of give a quick review,

18
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,200
since we've been away from the book for a couple of weeks,

19
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,080
there were some in Thessalonica that were needed

20
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,240
to have their behavior corrected.

21
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,040
We found that in our previous two lessons,

22
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,919
we dealt with the subject matter of disorderly behavior,

23
00:01:02,919 --> 00:01:06,239
and also dealt with the subject of busybodies,

24
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:08,440
as we looked at verse six of chapter three

25
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,639
down through verse number 12.

26
00:01:10,639 --> 00:01:11,959
And we took two weeks to look

27
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:13,599
at those two particular subjects,

28
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:15,500
and so we understood that there were some

29
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,519
within the church that needed to be corrected.

30
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:19,559
Their behavior was not right,

31
00:01:19,559 --> 00:01:21,580
their behavior was not pleasing to the Lord,

32
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,900
and therefore, it needed to be corrected.

33
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,419
We find, however, as we continue to study here

34
00:01:27,419 --> 00:01:28,940
and looking at our verse this evening,

35
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:31,300
that there were some there in Thessalonica

36
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,540
that were doing right, and they were to be

37
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,940
not corrected, but commended.

38
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,260
And I'm thankful for those that do right.

39
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,699
I'm thankful for the acknowledgement

40
00:01:40,699 --> 00:01:43,059
that we see this evening in this verse of scripture,

41
00:01:43,059 --> 00:01:44,819
and we're encouraged to know

42
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:46,419
that there were some in the church.

43
00:01:46,419 --> 00:01:48,660
Of course, we know that the church is a good church,

44
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:52,660
it's a model church, and we find that there were those

45
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,699
that were there that were walking disorderly

46
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,660
and Paul corrects them and gives the instruction

47
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,980
of the church on how to deal with that.

48
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,980
But as we come to verse number 13,

49
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,860
we are encouraged to know that there were,

50
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:08,839
I'm sure, many there that were not only doing right,

51
00:02:08,839 --> 00:02:11,139
but we find that as they're acknowledged

52
00:02:11,139 --> 00:02:14,740
for their right behavior, their well-doing,

53
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:18,300
that we, too, are encouraged by this verse of scripture.

54
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,539
Notice in verse number 13, it's a simple verse

55
00:02:20,539 --> 00:02:22,220
of scripture, the Bible says,

56
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:27,300
but ye, brethren, be not weary in well-doing.

57
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:33,699
But ye, brethren, be not weary in well-doing.

58
00:02:33,699 --> 00:02:36,020
The word weary means to faint.

59
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:39,059
It carries the idea of to be utterly spiritless

60
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:41,220
or to be exhausted.

61
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:46,059
We find that here, the word well-doing means to do well

62
00:02:46,059 --> 00:02:49,619
or to act uprightly, and so Paul is giving,

63
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:52,779
after the correction in verses six through 12

64
00:02:52,779 --> 00:02:55,619
of those that were not behaving properly,

65
00:02:55,619 --> 00:02:58,179
he then changes his attention and he says,

66
00:02:58,179 --> 00:03:03,179
but ye, brethren, be not weary in well-doing.

67
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:06,699
And I find this evening that this is a great charge

68
00:03:06,699 --> 00:03:10,020
that is given to these believers that are doing right,

69
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,259
and sometimes, if we're not careful,

70
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:15,880
as we look at a simple verse of scripture like this,

71
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,539
we can say, well, what is it that I can take from this?

72
00:03:20,259 --> 00:03:22,539
How is it that God is going to help me with this?

73
00:03:22,539 --> 00:03:25,580
And so this evening, I really wanna consider three thoughts

74
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,220
or tips, if you will, and here's the title

75
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:32,979
for the lesson tonight, how to avoid growing weary.

76
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:36,300
How to avoid growing weary.

77
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,899
I think each of us could acknowledge this evening

78
00:03:38,899 --> 00:03:41,860
that it's possible to grow weary.

79
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:45,300
It's possible, as we go through life, to grow weary.

80
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:49,179
It's possible when we are doing right

81
00:03:49,179 --> 00:03:52,259
or doing that which is appropriate,

82
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:53,940
as we find in this text of scripture,

83
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,339
and yet there are others that are not,

84
00:03:55,339 --> 00:03:58,179
that it can become difficult for us,

85
00:03:58,179 --> 00:04:00,619
and so we find that the charge is given,

86
00:04:00,619 --> 00:04:02,539
the encouragement, but ye, brethren,

87
00:04:02,539 --> 00:04:04,919
be not weary in well-doing.

88
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:07,940
As we take this thought from 2 Thessalonians 3,

89
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,660
and of course, having the whole canon of scripture,

90
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,820
I believe that as we look and compare scripture

91
00:04:13,779 --> 00:04:16,299
that there are at least three things this evening

92
00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:19,980
that if we would keep in mind that it would help us

93
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:24,660
as we live life to avoid growing weary.

94
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,579
Now, I'm sure that you could add things.

95
00:04:26,579 --> 00:04:27,660
I could add things.

96
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,000
The list is not exhaustive this evening,

97
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,619
but three quick thoughts for our Bible study tonight.

98
00:04:32,619 --> 00:04:36,940
Number one, if you're taking notes, remember who you serve.

99
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,739
Remember who you serve.

100
00:04:38,739 --> 00:04:40,540
See, the reality this evening is that

101
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,839
it is absolutely necessary.

102
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:44,920
I'd say it's imperative that we remain focused

103
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,500
on the one we serve.

104
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,559
We serve the Lord Christ, the Lord Jesus Christ, our Savior.

105
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,600
He is the one that we serve,

106
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,040
and when our focus is on the fact that we're serving Christ,

107
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:00,239
it enables us, when we remember that we're serving the Lord,

108
00:05:00,239 --> 00:05:04,839
it helps us to avoid growing weary in that well-doing.

109
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:05,660
Why?

110
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,679
Because I'm not doing what I'm doing

111
00:05:07,679 --> 00:05:10,559
to receive acknowledgement or accolades

112
00:05:10,559 --> 00:05:12,640
or some level of recognition.

113
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,760
No, I'm serving the Lord,

114
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,440
and when I remember that I'm serving Christ, I'm not,

115
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,920
listen, people will disappoint you, amen?

116
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,640
People will disappoint you,

117
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,160
and you do something for someone,

118
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,600
and you're trying to serve them,

119
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,600
and if it's only focused on trying to serve them,

120
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,299
and they don't accept the gesture that you've given,

121
00:05:35,299 --> 00:05:37,040
they don't acknowledge what you've done,

122
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,359
they don't give you some level of appreciation

123
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:43,239
or accolade, it can become difficult for you,

124
00:05:43,239 --> 00:05:46,320
and the reality is that as believers, he says,

125
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,279
but ye, brethren, be not weary in well-doing.

126
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:52,720
When we understand that we've been bought with a price,

127
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,359
when we understand that we serve the Lord Jesus Christ,

128
00:05:55,359 --> 00:05:57,320
and that we are his servants,

129
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:01,940
then it enables us to not grow weary in well-doing.

130
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:06,940
We can avoid growing weary by remembering we serve Christ.

131
00:06:07,559 --> 00:06:08,700
We serve Christ.

132
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,540
Look over at the book of Colossians, if you will,

133
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:13,739
in the third chapter, and I want you to notice

134
00:06:13,739 --> 00:06:17,299
what God says here to these believers in Colossae,

135
00:06:17,299 --> 00:06:20,299
and really, these that he's speaking to contextually

136
00:06:20,299 --> 00:06:22,299
in the relationships that are mentioned

137
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:25,239
are those that are servants that are obeying their masters,

138
00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:26,820
according to verse 22,

139
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,019
but I wanna focus on verse 23 and 24,

140
00:06:29,019 --> 00:06:32,059
Colossians three, verse 23 and 24,

141
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:35,179
and I want you to notice what the Bible says

142
00:06:35,179 --> 00:06:36,739
in Colossians three and verse 23,

143
00:06:36,739 --> 00:06:40,500
and whatsoever you do, do it heartily,

144
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,619
and then notice these words,

145
00:06:42,619 --> 00:06:47,619
as to the Lord, and not unto men.

146
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,579
Whatsoever you do, that's all encompassing.

147
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:56,459
I mean, that's everything that we do, whatsoever you do,

148
00:06:56,459 --> 00:07:01,459
notice, do it heartily, as unto the Lord,

149
00:07:02,299 --> 00:07:04,380
not unto men, verse 24,

150
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,339
knowing that of the Lord,

151
00:07:06,339 --> 00:07:08,739
ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance,

152
00:07:08,739 --> 00:07:12,559
for ye serve the Lord Christ.

153
00:07:12,559 --> 00:07:15,019
What a blessing it is to be his servant.

154
00:07:15,019 --> 00:07:16,279
You know, we must remember,

155
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:18,739
we must remind ourselves regularly

156
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:20,420
that we're serving the Lord.

157
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:22,859
See, we're not gonna look at all the passages this evening,

158
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:26,100
but if you study through the New Testament and the epistles,

159
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,480
you find that Paul, on a number of occasions,

160
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,260
not every letter that he writes,

161
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,660
but many of them, he'll say something like this,

162
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,980
Paul, a servant.

163
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,579
You find it in the book of James.

164
00:07:36,579 --> 00:07:39,019
James says, James, a servant.

165
00:07:39,019 --> 00:07:42,859
Peter, in the second epistle, he says, Peter, a servant.

166
00:07:42,859 --> 00:07:45,579
Jude says, Jude, a servant.

167
00:07:45,579 --> 00:07:47,880
John, when he writes the book of Revelation,

168
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,940
obviously under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

169
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,500
he talks about that revelation,

170
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:56,500
he refers to it this way, unto his servant, John.

171
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:59,480
As we think about those references

172
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,220
and the greetings, if you will,

173
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,700
and the epistles and the opening statements,

174
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,980
it reminds us that those servants of the Lord,

175
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:11,619
they were reminded that they were serving Christ.

176
00:08:11,619 --> 00:08:14,100
And this evening, if we're gonna take this admonition,

177
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,940
this charge that was delivered

178
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,779
to these believers in Thessalonica

179
00:08:17,779 --> 00:08:22,299
that we're doing right, that we're living uprightly,

180
00:08:22,299 --> 00:08:24,820
Paul says, but ye, brethren, he says,

181
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:28,660
listen, that when you're doing well, faint not.

182
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:32,520
Don't be weary, don't be weary in well-doing.

183
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,919
And so we mention that that word weary,

184
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:38,400
it means to be faint, to be exhausted.

185
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,919
And this evening, when I'm reminding myself,

186
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:45,039
when you would remind yourself that we're serving Christ,

187
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:49,260
we're serving Christ, what a privilege, what a blessing.

188
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:52,400
But it helps us keep that proper perspective

189
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,340
so that we do not grow weary in well-doing.

190
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:59,440
I know I've been in a situation before

191
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,640
where I am sure you've been there as well,

192
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,500
just a simple illustration where you may be entering

193
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,159
into a store of some sort that has a door

194
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:10,320
that is not automatic and you hold the door for someone

195
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,760
and they just walk right in through,

196
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,840
like you get paid to hold the door for them.

197
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,640
And sometimes if I'm not really in the right spirit,

198
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,919
I might say something like this,

199
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:20,820
as they walk through, you're welcome.

200
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,400
But as believers, if we remind ourselves

201
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:30,280
But as believers, if we remind ourselves

202
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,479
that we're serving Christ, it's a tip,

203
00:09:33,479 --> 00:09:39,440
it's a truth that will help us avoid growing weary

204
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,239
while we're doing right.

205
00:09:41,239 --> 00:09:43,000
Because he says, but ye brethren,

206
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,159
be not weary in well-doing.

207
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:48,640
Number two, not only do we remember who we serve,

208
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:52,619
but number two, we must rely on his power.

209
00:09:52,619 --> 00:09:55,380
Listen, your strength is small, my strength is small,

210
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,380
but we serve the Lord God omnipotent.

211
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,820
He said that he would fill us with his power.

212
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,120
He told us that he has all power in Matthew chapter 28

213
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,620
when he gives the great commission.

214
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,960
He tells us, but ye shall receive power

215
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,720
after the Holy Ghost has come upon you

216
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,460
in Acts one in verse number eight.

217
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:13,860
And we find that he has given to us

218
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:17,740
the opportunity to serve not in our strength,

219
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,400
but in his strength.

220
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,200
And by the way, when you serve in your strength,

221
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,900
you will grow weary.

222
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,640
You will grow weary.

223
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,680
But when you serve and you rely upon his strength,

224
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,320
when you rely upon his power,

225
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,440
you're remembering that you're serving Christ,

226
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,480
you're relying on his power,

227
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,460
then we can come to the place where we faint not.

228
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:41,220
Notice what the Bible says in 2 Corinthians chapter four.

229
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,660
You can look at a couple of verses here

230
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,260
in this passage of scripture.

231
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,920
And we find that the apostle Paul

232
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,900
is giving this second letter to this church in Corinth.

233
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,500
And he's been dealing with lots of things.

234
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,800
And he talks about in verse eight

235
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,140
of 2 Corinthians chapter four,

236
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,940
being troubled on every side

237
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,760
and being perplexed.

238
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,400
But he says that they're not distressed

239
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,040
and they're not in despair.

240
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,040
And we find that they're dealing with all of these pressures

241
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,380
and all of these circumstances.

242
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:11,120
But we find that it begins the chapter

243
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,320
in 2 Corinthians four in verse number one.

244
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,120
Notice it says, therefore seeing we have this ministry

245
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,880
as we have received mercy.

246
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,860
Notice those words, we faint not.

247
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,860
Now in our text of scripture in 2 Thessalonians three,

248
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,720
when Paul writes to the believers in Thessalonica,

249
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,520
he says, but ye brethren, be not weary in well doing.

250
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,920
That word weary and this word faint not,

251
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,520
it's the same word in the Greek.

252
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:41,640
And we find that Paul says that we have this ministry

253
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:45,000
and that we have received mercy, we faint not.

254
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,940
But I want you to understand the truth

255
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:51,380
that Paul reveals to us in verse number 16

256
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,480
as to how they do not faint,

257
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:57,200
and though they're dealing with all of these difficulties

258
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,440
and all of this opposition, in verse number 16,

259
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,680
he says, for which cause, notice again,

260
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,720
you see the words, we faint not.

261
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,080
But though our outward man perish,

262
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,520
yet the inward man is renewed day by day.

263
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,120
What is Paul talking about?

264
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,700
He says the outward man is gonna perish,

265
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:22,360
but the inward man is renewed day by day.

266
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,620
And he's making this comparison

267
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,280
and helping us to understand

268
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,660
it's not in the physical strength of the outward,

269
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:33,400
it's of the spiritual strength of the inward.

270
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,560
How do we continue?

271
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,120
Have you ever heard somebody say,

272
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,460
and our theme for this year is continue,

273
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:41,100
have you ever heard someone say, I just can't go on?

274
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,600
I just can't do anything more.

275
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,140
I would tell you this evening

276
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,040
that if you come to that place,

277
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,140
that it's because you're relying on your own power

278
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,020
and not on his power.

279
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,080
And we have the opportunity to be in a position,

280
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:00,080
listen, if God has called us to be his servants,

281
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,660
if he has given us a place of ministry,

282
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:07,100
then he's also provided for us everything that we need

283
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,260
to fulfill that ministry.

284
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,940
He equips his saints.

285
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,700
And we talked about that in the beginning

286
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,840
of studying through the book of First Timothy,

287
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,840
where Timothy is given that charge

288
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,440
to continue there in Ephesus

289
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,080
and all the things that are going on

290
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,260
and how the man of God was equipped

291
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,540
for the work that God gave him.

292
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,740
And God will equip his people.

293
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,900
And so we see here that this inward man,

294
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,400
he says the inward man is renewed day by day.

295
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,440
How does that happen?

296
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,280
Go to the weight room?

297
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,580
No, that's the outward.

298
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,320
It's getting into your prayer closet.

299
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,780
It's getting into the word of God.

300
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:42,020
It's allowing God's word to get into you

301
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:46,000
and to minister to you and to strengthen that inner man,

302
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,360
to be strengthened spiritually.

303
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,600
Notice what the Bible says in Ephesians chapter three.

304
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,240
As Paul is writing to this church in Ephesus,

305
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,600
and he's now in the third chapter

306
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,480
recording for the believers in Ephesus,

307
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,320
a second prayer that he's prayed for these believers.

308
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,760
And we find that as these prayers are recorded

309
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,240
in the book of Ephesians,

310
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,840
that it helps us to understand

311
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:14,240
how Paul prayed for these believers.

312
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,679
We do not have the time to outline the entire prayer

313
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:19,279
that is given here in Ephesians three,

314
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,640
verses 14 through 21.

315
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,920
But I do want to jump into the middle of the prayer

316
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,360
in verse number 16 and notice with regard

317
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,600
to the subject that we're dealing with,

318
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,520
this being strengthened in the inner man,

319
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,820
notice what it says in verse 16.

320
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,880
That he, speaking of the Lord,

321
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:37,320
would grant you according to the riches of his glory,

322
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:41,200
notice, to be strengthened with might

323
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,080
by his spirit in the inner man.

324
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,960
That's what we need.

325
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:49,920
That's Ephesians three in verse 16.

326
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,240
And so that's what we need.

327
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,960
We need to be strengthened in the inner man

328
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:59,640
by his spirit to have that strength

329
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,820
that we can go forward.

330
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,640
Again, it's not physical strength,

331
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,640
it's spiritual strength that we need.

332
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,899
And we find that the book of Proverbs,

333
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:09,679
it says this in Proverbs 24 in verse number 10,

334
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:11,880
if thou faint in the day of adversity,

335
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,480
thy strength is small.

336
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,200
And so we see that verse in Proverbs 24 in verse number 10.

337
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,839
And again, I do not, yes, you could look at that

338
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:23,020
from a physical strength perspective

339
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:25,279
and you could understand that there's certainly

340
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:26,740
an application with that.

341
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:29,279
But I look at it from a spiritual perspective.

342
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,779
Listen, there's going to be adversity that you face.

343
00:15:32,779 --> 00:15:34,779
You can guarantee when you decide

344
00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:35,960
that you're gonna serve the Lord,

345
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,200
when you're going to do right,

346
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,200
remember, what does he say?

347
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:43,000
But ye brethren, be not weary in well-doing.

348
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,360
When you're doing right, when you're living up rightly,

349
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,619
you're gonna have the pressures,

350
00:15:47,619 --> 00:15:51,160
you're gonna have the opposition that's going to mount.

351
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,660
And if you're doing it in your own power,

352
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:56,420
if you're not recognizing that you're serving the Lord,

353
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,760
then you're going to grow weary.

354
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,800
So how can we avoid growing weary

355
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,000
as we're seeking to live a life that's pleasing to God,

356
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,059
as we're seeking to walk worthy and please God?

357
00:16:09,059 --> 00:16:11,800
We must remember that we serve Christ.

358
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,040
We must rely on his power.

359
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,580
Without me, we know the verse.

360
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:20,540
Without me, you can do nothing, John 15.

361
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,119
We know the verse, but I would submit to you

362
00:16:23,119 --> 00:16:26,040
that many of God's people, though we know the verse here,

363
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,980
we try sometimes to live in our own strength.

364
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,480
We try to live independent.

365
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,399
We try to think that we can,

366
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,360
without me, you can do nothing, nothing.

367
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,320
How we need him.

368
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:41,279
The songwriter said, I need thee every hour.

369
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,520
We sing that song, we're familiar with that song,

370
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,559
and not to criticize or to correct,

371
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:49,960
but the reality is that we need God every second

372
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,480
of every minute of every hour.

373
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,080
We need him.

374
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,839
We need to rely on his power.

375
00:16:56,839 --> 00:17:00,360
It's not through our strength or our power.

376
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,960
It's through his power.

377
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,720
And if you really wanna see what God is able to do,

378
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,020
you rely on his power.

379
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:11,700
And it's amazing what God can do in and through his people.

380
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,100
You think Peter stood up on the day of Pentecost

381
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,100
in his own power and preached?

382
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:16,940
No.

383
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:19,220
You think Peter stood up before the religious leaders

384
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:22,179
of the day as they stood and they commanded

385
00:17:22,179 --> 00:17:24,460
that they no longer could speak or teach in his name

386
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,660
and he stood in his own power and said let it?

387
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:29,399
No, he stood in the power of the Lord.

388
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:34,740
And we, too, this evening, we must rely on his power.

389
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,240
Number three, I would say this.

390
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,000
If we're going to avoid growing weary,

391
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,040
we must rest in his promise.

392
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,160
What promise is that?

393
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,600
Well, turn to the book of Galatians, if you will.

394
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:50,600
We see that as the book of Galatians comes to an end,

395
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,500
that here in the sixth chapter of the book of Galatians,

396
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:57,220
God gives us a truth that is very similar

397
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:01,119
to the truth that we see in 2 Thessalonians 3 in verse 13.

398
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:04,320
But ye brethren, and he says be not weary in well doing.

399
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,240
As we come to Galatians chapter six

400
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,279
and beginning in verse number seven,

401
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:12,559
the Bible says this, be not deceived.

402
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,480
God is not mocked.

403
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,520
For whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.

404
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,600
Now, I admit to you this evening that oftentimes

405
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,140
when we look at the truth of Galatians six and verse seven,

406
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:28,119
many times we deal with it from a perspective

407
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:30,080
of the negative.

408
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,239
But the reality is that the text of scripture

409
00:18:32,239 --> 00:18:34,000
deals with it from both a negative

410
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,280
and a positive perspective.

411
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:39,559
If you sow bad seed, you're gonna reap bad harvest.

412
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:43,200
If you sow good seed, you're gonna have a good harvest.

413
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,160
And we see that in verse number eight,

414
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,679
notice he says, for he that soweth to his flesh

415
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:51,080
shall of the flesh reap corruption.

416
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:54,039
But he that soweth to the spirit shall of the spirit

417
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:55,880
reap life everlasting.

418
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,039
It's a great truth that God gives us in verse number eight.

419
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,400
And then we see in verse number nine,

420
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,000
notice what he says, and let us not be weary in well-doing.

421
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,440
Now, does that sound awfully familiar

422
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,440
to our texts of scriptures

423
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,739
from second Thessalonians three and verse 13?

424
00:19:09,739 --> 00:19:12,440
But ye brethren, be not weary in well-doing.

425
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,600
And so here to the churches in the region of Galatia,

426
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,200
the apostle Paul under the inspiration

427
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,760
of the Holy Spirit of God says,

428
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:22,479
and let us not be weary in well-doing.

429
00:19:22,479 --> 00:19:27,000
And then notice the rest, for in due season,

430
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,419
we shall reap if we faint not.

431
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,640
Did you see what the promise is?

432
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:39,679
The promise is that in due season, we shall reap.

433
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,160
We shall reap if we faint not.

434
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,239
Now, the reality is that we may not reap in our lifetime.

435
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,880
We may begin to see some of the fruit in our lifetime,

436
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,820
but the full harvest may not be realized in our own lifetime.

437
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,299
In fact, I would submit to you this evening

438
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:00,140
that it would be.

439
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:04,740
better if the full of the crop was not reaped in our lifetime, that we're sowing

440
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:09,980
seeds of righteousness into the Spirit, that we're serving Christ so faithfully

441
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:16,220
that that harvest is not just in this lifetime but beyond our lifetime, that we

442
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:22,620
have the opportunity to impact a generation beyond our own lives. Why is

443
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:26,660
it today that we still speak of heroes of the faith, not only Bible characters,

444
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:31,300
but we can speak this evening about those preachers of yesteryear that went

445
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:35,700
home to be with the Lord many years ago, some centuries ago, and yet we speak

446
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:39,020
about them this evening and we're familiar with them and we we have our

447
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:46,140
children read their life accounts. Why? Because they they left an impression,

448
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:50,580
they serve the Lord, they serve faithfully, and they're still reaping

449
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:56,620
today from the seeds that they planted during their lifetime. It's really quite

450
00:20:56,620 --> 00:21:03,740
amazing. The reality this evening is that we find that we can be confident in

451
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:09,300
the promise that God has given and we can continue to do right, we can continue

452
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:14,180
to labor for the Lord because we know that he's given us this promise that

453
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:19,500
that let us not be weary in well-doing for in due season we shall reap if we

454
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:26,180
faint not. How is it that you and I this evening, how is it that these believers

455
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:31,460
in Thessalonica could take that charge, could take that that truth that's given

456
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:37,180
in verse 13 of chapter 3, but ye brethren be not weary in well-doing. Maybe

457
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:40,620
tonight as you examine your life you could say there have been times that I've

458
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:44,940
grown weary in well-doing. Maybe you're in a place right now where you feel like

459
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:50,020
you're weary in well-doing and this evening as we look at these tips it will

460
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:55,460
help us as we remember that we serve the Lord that we rely only solely on his

461
00:21:55,460 --> 00:22:01,900
power that we rest in his promise. You know there are missionaries, we speak

462
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:06,020
about some of them, William Carey, Adam Iron Judson and others of yesteryear

463
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:13,300
that we would speak of that labored for years without ever seeing a convert. They

464
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:18,020
went forth, they surrendered their lives, they went to a place and they labored

465
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:23,900
and they they gave truth but there were no results, there were no responses, but

466
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:29,740
they just kept on doing what God called them to do and you know God gave a

467
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:34,020
harvest, God gave fruit. I want to remind you what the Bible says in 1st

468
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:38,460
Corinthians 15 and verse number 58, therefore my beloved brethren be

469
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:43,660
steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord. Why? For as much as

470
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:51,860
you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord. See as we serve the Lord, as

471
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:59,540
we're doing right, as we're engaged in proper righteous living, as we're seeking

472
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:07,500
to walk worthy and please God, we can labor and not grow weary and not faint.

473
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:14,500
Why? Because we got our eyes on our master. I'm serving the Lord. People will

474
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:18,700
disappoint you. I understand the people are the ones that are right in front of

475
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:23,020
you and sometimes the people are the ones that can that can affect you

476
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:32,300
greatly. We must rely on this power. I am weak but he is strong. I am weak but he

477
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:37,900
is strong and then we rest in his promise. I want you to look in closing

478
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:43,780
to the Old Testament, look over if you will to the book of Nehemiah. The book of

479
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:52,420
Nehemiah gives us the work that God is going to do through his servant. Nehemiah

480
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:57,540
begins, we don't have time to go through the entirety of this book but just very

481
00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:04,380
quickly, it begins with Nehemiah inquiring as to how things were in

482
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:10,660
Jerusalem. He cared enough to ask and he made that request to find out how are

483
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:13,940
things in Jerusalem and he found out that they were in great affliction and

484
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:20,700
reproach, that the walls were broken down and the gates were burned with fire. He

485
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:28,820
responded with prayer, weeping. I mean you see that he fasted, he wept, he mourned, he

486
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:37,340
prayed. He stands before the king. He was the king's cupbearer and throughout the

487
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:44,340
circumstance he is given opportunity to return back to Jerusalem. The request is

488
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:49,140
asked, the king says what does now make requests and he says that I may go

489
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:56,260
back to Jerusalem, that I might build it. We find that Nehemiah goes back and

490
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:59,140
everything's just, I mean everyone's supportive of Nehemiah coming back and

491
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:04,180
building and they, you know, just no. I mean there's opposition, right? Because

492
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:08,700
whenever you try to do a work for God, whenever I try to do a work for God,

493
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:14,660
there's gonna be opposition. But we find that throughout the opposition, if you

494
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:18,580
were to read chapter number four, I mean the attacks that come and all that

495
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:24,100
takes place and you go into chapter five and into chapter six and you find that

496
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:28,740
there's all of these tactics that are used and how the enemy doesn't just quit

497
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:34,540
after one approach. The enemy doesn't just have one tool in his tool bag. When

498
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:41,380
you are not going to give in and cave in and be overcome by that one approach, you

499
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:44,660
can guarantee there's gonna be another approach and you can read through these

500
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:50,340
chapters. But I want to draw your attention to chapter six. I want you to

501
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:57,660
see what happens in chapter number six. In verse number two, the Bible lets us

502
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:03,300
know that they're trying to get Nehemiah to come to a place, one of the villages

503
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:07,140
in the plain of Ono. And he says at the end of the verse, but they thought to do

504
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:12,220
me mischief. And I want you to notice what it says in verse number three. And I

505
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:17,620
sent messengers unto them. And notice where he says, I am doing a great work. I

506
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:22,260
want you to think about this this evening as we close with this idea of

507
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:29,140
how is it that we can avoid growing weary in well-doing. See, Nehemiah says, I

508
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:33,540
am doing a great work. What is it about the work that made it a great work? It's

509
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:38,740
that it was a great work because he's doing it for a great God. That's what

510
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:43,260
made it a great work. He could be in any other place. He could be in any other

511
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:46,700
city. He could be in any other place where he's trying to rebuild walls and

512
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:51,500
rebuild gates. And it's not necessarily a great work in the sense that it's a

513
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:57,660
great work here because he's doing it for our great God. And the Bible says

514
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:03,500
this, so that I cannot come down. Why should the work cease whilst I leave it

515
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:08,380
and come down to you? And then I want you to notice in verse number four, and they

516
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:13,580
sent unto me. Does your Bible say four times after the sort? Listen, the

517
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:19,300
enemy is relentless. You can say no. And I love it. It's kind of a funny thing. Oh

518
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:25,220
no, when they ask you to go to, oh no, right? I mean, I'm not coming. But four

519
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:30,340
times. And then there's an open letter sent that's accusing Nehemiah of wanting

520
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:34,500
to rebuild and do this so that he can be the king, so that he can, in this open,

521
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:40,260
it's just all false accusation. Eventually, at the end of the chapter,

522
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:43,060
they try to, not the end, the middle of the chapter, they tried to get him to

523
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:46,700
come into the temple so that he could be protected because someone's gonna try to

524
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:51,820
kill him. And he says, no, I'm not permitted to go into the temple. And they

525
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:58,340
tried to create this plan so that they could bring an evil report against him.

526
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:04,660
Trying to make him afraid. They try to get him to be weary in well-doing. At

527
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:10,060
every turn, there's opposition. I mean, they had to build, if you were to go back

528
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:14,200
and you look at what's taking place in chapter four, I mean, everyone's building.

529
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:18,640
They have a tool in one hand and a weapon in another hand. I mean, that's not

530
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,640
a great, efficient way to be trying to build. But that's what they're dealing

531
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:27,880
with because of the opposition. But I want you to notice that in chapter six,

532
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:36,640
in verse number 15, the Bible says, so the wall was, did it say finished? Isn't that good?

533
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:41,960
The wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month, Elul. Notice what

534
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:52,920
it says, in fifty and two days. That's amazing. Absolutely amazing. It says that,

535
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:58,400
in verse 16, and it came to pass that when all our enemies heard thereof, and

536
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:02,799
all the heathen that were about us saw these things, they were much cast down in

537
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:07,760
their own eyes. Notice what it says, for they perceived that this work was wrought

538
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:14,840
of our God. You know what even the enemies recognized? It wasn't in Nehemiah's power

539
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:21,559
that this work got accomplished. It was God working through them. It was God blessing.

540
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:28,119
And as we look at this Old Testament example of Nehemiah and the walls being rebuilt and

541
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:33,359
what takes place, we find that as we could look at this truth this evening, how can I

542
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:40,440
avoid growing weary in well-doing? Can we avoid it? I mean, when the pressures come

543
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:46,200
and the opposition mounts and it seems like everyone's against us, can we not grow weary?

544
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:55,000
Well, if we remember we're serving the Lord. Sometimes we can be all about results. We can

545
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,679
be results-oriented. And so long as the results are...

546
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:02,799
What we're looking for, there's, if we can use it

547
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:05,319
in the context of a church, there's new visitors,

548
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:07,239
there's new members, there's salvations,

549
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:09,419
there's baptisms, there's activity.

550
00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:14,419
Man, we can be kind of just pressing on.

551
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:18,919
But when the opposition mounts, when the difficulties come,

552
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:21,439
we serve Christ.

553
00:30:21,439 --> 00:30:22,759
We serve Christ.

554
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:26,279
And we have to rely on His power.

555
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:27,939
It's not in my strength.

556
00:30:27,979 --> 00:30:29,139
You ever feel weak?

557
00:30:30,379 --> 00:30:32,559
It's not about the outward man.

558
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:35,579
It's the inward man that needs to be renewed day by day.

559
00:30:35,579 --> 00:30:37,859
And if God's called you to do it,

560
00:30:37,859 --> 00:30:41,099
He will give you the strength and the power to do it

561
00:30:41,099 --> 00:30:43,979
by His grace, by His power.

562
00:30:43,979 --> 00:30:46,619
And then we just simply rest.

563
00:30:46,619 --> 00:30:51,619
Rest in the promise that you shall reap if we faint not.

564
00:30:51,819 --> 00:30:53,579
Three key words for you this evening

565
00:30:53,579 --> 00:30:56,659
if you wanna avoid growing weary in well-doing.

566
00:30:56,659 --> 00:31:00,739
Remember, rely, and rest.

567
00:31:00,739 --> 00:31:04,659
Remember, rely, and rest.

568
00:31:05,619 --> 00:31:10,179
There are far too many that grow weary in well-doing.

569
00:31:11,259 --> 00:31:14,499
And that's why I believe God gives us

570
00:31:14,499 --> 00:31:17,259
on more than one occasion in His word

571
00:31:17,259 --> 00:31:22,259
this truth about not growing weary in well-doing.

572
00:31:22,739 --> 00:31:25,279
And we must have the right perspective.

573
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:28,319
Otherwise, we too will fall victim, casualty,

574
00:31:29,959 --> 00:31:32,479
to growing weary in well-doing.

575
00:31:32,479 --> 00:31:34,159
We oughta do right.

576
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,559
We oughta be living right.

577
00:31:38,359 --> 00:31:42,319
But we're doing it for Christ and in His power.

578
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:43,139
Let's pray together.

579
00:31:43,139 --> 00:31:44,759
Father, we love you.

580
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:46,759
We thank you for loving us.

581
00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:50,599
And God, I pray this evening that you would help each of us

582
00:31:50,599 --> 00:31:54,599
as we endeavor to live for you, to serve you.

583
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:56,399
God, you would help us to avoid

584
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:58,839
growing weary in well-doing.

585
00:31:58,839 --> 00:32:02,319
God, I pray that you would help us to keep our eyes on thee,

586
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:07,039
to recognize that all that we do is for thee,

587
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:09,879
truly for the audience of one.

588
00:32:10,959 --> 00:32:14,759
And God, that you would help us to keep that perspective.

589
00:32:14,759 --> 00:32:16,599
I pray that you'd help us to rely

590
00:32:17,719 --> 00:32:20,039
upon your power and your strength.

591
00:32:20,879 --> 00:32:23,079
Though the outward man may perish,

592
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:25,879
that the inward man is renewed day by day,

593
00:32:25,879 --> 00:32:28,319
that we spend time in your word and in prayer,

594
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:30,599
that we'd be strengthened by your might,

595
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:33,279
by your spirit in the inner man.

596
00:32:34,359 --> 00:32:36,559
And God, help us to rest in the promise

597
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:42,000
that our labor is not in vain.

598
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,359
Help us to remain steadfast and unmovable.

599
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:50,359
Help us to continue to sow good seed,

600
00:32:50,959 --> 00:32:54,000
to continue to live right and to do right,

601
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,879
knowing that the harvest will come.

602
00:32:57,879 --> 00:32:59,799
We thank you for the privilege of prayer

603
00:32:59,799 --> 00:33:00,799
and corporate prayer.

604
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:03,119
We pray, God, that you'd bless our time.

605
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:06,799
I pray that you'd help us to be encouraged and strengthened.

606
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:10,839
We thank you that you're a God who can do all things.

607
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:12,839
We pray that you'd bless now and we'll thank you for it.

608
00:33:12,839 --> 00:33:16,119
In Christ's name we pray, amen.

609
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:16,959
All right, on the.
