00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.239
chapter number three, 2 Thessalonians chapter number three,

00:00:04.239 --> 00:00:07.820
and I'll be looking at verse number 13 this evening.

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:10.239
And as you know, on Wednesday evenings,

00:00:10.239 --> 00:00:11.520
the last couple of weeks, of course,

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.239
last Wednesday was Missions Conference,

00:00:13.239 --> 00:00:16.760
the week before I had a lesson, a message,

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.840
kind of preparation, if you will, for Missions Conference.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.920
And so this evening, after being away from the series

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.360
for a couple of weeks, we're returning to our series,

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.139
Walk Worthy, Please God.

00:00:28.139 --> 00:00:29.780
And we studied through the latter part

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.220
of 1 Thessalonians chapter number five,

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.599
and after we completed that, we began studying

00:00:35.599 --> 00:00:39.200
the latter part of 2 Thessalonians chapter number three,

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.319
and this is lesson number 21 in this series

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:45.659
of Walk Worthy, Please God.

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:49.360
We understand, and just to kind of give a quick review,

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.200
since we've been away from the book for a couple of weeks,

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.080
there were some in Thessalonica that were needed

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.240
to have their behavior corrected.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.040
We found that in our previous two lessons,

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.919
we dealt with the subject matter of disorderly behavior,

00:01:02.919 --> 00:01:06.239
and also dealt with the subject of busybodies,

00:01:06.239 --> 00:01:08.440
as we looked at verse six of chapter three

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.639
down through verse number 12.

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:11.959
And we took two weeks to look

00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:13.599
at those two particular subjects,

00:01:13.599 --> 00:01:15.500
and so we understood that there were some

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.519
within the church that needed to be corrected.

00:01:17.519 --> 00:01:19.559
Their behavior was not right,

00:01:19.559 --> 00:01:21.580
their behavior was not pleasing to the Lord,

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.900
and therefore, it needed to be corrected.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.419
We find, however, as we continue to study here

00:01:27.419 --> 00:01:28.940
and looking at our verse this evening,

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.300
that there were some there in Thessalonica

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.540
that were doing right, and they were to be

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.940
not corrected, but commended.

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.260
And I'm thankful for those that do right.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:40.699
I'm thankful for the acknowledgement

00:01:40.699 --> 00:01:43.059
that we see this evening in this verse of scripture,

00:01:43.059 --> 00:01:44.819
and we're encouraged to know

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:46.419
that there were some in the church.

00:01:46.419 --> 00:01:48.660
Of course, we know that the church is a good church,

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.660
it's a model church, and we find that there were those

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.699
that were there that were walking disorderly

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.660
and Paul corrects them and gives the instruction

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.980
of the church on how to deal with that.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.980
But as we come to verse number 13,

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.860
we are encouraged to know that there were,

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.839
I'm sure, many there that were not only doing right,

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:11.139
but we find that as they're acknowledged

00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:14.740
for their right behavior, their well-doing,

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.300
that we, too, are encouraged by this verse of scripture.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.539
Notice in verse number 13, it's a simple verse

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:22.220
of scripture, the Bible says,

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.300
but ye, brethren, be not weary in well-doing.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.699
But ye, brethren, be not weary in well-doing.

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:36.020
The word weary means to faint.

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.059
It carries the idea of to be utterly spiritless

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:41.220
or to be exhausted.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.059
We find that here, the word well-doing means to do well

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:49.619
or to act uprightly, and so Paul is giving,

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.779
after the correction in verses six through 12

00:02:52.779 --> 00:02:55.619
of those that were not behaving properly,

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:58.179
he then changes his attention and he says,

00:02:58.179 --> 00:03:03.179
but ye, brethren, be not weary in well-doing.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.699
And I find this evening that this is a great charge

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:10.020
that is given to these believers that are doing right,

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.259
and sometimes, if we're not careful,

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:15.880
as we look at a simple verse of scripture like this,

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.539
we can say, well, what is it that I can take from this?

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:22.539
How is it that God is going to help me with this?

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:25.580
And so this evening, I really wanna consider three thoughts

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.220
or tips, if you will, and here's the title

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.979
for the lesson tonight, how to avoid growing weary.

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:36.300
How to avoid growing weary.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.899
I think each of us could acknowledge this evening

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:41.860
that it's possible to grow weary.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.300
It's possible, as we go through life, to grow weary.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.179
It's possible when we are doing right

00:03:49.179 --> 00:03:52.259
or doing that which is appropriate,

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:53.940
as we find in this text of scripture,

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.339
and yet there are others that are not,

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:58.179
that it can become difficult for us,

00:03:58.179 --> 00:04:00.619
and so we find that the charge is given,

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:02.539
the encouragement, but ye, brethren,

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:04.919
be not weary in well-doing.

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:07.940
As we take this thought from 2 Thessalonians 3,

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.660
and of course, having the whole canon of scripture,

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.820
I believe that as we look and compare scripture

00:04:13.779 --> 00:04:16.299
that there are at least three things this evening

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.980
that if we would keep in mind that it would help us

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.660
as we live life to avoid growing weary.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.579
Now, I'm sure that you could add things.

00:04:26.579 --> 00:04:27.660
I could add things.

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.000
The list is not exhaustive this evening,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.619
but three quick thoughts for our Bible study tonight.

00:04:32.619 --> 00:04:36.940
Number one, if you're taking notes, remember who you serve.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.739
Remember who you serve.

00:04:38.739 --> 00:04:40.540
See, the reality this evening is that

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:41.839
it is absolutely necessary.

00:04:41.839 --> 00:04:44.920
I'd say it's imperative that we remain focused

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.500
on the one we serve.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.559
We serve the Lord Christ, the Lord Jesus Christ, our Savior.

00:04:50.559 --> 00:04:52.600
He is the one that we serve,

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.040
and when our focus is on the fact that we're serving Christ,

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:00.239
it enables us, when we remember that we're serving the Lord,

00:05:00.239 --> 00:05:04.839
it helps us to avoid growing weary in that well-doing.

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:05.660
Why?

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.679
Because I'm not doing what I'm doing

00:05:07.679 --> 00:05:10.559
to receive acknowledgement or accolades

00:05:10.559 --> 00:05:12.640
or some level of recognition.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.760
No, I'm serving the Lord,

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.440
and when I remember that I'm serving Christ, I'm not,

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.920
listen, people will disappoint you, amen?

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.640
People will disappoint you,

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.160
and you do something for someone,

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.600
and you're trying to serve them,

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.600
and if it's only focused on trying to serve them,

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.299
and they don't accept the gesture that you've given,

00:05:35.299 --> 00:05:37.040
they don't acknowledge what you've done,

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:40.359
they don't give you some level of appreciation

00:05:41.079 --> 00:05:43.239
or accolade, it can become difficult for you,

00:05:43.239 --> 00:05:46.320
and the reality is that as believers, he says,

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.279
but ye, brethren, be not weary in well-doing.

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:52.720
When we understand that we've been bought with a price,

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.359
when we understand that we serve the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:05:55.359 --> 00:05:57.320
and that we are his servants,

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.940
then it enables us to not grow weary in well-doing.

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:06.940
We can avoid growing weary by remembering we serve Christ.

00:06:07.559 --> 00:06:08.700
We serve Christ.

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.540
Look over at the book of Colossians, if you will,

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:13.739
in the third chapter, and I want you to notice

00:06:13.739 --> 00:06:17.299
what God says here to these believers in Colossae,

00:06:17.299 --> 00:06:20.299
and really, these that he's speaking to contextually

00:06:20.299 --> 00:06:22.299
in the relationships that are mentioned

00:06:22.299 --> 00:06:25.239
are those that are servants that are obeying their masters,

00:06:25.239 --> 00:06:26.820
according to verse 22,

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.019
but I wanna focus on verse 23 and 24,

00:06:29.019 --> 00:06:32.059
Colossians three, verse 23 and 24,

00:06:32.059 --> 00:06:35.179
and I want you to notice what the Bible says

00:06:35.179 --> 00:06:36.739
in Colossians three and verse 23,

00:06:36.739 --> 00:06:40.500
and whatsoever you do, do it heartily,

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.619
and then notice these words,

00:06:42.619 --> 00:06:47.619
as to the Lord, and not unto men.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.579
Whatsoever you do, that's all encompassing.

00:06:53.579 --> 00:06:56.459
I mean, that's everything that we do, whatsoever you do,

00:06:56.459 --> 00:07:01.459
notice, do it heartily, as unto the Lord,

00:07:02.299 --> 00:07:04.380
not unto men, verse 24,

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:06.339
knowing that of the Lord,

00:07:06.339 --> 00:07:08.739
ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance,

00:07:08.739 --> 00:07:12.559
for ye serve the Lord Christ.

00:07:12.559 --> 00:07:15.019
What a blessing it is to be his servant.

00:07:15.019 --> 00:07:16.279
You know, we must remember,

00:07:16.279 --> 00:07:18.739
we must remind ourselves regularly

00:07:18.739 --> 00:07:20.420
that we're serving the Lord.

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:22.859
See, we're not gonna look at all the passages this evening,

00:07:22.859 --> 00:07:26.100
but if you study through the New Testament and the epistles,

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:28.480
you find that Paul, on a number of occasions,

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:30.260
not every letter that he writes,

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.660
but many of them, he'll say something like this,

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:34.980
Paul, a servant.

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:36.579
You find it in the book of James.

00:07:36.579 --> 00:07:39.019
James says, James, a servant.

00:07:39.019 --> 00:07:42.859
Peter, in the second epistle, he says, Peter, a servant.

00:07:42.859 --> 00:07:45.579
Jude says, Jude, a servant.

00:07:45.579 --> 00:07:47.880
John, when he writes the book of Revelation,

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.940
obviously under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:51.500
he talks about that revelation,

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:56.500
he refers to it this way, unto his servant, John.

00:07:57.079 --> 00:07:59.480
As we think about those references

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.220
and the greetings, if you will,

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:04.700
and the epistles and the opening statements,

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:08.980
it reminds us that those servants of the Lord,

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:11.619
they were reminded that they were serving Christ.

00:08:11.619 --> 00:08:14.100
And this evening, if we're gonna take this admonition,

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:15.940
this charge that was delivered

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:17.779
to these believers in Thessalonica

00:08:17.779 --> 00:08:22.299
that we're doing right, that we're living uprightly,

00:08:22.299 --> 00:08:24.820
Paul says, but ye, brethren, he says,

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:28.660
listen, that when you're doing well, faint not.

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:32.520
Don't be weary, don't be weary in well-doing.

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:34.919
And so we mention that that word weary,

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:38.400
it means to be faint, to be exhausted.

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.919
And this evening, when I'm reminding myself,

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:45.039
when you would remind yourself that we're serving Christ,

00:08:45.039 --> 00:08:49.260
we're serving Christ, what a privilege, what a blessing.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.400
But it helps us keep that proper perspective

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:56.340
so that we do not grow weary in well-doing.

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:59.440
I know I've been in a situation before

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:01.640
where I am sure you've been there as well,

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:04.500
just a simple illustration where you may be entering

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:07.159
into a store of some sort that has a door

00:09:07.159 --> 00:09:10.320
that is not automatic and you hold the door for someone

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.760
and they just walk right in through,

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:14.840
like you get paid to hold the door for them.

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:17.640
And sometimes if I'm not really in the right spirit,

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:18.919
I might say something like this,

00:09:18.919 --> 00:09:20.820
as they walk through, you're welcome.

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:24.400
But as believers, if we remind ourselves

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:30.280
But as believers, if we remind ourselves

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:33.479
that we're serving Christ, it's a tip,

00:09:33.479 --> 00:09:39.440
it's a truth that will help us avoid growing weary

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.239
while we're doing right.

00:09:41.239 --> 00:09:43.000
Because he says, but ye brethren,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.159
be not weary in well-doing.

00:09:45.159 --> 00:09:48.640
Number two, not only do we remember who we serve,

00:09:48.659 --> 00:09:52.619
but number two, we must rely on his power.

00:09:52.619 --> 00:09:55.380
Listen, your strength is small, my strength is small,

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:57.380
but we serve the Lord God omnipotent.

00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:59.820
He said that he would fill us with his power.

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:03.120
He told us that he has all power in Matthew chapter 28

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.620
when he gives the great commission.

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:06.960
He tells us, but ye shall receive power

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.720
after the Holy Ghost has come upon you

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.460
in Acts one in verse number eight.

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:13.860
And we find that he has given to us

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:17.740
the opportunity to serve not in our strength,

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:19.400
but in his strength.

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:22.200
And by the way, when you serve in your strength,

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:23.900
you will grow weary.

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:25.640
You will grow weary.

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.680
But when you serve and you rely upon his strength,

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:31.320
when you rely upon his power,

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:33.440
you're remembering that you're serving Christ,

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.480
you're relying on his power,

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:38.460
then we can come to the place where we faint not.

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:41.220
Notice what the Bible says in 2 Corinthians chapter four.

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:42.660
You can look at a couple of verses here

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:44.260
in this passage of scripture.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:45.920
And we find that the apostle Paul

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:49.900
is giving this second letter to this church in Corinth.

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:52.500
And he's been dealing with lots of things.

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:54.800
And he talks about in verse eight

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.140
of 2 Corinthians chapter four,

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:57.940
being troubled on every side

00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:59.760
and being perplexed.

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.400
But he says that they're not distressed

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:03.040
and they're not in despair.

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:06.040
And we find that they're dealing with all of these pressures

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.380
and all of these circumstances.

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:11.120
But we find that it begins the chapter

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:13.320
in 2 Corinthians four in verse number one.

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:17.120
Notice it says, therefore seeing we have this ministry

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.880
as we have received mercy.

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:22.860
Notice those words, we faint not.

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:25.860
Now in our text of scripture in 2 Thessalonians three,

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:28.720
when Paul writes to the believers in Thessalonica,

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:32.520
he says, but ye brethren, be not weary in well doing.

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:34.920
That word weary and this word faint not,

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:37.520
it's the same word in the Greek.

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:41.640
And we find that Paul says that we have this ministry

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:45.000
and that we have received mercy, we faint not.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.940
But I want you to understand the truth

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:51.380
that Paul reveals to us in verse number 16

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:53.480
as to how they do not faint,

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:57.200
and though they're dealing with all of these difficulties

00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:00.440
and all of this opposition, in verse number 16,

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:02.680
he says, for which cause, notice again,

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:05.720
you see the words, we faint not.

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:08.080
But though our outward man perish,

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:11.520
yet the inward man is renewed day by day.

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.120
What is Paul talking about?

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:19.700
He says the outward man is gonna perish,

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:22.360
but the inward man is renewed day by day.

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.620
And he's making this comparison

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:26.280
and helping us to understand

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:29.660
it's not in the physical strength of the outward,

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:33.400
it's of the spiritual strength of the inward.

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.560
How do we continue?

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:36.120
Have you ever heard somebody say,

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.460
and our theme for this year is continue,

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:41.100
have you ever heard someone say, I just can't go on?

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:43.600
I just can't do anything more.

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:45.140
I would tell you this evening

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:47.040
that if you come to that place,

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:50.140
that it's because you're relying on your own power

00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:52.020
and not on his power.

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:56.080
And we have the opportunity to be in a position,

00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:00.080
listen, if God has called us to be his servants,

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.660
if he has given us a place of ministry,

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:07.100
then he's also provided for us everything that we need

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:09.260
to fulfill that ministry.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.940
He equips his saints.

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:13.700
And we talked about that in the beginning

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:15.840
of studying through the book of First Timothy,

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:17.840
where Timothy is given that charge

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:19.440
to continue there in Ephesus

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.080
and all the things that are going on

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:23.260
and how the man of God was equipped

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.540
for the work that God gave him.

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:27.740
And God will equip his people.

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:29.900
And so we see here that this inward man,

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:32.400
he says the inward man is renewed day by day.

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:33.440
How does that happen?

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:34.280
Go to the weight room?

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:36.580
No, that's the outward.

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:38.320
It's getting into your prayer closet.

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:39.780
It's getting into the word of God.

00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:42.020
It's allowing God's word to get into you

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:46.000
and to minister to you and to strengthen that inner man,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.360
to be strengthened spiritually.

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:51.600
Notice what the Bible says in Ephesians chapter three.

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:55.240
As Paul is writing to this church in Ephesus,

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:57.600
and he's now in the third chapter

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.480
recording for the believers in Ephesus,

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:04.320
a second prayer that he's prayed for these believers.

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:07.760
And we find that as these prayers are recorded

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.240
in the book of Ephesians,

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:10.840
that it helps us to understand

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:14.240
how Paul prayed for these believers.

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:17.679
We do not have the time to outline the entire prayer

00:14:17.679 --> 00:14:19.279
that is given here in Ephesians three,

00:14:19.279 --> 00:14:20.640
verses 14 through 21.

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:22.920
But I do want to jump into the middle of the prayer

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:25.360
in verse number 16 and notice with regard

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:27.600
to the subject that we're dealing with,

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.520
this being strengthened in the inner man,

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:31.820
notice what it says in verse 16.

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:33.880
That he, speaking of the Lord,

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:37.320
would grant you according to the riches of his glory,

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:41.200
notice, to be strengthened with might

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:45.080
by his spirit in the inner man.

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:46.960
That's what we need.

00:14:47.399 --> 00:14:49.920
That's Ephesians three in verse 16.

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:51.240
And so that's what we need.

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:55.960
We need to be strengthened in the inner man

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:59.640
by his spirit to have that strength

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:00.820
that we can go forward.

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:02.640
Again, it's not physical strength,

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:04.640
it's spiritual strength that we need.

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:06.899
And we find that the book of Proverbs,

00:15:06.899 --> 00:15:09.679
it says this in Proverbs 24 in verse number 10,

00:15:09.679 --> 00:15:11.880
if thou faint in the day of adversity,

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:15.480
thy strength is small.

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:18.200
And so we see that verse in Proverbs 24 in verse number 10.

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:20.839
And again, I do not, yes, you could look at that

00:15:20.839 --> 00:15:23.020
from a physical strength perspective

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:25.279
and you could understand that there's certainly

00:15:25.279 --> 00:15:26.740
an application with that.

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:29.279
But I look at it from a spiritual perspective.

00:15:29.279 --> 00:15:32.779
Listen, there's going to be adversity that you face.

00:15:32.779 --> 00:15:34.779
You can guarantee when you decide

00:15:34.779 --> 00:15:35.960
that you're gonna serve the Lord,

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:38.200
when you're going to do right,

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:39.200
remember, what does he say?

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:43.000
But ye brethren, be not weary in well-doing.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.360
When you're doing right, when you're living up rightly,

00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:47.619
you're gonna have the pressures,

00:15:47.619 --> 00:15:51.160
you're gonna have the opposition that's going to mount.

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:53.660
And if you're doing it in your own power,

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:56.420
if you're not recognizing that you're serving the Lord,

00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:58.760
then you're going to grow weary.

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.800
So how can we avoid growing weary

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:06.000
as we're seeking to live a life that's pleasing to God,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.059
as we're seeking to walk worthy and please God?

00:16:09.059 --> 00:16:11.800
We must remember that we serve Christ.

00:16:11.839 --> 00:16:15.040
We must rely on his power.

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:17.580
Without me, we know the verse.

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:20.540
Without me, you can do nothing, John 15.

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:23.119
We know the verse, but I would submit to you

00:16:23.119 --> 00:16:26.040
that many of God's people, though we know the verse here,

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:28.980
we try sometimes to live in our own strength.

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:30.480
We try to live independent.

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:32.399
We try to think that we can,

00:16:32.399 --> 00:16:36.360
without me, you can do nothing, nothing.

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:37.320
How we need him.

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:41.279
The songwriter said, I need thee every hour.

00:16:41.279 --> 00:16:43.520
We sing that song, we're familiar with that song,

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:46.559
and not to criticize or to correct,

00:16:46.559 --> 00:16:49.960
but the reality is that we need God every second

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:52.480
of every minute of every hour.

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:54.080
We need him.

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:56.839
We need to rely on his power.

00:16:56.839 --> 00:17:00.360
It's not through our strength or our power.

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:01.960
It's through his power.

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:04.720
And if you really wanna see what God is able to do,

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:07.020
you rely on his power.

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:11.700
And it's amazing what God can do in and through his people.

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:14.100
You think Peter stood up on the day of Pentecost

00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:16.100
in his own power and preached?

00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:16.940
No.

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:19.220
You think Peter stood up before the religious leaders

00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:22.179
of the day as they stood and they commanded

00:17:22.179 --> 00:17:24.460
that they no longer could speak or teach in his name

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:26.660
and he stood in his own power and said let it?

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:29.399
No, he stood in the power of the Lord.

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:34.740
And we, too, this evening, we must rely on his power.

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:36.240
Number three, I would say this.

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:40.000
If we're going to avoid growing weary,

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.040
we must rest in his promise.

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:44.160
What promise is that?

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.600
Well, turn to the book of Galatians, if you will.

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:50.600
We see that as the book of Galatians comes to an end,

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:53.500
that here in the sixth chapter of the book of Galatians,

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:57.220
God gives us a truth that is very similar

00:17:57.220 --> 00:18:01.119
to the truth that we see in 2 Thessalonians 3 in verse 13.

00:18:01.119 --> 00:18:04.320
But ye brethren, and he says be not weary in well doing.

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:06.240
As we come to Galatians chapter six

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:08.279
and beginning in verse number seven,

00:18:08.279 --> 00:18:12.559
the Bible says this, be not deceived.

00:18:12.559 --> 00:18:14.480
God is not mocked.

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:18.520
For whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:21.600
Now, I admit to you this evening that oftentimes

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:25.140
when we look at the truth of Galatians six and verse seven,

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:28.119
many times we deal with it from a perspective

00:18:28.119 --> 00:18:30.080
of the negative.

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:32.239
But the reality is that the text of scripture

00:18:32.239 --> 00:18:34.000
deals with it from both a negative

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.280
and a positive perspective.

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:39.559
If you sow bad seed, you're gonna reap bad harvest.

00:18:39.559 --> 00:18:43.200
If you sow good seed, you're gonna have a good harvest.

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:45.160
And we see that in verse number eight,

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:48.679
notice he says, for he that soweth to his flesh

00:18:48.679 --> 00:18:51.080
shall of the flesh reap corruption.

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:54.039
But he that soweth to the spirit shall of the spirit

00:18:54.039 --> 00:18:55.880
reap life everlasting.

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:59.039
It's a great truth that God gives us in verse number eight.

00:18:59.039 --> 00:19:00.400
And then we see in verse number nine,

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:05.000
notice what he says, and let us not be weary in well-doing.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.440
Now, does that sound awfully familiar

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:07.440
to our texts of scriptures

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:09.739
from second Thessalonians three and verse 13?

00:19:09.739 --> 00:19:12.440
But ye brethren, be not weary in well-doing.

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:15.600
And so here to the churches in the region of Galatia,

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:17.200
the apostle Paul under the inspiration

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.760
of the Holy Spirit of God says,

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:22.479
and let us not be weary in well-doing.

00:19:22.479 --> 00:19:27.000
And then notice the rest, for in due season,

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.419
we shall reap if we faint not.

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:35.640
Did you see what the promise is?

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:39.679
The promise is that in due season, we shall reap.

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:44.160
We shall reap if we faint not.

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:48.239
Now, the reality is that we may not reap in our lifetime.

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:52.880
We may begin to see some of the fruit in our lifetime,

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:56.820
but the full harvest may not be realized in our own lifetime.

00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:59.299
In fact, I would submit to you this evening

00:19:59.299 --> 00:20:00.140
that it would be.

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:04.740
better if the full of the crop was not reaped in our lifetime, that we're sowing

00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:09.980
seeds of righteousness into the Spirit, that we're serving Christ so faithfully

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:16.220
that that harvest is not just in this lifetime but beyond our lifetime, that we

00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:22.620
have the opportunity to impact a generation beyond our own lives. Why is

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:26.660
it today that we still speak of heroes of the faith, not only Bible characters,

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:31.300
but we can speak this evening about those preachers of yesteryear that went

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:35.700
home to be with the Lord many years ago, some centuries ago, and yet we speak

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:39.020
about them this evening and we're familiar with them and we we have our

00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:46.140
children read their life accounts. Why? Because they they left an impression,

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:50.580
they serve the Lord, they serve faithfully, and they're still reaping

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:56.620
today from the seeds that they planted during their lifetime. It's really quite

00:20:56.620 --> 00:21:03.740
amazing. The reality this evening is that we find that we can be confident in

00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:09.300
the promise that God has given and we can continue to do right, we can continue

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:14.180
to labor for the Lord because we know that he's given us this promise that

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:19.500
that let us not be weary in well-doing for in due season we shall reap if we

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:26.180
faint not. How is it that you and I this evening, how is it that these believers

00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:31.460
in Thessalonica could take that charge, could take that that truth that's given

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:37.180
in verse 13 of chapter 3, but ye brethren be not weary in well-doing. Maybe

00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:40.620
tonight as you examine your life you could say there have been times that I've

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:44.940
grown weary in well-doing. Maybe you're in a place right now where you feel like

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:50.020
you're weary in well-doing and this evening as we look at these tips it will

00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:55.460
help us as we remember that we serve the Lord that we rely only solely on his

00:21:55.460 --> 00:22:01.900
power that we rest in his promise. You know there are missionaries, we speak

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:06.020
about some of them, William Carey, Adam Iron Judson and others of yesteryear

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:13.300
that we would speak of that labored for years without ever seeing a convert. They

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:18.020
went forth, they surrendered their lives, they went to a place and they labored

00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:23.900
and they they gave truth but there were no results, there were no responses, but

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:29.740
they just kept on doing what God called them to do and you know God gave a

00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:34.020
harvest, God gave fruit. I want to remind you what the Bible says in 1st

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:38.460
Corinthians 15 and verse number 58, therefore my beloved brethren be

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:43.660
steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord. Why? For as much as

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:51.860
you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord. See as we serve the Lord, as

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:59.540
we're doing right, as we're engaged in proper righteous living, as we're seeking

00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:07.500
to walk worthy and please God, we can labor and not grow weary and not faint.

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:14.500
Why? Because we got our eyes on our master. I'm serving the Lord. People will

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:18.700
disappoint you. I understand the people are the ones that are right in front of

00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:23.020
you and sometimes the people are the ones that can that can affect you

00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:32.300
greatly. We must rely on this power. I am weak but he is strong. I am weak but he

00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:37.900
is strong and then we rest in his promise. I want you to look in closing

00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:43.780
to the Old Testament, look over if you will to the book of Nehemiah. The book of

00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:52.420
Nehemiah gives us the work that God is going to do through his servant. Nehemiah

00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:57.540
begins, we don't have time to go through the entirety of this book but just very

00:23:57.540 --> 00:24:04.380
quickly, it begins with Nehemiah inquiring as to how things were in

00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:10.660
Jerusalem. He cared enough to ask and he made that request to find out how are

00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:13.940
things in Jerusalem and he found out that they were in great affliction and

00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:20.700
reproach, that the walls were broken down and the gates were burned with fire. He

00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:28.820
responded with prayer, weeping. I mean you see that he fasted, he wept, he mourned, he

00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:37.340
prayed. He stands before the king. He was the king's cupbearer and throughout the

00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:44.340
circumstance he is given opportunity to return back to Jerusalem. The request is

00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:49.140
asked, the king says what does now make requests and he says that I may go

00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:56.260
back to Jerusalem, that I might build it. We find that Nehemiah goes back and

00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:59.140
everything's just, I mean everyone's supportive of Nehemiah coming back and

00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:04.180
building and they, you know, just no. I mean there's opposition, right? Because

00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:08.700
whenever you try to do a work for God, whenever I try to do a work for God,

00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:14.660
there's gonna be opposition. But we find that throughout the opposition, if you

00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:18.580
were to read chapter number four, I mean the attacks that come and all that

00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:24.100
takes place and you go into chapter five and into chapter six and you find that

00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:28.740
there's all of these tactics that are used and how the enemy doesn't just quit

00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:34.540
after one approach. The enemy doesn't just have one tool in his tool bag. When

00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:41.380
you are not going to give in and cave in and be overcome by that one approach, you

00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:44.660
can guarantee there's gonna be another approach and you can read through these

00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:50.340
chapters. But I want to draw your attention to chapter six. I want you to

00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:57.660
see what happens in chapter number six. In verse number two, the Bible lets us

00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:03.300
know that they're trying to get Nehemiah to come to a place, one of the villages

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:07.140
in the plain of Ono. And he says at the end of the verse, but they thought to do

00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:12.220
me mischief. And I want you to notice what it says in verse number three. And I

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:17.620
sent messengers unto them. And notice where he says, I am doing a great work. I

00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:22.260
want you to think about this this evening as we close with this idea of

00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:29.140
how is it that we can avoid growing weary in well-doing. See, Nehemiah says, I

00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:33.540
am doing a great work. What is it about the work that made it a great work? It's

00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:38.740
that it was a great work because he's doing it for a great God. That's what

00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:43.260
made it a great work. He could be in any other place. He could be in any other

00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:46.700
city. He could be in any other place where he's trying to rebuild walls and

00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:51.500
rebuild gates. And it's not necessarily a great work in the sense that it's a

00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:57.660
great work here because he's doing it for our great God. And the Bible says

00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:03.500
this, so that I cannot come down. Why should the work cease whilst I leave it

00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:08.380
and come down to you? And then I want you to notice in verse number four, and they

00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:13.580
sent unto me. Does your Bible say four times after the sort? Listen, the

00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:19.300
enemy is relentless. You can say no. And I love it. It's kind of a funny thing. Oh

00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:25.220
no, when they ask you to go to, oh no, right? I mean, I'm not coming. But four

00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:30.340
times. And then there's an open letter sent that's accusing Nehemiah of wanting

00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:34.500
to rebuild and do this so that he can be the king, so that he can, in this open,

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:40.260
it's just all false accusation. Eventually, at the end of the chapter,

00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:43.060
they try to, not the end, the middle of the chapter, they tried to get him to

00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:46.700
come into the temple so that he could be protected because someone's gonna try to

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:51.820
kill him. And he says, no, I'm not permitted to go into the temple. And they

00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:58.340
tried to create this plan so that they could bring an evil report against him.

00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:04.660
Trying to make him afraid. They try to get him to be weary in well-doing. At

00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:10.060
every turn, there's opposition. I mean, they had to build, if you were to go back

00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:14.200
and you look at what's taking place in chapter four, I mean, everyone's building.

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:18.640
They have a tool in one hand and a weapon in another hand. I mean, that's not

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:21.640
a great, efficient way to be trying to build. But that's what they're dealing

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:27.880
with because of the opposition. But I want you to notice that in chapter six,

00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:36.640
in verse number 15, the Bible says, so the wall was, did it say finished? Isn't that good?

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:41.960
The wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month, Elul. Notice what

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:52.920
it says, in fifty and two days. That's amazing. Absolutely amazing. It says that,

00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:58.400
in verse 16, and it came to pass that when all our enemies heard thereof, and

00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:02.799
all the heathen that were about us saw these things, they were much cast down in

00:29:02.799 --> 00:29:07.760
their own eyes. Notice what it says, for they perceived that this work was wrought

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:14.840
of our God. You know what even the enemies recognized? It wasn't in Nehemiah's power

00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:21.559
that this work got accomplished. It was God working through them. It was God blessing.

00:29:21.559 --> 00:29:28.119
And as we look at this Old Testament example of Nehemiah and the walls being rebuilt and

00:29:28.119 --> 00:29:33.359
what takes place, we find that as we could look at this truth this evening, how can I

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:40.440
avoid growing weary in well-doing? Can we avoid it? I mean, when the pressures come

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:46.200
and the opposition mounts and it seems like everyone's against us, can we not grow weary?

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:55.000
Well, if we remember we're serving the Lord. Sometimes we can be all about results. We can

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.679
be results-oriented. And so long as the results are...

00:29:59.679 --> 00:30:02.799
What we're looking for, there's, if we can use it

00:30:02.799 --> 00:30:05.319
in the context of a church, there's new visitors,

00:30:05.319 --> 00:30:07.239
there's new members, there's salvations,

00:30:07.239 --> 00:30:09.419
there's baptisms, there's activity.

00:30:09.419 --> 00:30:14.419
Man, we can be kind of just pressing on.

00:30:15.839 --> 00:30:18.919
But when the opposition mounts, when the difficulties come,

00:30:19.759 --> 00:30:21.439
we serve Christ.

00:30:21.439 --> 00:30:22.759
We serve Christ.

00:30:23.799 --> 00:30:26.279
And we have to rely on His power.

00:30:26.279 --> 00:30:27.939
It's not in my strength.

00:30:27.979 --> 00:30:29.139
You ever feel weak?

00:30:30.379 --> 00:30:32.559
It's not about the outward man.

00:30:32.559 --> 00:30:35.579
It's the inward man that needs to be renewed day by day.

00:30:35.579 --> 00:30:37.859
And if God's called you to do it,

00:30:37.859 --> 00:30:41.099
He will give you the strength and the power to do it

00:30:41.099 --> 00:30:43.979
by His grace, by His power.

00:30:43.979 --> 00:30:46.619
And then we just simply rest.

00:30:46.619 --> 00:30:51.619
Rest in the promise that you shall reap if we faint not.

00:30:51.819 --> 00:30:53.579
Three key words for you this evening

00:30:53.579 --> 00:30:56.659
if you wanna avoid growing weary in well-doing.

00:30:56.659 --> 00:31:00.739
Remember, rely, and rest.

00:31:00.739 --> 00:31:04.659
Remember, rely, and rest.

00:31:05.619 --> 00:31:10.179
There are far too many that grow weary in well-doing.

00:31:11.259 --> 00:31:14.499
And that's why I believe God gives us

00:31:14.499 --> 00:31:17.259
on more than one occasion in His word

00:31:17.259 --> 00:31:22.259
this truth about not growing weary in well-doing.

00:31:22.739 --> 00:31:25.279
And we must have the right perspective.

00:31:25.279 --> 00:31:28.319
Otherwise, we too will fall victim, casualty,

00:31:29.959 --> 00:31:32.479
to growing weary in well-doing.

00:31:32.479 --> 00:31:34.159
We oughta do right.

00:31:34.159 --> 00:31:36.559
We oughta be living right.

00:31:38.359 --> 00:31:42.319
But we're doing it for Christ and in His power.

00:31:42.319 --> 00:31:43.139
Let's pray together.

00:31:43.139 --> 00:31:44.759
Father, we love you.

00:31:44.759 --> 00:31:46.759
We thank you for loving us.

00:31:46.759 --> 00:31:50.599
And God, I pray this evening that you would help each of us

00:31:50.599 --> 00:31:54.599
as we endeavor to live for you, to serve you.

00:31:54.599 --> 00:31:56.399
God, you would help us to avoid

00:31:56.399 --> 00:31:58.839
growing weary in well-doing.

00:31:58.839 --> 00:32:02.319
God, I pray that you would help us to keep our eyes on thee,

00:32:02.319 --> 00:32:07.039
to recognize that all that we do is for thee,

00:32:07.039 --> 00:32:09.879
truly for the audience of one.

00:32:10.959 --> 00:32:14.759
And God, that you would help us to keep that perspective.

00:32:14.759 --> 00:32:16.599
I pray that you'd help us to rely

00:32:17.719 --> 00:32:20.039
upon your power and your strength.

00:32:20.879 --> 00:32:23.079
Though the outward man may perish,

00:32:23.079 --> 00:32:25.879
that the inward man is renewed day by day,

00:32:25.879 --> 00:32:28.319
that we spend time in your word and in prayer,

00:32:28.319 --> 00:32:30.599
that we'd be strengthened by your might,

00:32:30.599 --> 00:32:33.279
by your spirit in the inner man.

00:32:34.359 --> 00:32:36.559
And God, help us to rest in the promise

00:32:38.759 --> 00:32:42.000
that our labor is not in vain.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.359
Help us to remain steadfast and unmovable.

00:32:45.359 --> 00:32:50.359
Help us to continue to sow good seed,

00:32:50.959 --> 00:32:54.000
to continue to live right and to do right,

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.879
knowing that the harvest will come.

00:32:57.879 --> 00:32:59.799
We thank you for the privilege of prayer

00:32:59.799 --> 00:33:00.799
and corporate prayer.

00:33:00.799 --> 00:33:03.119
We pray, God, that you'd bless our time.

00:33:03.119 --> 00:33:06.799
I pray that you'd help us to be encouraged and strengthened.

00:33:06.799 --> 00:33:10.839
We thank you that you're a God who can do all things.

00:33:10.839 --> 00:33:12.839
We pray that you'd bless now and we'll thank you for it.

00:33:12.839 --> 00:33:16.119
In Christ's name we pray, amen.

00:33:16.119 --> 00:33:16.959
All right, on the.
