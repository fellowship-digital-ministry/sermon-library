1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
chapter 14 this morning, Exodus chapter 14,

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,960
be looking at verses 1 through 31.

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,400
It's a lengthy passage of scripture.

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,840
I will not read the entirety of it

5
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,159
as we begin here this morning,

6
00:00:11,159 --> 00:00:13,159
but let me read just a few verses for you.

7
00:00:13,159 --> 00:00:15,640
Begin with me in verse number one of Exodus 14.

8
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,479
The Bible says this,

9
00:00:16,479 --> 00:00:20,079
"'And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

10
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:22,219
"'Speak unto the children of Israel,

11
00:00:22,219 --> 00:00:26,280
"'that they turn and encamp before Pi-hahiroth,

12
00:00:26,319 --> 00:00:28,819
"'between Migdal and the sea,

13
00:00:28,819 --> 00:00:31,040
"'over against Baal-zephon,

14
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,799
"'before it shall ye encamp by the sea.'"

15
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:37,040
Notice in verse number 31,

16
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:37,880
the Bible says,

17
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,419
"'And Israel saw that great work

18
00:00:40,419 --> 00:00:43,939
"'which the Lord did upon the Egyptians.

19
00:00:43,939 --> 00:00:46,680
"'The people feared the Lord and believed the Lord

20
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,520
"'and His servant Moses.'"

21
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,479
The children of Israel had left Egypt

22
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:53,319
and God led them,

23
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:56,240
as we look at the text of scripture this morning,

24
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,880
to Pi-hahiroth, between Migdal and the sea,

25
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,599
over against Baal-zephon.

26
00:01:01,599 --> 00:01:03,400
We read that in verse number two,

27
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,160
and we find that it would be in this place

28
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,400
where God would instruct His people to set up their camp,

29
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,480
but it would also be here at this place.

30
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,480
As they had the sea before them,

31
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,519
and as we read through the text of scripture here

32
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:16,339
in just a little while,

33
00:01:16,339 --> 00:01:18,919
the Egyptians in hot pursuit behind them,

34
00:01:18,919 --> 00:01:20,559
we find that it would be in this place,

35
00:01:20,559 --> 00:01:22,360
in this text of scripture,

36
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,599
where the children of Israel would be eyewitnesses

37
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:27,839
of God's great work.

38
00:01:27,839 --> 00:01:30,199
It's amazing to me, and it's encouraging to me,

39
00:01:30,199 --> 00:01:32,160
it's exciting to me,

40
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,319
to be able to hear people give testimony

41
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:38,459
of how God is working in their lives.

42
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:41,739
It's exciting to hear folks give testimony

43
00:01:41,739 --> 00:01:44,419
of what God has done in their lives,

44
00:01:44,419 --> 00:01:47,400
and man, those are encouraging times and exciting times.

45
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,339
In fact, the Bible says,

46
00:01:48,339 --> 00:01:50,959
"'Let the redeemed of the Lord say so.'"

47
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:55,400
We're to let our mouths open and give praise unto our God,

48
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:58,199
and it's encouraging, it's exciting to hear

49
00:01:58,199 --> 00:02:02,080
what God is doing in the lives of His people.

50
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,519
I would say this, this morning,

51
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:07,760
it's exciting, encouraging to be able to read the accounts

52
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,440
of what God has done in the lives of His people.

53
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,440
You read through the Bible, it's encouraging,

54
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,839
it's exciting to read what God has done

55
00:02:16,839 --> 00:02:18,839
for these, His people.

56
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:20,440
It's exciting to read books

57
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,199
of those that have gone on before us

58
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:24,419
that have written out testimonies

59
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:28,720
of what God has done in and through their lives.

60
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,440
A pastor friend gave me a book a couple of months ago,

61
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,759
and he said, have you ever read this book?

62
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:35,320
And I said, no, I've not read that book,

63
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,839
I've not heard of that book before,

64
00:02:36,839 --> 00:02:38,039
and he gave me the book,

65
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:40,500
and I began reading it this past week,

66
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,479
and I typically, I have a reading schedule

67
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:44,639
that I'm going through in books,

68
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:45,979
and I kinda, somebody gives me a book,

69
00:02:45,979 --> 00:02:47,039
and I put it on the list,

70
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:49,039
and I'll finish the books that I'm reading,

71
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:50,440
or maybe whatever the next one is,

72
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,960
and I got to this book this week,

73
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,119
and began reading, and it was a man that really,

74
00:02:55,119 --> 00:02:57,479
he's just giving the testimony

75
00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:00,960
of what God did in and through his life.

76
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,559
They're short chapters,

77
00:03:02,559 --> 00:03:05,279
but man, it's encouraging to hear

78
00:03:05,279 --> 00:03:09,479
how a servant of the Lord surrendered his life to God,

79
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:11,500
and God used him.

80
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,960
But I'll say this,

81
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:17,160
what's most exciting is when you have front row seats,

82
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,259
and you get to see God work,

83
00:03:19,259 --> 00:03:23,199
and you're an eyewitness of God's great work.

84
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:24,779
Oh, it's good to hear

85
00:03:24,779 --> 00:03:26,220
about what God's doing in your life,

86
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,199
and how God's working.

87
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:29,839
It's exciting to read of what God has done,

88
00:03:29,839 --> 00:03:32,580
and what God is doing in the lives of other people,

89
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,419
but I'll tell you,

90
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:37,339
when you have the opportunity and the privilege

91
00:03:37,339 --> 00:03:40,580
to see God work in your own life,

92
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,600
and to have those front row seats,

93
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,259
and I've titled the message Eyewitnesses of His Great Work,

94
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:51,179
because there's nothing like seeing God work personally.

95
00:03:51,179 --> 00:03:52,520
Oh, it's exciting to read it.

96
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,979
It's exciting to hear about it,

97
00:03:53,979 --> 00:03:58,899
but oh, how we long to see God work in our own lives.

98
00:03:58,899 --> 00:04:00,460
By the way, God's still working.

99
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,539
God's still on His throne.

100
00:04:01,539 --> 00:04:03,580
God's still able to do exceeding abundantly

101
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,179
above all that we ask or think.

102
00:04:05,179 --> 00:04:06,940
Listen, God's still in control.

103
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,179
He still rules, and He reigns,

104
00:04:09,179 --> 00:04:11,759
and we can rejoice in all of that wonderful truth

105
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:13,580
that God gives us in His word,

106
00:04:13,619 --> 00:04:16,779
and we find that God is still working today.

107
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:18,500
As we look at this portion of scripture,

108
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,739
if you're taking notes this morning,

109
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:23,339
I want you to notice with me, first of all, the dilemma.

110
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:24,500
In verses one through nine,

111
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,660
we find that God provides for us a record,

112
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,459
and I use the phrase the dilemma,

113
00:04:29,459 --> 00:04:32,500
because this would be really the perspective

114
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,059
of the people of God, the children of Israel,

115
00:04:35,059 --> 00:04:38,359
and they obviously thought from a human perspective,

116
00:04:38,359 --> 00:04:42,220
humanly speaking, there was absolutely no way out.

117
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,679
We find, as we've read already in the first two verses,

118
00:04:44,679 --> 00:04:47,220
where they are, and notice in verse number three,

119
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,540
the Bible says, for Pharaoh will say

120
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:53,200
of the children of Israel, they are entangled in the land,

121
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,980
the wilderness hath shut them in.

122
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,059
It says in verse number four,

123
00:04:57,059 --> 00:04:58,739
and I will harden Pharaoh's heart

124
00:04:58,739 --> 00:05:00,899
that he shall follow after them,

125
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:04,299
and I will be honored upon Pharaoh and upon all his host

126
00:05:04,299 --> 00:05:07,140
that the Egyptians may know that I am the Lord,

127
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,100
and they did so.

128
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,660
And it was told the king of Egypt

129
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,459
that the people fled, and the heart of Pharaoh

130
00:05:12,459 --> 00:05:15,299
and of his servants was turned against the people,

131
00:05:15,299 --> 00:05:17,739
and they said, why have we done this,

132
00:05:17,739 --> 00:05:20,380
that we have let Israel go from serving us?

133
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:23,000
The simple answer is all those 10 plagues,

134
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,059
and we dealt with that last week,

135
00:05:25,059 --> 00:05:28,859
how that in Egypt, God made his greatness known,

136
00:05:28,859 --> 00:05:30,820
and we looked at the portion of scripture,

137
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,660
and we understood those ways

138
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,820
in which God made his greatness known,

139
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,859
not only to the Egyptians,

140
00:05:37,859 --> 00:05:39,380
but also to the children of Israel,

141
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,260
but we noticed the Bible says in verse number six,

142
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,899
and he made ready his chariot,

143
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:44,100
and took his people with him,

144
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,859
and he took 600 chosen chariots,

145
00:05:45,859 --> 00:05:47,500
and all the chariots of Egypt,

146
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,820
and captains over every one of them.

147
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,059
The Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh, king of Egypt,

148
00:05:52,059 --> 00:05:54,540
and he pursued after the children of Israel.

149
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,779
The children of Israel went out with a high hand,

150
00:05:56,779 --> 00:05:59,179
but the Egyptians pursued after them,

151
00:05:59,179 --> 00:06:01,260
all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh,

152
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,859
and his horsemen and his army,

153
00:06:02,859 --> 00:06:06,660
and overtook them in camping by the sea beside Pi-hahiroth,

154
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:10,739
which before Bel-Zephon.

155
00:06:10,739 --> 00:06:11,739
I want you to understand that

156
00:06:11,739 --> 00:06:13,420
as we look at this dilemma here,

157
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,339
that the children of Israel would be facing,

158
00:06:15,339 --> 00:06:17,820
it's important for us to recognize this morning

159
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,940
that they were in the place where God led them.

160
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,820
They're in the place where God led them.

161
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:26,220
We find that God spoke that in verse number two to Moses

162
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,779
with regard to the place of the camp,

163
00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:30,220
but if you were to back up into chapter number 13,

164
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,779
and notice in verse number 17 specifically,

165
00:06:32,779 --> 00:06:33,899
we won't read the entirety,

166
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:36,459
but you could read down through the end of the chapter,

167
00:06:36,459 --> 00:06:38,980
but notice in Exodus 13 and verse 17,

168
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,540
the Bible says, and it came to pass

169
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,500
when Pharaoh had let the people go,

170
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,420
notice these words,

171
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:48,260
they're important words that God led them,

172
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,820
that God led them.

173
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,980
Moses was the human leader for the nation of Israel,

174
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,179
God had put him in that place,

175
00:06:55,179 --> 00:06:59,420
but we understand and we see very plainly in the scriptures

176
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:02,339
that it was God that led them.

177
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:03,739
It's important for us to understand

178
00:07:03,739 --> 00:07:05,739
and recognize that truth this morning,

179
00:07:05,739 --> 00:07:07,500
and it says that God led them, notice,

180
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,100
not through the way of the land of the Philistines,

181
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,100
although that was near.

182
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:15,459
For God said, lest peradventure the people repent

183
00:07:15,459 --> 00:07:18,059
when they see war and they return to God,

184
00:07:18,059 --> 00:07:20,339
but God led the people about

185
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:22,700
through the way of the wilderness of the Red Sea,

186
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,980
and the children of Israel went up

187
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:27,660
harnessed out of the land of Egypt.

188
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,260
And so we find that God led the people, notice,

189
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:34,820
it says that he led them not in a certain way.

190
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,059
By the way, it could be argued, as you see here,

191
00:07:37,059 --> 00:07:39,179
that it says, although that was near,

192
00:07:39,179 --> 00:07:41,820
that it would have been a closer route.

193
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,940
Some kid told me years ago, I said, man, how was the trip?

194
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,500
He said, we took the long cut.

195
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,619
I'd never heard anyone say that before,

196
00:07:48,619 --> 00:07:52,540
and they were really making an insult against the driving

197
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:55,019
of the fact that they didn't take a shortcut,

198
00:07:55,019 --> 00:07:56,739
but we find that God led them.

199
00:07:56,739 --> 00:07:58,619
Listen, I'm sure that within the congregation

200
00:07:58,619 --> 00:07:59,820
of the nation of Israel,

201
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,179
that there were some that said, why don't we go this way?

202
00:08:02,179 --> 00:08:04,459
Moses, the reason why we're not going that way

203
00:08:04,459 --> 00:08:07,980
is because Moses isn't leading, it's God that's leading.

204
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:10,500
We find that God led them to the exact place

205
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,980
where he wanted them to be,

206
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,940
and we find that as God would lead them,

207
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,019
that they find themselves in this position.

208
00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:18,059
We find that as we've read the text of scripture

209
00:08:18,059 --> 00:08:21,299
in verses five through nine, that God records for us

210
00:08:21,299 --> 00:08:24,540
the way in which the Egyptians would pursue

211
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,940
the children of Israel.

212
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:30,179
Their thought would be that they were entangled in the land,

213
00:08:30,179 --> 00:08:32,140
that the wilderness hath shut them in,

214
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,419
according to verse number three.

215
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:38,739
Humanly speaking, it seems like there's no way out.

216
00:08:38,739 --> 00:08:40,260
Maybe you've been in a position like that

217
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,099
before in your life.

218
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:43,500
Maybe you would say, not publicly,

219
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,900
but maybe in your heart this morning,

220
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,900
you'd say, you know, I'm in a position like that right now.

221
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,820
But humanly speaking, it seems like there's no way out.

222
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:54,340
I'm facing a dilemma in my life, I'm facing a difficulty,

223
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,299
and it seems as if there's no way out.

224
00:08:56,299 --> 00:08:58,099
Listen, do not doubt God.

225
00:08:58,099 --> 00:08:59,940
Someone said this, a preacher of yesteryear,

226
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,140
never put a question where God's put a period.

227
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,380
And the reality is that there are times in our life

228
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:08,979
that God will lead us, and we follow the leadership of God

229
00:09:08,979 --> 00:09:11,900
in our lives, and it might take us directly to a place

230
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:15,659
where it seems like there's no way out.

231
00:09:15,659 --> 00:09:18,299
But God, but God.

232
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:21,940
I'm so thankful that we have a God of the impossible.

233
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,739
I'm so thankful that we have a God,

234
00:09:23,739 --> 00:09:28,739
in fact, it's how appropriate the bulletin this morning,

235
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:33,859
Luke 137, for with God nothing shall be impossible.

236
00:09:34,539 --> 00:09:37,859
I don't pick the bulletins, but what a blessing.

237
00:09:37,859 --> 00:09:40,859
This was the next one in line, we order them quarterly.

238
00:09:40,859 --> 00:09:42,460
And what a blessing, listen,

239
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:45,619
we serve the God of the impossible.

240
00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:48,099
And humanly speaking, sometimes we just look at things

241
00:09:48,099 --> 00:09:50,979
on the human plane, we look at it from our own perspective.

242
00:09:50,979 --> 00:09:53,859
If you're like me, at times you face a situation,

243
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:55,820
you wanna roll your sleeves up and get to work,

244
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,539
and let's figure this thing out.

245
00:09:57,539 --> 00:09:59,940
And sometimes it's difficult for us to.

246
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:03,640
But stand back and let God work.

247
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,720
The dilemma.

248
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,820
I want you to notice that their dilemma, as we continue reading through the text of Scripture

249
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:12,660
beginning in verse number 10, number two, their distress.

250
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,660
Their distress.

251
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:21,660
Unfortunately, the children of Israel forgot some of what they had just seen in Egypt.

252
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:29,220
In fact, they'd saw the power of God on display as we mentioned with the plagues and all that

253
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:35,900
took place and God demonstrating His greatness and those plagues that affected all, both

254
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,020
the Egyptians and the children of Israel.

255
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:43,120
But then, as we would note and as we looked at last week, how there were a series of plagues

256
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,820
that only affected the Egyptians.

257
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:50,660
They did not affect the children of Israel and God was showing, He was making that distinction.

258
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:55,460
He was making His power, His greatness known to His people.

259
00:10:55,460 --> 00:11:01,380
We said this last week, we ended the service by saying that God always has a purpose and

260
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:06,020
that God was making His greatness known so that we would know it personally, so that

261
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:10,779
we would praise Him accordingly, and so that we would trust Him fully.

262
00:11:10,779 --> 00:11:12,139
You know what's very interesting to me?

263
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:18,700
There are times in which God will lead us directly into a place to see if we'll trust Him.

264
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:24,139
To see if what we say is really how we live.

265
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:27,340
It's easy to talk.

266
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,900
It's another thing to live the walk.

267
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:36,180
And we find that the children of Israel, their dilemma is followed by their distress.

268
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:41,260
Notice their perspective as it is revealed to us in verses 10, 11, and 12.

269
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:46,060
The Bible says in verse number 10, and when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel

270
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:51,060
lifted up their eyes and behold, the Egyptians marched after them.

271
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:54,380
The Bible tells us they were sore afraid.

272
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,220
The children of Israel cried out unto the Lord.

273
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,580
But notice what they say as they cry out.

274
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:04,980
They said unto Moses, because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to

275
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,180
die in the wilderness?

276
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:13,500
Wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us to carry us forth out of Egypt?

277
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:19,820
Their perspective, they were going to be controlled by fear.

278
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:25,900
As you look at this text of Scripture, it shows us in verse number 12, notice it says,

279
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:30,180
is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying let us alone that we may

280
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,260
serve the Egyptians?

281
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:35,460
They were regretting the fact that they even left Egypt.

282
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:43,300
So there are times in which we begin to face a difficulty in life, a dilemma, and then

283
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:47,380
we start retracing our steps and we can regret some things.

284
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:51,260
And they respond with fear, they're being controlled by fear.

285
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:55,220
They regret leaving Egypt, they believe that death was certain.

286
00:12:55,220 --> 00:13:00,419
They say in verse number 11 that you've taken us, there's not enough graves in Egypt, that's

287
00:13:00,419 --> 00:13:02,460
why you brought us here to die in the wilderness.

288
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:07,900
Notice at the end of verse number 12, for it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians

289
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:12,100
than that we should die in the wilderness.

290
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:17,339
Now several weeks ago, we looked at a portion of Scripture in Horeb, God made His greatness.

291
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:22,180
And we looked in that portion of Scripture to start in the life of Moses, because Moses

292
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:27,820
made that declaration that God hath begun to reveal His greatness to him.

293
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:32,820
And we looked at how that started in Horeb, and if you remember with me back to that portion

294
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:40,339
of Scripture, you find that it was there that God revealed to Moses that He heard the cries

295
00:13:40,339 --> 00:13:41,900
of His people.

296
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,059
And what was their cry?

297
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:48,339
Well, they weren't loving Egypt.

298
00:13:48,339 --> 00:13:50,820
They were overworked.

299
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,100
They had a rough time.

300
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:58,260
They were crying out for deliverance, and now after they've been delivered, after they're

301
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:03,380
facing this dilemma, notice what they say, that it had been better for us to serve the

302
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,380
Egyptians.

303
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:12,300
Oh, they're beginning to doubt, they're beginning to doubt how God had led them in what God

304
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,900
was doing.

305
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,779
Their distress is evident to us as we note their perspective.

306
00:14:17,779 --> 00:14:22,660
But I'm so thankful that as we see their perspective that we find in the next several verses here

307
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:27,299
in Exodus chapter number 14, we see God's promises.

308
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:31,700
I'm so thankful for the promises of God, aren't you?

309
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:36,459
You think about the promises we sing about, standing on the promises, we find about Peter

310
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:41,660
saying that God has given us exceeding great and precious promises.

311
00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:44,899
I'm so thankful for the promises of God's Word.

312
00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:50,380
And here as we note the perspective of the people of God, we find that God is going to

313
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:54,940
give some promises in verse number 13, and Moses said unto the people, fear ye not, stand

314
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:59,260
still and see the salvation of the Lord which He will show to you today.

315
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:03,459
For the Egyptians whom ye have seen today, ye shall see them again no more forever.

316
00:15:03,459 --> 00:15:07,700
Notice the Bible says the Lord shall fight for you and ye shall hold your place.

317
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:11,660
The Lord said unto Moses, wherefore cryest thou unto me, speak unto the children of Israel

318
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,660
that they go forward.

319
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:17,339
I want you to think about that simple phrase at the end of verse number 15, that they go

320
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:18,339
forward.

321
00:15:18,339 --> 00:15:20,299
Humanly speaking, it's impossible.

322
00:15:20,299 --> 00:15:21,580
What is before them?

323
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,580
The Red Sea.

324
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:25,580
How are we going to go forward?

325
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,420
The Red Sea.

326
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,459
How are we going to do that?

327
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:34,179
Notice as we continue and consider the promises of God in verse number 16, the Bible says,

328
00:15:34,179 --> 00:15:36,459
but lift thou up thy rod.

329
00:15:36,459 --> 00:15:37,459
Remember that rod?

330
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:42,660
Remember when Moses in Horeb, he says, they're not going to believe me.

331
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:49,540
God told him, I am, hath sent thee unto them, and he then asked him, he said, Moses, what's

332
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,540
in your hand?

333
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,540
His rod.

334
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,540
His rod.

335
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:58,500
And here we find he says, but lift thou up thy rod and stretch out thine hand over the

336
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:05,940
sea and divide it, and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of

337
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,619
the sea.

338
00:16:07,619 --> 00:16:08,619
That's amazing.

339
00:16:08,619 --> 00:16:14,540
Listen, I understand that Exodus 14 is a familiar passage of scripture, but that's amazing.

340
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,059
It's absolutely phenomenal.

341
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:18,619
Listen, they'd not seen anything like this before.

342
00:16:18,619 --> 00:16:21,179
They'd never experienced anything like this before.

343
00:16:21,179 --> 00:16:24,220
God says, go forward, and here's what I'm going to do, I'm going to make a path for

344
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,220
you.

345
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,019
I'm going to provide a way.

346
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:31,059
He says, Moses, take that rod, lift it up, stretch out thine hand over the sea and divide

347
00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:32,059
it.

348
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:35,059
Understand with me this morning that it was God that divided the Red Sea.

349
00:16:35,179 --> 00:16:37,260
It was not Moses that divided the Red Sea.

350
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:43,380
Yes, God used him and he had to do what God told him to do, but it was God Almighty that

351
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,179
parted that Red Sea.

352
00:16:45,179 --> 00:16:50,540
And God said this, that you would go over on dry ground.

353
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:54,739
That's amazing to me because reality would tell you that if you part some waters that

354
00:16:54,739 --> 00:17:01,660
had just been flowing, they're going to be mucky and muddy and difficult to travel over.

355
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,739
Correct?

356
00:17:03,019 --> 00:17:07,019
God said, I'm going to make it dry.

357
00:17:07,019 --> 00:17:08,420
God is able.

358
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,420
He's able.

359
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:15,980
We find that the Bible says in verse number 17, and behold, and I, behold, I will harden

360
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:18,580
the hearts of the Egyptians and they shall follow them.

361
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:22,059
And I will get me honor upon Pharaoh and upon all his hosts, upon his chariots and upon

362
00:17:22,059 --> 00:17:23,339
his horsemen.

363
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:26,820
And the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord when I have gotten me honor upon Pharaoh,

364
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:29,260
upon his chariots and upon his horsemen.

365
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:31,940
The angel of God, we'll get to verse 19 in just a moment.

366
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:36,339
But listen, what it tells us in verse 17 and 18 about the Egyptians following, I'd understand

367
00:17:36,339 --> 00:17:38,339
why they would want to follow.

368
00:17:38,339 --> 00:17:41,660
If you just watched the whole congregation of the children of Israel cross over on dry

369
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:45,179
ground and the whole reason that you left Egypt to come to where you did in the first

370
00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:50,380
place was to kill them and to conquer them, you'd follow after them as well.

371
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,860
You just watched them walk over there.

372
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:54,019
You said, well, we're going to go also.

373
00:17:54,019 --> 00:17:56,619
But notice what the Bible says in verse number 19.

374
00:17:56,619 --> 00:17:57,619
This is amazing.

375
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:03,179
As we begin to see the deliverance of God, even in verses 19 and 20, we see his great

376
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:04,179
power.

377
00:18:04,179 --> 00:18:07,739
The Bible says, and the angel of God which went before the camp of Israel removed and

378
00:18:07,739 --> 00:18:09,380
went behind them.

379
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:13,779
The pillar of the cloud went from before their face and stood behind them.

380
00:18:13,779 --> 00:18:15,700
Who was behind them?

381
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,140
The Egyptians.

382
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,619
The sea is before them.

383
00:18:18,619 --> 00:18:20,580
The Egyptians are behind them.

384
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:25,500
The Bible says in verse number 20, and it came between the camp of the Egyptians, the

385
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,500
camp of Israel.

386
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,380
There's a cloud and darkness to them.

387
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,380
Who's them?

388
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,380
That's the Egyptians.

389
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:35,059
The Bible says, but it gave light by night to these.

390
00:18:35,059 --> 00:18:36,580
These are the children of Israel.

391
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:40,460
So the one came not near the other all the night.

392
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,020
Isn't that amazing?

393
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:45,700
Honestly, I think that as many times I've read through the passage of scriptures, many

394
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:50,739
times I've looked at this portion, and I love the account of the crossing of the Red Sea,

395
00:18:50,739 --> 00:18:56,220
that oftentimes we skim over verses 19 and 20, but that's miraculous as well.

396
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:00,979
How that God set that difference, how that He came between them.

397
00:19:00,979 --> 00:19:05,260
And we find that for one, it was darkness for the Egyptians, but for the children of

398
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,059
Israel, it was light for them.

399
00:19:07,059 --> 00:19:12,059
And it says so that the one came not near the other all the night.

400
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:14,979
Listen, our God is able.

401
00:19:14,979 --> 00:19:16,340
Our God is able.

402
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,700
We see the dilemma.

403
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:21,700
We see their distress, but I want you to notice with me their deliverance.

404
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,700
Their deliverance.

405
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:26,539
And it begins in verse 19, as we've just read about that distinction that God did in

406
00:19:26,539 --> 00:19:28,580
demonstrating His power.

407
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:32,580
But notice with me as we continue reading in verse number 21, and I want you to see

408
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,659
what they saw.

409
00:19:34,659 --> 00:19:36,179
I want you to read verse 21.

410
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:42,900
It says, and Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the Lord caused the sea

411
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:50,900
to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and the

412
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:55,700
waters were divided.

413
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,539
Could you imagine seeing that?

414
00:19:58,539 --> 00:20:00,099
You knew what was right in front of you.

415
00:20:00,099 --> 00:20:02,099
You knew it was the Red Sea.

416
00:20:02,099 --> 00:20:04,099
You knew there was a big body of water.

417
00:20:04,099 --> 00:20:06,099
The reason that you were in distress

418
00:20:06,099 --> 00:20:09,099
is because there was no way out, humanly speaking.

419
00:20:09,099 --> 00:20:11,099
You knew that the Egyptians were behind you,

420
00:20:11,099 --> 00:20:13,099
and you knew what was before you,

421
00:20:13,099 --> 00:20:16,099
and you had no way to cross over that Red Sea.

422
00:20:16,099 --> 00:20:18,099
And the Bible says in verse 21

423
00:20:18,099 --> 00:20:21,099
that Moses stretched out his hand over the sea,

424
00:20:21,099 --> 00:20:25,099
and the Lord caused this strong east wind

425
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:28,099
to come all that night, and he divided the waters.

426
00:20:28,099 --> 00:20:31,099
Can you imagine seeing this?

427
00:20:31,099 --> 00:20:33,099
This is miraculous. This is amazing.

428
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:35,099
We think about the deliverance of God,

429
00:20:35,099 --> 00:20:37,099
and we see what God is doing,

430
00:20:37,099 --> 00:20:40,099
and the Bible says in verse 22,

431
00:20:40,099 --> 00:20:42,099
And the children of Israel

432
00:20:42,099 --> 00:20:45,099
went into the midst of the sea

433
00:20:45,099 --> 00:20:48,099
upon the dry ground,

434
00:20:48,099 --> 00:20:50,099
and the waters were a wall unto them

435
00:20:50,099 --> 00:20:53,099
on their right hand and on their left.

436
00:20:53,099 --> 00:20:55,099
I want you to think about this just for a moment.

437
00:20:55,099 --> 00:20:57,099
Joseph, I'm going to come down off the platform here.

438
00:20:57,099 --> 00:20:59,099
They've got to move the camera a little bit.

439
00:20:59,099 --> 00:21:01,099
But I want you to think about this.

440
00:21:01,099 --> 00:21:03,099
If we could pretend this is the Red Sea

441
00:21:03,099 --> 00:21:05,099
where they would cross through.

442
00:21:05,099 --> 00:21:07,099
I want you to think about Moses standing here

443
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,099
and holding up the rod with his arm

444
00:21:09,099 --> 00:21:11,099
and God causing that wind to come

445
00:21:11,099 --> 00:21:13,099
and to part those waters.

446
00:21:13,099 --> 00:21:15,099
And I want you to think about standing here

447
00:21:15,099 --> 00:21:17,099
on this side as one of the children of Israel

448
00:21:17,099 --> 00:21:19,099
and seeing this great power,

449
00:21:19,099 --> 00:21:21,099
this great sight that is before you.

450
00:21:21,099 --> 00:21:23,099
I mean, you've never witnessed

451
00:21:23,099 --> 00:21:25,099
anything like this before.

452
00:21:25,099 --> 00:21:26,099
This is amazing.

453
00:21:26,099 --> 00:21:28,099
I mean, your jaw is on the ground.

454
00:21:28,099 --> 00:21:31,099
You're seeing this great display of God's power.

455
00:21:31,099 --> 00:21:33,099
And Moses says go forward.

456
00:21:33,099 --> 00:21:38,099
Can I tell you there's an element of faith?

457
00:21:38,099 --> 00:21:40,099
There's an element of faith.

458
00:21:40,099 --> 00:21:42,099
Because as I step into that parted sea,

459
00:21:42,099 --> 00:21:44,099
and I'm stepping on dry ground, by the way,

460
00:21:44,099 --> 00:21:47,099
it'd be kind of interesting to feel that ground, wouldn't it?

461
00:21:47,099 --> 00:21:48,599
You step on that dry ground,

462
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:50,099
and you take some more steps,

463
00:21:50,099 --> 00:21:51,099
and guess what?

464
00:21:51,099 --> 00:21:54,099
You have to have faith that God's going to continue

465
00:21:54,099 --> 00:21:57,099
that red sea parted as you cross over.

466
00:21:57,099 --> 00:21:59,099
Each step that you take, listen,

467
00:21:59,099 --> 00:22:03,099
some of them in the front might have tried to run.

468
00:22:03,099 --> 00:22:05,099
I don't know.

469
00:22:05,099 --> 00:22:08,099
But I think about them crossing over and seeing that.

470
00:22:08,099 --> 00:22:13,099
The Bible says the waters were a wall on both sides.

471
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:16,099
Can you imagine?

472
00:22:16,099 --> 00:22:18,099
I'd want to try to touch it.

473
00:22:18,099 --> 00:22:20,099
I don't know that I would,

474
00:22:20,099 --> 00:22:23,099
but it'd probably cross my mind.

475
00:22:23,099 --> 00:22:26,099
It'd be amazing to cross over.

476
00:22:26,099 --> 00:22:30,099
Listen, they're eyewitnesses of God's great power.

477
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:35,099
They're seeing God do what they've never seen before.

478
00:22:35,099 --> 00:22:41,099
Oh, they had the opportunity in Egypt with the plagues.

479
00:22:41,099 --> 00:22:43,099
Some that they saw.

480
00:22:43,099 --> 00:22:46,099
Some, no doubt, that they'd simply heard about.

481
00:22:46,099 --> 00:22:48,099
They knew what was going on.

482
00:22:48,099 --> 00:22:52,099
There was a portion of distance between where Pharaoh was

483
00:22:52,099 --> 00:22:55,099
and Ramses and all of that and all that was going on.

484
00:22:55,099 --> 00:22:57,099
But I want you to understand

485
00:22:57,099 --> 00:23:00,099
that now they're crossing over that red sea.

486
00:23:00,099 --> 00:23:05,099
They're experiencing personally God's great power.

487
00:23:05,099 --> 00:23:08,099
And as they're experiencing personally God's great power,

488
00:23:08,099 --> 00:23:11,099
they're taking one step after the other,

489
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:14,099
and they're crossing over, and they're going.

490
00:23:14,099 --> 00:23:16,099
The Bible says that the children of Israel

491
00:23:16,099 --> 00:23:19,099
went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground,

492
00:23:19,099 --> 00:23:22,099
and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand

493
00:23:22,099 --> 00:23:24,099
and on their left.

494
00:23:24,099 --> 00:23:27,099
Notice if you skip down to verse number 29,

495
00:23:27,099 --> 00:23:29,099
the Bible says this,

496
00:23:38,099 --> 00:23:40,099
Wow.

497
00:23:40,099 --> 00:23:43,099
Again, I know that we're familiar with this portion of Scripture,

498
00:23:43,099 --> 00:23:46,099
but I want you to see how God's demonstrating His power.

499
00:23:46,099 --> 00:23:48,099
And I want you to see how the children of Israel

500
00:23:48,099 --> 00:23:52,099
are eyewitnesses of this great work, of God's great work.

501
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:55,099
And what a blessing it is to be an eyewitness

502
00:23:55,099 --> 00:23:57,099
of what God is doing

503
00:23:57,099 --> 00:24:00,099
and to see how God is able to do

504
00:24:00,099 --> 00:24:03,099
what you could never even imagine.

505
00:24:03,099 --> 00:24:06,099
I don't think there was probably one within the group

506
00:24:06,099 --> 00:24:09,099
that said, you know, I think God can just part the sea

507
00:24:09,099 --> 00:24:11,099
so that we could go over.

508
00:24:13,099 --> 00:24:15,099
But God did it.

509
00:24:15,099 --> 00:24:18,099
God did the impossible.

510
00:24:18,099 --> 00:24:22,099
See, they've never experienced anything like this.

511
00:24:22,099 --> 00:24:26,099
But what a blessing to experience personally

512
00:24:26,099 --> 00:24:31,099
the power of God Almighty.

513
00:24:31,099 --> 00:24:33,099
In verses 23 through 28,

514
00:24:33,099 --> 00:24:37,099
the Bible tells us about the Egyptians.

515
00:24:37,099 --> 00:24:40,099
And by the way, the miraculous work

516
00:24:40,099 --> 00:24:43,099
doesn't cease in verse number 22.

517
00:24:43,099 --> 00:24:45,099
We find that in verse number 23

518
00:24:45,099 --> 00:24:48,099
that the Bible says that the Egyptians pursued

519
00:24:48,099 --> 00:24:50,099
and went in after them to the midst of the sea,

520
00:24:50,099 --> 00:24:54,099
even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.

521
00:24:54,099 --> 00:24:56,099
That's what God said He would do,

522
00:24:56,099 --> 00:24:58,099
that He would, in verse 17 and 18,

523
00:24:58,099 --> 00:25:00,099
that He would harden the hearts of the Egyptians,

524
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:02,099
that they shall follow them.

525
00:25:02,099 --> 00:25:04,099
We find that they come in, they pursued after.

526
00:25:04,099 --> 00:25:06,099
In verse number 24, it says,

527
00:25:06,099 --> 00:25:08,099
and it came to pass that in the morning watch

528
00:25:08,099 --> 00:25:10,099
the Lord looked unto the host of the Egyptians

529
00:25:10,099 --> 00:25:12,099
through the pillar of fire and the cloud

530
00:25:12,099 --> 00:25:14,099
and troubled the host of the Egyptians.

531
00:25:14,099 --> 00:25:16,099
Notice what it says in verse 25,

532
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:19,099
and took off their chariot wheels,

533
00:25:19,099 --> 00:25:21,099
that they drove them heavily.

534
00:25:21,099 --> 00:25:25,099
So the Egyptians said, let us flee from the face of Israel.

535
00:25:25,099 --> 00:25:29,099
Notice this, for the Lord fighteth for them

536
00:25:29,099 --> 00:25:32,099
against the Egyptians.

537
00:25:32,099 --> 00:25:35,099
What did God say there?

538
00:25:35,099 --> 00:25:37,099
Moses said to the people of God in verse number 14,

539
00:25:37,099 --> 00:25:39,099
the Lord shall fight for you

540
00:25:39,099 --> 00:25:41,099
and ye shall hold your peace.

541
00:25:41,099 --> 00:25:45,099
We find here that God, as He sees the Egyptians,

542
00:25:45,099 --> 00:25:48,099
listen, He knew exactly how far to let them get

543
00:25:48,099 --> 00:25:51,099
into the midst of that Red Sea.

544
00:25:51,099 --> 00:25:54,099
He knew the exact distance to let them travel

545
00:25:54,099 --> 00:25:56,099
through the midst of that Red Sea,

546
00:25:56,099 --> 00:25:59,099
and then He caused their chariot wheels,

547
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:01,099
as the Bible says in verse 25,

548
00:26:01,099 --> 00:26:03,099
that He took off their chariot wheels,

549
00:26:03,099 --> 00:26:05,099
that they drove them heavily,

550
00:26:05,099 --> 00:26:07,099
so that the Egyptians said, let us flee.

551
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:09,099
Listen, His timing is perfect.

552
00:26:09,099 --> 00:26:12,099
He knows everything, and He let them get to exactly

553
00:26:12,099 --> 00:26:14,099
where they were supposed to get,

554
00:26:14,099 --> 00:26:16,099
and He had those chariot wheels come off,

555
00:26:16,099 --> 00:26:18,099
and then the Bible says they're going to flee.

556
00:26:18,099 --> 00:26:20,099
Notice in verse number 26,

557
00:26:20,099 --> 00:26:22,099
and the Lord said unto Moses,

558
00:26:22,099 --> 00:26:24,099
Stretch out thine hand over the sea,

559
00:26:24,099 --> 00:26:26,099
that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians,

560
00:26:26,099 --> 00:26:28,099
upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.

561
00:26:28,099 --> 00:26:30,099
And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea,

562
00:26:30,099 --> 00:26:32,099
and the sea returned to its strength.

563
00:26:32,099 --> 00:26:35,099
When the morning appeared, and the Egyptians fled against it,

564
00:26:35,099 --> 00:26:37,099
and the Lord overthrew the Egyptians

565
00:26:37,099 --> 00:26:39,099
in the midst of the sea.

566
00:26:39,099 --> 00:26:41,099
The Bible says that the waters returned

567
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:43,099
and covered the chariots and the horsemen

568
00:26:43,099 --> 00:26:46,099
and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them

569
00:26:46,099 --> 00:26:50,099
that remained not so much as one of them.

570
00:26:50,099 --> 00:26:53,099
Verse 30 says, Thus the Lord saved Israel that day

571
00:26:53,099 --> 00:26:55,099
out of the hand of the Egyptians,

572
00:26:55,099 --> 00:27:01,099
and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the seashore.

573
00:27:01,099 --> 00:27:05,099
This is amazing work that God did.

574
00:27:05,099 --> 00:27:08,099
Not only did God part the Red Sea,

575
00:27:08,099 --> 00:27:11,099
He allowed the Egyptians to pursue after,

576
00:27:11,099 --> 00:27:13,099
and at just the right mark,

577
00:27:13,099 --> 00:27:17,099
at just the right distance into their traveling through,

578
00:27:17,099 --> 00:27:20,099
the Bible says that they got stuck,

579
00:27:20,099 --> 00:27:22,099
their wheels came off, they drove heavily,

580
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:24,099
and then God said to Moses,

581
00:27:24,099 --> 00:27:26,099
Now raise up that rod again,

582
00:27:26,099 --> 00:27:29,099
and we're going to close the sea.

583
00:27:29,099 --> 00:27:33,099
It's amazing, the power of God.

584
00:27:33,099 --> 00:27:38,099
That Red Sea stayed parted because God kept it parted,

585
00:27:38,099 --> 00:27:42,099
and that Red Sea closed up because God caused it to close up.

586
00:27:42,099 --> 00:27:45,099
Listen, don't listen to the scoffers today

587
00:27:45,099 --> 00:27:47,099
that will try to take you to this portion of Scripture

588
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:50,099
and say it wasn't the Red Sea, it was the Reed Sea.

589
00:27:50,099 --> 00:27:51,099
The Bible says it's the Red Sea.

590
00:27:51,099 --> 00:27:53,099
By the way, you study your Bible,

591
00:27:53,099 --> 00:27:56,099
and you'll find that repeatedly through the Scriptures,

592
00:27:56,099 --> 00:27:59,099
the Bible speaks about this event that took place,

593
00:27:59,099 --> 00:28:03,099
and every single time, it's the Red Sea.

594
00:28:03,099 --> 00:28:06,099
Even in the New Testament, as Stephen is preaching,

595
00:28:06,099 --> 00:28:08,099
he preaches about the Red Sea

596
00:28:08,099 --> 00:28:13,099
and what God did here in delivering the people of God

597
00:28:13,099 --> 00:28:15,099
from the Egyptians.

598
00:28:15,099 --> 00:28:17,099
Listen, you must always trust the Word of God.

599
00:28:17,099 --> 00:28:20,099
Do not listen to what the scoffers say.

600
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:24,099
By the way, the scoffers and their attack upon the Word of God

601
00:28:24,099 --> 00:28:26,099
often make themselves look ridiculous,

602
00:28:26,099 --> 00:28:29,099
because I would submit to you that if it were the Reed Sea,

603
00:28:29,099 --> 00:28:31,099
and it is not, it is the Red Sea,

604
00:28:31,099 --> 00:28:33,099
that it would be absolutely amazing

605
00:28:33,099 --> 00:28:35,099
for God and just a few inches of water

606
00:28:35,099 --> 00:28:42,099
to overthrow the entire army of Egypt.

607
00:28:42,099 --> 00:28:45,099
But we find here that it's the Red Sea,

608
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:48,099
and God worked miraculously,

609
00:28:48,099 --> 00:28:51,099
and we find that their deliverance is recorded for us

610
00:28:51,099 --> 00:28:55,099
and how we can rejoice in seeing what God did

611
00:28:55,099 --> 00:28:59,099
and understanding as the children of Israel

612
00:28:59,099 --> 00:29:02,099
had the opportunity to be eyewitnesses

613
00:29:02,099 --> 00:29:04,099
of the power of Almighty God.

614
00:29:04,099 --> 00:29:06,099
It tells us in verse number 31,

615
00:29:06,099 --> 00:29:11,099
and Israel saw that great work which the Lord did

616
00:29:11,099 --> 00:29:13,099
upon the Egyptians.

617
00:29:13,099 --> 00:29:16,099
They saw it, they experienced it,

618
00:29:16,099 --> 00:29:20,099
they understood as eyewitnesses the power of God.

619
00:29:20,099 --> 00:29:22,099
It tells us the impact in verse number 31,

620
00:29:22,099 --> 00:29:25,099
that the people feared the Lord.

621
00:29:25,099 --> 00:29:29,099
By the way, it's a good thing for people to fear God.

622
00:29:29,099 --> 00:29:31,099
Some people today that run around saying,

623
00:29:31,099 --> 00:29:34,099
I don't fear anything or anyone.

624
00:29:34,099 --> 00:29:37,099
I've seen people wearing clothing that says

625
00:29:37,099 --> 00:29:39,099
only God can judge me,

626
00:29:39,099 --> 00:29:42,099
and they wear it boldly as if to say,

627
00:29:42,099 --> 00:29:45,099
make some statement about no one can judge them.

628
00:29:45,099 --> 00:29:49,099
Listen, it's a fearful thing to stand before God Almighty,

629
00:29:49,099 --> 00:29:51,099
the judge of all the earth.

630
00:29:51,099 --> 00:29:53,099
It's a fearful thing.

631
00:29:53,099 --> 00:29:55,099
Our God is to be feared.

632
00:29:55,099 --> 00:29:57,099
He has great power.

633
00:29:57,099 --> 00:30:00,099
By the way, it was a proper thing...

634
00:30:00,099 --> 00:30:06,099
for them to respond in this manner. It says that they feared the Lord, notice this, and believed

635
00:30:06,819 --> 00:30:11,299
the Lord. You know, God wants you to believe Him. He wants us to believe Him.

636
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:16,099
He wants us to trust Him. He wants us to believe that He is able to do

637
00:30:18,659 --> 00:30:23,459
in your situation, in your circumstance, amazing things.

638
00:30:23,459 --> 00:30:35,539
So we continue to think about the impact of this particular event in the nation of Israel.

639
00:30:35,539 --> 00:30:40,339
We'll look at just a few verses in chapter 15, and I want you to notice what the Bible says.

640
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:46,339
This chapter 15, the first 21 verses at least, are dealing with the people singing and rejoicing

641
00:30:46,339 --> 00:30:51,379
and how God had delivered His people and how they're rejoicing. It starts in verse number one

642
00:30:51,379 --> 00:30:57,379
of chapter 15, then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the Lord. Here's what

643
00:30:57,379 --> 00:31:05,059
they said in verse number one, I will sing unto the Lord, for He hath triumphed gloriously. The

644
00:31:05,059 --> 00:31:10,019
horse and his rider hath He thrown into the sea. Do you notice in their song what they recognize?

645
00:31:10,019 --> 00:31:18,179
They recognize that it was God that did the work, for He hath triumphed gloriously. When God works

646
00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:23,619
in your life and in my life, I hope that we give God the credit. I hope that we give God the glory.

647
00:31:23,619 --> 00:31:29,219
I hope that we recognize that it's God that did the work and that we do not try to explain it

648
00:31:29,219 --> 00:31:33,379
through, well, you know, I made this decision and I did this and I had it. No, no, no. We got to give

649
00:31:33,379 --> 00:31:40,979
God the glory. We got to give God the glory. He alone is worthy. We find that they recognize that

650
00:31:40,979 --> 00:31:47,219
it was God who had triumphed gloriously. Notice with me in verse number seven, the Bible says,

651
00:31:47,219 --> 00:31:53,539
And in the greatness of thine excellency, thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee.

652
00:31:53,539 --> 00:32:01,459
Thou sentest forth thy wrath, which consumed them as stubble. You notice there it speaks about the

653
00:32:01,459 --> 00:32:07,139
greatness of thine excellency and the work that God did. You notice in verse number 13, in verse

654
00:32:07,139 --> 00:32:12,499
number 12, it says, Thou stretchest out thy right hand, and the earth swallowed them. Thou in thy

655
00:32:12,499 --> 00:32:19,059
mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast redeemed. Thou hast guided them in thy strength

656
00:32:19,059 --> 00:32:23,459
unto thy holy habitation. Listen, they're singing a different song than they were singing there at

657
00:32:23,459 --> 00:32:29,539
Pi-hahiroth, aren't they? Because they saw God work. They're eyewitnesses of what God did.

658
00:32:30,339 --> 00:32:35,059
They're saying, look at what God did in thy mercy. Understand this morning that our God is

659
00:32:35,859 --> 00:32:42,979
merciful. He's merciful. I'm so thankful this morning to be a recipient of God's great mercy.

660
00:32:43,539 --> 00:32:49,139
The Bible says that thou hast led forth the people which thou hast redeemed. Notice thou

661
00:32:49,139 --> 00:32:54,739
hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation. I'm thankful for the leadership and

662
00:32:54,739 --> 00:33:00,419
guidance that God gives in our lives. Listen, as we faithfully seek the face of God,

663
00:33:00,419 --> 00:33:08,979
we understand that He provides direction for us. They were not singing that same tune when

664
00:33:08,979 --> 00:33:13,619
they were found there at Pi-hahiroth at the beginning of chapter 14, even though it was God

665
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:18,019
that led them. They're saying, Moses, why did you bring us here? You brought us here to die in the

666
00:33:18,019 --> 00:33:23,939
wilderness. But now they're saying God led and God guided them. Notice in verse number 16, Fear and

667
00:33:23,939 --> 00:33:30,099
dread shall fall upon them. By the greatness of thine arm, they shall be as still as a stone.

668
00:33:30,899 --> 00:33:36,259
Till thy people pass over, O Lord, till the people pass over which thou hast purchased.

669
00:33:36,819 --> 00:33:41,219
Let me say this, as we think about the children of Israel, they say this in verse 18, the Lord

670
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:47,059
shall reign forever and ever. And that's true. He's going to reign forever and ever. But I want

671
00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:51,219
you to understand, as we think about the children of Israel in this portion of Scripture, and we see

672
00:33:51,219 --> 00:33:55,539
their dilemma, their distress, we see their deliverance, we see how that they had the

673
00:33:55,539 --> 00:34:02,259
opportunity to be the eyewitnesses of His great power, of God's work here in this portion of

674
00:34:02,259 --> 00:34:08,339
Scripture. And what they were murmuring and complaining, and they were beside themselves,

675
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:12,979
they're saying we should have never left Egypt. It was better for us to serve there in Egypt,

676
00:34:12,979 --> 00:34:18,979
and we're going to die in this wilderness. And now they're singing and they're rejoicing.

677
00:34:19,619 --> 00:34:23,459
Listen, after God works, it's easy for us to rejoice.

678
00:34:25,459 --> 00:34:29,299
But I hope that God would help us to learn a lesson from this portion of Scripture this morning,

679
00:34:30,339 --> 00:34:34,179
that in the midst of the difficulty that we must remember that God is on His throne,

680
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:38,739
that we're faced with that dilemma that we say, I wonder what God's going to do? I wonder how

681
00:34:38,739 --> 00:34:46,099
God's going to work? And we find that just as the children of Israel in this portion of Scripture,

682
00:34:46,099 --> 00:34:54,259
so we too, in our lives, often are prone to forget. We face a difficulty, we have a dilemma

683
00:34:54,259 --> 00:35:00,499
in our lives. God works miraculously. I mean, you're an eyewitness of God's great power. You

684
00:35:00,499 --> 00:35:05,139
see God's work in your life. It's not just that you've read about what God did for someone else,

685
00:35:05,139 --> 00:35:10,259
or you heard someone else in a testimony service give praise to God for how God worked in their

686
00:35:10,259 --> 00:35:16,499
life. No, I'm saying that you personally experienced God's power and God's work in your

687
00:35:16,499 --> 00:35:23,219
life, and you're an eyewitness. And then there's another trial. You ever find in life that just

688
00:35:23,219 --> 00:35:28,659
because you've had victory that, man, that means there's no more trials. No, no, the only time we're

689
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:33,139
going to have no more trials when we get to heaven. Amen? There's coming a day that we're going to get

690
00:35:33,139 --> 00:35:40,019
to heaven, and we're going to have no more trials. Praise the Lord. But until that day,

691
00:35:40,579 --> 00:35:47,139
there'll be trials in our life. And just after they're singing this wonderful song of praise to

692
00:35:47,139 --> 00:35:53,619
God, after they've seen God work as eyewitnesses of God's great work, of God's great power,

693
00:35:53,619 --> 00:35:59,859
the Bible tells us at the end of chapter number 15 of the book of Exodus that they come to a place,

694
00:35:59,859 --> 00:36:04,739
and the Bible says that they come to a place called Marah. If you know anything about Marah,

695
00:36:04,739 --> 00:36:11,059
it's a place that the Bible describes as being a place of bitter water, a place where they could

696
00:36:11,059 --> 00:36:18,579
drink no water. Look at it with me in verse 22. So Moses brought Israel from the Red Sea,

697
00:36:18,579 --> 00:36:23,539
and they went out into the wilderness of Shur, and they went three days in the wilderness and

698
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:29,939
no water. Now let me ask you, does God know that you need water? Absolutely. He made us.

699
00:36:30,579 --> 00:36:36,179
He created us. He knows that we need water. And the Bible tells us, and they went, and they came,

700
00:36:36,179 --> 00:36:41,299
notice in verse 23, and when they came to Marah, they could not drink the waters of Marah. Why?

701
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:45,139
For they were bitter, therefore the name of it was called Marah. And the people,

702
00:36:45,139 --> 00:36:49,379
they got together and they said, let's see what God's going to do. Let's see how God's going to

703
00:36:49,379 --> 00:36:52,179
work. Do you remember what He did in Egypt? Do you remember what He did at the Red Sea? Do you

704
00:36:52,179 --> 00:36:57,459
remember how He parted at the Red Sea? No, they didn't say any of that. They murmured, the Bible

705
00:36:57,459 --> 00:37:02,499
says, against Moses saying, what shall we drink? He cried unto the Lord. The Lord showed him a tree

706
00:37:02,499 --> 00:37:05,939
and he cast it. But the Bible says at the end of verse number 25, notice what the Bible says. I'll

707
00:37:05,939 --> 00:37:10,099
read the entirety of it. And he cried unto the Lord and the Lord showed him a tree, which when

708
00:37:10,099 --> 00:37:14,819
he had cast in the waters, the waters were made sweet. There he made for them a statute and

709
00:37:14,819 --> 00:37:23,379
ordinance and there he proved them. God proves us. You're going to trust Him? You see God work.

710
00:37:24,179 --> 00:37:29,219
They were eyewitnesses of His great work. They got to see God do something

711
00:37:30,419 --> 00:37:38,259
that no one had ever seen before. This group of people in Exodus chapter number 14,

712
00:37:38,259 --> 00:37:43,299
they experienced something that no other group of people have ever experienced.

713
00:37:45,699 --> 00:37:51,299
The Jordan River is a different situation. You can read it in the book of Joshua.

714
00:37:51,299 --> 00:37:57,379
But this circumstance here in Exodus chapter number 14, only this group of people experienced

715
00:37:57,379 --> 00:38:06,579
this personally. And though they experienced some great, mighty work of God, they come to the next

716
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:16,659
trial and they murmur. They forget what God is able to do. I hope that it would not be the case

717
00:38:16,659 --> 00:38:23,859
for you or for me. I hope that as God allows us to be eyewitnesses of His great power, as God would

718
00:38:23,859 --> 00:38:29,779
allow us to see His great work in our lives, that when we face those next times of difficulty,

719
00:38:29,779 --> 00:38:35,619
when we have that next trial and that next test, that we would have great excitement and enthusiasm

720
00:38:35,619 --> 00:38:42,179
about what is God going to do? How is God going to work? Because we get to see what God is able to

721
00:38:42,179 --> 00:38:48,979
do. Listen, it's exciting to see God work. It really is. But many times, you know what has to

722
00:38:48,979 --> 00:38:56,339
happen before you see God work? A dilemma, a problem, a difficulty. You know how most of us

723
00:38:56,339 --> 00:39:03,779
deal with difficulties? We don't like them. We try to avoid them at all costs, right? But we see that

724
00:39:03,779 --> 00:39:08,339
God leads us. And at times, as God is leading us, He is leading us directly into a place

725
00:39:08,339 --> 00:39:12,979
where He's going to prove His great power. He's going to show you His work. Turn to the

726
00:39:12,979 --> 00:39:18,739
book of Psalms, if you will. We'll finish with this in Psalm 119. In Psalm 119,

727
00:39:19,699 --> 00:39:34,899
there's a verse of Scripture here that I want to close our service with this morning. I hope that

728
00:39:34,899 --> 00:39:42,339
it would be a verse that would be a prayer of each of ours this morning and this week. In Psalm 119,

729
00:39:42,339 --> 00:39:54,979
in verse number 126, the Bible says this, it is time for thee, Lord, to work.

730
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:59,940
For they have made void thy law.

731
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:06,560
No doubt, we live in the midst of a place where they've made void the law of God.

732
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,540
We understand that.

733
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:17,820
But I want you to see that statement to begin the verse, it is time for Thee, Lord, to work.

734
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:23,100
I wonder this morning, how many of us are anxious to see God work?

735
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:29,940
I mean desiring to see God do something, that we would surrender and yield our lives to

736
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:32,380
God and say, God, I just want to see you work.

737
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:33,380
I want to see you.

738
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:34,660
Listen, it's all for God's glory.

739
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:35,900
It's not for my glory.

740
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:36,900
It's not for your glory.

741
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,460
It's all for His glory.

742
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:42,620
And we would be careful, even as they sang the praise, to understand that the Lord, it

743
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:46,720
is He that hath worked gloriously, triumphed gloriously.

744
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:51,460
And we find this morning that we would pray and say, God, it's time, Lord, for Thee to

745
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:52,460
work.

746
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:57,660
We long to see you work in our lives personally, in our church, corporately, in our nation.

747
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:00,740
We long, God, to see you work.

748
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:01,740
God is able.

749
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:09,940
The children of Israel faced a great difficulty, but God wasn't concerned for one moment.

750
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:16,700
For God knew that He led them exactly to that place, and He was going to show His great

751
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:18,360
power.

752
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:22,620
And they were eyewitnesses of His great work.

753
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:32,139
This morning, I enjoy reading about, I enjoy listening to people give testimony about what

754
00:41:32,139 --> 00:41:35,600
God has done.

755
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:39,300
But the most exciting is seeing God work personally.

756
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:46,860
And I want to be an eyewitness of God's great work in my life, in your life, in our lives

757
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:47,860
corporately.

758
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:54,420
Let's see what God will do as we yield and surrender to Him, that we would give God the

759
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:57,420
glory for He is worthy of it.

760
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:58,420
Let's pray together.

761
00:41:58,420 --> 00:41:59,420
Father, we love You.

762
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:02,139
How we thank You for loving us.

763
00:42:02,139 --> 00:42:07,020
We thank You this morning for this record that's given to us in Exodus 14.

764
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:12,500
Many of us this morning are familiar with this portion of Scripture.

765
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:18,160
No doubt within a group this size, there are some that would say, that's my favorite account

766
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,619
of all of God's Word.

767
00:42:19,619 --> 00:42:22,220
I love that passage of Scripture.

768
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:33,540
God, I pray this morning, as we've had the opportunity to go through and to learn from

769
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:40,820
this portion of Scripture, God, You would help us to have that longing of the psalmist.

770
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:47,180
It is time for Thee, Lord, to work, that we would be eyewitnesses, just as the children

771
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:52,619
of Israel here in Exodus 14, that we be eyewitnesses of Your great work.

772
00:42:52,619 --> 00:42:58,180
I pray, God, that this morning You would help Your people.

773
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:03,580
No doubt there's some that are dealing with some difficulties, some dilemmas, some situations

774
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:11,020
that from a human perspective seem to be no way out, no path forward.

775
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:20,860
I'm so thankful that in those circumstances, in those situations, You love to prove Your

776
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:23,779
power.

777
00:43:23,779 --> 00:43:29,139
I pray, God, that You would work and move in hearts and lives as only You can.

778
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:31,699
There's someone this morning that's not sure of heaven.

779
00:43:31,699 --> 00:43:35,660
I pray that today, Lord, they'd understand their need for Christ.

780
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:38,260
Give us an opportunity to take a Bible and show them how they could know for sure that

781
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:41,380
heaven is their home.

782
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:45,180
We pray that in these few moments of invitation that You'd have Your will and way.

783
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:48,419
We'll thank You for each decision that will be made, for it's in Christ's name we pray.

784
00:43:48,419 --> 00:43:49,419
Would You stand with me?

785
00:43:49,419 --> 00:43:53,419
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

786
00:43:53,419 --> 00:43:55,820
He's going to play quietly on the piano this morning.
