00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400
chapter 14 this morning, Exodus chapter 14,

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.960
be looking at verses 1 through 31.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.400
It's a lengthy passage of scripture.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.840
I will not read the entirety of it

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.159
as we begin here this morning,

00:00:11.159 --> 00:00:13.159
but let me read just a few verses for you.

00:00:13.159 --> 00:00:15.640
Begin with me in verse number one of Exodus 14.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:16.479
The Bible says this,

00:00:16.479 --> 00:00:20.079
"'And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:22.219
"'Speak unto the children of Israel,

00:00:22.219 --> 00:00:26.280
"'that they turn and encamp before Pi-hahiroth,

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:28.819
"'between Migdal and the sea,

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:31.040
"'over against Baal-zephon,

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.799
"'before it shall ye encamp by the sea.'"

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:37.040
Notice in verse number 31,

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.880
the Bible says,

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.419
"'And Israel saw that great work

00:00:40.419 --> 00:00:43.939
"'which the Lord did upon the Egyptians.

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:46.680
"'The people feared the Lord and believed the Lord

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.520
"'and His servant Moses.'"

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.479
The children of Israel had left Egypt

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:53.319
and God led them,

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:56.240
as we look at the text of scripture this morning,

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.880
to Pi-hahiroth, between Migdal and the sea,

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.599
over against Baal-zephon.

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:03.400
We read that in verse number two,

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.160
and we find that it would be in this place

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.400
where God would instruct His people to set up their camp,

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.480
but it would also be here at this place.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.480
As they had the sea before them,

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.519
and as we read through the text of scripture here

00:01:15.519 --> 00:01:16.339
in just a little while,

00:01:16.339 --> 00:01:18.919
the Egyptians in hot pursuit behind them,

00:01:18.919 --> 00:01:20.559
we find that it would be in this place,

00:01:20.559 --> 00:01:22.360
in this text of scripture,

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.599
where the children of Israel would be eyewitnesses

00:01:25.599 --> 00:01:27.839
of God's great work.

00:01:27.839 --> 00:01:30.199
It's amazing to me, and it's encouraging to me,

00:01:30.199 --> 00:01:32.160
it's exciting to me,

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.319
to be able to hear people give testimony

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:38.459
of how God is working in their lives.

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:41.739
It's exciting to hear folks give testimony

00:01:41.739 --> 00:01:44.419
of what God has done in their lives,

00:01:44.419 --> 00:01:47.400
and man, those are encouraging times and exciting times.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.339
In fact, the Bible says,

00:01:48.339 --> 00:01:50.959
"'Let the redeemed of the Lord say so.'"

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:55.400
We're to let our mouths open and give praise unto our God,

00:01:56.239 --> 00:01:58.199
and it's encouraging, it's exciting to hear

00:01:58.199 --> 00:02:02.080
what God is doing in the lives of His people.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.519
I would say this, this morning,

00:02:03.519 --> 00:02:07.760
it's exciting, encouraging to be able to read the accounts

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.440
of what God has done in the lives of His people.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.440
You read through the Bible, it's encouraging,

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.839
it's exciting to read what God has done

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:18.839
for these, His people.

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:20.440
It's exciting to read books

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.199
of those that have gone on before us

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:24.419
that have written out testimonies

00:02:24.419 --> 00:02:28.720
of what God has done in and through their lives.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.440
A pastor friend gave me a book a couple of months ago,

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.759
and he said, have you ever read this book?

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:35.320
And I said, no, I've not read that book,

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.839
I've not heard of that book before,

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:38.039
and he gave me the book,

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:40.500
and I began reading it this past week,

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.479
and I typically, I have a reading schedule

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:44.639
that I'm going through in books,

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:45.979
and I kinda, somebody gives me a book,

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:47.039
and I put it on the list,

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:49.039
and I'll finish the books that I'm reading,

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:50.440
or maybe whatever the next one is,

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.960
and I got to this book this week,

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.119
and began reading, and it was a man that really,

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:57.479
he's just giving the testimony

00:02:57.479 --> 00:03:00.960
of what God did in and through his life.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.559
They're short chapters,

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:05.279
but man, it's encouraging to hear

00:03:05.279 --> 00:03:09.479
how a servant of the Lord surrendered his life to God,

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:11.500
and God used him.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.960
But I'll say this,

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.160
what's most exciting is when you have front row seats,

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.259
and you get to see God work,

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:23.199
and you're an eyewitness of God's great work.

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:24.779
Oh, it's good to hear

00:03:24.779 --> 00:03:26.220
about what God's doing in your life,

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.199
and how God's working.

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:29.839
It's exciting to read of what God has done,

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:32.580
and what God is doing in the lives of other people,

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:33.419
but I'll tell you,

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:37.339
when you have the opportunity and the privilege

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:40.580
to see God work in your own life,

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.600
and to have those front row seats,

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.259
and I've titled the message Eyewitnesses of His Great Work,

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:51.179
because there's nothing like seeing God work personally.

00:03:51.179 --> 00:03:52.520
Oh, it's exciting to read it.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.979
It's exciting to hear about it,

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:58.899
but oh, how we long to see God work in our own lives.

00:03:58.899 --> 00:04:00.460
By the way, God's still working.

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:01.539
God's still on His throne.

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:03.580
God's still able to do exceeding abundantly

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.179
above all that we ask or think.

00:04:05.179 --> 00:04:06.940
Listen, God's still in control.

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.179
He still rules, and He reigns,

00:04:09.179 --> 00:04:11.759
and we can rejoice in all of that wonderful truth

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:13.580
that God gives us in His word,

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:16.779
and we find that God is still working today.

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:18.500
As we look at this portion of scripture,

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:19.739
if you're taking notes this morning,

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.339
I want you to notice with me, first of all, the dilemma.

00:04:23.339 --> 00:04:24.500
In verses one through nine,

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.660
we find that God provides for us a record,

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.459
and I use the phrase the dilemma,

00:04:29.459 --> 00:04:32.500
because this would be really the perspective

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.059
of the people of God, the children of Israel,

00:04:35.059 --> 00:04:38.359
and they obviously thought from a human perspective,

00:04:38.359 --> 00:04:42.220
humanly speaking, there was absolutely no way out.

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.679
We find, as we've read already in the first two verses,

00:04:44.679 --> 00:04:47.220
where they are, and notice in verse number three,

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.540
the Bible says, for Pharaoh will say

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.200
of the children of Israel, they are entangled in the land,

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.980
the wilderness hath shut them in.

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.059
It says in verse number four,

00:04:57.059 --> 00:04:58.739
and I will harden Pharaoh's heart

00:04:58.739 --> 00:05:00.899
that he shall follow after them,

00:05:00.899 --> 00:05:04.299
and I will be honored upon Pharaoh and upon all his host

00:05:04.299 --> 00:05:07.140
that the Egyptians may know that I am the Lord,

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.100
and they did so.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.660
And it was told the king of Egypt

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.459
that the people fled, and the heart of Pharaoh

00:05:12.459 --> 00:05:15.299
and of his servants was turned against the people,

00:05:15.299 --> 00:05:17.739
and they said, why have we done this,

00:05:17.739 --> 00:05:20.380
that we have let Israel go from serving us?

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:23.000
The simple answer is all those 10 plagues,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.059
and we dealt with that last week,

00:05:25.059 --> 00:05:28.859
how that in Egypt, God made his greatness known,

00:05:28.859 --> 00:05:30.820
and we looked at the portion of scripture,

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.660
and we understood those ways

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.820
in which God made his greatness known,

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.859
not only to the Egyptians,

00:05:37.859 --> 00:05:39.380
but also to the children of Israel,

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.260
but we noticed the Bible says in verse number six,

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:42.899
and he made ready his chariot,

00:05:42.899 --> 00:05:44.100
and took his people with him,

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.859
and he took 600 chosen chariots,

00:05:45.859 --> 00:05:47.500
and all the chariots of Egypt,

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.820
and captains over every one of them.

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.059
The Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh, king of Egypt,

00:05:52.059 --> 00:05:54.540
and he pursued after the children of Israel.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.779
The children of Israel went out with a high hand,

00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:59.179
but the Egyptians pursued after them,

00:05:59.179 --> 00:06:01.260
all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh,

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:02.859
and his horsemen and his army,

00:06:02.859 --> 00:06:06.660
and overtook them in camping by the sea beside Pi-hahiroth,

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.739
which before Bel-Zephon.

00:06:10.739 --> 00:06:11.739
I want you to understand that

00:06:11.739 --> 00:06:13.420
as we look at this dilemma here,

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:15.339
that the children of Israel would be facing,

00:06:15.339 --> 00:06:17.820
it's important for us to recognize this morning

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.940
that they were in the place where God led them.

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.820
They're in the place where God led them.

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:26.220
We find that God spoke that in verse number two to Moses

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:27.779
with regard to the place of the camp,

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:30.220
but if you were to back up into chapter number 13,

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.779
and notice in verse number 17 specifically,

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:33.899
we won't read the entirety,

00:06:33.899 --> 00:06:36.459
but you could read down through the end of the chapter,

00:06:36.459 --> 00:06:38.980
but notice in Exodus 13 and verse 17,

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.540
the Bible says, and it came to pass

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:42.500
when Pharaoh had let the people go,

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:43.420
notice these words,

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:48.260
they're important words that God led them,

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:49.820
that God led them.

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:52.980
Moses was the human leader for the nation of Israel,

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:55.179
God had put him in that place,

00:06:55.179 --> 00:06:59.420
but we understand and we see very plainly in the scriptures

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:02.339
that it was God that led them.

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:03.739
It's important for us to understand

00:07:03.739 --> 00:07:05.739
and recognize that truth this morning,

00:07:05.739 --> 00:07:07.500
and it says that God led them, notice,

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.100
not through the way of the land of the Philistines,

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.100
although that was near.

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:15.459
For God said, lest peradventure the people repent

00:07:15.459 --> 00:07:18.059
when they see war and they return to God,

00:07:18.059 --> 00:07:20.339
but God led the people about

00:07:20.339 --> 00:07:22.700
through the way of the wilderness of the Red Sea,

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:23.980
and the children of Israel went up

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:27.660
harnessed out of the land of Egypt.

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:30.260
And so we find that God led the people, notice,

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:34.820
it says that he led them not in a certain way.

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:37.059
By the way, it could be argued, as you see here,

00:07:37.059 --> 00:07:39.179
that it says, although that was near,

00:07:39.179 --> 00:07:41.820
that it would have been a closer route.

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:44.940
Some kid told me years ago, I said, man, how was the trip?

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:46.500
He said, we took the long cut.

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.619
I'd never heard anyone say that before,

00:07:48.619 --> 00:07:52.540
and they were really making an insult against the driving

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:55.019
of the fact that they didn't take a shortcut,

00:07:55.019 --> 00:07:56.739
but we find that God led them.

00:07:56.739 --> 00:07:58.619
Listen, I'm sure that within the congregation

00:07:58.619 --> 00:07:59.820
of the nation of Israel,

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:02.179
that there were some that said, why don't we go this way?

00:08:02.179 --> 00:08:04.459
Moses, the reason why we're not going that way

00:08:04.459 --> 00:08:07.980
is because Moses isn't leading, it's God that's leading.

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:10.500
We find that God led them to the exact place

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:11.980
where he wanted them to be,

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:13.940
and we find that as God would lead them,

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:16.019
that they find themselves in this position.

00:08:16.019 --> 00:08:18.059
We find that as we've read the text of scripture

00:08:18.059 --> 00:08:21.299
in verses five through nine, that God records for us

00:08:21.299 --> 00:08:24.540
the way in which the Egyptians would pursue

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:25.940
the children of Israel.

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:30.179
Their thought would be that they were entangled in the land,

00:08:30.179 --> 00:08:32.140
that the wilderness hath shut them in,

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:34.419
according to verse number three.

00:08:35.179 --> 00:08:38.739
Humanly speaking, it seems like there's no way out.

00:08:38.739 --> 00:08:40.260
Maybe you've been in a position like that

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:41.099
before in your life.

00:08:41.099 --> 00:08:43.500
Maybe you would say, not publicly,

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:44.900
but maybe in your heart this morning,

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:47.900
you'd say, you know, I'm in a position like that right now.

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.820
But humanly speaking, it seems like there's no way out.

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:54.340
I'm facing a dilemma in my life, I'm facing a difficulty,

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:56.299
and it seems as if there's no way out.

00:08:56.299 --> 00:08:58.099
Listen, do not doubt God.

00:08:58.099 --> 00:08:59.940
Someone said this, a preacher of yesteryear,

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:03.140
never put a question where God's put a period.

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:05.380
And the reality is that there are times in our life

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:08.979
that God will lead us, and we follow the leadership of God

00:09:08.979 --> 00:09:11.900
in our lives, and it might take us directly to a place

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:15.659
where it seems like there's no way out.

00:09:15.659 --> 00:09:18.299
But God, but God.

00:09:18.299 --> 00:09:21.940
I'm so thankful that we have a God of the impossible.

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:23.739
I'm so thankful that we have a God,

00:09:23.739 --> 00:09:28.739
in fact, it's how appropriate the bulletin this morning,

00:09:28.859 --> 00:09:33.859
Luke 137, for with God nothing shall be impossible.

00:09:34.539 --> 00:09:37.859
I don't pick the bulletins, but what a blessing.

00:09:37.859 --> 00:09:40.859
This was the next one in line, we order them quarterly.

00:09:40.859 --> 00:09:42.460
And what a blessing, listen,

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:45.619
we serve the God of the impossible.

00:09:45.619 --> 00:09:48.099
And humanly speaking, sometimes we just look at things

00:09:48.099 --> 00:09:50.979
on the human plane, we look at it from our own perspective.

00:09:50.979 --> 00:09:53.859
If you're like me, at times you face a situation,

00:09:53.859 --> 00:09:55.820
you wanna roll your sleeves up and get to work,

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:57.539
and let's figure this thing out.

00:09:57.539 --> 00:09:59.940
And sometimes it's difficult for us to.

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:03.640
But stand back and let God work.

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:04.720
The dilemma.

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:08.820
I want you to notice that their dilemma, as we continue reading through the text of Scripture

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:12.660
beginning in verse number 10, number two, their distress.

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:14.660
Their distress.

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:21.660
Unfortunately, the children of Israel forgot some of what they had just seen in Egypt.

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:29.220
In fact, they'd saw the power of God on display as we mentioned with the plagues and all that

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:35.900
took place and God demonstrating His greatness and those plagues that affected all, both

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:38.020
the Egyptians and the children of Israel.

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:43.120
But then, as we would note and as we looked at last week, how there were a series of plagues

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.820
that only affected the Egyptians.

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:50.660
They did not affect the children of Israel and God was showing, He was making that distinction.

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:55.460
He was making His power, His greatness known to His people.

00:10:55.460 --> 00:11:01.380
We said this last week, we ended the service by saying that God always has a purpose and

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:06.020
that God was making His greatness known so that we would know it personally, so that

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:10.779
we would praise Him accordingly, and so that we would trust Him fully.

00:11:10.779 --> 00:11:12.139
You know what's very interesting to me?

00:11:12.139 --> 00:11:18.700
There are times in which God will lead us directly into a place to see if we'll trust Him.

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:24.139
To see if what we say is really how we live.

00:11:24.139 --> 00:11:27.340
It's easy to talk.

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:29.900
It's another thing to live the walk.

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:36.180
And we find that the children of Israel, their dilemma is followed by their distress.

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:41.260
Notice their perspective as it is revealed to us in verses 10, 11, and 12.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:46.060
The Bible says in verse number 10, and when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:51.060
lifted up their eyes and behold, the Egyptians marched after them.

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:54.380
The Bible tells us they were sore afraid.

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:57.220
The children of Israel cried out unto the Lord.

00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:59.580
But notice what they say as they cry out.

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:04.980
They said unto Moses, because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:07.180
die in the wilderness?

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:13.500
Wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us to carry us forth out of Egypt?

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:19.820
Their perspective, they were going to be controlled by fear.

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:25.900
As you look at this text of Scripture, it shows us in verse number 12, notice it says,

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:30.180
is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying let us alone that we may

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:32.260
serve the Egyptians?

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.460
They were regretting the fact that they even left Egypt.

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:43.300
So there are times in which we begin to face a difficulty in life, a dilemma, and then

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:47.380
we start retracing our steps and we can regret some things.

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:51.260
And they respond with fear, they're being controlled by fear.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:55.220
They regret leaving Egypt, they believe that death was certain.

00:12:55.220 --> 00:13:00.419
They say in verse number 11 that you've taken us, there's not enough graves in Egypt, that's

00:13:00.419 --> 00:13:02.460
why you brought us here to die in the wilderness.

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:07.900
Notice at the end of verse number 12, for it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:12.100
than that we should die in the wilderness.

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:17.339
Now several weeks ago, we looked at a portion of Scripture in Horeb, God made His greatness.

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:22.180
And we looked in that portion of Scripture to start in the life of Moses, because Moses

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:27.820
made that declaration that God hath begun to reveal His greatness to him.

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:32.820
And we looked at how that started in Horeb, and if you remember with me back to that portion

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:40.339
of Scripture, you find that it was there that God revealed to Moses that He heard the cries

00:13:40.339 --> 00:13:41.900
of His people.

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:43.059
And what was their cry?

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:48.339
Well, they weren't loving Egypt.

00:13:48.339 --> 00:13:50.820
They were overworked.

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:53.100
They had a rough time.

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:58.260
They were crying out for deliverance, and now after they've been delivered, after they're

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:03.380
facing this dilemma, notice what they say, that it had been better for us to serve the

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:04.380
Egyptians.

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:12.300
Oh, they're beginning to doubt, they're beginning to doubt how God had led them in what God

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:13.900
was doing.

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:17.779
Their distress is evident to us as we note their perspective.

00:14:17.779 --> 00:14:22.660
But I'm so thankful that as we see their perspective that we find in the next several verses here

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:27.299
in Exodus chapter number 14, we see God's promises.

00:14:27.299 --> 00:14:31.700
I'm so thankful for the promises of God, aren't you?

00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:36.459
You think about the promises we sing about, standing on the promises, we find about Peter

00:14:36.459 --> 00:14:41.660
saying that God has given us exceeding great and precious promises.

00:14:42.019 --> 00:14:44.899
I'm so thankful for the promises of God's Word.

00:14:44.899 --> 00:14:50.380
And here as we note the perspective of the people of God, we find that God is going to

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:54.940
give some promises in verse number 13, and Moses said unto the people, fear ye not, stand

00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:59.260
still and see the salvation of the Lord which He will show to you today.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:03.459
For the Egyptians whom ye have seen today, ye shall see them again no more forever.

00:15:03.459 --> 00:15:07.700
Notice the Bible says the Lord shall fight for you and ye shall hold your place.

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:11.660
The Lord said unto Moses, wherefore cryest thou unto me, speak unto the children of Israel

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:12.660
that they go forward.

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:17.339
I want you to think about that simple phrase at the end of verse number 15, that they go

00:15:17.339 --> 00:15:18.339
forward.

00:15:18.339 --> 00:15:20.299
Humanly speaking, it's impossible.

00:15:20.299 --> 00:15:21.580
What is before them?

00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:22.580
The Red Sea.

00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:25.580
How are we going to go forward?

00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:27.420
The Red Sea.

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:29.459
How are we going to do that?

00:15:29.459 --> 00:15:34.179
Notice as we continue and consider the promises of God in verse number 16, the Bible says,

00:15:34.179 --> 00:15:36.459
but lift thou up thy rod.

00:15:36.459 --> 00:15:37.459
Remember that rod?

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:42.660
Remember when Moses in Horeb, he says, they're not going to believe me.

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:49.540
God told him, I am, hath sent thee unto them, and he then asked him, he said, Moses, what's

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:50.540
in your hand?

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:51.540
His rod.

00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:52.540
His rod.

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:58.500
And here we find he says, but lift thou up thy rod and stretch out thine hand over the

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:05.940
sea and divide it, and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:07.619
the sea.

00:16:07.619 --> 00:16:08.619
That's amazing.

00:16:08.619 --> 00:16:14.540
Listen, I understand that Exodus 14 is a familiar passage of scripture, but that's amazing.

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:16.059
It's absolutely phenomenal.

00:16:16.059 --> 00:16:18.619
Listen, they'd not seen anything like this before.

00:16:18.619 --> 00:16:21.179
They'd never experienced anything like this before.

00:16:21.179 --> 00:16:24.220
God says, go forward, and here's what I'm going to do, I'm going to make a path for

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:25.220
you.

00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:27.019
I'm going to provide a way.

00:16:27.019 --> 00:16:31.059
He says, Moses, take that rod, lift it up, stretch out thine hand over the sea and divide

00:16:31.059 --> 00:16:32.059
it.

00:16:32.059 --> 00:16:35.059
Understand with me this morning that it was God that divided the Red Sea.

00:16:35.179 --> 00:16:37.260
It was not Moses that divided the Red Sea.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:43.380
Yes, God used him and he had to do what God told him to do, but it was God Almighty that

00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:45.179
parted that Red Sea.

00:16:45.179 --> 00:16:50.540
And God said this, that you would go over on dry ground.

00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:54.739
That's amazing to me because reality would tell you that if you part some waters that

00:16:54.739 --> 00:17:01.660
had just been flowing, they're going to be mucky and muddy and difficult to travel over.

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:02.739
Correct?

00:17:03.019 --> 00:17:07.019
God said, I'm going to make it dry.

00:17:07.019 --> 00:17:08.420
God is able.

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:09.420
He's able.

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:15.980
We find that the Bible says in verse number 17, and behold, and I, behold, I will harden

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:18.580
the hearts of the Egyptians and they shall follow them.

00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:22.059
And I will get me honor upon Pharaoh and upon all his hosts, upon his chariots and upon

00:17:22.059 --> 00:17:23.339
his horsemen.

00:17:23.339 --> 00:17:26.820
And the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord when I have gotten me honor upon Pharaoh,

00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:29.260
upon his chariots and upon his horsemen.

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:31.940
The angel of God, we'll get to verse 19 in just a moment.

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:36.339
But listen, what it tells us in verse 17 and 18 about the Egyptians following, I'd understand

00:17:36.339 --> 00:17:38.339
why they would want to follow.

00:17:38.339 --> 00:17:41.660
If you just watched the whole congregation of the children of Israel cross over on dry

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:45.179
ground and the whole reason that you left Egypt to come to where you did in the first

00:17:45.179 --> 00:17:50.380
place was to kill them and to conquer them, you'd follow after them as well.

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:51.860
You just watched them walk over there.

00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:54.019
You said, well, we're going to go also.

00:17:54.019 --> 00:17:56.619
But notice what the Bible says in verse number 19.

00:17:56.619 --> 00:17:57.619
This is amazing.

00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:03.179
As we begin to see the deliverance of God, even in verses 19 and 20, we see his great

00:18:03.179 --> 00:18:04.179
power.

00:18:04.179 --> 00:18:07.739
The Bible says, and the angel of God which went before the camp of Israel removed and

00:18:07.739 --> 00:18:09.380
went behind them.

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:13.779
The pillar of the cloud went from before their face and stood behind them.

00:18:13.779 --> 00:18:15.700
Who was behind them?

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:17.140
The Egyptians.

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:18.619
The sea is before them.

00:18:18.619 --> 00:18:20.580
The Egyptians are behind them.

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:25.500
The Bible says in verse number 20, and it came between the camp of the Egyptians, the

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:26.500
camp of Israel.

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:29.380
There's a cloud and darkness to them.

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:30.380
Who's them?

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:31.380
That's the Egyptians.

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:35.059
The Bible says, but it gave light by night to these.

00:18:35.059 --> 00:18:36.580
These are the children of Israel.

00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:40.460
So the one came not near the other all the night.

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:42.020
Isn't that amazing?

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:45.700
Honestly, I think that as many times I've read through the passage of scriptures, many

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:50.739
times I've looked at this portion, and I love the account of the crossing of the Red Sea,

00:18:50.739 --> 00:18:56.220
that oftentimes we skim over verses 19 and 20, but that's miraculous as well.

00:18:56.940 --> 00:19:00.979
How that God set that difference, how that He came between them.

00:19:00.979 --> 00:19:05.260
And we find that for one, it was darkness for the Egyptians, but for the children of

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:07.059
Israel, it was light for them.

00:19:07.059 --> 00:19:12.059
And it says so that the one came not near the other all the night.

00:19:12.059 --> 00:19:14.979
Listen, our God is able.

00:19:14.979 --> 00:19:16.340
Our God is able.

00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:17.700
We see the dilemma.

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:21.700
We see their distress, but I want you to notice with me their deliverance.

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:22.700
Their deliverance.

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:26.539
And it begins in verse 19, as we've just read about that distinction that God did in

00:19:26.539 --> 00:19:28.580
demonstrating His power.

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:32.580
But notice with me as we continue reading in verse number 21, and I want you to see

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:34.659
what they saw.

00:19:34.659 --> 00:19:36.179
I want you to read verse 21.

00:19:36.179 --> 00:19:42.900
It says, and Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the Lord caused the sea

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:50.900
to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and the

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:55.700
waters were divided.

00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:58.539
Could you imagine seeing that?

00:19:58.539 --> 00:20:00.099
You knew what was right in front of you.

00:20:00.099 --> 00:20:02.099
You knew it was the Red Sea.

00:20:02.099 --> 00:20:04.099
You knew there was a big body of water.

00:20:04.099 --> 00:20:06.099
The reason that you were in distress

00:20:06.099 --> 00:20:09.099
is because there was no way out, humanly speaking.

00:20:09.099 --> 00:20:11.099
You knew that the Egyptians were behind you,

00:20:11.099 --> 00:20:13.099
and you knew what was before you,

00:20:13.099 --> 00:20:16.099
and you had no way to cross over that Red Sea.

00:20:16.099 --> 00:20:18.099
And the Bible says in verse 21

00:20:18.099 --> 00:20:21.099
that Moses stretched out his hand over the sea,

00:20:21.099 --> 00:20:25.099
and the Lord caused this strong east wind

00:20:25.099 --> 00:20:28.099
to come all that night, and he divided the waters.

00:20:28.099 --> 00:20:31.099
Can you imagine seeing this?

00:20:31.099 --> 00:20:33.099
This is miraculous. This is amazing.

00:20:33.099 --> 00:20:35.099
We think about the deliverance of God,

00:20:35.099 --> 00:20:37.099
and we see what God is doing,

00:20:37.099 --> 00:20:40.099
and the Bible says in verse 22,

00:20:40.099 --> 00:20:42.099
And the children of Israel

00:20:42.099 --> 00:20:45.099
went into the midst of the sea

00:20:45.099 --> 00:20:48.099
upon the dry ground,

00:20:48.099 --> 00:20:50.099
and the waters were a wall unto them

00:20:50.099 --> 00:20:53.099
on their right hand and on their left.

00:20:53.099 --> 00:20:55.099
I want you to think about this just for a moment.

00:20:55.099 --> 00:20:57.099
Joseph, I'm going to come down off the platform here.

00:20:57.099 --> 00:20:59.099
They've got to move the camera a little bit.

00:20:59.099 --> 00:21:01.099
But I want you to think about this.

00:21:01.099 --> 00:21:03.099
If we could pretend this is the Red Sea

00:21:03.099 --> 00:21:05.099
where they would cross through.

00:21:05.099 --> 00:21:07.099
I want you to think about Moses standing here

00:21:07.099 --> 00:21:09.099
and holding up the rod with his arm

00:21:09.099 --> 00:21:11.099
and God causing that wind to come

00:21:11.099 --> 00:21:13.099
and to part those waters.

00:21:13.099 --> 00:21:15.099
And I want you to think about standing here

00:21:15.099 --> 00:21:17.099
on this side as one of the children of Israel

00:21:17.099 --> 00:21:19.099
and seeing this great power,

00:21:19.099 --> 00:21:21.099
this great sight that is before you.

00:21:21.099 --> 00:21:23.099
I mean, you've never witnessed

00:21:23.099 --> 00:21:25.099
anything like this before.

00:21:25.099 --> 00:21:26.099
This is amazing.

00:21:26.099 --> 00:21:28.099
I mean, your jaw is on the ground.

00:21:28.099 --> 00:21:31.099
You're seeing this great display of God's power.

00:21:31.099 --> 00:21:33.099
And Moses says go forward.

00:21:33.099 --> 00:21:38.099
Can I tell you there's an element of faith?

00:21:38.099 --> 00:21:40.099
There's an element of faith.

00:21:40.099 --> 00:21:42.099
Because as I step into that parted sea,

00:21:42.099 --> 00:21:44.099
and I'm stepping on dry ground, by the way,

00:21:44.099 --> 00:21:47.099
it'd be kind of interesting to feel that ground, wouldn't it?

00:21:47.099 --> 00:21:48.599
You step on that dry ground,

00:21:48.599 --> 00:21:50.099
and you take some more steps,

00:21:50.099 --> 00:21:51.099
and guess what?

00:21:51.099 --> 00:21:54.099
You have to have faith that God's going to continue

00:21:54.099 --> 00:21:57.099
that red sea parted as you cross over.

00:21:57.099 --> 00:21:59.099
Each step that you take, listen,

00:21:59.099 --> 00:22:03.099
some of them in the front might have tried to run.

00:22:03.099 --> 00:22:05.099
I don't know.

00:22:05.099 --> 00:22:08.099
But I think about them crossing over and seeing that.

00:22:08.099 --> 00:22:13.099
The Bible says the waters were a wall on both sides.

00:22:13.099 --> 00:22:16.099
Can you imagine?

00:22:16.099 --> 00:22:18.099
I'd want to try to touch it.

00:22:18.099 --> 00:22:20.099
I don't know that I would,

00:22:20.099 --> 00:22:23.099
but it'd probably cross my mind.

00:22:23.099 --> 00:22:26.099
It'd be amazing to cross over.

00:22:26.099 --> 00:22:30.099
Listen, they're eyewitnesses of God's great power.

00:22:30.099 --> 00:22:35.099
They're seeing God do what they've never seen before.

00:22:35.099 --> 00:22:41.099
Oh, they had the opportunity in Egypt with the plagues.

00:22:41.099 --> 00:22:43.099
Some that they saw.

00:22:43.099 --> 00:22:46.099
Some, no doubt, that they'd simply heard about.

00:22:46.099 --> 00:22:48.099
They knew what was going on.

00:22:48.099 --> 00:22:52.099
There was a portion of distance between where Pharaoh was

00:22:52.099 --> 00:22:55.099
and Ramses and all of that and all that was going on.

00:22:55.099 --> 00:22:57.099
But I want you to understand

00:22:57.099 --> 00:23:00.099
that now they're crossing over that red sea.

00:23:00.099 --> 00:23:05.099
They're experiencing personally God's great power.

00:23:05.099 --> 00:23:08.099
And as they're experiencing personally God's great power,

00:23:08.099 --> 00:23:11.099
they're taking one step after the other,

00:23:11.099 --> 00:23:14.099
and they're crossing over, and they're going.

00:23:14.099 --> 00:23:16.099
The Bible says that the children of Israel

00:23:16.099 --> 00:23:19.099
went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground,

00:23:19.099 --> 00:23:22.099
and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand

00:23:22.099 --> 00:23:24.099
and on their left.

00:23:24.099 --> 00:23:27.099
Notice if you skip down to verse number 29,

00:23:27.099 --> 00:23:29.099
the Bible says this,

00:23:38.099 --> 00:23:40.099
Wow.

00:23:40.099 --> 00:23:43.099
Again, I know that we're familiar with this portion of Scripture,

00:23:43.099 --> 00:23:46.099
but I want you to see how God's demonstrating His power.

00:23:46.099 --> 00:23:48.099
And I want you to see how the children of Israel

00:23:48.099 --> 00:23:52.099
are eyewitnesses of this great work, of God's great work.

00:23:52.099 --> 00:23:55.099
And what a blessing it is to be an eyewitness

00:23:55.099 --> 00:23:57.099
of what God is doing

00:23:57.099 --> 00:24:00.099
and to see how God is able to do

00:24:00.099 --> 00:24:03.099
what you could never even imagine.

00:24:03.099 --> 00:24:06.099
I don't think there was probably one within the group

00:24:06.099 --> 00:24:09.099
that said, you know, I think God can just part the sea

00:24:09.099 --> 00:24:11.099
so that we could go over.

00:24:13.099 --> 00:24:15.099
But God did it.

00:24:15.099 --> 00:24:18.099
God did the impossible.

00:24:18.099 --> 00:24:22.099
See, they've never experienced anything like this.

00:24:22.099 --> 00:24:26.099
But what a blessing to experience personally

00:24:26.099 --> 00:24:31.099
the power of God Almighty.

00:24:31.099 --> 00:24:33.099
In verses 23 through 28,

00:24:33.099 --> 00:24:37.099
the Bible tells us about the Egyptians.

00:24:37.099 --> 00:24:40.099
And by the way, the miraculous work

00:24:40.099 --> 00:24:43.099
doesn't cease in verse number 22.

00:24:43.099 --> 00:24:45.099
We find that in verse number 23

00:24:45.099 --> 00:24:48.099
that the Bible says that the Egyptians pursued

00:24:48.099 --> 00:24:50.099
and went in after them to the midst of the sea,

00:24:50.099 --> 00:24:54.099
even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.

00:24:54.099 --> 00:24:56.099
That's what God said He would do,

00:24:56.099 --> 00:24:58.099
that He would, in verse 17 and 18,

00:24:58.099 --> 00:25:00.099
that He would harden the hearts of the Egyptians,

00:25:00.099 --> 00:25:02.099
that they shall follow them.

00:25:02.099 --> 00:25:04.099
We find that they come in, they pursued after.

00:25:04.099 --> 00:25:06.099
In verse number 24, it says,

00:25:06.099 --> 00:25:08.099
and it came to pass that in the morning watch

00:25:08.099 --> 00:25:10.099
the Lord looked unto the host of the Egyptians

00:25:10.099 --> 00:25:12.099
through the pillar of fire and the cloud

00:25:12.099 --> 00:25:14.099
and troubled the host of the Egyptians.

00:25:14.099 --> 00:25:16.099
Notice what it says in verse 25,

00:25:16.099 --> 00:25:19.099
and took off their chariot wheels,

00:25:19.099 --> 00:25:21.099
that they drove them heavily.

00:25:21.099 --> 00:25:25.099
So the Egyptians said, let us flee from the face of Israel.

00:25:25.099 --> 00:25:29.099
Notice this, for the Lord fighteth for them

00:25:29.099 --> 00:25:32.099
against the Egyptians.

00:25:32.099 --> 00:25:35.099
What did God say there?

00:25:35.099 --> 00:25:37.099
Moses said to the people of God in verse number 14,

00:25:37.099 --> 00:25:39.099
the Lord shall fight for you

00:25:39.099 --> 00:25:41.099
and ye shall hold your peace.

00:25:41.099 --> 00:25:45.099
We find here that God, as He sees the Egyptians,

00:25:45.099 --> 00:25:48.099
listen, He knew exactly how far to let them get

00:25:48.099 --> 00:25:51.099
into the midst of that Red Sea.

00:25:51.099 --> 00:25:54.099
He knew the exact distance to let them travel

00:25:54.099 --> 00:25:56.099
through the midst of that Red Sea,

00:25:56.099 --> 00:25:59.099
and then He caused their chariot wheels,

00:25:59.099 --> 00:26:01.099
as the Bible says in verse 25,

00:26:01.099 --> 00:26:03.099
that He took off their chariot wheels,

00:26:03.099 --> 00:26:05.099
that they drove them heavily,

00:26:05.099 --> 00:26:07.099
so that the Egyptians said, let us flee.

00:26:07.099 --> 00:26:09.099
Listen, His timing is perfect.

00:26:09.099 --> 00:26:12.099
He knows everything, and He let them get to exactly

00:26:12.099 --> 00:26:14.099
where they were supposed to get,

00:26:14.099 --> 00:26:16.099
and He had those chariot wheels come off,

00:26:16.099 --> 00:26:18.099
and then the Bible says they're going to flee.

00:26:18.099 --> 00:26:20.099
Notice in verse number 26,

00:26:20.099 --> 00:26:22.099
and the Lord said unto Moses,

00:26:22.099 --> 00:26:24.099
Stretch out thine hand over the sea,

00:26:24.099 --> 00:26:26.099
that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians,

00:26:26.099 --> 00:26:28.099
upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.

00:26:28.099 --> 00:26:30.099
And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea,

00:26:30.099 --> 00:26:32.099
and the sea returned to its strength.

00:26:32.099 --> 00:26:35.099
When the morning appeared, and the Egyptians fled against it,

00:26:35.099 --> 00:26:37.099
and the Lord overthrew the Egyptians

00:26:37.099 --> 00:26:39.099
in the midst of the sea.

00:26:39.099 --> 00:26:41.099
The Bible says that the waters returned

00:26:41.099 --> 00:26:43.099
and covered the chariots and the horsemen

00:26:43.099 --> 00:26:46.099
and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them

00:26:46.099 --> 00:26:50.099
that remained not so much as one of them.

00:26:50.099 --> 00:26:53.099
Verse 30 says, Thus the Lord saved Israel that day

00:26:53.099 --> 00:26:55.099
out of the hand of the Egyptians,

00:26:55.099 --> 00:27:01.099
and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the seashore.

00:27:01.099 --> 00:27:05.099
This is amazing work that God did.

00:27:05.099 --> 00:27:08.099
Not only did God part the Red Sea,

00:27:08.099 --> 00:27:11.099
He allowed the Egyptians to pursue after,

00:27:11.099 --> 00:27:13.099
and at just the right mark,

00:27:13.099 --> 00:27:17.099
at just the right distance into their traveling through,

00:27:17.099 --> 00:27:20.099
the Bible says that they got stuck,

00:27:20.099 --> 00:27:22.099
their wheels came off, they drove heavily,

00:27:22.099 --> 00:27:24.099
and then God said to Moses,

00:27:24.099 --> 00:27:26.099
Now raise up that rod again,

00:27:26.099 --> 00:27:29.099
and we're going to close the sea.

00:27:29.099 --> 00:27:33.099
It's amazing, the power of God.

00:27:33.099 --> 00:27:38.099
That Red Sea stayed parted because God kept it parted,

00:27:38.099 --> 00:27:42.099
and that Red Sea closed up because God caused it to close up.

00:27:42.099 --> 00:27:45.099
Listen, don't listen to the scoffers today

00:27:45.099 --> 00:27:47.099
that will try to take you to this portion of Scripture

00:27:47.099 --> 00:27:50.099
and say it wasn't the Red Sea, it was the Reed Sea.

00:27:50.099 --> 00:27:51.099
The Bible says it's the Red Sea.

00:27:51.099 --> 00:27:53.099
By the way, you study your Bible,

00:27:53.099 --> 00:27:56.099
and you'll find that repeatedly through the Scriptures,

00:27:56.099 --> 00:27:59.099
the Bible speaks about this event that took place,

00:27:59.099 --> 00:28:03.099
and every single time, it's the Red Sea.

00:28:03.099 --> 00:28:06.099
Even in the New Testament, as Stephen is preaching,

00:28:06.099 --> 00:28:08.099
he preaches about the Red Sea

00:28:08.099 --> 00:28:13.099
and what God did here in delivering the people of God

00:28:13.099 --> 00:28:15.099
from the Egyptians.

00:28:15.099 --> 00:28:17.099
Listen, you must always trust the Word of God.

00:28:17.099 --> 00:28:20.099
Do not listen to what the scoffers say.

00:28:20.099 --> 00:28:24.099
By the way, the scoffers and their attack upon the Word of God

00:28:24.099 --> 00:28:26.099
often make themselves look ridiculous,

00:28:26.099 --> 00:28:29.099
because I would submit to you that if it were the Reed Sea,

00:28:29.099 --> 00:28:31.099
and it is not, it is the Red Sea,

00:28:31.099 --> 00:28:33.099
that it would be absolutely amazing

00:28:33.099 --> 00:28:35.099
for God and just a few inches of water

00:28:35.099 --> 00:28:42.099
to overthrow the entire army of Egypt.

00:28:42.099 --> 00:28:45.099
But we find here that it's the Red Sea,

00:28:45.099 --> 00:28:48.099
and God worked miraculously,

00:28:48.099 --> 00:28:51.099
and we find that their deliverance is recorded for us

00:28:51.099 --> 00:28:55.099
and how we can rejoice in seeing what God did

00:28:55.099 --> 00:28:59.099
and understanding as the children of Israel

00:28:59.099 --> 00:29:02.099
had the opportunity to be eyewitnesses

00:29:02.099 --> 00:29:04.099
of the power of Almighty God.

00:29:04.099 --> 00:29:06.099
It tells us in verse number 31,

00:29:06.099 --> 00:29:11.099
and Israel saw that great work which the Lord did

00:29:11.099 --> 00:29:13.099
upon the Egyptians.

00:29:13.099 --> 00:29:16.099
They saw it, they experienced it,

00:29:16.099 --> 00:29:20.099
they understood as eyewitnesses the power of God.

00:29:20.099 --> 00:29:22.099
It tells us the impact in verse number 31,

00:29:22.099 --> 00:29:25.099
that the people feared the Lord.

00:29:25.099 --> 00:29:29.099
By the way, it's a good thing for people to fear God.

00:29:29.099 --> 00:29:31.099
Some people today that run around saying,

00:29:31.099 --> 00:29:34.099
I don't fear anything or anyone.

00:29:34.099 --> 00:29:37.099
I've seen people wearing clothing that says

00:29:37.099 --> 00:29:39.099
only God can judge me,

00:29:39.099 --> 00:29:42.099
and they wear it boldly as if to say,

00:29:42.099 --> 00:29:45.099
make some statement about no one can judge them.

00:29:45.099 --> 00:29:49.099
Listen, it's a fearful thing to stand before God Almighty,

00:29:49.099 --> 00:29:51.099
the judge of all the earth.

00:29:51.099 --> 00:29:53.099
It's a fearful thing.

00:29:53.099 --> 00:29:55.099
Our God is to be feared.

00:29:55.099 --> 00:29:57.099
He has great power.

00:29:57.099 --> 00:30:00.099
By the way, it was a proper thing...

00:30:00.099 --> 00:30:06.099
for them to respond in this manner. It says that they feared the Lord, notice this, and believed

00:30:06.819 --> 00:30:11.299
the Lord. You know, God wants you to believe Him. He wants us to believe Him.

00:30:12.019 --> 00:30:16.099
He wants us to trust Him. He wants us to believe that He is able to do

00:30:18.659 --> 00:30:23.459
in your situation, in your circumstance, amazing things.

00:30:23.459 --> 00:30:35.539
So we continue to think about the impact of this particular event in the nation of Israel.

00:30:35.539 --> 00:30:40.339
We'll look at just a few verses in chapter 15, and I want you to notice what the Bible says.

00:30:40.339 --> 00:30:46.339
This chapter 15, the first 21 verses at least, are dealing with the people singing and rejoicing

00:30:46.339 --> 00:30:51.379
and how God had delivered His people and how they're rejoicing. It starts in verse number one

00:30:51.379 --> 00:30:57.379
of chapter 15, then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the Lord. Here's what

00:30:57.379 --> 00:31:05.059
they said in verse number one, I will sing unto the Lord, for He hath triumphed gloriously. The

00:31:05.059 --> 00:31:10.019
horse and his rider hath He thrown into the sea. Do you notice in their song what they recognize?

00:31:10.019 --> 00:31:18.179
They recognize that it was God that did the work, for He hath triumphed gloriously. When God works

00:31:18.179 --> 00:31:23.619
in your life and in my life, I hope that we give God the credit. I hope that we give God the glory.

00:31:23.619 --> 00:31:29.219
I hope that we recognize that it's God that did the work and that we do not try to explain it

00:31:29.219 --> 00:31:33.379
through, well, you know, I made this decision and I did this and I had it. No, no, no. We got to give

00:31:33.379 --> 00:31:40.979
God the glory. We got to give God the glory. He alone is worthy. We find that they recognize that

00:31:40.979 --> 00:31:47.219
it was God who had triumphed gloriously. Notice with me in verse number seven, the Bible says,

00:31:47.219 --> 00:31:53.539
And in the greatness of thine excellency, thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee.

00:31:53.539 --> 00:32:01.459
Thou sentest forth thy wrath, which consumed them as stubble. You notice there it speaks about the

00:32:01.459 --> 00:32:07.139
greatness of thine excellency and the work that God did. You notice in verse number 13, in verse

00:32:07.139 --> 00:32:12.499
number 12, it says, Thou stretchest out thy right hand, and the earth swallowed them. Thou in thy

00:32:12.499 --> 00:32:19.059
mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast redeemed. Thou hast guided them in thy strength

00:32:19.059 --> 00:32:23.459
unto thy holy habitation. Listen, they're singing a different song than they were singing there at

00:32:23.459 --> 00:32:29.539
Pi-hahiroth, aren't they? Because they saw God work. They're eyewitnesses of what God did.

00:32:30.339 --> 00:32:35.059
They're saying, look at what God did in thy mercy. Understand this morning that our God is

00:32:35.859 --> 00:32:42.979
merciful. He's merciful. I'm so thankful this morning to be a recipient of God's great mercy.

00:32:43.539 --> 00:32:49.139
The Bible says that thou hast led forth the people which thou hast redeemed. Notice thou

00:32:49.139 --> 00:32:54.739
hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation. I'm thankful for the leadership and

00:32:54.739 --> 00:33:00.419
guidance that God gives in our lives. Listen, as we faithfully seek the face of God,

00:33:00.419 --> 00:33:08.979
we understand that He provides direction for us. They were not singing that same tune when

00:33:08.979 --> 00:33:13.619
they were found there at Pi-hahiroth at the beginning of chapter 14, even though it was God

00:33:13.619 --> 00:33:18.019
that led them. They're saying, Moses, why did you bring us here? You brought us here to die in the

00:33:18.019 --> 00:33:23.939
wilderness. But now they're saying God led and God guided them. Notice in verse number 16, Fear and

00:33:23.939 --> 00:33:30.099
dread shall fall upon them. By the greatness of thine arm, they shall be as still as a stone.

00:33:30.899 --> 00:33:36.259
Till thy people pass over, O Lord, till the people pass over which thou hast purchased.

00:33:36.819 --> 00:33:41.219
Let me say this, as we think about the children of Israel, they say this in verse 18, the Lord

00:33:41.219 --> 00:33:47.059
shall reign forever and ever. And that's true. He's going to reign forever and ever. But I want

00:33:47.059 --> 00:33:51.219
you to understand, as we think about the children of Israel in this portion of Scripture, and we see

00:33:51.219 --> 00:33:55.539
their dilemma, their distress, we see their deliverance, we see how that they had the

00:33:55.539 --> 00:34:02.259
opportunity to be the eyewitnesses of His great power, of God's work here in this portion of

00:34:02.259 --> 00:34:08.339
Scripture. And what they were murmuring and complaining, and they were beside themselves,

00:34:08.339 --> 00:34:12.979
they're saying we should have never left Egypt. It was better for us to serve there in Egypt,

00:34:12.979 --> 00:34:18.979
and we're going to die in this wilderness. And now they're singing and they're rejoicing.

00:34:19.619 --> 00:34:23.459
Listen, after God works, it's easy for us to rejoice.

00:34:25.459 --> 00:34:29.299
But I hope that God would help us to learn a lesson from this portion of Scripture this morning,

00:34:30.339 --> 00:34:34.179
that in the midst of the difficulty that we must remember that God is on His throne,

00:34:34.739 --> 00:34:38.739
that we're faced with that dilemma that we say, I wonder what God's going to do? I wonder how

00:34:38.739 --> 00:34:46.099
God's going to work? And we find that just as the children of Israel in this portion of Scripture,

00:34:46.099 --> 00:34:54.259
so we too, in our lives, often are prone to forget. We face a difficulty, we have a dilemma

00:34:54.259 --> 00:35:00.499
in our lives. God works miraculously. I mean, you're an eyewitness of God's great power. You

00:35:00.499 --> 00:35:05.139
see God's work in your life. It's not just that you've read about what God did for someone else,

00:35:05.139 --> 00:35:10.259
or you heard someone else in a testimony service give praise to God for how God worked in their

00:35:10.259 --> 00:35:16.499
life. No, I'm saying that you personally experienced God's power and God's work in your

00:35:16.499 --> 00:35:23.219
life, and you're an eyewitness. And then there's another trial. You ever find in life that just

00:35:23.219 --> 00:35:28.659
because you've had victory that, man, that means there's no more trials. No, no, the only time we're

00:35:28.659 --> 00:35:33.139
going to have no more trials when we get to heaven. Amen? There's coming a day that we're going to get

00:35:33.139 --> 00:35:40.019
to heaven, and we're going to have no more trials. Praise the Lord. But until that day,

00:35:40.579 --> 00:35:47.139
there'll be trials in our life. And just after they're singing this wonderful song of praise to

00:35:47.139 --> 00:35:53.619
God, after they've seen God work as eyewitnesses of God's great work, of God's great power,

00:35:53.619 --> 00:35:59.859
the Bible tells us at the end of chapter number 15 of the book of Exodus that they come to a place,

00:35:59.859 --> 00:36:04.739
and the Bible says that they come to a place called Marah. If you know anything about Marah,

00:36:04.739 --> 00:36:11.059
it's a place that the Bible describes as being a place of bitter water, a place where they could

00:36:11.059 --> 00:36:18.579
drink no water. Look at it with me in verse 22. So Moses brought Israel from the Red Sea,

00:36:18.579 --> 00:36:23.539
and they went out into the wilderness of Shur, and they went three days in the wilderness and

00:36:24.099 --> 00:36:29.939
no water. Now let me ask you, does God know that you need water? Absolutely. He made us.

00:36:30.579 --> 00:36:36.179
He created us. He knows that we need water. And the Bible tells us, and they went, and they came,

00:36:36.179 --> 00:36:41.299
notice in verse 23, and when they came to Marah, they could not drink the waters of Marah. Why?

00:36:41.299 --> 00:36:45.139
For they were bitter, therefore the name of it was called Marah. And the people,

00:36:45.139 --> 00:36:49.379
they got together and they said, let's see what God's going to do. Let's see how God's going to

00:36:49.379 --> 00:36:52.179
work. Do you remember what He did in Egypt? Do you remember what He did at the Red Sea? Do you

00:36:52.179 --> 00:36:57.459
remember how He parted at the Red Sea? No, they didn't say any of that. They murmured, the Bible

00:36:57.459 --> 00:37:02.499
says, against Moses saying, what shall we drink? He cried unto the Lord. The Lord showed him a tree

00:37:02.499 --> 00:37:05.939
and he cast it. But the Bible says at the end of verse number 25, notice what the Bible says. I'll

00:37:05.939 --> 00:37:10.099
read the entirety of it. And he cried unto the Lord and the Lord showed him a tree, which when

00:37:10.099 --> 00:37:14.819
he had cast in the waters, the waters were made sweet. There he made for them a statute and

00:37:14.819 --> 00:37:23.379
ordinance and there he proved them. God proves us. You're going to trust Him? You see God work.

00:37:24.179 --> 00:37:29.219
They were eyewitnesses of His great work. They got to see God do something

00:37:30.419 --> 00:37:38.259
that no one had ever seen before. This group of people in Exodus chapter number 14,

00:37:38.259 --> 00:37:43.299
they experienced something that no other group of people have ever experienced.

00:37:45.699 --> 00:37:51.299
The Jordan River is a different situation. You can read it in the book of Joshua.

00:37:51.299 --> 00:37:57.379
But this circumstance here in Exodus chapter number 14, only this group of people experienced

00:37:57.379 --> 00:38:06.579
this personally. And though they experienced some great, mighty work of God, they come to the next

00:38:06.659 --> 00:38:16.659
trial and they murmur. They forget what God is able to do. I hope that it would not be the case

00:38:16.659 --> 00:38:23.859
for you or for me. I hope that as God allows us to be eyewitnesses of His great power, as God would

00:38:23.859 --> 00:38:29.779
allow us to see His great work in our lives, that when we face those next times of difficulty,

00:38:29.779 --> 00:38:35.619
when we have that next trial and that next test, that we would have great excitement and enthusiasm

00:38:35.619 --> 00:38:42.179
about what is God going to do? How is God going to work? Because we get to see what God is able to

00:38:42.179 --> 00:38:48.979
do. Listen, it's exciting to see God work. It really is. But many times, you know what has to

00:38:48.979 --> 00:38:56.339
happen before you see God work? A dilemma, a problem, a difficulty. You know how most of us

00:38:56.339 --> 00:39:03.779
deal with difficulties? We don't like them. We try to avoid them at all costs, right? But we see that

00:39:03.779 --> 00:39:08.339
God leads us. And at times, as God is leading us, He is leading us directly into a place

00:39:08.339 --> 00:39:12.979
where He's going to prove His great power. He's going to show you His work. Turn to the

00:39:12.979 --> 00:39:18.739
book of Psalms, if you will. We'll finish with this in Psalm 119. In Psalm 119,

00:39:19.699 --> 00:39:34.899
there's a verse of Scripture here that I want to close our service with this morning. I hope that

00:39:34.899 --> 00:39:42.339
it would be a verse that would be a prayer of each of ours this morning and this week. In Psalm 119,

00:39:42.339 --> 00:39:54.979
in verse number 126, the Bible says this, it is time for thee, Lord, to work.

00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:59.940
For they have made void thy law.

00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:06.560
No doubt, we live in the midst of a place where they've made void the law of God.

00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:08.540
We understand that.

00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:17.820
But I want you to see that statement to begin the verse, it is time for Thee, Lord, to work.

00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:23.100
I wonder this morning, how many of us are anxious to see God work?

00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:29.940
I mean desiring to see God do something, that we would surrender and yield our lives to

00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:32.380
God and say, God, I just want to see you work.

00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:33.380
I want to see you.

00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:34.660
Listen, it's all for God's glory.

00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:35.900
It's not for my glory.

00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:36.900
It's not for your glory.

00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:38.460
It's all for His glory.

00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:42.620
And we would be careful, even as they sang the praise, to understand that the Lord, it

00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:46.720
is He that hath worked gloriously, triumphed gloriously.

00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:51.460
And we find this morning that we would pray and say, God, it's time, Lord, for Thee to

00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:52.460
work.

00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:57.660
We long to see you work in our lives personally, in our church, corporately, in our nation.

00:40:57.660 --> 00:41:00.740
We long, God, to see you work.

00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:01.740
God is able.

00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:09.940
The children of Israel faced a great difficulty, but God wasn't concerned for one moment.

00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:16.700
For God knew that He led them exactly to that place, and He was going to show His great

00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:18.360
power.

00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:22.620
And they were eyewitnesses of His great work.

00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:32.139
This morning, I enjoy reading about, I enjoy listening to people give testimony about what

00:41:32.139 --> 00:41:35.600
God has done.

00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:39.300
But the most exciting is seeing God work personally.

00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:46.860
And I want to be an eyewitness of God's great work in my life, in your life, in our lives

00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:47.860
corporately.

00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:54.420
Let's see what God will do as we yield and surrender to Him, that we would give God the

00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:57.420
glory for He is worthy of it.

00:41:57.420 --> 00:41:58.420
Let's pray together.

00:41:58.420 --> 00:41:59.420
Father, we love You.

00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:02.139
How we thank You for loving us.

00:42:02.139 --> 00:42:07.020
We thank You this morning for this record that's given to us in Exodus 14.

00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:12.500
Many of us this morning are familiar with this portion of Scripture.

00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:18.160
No doubt within a group this size, there are some that would say, that's my favorite account

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:19.619
of all of God's Word.

00:42:19.619 --> 00:42:22.220
I love that passage of Scripture.

00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:33.540
God, I pray this morning, as we've had the opportunity to go through and to learn from

00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:40.820
this portion of Scripture, God, You would help us to have that longing of the psalmist.

00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:47.180
It is time for Thee, Lord, to work, that we would be eyewitnesses, just as the children

00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:52.619
of Israel here in Exodus 14, that we be eyewitnesses of Your great work.

00:42:52.619 --> 00:42:58.180
I pray, God, that this morning You would help Your people.

00:42:58.180 --> 00:43:03.580
No doubt there's some that are dealing with some difficulties, some dilemmas, some situations

00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:11.020
that from a human perspective seem to be no way out, no path forward.

00:43:11.020 --> 00:43:20.860
I'm so thankful that in those circumstances, in those situations, You love to prove Your

00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:23.779
power.

00:43:23.779 --> 00:43:29.139
I pray, God, that You would work and move in hearts and lives as only You can.

00:43:29.139 --> 00:43:31.699
There's someone this morning that's not sure of heaven.

00:43:31.699 --> 00:43:35.660
I pray that today, Lord, they'd understand their need for Christ.

00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:38.260
Give us an opportunity to take a Bible and show them how they could know for sure that

00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:41.380
heaven is their home.

00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:45.180
We pray that in these few moments of invitation that You'd have Your will and way.

00:43:45.180 --> 00:43:48.419
We'll thank You for each decision that will be made, for it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:43:48.419 --> 00:43:49.419
Would You stand with me?

00:43:49.419 --> 00:43:53.419
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

00:43:53.419 --> 00:43:55.820
He's going to play quietly on the piano this morning.
