WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.099
Well, amen. Thank you, young men. Certainly appreciate them ministering in music. Welcome

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:12.399
home to Kiademe as well. And she finished her first semester of college, and thank you

00:00:12.399 --> 00:00:16.760
for praying for her. She said the week of finals went well, and so we're thankful and

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.440
good to see her and look forward to seeing her over the next couple of weeks. If you

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:27.120
have your Bible with you this morning, Psalm 145, Psalm 145, and it's got 21 verses in

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.760
this particular psalm, we're going to do our best to make it through the entirety of the

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:37.159
psalm this morning. And I am thankful throughout this calendar year, our theme has been Great

00:00:37.159 --> 00:00:42.479
is the Lord. The banners are up, you have sermon notebooks and bookmarks and calendars

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:46.759
and we sing a theme song. I mean, we just try to keep it in front of us every single

00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:52.799
week to be reminded of what our theme is. And as we have had the opportunity throughout

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:57.599
this year, this calendar year, to study the subject, to be able to preach on the subject

00:00:57.599 --> 00:01:02.159
of Great is the Lord, I've been encouraged, I trust that you have as well. It's exciting

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:08.080
to know the Lord. And what a blessing to have a Bible. Of course, in God's Word, He's given

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:14.040
us the revelation of Himself. He's given us the truth with regard to salvation. And certainly

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.879
thankful for what God has revealed to us this morning will be our final message on this

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:22.519
particular theme. Next Sunday morning, I'll be preaching a Christmas message. And then

00:01:22.519 --> 00:01:28.360
December 31st, we will introduce the theme for 2024. And so this is the last message

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:34.720
of the year. And I trust that God will help us as I seek to package over 30 messages on

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:41.120
this particular subject into one final charge this morning. And I trust that as we have

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:46.319
studied this subject matter of Great is the Lord, that our faith has been increased. I

00:01:46.559 --> 00:01:52.160
trust that we have, as we've examined the various aspects of God's greatness, that it

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:59.160
has had an impact, a direct impact on how we behave. Why? Because we serve a great God.

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:05.040
And no doubt, what we believe will have an impact on our behavior. And I trust that God

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.960
has had that opportunity in your life and my life through the preaching of His Word

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:16.039
to remind us of how great He is and that it would have an impact on our daily living this

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:20.399
morning. I'm going to preach from this chapter. I've titled the message really from verse

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:26.000
number three, Great is the Lord and greatly to be praised. It's actually the full statement

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.119
of our banner. It's the same truth that we find in Psalm 48 and verse number one as that

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:34.160
passage of scripture begins. But we'll look here at Psalm 145. Begin reading with me in

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.919
verse number one. The Bible says this, I will extol thee, my God, O King, and I will bless

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:46.919
thy name forever and ever. Every day will I bless thee and I will praise thy name forever

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:56.360
and ever. Great is the Lord and greatly to be praised and His greatness is unsearchable.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:02.279
One generation shall praise thy works to another and shall declare thy mighty acts. I will

00:03:02.279 --> 00:03:09.279
speak of the glorious honor of thy majesty and of thy wondrous works. And men shall speak

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:16.160
of the might of thy terrible acts and I will declare thy greatness. As we look at this

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.960
portion of scripture, we'll make it through verse number 21 through the message this morning.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.639
I find myself looking at verse number three and obviously understanding that the psalmist

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:28.679
recognizes the greatness of God. But he makes this statement at the end of verse number

00:03:28.679 --> 00:03:35.679
three which is so, just a thought provoking statement when he says, and His greatness

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:41.600
is unsearchable. We find that in Psalm 135 in verse number five, the psalmist declares

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:48.600
with great confidence and certainty, I know that the Lord is great. And so we find that

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:55.000
the psalmist this morning understanding the greatness of God and obviously worshiping

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.080
and praising God because of what he understands to be true about God. We find that he gives

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.720
us this nugget of truth at the end of verse number three that tells us His greatness is

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.639
unsearchable. And I'm so thankful that God has revealed to us in His word who He is and

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:18.279
how great He is. But the reality this morning for each and every one of us, and though our

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:24.320
thoughts may vary this morning with regard to what we understand about God and how great

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:30.119
He is in our mind, for every one of us this morning, this statement is true that no matter

00:04:30.239 --> 00:04:36.839
how great you think God is this morning, He's far greater. He's far greater than your mind

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:43.839
could ever conceive that you could ever imagine. He is greater, greater, and greater. And what

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:50.440
a blessing to understand the truth of God's word. He is infinite. We are finite. We cannot

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:57.440
in our finite minds understand the totality of how great our God is. By the way, if you

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:05.440
could fully understand how great God is, I would argue that He's probably not God. Amen?

00:05:07.359 --> 00:05:14.359
But because of who He is and what He has revealed to us in His word, we find the very truth

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:20.279
that His greatness is unsearchable. But for you and I this morning, just as we look at

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:27.079
the psalm here in Psalm 145, we find that though His greatness is unsearchable, we can

00:05:27.079 --> 00:05:32.359
be certain that God is great. We can sing about it. We can speak about it. We can have

00:05:32.359 --> 00:05:39.359
that confidence this morning that we serve a great God. If you're taking notes this morning,

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:44.239
just a few thoughts as we get through Psalm 145 this morning. Number one, the psalmist

00:05:44.239 --> 00:05:50.799
here in Psalm 145, the psalmist is convinced of God's greatness. He is convinced of God's

00:05:50.799 --> 00:05:54.600
greatness. You know what it means to be convinced of something? I mean, if you are convinced

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:59.239
of something, you are settled on some truth. There's no one that's going to be able to

00:05:59.239 --> 00:06:04.640
persuade you otherwise. You are convinced of it. You are confident in what it is that

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:10.279
you believe. And here as I look at Psalm 145, I see that the psalmist is, he is convinced,

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:17.279
he is confident that God indeed is great. Notice he makes this very broad declarative

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:24.359
type of statement, very plain, in verse number three, great is the Lord and greatly to be

00:06:24.359 --> 00:06:29.480
praised. We find that as he would use, if I could use the terminology this morning,

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:35.160
a broad brush, if you will, in verse number three, by simply declaring God is great and

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:40.799
greatly to be praised. It's a plain, broad statement that the psalmist makes in verse

00:06:40.799 --> 00:06:45.600
number three. But I want you to understand that as you study through Psalm 145, that

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:52.600
the details that are provided are overwhelming with helping us to understand why the psalmist

00:06:54.279 --> 00:07:00.640
is so convinced and so confident that God is great. And this morning and throughout

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:06.160
this year, we've sought to take the Sunday morning service and the message series to

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:12.359
try to help each of us as God's people to have that same level of confidence for we

00:07:12.359 --> 00:07:18.920
to be convinced that our God is great. Notice with me as we look at the details that are

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:24.359
provided here in Psalm 145, if you look and study through this, notice in verse number

00:07:24.359 --> 00:07:28.200
five, and we'll walk our way through the psalm, we'll begin in verse number five, where it

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:35.200
says this, I will speak of the glorious honor of thy majesty. I want you to think about

00:07:36.119 --> 00:07:43.119
that statement when we think about his majesty. The word carries with it the idea of splendor.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:52.160
It has the quality or state of a person which inspires awe or reverence. I wonder this morning

00:07:53.239 --> 00:07:58.799
when you think about his majesty, and I wonder this morning if we stand in awe of who God

00:07:58.799 --> 00:08:03.320
is. We use that word awesome in our English language, and there are times in which we

00:08:03.359 --> 00:08:09.279
may speak of something or someone being awesome because of some attribute or something, but

00:08:09.279 --> 00:08:15.119
we find that we as the people of God as we come face to face with who God is, we ought

00:08:15.119 --> 00:08:21.459
to stand in awe of who he is. Why? Because of his majesty. And when we understand the

00:08:21.459 --> 00:08:27.160
quality of who God is, when we understand the qualities and the characteristics that

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:32.880
God has revealed to us within his word, we find that we stand in awe of him. He is worthy

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:38.380
as I started the service this morning, we sang that we're come to worship. The reality

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:45.380
is that he is worthy of our worship, and we ought to stand in awe of a thrice holy God.

00:08:46.099 --> 00:08:51.719
We find that the psalmist begins providing the details for us with regard to why would

00:08:51.719 --> 00:08:55.919
he make the statement great is the Lord and greatly to be praised, and his greatness is

00:08:55.919 --> 00:09:00.239
unsearchable. Well, he starts in verse number five by speaking of his majesty. Notice in

00:09:00.239 --> 00:09:07.239
verse number seven the Bible says this, they shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:14.159
goodness and shall sing of thy righteousness. So we see in verse number seven that the psalmist

00:09:14.159 --> 00:09:20.559
reminds himself and reminds us of God's great goodness. I'm so thankful that God is a good

00:09:20.559 --> 00:09:25.640
God. He's a great God, but he's a good God, and we find this morning that David would

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:29.799
say, and this psalm is ascribed to David, that David would say in other places, taste

00:09:29.799 --> 00:09:36.799
and see that the Lord is good. And we find this morning that the Bible says of thy great

00:09:38.039 --> 00:09:45.039
goodness. God is good all the time. I often have had conversations over the past with

00:09:47.099 --> 00:09:53.960
folks within our church and even outside of our church, and you think about the opportunity

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.280
to, Gloria Long will say this to me every time I speak with her, God is good all the

00:09:59.280 --> 00:09:59.799
time.

00:09:59.799 --> 00:10:02.759
And then she'll say, all the time God is good.

00:10:02.759 --> 00:10:05.639
And what a great reference for us to understand.

00:10:05.639 --> 00:10:13.519
So often today people have the idea that God's goodness is dependent somehow on their circumstances.

00:10:13.519 --> 00:10:16.479
But that's far from the truth.

00:10:16.479 --> 00:10:18.319
God is good all of the time.

00:10:18.319 --> 00:10:23.039
No matter what our circumstances are, we know that God is good.

00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:25.479
It is his very nature, it is his very being.

00:10:25.479 --> 00:10:31.039
And here we find that the psalmist, as he declares broadly the greatness of God in verse

00:10:31.039 --> 00:10:37.399
number three, he provides us with various details, his majesty, his great goodness.

00:10:37.399 --> 00:10:41.159
But notice in verse number seven, thy righteousness.

00:10:41.159 --> 00:10:43.159
I'm thankful that God is righteous.

00:10:43.159 --> 00:10:44.399
He's not becoming righteous.

00:10:44.399 --> 00:10:45.399
He is righteous.

00:10:45.399 --> 00:10:47.079
He always does that which is right.

00:10:47.079 --> 00:10:52.039
We find that as we would understand that we, all of our righteousness, according to what

00:10:52.039 --> 00:10:55.839
Isaiah says, is as filthy rags.

00:10:55.839 --> 00:10:59.839
But I'm thankful for this wonderful Bible truth that at the moment of salvation, if

00:10:59.839 --> 00:11:05.559
you've trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal savior, at the moment of salvation,

00:11:05.559 --> 00:11:08.659
God's righteousness is imputed upon us.

00:11:08.659 --> 00:11:10.679
And that's a wonderful Bible truth.

00:11:10.679 --> 00:11:14.919
See this morning there are people all around the world and perhaps even one or several

00:11:14.919 --> 00:11:19.639
within our congregation that are gathered here this morning that are seeking to earn

00:11:20.159 --> 00:11:25.839
maybe salvation through some merit of their own, their own righteousness, quote unquote.

00:11:25.839 --> 00:11:28.639
Can I tell you this morning, biblically, you could never earn it.

00:11:28.639 --> 00:11:31.299
You could never find that merit.

00:11:31.299 --> 00:11:33.919
We find that all of it is as filthy rags.

00:11:33.919 --> 00:11:38.999
But here's what God says in 2 Corinthians 5 and verse 21, for he hath made him to be

00:11:38.999 --> 00:11:40.119
sin for us.

00:11:40.119 --> 00:11:47.339
That's Jesus Christ, the sinless lamb of God, God in flesh, who knew no sin, that we might

00:11:47.339 --> 00:11:50.859
be made the righteousness of God in him.

00:11:50.859 --> 00:11:54.899
And he takes his righteousness and he imputes it upon our account.

00:11:54.899 --> 00:11:56.939
What a wonderful truth of God's word.

00:11:56.939 --> 00:12:02.779
But we see here that the psalmist, he's, he's worshiping the Lord and he's reminding himself,

00:12:02.779 --> 00:12:04.979
God is righteous.

00:12:04.979 --> 00:12:05.979
He's righteous.

00:12:05.979 --> 00:12:07.899
He always does that which is right.

00:12:07.899 --> 00:12:11.539
Notice as we continue in verse number eight, the Lord is gracious.

00:12:11.539 --> 00:12:14.719
Aren't you thankful for God's grace?

00:12:14.719 --> 00:12:19.239
So often we sing amazing grace, how sweet the sound.

00:12:19.239 --> 00:12:24.359
And you think about that grace and we find that Paul would say in the book of 1 Timothy

00:12:24.359 --> 00:12:28.079
that his grace that he refers to it as being abundant grace.

00:12:28.079 --> 00:12:31.839
You find that in the book of Ephesians, for by grace are you saved through faith and that

00:12:31.839 --> 00:12:33.199
not of yourselves.

00:12:33.199 --> 00:12:36.779
It is the gift of God, not of works, lest any man should boast.

00:12:36.779 --> 00:12:43.039
We find that here the psalmist is worshiping the Lord and he says, listen, God is gracious.

00:12:43.359 --> 00:12:47.919
I wonder this morning, how often do we really focus on the fact that we serve a God who

00:12:47.919 --> 00:12:49.619
is gracious?

00:12:49.619 --> 00:12:55.119
Some have used an acronym, if you will, God's riches at Christ's expense and God giving

00:12:55.119 --> 00:12:56.879
us what we do not deserve.

00:12:56.879 --> 00:12:58.679
God's gracious.

00:12:58.679 --> 00:13:03.599
It's his very nature, his being, he is a gracious God.

00:13:03.599 --> 00:13:07.919
Notice in verse number eight, the Bible says not only is the Lord gracious, but he's full

00:13:07.919 --> 00:13:08.919
of compassion.

00:13:09.799 --> 00:13:13.199
And there are times in your life and there are times in my life that we're compassionate,

00:13:13.199 --> 00:13:18.499
but we find that we're not always compassionate and we find that we're not full of compassion,

00:13:18.499 --> 00:13:22.199
but yet we find that our God, he's full of compassion.

00:13:22.199 --> 00:13:27.239
I'm so thankful as you study through the New Testament, you study the life of Christ and

00:13:27.239 --> 00:13:32.039
the gospel records, you have the opportunity to read of occasions in which the scriptures

00:13:32.039 --> 00:13:35.759
will tell us that Jesus was moved with what?

00:13:35.759 --> 00:13:36.759
With compassion.

00:13:37.599 --> 00:13:39.759
He's moved with compassion.

00:13:39.759 --> 00:13:45.319
Why does the psalmist make this declaration that great is the Lord in verse number three?

00:13:45.319 --> 00:13:49.959
Why do I say that he's convinced, that he's confident of God's greatness?

00:13:49.959 --> 00:13:54.839
Well he provides us within this short psalm a number of reasons that brings him to the

00:13:54.839 --> 00:13:59.839
place of declaring God is great.

00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:03.959
He's gracious in verse number eight, he's compassionate in verse number eight.

00:14:03.959 --> 00:14:06.039
Notice the Bible says that he's slow to anger.

00:14:06.039 --> 00:14:08.999
I think of the idea of being long-suffering.

00:14:08.999 --> 00:14:12.239
I'm so thankful that our God is slow to anger, aren't you?

00:14:12.239 --> 00:14:17.079
And we find that judgment, he's a just God and we find that he does judge and we see

00:14:17.079 --> 00:14:20.759
that throughout the scriptures, not just in the Old Testament, the New Testament as well.

00:14:20.759 --> 00:14:26.119
We see that he judges, in fact, we understand the Bible teaches us about two future judgments

00:14:26.119 --> 00:14:27.519
that are still to come.

00:14:27.519 --> 00:14:32.839
One for believers and one for unbelievers, but we find that he's slow to wrath.

00:14:32.839 --> 00:14:38.279
He is here as it says in verse number eight, slow to anger, slow to anger.

00:14:38.279 --> 00:14:39.279
He's long-suffering.

00:14:39.279 --> 00:14:44.599
I know I've said this before, but the reality is that for each of us in our own personal

00:14:44.599 --> 00:14:50.119
lives we are rejoicing and we are thankful when God is long-suffering with us as individuals,

00:14:50.119 --> 00:14:51.839
aren't we?

00:14:51.839 --> 00:14:56.159
Now sometimes when God is long-suffering with someone else we don't really understand it.

00:14:56.159 --> 00:14:58.919
We might think, why isn't God dealing with them?

00:14:58.919 --> 00:15:03.959
But God is long-suffering and I'm so thankful that we serve a God who's long-suffering.

00:15:03.959 --> 00:15:08.119
Can I tell you that he's more long-suffering than you and he's more long-suffering than

00:15:08.119 --> 00:15:09.119
I am?

00:15:09.119 --> 00:15:10.119
God is long-suffering.

00:15:10.119 --> 00:15:17.879
And the psalmist says this is reason to rejoice, this is reason to declare that God is great.

00:15:17.879 --> 00:15:24.720
At the end of verse number eight, he's a merciful God and notice it says great mercy, great

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:26.000
mercy.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.919
The Bible would reveal to us on a number of occasions that our God is not only gracious

00:15:30.919 --> 00:15:36.359
giving us what we do not deserve, but he's also merciful not giving us what we do deserve.

00:15:36.359 --> 00:15:40.919
Truly what we deserve this morning is separation from God for all of eternity in a place called

00:15:40.919 --> 00:15:41.919
the Lake of Fire.

00:15:41.919 --> 00:15:42.919
Why?

00:15:42.919 --> 00:15:48.479
Because we're all guilty sinners, but God because of his grace and because of his mercy.

00:15:48.479 --> 00:15:52.519
I mentioned that Paul said in 1 Timothy that God, he mentioned about God's grace being

00:15:52.519 --> 00:15:53.519
abundant grace.

00:15:53.759 --> 00:15:58.959
He says in the book of Ephesians in chapter number two that God is rich in mercy.

00:15:58.959 --> 00:16:03.239
What a joy to consider this morning that our God is merciful.

00:16:03.239 --> 00:16:08.639
We find that just a few pages back in your, in the book of Psalms in Psalm 136, I'm not

00:16:08.639 --> 00:16:14.899
going to read it, but you'll notice that throughout Psalm 136 that every verse in Psalm 136 ends

00:16:14.899 --> 00:16:21.239
with this statement, for his mercy endureth forever.

00:16:21.239 --> 00:16:24.279
You think God wants us to understand that truth?

00:16:24.279 --> 00:16:31.319
I mean he repeats it in one Psalm, throughout the Psalm, he repeats it over and over and

00:16:31.319 --> 00:16:32.319
over.

00:16:32.319 --> 00:16:37.319
And by the way, the Psalm begins this way, oh give thanks unto the Lord for he is good,

00:16:37.319 --> 00:16:43.419
for his mercy endureth forever.

00:16:43.419 --> 00:16:48.519
He's of great mercy is what the Psalmist says in Psalm 145 in verse number eight.

00:16:48.519 --> 00:16:51.839
Notice as we continue in verse number nine, the Lord is good.

00:16:51.839 --> 00:16:53.479
Notice where it says to all.

00:16:53.479 --> 00:16:55.879
I'm thankful that God's goodness extends to all people.

00:16:55.879 --> 00:17:00.519
I'm thankful that our God is a God who loves everyone, amen.

00:17:00.519 --> 00:17:04.879
I was reading this morning, as I was reading in my office and doing my personal devotions,

00:17:04.879 --> 00:17:10.879
I was once again reminded of the wonderful, just biblical truth that God loves all of

00:17:10.879 --> 00:17:13.599
humanity, that God is a loving God.

00:17:13.599 --> 00:17:15.079
He's a just God.

00:17:15.079 --> 00:17:18.919
He's a loving God, for God so loved the world.

00:17:18.919 --> 00:17:23.559
God is not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.

00:17:23.559 --> 00:17:26.440
And we find that not all will receive the gift of God.

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:31.579
Not all will receive the gift of eternal life, and they will go to a Christless eternity,

00:17:31.579 --> 00:17:35.679
as I mentioned before, in a place called the Lake of Fire, but it's not because God didn't

00:17:35.679 --> 00:17:40.279
love them, it's not because God didn't want them to be saved, it's because they rejected

00:17:40.279 --> 00:17:42.720
the free gift of salvation.

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:45.720
We find the Bible says that he's good to all.

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:51.000
Notice his tender mercies are over all his works.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.720
Again, we see in verse number nine about God's goodness and about God's mercy.

00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:01.440
As we continue in verse 10, it says, all thy works shall praise thee, O Lord, and thy saints

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:02.440
shall bless thee.

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:09.039
In verse number 11, they shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom and talk of thy power

00:18:09.039 --> 00:18:13.720
to make known to the sons of men his mighty acts and the glorious majesty of his kingdom.

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:19.479
Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion endureth throughout all generations.

00:18:19.479 --> 00:18:24.639
In verses 11 through 13, we see the reference to God's kingdom, and I'm so thankful that

00:18:24.639 --> 00:18:29.519
our God is King of kings and Lord of lords, that he is the great I Am.

00:18:29.519 --> 00:18:32.200
I'm thankful that he has all power.

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:35.760
We read here in these verses of Scripture about the kingdom, God's kingdom being an

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:41.519
everlasting kingdom, and speaking of his dominion enduring throughout all generations.

00:18:41.519 --> 00:18:47.200
We live in a time today where the heathen rage, Psalm 2.

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:48.200
But God rules.

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:52.399
Listen, the heathen can rage, but God rules.

00:18:52.399 --> 00:18:55.159
The Lord God omnipotent ruleth.

00:18:55.159 --> 00:18:59.719
He is on his throne, and we find that one day, listen, Jesus is going to come back.

00:18:59.719 --> 00:19:03.760
We understand the tribulation is going to take place after the rapture of the church,

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:09.039
and then after the tribulation, those seven years of tribulation, God himself is coming

00:19:09.039 --> 00:19:10.320
all the way to earth.

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:13.279
At the rapture, we're going to meet the Lord in the clouds.

00:19:13.279 --> 00:19:18.200
And then at the second coming of Christ, we're going to come back with him, and we're going

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:23.380
to come, and he's going to establish his kingdom upon this earth.

00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:26.399
He will rule and reign for a thousand years.

00:19:26.399 --> 00:19:30.359
It's called the millennial kingdom of Christ, and he's going to rule and reign for a thousand

00:19:30.359 --> 00:19:31.519
years.

00:19:31.519 --> 00:19:37.640
And what a blessing to consider the kingdom and understanding, as David is writing this,

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:39.200
listen, he's a king, is he not?

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:40.559
He's the king of Israel.

00:19:40.559 --> 00:19:46.559
But we understand that he had the promises given, if you think about the Davidic covenant

00:19:46.559 --> 00:19:50.599
and how the Lord Jesus Christ fulfills the Davidic covenant.

00:19:50.599 --> 00:19:56.640
And speaking of the house and the throne and the kingdom and understanding this truth,

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:59.839
and we see here that David is rejoicing.

00:19:59.839 --> 00:20:05.119
and he's speaking about God's greatness, listen, our God is eternal.

00:20:05.119 --> 00:20:10.259
It speaks about here in these verses about being everlasting in the glorious majesty

00:20:10.259 --> 00:20:11.519
of His kingdom.

00:20:11.519 --> 00:20:15.199
And understand, listen, our God has no beginning and no ending.

00:20:15.199 --> 00:20:17.679
That's hard for us to comprehend.

00:20:17.679 --> 00:20:19.519
Every single one of us had a beginning.

00:20:19.519 --> 00:20:20.519
Amen?

00:20:20.519 --> 00:20:22.879
You were born.

00:20:22.879 --> 00:20:25.639
Every one of us will have a physical ending.

00:20:25.639 --> 00:20:29.079
But our God, He lives forever.

00:20:29.079 --> 00:20:30.079
He's eternal.

00:20:30.079 --> 00:20:32.239
No beginning and no ending.

00:20:32.239 --> 00:20:35.919
He says, I am alpha and omega.

00:20:35.919 --> 00:20:37.519
Wow.

00:20:37.519 --> 00:20:41.719
Can you understand why the psalmist was so convinced of God's greatness?

00:20:41.719 --> 00:20:47.059
Can you understand this morning why he was so confident that my God is great?

00:20:47.059 --> 00:20:51.039
And because He's great, He is greatly to be praised.

00:20:51.039 --> 00:20:55.199
Notice as we continue in verse number 14, notice the Bible says, the Lord upholdeth

00:20:55.199 --> 00:21:00.099
all that fall, and raiseth up all those that be bowed down.

00:21:00.099 --> 00:21:04.839
We see in verse number 14 that our God sustains.

00:21:04.839 --> 00:21:07.359
I'm thankful that He sustains us.

00:21:07.359 --> 00:21:11.439
I'm thankful at the end of verse number 14 when it talks about, and raiseth up all those

00:21:11.439 --> 00:21:15.159
that be bowed down, I'm thankful that He's a restoring God.

00:21:15.159 --> 00:21:16.159
He restores.

00:21:16.159 --> 00:21:23.039
You think about Psalm 23, a psalm that is very familiar to us, He restoreth my soul.

00:21:23.039 --> 00:21:26.919
You think about the fact that our God, He sustains.

00:21:26.919 --> 00:21:28.519
He restores.

00:21:28.519 --> 00:21:34.759
Verse 15, the eyes of all wait upon Thee, and Thou givest them their meat in due season.

00:21:34.759 --> 00:21:41.959
Thou openest Thine hand and satisfyest the desire of every living thing.

00:21:41.959 --> 00:21:44.359
You know our God provides.

00:21:44.359 --> 00:21:45.979
He provides.

00:21:45.979 --> 00:21:46.979
He provides.

00:21:46.979 --> 00:21:50.879
You say, well, I get my, you know, God provides.

00:21:51.719 --> 00:21:55.879
Remember, we're studying the book of Genesis through the end portion there as we're nearing

00:21:55.879 --> 00:22:00.879
the end of the book of Genesis, and you see about that great famine, right?

00:22:00.879 --> 00:22:04.879
There were seven years of great plenty, but then there was dearth in the land.

00:22:04.879 --> 00:22:05.879
There was a great famine.

00:22:05.879 --> 00:22:08.479
What was the result of that?

00:22:08.479 --> 00:22:12.439
God withholding, right?

00:22:12.439 --> 00:22:15.599
God's the one who sends the rain.

00:22:15.599 --> 00:22:23.239
God's the one that provides for all of His creation, and we find that here this morning,

00:22:23.239 --> 00:22:26.399
we recognize that God is our provider.

00:22:26.399 --> 00:22:32.039
So often as a man, as a husband, as a father, personally, I think about the responsibility

00:22:32.039 --> 00:22:37.519
of being a provider for my family, and certainly that's a biblical truth and responsibility,

00:22:37.519 --> 00:22:43.239
but I often try to remind my family that truly it's God who is the provider, and God has

00:22:43.239 --> 00:22:49.039
given me the opportunity to fulfill that role for my family, but ultimately it's God

00:22:49.039 --> 00:22:51.559
doing that providing.

00:22:51.559 --> 00:22:53.559
He's the provider.

00:22:53.559 --> 00:22:57.479
Notice in verse 17, the Lord is righteous.

00:22:57.479 --> 00:23:02.359
Notice what it says, in all His ways.

00:23:02.359 --> 00:23:05.519
We find that it, we mentioned already at the end of verse number seven, it talks about

00:23:05.519 --> 00:23:06.919
sing of thy righteousness.

00:23:06.919 --> 00:23:12.679
We mentioned about the fact that God is righteous, but notice it says the Lord is righteous in

00:23:12.799 --> 00:23:15.999
all His ways.

00:23:15.999 --> 00:23:17.959
He didn't say some of His ways.

00:23:17.959 --> 00:23:19.839
He didn't say most of His ways.

00:23:19.839 --> 00:23:21.719
He said all His ways.

00:23:21.719 --> 00:23:23.239
God always does what's right.

00:23:23.239 --> 00:23:28.359
Have you ever heard somebody say, why do good, bad things happen to good people?

00:23:28.359 --> 00:23:33.519
You've heard people say that kind of thing, and they try to bring a charge against our

00:23:33.519 --> 00:23:34.519
God.

00:23:34.519 --> 00:23:39.439
They try to question His goodness and His righteousness, but understand this morning

00:23:39.439 --> 00:23:42.039
that our God doeth all things well.

00:23:42.039 --> 00:23:46.879
Understand this morning that the Lord is righteous in all His ways.

00:23:46.879 --> 00:23:51.639
And by the way, you don't have to understand why God does what God does.

00:23:51.639 --> 00:23:53.639
He's God.

00:23:53.639 --> 00:23:54.759
He's God.

00:23:54.759 --> 00:23:55.759
You know what I'm thankful for?

00:23:55.759 --> 00:24:02.959
I mean, overwhelmed with gratitude that so often God in His word has given us truth that

00:24:02.959 --> 00:24:07.319
helps us understand why He works the way that He does.

00:24:08.039 --> 00:24:13.559
He doesn't always do that, and we have circumstances and things that we may face, but we can rest

00:24:13.559 --> 00:24:20.239
assured in the fact of knowing that God doeth all things well.

00:24:20.239 --> 00:24:23.199
That the Lord is righteous in all His ways.

00:24:23.199 --> 00:24:26.959
You have something that happens in your life, and you begin to question, listen, that's

00:24:26.959 --> 00:24:31.079
the enemy trying to get you to question the goodness and righteousness of God.

00:24:31.079 --> 00:24:36.239
But we rest on a Bible truth like we find here in Psalm 145 and verse 17 saying, no,

00:24:36.239 --> 00:24:39.079
I'm not going to entertain those thoughts for a second, for a moment.

00:24:39.079 --> 00:24:40.079
Why?

00:24:40.079 --> 00:24:45.319
Because the Lord is righteous in all His ways.

00:24:45.319 --> 00:24:51.839
You know, God has taught me and God has taught a number of people, Bible characters we could

00:24:51.839 --> 00:24:59.919
go to this morning, valuable lessons through great difficulty, through circumstances that

00:24:59.919 --> 00:25:04.119
quite honestly we would not really desire to have.

00:25:04.119 --> 00:25:07.479
Remember what the psalmist says in Psalm 119, it was good for me to be afflicted.

00:25:07.479 --> 00:25:08.479
Really?

00:25:08.479 --> 00:25:09.479
Yeah.

00:25:09.479 --> 00:25:13.359
Because then I learned thy statutes.

00:25:13.359 --> 00:25:17.599
The psalmist says it was good for me to be afflicted.

00:25:17.599 --> 00:25:22.119
Often we do not take that same approach and that same mindset, but we find that God is

00:25:22.119 --> 00:25:26.919
righteous in all His ways, and He has a purpose and He has a plan.

00:25:26.919 --> 00:25:32.419
I may not always understand what His plan is, but I can rest assured knowing that He

00:25:32.419 --> 00:25:41.219
has a good plan and that His plan is going to ultimately bring honor and glory to Himself.

00:25:41.219 --> 00:25:49.859
Notice with me in verse 18, the end of verse 17, sorry, and holy in all His works.

00:25:49.859 --> 00:25:51.819
We serve a holy God.

00:25:51.819 --> 00:25:59.539
You see the scene in Isaiah 6, the Lord is high and holy, lifted up.

00:25:59.539 --> 00:26:07.779
This train fills the temple, and Isaiah sees this vision of God, and he hears holy, holy,

00:26:07.779 --> 00:26:08.779
holy.

00:26:08.779 --> 00:26:14.779
You read in the book of Revelation as God would give us a preview, if you will, into

00:26:14.779 --> 00:26:21.019
heaven, the throne room of heaven, and what do you see, what do you read as you find there

00:26:21.019 --> 00:26:22.219
that vision?

00:26:22.219 --> 00:26:27.579
Will you read that the angels are there around the throne, holy, holy, holy.

00:26:28.179 --> 00:26:30.059
I'm thankful that our God is holy.

00:26:30.059 --> 00:26:31.779
He's a holy God.

00:26:31.779 --> 00:26:38.019
By the way, because He's a holy God, He's called us to live holy lives.

00:26:38.019 --> 00:26:39.659
Amen?

00:26:39.659 --> 00:26:44.219
In the book of Leviticus is where that truth begins, when He says to His people that they

00:26:44.219 --> 00:26:45.539
are to be holy, why?

00:26:45.539 --> 00:26:49.419
For I, the Lord thy God, am holy.

00:26:49.419 --> 00:26:54.459
We find that that truth is carried on to the New Testament, and the Bible tells us as Peter

00:26:54.459 --> 00:27:01.299
is writing to those believers, he says that we're to be holy in all manner of conversation,

00:27:01.299 --> 00:27:03.299
in every area of our lives.

00:27:03.299 --> 00:27:07.139
There's not a difference for a believer between sacred and secular.

00:27:07.139 --> 00:27:11.659
No, we're to be holy in all manner of conversation, in every area of your life and my life, why?

00:27:11.659 --> 00:27:13.899
Because we serve a holy God.

00:27:13.899 --> 00:27:18.739
Why is it that we'd say this morning that we enter into His presence and we are going

00:27:18.739 --> 00:27:22.539
to worship Him, He's worthy of our worship, but I said this, that we would worship God

00:27:22.539 --> 00:27:25.379
in spirit and in truth.

00:27:25.379 --> 00:27:29.379
You know, all that's called worship is not truly worship this morning.

00:27:29.379 --> 00:27:35.659
Our God is holy, and we must approach Him on the grounds of His holiness and understanding

00:27:35.659 --> 00:27:38.339
that He is a thrice holy God.

00:27:38.339 --> 00:27:45.099
Notice as we look at verse 18, the Bible says, the Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon

00:27:45.099 --> 00:27:50.079
Him, to all that call upon Him in truth.

00:27:50.079 --> 00:27:53.039
He will fulfill the desire of them that fear Him.

00:27:53.039 --> 00:27:56.639
He also will hear their cry and will save them.

00:27:56.639 --> 00:28:01.439
In verse 18 and 19, I see here in these two verses of Scripture, the wonderful truth that

00:28:01.439 --> 00:28:04.119
God hears us when we pray.

00:28:04.119 --> 00:28:05.119
Why is God great?

00:28:05.119 --> 00:28:07.439
Why is the psalmist convinced?

00:28:07.439 --> 00:28:09.439
Why is he confident of God's greatness?

00:28:09.439 --> 00:28:13.959
Well, throughout the Psalms, you can read a number of occasion when David cries out

00:28:13.959 --> 00:28:14.959
to the Lord.

00:28:14.959 --> 00:28:19.159
In fact, so many of our Psalms are just that, they're prayers.

00:28:19.239 --> 00:28:22.239
And David says, God hears me when I pray.

00:28:22.239 --> 00:28:23.239
That's great.

00:28:23.239 --> 00:28:30.279
You know, it's amazing that God can hear every single one of us at the same time praying.

00:28:30.279 --> 00:28:35.039
Within the congregation here this morning, there's not a ton of people here, but even

00:28:35.039 --> 00:28:41.159
within such a crowd this size, there are multiple languages spoken, even amongst those that

00:28:41.159 --> 00:28:43.559
are gathered here this morning.

00:28:43.559 --> 00:28:45.159
You know, each one of us can pray.

00:28:45.159 --> 00:28:48.759
I can only pray in English, it's the only language I know.

00:28:48.759 --> 00:28:52.759
And some of you can pray in English and another language because you speak multiple languages.

00:28:52.759 --> 00:28:55.919
And you know God can hear you?

00:28:55.919 --> 00:28:58.479
He can hear you.

00:28:58.479 --> 00:29:03.839
And if we all decide to pray at the same time, God can hear every single one of us.

00:29:03.839 --> 00:29:07.079
God never says, Tim, not now, I'm busy, I'm listening.

00:29:07.079 --> 00:29:11.479
No, no, no, God hears all of us, it's amazing.

00:29:11.479 --> 00:29:16.279
How many times have you been in a room, maybe in a conversation in some setting somewhere,

00:29:16.279 --> 00:29:19.679
and a couple of people try to start talking to you at the same time?

00:29:19.679 --> 00:29:21.639
You ever have that happen?

00:29:21.639 --> 00:29:27.279
And often when that happens, you say something like this, oh, hold on, one at a time, right?

00:29:27.279 --> 00:29:28.279
Why?

00:29:28.279 --> 00:29:31.079
Because you can only understand one person at a time.

00:29:31.079 --> 00:29:35.239
You're going to miss something from someone.

00:29:35.239 --> 00:29:37.759
Our God is great.

00:29:37.759 --> 00:29:42.599
David says, when I call out to Him, I know that God hears me.

00:29:42.599 --> 00:29:44.599
He hears my cry.

00:29:44.599 --> 00:29:49.839
And I know that my God who hears also answers.

00:29:49.839 --> 00:29:53.039
Understand this morning that God's answer to your prayer isn't always what you might

00:29:53.039 --> 00:29:55.999
think it should look like.

00:29:55.999 --> 00:29:58.319
Amen?

00:29:58.319 --> 00:29:59.839
Sometimes God's answer to your prayer is not what

00:29:59.839 --> 00:30:04.479
you think it should look like. I'll say it again, to help us understand that truth because

00:30:04.479 --> 00:30:11.039
sometimes we pray and then we try to help God understand how He could answer our prayer.

00:30:11.039 --> 00:30:16.319
God would be really nice if you did it this way. Listen, my way is not the best way. I've

00:30:16.319 --> 00:30:22.519
learned that in my life. Your way is not always the best way, but God's way is always the

00:30:22.519 --> 00:30:29.479
best way. You know, sometimes God says no. Sometimes He says no. Sometimes God's answer

00:30:29.479 --> 00:30:35.599
might be delayed. It might be delayed. He's trying to teach us something in the current

00:30:35.599 --> 00:30:41.159
circumstances in which we're... Listen, God is able to do exceeding abundantly above all

00:30:41.159 --> 00:30:46.359
that we ask or think, according to Ephesians 3 and verse number 20. He says to Jeremiah,

00:30:46.359 --> 00:30:51.399
call unto me, and I will answer thee, and show thee great and mighty things which thou

00:30:51.399 --> 00:30:59.999
knowest not. David is rejoicing because God hears. God answers. Notice in verse number

00:30:59.999 --> 00:31:07.439
20, the Lord preserveth all them that love Him, but all the wicked will He destroy. I

00:31:07.439 --> 00:31:12.139
notice in verse number 20 the fact that our God preserves. I'm thankful I have a future

00:31:12.139 --> 00:31:18.119
in heaven. I have a future with God for all of eternity. Why? Because He's mine and I'm

00:31:18.119 --> 00:31:24.359
His. I trusted the Lord Jesus Christ, my personal Savior, some 25 years ago now. It's getting

00:31:24.359 --> 00:31:30.279
26 years ago now. And I placed my faith and trust in the finished work of Christ at Calvary,

00:31:30.279 --> 00:31:33.959
understanding that there was nothing I could do to be saved on my own. There was no merit

00:31:33.959 --> 00:31:39.719
of my own that would earn me salvation. I was a guilty sinner in need of the only Savior,

00:31:39.719 --> 00:31:44.779
the Lord Jesus Christ. And I placed my faith and trust in the death, burial, and glorious

00:31:44.819 --> 00:31:49.379
resurrection of Jesus Christ. And at that moment of time, I didn't understand all of

00:31:49.379 --> 00:31:54.999
this at that moment, but at that very moment, God saved my soul. I understood that part.

00:31:54.999 --> 00:31:58.699
But He said that I was a child of His. He says that I was adopted into His family. I

00:31:58.699 --> 00:32:03.859
became an heir, a joint heir with Jesus Christ. I had His righteousness imputed upon me. I

00:32:03.859 --> 00:32:09.579
have a future in heaven. Why? Because He preserves. He said this, my sheep hear my voice and I

00:32:09.579 --> 00:32:16.579
know them and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish. He said in the

00:32:17.019 --> 00:32:22.779
book of 1 Peter that we are kept by the power of God. We have an inheritance that's reserved

00:32:22.779 --> 00:32:29.619
in heaven for us. It's undefiled. It's uncorruptible. I mean, it's reserved for us. He preserves.

00:32:29.619 --> 00:32:33.779
I'm so thankful this morning to have a home in heaven. I wonder, do you know for sure

00:32:33.779 --> 00:32:38.979
that heaven is your home this morning? Have you had that confidence, you've had that time

00:32:38.979 --> 00:32:43.979
in your life, that moment when you trust that Christ is your Savior? The Bible uses

00:32:43.979 --> 00:32:48.299
the term to be born again. Tim and I were knocking doors several weeks ago now, maybe

00:32:48.299 --> 00:32:53.859
a couple of months ago, and this lady that was there at the door as we spoke with her,

00:32:53.859 --> 00:32:57.379
she said, you know, it's funny that you're here. I have a cousin that's recently been

00:32:57.379 --> 00:33:03.379
talking about being born again. She said, I have no idea what that means. I said, man,

00:33:03.379 --> 00:33:08.739
I was excited at that moment. I said, man, praise the Lord. We got us an opportunity

00:33:08.739 --> 00:33:14.539
here. Amen? And I said, well, ma'am, that is a Bible word, a Bible phrase to be born

00:33:14.539 --> 00:33:19.899
again. I said, if I could take a few moments and take the Bible and show you where Jesus

00:33:19.899 --> 00:33:23.939
uses that term born again and what it means, would you be interested in taking a look at

00:33:23.939 --> 00:33:27.179
that? She's like, oh yeah, I have no idea what that means. So, man, we went to John

00:33:27.179 --> 00:33:32.619
chapter number three. Nicodemus comes to Jesus by night. And Jesus says, marvel not that

00:33:32.619 --> 00:33:37.339
I said to thee, you must be born again. Here's what it means. And I began to explain to her

00:33:37.339 --> 00:33:41.179
what it means to be born again. I wish that Vicki trusted Christ as her Savior that day,

00:33:41.179 --> 00:33:48.099
but she did not. She rejected. But understand this morning that to be born again is not

00:33:48.099 --> 00:33:53.059
a process. It's a miracle of a moment. It's recognizing that you're a sinner in need of

00:33:53.059 --> 00:34:05.659
the only Savior and coming to Christ alone. You're the only Savior and I trust you. I'm

00:34:05.659 --> 00:34:12.419
placing my faith and trust in you alone. Lord, save me. The Bible says we're born again.

00:34:12.419 --> 00:34:19.059
Wonderful, wonderful Bible truth. The psalmist, in Psalm 145, as we walk through this psalm,

00:34:19.059 --> 00:34:25.219
the psalmist is convinced, he's confident that his God, our God, is great. I wonder

00:34:25.219 --> 00:34:31.259
this morning, are you convinced of God's greatness? Are you confident this morning that God is

00:34:31.259 --> 00:34:35.699
great? If you were challenged this morning, if you were challenged this week, somebody

00:34:35.699 --> 00:34:41.459
said to you, oh, you believe God is great? Tell me why God is great. How much evidence

00:34:41.459 --> 00:34:46.939
could you give to support your claim that God is great? We see in the psalm, I mean,

00:34:46.939 --> 00:34:51.979
in Psalm 145, it's not exhaustive. Why is it not exhaustive? Well, remember, his greatness

00:34:51.979 --> 00:34:56.739
is unsearchable. David's providing us with a little glimpse. Notice, that was our first

00:34:56.739 --> 00:35:01.499
point. I only have three points and the next two are pretty short, so we're in good shape.

00:35:01.499 --> 00:35:07.019
Number two this morning, in Psalm 145, we find, number one, that the psalmist is convinced,

00:35:07.019 --> 00:35:12.299
he's confident of God's greatness. But number two this morning, the psalmist is committed

00:35:12.379 --> 00:35:19.379
to declaring God's greatness. He's committed to it. I begin to notice in this psalm, Psalm

00:35:20.059 --> 00:35:25.139
145, these I will statements. You begin to think about these statements when the psalmist

00:35:25.139 --> 00:35:31.259
says I will, and they're declarative statements. They're statements of purpose, of commitment.

00:35:31.259 --> 00:35:37.379
When you say to somebody, I will do this, maybe you've heard somebody say, I'll try.

00:35:37.499 --> 00:35:43.499
I saw a sign, Holly and I were at a restaurant several, it was a while ago, there was a sign

00:35:43.499 --> 00:35:48.379
in the restaurant that said, there is no try, there is do or don't. And I thought, well,

00:35:48.379 --> 00:35:52.219
that's putting it right there, amen? But the reality is that here, the psalmist doesn't

00:35:52.219 --> 00:35:59.219
say, I will try to do this. He says, I will. I will. That's a purposed statement. That

00:36:00.219 --> 00:36:07.219
is a statement that requires us to be very calculated in how we will fulfill what we

00:36:08.279 --> 00:36:13.479
have declared that we will do. The psalmist every day, after he makes the statement of

00:36:13.479 --> 00:36:18.479
I will, and there are several of them, we'll look at them quickly, when he makes this commitment

00:36:18.479 --> 00:36:24.599
to the Lord, he has to be very calculated in how he will live his life. Why? Because

00:36:24.619 --> 00:36:29.819
he's made some declarative statements, he's purposed to do some things in his life. It's

00:36:29.819 --> 00:36:34.539
said of D.L. Moody that he made a commitment to God that every day of his life he would

00:36:34.539 --> 00:36:39.459
not pillow his head before he had the opportunity to share the gospel with at least one person

00:36:39.459 --> 00:36:43.979
every day of his life. Many people ask the question, why did D.L. Moody see so many people

00:36:43.979 --> 00:36:50.979
trust Christ as his Savior? Because he planted so much seed. He preached the gospel. And

00:36:51.039 --> 00:36:55.599
he said, I will not pillow my head in the evening until I've shared the gospel with

00:36:55.599 --> 00:36:59.199
at least one person. It's said that on one particular day of his life he had a super

00:36:59.199 --> 00:37:05.039
busy day. Can any of us relate? He went through that day and all of the busyness and all of

00:37:05.039 --> 00:37:08.959
the things that took place, and as he was ready to, as they would use the word in that

00:37:08.959 --> 00:37:13.839
time frame, retire, he was ready to go to his bed and go to sleep that evening, he was

00:37:13.839 --> 00:37:18.319
reminded of the fact that on that particular day he had not yet shared the gospel with

00:37:18.319 --> 00:37:25.219
anyone. So he left his home late at night in the darkness of the night in Chicago, left

00:37:25.219 --> 00:37:31.639
his home to find someone that he could share the gospel with. And that's somebody that's

00:37:31.639 --> 00:37:39.079
committed to what he has promised God to do. Here the psalmist is committed to declare

00:37:39.079 --> 00:37:45.599
the greatness of God. Notice in verse number one the Bible says, I will extol thee. That

00:37:45.619 --> 00:37:52.579
word extol means to magnify, to lift up, to exalt. And here David says, I will extol thee,

00:37:52.579 --> 00:37:59.079
my God, O King. Notice another I will statement in verse number one, I will bless thy name

00:37:59.079 --> 00:38:05.759
forever and ever. Now think about this, as David would say this, not only the idea of

00:38:05.759 --> 00:38:10.839
during his life here upon earth, but even as he understood, I will dwell in the house

00:38:10.839 --> 00:38:15.639
of the Lord forever, Psalm 23 and verse number six, that you and I this morning, listen,

00:38:15.639 --> 00:38:25.639
we will praise God forever, but forever should start today. In eternity, we're going to praise

00:38:25.639 --> 00:38:29.999
God. You just read the book of Revelation, we're going to praise him. But that praising

00:38:29.999 --> 00:38:34.739
should start now. David says, I will bless thy name forever and ever. Notice in verse

00:38:34.739 --> 00:38:38.999
number two, it doesn't say I will, it says will I, but it's the same kind of concept

00:38:38.999 --> 00:38:44.539
and thought. In verse number two, every day will I bless thee. So he says, I will bless

00:38:44.539 --> 00:38:49.719
thy name forever and ever, but notice the specific in verse number two, every day will

00:38:49.719 --> 00:38:55.299
I bless thee. I wonder this morning in our lives, are we blessing the Lord? Are we lifting

00:38:55.299 --> 00:39:02.519
up and exalting his name every single day? Verse two continues, and I will praise thy

00:39:02.519 --> 00:39:11.999
name forever and ever. Wow. Here's what David says, I'm going to do. I will do these things.

00:39:11.999 --> 00:39:16.819
There's another one that's mentioned in verse number five. Notice, he says, I will speak

00:39:16.819 --> 00:39:23.959
of the glorious honor of thy majesty and of thy wondrous works. I will speak is what David

00:39:23.959 --> 00:39:29.399
says in verse number five. He's going to open his mouth. He's going to speak the glorious

00:39:29.399 --> 00:39:35.639
honor of thy majesty and of thy wondrous works, and sometimes in life you say, well,

00:39:35.639 --> 00:39:43.019
no one wants to hear. Go find somebody that wants to hear. Open our mouth and speak the

00:39:43.019 --> 00:39:47.879
glory of God. Notice in verse number six, he says, and men shall speak of the might

00:39:47.879 --> 00:39:56.079
of thy terrible acts, but notice again another I will statement. I will declare thy greatness.

00:39:56.079 --> 00:39:59.479
We use that phrase for our missions conference this year.

00:39:59.479 --> 00:40:02.719
Back in May, great is the Lord and greatly to be praised,

00:40:02.719 --> 00:40:06.319
but then the psalmist says, I will declare thy greatness.

00:40:06.319 --> 00:40:11.319
I think of Paul as he's there, and he's in Athens,

00:40:11.399 --> 00:40:13.479
and he's given, he's stirred up, why?

00:40:13.479 --> 00:40:16.639
Because he sees a city that's wholly given to idolatry,

00:40:16.639 --> 00:40:19.699
and he's moved, and he begins to go and preach,

00:40:19.699 --> 00:40:21.919
and he says that I found this tomb,

00:40:21.919 --> 00:40:24.279
or this idol that you had here

00:40:24.279 --> 00:40:26.839
that was engraved to the unknown God.

00:40:26.839 --> 00:40:28.919
To him declare I unto thee.

00:40:31.159 --> 00:40:34.879
People need to know how great our God is.

00:40:34.879 --> 00:40:36.279
People need to know our God.

00:40:36.279 --> 00:40:37.399
There's a lot of people in our world

00:40:37.399 --> 00:40:40.699
that have a wrong idea about who God is.

00:40:42.639 --> 00:40:45.159
You know who God's chosen to give them

00:40:45.159 --> 00:40:47.159
the truth of who God is?

00:40:47.159 --> 00:40:50.359
Those that know him, us.

00:40:50.359 --> 00:40:53.199
David says, I will declare thy greatness.

00:40:53.199 --> 00:40:55.639
Notice one final statement that he says.

00:40:55.639 --> 00:40:57.119
He doesn't use the word I will,

00:40:57.119 --> 00:41:00.079
but it seems like it's implied in verse number 21,

00:41:00.079 --> 00:41:05.079
when it says, my mouth shall speak the praise of the Lord.

00:41:06.539 --> 00:41:11.239
My mouth shall speak the praise of the Lord.

00:41:12.599 --> 00:41:16.279
This morning, we find that the psalmist is convinced,

00:41:16.279 --> 00:41:20.079
he's confident that God is great.

00:41:20.079 --> 00:41:23.119
We find this morning that the psalmist is committed

00:41:23.119 --> 00:41:25.839
to declaring the greatness of God.

00:41:25.839 --> 00:41:28.919
It's a wonderful thing to know that God is great,

00:41:29.839 --> 00:41:31.199
but it shouldn't end there.

00:41:32.639 --> 00:41:33.919
We should declare that to someone else.

00:41:33.919 --> 00:41:36.879
By the way, I'm thankful that there were some people

00:41:36.879 --> 00:41:39.159
that went before me, that went before you,

00:41:39.159 --> 00:41:42.919
that knew God was great and had the commitment

00:41:42.919 --> 00:41:46.959
that David gives here of telling another generation

00:41:46.959 --> 00:41:50.279
of God's greatness, amen?

00:41:50.279 --> 00:41:52.399
Notice with me number three,

00:41:52.399 --> 00:41:55.959
as we bring it all together and give us this final thought,

00:41:55.959 --> 00:41:59.919
the charge to every believer, the charge to every believer.

00:41:59.919 --> 00:42:03.219
We see there's being convinced and being committed,

00:42:03.219 --> 00:42:06.319
but then there's a charge that is given to every believer.

00:42:06.319 --> 00:42:09.479
Notice in verse number four, the Bible says,

00:42:09.479 --> 00:42:13.599
one generation shall praise thy works to another

00:42:13.599 --> 00:42:16.519
and shall declare thy mighty acts.

00:42:16.519 --> 00:42:18.499
I think about that phrase when the Bible begins

00:42:18.499 --> 00:42:20.519
in verse number four, one generation,

00:42:20.519 --> 00:42:22.279
and here's what I say as I read that.

00:42:23.119 --> 00:42:24.759
I say, that's me, that's us.

00:42:24.759 --> 00:42:27.159
We are one generation that is to invest

00:42:27.159 --> 00:42:28.919
in a future generation.

00:42:28.919 --> 00:42:30.359
How are my children?

00:42:30.359 --> 00:42:31.439
How are your children?

00:42:31.439 --> 00:42:33.079
How are our grandchildren?

00:42:33.079 --> 00:42:34.479
And now I have a grandchild,

00:42:34.479 --> 00:42:36.939
so I can say that as our grandchildren,

00:42:36.939 --> 00:42:41.879
but how can our children, how can future generations know?

00:42:41.879 --> 00:42:44.899
Well, one generation shall praise thy works.

00:42:44.899 --> 00:42:47.479
See, it's good for us to know that God is great,

00:42:47.479 --> 00:42:49.039
but there's another generation.

00:42:49.879 --> 00:42:52.199
There's always another generation,

00:42:53.239 --> 00:42:56.479
and that next generation needs to know that God is great.

00:42:56.479 --> 00:42:59.479
Listen, it's easy for us to sit around this morning

00:42:59.479 --> 00:43:02.159
and look at our beloved nation and see what's taking place

00:43:02.159 --> 00:43:04.119
and saying how things have changed

00:43:04.119 --> 00:43:06.199
and oh, this new generation.

00:43:06.199 --> 00:43:08.959
Listen, it's our duty to reveal to them,

00:43:08.959 --> 00:43:12.879
to declare to them how great God is.

00:43:13.759 --> 00:43:16.399
One generation, that's me, that's you.

00:43:16.439 --> 00:43:18.599
Notice in verse number 10,

00:43:18.599 --> 00:43:22.199
and all thy works shall praise thee, O Lord.

00:43:22.199 --> 00:43:23.559
Notice the end of verse number 10,

00:43:23.559 --> 00:43:26.859
and thy saints shall bless thee.

00:43:28.359 --> 00:43:31.759
If you're saved this morning, you're a saint.

00:43:32.759 --> 00:43:35.019
You're a saint if you're saved this morning.

00:43:35.019 --> 00:43:37.239
Christ is in you and you are in him.

00:43:37.239 --> 00:43:38.479
You're a saint.

00:43:38.479 --> 00:43:40.679
That's a Bible definition.

00:43:40.679 --> 00:43:43.239
Don't get mixed up with what the Catholics talk about.

00:43:43.239 --> 00:43:45.879
A saint is a believer, a child of God,

00:43:45.879 --> 00:43:47.959
a saved person.

00:43:47.959 --> 00:43:48.939
That's a saint.

00:43:50.479 --> 00:43:54.819
And he says, all thy saints shall bless thee.

00:43:55.719 --> 00:43:58.439
Again, as I said with verse number four,

00:43:58.439 --> 00:44:01.199
one generation, that's me, that's you.

00:44:01.199 --> 00:44:03.539
Well, in verse number 10, thy saints shall bless thee.

00:44:03.539 --> 00:44:05.679
Again, that's me and that's you

00:44:05.679 --> 00:44:07.379
if you're saved here this morning.

00:44:08.539 --> 00:44:12.439
To speak in verse number 10,

00:44:12.439 --> 00:44:14.319
all thy saints shall bless thee.

00:44:14.319 --> 00:44:19.319
It said earlier, how can we bless the Lord?

00:44:19.319 --> 00:44:20.879
How is it that we do this?

00:44:20.879 --> 00:44:22.479
Well, we speak, we make known,

00:44:22.479 --> 00:44:24.759
as we've seen in verse number 12, to make known.

00:44:24.759 --> 00:44:27.399
As we saw David saying, I will speak,

00:44:27.399 --> 00:44:31.659
and we understand this morning this responsibility

00:44:31.659 --> 00:44:34.079
that you and I have as this generation,

00:44:34.079 --> 00:44:37.079
as his people, as the saints of God.

00:44:37.079 --> 00:44:39.439
And then in verse 21, David said,

00:44:39.439 --> 00:44:41.719
my mouth shall speak the praise of the Lord,

00:44:41.719 --> 00:44:46.159
but notice, and let all flesh bless his holy name

00:44:46.159 --> 00:44:48.719
forever and ever.

00:44:48.719 --> 00:44:51.439
Now, you think about that phrase when it says all flesh,

00:44:51.439 --> 00:44:54.359
because in verse number 10, it said saints.

00:44:54.359 --> 00:44:56.919
But here in verse number 21, it says all flesh.

00:44:56.919 --> 00:44:57.879
You know, this is a biblical truth.

00:44:57.879 --> 00:44:59.479
Turn to the book of Philippians, if you will,

00:44:59.479 --> 00:45:01.959
and I'm gonna close with this this morning.

00:45:01.959 --> 00:45:03.439
And I want you to see

00:45:04.759 --> 00:45:07.199
that all flesh will bless his holy name.

00:45:08.919 --> 00:45:11.279
All flesh will bless his name.

00:45:12.599 --> 00:45:13.679
His holy name.

00:45:15.039 --> 00:45:17.999
In the book of Philippians, in chapter number two,

00:45:17.999 --> 00:45:21.519
the Bible reveals to us in these few verses of Scripture

00:45:21.519 --> 00:45:23.799
the wonderful truth of the incarnation of Christ,

00:45:23.799 --> 00:45:25.359
the time of year that we're celebrating right now,

00:45:25.359 --> 00:45:27.719
when God became flesh.

00:45:29.919 --> 00:45:33.299
But we notice, and I won't read all of it for sake of time,

00:45:33.299 --> 00:45:35.759
but in verse number nine, in verse eight,

00:45:35.759 --> 00:45:37.679
it speaks about him going to the cross

00:45:37.679 --> 00:45:40.719
and how thankful we are for the substitutionary atonement.

00:45:40.719 --> 00:45:42.839
But in verse number nine, we see that the Bible says,

00:45:42.839 --> 00:45:46.039
wherefore God also hath highly exalted him

00:45:46.039 --> 00:45:48.719
and given him a name which is above every name.

00:45:49.599 --> 00:45:54.119
Notice what the Bible says, that at the name of Jesus,

00:45:54.119 --> 00:45:55.599
what does your Bible say?

00:45:55.599 --> 00:46:00.599
Every knee should bow of things in heaven

00:46:00.959 --> 00:46:04.119
and things in earth and things under the earth,

00:46:04.119 --> 00:46:05.559
and that, what does it say?

00:46:05.559 --> 00:46:09.039
Every tongue should confess.

00:46:09.039 --> 00:46:09.879
Confess what?

00:46:09.879 --> 00:46:12.319
That Jesus Christ is Lord

00:46:12.319 --> 00:46:14.119
through the glory of God the Father.

00:46:15.879 --> 00:46:18.319
All flesh will bless his holy name.

00:46:19.119 --> 00:46:20.639
But here's the amazing truth.

00:46:22.319 --> 00:46:25.079
It's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when.

00:46:26.719 --> 00:46:27.839
You've heard me say this before,

00:46:27.839 --> 00:46:30.319
when makes all the difference.

00:46:30.319 --> 00:46:34.379
Every knee will bow and every tongue will confess,

00:46:35.679 --> 00:46:37.359
but when makes all the difference?

00:46:37.359 --> 00:46:41.279
If you bow your knee and confess with your tongue

00:46:41.279 --> 00:46:43.839
the Lord Jesus Christ and trust him as your savior

00:46:43.839 --> 00:46:47.239
before you take your final breath here on earth,

00:46:47.239 --> 00:46:49.839
that means you have a secured home in heaven

00:46:49.839 --> 00:46:53.639
for all of eternity because Christ is your savior.

00:46:53.639 --> 00:46:54.839
You belong to him.

00:46:54.839 --> 00:46:56.399
He made you a son of his.

00:46:57.599 --> 00:46:59.399
If you do not bow your knee,

00:46:59.399 --> 00:47:01.399
if you do not confess with your mouth

00:47:01.399 --> 00:47:03.599
the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal savior

00:47:03.599 --> 00:47:06.239
before you take your final breath here on this earth,

00:47:06.239 --> 00:47:08.359
the Bible tells us that you'll stand before God

00:47:08.359 --> 00:47:10.359
in Revelation chapter number 20.

00:47:10.359 --> 00:47:12.519
The scene in Revelation chapter 20 is,

00:47:12.519 --> 00:47:14.119
honestly, it's a sad scene.

00:47:15.799 --> 00:47:19.239
It's a scene that should cause every child of God to weep,

00:47:19.239 --> 00:47:21.399
the great white throne judgment.

00:47:21.399 --> 00:47:22.999
And the Bible says that all of those

00:47:22.999 --> 00:47:26.039
that did not confess the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:47:26.039 --> 00:47:29.039
all those that are lost, as we'd use that terminology,

00:47:29.039 --> 00:47:31.999
they will stand at that great white throne judgment.

00:47:31.999 --> 00:47:32.879
You know, at that moment,

00:47:32.879 --> 00:47:35.199
they will confess that Jesus is Lord.

00:47:37.039 --> 00:47:38.239
But it will be too late.

00:47:39.199 --> 00:47:41.599
They'll confess it, but it will be too late.

00:47:41.599 --> 00:47:42.959
They'll spend eternity in a lake of fire.

00:47:42.959 --> 00:47:44.199
The Bible says that death and hell

00:47:44.199 --> 00:47:46.719
were cast into the lake of fire.

00:47:48.159 --> 00:47:50.959
Speaks about this being the second death.

00:47:50.959 --> 00:47:55.039
This morning, we see that there's a charge

00:47:55.039 --> 00:47:58.479
for every believer, one generation, his saints.

00:47:58.479 --> 00:48:03.039
Listen, we ought to be actively committed

00:48:03.039 --> 00:48:06.119
to declaring the greatness of God.

00:48:06.999 --> 00:48:10.959
This morning, I know, I have a level of confidence

00:48:10.959 --> 00:48:13.079
this morning that for most of us,

00:48:13.079 --> 00:48:15.879
I don't know every single person that's here this morning.

00:48:15.879 --> 00:48:18.479
There's some folks that I've just met.

00:48:18.479 --> 00:48:20.159
But I think for most of us this morning,

00:48:20.159 --> 00:48:23.159
we are convinced, we're confident that God is great.

00:48:25.439 --> 00:48:26.279
But I wonder this morning,

00:48:26.279 --> 00:48:31.199
how committed are we to declaring his greatness?

00:48:31.199 --> 00:48:32.839
A charge has been given.

00:48:32.839 --> 00:48:36.000
We have a generation, and we have a responsibility.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:40.199
Stephen Trill, with the Lord now, he always used to say this.

00:48:42.479 --> 00:48:47.479
We are the ones that are to reach this generation.

00:48:47.799 --> 00:48:48.639
Why?

00:48:48.639 --> 00:48:51.359
Because we're the ones that are alive that have the truth.

00:48:51.359 --> 00:48:55.399
One generation reaches the next generation.

00:48:55.399 --> 00:48:57.599
What an opportunity God has given us.

00:48:57.599 --> 00:49:01.159
Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised.

00:49:01.199 --> 00:49:03.599
I hope this morning that we're not only convinced,

00:49:03.599 --> 00:49:06.599
but we're committed to declaring the greatness of God.

00:49:06.599 --> 00:49:07.440
Let's pray.

00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:08.519
Father, we love you.

00:49:08.519 --> 00:49:11.039
How we thank you for loving us.

00:49:11.039 --> 00:49:13.760
We thank you this morning that you're a great God,

00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:16.760
that you truly are worthy of our praise.

00:49:19.479 --> 00:49:24.479
I thank you that you've given us so much truth in your word

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.519
that would lead us to the conclusion

00:49:27.519 --> 00:49:29.399
that you're a great God.

00:49:29.399 --> 00:49:31.239
We've experienced in our own lives.

00:49:32.519 --> 00:49:34.839
God, I pray that you would help every believer

00:49:34.839 --> 00:49:37.359
here this morning to be committed

00:49:38.279 --> 00:49:41.000
to declaring your greatness.

00:49:44.599 --> 00:49:46.599
Lord, I pray that if there's one here this morning

00:49:46.599 --> 00:49:47.440
that's not trusted,

00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:50.399
the Lord Jesus Christ is their personal savior.

00:49:50.399 --> 00:49:53.519
They do not know for sure that heaven's their home.

00:49:53.519 --> 00:49:56.359
The thought of being born again is foreign to them.

00:49:56.359 --> 00:49:59.679
I mean, they're desiring to go to heaven.

00:49:59.679 --> 00:50:07.279
heaven. Maybe they've even believed that they could be a good enough person to get to heaven.

00:50:07.279 --> 00:50:13.799
God based upon the authority of your word, there's none righteous, no not one. Salvation

00:50:13.799 --> 00:50:23.319
is not earned by our works. It's a gift that is given to us by you. And Lord if there's

00:50:23.319 --> 00:50:28.839
one here this morning, maybe there's multiple here this morning, that do not know you as

00:50:28.839 --> 00:50:33.319
their personal Lord and Savior. I pray the Holy Spirit of God would convict them and

00:50:33.319 --> 00:50:39.599
convince them. I pray that you'd draw them to yourself even at this moment. God I pray

00:50:39.599 --> 00:50:43.999
that you'd give us an opportunity to take a Bible and show them how they could have

00:50:43.999 --> 00:50:56.279
assurance of heaven. You're a great Savior. You're a wonderful God. You love all people.

00:50:56.279 --> 00:51:00.439
And I know that even if there's one amongst us or that's tuned in via live stream that's

00:51:00.439 --> 00:51:06.719
not sure of heaven, as much of any one of us would desire for them to be saved, you

00:51:06.719 --> 00:51:13.759
desire it more. You're not willing that any should perish, that all should come to repentance.

00:51:13.759 --> 00:51:18.679
God I pray that you'd move and work in this time of invitation. I pray that you'd help

00:51:18.679 --> 00:51:23.479
your people to be doers of the word and not hearers only. Help us to be responsive and

00:51:23.479 --> 00:51:27.759
we'll thank you God for what you'll do. For it's in Christ's name we pray. Would you stand

00:51:27.759 --> 00:51:28.279
with me?
