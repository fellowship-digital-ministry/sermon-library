1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,320
You could turn that down just a tad.

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:02,799
I'd appreciate it, thank you.

3
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:05,639
And in verses one and two, remember he said this,

4
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:08,640
how are they increase that trouble me?

5
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,399
Many are they that rise up against me.

6
00:00:11,399 --> 00:00:13,199
Remember what they were saying of David.

7
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:15,039
They said, according to verse number two,

8
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:18,920
there is no help for him in God.

9
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,159
And so we discovered the situation

10
00:00:22,159 --> 00:00:25,559
in which David was facing, the reality of the situation.

11
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:28,000
It was not something that he was embellishing,

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,520
that he was exaggerating.

13
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,240
It was not something that he was imagining.

14
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,959
This was a real serious situation that he was facing.

15
00:00:35,959 --> 00:00:38,759
We find that it was in 2 Samuel 15,

16
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:42,439
really through chapter 19, that you read about the revolt,

17
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:43,880
the rebellion of Absalom.

18
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,759
And that's the time of the particular writing of this psalm.

19
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:49,639
And we find that in verses three and four,

20
00:00:49,639 --> 00:00:51,319
as we studied last week,

21
00:00:51,319 --> 00:00:55,040
we examined the response of David to the situation.

22
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,200
And so we found the reality of the situation,

23
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,439
but we said, how does he respond to the situation?

24
00:01:00,319 --> 00:01:01,159
The fact of the matter is that each of us

25
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:04,279
have circumstances, situations that we face in life,

26
00:01:04,279 --> 00:01:06,360
trials and troubles and difficulties.

27
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:11,360
And the reality is that our response to that circumstance

28
00:01:11,919 --> 00:01:15,239
or that situation is of utmost importance.

29
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:19,400
How do we deal, how do we respond to the circumstances

30
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,760
in which we're facing?

31
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,160
And as we studied last week, we discovered right away

32
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:28,040
that to summarize the response of David to this situation,

33
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,639
we could simply use one word

34
00:01:29,639 --> 00:01:31,760
and say that it was the word prayer.

35
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,279
David responded by praying.

36
00:01:34,279 --> 00:01:37,239
It's exciting to me that first in his prayer,

37
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:40,639
in verse number three, he rehearsed who it was,

38
00:01:40,639 --> 00:01:43,440
who God was or is to him.

39
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,760
And what a blessing.

40
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,319
Remember, as we mentioned a moment ago,

41
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:48,720
in verse number two, they were saying the enemies,

42
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,959
those that were rising against him,

43
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:55,000
were saying there is no help for him in God.

44
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,599
There is no help for him in God.

45
00:01:56,599 --> 00:02:00,519
But David, as he responds to the situation in prayer,

46
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:05,519
he says, oh Lord, he says, thou art a shield for me.

47
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,319
And what a blessing.

48
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:10,440
The enemy says there's no help for you, not even in God.

49
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,839
And David rehearses, he remembers the fact

50
00:02:13,839 --> 00:02:15,600
that God is his shield.

51
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,559
It's the first reference in the book of Psalms.

52
00:02:17,559 --> 00:02:20,479
There are many references throughout the book of Psalms

53
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:24,360
with regard to the reality that our God is our shield

54
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,279
and our buckler, and he's a strong tower,

55
00:02:27,279 --> 00:02:30,639
he's our fortress, and I'm thankful for the security

56
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:33,960
and the defense that God provides for his children.

57
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,880
We find that David then rejoiced as we finished reading

58
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,559
and examining the portion of scripture last week.

59
00:02:40,559 --> 00:02:42,479
We found that he rejoiced, why?

60
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:44,320
Because God heard him.

61
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,839
And what confidence David had in understanding

62
00:02:47,839 --> 00:02:50,600
that as he prayed, that he prayed to the living God,

63
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,839
to the Lord God Almighty, to the omnipotent Lord,

64
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,759
the creator of heaven and earth,

65
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:59,039
and that he, God, heard his prayer.

66
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:00,479
Isn't that precious?

67
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:03,199
We were reminded of that truth even as we studied

68
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:06,199
on Sunday evening in Genesis chapter 25

69
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:09,279
and we noticed the supplication of Isaac

70
00:03:09,279 --> 00:03:11,520
and then of Rebekah and how we rejoice

71
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,399
in understanding that God hears us when we pray.

72
00:03:15,679 --> 00:03:20,679
We contrasted last week the idols, the works of men's hands

73
00:03:20,679 --> 00:03:23,720
and how the Bible would tell us that they have ears

74
00:03:24,559 --> 00:03:25,639
but they hear not.

75
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:28,919
And I'm thankful that our God is the living God

76
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:31,039
and that he hears us when we pray.

77
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:34,320
This evening as we study verses five and six,

78
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,240
we will examine and understand the rest

79
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,279
that David experienced.

80
00:03:39,279 --> 00:03:41,199
We see the reality of the situation.

81
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:42,759
It was dim, it was difficult,

82
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:45,199
it was a very serious situation.

83
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:47,559
We see the response, it's a response of prayer,

84
00:03:47,559 --> 00:03:49,440
it's a response of rejoicing.

85
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,320
And then this evening we see the rest

86
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,160
that David experienced.

87
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,639
Notice in verse number five,

88
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:57,479
the Bible says, I laid me down and slept.

89
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,960
I awaked for the Lord sustained me.

90
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,399
I will not be afraid of 10,000s of people

91
00:04:05,399 --> 00:04:09,720
that have set themselves against me roundabout.

92
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,919
For this third study through Psalm three,

93
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,759
I've titled the message from verse number five,

94
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:18,119
I laid me down and slept.

95
00:04:18,119 --> 00:04:19,399
I laid me down and slept.

96
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:22,440
We mentioned the reality, we mentioned the response.

97
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,200
Tonight we see the rest that David experienced.

98
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,480
And honestly, as we examine Psalm three,

99
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,239
I hope that just as it's been an encouragement to me

100
00:04:31,239 --> 00:04:34,679
as I've prepared and delivered the messages,

101
00:04:34,679 --> 00:04:36,600
that you too have been encouraged.

102
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,880
But as we look at these verses of Scripture,

103
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,399
I find the impact to be great.

104
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:43,839
I hope that it will have an impact

105
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:45,880
on each of our lives this evening.

106
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,000
My experience far too often, not only personally,

107
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,480
but through ministry and through years

108
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,480
of speaking with folks and praying with folks

109
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,359
and counseling folks is that there are times

110
00:04:57,359 --> 00:04:59,799
in which we understand the circumstances

111
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,559
of the situation that we're dealing with.

112
00:05:01,559 --> 00:05:04,040
And we may even respond properly.

113
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,640
We may respond by praying,

114
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,079
we may respond by taking it to the Lord,

115
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:12,440
but far too often, we do not leave it there.

116
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:16,359
Far too often we respond properly by praying,

117
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:19,000
but then we do not rest in Him.

118
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,200
We continue to worry, we continue to fret,

119
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,600
we continue to try to figure things out.

120
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,160
But we find this evening that in verses five and six,

121
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,559
that this is a beautiful picture and a beautiful example

122
00:05:31,559 --> 00:05:35,679
of taking our burdens to the Lord and leaving them there.

123
00:05:36,679 --> 00:05:41,200
And understanding that we understand who He is.

124
00:05:42,239 --> 00:05:45,119
David just rehearsed that in verse number three.

125
00:05:45,119 --> 00:05:48,160
But thou, O Lord, art a shield for me,

126
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,760
my glory and the lifter up of mine head.

127
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,079
He understood who God was to him.

128
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:56,200
He understood that God heard him.

129
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,279
I cried unto the Lord with my voice

130
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:01,519
and He heard me out of His holy hill, Selah,

131
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:02,359
and then what?

132
00:06:02,359 --> 00:06:04,399
I laid me down and slept.

133
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:05,799
Isn't that amazing?

134
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:08,079
When you read verse one and you read verse number two

135
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:11,839
and you see the situation that David is facing,

136
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:16,679
you see the increase of those that would trouble him

137
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,399
and the many that were rising against him

138
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:21,239
and you understand contextually

139
00:06:21,239 --> 00:06:23,239
as you go back to 2 Samuel 15

140
00:06:23,239 --> 00:06:26,040
and look at all that was taking place

141
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,839
and the size of the rebellion and the revolt

142
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:32,799
and you say, to go from understanding his situation

143
00:06:32,799 --> 00:06:36,760
to laying his head down and going to sleep, wow.

144
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,480
What a rest.

145
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,880
What a great example.

146
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,279
He went to sleep.

147
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:45,959
I believe that it's a great picture of the peace of God.

148
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,519
There's no sleepless night for David.

149
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:51,399
No, we look at this passage of Scripture

150
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:54,119
and we understood that David took his need

151
00:06:54,119 --> 00:06:57,440
to the only one that could do something about it.

152
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,519
He took it to the Creator of heaven and earth.

153
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:01,679
He took it to the Lord God omnipotent.

154
00:07:01,679 --> 00:07:03,040
He poured out his heart.

155
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:07,279
He says, I cried unto the Lord with my voice.

156
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:09,679
In understanding that God heard him,

157
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,760
he laid down and went to sleep.

158
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,119
I love it.

159
00:07:14,119 --> 00:07:15,839
It's so impactful.

160
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,119
Why, because far too often we don't live there.

161
00:07:19,119 --> 00:07:20,600
I'm just being honest tonight.

162
00:07:21,799 --> 00:07:24,760
Far too often we don't live there.

163
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,799
We take it to God and we continue to worry and fret

164
00:07:27,799 --> 00:07:30,160
and we continue to try to figure things out,

165
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,839
but we find that he went to sleep.

166
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:36,160
See, worry will not change one thing of your circumstance.

167
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,160
It really won't.

168
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,920
Someone said this, everything I've ever worried about

169
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,399
never came to pass.

170
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,920
And so worry works.

171
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,720
No, no, worry doesn't work.

172
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,600
It's just that the things you worried about didn't happen.

173
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,519
And often we find that to be the case.

174
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:50,519
Isn't it true?

175
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:51,480
We worry about things.

176
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,119
Someone said this worry is like a rocking chair.

177
00:07:54,119 --> 00:07:56,720
It'll keep you busy, but it won't get you anywhere.

178
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:00,119
How many of you have a rocking chair?

179
00:08:00,119 --> 00:08:02,160
You know, you just sit there and rock, right?

180
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,519
Kind of get the picture of the folks

181
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:05,920
sitting on the front porch, sipping the sweet tea,

182
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,200
and they're not getting anywhere off that front porch.

183
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,600
They're just, it keeps them busy.

184
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,920
It keeps them doing something,

185
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,559
but they're not getting anywhere.

186
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:17,320
So often in our lives, we worry,

187
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,519
and we say that as we think about worry,

188
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:22,760
the fact that it will not change the situation,

189
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,519
but I would submit to you this evening,

190
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:28,600
that worry also reveals in us a lack of faith.

191
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,799
It really does.

192
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:34,039
When we worry about the circumstances,

193
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:38,200
about the situation, we're revealing that we're

194
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,799
really not sure that God's able to take care of it.

195
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,520
Right?

196
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,599
Turn to the book of Philippians.

197
00:08:44,599 --> 00:08:46,640
Keep your place here in Psalm 3,

198
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,119
and look over the book of Philippians.

199
00:08:48,119 --> 00:08:50,479
We're familiar with the passage of scripture

200
00:08:50,479 --> 00:08:53,000
in Philippians chapter number four,

201
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,280
and we know that the picture often throughout

202
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:01,039
the scriptures in here in Psalm 3 is one such example

203
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:03,640
of this truth that we read in Philippians 4,

204
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,400
and there are many that we could go to,

205
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,840
but this evening we'll just stick to Psalm 3,

206
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:11,080
but I want you to see how that Psalm 3

207
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:16,080
really shows us the working of the truth in Philippians 4.

208
00:09:16,479 --> 00:09:19,119
Notice in Philippians 4 in verse number six,

209
00:09:20,239 --> 00:09:21,919
be careful for nothing.

210
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:25,119
We're not to be full of care.

211
00:09:25,119 --> 00:09:28,520
It doesn't mean be careful, like watch your step,

212
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:32,320
be careful, that's not the idea of the phraseology

213
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,400
when you understand the English,

214
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,119
and you understand he's saying don't worry about things.

215
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,320
Be careful for nothing.

216
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,479
Do not be full of care.

217
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:42,440
Have no anxiety.

218
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,200
Be not anxious.

219
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,039
Be careful for nothing.

220
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:50,840
Notice what he says, but in everything.

221
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:53,039
How?

222
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:56,320
By prayer and supplication.

223
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,320
With thanksgiving, let your requests be not in vain.

224
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,520
made known unto God."

225
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,660
It's a verse that we know.

226
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:10,680
But knowing it doesn't mean we practice it.

227
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,940
Right?

228
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,260
Be careful for nothing.

229
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,600
But in everything,

230
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,360
by prayer and supplication,

231
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,900
with thanksgiving,

232
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,400
let your requests be made known unto God.

233
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,680
And then notice verse 7.

234
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,020
And the peace of God,

235
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,720
which passeth all understanding,

236
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,080
shall keep your hearts and minds

237
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,300
through Christ Jesus.

238
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,720
Do you not see a great peace in David

239
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,320
in Psalm 3 and verse 5?

240
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,120
Laid down and went to sleep.

241
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,360
That's peace.

242
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,720
That's a peace that passeth all understanding.

243
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:53,780
That's a peace in the midst of a great storm.

244
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,360
In great difficulty.

245
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,480
We mentioned as we studied three weeks ago

246
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,360
that the situation that David was facing was real.

247
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,020
It was not a make-believe.

248
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:08,320
It was not an exaggerated situation.

249
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,280
No, this was a real difficulty.

250
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,520
But he went to God in prayer.

251
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,220
He understood who God was.

252
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,920
Who God is.

253
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,480
And he said, therefore,

254
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,280
I'm going to go to sleep.

255
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,740
I've prayed about it.

256
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:24,260
I've gone to God about it.

257
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,060
And I'm going to leave it with Him.

258
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,740
Because God is able.

259
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:30,140
Because God is able.

260
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,540
And me staying up all night

261
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,540
worrying about what Absalom is doing

262
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,720
and how they're scheming

263
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,320
and where they're going to come from

264
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,700
isn't going to do anything whatsoever

265
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,900
to change the situation.

266
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,900
Right?

267
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,180
I'm going to change it.

268
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,280
And so therefore, when we look at our own lives,

269
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,780
when we look at our own situations,

270
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:49,020
and we look at the troubles and the difficulties

271
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,220
in which we deal with,

272
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,460
and we say, listen,

273
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,140
there's nothing that's going to change

274
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:57,300
our circumstances that we're going to do

275
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:01,220
that God is not able to do better.

276
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,060
Because He does all things well.

277
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,020
Amen?

278
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,860
Notice what it says in verse 5.

279
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,740
I laid me down and slept.

280
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,660
And then it says this, I awaked.

281
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:14,420
For the Lord sustained me.

282
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,260
He sustained me.

283
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,620
And we think about the truth this evening

284
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:21,100
that our God is our sustainer.

285
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,980
That He is able to keep us.

286
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,860
That He is able to protect us.

287
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,980
That He is able to provide for us all that we need.

288
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,300
And we sing the song,

289
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,420
He is able, He is able.

290
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:35,260
I know He is able.

291
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,100
Right?

292
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:36,940
We sing it.

293
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:37,940
We know the song.

294
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:41,580
And we sing a great hymn.

295
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,820
He is able to deliver thee.

296
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,380
And as we sing that hymn,

297
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:48,620
often my mind races to the truth

298
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:51,900
of the passage of Scripture in Daniel chapter number six.

299
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:55,780
Remember when Daniel prayed after the writing

300
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:58,180
and Daniel prayed and the Bible says

301
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:01,660
that the response of him seeking the Lord

302
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,660
was the attack of the enemy

303
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:06,460
and he was going to be put into the den of lions.

304
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,700
And we find that Darius comes to him

305
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,620
and Darius says, I know that the Lord

306
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,980
that you serve continually,

307
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,940
I know He is able to deliver thee.

308
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,580
Now in that account in Daniel six,

309
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,420
who slept and who didn't sleep?

310
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:22,940
Daniel slept.

311
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:26,100
But the king didn't sleep.

312
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,500
Right?

313
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,900
And the king didn't sleep

314
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,900
and he comes to Daniel and he says,

315
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:34,620
Daniel, is your God whom you serve continually

316
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,780
able to deliver thee?

317
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:39,300
And Daniel responds, yes.

318
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:42,860
Yes, the Lord is able.

319
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,180
And so this evening,

320
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:47,940
we see this truth where he went to sleep.

321
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,940
He is showing us,

322
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:53,140
he's revealing to us this peace of God that he has.

323
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:53,980
Why?

324
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:56,540
Because he took it to the Lord and he left it there.

325
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,060
And the Lord sustained him.

326
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,620
The Lord kept him.

327
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,340
I want you to see as we continue

328
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,780
and look at verse number six,

329
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:05,300
note the resolve of David.

330
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:08,020
I love the I wills of the Psalms.

331
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,980
In fact, if you want to do a study,

332
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,300
you can go through the entirety of the book of Psalms.

333
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,700
In fact, there are many in just Psalm 119,

334
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,980
but you'll find where the Psalmist

335
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,740
makes these declarative statements,

336
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:19,619
these statements with resolve.

337
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,059
I will do such and such.

338
00:14:22,059 --> 00:14:23,619
I will keep thy commandments.

339
00:14:23,619 --> 00:14:25,580
I will not forget thy commandments.

340
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,140
I will, I will, I will.

341
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:29,899
And we find here that David says,

342
00:14:29,899 --> 00:14:33,540
I will not be afraid.

343
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,740
Now we'll know what he's not going to be afraid of

344
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,020
here in just a moment,

345
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:39,140
but I want you to think and I want you to understand

346
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,420
that in the situation in which David is facing

347
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,300
and the circumstances that we understand

348
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,500
in verses one and two,

349
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:48,460
there was reason to fear from a human perspective.

350
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,020
Correct?

351
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:52,860
And when you understand how David words this

352
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,059
in verse number six,

353
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,580
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

354
00:14:56,580 --> 00:15:00,300
and you have an opportunity to really wrap your mind

355
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:03,140
around the size of the rebellion and the revolt,

356
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:06,260
you find that David is saying, I will not be afraid.

357
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,100
Why?

358
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,740
Because David has some great level of courage,

359
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,779
because David is some manly man with this courage

360
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:14,100
that none of us can understand.

361
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:17,740
No, that's not why he's saying I will not be afraid.

362
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,220
He's saying I will not be afraid.

363
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,059
Why?

364
00:15:20,059 --> 00:15:22,460
Because I've looked to my God

365
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:26,020
and my God is able to do what I cannot do.

366
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,619
And since I've looked to my God

367
00:15:29,619 --> 00:15:33,420
and since I've placed my confidence and my trust in my God,

368
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,380
I will not be afraid.

369
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,260
He has not given us a spirit of fear, right?

370
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,660
Is that not what the New Testament tells us?

371
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,860
He's not given us the spirit of fear.

372
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,460
And I want you to consider as David says here,

373
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,740
I will not be afraid.

374
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:52,420
Notice what he says, of 10,000s of people

375
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:59,100
that have set themselves against me roundabout.

376
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,420
That's a situation.

377
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,179
But David says, I'm not gonna fear.

378
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,540
I'm not gonna fear, because my God is greater.

379
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,260
My God is able.

380
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:14,140
And when we think about the peace, the rest of David,

381
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,860
when we find in verse number five,

382
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,940
this rest that he has, where he lays down,

383
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,820
I laid me down and slept,

384
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,740
in the midst of all that's taking place,

385
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:26,380
we see this rest as a result of him taking it to the Lord

386
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,899
in verses three and four,

387
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:30,260
that response to his situation

388
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:34,660
results in this great rest, this great peace.

389
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,779
Can I tell you this evening,

390
00:16:35,779 --> 00:16:37,899
that's where God wants us to be.

391
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:43,540
He wants us to have that peace and that confidence

392
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:48,220
in who He is, in what He is able to do.

393
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:51,779
He does not want us to worry and fret like the unbeliever.

394
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:56,820
I understand when the unbeliever worries and frets.

395
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,179
I understand that they do not have

396
00:16:59,179 --> 00:17:01,540
an understanding of who my God is,

397
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:03,140
and they do not have a relationship

398
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,140
because they've not trusted Christ

399
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,580
as their personal Savior,

400
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:09,540
and therefore, I understand when they worry and fret.

401
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:14,020
But as a child of God, as a believer,

402
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:18,140
when we understand all that He said He was to us

403
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:22,580
and is to us, we ought not worry and fret.

404
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:23,980
Amen?

405
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,540
Because God is able.

406
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:29,260
Notice, look at Psalm 27.

407
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:31,460
We're gonna look at a few Psalms

408
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:34,020
and then look at a passage in the book of Hebrews,

409
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:37,339
and I want you to see in these other references here

410
00:17:37,339 --> 00:17:39,380
in the book of Psalms, Psalm 27,

411
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:43,339
I want you to notice here in these three references

412
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:48,980
the resolve and the statement of not fearing

413
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:51,500
because of understanding who God is.

414
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,580
In Psalm 27, in verse number one,

415
00:17:55,580 --> 00:18:00,580
the Bible says, the Lord is my light and my salvation.

416
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,179
Whom shall I fear?

417
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:08,580
The Lord is the strength of my life.

418
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:12,580
Of whom shall I be afraid?

419
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:17,020
When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes,

420
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,140
came upon me to eat up my flesh,

421
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,300
they stumbled and fell.

422
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,179
Though an host should encamp against me,

423
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:27,300
my heart shall not fear.

424
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,940
Though war should rise against me,

425
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,860
in this will I be confident.

426
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:36,100
One thing have I desired of the Lord,

427
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,419
that will I seek after,

428
00:18:37,419 --> 00:18:39,299
that I may dwell in the house of the Lord

429
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:41,220
all the days of my life,

430
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,820
to behold the beauty of the Lord

431
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:45,979
and to inquire in his temple.

432
00:18:45,979 --> 00:18:47,380
I will not fear.

433
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:51,299
You notice three times he says, of whom shall I fear?

434
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:53,419
Of whom shall I be afraid?

435
00:18:53,419 --> 00:18:56,739
He says in verse three, my heart shall not fear.

436
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:58,859
Why?

437
00:18:58,859 --> 00:19:01,580
Because God is my light and my salvation.

438
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:04,820
Because the Lord is the strength of my life.

439
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,859
Because I understand who he is.

440
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:12,100
And it changes my response to circumstances and situations.

441
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,220
Notice in Psalm 56, and really,

442
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,739
we will not take the time,

443
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:17,580
but we could read the entirety of this Psalm.

444
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,739
It's only 13 verses.

445
00:19:18,739 --> 00:19:20,460
Perhaps you'd like to take the time

446
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:23,340
to do that later this week and read the entirety.

447
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,700
But I'll just pick a few verses here this evening

448
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,820
to help us see what's taking place.

449
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,260
Notice in verse number one,

450
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,220
be merciful unto me, O God,

451
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,940
for man would swallow me up.

452
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,859
He fighting daily oppresseth me.

453
00:19:35,859 --> 00:19:38,500
Mine enemies would daily swallow me up,

454
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,859
for they be many that fight against me.

455
00:19:40,859 --> 00:19:43,900
O thou most high, what time I am afraid,

456
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,820
I will trust in thee.

457
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:48,179
In God, I will praise his word.

458
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:50,700
In God, I have put my trust.

459
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,020
I will not fear what flesh can do unto me.

460
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:54,859
Why?

461
00:19:55,859 --> 00:19:57,979
Because in God, I have put my trust.

462
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,260
Every day, he says in verse number five,

463
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:06,500
rest my words, all their thoughts are against me for evil, they gather

464
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:12,140
themselves together, they hide themselves, they mark my steps when they wait for my

465
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:20,540
soul." Wow. Verse 8, thou tellest my wanderings, put thou my tears into thy

466
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:24,780
bottle, are they not in thy book when I cry unto thee? Notice in verse number 9,

467
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:32,940
when I cry unto thee, then shall mine enemies turn back, this I know. Notice

468
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:40,540
this last phrase of verse number 9, for God is for me. Isn't that good? God is for me.

469
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:45,580
Oftentimes we want to say, you know, who's on God's side or however we want to

470
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:50,380
look at something like that. We see that the psalmist here is declaring the

471
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:54,140
circumstances in which they're facing and dealing with all that's taking place

472
00:20:54,140 --> 00:21:00,460
and he says here in verse number 9, I know, this I know. See, God wants us to be

473
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:08,580
confident of who he is to us. He says, this I know, for God is for me. If God

474
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:14,700
be for us, who shall be against us? Greater is he that is in you than he

475
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:21,740
that is in the world. And we find that the reality of God's Word, again, we've

476
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:26,980
said this over the years, it's not just a book of theory, it's a book of practice.

477
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:32,500
When we understand and we study the Scriptures and we understand who he is

478
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:38,060
and who he is to me and we rejoice in that and we rehearse that and we

479
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:43,260
remember that, then when the day of adversity comes, our strength has been

480
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:48,780
increased. It's not small. We will not faint. Why? Because we know who he is and

481
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:57,260
we have confidence in him. We've put our trust in him. Notice in Psalm 118. In

482
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:13,100
Psalm 118, in verse number 6, notice it says, the Lord is on my side. I will not

483
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:19,700
fear. What can man do unto me? You understand that man can only do to you

484
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:28,020
what God would let him? Remember Job? Satan wanted to go after Job, but Satan

485
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:34,020
was limited in what he could do to Job, right? You read Job and you understand

486
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:39,340
that there were limitations placed upon what Satan could and could not do to

487
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:48,260
Job. Everything that happens in our life goes through God's filter. Everything. And

488
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:53,020
he has a purpose for it. I was chatting with one of the pastors yesterday. He wasn't

489
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:55,460
able to make it to the meeting and I just called him to encourage him. He's

490
00:22:55,460 --> 00:23:00,020
starting a church and just kind of new at it and so on and so forth and they're

491
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,660
doing well and he wasn't able to make it so I called him to just try to

492
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:07,620
encourage him and dealing with some some obstacles and what-have-you and he made

493
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:11,220
this statement. He said, but we know and we're confident of this that

494
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:17,460
everything that God does is for our good. And I said, and for His glory. And that's

495
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:23,620
true. It's biblical truth. Everything that God allows. Remember the truth of Romans

496
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:29,460
828. Oftentimes we don't quote the beginning when it says, and we know that

497
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:32,500
all things work together for good to them who love God, to them who are the

498
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:36,940
called according to His purpose. And it starts by saying, and we know because God

499
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:41,820
wants us to know that. He wants us to have confidence in that. Hebrews 13 and

500
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:47,140
verses 5 and 6, the Bible tells us in that portion of Scripture that God will

501
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:51,340
never leave us nor forsake us and what great truth and great promise that is.

502
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:56,820
But you understand with a promise such as that, there's an impact. And the impact

503
00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:01,580
is really revealed to us as we look at this passage. He says, let your

504
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:05,740
conversation, and in Hebrews 13 and verse number 5, let your conversation be

505
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:10,380
without covetousness and be content with such things as ye have. For he hath

506
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:16,700
said, I will never leave thee nor forsake thee, so that we may boldly say, the Lord

507
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:23,339
is my helper and I will not fear what man shall do unto me. What was it that

508
00:24:23,339 --> 00:24:28,740
they said, the enemies, in verse number 2 of Psalm 3? There's no help for him in

509
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:37,980
God. But David said, Lord, thou art a shield for me. And he went to sleep

510
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:44,500
because he was resting. He had peace. Isaiah 26, it's a familiar verse of

511
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:50,260
Scripture in verse 3 where the Bible talks about the the peace that God

512
00:24:50,260 --> 00:25:01,180
offers us and that perfect peace. Verses 3 and 4 of Isaiah 26 are precious verses

513
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:11,100
of Scripture. It tells us this, thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is

514
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:18,460
stayed on thee. Where's our mind? You know, oftentimes when we deal with adversity

515
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:26,220
and trouble and difficulty, the battle's in our mind. I've said to people over the

516
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:31,580
years, how much of what you're thinking about passes through the filter of

517
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:36,100
Philippians 4.8. Philippians 4.8, whatsoever things are true and honest and

518
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:40,220
pure and so on and so forth, think on these things, right? The battle for our

519
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:46,580
mind, so often what's happening is our mind is not stayed on thee, on the Lord.

520
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:51,940
We're too focused on our problem and on the situation, on the trial. Remember we

521
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:56,180
mentioned that last week when we talked about the response of David. Yes, this is

522
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:59,540
the situation, but I'm gonna look to God. I will lift up my eyes unto the hills

523
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:02,860
from whence cometh my help. And we find that he says, my help cometh from the

524
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:06,779
Lord which made heaven and earth. And it says this, thou will keep him in perfect

525
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:14,580
peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusteth in thee. Verse 4,

526
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:24,420
trust ye in the Lord forever for in the Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength.

527
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:29,900
Man, I need that perfect peace. That perfect peace comes as a result of

528
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:37,020
trusting him, of keeping my mind stayed on him. This evening we think about the

529
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:42,260
the truth of Psalm 3. There was a real situation, the reality is given to us in

530
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:46,940
verses 1 and 2. The response is exemplary. It's a response of prayer, of

531
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:54,140
rehearsing who God is to me. David is understanding that he is a shield for me,

532
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:58,660
that he is my glory, that he is the lifter up of mine head, and he's not

533
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:05,540
going to fear. He lays down, he has peace, he has rest. I thought about this tonight

534
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:10,160
as I was, actually this afternoon, as I was just kind of meditating and reviewing

535
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:14,480
the notes for the message, I don't know, 3 or 4 o'clock this afternoon, just kind

536
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:19,640
of reviewing and meditating on the message for this evening. And as I was, I

537
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:26,080
was thinking about this subject of faith and trust, and how we are to trust God in

538
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:30,960
all situations, and how so often we take something to the Lord but then we

539
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:37,360
continue to have worry or concern. And we've learned how to use the vernacular

540
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,640
where we won't say I'm worried, we'll just say I'm concerned about this, and

541
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,880
I'm concerned about that, because we know we shouldn't use the word worry, and we

542
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,400
just try to, you know, Christianize it a little bit, make it sound better. But I

543
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:54,200
thought about this, and I know it's probably not a perfect illustration, but

544
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,720
it's what the Lord gave me as I was praying about it and just thinking about

545
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:01,360
it. And here was the the illustration I thought about. How many of you ever have

546
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:08,040
mailed a letter, mail a letter in the Postal Service, put the address on it, put

547
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:13,000
a stamp on it, you put it in the mailbox? How many of you worry about it for the

548
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:22,320
next five days until it gets delivered? Dean, liar. I don't, I don't worry about

549
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:29,279
it. I put it in the mailbox, and quite honestly, I just kind of forget about it,

550
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:36,000
right? But guess what I'm doing? I'm trusting a whole lot of people to get

551
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,640
that envelope from wherever I put it in a box to wherever it's supposed to go.

552
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,919
Now let me ask you this, how many of you ever mailed something that didn't get

553
00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:52,400
delivered? I have. So you know what that tells me? The Post Office, the United

554
00:28:52,400 --> 00:29:04,040
States Postal Service has, on more than one occasion, failed me. But I still take

555
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:11,760
a letter and mail it, and don't worry about it when I do. God has never failed

556
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:23,600
me one time. Not once. But there are times that I take something to God, and I cast

557
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:32,960
my burden, but then I keep worrying about it, as if He is not dependable, as if He

558
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:38,440
is not trustworthy. Again, I know it's not a perfect illustration, but it was

559
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:42,640
impactful to me in my office this afternoon, because I can't tell you how

560
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:49,080
many times I've dropped a letter, a card, in the mail, and never thought about it

561
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:58,359
again. And I'm putting a level of confidence, of faith, of trust, in a bunch

562
00:29:58,359 --> 00:30:01,359
of people to get a letter from wherever I put it.

563
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:09,799
God dropped it off to wherever it's supposed to go, but God, God's never going to fail.

564
00:30:09,799 --> 00:30:16,479
He is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think.

565
00:30:16,479 --> 00:30:17,479
He's never failed.

566
00:30:17,479 --> 00:30:21,999
He's never said, oh, I wasn't supposed to do that.

567
00:30:21,999 --> 00:30:24,999
No, never.

568
00:30:24,999 --> 00:30:25,999
He is dependable.

569
00:30:25,999 --> 00:30:27,479
He is trustworthy.

570
00:30:27,479 --> 00:30:32,739
And when we understand that, we can do what David did.

571
00:30:32,739 --> 00:30:36,599
We can lay down and go to sleep.

572
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:40,999
We can have rest and we can have peace.

573
00:30:40,999 --> 00:30:42,159
Why?

574
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:50,799
Because I know that God is able and I know that he doeth all things well.

575
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:55,999
And me sitting up and worrying about it and fretting about it isn't going to change it.

576
00:30:55,999 --> 00:31:00,079
And if Dean's worried about his letter getting delivered by the post office, he's going to

577
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:03,759
have to drive it himself, right?

578
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:04,759
Because that's what we would do.

579
00:31:04,759 --> 00:31:07,439
We just go ahead and take it ourselves.

580
00:31:07,439 --> 00:31:09,799
Because you worry about it, you don't even know where it is.

581
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:14,159
I don't know how it gets from one place to another.

582
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:24,639
But I know that God has given us promises upon promises upon promises, and he's trustworthy.

583
00:31:24,639 --> 00:31:27,759
He laid down and he went to sleep.

584
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:28,759
Wow.

585
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:29,759
Impactful.

586
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:30,759
Precious.

587
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:33,559
Lord, we love you.

588
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:36,559
We thank you for loving us.

589
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:42,199
I thank you for the rest that David experienced.

590
00:31:42,199 --> 00:31:43,479
I thank you for the resolve.

591
00:31:43,479 --> 00:31:44,959
I will not fear.

592
00:31:44,959 --> 00:31:49,759
God, when we understand who you are to us and we understand the promises that you've

593
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:55,359
given us, we understand your sovereignty, God, there's no reason to fear.

594
00:31:55,359 --> 00:31:57,919
You've not given us a spirit of fear.

595
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:04,579
You desire that we'd have peace and rest.

596
00:32:04,579 --> 00:32:07,719
And this is where you desire for us to live.

597
00:32:07,719 --> 00:32:14,939
I know that we deal with situations with opposition and difficulty.

598
00:32:14,939 --> 00:32:19,379
We know that the enemy will say all sorts of things, even as they said to David.

599
00:32:19,379 --> 00:32:25,539
But God, we trust what you say.

600
00:32:25,539 --> 00:32:28,139
And you said that you're our helper.

601
00:32:28,139 --> 00:32:31,659
You said that you'd never leave us nor forsake us.

602
00:32:31,659 --> 00:32:36,499
You said that you're able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think.

603
00:32:36,499 --> 00:32:39,299
God, we believe that.

604
00:32:39,299 --> 00:32:41,779
We trust you.

605
00:32:41,779 --> 00:32:47,779
I pray that you'd help us to be careful for nothing, but that in everything, by prayer

606
00:32:47,779 --> 00:32:53,779
and supplication, with thanksgiving, we would let our requests be made known unto you so

607
00:32:53,779 --> 00:33:00,179
that we might have that peace of God which passeth all understanding.

608
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:03,899
Help us, Lord.

609
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:05,939
Bless our time of prayer.

610
00:33:05,939 --> 00:33:06,939
We'll thank you for it.

611
00:33:06,939 --> 00:33:09,899
In Christ's name we pray, amen.
