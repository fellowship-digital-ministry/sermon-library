00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.320
You could turn that down just a tad.

00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:02.799
I'd appreciate it, thank you.

00:00:02.799 --> 00:00:05.639
And in verses one and two, remember he said this,

00:00:05.639 --> 00:00:08.640
how are they increase that trouble me?

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.399
Many are they that rise up against me.

00:00:11.399 --> 00:00:13.199
Remember what they were saying of David.

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:15.039
They said, according to verse number two,

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:18.920
there is no help for him in God.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.159
And so we discovered the situation

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:25.559
in which David was facing, the reality of the situation.

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:28.000
It was not something that he was embellishing,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.520
that he was exaggerating.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.240
It was not something that he was imagining.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.959
This was a real serious situation that he was facing.

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:38.759
We find that it was in 2 Samuel 15,

00:00:38.759 --> 00:00:42.439
really through chapter 19, that you read about the revolt,

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:43.880
the rebellion of Absalom.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.759
And that's the time of the particular writing of this psalm.

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:49.639
And we find that in verses three and four,

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:51.319
as we studied last week,

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:55.040
we examined the response of David to the situation.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.200
And so we found the reality of the situation,

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.439
but we said, how does he respond to the situation?

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:01.159
The fact of the matter is that each of us

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:04.279
have circumstances, situations that we face in life,

00:01:04.279 --> 00:01:06.360
trials and troubles and difficulties.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.360
And the reality is that our response to that circumstance

00:01:11.919 --> 00:01:15.239
or that situation is of utmost importance.

00:01:15.239 --> 00:01:19.400
How do we deal, how do we respond to the circumstances

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.760
in which we're facing?

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.160
And as we studied last week, we discovered right away

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.040
that to summarize the response of David to this situation,

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.639
we could simply use one word

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:31.760
and say that it was the word prayer.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.279
David responded by praying.

00:01:34.279 --> 00:01:37.239
It's exciting to me that first in his prayer,

00:01:37.239 --> 00:01:40.639
in verse number three, he rehearsed who it was,

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:43.440
who God was or is to him.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.760
And what a blessing.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.319
Remember, as we mentioned a moment ago,

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:48.720
in verse number two, they were saying the enemies,

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.959
those that were rising against him,

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:55.000
were saying there is no help for him in God.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.599
There is no help for him in God.

00:01:56.599 --> 00:02:00.519
But David, as he responds to the situation in prayer,

00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:05.519
he says, oh Lord, he says, thou art a shield for me.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.319
And what a blessing.

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:10.440
The enemy says there's no help for you, not even in God.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.839
And David rehearses, he remembers the fact

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:15.600
that God is his shield.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.559
It's the first reference in the book of Psalms.

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:20.479
There are many references throughout the book of Psalms

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:24.360
with regard to the reality that our God is our shield

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.279
and our buckler, and he's a strong tower,

00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:30.639
he's our fortress, and I'm thankful for the security

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:33.960
and the defense that God provides for his children.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.880
We find that David then rejoiced as we finished reading

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.559
and examining the portion of scripture last week.

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:42.479
We found that he rejoiced, why?

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:44.320
Because God heard him.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.839
And what confidence David had in understanding

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:50.600
that as he prayed, that he prayed to the living God,

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.839
to the Lord God Almighty, to the omnipotent Lord,

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.759
the creator of heaven and earth,

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:59.039
and that he, God, heard his prayer.

00:02:59.039 --> 00:03:00.479
Isn't that precious?

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:03.199
We were reminded of that truth even as we studied

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:06.199
on Sunday evening in Genesis chapter 25

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:09.279
and we noticed the supplication of Isaac

00:03:09.279 --> 00:03:11.520
and then of Rebekah and how we rejoice

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.399
in understanding that God hears us when we pray.

00:03:15.679 --> 00:03:20.679
We contrasted last week the idols, the works of men's hands

00:03:20.679 --> 00:03:23.720
and how the Bible would tell us that they have ears

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:25.639
but they hear not.

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:28.919
And I'm thankful that our God is the living God

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:31.039
and that he hears us when we pray.

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:34.320
This evening as we study verses five and six,

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.240
we will examine and understand the rest

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.279
that David experienced.

00:03:39.279 --> 00:03:41.199
We see the reality of the situation.

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:42.759
It was dim, it was difficult,

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:45.199
it was a very serious situation.

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:47.559
We see the response, it's a response of prayer,

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:49.440
it's a response of rejoicing.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.320
And then this evening we see the rest

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.160
that David experienced.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.639
Notice in verse number five,

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:57.479
the Bible says, I laid me down and slept.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.960
I awaked for the Lord sustained me.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.399
I will not be afraid of 10,000s of people

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:09.720
that have set themselves against me roundabout.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.919
For this third study through Psalm three,

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:14.759
I've titled the message from verse number five,

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:18.119
I laid me down and slept.

00:04:18.119 --> 00:04:19.399
I laid me down and slept.

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:22.440
We mentioned the reality, we mentioned the response.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.200
Tonight we see the rest that David experienced.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.480
And honestly, as we examine Psalm three,

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.239
I hope that just as it's been an encouragement to me

00:04:31.239 --> 00:04:34.679
as I've prepared and delivered the messages,

00:04:34.679 --> 00:04:36.600
that you too have been encouraged.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.880
But as we look at these verses of Scripture,

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.399
I find the impact to be great.

00:04:42.399 --> 00:04:43.839
I hope that it will have an impact

00:04:43.839 --> 00:04:45.880
on each of our lives this evening.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.000
My experience far too often, not only personally,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.480
but through ministry and through years

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.480
of speaking with folks and praying with folks

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.359
and counseling folks is that there are times

00:04:57.359 --> 00:04:59.799
in which we understand the circumstances

00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:01.559
of the situation that we're dealing with.

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:04.040
And we may even respond properly.

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.640
We may respond by praying,

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.079
we may respond by taking it to the Lord,

00:05:08.079 --> 00:05:12.440
but far too often, we do not leave it there.

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.359
Far too often we respond properly by praying,

00:05:16.359 --> 00:05:19.000
but then we do not rest in Him.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.200
We continue to worry, we continue to fret,

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.600
we continue to try to figure things out.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.160
But we find this evening that in verses five and six,

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.559
that this is a beautiful picture and a beautiful example

00:05:31.559 --> 00:05:35.679
of taking our burdens to the Lord and leaving them there.

00:05:36.679 --> 00:05:41.200
And understanding that we understand who He is.

00:05:42.239 --> 00:05:45.119
David just rehearsed that in verse number three.

00:05:45.119 --> 00:05:48.160
But thou, O Lord, art a shield for me,

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.760
my glory and the lifter up of mine head.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.079
He understood who God was to him.

00:05:54.079 --> 00:05:56.200
He understood that God heard him.

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.279
I cried unto the Lord with my voice

00:05:58.279 --> 00:06:01.519
and He heard me out of His holy hill, Selah,

00:06:01.519 --> 00:06:02.359
and then what?

00:06:02.359 --> 00:06:04.399
I laid me down and slept.

00:06:04.399 --> 00:06:05.799
Isn't that amazing?

00:06:05.799 --> 00:06:08.079
When you read verse one and you read verse number two

00:06:08.079 --> 00:06:11.839
and you see the situation that David is facing,

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:16.679
you see the increase of those that would trouble him

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.399
and the many that were rising against him

00:06:19.399 --> 00:06:21.239
and you understand contextually

00:06:21.239 --> 00:06:23.239
as you go back to 2 Samuel 15

00:06:23.239 --> 00:06:26.040
and look at all that was taking place

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.839
and the size of the rebellion and the revolt

00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:32.799
and you say, to go from understanding his situation

00:06:32.799 --> 00:06:36.760
to laying his head down and going to sleep, wow.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.480
What a rest.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:39.880
What a great example.

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.279
He went to sleep.

00:06:42.279 --> 00:06:45.959
I believe that it's a great picture of the peace of God.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.519
There's no sleepless night for David.

00:06:48.519 --> 00:06:51.399
No, we look at this passage of Scripture

00:06:51.399 --> 00:06:54.119
and we understood that David took his need

00:06:54.119 --> 00:06:57.440
to the only one that could do something about it.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.519
He took it to the Creator of heaven and earth.

00:06:59.519 --> 00:07:01.679
He took it to the Lord God omnipotent.

00:07:01.679 --> 00:07:03.040
He poured out his heart.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:07.279
He says, I cried unto the Lord with my voice.

00:07:07.279 --> 00:07:09.679
In understanding that God heard him,

00:07:09.679 --> 00:07:11.760
he laid down and went to sleep.

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.119
I love it.

00:07:14.119 --> 00:07:15.839
It's so impactful.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.119
Why, because far too often we don't live there.

00:07:19.119 --> 00:07:20.600
I'm just being honest tonight.

00:07:21.799 --> 00:07:24.760
Far too often we don't live there.

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:27.799
We take it to God and we continue to worry and fret

00:07:27.799 --> 00:07:30.160
and we continue to try to figure things out,

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.839
but we find that he went to sleep.

00:07:31.839 --> 00:07:36.160
See, worry will not change one thing of your circumstance.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.160
It really won't.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.920
Someone said this, everything I've ever worried about

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.399
never came to pass.

00:07:41.399 --> 00:07:42.920
And so worry works.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.720
No, no, worry doesn't work.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.600
It's just that the things you worried about didn't happen.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.519
And often we find that to be the case.

00:07:49.519 --> 00:07:50.519
Isn't it true?

00:07:50.519 --> 00:07:51.480
We worry about things.

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:54.119
Someone said this worry is like a rocking chair.

00:07:54.119 --> 00:07:56.720
It'll keep you busy, but it won't get you anywhere.

00:07:58.399 --> 00:08:00.119
How many of you have a rocking chair?

00:08:00.119 --> 00:08:02.160
You know, you just sit there and rock, right?

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.519
Kind of get the picture of the folks

00:08:03.519 --> 00:08:05.920
sitting on the front porch, sipping the sweet tea,

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:08.200
and they're not getting anywhere off that front porch.

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.600
They're just, it keeps them busy.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.920
It keeps them doing something,

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.559
but they're not getting anywhere.

00:08:13.559 --> 00:08:17.320
So often in our lives, we worry,

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:20.519
and we say that as we think about worry,

00:08:20.519 --> 00:08:22.760
the fact that it will not change the situation,

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:24.519
but I would submit to you this evening,

00:08:24.519 --> 00:08:28.600
that worry also reveals in us a lack of faith.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:30.799
It really does.

00:08:31.959 --> 00:08:34.039
When we worry about the circumstances,

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:38.200
about the situation, we're revealing that we're

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.799
really not sure that God's able to take care of it.

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:42.520
Right?

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:44.599
Turn to the book of Philippians.

00:08:44.599 --> 00:08:46.640
Keep your place here in Psalm 3,

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.119
and look over the book of Philippians.

00:08:48.119 --> 00:08:50.479
We're familiar with the passage of scripture

00:08:50.479 --> 00:08:53.000
in Philippians chapter number four,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.280
and we know that the picture often throughout

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:01.039
the scriptures in here in Psalm 3 is one such example

00:09:01.039 --> 00:09:03.640
of this truth that we read in Philippians 4,

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:05.400
and there are many that we could go to,

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.840
but this evening we'll just stick to Psalm 3,

00:09:09.119 --> 00:09:11.080
but I want you to see how that Psalm 3

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:16.080
really shows us the working of the truth in Philippians 4.

00:09:16.479 --> 00:09:19.119
Notice in Philippians 4 in verse number six,

00:09:20.239 --> 00:09:21.919
be careful for nothing.

00:09:23.159 --> 00:09:25.119
We're not to be full of care.

00:09:25.119 --> 00:09:28.520
It doesn't mean be careful, like watch your step,

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:32.320
be careful, that's not the idea of the phraseology

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:34.400
when you understand the English,

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.119
and you understand he's saying don't worry about things.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.320
Be careful for nothing.

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:40.479
Do not be full of care.

00:09:40.479 --> 00:09:42.440
Have no anxiety.

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:44.200
Be not anxious.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.039
Be careful for nothing.

00:09:46.039 --> 00:09:50.840
Notice what he says, but in everything.

00:09:51.919 --> 00:09:53.039
How?

00:09:53.039 --> 00:09:56.320
By prayer and supplication.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:01.320
With thanksgiving, let your requests be not in vain.

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:04.520
made known unto God."

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:07.660
It's a verse that we know.

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:10.680
But knowing it doesn't mean we practice it.

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:11.940
Right?

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:14.260
Be careful for nothing.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.600
But in everything,

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.360
by prayer and supplication,

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:20.900
with thanksgiving,

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:23.400
let your requests be made known unto God.

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:25.680
And then notice verse 7.

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.020
And the peace of God,

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:30.720
which passeth all understanding,

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:34.080
shall keep your hearts and minds

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.300
through Christ Jesus.

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:38.720
Do you not see a great peace in David

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:42.320
in Psalm 3 and verse 5?

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.120
Laid down and went to sleep.

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:46.360
That's peace.

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:49.720
That's a peace that passeth all understanding.

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:53.780
That's a peace in the midst of a great storm.

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:55.360
In great difficulty.

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:58.480
We mentioned as we studied three weeks ago

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:02.360
that the situation that David was facing was real.

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:05.020
It was not a make-believe.

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:08.320
It was not an exaggerated situation.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:11.280
No, this was a real difficulty.

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:13.520
But he went to God in prayer.

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:15.220
He understood who God was.

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:16.920
Who God is.

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.480
And he said, therefore,

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:20.280
I'm going to go to sleep.

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:21.740
I've prayed about it.

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:24.260
I've gone to God about it.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.060
And I'm going to leave it with Him.

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:27.740
Because God is able.

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:30.140
Because God is able.

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:31.540
And me staying up all night

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:33.540
worrying about what Absalom is doing

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:34.720
and how they're scheming

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:36.320
and where they're going to come from

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.700
isn't going to do anything whatsoever

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:40.900
to change the situation.

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:41.900
Right?

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:43.180
I'm going to change it.

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:45.280
And so therefore, when we look at our own lives,

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:46.780
when we look at our own situations,

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:49.020
and we look at the troubles and the difficulties

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:50.220
in which we deal with,

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:51.460
and we say, listen,

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:54.140
there's nothing that's going to change

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:57.300
our circumstances that we're going to do

00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:01.220
that God is not able to do better.

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:03.060
Because He does all things well.

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:04.020
Amen?

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:05.860
Notice what it says in verse 5.

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:07.740
I laid me down and slept.

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:10.660
And then it says this, I awaked.

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:14.420
For the Lord sustained me.

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:16.260
He sustained me.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.620
And we think about the truth this evening

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:21.100
that our God is our sustainer.

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:23.980
That He is able to keep us.

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:25.860
That He is able to protect us.

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:28.980
That He is able to provide for us all that we need.

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:30.300
And we sing the song,

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:32.420
He is able, He is able.

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:35.260
I know He is able.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:36.100
Right?

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:36.940
We sing it.

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:37.940
We know the song.

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:41.580
And we sing a great hymn.

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:43.820
He is able to deliver thee.

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:45.380
And as we sing that hymn,

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:48.620
often my mind races to the truth

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:51.900
of the passage of Scripture in Daniel chapter number six.

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:55.780
Remember when Daniel prayed after the writing

00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:58.180
and Daniel prayed and the Bible says

00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:01.660
that the response of him seeking the Lord

00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:03.660
was the attack of the enemy

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:06.460
and he was going to be put into the den of lions.

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:08.700
And we find that Darius comes to him

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:11.620
and Darius says, I know that the Lord

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:12.980
that you serve continually,

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:14.940
I know He is able to deliver thee.

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:17.580
Now in that account in Daniel six,

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:19.420
who slept and who didn't sleep?

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:22.940
Daniel slept.

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:26.100
But the king didn't sleep.

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:27.500
Right?

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:28.900
And the king didn't sleep

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:30.900
and he comes to Daniel and he says,

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:34.620
Daniel, is your God whom you serve continually

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:36.780
able to deliver thee?

00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:39.300
And Daniel responds, yes.

00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:42.860
Yes, the Lord is able.

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:44.180
And so this evening,

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:47.940
we see this truth where he went to sleep.

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:49.940
He is showing us,

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:53.140
he's revealing to us this peace of God that he has.

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:53.980
Why?

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:56.540
Because he took it to the Lord and he left it there.

00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:58.060
And the Lord sustained him.

00:13:58.060 --> 00:13:59.620
The Lord kept him.

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:01.340
I want you to see as we continue

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:02.780
and look at verse number six,

00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:05.300
note the resolve of David.

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:08.020
I love the I wills of the Psalms.

00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:09.980
In fact, if you want to do a study,

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:12.300
you can go through the entirety of the book of Psalms.

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:14.700
In fact, there are many in just Psalm 119,

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:15.980
but you'll find where the Psalmist

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:17.740
makes these declarative statements,

00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:19.619
these statements with resolve.

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:22.059
I will do such and such.

00:14:22.059 --> 00:14:23.619
I will keep thy commandments.

00:14:23.619 --> 00:14:25.580
I will not forget thy commandments.

00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:27.140
I will, I will, I will.

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:29.899
And we find here that David says,

00:14:29.899 --> 00:14:33.540
I will not be afraid.

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:35.740
Now we'll know what he's not going to be afraid of

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:37.020
here in just a moment,

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:39.140
but I want you to think and I want you to understand

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:41.420
that in the situation in which David is facing

00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:43.300
and the circumstances that we understand

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:44.500
in verses one and two,

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:48.460
there was reason to fear from a human perspective.

00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:50.020
Correct?

00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:52.860
And when you understand how David words this

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:54.059
in verse number six,

00:14:54.059 --> 00:14:56.580
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

00:14:56.580 --> 00:15:00.300
and you have an opportunity to really wrap your mind

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:03.140
around the size of the rebellion and the revolt,

00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:06.260
you find that David is saying, I will not be afraid.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:07.100
Why?

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:09.740
Because David has some great level of courage,

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:12.779
because David is some manly man with this courage

00:15:12.779 --> 00:15:14.100
that none of us can understand.

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:17.740
No, that's not why he's saying I will not be afraid.

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:19.220
He's saying I will not be afraid.

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:20.059
Why?

00:15:20.059 --> 00:15:22.460
Because I've looked to my God

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:26.020
and my God is able to do what I cannot do.

00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:29.619
And since I've looked to my God

00:15:29.619 --> 00:15:33.420
and since I've placed my confidence and my trust in my God,

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:35.380
I will not be afraid.

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:39.260
He has not given us a spirit of fear, right?

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.660
Is that not what the New Testament tells us?

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:43.860
He's not given us the spirit of fear.

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:46.460
And I want you to consider as David says here,

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:47.740
I will not be afraid.

00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:52.420
Notice what he says, of 10,000s of people

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:59.100
that have set themselves against me roundabout.

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:03.420
That's a situation.

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:05.179
But David says, I'm not gonna fear.

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:08.540
I'm not gonna fear, because my God is greater.

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:10.260
My God is able.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:14.140
And when we think about the peace, the rest of David,

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:15.860
when we find in verse number five,

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.940
this rest that he has, where he lays down,

00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:20.820
I laid me down and slept,

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:22.740
in the midst of all that's taking place,

00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:26.380
we see this rest as a result of him taking it to the Lord

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:27.899
in verses three and four,

00:16:27.899 --> 00:16:30.260
that response to his situation

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:34.660
results in this great rest, this great peace.

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:35.779
Can I tell you this evening,

00:16:35.779 --> 00:16:37.899
that's where God wants us to be.

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:43.540
He wants us to have that peace and that confidence

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:48.220
in who He is, in what He is able to do.

00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:51.779
He does not want us to worry and fret like the unbeliever.

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:56.820
I understand when the unbeliever worries and frets.

00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:59.179
I understand that they do not have

00:16:59.179 --> 00:17:01.540
an understanding of who my God is,

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:03.140
and they do not have a relationship

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:05.140
because they've not trusted Christ

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:06.580
as their personal Savior,

00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:09.540
and therefore, I understand when they worry and fret.

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:14.020
But as a child of God, as a believer,

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:18.140
when we understand all that He said He was to us

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:22.580
and is to us, we ought not worry and fret.

00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:23.980
Amen?

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:25.540
Because God is able.

00:17:26.619 --> 00:17:29.260
Notice, look at Psalm 27.

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:31.460
We're gonna look at a few Psalms

00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:34.020
and then look at a passage in the book of Hebrews,

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:37.339
and I want you to see in these other references here

00:17:37.339 --> 00:17:39.380
in the book of Psalms, Psalm 27,

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:43.339
I want you to notice here in these three references

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:48.980
the resolve and the statement of not fearing

00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:51.500
because of understanding who God is.

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:55.580
In Psalm 27, in verse number one,

00:17:55.580 --> 00:18:00.580
the Bible says, the Lord is my light and my salvation.

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:03.179
Whom shall I fear?

00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:08.580
The Lord is the strength of my life.

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:12.580
Of whom shall I be afraid?

00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:17.020
When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes,

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:19.140
came upon me to eat up my flesh,

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:21.300
they stumbled and fell.

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:24.179
Though an host should encamp against me,

00:18:24.179 --> 00:18:27.300
my heart shall not fear.

00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:29.940
Though war should rise against me,

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:32.860
in this will I be confident.

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:36.100
One thing have I desired of the Lord,

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:37.419
that will I seek after,

00:18:37.419 --> 00:18:39.299
that I may dwell in the house of the Lord

00:18:39.299 --> 00:18:41.220
all the days of my life,

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:42.820
to behold the beauty of the Lord

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:45.979
and to inquire in his temple.

00:18:45.979 --> 00:18:47.380
I will not fear.

00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:51.299
You notice three times he says, of whom shall I fear?

00:18:51.299 --> 00:18:53.419
Of whom shall I be afraid?

00:18:53.419 --> 00:18:56.739
He says in verse three, my heart shall not fear.

00:18:58.020 --> 00:18:58.859
Why?

00:18:58.859 --> 00:19:01.580
Because God is my light and my salvation.

00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:04.820
Because the Lord is the strength of my life.

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:06.859
Because I understand who he is.

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:12.100
And it changes my response to circumstances and situations.

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:14.220
Notice in Psalm 56, and really,

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:15.739
we will not take the time,

00:19:15.739 --> 00:19:17.580
but we could read the entirety of this Psalm.

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:18.739
It's only 13 verses.

00:19:18.739 --> 00:19:20.460
Perhaps you'd like to take the time

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:23.340
to do that later this week and read the entirety.

00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:25.700
But I'll just pick a few verses here this evening

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:27.820
to help us see what's taking place.

00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:29.260
Notice in verse number one,

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:31.220
be merciful unto me, O God,

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:32.940
for man would swallow me up.

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:35.859
He fighting daily oppresseth me.

00:19:35.859 --> 00:19:38.500
Mine enemies would daily swallow me up,

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:40.859
for they be many that fight against me.

00:19:40.859 --> 00:19:43.900
O thou most high, what time I am afraid,

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:45.820
I will trust in thee.

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:48.179
In God, I will praise his word.

00:19:48.179 --> 00:19:50.700
In God, I have put my trust.

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:54.020
I will not fear what flesh can do unto me.

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:54.859
Why?

00:19:55.859 --> 00:19:57.979
Because in God, I have put my trust.

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:01.260
Every day, he says in verse number five,

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:06.500
rest my words, all their thoughts are against me for evil, they gather

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:12.140
themselves together, they hide themselves, they mark my steps when they wait for my

00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:20.540
soul." Wow. Verse 8, thou tellest my wanderings, put thou my tears into thy

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:24.780
bottle, are they not in thy book when I cry unto thee? Notice in verse number 9,

00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:32.940
when I cry unto thee, then shall mine enemies turn back, this I know. Notice

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:40.540
this last phrase of verse number 9, for God is for me. Isn't that good? God is for me.

00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:45.580
Oftentimes we want to say, you know, who's on God's side or however we want to

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:50.380
look at something like that. We see that the psalmist here is declaring the

00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:54.140
circumstances in which they're facing and dealing with all that's taking place

00:20:54.140 --> 00:21:00.460
and he says here in verse number 9, I know, this I know. See, God wants us to be

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:08.580
confident of who he is to us. He says, this I know, for God is for me. If God

00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:14.700
be for us, who shall be against us? Greater is he that is in you than he

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:21.740
that is in the world. And we find that the reality of God's Word, again, we've

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:26.980
said this over the years, it's not just a book of theory, it's a book of practice.

00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:32.500
When we understand and we study the Scriptures and we understand who he is

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:38.060
and who he is to me and we rejoice in that and we rehearse that and we

00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:43.260
remember that, then when the day of adversity comes, our strength has been

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:48.780
increased. It's not small. We will not faint. Why? Because we know who he is and

00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:57.260
we have confidence in him. We've put our trust in him. Notice in Psalm 118. In

00:21:57.260 --> 00:22:13.100
Psalm 118, in verse number 6, notice it says, the Lord is on my side. I will not

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:19.700
fear. What can man do unto me? You understand that man can only do to you

00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:28.020
what God would let him? Remember Job? Satan wanted to go after Job, but Satan

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:34.020
was limited in what he could do to Job, right? You read Job and you understand

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:39.340
that there were limitations placed upon what Satan could and could not do to

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:48.260
Job. Everything that happens in our life goes through God's filter. Everything. And

00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:53.020
he has a purpose for it. I was chatting with one of the pastors yesterday. He wasn't

00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:55.460
able to make it to the meeting and I just called him to encourage him. He's

00:22:55.460 --> 00:23:00.020
starting a church and just kind of new at it and so on and so forth and they're

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:02.660
doing well and he wasn't able to make it so I called him to just try to

00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:07.620
encourage him and dealing with some some obstacles and what-have-you and he made

00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:11.220
this statement. He said, but we know and we're confident of this that

00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:17.460
everything that God does is for our good. And I said, and for His glory. And that's

00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:23.620
true. It's biblical truth. Everything that God allows. Remember the truth of Romans

00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:29.460
828. Oftentimes we don't quote the beginning when it says, and we know that

00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:32.500
all things work together for good to them who love God, to them who are the

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:36.940
called according to His purpose. And it starts by saying, and we know because God

00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:41.820
wants us to know that. He wants us to have confidence in that. Hebrews 13 and

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:47.140
verses 5 and 6, the Bible tells us in that portion of Scripture that God will

00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:51.340
never leave us nor forsake us and what great truth and great promise that is.

00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:56.820
But you understand with a promise such as that, there's an impact. And the impact

00:23:56.820 --> 00:24:01.580
is really revealed to us as we look at this passage. He says, let your

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:05.740
conversation, and in Hebrews 13 and verse number 5, let your conversation be

00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:10.380
without covetousness and be content with such things as ye have. For he hath

00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:16.700
said, I will never leave thee nor forsake thee, so that we may boldly say, the Lord

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:23.339
is my helper and I will not fear what man shall do unto me. What was it that

00:24:23.339 --> 00:24:28.740
they said, the enemies, in verse number 2 of Psalm 3? There's no help for him in

00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:37.980
God. But David said, Lord, thou art a shield for me. And he went to sleep

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:44.500
because he was resting. He had peace. Isaiah 26, it's a familiar verse of

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:50.260
Scripture in verse 3 where the Bible talks about the the peace that God

00:24:50.260 --> 00:25:01.180
offers us and that perfect peace. Verses 3 and 4 of Isaiah 26 are precious verses

00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:11.100
of Scripture. It tells us this, thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is

00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:18.460
stayed on thee. Where's our mind? You know, oftentimes when we deal with adversity

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:26.220
and trouble and difficulty, the battle's in our mind. I've said to people over the

00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:31.580
years, how much of what you're thinking about passes through the filter of

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:36.100
Philippians 4.8. Philippians 4.8, whatsoever things are true and honest and

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:40.220
pure and so on and so forth, think on these things, right? The battle for our

00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:46.580
mind, so often what's happening is our mind is not stayed on thee, on the Lord.

00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:51.940
We're too focused on our problem and on the situation, on the trial. Remember we

00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:56.180
mentioned that last week when we talked about the response of David. Yes, this is

00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:59.540
the situation, but I'm gonna look to God. I will lift up my eyes unto the hills

00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:02.860
from whence cometh my help. And we find that he says, my help cometh from the

00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:06.779
Lord which made heaven and earth. And it says this, thou will keep him in perfect

00:26:06.779 --> 00:26:14.580
peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusteth in thee. Verse 4,

00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:24.420
trust ye in the Lord forever for in the Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength.

00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:29.900
Man, I need that perfect peace. That perfect peace comes as a result of

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:37.020
trusting him, of keeping my mind stayed on him. This evening we think about the

00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:42.260
the truth of Psalm 3. There was a real situation, the reality is given to us in

00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:46.940
verses 1 and 2. The response is exemplary. It's a response of prayer, of

00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:54.140
rehearsing who God is to me. David is understanding that he is a shield for me,

00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:58.660
that he is my glory, that he is the lifter up of mine head, and he's not

00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:05.540
going to fear. He lays down, he has peace, he has rest. I thought about this tonight

00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:10.160
as I was, actually this afternoon, as I was just kind of meditating and reviewing

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:14.480
the notes for the message, I don't know, 3 or 4 o'clock this afternoon, just kind

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:19.640
of reviewing and meditating on the message for this evening. And as I was, I

00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:26.080
was thinking about this subject of faith and trust, and how we are to trust God in

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:30.960
all situations, and how so often we take something to the Lord but then we

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:37.360
continue to have worry or concern. And we've learned how to use the vernacular

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:41.640
where we won't say I'm worried, we'll just say I'm concerned about this, and

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:44.880
I'm concerned about that, because we know we shouldn't use the word worry, and we

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:49.400
just try to, you know, Christianize it a little bit, make it sound better. But I

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:54.200
thought about this, and I know it's probably not a perfect illustration, but

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:56.720
it's what the Lord gave me as I was praying about it and just thinking about

00:27:56.720 --> 00:28:01.360
it. And here was the the illustration I thought about. How many of you ever have

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:08.040
mailed a letter, mail a letter in the Postal Service, put the address on it, put

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:13.000
a stamp on it, you put it in the mailbox? How many of you worry about it for the

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:22.320
next five days until it gets delivered? Dean, liar. I don't, I don't worry about

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:29.279
it. I put it in the mailbox, and quite honestly, I just kind of forget about it,

00:28:29.279 --> 00:28:36.000
right? But guess what I'm doing? I'm trusting a whole lot of people to get

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:41.640
that envelope from wherever I put it in a box to wherever it's supposed to go.

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:44.919
Now let me ask you this, how many of you ever mailed something that didn't get

00:28:44.919 --> 00:28:52.400
delivered? I have. So you know what that tells me? The Post Office, the United

00:28:52.400 --> 00:29:04.040
States Postal Service has, on more than one occasion, failed me. But I still take

00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:11.760
a letter and mail it, and don't worry about it when I do. God has never failed

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:23.600
me one time. Not once. But there are times that I take something to God, and I cast

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:32.960
my burden, but then I keep worrying about it, as if He is not dependable, as if He

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:38.440
is not trustworthy. Again, I know it's not a perfect illustration, but it was

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:42.640
impactful to me in my office this afternoon, because I can't tell you how

00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:49.080
many times I've dropped a letter, a card, in the mail, and never thought about it

00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:58.359
again. And I'm putting a level of confidence, of faith, of trust, in a bunch

00:29:58.359 --> 00:30:01.359
of people to get a letter from wherever I put it.

00:30:01.359 --> 00:30:09.799
God dropped it off to wherever it's supposed to go, but God, God's never going to fail.

00:30:09.799 --> 00:30:16.479
He is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think.

00:30:16.479 --> 00:30:17.479
He's never failed.

00:30:17.479 --> 00:30:21.999
He's never said, oh, I wasn't supposed to do that.

00:30:21.999 --> 00:30:24.999
No, never.

00:30:24.999 --> 00:30:25.999
He is dependable.

00:30:25.999 --> 00:30:27.479
He is trustworthy.

00:30:27.479 --> 00:30:32.739
And when we understand that, we can do what David did.

00:30:32.739 --> 00:30:36.599
We can lay down and go to sleep.

00:30:36.599 --> 00:30:40.999
We can have rest and we can have peace.

00:30:40.999 --> 00:30:42.159
Why?

00:30:42.159 --> 00:30:50.799
Because I know that God is able and I know that he doeth all things well.

00:30:50.799 --> 00:30:55.999
And me sitting up and worrying about it and fretting about it isn't going to change it.

00:30:55.999 --> 00:31:00.079
And if Dean's worried about his letter getting delivered by the post office, he's going to

00:31:00.079 --> 00:31:03.759
have to drive it himself, right?

00:31:03.759 --> 00:31:04.759
Because that's what we would do.

00:31:04.759 --> 00:31:07.439
We just go ahead and take it ourselves.

00:31:07.439 --> 00:31:09.799
Because you worry about it, you don't even know where it is.

00:31:09.799 --> 00:31:14.159
I don't know how it gets from one place to another.

00:31:14.159 --> 00:31:24.639
But I know that God has given us promises upon promises upon promises, and he's trustworthy.

00:31:24.639 --> 00:31:27.759
He laid down and he went to sleep.

00:31:27.759 --> 00:31:28.759
Wow.

00:31:28.759 --> 00:31:29.759
Impactful.

00:31:29.759 --> 00:31:30.759
Precious.

00:31:30.759 --> 00:31:33.559
Lord, we love you.

00:31:33.559 --> 00:31:36.559
We thank you for loving us.

00:31:36.559 --> 00:31:42.199
I thank you for the rest that David experienced.

00:31:42.199 --> 00:31:43.479
I thank you for the resolve.

00:31:43.479 --> 00:31:44.959
I will not fear.

00:31:44.959 --> 00:31:49.759
God, when we understand who you are to us and we understand the promises that you've

00:31:49.759 --> 00:31:55.359
given us, we understand your sovereignty, God, there's no reason to fear.

00:31:55.359 --> 00:31:57.919
You've not given us a spirit of fear.

00:31:57.919 --> 00:32:04.579
You desire that we'd have peace and rest.

00:32:04.579 --> 00:32:07.719
And this is where you desire for us to live.

00:32:07.719 --> 00:32:14.939
I know that we deal with situations with opposition and difficulty.

00:32:14.939 --> 00:32:19.379
We know that the enemy will say all sorts of things, even as they said to David.

00:32:19.379 --> 00:32:25.539
But God, we trust what you say.

00:32:25.539 --> 00:32:28.139
And you said that you're our helper.

00:32:28.139 --> 00:32:31.659
You said that you'd never leave us nor forsake us.

00:32:31.659 --> 00:32:36.499
You said that you're able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think.

00:32:36.499 --> 00:32:39.299
God, we believe that.

00:32:39.299 --> 00:32:41.779
We trust you.

00:32:41.779 --> 00:32:47.779
I pray that you'd help us to be careful for nothing, but that in everything, by prayer

00:32:47.779 --> 00:32:53.779
and supplication, with thanksgiving, we would let our requests be made known unto you so

00:32:53.779 --> 00:33:00.179
that we might have that peace of God which passeth all understanding.

00:33:00.179 --> 00:33:03.899
Help us, Lord.

00:33:03.899 --> 00:33:05.939
Bless our time of prayer.

00:33:05.939 --> 00:33:06.939
We'll thank you for it.

00:33:06.939 --> 00:33:09.899
In Christ's name we pray, amen.
