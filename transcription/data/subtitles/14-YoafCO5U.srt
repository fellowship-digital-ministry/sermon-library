1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,440
I am thankful for God's Word and for the clarity that He gives, and I look forward to dealing

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,560
with just one verse of Scripture this evening, but it's so foundational and so important

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,079
for us as we begin looking at the book of Revelation.

4
00:00:15,079 --> 00:00:20,040
It'll definitely be a little bit more teachy tonight than preachy, and somebody made the

5
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:25,159
comment of Pastor getting excited tonight, and I said, well, it's a little more teachy

6
00:00:25,159 --> 00:00:29,899
tonight than preachy, so I don't know that I'll get too excited, but we'll see what happens

7
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:32,180
with that, Revelation 4.

8
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:38,819
And verse number one, notice what the Bible says, after this, John is speaking, of course,

9
00:00:38,819 --> 00:00:46,200
after this, I looked, and behold, a door was opened in heaven, and the first voice which

10
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:55,419
I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me, which said, Come up hither, and I

11
00:00:55,419 --> 00:01:01,020
will show thee things which must be hereafter.

12
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,919
I titled the message, as you've seen in the bulletin today, the things which shall be

13
00:01:05,919 --> 00:01:07,500
hereafter.

14
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,860
And we're reminded of the importance that we look at the book of Revelation within the

15
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:17,819
context of what God has provided to us, and we must remember that back in chapter one,

16
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:21,419
God gave us the outline for the book of Revelation.

17
00:01:21,419 --> 00:01:25,900
So back to Revelation 1, and let me just share a few things with you by way of introduction

18
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:32,419
this evening, as we look back in Revelation chapter number one, in verse number 17, and

19
00:01:32,419 --> 00:01:36,379
we dealt with this several weeks ago, but the Bible says, and when I saw him, I fell

20
00:01:36,379 --> 00:01:41,300
at his feet as dead, and he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not, I

21
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,419
am the first and the last.

22
00:01:43,419 --> 00:01:48,900
I'm he that liveth and was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore, amen, and have the

23
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,660
keys of hell and of death.

24
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:57,900
And then notice verse 19, Revelation 119 gives us, it provides to us the outline for the

25
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,739
entire book of Revelation.

26
00:01:59,739 --> 00:02:07,419
The Bible says this, write the things which thou hast seen, section one.

27
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:13,580
Then it says, and the things which are, section two, and then notice the last phrase, and

28
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:18,139
the things which shall be hereafter, section three.

29
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:23,059
So we begin to look at the divisions of the book of Revelation based on the outline that's

30
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:28,139
provided in Revelation 1 and verse 19, we find that section one, the things which thou

31
00:02:28,139 --> 00:02:33,619
hast seen, is revealed to us in chapter number one of the book of Revelation.

32
00:02:33,619 --> 00:02:36,460
Remember it was here in chapter number one where the Bible says the revelation of Jesus

33
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:42,660
Christ, which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come

34
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,660
to pass.

35
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:49,059
It says, and he sent and signified it by his angel, notice, unto his servant John.

36
00:02:49,059 --> 00:02:53,339
So this revelation was given to John, but we noted as we began studying this book that

37
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:55,080
it's for all of the servants.

38
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:00,979
Notice it says that he should, to show unto his servants, plural.

39
00:03:00,979 --> 00:03:05,300
So that the first division as outlined in Revelation 1 and 19 is the things which thou

40
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:09,800
hast seen, and so that's the vision of chapter number one.

41
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:14,119
Division number two of the book of Revelation, the things which are, that's going to refer

42
00:03:14,119 --> 00:03:16,880
to Revelation 2 and 3.

43
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,080
We started those two chapters, it took us several weeks to go through, actually a couple

44
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,800
of months to go through chapters two and three, looking at the seven churches in Asia.

45
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:31,039
We understand that's modern day Turkey, Asia Minor is the region in which it's being discussed,

46
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:35,520
and as we spoke about those particular letters that are written to the churches, we understand

47
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,220
that those churches are representative of the church age.

48
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:43,339
We understand that they're literal churches that are being written to, and they're in

49
00:03:43,339 --> 00:03:47,699
existence at the time of the writing, and Jesus Christ, the one that is the head of

50
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:53,580
the church, is doing an evaluation or an examination of the church, and he sends back a letter

51
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:59,300
through John to these seven churches, and we find that the things which are, that second

52
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:06,179
section in the outline that God provided to us in Revelation 1 and 19, are given to us

53
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:09,699
in Revelation 2 and 3.

54
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:15,940
Then we find that we come to the third section, where God tells us in Revelation 1 and 19,

55
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:19,859
the things which shall be hereafter.

56
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:24,140
Those things, according to the breakdown that we see within the text of Scripture and understanding

57
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:30,140
the book of Revelation, those are those things that are recorded from Revelation 4 to Revelation

58
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,140
22.

59
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:36,220
The things which shall be hereafter, if you were to take and divide that third section,

60
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:42,100
which obviously is the bulk of the book, amen, chapters 4 through chapter 22, the bulk of

61
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:47,339
the book, and those, that, that, the things that, which shall be hereafter, really breaks

62
00:04:47,339 --> 00:04:49,179
down into three sections.

63
00:04:49,179 --> 00:04:54,140
The first one is the tribulation, which is in chapter 6 through chapter 19.

64
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,859
You say, well, what about chapter 4 and 5?

65
00:04:55,859 --> 00:05:00,980
Well, God is giving us a glimpse in Revelation 4 and 5 into the throne room of heaven.

66
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:06,140
And you remember, we mentioned this early on as we began studying the book of Revelation,

67
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:09,940
and we talked about several things with regard to how it, how we must look at the book of

68
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:14,459
Revelation and some principles that would guide our study of the book of Revelation.

69
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:18,500
And one of the things that I mentioned to you in that very first message back in October

70
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:25,100
of last year, was that where, that there would be alternating scenes in the book of Revelation.

71
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:28,380
There'd be scenes where it's in heaven, and then scenes while it's on earth.

72
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:33,500
In Revelation 4 and 5, we see it from verse number 1 that we've read as our text this

73
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,500
evening.

74
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,660
And if you read the entirety of chapter 4 and 5, this is a scene, a glimpse into the

75
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:42,339
throne room of heaven and what glorious scene it is.

76
00:05:42,339 --> 00:05:47,459
And it's amazing when you read Revelation 4 and 5, it gives you just a spiritual goose

77
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:50,980
bump, so to speak, and just encourage you greatly.

78
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:58,540
Then we find in chapter 6, where once again, the scene alternates back to earth, where

79
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:01,220
we begin seeing the tribulation.

80
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:05,859
Then we find in Revelation 20, the millennium, at the end of chapter 19, you begin to see

81
00:06:05,859 --> 00:06:09,380
the marriage supper of the Lamb, and all of that that's taking place, obviously, in heaven

82
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:12,420
while the tribulation is finishing here on earth.

83
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:15,619
And then followed by the millennial reign of Christ, the battle of Armageddon that leads

84
00:06:15,619 --> 00:06:21,940
in to Revelation 20 with the millennial reign of Christ, and then Revelation 21 and 22,

85
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:22,940
eternity.

86
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:27,059
And what a blessing to understand what God has given to us.

87
00:06:27,059 --> 00:06:32,500
As we begin to look at this book, we're reminded of some things that are important for us to

88
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:38,299
focus on as we really lay and study this evening verse 1 of chapter 4, so that we can have

89
00:06:38,299 --> 00:06:39,660
a good understanding.

90
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:44,859
I would say it this way, as we understand the verse of Scripture and look at three phrases

91
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:50,859
from Revelation 4.1, I believe that it will enable us to properly understand the content

92
00:06:50,859 --> 00:06:52,220
of this book.

93
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,619
Can I say this to you this evening?

94
00:06:53,619 --> 00:06:57,579
There's much confusion about the book of Revelation.

95
00:06:57,579 --> 00:06:59,019
I don't think you heard me.

96
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:01,859
There's much confusion about the book of Revelation.

97
00:07:01,859 --> 00:07:04,179
Why is there so much confusion about the book of Revelation?

98
00:07:04,179 --> 00:07:09,779
Because everyone thinks they're a scholar on end-time prophecy because it's so interesting.

99
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:14,299
You've got people who want to feast on it and feed on it, and you've got people that

100
00:07:14,299 --> 00:07:19,260
have all sorts of positions and opinions and so on and so forth.

101
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:23,260
And you can go and you can just type in a couple of things in a Google search engine.

102
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:28,500
You can look at YouTube and you're going to get video after video after video after video

103
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:34,899
after video of differing opinions about what's going to happen in the end times.

104
00:07:34,899 --> 00:07:37,220
And we find that it's a fascinating study.

105
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,679
It's an interesting study.

106
00:07:38,679 --> 00:07:44,239
We find that God told us in this particular book, in verse number 3 of chapter 1, blessed

107
00:07:44,239 --> 00:07:48,940
is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things

108
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,480
which are written therein for the time is at hand.

109
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,279
And so we understand the importance of studying prophecy.

110
00:07:54,279 --> 00:08:00,679
You remember as we looked at in times past and looking at some things where the Samuel,

111
00:08:00,679 --> 00:08:05,160
the prophet Samuel when he was just a boy and God was calling to him and he said, speak

112
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,079
Lord for thy servant heareth.

113
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:14,799
And he had given to God in that statement the importance of him having an ear to hear

114
00:08:14,799 --> 00:08:19,600
but the intent of obeying or doing what God would reveal to him.

115
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,920
You know what's interesting?

116
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,720
God told him about things that were future.

117
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,119
God told him about things that were future.

118
00:08:27,119 --> 00:08:32,400
And we understand that as we begin to look at God's word, he has provided us with truth

119
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,919
with regard to the future.

120
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:40,760
We cannot get so consumed with studying prophecy that we forget to do what we're supposed to

121
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,320
do in the present.

122
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,320
Amen?

123
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,159
And there's a fine line.

124
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:50,599
It's a very difficult thing because you can get so consumed and so caught up in prophecy

125
00:08:50,599 --> 00:08:55,400
that you forget to do and to be what you're supposed to be today.

126
00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:00,400
You forget to be the light that you're to be and to be doing what God has commanded

127
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,059
us to do for today.

128
00:09:02,059 --> 00:09:06,820
So it's important that we know, it's important that we're settled and grounded.

129
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:09,859
As we begin to look at chapter number four and I begin to look at this, we're gonna spend

130
00:09:09,859 --> 00:09:12,820
a few weeks just on the first few verses of chapter four.

131
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:13,820
Why?

132
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:17,960
Because I believe that chapter four is a picture of the rapture.

133
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,739
It provides for us clarity as to the rapture of the church.

134
00:09:21,739 --> 00:09:24,500
Now we're not gonna get into all of that this evening.

135
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:30,419
We're really gonna set the foundation tonight for then looking at next week, the picture

136
00:09:30,419 --> 00:09:35,500
that is here and then the repercussions or the byproduct of that in the following week

137
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,820
as we look at this passage of Scripture.

138
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:41,859
Why is it so important for us to understand?

139
00:09:41,859 --> 00:09:45,580
Why?

140
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:48,820
Why is it so important that we understand?

141
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,299
God said that we're to be settled and grounded.

142
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:51,299
Amen?

143
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,299
We're to be settled and grounded.

144
00:09:53,299 --> 00:09:56,580
We're to be able to contend for the faith.

145
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,859
And we understand today that as we look at God's word and we begin to...

146
00:09:59,859 --> 00:10:02,959
examine the scriptures, that we ought to be in a place

147
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,639
where we are grounded in the truth,

148
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:10,639
that we can defend our position biblically,

149
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:13,599
that we can go, and if somebody were to ask of you,

150
00:10:13,599 --> 00:10:15,779
when do you believe, how do you believe,

151
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:18,319
what's going to happen, that you can take the Bible

152
00:10:18,319 --> 00:10:21,139
and provide for them and answer why

153
00:10:21,139 --> 00:10:23,519
so that you're settled in your own heart,

154
00:10:24,419 --> 00:10:26,219
so that we're not tossed to and fro

155
00:10:26,219 --> 00:10:29,319
with every wind of doctrine, amen,

156
00:10:29,359 --> 00:10:32,879
that we have the stability that God provides us

157
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:36,019
in his word, and so let's look at these three phrases

158
00:10:36,019 --> 00:10:37,859
in chapter four and verse number one,

159
00:10:37,859 --> 00:10:39,559
I'm not gonna look at them in order,

160
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:40,799
we're gonna look at number one, number three,

161
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:42,439
and then number two, but I'm gonna list them

162
00:10:42,439 --> 00:10:45,299
as one, two, and three, and so notice the first phrase

163
00:10:45,299 --> 00:10:49,339
that I note in this passage, it says after this,

164
00:10:49,339 --> 00:10:52,179
after this, the timeline for the book

165
00:10:52,179 --> 00:10:55,479
is being explained to us, we find that in chapter two

166
00:10:55,479 --> 00:10:58,019
and in chapter number three, all of the churches

167
00:10:58,019 --> 00:10:59,619
are addressed, those seven churches,

168
00:10:59,619 --> 00:11:02,219
remember, there were more churches in existence

169
00:11:02,219 --> 00:11:05,059
than just seven churches, but these are the churches

170
00:11:05,059 --> 00:11:07,859
that were written to because they're representative

171
00:11:07,859 --> 00:11:10,119
of the churches within the church age,

172
00:11:10,119 --> 00:11:12,039
I'm thankful, and we taught through it,

173
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:14,559
we dealt with it quite extensively

174
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,299
as we looked at chapters two and three,

175
00:11:16,299 --> 00:11:19,539
I do not believe that these seven churches

176
00:11:19,539 --> 00:11:21,839
are representative of periods of time

177
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,819
within the church age, that we're in the last days,

178
00:11:24,819 --> 00:11:26,699
and so we're in the Laodicean period,

179
00:11:26,699 --> 00:11:29,699
and all we can do is be a Laodicean church,

180
00:11:29,699 --> 00:11:32,399
I don't believe that, that would be extremely unfortunate

181
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,939
for us, I believe that we can have revival today,

182
00:11:35,939 --> 00:11:39,539
do I see a lot of the behaviors of the Laodiceans

183
00:11:39,539 --> 00:11:43,239
in the last days, absolutely, you just look around

184
00:11:43,239 --> 00:11:47,519
and you can see the spirit of the Laodicean church

185
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,619
present in many of our churches today, we see it,

186
00:11:52,619 --> 00:11:55,559
but the reality is that we don't have to be

187
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:58,999
a Laodicean church, and so we find that the Bible says

188
00:11:58,999 --> 00:12:02,599
after this, it's important that we understand after what,

189
00:12:02,599 --> 00:12:05,319
what is it that's being referenced here as we study

190
00:12:05,319 --> 00:12:10,239
and we look and we understand the truth of literature

191
00:12:10,239 --> 00:12:13,039
that here God has provided to us this book

192
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:16,239
with regard to end times, and he says after this,

193
00:12:16,239 --> 00:12:19,119
after what, well after those letters are completed,

194
00:12:19,119 --> 00:12:23,399
after the literal churches that represent the church age,

195
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:28,399
we find that after this, then John is immediately

196
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:31,799
translated, we're gonna look at that in just a moment,

197
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:34,199
but I want you to understand an important truth,

198
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:40,539
from chapter four until chapter 19,

199
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,799
there's no reference to the church on earth,

200
00:12:45,939 --> 00:12:48,079
so it's quite interesting that in chapter two

201
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:52,999
and chapter three, the church, the church, the church,

202
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,879
you get to chapter four, after this,

203
00:12:56,879 --> 00:12:59,679
John is caught up, he's translated,

204
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:03,639
and there's no more reference to the church on earth,

205
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:05,959
the reference to the church in Revelation 19

206
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:08,159
is at the marriage supper of the lamb,

207
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:10,279
and we only know that that's a reference to the church

208
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:11,959
as we compare scripture with scripture

209
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:14,419
because the word church is not used,

210
00:13:15,319 --> 00:13:17,319
but if you are a good hermeneutic student

211
00:13:17,319 --> 00:13:19,159
and you study scripture and you compare scripture

212
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:21,519
with scripture, you understand that the church

213
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,519
is the bride of Christ, and so we find that

214
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:27,719
as we look at the text of scripture and we understand this,

215
00:13:27,719 --> 00:13:30,399
we begin to look at what's happening here

216
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,679
and understanding this timeline, he says after this,

217
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,999
notice the second phrase that we read,

218
00:13:35,999 --> 00:13:38,679
and it's not, again, it's not sequential in the text,

219
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:40,639
I wanna look at the end of the text,

220
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,199
where it says this, I will show thee things

221
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:48,599
which must be hereafter, so this is the second statement,

222
00:13:48,599 --> 00:13:51,559
if you will, that I want you to focus on

223
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:53,759
as we look at this verse of scripture,

224
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:57,719
after this, the end of the church age,

225
00:13:57,719 --> 00:14:01,999
things which must be hereafter,

226
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:05,639
that which is to be revealed will happen

227
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:08,779
after the church age is completed,

228
00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:11,919
again, chapter four and five is a scene

229
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:14,419
in the throne room of heaven, and we'll look at that

230
00:14:14,419 --> 00:14:15,879
as we study the next several weeks

231
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:19,159
and seeing what God allows us to have of a glimpse

232
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:20,759
into the throne room of heaven,

233
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:23,039
and then immediately in verse number six,

234
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:25,000
or chapter number six, we begin to look

235
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,119
at the great tribulation, and so those events

236
00:14:28,119 --> 00:14:30,759
that are referenced at the end of verse number one,

237
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:34,679
I will show thee things which must be hereafter,

238
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:38,719
it's going to be after the church age ends.

239
00:14:38,719 --> 00:14:41,239
It is important to note as we look at this text

240
00:14:41,239 --> 00:14:44,719
of scripture that the word says, or the Bible says,

241
00:14:44,719 --> 00:14:48,799
must be, it's an interesting word, or phrase,

242
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:50,799
it's two words in our English language,

243
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:54,159
but the idea of this is, notice this definition,

244
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:58,439
it's necessity established by the counsel

245
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:03,039
and decree of God, so all of a sudden,

246
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:06,879
those words must be are pretty significant to us,

247
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:10,559
so we find that he says, I will show thee things

248
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:13,399
which must be hereafter.

249
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:16,079
Let's begin to understand and look at the timeline here,

250
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,919
and we say, okay, so these things must be hereafter,

251
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,759
and so we understand, again, the timeline,

252
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:23,479
as God is establishing for us, he provided us

253
00:15:23,479 --> 00:15:26,039
in Revelation chapter one and verse 19,

254
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:29,359
that three-section outline for the book,

255
00:15:29,359 --> 00:15:32,159
and we find that he says, after this,

256
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:36,039
things which must be hereafter, and so God is helping us

257
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:39,799
to understand with great clarity what he's revealing

258
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:43,319
to us in the book of Revelation, and so these things

259
00:15:43,319 --> 00:15:47,959
which must be hereafter are going to be recorded

260
00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:51,159
and revealed to us so that we would understand

261
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:53,279
the plan that God has.

262
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,759
Now, remember, as we begin to study this

263
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,119
and look through the truth of this book of Revelation,

264
00:15:59,119 --> 00:16:02,079
that as we look here and we begin to realize

265
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,279
what God is doing and what God is revealing to us,

266
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,239
that number one, it causes us, it should cause us

267
00:16:08,239 --> 00:16:12,000
to rejoice and to glorify and praise our God, why?

268
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,719
Because it is the revelation of Jesus Christ,

269
00:16:15,719 --> 00:16:18,679
and so we understand that he is the one

270
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:21,039
that is to be exalted and magnified,

271
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:23,239
and we are to have that perspective

272
00:16:23,239 --> 00:16:24,419
as we study through the book.

273
00:16:24,419 --> 00:16:27,359
We also understand that it brings us to a place

274
00:16:27,359 --> 00:16:30,919
where we are going to agree with God.

275
00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:32,159
God has a plan.

276
00:16:33,479 --> 00:16:35,179
Do you believe that tonight?

277
00:16:35,179 --> 00:16:37,579
Listen, God has a plan for the ages.

278
00:16:38,459 --> 00:16:40,659
God has a plan for your life.

279
00:16:40,659 --> 00:16:41,659
He has a plan for my life.

280
00:16:41,659 --> 00:16:43,259
He has a plan for our lives.

281
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:45,739
He has a plan for us, and we begin to understand

282
00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:48,139
this evening that as we look at this

283
00:16:48,139 --> 00:16:51,779
and we understand the revelation of Jesus Christ

284
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:55,659
and the plan that God has for us, it causes us to rejoice

285
00:16:55,659 --> 00:16:58,319
and it causes us to accept the plan, why?

286
00:16:58,319 --> 00:17:00,979
Because his plan is perfect.

287
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:02,899
Now, let me say this because the Bible says,

288
00:17:02,899 --> 00:17:07,379
and I will show thee things which must be hereafter.

289
00:17:07,379 --> 00:17:10,299
So often the question is this, when?

290
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:12,979
How long?

291
00:17:12,979 --> 00:17:14,259
What's the timeline?

292
00:17:14,259 --> 00:17:15,899
What's the period?

293
00:17:15,899 --> 00:17:17,419
I begin to answer those questions.

294
00:17:17,419 --> 00:17:19,959
I begin to have that discussion.

295
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:22,059
Remember back in Revelation chapter one,

296
00:17:22,059 --> 00:17:25,379
notice again as we begin reading this book of Revelation,

297
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:29,419
notice what God says in Revelation one and verse number one.

298
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:33,099
Revelation one and verse number one,

299
00:17:33,099 --> 00:17:35,179
the Bible says the revelation of Jesus Christ,

300
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:37,979
which God gave unto him to show unto his servants

301
00:17:37,979 --> 00:17:41,659
things which must shortly come to pass.

302
00:17:41,659 --> 00:17:44,119
And he sent and signified it by his angel

303
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:45,619
unto his servant, John.

304
00:17:45,619 --> 00:17:47,500
And so we find that the Bible says right here

305
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,539
in Revelation one, one, things which must shortly

306
00:17:50,539 --> 00:17:51,500
come to pass.

307
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,679
In chapter four and verse number one,

308
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,939
the Bible says that I will show thee things

309
00:17:55,939 --> 00:17:57,899
which must be hereafter.

310
00:17:57,899 --> 00:18:00,159
So what happens is if we're not careful,

311
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:02,819
we can interpret this incorrectly

312
00:18:02,819 --> 00:18:05,979
and kind of get messed up on the timeline.

313
00:18:05,979 --> 00:18:08,379
Can I say to you that the word as we look here

314
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:10,699
in Revelation chapter number one and verse number one,

315
00:18:10,699 --> 00:18:13,219
the word shortly, there is a difference

316
00:18:13,219 --> 00:18:17,179
between immediate and imminent.

317
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:18,539
There's a difference.

318
00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:21,379
Furthermore, as we begin to look at this truth

319
00:18:21,379 --> 00:18:24,859
of what Jesus is giving to John and to us,

320
00:18:24,859 --> 00:18:27,419
we must remember that God is outside of time.

321
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,739
A day is 1,000 years, 1,000 years as a day.

322
00:18:31,739 --> 00:18:32,979
We read that in Psalm 90.

323
00:18:32,979 --> 00:18:35,419
We read that in 2 Peter chapter three.

324
00:18:35,419 --> 00:18:37,880
And so we understand that God is outside of time.

325
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,419
Furthermore, let me say this.

326
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:42,140
When you begin to read this truth,

327
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:44,219
that the Bible says that these things

328
00:18:44,219 --> 00:18:45,859
in chapter one and verse number one

329
00:18:45,859 --> 00:18:48,099
must shortly come to pass,

330
00:18:48,099 --> 00:18:50,039
all of a sudden what you begin to understand

331
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:52,579
as you study this out is not so long,

332
00:18:52,579 --> 00:18:56,059
not so much with regard to how soon they will happen,

333
00:18:56,059 --> 00:19:01,059
but how quickly they will happen once it goes into action.

334
00:19:01,219 --> 00:19:02,579
What do I mean by that?

335
00:19:02,579 --> 00:19:07,239
Well, the reality is that to even the Old Testament prophets

336
00:19:07,239 --> 00:19:11,059
the time of the church age was really unknown to them.

337
00:19:11,059 --> 00:19:14,500
The apostle Paul references regularly in his epistles

338
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:18,619
about the mystery, speaking of the mystery of the church.

339
00:19:18,619 --> 00:19:21,299
And the church would be made up of Jew and Gentile,

340
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:22,739
both saved the same way.

341
00:19:22,739 --> 00:19:25,500
By the way, the cross is only one way to be saved, amen.

342
00:19:25,579 --> 00:19:26,899
And that's Jesus Christ.

343
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:29,539
There's not a Jewish way and a Gentile way.

344
00:19:29,539 --> 00:19:31,260
There's one way to be saved.

345
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,899
And we find that as we look at the New Testament,

346
00:19:33,899 --> 00:19:37,619
the church is the body of Christ, the bride of Christ

347
00:19:37,619 --> 00:19:39,899
that's made up of Jew and Gentile.

348
00:19:39,899 --> 00:19:43,479
It's a mystery to the Old Testament.

349
00:19:43,479 --> 00:19:48,179
We understand that God gave us progressive revelation.

350
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:49,619
And as we begin to look here,

351
00:19:49,619 --> 00:19:51,579
we begin to understand the timeline

352
00:19:51,579 --> 00:19:52,659
of the book of Revelation,

353
00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:54,459
it's important that we understand

354
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,899
that when he says shortly,

355
00:19:55,899 --> 00:20:00,899
it doesn't mean that if the book was written in 90, 95, 80.

356
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:04,899
that these events were going to happen in 100 A.D.

357
00:20:04,899 --> 00:20:07,899
That's not what God intended for us to understand.

358
00:20:07,899 --> 00:20:10,899
When He says shortly, the idea is not the timeline

359
00:20:10,899 --> 00:20:14,899
as much as the swiftness of the events taking place

360
00:20:14,899 --> 00:20:16,899
once they begin.

361
00:20:16,899 --> 00:20:19,899
See, we don't know how long the church age is.

362
00:20:19,899 --> 00:20:21,899
We don't know.

363
00:20:21,899 --> 00:20:23,899
We know when the church age began,

364
00:20:23,899 --> 00:20:25,899
and we know at what point it will end

365
00:20:25,899 --> 00:20:27,899
with the rapture of the church,

366
00:20:27,899 --> 00:20:31,899
but we do not know that definitive timing.

367
00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:33,899
It's unknown to us.

368
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,899
By the way, that should cause us to live

369
00:20:36,899 --> 00:20:39,899
with a measure of urgency,

370
00:20:39,899 --> 00:20:41,899
because today could be the end.

371
00:20:41,899 --> 00:20:43,899
It could be the rapture.

372
00:20:43,899 --> 00:20:45,899
Listen for the trumpet. Jesus is coming.

373
00:20:45,899 --> 00:20:47,899
Amen?

374
00:20:47,899 --> 00:20:49,899
And the reality is that we live in a time

375
00:20:49,899 --> 00:20:51,899
in which we look at this, and again,

376
00:20:51,899 --> 00:20:53,899
as we look at the outline, chapter 1,

377
00:20:53,899 --> 00:20:55,899
the things which thou hast seen,

378
00:20:55,899 --> 00:20:57,899
that vision that he received,

379
00:20:57,899 --> 00:21:00,899
is according to Revelation 1 and verse 19,

380
00:21:00,899 --> 00:21:02,899
the things that thou hast seen,

381
00:21:02,899 --> 00:21:04,899
and then the things which are, the church age,

382
00:21:04,899 --> 00:21:06,899
and the things which must be hereafter,

383
00:21:06,899 --> 00:21:08,899
and we find that it's very interesting

384
00:21:08,899 --> 00:21:10,899
that the bulk of the book,

385
00:21:10,899 --> 00:21:12,899
chapter 4 and following,

386
00:21:12,899 --> 00:21:15,899
chapter 4 and 5, the throne room of heaven,

387
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:17,899
you get to chapter number 6.

388
00:21:17,899 --> 00:21:19,899
You know how quickly things happen

389
00:21:19,899 --> 00:21:21,899
beginning in chapter number 6?

390
00:21:21,899 --> 00:21:23,899
A seal is open.

391
00:21:23,899 --> 00:21:25,899
It explains it. A seal is open.

392
00:21:25,899 --> 00:21:27,899
It explains it. A seal is open.

393
00:21:27,899 --> 00:21:31,899
It explains it. I mean, it happens quick.

394
00:21:31,899 --> 00:21:33,899
You begin to read chapter number 6,

395
00:21:33,899 --> 00:21:37,899
and it's, you know, people don't understand

396
00:21:37,899 --> 00:21:41,899
how terrible the tribulation really is going to be.

397
00:21:41,899 --> 00:21:43,899
They have no idea.

398
00:21:43,899 --> 00:21:45,899
You begin to read chapter 6,

399
00:21:45,899 --> 00:21:47,899
and I don't want to get too far ahead of myself

400
00:21:47,899 --> 00:21:49,899
because we'll be there in a few weeks,

401
00:21:49,899 --> 00:21:51,899
but you begin to read in chapter number 6,

402
00:21:51,899 --> 00:21:53,899
and how many people die

403
00:21:53,899 --> 00:21:56,899
within just the first few of those seals being open.

404
00:21:56,899 --> 00:22:01,899
Listen, this world has never seen anything like it.

405
00:22:01,899 --> 00:22:04,899
Ever.

406
00:22:04,899 --> 00:22:06,899
You thought COVID was bad?

407
00:22:06,899 --> 00:22:09,899
I'm not trying to be funny.

408
00:22:09,899 --> 00:22:12,899
This is another level.

409
00:22:12,899 --> 00:22:14,899
It's going to be terrible.

410
00:22:14,899 --> 00:22:17,899
And so we find that some would define,

411
00:22:17,899 --> 00:22:20,899
as they begin to try to pinpoint the timing

412
00:22:20,899 --> 00:22:22,899
of what's happening here in Revelation chapter 4

413
00:22:22,899 --> 00:22:24,899
and verse number 1,

414
00:22:24,899 --> 00:22:26,899
and they would try to look at this as after this

415
00:22:26,899 --> 00:22:28,899
and the things which must be hereafter,

416
00:22:28,899 --> 00:22:30,899
and they try to talk about the rapture,

417
00:22:30,899 --> 00:22:32,899
and they'll put the rapture at different points

418
00:22:32,899 --> 00:22:34,899
of the tribulation.

419
00:22:34,899 --> 00:22:36,899
Our doctrinal statement, my position,

420
00:22:36,899 --> 00:22:38,899
I mention it often,

421
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:41,899
is that we would be a pre-trib rapture.

422
00:22:41,899 --> 00:22:43,899
It's what we believe.

423
00:22:43,899 --> 00:22:47,899
By the way, it's not a belief that's built on convenience.

424
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:51,899
Sometimes you hold a pre-tribulation rapture position.

425
00:22:51,899 --> 00:22:53,899
You're accused of others

426
00:22:53,899 --> 00:22:56,899
that you just have that position based on convenience.

427
00:22:56,899 --> 00:22:58,899
What do they mean by that?

428
00:22:58,899 --> 00:23:00,899
Well, you just don't want to go through the tribulation,

429
00:23:00,899 --> 00:23:02,899
and so it's just a doctrine of convenience.

430
00:23:02,899 --> 00:23:04,899
Can I tell you this evening,

431
00:23:04,899 --> 00:23:06,899
I don't want to go through the tribulation,

432
00:23:06,899 --> 00:23:09,899
but it's not a doctrine of convenience.

433
00:23:09,899 --> 00:23:11,899
I believe it's biblically accurate.

434
00:23:11,899 --> 00:23:13,899
And I believe that as you study

435
00:23:13,899 --> 00:23:15,899
and compare Scripture with Scripture,

436
00:23:15,899 --> 00:23:17,899
you will see the truth,

437
00:23:17,899 --> 00:23:20,899
and we can't get into all of it this evening for sake of time,

438
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:23,899
but you will understand why we come to the position

439
00:23:23,899 --> 00:23:27,899
that we come to as to the timing of the rapture.

440
00:23:27,899 --> 00:23:31,899
I will say this as kind of an intro to next week's message.

441
00:23:31,899 --> 00:23:35,899
You must understand why there's going to be a tribulation.

442
00:23:35,899 --> 00:23:38,899
You must understand why there's going to be a rapture,

443
00:23:38,899 --> 00:23:42,899
and then you try to answer when.

444
00:23:42,899 --> 00:23:46,899
If you do not adequately understand the why,

445
00:23:46,899 --> 00:23:49,899
you will have a really hard time understanding the when,

446
00:23:49,899 --> 00:23:51,899
and that's how we'll address it.

447
00:23:51,899 --> 00:23:53,899
And you understand, so we have that position.

448
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:56,899
There are some that say, well, it's a mid-trib position,

449
00:23:56,899 --> 00:23:58,899
that there's a mid-trib rapture.

450
00:23:58,899 --> 00:24:01,899
And what they often will use as another phrase

451
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:05,899
to describe that is a pre-wrath rapture.

452
00:24:05,899 --> 00:24:08,899
Can I tell you that if you read chapter 6

453
00:24:08,899 --> 00:24:10,899
beginning in verse number 1,

454
00:24:10,899 --> 00:24:16,899
there's no way that you can say that's not wrath.

455
00:24:16,899 --> 00:24:20,899
And then there's a post-trib position.

456
00:24:20,899 --> 00:24:23,899
There are some that don't believe in a rapture at all,

457
00:24:23,899 --> 00:24:25,899
they don't believe in a millennial,

458
00:24:25,899 --> 00:24:28,899
they take everything very allegorical, so on and so forth.

459
00:24:28,899 --> 00:24:30,899
We take the Bible literal.

460
00:24:30,899 --> 00:24:33,899
We begin to look here and we begin to understand

461
00:24:33,899 --> 00:24:36,899
that God is helping us to understand this timeline

462
00:24:36,899 --> 00:24:39,899
after this, after what?

463
00:24:39,899 --> 00:24:40,899
Well, the church age.

464
00:24:40,899 --> 00:24:42,899
These seven churches are written to,

465
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:45,899
and we find that they're representative of this church age

466
00:24:45,899 --> 00:24:50,899
that we have had the opportunity to live in and serve in,

467
00:24:50,899 --> 00:24:53,899
that we've had the opportunity to read history of.

468
00:24:53,899 --> 00:24:56,899
Listen, reading and studying church history is fascinating.

469
00:24:56,899 --> 00:25:00,899
It's exciting to see how God has worked and what God has done

470
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:04,899
and how the gospel got to us and to other regions.

471
00:25:04,899 --> 00:25:08,899
I was reading just this afternoon about a missionary

472
00:25:08,899 --> 00:25:11,899
that went and because of another missionary that was martyred,

473
00:25:11,899 --> 00:25:14,899
how they went to a field and as they were in that field,

474
00:25:14,899 --> 00:25:17,899
that place today is modern-day Nigeria

475
00:25:17,899 --> 00:25:19,899
and just the work that they were doing there

476
00:25:19,899 --> 00:25:21,899
as the gospel was going forward.

477
00:25:21,899 --> 00:25:24,899
And I was encouraged greatly to understand

478
00:25:24,899 --> 00:25:27,899
another aspect of church history.

479
00:25:27,899 --> 00:25:28,899
God is working.

480
00:25:28,899 --> 00:25:33,899
We have the privilege of being involved in church history.

481
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:36,899
But the church is going to end at some point.

482
00:25:36,899 --> 00:25:38,899
And what is it that ends the church?

483
00:25:38,899 --> 00:25:41,899
It's the rapture after this.

484
00:25:41,899 --> 00:25:45,899
And then he says these things which must be hereafter.

485
00:25:45,899 --> 00:25:49,899
Understand with me that as we look at chapter 4 and verse number 1

486
00:25:49,899 --> 00:25:53,899
that God is helping us to be able to understand

487
00:25:53,899 --> 00:25:57,899
what is going to happen and it must come to pass.

488
00:25:57,899 --> 00:26:00,899
God always does what he says he will do.

489
00:26:00,899 --> 00:26:01,899
Amen.

490
00:26:01,899 --> 00:26:02,899
I believe that.

491
00:26:02,899 --> 00:26:05,899
You remember we just had Resurrection Sunday, Easter Sunday.

492
00:26:05,899 --> 00:26:08,899
They come to the grave early that morning to the sepulcher.

493
00:26:08,899 --> 00:26:09,899
And what do they find?

494
00:26:09,899 --> 00:26:12,899
They find the stone is rolled away and the angel's there

495
00:26:12,899 --> 00:26:15,899
and they say, why seek ye the living among the dead?

496
00:26:15,899 --> 00:26:17,899
And if you read Matthew's gospel, it says,

497
00:26:17,899 --> 00:26:22,899
he is not here for he is risen as he said.

498
00:26:22,899 --> 00:26:26,899
Our God always does what he says he will do.

499
00:26:26,899 --> 00:26:28,899
And when we look at the book of Revelation,

500
00:26:28,899 --> 00:26:32,899
God is providing for his servants, plural,

501
00:26:32,899 --> 00:26:34,899
according to Revelation 1 and 1,

502
00:26:34,899 --> 00:26:38,899
the opportunity for us to understand these things

503
00:26:38,899 --> 00:26:42,899
which must be hereafter.

504
00:26:42,899 --> 00:26:44,899
So we find that there are these two phrases

505
00:26:44,899 --> 00:26:48,899
as book ends to Revelation 4 and verse number 1.

506
00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:51,899
So then come back with me now and look at chapter 4 and verse number 1.

507
00:26:51,899 --> 00:26:55,899
The Bible says after this, notice,

508
00:26:55,899 --> 00:27:00,899
I looked and behold, a door was opened.

509
00:27:00,899 --> 00:27:02,899
What does it say?

510
00:27:02,899 --> 00:27:03,899
Earth and heaven.

511
00:27:03,899 --> 00:27:05,899
Remember, I mentioned at the beginning of this study

512
00:27:05,899 --> 00:27:08,899
that there would be these alternating scenes

513
00:27:08,899 --> 00:27:10,899
between earth and heaven.

514
00:27:10,899 --> 00:27:12,899
Chapter 2 and 3, where's the scene?

515
00:27:12,899 --> 00:27:14,899
The scene is on earth.

516
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:15,899
The churches, right?

517
00:27:15,899 --> 00:27:17,899
They're literal churches.

518
00:27:17,899 --> 00:27:19,899
Under the church at Ephesus, right?

519
00:27:19,899 --> 00:27:20,899
Under the church at Sardis, right?

520
00:27:20,899 --> 00:27:22,899
Under the church at Smyrna, right?

521
00:27:22,899 --> 00:27:24,899
And we read these are literal churches.

522
00:27:24,899 --> 00:27:26,899
You can go back and you can find out historically

523
00:27:26,899 --> 00:27:29,899
where they were located, what they were known for.

524
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:31,899
All of that stuff, it's available.

525
00:27:31,899 --> 00:27:34,899
It is a scene that is on earth.

526
00:27:34,899 --> 00:27:37,899
But after this, the Bible says that John,

527
00:27:37,899 --> 00:27:39,899
he says, I looked and behold,

528
00:27:39,899 --> 00:27:43,899
a door was opened in heaven.

529
00:27:43,899 --> 00:27:45,899
So we now are going to understand

530
00:27:45,899 --> 00:27:48,899
why chapters 4 and 5 are giving to us

531
00:27:48,899 --> 00:27:52,899
that alternating scene of now the throne room in heaven.

532
00:27:52,899 --> 00:27:53,899
And the Bible says,

533
00:27:53,899 --> 00:27:58,899
and the first voice which I heard.

534
00:27:58,899 --> 00:28:02,899
Every word of God is pure.

535
00:28:02,899 --> 00:28:06,899
And God tells us that as John is writing this testimony,

536
00:28:06,899 --> 00:28:08,899
he says, the first voice which I heard

537
00:28:08,899 --> 00:28:12,899
was as it were, notice this,

538
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:17,899
of a trumpet talking with me.

539
00:28:17,899 --> 00:28:18,899
Wow.

540
00:28:18,899 --> 00:28:20,899
What's the third phrase?

541
00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:22,899
Well, it's there.

542
00:28:22,899 --> 00:28:26,899
Come up hither.

543
00:28:26,899 --> 00:28:28,899
We find the first phrase after this,

544
00:28:28,899 --> 00:28:29,899
the second phrase,

545
00:28:29,899 --> 00:28:31,899
and I will show thee things which must be hereafter.

546
00:28:31,899 --> 00:28:34,899
But this third phrase, which sequentially in the verse,

547
00:28:34,899 --> 00:28:36,899
I understand is the second phrase,

548
00:28:36,899 --> 00:28:40,899
is come up hither.

549
00:28:40,899 --> 00:28:43,899
We begin to understand that as John is writing

550
00:28:43,899 --> 00:28:45,899
and he says that he hears this voice

551
00:28:45,899 --> 00:28:47,899
and the voice was as it were,

552
00:28:47,899 --> 00:28:49,899
of a trumpet talking with me,

553
00:28:49,899 --> 00:28:52,899
which said, come up hither.

554
00:28:52,899 --> 00:28:54,899
The Bible says in verse number two,

555
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,899
immediately I was in the spirit

556
00:28:56,899 --> 00:28:58,899
and behold, a throne was set in heaven

557
00:28:58,899 --> 00:28:59,899
and one sat on the throne.

558
00:28:59,899 --> 00:29:02,899
He's immediately transported to heaven.

559
00:29:02,899 --> 00:29:04,899
He sees, the Bible says after this,

560
00:29:04,899 --> 00:29:07,899
he looks up and he sees this door

561
00:29:07,899 --> 00:29:09,899
that's open to heaven and he hears this voice.

562
00:29:09,899 --> 00:29:11,899
The first voice that he heard

563
00:29:11,899 --> 00:29:13,899
was as it were of a trumpet talking with him

564
00:29:13,899 --> 00:29:15,899
that said, come up hither.

565
00:29:15,899 --> 00:29:18,899
And immediately the voice continued and said,

566
00:29:18,899 --> 00:29:20,899
I'm going to show you things which must be hereafter.

567
00:29:20,899 --> 00:29:22,899
Immediately he's in the spirit

568
00:29:22,899 --> 00:29:25,899
and he's in the very throne room of heaven.

569
00:29:25,899 --> 00:29:27,899
It's amazing.

570
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:30,899
It's amazing to be able to understand

571
00:29:30,899 --> 00:29:33,899
as God is revealing for you and for me

572
00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:36,899
and for all of his servants throughout this church age

573
00:29:36,899 --> 00:29:40,899
as he's provided to us a preserved copy of his word

574
00:29:40,899 --> 00:29:42,899
that we could have some clarity

575
00:29:42,899 --> 00:29:45,899
with regard to what's going to happen.

576
00:29:45,899 --> 00:29:49,899
Now I think it'd be awesome to be here during the rapture.

577
00:29:49,899 --> 00:29:52,899
I think that for generations of believers

578
00:29:52,899 --> 00:29:54,899
that have understood the teaching of God's word

579
00:29:54,899 --> 00:29:56,899
with regard to the rapture,

580
00:29:56,899 --> 00:29:58,899
they also have believed it'd be awesome to live

581
00:29:58,899 --> 00:30:00,899
during the time of the rapture.

582
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:04,899
We may not be here when the trumpet sounds.

583
00:30:04,899 --> 00:30:07,899
Death may come to us first through whatever means it may be.

584
00:30:07,899 --> 00:30:10,899
We don't know when we're going to die.

585
00:30:10,899 --> 00:30:17,899
It would be a great thing if we were in the position that John is here in Revelation 4 and verse 1.

586
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:21,899
Notice with me a couple of thoughts with regard to this phrase,

587
00:30:21,899 --> 00:30:23,899
come up hither.

588
00:30:23,899 --> 00:30:25,899
We understand the idea of come up.

589
00:30:25,899 --> 00:30:26,899
He's ascending.

590
00:30:26,899 --> 00:30:28,899
He's being caught up.

591
00:30:28,899 --> 00:30:30,899
He's being raptured, if you will.

592
00:30:30,899 --> 00:30:32,899
And the Bible says come up where?

593
00:30:32,899 --> 00:30:33,899
Hither.

594
00:30:33,899 --> 00:30:35,899
So we know that that's to heaven.

595
00:30:35,899 --> 00:30:39,899
And I want you to understand this evening, there's some that would criticize the teaching of the rapture

596
00:30:39,899 --> 00:30:44,899
and say, well, the word rapture is not anywhere found in the Bible, in the English Bible.

597
00:30:44,899 --> 00:30:48,899
You know that the word dinosaur is not in the English Bible either?

598
00:30:48,899 --> 00:30:49,899
It's not.

599
00:30:49,899 --> 00:30:51,899
Dinosaur is not in here.

600
00:30:51,899 --> 00:30:54,899
Does anyone know why the word dinosaur is not in our Bibles?

601
00:30:54,899 --> 00:30:55,899
Does anyone know?

602
00:30:55,899 --> 00:30:56,899
Jeff?

603
00:30:57,899 --> 00:31:01,899
It wasn't invented until like 1822 or something.

604
00:31:01,899 --> 00:31:02,899
The word.

605
00:31:02,899 --> 00:31:03,899
Dinosaur.

606
00:31:03,899 --> 00:31:05,899
Didn't exist.

607
00:31:05,899 --> 00:31:07,899
Does it mean that dinosaurs didn't exist?

608
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:09,899
Does it mean that the Bible doesn't know about dinosaurs?

609
00:31:09,899 --> 00:31:12,899
No, it doesn't mean that at all.

610
00:31:12,899 --> 00:31:16,899
And so the idea of the word rapture is to be caught up.

611
00:31:16,899 --> 00:31:18,899
So he says come up hither.

612
00:31:18,899 --> 00:31:21,899
But notice what the Bible says in 1 Thessalonians chapter number 4,

613
00:31:22,899 --> 00:31:27,899
where God is giving to us an outline with regard to this event that we would refer to as being the rapture.

614
00:31:27,899 --> 00:31:31,899
In 1 Thessalonians chapter 4, Paul is providing to the church at Thessalonica.

615
00:31:31,899 --> 00:31:37,899
By the way, the book of 1 and 2 Thessalonians are great books to study with regard to end times prophecy

616
00:31:37,899 --> 00:31:43,899
because every chapter deals with something with regard to the coming of the Lord.

617
00:31:43,899 --> 00:31:49,899
And by the way, you know what was happening in the time of the writing of the book of 1 and 2 Thessalonians?

618
00:31:49,899 --> 00:31:55,899
There were false teachers telling them false things about the coming of the Lord, the day of the Lord.

619
00:31:55,899 --> 00:32:01,899
So all the way back in the first century when Paul was writing and teaching, he had visited Thessalonica.

620
00:32:01,899 --> 00:32:05,899
He tells them, I taught you these things, I told you these things, but he's writing to them.

621
00:32:05,899 --> 00:32:07,899
He's giving to them truth.

622
00:32:07,899 --> 00:32:09,899
Why? Because there's some false teachers.

623
00:32:09,899 --> 00:32:13,899
The false teachers that tried to influence Thessalonica went so far

624
00:32:13,899 --> 00:32:21,899
as to try to send a counterfeit letter signed by Paul's name to try to deceive them.

625
00:32:21,899 --> 00:32:25,899
Listen, there are many antichrists.

626
00:32:25,899 --> 00:32:29,899
The spirit of antichrist doth work already according to what John says in 1 John.

627
00:32:29,899 --> 00:32:33,899
According to what we read in 2 Thessalonians chapter number 2 and 3,

628
00:32:33,899 --> 00:32:37,899
we begin to understand this and look in 1 Thessalonians chapter 4 beginning in verse number 13.

629
00:32:37,899 --> 00:32:41,899
The Bible says, but I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren.

630
00:32:41,899 --> 00:32:45,899
Aren't you thankful for that? God wants us to be informed.

631
00:32:45,899 --> 00:32:49,899
Concerning what? Concerning them which are asleep, or them that are died,

632
00:32:49,899 --> 00:32:51,899
that ye saw her not, even as others which have no hope.

633
00:32:51,899 --> 00:32:57,899
For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.

634
00:32:57,899 --> 00:33:01,899
Do we believe that? That word if carries with it the idea of since.

635
00:33:01,899 --> 00:33:05,899
It can be used that way. Since we believe this and we believe this.

636
00:33:05,899 --> 00:33:09,899
Listen, if you don't believe that Jesus died according to the Scriptures

637
00:33:09,899 --> 00:33:13,899
and rose again according to the Scriptures, then you're not saved.

638
00:33:13,899 --> 00:33:17,899
Amen? You can't be saved if you don't believe that.

639
00:33:17,899 --> 00:33:21,899
You can believe it and not be saved because you must understand that he did it for you

640
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:25,899
and you must accept what he did for you personally. Amen?

641
00:33:25,899 --> 00:33:29,899
And we believe this and notice what Paul says.

642
00:33:29,899 --> 00:33:33,899
For this we say unto you, notice verse 15, by the word of the Lord.

643
00:33:33,899 --> 00:33:39,899
This is not Paul's opinion. This is not that they had some kind of a church leadership meeting

644
00:33:39,899 --> 00:33:43,899
and they came up with here's how we're going to answer the question.

645
00:33:43,899 --> 00:33:47,899
No, it says that this is what we say unto you by the word of the Lord,

646
00:33:47,899 --> 00:33:53,899
that we which are alive and remain, notice what he says, unto the coming of the Lord.

647
00:33:53,899 --> 00:33:59,899
Paul believed that Jesus was coming again. Amen? He believed it. Why? Because Jesus said it.

648
00:33:59,899 --> 00:34:05,899
Paul didn't hear the voice when Jesus was speaking to the disciples in John 14,

649
00:34:05,899 --> 00:34:11,899
but he understood the truth. Remember, Paul had the opportunity to be taught by Jesus Christ.

650
00:34:11,899 --> 00:34:17,899
He said, this that I'm teaching, you read the book of Galatians, he said, I receive this with the revelation of Jesus Christ.

651
00:34:17,899 --> 00:34:23,899
Amen? And he says here, by the word of the Lord,

652
00:34:23,899 --> 00:34:27,899
that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.

653
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:31,899
You know what the word prevent means? It means to go before them.

654
00:34:31,899 --> 00:34:37,899
So what God is telling us is there's an order to this. By the way, that's consistent with Scripture. Why?

655
00:34:37,899 --> 00:34:41,899
Our God does all things decently and in order. Amen?

656
00:34:41,899 --> 00:34:45,899
So there's an order. He says that we shall not prevent them which are asleep.

657
00:34:45,899 --> 00:34:49,899
What does it mean to be asleep? Those that are dead in Christ.

658
00:34:49,899 --> 00:34:53,899
So we come to verse 16, for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven.

659
00:34:53,899 --> 00:34:57,899
This is consistent. What do the angels say at the ascension? Why stand you gazing up into heaven?

660
00:34:57,899 --> 00:35:03,899
This same Jesus, right? Is that what they say in Acts chapter 1?

661
00:35:03,899 --> 00:35:07,899
And so we find that the Bible says the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout,

662
00:35:07,899 --> 00:35:11,899
with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of God,

663
00:35:11,899 --> 00:35:15,899
and the dead in Christ shall rise first.

664
00:35:15,899 --> 00:35:22,899
Then, again, the order, then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds

665
00:35:22,899 --> 00:35:25,899
to meet the Lord in the air, and so shall we ever be with the Lord.

666
00:35:25,899 --> 00:35:28,899
Wherefore, comfort one another with these words.

667
00:35:28,899 --> 00:35:32,899
If you look in verse 17, right in the beginning of that verse, it says,

668
00:35:32,899 --> 00:35:36,899
then we which are alive and remain, notice this, shall be caught up.

669
00:35:36,899 --> 00:35:39,899
That's rapture.

670
00:35:39,899 --> 00:35:43,899
The Greek word there is where we get our English word rapture.

671
00:35:43,899 --> 00:35:49,899
So shall be caught up together with them. Notice what it says, in the clouds to meet the Lord where?

672
00:35:49,899 --> 00:35:52,899
In the air.

673
00:35:52,899 --> 00:35:55,899
In the air. That's different than on the earth.

674
00:35:55,899 --> 00:35:57,899
Do you agree?

675
00:35:57,899 --> 00:36:04,899
Jesus is coming back at the end of the tribulation with his saints,

676
00:36:04,899 --> 00:36:08,899
and he's going to put his foot on the Mount of Olives, right?

677
00:36:08,899 --> 00:36:11,899
Zechariah? Amen?

678
00:36:11,899 --> 00:36:13,899
You tracking this evening?

679
00:36:13,899 --> 00:36:18,899
And he's going to come all the way to earth. There's going to be a battle of Armageddon, right?

680
00:36:18,899 --> 00:36:20,899
That's what's going to happen.

681
00:36:20,899 --> 00:36:24,899
So here, we're meeting him in the air.

682
00:36:24,899 --> 00:36:28,899
So the rapture is when Christ comes back for his saints.

683
00:36:28,899 --> 00:36:32,899
The revelation of Jesus Christ, or the return of Jesus Christ,

684
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:37,899
is when he's coming back with his saints to the earth.

685
00:36:37,899 --> 00:36:39,899
You read Revelation 19, it's fascinating.

686
00:36:39,899 --> 00:36:43,899
I don't like horse riding, but I'm going to ride a horse, amen?

687
00:36:43,899 --> 00:36:47,899
I got on a horse one time in Tennessee, and I said, that's enough.

688
00:36:47,899 --> 00:36:50,899
And look, we're coming back with him.

689
00:36:50,899 --> 00:36:53,899
He's coming for us.

690
00:36:53,899 --> 00:36:55,899
We're going to meet him in the air.

691
00:36:55,899 --> 00:36:57,899
1 Thessalonians 4.

692
00:36:57,899 --> 00:37:01,899
Did you notice that the Bible says, with the trump of God?

693
00:37:01,899 --> 00:37:03,899
What did John hear?

694
00:37:03,899 --> 00:37:08,899
He said, after this, setting the separation,

695
00:37:08,899 --> 00:37:10,899
after this, the church age,

696
00:37:10,899 --> 00:37:14,899
I looked and I saw a door open in heaven, and I heard a voice, as it were,

697
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:17,899
a trumpet that said what?

698
00:37:17,899 --> 00:37:19,899
Come up hither.

699
00:37:19,899 --> 00:37:23,899
And immediately, he was in the Spirit.

700
00:37:23,899 --> 00:37:25,899
He's in the throne room of heaven.

701
00:37:25,899 --> 00:37:28,899
He sees the Lord on the throne, by the way.

702
00:37:28,899 --> 00:37:31,899
Right away. It's pretty awesome.

703
00:37:31,899 --> 00:37:37,899
So we find that here, the Bible says, wherefore, comfort one another with these words.

704
00:37:37,899 --> 00:37:40,899
Listen, we can look at 1 Thessalonians 4,

705
00:37:40,899 --> 00:37:43,899
and we can understand what God is teaching us,

706
00:37:43,899 --> 00:37:45,899
and understanding the teaching of the rapture,

707
00:37:45,899 --> 00:37:49,899
understanding this evening the order of the rapture, if you will,

708
00:37:49,899 --> 00:37:55,899
but we understand it's going to happen about that quick.

709
00:37:55,899 --> 00:37:56,899
How do we know that?

710
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:59,899
Well, turn over to 1 Corinthians chapter 15.

711
00:37:59,899 --> 00:38:03,899
In 1 Corinthians 15, we see another reference here that helps us in understanding this,

712
00:38:03,899 --> 00:38:11,899
which is revealed to us in Revelation chapter 4.

713
00:38:11,899 --> 00:38:18,899
1 Corinthians chapter 15, often a chapter that's referred to as the resurrection chapter, rightly so.

714
00:38:18,899 --> 00:38:21,899
We find here at the end, beginning in verse 51, it says,

715
00:38:21,899 --> 00:38:23,899
Behold, I show you a mystery.

716
00:38:23,899 --> 00:38:27,899
We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed.

717
00:38:27,899 --> 00:38:28,899
What does he mean by that?

718
00:38:28,899 --> 00:38:31,899
We're not going to all die, but we're all going to be changed.

719
00:38:31,899 --> 00:38:33,899
Right?

720
00:38:33,899 --> 00:38:35,899
Remember, the dead in Christ shall rise first.

721
00:38:35,899 --> 00:38:38,899
Those which are asleep in Jesus, they're going to rise first.

722
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:40,899
Then we which are alive and remain.

723
00:38:40,899 --> 00:38:41,899
But we're all going to be changed.

724
00:38:41,899 --> 00:38:43,899
Notice what he says in verse number 52.

725
00:38:43,899 --> 00:38:47,899
In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the, what does it say?

726
00:38:47,899 --> 00:38:54,899
The last trump, for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible,

727
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:58,899
and we shall be changed.

728
00:38:58,899 --> 00:39:00,899
He goes on to explain this.

729
00:39:00,899 --> 00:39:09,899
For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.

730
00:39:09,899 --> 00:39:12,899
Aren't you thankful for that Bible teaching?

731
00:39:12,899 --> 00:39:15,899
And we find that the Bible says, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye.

732
00:39:15,899 --> 00:39:19,899
It's faster than I can snap my fingers.

733
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:21,899
It's truly faster than you can blink your eye.

734
00:39:21,899 --> 00:39:23,899
It's faster than that.

735
00:39:23,899 --> 00:39:25,899
It's going to happen.

736
00:39:25,899 --> 00:39:28,899
And so we begin to look here at Revelation chapter 4,

737
00:39:28,899 --> 00:39:32,899
and I spend the entirety of our evening tonight looking at just these phrases

738
00:39:32,899 --> 00:39:35,899
that God gives us so that we can have an understanding

739
00:39:35,899 --> 00:39:38,899
as we go forward in our study of the book of Revelation

740
00:39:38,899 --> 00:39:43,899
that we see that God is helping us to be able to establish a timeline

741
00:39:43,899 --> 00:39:47,899
to understand after this, what is this?

742
00:39:47,899 --> 00:39:48,899
After what?

743
00:39:48,899 --> 00:39:49,899
What is he referring to?

744
00:39:49,899 --> 00:39:50,899
What is he giving to us?

745
00:39:50,899 --> 00:39:54,899
Well, it's the preceding chapters, 2 and 3, of the church age,

746
00:39:54,899 --> 00:39:58,899
that second division of the book of Revelation.

747
00:39:58,899 --> 00:40:00,899
The first one are the things which you see.

748
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:08,179
You see, the vision that John had in Revelation 1, followed by the things which are, chapters

749
00:40:08,179 --> 00:40:09,739
2 and 3.

750
00:40:09,739 --> 00:40:12,899
We're still in the church age.

751
00:40:12,899 --> 00:40:15,339
I believe we're in the last days.

752
00:40:15,339 --> 00:40:19,779
The Bible teaches us, we can read throughout the scriptures with regard to what the last

753
00:40:19,779 --> 00:40:26,899
days, what characterizes the last days, but we understand that we're to stay faithful.

754
00:40:26,899 --> 00:40:28,739
Amen?

755
00:40:28,739 --> 00:40:34,659
There's a need to stay faithful, to stay faithful to preaching the word.

756
00:40:34,659 --> 00:40:39,779
He tells us in 2 Timothy 4, he told us in 2 Timothy 3, the characteristics of the last

757
00:40:39,779 --> 00:40:43,659
days, the perilous times and all that's going to happen, but he says, continue there in

758
00:40:43,659 --> 00:40:44,659
chapter 3.

759
00:40:44,659 --> 00:40:47,499
And then he tells us in chapter 4 that we're to preach the word.

760
00:40:47,499 --> 00:40:48,499
Why?

761
00:40:48,499 --> 00:40:51,379
Listen, there's going to come a time when they will not endure sound doctrine.

762
00:40:51,379 --> 00:40:56,859
I believe that we very much live in a time in which people do not endure sound doctrine.

763
00:40:56,859 --> 00:40:59,459
And they want somebody to tickle their ears.

764
00:40:59,459 --> 00:41:02,859
And that's exactly what 2 Timothy chapter 4 says.

765
00:41:02,859 --> 00:41:03,859
And I think we're there.

766
00:41:03,859 --> 00:41:08,419
I was looking at a Baptist church website this afternoon.

767
00:41:08,419 --> 00:41:12,299
Not our Baptist church website, praise the Lord.

768
00:41:12,299 --> 00:41:17,579
But it was talking about all this stuff of inclusion and God loves you however you are,

769
00:41:17,579 --> 00:41:22,099
whatever you are, and we love you too, no exceptions and all this kind of stuff.

770
00:41:22,099 --> 00:41:31,979
Listen, I'm thankful that God loves the world, but God wants to save the sinner, amen.

771
00:41:31,979 --> 00:41:36,299
The power of the gospel is to transform a life.

772
00:41:36,299 --> 00:41:40,939
And we're living in the church age, but we're getting to that place as we look at the characteristics

773
00:41:40,939 --> 00:41:44,939
in 2 Timothy 3 where we're in the last days.

774
00:41:44,939 --> 00:41:47,259
And it's important for us to understand and see this.

775
00:41:47,259 --> 00:41:53,099
And so God tells us in Revelation 4, after this, I'm going to show you things which must

776
00:41:53,099 --> 00:41:54,099
be hereafter.

777
00:41:54,099 --> 00:41:57,139
We're going to see what's going to happen in the tribulation.

778
00:41:57,139 --> 00:41:59,599
We're going to see what's going to happen with the battle of Armageddon.

779
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:02,139
We're going to see what's going to happen in the millennial reign of Christ.

780
00:42:02,139 --> 00:42:07,219
We're going to have a little bit of a glimpse into the period of eternity as it's given

781
00:42:07,219 --> 00:42:09,739
to us in chapters 21 and 22.

782
00:42:09,739 --> 00:42:14,179
The millennium, as you look at the millennial reign of Christ, there's very limited information

783
00:42:14,179 --> 00:42:18,019
that's given to us in the book of Revelation and a whole host of information that's given

784
00:42:18,019 --> 00:42:22,499
to us in the prophets when you study the millennium.

785
00:42:22,499 --> 00:42:23,819
So how long are we going to be in this study?

786
00:42:23,819 --> 00:42:26,739
I have no idea.

787
00:42:26,739 --> 00:42:29,419
Even so, come Lord Jesus, amen.

788
00:42:29,419 --> 00:42:34,979
But the reality is that we find that God gives us this timeline and in between the after

789
00:42:34,979 --> 00:42:40,859
this and I'm going to show you things which must be hereafter, come up hither.

790
00:42:40,859 --> 00:42:42,459
He hears the voice.

791
00:42:42,459 --> 00:42:49,899
As it were, the Bible says a trumpet talking with me and immediately I was in the spirit.

792
00:42:49,899 --> 00:42:57,139
Next week we're going to focus more on dealing with this, why is there a rapture?

793
00:42:57,139 --> 00:42:59,179
Why is there a tribulation?

794
00:42:59,179 --> 00:43:01,659
What is the purpose for the tribulation?

795
00:43:01,659 --> 00:43:06,899
Can I tell you this evening, if you cannot answer the question why there's going to be

796
00:43:06,899 --> 00:43:10,819
a tribulation, if you do not know, and I'm not saying that it's a problem if you don't

797
00:43:11,379 --> 00:43:16,339
know, but what I'm saying is that if you don't know the purpose of the tribulation, how are

798
00:43:16,339 --> 00:43:20,779
you going to even begin to try to explain why there's going to be a rapture?

799
00:43:20,779 --> 00:43:23,419
Or when the rapture is going to occur?

800
00:43:23,419 --> 00:43:29,099
And so it's absolutely imperative for us as Bible students to understand proper hermeneutics

801
00:43:29,099 --> 00:43:33,659
to interpret the scriptures to be able to look, what is God doing?

802
00:43:33,659 --> 00:43:39,779
God has a plan and God's plan will come to pass.

803
00:43:39,779 --> 00:43:42,459
I'll give you another preview for next week.

804
00:43:42,459 --> 00:43:45,459
God's not done with Israel.

805
00:43:45,459 --> 00:43:49,339
He's dealing with the church right now.

806
00:43:49,339 --> 00:43:51,859
Jewish people can be part of the church.

807
00:43:51,859 --> 00:43:55,139
Paul was Jewish, right?

808
00:43:55,139 --> 00:43:59,779
In fact, a lot of them were Jewish, okay?

809
00:43:59,779 --> 00:44:03,579
But he's not done with Israel.

810
00:44:03,579 --> 00:44:06,019
And what's going to happen in the tribulation?

811
00:44:06,019 --> 00:44:09,699
All of a sudden Israel is front and center.

812
00:44:09,699 --> 00:44:10,699
That's what God's doing.

813
00:44:10,699 --> 00:44:14,899
We're going to look at that next week as we attempt to answer the question, when?

814
00:44:14,899 --> 00:44:19,019
Not that I'm going to give you a date of when, because that would be extremely foolish, because

815
00:44:19,019 --> 00:44:21,219
no man knows the hour.

816
00:44:21,219 --> 00:44:25,699
But it's important that we understand that even as we look at these things, that we are

817
00:44:25,699 --> 00:44:32,099
in that period of time of Revelation 2 and 3.

818
00:44:32,099 --> 00:44:34,059
It's not after this yet.

819
00:44:34,059 --> 00:44:39,419
And when the disciples asked Jesus in Acts 1, is it now the time that you're going to

820
00:44:40,139 --> 00:44:41,139
restore the kingdom to Israel?

821
00:44:41,139 --> 00:44:42,139
He said, it's not for you to know.

822
00:44:42,139 --> 00:44:43,139
The times are the seasons, right?

823
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:44,139
This is what he says.

824
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:45,139
I'm just paraphrasing.

825
00:44:45,139 --> 00:44:50,379
He says, but you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you.

826
00:44:50,379 --> 00:44:53,459
And you shall be witnesses unto me, both in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, the uttermost part

827
00:44:53,459 --> 00:44:54,459
of the earth.

828
00:44:54,459 --> 00:44:57,459
We have a responsibility today.

829
00:44:57,459 --> 00:44:59,979
It's important for us to know what's coming.

830
00:44:59,979 --> 00:45:06,579
We have a responsibility today, a responsibility today to live for Jesus, to honor and glorify

831
00:45:06,579 --> 00:45:12,099
Him, to exalt and magnify His name to a lost and dying world, that they may see our good

832
00:45:12,099 --> 00:45:17,579
works and glorify our Father which is in heaven, that they might know that God loves them,

833
00:45:17,579 --> 00:45:20,259
that Jesus died for them so they could go to heaven.

834
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:21,259
Let's pray.

835
00:45:21,259 --> 00:45:22,259
Father, we love You.

836
00:45:22,259 --> 00:45:23,499
We thank You for loving us.

837
00:45:23,499 --> 00:45:25,799
Thank You for Your Word tonight.

838
00:45:25,799 --> 00:45:31,659
I pray that we've been able to adequately understand the timeline and divisions that

839
00:45:31,659 --> 00:45:39,019
You've set forth here in the book of Revelation to help us understand these things which must

840
00:45:39,019 --> 00:45:40,019
be.

841
00:45:40,019 --> 00:45:46,539
I pray, God, that You'd help us to remain faithful in this era of church history.

842
00:45:46,539 --> 00:45:53,379
We believe we're nearing the end of the church age, but Lord, we do not know the hour, nor

843
00:45:53,379 --> 00:45:57,859
do we seek to set a timeline.

844
00:45:57,859 --> 00:46:01,619
I pray that You'd help us to be found faithful.

845
00:46:01,619 --> 00:46:03,579
God, that we'd live for You and honor You.

846
00:46:03,579 --> 00:46:13,019
Help us to have that hope that Paul refers to as he's writing to Titus, the blessed hope.

847
00:46:13,019 --> 00:46:14,259
What is the blessed hope?

848
00:46:14,259 --> 00:46:22,939
It's that confident expectation that we're going to see You, we're going to meet You

849
00:46:22,939 --> 00:46:26,299
in the air, and we'll ever be with You.

850
00:46:26,299 --> 00:46:28,599
Lord, we thank You for that.

851
00:46:28,599 --> 00:46:32,399
I pray that You'd bless over these next several weeks as we continue studying and setting

852
00:46:32,399 --> 00:46:37,719
forth the proper understanding of these things that You've provided to us.

853
00:46:37,719 --> 00:46:38,899
Give us wisdom, Lord.

854
00:46:38,899 --> 00:46:41,919
Give us understanding, and we'll thank You for it.

855
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:42,919
In Christ's name we pray.

856
00:46:42,919 --> 00:46:43,919
Would You stand with me?

857
00:46:43,919 --> 00:46:44,919
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

858
00:46:44,919 --> 00:46:45,919
Maybe we'll just stand with you.

859
00:46:45,919 --> 00:46:46,919
We thank You, Lord.

860
00:46:46,919 --> 00:46:47,919
We thank You, Lord.

861
00:46:47,919 --> 00:46:48,919
We thank You, Lord.

862
00:46:48,919 --> 00:46:48,919
