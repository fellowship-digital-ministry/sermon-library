WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.440
I am thankful for God's Word and for the clarity that He gives, and I look forward to dealing

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.560
with just one verse of Scripture this evening, but it's so foundational and so important

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.079
for us as we begin looking at the book of Revelation.

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:20.040
It'll definitely be a little bit more teachy tonight than preachy, and somebody made the

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:25.159
comment of Pastor getting excited tonight, and I said, well, it's a little more teachy

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:29.899
tonight than preachy, so I don't know that I'll get too excited, but we'll see what happens

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:32.180
with that, Revelation 4.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:38.819
And verse number one, notice what the Bible says, after this, John is speaking, of course,

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:46.200
after this, I looked, and behold, a door was opened in heaven, and the first voice which

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:55.419
I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me, which said, Come up hither, and I

00:00:55.419 --> 00:01:01.020
will show thee things which must be hereafter.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.919
I titled the message, as you've seen in the bulletin today, the things which shall be

00:01:05.919 --> 00:01:07.500
hereafter.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.860
And we're reminded of the importance that we look at the book of Revelation within the

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.819
context of what God has provided to us, and we must remember that back in chapter one,

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:21.419
God gave us the outline for the book of Revelation.

00:01:21.419 --> 00:01:25.900
So back to Revelation 1, and let me just share a few things with you by way of introduction

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:32.419
this evening, as we look back in Revelation chapter number one, in verse number 17, and

00:01:32.419 --> 00:01:36.379
we dealt with this several weeks ago, but the Bible says, and when I saw him, I fell

00:01:36.379 --> 00:01:41.300
at his feet as dead, and he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not, I

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.419
am the first and the last.

00:01:43.419 --> 00:01:48.900
I'm he that liveth and was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore, amen, and have the

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.660
keys of hell and of death.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:57.900
And then notice verse 19, Revelation 119 gives us, it provides to us the outline for the

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.739
entire book of Revelation.

00:01:59.739 --> 00:02:07.419
The Bible says this, write the things which thou hast seen, section one.

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:13.580
Then it says, and the things which are, section two, and then notice the last phrase, and

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.139
the things which shall be hereafter, section three.

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.059
So we begin to look at the divisions of the book of Revelation based on the outline that's

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:28.139
provided in Revelation 1 and verse 19, we find that section one, the things which thou

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:33.619
hast seen, is revealed to us in chapter number one of the book of Revelation.

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:36.460
Remember it was here in chapter number one where the Bible says the revelation of Jesus

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:42.660
Christ, which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:43.660
to pass.

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:49.059
It says, and he sent and signified it by his angel, notice, unto his servant John.

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:53.339
So this revelation was given to John, but we noted as we began studying this book that

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:55.080
it's for all of the servants.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.979
Notice it says that he should, to show unto his servants, plural.

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:05.300
So that the first division as outlined in Revelation 1 and 19 is the things which thou

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.800
hast seen, and so that's the vision of chapter number one.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.119
Division number two of the book of Revelation, the things which are, that's going to refer

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:16.880
to Revelation 2 and 3.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.080
We started those two chapters, it took us several weeks to go through, actually a couple

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.800
of months to go through chapters two and three, looking at the seven churches in Asia.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:31.039
We understand that's modern day Turkey, Asia Minor is the region in which it's being discussed,

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:35.520
and as we spoke about those particular letters that are written to the churches, we understand

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.220
that those churches are representative of the church age.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.339
We understand that they're literal churches that are being written to, and they're in

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:47.699
existence at the time of the writing, and Jesus Christ, the one that is the head of

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:53.580
the church, is doing an evaluation or an examination of the church, and he sends back a letter

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:59.300
through John to these seven churches, and we find that the things which are, that second

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:06.179
section in the outline that God provided to us in Revelation 1 and 19, are given to us

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:09.699
in Revelation 2 and 3.

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:15.940
Then we find that we come to the third section, where God tells us in Revelation 1 and 19,

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.859
the things which shall be hereafter.

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.140
Those things, according to the breakdown that we see within the text of Scripture and understanding

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:30.140
the book of Revelation, those are those things that are recorded from Revelation 4 to Revelation

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:31.140
22.

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:36.220
The things which shall be hereafter, if you were to take and divide that third section,

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:42.100
which obviously is the bulk of the book, amen, chapters 4 through chapter 22, the bulk of

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:47.339
the book, and those, that, that, the things that, which shall be hereafter, really breaks

00:04:47.339 --> 00:04:49.179
down into three sections.

00:04:49.179 --> 00:04:54.140
The first one is the tribulation, which is in chapter 6 through chapter 19.

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:55.859
You say, well, what about chapter 4 and 5?

00:04:55.859 --> 00:05:00.980
Well, God is giving us a glimpse in Revelation 4 and 5 into the throne room of heaven.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:06.140
And you remember, we mentioned this early on as we began studying the book of Revelation,

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.940
and we talked about several things with regard to how it, how we must look at the book of

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.459
Revelation and some principles that would guide our study of the book of Revelation.

00:05:14.459 --> 00:05:18.500
And one of the things that I mentioned to you in that very first message back in October

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:25.100
of last year, was that where, that there would be alternating scenes in the book of Revelation.

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.380
There'd be scenes where it's in heaven, and then scenes while it's on earth.

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:33.500
In Revelation 4 and 5, we see it from verse number 1 that we've read as our text this

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:34.500
evening.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.660
And if you read the entirety of chapter 4 and 5, this is a scene, a glimpse into the

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:42.339
throne room of heaven and what glorious scene it is.

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:47.459
And it's amazing when you read Revelation 4 and 5, it gives you just a spiritual goose

00:05:47.459 --> 00:05:50.980
bump, so to speak, and just encourage you greatly.

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:58.540
Then we find in chapter 6, where once again, the scene alternates back to earth, where

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:01.220
we begin seeing the tribulation.

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:05.859
Then we find in Revelation 20, the millennium, at the end of chapter 19, you begin to see

00:06:05.859 --> 00:06:09.380
the marriage supper of the Lamb, and all of that that's taking place, obviously, in heaven

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.420
while the tribulation is finishing here on earth.

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.619
And then followed by the millennial reign of Christ, the battle of Armageddon that leads

00:06:15.619 --> 00:06:21.940
in to Revelation 20 with the millennial reign of Christ, and then Revelation 21 and 22,

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:22.940
eternity.

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:27.059
And what a blessing to understand what God has given to us.

00:06:27.059 --> 00:06:32.500
As we begin to look at this book, we're reminded of some things that are important for us to

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:38.299
focus on as we really lay and study this evening verse 1 of chapter 4, so that we can have

00:06:38.299 --> 00:06:39.660
a good understanding.

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:44.859
I would say it this way, as we understand the verse of Scripture and look at three phrases

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:50.859
from Revelation 4.1, I believe that it will enable us to properly understand the content

00:06:50.859 --> 00:06:52.220
of this book.

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:53.619
Can I say this to you this evening?

00:06:53.619 --> 00:06:57.579
There's much confusion about the book of Revelation.

00:06:57.579 --> 00:06:59.019
I don't think you heard me.

00:06:59.019 --> 00:07:01.859
There's much confusion about the book of Revelation.

00:07:01.859 --> 00:07:04.179
Why is there so much confusion about the book of Revelation?

00:07:04.179 --> 00:07:09.779
Because everyone thinks they're a scholar on end-time prophecy because it's so interesting.

00:07:09.779 --> 00:07:14.299
You've got people who want to feast on it and feed on it, and you've got people that

00:07:14.299 --> 00:07:19.260
have all sorts of positions and opinions and so on and so forth.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:23.260
And you can go and you can just type in a couple of things in a Google search engine.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:28.500
You can look at YouTube and you're going to get video after video after video after video

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:34.899
after video of differing opinions about what's going to happen in the end times.

00:07:34.899 --> 00:07:37.220
And we find that it's a fascinating study.

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:38.679
It's an interesting study.

00:07:38.679 --> 00:07:44.239
We find that God told us in this particular book, in verse number 3 of chapter 1, blessed

00:07:44.239 --> 00:07:48.940
is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:51.480
which are written therein for the time is at hand.

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:54.279
And so we understand the importance of studying prophecy.

00:07:54.279 --> 00:08:00.679
You remember as we looked at in times past and looking at some things where the Samuel,

00:08:00.679 --> 00:08:05.160
the prophet Samuel when he was just a boy and God was calling to him and he said, speak

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.079
Lord for thy servant heareth.

00:08:08.079 --> 00:08:14.799
And he had given to God in that statement the importance of him having an ear to hear

00:08:14.799 --> 00:08:19.600
but the intent of obeying or doing what God would reveal to him.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:20.920
You know what's interesting?

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:24.720
God told him about things that were future.

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:27.119
God told him about things that were future.

00:08:27.119 --> 00:08:32.400
And we understand that as we begin to look at God's word, he has provided us with truth

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.919
with regard to the future.

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:40.760
We cannot get so consumed with studying prophecy that we forget to do what we're supposed to

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.320
do in the present.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.320
Amen?

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.159
And there's a fine line.

00:08:45.159 --> 00:08:50.599
It's a very difficult thing because you can get so consumed and so caught up in prophecy

00:08:50.599 --> 00:08:55.400
that you forget to do and to be what you're supposed to be today.

00:08:55.400 --> 00:09:00.400
You forget to be the light that you're to be and to be doing what God has commanded

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.059
us to do for today.

00:09:02.059 --> 00:09:06.820
So it's important that we know, it's important that we're settled and grounded.

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:09.859
As we begin to look at chapter number four and I begin to look at this, we're gonna spend

00:09:09.859 --> 00:09:12.820
a few weeks just on the first few verses of chapter four.

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:13.820
Why?

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:17.960
Because I believe that chapter four is a picture of the rapture.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:21.739
It provides for us clarity as to the rapture of the church.

00:09:21.739 --> 00:09:24.500
Now we're not gonna get into all of that this evening.

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:30.419
We're really gonna set the foundation tonight for then looking at next week, the picture

00:09:30.419 --> 00:09:35.500
that is here and then the repercussions or the byproduct of that in the following week

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:37.820
as we look at this passage of Scripture.

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:41.859
Why is it so important for us to understand?

00:09:41.859 --> 00:09:45.580
Why?

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:48.820
Why is it so important that we understand?

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:50.299
God said that we're to be settled and grounded.

00:09:50.299 --> 00:09:51.299
Amen?

00:09:51.299 --> 00:09:53.299
We're to be settled and grounded.

00:09:53.299 --> 00:09:56.580
We're to be able to contend for the faith.

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:59.859
And we understand today that as we look at God's word and we begin to...

00:09:59.859 --> 00:10:02.959
examine the scriptures, that we ought to be in a place

00:10:02.959 --> 00:10:06.639
where we are grounded in the truth,

00:10:06.639 --> 00:10:10.639
that we can defend our position biblically,

00:10:10.639 --> 00:10:13.599
that we can go, and if somebody were to ask of you,

00:10:13.599 --> 00:10:15.779
when do you believe, how do you believe,

00:10:15.779 --> 00:10:18.319
what's going to happen, that you can take the Bible

00:10:18.319 --> 00:10:21.139
and provide for them and answer why

00:10:21.139 --> 00:10:23.519
so that you're settled in your own heart,

00:10:24.419 --> 00:10:26.219
so that we're not tossed to and fro

00:10:26.219 --> 00:10:29.319
with every wind of doctrine, amen,

00:10:29.359 --> 00:10:32.879
that we have the stability that God provides us

00:10:32.879 --> 00:10:36.019
in his word, and so let's look at these three phrases

00:10:36.019 --> 00:10:37.859
in chapter four and verse number one,

00:10:37.859 --> 00:10:39.559
I'm not gonna look at them in order,

00:10:39.559 --> 00:10:40.799
we're gonna look at number one, number three,

00:10:40.799 --> 00:10:42.439
and then number two, but I'm gonna list them

00:10:42.439 --> 00:10:45.299
as one, two, and three, and so notice the first phrase

00:10:45.299 --> 00:10:49.339
that I note in this passage, it says after this,

00:10:49.339 --> 00:10:52.179
after this, the timeline for the book

00:10:52.179 --> 00:10:55.479
is being explained to us, we find that in chapter two

00:10:55.479 --> 00:10:58.019
and in chapter number three, all of the churches

00:10:58.019 --> 00:10:59.619
are addressed, those seven churches,

00:10:59.619 --> 00:11:02.219
remember, there were more churches in existence

00:11:02.219 --> 00:11:05.059
than just seven churches, but these are the churches

00:11:05.059 --> 00:11:07.859
that were written to because they're representative

00:11:07.859 --> 00:11:10.119
of the churches within the church age,

00:11:10.119 --> 00:11:12.039
I'm thankful, and we taught through it,

00:11:12.039 --> 00:11:14.559
we dealt with it quite extensively

00:11:14.559 --> 00:11:16.299
as we looked at chapters two and three,

00:11:16.299 --> 00:11:19.539
I do not believe that these seven churches

00:11:19.539 --> 00:11:21.839
are representative of periods of time

00:11:21.839 --> 00:11:24.819
within the church age, that we're in the last days,

00:11:24.819 --> 00:11:26.699
and so we're in the Laodicean period,

00:11:26.699 --> 00:11:29.699
and all we can do is be a Laodicean church,

00:11:29.699 --> 00:11:32.399
I don't believe that, that would be extremely unfortunate

00:11:32.399 --> 00:11:35.939
for us, I believe that we can have revival today,

00:11:35.939 --> 00:11:39.539
do I see a lot of the behaviors of the Laodiceans

00:11:39.539 --> 00:11:43.239
in the last days, absolutely, you just look around

00:11:43.239 --> 00:11:47.519
and you can see the spirit of the Laodicean church

00:11:47.519 --> 00:11:51.619
present in many of our churches today, we see it,

00:11:52.619 --> 00:11:55.559
but the reality is that we don't have to be

00:11:55.559 --> 00:11:58.999
a Laodicean church, and so we find that the Bible says

00:11:58.999 --> 00:12:02.599
after this, it's important that we understand after what,

00:12:02.599 --> 00:12:05.319
what is it that's being referenced here as we study

00:12:05.319 --> 00:12:10.239
and we look and we understand the truth of literature

00:12:10.239 --> 00:12:13.039
that here God has provided to us this book

00:12:13.039 --> 00:12:16.239
with regard to end times, and he says after this,

00:12:16.239 --> 00:12:19.119
after what, well after those letters are completed,

00:12:19.119 --> 00:12:23.399
after the literal churches that represent the church age,

00:12:23.399 --> 00:12:28.399
we find that after this, then John is immediately

00:12:28.519 --> 00:12:31.799
translated, we're gonna look at that in just a moment,

00:12:31.799 --> 00:12:34.199
but I want you to understand an important truth,

00:12:37.639 --> 00:12:40.539
from chapter four until chapter 19,

00:12:41.519 --> 00:12:44.799
there's no reference to the church on earth,

00:12:45.939 --> 00:12:48.079
so it's quite interesting that in chapter two

00:12:48.079 --> 00:12:52.999
and chapter three, the church, the church, the church,

00:12:53.839 --> 00:12:56.879
you get to chapter four, after this,

00:12:56.879 --> 00:12:59.679
John is caught up, he's translated,

00:12:59.679 --> 00:13:03.639
and there's no more reference to the church on earth,

00:13:03.639 --> 00:13:05.959
the reference to the church in Revelation 19

00:13:05.959 --> 00:13:08.159
is at the marriage supper of the lamb,

00:13:08.159 --> 00:13:10.279
and we only know that that's a reference to the church

00:13:10.279 --> 00:13:11.959
as we compare scripture with scripture

00:13:11.959 --> 00:13:14.419
because the word church is not used,

00:13:15.319 --> 00:13:17.319
but if you are a good hermeneutic student

00:13:17.319 --> 00:13:19.159
and you study scripture and you compare scripture

00:13:19.159 --> 00:13:21.519
with scripture, you understand that the church

00:13:21.519 --> 00:13:24.519
is the bride of Christ, and so we find that

00:13:24.519 --> 00:13:27.719
as we look at the text of scripture and we understand this,

00:13:27.719 --> 00:13:30.399
we begin to look at what's happening here

00:13:30.399 --> 00:13:33.679
and understanding this timeline, he says after this,

00:13:33.679 --> 00:13:35.999
notice the second phrase that we read,

00:13:35.999 --> 00:13:38.679
and it's not, again, it's not sequential in the text,

00:13:38.679 --> 00:13:40.639
I wanna look at the end of the text,

00:13:40.639 --> 00:13:44.199
where it says this, I will show thee things

00:13:44.199 --> 00:13:48.599
which must be hereafter, so this is the second statement,

00:13:48.599 --> 00:13:51.559
if you will, that I want you to focus on

00:13:51.559 --> 00:13:53.759
as we look at this verse of scripture,

00:13:53.759 --> 00:13:57.719
after this, the end of the church age,

00:13:57.719 --> 00:14:01.999
things which must be hereafter,

00:14:03.039 --> 00:14:05.639
that which is to be revealed will happen

00:14:05.639 --> 00:14:08.779
after the church age is completed,

00:14:08.779 --> 00:14:11.919
again, chapter four and five is a scene

00:14:11.919 --> 00:14:14.419
in the throne room of heaven, and we'll look at that

00:14:14.419 --> 00:14:15.879
as we study the next several weeks

00:14:15.919 --> 00:14:19.159
and seeing what God allows us to have of a glimpse

00:14:19.159 --> 00:14:20.759
into the throne room of heaven,

00:14:20.759 --> 00:14:23.039
and then immediately in verse number six,

00:14:23.039 --> 00:14:25.000
or chapter number six, we begin to look

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.119
at the great tribulation, and so those events

00:14:28.119 --> 00:14:30.759
that are referenced at the end of verse number one,

00:14:30.759 --> 00:14:34.679
I will show thee things which must be hereafter,

00:14:34.679 --> 00:14:38.719
it's going to be after the church age ends.

00:14:38.719 --> 00:14:41.239
It is important to note as we look at this text

00:14:41.239 --> 00:14:44.719
of scripture that the word says, or the Bible says,

00:14:44.719 --> 00:14:48.799
must be, it's an interesting word, or phrase,

00:14:48.799 --> 00:14:50.799
it's two words in our English language,

00:14:50.799 --> 00:14:54.159
but the idea of this is, notice this definition,

00:14:54.159 --> 00:14:58.439
it's necessity established by the counsel

00:14:58.439 --> 00:15:03.039
and decree of God, so all of a sudden,

00:15:03.039 --> 00:15:06.879
those words must be are pretty significant to us,

00:15:06.879 --> 00:15:10.559
so we find that he says, I will show thee things

00:15:10.559 --> 00:15:13.399
which must be hereafter.

00:15:13.399 --> 00:15:16.079
Let's begin to understand and look at the timeline here,

00:15:16.079 --> 00:15:18.919
and we say, okay, so these things must be hereafter,

00:15:18.919 --> 00:15:20.759
and so we understand, again, the timeline,

00:15:20.759 --> 00:15:23.479
as God is establishing for us, he provided us

00:15:23.479 --> 00:15:26.039
in Revelation chapter one and verse 19,

00:15:26.039 --> 00:15:29.359
that three-section outline for the book,

00:15:29.359 --> 00:15:32.159
and we find that he says, after this,

00:15:32.159 --> 00:15:36.039
things which must be hereafter, and so God is helping us

00:15:36.039 --> 00:15:39.799
to understand with great clarity what he's revealing

00:15:39.839 --> 00:15:43.319
to us in the book of Revelation, and so these things

00:15:43.319 --> 00:15:47.959
which must be hereafter are going to be recorded

00:15:47.959 --> 00:15:51.159
and revealed to us so that we would understand

00:15:51.159 --> 00:15:53.279
the plan that God has.

00:15:53.279 --> 00:15:55.759
Now, remember, as we begin to study this

00:15:55.759 --> 00:15:59.119
and look through the truth of this book of Revelation,

00:15:59.119 --> 00:16:02.079
that as we look here and we begin to realize

00:16:02.079 --> 00:16:05.279
what God is doing and what God is revealing to us,

00:16:05.279 --> 00:16:08.239
that number one, it causes us, it should cause us

00:16:08.239 --> 00:16:12.000
to rejoice and to glorify and praise our God, why?

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.719
Because it is the revelation of Jesus Christ,

00:16:15.719 --> 00:16:18.679
and so we understand that he is the one

00:16:18.679 --> 00:16:21.039
that is to be exalted and magnified,

00:16:21.039 --> 00:16:23.239
and we are to have that perspective

00:16:23.239 --> 00:16:24.419
as we study through the book.

00:16:24.419 --> 00:16:27.359
We also understand that it brings us to a place

00:16:27.359 --> 00:16:30.919
where we are going to agree with God.

00:16:30.919 --> 00:16:32.159
God has a plan.

00:16:33.479 --> 00:16:35.179
Do you believe that tonight?

00:16:35.179 --> 00:16:37.579
Listen, God has a plan for the ages.

00:16:38.459 --> 00:16:40.659
God has a plan for your life.

00:16:40.659 --> 00:16:41.659
He has a plan for my life.

00:16:41.659 --> 00:16:43.259
He has a plan for our lives.

00:16:43.259 --> 00:16:45.739
He has a plan for us, and we begin to understand

00:16:45.739 --> 00:16:48.139
this evening that as we look at this

00:16:48.139 --> 00:16:51.779
and we understand the revelation of Jesus Christ

00:16:51.779 --> 00:16:55.659
and the plan that God has for us, it causes us to rejoice

00:16:55.659 --> 00:16:58.319
and it causes us to accept the plan, why?

00:16:58.319 --> 00:17:00.979
Because his plan is perfect.

00:17:00.979 --> 00:17:02.899
Now, let me say this because the Bible says,

00:17:02.899 --> 00:17:07.379
and I will show thee things which must be hereafter.

00:17:07.379 --> 00:17:10.299
So often the question is this, when?

00:17:11.939 --> 00:17:12.979
How long?

00:17:12.979 --> 00:17:14.259
What's the timeline?

00:17:14.259 --> 00:17:15.899
What's the period?

00:17:15.899 --> 00:17:17.419
I begin to answer those questions.

00:17:17.419 --> 00:17:19.959
I begin to have that discussion.

00:17:19.959 --> 00:17:22.059
Remember back in Revelation chapter one,

00:17:22.059 --> 00:17:25.379
notice again as we begin reading this book of Revelation,

00:17:25.379 --> 00:17:29.419
notice what God says in Revelation one and verse number one.

00:17:30.419 --> 00:17:33.099
Revelation one and verse number one,

00:17:33.099 --> 00:17:35.179
the Bible says the revelation of Jesus Christ,

00:17:35.179 --> 00:17:37.979
which God gave unto him to show unto his servants

00:17:37.979 --> 00:17:41.659
things which must shortly come to pass.

00:17:41.659 --> 00:17:44.119
And he sent and signified it by his angel

00:17:44.119 --> 00:17:45.619
unto his servant, John.

00:17:45.619 --> 00:17:47.500
And so we find that the Bible says right here

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:50.539
in Revelation one, one, things which must shortly

00:17:50.539 --> 00:17:51.500
come to pass.

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:53.679
In chapter four and verse number one,

00:17:53.679 --> 00:17:55.939
the Bible says that I will show thee things

00:17:55.939 --> 00:17:57.899
which must be hereafter.

00:17:57.899 --> 00:18:00.159
So what happens is if we're not careful,

00:18:00.159 --> 00:18:02.819
we can interpret this incorrectly

00:18:02.819 --> 00:18:05.979
and kind of get messed up on the timeline.

00:18:05.979 --> 00:18:08.379
Can I say to you that the word as we look here

00:18:08.379 --> 00:18:10.699
in Revelation chapter number one and verse number one,

00:18:10.699 --> 00:18:13.219
the word shortly, there is a difference

00:18:13.219 --> 00:18:17.179
between immediate and imminent.

00:18:17.179 --> 00:18:18.539
There's a difference.

00:18:18.539 --> 00:18:21.379
Furthermore, as we begin to look at this truth

00:18:21.379 --> 00:18:24.859
of what Jesus is giving to John and to us,

00:18:24.859 --> 00:18:27.419
we must remember that God is outside of time.

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:31.739
A day is 1,000 years, 1,000 years as a day.

00:18:31.739 --> 00:18:32.979
We read that in Psalm 90.

00:18:32.979 --> 00:18:35.419
We read that in 2 Peter chapter three.

00:18:35.419 --> 00:18:37.880
And so we understand that God is outside of time.

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:39.419
Furthermore, let me say this.

00:18:39.419 --> 00:18:42.140
When you begin to read this truth,

00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:44.219
that the Bible says that these things

00:18:44.219 --> 00:18:45.859
in chapter one and verse number one

00:18:45.859 --> 00:18:48.099
must shortly come to pass,

00:18:48.099 --> 00:18:50.039
all of a sudden what you begin to understand

00:18:50.039 --> 00:18:52.579
as you study this out is not so long,

00:18:52.579 --> 00:18:56.059
not so much with regard to how soon they will happen,

00:18:56.059 --> 00:19:01.059
but how quickly they will happen once it goes into action.

00:19:01.219 --> 00:19:02.579
What do I mean by that?

00:19:02.579 --> 00:19:07.239
Well, the reality is that to even the Old Testament prophets

00:19:07.239 --> 00:19:11.059
the time of the church age was really unknown to them.

00:19:11.059 --> 00:19:14.500
The apostle Paul references regularly in his epistles

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:18.619
about the mystery, speaking of the mystery of the church.

00:19:18.619 --> 00:19:21.299
And the church would be made up of Jew and Gentile,

00:19:21.299 --> 00:19:22.739
both saved the same way.

00:19:22.739 --> 00:19:25.500
By the way, the cross is only one way to be saved, amen.

00:19:25.579 --> 00:19:26.899
And that's Jesus Christ.

00:19:26.899 --> 00:19:29.539
There's not a Jewish way and a Gentile way.

00:19:29.539 --> 00:19:31.260
There's one way to be saved.

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:33.899
And we find that as we look at the New Testament,

00:19:33.899 --> 00:19:37.619
the church is the body of Christ, the bride of Christ

00:19:37.619 --> 00:19:39.899
that's made up of Jew and Gentile.

00:19:39.899 --> 00:19:43.479
It's a mystery to the Old Testament.

00:19:43.479 --> 00:19:48.179
We understand that God gave us progressive revelation.

00:19:48.179 --> 00:19:49.619
And as we begin to look here,

00:19:49.619 --> 00:19:51.579
we begin to understand the timeline

00:19:51.579 --> 00:19:52.659
of the book of Revelation,

00:19:52.659 --> 00:19:54.459
it's important that we understand

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:55.899
that when he says shortly,

00:19:55.899 --> 00:20:00.899
it doesn't mean that if the book was written in 90, 95, 80.

00:20:00.899 --> 00:20:04.899
that these events were going to happen in 100 A.D.

00:20:04.899 --> 00:20:07.899
That's not what God intended for us to understand.

00:20:07.899 --> 00:20:10.899
When He says shortly, the idea is not the timeline

00:20:10.899 --> 00:20:14.899
as much as the swiftness of the events taking place

00:20:14.899 --> 00:20:16.899
once they begin.

00:20:16.899 --> 00:20:19.899
See, we don't know how long the church age is.

00:20:19.899 --> 00:20:21.899
We don't know.

00:20:21.899 --> 00:20:23.899
We know when the church age began,

00:20:23.899 --> 00:20:25.899
and we know at what point it will end

00:20:25.899 --> 00:20:27.899
with the rapture of the church,

00:20:27.899 --> 00:20:31.899
but we do not know that definitive timing.

00:20:31.899 --> 00:20:33.899
It's unknown to us.

00:20:33.899 --> 00:20:36.899
By the way, that should cause us to live

00:20:36.899 --> 00:20:39.899
with a measure of urgency,

00:20:39.899 --> 00:20:41.899
because today could be the end.

00:20:41.899 --> 00:20:43.899
It could be the rapture.

00:20:43.899 --> 00:20:45.899
Listen for the trumpet. Jesus is coming.

00:20:45.899 --> 00:20:47.899
Amen?

00:20:47.899 --> 00:20:49.899
And the reality is that we live in a time

00:20:49.899 --> 00:20:51.899
in which we look at this, and again,

00:20:51.899 --> 00:20:53.899
as we look at the outline, chapter 1,

00:20:53.899 --> 00:20:55.899
the things which thou hast seen,

00:20:55.899 --> 00:20:57.899
that vision that he received,

00:20:57.899 --> 00:21:00.899
is according to Revelation 1 and verse 19,

00:21:00.899 --> 00:21:02.899
the things that thou hast seen,

00:21:02.899 --> 00:21:04.899
and then the things which are, the church age,

00:21:04.899 --> 00:21:06.899
and the things which must be hereafter,

00:21:06.899 --> 00:21:08.899
and we find that it's very interesting

00:21:08.899 --> 00:21:10.899
that the bulk of the book,

00:21:10.899 --> 00:21:12.899
chapter 4 and following,

00:21:12.899 --> 00:21:15.899
chapter 4 and 5, the throne room of heaven,

00:21:15.899 --> 00:21:17.899
you get to chapter number 6.

00:21:17.899 --> 00:21:19.899
You know how quickly things happen

00:21:19.899 --> 00:21:21.899
beginning in chapter number 6?

00:21:21.899 --> 00:21:23.899
A seal is open.

00:21:23.899 --> 00:21:25.899
It explains it. A seal is open.

00:21:25.899 --> 00:21:27.899
It explains it. A seal is open.

00:21:27.899 --> 00:21:31.899
It explains it. I mean, it happens quick.

00:21:31.899 --> 00:21:33.899
You begin to read chapter number 6,

00:21:33.899 --> 00:21:37.899
and it's, you know, people don't understand

00:21:37.899 --> 00:21:41.899
how terrible the tribulation really is going to be.

00:21:41.899 --> 00:21:43.899
They have no idea.

00:21:43.899 --> 00:21:45.899
You begin to read chapter 6,

00:21:45.899 --> 00:21:47.899
and I don't want to get too far ahead of myself

00:21:47.899 --> 00:21:49.899
because we'll be there in a few weeks,

00:21:49.899 --> 00:21:51.899
but you begin to read in chapter number 6,

00:21:51.899 --> 00:21:53.899
and how many people die

00:21:53.899 --> 00:21:56.899
within just the first few of those seals being open.

00:21:56.899 --> 00:22:01.899
Listen, this world has never seen anything like it.

00:22:01.899 --> 00:22:04.899
Ever.

00:22:04.899 --> 00:22:06.899
You thought COVID was bad?

00:22:06.899 --> 00:22:09.899
I'm not trying to be funny.

00:22:09.899 --> 00:22:12.899
This is another level.

00:22:12.899 --> 00:22:14.899
It's going to be terrible.

00:22:14.899 --> 00:22:17.899
And so we find that some would define,

00:22:17.899 --> 00:22:20.899
as they begin to try to pinpoint the timing

00:22:20.899 --> 00:22:22.899
of what's happening here in Revelation chapter 4

00:22:22.899 --> 00:22:24.899
and verse number 1,

00:22:24.899 --> 00:22:26.899
and they would try to look at this as after this

00:22:26.899 --> 00:22:28.899
and the things which must be hereafter,

00:22:28.899 --> 00:22:30.899
and they try to talk about the rapture,

00:22:30.899 --> 00:22:32.899
and they'll put the rapture at different points

00:22:32.899 --> 00:22:34.899
of the tribulation.

00:22:34.899 --> 00:22:36.899
Our doctrinal statement, my position,

00:22:36.899 --> 00:22:38.899
I mention it often,

00:22:38.899 --> 00:22:41.899
is that we would be a pre-trib rapture.

00:22:41.899 --> 00:22:43.899
It's what we believe.

00:22:43.899 --> 00:22:47.899
By the way, it's not a belief that's built on convenience.

00:22:47.899 --> 00:22:51.899
Sometimes you hold a pre-tribulation rapture position.

00:22:51.899 --> 00:22:53.899
You're accused of others

00:22:53.899 --> 00:22:56.899
that you just have that position based on convenience.

00:22:56.899 --> 00:22:58.899
What do they mean by that?

00:22:58.899 --> 00:23:00.899
Well, you just don't want to go through the tribulation,

00:23:00.899 --> 00:23:02.899
and so it's just a doctrine of convenience.

00:23:02.899 --> 00:23:04.899
Can I tell you this evening,

00:23:04.899 --> 00:23:06.899
I don't want to go through the tribulation,

00:23:06.899 --> 00:23:09.899
but it's not a doctrine of convenience.

00:23:09.899 --> 00:23:11.899
I believe it's biblically accurate.

00:23:11.899 --> 00:23:13.899
And I believe that as you study

00:23:13.899 --> 00:23:15.899
and compare Scripture with Scripture,

00:23:15.899 --> 00:23:17.899
you will see the truth,

00:23:17.899 --> 00:23:20.899
and we can't get into all of it this evening for sake of time,

00:23:20.899 --> 00:23:23.899
but you will understand why we come to the position

00:23:23.899 --> 00:23:27.899
that we come to as to the timing of the rapture.

00:23:27.899 --> 00:23:31.899
I will say this as kind of an intro to next week's message.

00:23:31.899 --> 00:23:35.899
You must understand why there's going to be a tribulation.

00:23:35.899 --> 00:23:38.899
You must understand why there's going to be a rapture,

00:23:38.899 --> 00:23:42.899
and then you try to answer when.

00:23:42.899 --> 00:23:46.899
If you do not adequately understand the why,

00:23:46.899 --> 00:23:49.899
you will have a really hard time understanding the when,

00:23:49.899 --> 00:23:51.899
and that's how we'll address it.

00:23:51.899 --> 00:23:53.899
And you understand, so we have that position.

00:23:53.899 --> 00:23:56.899
There are some that say, well, it's a mid-trib position,

00:23:56.899 --> 00:23:58.899
that there's a mid-trib rapture.

00:23:58.899 --> 00:24:01.899
And what they often will use as another phrase

00:24:01.899 --> 00:24:05.899
to describe that is a pre-wrath rapture.

00:24:05.899 --> 00:24:08.899
Can I tell you that if you read chapter 6

00:24:08.899 --> 00:24:10.899
beginning in verse number 1,

00:24:10.899 --> 00:24:16.899
there's no way that you can say that's not wrath.

00:24:16.899 --> 00:24:20.899
And then there's a post-trib position.

00:24:20.899 --> 00:24:23.899
There are some that don't believe in a rapture at all,

00:24:23.899 --> 00:24:25.899
they don't believe in a millennial,

00:24:25.899 --> 00:24:28.899
they take everything very allegorical, so on and so forth.

00:24:28.899 --> 00:24:30.899
We take the Bible literal.

00:24:30.899 --> 00:24:33.899
We begin to look here and we begin to understand

00:24:33.899 --> 00:24:36.899
that God is helping us to understand this timeline

00:24:36.899 --> 00:24:39.899
after this, after what?

00:24:39.899 --> 00:24:40.899
Well, the church age.

00:24:40.899 --> 00:24:42.899
These seven churches are written to,

00:24:42.899 --> 00:24:45.899
and we find that they're representative of this church age

00:24:45.899 --> 00:24:50.899
that we have had the opportunity to live in and serve in,

00:24:50.899 --> 00:24:53.899
that we've had the opportunity to read history of.

00:24:53.899 --> 00:24:56.899
Listen, reading and studying church history is fascinating.

00:24:56.899 --> 00:25:00.899
It's exciting to see how God has worked and what God has done

00:25:00.899 --> 00:25:04.899
and how the gospel got to us and to other regions.

00:25:04.899 --> 00:25:08.899
I was reading just this afternoon about a missionary

00:25:08.899 --> 00:25:11.899
that went and because of another missionary that was martyred,

00:25:11.899 --> 00:25:14.899
how they went to a field and as they were in that field,

00:25:14.899 --> 00:25:17.899
that place today is modern-day Nigeria

00:25:17.899 --> 00:25:19.899
and just the work that they were doing there

00:25:19.899 --> 00:25:21.899
as the gospel was going forward.

00:25:21.899 --> 00:25:24.899
And I was encouraged greatly to understand

00:25:24.899 --> 00:25:27.899
another aspect of church history.

00:25:27.899 --> 00:25:28.899
God is working.

00:25:28.899 --> 00:25:33.899
We have the privilege of being involved in church history.

00:25:33.899 --> 00:25:36.899
But the church is going to end at some point.

00:25:36.899 --> 00:25:38.899
And what is it that ends the church?

00:25:38.899 --> 00:25:41.899
It's the rapture after this.

00:25:41.899 --> 00:25:45.899
And then he says these things which must be hereafter.

00:25:45.899 --> 00:25:49.899
Understand with me that as we look at chapter 4 and verse number 1

00:25:49.899 --> 00:25:53.899
that God is helping us to be able to understand

00:25:53.899 --> 00:25:57.899
what is going to happen and it must come to pass.

00:25:57.899 --> 00:26:00.899
God always does what he says he will do.

00:26:00.899 --> 00:26:01.899
Amen.

00:26:01.899 --> 00:26:02.899
I believe that.

00:26:02.899 --> 00:26:05.899
You remember we just had Resurrection Sunday, Easter Sunday.

00:26:05.899 --> 00:26:08.899
They come to the grave early that morning to the sepulcher.

00:26:08.899 --> 00:26:09.899
And what do they find?

00:26:09.899 --> 00:26:12.899
They find the stone is rolled away and the angel's there

00:26:12.899 --> 00:26:15.899
and they say, why seek ye the living among the dead?

00:26:15.899 --> 00:26:17.899
And if you read Matthew's gospel, it says,

00:26:17.899 --> 00:26:22.899
he is not here for he is risen as he said.

00:26:22.899 --> 00:26:26.899
Our God always does what he says he will do.

00:26:26.899 --> 00:26:28.899
And when we look at the book of Revelation,

00:26:28.899 --> 00:26:32.899
God is providing for his servants, plural,

00:26:32.899 --> 00:26:34.899
according to Revelation 1 and 1,

00:26:34.899 --> 00:26:38.899
the opportunity for us to understand these things

00:26:38.899 --> 00:26:42.899
which must be hereafter.

00:26:42.899 --> 00:26:44.899
So we find that there are these two phrases

00:26:44.899 --> 00:26:48.899
as book ends to Revelation 4 and verse number 1.

00:26:48.899 --> 00:26:51.899
So then come back with me now and look at chapter 4 and verse number 1.

00:26:51.899 --> 00:26:55.899
The Bible says after this, notice,

00:26:55.899 --> 00:27:00.899
I looked and behold, a door was opened.

00:27:00.899 --> 00:27:02.899
What does it say?

00:27:02.899 --> 00:27:03.899
Earth and heaven.

00:27:03.899 --> 00:27:05.899
Remember, I mentioned at the beginning of this study

00:27:05.899 --> 00:27:08.899
that there would be these alternating scenes

00:27:08.899 --> 00:27:10.899
between earth and heaven.

00:27:10.899 --> 00:27:12.899
Chapter 2 and 3, where's the scene?

00:27:12.899 --> 00:27:14.899
The scene is on earth.

00:27:14.899 --> 00:27:15.899
The churches, right?

00:27:15.899 --> 00:27:17.899
They're literal churches.

00:27:17.899 --> 00:27:19.899
Under the church at Ephesus, right?

00:27:19.899 --> 00:27:20.899
Under the church at Sardis, right?

00:27:20.899 --> 00:27:22.899
Under the church at Smyrna, right?

00:27:22.899 --> 00:27:24.899
And we read these are literal churches.

00:27:24.899 --> 00:27:26.899
You can go back and you can find out historically

00:27:26.899 --> 00:27:29.899
where they were located, what they were known for.

00:27:29.899 --> 00:27:31.899
All of that stuff, it's available.

00:27:31.899 --> 00:27:34.899
It is a scene that is on earth.

00:27:34.899 --> 00:27:37.899
But after this, the Bible says that John,

00:27:37.899 --> 00:27:39.899
he says, I looked and behold,

00:27:39.899 --> 00:27:43.899
a door was opened in heaven.

00:27:43.899 --> 00:27:45.899
So we now are going to understand

00:27:45.899 --> 00:27:48.899
why chapters 4 and 5 are giving to us

00:27:48.899 --> 00:27:52.899
that alternating scene of now the throne room in heaven.

00:27:52.899 --> 00:27:53.899
And the Bible says,

00:27:53.899 --> 00:27:58.899
and the first voice which I heard.

00:27:58.899 --> 00:28:02.899
Every word of God is pure.

00:28:02.899 --> 00:28:06.899
And God tells us that as John is writing this testimony,

00:28:06.899 --> 00:28:08.899
he says, the first voice which I heard

00:28:08.899 --> 00:28:12.899
was as it were, notice this,

00:28:12.899 --> 00:28:17.899
of a trumpet talking with me.

00:28:17.899 --> 00:28:18.899
Wow.

00:28:18.899 --> 00:28:20.899
What's the third phrase?

00:28:20.899 --> 00:28:22.899
Well, it's there.

00:28:22.899 --> 00:28:26.899
Come up hither.

00:28:26.899 --> 00:28:28.899
We find the first phrase after this,

00:28:28.899 --> 00:28:29.899
the second phrase,

00:28:29.899 --> 00:28:31.899
and I will show thee things which must be hereafter.

00:28:31.899 --> 00:28:34.899
But this third phrase, which sequentially in the verse,

00:28:34.899 --> 00:28:36.899
I understand is the second phrase,

00:28:36.899 --> 00:28:40.899
is come up hither.

00:28:40.899 --> 00:28:43.899
We begin to understand that as John is writing

00:28:43.899 --> 00:28:45.899
and he says that he hears this voice

00:28:45.899 --> 00:28:47.899
and the voice was as it were,

00:28:47.899 --> 00:28:49.899
of a trumpet talking with me,

00:28:49.899 --> 00:28:52.899
which said, come up hither.

00:28:52.899 --> 00:28:54.899
The Bible says in verse number two,

00:28:54.899 --> 00:28:56.899
immediately I was in the spirit

00:28:56.899 --> 00:28:58.899
and behold, a throne was set in heaven

00:28:58.899 --> 00:28:59.899
and one sat on the throne.

00:28:59.899 --> 00:29:02.899
He's immediately transported to heaven.

00:29:02.899 --> 00:29:04.899
He sees, the Bible says after this,

00:29:04.899 --> 00:29:07.899
he looks up and he sees this door

00:29:07.899 --> 00:29:09.899
that's open to heaven and he hears this voice.

00:29:09.899 --> 00:29:11.899
The first voice that he heard

00:29:11.899 --> 00:29:13.899
was as it were of a trumpet talking with him

00:29:13.899 --> 00:29:15.899
that said, come up hither.

00:29:15.899 --> 00:29:18.899
And immediately the voice continued and said,

00:29:18.899 --> 00:29:20.899
I'm going to show you things which must be hereafter.

00:29:20.899 --> 00:29:22.899
Immediately he's in the spirit

00:29:22.899 --> 00:29:25.899
and he's in the very throne room of heaven.

00:29:25.899 --> 00:29:27.899
It's amazing.

00:29:27.899 --> 00:29:30.899
It's amazing to be able to understand

00:29:30.899 --> 00:29:33.899
as God is revealing for you and for me

00:29:33.899 --> 00:29:36.899
and for all of his servants throughout this church age

00:29:36.899 --> 00:29:40.899
as he's provided to us a preserved copy of his word

00:29:40.899 --> 00:29:42.899
that we could have some clarity

00:29:42.899 --> 00:29:45.899
with regard to what's going to happen.

00:29:45.899 --> 00:29:49.899
Now I think it'd be awesome to be here during the rapture.

00:29:49.899 --> 00:29:52.899
I think that for generations of believers

00:29:52.899 --> 00:29:54.899
that have understood the teaching of God's word

00:29:54.899 --> 00:29:56.899
with regard to the rapture,

00:29:56.899 --> 00:29:58.899
they also have believed it'd be awesome to live

00:29:58.899 --> 00:30:00.899
during the time of the rapture.

00:30:00.899 --> 00:30:04.899
We may not be here when the trumpet sounds.

00:30:04.899 --> 00:30:07.899
Death may come to us first through whatever means it may be.

00:30:07.899 --> 00:30:10.899
We don't know when we're going to die.

00:30:10.899 --> 00:30:17.899
It would be a great thing if we were in the position that John is here in Revelation 4 and verse 1.

00:30:17.899 --> 00:30:21.899
Notice with me a couple of thoughts with regard to this phrase,

00:30:21.899 --> 00:30:23.899
come up hither.

00:30:23.899 --> 00:30:25.899
We understand the idea of come up.

00:30:25.899 --> 00:30:26.899
He's ascending.

00:30:26.899 --> 00:30:28.899
He's being caught up.

00:30:28.899 --> 00:30:30.899
He's being raptured, if you will.

00:30:30.899 --> 00:30:32.899
And the Bible says come up where?

00:30:32.899 --> 00:30:33.899
Hither.

00:30:33.899 --> 00:30:35.899
So we know that that's to heaven.

00:30:35.899 --> 00:30:39.899
And I want you to understand this evening, there's some that would criticize the teaching of the rapture

00:30:39.899 --> 00:30:44.899
and say, well, the word rapture is not anywhere found in the Bible, in the English Bible.

00:30:44.899 --> 00:30:48.899
You know that the word dinosaur is not in the English Bible either?

00:30:48.899 --> 00:30:49.899
It's not.

00:30:49.899 --> 00:30:51.899
Dinosaur is not in here.

00:30:51.899 --> 00:30:54.899
Does anyone know why the word dinosaur is not in our Bibles?

00:30:54.899 --> 00:30:55.899
Does anyone know?

00:30:55.899 --> 00:30:56.899
Jeff?

00:30:57.899 --> 00:31:01.899
It wasn't invented until like 1822 or something.

00:31:01.899 --> 00:31:02.899
The word.

00:31:02.899 --> 00:31:03.899
Dinosaur.

00:31:03.899 --> 00:31:05.899
Didn't exist.

00:31:05.899 --> 00:31:07.899
Does it mean that dinosaurs didn't exist?

00:31:07.899 --> 00:31:09.899
Does it mean that the Bible doesn't know about dinosaurs?

00:31:09.899 --> 00:31:12.899
No, it doesn't mean that at all.

00:31:12.899 --> 00:31:16.899
And so the idea of the word rapture is to be caught up.

00:31:16.899 --> 00:31:18.899
So he says come up hither.

00:31:18.899 --> 00:31:21.899
But notice what the Bible says in 1 Thessalonians chapter number 4,

00:31:22.899 --> 00:31:27.899
where God is giving to us an outline with regard to this event that we would refer to as being the rapture.

00:31:27.899 --> 00:31:31.899
In 1 Thessalonians chapter 4, Paul is providing to the church at Thessalonica.

00:31:31.899 --> 00:31:37.899
By the way, the book of 1 and 2 Thessalonians are great books to study with regard to end times prophecy

00:31:37.899 --> 00:31:43.899
because every chapter deals with something with regard to the coming of the Lord.

00:31:43.899 --> 00:31:49.899
And by the way, you know what was happening in the time of the writing of the book of 1 and 2 Thessalonians?

00:31:49.899 --> 00:31:55.899
There were false teachers telling them false things about the coming of the Lord, the day of the Lord.

00:31:55.899 --> 00:32:01.899
So all the way back in the first century when Paul was writing and teaching, he had visited Thessalonica.

00:32:01.899 --> 00:32:05.899
He tells them, I taught you these things, I told you these things, but he's writing to them.

00:32:05.899 --> 00:32:07.899
He's giving to them truth.

00:32:07.899 --> 00:32:09.899
Why? Because there's some false teachers.

00:32:09.899 --> 00:32:13.899
The false teachers that tried to influence Thessalonica went so far

00:32:13.899 --> 00:32:21.899
as to try to send a counterfeit letter signed by Paul's name to try to deceive them.

00:32:21.899 --> 00:32:25.899
Listen, there are many antichrists.

00:32:25.899 --> 00:32:29.899
The spirit of antichrist doth work already according to what John says in 1 John.

00:32:29.899 --> 00:32:33.899
According to what we read in 2 Thessalonians chapter number 2 and 3,

00:32:33.899 --> 00:32:37.899
we begin to understand this and look in 1 Thessalonians chapter 4 beginning in verse number 13.

00:32:37.899 --> 00:32:41.899
The Bible says, but I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren.

00:32:41.899 --> 00:32:45.899
Aren't you thankful for that? God wants us to be informed.

00:32:45.899 --> 00:32:49.899
Concerning what? Concerning them which are asleep, or them that are died,

00:32:49.899 --> 00:32:51.899
that ye saw her not, even as others which have no hope.

00:32:51.899 --> 00:32:57.899
For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.

00:32:57.899 --> 00:33:01.899
Do we believe that? That word if carries with it the idea of since.

00:33:01.899 --> 00:33:05.899
It can be used that way. Since we believe this and we believe this.

00:33:05.899 --> 00:33:09.899
Listen, if you don't believe that Jesus died according to the Scriptures

00:33:09.899 --> 00:33:13.899
and rose again according to the Scriptures, then you're not saved.

00:33:13.899 --> 00:33:17.899
Amen? You can't be saved if you don't believe that.

00:33:17.899 --> 00:33:21.899
You can believe it and not be saved because you must understand that he did it for you

00:33:21.899 --> 00:33:25.899
and you must accept what he did for you personally. Amen?

00:33:25.899 --> 00:33:29.899
And we believe this and notice what Paul says.

00:33:29.899 --> 00:33:33.899
For this we say unto you, notice verse 15, by the word of the Lord.

00:33:33.899 --> 00:33:39.899
This is not Paul's opinion. This is not that they had some kind of a church leadership meeting

00:33:39.899 --> 00:33:43.899
and they came up with here's how we're going to answer the question.

00:33:43.899 --> 00:33:47.899
No, it says that this is what we say unto you by the word of the Lord,

00:33:47.899 --> 00:33:53.899
that we which are alive and remain, notice what he says, unto the coming of the Lord.

00:33:53.899 --> 00:33:59.899
Paul believed that Jesus was coming again. Amen? He believed it. Why? Because Jesus said it.

00:33:59.899 --> 00:34:05.899
Paul didn't hear the voice when Jesus was speaking to the disciples in John 14,

00:34:05.899 --> 00:34:11.899
but he understood the truth. Remember, Paul had the opportunity to be taught by Jesus Christ.

00:34:11.899 --> 00:34:17.899
He said, this that I'm teaching, you read the book of Galatians, he said, I receive this with the revelation of Jesus Christ.

00:34:17.899 --> 00:34:23.899
Amen? And he says here, by the word of the Lord,

00:34:23.899 --> 00:34:27.899
that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.

00:34:27.899 --> 00:34:31.899
You know what the word prevent means? It means to go before them.

00:34:31.899 --> 00:34:37.899
So what God is telling us is there's an order to this. By the way, that's consistent with Scripture. Why?

00:34:37.899 --> 00:34:41.899
Our God does all things decently and in order. Amen?

00:34:41.899 --> 00:34:45.899
So there's an order. He says that we shall not prevent them which are asleep.

00:34:45.899 --> 00:34:49.899
What does it mean to be asleep? Those that are dead in Christ.

00:34:49.899 --> 00:34:53.899
So we come to verse 16, for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven.

00:34:53.899 --> 00:34:57.899
This is consistent. What do the angels say at the ascension? Why stand you gazing up into heaven?

00:34:57.899 --> 00:35:03.899
This same Jesus, right? Is that what they say in Acts chapter 1?

00:35:03.899 --> 00:35:07.899
And so we find that the Bible says the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout,

00:35:07.899 --> 00:35:11.899
with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of God,

00:35:11.899 --> 00:35:15.899
and the dead in Christ shall rise first.

00:35:15.899 --> 00:35:22.899
Then, again, the order, then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds

00:35:22.899 --> 00:35:25.899
to meet the Lord in the air, and so shall we ever be with the Lord.

00:35:25.899 --> 00:35:28.899
Wherefore, comfort one another with these words.

00:35:28.899 --> 00:35:32.899
If you look in verse 17, right in the beginning of that verse, it says,

00:35:32.899 --> 00:35:36.899
then we which are alive and remain, notice this, shall be caught up.

00:35:36.899 --> 00:35:39.899
That's rapture.

00:35:39.899 --> 00:35:43.899
The Greek word there is where we get our English word rapture.

00:35:43.899 --> 00:35:49.899
So shall be caught up together with them. Notice what it says, in the clouds to meet the Lord where?

00:35:49.899 --> 00:35:52.899
In the air.

00:35:52.899 --> 00:35:55.899
In the air. That's different than on the earth.

00:35:55.899 --> 00:35:57.899
Do you agree?

00:35:57.899 --> 00:36:04.899
Jesus is coming back at the end of the tribulation with his saints,

00:36:04.899 --> 00:36:08.899
and he's going to put his foot on the Mount of Olives, right?

00:36:08.899 --> 00:36:11.899
Zechariah? Amen?

00:36:11.899 --> 00:36:13.899
You tracking this evening?

00:36:13.899 --> 00:36:18.899
And he's going to come all the way to earth. There's going to be a battle of Armageddon, right?

00:36:18.899 --> 00:36:20.899
That's what's going to happen.

00:36:20.899 --> 00:36:24.899
So here, we're meeting him in the air.

00:36:24.899 --> 00:36:28.899
So the rapture is when Christ comes back for his saints.

00:36:28.899 --> 00:36:32.899
The revelation of Jesus Christ, or the return of Jesus Christ,

00:36:32.899 --> 00:36:37.899
is when he's coming back with his saints to the earth.

00:36:37.899 --> 00:36:39.899
You read Revelation 19, it's fascinating.

00:36:39.899 --> 00:36:43.899
I don't like horse riding, but I'm going to ride a horse, amen?

00:36:43.899 --> 00:36:47.899
I got on a horse one time in Tennessee, and I said, that's enough.

00:36:47.899 --> 00:36:50.899
And look, we're coming back with him.

00:36:50.899 --> 00:36:53.899
He's coming for us.

00:36:53.899 --> 00:36:55.899
We're going to meet him in the air.

00:36:55.899 --> 00:36:57.899
1 Thessalonians 4.

00:36:57.899 --> 00:37:01.899
Did you notice that the Bible says, with the trump of God?

00:37:01.899 --> 00:37:03.899
What did John hear?

00:37:03.899 --> 00:37:08.899
He said, after this, setting the separation,

00:37:08.899 --> 00:37:10.899
after this, the church age,

00:37:10.899 --> 00:37:14.899
I looked and I saw a door open in heaven, and I heard a voice, as it were,

00:37:14.899 --> 00:37:17.899
a trumpet that said what?

00:37:17.899 --> 00:37:19.899
Come up hither.

00:37:19.899 --> 00:37:23.899
And immediately, he was in the Spirit.

00:37:23.899 --> 00:37:25.899
He's in the throne room of heaven.

00:37:25.899 --> 00:37:28.899
He sees the Lord on the throne, by the way.

00:37:28.899 --> 00:37:31.899
Right away. It's pretty awesome.

00:37:31.899 --> 00:37:37.899
So we find that here, the Bible says, wherefore, comfort one another with these words.

00:37:37.899 --> 00:37:40.899
Listen, we can look at 1 Thessalonians 4,

00:37:40.899 --> 00:37:43.899
and we can understand what God is teaching us,

00:37:43.899 --> 00:37:45.899
and understanding the teaching of the rapture,

00:37:45.899 --> 00:37:49.899
understanding this evening the order of the rapture, if you will,

00:37:49.899 --> 00:37:55.899
but we understand it's going to happen about that quick.

00:37:55.899 --> 00:37:56.899
How do we know that?

00:37:56.899 --> 00:37:59.899
Well, turn over to 1 Corinthians chapter 15.

00:37:59.899 --> 00:38:03.899
In 1 Corinthians 15, we see another reference here that helps us in understanding this,

00:38:03.899 --> 00:38:11.899
which is revealed to us in Revelation chapter 4.

00:38:11.899 --> 00:38:18.899
1 Corinthians chapter 15, often a chapter that's referred to as the resurrection chapter, rightly so.

00:38:18.899 --> 00:38:21.899
We find here at the end, beginning in verse 51, it says,

00:38:21.899 --> 00:38:23.899
Behold, I show you a mystery.

00:38:23.899 --> 00:38:27.899
We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed.

00:38:27.899 --> 00:38:28.899
What does he mean by that?

00:38:28.899 --> 00:38:31.899
We're not going to all die, but we're all going to be changed.

00:38:31.899 --> 00:38:33.899
Right?

00:38:33.899 --> 00:38:35.899
Remember, the dead in Christ shall rise first.

00:38:35.899 --> 00:38:38.899
Those which are asleep in Jesus, they're going to rise first.

00:38:38.899 --> 00:38:40.899
Then we which are alive and remain.

00:38:40.899 --> 00:38:41.899
But we're all going to be changed.

00:38:41.899 --> 00:38:43.899
Notice what he says in verse number 52.

00:38:43.899 --> 00:38:47.899
In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the, what does it say?

00:38:47.899 --> 00:38:54.899
The last trump, for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible,

00:38:54.899 --> 00:38:58.899
and we shall be changed.

00:38:58.899 --> 00:39:00.899
He goes on to explain this.

00:39:00.899 --> 00:39:09.899
For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.

00:39:09.899 --> 00:39:12.899
Aren't you thankful for that Bible teaching?

00:39:12.899 --> 00:39:15.899
And we find that the Bible says, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye.

00:39:15.899 --> 00:39:19.899
It's faster than I can snap my fingers.

00:39:19.899 --> 00:39:21.899
It's truly faster than you can blink your eye.

00:39:21.899 --> 00:39:23.899
It's faster than that.

00:39:23.899 --> 00:39:25.899
It's going to happen.

00:39:25.899 --> 00:39:28.899
And so we begin to look here at Revelation chapter 4,

00:39:28.899 --> 00:39:32.899
and I spend the entirety of our evening tonight looking at just these phrases

00:39:32.899 --> 00:39:35.899
that God gives us so that we can have an understanding

00:39:35.899 --> 00:39:38.899
as we go forward in our study of the book of Revelation

00:39:38.899 --> 00:39:43.899
that we see that God is helping us to be able to establish a timeline

00:39:43.899 --> 00:39:47.899
to understand after this, what is this?

00:39:47.899 --> 00:39:48.899
After what?

00:39:48.899 --> 00:39:49.899
What is he referring to?

00:39:49.899 --> 00:39:50.899
What is he giving to us?

00:39:50.899 --> 00:39:54.899
Well, it's the preceding chapters, 2 and 3, of the church age,

00:39:54.899 --> 00:39:58.899
that second division of the book of Revelation.

00:39:58.899 --> 00:40:00.899
The first one are the things which you see.

00:40:00.899 --> 00:40:08.179
You see, the vision that John had in Revelation 1, followed by the things which are, chapters

00:40:08.179 --> 00:40:09.739
2 and 3.

00:40:09.739 --> 00:40:12.899
We're still in the church age.

00:40:12.899 --> 00:40:15.339
I believe we're in the last days.

00:40:15.339 --> 00:40:19.779
The Bible teaches us, we can read throughout the scriptures with regard to what the last

00:40:19.779 --> 00:40:26.899
days, what characterizes the last days, but we understand that we're to stay faithful.

00:40:26.899 --> 00:40:28.739
Amen?

00:40:28.739 --> 00:40:34.659
There's a need to stay faithful, to stay faithful to preaching the word.

00:40:34.659 --> 00:40:39.779
He tells us in 2 Timothy 4, he told us in 2 Timothy 3, the characteristics of the last

00:40:39.779 --> 00:40:43.659
days, the perilous times and all that's going to happen, but he says, continue there in

00:40:43.659 --> 00:40:44.659
chapter 3.

00:40:44.659 --> 00:40:47.499
And then he tells us in chapter 4 that we're to preach the word.

00:40:47.499 --> 00:40:48.499
Why?

00:40:48.499 --> 00:40:51.379
Listen, there's going to come a time when they will not endure sound doctrine.

00:40:51.379 --> 00:40:56.859
I believe that we very much live in a time in which people do not endure sound doctrine.

00:40:56.859 --> 00:40:59.459
And they want somebody to tickle their ears.

00:40:59.459 --> 00:41:02.859
And that's exactly what 2 Timothy chapter 4 says.

00:41:02.859 --> 00:41:03.859
And I think we're there.

00:41:03.859 --> 00:41:08.419
I was looking at a Baptist church website this afternoon.

00:41:08.419 --> 00:41:12.299
Not our Baptist church website, praise the Lord.

00:41:12.299 --> 00:41:17.579
But it was talking about all this stuff of inclusion and God loves you however you are,

00:41:17.579 --> 00:41:22.099
whatever you are, and we love you too, no exceptions and all this kind of stuff.

00:41:22.099 --> 00:41:31.979
Listen, I'm thankful that God loves the world, but God wants to save the sinner, amen.

00:41:31.979 --> 00:41:36.299
The power of the gospel is to transform a life.

00:41:36.299 --> 00:41:40.939
And we're living in the church age, but we're getting to that place as we look at the characteristics

00:41:40.939 --> 00:41:44.939
in 2 Timothy 3 where we're in the last days.

00:41:44.939 --> 00:41:47.259
And it's important for us to understand and see this.

00:41:47.259 --> 00:41:53.099
And so God tells us in Revelation 4, after this, I'm going to show you things which must

00:41:53.099 --> 00:41:54.099
be hereafter.

00:41:54.099 --> 00:41:57.139
We're going to see what's going to happen in the tribulation.

00:41:57.139 --> 00:41:59.599
We're going to see what's going to happen with the battle of Armageddon.

00:41:59.599 --> 00:42:02.139
We're going to see what's going to happen in the millennial reign of Christ.

00:42:02.139 --> 00:42:07.219
We're going to have a little bit of a glimpse into the period of eternity as it's given

00:42:07.219 --> 00:42:09.739
to us in chapters 21 and 22.

00:42:09.739 --> 00:42:14.179
The millennium, as you look at the millennial reign of Christ, there's very limited information

00:42:14.179 --> 00:42:18.019
that's given to us in the book of Revelation and a whole host of information that's given

00:42:18.019 --> 00:42:22.499
to us in the prophets when you study the millennium.

00:42:22.499 --> 00:42:23.819
So how long are we going to be in this study?

00:42:23.819 --> 00:42:26.739
I have no idea.

00:42:26.739 --> 00:42:29.419
Even so, come Lord Jesus, amen.

00:42:29.419 --> 00:42:34.979
But the reality is that we find that God gives us this timeline and in between the after

00:42:34.979 --> 00:42:40.859
this and I'm going to show you things which must be hereafter, come up hither.

00:42:40.859 --> 00:42:42.459
He hears the voice.

00:42:42.459 --> 00:42:49.899
As it were, the Bible says a trumpet talking with me and immediately I was in the spirit.

00:42:49.899 --> 00:42:57.139
Next week we're going to focus more on dealing with this, why is there a rapture?

00:42:57.139 --> 00:42:59.179
Why is there a tribulation?

00:42:59.179 --> 00:43:01.659
What is the purpose for the tribulation?

00:43:01.659 --> 00:43:06.899
Can I tell you this evening, if you cannot answer the question why there's going to be

00:43:06.899 --> 00:43:10.819
a tribulation, if you do not know, and I'm not saying that it's a problem if you don't

00:43:11.379 --> 00:43:16.339
know, but what I'm saying is that if you don't know the purpose of the tribulation, how are

00:43:16.339 --> 00:43:20.779
you going to even begin to try to explain why there's going to be a rapture?

00:43:20.779 --> 00:43:23.419
Or when the rapture is going to occur?

00:43:23.419 --> 00:43:29.099
And so it's absolutely imperative for us as Bible students to understand proper hermeneutics

00:43:29.099 --> 00:43:33.659
to interpret the scriptures to be able to look, what is God doing?

00:43:33.659 --> 00:43:39.779
God has a plan and God's plan will come to pass.

00:43:39.779 --> 00:43:42.459
I'll give you another preview for next week.

00:43:42.459 --> 00:43:45.459
God's not done with Israel.

00:43:45.459 --> 00:43:49.339
He's dealing with the church right now.

00:43:49.339 --> 00:43:51.859
Jewish people can be part of the church.

00:43:51.859 --> 00:43:55.139
Paul was Jewish, right?

00:43:55.139 --> 00:43:59.779
In fact, a lot of them were Jewish, okay?

00:43:59.779 --> 00:44:03.579
But he's not done with Israel.

00:44:03.579 --> 00:44:06.019
And what's going to happen in the tribulation?

00:44:06.019 --> 00:44:09.699
All of a sudden Israel is front and center.

00:44:09.699 --> 00:44:10.699
That's what God's doing.

00:44:10.699 --> 00:44:14.899
We're going to look at that next week as we attempt to answer the question, when?

00:44:14.899 --> 00:44:19.019
Not that I'm going to give you a date of when, because that would be extremely foolish, because

00:44:19.019 --> 00:44:21.219
no man knows the hour.

00:44:21.219 --> 00:44:25.699
But it's important that we understand that even as we look at these things, that we are

00:44:25.699 --> 00:44:32.099
in that period of time of Revelation 2 and 3.

00:44:32.099 --> 00:44:34.059
It's not after this yet.

00:44:34.059 --> 00:44:39.419
And when the disciples asked Jesus in Acts 1, is it now the time that you're going to

00:44:40.139 --> 00:44:41.139
restore the kingdom to Israel?

00:44:41.139 --> 00:44:42.139
He said, it's not for you to know.

00:44:42.139 --> 00:44:43.139
The times are the seasons, right?

00:44:43.139 --> 00:44:44.139
This is what he says.

00:44:44.139 --> 00:44:45.139
I'm just paraphrasing.

00:44:45.139 --> 00:44:50.379
He says, but you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you.

00:44:50.379 --> 00:44:53.459
And you shall be witnesses unto me, both in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, the uttermost part

00:44:53.459 --> 00:44:54.459
of the earth.

00:44:54.459 --> 00:44:57.459
We have a responsibility today.

00:44:57.459 --> 00:44:59.979
It's important for us to know what's coming.

00:44:59.979 --> 00:45:06.579
We have a responsibility today, a responsibility today to live for Jesus, to honor and glorify

00:45:06.579 --> 00:45:12.099
Him, to exalt and magnify His name to a lost and dying world, that they may see our good

00:45:12.099 --> 00:45:17.579
works and glorify our Father which is in heaven, that they might know that God loves them,

00:45:17.579 --> 00:45:20.259
that Jesus died for them so they could go to heaven.

00:45:20.259 --> 00:45:21.259
Let's pray.

00:45:21.259 --> 00:45:22.259
Father, we love You.

00:45:22.259 --> 00:45:23.499
We thank You for loving us.

00:45:23.499 --> 00:45:25.799
Thank You for Your Word tonight.

00:45:25.799 --> 00:45:31.659
I pray that we've been able to adequately understand the timeline and divisions that

00:45:31.659 --> 00:45:39.019
You've set forth here in the book of Revelation to help us understand these things which must

00:45:39.019 --> 00:45:40.019
be.

00:45:40.019 --> 00:45:46.539
I pray, God, that You'd help us to remain faithful in this era of church history.

00:45:46.539 --> 00:45:53.379
We believe we're nearing the end of the church age, but Lord, we do not know the hour, nor

00:45:53.379 --> 00:45:57.859
do we seek to set a timeline.

00:45:57.859 --> 00:46:01.619
I pray that You'd help us to be found faithful.

00:46:01.619 --> 00:46:03.579
God, that we'd live for You and honor You.

00:46:03.579 --> 00:46:13.019
Help us to have that hope that Paul refers to as he's writing to Titus, the blessed hope.

00:46:13.019 --> 00:46:14.259
What is the blessed hope?

00:46:14.259 --> 00:46:22.939
It's that confident expectation that we're going to see You, we're going to meet You

00:46:22.939 --> 00:46:26.299
in the air, and we'll ever be with You.

00:46:26.299 --> 00:46:28.599
Lord, we thank You for that.

00:46:28.599 --> 00:46:32.399
I pray that You'd bless over these next several weeks as we continue studying and setting

00:46:32.399 --> 00:46:37.719
forth the proper understanding of these things that You've provided to us.

00:46:37.719 --> 00:46:38.899
Give us wisdom, Lord.

00:46:38.899 --> 00:46:41.919
Give us understanding, and we'll thank You for it.

00:46:41.919 --> 00:46:42.919
In Christ's name we pray.

00:46:42.919 --> 00:46:43.919
Would You stand with me?

00:46:43.919 --> 00:46:44.919
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

00:46:44.919 --> 00:46:45.919
Maybe we'll just stand with you.

00:46:45.919 --> 00:46:46.919
We thank You, Lord.

00:46:46.919 --> 00:46:47.919
We thank You, Lord.

00:46:47.919 --> 00:46:48.919
We thank You, Lord.

00:46:48.919 --> 00:46:48.919
