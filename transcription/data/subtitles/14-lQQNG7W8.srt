1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
29 down through chapter 50 in verse number 14. And so we'll kind of bridge

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:09,800
both chapters this evening and look there if you will, Genesis

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:16,799
49 verse 29. This is the 101st message

4
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,840
in the book of Genesis and I thought we'd hit

5
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:27,120
a hundred and I wasn't able to quite get it all done in a hundred messages

6
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,280
so we're gonna be at like a hundred and three or four something like that

7
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:35,040
but praise the Lord I have thoroughly enjoyed the study I hope that you have

8
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:35,880
as well

9
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,000
and I've been praying about where to go next I think I think the Lord confirmed

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,360
it

11
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:44,240
but I'm not a hundred percent sure and so I'm gonna wait one more week to

12
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,080
announce it

13
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:49,200
but I'm pretty confident where God is leading me for our next study

14
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,479
and I'm excited about it. Genesis chapter 49 verse 29 and he

15
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:56,759
this is Jacob speaking, remember he blessed all the sons brought them in

16
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:57,799
before him we've had

17
00:00:57,799 --> 00:01:01,119
three weeks of lessons covering the first 28 verses

18
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:05,040
of Genesis 49. Each son stood before Jacob

19
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,839
and we find that he's speaking it says he charged them

20
00:01:08,839 --> 00:01:13,319
and said unto them I am to be gathered

21
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:18,639
unto my people. Bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of

22
00:01:18,639 --> 00:01:23,440
Ephron the Hittite. The cave that is in the field of Machpelah which

23
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:28,040
is before Mamre in the land of Canaan which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron

24
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:28,800
the Hittite

25
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:33,639
for possession of a burying place. There they buried Abraham and Sarah's wife

26
00:01:33,639 --> 00:01:34,319
there

27
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:38,080
they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife and there I buried

28
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:42,199
Leah. The purchase of the field and of the cave that is

29
00:01:42,199 --> 00:01:45,680
therein was from the children of Heth.

30
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,959
When Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons

31
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:53,400
he gathered up his feet into the bed and yielded

32
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:58,120
up the ghost and was gathered unto his people.

33
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:02,180
We'll read into chapter 50 as we get to the message this evening I've titled the

34
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,400
message Jacob's final request

35
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:08,559
and as we look at this passage of scripture we're reminded even as we've

36
00:02:08,559 --> 00:02:10,320
mentioned for a number of weeks now

37
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,279
with regard to the death of Jacob being recorded in this chapter

38
00:02:14,279 --> 00:02:17,759
the Bible tells us as it appointed unto man once to die

39
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:22,679
but after this the judgment. In fact I just had someone tell me recently

40
00:02:22,679 --> 00:02:25,839
when I asked them if they were sure that if they were to die that heaven is their

41
00:02:25,839 --> 00:02:26,479
home

42
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:30,279
they said no. I mean they were confident that the answer was no

43
00:02:30,279 --> 00:02:34,199
and I thought that was an open door of opportunity to be able to share the

44
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:35,559
gospel and let them know

45
00:02:35,559 --> 00:02:38,960
how they could be for sure and yet they were

46
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:44,759
rather they would desire to listen to various world views and ideologies with

47
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:46,440
regard to what happens

48
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,320
after death. I'm thankful that God has given us the authoritative word

49
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:55,240
and he has revealed to us in his word what happens after death.

50
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,639
As we look at the account that is given to us of Jacob's death

51
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:03,440
let me say this tonight not everyone is going to experience the same kind of

52
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,160
death.

53
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,160
What do I mean by that? Well it's not always possible that you're going to

54
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,160
know that you're going to die and have opportunity to bring your family members

55
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,080
into your presence and to speak to them and to

56
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:19,440
share with them what's on your heart and then after you're done speaking get in

57
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,399
bed and die.

58
00:03:20,399 --> 00:03:24,080
It'd be pretty nice if it happened that way

59
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,279
wouldn't it? But the reality is it doesn't happen that many for many.

60
00:03:28,279 --> 00:03:32,119
It just doesn't happen that way for many people.

61
00:03:32,119 --> 00:03:35,559
And we do understand that as we look at this passage of scripture I really just

62
00:03:35,559 --> 00:03:36,759
have two thoughts

63
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:40,639
with regard to points if you will with regard to the message this evening

64
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,479
but then I want to give you a number of practical tips that I hope would be

65
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:44,679
helpful this evening

66
00:03:44,679 --> 00:03:47,720
as we look at a passage of scripture like this things that are

67
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:53,160
just practical applicable truths that we can deal with tonight but as we look at

68
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,440
the scripture let me give you one

69
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:58,039
two thoughts tonight number one the request

70
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:01,479
given. We read these verses in verse 29 through 33

71
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:04,600
and we see that Jacob gives a request to his children

72
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,320
the boys are gathered we mentioned already the purpose in the process and

73
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,559
the prophetic view even as Jacob shares things

74
00:04:11,559 --> 00:04:15,600
that stretch all the way from the time of Jacob into the millennial reign of

75
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,320
Christ

76
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,880
those events have not even taken place yet but Jacob

77
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:24,480
in Genesis chapter 49 with this prophetic view he speaks words that are

78
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,200
yet to be fulfilled

79
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,239
but we have confidence in knowing that they will be fulfilled

80
00:04:30,239 --> 00:04:34,559
our Lord is going to return and after seven years of tribulation on this

81
00:04:34,559 --> 00:04:38,040
earth he is going to establish his millennial kingdom

82
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,959
he is going to rule and reign for a thousand years

83
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:45,720
amen this is this is true Bible

84
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,839
teaching and we find that Jacob's

85
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:52,799
message really covers a large span

86
00:04:52,799 --> 00:04:57,640
of human history all the way into the millennial reign of Christ but after

87
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,040
this

88
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:03,279
process is completed and after each of the the boys stand before dad and

89
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:06,359
and after he gives them the the blessing it says

90
00:05:06,359 --> 00:05:09,399
and he charged them you notice that in verse number 29

91
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:13,600
and I believe that as he begins to to give this charge it's the request that's

92
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,760
given it's Jacob's

93
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,880
final request and as he would have his sons gathered together

94
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,839
and he gives them this request he says that he charged them

95
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:27,359
and notice specifically what Jacob makes request of

96
00:05:27,359 --> 00:05:33,200
he tells them I'm gonna die how's he worded he says well I am to be gathered

97
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:38,279
unto my people and notice he says bury me

98
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:42,079
with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of

99
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:47,000
Ephron the Hittite Jacob at this particular time

100
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,320
is where well he's in Egypt remember

101
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,480
God has moved in such a way that he allowed Joseph

102
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,920
to go through some circumstances that were less than desirable

103
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,239
and after going through all of those circumstances and sold into slavery and

104
00:06:01,239 --> 00:06:02,279
all that takes place

105
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:07,160
we find that Jacob eventually receives word that Joseph is alive

106
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,640
and he calls for his father and his brethren his family

107
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,799
to come to Egypt and it was there in Egypt that

108
00:06:13,799 --> 00:06:18,799
that God would use Joseph to sustain his children his people

109
00:06:18,799 --> 00:06:22,600
we find that it was there that God would give them a possession

110
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:27,119
and he would give them the the the provision that they would need and we

111
00:06:27,119 --> 00:06:27,760
find

112
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,559
that before they went on their journey

113
00:06:30,559 --> 00:06:33,920
that God in Genesis chapter 46 spoke

114
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:38,359
to Jacob and he tells Jacob fear not to go down

115
00:06:38,359 --> 00:06:43,920
there why to go down into Egypt for I will there make of thee a great nation

116
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,359
he says in verse number four I will go down with thee into Egypt

117
00:06:47,359 --> 00:06:50,519
notice and I will also surely bring thee

118
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:53,679
up again and Joseph shall put his hand

119
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:55,119
upon thine eyes

120
00:06:55,119 --> 00:06:58,519
and we find that Jacob received that promise he's been there now

121
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:01,799
as we study the scripture we put the timeline together he's been there for

122
00:07:01,799 --> 00:07:03,000
seventeen years

123
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,200
and after seventeen years of being in Egypt his

124
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,279
death is now at hand the time of his departure

125
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:13,559
as Paul would say in 2nd Timothy chapter 4 is

126
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:17,920
at hand and he makes this single request

127
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:23,640
don't bury me in Egypt don't bury me in Egypt

128
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:28,000
he says bury me with my father's in the cave that is the field of

129
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,519
Ephron the Hittite I won't read all the verses again because

130
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:35,640
I've already read them for sake of time but I want you to notice

131
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,799
that in this request that Jacob is very specific

132
00:07:38,799 --> 00:07:42,399
he makes sure that he specifically indicates

133
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:46,600
the particular place where he is to be buried he doesn't just say don't bury me

134
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,720
here he says bury me in this place

135
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,720
he then goes through the events that led to this particular cave

136
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,959
being purchased in this land being purchased

137
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:01,119
and the right of ownership that's where I want to be buried

138
00:08:01,119 --> 00:08:04,679
he says that there are others that are buried there if you look in verse 31

139
00:08:04,679 --> 00:08:07,839
he mentions Abraham and Sarah he mentions Isaac and Rebekah

140
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:11,959
and he mentions Leah and he makes it extremely clear and

141
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:15,959
extremely specific with regard to the request

142
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:20,000
by the way we could make various application with regard to that

143
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,640
and we'll make some at the end of the message but I want you to understand

144
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:28,160
that Jacob in making this request he's being very clear

145
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,599
he's making it known this is my desire

146
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:38,799
this is my request I do not think that the boys after verse number 33

147
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:43,119
when Jacob puts his feet back up into the bed and yields up the ghost in

148
00:08:43,119 --> 00:08:47,359
other words he died he was gathered into his people I do not think that at

149
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,200
that moment

150
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,719
that the boys stand around and say well what should we do no it was very clear

151
00:08:52,719 --> 00:08:54,119
what had been communicated

152
00:08:54,119 --> 00:08:57,880
the request of Jacob his final request

153
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:01,599
was given as we enter into chapter 50

154
00:09:01,599 --> 00:09:04,799
I want you to notice number two with me the request is granted

155
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:08,039
I want you to notice that the Bible tells us in verse number 50

156
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:12,440
and excuse me in verse number one of chapter number 50 and Joseph

157
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,679
fell upon his father's face and wept upon him and kissed him

158
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:21,039
I want you to notice from verse number one as we look at this verse of

159
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:21,760
scripture

160
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,119
that the Bible regularly I dealt with this

161
00:09:25,119 --> 00:09:29,599
probably at this point a year and a half ago when Sarah died and we read of

162
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:33,200
Abraham and his mourning for the death of his wife Sarah

163
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,960
and we see in verse number one of chapter 50 we understand that we are

164
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,280
emotional people

165
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,799
God has made us that way and we understand

166
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:44,919
that at times of loss like as we look at here

167
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:49,000
and we talk about physical death and we're associated we understand

168
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,280
what it is to have a loved one pass on into eternity

169
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:57,159
the reality is that we do have emotions

170
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:59,960
we do mourn we do have

171
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:05,720
sorrow, but I'm thankful for the truth of 1 Thessalonians chapter number 4 that tells

172
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:11,800
us if we have loved ones that are saved, that are heaven-bound, that if they die, that we

173
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:17,280
sorrow not as others which have no hope.

174
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,440
Aren't you thankful that we have a whole Bible?

175
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,240
Aren't you thankful this evening that God gives us the truth with regard to eternity,

176
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,800
with regard to not only how to live this life, but what happens thereafter?

177
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:35,000
So thankful this evening to have the authority of God's Word, and listen, I understand this

178
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,080
evening that when you have a loved one that enters into eternity, that there's an emotional

179
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,920
aspect of that.

180
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:48,440
But oh, how we can hold and cling to the promises of God.

181
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:53,920
So often we use the terminology, I think actually I just used it a moment ago, that you lose

182
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,920
a loved one.

183
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:59,480
Listen, if your loved one is saved by the grace of God, they're not lost, they're in

184
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,480
heaven.

185
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,200
We know exactly where they are.

186
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,200
Amen.

187
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,320
They're with our Savior, hallelujah.

188
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:10,000
To be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord.

189
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,120
Isn't that a wonderful promise of God's Word?

190
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,100
And we find this evening that we sorrow not as others which have no hope.

191
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:21,520
At the end of that passage in 1 Thessalonians chapter number 4, the Bible says, wherefore

192
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:25,780
comfort one another with these words.

193
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,520
These words are comforting words.

194
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:33,840
These words are words that in our time, in our moment of sorrow and grief, that we can

195
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:40,080
have the comfort of God's Word and the comfort of the Holy Spirit.

196
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,520
We find that Joseph is weeping.

197
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:48,880
Again, an emotional individual, an emotional being in dealing with the departure of his

198
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,880
father.

199
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:55,920
Again, we have the whole of Scripture and we can rejoice and understand that one day

200
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,840
by the grace of God we'll be reunited.

201
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,960
What a wonderful truth that is.

202
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:04,880
I remember reading of D.L. Moody and it says that D.L. Moody gave this testimony that one

203
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:10,640
day you're going to read that D.L. Moody has died.

204
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,040
Now some preachers, I've heard some preachers say, I check the obituaries every day to find

205
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,320
out if I'm in there.

206
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,400
I don't understand that.

207
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:21,720
But the reality is that he said, you're going to read one day that D.L. Moody is dead.

208
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,380
He said, don't believe it.

209
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,040
Don't believe it for one second.

210
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,640
He said, because at that moment I'm going to be more alive than I've ever been.

211
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:33,280
And then you're going to go into this testimony of sharing the truth of knowing that to be

212
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:38,000
absent from this body is to be present with the Lord, that this mortal shall put on immortality,

213
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,920
that this corruption shall put on incorruption.

214
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,320
And what a joy and what a blessing.

215
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,360
We'll be more alive then than we've ever been.

216
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:52,080
Verse two says, and Joseph commanded his servants, the physicians, to embalm his father and the

217
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,360
physicians embalmed Israel.

218
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,360
That's Jacob.

219
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,200
Of course, his name had been changed to Israel.

220
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,120
Notice in verse number three, and 40 days were fulfilled for him.

221
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,800
For so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed and the Egyptians mourned for

222
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,960
him three score and 10 days.

223
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:13,360
When the days of his mourning were passed, Joseph spake in the house of Pharaoh saying,

224
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,920
if now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you in the ears of Pharaoh saying,

225
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:23,440
my father made me swear, saying, lo, I die in my grave, which I have digged for me in

226
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,220
the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me.

227
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,920
That's what he understood his father.

228
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:32,960
That's the summary statement of what he understood that final request to be.

229
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:38,620
And it says now, therefore, verse number five, let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father

230
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:41,980
and I will come again.

231
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:45,940
Notice Joseph understood exactly what the request was.

232
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:50,780
And Joseph gives his petition before Pharaoh, and we find that Pharaoh responds and says

233
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:57,340
in verse six, go up and bury thy father according as he made thee swear.

234
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:02,180
And Joseph went up to bury his father, and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh,

235
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:06,580
the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt, and all the house of

236
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:11,180
Joseph and his brethren in his father's house, only their little ones and their flocks and

237
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:15,380
their herds they left in the land of Goshen.

238
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:21,500
There went up with him both chariots and horsemen, and it was a very great company.

239
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:28,820
They came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan, and there they mourned,

240
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:34,460
notice with a great and very sore lamentation, and he made a mourning for his father seven

241
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,460
days.

242
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:39,740
And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor

243
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:45,060
of Atad, they said, this is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians, wherefore the name of it

244
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:49,140
is called Abel Mizraim, which is beyond Jordan.

245
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:58,380
And his sons, notice verse number 12, did unto him according as he commanded them.

246
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:04,060
The request was granted, we read where they travel, they make the journey.

247
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:10,620
God details for us those that went and the great group of people that went to go for

248
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:16,020
this funeral procession, if you will, this burying of Jacob, and we find that even the

249
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:21,580
inhabitants of the land, they saw the great host of company, they made their assumptions

250
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:27,180
based on what they observed, and we find that the Bible tells us in verse 13, for his sons

251
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:33,100
carried him into the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah,

252
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:38,740
which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a burying place of Ephraim the

253
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:41,700
Hittite before Mamre.

254
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:48,140
Is that not the exact place that had been given at the end of chapter 49 by Jacob in

255
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:53,020
his request with regard to where he would be buried?

256
00:15:53,020 --> 00:16:00,580
We find that the request is granted and Jacob is buried in this cave, in this burying place

257
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:05,380
that is mentioned in chapter 49 and again in chapter number 50, and I want you to notice

258
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:11,860
in verse number 14, the Bible says, and Joseph returned into Egypt.

259
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:17,940
Remember he told Pharaoh that I will, I pray thee to let me go up, I pray thee and bury

260
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:22,340
my father and I will come again in verse number 5, and the Bible says that Joseph returned

261
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:27,540
into Egypt, he and his brethren and all that went up with him to bury his father after

262
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:31,900
he had buried his father.

263
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:36,300
As we look at this passage of Scripture this evening and we understand the request that

264
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:43,100
was given, we understand the request was granted, and we understand those things that are captured

265
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:47,760
here with regard to mourning and weeping, and we understand that we sorrow not as others

266
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:52,180
which have no hope, and we can make those applications, I think it's important to understand

267
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:57,340
in verse 14 that the Bible says that Joseph, not only Joseph, but all of his brethren,

268
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,220
they returned back to Egypt.

269
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:04,540
Listen, I've heard people make the statement when they're at a funeral, I just can't go

270
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,540
on.

271
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:10,300
No, no, you have to continue going on, amen?

272
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:14,540
There's some people that think life's not worth living, I'm just, no, no, no, God still

273
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:20,460
has a purpose for you, God still has a plan for you, and we understand that life, there's

274
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:27,260
a time to be born, there's a time to die, and I know that there are times in which families

275
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:32,260
will have discussions and maybe some would think it's a dark conversation, one that they

276
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:36,640
don't want to have, but they'll make comments with regard to if I die first or if you die

277
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:42,160
first and that sort of thing, but the reality is that we don't always have what we would

278
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,660
wish with regard to our departure from this life.

279
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,380
I've already made that known in Genesis 49.

280
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:52,220
Not all of us are going to have the opportunity to bring our family into our presence and

281
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:56,540
then put our feet up into bed and then die.

282
00:17:56,540 --> 00:18:01,260
So as we look at this passage of Scripture and we understand that God has recorded for

283
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:08,280
us this request and this desire of Jacob and we see it fulfilled, I find this evening as

284
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:14,900
I consider this passage of Scripture that God has revealed to us in His Word that we're

285
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:18,460
all going to face death.

286
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:27,860
We find that Hezekiah is told that he's going to die, set thy house in order, wow.

287
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:32,300
You know, not everyone has that opportunity either to be told you're going to die, set

288
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,640
your house in order.

289
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:45,340
Sometimes death is, I mean, it's just a quote-unquote unexpected from human perspective, right?

290
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:49,980
So unless the rapture occurs, and I don't say unless the rapture occurs as if I don't

291
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:55,540
think it's going to occur, I know that the rapture is going to take place, but unless

292
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:59,940
in our lifetime it doesn't take place, then we're going to die.

293
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:04,940
I like what Brother Mershawn says, I'm looking for the upper taker and not the undertaker,

294
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,460
and certainly that is true.

295
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,100
I'm listening for the trumpet.

296
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:12,820
You see the things that are happening in our world today, man, it's getting close.

297
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:16,220
It's getting close, amen?

298
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:21,300
You look at world events, listen, unless you have your head in the sand, you have to acknowledge

299
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,860
we're getting close.

300
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:27,820
I got those alerts on my phone last night, just like you probably did, with regard to

301
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:31,660
all that was taking place internationally, listen, that's a big deal.

302
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:34,220
That's a really significant situation.

303
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:38,500
I've mentioned from this pulpit before, listen, before there can be a peace treaty, there's

304
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,140
got to be much turmoil.

305
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,360
And the anti-Christ is going to begin with a peace treaty.

306
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,360
We read that.

307
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,619
We understand that.

308
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:50,940
I don't know how much turmoil will take place before the rapture, before we hear the trumpet

309
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:55,460
of the Lord, but I believe we're getting close.

310
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,080
We ought to be ready.

311
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,940
I said to someone just recently, not only the…

312
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:04,100
return of Christ is imminent, but the reality is that there's just really a step between

313
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,440
me and death.

314
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:10,340
I shared actually the last two Saturdays that I've had the opportunity to go out on visitation,

315
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:14,580
I've shared with people about that bridge collapse.

316
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,580
You read about it.

317
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,580
You saw it.

318
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,580
Can you imagine?

319
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:23,820
There's no expectation of those folks driving over that bridge and thinking that, no, but

320
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:29,100
death, it can just happen.

321
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:34,300
And so for each one of us, unless we're raptured out of here, we're going to face death.

322
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:39,060
Each one of us, unless we're raptured out of here, we're going to deal with a loved

323
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,060
one dying.

324
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,060
Amen?

325
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:44,060
We're going to deal with it.

326
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:46,740
You say, I don't want to think about that.

327
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,740
It's life.

328
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:48,740
It's just the reality.

329
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,740
Amen?

330
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:55,220
I don't seem, I don't want to be unkind or cold about it, but the reality is that it's

331
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:58,500
something that we must acknowledge, we must consider.

332
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:03,020
The Bible says, as I quoted just a moment ago in Hebrews 9 and verse number 27, as it

333
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:11,300
is appointed unto man once to die, after this the judgment.

334
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:17,500
I don't know when I'm going to die, and you don't know when you're going to die either.

335
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,700
We just don't know.

336
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:25,220
But can I tell you this evening, when we understand a passage of Scripture like this, when we

337
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:30,260
take into consideration what God tells us in His Word and other portions of Scripture

338
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:32,900
with regard to death, let me say a couple of things.

339
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,980
Number one, you better be ready.

340
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:38,060
Be ready.

341
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,100
What does that entail?

342
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,260
What does it mean when I say be ready for death?

343
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:44,700
Well, number one, I would say this, you better be sure that you're saved.

344
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:52,220
Listen, we could take a trip this evening to any number of grave sites in our region,

345
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:58,620
and you could go to any number of tombstone and those grave markers, and you could look

346
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:03,700
at those, and you could take a journey, and you could find this evening that there are

347
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:10,180
people that are younger than you, and there are people that are older than you that are

348
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,699
buried in those places.

349
00:22:11,699 --> 00:22:17,059
See, death has no determination of your age.

350
00:22:17,059 --> 00:22:23,380
In fact, the reality is that there could be some very sick people that will live longer

351
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:27,460
than those of us that think we're relatively healthy.

352
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:33,020
I remember sitting with Mary Fenley's granddaughter before she died, and I remember sitting there,

353
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:38,180
and I don't believe her husband was saved.

354
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:40,500
The doctor had just given her a few days to live.

355
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:45,020
She had cancer and had been going for a while, and I looked at that man, and the reality

356
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:49,220
is there was only so much you could still say to the granddaughter that was nearing

357
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,220
death.

358
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:55,460
Her cognitive abilities were just deteriorating significantly, her ability to communicate,

359
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,619
so on and so forth.

360
00:22:56,619 --> 00:23:00,900
And I looked at that man, and I said to him, he had the same name as I, and I said, Chris,

361
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:08,020
listen, I understand that it seems as if your wife is going to die at any moment.

362
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,020
And it was reality.

363
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,020
It was a certain situation.

364
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:13,100
And I said, let me ask you, Chris.

365
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:19,100
And I said, because the reality is that either one of us could die before her.

366
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:23,260
No medical doctor has diagnosed me with any terminal illness.

367
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:29,139
No one's given me a time, but I could leave your house this afternoon, and on my way back

368
00:23:29,139 --> 00:23:34,619
to the church, I could get in a car accident and enter into heaven, enter into eternity.

369
00:23:34,619 --> 00:23:40,020
We don't know, and so we better make sure that we're saved.

370
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:44,380
Every young person, every old person, everyone in between, you say, am I young or old?

371
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,339
You figure that out, amen?

372
00:23:46,339 --> 00:23:53,220
But every single person that's understanding the truth of the gospel needs to make sure

373
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:56,460
that heaven is their home.

374
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:59,619
Can I say this when I say be ready?

375
00:23:59,619 --> 00:24:04,000
Not only that you know that you're saved, I mean, I hope that you know that you know

376
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,419
that you know that you know that heaven is your home.

377
00:24:07,419 --> 00:24:09,699
I mean, no doubts, no concerns.

378
00:24:09,699 --> 00:24:14,300
I mean, no one can talk you out of it, amen?

379
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,299
You know that you're saved by the grace of God.

380
00:24:16,299 --> 00:24:23,820
But let me say this, you've got to be ready, but I would say that you have no regrets.

381
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:28,140
What I mean by having no regrets is, hey, pastor, how could I ever have no regrets?

382
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:30,580
There's so many things in my life, and so on and so forth.

383
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:34,220
Listen, I've heard people say this, and this is where I'm trying to be very practical this

384
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,220
evening.

385
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:38,140
I've heard people say, I wish I would have.

386
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:40,059
Just do it.

387
00:24:40,059 --> 00:24:45,500
I wish I would have told them, pick up the phone and call them.

388
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,540
Why?

389
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:55,580
Because you don't want to stand at some funeral service and regret not telling them whatever's

390
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:58,299
on your heart.

391
00:24:58,299 --> 00:25:01,179
I'm just being transparent this evening.

392
00:25:01,179 --> 00:25:03,140
Have no regrets.

393
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:05,940
Because you don't know when that loved one is going to die, and you don't know when you're

394
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:08,420
going to die.

395
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:10,420
You have a loved one that you're praying for.

396
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:14,700
I have loved ones that I have prayed for, for salvation for years, that I've tried to

397
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:17,619
talk to them and they just no longer want to listen to me.

398
00:25:17,619 --> 00:25:22,420
And a number of years ago now, I sat down and I wrote handwritten letters.

399
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:26,500
I know that's old school, but I wanted them to know that it was from the heart.

400
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,899
I didn't just send a text or an email.

401
00:25:27,899 --> 00:25:34,059
I sat down and I wrote handwritten letters expressing to my relatives my desire for them

402
00:25:34,059 --> 00:25:38,380
to be saved, and sharing the gospel in written form.

403
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,540
Why?

404
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:41,899
Because they stopped listening to me.

405
00:25:41,899 --> 00:25:46,700
And I want them to know that I love them, but more than me loving them, God loves them.

406
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:49,580
And God wants them to be saved.

407
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,580
Amen?

408
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:55,140
1 Timothy chapter 2, that God's will that all men would be saved, and coming to the

409
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:59,339
knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord is not slack concerning His promises.

410
00:25:59,339 --> 00:26:03,660
Some men count slackness, but His longsuffering to us, we're not willing that any should

411
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:07,339
perish, but that all should come to repentance.

412
00:26:07,339 --> 00:26:13,260
I don't want to be in a situation where I find out that a loved one passed on into eternity,

413
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:20,160
and I said, man, I wish I would have told them about Jesus.

414
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:25,580
We hear that there are many that have other regrets with regard to, I never told them

415
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:28,140
X, Y, or Z, whatever it might be.

416
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:30,380
Listen, you know how you have no regrets?

417
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,380
You just deal with it now.

418
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:34,980
You say, but it's a hard conversation.

419
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:38,779
It'll be better to have a hard conversation than have no conversation.

420
00:26:38,779 --> 00:26:41,500
Amen?

421
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,980
You say, pastor, I don't like that.

422
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:46,220
I'm just being honest with you tonight.

423
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:52,880
You don't know how many times I've had the, I'll call it an unfortunate privilege to sit

424
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:59,019
with people that are mourning, and they're beating themselves up over what they wish

425
00:26:59,459 --> 00:27:04,380
they had done, and now it's too late.

426
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:07,260
What do you say to someone?

427
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:10,700
The only thing you can say to someone is on this side of eternity.

428
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,700
Amen?

429
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,720
And so this evening, I would say be ready.

430
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,179
Make sure of your salvation.

431
00:27:16,179 --> 00:27:18,000
I would say have no regrets.

432
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,899
Let me say this, very practical this evening, really probably my most practical thought

433
00:27:21,899 --> 00:27:25,660
from this passage of Scripture.

434
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:28,739
Make your desires known.

435
00:27:29,459 --> 00:27:32,420
What do I mean by that?

436
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:34,899
Jacob sat down with his boys.

437
00:27:34,899 --> 00:27:37,679
He called them in knowing that he would soon die.

438
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,940
He not only shared with them and gave them the blessings, and we read all of that, that

439
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:46,059
we've dealt with over the last three weeks, but at the end of that conversation, he makes

440
00:27:46,059 --> 00:27:48,739
his requests known.

441
00:27:48,739 --> 00:27:50,380
He makes his desire known.

442
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:52,179
He makes it abundantly clear.

443
00:27:52,179 --> 00:27:56,299
And so why do I say that this evening to make your desires known?

444
00:27:56,299 --> 00:28:01,899
Well, what do you, let me just be very practical this evening.

445
00:28:01,899 --> 00:28:12,739
As a pastor, I have the responsibility, I'm going to come down here, I have the responsibility,

446
00:28:12,739 --> 00:28:17,420
the privilege, and the honor of marrying people.

447
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:21,420
It's a blessed time.

448
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:28,540
I have the opportunity, the privilege, the responsibility of having baby dedications.

449
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:33,859
The privilege, responsibility, opportunity of seeing people saved and baptized and doing

450
00:28:33,859 --> 00:28:34,859
the baptism.

451
00:28:34,859 --> 00:28:38,000
And man, what a joy that is.

452
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:46,820
But I also have the privilege, the responsibility, and opportunity to conduct funerals.

453
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:53,580
Do you know how hard it is for a pastor to do a funeral when the deceased has not made

454
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,659
their desires known to their family?

455
00:28:55,659 --> 00:28:58,659
What do I mean by that?

456
00:28:58,659 --> 00:29:01,979
Well, not all of your family is saved.

457
00:29:01,979 --> 00:29:04,380
I'm being very practical this evening.

458
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:07,380
I'm trying to help all of us, okay?

459
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,900
Not all of your family is saved.

460
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:12,559
And you know who has the most say in your funeral?

461
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:19,440
Your family, not your pastor.

462
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,799
Your family, not your pastor.

463
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:26,080
So if you're saved by the grace of God and you know that you're heaven-bound and you

464
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:32,039
have family that's not, it'd be a good idea to let your family know what you desire for

465
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:35,720
your funeral service, your home-going service.

466
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,960
Why?

467
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:42,460
So that when your pastor wants to have that home-going service and that celebration of

468
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:47,140
life, and that family comes in and they say, here's what we want, and we want this, and

469
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:55,720
we want this, and we want this, and then it's all kinds of chaos.

470
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,900
It's the way it happens.

471
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:04,340
See, at my homegoing service, I want the gospel preached.

472
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:10,220
I want there to be some songs of rejoicing.

473
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:14,460
One of the best funeral services we've ever had is when Joe Harrow went home to be with

474
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,460
the Lord.

475
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:18,720
Man, it was just a celebration.

476
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,740
He was in heaven.

477
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:23,060
We were rejoicing.

478
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:28,140
There was no real conflict with the family with regard to what they wanted.

479
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,140
They knew.

480
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:33,380
I don't know that he sat down and specifically told them, here are the songs, but see, here's

481
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:37,500
what happens sometimes is somebody will come to me as the pastor and say, hey, at my funeral

482
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:41,620
I want these songs and I want this and that and so on and so forth, but they never let

483
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:45,220
their family know.

484
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:52,580
And then it gives me a difficulty because not all of your family is saved.

485
00:30:52,580 --> 00:31:00,700
David makes his requests known, very direct and very specific.

486
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:07,500
You have loved ones that most likely, friends, loved ones are going to come to your funeral

487
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,700
service.

488
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,140
You want them to hear the truth.

489
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,140
You know what's a sad thing?

490
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:19,700
I have been to funeral services and I'm sure you have as well where the gospel is not preached.

491
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:22,580
What an opportunity.

492
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:26,700
In fact, we find in the Bible that the Bible tells us that it's better to go to the house

493
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:34,180
of mourning than to the house of feasting for this is the end of all men.

494
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:39,520
I understand tonight that it's not the most popular subject to deal with, but what a tragic

495
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:51,480
situation when a loved one enters into glory, into heaven, and the gospel is not even preached.

496
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:56,560
Sometimes as the pastor I'm extremely limited on what I can say and do.

497
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:02,320
There's a family pressure, I'm being very transparent with you this evening, that can

498
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:06,160
become very difficult to deal with.

499
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:11,600
I won't mention the names, but we've had funerals here, that I've had funerals at other

500
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:16,840
places that I've gone and done funerals that are very difficult.

501
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:21,640
I had a pastor friend that was going to be having to travel to preach the funeral for

502
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:28,200
his brother, and he was already on the schedule to preach a funeral for an individual, and

503
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:34,000
so he contacted me and said, hey, can you help me out and can you preach this funeral?

504
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:40,200
I don't know the people, I don't know anything about them, talk about a difficult situation.

505
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:45,840
And then I get the email with all the information, and they're, I don't say this in a negative

506
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:50,960
way, but they're Polish, and all of these names I couldn't even begin to pronounce,

507
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:56,520
and I'm like, this is such a mess, I'm going to be in so much trouble.

508
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:01,400
And I had some conversation with the funeral home director, and they were giving me some

509
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,400
information.

510
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:06,380
So it's really best that I connect with the wife of the deceased so that we can figure

511
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:09,040
out some things.

512
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:14,440
She communicated to me through the funeral director, not to me personally, but she communicated

513
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:20,740
that we're not really religious people, and we're not really interested in the Bible,

514
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:25,520
and we really don't want any reference to heaven.

515
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:31,080
What am I supposed to do with that?

516
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,680
That's a tough situation.

517
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:42,600
And I wrote back, and I said, listen, it was through email, and I said, I'm a Baptist preacher.

518
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:47,880
I'm not trying to convert anyone to become a Baptist, but if I'm going to conduct a funeral

519
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:53,200
service, I am going to say something about Jesus, and I am going to say something about

520
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:57,920
heaven, and I am going to use the Bible.

521
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:02,520
If you don't want that, I suggest that you find someone else.

522
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:05,480
I'm not trying to be unkind.

523
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:08,600
I'm accountable to God.

524
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,520
Amen?

525
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:19,680
And how can I stand at a funeral service with a bunch of lost people, and tell them, your

526
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:27,120
loved one is doing just fine, and everyone's going to be okay, and no.

527
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,840
The Bible doesn't teach us that.

528
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,400
Do you read that in your Bible?

529
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,480
No.

530
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:38,400
When we die, there's either heaven or the lake of fire.

531
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,800
There's no in between.

532
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:46,960
There's no changing from one to the other.

533
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,600
Amen?

534
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:59,320
That individual wasn't a member of our church, but what I submit to you this evening, it

535
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:05,680
wasn't a member of that pastor's church either, just to be clear.

536
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:11,320
If you let your requests known to your loved ones, it goes a long way to having the kind

537
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:14,960
of funeral service that you'd like to have.

538
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:21,440
Because just letting your pastor know isn't enough.

539
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:30,040
Because your family is going to have more say in your funeral than your pastor is.

540
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,960
I've done it so many times.

541
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,520
I'm just being honest with you.

542
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:40,400
And so how can we be practical when we look at a passage of Scripture like this?

543
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,520
Number one, you better be ready for your departure.

544
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:49,320
Not all of us are going to have the blessing and the benefit that Jacob did of knowing

545
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:54,480
and being able to speak to and then putting his feet back up in the bed and dying.

546
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,080
So you better be sure of your salvation.

547
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:03,040
If there's any doubt whatsoever, get it settled.

548
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:07,080
Paul says to the believers in Corinth, he says, today is the day of salvation.

549
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:10,880
Proverbs tells us, boast not thyself of tomorrow.

550
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,120
Why?

551
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:15,160
No man knoweth what a day may bring forth.

552
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,720
James says, what is your life?

553
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:23,240
It's but a vapor that appeareth for a little time and then vanisheth away.

554
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:26,000
Don't delay.

555
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,960
Don't live in this state of doubt and I'm not really sure.

556
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,980
No, get it settled.

557
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:37,640
Have no regrets with your family, your loved ones.

558
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,760
Communicate to them what's on your heart.

559
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,600
Share the gospel with them.

560
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:45,120
If it has to be through letter form because they won't listen to you again, at least you

561
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:52,320
can rest assured that you shared with them the truth and you don't have to regret saying,

562
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,760
I wish I would have told them.

563
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:03,080
Because standing at a funeral, trying to console an individual that is beating themselves up

564
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:09,200
because I never told them is a difficult situation.

565
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,240
So have no regrets.

566
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,480
But then let your desires be known.

567
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,480
Communicate.

568
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,480
Here's what I want.

569
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,480
You want a certain song?

570
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,760
Man, have a certain song.

571
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,760
You want a certain verse?

572
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,920
Have a certain verse.

573
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:28,800
I ask people, I just, the most recent funeral I did was for my great aunt.

574
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:33,080
I didn't even have any idea that she wanted me to preach her funeral.

575
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:39,400
But she let her daughter know that when I die, I want, they call me Christopher because

576
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,120
my dad's Chris.

577
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,200
I want Christopher to do my funeral.

578
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:48,840
And when I got the phone call, I said, she wants me to do the funeral?

579
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:52,160
I mean, I'll do the funeral, that's great.

580
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,000
I began to ask questions.

581
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,160
There's really little information.

582
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,800
So I was able to just do whatever I wanted to do.

583
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,800
They didn't give any pushback.

584
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,000
So that was really nice.

585
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,360
But listen, if you have a life verse, if you have a certain song, if you want the gospel

586
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:10,480
preached, if you want your pastor to do the service, Mary Fenley died, she'd always made

587
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:15,280
it known that she wanted Brother Abbott to have part of her funeral service.

588
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,520
She thought she was going to die way before she did.

589
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:21,000
She didn't think I'd be her pastor very long.

590
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,040
She didn't know I'd be her pastor for almost nine years.

591
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,760
She thought she'd die well before then.

592
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,680
But I was their pastor for almost nine years.

593
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:35,280
But I knew she had made it known to me and to her family that she wanted her other pastor,

594
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,840
Pastor Abbott, to have part of that service.

595
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,960
That was a sweet service.

596
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,040
Brother Abbott took part of it.

597
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,040
I took part of it.

598
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,080
It was a blessing.

599
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,480
Some of you were here.

600
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:51,300
Let it be known because your family is going to have more say about your funeral than your

601
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,920
pastor will.

602
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:58,880
And if you want the gospel preached, even if they don't accept it, let it be known.

603
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:04,520
I want the gospel preached at my service, at my home going.

604
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,160
Amen?

605
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:10,640
Because I think each of us here this evening, if you're saved by the grace of God, you would

606
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:18,240
say tonight, when my time of departure comes, I want to have a home going service, a celebration

607
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,240
of life.

608
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:24,680
The fact that I'm in heaven with my Savior, I want the gospel preached, I want songs of

609
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,680
rejoicing.

610
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,920
Listen, I don't want it to be a sad time.

611
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:30,920
It's a time of rejoicing.

612
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,320
I understand that there's the sorrow part of it.

613
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:39,280
But the reality is that our loved one's not lost with our Savior if they're saved by the

614
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,000
grace of God.

615
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,160
Jacob, he gathers his sons together.

616
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,160
He blesses them.

617
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,200
He has time with them.

618
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:54,480
But then he specifically tells them what he desires.

619
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,960
And then they fulfill specifically.

620
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:04,880
me, the request that was given. They bury him in the place where he desired to be buried.

621
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:10,040
What a joy and what a blessing. One day, I don't know the day, I don't want to be dark

622
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:16,040
this evening. The reality is that death is just a doorway for the child of God. Death

623
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:25,760
is not something that we have to fear. I might not be excited about the process, amen? But

624
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:34,120
I'm going to be with Jesus for all of eternity. We'll see him and we'll worship him. We'll

625
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:40,080
praise his wonderful name this evening. I hope you're ready. I hope that you know for

626
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:44,720
sure that heaven is your home. If you have any doubt whatsoever, let us take a Bible

627
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:50,240
and show you how you can know for sure. Don't leave here tonight without knowing with 100%

628
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:55,460
confidence that heaven is your home. Let's pray together. Father, we love you. We thank

629
00:40:55,460 --> 00:41:00,900
you so much for loving us. We thank you for the text of Scripture that records for us

630
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:07,140
the death and burial of Jacob. I thank you for the practical lessons that we can learn.

631
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:14,860
Lord, as I've tried tonight to be very practical and applicable, I pray that we'd take heed.

632
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:22,780
That we'd each be ready for our time of departure, though we may not know when that will be.

633
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:29,220
Lord, help us to be ready. Lord, help us to have no regrets. God, maybe you've laid

634
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:34,060
upon someone's heart this evening something they need to deal with, a loved one they need

635
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:39,980
to contact, someone they need to speak with. God, I pray that you'd help us to not soon

636
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:48,820
forget that. Lord, help us to, with your help, have what might be a hard conversation so

637
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:56,860
that we do not regret having no conversation. God, I pray for each of us that know you as

638
00:41:56,860 --> 00:42:04,580
Lord and Savior. Unless we are raptured out of here, that when our home-going service

639
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:12,060
takes place, that it'd be a time of great rejoicing and celebration. That perhaps even

640
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:16,980
in those services that loved ones would gather together, they'd hear the gospel and they'd

641
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:24,100
be saved by the grace of God. What a joy and blessing that would be. I pray that in these

642
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:29,180
moments of invitation that you'd have your will in weighing. We'll thank you for it.

643
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:31,180
In Christ's name we pray. Would you stand with me?
