WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280
29 down through chapter 50 in verse number 14. And so we'll kind of bridge

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.800
both chapters this evening and look there if you will, Genesis

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:16.799
49 verse 29. This is the 101st message

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.840
in the book of Genesis and I thought we'd hit

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.120
a hundred and I wasn't able to quite get it all done in a hundred messages

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.280
so we're gonna be at like a hundred and three or four something like that

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:35.040
but praise the Lord I have thoroughly enjoyed the study I hope that you have

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.880
as well

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.000
and I've been praying about where to go next I think I think the Lord confirmed

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.360
it

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.240
but I'm not a hundred percent sure and so I'm gonna wait one more week to

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.080
announce it

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.200
but I'm pretty confident where God is leading me for our next study

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.479
and I'm excited about it. Genesis chapter 49 verse 29 and he

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:56.759
this is Jacob speaking, remember he blessed all the sons brought them in

00:00:56.759 --> 00:00:57.799
before him we've had

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:01.119
three weeks of lessons covering the first 28 verses

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:05.040
of Genesis 49. Each son stood before Jacob

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.839
and we find that he's speaking it says he charged them

00:01:08.839 --> 00:01:13.319
and said unto them I am to be gathered

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:18.639
unto my people. Bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:23.440
Ephron the Hittite. The cave that is in the field of Machpelah which

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.040
is before Mamre in the land of Canaan which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.800
the Hittite

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.639
for possession of a burying place. There they buried Abraham and Sarah's wife

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:34.319
there

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:38.080
they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife and there I buried

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.199
Leah. The purchase of the field and of the cave that is

00:01:42.199 --> 00:01:45.680
therein was from the children of Heth.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.959
When Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:53.400
he gathered up his feet into the bed and yielded

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.120
up the ghost and was gathered unto his people.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.180
We'll read into chapter 50 as we get to the message this evening I've titled the

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.400
message Jacob's final request

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.559
and as we look at this passage of scripture we're reminded even as we've

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:10.320
mentioned for a number of weeks now

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.279
with regard to the death of Jacob being recorded in this chapter

00:02:14.279 --> 00:02:17.759
the Bible tells us as it appointed unto man once to die

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:22.679
but after this the judgment. In fact I just had someone tell me recently

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:25.839
when I asked them if they were sure that if they were to die that heaven is their

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:26.479
home

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:30.279
they said no. I mean they were confident that the answer was no

00:02:30.279 --> 00:02:34.199
and I thought that was an open door of opportunity to be able to share the

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:35.559
gospel and let them know

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:38.960
how they could be for sure and yet they were

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:44.759
rather they would desire to listen to various world views and ideologies with

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:46.440
regard to what happens

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.320
after death. I'm thankful that God has given us the authoritative word

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.240
and he has revealed to us in his word what happens after death.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.639
As we look at the account that is given to us of Jacob's death

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:03.440
let me say this tonight not everyone is going to experience the same kind of

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.160
death.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.160
What do I mean by that? Well it's not always possible that you're going to

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.160
know that you're going to die and have opportunity to bring your family members

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.080
into your presence and to speak to them and to

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.440
share with them what's on your heart and then after you're done speaking get in

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.399
bed and die.

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:24.080
It'd be pretty nice if it happened that way

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.279
wouldn't it? But the reality is it doesn't happen that many for many.

00:03:28.279 --> 00:03:32.119
It just doesn't happen that way for many people.

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:35.559
And we do understand that as we look at this passage of scripture I really just

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:36.759
have two thoughts

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:40.639
with regard to points if you will with regard to the message this evening

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.479
but then I want to give you a number of practical tips that I hope would be

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:44.679
helpful this evening

00:03:44.679 --> 00:03:47.720
as we look at a passage of scripture like this things that are

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:53.160
just practical applicable truths that we can deal with tonight but as we look at

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.440
the scripture let me give you one

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.039
two thoughts tonight number one the request

00:03:58.039 --> 00:04:01.479
given. We read these verses in verse 29 through 33

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:04.600
and we see that Jacob gives a request to his children

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.320
the boys are gathered we mentioned already the purpose in the process and

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.559
the prophetic view even as Jacob shares things

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:15.600
that stretch all the way from the time of Jacob into the millennial reign of

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.320
Christ

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.880
those events have not even taken place yet but Jacob

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.480
in Genesis chapter 49 with this prophetic view he speaks words that are

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.200
yet to be fulfilled

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.239
but we have confidence in knowing that they will be fulfilled

00:04:30.239 --> 00:04:34.559
our Lord is going to return and after seven years of tribulation on this

00:04:34.559 --> 00:04:38.040
earth he is going to establish his millennial kingdom

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.959
he is going to rule and reign for a thousand years

00:04:41.959 --> 00:04:45.720
amen this is this is true Bible

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.839
teaching and we find that Jacob's

00:04:48.839 --> 00:04:52.799
message really covers a large span

00:04:52.799 --> 00:04:57.640
of human history all the way into the millennial reign of Christ but after

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:58.040
this

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:03.279
process is completed and after each of the the boys stand before dad and

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:06.359
and after he gives them the the blessing it says

00:05:06.359 --> 00:05:09.399
and he charged them you notice that in verse number 29

00:05:09.399 --> 00:05:13.600
and I believe that as he begins to to give this charge it's the request that's

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:14.760
given it's Jacob's

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.880
final request and as he would have his sons gathered together

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.839
and he gives them this request he says that he charged them

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:27.359
and notice specifically what Jacob makes request of

00:05:27.359 --> 00:05:33.200
he tells them I'm gonna die how's he worded he says well I am to be gathered

00:05:33.519 --> 00:05:38.279
unto my people and notice he says bury me

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:42.079
with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of

00:05:42.079 --> 00:05:47.000
Ephron the Hittite Jacob at this particular time

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.320
is where well he's in Egypt remember

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.480
God has moved in such a way that he allowed Joseph

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.920
to go through some circumstances that were less than desirable

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.239
and after going through all of those circumstances and sold into slavery and

00:06:01.239 --> 00:06:02.279
all that takes place

00:06:02.399 --> 00:06:07.160
we find that Jacob eventually receives word that Joseph is alive

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.640
and he calls for his father and his brethren his family

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.799
to come to Egypt and it was there in Egypt that

00:06:13.799 --> 00:06:18.799
that God would use Joseph to sustain his children his people

00:06:18.799 --> 00:06:22.600
we find that it was there that God would give them a possession

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:27.119
and he would give them the the the provision that they would need and we

00:06:27.119 --> 00:06:27.760
find

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.559
that before they went on their journey

00:06:30.559 --> 00:06:33.920
that God in Genesis chapter 46 spoke

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:38.359
to Jacob and he tells Jacob fear not to go down

00:06:38.359 --> 00:06:43.920
there why to go down into Egypt for I will there make of thee a great nation

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:47.359
he says in verse number four I will go down with thee into Egypt

00:06:47.359 --> 00:06:50.519
notice and I will also surely bring thee

00:06:50.519 --> 00:06:53.679
up again and Joseph shall put his hand

00:06:53.839 --> 00:06:55.119
upon thine eyes

00:06:55.119 --> 00:06:58.519
and we find that Jacob received that promise he's been there now

00:06:58.519 --> 00:07:01.799
as we study the scripture we put the timeline together he's been there for

00:07:01.799 --> 00:07:03.000
seventeen years

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.200
and after seventeen years of being in Egypt his

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:10.279
death is now at hand the time of his departure

00:07:10.279 --> 00:07:13.559
as Paul would say in 2nd Timothy chapter 4 is

00:07:13.559 --> 00:07:17.920
at hand and he makes this single request

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:23.640
don't bury me in Egypt don't bury me in Egypt

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:28.000
he says bury me with my father's in the cave that is the field of

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.519
Ephron the Hittite I won't read all the verses again because

00:07:32.519 --> 00:07:35.640
I've already read them for sake of time but I want you to notice

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:38.799
that in this request that Jacob is very specific

00:07:38.799 --> 00:07:42.399
he makes sure that he specifically indicates

00:07:42.399 --> 00:07:46.600
the particular place where he is to be buried he doesn't just say don't bury me

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.720
here he says bury me in this place

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:53.720
he then goes through the events that led to this particular cave

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.959
being purchased in this land being purchased

00:07:56.959 --> 00:08:01.119
and the right of ownership that's where I want to be buried

00:08:01.119 --> 00:08:04.679
he says that there are others that are buried there if you look in verse 31

00:08:04.679 --> 00:08:07.839
he mentions Abraham and Sarah he mentions Isaac and Rebekah

00:08:07.839 --> 00:08:11.959
and he mentions Leah and he makes it extremely clear and

00:08:11.959 --> 00:08:15.959
extremely specific with regard to the request

00:08:16.519 --> 00:08:20.000
by the way we could make various application with regard to that

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.640
and we'll make some at the end of the message but I want you to understand

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:28.160
that Jacob in making this request he's being very clear

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:32.599
he's making it known this is my desire

00:08:32.599 --> 00:08:38.799
this is my request I do not think that the boys after verse number 33

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:43.119
when Jacob puts his feet back up into the bed and yields up the ghost in

00:08:43.119 --> 00:08:47.359
other words he died he was gathered into his people I do not think that at

00:08:47.359 --> 00:08:48.200
that moment

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:52.719
that the boys stand around and say well what should we do no it was very clear

00:08:52.719 --> 00:08:54.119
what had been communicated

00:08:54.119 --> 00:08:57.880
the request of Jacob his final request

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:01.599
was given as we enter into chapter 50

00:09:01.599 --> 00:09:04.799
I want you to notice number two with me the request is granted

00:09:04.799 --> 00:09:08.039
I want you to notice that the Bible tells us in verse number 50

00:09:08.039 --> 00:09:12.440
and excuse me in verse number one of chapter number 50 and Joseph

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:17.679
fell upon his father's face and wept upon him and kissed him

00:09:17.679 --> 00:09:21.039
I want you to notice from verse number one as we look at this verse of

00:09:21.039 --> 00:09:21.760
scripture

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:25.119
that the Bible regularly I dealt with this

00:09:25.119 --> 00:09:29.599
probably at this point a year and a half ago when Sarah died and we read of

00:09:29.599 --> 00:09:33.200
Abraham and his mourning for the death of his wife Sarah

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:36.960
and we see in verse number one of chapter 50 we understand that we are

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.280
emotional people

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:41.799
God has made us that way and we understand

00:09:41.799 --> 00:09:44.919
that at times of loss like as we look at here

00:09:44.919 --> 00:09:49.000
and we talk about physical death and we're associated we understand

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.280
what it is to have a loved one pass on into eternity

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:57.159
the reality is that we do have emotions

00:09:57.159 --> 00:09:59.960
we do mourn we do have

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:05.720
sorrow, but I'm thankful for the truth of 1 Thessalonians chapter number 4 that tells

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:11.800
us if we have loved ones that are saved, that are heaven-bound, that if they die, that we

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:17.280
sorrow not as others which have no hope.

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.440
Aren't you thankful that we have a whole Bible?

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:24.240
Aren't you thankful this evening that God gives us the truth with regard to eternity,

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:29.800
with regard to not only how to live this life, but what happens thereafter?

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:35.000
So thankful this evening to have the authority of God's Word, and listen, I understand this

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.080
evening that when you have a loved one that enters into eternity, that there's an emotional

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.920
aspect of that.

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:48.440
But oh, how we can hold and cling to the promises of God.

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:53.920
So often we use the terminology, I think actually I just used it a moment ago, that you lose

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:54.920
a loved one.

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:59.480
Listen, if your loved one is saved by the grace of God, they're not lost, they're in

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:00.480
heaven.

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.200
We know exactly where they are.

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:03.200
Amen.

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.320
They're with our Savior, hallelujah.

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:10.000
To be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.120
Isn't that a wonderful promise of God's Word?

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:17.100
And we find this evening that we sorrow not as others which have no hope.

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:21.520
At the end of that passage in 1 Thessalonians chapter number 4, the Bible says, wherefore

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:25.780
comfort one another with these words.

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:27.520
These words are comforting words.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:33.840
These words are words that in our time, in our moment of sorrow and grief, that we can

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:40.080
have the comfort of God's Word and the comfort of the Holy Spirit.

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:42.520
We find that Joseph is weeping.

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:48.880
Again, an emotional individual, an emotional being in dealing with the departure of his

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:49.880
father.

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:55.920
Again, we have the whole of Scripture and we can rejoice and understand that one day

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:57.840
by the grace of God we'll be reunited.

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:59.960
What a wonderful truth that is.

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:04.880
I remember reading of D.L. Moody and it says that D.L. Moody gave this testimony that one

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:10.640
day you're going to read that D.L. Moody has died.

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:14.040
Now some preachers, I've heard some preachers say, I check the obituaries every day to find

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:15.320
out if I'm in there.

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:17.400
I don't understand that.

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:21.720
But the reality is that he said, you're going to read one day that D.L. Moody is dead.

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:23.380
He said, don't believe it.

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:25.040
Don't believe it for one second.

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:28.640
He said, because at that moment I'm going to be more alive than I've ever been.

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:33.280
And then you're going to go into this testimony of sharing the truth of knowing that to be

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:38.000
absent from this body is to be present with the Lord, that this mortal shall put on immortality,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.920
that this corruption shall put on incorruption.

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:44.320
And what a joy and what a blessing.

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:47.360
We'll be more alive then than we've ever been.

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:52.080
Verse two says, and Joseph commanded his servants, the physicians, to embalm his father and the

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:54.360
physicians embalmed Israel.

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:55.360
That's Jacob.

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:57.200
Of course, his name had been changed to Israel.

00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:01.120
Notice in verse number three, and 40 days were fulfilled for him.

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:05.800
For so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed and the Egyptians mourned for

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:08.960
him three score and 10 days.

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:13.360
When the days of his mourning were passed, Joseph spake in the house of Pharaoh saying,

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:17.920
if now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you in the ears of Pharaoh saying,

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:23.440
my father made me swear, saying, lo, I die in my grave, which I have digged for me in

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:27.220
the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me.

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:28.920
That's what he understood his father.

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:32.960
That's the summary statement of what he understood that final request to be.

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:38.620
And it says now, therefore, verse number five, let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father

00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:41.980
and I will come again.

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:45.940
Notice Joseph understood exactly what the request was.

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:50.780
And Joseph gives his petition before Pharaoh, and we find that Pharaoh responds and says

00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:57.340
in verse six, go up and bury thy father according as he made thee swear.

00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:02.180
And Joseph went up to bury his father, and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh,

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:06.580
the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt, and all the house of

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:11.180
Joseph and his brethren in his father's house, only their little ones and their flocks and

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:15.380
their herds they left in the land of Goshen.

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:21.500
There went up with him both chariots and horsemen, and it was a very great company.

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:28.820
They came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan, and there they mourned,

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:34.460
notice with a great and very sore lamentation, and he made a mourning for his father seven

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:35.460
days.

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:39.740
And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:45.060
of Atad, they said, this is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians, wherefore the name of it

00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:49.140
is called Abel Mizraim, which is beyond Jordan.

00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:58.380
And his sons, notice verse number 12, did unto him according as he commanded them.

00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:04.060
The request was granted, we read where they travel, they make the journey.

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:10.620
God details for us those that went and the great group of people that went to go for

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:16.020
this funeral procession, if you will, this burying of Jacob, and we find that even the

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:21.580
inhabitants of the land, they saw the great host of company, they made their assumptions

00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:27.180
based on what they observed, and we find that the Bible tells us in verse 13, for his sons

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:33.100
carried him into the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah,

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:38.740
which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a burying place of Ephraim the

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:41.700
Hittite before Mamre.

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:48.140
Is that not the exact place that had been given at the end of chapter 49 by Jacob in

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:53.020
his request with regard to where he would be buried?

00:15:53.020 --> 00:16:00.580
We find that the request is granted and Jacob is buried in this cave, in this burying place

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:05.380
that is mentioned in chapter 49 and again in chapter number 50, and I want you to notice

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:11.860
in verse number 14, the Bible says, and Joseph returned into Egypt.

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:17.940
Remember he told Pharaoh that I will, I pray thee to let me go up, I pray thee and bury

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:22.340
my father and I will come again in verse number 5, and the Bible says that Joseph returned

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:27.540
into Egypt, he and his brethren and all that went up with him to bury his father after

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:31.900
he had buried his father.

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:36.300
As we look at this passage of Scripture this evening and we understand the request that

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:43.100
was given, we understand the request was granted, and we understand those things that are captured

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:47.760
here with regard to mourning and weeping, and we understand that we sorrow not as others

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:52.180
which have no hope, and we can make those applications, I think it's important to understand

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:57.340
in verse 14 that the Bible says that Joseph, not only Joseph, but all of his brethren,

00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:59.220
they returned back to Egypt.

00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:04.540
Listen, I've heard people make the statement when they're at a funeral, I just can't go

00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:05.540
on.

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:10.300
No, no, you have to continue going on, amen?

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:14.540
There's some people that think life's not worth living, I'm just, no, no, no, God still

00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:20.460
has a purpose for you, God still has a plan for you, and we understand that life, there's

00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:27.260
a time to be born, there's a time to die, and I know that there are times in which families

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:32.260
will have discussions and maybe some would think it's a dark conversation, one that they

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:36.640
don't want to have, but they'll make comments with regard to if I die first or if you die

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:42.160
first and that sort of thing, but the reality is that we don't always have what we would

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:45.660
wish with regard to our departure from this life.

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:48.380
I've already made that known in Genesis 49.

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:52.220
Not all of us are going to have the opportunity to bring our family into our presence and

00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:56.540
then put our feet up into bed and then die.

00:17:56.540 --> 00:18:01.260
So as we look at this passage of Scripture and we understand that God has recorded for

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:08.280
us this request and this desire of Jacob and we see it fulfilled, I find this evening as

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:14.900
I consider this passage of Scripture that God has revealed to us in His Word that we're

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:18.460
all going to face death.

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:27.860
We find that Hezekiah is told that he's going to die, set thy house in order, wow.

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:32.300
You know, not everyone has that opportunity either to be told you're going to die, set

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:34.640
your house in order.

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:45.340
Sometimes death is, I mean, it's just a quote-unquote unexpected from human perspective, right?

00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:49.980
So unless the rapture occurs, and I don't say unless the rapture occurs as if I don't

00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:55.540
think it's going to occur, I know that the rapture is going to take place, but unless

00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:59.940
in our lifetime it doesn't take place, then we're going to die.

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:04.940
I like what Brother Mershawn says, I'm looking for the upper taker and not the undertaker,

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:06.460
and certainly that is true.

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:08.100
I'm listening for the trumpet.

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:12.820
You see the things that are happening in our world today, man, it's getting close.

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:16.220
It's getting close, amen?

00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:21.300
You look at world events, listen, unless you have your head in the sand, you have to acknowledge

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:23.860
we're getting close.

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:27.820
I got those alerts on my phone last night, just like you probably did, with regard to

00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:31.660
all that was taking place internationally, listen, that's a big deal.

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:34.220
That's a really significant situation.

00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:38.500
I've mentioned from this pulpit before, listen, before there can be a peace treaty, there's

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:41.140
got to be much turmoil.

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:43.360
And the anti-Christ is going to begin with a peace treaty.

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:44.360
We read that.

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:46.619
We understand that.

00:19:46.619 --> 00:19:50.940
I don't know how much turmoil will take place before the rapture, before we hear the trumpet

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:55.460
of the Lord, but I believe we're getting close.

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:57.080
We ought to be ready.

00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:59.940
I said to someone just recently, not only the…

00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:04.100
return of Christ is imminent, but the reality is that there's just really a step between

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:06.440
me and death.

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:10.340
I shared actually the last two Saturdays that I've had the opportunity to go out on visitation,

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:14.580
I've shared with people about that bridge collapse.

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:15.580
You read about it.

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:16.580
You saw it.

00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:17.580
Can you imagine?

00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:23.820
There's no expectation of those folks driving over that bridge and thinking that, no, but

00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:29.100
death, it can just happen.

00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:34.300
And so for each one of us, unless we're raptured out of here, we're going to face death.

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:39.060
Each one of us, unless we're raptured out of here, we're going to deal with a loved

00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:40.060
one dying.

00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:41.060
Amen?

00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:44.060
We're going to deal with it.

00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:46.740
You say, I don't want to think about that.

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:47.740
It's life.

00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:48.740
It's just the reality.

00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:49.740
Amen?

00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:55.220
I don't seem, I don't want to be unkind or cold about it, but the reality is that it's

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:58.500
something that we must acknowledge, we must consider.

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:03.020
The Bible says, as I quoted just a moment ago in Hebrews 9 and verse number 27, as it

00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:11.300
is appointed unto man once to die, after this the judgment.

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:17.500
I don't know when I'm going to die, and you don't know when you're going to die either.

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:19.700
We just don't know.

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:25.220
But can I tell you this evening, when we understand a passage of Scripture like this, when we

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:30.260
take into consideration what God tells us in His Word and other portions of Scripture

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:32.900
with regard to death, let me say a couple of things.

00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:35.980
Number one, you better be ready.

00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:38.060
Be ready.

00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:39.100
What does that entail?

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:41.260
What does it mean when I say be ready for death?

00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:44.700
Well, number one, I would say this, you better be sure that you're saved.

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:52.220
Listen, we could take a trip this evening to any number of grave sites in our region,

00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:58.620
and you could go to any number of tombstone and those grave markers, and you could look

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:03.700
at those, and you could take a journey, and you could find this evening that there are

00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:10.180
people that are younger than you, and there are people that are older than you that are

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:11.699
buried in those places.

00:22:11.699 --> 00:22:17.059
See, death has no determination of your age.

00:22:17.059 --> 00:22:23.380
In fact, the reality is that there could be some very sick people that will live longer

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:27.460
than those of us that think we're relatively healthy.

00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:33.020
I remember sitting with Mary Fenley's granddaughter before she died, and I remember sitting there,

00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:38.180
and I don't believe her husband was saved.

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:40.500
The doctor had just given her a few days to live.

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:45.020
She had cancer and had been going for a while, and I looked at that man, and the reality

00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:49.220
is there was only so much you could still say to the granddaughter that was nearing

00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:50.220
death.

00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:55.460
Her cognitive abilities were just deteriorating significantly, her ability to communicate,

00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:56.619
so on and so forth.

00:22:56.619 --> 00:23:00.900
And I looked at that man, and I said to him, he had the same name as I, and I said, Chris,

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:08.020
listen, I understand that it seems as if your wife is going to die at any moment.

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:09.020
And it was reality.

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:10.020
It was a certain situation.

00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:13.100
And I said, let me ask you, Chris.

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:19.100
And I said, because the reality is that either one of us could die before her.

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:23.260
No medical doctor has diagnosed me with any terminal illness.

00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:29.139
No one's given me a time, but I could leave your house this afternoon, and on my way back

00:23:29.139 --> 00:23:34.619
to the church, I could get in a car accident and enter into heaven, enter into eternity.

00:23:34.619 --> 00:23:40.020
We don't know, and so we better make sure that we're saved.

00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:44.380
Every young person, every old person, everyone in between, you say, am I young or old?

00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:46.339
You figure that out, amen?

00:23:46.339 --> 00:23:53.220
But every single person that's understanding the truth of the gospel needs to make sure

00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:56.460
that heaven is their home.

00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:59.619
Can I say this when I say be ready?

00:23:59.619 --> 00:24:04.000
Not only that you know that you're saved, I mean, I hope that you know that you know

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.419
that you know that you know that heaven is your home.

00:24:07.419 --> 00:24:09.699
I mean, no doubts, no concerns.

00:24:09.699 --> 00:24:14.300
I mean, no one can talk you out of it, amen?

00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:16.299
You know that you're saved by the grace of God.

00:24:16.299 --> 00:24:23.820
But let me say this, you've got to be ready, but I would say that you have no regrets.

00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:28.140
What I mean by having no regrets is, hey, pastor, how could I ever have no regrets?

00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:30.580
There's so many things in my life, and so on and so forth.

00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:34.220
Listen, I've heard people say this, and this is where I'm trying to be very practical this

00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:35.220
evening.

00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:38.140
I've heard people say, I wish I would have.

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:40.059
Just do it.

00:24:40.059 --> 00:24:45.500
I wish I would have told them, pick up the phone and call them.

00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:47.540
Why?

00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:55.580
Because you don't want to stand at some funeral service and regret not telling them whatever's

00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:58.299
on your heart.

00:24:58.299 --> 00:25:01.179
I'm just being transparent this evening.

00:25:01.179 --> 00:25:03.140
Have no regrets.

00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:05.940
Because you don't know when that loved one is going to die, and you don't know when you're

00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:08.420
going to die.

00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:10.420
You have a loved one that you're praying for.

00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:14.700
I have loved ones that I have prayed for, for salvation for years, that I've tried to

00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:17.619
talk to them and they just no longer want to listen to me.

00:25:17.619 --> 00:25:22.420
And a number of years ago now, I sat down and I wrote handwritten letters.

00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:26.500
I know that's old school, but I wanted them to know that it was from the heart.

00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:27.899
I didn't just send a text or an email.

00:25:27.899 --> 00:25:34.059
I sat down and I wrote handwritten letters expressing to my relatives my desire for them

00:25:34.059 --> 00:25:38.380
to be saved, and sharing the gospel in written form.

00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:39.540
Why?

00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:41.899
Because they stopped listening to me.

00:25:41.899 --> 00:25:46.700
And I want them to know that I love them, but more than me loving them, God loves them.

00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:49.580
And God wants them to be saved.

00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:50.580
Amen?

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:55.140
1 Timothy chapter 2, that God's will that all men would be saved, and coming to the

00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:59.339
knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord is not slack concerning His promises.

00:25:59.339 --> 00:26:03.660
Some men count slackness, but His longsuffering to us, we're not willing that any should

00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:07.339
perish, but that all should come to repentance.

00:26:07.339 --> 00:26:13.260
I don't want to be in a situation where I find out that a loved one passed on into eternity,

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:20.160
and I said, man, I wish I would have told them about Jesus.

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:25.580
We hear that there are many that have other regrets with regard to, I never told them

00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:28.140
X, Y, or Z, whatever it might be.

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:30.380
Listen, you know how you have no regrets?

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:31.380
You just deal with it now.

00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:34.980
You say, but it's a hard conversation.

00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:38.779
It'll be better to have a hard conversation than have no conversation.

00:26:38.779 --> 00:26:41.500
Amen?

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:42.980
You say, pastor, I don't like that.

00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:46.220
I'm just being honest with you tonight.

00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:52.880
You don't know how many times I've had the, I'll call it an unfortunate privilege to sit

00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:59.019
with people that are mourning, and they're beating themselves up over what they wish

00:26:59.459 --> 00:27:04.380
they had done, and now it's too late.

00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:07.260
What do you say to someone?

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:10.700
The only thing you can say to someone is on this side of eternity.

00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:11.700
Amen?

00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:14.720
And so this evening, I would say be ready.

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:16.179
Make sure of your salvation.

00:27:16.179 --> 00:27:18.000
I would say have no regrets.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.899
Let me say this, very practical this evening, really probably my most practical thought

00:27:21.899 --> 00:27:25.660
from this passage of Scripture.

00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:28.739
Make your desires known.

00:27:29.459 --> 00:27:32.420
What do I mean by that?

00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:34.899
Jacob sat down with his boys.

00:27:34.899 --> 00:27:37.679
He called them in knowing that he would soon die.

00:27:37.679 --> 00:27:41.940
He not only shared with them and gave them the blessings, and we read all of that, that

00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:46.059
we've dealt with over the last three weeks, but at the end of that conversation, he makes

00:27:46.059 --> 00:27:48.739
his requests known.

00:27:48.739 --> 00:27:50.380
He makes his desire known.

00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:52.179
He makes it abundantly clear.

00:27:52.179 --> 00:27:56.299
And so why do I say that this evening to make your desires known?

00:27:56.299 --> 00:28:01.899
Well, what do you, let me just be very practical this evening.

00:28:01.899 --> 00:28:12.739
As a pastor, I have the responsibility, I'm going to come down here, I have the responsibility,

00:28:12.739 --> 00:28:17.420
the privilege, and the honor of marrying people.

00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:21.420
It's a blessed time.

00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:28.540
I have the opportunity, the privilege, the responsibility of having baby dedications.

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:33.859
The privilege, responsibility, opportunity of seeing people saved and baptized and doing

00:28:33.859 --> 00:28:34.859
the baptism.

00:28:34.859 --> 00:28:38.000
And man, what a joy that is.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:46.820
But I also have the privilege, the responsibility, and opportunity to conduct funerals.

00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:53.580
Do you know how hard it is for a pastor to do a funeral when the deceased has not made

00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:55.659
their desires known to their family?

00:28:55.659 --> 00:28:58.659
What do I mean by that?

00:28:58.659 --> 00:29:01.979
Well, not all of your family is saved.

00:29:01.979 --> 00:29:04.380
I'm being very practical this evening.

00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:07.380
I'm trying to help all of us, okay?

00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:08.900
Not all of your family is saved.

00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:12.559
And you know who has the most say in your funeral?

00:29:12.559 --> 00:29:19.440
Your family, not your pastor.

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:22.799
Your family, not your pastor.

00:29:22.799 --> 00:29:26.080
So if you're saved by the grace of God and you know that you're heaven-bound and you

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:32.039
have family that's not, it'd be a good idea to let your family know what you desire for

00:29:32.039 --> 00:29:35.720
your funeral service, your home-going service.

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:36.960
Why?

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:42.460
So that when your pastor wants to have that home-going service and that celebration of

00:29:42.559 --> 00:29:47.140
life, and that family comes in and they say, here's what we want, and we want this, and

00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:55.720
we want this, and we want this, and then it's all kinds of chaos.

00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:56.900
It's the way it happens.

00:29:56.900 --> 00:30:04.340
See, at my homegoing service, I want the gospel preached.

00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:10.220
I want there to be some songs of rejoicing.

00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:14.460
One of the best funeral services we've ever had is when Joe Harrow went home to be with

00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:15.460
the Lord.

00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:18.720
Man, it was just a celebration.

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:20.740
He was in heaven.

00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:23.060
We were rejoicing.

00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:28.140
There was no real conflict with the family with regard to what they wanted.

00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:29.140
They knew.

00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:33.380
I don't know that he sat down and specifically told them, here are the songs, but see, here's

00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:37.500
what happens sometimes is somebody will come to me as the pastor and say, hey, at my funeral

00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:41.620
I want these songs and I want this and that and so on and so forth, but they never let

00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:45.220
their family know.

00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:52.580
And then it gives me a difficulty because not all of your family is saved.

00:30:52.580 --> 00:31:00.700
David makes his requests known, very direct and very specific.

00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:07.500
You have loved ones that most likely, friends, loved ones are going to come to your funeral

00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:08.700
service.

00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:11.140
You want them to hear the truth.

00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:12.140
You know what's a sad thing?

00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:19.700
I have been to funeral services and I'm sure you have as well where the gospel is not preached.

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:22.580
What an opportunity.

00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:26.700
In fact, we find in the Bible that the Bible tells us that it's better to go to the house

00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:34.180
of mourning than to the house of feasting for this is the end of all men.

00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:39.520
I understand tonight that it's not the most popular subject to deal with, but what a tragic

00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:51.480
situation when a loved one enters into glory, into heaven, and the gospel is not even preached.

00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:56.560
Sometimes as the pastor I'm extremely limited on what I can say and do.

00:31:56.560 --> 00:32:02.320
There's a family pressure, I'm being very transparent with you this evening, that can

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:06.160
become very difficult to deal with.

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:11.600
I won't mention the names, but we've had funerals here, that I've had funerals at other

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:16.840
places that I've gone and done funerals that are very difficult.

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:21.640
I had a pastor friend that was going to be having to travel to preach the funeral for

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:28.200
his brother, and he was already on the schedule to preach a funeral for an individual, and

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:34.000
so he contacted me and said, hey, can you help me out and can you preach this funeral?

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:40.200
I don't know the people, I don't know anything about them, talk about a difficult situation.

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:45.840
And then I get the email with all the information, and they're, I don't say this in a negative

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:50.960
way, but they're Polish, and all of these names I couldn't even begin to pronounce,

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:56.520
and I'm like, this is such a mess, I'm going to be in so much trouble.

00:32:56.520 --> 00:33:01.400
And I had some conversation with the funeral home director, and they were giving me some

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:02.400
information.

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:06.380
So it's really best that I connect with the wife of the deceased so that we can figure

00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:09.040
out some things.

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:14.440
She communicated to me through the funeral director, not to me personally, but she communicated

00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:20.740
that we're not really religious people, and we're not really interested in the Bible,

00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:25.520
and we really don't want any reference to heaven.

00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:31.080
What am I supposed to do with that?

00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:33.680
That's a tough situation.

00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:42.600
And I wrote back, and I said, listen, it was through email, and I said, I'm a Baptist preacher.

00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:47.880
I'm not trying to convert anyone to become a Baptist, but if I'm going to conduct a funeral

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:53.200
service, I am going to say something about Jesus, and I am going to say something about

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:57.920
heaven, and I am going to use the Bible.

00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:02.520
If you don't want that, I suggest that you find someone else.

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:05.480
I'm not trying to be unkind.

00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:08.600
I'm accountable to God.

00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:10.520
Amen?

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:19.680
And how can I stand at a funeral service with a bunch of lost people, and tell them, your

00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:27.120
loved one is doing just fine, and everyone's going to be okay, and no.

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:29.840
The Bible doesn't teach us that.

00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:32.400
Do you read that in your Bible?

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:33.480
No.

00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:38.400
When we die, there's either heaven or the lake of fire.

00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:40.800
There's no in between.

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:46.960
There's no changing from one to the other.

00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:50.600
Amen?

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:59.320
That individual wasn't a member of our church, but what I submit to you this evening, it

00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:05.680
wasn't a member of that pastor's church either, just to be clear.

00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:11.320
If you let your requests known to your loved ones, it goes a long way to having the kind

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:14.960
of funeral service that you'd like to have.

00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:21.440
Because just letting your pastor know isn't enough.

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:30.040
Because your family is going to have more say in your funeral than your pastor is.

00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:32.960
I've done it so many times.

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:35.520
I'm just being honest with you.

00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:40.400
And so how can we be practical when we look at a passage of Scripture like this?

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:43.520
Number one, you better be ready for your departure.

00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:49.320
Not all of us are going to have the blessing and the benefit that Jacob did of knowing

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:54.480
and being able to speak to and then putting his feet back up in the bed and dying.

00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:58.080
So you better be sure of your salvation.

00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:03.040
If there's any doubt whatsoever, get it settled.

00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:07.080
Paul says to the believers in Corinth, he says, today is the day of salvation.

00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:10.880
Proverbs tells us, boast not thyself of tomorrow.

00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:12.120
Why?

00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:15.160
No man knoweth what a day may bring forth.

00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:16.720
James says, what is your life?

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:23.240
It's but a vapor that appeareth for a little time and then vanisheth away.

00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:26.000
Don't delay.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:30.960
Don't live in this state of doubt and I'm not really sure.

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:33.980
No, get it settled.

00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:37.640
Have no regrets with your family, your loved ones.

00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:39.760
Communicate to them what's on your heart.

00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:41.600
Share the gospel with them.

00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:45.120
If it has to be through letter form because they won't listen to you again, at least you

00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:52.320
can rest assured that you shared with them the truth and you don't have to regret saying,

00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:55.760
I wish I would have told them.

00:36:55.760 --> 00:37:03.080
Because standing at a funeral, trying to console an individual that is beating themselves up

00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:09.200
because I never told them is a difficult situation.

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:11.240
So have no regrets.

00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:13.480
But then let your desires be known.

00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:14.480
Communicate.

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:17.480
Here's what I want.

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:18.480
You want a certain song?

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:20.760
Man, have a certain song.

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:21.760
You want a certain verse?

00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:23.920
Have a certain verse.

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:28.800
I ask people, I just, the most recent funeral I did was for my great aunt.

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:33.080
I didn't even have any idea that she wanted me to preach her funeral.

00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:39.400
But she let her daughter know that when I die, I want, they call me Christopher because

00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:41.120
my dad's Chris.

00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:43.200
I want Christopher to do my funeral.

00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:48.840
And when I got the phone call, I said, she wants me to do the funeral?

00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:52.160
I mean, I'll do the funeral, that's great.

00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:54.000
I began to ask questions.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.160
There's really little information.

00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:56.800
So I was able to just do whatever I wanted to do.

00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:57.800
They didn't give any pushback.

00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:00.000
So that was really nice.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:05.360
But listen, if you have a life verse, if you have a certain song, if you want the gospel

00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:10.480
preached, if you want your pastor to do the service, Mary Fenley died, she'd always made

00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:15.280
it known that she wanted Brother Abbott to have part of her funeral service.

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:18.520
She thought she was going to die way before she did.

00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:21.000
She didn't think I'd be her pastor very long.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.040
She didn't know I'd be her pastor for almost nine years.

00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:25.760
She thought she'd die well before then.

00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:27.680
But I was their pastor for almost nine years.

00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:35.280
But I knew she had made it known to me and to her family that she wanted her other pastor,

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:36.840
Pastor Abbott, to have part of that service.

00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:38.960
That was a sweet service.

00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:40.040
Brother Abbott took part of it.

00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:41.040
I took part of it.

00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:42.080
It was a blessing.

00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:44.480
Some of you were here.

00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:51.300
Let it be known because your family is going to have more say about your funeral than your

00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:52.920
pastor will.

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:58.880
And if you want the gospel preached, even if they don't accept it, let it be known.

00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:04.520
I want the gospel preached at my service, at my home going.

00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:06.160
Amen?

00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:10.640
Because I think each of us here this evening, if you're saved by the grace of God, you would

00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:18.240
say tonight, when my time of departure comes, I want to have a home going service, a celebration

00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:19.240
of life.

00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:24.680
The fact that I'm in heaven with my Savior, I want the gospel preached, I want songs of

00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:25.680
rejoicing.

00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:29.920
Listen, I don't want it to be a sad time.

00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:30.920
It's a time of rejoicing.

00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:33.320
I understand that there's the sorrow part of it.

00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:39.280
But the reality is that our loved one's not lost with our Savior if they're saved by the

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:41.000
grace of God.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.160
Jacob, he gathers his sons together.

00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:46.160
He blesses them.

00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:49.200
He has time with them.

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:54.480
But then he specifically tells them what he desires.

00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:56.960
And then they fulfill specifically.

00:39:56.960 --> 00:40:04.880
me, the request that was given. They bury him in the place where he desired to be buried.

00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:10.040
What a joy and what a blessing. One day, I don't know the day, I don't want to be dark

00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:16.040
this evening. The reality is that death is just a doorway for the child of God. Death

00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:25.760
is not something that we have to fear. I might not be excited about the process, amen? But

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:34.120
I'm going to be with Jesus for all of eternity. We'll see him and we'll worship him. We'll

00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:40.080
praise his wonderful name this evening. I hope you're ready. I hope that you know for

00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:44.720
sure that heaven is your home. If you have any doubt whatsoever, let us take a Bible

00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:50.240
and show you how you can know for sure. Don't leave here tonight without knowing with 100%

00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:55.460
confidence that heaven is your home. Let's pray together. Father, we love you. We thank

00:40:55.460 --> 00:41:00.900
you so much for loving us. We thank you for the text of Scripture that records for us

00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:07.140
the death and burial of Jacob. I thank you for the practical lessons that we can learn.

00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:14.860
Lord, as I've tried tonight to be very practical and applicable, I pray that we'd take heed.

00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:22.780
That we'd each be ready for our time of departure, though we may not know when that will be.

00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:29.220
Lord, help us to be ready. Lord, help us to have no regrets. God, maybe you've laid

00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:34.060
upon someone's heart this evening something they need to deal with, a loved one they need

00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:39.980
to contact, someone they need to speak with. God, I pray that you'd help us to not soon

00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:48.820
forget that. Lord, help us to, with your help, have what might be a hard conversation so

00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:56.860
that we do not regret having no conversation. God, I pray for each of us that know you as

00:41:56.860 --> 00:42:04.580
Lord and Savior. Unless we are raptured out of here, that when our home-going service

00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:12.060
takes place, that it'd be a time of great rejoicing and celebration. That perhaps even

00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:16.980
in those services that loved ones would gather together, they'd hear the gospel and they'd

00:42:17.020 --> 00:42:24.100
be saved by the grace of God. What a joy and blessing that would be. I pray that in these

00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:29.180
moments of invitation that you'd have your will in weighing. We'll thank you for it.

00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:31.180
In Christ's name we pray. Would you stand with me?
