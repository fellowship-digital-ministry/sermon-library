1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
He is Lord, He is God.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Ephesians chapter number 2, Ephesians chapter number 2 this morning,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and thankful for God's word, thankful for the instruction that He gives us.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm thankful that He reveals to us His greatness,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and we've been on the theme all year long, great is the Lord,

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and greatly to be praised, and we continue to look at what it is that we would,

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
or why it is that we would say that God is great.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I believe this morning that all of us probably would agree,

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and we would say yes, God is great, but why is God great?

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We've looked at a number of things this year as we've studied through His word,

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and on a quest, if you will, to discover God's greatness,

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and then as we close out this calendar year,

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
we will transition from discovering God's greatness to declaring God's greatness,

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and as we are aware of the very truth that our God is great,

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
we need to let others know how great our God is.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
There are so many people that we come in contact with on a regular basis

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
that simply do not know how great our God is,

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and how are they going to find out if we don't tell them,

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
and we'll transition to that phase of the series, if you will, near the end of the year,

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
but this morning as we look at Ephesians chapter number 2,

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
we'll be reminded that last week we examined God's greatness,

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
and we said He's great because He has a great plan of redemption.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
We talked about that plan of redemption and the reason that it was required,

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
but then we talked about the fact that God's plan of redemption reaches all people

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
of all times, and we sang this morning, whosoever will,

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
and I'm thankful that you can go anywhere around the world and you can preach the gospel

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
and you can say, based on the authority of God's word,

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
that Jesus died for them so that they could have eternal life,

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
and a free gift of salvation, and what a wonderful true blessing that is.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And we find that as we are understanding

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
of the truth that God has a plan of redemption, we continue

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
and understand as we look at the text of scripture this morning

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
that the believers here in Ephesus, they're being reminded of God's grace

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
and of God's mercy, His great love, as Paul is speaking

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
to them about the redemption, but then he tells them this in verse number 10

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
that they and we are His workmanship.

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
And we find that as we look at this portion of scripture,

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
and yes, we understand that God is great because He has a great plan of redemption

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
that reaches all people of all times, but I would say

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
that God is great this morning because God has a plan

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
for each individual believer. And you begin to think about

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
the plan that God has for us as individuals, those who have

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
responded in faith and trusted the Lord Jesus Christ

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
as their personal Savior, God has a plan for your life.

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And I want to encourage us to understand this morning that

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
the great God, the God that they just sang about, the God that we

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
are worshiping today, that we're singing about, seeking to exalt and magnify,

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
that He's the God of the universe, but He has a plan

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
for your life, individually. And He has a plan for every

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
single believer throughout the ages. He has

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
a plan for their lives. And that is such an encouragement to me.

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I believe that it's a fascinating truth of God's Word

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
that He has a plan for me. And you say, who am I, right?

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
We're just really a speck of nothing when you think about the

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
big picture, but God loves us so much that He saved us.

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
But after He saved us, He says, now I have a plan for your life.

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And here's what's amazing about God's plan for our life, is God has an individual

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
plan for each and every single one of us, and as we fulfill

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
God's plan for our lives, the ultimate purpose is to bring glory

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
to Him and to complete His master plan.

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Now that's amazing when you think about God and His greatness

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
that He has a plan that will come to pass

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
and then He includes us. Sometimes we can be

64
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
hard-headed, right? We can not do...

65
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
But God says, I have a plan for you, for your life, and I want to use you.

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Notice in the text of Scripture, I said that as Paul is

67
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
teaching and ministering to these people in Ephesus, He reminds them of their

68
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
salvation. He begins in verse number 1, and you hath He quickened who were

69
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
dead in trespasses and sins. And I'm thankful to be quickened,

70
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
to be made alive, to be saved, to be born again by the blood of Jesus

71
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Christ. It says, wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world,

72
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience,

73
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
among whom also, notice it says, we all had our

74
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
conversation in times past in the lust of our flesh, fulfilling the desires

75
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.

76
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
We all were in that same condition, but God, verse number

77
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
4, who is rich in mercy, for His great love wherewith He

78
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened

79
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
us together with Christ by grace, ye are saved, and hath raised us

80
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
up together and made us to sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus,

81
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
that in the ages to come He might show the exceeding

82
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
riches of His grace and His kindness toward us through Christ Jesus,

83
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
for by grace are ye saved through faith. And that not of yourselves, it is the

84
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
gift of God, not of works, lest any man should boast. And then notice verse number 10,

85
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
the subject matter we'll be dealing with this morning, for we. Paul didn't

86
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
say for I, he didn't say for you, he said for we. Why?

87
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
God has a plan for each of us individually, for we

88
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
those that have been born again, those that are saved by the blood of Christ, for we

89
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus

90
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
unto good works, which God hath

91
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
before ordained that we should walk

92
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
in them. Now understand very clearly this morning that though

93
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
He speaks about us being His workmanship and He says that we have been

94
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
created in Christ Jesus unto

95
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
good works, that you understand that though we're to walk in

96
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
this newness of life that He speaks of and we're to be involved

97
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
in doing these good works, it's not so that we can be saved

98
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
nor is it so that we can stay saved. I'm thankful that salvation

99
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
is entirely and completely dealt with

100
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
by Christ's substitutionary atonement on the cross of Calvary, His

101
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
death, burial, and glorious resurrection. It is finished.

102
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
But I can't

103
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
keep it by my good works either. I am sealed

104
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
under the day of redemption according to Ephesians chapter 1. I am kept

105
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
by the power of God according to 1 Peter chapter 1. Jesus said in

106
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
chapter number 10 that my sheep hear my voice and I know them and I give unto them

107
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
eternal life and they shall never perish.

108
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
And so I'm thankful this morning that the good works that are spoken of here

109
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
they don't save me and they don't keep me saved, but I am

110
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
God's workmanship. I am to do a work

111
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
for the Lord and as I begin to think about the fact that God

112
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
has a plan for me and for you as individuals, I believe

113
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
that this truth this morning reveals to us just how

114
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
great our God is. Think about it.

115
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I mean there's really not that many people that are gathered here this morning

116
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
but there's no way that any one of us could individually

117
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
have a plan for each individual and bring it all to pass

118
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
and by the way every other believer around the globe.

119
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
And not only for this moment in history

120
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
but for all of history. It's absolutely amazing

121
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
that God would use us and that God has a plan for our lives.

122
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
As we begin to think about this truth and the title is from verse number 10, we are

123
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
his workmanship. I want you to consider some biblical examples this morning.

124
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
We're going to go all the way back to the Old Testament, the book of Exodus and we're going to walk through and look at a few

125
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
verses of scripture this morning in order to give some biblical

126
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
examples to this truth that God has a plan for us

127
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
as individuals. Look at Exodus chapter number 3 if you will.

128
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
In this portion of scripture even as I mentioned Exodus 3

129
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
many of us will be familiar with the fact that we'll deal with Moses and many of us are

130
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
familiar with Moses and his place in God's

131
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
work and what God did in and through his life. But I want you to

132
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
see in Exodus chapter number 3 and really the first three examples that we're going to look

133
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
at here from the book of Exodus is just an amazing truth as you see

134
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
them all come together and how God brings to pass

135
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
his work through these individuals. In verse number 10 in Exodus

136
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
3 the Bible says this, come now therefore and I will send

137
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
thee unto Pharaoh that thou mayest bring

138
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.

139
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Do you see that God is speaking personally, individually to

140
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Moses and he's saying to Moses, Moses I'm going to send

141
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
thee to Pharaoh and I'm going to send you to Pharaoh

142
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
for a purpose, for a work to bring my people out

143
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
of Egypt. Now we know that God's going to work miraculously and God's going to

144
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
do the work but God used a man, a man by the name of Moses

145
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
so think about Moses and think about the way in which God used him and obviously

146
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Aaron and you can look at the text of scripture and see Aaron being used as well but I want you to

147
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
forward if you will to Exodus chapter 28 much after

148
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
the Exodus Moses is here receiving instruction with regard

149
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
to the tabernacle that was to be constructed and

150
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
as you come to this portion of scripture in Exodus chapter 28 and I begin to

151
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,460
this picture in my mind come together to help me

152
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:06,199
understand how great our God is and how he has a plan

153
00:10:06,199 --> 00:10:08,000
for each of us as individuals.

154
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,079
He used Moses, he called Moses by name.

155
00:10:11,079 --> 00:10:13,579
He's gonna use Moses to lead the children of Israel

156
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:17,180
out of Egyptian bondage and we know that Moses,

157
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,379
if we could use this term this morning,

158
00:10:19,379 --> 00:10:22,979
would be the human leader for the nation of Israel.

159
00:10:22,979 --> 00:10:27,120
But we know that Moses was not going to do everything.

160
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,159
He couldn't do everything.

161
00:10:29,299 --> 00:10:31,219
But God had a plan for his people.

162
00:10:31,219 --> 00:10:32,500
So what does God do?

163
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,380
Well, God is telling Moses about this tabernacle.

164
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,060
He's giving him all of the instruction

165
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,500
with regard to the tabernacle.

166
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,259
You come to chapter 28 and you notice

167
00:10:40,259 --> 00:10:41,459
that the Bible says this,

168
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:46,459
and take thou unto thee Aaron thy brother

169
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,500
and his sons with him from among the children of Israel

170
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,360
that he may minister unto me in the priest office,

171
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,700
even Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, Ithamar, Aaron's sons,

172
00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:00,799
and thou shalt make holy garments for Aaron thy brother

173
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:03,119
for glory and for beauty.

174
00:11:03,119 --> 00:11:04,919
And we see that in these verses of scripture

175
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:07,900
in Exodus chapter 28, as we could speak of

176
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,000
and reference the Aaronic priesthood

177
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,080
and understand that God is calling Aaron

178
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,519
and he has a plan for Aaron and for his sons.

179
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:19,160
And we find that this plan for Aaron

180
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:23,480
is going to differ from the plan that God has for Moses.

181
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,440
God has a plan for Moses.

182
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,480
God has a plan for Aaron.

183
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,260
But then I want you to look at a few more chapters

184
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:31,220
over in Exodus chapter 35,

185
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:35,080
because after there's kind of a parenthetical here

186
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,220
between Exodus chapter 28 and Exodus 35

187
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,540
and what happens is while Moses is up there on the mount,

188
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,660
the people of God defile themselves

189
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:46,580
and Moses comes down and then God reconfirms

190
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,379
some things with Moses and we find there's repentance

191
00:11:49,379 --> 00:11:52,099
and what have you, but you come to Exodus chapter 35

192
00:11:52,099 --> 00:11:54,660
and I'm gonna draw your attention to verse number 30.

193
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,680
We've seen Moses, we've seen Aaron,

194
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,099
but now I want to introduce you to a man

195
00:11:58,099 --> 00:12:00,800
that you're familiar with perhaps for the name of Bezalel.

196
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,319
The Bible says in verse number 30 of Exodus 35,

197
00:12:04,319 --> 00:12:06,720
and Moses said unto the children of Israel,

198
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,839
see, the Lord hath called by name Bezalel,

199
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:16,279
the son of Uri, the son of Hur of the tribe of Judah.

200
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:19,759
And he, that's speaking of God, hath filled him

201
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:22,559
with the spirit of God and wisdom and understanding

202
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:25,399
and a knowledge and all manner of workmanship

203
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:28,479
and to devise curious works, to work in gold

204
00:12:28,479 --> 00:12:30,839
and in silver and in brass and in the cutting of stones

205
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:33,119
to set them and in carving of wood

206
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:35,440
to make any manner of cunning work.

207
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,360
And it's put in his heart, that's God putting it

208
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,360
in the heart of Bezalel, that he may teach

209
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,880
both he and Aholiab, the son of Ahissamack

210
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,520
of the tribe of Dan.

211
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:50,300
Then hath he, God, filled with wisdom of heart

212
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,919
to work all manner of work of the engraver

213
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:55,639
of the cunning workman and of the embroiderer

214
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:58,720
in blue and in purple and scarlet and in fine linen

215
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,639
and of the weaver, even of them that do any work

216
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:05,479
and of those that devise cunning work.

217
00:13:05,479 --> 00:13:07,220
As I look at these first three examples

218
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,960
of Moses, Aaron, and Bezalel,

219
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,619
and you can include Aholiab there

220
00:13:10,619 --> 00:13:13,240
in this portion of scripture in Exodus chapter 35,

221
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,759
I find that God has a plan and a purpose

222
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:18,639
for his people corporately to be able to worship

223
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,520
at a place called the tabernacle.

224
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,600
And God would use Moses as the human leader

225
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,160
for the nation of Israel, but Moses could not do

226
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:29,399
all of the work by himself, and God has a plan for Moses.

227
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:31,520
And then God in his infinite wisdom

228
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,960
and his omniscience and his omnipotence

229
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:38,080
and in his individual plan for his people,

230
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,940
he says I have and I've called by name Aaron

231
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,800
and I have Aaron for this task.

232
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,360
The priest had a very important role

233
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,639
in the process of worship at the tabernacle.

234
00:13:49,479 --> 00:13:52,639
You enter the tabernacle through one way.

235
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,800
You first come to a thing, a piece of furniture

236
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,919
that's called the brazen altar,

237
00:13:57,919 --> 00:13:59,800
and at that brazen altar, the first thing

238
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,500
that has to be done is an offering has to be made.

239
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,800
How do we approach God?

240
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,580
Only through Jesus Christ.

241
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,759
There's only one way.

242
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:11,119
There's only one entrance into the tabernacle,

243
00:14:11,119 --> 00:14:13,320
and as soon as you enter, there's a sacrifice

244
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,359
that's required, and we know that Jesus is our Passover,

245
00:14:17,359 --> 00:14:19,600
and what a great blessing that is.

246
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,399
But the priests, they ministered and they served

247
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,760
and they were the ones that accepted

248
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,359
and processed the offering and all of those things,

249
00:14:27,359 --> 00:14:29,480
and God had a plan for them.

250
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,079
But then you think about all the furniture

251
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:35,200
that had to be made, the curtains and the brazen altar

252
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,920
and the laver, and you could go through

253
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,019
all of the pieces of furniture that had to be created,

254
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:42,720
that had to be assembled, and God says

255
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,640
I've called Bezalel for that task.

256
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,279
I have a plan for Bezalel.

257
00:14:48,119 --> 00:14:51,440
Now understand this morning that God had a plan for Moses

258
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,200
and that plan for Moses was an individual plan

259
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,339
that God had for that individual Moses.

260
00:14:57,339 --> 00:15:00,799
God had a plan for Aaron and God had a plan for Bezalel.

261
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:04,040
Their plans differ, their roles differ,

262
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,839
but ultimately God would use each of them

263
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:10,720
to bring to pass what he wanted to accomplish.

264
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,559
That's absolutely amazing to me.

265
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:17,559
Fascinating that God would use us in that way.

266
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,799
Bezalel says no, I'm not gonna do it.

267
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:23,559
That'd be disastrous, unfortunate.

268
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:25,959
God would have to raise up somebody else,

269
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:28,239
but I want you to see that as they fulfill

270
00:15:28,239 --> 00:15:31,079
their individual roles and as they do

271
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:33,839
what they're supposed to do, that ultimately

272
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,079
you get to the last chapter of the book of Exodus,

273
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:41,679
in Exodus chapter number 40, and you read in that chapter

274
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:45,799
that they did all that they were commanded to do.

275
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:49,299
They finished the work that God had given them to do.

276
00:15:49,299 --> 00:15:51,679
The Bible tells us in verse number 33

277
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:54,839
of Exodus chapter number 40, and he reared up the court

278
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:57,480
around about the tabernacle and the altar

279
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,679
and set up the hangings of the court gate.

280
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:02,760
So Moses finished the work.

281
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,559
And as you begin to look forward and understand

282
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:08,399
all that's taking place, yes, at the end of Exodus 40,

283
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,480
the Bible tells us that God's presence,

284
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,239
the glory of the Lord, filled the tabernacle

285
00:16:12,239 --> 00:16:14,399
in verse number 35, and then you begin to think

286
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,820
about the place of the tabernacle in Israel's history

287
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,839
as you go forward from this point forward

288
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:23,359
and you see it being a place of worship.

289
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:27,480
God used individuals.

290
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,519
We could speak this morning of Joshua.

291
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,160
You could read in Deuteronomy 31.

292
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,799
We're gonna just reference some things.

293
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:34,480
I'm not gonna even go to the passages

294
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,720
and read them this morning for sake of time,

295
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,880
but you could go to the book of Deuteronomy

296
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,079
in the 31st chapter in verses seven and eight,

297
00:16:41,079 --> 00:16:44,540
and you can read how that God called Joshua specifically.

298
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,380
Why?

299
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,079
Moses was going to die.

300
00:16:47,079 --> 00:16:50,320
Moses was not permitted to enter into the land of promise,

301
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,480
and God says, I've raised up Joshua,

302
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,920
and Joshua, this is your job.

303
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,839
Joshua, this is my plan for your life.

304
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,279
Now, Joshua would be the human leader

305
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,600
for the children of Israel, and you could look

306
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,820
and you could look at David, a man that was just out

307
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:10,140
as a young teenager that was just tending to the flock

308
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:13,459
that when the man of God, Samuel, came to his hometown,

309
00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:16,119
that they didn't even call for David to come.

310
00:17:17,019 --> 00:17:19,720
Samuel was sent to that place in order to anoint

311
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,100
the one that would be the next king of Israel,

312
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:25,059
and though they stood there and Samuel thought,

313
00:17:25,059 --> 00:17:28,459
for sure, this is the one, God said, no, not him,

314
00:17:28,459 --> 00:17:31,420
and one by one, the sons of Jesse passed by,

315
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:35,100
and God said, no, and God said, no, and God said, no,

316
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,660
and Samuel says, are there any others?

317
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:43,660
The youngest, and he comes, and God says, he's the one.

318
00:17:44,459 --> 00:17:46,640
You know how it's referenced this way?

319
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,700
You can read of that in 1 Samuel 16, but in Psalm 78,

320
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:52,859
I love how the psalmist references this.

321
00:17:52,859 --> 00:17:55,959
In Psalm 78, in verse number 70 through 72,

322
00:17:55,959 --> 00:17:59,980
the last three verses of Psalm 78, the Bible says this,

323
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:04,160
speaking of God that he chose David, also his servant,

324
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,760
and took him from the sheepfolds,

325
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,200
from following the ewes, great with young,

326
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,559
he brought him to feed Jacob, his people,

327
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,959
and Israel, his inheritance, so he fed them

328
00:18:15,959 --> 00:18:18,000
according to the integrity of his heart,

329
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,079
and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.

330
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,359
This morning, if you were to speak about David

331
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:29,119
within a Jewish context, oh, how they would hold David

332
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:31,640
in such high regard and high esteem,

333
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,320
and we, as we look back to the Old Testament,

334
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,440
we look at the nation of Israel, and we say often

335
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:40,520
that David is probably the greatest king that Israel had,

336
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,119
and you can look to that, and you can see,

337
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:45,659
but God had a plan for his life as an individual.

338
00:18:45,659 --> 00:18:47,260
We can speak of Elijah.

339
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,919
We look at Elijah a couple of weeks ago,

340
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,880
and looked at God's comfort and care for Elijah,

341
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,280
but Elijah's ready to give up.

342
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,640
He's ready to, he said, just, I'm ready to die.

343
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,479
Why?

344
00:18:59,479 --> 00:19:01,960
I'm the only one, that was his perspective.

345
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,080
That's not bowed the knee to Baal.

346
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,919
Jezebel said, I'm gonna kill him.

347
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:06,960
That's what happened.

348
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,479
You know what God does?

349
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:14,460
God comes to Elijah and says, Elijah, I have a plan for you.

350
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:18,400
You can read of that in 1 Kings 19, verses 15 through 17.

351
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,640
God says, I have a plan for you, Elijah.

352
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:23,479
What do you think about Paul?

353
00:19:23,479 --> 00:19:24,739
God had a plan for Paul.

354
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,059
Paul says it this way.

355
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:29,700
If you look over at 2 Timothy, chapter number one,

356
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:33,659
and look at the New Testament with regard to this plan

357
00:19:33,659 --> 00:19:36,260
that God had for Paul,

358
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:39,440
we find that in 2 Timothy, chapter number one,

359
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,940
that Paul is giving as he's writing

360
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,219
to his son of the faith, Timothy.

361
00:19:44,219 --> 00:19:49,219
He's rehearsing this truth that God had a plan for his life.

362
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,900
In 2 Timothy, chapter number one,

363
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:51,900
beginning in verse number eight,

364
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,780
the Bible says, be not thou therefore ashamed

365
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:58,539
of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me, his prisoner,

366
00:19:58,539 --> 00:19:59,940
but be thou partaker.

367
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,540
the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God.

368
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:05,780
Notice what the Bible says, who have saved us.

369
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:08,080
Remember we talked about his plan of redemption last week,

370
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:13,080
but then he says this, and called us with a holy calling.

371
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,740
Not according to our works, but according to,

372
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:21,740
notice what it says, his own purpose and grace,

373
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:26,180
which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,

374
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:29,080
but is now made manifest by the appearing of our savior,

375
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,400
Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death,

376
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,880
and hath brought life and immortality to light

377
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,200
through the gospel.

378
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,960
Notice what Paul says, where unto I,

379
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,900
this is God's plan for Paul's life,

380
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:44,280
where unto I am appointed a preacher,

381
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:47,500
and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles,

382
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,520
for the which cause I also suffer these things,

383
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,280
nevertheless I am not ashamed,

384
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,400
for I know whom I have believed,

385
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,760
and am persuaded that he is able to keep that

386
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,720
which I have committed unto him against that day.

387
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,840
You know what Paul says as he's writing

388
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,840
to the believers in Philippi,

389
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,520
as he speaks about his call,

390
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,720
and understanding that God has a plan for his life,

391
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,800
he says this, he says that I follow after,

392
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,400
if that I may apprehend that for which also

393
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:19,120
I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.

394
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,080
God had a plan for Paul.

395
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,160
In the same text of scripture,

396
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,400
God reveals to us that he had a plan for Timothy.

397
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,360
In 2 Timothy 1 and verse number six,

398
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,959
notice what God says as Timothy is being written to him

399
00:21:30,959 --> 00:21:32,200
to the inspirational Holy Spirit of God

400
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,760
as Paul is writing this letter.

401
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,760
It says in verse number six of 2 Timothy 1,

402
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,360
wherefore I put thee in remembrance

403
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:41,700
that thou stir up the gift of God,

404
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,560
which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.

405
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,980
Now understand that this is not that Paul

406
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:49,000
somehow supernaturally put this gift on him

407
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,240
through the laying of his hands,

408
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,000
but it was a very common thing you've heard

409
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,360
and you've read about somebody laying hands

410
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:58,520
on somebody and that recognition of God

411
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,600
calling and equipping an individual.

412
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,180
It's God who does the work,

413
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:04,680
but Paul says that through this process,

414
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,240
but he says listen, remember that God

415
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,260
has a plan for your life.

416
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:11,339
Stir up the gift of God which is in thee.

417
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:16,139
This morning, I believe it's obvious,

418
00:22:16,139 --> 00:22:18,940
and we get the point as we look at all of these examples

419
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:23,660
this morning that God had a specific plan for their lives.

420
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:25,220
But here's really the question.

421
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,900
Does God have a plan for my life?

422
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:33,880
Or is it just that he had a plan for the saints of old?

423
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:37,339
See, if we're not careful, we can go to God's word

424
00:22:37,339 --> 00:22:40,139
and we can say, well yeah, God used that person.

425
00:22:40,139 --> 00:22:41,540
God had a plan for that person

426
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:43,020
and God had a plan for that person.

427
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,660
I read about their life and yeah,

428
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,619
we can read about Moses and Aaron and Bezalel

429
00:22:46,619 --> 00:22:48,460
and Joshua and David and so on and so forth

430
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:51,520
and we could list a whole host of other Bible characters

431
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,119
this morning that God used in a specific way.

432
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:56,360
But I would submit to you this morning

433
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,000
that God has a plan for you as an individual.

434
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,199
God knows you.

435
00:23:00,199 --> 00:23:04,119
He knows you by name and has a plan for you.

436
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:07,020
And the plan that God has for you,

437
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,680
let me say it this way, can only be fulfilled by you.

438
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:12,919
God has a plan for you.

439
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:18,880
And he desires that you would serve him with your life.

440
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:22,199
And as you yield to his plan for your life,

441
00:23:22,199 --> 00:23:26,080
he will use you as an individual

442
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,440
to be part of the corporate

443
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:33,440
to bring to pass his ultimate master plan.

444
00:23:33,479 --> 00:23:34,720
Now that's amazing to me.

445
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,320
That's our great God.

446
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,740
He's got a plan for your life.

447
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,040
Look at what the Bible says again

448
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,919
in Ephesians 2 in verse number 10.

449
00:23:44,979 --> 00:23:46,520
We've read it already.

450
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,600
We're gonna look at another verse of scripture

451
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,639
and then get into a couple of thoughts this morning.

452
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:54,639
Very lengthy introduction this morning

453
00:23:54,639 --> 00:23:56,720
in order to prove and to understand

454
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,800
that God has a plan for our lives.

455
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:03,240
Again, as we referenced in Ephesians chapter number two,

456
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,199
Paul is obviously under the inspiration

457
00:24:05,199 --> 00:24:06,040
of the Holy Spirit of God,

458
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,639
writing to those who have been saved.

459
00:24:07,639 --> 00:24:09,020
If you've been saved this morning,

460
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:12,000
you know the Lord Jesus Christ is your personal savior

461
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,960
and you've accepted that free gift of eternal life.

462
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,480
The Bible says in verse number 10,

463
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,839
for we are his workmanship.

464
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,820
That word we is so important

465
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:28,279
because it's Paul writing to a group of believers

466
00:24:28,279 --> 00:24:32,080
and he's saying that we are his workmanship

467
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,760
and God had a plan for their lives.

468
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,760
Notice over in the book of Philippians in chapter number one,

469
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:40,880
Philippians chapter number one in verse number six,

470
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,880
Paul is writing to a different church here,

471
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,559
the church at Philippi.

472
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:47,640
And as he's writing to this church at Philippi,

473
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:52,640
he's rejoicing at the introduction of the letter

474
00:24:52,959 --> 00:24:55,720
and understanding that this church is an established church

475
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,839
but he's saying I thank my God upon every remembrance of you

476
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:01,279
and he's letting them know how he's praying for them

477
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:02,679
and all of these things.

478
00:25:02,679 --> 00:25:05,279
But I want you to notice what Paul says in verse number six.

479
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:08,600
He says being confident of this very thing

480
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:14,600
that he, God, which hath begun a good work in you

481
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:17,839
will perform it, that good work,

482
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:20,820
until the day of Jesus Christ.

483
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:27,880
Paul was confident that these believers in Philippi,

484
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:32,040
that just as God had a plan for his life individually,

485
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:35,679
just as God had a plan for the believers in Ephesus,

486
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:38,380
that Paul was confident that God had a plan

487
00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:40,220
for the people at Philippi,

488
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:43,260
for those believers that had placed their faith and trust

489
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:44,700
in the Lord Jesus Christ.

490
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:48,179
He says I'm confident that God is going to,

491
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:50,500
he started that work but he's gonna bring that work

492
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,660
to completion.

493
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:55,860
What a blessing to consider this morning

494
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:59,179
that God has a plan for us as individuals.

495
00:25:59,179 --> 00:26:01,080
See, so many people today go through life

496
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,019
and they ask this question, why am I here?

497
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:04,000
What's my purpose?

498
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,140
What's my point?

499
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:08,739
God has a plan for us.

500
00:26:08,739 --> 00:26:11,899
His plan for all mankind is that they'd be saved.

501
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:18,779
After salvation, his plan for all of his children

502
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:21,339
is that they would grow in Christ.

503
00:26:21,339 --> 00:26:23,059
We're talking about the plan that God has for us

504
00:26:23,059 --> 00:26:26,000
in a certain sense, there are many aspects of that plan

505
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,700
that are consistent for each of us.

506
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:30,619
He wants each of us to grow in grace

507
00:26:30,619 --> 00:26:33,179
and knowledge of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.

508
00:26:34,179 --> 00:26:37,339
But we find that he has an individual plan for our lives

509
00:26:37,339 --> 00:26:39,820
and as we understand that truth this morning,

510
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,660
simply two thoughts.

511
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,540
Number one, if you're taking notes,

512
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:47,260
finding God's plan for your life.

513
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:51,540
This is a question that so many people struggle with.

514
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:57,100
How do I find God's plan or God's will for my life?

515
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:00,059
Again, there are many things that are known

516
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:03,299
that are consistent for all of God's children.

517
00:27:03,299 --> 00:27:04,820
You'll read throughout the scriptures

518
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:09,339
where the Bible will say, this is the will of God, right?

519
00:27:09,339 --> 00:27:11,220
We're to give thanks in everything, right?

520
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:14,100
We're to certain things that we understand.

521
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,200
I've mentioned this, I said it last week

522
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,839
in our Family Sunday School class last week.

523
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:20,980
I said this, listen, there's some things

524
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:23,459
that we just simply don't need to pray about.

525
00:27:23,459 --> 00:27:24,519
What do you mean by that?

526
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:26,540
Well, when God says to do something,

527
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:28,179
we don't have to pray about whether we're gonna do it

528
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:30,380
or not, we just need to obey.

529
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:32,500
It's not a matter of say, well, I'm gonna pray about that.

530
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,820
No, you don't pray about obedience,

531
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:36,140
you just do what God said to do.

532
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:39,420
We speak this morning about this individual plan

533
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:42,700
that God has for our lives and we say, yes,

534
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:46,480
there's some revealed will of God for all of his people,

535
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,660
but what does God want for my life?

536
00:27:49,619 --> 00:27:51,700
What is God's plan for my life?

537
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:55,019
If I'm trying to find God's plan for my life,

538
00:27:55,019 --> 00:27:56,980
very simply this morning, I would say this.

539
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:00,040
Number one, we need to ask him, ask him.

540
00:28:01,459 --> 00:28:02,299
Why ask him?

541
00:28:02,299 --> 00:28:05,619
Because it's his plan for your life.

542
00:28:05,619 --> 00:28:06,940
You know how many people go through life saying,

543
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,519
this is my plan for my life?

544
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,700
You talk to people, hey, what are you going to do

545
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,519
with your life?

546
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:14,660
I was asked that question so many times

547
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:17,459
when I was entering into those years of high school,

548
00:28:17,459 --> 00:28:18,860
getting close to graduation.

549
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:20,019
What are you going to do?

550
00:28:20,019 --> 00:28:21,420
What is your plan?

551
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:23,839
And then I got saved as a senior in high school

552
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:27,080
and all of a sudden, my whole thought process changed

553
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,040
through the preaching of God's word

554
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,640
and through a man of God who'll be here

555
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,520
for our revival meeting, Palmer Sean,

556
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:36,320
who instructed me and helped me to get a perspective

557
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,280
that it's not about my plan for my life,

558
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:41,119
but it's about what God's plan is for my life.

559
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:42,840
And it doesn't matter what I want to do,

560
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,720
it matters what God wants to do in and through my life.

561
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,520
And here's the thing, if I delight myself in the Lord,

562
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,200
man, all of a sudden, what his plan is for me

563
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,960
is what I want to do.

564
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,960
It's what I most desire to do.

565
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,880
And so when I say, and it seems very obvious

566
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,640
and almost elementary to say,

567
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,320
I'm going to find God's plan for my life

568
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,739
and it starts by asking him,

569
00:29:03,739 --> 00:29:06,679
but look over in Acts chapter nine.

570
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:08,359
We talked already about the fact

571
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:10,799
and we referenced in 2 Timothy chapter number one

572
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:14,119
that Paul is referencing that God had a plan for him

573
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:16,799
individually and he's sharing that testimony.

574
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,400
But here in Acts chapter number nine

575
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,760
is where we meet the, or read the text of scripture

576
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,780
where Saul trusts Christ as his savior,

577
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:27,220
where Saul is born again.

578
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:30,640
We obviously refer to him often as Paul.

579
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,000
And, but we find here in this text

580
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,559
that this is the conversion of Paul

581
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:38,000
and his name is referenced here as being Saul.

582
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,919
But I want to draw your attention in verse number four,

583
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:43,799
the Bible says that he fell to the earth after what?

584
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:46,580
After this, the suddenly in verse number three,

585
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:48,880
there shined round about him a light from heaven.

586
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,720
So, so Saul falls to the earth.

587
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,039
He heard a voice saying, Saul, Saul,

588
00:29:54,039 --> 00:29:56,580
why persecutest thou me?

589
00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:00,000
And he, Saul said, who art thou Lord?

590
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,639
And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest, it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.

591
00:30:05,639 --> 00:30:11,560
And I want you to notice that it was in that moment that Saul trusted Christ as his Savior.

592
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:15,079
And look at the question that he asks immediately.

593
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:22,840
He trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?

594
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:28,000
It's a very simple question, but how important it is.

595
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,080
The Bible tells us that we have not because we ask not.

596
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,439
I understand that it continues that we have not because we ask amiss, there's two aspects

597
00:30:36,439 --> 00:30:37,439
of that.

598
00:30:37,439 --> 00:30:43,740
But you know, so many people today struggle with this idea of trying to find God's plan

599
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,520
for their lives.

600
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:49,200
But the reality is that they need to start by simply asking Him, God, what's your plan

601
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,200
for my life?

602
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,479
God, what do you want me to do?

603
00:30:53,479 --> 00:30:55,599
How can I serve you, Lord?

604
00:30:55,599 --> 00:30:58,720
Because God has a plan for you.

605
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:04,639
And in order for us to understand the significance of this truth this morning of how great our

606
00:31:04,639 --> 00:31:11,639
God is and that He has a plan for each individual, that we simply ask Him as Paul did, Lord,

607
00:31:11,639 --> 00:31:13,879
what would thou have me to do?

608
00:31:13,879 --> 00:31:15,639
What would thou have me to do?

609
00:31:15,639 --> 00:31:20,480
It's interesting as you look through this chapter that in verse number 15, the Bible

610
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,160
says, but the Lord said unto him, go thy way.

611
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:28,639
He's speaking to Ananias here and it says, for he is a chosen vessel unto me to bear

612
00:31:28,639 --> 00:31:32,879
my name before the Gentiles and kings and the children of Israel, for I will show him

613
00:31:32,879 --> 00:31:36,160
how great things he must suffer for my name's sake.

614
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:40,279
You know, when you read that verse in verse 15 that it says that he shall bear my name

615
00:31:40,279 --> 00:31:45,639
before the Gentiles and kings and the children of Israel, that was God's plan for Paul and

616
00:31:45,639 --> 00:31:48,239
God did that through Paul.

617
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,239
Why?

618
00:31:49,239 --> 00:31:52,720
Because Paul said for me to live as Christ.

619
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,400
He asked and then he submitted to.

620
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:02,239
It's important that when we ask God what His plan is for our life, that we're not asking

621
00:32:02,239 --> 00:32:06,559
God so that we can determine if that's something I want to sign up for.

622
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:09,279
You understand what I'm saying?

623
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:10,279
No, no.

624
00:32:10,279 --> 00:32:18,399
We're asking God with a heart of obedience and submission that as God reveals to us and

625
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:24,960
answers to us what His plan is for our life, that we say, yes sir.

626
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:29,740
Why callest thou me Lord, Lord, and do not the things that I say?

627
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:34,919
And we find this morning that as we are seeking to find God's plan for our life, we look and

628
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:40,600
we've given example after example this morning to prove without any shadow of a doubt that

629
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:46,919
God has a plan for individuals and as God has that plan for individuals and they vary

630
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:52,279
from person to person but ultimately they're bringing to fulfillment His perfect will and

631
00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:58,399
His master plan, that we simply ask God, what is it that you want me to do?

632
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:04,880
And as we wait on the Lord and we listen for His direction in our lives, that we have that

633
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,119
heart attitude of submission to His plan.

634
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:12,360
Let me say this this morning, that God's plan for your life is better than your plan for

635
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:15,559
your life.

636
00:33:15,559 --> 00:33:18,800
God's plan for your life is far better than your plan for your life.

637
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:23,199
You say, well you haven't heard my plan.

638
00:33:23,199 --> 00:33:26,639
God's plan for your life is better than your plan for your life.

639
00:33:26,639 --> 00:33:27,639
Guaranteed.

640
00:33:27,639 --> 00:33:28,639
Why?

641
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:31,639
Because God knows everything.

642
00:33:31,639 --> 00:33:34,880
God has this master plan, He's going to bring all these things to pass and God says I have

643
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,679
a plan for your life.

644
00:33:36,679 --> 00:33:41,000
Notice that as we find God's plan for our life that we recognize this morning that it

645
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:46,600
is God who has called us as we read there in 2 Timothy chapter 1 but it's also God who

646
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,559
equips us.

647
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:54,600
It's an amazing truth that God calls us, He has this plan for our lives, He calls us,

648
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:59,559
He will reveal it to us as we ask Him, as we seek His face.

649
00:33:59,559 --> 00:34:01,520
God, what is it that you want me to do?

650
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:08,440
What wilt thou have me to do that God reveals it to us but then God equips us to do what

651
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,720
He's called us to do.

652
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:16,000
I remember when I first realized that God was calling me to preach, I can't.

653
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,279
Honestly that was my first answer, I can't.

654
00:34:21,279 --> 00:34:24,880
Absolutely terrified of the idea of public speaking.

655
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:28,799
You sit here and say yeah right, I promise you.

656
00:34:28,799 --> 00:34:35,040
Absolutely terrified to stand in front of people and talk.

657
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:40,119
Felt like Moses, God are you sure?

658
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,320
God equips you.

659
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:45,040
I'm not saying I'm a great preacher or any of that sort of thing but I'm saying God equips

660
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:51,959
you as you submit and you let God work, God equips you.

661
00:34:51,959 --> 00:34:55,880
We look at the truth in God's Word, look at Romans chapter 12.

662
00:34:55,880 --> 00:35:04,600
In Romans chapter 12 the Bible gives us here in these verses of Scripture this truth about

663
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:12,239
how God equips us and I'm so thankful for God's equipping.

664
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:18,760
In Romans chapter 12 beginning in verse number 3, the Bible says, for I say through the grace

665
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:24,000
given unto me to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he

666
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:32,480
ought to think, but to think soberly according as God hath dealt to every man the measure

667
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,480
of faith.

668
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:39,920
Notice in verse number 4, for as we have many members in one body and all members have not

669
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,559
the same office.

670
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:46,679
God's individual plan for each of us.

671
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:54,440
Notice in verse number 5, so we being many are one body in Christ and every one members

672
00:35:54,440 --> 00:36:00,920
one of another, having then gifts differing according to the grace.

673
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:07,720
Notice these words, that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy, whether

674
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:13,200
according to the proportion of faith, or ministry, let us wait on our ministering, or he that

675
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:17,399
teacheth on teaching, or he that exhorteth on exhortation, he that giveth, let him do

676
00:36:17,399 --> 00:36:22,480
it with simplicity, he that ruleth with diligence, he that showeth mercy with cheerfulness.

677
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,799
The Bible tells us in the book of 1 Corinthians that God, the Holy Spirit, that he gives the

678
00:36:26,799 --> 00:36:30,959
gift to every man as he will.

679
00:36:30,959 --> 00:36:37,760
It's God's plan for our lives individually, yes a corporate, the body of Christ.

680
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:42,480
We can think about a local church, we can think about the universal church and understand

681
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:49,839
that God's plan for the ages and God's plan globally, but he says that we have, yes every

682
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:55,839
one of us, we have this gift and it differs one from another.

683
00:36:55,880 --> 00:37:01,320
Some people have multiple gifts that God has given them.

684
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:06,600
They're responsible for those gifts that God has given them and as we discover, we're finding

685
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:11,200
what God's plan is for our life, we're understanding that he's called us, but he's also equipped

686
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:17,859
us and he's given us the ability, notice in 1 Peter chapter number 4, the Bible speaks

687
00:37:17,859 --> 00:37:25,239
about this truth of ministering and having received this gift and it's so precious as

688
00:37:25,239 --> 00:37:31,279
we look at this truth this morning that no child of God, anyone that's been born again

689
00:37:31,279 --> 00:37:36,160
that's been saved by the blood of Christ, no one can sit back on the sidelines and say

690
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,600
nope, God didn't give me a gift, he has no plan for my life.

691
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,600
You know why I can say that?

692
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:50,519
Biblically, God says that he's given every man, every child of God, a gift.

693
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:51,519
Every single person.

694
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,040
The Bible says that's trust in Christ.

695
00:37:54,040 --> 00:38:00,760
Notice in verse number 10 of 1 Peter 4, as every man hath received the gift, even so

696
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:04,359
minister the same one to another.

697
00:38:04,359 --> 00:38:07,760
Notice I mentioned this in Sunday school this morning, this verse of scripture, as good

698
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:13,079
stewards of the manifold grace of God.

699
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:18,320
If any men speak, let them speak as the oracles of God.

700
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,320
Notice the difference.

701
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:24,720
If any men minister, so we have differing gifts, but every man has one, every child

702
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,720
of God has one.

703
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:29,380
He says if any men minister, let them do it as of the ability of which God giveth.

704
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:35,479
Notice this, and I say this by way of introduction this morning, that God in all things may be

705
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:42,539
glorified through Jesus Christ to whom be praise and dominion forever and ever, amen.

706
00:38:42,539 --> 00:38:47,840
As every person does what they're supposed to do, as Moses did what he was supposed to

707
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:52,400
do, and as Aaron was doing what he's supposed to do, and as Bezalel and Aholiab did what

708
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:57,280
they were supposed to do, there's a tabernacle that's able to be reared up where sacrifices

709
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:03,559
can be brought, where God's glory can be known, where worship takes place.

710
00:39:03,559 --> 00:39:08,679
This morning, as we each understand that God has a plan for our lives individually and

711
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:13,919
it reminds us, it helps us to understand how great our God is, that he'd use each and every

712
00:39:13,919 --> 00:39:19,880
one of us, but ultimately it's so that he would be glorified and so that his plan would

713
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,280
come to pass.

714
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:27,280
It's not so that any one of us individually could receive some level of recognition, look

715
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:32,940
at that person, look at this person, look at what the, no, no, it's the grace of God.

716
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:40,840
It's God who has equipped us and he's equipped us so that we could do his work for his glory.

717
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,719
Do we find God's plan for our life?

718
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:48,659
Ask him, ask him.

719
00:39:48,659 --> 00:39:52,000
God is such a gracious God.

720
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,919
He's wonderful.

721
00:39:54,919 --> 00:40:00,080
He says, he uses the comparison in Matthew 6 and 7.

722
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:03,360
when he talks about various things there,

723
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:08,140
with regard to us and how we, as evil people,

724
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:10,280
that we know how to give good gifts.

725
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:13,620
Let us see this in verse number seven of Matthew seven.

726
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,240
I wasn't gonna go here,

727
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,320
but I think it's appropriate for us to do it.

728
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,520
Look at Matthew seven in verse number seven.

729
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,700
Because it begins with asking.

730
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,560
Ask, and it shall be given unto you.

731
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,720
Seek, and ye shall find.

732
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,560
Knock, and it shall be opened unto you.

733
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,480
For everyone that asketh receiveth,

734
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,920
and he that seeketh findeth,

735
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:39,680
and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.

736
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,480
Or what man is there of you whom, if his son ask bread,

737
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,720
will he give him a stone?

738
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,800
If he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?

739
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,460
If ye then, being evil,

740
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:54,180
know how to give good gifts unto your children,

741
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:56,640
how much more shall your Father, which is in heaven,

742
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,300
give good things to them that ask him?

743
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,840
Listen, if God has a plan for your life,

744
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:04,960
and I believe this morning, biblically, he does,

745
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,160
and you ask him, he's gonna reveal it to you.

746
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,980
You come to him with that submissive, obedient heart.

747
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:17,040
God, I just wanna know what you want me to do with my life.

748
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,120
Because my life, Lord, as the songwriter said,

749
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,280
is yours to control.

750
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,640
I've been bought with a price, and I wanna glorify you.

751
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,960
Lord, what is your plan for my life?

752
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:32,000
What will thou have me to do?

753
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,560
We find God's plan for our life,

754
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,560
but then I would say, number two,

755
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:38,680
this morning, fulfilling God's plan for your life.

756
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:42,640
It's a very basic statement this morning,

757
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,880
but you will never fulfill God's plan for your life

758
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:48,940
if you don't first find God's plan for your life.

759
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,960
You say, well, that's pretty obvious.

760
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:54,060
You know how many people miss the obvious?

761
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:57,420
You're not gonna fulfill what you don't know.

762
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:02,620
You have to find it, and then you must live to fulfill it.

763
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:06,420
Use Paul as an example this morning again.

764
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:10,500
Paul knew what God's plan was for his life.

765
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,340
Why did he know?

766
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:16,340
Because he said, what will thou have me to do?

767
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:19,020
God answered that question and revealed to him

768
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:20,540
what his plan was for his life,

769
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:23,900
and so Paul then had a desire to do what he knew

770
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,980
what God called him to do.

771
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:29,080
He had a desire to fulfill that plan in his life.

772
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,780
Look at Acts chapter 20, and notice what Paul says

773
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:35,780
in his testimony as he's sharing and having revealed to us

774
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:37,580
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God

775
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:40,580
what his heart attitude was in desiring

776
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:44,340
to fulfill God's plan for his life.

777
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:46,440
By the way, isn't it better to fulfill God's plan

778
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:49,340
for your life than to fulfill your own plan for your life?

779
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:52,820
To be able to say, as Paul says at the end of his life

780
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:55,180
in 2 Timothy 4, I have finished.

781
00:42:56,300 --> 00:43:01,180
I finished, I've completed what God wanted me to do.

782
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:02,320
And it's wonderful.

783
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:06,260
In Acts chapter 20, notice, before he can ever say

784
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:07,980
in 2 Timothy 4 that he's finished,

785
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:10,500
he says in Acts chapter 20 and verse number 24,

786
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,060
but none of these things move me,

787
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:14,280
neither count I my life dear unto myself

788
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,660
so that I might finish my course with joy.

789
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:18,740
And the ministry, notice what he says,

790
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:22,980
which I have received of the Lord Jesus

791
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:26,420
to testify the gospel of the grace of God.

792
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:29,100
Paul would say this to those that he's writing to

793
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:31,500
in the region of Galatia, you don't need to turn there,

794
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:33,220
but in Galatians chapter number one,

795
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:36,660
he would tell these churches in the region of Galatia

796
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:38,820
that were reached during his first missionary journey.

797
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:40,940
He says in verse number 11 of Galatians one,

798
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:43,140
but I certify you, brethren, that the gospel

799
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:45,820
which was preached of me is not after man,

800
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:47,180
for I neither received it of man,

801
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:48,180
neither was I taught it,

802
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:50,500
but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.

803
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,260
Paul was not in the ministry

804
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:54,660
because some man sent him into the ministry.

805
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,340
God called him, and he said,

806
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:01,000
I want to fulfill what God's plan is for my life.

807
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:06,240
How many parents have plans for their children?

808
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:10,540
You better make sure your plan aligns with God's plan.

809
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:15,540
I'd never, never would I want to be held accountable

810
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:19,660
for having a plan for my children

811
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:21,620
that prevented them from knowing

812
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:25,380
and doing God's plan for their lives.

813
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:26,220
Never in a million years,

814
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:27,220
I don't want to be in that position.

815
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:29,220
I don't want to be accountable for that.

816
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:31,840
I want my children to know what God wants them to do.

817
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,460
I want to help try to facilitate that

818
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:35,780
and to encourage that and to help them

819
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:38,340
and guide them in any way that God would use me to do it,

820
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:41,980
but they got to know what God's plan is for their life.

821
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:44,680
Joseph, not often now, but when he was younger,

822
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,400
was asked repeatedly,

823
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,840
are you going to be a preacher like your daddy?

824
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:50,260
You know what I taught Joseph?

825
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:51,840
You can't be a preacher like your daddy

826
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:54,560
unless God calls you to be a preacher.

827
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,440
It's not just something you decide to do.

828
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:01,320
No, it's God's plan.

829
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:03,300
By the way, if you think you just want to decide

830
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,080
to be a preacher and God didn't call you,

831
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:07,240
you're probably not going to last very long.

832
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:11,400
And I don't say that for any kind of sympathy

833
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:14,840
or it's just you got to know what God wants you to do.

834
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,500
And Paul, he says, none of these things move me.

835
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:24,200
Neither count I my life dear unto myself, why?

836
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:29,200
Because I want to fulfill what God has for me to do,

837
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:31,640
his plan for me.

838
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:32,900
He's revealed it to me, why?

839
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:36,200
Because I asked him, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?

840
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:40,280
And now my gaze is fixed and I am absolutely set

841
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:44,180
on doing what God has called me to do.

842
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,400
We find that Paul is able to say,

843
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:51,820
as I referenced already in 2 Timothy 4, that he's finished.

844
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:52,760
He's finished his course.

845
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:55,200
He's done what God's called him to do.

846
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,920
This morning though, for you and for me,

847
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,360
I want to draw your attention as we look at a couple

848
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:03,000
of verses in closing to Colossians 4.

849
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:06,160
Colossians chapter 4.

850
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,720
See, Paul wasn't just concerned

851
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:12,720
about fulfilling the plan that God had for his own life.

852
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:17,480
The Apostle Paul was interested in other servants of God,

853
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:22,040
people of God, fulfilling what God's plan was for their life.

854
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:24,520
And in Colossians chapter 4, we see this charge

855
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:28,000
that is given to Archippus that's mentioned here

856
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,360
in verse number 17.

857
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:31,760
And we find that this charge is given,

858
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:34,360
and we find that again, it summarizes,

859
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:37,680
help us to understand that God has an individual plan

860
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:39,360
for each of us.

861
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:41,680
Most of us this morning, if we were to ask as you came in,

862
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:45,160
who's Archippus, who are you talking about?

863
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:49,600
There's not, it's not like Paul or David.

864
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,840
He's mentioned here, and notice what the Bible says,

865
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:54,320
and say to Archippus, take heed to the ministry

866
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:57,220
which thou hast received from what?

867
00:46:57,220 --> 00:47:02,220
In the Lord, from the Lord, that thou fulfill it.

868
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:07,280
See, Paul understood that God had a plan

869
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:11,720
for this man Archippus, that God had given him a ministry.

870
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:16,040
And God uses Paul to try to give this charge

871
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:19,840
and to try to encourage this saint of God

872
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:24,840
that he would fulfill God's plan for his life individually.

873
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,560
Now understand, as I mentioned about finding God's plan

874
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:32,360
for my life, that he calls me and he equips me,

875
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:35,080
and then as I'm seeking to fulfill God's plan for my life,

876
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:37,960
he's there and he's enabling us.

877
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:42,960
It's so awesome that he equips us for what the plan is,

878
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:47,880
and then he enables us as we're seeking to fulfill

879
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,480
the work that he's given us to do,

880
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:52,400
and he's enabling us to do it, and he's there,

881
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,360
and his spirit gives us the strength

882
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:58,400
and the power that we need as we're seeking

883
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,820
to fulfill the ministry that he's given us to do.

884
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:02,840
And then this is an amazing truth,

885
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:07,080
as we finish our lives and as we fulfill the role

886
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:09,520
that God has given us to do, the plan that God gives us,

887
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:10,360
you know what he does?

888
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:11,960
He rewards us.

889
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:17,040
He rewards us, so he's the one that called us,

890
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:20,040
he's the one that equips us, and then he enables us,

891
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:23,520
and then as we do it, he rewards us.

892
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:24,800
It's absolutely amazing.

893
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,520
How am I gonna fulfill it?

894
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:31,480
What am I gonna do?

895
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:35,640
You say, I'm struggling with finding it.

896
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:39,400
Once you find it, you gotta have that fixed perspective

897
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,799
that I'm gonna finish, I'm gonna fulfill

898
00:48:41,799 --> 00:48:42,920
what God's given me to do.

899
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,239
Look at Hebrews 12 in closing.

900
00:48:45,239 --> 00:48:47,720
Verses that we're familiar with, no doubt.

901
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:52,280
In Hebrews chapter 12,

902
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:05,640
it's interesting for in chapter number 11,

903
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:08,360
if you're familiar with Hebrews 11,

904
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:10,100
we often will refer to the chapter

905
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:12,760
as being the hall of faith chapter.

906
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:14,640
And as you look at Hebrews chapter 11,

907
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:18,119
you'll read of those saints of old,

908
00:49:18,119 --> 00:49:20,799
those heroes of the faith that sometimes we refer to them

909
00:49:20,799 --> 00:49:23,440
as that by faith, this person did this,

910
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,059
and by faith, this person did that.

911
00:49:25,059 --> 00:49:27,400
I would say to you that as you look at Hebrews 11,

912
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:28,239
you know what it was?

913
00:49:28,239 --> 00:49:31,080
It was individuals fulfilling God's plan

914
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:33,880
that God had for their lives.

915
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:35,559
That's Hebrews 11.

916
00:49:35,559 --> 00:49:38,239
So then Hebrews 12, it says this,

917
00:49:38,239 --> 00:49:42,840
wherefore, seeing we also are compassed about

918
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:45,720
with so great a cloud of witnesses,

919
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:48,320
let us lay aside every weight,

920
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:51,320
and the sin which does so easily beset us,

921
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:56,320
notice what he says, and let us run with patience

922
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,320
the race that is before us.

923
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:00,160
So we can.

924
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:05,760
of those saints of old that had fulfilled the plan that God had for their lives. God

925
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:12,080
revealed what His plan was for them, and they fulfilled the plan that God had for their

926
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:19,000
lives. But what about us? Paul says, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which

927
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:24,400
doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us. Notice

928
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:32,680
the key in verse two, looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, who

929
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:37,160
for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set

930
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:42,720
down at the right hand of the throne of God. For consider Him that endured such contradiction

931
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:49,520
of sinners against Himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds. I don't want to be

932
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:56,160
wearied and faintish. I want to fulfill, but I've got to keep my eyes on Jesus. It's amazing

933
00:50:56,160 --> 00:51:05,860
to me. I look at the messages that God placed upon my heart to deliver today, and it's interesting

934
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:11,340
how they're all connected. If you were in the family Sunday school this morning, Samuel,

935
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:18,280
he judged Israel all the days of his life. God had a plan for his life, and Samuel fulfilled

936
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:23,920
God's plan for his life. He had a testimony of faithfully doing what God called him to

937
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:28,080
do. This evening, we're going to look at a passage of Scripture that I hope would be

938
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:32,960
an encouragement to you as we think about our own testimonies. And sandwiched between

939
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:38,880
those two thoughts is this truth this morning, this biblical truth, that God has a plan for

940
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:48,120
our lives. And I must come to the place where I say, I want to know. Again, God has a plan

941
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:52,320
for all people of all times to be saved. We dealt with it last week, the plan of redemption.

942
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:59,400
But if you've been saved this morning, God has a plan for your life as an individual.

943
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:06,520
How do I find it? Ask Him. With a heart attitude of obedience and submission. God, what wilt

944
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:15,600
thou have me to do? And as He reveals that to us, and as He equips us for it, we seek

945
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:23,680
to fulfill through His enablement. And Paul, after he makes that statement in 2 Timothy

946
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:29,200
4 about finishing his course, he says this in verse number 8, henceforth there is laid

947
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:35,280
up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give

948
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:43,240
me at that day. Not to me only, but unto all them also that love is appearing. He'll reward

949
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:48,960
us for doing what He's called us to do, what He's equipped us to do. This morning, child

950
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:56,800
of God, I hope that you recognize God's greatness through the truth that He has a plan for His

951
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:03,360
individual children. But I hope this morning that we're convicted of, God, what's your

952
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:09,760
plan for my life? If you don't know, man, ask God to show it to you. Because you're

953
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:14,560
never gonna fulfill what God's plan is for your life until you find it. It's gonna be

954
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:21,680
spinning your wheels. You ever hear that term floundering around? Right? Spinning your wheels.

955
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:28,080
Sitting in a rocking chair, keeping you busy but not getting anywhere. Find God's plan

956
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:33,160
for your life. Know that He has a plan for your life. Find it. And then God, help me

957
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:38,440
to fulfill your plan for my life. Why? Because I wanna please you. Let's pray together. Father,

958
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:43,120
we love you. Thank you for loving us. Thank you for your word. Lord, we looked at so many

959
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:53,920
examples this morning of those saints of old, if you will, that you used. You had a plan

960
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:59,600
for their lives and you revealed it to them and they fulfilled and you were glorified

961
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:09,520
and you worked and your plan was accomplished. And God, I pray that today, in 2023, that

962
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:19,440
we would acknowledge that we are your workmanship and that you have a plan for us as individuals.

963
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:29,120
God, I pray for those that have already found your plan for their lives. God, you'd help

964
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:37,080
them to fulfill it. Help them to be faithful. Faithful unto death. Keeping their eyes on

965
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:42,080
Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith. Maybe this morning there's some that have

966
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:46,480
not yet gotten to that point where they've actually found, discovered what your plan

967
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:52,040
is for their life. Maybe there's some that have been saved that quite honestly they would

968
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:56,840
just say, I didn't even know that God had a plan for me. God, I pray that you'd help

969
00:54:56,840 --> 00:55:04,400
them to seek your face diligently and earnestly. That God, you would reveal to them your plan

970
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:10,880
for their lives and they would fulfill it. God, if there's one that's not been saved,

971
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:15,520
that's in our midst today or tuned in via live stream, they've never trusted Christ

972
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:21,400
as their Savior, I pray that today they would get that settled. They would trust Christ,

973
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:29,920
they would be redeemed. I pray, Lord, that in these few moments of invitation as we have

974
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:35,680
an opportunity to respond to you, Lord, I pray that you'd help us to be doers of the

975
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:42,920
word and not hearers only. Help us once again to stand in awe of how great you are through

976
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:47,560
this truth that you have a plan for us as individuals. Ultimately to bring glory to

977
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:54,160
yourself and to fulfill your master plan, would you move and work as only you can? For

978
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:58,200
it's in Christ's name we pray. Would you stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.
