00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
He is Lord, He is God.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Ephesians chapter number 2, Ephesians chapter number 2 this morning,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and thankful for God's word, thankful for the instruction that He gives us.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I'm thankful that He reveals to us His greatness,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and we've been on the theme all year long, great is the Lord,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and greatly to be praised, and we continue to look at what it is that we would,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
or why it is that we would say that God is great.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I believe this morning that all of us probably would agree,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and we would say yes, God is great, but why is God great?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
We've looked at a number of things this year as we've studied through His word,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and on a quest, if you will, to discover God's greatness,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and then as we close out this calendar year,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
we will transition from discovering God's greatness to declaring God's greatness,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and as we are aware of the very truth that our God is great,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
we need to let others know how great our God is.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
There are so many people that we come in contact with on a regular basis

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
that simply do not know how great our God is,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and how are they going to find out if we don't tell them,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and we'll transition to that phase of the series, if you will, near the end of the year,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
but this morning as we look at Ephesians chapter number 2,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
we'll be reminded that last week we examined God's greatness,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and we said He's great because He has a great plan of redemption.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
We talked about that plan of redemption and the reason that it was required,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
but then we talked about the fact that God's plan of redemption reaches all people

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
of all times, and we sang this morning, whosoever will,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and I'm thankful that you can go anywhere around the world and you can preach the gospel

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
and you can say, based on the authority of God's word,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
that Jesus died for them so that they could have eternal life,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and a free gift of salvation, and what a wonderful true blessing that is.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
And we find that as we are understanding

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
of the truth that God has a plan of redemption, we continue

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
and understand as we look at the text of scripture this morning

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
that the believers here in Ephesus, they're being reminded of God's grace

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
and of God's mercy, His great love, as Paul is speaking

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
to them about the redemption, but then he tells them this in verse number 10

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
that they and we are His workmanship.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
And we find that as we look at this portion of scripture,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and yes, we understand that God is great because He has a great plan of redemption

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
that reaches all people of all times, but I would say

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
that God is great this morning because God has a plan

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
for each individual believer. And you begin to think about

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
the plan that God has for us as individuals, those who have

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
responded in faith and trusted the Lord Jesus Christ

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
as their personal Savior, God has a plan for your life.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
And I want to encourage us to understand this morning that

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
the great God, the God that they just sang about, the God that we

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
are worshiping today, that we're singing about, seeking to exalt and magnify,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
that He's the God of the universe, but He has a plan

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
for your life, individually. And He has a plan for every

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
single believer throughout the ages. He has

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
a plan for their lives. And that is such an encouragement to me.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
I believe that it's a fascinating truth of God's Word

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
that He has a plan for me. And you say, who am I, right?

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
We're just really a speck of nothing when you think about the

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
big picture, but God loves us so much that He saved us.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
But after He saved us, He says, now I have a plan for your life.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
And here's what's amazing about God's plan for our life, is God has an individual

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
plan for each and every single one of us, and as we fulfill

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
God's plan for our lives, the ultimate purpose is to bring glory

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
to Him and to complete His master plan.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Now that's amazing when you think about God and His greatness

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
that He has a plan that will come to pass

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
and then He includes us. Sometimes we can be

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
hard-headed, right? We can not do...

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
But God says, I have a plan for you, for your life, and I want to use you.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Notice in the text of Scripture, I said that as Paul is

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
teaching and ministering to these people in Ephesus, He reminds them of their

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
salvation. He begins in verse number 1, and you hath He quickened who were

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
dead in trespasses and sins. And I'm thankful to be quickened,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
to be made alive, to be saved, to be born again by the blood of Jesus

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Christ. It says, wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
among whom also, notice it says, we all had our

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
conversation in times past in the lust of our flesh, fulfilling the desires

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
We all were in that same condition, but God, verse number

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
4, who is rich in mercy, for His great love wherewith He

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
us together with Christ by grace, ye are saved, and hath raised us

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
up together and made us to sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
that in the ages to come He might show the exceeding

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
riches of His grace and His kindness toward us through Christ Jesus,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
for by grace are ye saved through faith. And that not of yourselves, it is the

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
gift of God, not of works, lest any man should boast. And then notice verse number 10,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
the subject matter we'll be dealing with this morning, for we. Paul didn't

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
say for I, he didn't say for you, he said for we. Why?

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
God has a plan for each of us individually, for we

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
those that have been born again, those that are saved by the blood of Christ, for we

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
unto good works, which God hath

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
before ordained that we should walk

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
in them. Now understand very clearly this morning that though

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
He speaks about us being His workmanship and He says that we have been

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
created in Christ Jesus unto

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
good works, that you understand that though we're to walk in

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
this newness of life that He speaks of and we're to be involved

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
in doing these good works, it's not so that we can be saved

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
nor is it so that we can stay saved. I'm thankful that salvation

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
is entirely and completely dealt with

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
by Christ's substitutionary atonement on the cross of Calvary, His

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
death, burial, and glorious resurrection. It is finished.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
But I can't

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
keep it by my good works either. I am sealed

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
under the day of redemption according to Ephesians chapter 1. I am kept

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
by the power of God according to 1 Peter chapter 1. Jesus said in

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
chapter number 10 that my sheep hear my voice and I know them and I give unto them

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
eternal life and they shall never perish.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
And so I'm thankful this morning that the good works that are spoken of here

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
they don't save me and they don't keep me saved, but I am

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
God's workmanship. I am to do a work

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
for the Lord and as I begin to think about the fact that God

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
has a plan for me and for you as individuals, I believe

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
that this truth this morning reveals to us just how

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
great our God is. Think about it.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
I mean there's really not that many people that are gathered here this morning

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000
but there's no way that any one of us could individually

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
have a plan for each individual and bring it all to pass

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
and by the way every other believer around the globe.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
And not only for this moment in history

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
but for all of history. It's absolutely amazing

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
that God would use us and that God has a plan for our lives.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
As we begin to think about this truth and the title is from verse number 10, we are

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
his workmanship. I want you to consider some biblical examples this morning.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
We're going to go all the way back to the Old Testament, the book of Exodus and we're going to walk through and look at a few

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
verses of scripture this morning in order to give some biblical

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
examples to this truth that God has a plan for us

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
as individuals. Look at Exodus chapter number 3 if you will.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
In this portion of scripture even as I mentioned Exodus 3

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000
many of us will be familiar with the fact that we'll deal with Moses and many of us are

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
familiar with Moses and his place in God's

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
work and what God did in and through his life. But I want you to

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
see in Exodus chapter number 3 and really the first three examples that we're going to look

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000
at here from the book of Exodus is just an amazing truth as you see

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
them all come together and how God brings to pass

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
his work through these individuals. In verse number 10 in Exodus

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
3 the Bible says this, come now therefore and I will send

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000
thee unto Pharaoh that thou mayest bring

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Do you see that God is speaking personally, individually to

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Moses and he's saying to Moses, Moses I'm going to send

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
thee to Pharaoh and I'm going to send you to Pharaoh

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
for a purpose, for a work to bring my people out

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
of Egypt. Now we know that God's going to work miraculously and God's going to

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
do the work but God used a man, a man by the name of Moses

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
so think about Moses and think about the way in which God used him and obviously

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Aaron and you can look at the text of scripture and see Aaron being used as well but I want you to

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
forward if you will to Exodus chapter 28 much after

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
the Exodus Moses is here receiving instruction with regard

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
to the tabernacle that was to be constructed and

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
as you come to this portion of scripture in Exodus chapter 28 and I begin to

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.460
this picture in my mind come together to help me

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:06.199
understand how great our God is and how he has a plan

00:10:06.199 --> 00:10:08.000
for each of us as individuals.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.079
He used Moses, he called Moses by name.

00:10:11.079 --> 00:10:13.579
He's gonna use Moses to lead the children of Israel

00:10:13.579 --> 00:10:17.180
out of Egyptian bondage and we know that Moses,

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:19.379
if we could use this term this morning,

00:10:19.379 --> 00:10:22.979
would be the human leader for the nation of Israel.

00:10:22.979 --> 00:10:27.120
But we know that Moses was not going to do everything.

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.159
He couldn't do everything.

00:10:29.299 --> 00:10:31.219
But God had a plan for his people.

00:10:31.219 --> 00:10:32.500
So what does God do?

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:35.380
Well, God is telling Moses about this tabernacle.

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:37.060
He's giving him all of the instruction

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:38.500
with regard to the tabernacle.

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:40.259
You come to chapter 28 and you notice

00:10:40.259 --> 00:10:41.459
that the Bible says this,

00:10:41.459 --> 00:10:46.459
and take thou unto thee Aaron thy brother

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:49.500
and his sons with him from among the children of Israel

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:53.360
that he may minister unto me in the priest office,

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:57.700
even Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, Ithamar, Aaron's sons,

00:10:57.799 --> 00:11:00.799
and thou shalt make holy garments for Aaron thy brother

00:11:00.799 --> 00:11:03.119
for glory and for beauty.

00:11:03.119 --> 00:11:04.919
And we see that in these verses of scripture

00:11:04.919 --> 00:11:07.900
in Exodus chapter 28, as we could speak of

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:10.000
and reference the Aaronic priesthood

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.080
and understand that God is calling Aaron

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:16.519
and he has a plan for Aaron and for his sons.

00:11:16.519 --> 00:11:19.160
And we find that this plan for Aaron

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:23.480
is going to differ from the plan that God has for Moses.

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:25.440
God has a plan for Moses.

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.480
God has a plan for Aaron.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:29.260
But then I want you to look at a few more chapters

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.220
over in Exodus chapter 35,

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:35.080
because after there's kind of a parenthetical here

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:38.220
between Exodus chapter 28 and Exodus 35

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:40.540
and what happens is while Moses is up there on the mount,

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:42.660
the people of God defile themselves

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:46.580
and Moses comes down and then God reconfirms

00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:49.379
some things with Moses and we find there's repentance

00:11:49.379 --> 00:11:52.099
and what have you, but you come to Exodus chapter 35

00:11:52.099 --> 00:11:54.660
and I'm gonna draw your attention to verse number 30.

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:56.680
We've seen Moses, we've seen Aaron,

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:58.099
but now I want to introduce you to a man

00:11:58.099 --> 00:12:00.800
that you're familiar with perhaps for the name of Bezalel.

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:04.319
The Bible says in verse number 30 of Exodus 35,

00:12:04.319 --> 00:12:06.720
and Moses said unto the children of Israel,

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:10.839
see, the Lord hath called by name Bezalel,

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:16.279
the son of Uri, the son of Hur of the tribe of Judah.

00:12:16.279 --> 00:12:19.759
And he, that's speaking of God, hath filled him

00:12:19.759 --> 00:12:22.559
with the spirit of God and wisdom and understanding

00:12:22.559 --> 00:12:25.399
and a knowledge and all manner of workmanship

00:12:25.399 --> 00:12:28.479
and to devise curious works, to work in gold

00:12:28.479 --> 00:12:30.839
and in silver and in brass and in the cutting of stones

00:12:30.839 --> 00:12:33.119
to set them and in carving of wood

00:12:33.119 --> 00:12:35.440
to make any manner of cunning work.

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:38.360
And it's put in his heart, that's God putting it

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:41.360
in the heart of Bezalel, that he may teach

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:44.880
both he and Aholiab, the son of Ahissamack

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.520
of the tribe of Dan.

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:50.300
Then hath he, God, filled with wisdom of heart

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:52.919
to work all manner of work of the engraver

00:12:52.919 --> 00:12:55.639
of the cunning workman and of the embroiderer

00:12:55.639 --> 00:12:58.720
in blue and in purple and scarlet and in fine linen

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:01.639
and of the weaver, even of them that do any work

00:13:01.639 --> 00:13:05.479
and of those that devise cunning work.

00:13:05.479 --> 00:13:07.220
As I look at these first three examples

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:08.960
of Moses, Aaron, and Bezalel,

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:10.619
and you can include Aholiab there

00:13:10.619 --> 00:13:13.240
in this portion of scripture in Exodus chapter 35,

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:15.759
I find that God has a plan and a purpose

00:13:15.759 --> 00:13:18.639
for his people corporately to be able to worship

00:13:18.639 --> 00:13:20.520
at a place called the tabernacle.

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:22.600
And God would use Moses as the human leader

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:25.160
for the nation of Israel, but Moses could not do

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:29.399
all of the work by himself, and God has a plan for Moses.

00:13:29.399 --> 00:13:31.520
And then God in his infinite wisdom

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:34.960
and his omniscience and his omnipotence

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:38.080
and in his individual plan for his people,

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:40.940
he says I have and I've called by name Aaron

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:42.800
and I have Aaron for this task.

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:45.360
The priest had a very important role

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:48.639
in the process of worship at the tabernacle.

00:13:49.479 --> 00:13:52.639
You enter the tabernacle through one way.

00:13:52.639 --> 00:13:55.800
You first come to a thing, a piece of furniture

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.919
that's called the brazen altar,

00:13:57.919 --> 00:13:59.800
and at that brazen altar, the first thing

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:02.500
that has to be done is an offering has to be made.

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:05.800
How do we approach God?

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:07.580
Only through Jesus Christ.

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:08.759
There's only one way.

00:14:08.759 --> 00:14:11.119
There's only one entrance into the tabernacle,

00:14:11.119 --> 00:14:13.320
and as soon as you enter, there's a sacrifice

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:17.359
that's required, and we know that Jesus is our Passover,

00:14:17.359 --> 00:14:19.600
and what a great blessing that is.

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:22.399
But the priests, they ministered and they served

00:14:22.399 --> 00:14:24.760
and they were the ones that accepted

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:27.359
and processed the offering and all of those things,

00:14:27.359 --> 00:14:29.480
and God had a plan for them.

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:31.079
But then you think about all the furniture

00:14:31.079 --> 00:14:35.200
that had to be made, the curtains and the brazen altar

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:36.920
and the laver, and you could go through

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:40.019
all of the pieces of furniture that had to be created,

00:14:40.019 --> 00:14:42.720
that had to be assembled, and God says

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:45.640
I've called Bezalel for that task.

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:47.279
I have a plan for Bezalel.

00:14:48.119 --> 00:14:51.440
Now understand this morning that God had a plan for Moses

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:54.200
and that plan for Moses was an individual plan

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:57.339
that God had for that individual Moses.

00:14:57.339 --> 00:15:00.799
God had a plan for Aaron and God had a plan for Bezalel.

00:15:00.799 --> 00:15:04.040
Their plans differ, their roles differ,

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:06.839
but ultimately God would use each of them

00:15:06.839 --> 00:15:10.720
to bring to pass what he wanted to accomplish.

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:12.559
That's absolutely amazing to me.

00:15:12.559 --> 00:15:17.559
Fascinating that God would use us in that way.

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:20.799
Bezalel says no, I'm not gonna do it.

00:15:20.799 --> 00:15:23.559
That'd be disastrous, unfortunate.

00:15:23.559 --> 00:15:25.959
God would have to raise up somebody else,

00:15:25.959 --> 00:15:28.239
but I want you to see that as they fulfill

00:15:28.239 --> 00:15:31.079
their individual roles and as they do

00:15:31.079 --> 00:15:33.839
what they're supposed to do, that ultimately

00:15:33.839 --> 00:15:37.079
you get to the last chapter of the book of Exodus,

00:15:37.079 --> 00:15:41.679
in Exodus chapter number 40, and you read in that chapter

00:15:41.679 --> 00:15:45.799
that they did all that they were commanded to do.

00:15:45.799 --> 00:15:49.299
They finished the work that God had given them to do.

00:15:49.299 --> 00:15:51.679
The Bible tells us in verse number 33

00:15:51.679 --> 00:15:54.839
of Exodus chapter number 40, and he reared up the court

00:15:54.839 --> 00:15:57.480
around about the tabernacle and the altar

00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:59.679
and set up the hangings of the court gate.

00:15:59.679 --> 00:16:02.760
So Moses finished the work.

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:05.559
And as you begin to look forward and understand

00:16:05.559 --> 00:16:08.399
all that's taking place, yes, at the end of Exodus 40,

00:16:08.399 --> 00:16:10.480
the Bible tells us that God's presence,

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:12.239
the glory of the Lord, filled the tabernacle

00:16:12.239 --> 00:16:14.399
in verse number 35, and then you begin to think

00:16:14.399 --> 00:16:17.820
about the place of the tabernacle in Israel's history

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:20.839
as you go forward from this point forward

00:16:20.839 --> 00:16:23.359
and you see it being a place of worship.

00:16:24.799 --> 00:16:27.480
God used individuals.

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:29.519
We could speak this morning of Joshua.

00:16:29.519 --> 00:16:31.160
You could read in Deuteronomy 31.

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:32.799
We're gonna just reference some things.

00:16:32.799 --> 00:16:34.480
I'm not gonna even go to the passages

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:36.720
and read them this morning for sake of time,

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:38.880
but you could go to the book of Deuteronomy

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:41.079
in the 31st chapter in verses seven and eight,

00:16:41.079 --> 00:16:44.540
and you can read how that God called Joshua specifically.

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:45.380
Why?

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:47.079
Moses was going to die.

00:16:47.079 --> 00:16:50.320
Moses was not permitted to enter into the land of promise,

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.480
and God says, I've raised up Joshua,

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:54.920
and Joshua, this is your job.

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:57.839
Joshua, this is my plan for your life.

00:16:57.839 --> 00:17:01.279
Now, Joshua would be the human leader

00:17:01.279 --> 00:17:03.600
for the children of Israel, and you could look

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:06.820
and you could look at David, a man that was just out

00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:10.140
as a young teenager that was just tending to the flock

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:13.459
that when the man of God, Samuel, came to his hometown,

00:17:13.459 --> 00:17:16.119
that they didn't even call for David to come.

00:17:17.019 --> 00:17:19.720
Samuel was sent to that place in order to anoint

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:22.100
the one that would be the next king of Israel,

00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:25.059
and though they stood there and Samuel thought,

00:17:25.059 --> 00:17:28.459
for sure, this is the one, God said, no, not him,

00:17:28.459 --> 00:17:31.420
and one by one, the sons of Jesse passed by,

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:35.100
and God said, no, and God said, no, and God said, no,

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:38.660
and Samuel says, are there any others?

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:43.660
The youngest, and he comes, and God says, he's the one.

00:17:44.459 --> 00:17:46.640
You know how it's referenced this way?

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:49.700
You can read of that in 1 Samuel 16, but in Psalm 78,

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:52.859
I love how the psalmist references this.

00:17:52.859 --> 00:17:55.959
In Psalm 78, in verse number 70 through 72,

00:17:55.959 --> 00:17:59.980
the last three verses of Psalm 78, the Bible says this,

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:04.160
speaking of God that he chose David, also his servant,

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:06.760
and took him from the sheepfolds,

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:09.200
from following the ewes, great with young,

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:12.559
he brought him to feed Jacob, his people,

00:18:12.559 --> 00:18:15.959
and Israel, his inheritance, so he fed them

00:18:15.959 --> 00:18:18.000
according to the integrity of his heart,

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.079
and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.

00:18:23.519 --> 00:18:25.359
This morning, if you were to speak about David

00:18:25.359 --> 00:18:29.119
within a Jewish context, oh, how they would hold David

00:18:29.119 --> 00:18:31.640
in such high regard and high esteem,

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:34.320
and we, as we look back to the Old Testament,

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:36.440
we look at the nation of Israel, and we say often

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:40.520
that David is probably the greatest king that Israel had,

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:42.119
and you can look to that, and you can see,

00:18:42.119 --> 00:18:45.659
but God had a plan for his life as an individual.

00:18:45.659 --> 00:18:47.260
We can speak of Elijah.

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:49.919
We look at Elijah a couple of weeks ago,

00:18:49.919 --> 00:18:53.880
and looked at God's comfort and care for Elijah,

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:55.280
but Elijah's ready to give up.

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:57.640
He's ready to, he said, just, I'm ready to die.

00:18:58.640 --> 00:18:59.479
Why?

00:18:59.479 --> 00:19:01.960
I'm the only one, that was his perspective.

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:04.080
That's not bowed the knee to Baal.

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:05.919
Jezebel said, I'm gonna kill him.

00:19:05.919 --> 00:19:06.960
That's what happened.

00:19:08.159 --> 00:19:09.479
You know what God does?

00:19:10.599 --> 00:19:14.460
God comes to Elijah and says, Elijah, I have a plan for you.

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:18.400
You can read of that in 1 Kings 19, verses 15 through 17.

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:20.640
God says, I have a plan for you, Elijah.

00:19:21.919 --> 00:19:23.479
What do you think about Paul?

00:19:23.479 --> 00:19:24.739
God had a plan for Paul.

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:27.059
Paul says it this way.

00:19:27.059 --> 00:19:29.700
If you look over at 2 Timothy, chapter number one,

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:33.659
and look at the New Testament with regard to this plan

00:19:33.659 --> 00:19:36.260
that God had for Paul,

00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:39.440
we find that in 2 Timothy, chapter number one,

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:42.940
that Paul is giving as he's writing

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:44.219
to his son of the faith, Timothy.

00:19:44.219 --> 00:19:49.219
He's rehearsing this truth that God had a plan for his life.

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:50.900
In 2 Timothy, chapter number one,

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:51.900
beginning in verse number eight,

00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:54.780
the Bible says, be not thou therefore ashamed

00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:58.539
of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me, his prisoner,

00:19:58.539 --> 00:19:59.940
but be thou partaker.

00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:02.540
the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God.

00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:05.780
Notice what the Bible says, who have saved us.

00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:08.080
Remember we talked about his plan of redemption last week,

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:13.080
but then he says this, and called us with a holy calling.

00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:16.740
Not according to our works, but according to,

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:21.740
notice what it says, his own purpose and grace,

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:26.180
which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,

00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:29.080
but is now made manifest by the appearing of our savior,

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:31.400
Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death,

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:33.880
and hath brought life and immortality to light

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:35.200
through the gospel.

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.960
Notice what Paul says, where unto I,

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:40.900
this is God's plan for Paul's life,

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:44.280
where unto I am appointed a preacher,

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:47.500
and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles,

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:49.520
for the which cause I also suffer these things,

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:51.280
nevertheless I am not ashamed,

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:53.400
for I know whom I have believed,

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:55.760
and am persuaded that he is able to keep that

00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:59.720
which I have committed unto him against that day.

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:01.840
You know what Paul says as he's writing

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:03.840
to the believers in Philippi,

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:06.520
as he speaks about his call,

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:08.720
and understanding that God has a plan for his life,

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:11.800
he says this, he says that I follow after,

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:15.400
if that I may apprehend that for which also

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:19.120
I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:22.080
God had a plan for Paul.

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:23.160
In the same text of scripture,

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:25.400
God reveals to us that he had a plan for Timothy.

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:27.360
In 2 Timothy 1 and verse number six,

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:30.959
notice what God says as Timothy is being written to him

00:21:30.959 --> 00:21:32.200
to the inspirational Holy Spirit of God

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:33.760
as Paul is writing this letter.

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:35.760
It says in verse number six of 2 Timothy 1,

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:38.360
wherefore I put thee in remembrance

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:41.700
that thou stir up the gift of God,

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:44.560
which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:46.980
Now understand that this is not that Paul

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:49.000
somehow supernaturally put this gift on him

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.240
through the laying of his hands,

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:52.000
but it was a very common thing you've heard

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.360
and you've read about somebody laying hands

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:58.520
on somebody and that recognition of God

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:00.600
calling and equipping an individual.

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:02.180
It's God who does the work,

00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:04.680
but Paul says that through this process,

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:07.240
but he says listen, remember that God

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:08.260
has a plan for your life.

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:11.339
Stir up the gift of God which is in thee.

00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:16.139
This morning, I believe it's obvious,

00:22:16.139 --> 00:22:18.940
and we get the point as we look at all of these examples

00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:23.660
this morning that God had a specific plan for their lives.

00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:25.220
But here's really the question.

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:28.900
Does God have a plan for my life?

00:22:30.059 --> 00:22:33.880
Or is it just that he had a plan for the saints of old?

00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:37.339
See, if we're not careful, we can go to God's word

00:22:37.339 --> 00:22:40.139
and we can say, well yeah, God used that person.

00:22:40.139 --> 00:22:41.540
God had a plan for that person

00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:43.020
and God had a plan for that person.

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:44.660
I read about their life and yeah,

00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:46.619
we can read about Moses and Aaron and Bezalel

00:22:46.619 --> 00:22:48.460
and Joshua and David and so on and so forth

00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:51.520
and we could list a whole host of other Bible characters

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:55.119
this morning that God used in a specific way.

00:22:55.119 --> 00:22:56.360
But I would submit to you this morning

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:59.000
that God has a plan for you as an individual.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.199
God knows you.

00:23:00.199 --> 00:23:04.119
He knows you by name and has a plan for you.

00:23:04.119 --> 00:23:07.020
And the plan that God has for you,

00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:09.680
let me say it this way, can only be fulfilled by you.

00:23:11.559 --> 00:23:12.919
God has a plan for you.

00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:18.880
And he desires that you would serve him with your life.

00:23:18.919 --> 00:23:22.199
And as you yield to his plan for your life,

00:23:22.199 --> 00:23:26.080
he will use you as an individual

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:28.440
to be part of the corporate

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:33.440
to bring to pass his ultimate master plan.

00:23:33.479 --> 00:23:34.720
Now that's amazing to me.

00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:37.320
That's our great God.

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:39.740
He's got a plan for your life.

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:41.040
Look at what the Bible says again

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:42.919
in Ephesians 2 in verse number 10.

00:23:44.979 --> 00:23:46.520
We've read it already.

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:48.600
We're gonna look at another verse of scripture

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:51.639
and then get into a couple of thoughts this morning.

00:23:51.639 --> 00:23:54.639
Very lengthy introduction this morning

00:23:54.639 --> 00:23:56.720
in order to prove and to understand

00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:59.800
that God has a plan for our lives.

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:03.240
Again, as we referenced in Ephesians chapter number two,

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:05.199
Paul is obviously under the inspiration

00:24:05.199 --> 00:24:06.040
of the Holy Spirit of God,

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:07.639
writing to those who have been saved.

00:24:07.639 --> 00:24:09.020
If you've been saved this morning,

00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:12.000
you know the Lord Jesus Christ is your personal savior

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.960
and you've accepted that free gift of eternal life.

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:16.480
The Bible says in verse number 10,

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:20.839
for we are his workmanship.

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:23.820
That word we is so important

00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:28.279
because it's Paul writing to a group of believers

00:24:28.279 --> 00:24:32.080
and he's saying that we are his workmanship

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:33.760
and God had a plan for their lives.

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:36.760
Notice over in the book of Philippians in chapter number one,

00:24:37.799 --> 00:24:40.880
Philippians chapter number one in verse number six,

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:42.880
Paul is writing to a different church here,

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:44.559
the church at Philippi.

00:24:44.559 --> 00:24:47.640
And as he's writing to this church at Philippi,

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:52.640
he's rejoicing at the introduction of the letter

00:24:52.959 --> 00:24:55.720
and understanding that this church is an established church

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:58.839
but he's saying I thank my God upon every remembrance of you

00:24:58.839 --> 00:25:01.279
and he's letting them know how he's praying for them

00:25:01.279 --> 00:25:02.679
and all of these things.

00:25:02.679 --> 00:25:05.279
But I want you to notice what Paul says in verse number six.

00:25:05.279 --> 00:25:08.600
He says being confident of this very thing

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:14.600
that he, God, which hath begun a good work in you

00:25:14.839 --> 00:25:17.839
will perform it, that good work,

00:25:17.839 --> 00:25:20.820
until the day of Jesus Christ.

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:27.880
Paul was confident that these believers in Philippi,

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:32.040
that just as God had a plan for his life individually,

00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:35.679
just as God had a plan for the believers in Ephesus,

00:25:35.679 --> 00:25:38.380
that Paul was confident that God had a plan

00:25:39.059 --> 00:25:40.220
for the people at Philippi,

00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:43.260
for those believers that had placed their faith and trust

00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:44.700
in the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:48.179
He says I'm confident that God is going to,

00:25:48.179 --> 00:25:50.500
he started that work but he's gonna bring that work

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:51.660
to completion.

00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:55.860
What a blessing to consider this morning

00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:59.179
that God has a plan for us as individuals.

00:25:59.179 --> 00:26:01.080
See, so many people today go through life

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:03.019
and they ask this question, why am I here?

00:26:03.019 --> 00:26:04.000
What's my purpose?

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.140
What's my point?

00:26:06.059 --> 00:26:08.739
God has a plan for us.

00:26:08.739 --> 00:26:11.899
His plan for all mankind is that they'd be saved.

00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:18.779
After salvation, his plan for all of his children

00:26:18.779 --> 00:26:21.339
is that they would grow in Christ.

00:26:21.339 --> 00:26:23.059
We're talking about the plan that God has for us

00:26:23.059 --> 00:26:26.000
in a certain sense, there are many aspects of that plan

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.700
that are consistent for each of us.

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:30.619
He wants each of us to grow in grace

00:26:30.619 --> 00:26:33.179
and knowledge of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.

00:26:34.179 --> 00:26:37.339
But we find that he has an individual plan for our lives

00:26:37.339 --> 00:26:39.820
and as we understand that truth this morning,

00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:41.660
simply two thoughts.

00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:43.540
Number one, if you're taking notes,

00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:47.260
finding God's plan for your life.

00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:51.540
This is a question that so many people struggle with.

00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:57.100
How do I find God's plan or God's will for my life?

00:26:57.100 --> 00:27:00.059
Again, there are many things that are known

00:27:00.059 --> 00:27:03.299
that are consistent for all of God's children.

00:27:03.299 --> 00:27:04.820
You'll read throughout the scriptures

00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:09.339
where the Bible will say, this is the will of God, right?

00:27:09.339 --> 00:27:11.220
We're to give thanks in everything, right?

00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:14.100
We're to certain things that we understand.

00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:16.200
I've mentioned this, I said it last week

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:18.839
in our Family Sunday School class last week.

00:27:18.839 --> 00:27:20.980
I said this, listen, there's some things

00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:23.459
that we just simply don't need to pray about.

00:27:23.459 --> 00:27:24.519
What do you mean by that?

00:27:24.519 --> 00:27:26.540
Well, when God says to do something,

00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:28.179
we don't have to pray about whether we're gonna do it

00:27:28.179 --> 00:27:30.380
or not, we just need to obey.

00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:32.500
It's not a matter of say, well, I'm gonna pray about that.

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:33.820
No, you don't pray about obedience,

00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:36.140
you just do what God said to do.

00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:39.420
We speak this morning about this individual plan

00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:42.700
that God has for our lives and we say, yes,

00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:46.480
there's some revealed will of God for all of his people,

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:48.660
but what does God want for my life?

00:27:49.619 --> 00:27:51.700
What is God's plan for my life?

00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:55.019
If I'm trying to find God's plan for my life,

00:27:55.019 --> 00:27:56.980
very simply this morning, I would say this.

00:27:56.980 --> 00:28:00.040
Number one, we need to ask him, ask him.

00:28:01.459 --> 00:28:02.299
Why ask him?

00:28:02.299 --> 00:28:05.619
Because it's his plan for your life.

00:28:05.619 --> 00:28:06.940
You know how many people go through life saying,

00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:08.519
this is my plan for my life?

00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:11.700
You talk to people, hey, what are you going to do

00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:12.519
with your life?

00:28:12.519 --> 00:28:14.660
I was asked that question so many times

00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:17.459
when I was entering into those years of high school,

00:28:17.459 --> 00:28:18.860
getting close to graduation.

00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:20.019
What are you going to do?

00:28:20.019 --> 00:28:21.420
What is your plan?

00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:23.839
And then I got saved as a senior in high school

00:28:23.839 --> 00:28:27.080
and all of a sudden, my whole thought process changed

00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:29.040
through the preaching of God's word

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.640
and through a man of God who'll be here

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:32.520
for our revival meeting, Palmer Sean,

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:36.320
who instructed me and helped me to get a perspective

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:38.280
that it's not about my plan for my life,

00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:41.119
but it's about what God's plan is for my life.

00:28:41.119 --> 00:28:42.840
And it doesn't matter what I want to do,

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:45.720
it matters what God wants to do in and through my life.

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:48.520
And here's the thing, if I delight myself in the Lord,

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:51.200
man, all of a sudden, what his plan is for me

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:52.960
is what I want to do.

00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:55.960
It's what I most desire to do.

00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:58.880
And so when I say, and it seems very obvious

00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:00.640
and almost elementary to say,

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:02.320
I'm going to find God's plan for my life

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:03.739
and it starts by asking him,

00:29:03.739 --> 00:29:06.679
but look over in Acts chapter nine.

00:29:06.679 --> 00:29:08.359
We talked already about the fact

00:29:08.359 --> 00:29:10.799
and we referenced in 2 Timothy chapter number one

00:29:10.799 --> 00:29:14.119
that Paul is referencing that God had a plan for him

00:29:14.119 --> 00:29:16.799
individually and he's sharing that testimony.

00:29:16.799 --> 00:29:18.400
But here in Acts chapter number nine

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:21.760
is where we meet the, or read the text of scripture

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:24.780
where Saul trusts Christ as his savior,

00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:27.220
where Saul is born again.

00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:30.640
We obviously refer to him often as Paul.

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:33.000
And, but we find here in this text

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.559
that this is the conversion of Paul

00:29:35.559 --> 00:29:38.000
and his name is referenced here as being Saul.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.919
But I want to draw your attention in verse number four,

00:29:40.919 --> 00:29:43.799
the Bible says that he fell to the earth after what?

00:29:43.799 --> 00:29:46.580
After this, the suddenly in verse number three,

00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:48.880
there shined round about him a light from heaven.

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:50.720
So, so Saul falls to the earth.

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:54.039
He heard a voice saying, Saul, Saul,

00:29:54.039 --> 00:29:56.580
why persecutest thou me?

00:29:56.580 --> 00:30:00.000
And he, Saul said, who art thou Lord?

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:05.639
And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest, it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.

00:30:05.639 --> 00:30:11.560
And I want you to notice that it was in that moment that Saul trusted Christ as his Savior.

00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:15.079
And look at the question that he asks immediately.

00:30:15.079 --> 00:30:22.840
He trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?

00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:28.000
It's a very simple question, but how important it is.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.080
The Bible tells us that we have not because we ask not.

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:36.439
I understand that it continues that we have not because we ask amiss, there's two aspects

00:30:36.439 --> 00:30:37.439
of that.

00:30:37.439 --> 00:30:43.740
But you know, so many people today struggle with this idea of trying to find God's plan

00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:45.520
for their lives.

00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:49.200
But the reality is that they need to start by simply asking Him, God, what's your plan

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:50.200
for my life?

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:53.479
God, what do you want me to do?

00:30:53.479 --> 00:30:55.599
How can I serve you, Lord?

00:30:55.599 --> 00:30:58.720
Because God has a plan for you.

00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:04.639
And in order for us to understand the significance of this truth this morning of how great our

00:31:04.639 --> 00:31:11.639
God is and that He has a plan for each individual, that we simply ask Him as Paul did, Lord,

00:31:11.639 --> 00:31:13.879
what would thou have me to do?

00:31:13.879 --> 00:31:15.639
What would thou have me to do?

00:31:15.639 --> 00:31:20.480
It's interesting as you look through this chapter that in verse number 15, the Bible

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:23.160
says, but the Lord said unto him, go thy way.

00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:28.639
He's speaking to Ananias here and it says, for he is a chosen vessel unto me to bear

00:31:28.639 --> 00:31:32.879
my name before the Gentiles and kings and the children of Israel, for I will show him

00:31:32.879 --> 00:31:36.160
how great things he must suffer for my name's sake.

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:40.279
You know, when you read that verse in verse 15 that it says that he shall bear my name

00:31:40.279 --> 00:31:45.639
before the Gentiles and kings and the children of Israel, that was God's plan for Paul and

00:31:45.639 --> 00:31:48.239
God did that through Paul.

00:31:48.239 --> 00:31:49.239
Why?

00:31:49.239 --> 00:31:52.720
Because Paul said for me to live as Christ.

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:56.400
He asked and then he submitted to.

00:31:56.400 --> 00:32:02.239
It's important that when we ask God what His plan is for our life, that we're not asking

00:32:02.239 --> 00:32:06.559
God so that we can determine if that's something I want to sign up for.

00:32:06.559 --> 00:32:09.279
You understand what I'm saying?

00:32:09.279 --> 00:32:10.279
No, no.

00:32:10.279 --> 00:32:18.399
We're asking God with a heart of obedience and submission that as God reveals to us and

00:32:18.399 --> 00:32:24.960
answers to us what His plan is for our life, that we say, yes sir.

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:29.740
Why callest thou me Lord, Lord, and do not the things that I say?

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:34.919
And we find this morning that as we are seeking to find God's plan for our life, we look and

00:32:34.919 --> 00:32:40.600
we've given example after example this morning to prove without any shadow of a doubt that

00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:46.919
God has a plan for individuals and as God has that plan for individuals and they vary

00:32:46.919 --> 00:32:52.279
from person to person but ultimately they're bringing to fulfillment His perfect will and

00:32:52.279 --> 00:32:58.399
His master plan, that we simply ask God, what is it that you want me to do?

00:32:58.399 --> 00:33:04.880
And as we wait on the Lord and we listen for His direction in our lives, that we have that

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:08.119
heart attitude of submission to His plan.

00:33:08.119 --> 00:33:12.360
Let me say this this morning, that God's plan for your life is better than your plan for

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:15.559
your life.

00:33:15.559 --> 00:33:18.800
God's plan for your life is far better than your plan for your life.

00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:23.199
You say, well you haven't heard my plan.

00:33:23.199 --> 00:33:26.639
God's plan for your life is better than your plan for your life.

00:33:26.639 --> 00:33:27.639
Guaranteed.

00:33:27.639 --> 00:33:28.639
Why?

00:33:28.639 --> 00:33:31.639
Because God knows everything.

00:33:31.639 --> 00:33:34.880
God has this master plan, He's going to bring all these things to pass and God says I have

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:36.679
a plan for your life.

00:33:36.679 --> 00:33:41.000
Notice that as we find God's plan for our life that we recognize this morning that it

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:46.600
is God who has called us as we read there in 2 Timothy chapter 1 but it's also God who

00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:48.559
equips us.

00:33:48.559 --> 00:33:54.600
It's an amazing truth that God calls us, He has this plan for our lives, He calls us,

00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:59.559
He will reveal it to us as we ask Him, as we seek His face.

00:33:59.559 --> 00:34:01.520
God, what is it that you want me to do?

00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:08.440
What wilt thou have me to do that God reveals it to us but then God equips us to do what

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:10.720
He's called us to do.

00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:16.000
I remember when I first realized that God was calling me to preach, I can't.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:21.279
Honestly that was my first answer, I can't.

00:34:21.279 --> 00:34:24.880
Absolutely terrified of the idea of public speaking.

00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:28.799
You sit here and say yeah right, I promise you.

00:34:28.799 --> 00:34:35.040
Absolutely terrified to stand in front of people and talk.

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:40.119
Felt like Moses, God are you sure?

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:41.320
God equips you.

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:45.040
I'm not saying I'm a great preacher or any of that sort of thing but I'm saying God equips

00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:51.959
you as you submit and you let God work, God equips you.

00:34:51.959 --> 00:34:55.880
We look at the truth in God's Word, look at Romans chapter 12.

00:34:55.880 --> 00:35:04.600
In Romans chapter 12 the Bible gives us here in these verses of Scripture this truth about

00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:12.239
how God equips us and I'm so thankful for God's equipping.

00:35:12.239 --> 00:35:18.760
In Romans chapter 12 beginning in verse number 3, the Bible says, for I say through the grace

00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:24.000
given unto me to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:32.480
ought to think, but to think soberly according as God hath dealt to every man the measure

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:33.480
of faith.

00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:39.920
Notice in verse number 4, for as we have many members in one body and all members have not

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:43.559
the same office.

00:35:43.559 --> 00:35:46.679
God's individual plan for each of us.

00:35:46.679 --> 00:35:54.440
Notice in verse number 5, so we being many are one body in Christ and every one members

00:35:54.440 --> 00:36:00.920
one of another, having then gifts differing according to the grace.

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:07.720
Notice these words, that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy, whether

00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:13.200
according to the proportion of faith, or ministry, let us wait on our ministering, or he that

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:17.399
teacheth on teaching, or he that exhorteth on exhortation, he that giveth, let him do

00:36:17.399 --> 00:36:22.480
it with simplicity, he that ruleth with diligence, he that showeth mercy with cheerfulness.

00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:26.799
The Bible tells us in the book of 1 Corinthians that God, the Holy Spirit, that he gives the

00:36:26.799 --> 00:36:30.959
gift to every man as he will.

00:36:30.959 --> 00:36:37.760
It's God's plan for our lives individually, yes a corporate, the body of Christ.

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:42.480
We can think about a local church, we can think about the universal church and understand

00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:49.839
that God's plan for the ages and God's plan globally, but he says that we have, yes every

00:36:49.839 --> 00:36:55.839
one of us, we have this gift and it differs one from another.

00:36:55.880 --> 00:37:01.320
Some people have multiple gifts that God has given them.

00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:06.600
They're responsible for those gifts that God has given them and as we discover, we're finding

00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:11.200
what God's plan is for our life, we're understanding that he's called us, but he's also equipped

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:17.859
us and he's given us the ability, notice in 1 Peter chapter number 4, the Bible speaks

00:37:17.859 --> 00:37:25.239
about this truth of ministering and having received this gift and it's so precious as

00:37:25.239 --> 00:37:31.279
we look at this truth this morning that no child of God, anyone that's been born again

00:37:31.279 --> 00:37:36.160
that's been saved by the blood of Christ, no one can sit back on the sidelines and say

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:39.600
nope, God didn't give me a gift, he has no plan for my life.

00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:41.600
You know why I can say that?

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:50.519
Biblically, God says that he's given every man, every child of God, a gift.

00:37:50.519 --> 00:37:51.519
Every single person.

00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:54.040
The Bible says that's trust in Christ.

00:37:54.040 --> 00:38:00.760
Notice in verse number 10 of 1 Peter 4, as every man hath received the gift, even so

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:04.359
minister the same one to another.

00:38:04.359 --> 00:38:07.760
Notice I mentioned this in Sunday school this morning, this verse of scripture, as good

00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:13.079
stewards of the manifold grace of God.

00:38:13.079 --> 00:38:18.320
If any men speak, let them speak as the oracles of God.

00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:19.320
Notice the difference.

00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:24.720
If any men minister, so we have differing gifts, but every man has one, every child

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:25.720
of God has one.

00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:29.380
He says if any men minister, let them do it as of the ability of which God giveth.

00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:35.479
Notice this, and I say this by way of introduction this morning, that God in all things may be

00:38:35.479 --> 00:38:42.539
glorified through Jesus Christ to whom be praise and dominion forever and ever, amen.

00:38:42.539 --> 00:38:47.840
As every person does what they're supposed to do, as Moses did what he was supposed to

00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:52.400
do, and as Aaron was doing what he's supposed to do, and as Bezalel and Aholiab did what

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:57.280
they were supposed to do, there's a tabernacle that's able to be reared up where sacrifices

00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:03.559
can be brought, where God's glory can be known, where worship takes place.

00:39:03.559 --> 00:39:08.679
This morning, as we each understand that God has a plan for our lives individually and

00:39:08.679 --> 00:39:13.919
it reminds us, it helps us to understand how great our God is, that he'd use each and every

00:39:13.919 --> 00:39:19.880
one of us, but ultimately it's so that he would be glorified and so that his plan would

00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:22.280
come to pass.

00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:27.280
It's not so that any one of us individually could receive some level of recognition, look

00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:32.940
at that person, look at this person, look at what the, no, no, it's the grace of God.

00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:40.840
It's God who has equipped us and he's equipped us so that we could do his work for his glory.

00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:43.719
Do we find God's plan for our life?

00:39:43.719 --> 00:39:48.659
Ask him, ask him.

00:39:48.659 --> 00:39:52.000
God is such a gracious God.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.919
He's wonderful.

00:39:54.919 --> 00:40:00.080
He says, he uses the comparison in Matthew 6 and 7.

00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:03.360
when he talks about various things there,

00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:08.140
with regard to us and how we, as evil people,

00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:10.280
that we know how to give good gifts.

00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:13.620
Let us see this in verse number seven of Matthew seven.

00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:16.240
I wasn't gonna go here,

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:18.320
but I think it's appropriate for us to do it.

00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:20.520
Look at Matthew seven in verse number seven.

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:26.700
Because it begins with asking.

00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:29.560
Ask, and it shall be given unto you.

00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:30.720
Seek, and ye shall find.

00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:33.560
Knock, and it shall be opened unto you.

00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:35.480
For everyone that asketh receiveth,

00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:36.920
and he that seeketh findeth,

00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:39.680
and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.

00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:42.480
Or what man is there of you whom, if his son ask bread,

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:43.720
will he give him a stone?

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:47.800
If he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:50.460
If ye then, being evil,

00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:54.180
know how to give good gifts unto your children,

00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:56.640
how much more shall your Father, which is in heaven,

00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:59.300
give good things to them that ask him?

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:01.840
Listen, if God has a plan for your life,

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:04.960
and I believe this morning, biblically, he does,

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:08.160
and you ask him, he's gonna reveal it to you.

00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:12.980
You come to him with that submissive, obedient heart.

00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:17.040
God, I just wanna know what you want me to do with my life.

00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:19.120
Because my life, Lord, as the songwriter said,

00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:21.280
is yours to control.

00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:24.640
I've been bought with a price, and I wanna glorify you.

00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:27.960
Lord, what is your plan for my life?

00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:32.000
What will thou have me to do?

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.560
We find God's plan for our life,

00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:34.560
but then I would say, number two,

00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:38.680
this morning, fulfilling God's plan for your life.

00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:42.640
It's a very basic statement this morning,

00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:45.880
but you will never fulfill God's plan for your life

00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:48.940
if you don't first find God's plan for your life.

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:51.960
You say, well, that's pretty obvious.

00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:54.060
You know how many people miss the obvious?

00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:57.420
You're not gonna fulfill what you don't know.

00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:02.620
You have to find it, and then you must live to fulfill it.

00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:06.420
Use Paul as an example this morning again.

00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:10.500
Paul knew what God's plan was for his life.

00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:11.340
Why did he know?

00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:16.340
Because he said, what will thou have me to do?

00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:19.020
God answered that question and revealed to him

00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:20.540
what his plan was for his life,

00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:23.900
and so Paul then had a desire to do what he knew

00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:25.980
what God called him to do.

00:42:25.980 --> 00:42:29.080
He had a desire to fulfill that plan in his life.

00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:31.780
Look at Acts chapter 20, and notice what Paul says

00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:35.780
in his testimony as he's sharing and having revealed to us

00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:37.580
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God

00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:40.580
what his heart attitude was in desiring

00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:44.340
to fulfill God's plan for his life.

00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:46.440
By the way, isn't it better to fulfill God's plan

00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:49.340
for your life than to fulfill your own plan for your life?

00:42:50.340 --> 00:42:52.820
To be able to say, as Paul says at the end of his life

00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:55.180
in 2 Timothy 4, I have finished.

00:42:56.300 --> 00:43:01.180
I finished, I've completed what God wanted me to do.

00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:02.320
And it's wonderful.

00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:06.260
In Acts chapter 20, notice, before he can ever say

00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:07.980
in 2 Timothy 4 that he's finished,

00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:10.500
he says in Acts chapter 20 and verse number 24,

00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:12.060
but none of these things move me,

00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:14.280
neither count I my life dear unto myself

00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:16.660
so that I might finish my course with joy.

00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:18.740
And the ministry, notice what he says,

00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:22.980
which I have received of the Lord Jesus

00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:26.420
to testify the gospel of the grace of God.

00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:29.100
Paul would say this to those that he's writing to

00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:31.500
in the region of Galatia, you don't need to turn there,

00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:33.220
but in Galatians chapter number one,

00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:36.660
he would tell these churches in the region of Galatia

00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:38.820
that were reached during his first missionary journey.

00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:40.940
He says in verse number 11 of Galatians one,

00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:43.140
but I certify you, brethren, that the gospel

00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:45.820
which was preached of me is not after man,

00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:47.180
for I neither received it of man,

00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:48.180
neither was I taught it,

00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:50.500
but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.

00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:52.260
Paul was not in the ministry

00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:54.660
because some man sent him into the ministry.

00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:58.340
God called him, and he said,

00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:01.000
I want to fulfill what God's plan is for my life.

00:44:03.580 --> 00:44:06.240
How many parents have plans for their children?

00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:10.540
You better make sure your plan aligns with God's plan.

00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:15.540
I'd never, never would I want to be held accountable

00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:19.660
for having a plan for my children

00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:21.620
that prevented them from knowing

00:44:21.620 --> 00:44:25.380
and doing God's plan for their lives.

00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:26.220
Never in a million years,

00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:27.220
I don't want to be in that position.

00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:29.220
I don't want to be accountable for that.

00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:31.840
I want my children to know what God wants them to do.

00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:33.460
I want to help try to facilitate that

00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:35.780
and to encourage that and to help them

00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:38.340
and guide them in any way that God would use me to do it,

00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:41.980
but they got to know what God's plan is for their life.

00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:44.680
Joseph, not often now, but when he was younger,

00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:46.400
was asked repeatedly,

00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:48.840
are you going to be a preacher like your daddy?

00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:50.260
You know what I taught Joseph?

00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:51.840
You can't be a preacher like your daddy

00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:54.560
unless God calls you to be a preacher.

00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:57.440
It's not just something you decide to do.

00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:01.320
No, it's God's plan.

00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:03.300
By the way, if you think you just want to decide

00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:05.080
to be a preacher and God didn't call you,

00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:07.240
you're probably not going to last very long.

00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:11.400
And I don't say that for any kind of sympathy

00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:14.840
or it's just you got to know what God wants you to do.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:20.500
And Paul, he says, none of these things move me.

00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:24.200
Neither count I my life dear unto myself, why?

00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:29.200
Because I want to fulfill what God has for me to do,

00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:31.640
his plan for me.

00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:32.900
He's revealed it to me, why?

00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:36.200
Because I asked him, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:40.280
And now my gaze is fixed and I am absolutely set

00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:44.180
on doing what God has called me to do.

00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:47.400
We find that Paul is able to say,

00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:51.820
as I referenced already in 2 Timothy 4, that he's finished.

00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:52.760
He's finished his course.

00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:55.200
He's done what God's called him to do.

00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:57.920
This morning though, for you and for me,

00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:00.360
I want to draw your attention as we look at a couple

00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:03.000
of verses in closing to Colossians 4.

00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:06.160
Colossians chapter 4.

00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:07.720
See, Paul wasn't just concerned

00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:12.720
about fulfilling the plan that God had for his own life.

00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:17.480
The Apostle Paul was interested in other servants of God,

00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:22.040
people of God, fulfilling what God's plan was for their life.

00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:24.520
And in Colossians chapter 4, we see this charge

00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:28.000
that is given to Archippus that's mentioned here

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:29.360
in verse number 17.

00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:31.760
And we find that this charge is given,

00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:34.360
and we find that again, it summarizes,

00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:37.680
help us to understand that God has an individual plan

00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:39.360
for each of us.

00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:41.680
Most of us this morning, if we were to ask as you came in,

00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:45.160
who's Archippus, who are you talking about?

00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:49.600
There's not, it's not like Paul or David.

00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:51.840
He's mentioned here, and notice what the Bible says,

00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:54.320
and say to Archippus, take heed to the ministry

00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:57.220
which thou hast received from what?

00:46:57.220 --> 00:47:02.220
In the Lord, from the Lord, that thou fulfill it.

00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:07.280
See, Paul understood that God had a plan

00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:11.720
for this man Archippus, that God had given him a ministry.

00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:16.040
And God uses Paul to try to give this charge

00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:19.840
and to try to encourage this saint of God

00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:24.840
that he would fulfill God's plan for his life individually.

00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:28.560
Now understand, as I mentioned about finding God's plan

00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:32.360
for my life, that he calls me and he equips me,

00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:35.080
and then as I'm seeking to fulfill God's plan for my life,

00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:37.960
he's there and he's enabling us.

00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:42.960
It's so awesome that he equips us for what the plan is,

00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:47.880
and then he enables us as we're seeking to fulfill

00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:49.480
the work that he's given us to do,

00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:52.400
and he's enabling us to do it, and he's there,

00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:55.360
and his spirit gives us the strength

00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:58.400
and the power that we need as we're seeking

00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:00.820
to fulfill the ministry that he's given us to do.

00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:02.840
And then this is an amazing truth,

00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:07.080
as we finish our lives and as we fulfill the role

00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:09.520
that God has given us to do, the plan that God gives us,

00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:10.360
you know what he does?

00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:11.960
He rewards us.

00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:17.040
He rewards us, so he's the one that called us,

00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:20.040
he's the one that equips us, and then he enables us,

00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:23.520
and then as we do it, he rewards us.

00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:24.800
It's absolutely amazing.

00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:30.520
How am I gonna fulfill it?

00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:31.480
What am I gonna do?

00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:35.640
You say, I'm struggling with finding it.

00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:39.400
Once you find it, you gotta have that fixed perspective

00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:41.799
that I'm gonna finish, I'm gonna fulfill

00:48:41.799 --> 00:48:42.920
what God's given me to do.

00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:45.239
Look at Hebrews 12 in closing.

00:48:45.239 --> 00:48:47.720
Verses that we're familiar with, no doubt.

00:48:50.660 --> 00:48:52.280
In Hebrews chapter 12,

00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:05.640
it's interesting for in chapter number 11,

00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:08.360
if you're familiar with Hebrews 11,

00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:10.100
we often will refer to the chapter

00:49:10.100 --> 00:49:12.760
as being the hall of faith chapter.

00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:14.640
And as you look at Hebrews chapter 11,

00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:18.119
you'll read of those saints of old,

00:49:18.119 --> 00:49:20.799
those heroes of the faith that sometimes we refer to them

00:49:20.799 --> 00:49:23.440
as that by faith, this person did this,

00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:25.059
and by faith, this person did that.

00:49:25.059 --> 00:49:27.400
I would say to you that as you look at Hebrews 11,

00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:28.239
you know what it was?

00:49:28.239 --> 00:49:31.080
It was individuals fulfilling God's plan

00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:33.880
that God had for their lives.

00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:35.559
That's Hebrews 11.

00:49:35.559 --> 00:49:38.239
So then Hebrews 12, it says this,

00:49:38.239 --> 00:49:42.840
wherefore, seeing we also are compassed about

00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:45.720
with so great a cloud of witnesses,

00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:48.320
let us lay aside every weight,

00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:51.320
and the sin which does so easily beset us,

00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:56.320
notice what he says, and let us run with patience

00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:59.320
the race that is before us.

00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:00.160
So we can.

00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:05.760
of those saints of old that had fulfilled the plan that God had for their lives. God

00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:12.080
revealed what His plan was for them, and they fulfilled the plan that God had for their

00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:19.000
lives. But what about us? Paul says, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:24.400
doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us. Notice

00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:32.680
the key in verse two, looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, who

00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:37.160
for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set

00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:42.720
down at the right hand of the throne of God. For consider Him that endured such contradiction

00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:49.520
of sinners against Himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds. I don't want to be

00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:56.160
wearied and faintish. I want to fulfill, but I've got to keep my eyes on Jesus. It's amazing

00:50:56.160 --> 00:51:05.860
to me. I look at the messages that God placed upon my heart to deliver today, and it's interesting

00:51:05.860 --> 00:51:11.340
how they're all connected. If you were in the family Sunday school this morning, Samuel,

00:51:11.340 --> 00:51:18.280
he judged Israel all the days of his life. God had a plan for his life, and Samuel fulfilled

00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:23.920
God's plan for his life. He had a testimony of faithfully doing what God called him to

00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:28.080
do. This evening, we're going to look at a passage of Scripture that I hope would be

00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:32.960
an encouragement to you as we think about our own testimonies. And sandwiched between

00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:38.880
those two thoughts is this truth this morning, this biblical truth, that God has a plan for

00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:48.120
our lives. And I must come to the place where I say, I want to know. Again, God has a plan

00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:52.320
for all people of all times to be saved. We dealt with it last week, the plan of redemption.

00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:59.400
But if you've been saved this morning, God has a plan for your life as an individual.

00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:06.520
How do I find it? Ask Him. With a heart attitude of obedience and submission. God, what wilt

00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:15.600
thou have me to do? And as He reveals that to us, and as He equips us for it, we seek

00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:23.680
to fulfill through His enablement. And Paul, after he makes that statement in 2 Timothy

00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:29.200
4 about finishing his course, he says this in verse number 8, henceforth there is laid

00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:35.280
up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give

00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:43.240
me at that day. Not to me only, but unto all them also that love is appearing. He'll reward

00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:48.960
us for doing what He's called us to do, what He's equipped us to do. This morning, child

00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:56.800
of God, I hope that you recognize God's greatness through the truth that He has a plan for His

00:52:56.800 --> 00:53:03.360
individual children. But I hope this morning that we're convicted of, God, what's your

00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:09.760
plan for my life? If you don't know, man, ask God to show it to you. Because you're

00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:14.560
never gonna fulfill what God's plan is for your life until you find it. It's gonna be

00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:21.680
spinning your wheels. You ever hear that term floundering around? Right? Spinning your wheels.

00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:28.080
Sitting in a rocking chair, keeping you busy but not getting anywhere. Find God's plan

00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:33.160
for your life. Know that He has a plan for your life. Find it. And then God, help me

00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:38.440
to fulfill your plan for my life. Why? Because I wanna please you. Let's pray together. Father,

00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:43.120
we love you. Thank you for loving us. Thank you for your word. Lord, we looked at so many

00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:53.920
examples this morning of those saints of old, if you will, that you used. You had a plan

00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:59.600
for their lives and you revealed it to them and they fulfilled and you were glorified

00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:09.520
and you worked and your plan was accomplished. And God, I pray that today, in 2023, that

00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:19.440
we would acknowledge that we are your workmanship and that you have a plan for us as individuals.

00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:29.120
God, I pray for those that have already found your plan for their lives. God, you'd help

00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:37.080
them to fulfill it. Help them to be faithful. Faithful unto death. Keeping their eyes on

00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:42.080
Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith. Maybe this morning there's some that have

00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:46.480
not yet gotten to that point where they've actually found, discovered what your plan

00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:52.040
is for their life. Maybe there's some that have been saved that quite honestly they would

00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:56.840
just say, I didn't even know that God had a plan for me. God, I pray that you'd help

00:54:56.840 --> 00:55:04.400
them to seek your face diligently and earnestly. That God, you would reveal to them your plan

00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:10.880
for their lives and they would fulfill it. God, if there's one that's not been saved,

00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:15.520
that's in our midst today or tuned in via live stream, they've never trusted Christ

00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:21.400
as their Savior, I pray that today they would get that settled. They would trust Christ,

00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:29.920
they would be redeemed. I pray, Lord, that in these few moments of invitation as we have

00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:35.680
an opportunity to respond to you, Lord, I pray that you'd help us to be doers of the

00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:42.920
word and not hearers only. Help us once again to stand in awe of how great you are through

00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:47.560
this truth that you have a plan for us as individuals. Ultimately to bring glory to

00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:54.160
yourself and to fulfill your master plan, would you move and work as only you can? For

00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:58.200
it's in Christ's name we pray. Would you stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.
