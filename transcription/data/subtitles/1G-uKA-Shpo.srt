1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,119
Just at verses one and two this morning in 2 Timothy chapter number two, we are informed

2
00:00:05,119 --> 00:00:12,560
that the believer is a soldier in the Lord's army. Aren't you thankful for that? We are soldiers and

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:17,760
we're in the Lord's army, and hallelujah for that. Throughout the chapter of 2 Timothy chapter

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:24,559
number two, we find that God provides us with the number of characteristics of the Christian

5
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:29,840
soldier. Over the weeks to come, we'll be looking at those characteristics and dealing with

6
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:36,720
the content that God gives us here in 2 Timothy chapter number two. However, there is a vital

7
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:42,159
truth provided for us in the beginning of this chapter, and I believe this morning that it is

8
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:51,200
imperative that every child of God understands and puts into practice this principle. It's absolutely

9
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,119
vital, and we're going to look at that this morning. We're going to take the entirety of

10
00:00:55,119 --> 00:01:00,720
the service this morning to look at just the first two verses, because I believe that this truth

11
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:09,839
is so vital, it is so absolutely imperative that we as the people of God understand and put into

12
00:01:09,839 --> 00:01:15,440
practice. You understand that God is the creator. You understand that this morning? You understand

13
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:22,400
that Satan is the imitator. Amen? He doesn't create anything. He imitates, and can I tell you

14
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:32,080
that he steals the truth that God has given, and his kingdom utilizes the same principles.

15
00:01:33,279 --> 00:01:41,680
Amen? His kingdom uses the same principles. He's not a creator, but he's a thief, right? The Bible

16
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:48,319
tells us in John 8, he's a thief and he's a murderer. Amen? And we find that he's the father

17
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:55,040
of lies. He's the liar, and we find here that he steals the truth that God gives us in this

18
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:02,000
passage of Scripture, and can I tell you that the kingdom of this world—see, God refers to Satan in

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,440
2 Corinthians chapter number 4 as the god of this world, little g, all right? He's the little g god

20
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:16,320
of this world, and he has imitated—and by the way, 2 Corinthians chapter 10 tells us about the way

21
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:21,039
that he transforms himself into an angel of light, a minister of Christ, and so on and so forth,

22
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:26,479
and we find this morning that the principle that we're going to look at—if I would say broadly

23
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:35,759
this morning, the followers of Jesus Christ have failed to fully understand and implement this

24
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:42,320
truth, this vital principle, but yet the enemy is doing a great job implementing it,

25
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:48,080
and it's a sad reality. What is this truth? I believe it's a truth that has been embraced by

26
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:54,720
every generation of believers that has gone before us. It is a truth that they have embraced that

27
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:02,559
has allowed for each of us this morning to have the faith, the truth delivered to us. Now,

28
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:10,720
it's our time. It's our opportunity. Who can reach this generation? This generation. We must

29
00:03:11,679 --> 00:03:18,160
reach. We must understand that it is our opportunity, and as we embrace the truth of

30
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:24,479
God's Word, as we embrace the principle that God gives us in these two verses of Scripture,

31
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:31,039
and we implement it, incorporate it into our lives, then we can successfully, just as it has

32
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:38,479
been done for generations, pass down the truth of God's Word to those that are coming after us.

33
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:47,759
What does the principle summarize this way? Teach others also. Teach others also.

34
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:52,800
Notice with me in 2 Timothy 2, verse number one, the Bible says,

35
00:03:52,800 --> 00:04:00,320
Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. I'm thankful for the

36
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:04,960
grace that God gives. I'm thankful for the strength that God gives. And then notice in

37
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:13,279
verse number two, the focus of our message this morning, and the things that thou hast heard of me

38
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:22,000
among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men who shall be able to teach others

39
00:04:22,799 --> 00:04:31,359
also. I mentioned by way of introduction the way in which the enemy has imitated

40
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:36,399
the plan that we find here. Can I tell you that our public schools have become a place in which

41
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:40,959
there's indoctrination that is taking place? Can I tell you that the public arena, listen,

42
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:48,399
they have taken and they have incorporated this principle of taking and passing down. Now,

43
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:55,200
the problem is that they're not passing down truth. Amen? They're passing down wickedness,

44
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:01,040
and they're passing down those things which oppose God and His Word. They're calling evil good,

45
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:08,399
and they're calling good evil, but they are being extremely successful on teaching others.

46
00:05:09,679 --> 00:05:12,480
If you don't think that's true, you need to open your eyes.

47
00:05:15,359 --> 00:05:20,959
But somewhere along the line, God's people have failed to follow the principle. There

48
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:26,880
are literally books that are being written on why we're losing generations of believers.

49
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:32,160
Why is it that people that are growing up in churches, as soon as they reach a certain age,

50
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,760
they leave the church. They're no longer part of the church. Where is it that Christianity,

51
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:44,480
biblical Christianity, with the truth of God's Word have lost their way? We've tried some other

52
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:49,519
methodologies. We've done whatever it is that we've done, and we've missed the boat. We've

53
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:53,519
failed to incorporate the principle, and now we have a group of people

54
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:59,040
that grew up in Sunday school. They grew up singing the songs. They grew up memorizing the verses,

55
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:05,040
but they don't come to church any longer. It's such a sad reality. Such a sad reality.

56
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:10,000
This morning, as we look at this principle that is contained in this passage of Scripture,

57
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,640
I've titled the message, simply as the verse ends, teach others also. If you're taking notes,

58
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:22,160
number one, I want you to consider the investment of Paul. Consider with me the investment of Paul

59
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:26,480
right here in this text of Scripture in verse number two. You notice that the Bible says, as

60
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:30,880
Paul in verse number one refers to Timothy as his son, but then in verse number two he says,

61
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:39,279
and the things that thou hast heard of me. So Paul made a personal investment. We find

62
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:44,720
that as he makes this investment, he's investing contextually. As we look at this letter to

63
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:51,519
Timothy, he's investing in Timothy, his son in the faith, and we find that he's invested not only in

64
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:58,239
Timothy, there are others in whom Paul invested, but understanding the letter and the context,

65
00:06:58,239 --> 00:07:04,880
we find the investment, the personal investment that we have here of the apostle Paul. Now,

66
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,279
we find that in verse number 13 of chapter one, maybe on the same page of your Bible,

67
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:16,880
it says this in verse number 13 of chapter one, hold fast the form of sound words. Notice what

68
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:25,839
it says, which thou hast heard of me in faith and love, which is in Christ Jesus. So Paul was not

69
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:32,160
trying to give Timothy some principle to follow that he himself had not incorporated in his life.

70
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:39,600
Paul was active in investing in a future generation. Paul understood his age, he understood

71
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:45,440
his circumstances, he understood that he had to invest in the next generation. Understand with me

72
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:51,519
this morning that we are not always going to be the church members of Fellowship Baptist Church.

73
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:57,279
I am not going to be the pastor of this church forever. The deacons that we have are not going

74
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:01,679
to be the deacons of this church forever. The Sunday school teachers that we have are not going

75
00:08:01,679 --> 00:08:05,679
to be the Sunday school teachers forever. The musicians that we have are not going to be the

76
00:08:05,679 --> 00:08:12,720
musicians forever. Why? Because we will face death one day, and we no longer, even at times before

77
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:18,559
death, there are certain things we can't do any longer because of age and what have you, and we

78
00:08:18,559 --> 00:08:26,320
must be actively involved in understanding the importance of investing in a future generation.

79
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:32,960
Why? Because they're the future of our church. Who's going to teach Sunday school? Who's going

80
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:38,719
to lead music? Who's going to play the piano? Who's going to preach? Who's going to? You got to invest.

81
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,960
And Paul understood this principle, and he personally was investing in the next generation.

82
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:51,039
We consider the investment of Paul, I would submit to you, as we studied for so long of this calendar

83
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:59,119
year, the entirety of the book of 1 Timothy. And in that book, we have a written form of how Paul

84
00:08:59,119 --> 00:09:07,760
was investing in Timothy, how Paul was instructing Timothy, how he was giving him truth. And so we

85
00:09:08,239 --> 00:09:13,520
consider the investment of Paul. When I begin to think about investment in looking here, not

86
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:19,039
financial, you don't want me to be your instructor on financial investment, hallelujah, but I'm

87
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:24,799
speaking of spiritual investment this morning. And as we think about the investment that we make

88
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:30,239
spiritually in the next generation, let me give you three thoughts with regard to investment. You say,

89
00:09:30,239 --> 00:09:34,559
okay, pastor, I understand that I'm not going to be here forever. I understand that I should be

90
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:40,159
teaching others also. I understand that I should be investing in someone else. Let me say this,

91
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:50,000
number one, be purposed as you invest in others. Be purposed. Have a plan. Be purposed in your

92
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:58,080
investment. And we find that it's important that as Paul is investing in Timothy, he's preparing him

93
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,919
for the things that he would face.

94
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:04,959
He's preparing him. He's given truth with regard to the opposition at Ephesus,

95
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:11,279
with regard to the false teaching, and he's being purposed in how he's investing

96
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:18,639
in the one that's going to take the baton and run the next leg of the race.

97
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:19,679
We must be purposed.

98
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:24,399
Number two, I would say this, we must be patient as we invest in others.

99
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,559
Now, this is probably one of the hardest parts of it.

100
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:32,319
Patience is so necessary when we're investing in others.

101
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,679
Why is that the case?

102
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:35,919
Because they're not at the place where you are.

103
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:37,759
That's why you're investing in them.

104
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:38,559
Does that make sense?

105
00:10:39,359 --> 00:10:41,599
You think about the one that's starting to play an instrument.

106
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:46,159
I remember when Brianna first started playing the violin, and Brother Pierre,

107
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:50,559
you can relate to some of the violin students you've had over the years, including Brianna.

108
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:53,439
There were times in which it was like, can you just make it stop?

109
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:58,799
If you've ever had children that played an instrument when they first started,

110
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:00,399
maybe you can relate to that.

111
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,639
I'm not very musical, but there were times in which it was like, I just need it to stop.

112
00:11:06,239 --> 00:11:08,399
It's not the right note.

113
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:08,879
Amen?

114
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:16,639
And the reality is that there must be patience when we're investing in others.

115
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:22,079
Brianna now, and it's no prideful statement, but she's able to play

116
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:28,959
not only the violin and the cello and the piano because somebody, and Pierre was her instructor,

117
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,999
had patience in those early days.

118
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:33,279
Amen?

119
00:11:35,199 --> 00:11:38,799
And we see that it's necessary, listen, when we're trying to instruct somebody,

120
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:42,319
listen, the reality is that when we're trying to instruct somebody to lead music,

121
00:11:42,319 --> 00:11:43,199
they might mess up.

122
00:11:43,199 --> 00:11:47,119
When you're investing in somebody that's going to play an instrument, lead music,

123
00:11:47,119 --> 00:11:48,879
you're investing in someone that's going to teach.

124
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,479
I can't expect somebody that's going to just teach their very first lesson

125
00:11:54,479 --> 00:12:01,039
or preach their very first message to preach as if they've been preaching for 30 years,

126
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:02,239
teaching for 30 years.

127
00:12:02,239 --> 00:12:04,879
It would be an unreasonable expectation.

128
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:05,359
Amen?

129
00:12:06,479 --> 00:12:09,199
By the way, I remember the first message I ever preached.

130
00:12:09,199 --> 00:12:11,679
I remember, Brother Mark, being scared to death.

131
00:12:12,319 --> 00:12:14,159
You guys think I talk fast now?

132
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:15,919
It was a whole nother level.

133
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:16,799
Amen?

134
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:21,439
I mean, I think I had 30 minutes of content that I spoke in about seven.

135
00:12:21,439 --> 00:12:23,359
I mean, I was just flying.

136
00:12:23,359 --> 00:12:24,559
I was nervous.

137
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:26,079
I was, I sweat.

138
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,679
Last Sunday, I was sweating like crazy.

139
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:29,519
I was running around doing all kinds of things.

140
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,599
Man, I was just pouring sweat.

141
00:12:31,599 --> 00:12:33,599
It was, I was so nervous.

142
00:12:33,599 --> 00:12:37,599
I could not wait for it to be over.

143
00:12:37,599 --> 00:12:41,119
And I think the people that were sitting there probably couldn't wait for it to be over either.

144
00:12:41,119 --> 00:12:41,999
Amen?

145
00:12:41,999 --> 00:12:43,999
And some of you say, I still feel that way.

146
00:12:43,999 --> 00:12:44,799
The Lord bless you.

147
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:46,479
Thanks for being here this morning.

148
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:51,279
But the reality is that we need to be patient as we're investing.

149
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,159
Let me say this.

150
00:12:52,719 --> 00:12:54,239
We need to be particular.

151
00:12:54,239 --> 00:12:58,559
What I mean by that is that we ought to be selective.

152
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:00,719
What do I mean by that?

153
00:13:00,719 --> 00:13:01,519
Let me say this.

154
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:02,399
It sounds harsh.

155
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:07,359
I'm going to preface what I'm going to say by telling you it sounds harsh, but the reality

156
00:13:07,359 --> 00:13:07,839
is this.

157
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:13,519
We only have a limited amount of time to invest in individuals.

158
00:13:14,479 --> 00:13:14,959
Amen?

159
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:23,039
And if we only have a limited amount of time, we must be wise in who we choose to invest

160
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:23,599
in.

161
00:13:23,599 --> 00:13:25,199
You say, Pastor, that's harsh.

162
00:13:25,199 --> 00:13:26,399
I don't mean to be unkind.

163
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,599
I don't mean to be harsh.

164
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:31,919
But the reality is that I only have so many minutes and hours and you only have so many

165
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:32,959
minutes and hours.

166
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,879
And we have to be particular.

167
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:40,479
We have to be wise in who we choose to invest in.

168
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:44,719
In the text of Scripture, the Bible says, in the things that thou hast heard of me,

169
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:50,319
among many witnesses, the same commit thou to, what does it say in your Bible?

170
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:56,719
Faithful men who shall be able to teach others also.

171
00:13:56,719 --> 00:14:03,119
There was some element of criteria that would determine if an individual was faithful that

172
00:14:03,119 --> 00:14:06,159
that was somebody to spend the time investing in.

173
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:07,359
Now, let me say this.

174
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:10,959
We need to be careful because there are times in which we can look and say, there is no

175
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:11,999
hope for that person.

176
00:14:11,999 --> 00:14:12,959
And really there is.

177
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,479
We just need to be patient.

178
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:19,839
There's a balance with these three thoughts this morning with regard to consider the investment

179
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,279
of Paul, the being purposed and being patient and being particular.

180
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,199
There is a balance here.

181
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:31,839
But the reality is that soon, early on in the ministry of investing, you can find out

182
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:36,799
if there's, if that individual is faithful, if that individual is the one that you should

183
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:39,759
continue to pour that resource into.

184
00:14:41,439 --> 00:14:42,239
Let me say this.

185
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:44,239
Jesus followed that pattern.

186
00:14:46,479 --> 00:14:47,119
You say, no.

187
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:48,559
Yeah, yeah.

188
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:49,999
Jesus had how many disciples?

189
00:14:49,999 --> 00:14:50,399
Twelve.

190
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,399
But there was an inner circle of three.

191
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:58,719
Peter, James, and John.

192
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:00,399
They were the inner circle.

193
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,079
Let me show you a couple of verses over in Matthew.

194
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:03,439
Hold your place here in 2 Timothy.

195
00:15:03,439 --> 00:15:04,559
We'll be there in just a moment.

196
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:10,399
But look over at Matthew 17, if you will, and look at two passages of Scripture in the

197
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:11,919
Gospel of Matthew.

198
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:17,439
And I want you to see this principle employed by the Lord Jesus Christ as he's investing

199
00:15:17,439 --> 00:15:20,319
in others, and he had the twelve.

200
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:27,279
We understand that one, Judas, was a, was a betrayer, and so there's eleven after he

201
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:32,719
goes and kills himself, after he ratted out the Lord and betrayed him.

202
00:15:32,719 --> 00:15:37,679
And we find that as we come to Matthew 17, prior to all of that taking place, there's

203
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:42,639
twelve disciples at this particular time in history, in the life and ministry of the Lord

204
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:43,679
Jesus Christ.

205
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:48,239
But Matthew 17 reveals to us the three, the inner circle.

206
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:58,879
Notice it says this, and after six days, Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John, his brother.

207
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:01,279
Why didn't he take the other disciples?

208
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:02,479
Well, there's an inner circle.

209
00:16:03,439 --> 00:16:05,039
And he takes Peter, James, and John.

210
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:09,519
He's investing in them, the Bible says, and he bringeth them up into a high mountain apart

211
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,319
and was transfigured before them.

212
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,439
This is the record of the Mount of Transfiguration.

213
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:20,799
And we find that Peter, in fact, spoke of this as he's writing later, and he talks about

214
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:25,039
being on the Mount, and he talks about how we have a more sure word of prophecy.

215
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:30,079
He literally heard the voice of God, this is my beloved Son.

216
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:35,279
We find that as he heard that, and he encountered that, and he's there, and he hears all these

217
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:40,319
things that he writes later, that we have a more sure word of prophecy.

218
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:46,319
We have the Scriptures, we have the Word of God, and how thankful and how blessed we are.

219
00:16:46,319 --> 00:16:50,319
We understand that Peter would stand up on the day of Pentecost and he would preach,

220
00:16:50,319 --> 00:16:56,079
and you think about the roles of James and John in the early church and all that was

221
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:01,919
taking place, and the Lord Jesus Christ was investing in these three individuals.

222
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:07,519
We find in Matthew 26, turn there, if you will, and here in Matthew 26, we find that

223
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:14,079
we're on the, really, the eve of the crucifixion and all that takes place and the preparation

224
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:14,799
and all of that.

225
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:21,599
And we find that it was there in the beginning of this text of Scripture, in Matthew 26,

226
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:26,719
where it's spoken of Judas going to betray the Lord Jesus Christ.

227
00:17:26,719 --> 00:17:32,959
We find that Jesus mentions, as he's there at the Passover, about the fact that one that

228
00:17:32,959 --> 00:17:36,399
was there with them would be the one that would betray him.

229
00:17:36,399 --> 00:17:40,479
And we continue to read through, and we find that after they had observed that supper,

230
00:17:40,479 --> 00:17:44,959
it says in verse number 30, when they had sung a hymn, they went out into the Mount of Olives.

231
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:47,679
Now, what was Judas doing at this point?

232
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:51,919
Well, according to verse 25, he was the one that asked, is it I?

233
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:57,279
But then we find that later on he would leave to go out to make the deal to be able to betray

234
00:17:57,279 --> 00:17:58,079
Jesus.

235
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:03,359
But notice if you skip down, we find that as we're looking here throughout this text

236
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:06,719
of Scripture, Jesus is speaking to the disciples.

237
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:10,959
In verse 35, Peter said unto him, though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny

238
00:18:10,959 --> 00:18:11,599
thee.

239
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:13,839
Likewise, also said, what does it say there?

240
00:18:14,959 --> 00:18:16,639
All the disciples.

241
00:18:16,639 --> 00:18:17,119
All right?

242
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:18,639
So the 11 are there.

243
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:21,679
It says in verse 36, then cometh Jesus with them.

244
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:22,799
Now, what's them?

245
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,719
That's referring back to all the disciples.

246
00:18:24,719 --> 00:18:25,199
Do we agree?

247
00:18:25,199 --> 00:18:29,519
I'm not an English scholar, but we can see here that he's speaking about the 11 unto

248
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:31,359
a place called Gethsemane.

249
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:36,479
And he saith unto the disciples, again, this is the 11 of them, sit ye here while I go

250
00:18:36,479 --> 00:18:37,679
and pray yonder.

251
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,200
Look at verse 37.

252
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,760
And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee.

253
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,119
Now, who are the two sons of Zebedee?

254
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,799
Well, that's James and John.

255
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:50,079
And he takes them, and it says, and he began to be sorrowful and very heavy.

256
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:56,000
So Jesus leaves the other eight, and he takes those three, Peter, James, and John, as he

257
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,440
goes further in.

258
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,079
Jesus was purposed.

259
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:01,200
He was patient.

260
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,320
Oh, the patience that he had to have with the disciples as he trained them, and especially

261
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,200
with Peter.

262
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,599
And Peter is the one that's part of the inner circle.

263
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:10,559
He's being particular.

264
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:14,159
But Peter was, I mean, he had to be patient with Peter, right?

265
00:19:14,159 --> 00:19:16,880
And we find God's been patient with us.

266
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,320
I'm thankful for my mentors who have been patient with me.

267
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:27,039
I'm thankful for those that gave opportunity in order to develop that made purposed investment

268
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:27,839
in my life.

269
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:32,719
And so as we look here at 2 Timothy chapter number two, and we consider the investment

270
00:19:32,719 --> 00:19:38,799
of Paul, we ought to take a step back and say, praise the Lord that Paul was interested

271
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,599
in investing in the next generation.

272
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:47,919
You know, one thing that I think causes people to ignore or to disobey, really that's the

273
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:52,639
truth, is to disobey this portion of Scripture or this principle is pride.

274
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:59,760
I don't want to invest in someone else because they might become better than me.

275
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:04,160
I don't want to invest in that fellow to be the next preacher, because he might preach

276
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,320
better than I do.

277
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:09,840
I don't want to invest in that person to play the instrument, because they may play...

278
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,980
Pride's dangerous.

279
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:16,240
We preached on that on Wednesday evening, that we ought to walk humbly.

280
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,800
That was the message on Wednesday evening.

281
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:25,920
The reality is that there are times in which pride will cause us to disobey this principle.

282
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:30,480
Have you ever been in a situation where someone has a piece of knowledge that they want to

283
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,360
keep to themselves, they don't want to share it with anyone else?

284
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,360
Why?

285
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,880
Because they want to be the important person.

286
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:44,200
They don't want anyone else to know, because as long as they know it, then they are needed.

287
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,680
Have you been in a situation like that?

288
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:51,840
Can I tell you, as God's people, we must recognize that God's work is far greater than any of

289
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,840
us.

290
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,200
We need God.

291
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,520
God doesn't need us.

292
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:02,880
He's chosen to use us, and I can never understand it, but I just simply say, praise the Lord

293
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,680
that He would use us.

294
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:11,160
But the reality this morning is that He must increase and I must decrease.

295
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:18,120
We must acknowledge, we must recognize this morning, that the church, the work of God,

296
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:21,720
is greater than any one of us as an individual.

297
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,520
Paul had to understand.

298
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,800
It wasn't about Paul.

299
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:30,240
It was about Christ, and therefore, he's going to take what he had learned from Christ,

300
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,120
and he was going to teach, he was going to invest in others.

301
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:37,680
By the way, you understand you don't need to turn there, but Paul makes this statement

302
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:42,960
in Galatians chapter 1 and verse 11, but I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which

303
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,200
was preached of me is not after man.

304
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:52,120
Verse 12, for I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation

305
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,680
of Jesus Christ.

306
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:58,520
And so Paul understood that he had received the instruction from Christ, and now he's

307
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:01,520
investing in the future generation.

308
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:07,120
And by the way, if we're walking in humility, if we're understanding the work of God the

309
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:12,140
way that we ought to understand the work of God, our desire should be that the preacher

310
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:17,160
that I'm investing in would be a far better preacher than I am, that the musician that

311
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:20,360
I'm investing in would be a far better musician than I am.

312
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,360
Why?

313
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:26,880
Investing in them to do more, to do greater, to go further than we've ever done.

314
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,880
Does that not make sense?

315
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:36,480
We have a world to reach, we have a work to be done, and it's all to be for the glory

316
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:42,840
of God, not for the recognition of man, not for the glory of the individual.

317
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:47,360
And so we understand and consider the investment of Paul, understand number two, look at this

318
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,920
quickly with me this morning back in 2 Timothy 2.

319
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,320
Consider the instruction of Paul.

320
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:58,320
Paul made an investment, but then Paul gives instruction here in our text of Scripture.

321
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,800
He says in 2 Timothy 2 and verse number two,

322
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:07,960
And the things that thou hast heard of me, among many witnesses, the same commit thou

323
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:14,400
to faithful men who shall be able to teach others also.

324
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:20,840
Paul invested in Timothy, and now he's going to instruct Timothy to invest in others.

325
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,520
Timothy, it's now your turn.

326
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,600
Timothy, you're not going to be here forever.

327
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:31,000
Timothy, you're going to run the next leg of the race, but you're not going to finish

328
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,600
the entirety of the race.

329
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:37,040
He's going to finish his race, but the fact of the matter is that the church still needs

330
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,200
to go forward.

331
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:42,280
The work of God still is going to carry on.

332
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:46,880
My race will come to an end, your race will come to an end, but when we see it from a

333
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:53,680
bigger picture, when we see it from the perspective of God, the work of God continues.

334
00:23:53,680 --> 00:24:00,040
And so therefore, Paul is seeking to invest in Timothy, and then Paul is seeking to instruct

335
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,520
Timothy to invest in others.

336
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,680
Timothy was to be actively involved.

337
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:09,000
Timothy could not take a seat and just kind of be a spectator and say, well, we're just

338
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,240
going to see how things work.

339
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,920
It's just going to be on autopilot, it's just going to happen.

340
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:21,240
No, it's not going to happen without being purposed, without being purposed.

341
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,920
We find that Timothy was to be actively involved.

342
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,440
What was it that Timothy was to do?

343
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:30,119
Well, the Bible tells us that he had been taught and now he is to teach others.

344
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:31,119
What is it that he's to teach?

345
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:35,320
Well, he's to teach the same, the same.

346
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:39,600
We notice that right in the middle of the verse, it says, the same commit thou to faithful

347
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,960
men.

348
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,640
Now, I like that because he's to teach what he's been taught.

349
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,720
He's to teach the truth of God's Word.

350
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:49,880
I'm so thankful that I don't have to get up here every service, Sunday school, Sunday

351
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:54,360
morning, Sunday night, Wednesday night, and come up with my own ideas and my new ideas.

352
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:59,400
No, I simply get up and do what Paul is going to instruct Timothy to do in the fourth chapter

353
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,440
and to preach the Word.

354
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:08,600
Now my job, no doubt, is to study the Word and to be a student of the Word and to be

355
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:15,200
able to process and to bring and to give the truth of God's Word in a manner in which

356
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:21,480
it can be understood and a way in which it can be applied.

357
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:26,520
I taught on choices in Sunday school this morning and the fact is that every message

358
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:32,080
that I preach, every lesson that I teach, I'm desiring to bring people to a place of

359
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,400
decision.

360
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,200
There's a choice to be made.

361
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:43,200
We find that Joshua would say this in Joshua 24, choose you this day whom you will serve.

362
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,640
As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.

363
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,960
He made the choice, but he couldn't make the choice for anyone else.

364
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,000
He simply had to let them know that there was a choice to be made.

365
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,119
Moses draws a line in the sand and said, who is on the Lord's side?

366
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:01,480
Amen?

367
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:08,800
And we find this morning that Timothy has a responsibility to teach the same, to teach

368
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,880
the same.

369
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,240
There's nothing new under the sun.

370
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:17,600
I'm thankful that God's given us a complete canon of Scripture.

371
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,360
Sometimes you'll hear somebody say, I got something new for you.

372
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,480
Be careful.

373
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,640
Be careful.

374
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:31,040
Now are there times in which God reveals something to us that's known in His Word?

375
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,360
Sure, but it's new to me or it's new to you, sure.

376
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:37,880
But it's not something you've never seen or never heard or never know.

377
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,880
It's God's Word.

378
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:44,680
In fact, I think if you did some research, we've been going at this thing since the ascension

379
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:47,839
of Jesus Christ for 2,000 years now.

380
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:53,279
I think probably if you could do some research and say, has anyone ever preached or taught

381
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:57,760
this thought, you'd find that there's probably thousands of people that have preached and

382
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:02,480
taught that thought.

383
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,080
We find here this morning that Timothy had to be actively involved.

384
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:10,119
He had to be teaching.

385
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:15,240
If I think about this responsibility that is now given to Timothy, as I understand the

386
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:20,960
instruction that Paul is giving, Paul had already made an investment, but now he's instructing

387
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,960
Timothy.

388
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:25,119
Remember, Paul understood that he would soon die.

389
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:26,119
He's in prison.

390
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,000
He's awaiting a martyr's death.

391
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,800
At the end of the chapter, he said, the time of my departure is at hand, at the end of

392
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,240
the book in chapter four.

393
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,200
He knew, and so he's taking this opportunity.

394
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:40,400
Obviously, it's God's Word, so it's under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

395
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:44,320
but he's given this instruction, Timothy, you need to do this.

396
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,320
It's urgent.

397
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,320
It's imperative.

398
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:55,360
It is vital that you teach a next generation.

399
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,000
With that instruction comes responsibility.

400
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:05,160
Therefore, I say this, if I understand the responsibility, I better be a good student,

401
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:10,800
because if I need to teach others also, I better be ready to teach, amen?

402
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,720
I can't teach what I don't know.

403
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,320
Armando sitting down here in the front, Armando has a flooring business.

404
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,600
I've attempted to lay floor a couple of times.

405
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,440
I've never done carpet.

406
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:27,200
I've only done the little, I say simple, but it's not really simple.

407
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,920
There's obviously a lot of work involved in it, but the, you know, tongue and groove kind

408
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,520
of snap it together, floating floor.

409
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,520
That's the only thing I've ever done.

410
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,280
I've never done carpet.

411
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,280
I've never done hardwood.

412
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,320
I've never done any kind of tile work.

413
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:43,080
Somebody comes to me and says, hey, can you teach me how to do tile work?

414
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:47,280
No, I can't, because I don't know how to do it.

415
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:52,160
But if you go to Armando and say, can you teach me how to do this?

416
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,160
Armando could teach.

417
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,160
Why?

418
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:58,200
Because he knows he's been taught and he does it.

419
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:02,880
So if I go to Armando and say, Armando, would you teach me so that I could then teach somebody

420
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,880
else?

421
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:09,160
Well, I better be a good student if I'm going to teach him.

422
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:17,640
This morning, the Christian life is so important that we're fully in and we're understanding

423
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:22,160
this great responsibility that God has given to us.

424
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:28,140
There is a generation of people coming after us, and how can we teach them if we ourselves

425
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,220
do not know the truth?

426
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:36,119
How can we invest in them the same things if we don't even know the things of God's

427
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:37,119
Word?

428
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:38,919
We must be a good student.

429
00:29:38,919 --> 00:29:43,919
And I'll tell you this, when we understand the responsibility, it helps us to understand

430
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:49,000
I better be a good student because I have this responsibility to teach someone else.

431
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,760
Teach them in such a way that they then will be able to teach others.

432
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,040
Is that not what the verse says?

433
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:59,479
Notice, the same commit thou to faithful men.

434
00:29:59,479 --> 00:30:05,979
who shall be able to teach others also."

435
00:30:05,979 --> 00:30:06,979
I'm not God.

436
00:30:06,979 --> 00:30:08,979
I never can tell somebody else

437
00:30:08,979 --> 00:30:12,279
what the will of God is for their lives.

438
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:14,279
I'm not God.

439
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:16,279
By the way, I'm thankful, and so are you.

440
00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:18,279
And you're not God.

441
00:30:18,279 --> 00:30:22,079
Amen?

442
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:28,279
I've purposed to try to invest in people.

443
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:30,279
In the last several months,

444
00:30:30,279 --> 00:30:33,279
it's not happened for various reasons,

445
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:35,779
mostly schedule-wise.

446
00:30:35,779 --> 00:30:37,779
But I took some time

447
00:30:37,779 --> 00:30:40,779
over a period of months

448
00:30:40,779 --> 00:30:43,279
to specifically sit down

449
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:46,779
and to invest in these two young men.

450
00:30:46,779 --> 00:30:49,279
One's my son.

451
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:52,779
One's your son.

452
00:30:52,779 --> 00:30:54,279
I don't know what God's going to do

453
00:30:54,279 --> 00:30:55,779
with either one of them,

454
00:30:55,779 --> 00:30:58,779
but I know they're a lot younger than I am.

455
00:30:58,779 --> 00:31:00,779
Tim's going to be 18 this week.

456
00:31:00,779 --> 00:31:03,279
Joseph will be 18 in December.

457
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:04,779
I don't know what God's going to do

458
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:06,279
with either one of them,

459
00:31:06,279 --> 00:31:09,779
but they were interested.

460
00:31:09,779 --> 00:31:14,279
And I sat down for hours

461
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:18,279
and purposefully invested in them

462
00:31:18,279 --> 00:31:21,279
in such a way

463
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:24,779
that they could teach somebody else.

464
00:31:24,779 --> 00:31:29,279
Not just so that they could know it for themselves.

465
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:32,279
I was purposed.

466
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:35,279
Did it take time? Absolutely.

467
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:37,279
Absolutely.

468
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:38,779
But it was worth it.

469
00:31:38,779 --> 00:31:40,279
It's an investment.

470
00:31:40,279 --> 00:31:43,279
It's an investment.

471
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:45,779
We must understand

472
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:48,779
the instruction that Paul is giving.

473
00:31:48,779 --> 00:31:50,779
Listen, I'm not going to be the pastor here forever.

474
00:31:50,779 --> 00:31:52,279
I don't know who will be the next pastor.

475
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:53,279
I'm only 44.

476
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,279
If I don't get excited, then I'm leaving soon.

477
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:57,279
But the reality is that I know

478
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:00,279
I'm not going to be here forever.

479
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:02,779
And therefore, I must be purposed.

480
00:32:02,779 --> 00:32:04,779
I can't tell you he's not here this morning,

481
00:32:04,779 --> 00:32:07,279
but I can't tell you how many countless hours

482
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:10,279
I spent with Fernando.

483
00:32:10,279 --> 00:32:13,279
Why? Because he was hungry.

484
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:14,779
When Fernando came to our church,

485
00:32:14,779 --> 00:32:16,279
he had never been in a Baptist church

486
00:32:16,279 --> 00:32:19,279
one day in his life.

487
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:21,779
Not one.

488
00:32:21,779 --> 00:32:23,279
And he showed up, and actually,

489
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:24,779
Ronnie met him in Walmart.

490
00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:27,279
He was in the book section.

491
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:28,779
Ronnie meets people at Walmart all the time.

492
00:32:28,779 --> 00:32:30,279
Amen?

493
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:32,779
I don't meet anyone at Walmart.

494
00:32:32,779 --> 00:32:34,279
I try to go in and get out.

495
00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:35,279
Amen?

496
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:36,779
And I have a different perspective

497
00:32:36,779 --> 00:32:39,279
of going to Walmart than I do going to church.

498
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:40,779
I don't come to church to get out of church,

499
00:32:40,779 --> 00:32:42,779
but I go to Walmart to get out of Walmart.

500
00:32:42,779 --> 00:32:43,779
Amen?

501
00:32:43,779 --> 00:32:45,779
And I'm trying to get in and out as fast as I can.

502
00:32:45,779 --> 00:32:47,279
Ronnie meets people.

503
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:48,779
He just does.

504
00:32:48,779 --> 00:32:50,279
And he met Fernando.

505
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:51,279
And Ronnie came and said,

506
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:53,779
hey, I got a number of this guy, blah, blah, blah,

507
00:32:53,779 --> 00:32:55,279
and whatever, whatever.

508
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:58,279
And Fernando calls me one day.

509
00:32:58,279 --> 00:32:59,779
Never been here.

510
00:32:59,779 --> 00:33:01,779
And I said, hey, listen, maybe we should meet.

511
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:04,779
And he came to my office one day.

512
00:33:04,779 --> 00:33:08,279
He'd never been in a Baptist church.

513
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:09,279
And he showed up.

514
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:12,279
He told me his testimony of salvation.

515
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:14,279
He revealed to me that he'd never been to a Baptist church.

516
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:19,279
There was a level of fear of the unknown.

517
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:23,279
I mean, just simple things, right?

518
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:26,279
So I told him, hey, we're one of the most friendly churches

519
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:27,279
you'll ever meet.

520
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:29,279
And I was hoping that would be the case.

521
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:30,279
No, I'm just kidding.

522
00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:31,279
I knew.

523
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:32,279
We're a friendly church.

524
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:33,279
We love people.

525
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:35,279
We love one another.

526
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,279
And Fernando said, I don't know much about the Bible.

527
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:38,279
I want to learn.

528
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:41,279
He'd never read the Bible through at that point.

529
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:45,279
I began to sit down with him every week for hours

530
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:48,279
and invest in him across the table, he and I,

531
00:33:48,279 --> 00:33:50,279
just the two of us.

532
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:53,279
I don't know what God's going to do with Fernando.

533
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:55,279
I have no idea.

534
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:58,279
But I know that God allowed a time, a season,

535
00:33:58,279 --> 00:33:59,279
for me to invest in him.

536
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:02,279
And I want him to be able to teach others also.

537
00:34:02,279 --> 00:34:03,279
Fernando's 20.

538
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:05,279
I think 21.

539
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:06,279
He's a little bit older than these guys,

540
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:09,279
but he's still a lot younger than I am.

541
00:34:09,279 --> 00:34:11,279
And I want to invest in him.

542
00:34:11,279 --> 00:34:13,279
I don't know what God's going to do with him.

543
00:34:13,279 --> 00:34:14,279
But I know he had to grow.

544
00:34:14,279 --> 00:34:15,279
He had to learn.

545
00:34:15,279 --> 00:34:19,279
I remember him asking questions.

546
00:34:19,279 --> 00:34:22,279
He's not here, and I don't think this would embarrass him.

547
00:34:22,279 --> 00:34:25,279
I was in the same place, and you were in the same place

548
00:34:25,279 --> 00:34:28,279
when you first got saved too, by the way.

549
00:34:28,279 --> 00:34:33,279
He didn't know who the two good spies were.

550
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:34,279
Is that fair?

551
00:34:34,279 --> 00:34:36,279
He didn't know who they were.

552
00:34:36,279 --> 00:34:38,279
But can I tell you, there was a day that I didn't know

553
00:34:38,279 --> 00:34:40,279
who they were either.

554
00:34:40,279 --> 00:34:42,279
We sing the song, 12 men went to spy on Cain,

555
00:34:42,279 --> 00:34:43,279
and 10 were bad, 2 were good.

556
00:34:43,279 --> 00:34:44,279
And then we asked the little kids,

557
00:34:44,279 --> 00:34:46,279
Lydia, who were the two good spies?

558
00:34:46,279 --> 00:34:48,279
And she says, they were Joshua and Caleb.

559
00:34:48,279 --> 00:34:50,279
Grew up in church.

560
00:34:50,279 --> 00:34:52,279
Knows the account.

561
00:34:52,279 --> 00:34:54,279
I sat in Bible college the first day.

562
00:34:54,279 --> 00:34:56,279
I mean, I remember my first semester in Bible college.

563
00:34:56,279 --> 00:34:58,279
I didn't even know that God parted the Red Sea.

564
00:34:58,279 --> 00:34:59,279
We're listening about the Red Sea parting,

565
00:34:59,279 --> 00:35:02,279
and I'm like, this is awesome.

566
00:35:02,279 --> 00:35:04,279
And I got guys sitting there like,

567
00:35:04,279 --> 00:35:05,279
heard this 100 times.

568
00:35:05,279 --> 00:35:07,279
I'm like, are you kidding me?

569
00:35:07,279 --> 00:35:09,279
This is awesome.

570
00:35:09,279 --> 00:35:10,279
Because it is.

571
00:35:10,279 --> 00:35:12,279
It's our God.

572
00:35:12,279 --> 00:35:14,279
You know what I did with Fernando?

573
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:17,279
I didn't tell him who the two good spies were.

574
00:35:17,279 --> 00:35:21,279
I said, look, when you get to the book of Numbers,

575
00:35:21,279 --> 00:35:25,279
you'll read chapters 13 and 14,

576
00:35:25,279 --> 00:35:27,279
and when you get there,

577
00:35:27,279 --> 00:35:28,279
if you still don't know who they are,

578
00:35:28,279 --> 00:35:30,279
you come talk to me.

579
00:35:30,279 --> 00:35:31,279
And I was meeting with him every week,

580
00:35:31,279 --> 00:35:32,279
and I'd say to him every week,

581
00:35:32,279 --> 00:35:35,279
where are you in your Bible reading?

582
00:35:35,279 --> 00:35:36,279
I just finished up the book of Genesis,

583
00:35:36,279 --> 00:35:37,279
I'm starting Exodus.

584
00:35:37,279 --> 00:35:38,279
Okay, good.

585
00:35:38,279 --> 00:35:39,279
Where are you in your Bible reading?

586
00:35:39,279 --> 00:35:40,279
Well, I just finished Exodus,

587
00:35:40,279 --> 00:35:41,279
I'm in the book of Numbers.

588
00:35:41,279 --> 00:35:42,279
Oh, good, you're getting close.

589
00:35:42,279 --> 00:35:43,279
You got that bookmark there, right?

590
00:35:43,279 --> 00:35:46,279
Oh, yeah, I got the bookmark there.

591
00:35:46,279 --> 00:35:48,279
And you might think this is silly,

592
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:50,279
but this is investment.

593
00:35:50,279 --> 00:35:53,279
This is being patient.

594
00:35:53,279 --> 00:35:54,279
It's what it is.

595
00:35:54,279 --> 00:35:56,279
It's the work of the ministry.

596
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:59,279
And I remember when he read those chapters,

597
00:35:59,279 --> 00:36:03,279
he said, I know who the two good spies are.

598
00:36:03,279 --> 00:36:06,279
Joshua and Caleb.

599
00:36:06,279 --> 00:36:08,279
That's big stuff.

600
00:36:08,279 --> 00:36:10,279
It's a little truth

601
00:36:10,279 --> 00:36:12,279
that sometimes we take for granted.

602
00:36:12,279 --> 00:36:13,279
But I guarantee you,

603
00:36:13,279 --> 00:36:15,279
you can go around to a lot of places today,

604
00:36:15,279 --> 00:36:17,279
and you can talk about 12 spies,

605
00:36:17,279 --> 00:36:19,279
they don't even know what you're talking about.

606
00:36:19,279 --> 00:36:20,279
In fact, you can go to some churches today

607
00:36:20,279 --> 00:36:22,279
that don't even preach the Bible,

608
00:36:22,279 --> 00:36:23,279
because there's a lot of churches out there

609
00:36:23,279 --> 00:36:25,279
that are just for entertainment.

610
00:36:25,279 --> 00:36:27,279
That's not what this is called to do.

611
00:36:27,279 --> 00:36:30,279
This is not entertaining, this is investing.

612
00:36:30,279 --> 00:36:32,279
And we see the instruction that Paul gives,

613
00:36:32,279 --> 00:36:34,279
and Paul gives this instruction,

614
00:36:34,279 --> 00:36:37,279
and Timothy must embrace and he must follow.

615
00:36:37,279 --> 00:36:39,279
And I'll say this in closing this morning,

616
00:36:39,279 --> 00:36:40,279
number three,

617
00:36:40,279 --> 00:36:41,279
we must consider the importance

618
00:36:41,279 --> 00:36:44,279
of following this principle.

619
00:36:44,279 --> 00:36:45,279
We consider the investment,

620
00:36:45,279 --> 00:36:46,279
we consider the instruction,

621
00:36:46,279 --> 00:36:48,279
and then we must consider the importance

622
00:36:48,279 --> 00:36:50,279
for ourselves individually

623
00:36:50,279 --> 00:36:52,279
that we would follow the principle

624
00:36:52,279 --> 00:36:54,279
that God set forth in 2 Timothy 2,

625
00:36:54,279 --> 00:36:56,279
in verse number two.

626
00:36:56,279 --> 00:36:57,279
It's not a principle

627
00:36:57,279 --> 00:36:59,279
that was exclusively for Timothy, no.

628
00:36:59,279 --> 00:37:02,279
It's a pattern that Jesus established

629
00:37:02,279 --> 00:37:04,279
in his word that God is giving

630
00:37:04,279 --> 00:37:06,279
to Timothy through Paul.

631
00:37:06,279 --> 00:37:07,279
It is this principle

632
00:37:07,279 --> 00:37:10,279
that must continue to be employed today.

633
00:37:10,279 --> 00:37:12,279
It is absolutely vital,

634
00:37:12,279 --> 00:37:13,279
it's absolutely imperative

635
00:37:13,279 --> 00:37:15,279
that we as the people of God

636
00:37:15,279 --> 00:37:20,279
follow this principle in our lives.

637
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:26,279
How did we get the truth that we have?

638
00:37:26,279 --> 00:37:27,279
God gave it,

639
00:37:27,279 --> 00:37:30,279
and then generations of believers

640
00:37:30,279 --> 00:37:34,279
followed this principle.

641
00:37:34,279 --> 00:37:36,279
They tried to stamp out Christianity,

642
00:37:36,279 --> 00:37:38,279
they tried to outlaw the Bible,

643
00:37:38,279 --> 00:37:40,279
they tried to burn the Bible.

644
00:37:40,279 --> 00:37:41,279
If you study anything

645
00:37:41,279 --> 00:37:42,279
about the English Bible

646
00:37:42,279 --> 00:37:44,279
and how we got our Bible,

647
00:37:44,279 --> 00:37:45,279
and the way in which many people

648
00:37:45,279 --> 00:37:46,279
were martyred,

649
00:37:46,279 --> 00:37:48,279
were killed for the faith,

650
00:37:48,279 --> 00:37:49,279
those that even simply

651
00:37:49,279 --> 00:37:51,279
had a copy of the Bible,

652
00:37:51,279 --> 00:37:52,279
if they were found with it,

653
00:37:52,279 --> 00:37:53,279
they would be imprisoned

654
00:37:53,279 --> 00:37:55,279
or worse, put to death.

655
00:37:55,279 --> 00:37:56,279
And they did all of that.

656
00:37:56,279 --> 00:37:57,279
Why?

657
00:37:57,279 --> 00:38:00,279
So somebody could have a Bible.

658
00:38:00,279 --> 00:38:01,279
We don't understand

659
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,279
that level of investment today.

660
00:38:03,279 --> 00:38:04,279
We truly don't.

661
00:38:04,279 --> 00:38:06,279
It's really easy today.

662
00:38:06,279 --> 00:38:07,279
And maybe that's part of the reason

663
00:38:07,279 --> 00:38:12,279
that we've dropped the ball.

664
00:38:12,279 --> 00:38:15,279
And we find here

665
00:38:15,279 --> 00:38:17,279
this principle that God gives us,

666
00:38:17,279 --> 00:38:19,279
but it's absolutely imperative

667
00:38:19,279 --> 00:38:21,279
that each of us this morning

668
00:38:21,279 --> 00:38:23,279
take ownership of this principle,

669
00:38:23,279 --> 00:38:25,279
that we not only understand it,

670
00:38:25,279 --> 00:38:26,279
but we apply it,

671
00:38:26,279 --> 00:38:28,279
we introduce the truth

672
00:38:28,279 --> 00:38:29,279
in our own lives,

673
00:38:29,279 --> 00:38:31,279
and we incorporate the truth

674
00:38:31,279 --> 00:38:32,279
in our very lives,

675
00:38:32,279 --> 00:38:34,279
and we practice,

676
00:38:34,279 --> 00:38:36,279
we follow this principle

677
00:38:36,279 --> 00:38:38,279
in our lives.

678
00:38:38,279 --> 00:38:40,279
We could ask simply this morning,

679
00:38:40,279 --> 00:38:41,279
and I'd never want you

680
00:38:41,279 --> 00:38:43,279
to show a raised hand

681
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:45,279
or to offer an audible answer,

682
00:38:45,279 --> 00:38:47,279
but I ask you this morning,

683
00:38:47,279 --> 00:38:49,279
if you were to examine your life,

684
00:38:49,279 --> 00:38:51,279
if you were to consider this morning,

685
00:38:51,279 --> 00:38:56,279
who are you investing in?

686
00:38:56,279 --> 00:38:58,279
If you've been given this principle,

687
00:38:58,279 --> 00:38:59,279
this truth, you say,

688
00:38:59,279 --> 00:39:00,279
no, it's written to Timothy,

689
00:39:00,279 --> 00:39:02,279
it's preserved for us,

690
00:39:02,279 --> 00:39:04,279
and the principle is applicable to us,

691
00:39:04,279 --> 00:39:07,279
who are you investing in?

692
00:39:07,279 --> 00:39:10,279
Who are you taking and teaching

693
00:39:10,279 --> 00:39:12,279
and sharing truth

694
00:39:12,279 --> 00:39:14,279
and leading them along?

695
00:39:14,279 --> 00:39:17,279
We call it discipleship.

696
00:39:17,279 --> 00:39:18,279
Who are we discipling?

697
00:39:18,279 --> 00:39:19,279
Who are we training?

698
00:39:19,279 --> 00:39:21,279
Who are we teaching?

699
00:39:21,279 --> 00:39:23,279
Because one day,

700
00:39:23,279 --> 00:39:25,279
I'm not going to be here anymore.

701
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:28,279
You're not going to be here anymore.

702
00:39:28,279 --> 00:39:29,279
And we have to understand

703
00:39:29,279 --> 00:39:30,279
the importance of following

704
00:39:30,279 --> 00:39:32,279
this principle in our own lives.

705
00:39:32,279 --> 00:39:33,279
Let me say it this way,

706
00:39:33,279 --> 00:39:34,279
two thoughts.

707
00:39:34,279 --> 00:39:35,279
One, yes, it's true

708
00:39:35,279 --> 00:39:37,279
that we ought to follow this principle

709
00:39:37,279 --> 00:39:39,279
in the house of the Lord,

710
00:39:39,279 --> 00:39:40,279
in the house of the Lord.

711
00:39:40,279 --> 00:39:41,279
This is given to Timothy.

712
00:39:41,279 --> 00:39:43,279
He's the pastor at the church at Ephesus.

713
00:39:43,279 --> 00:39:45,279
We read of the church at Ephesus

714
00:39:45,279 --> 00:39:46,279
in Revelation chapter 2.

715
00:39:46,279 --> 00:39:47,279
There's much that we read

716
00:39:47,279 --> 00:39:48,279
of the church at Ephesus.

717
00:39:48,279 --> 00:39:50,279
In fact, the book of Ephesians

718
00:39:50,279 --> 00:39:52,279
is a book that's written there

719
00:39:52,279 --> 00:39:53,279
to those believers,

720
00:39:53,279 --> 00:39:54,279
and we have much insight

721
00:39:54,279 --> 00:39:55,279
that God gives us,

722
00:39:55,279 --> 00:39:57,279
and no doubt that even

723
00:39:57,279 --> 00:39:58,279
as we understood,

724
00:39:58,279 --> 00:39:59,279
as we studied,

725
00:39:59,279 --> 00:40:03,579
the first book, 1 Timothy chapter 3 and verse 15,

726
00:40:03,579 --> 00:40:06,079
but if I tarry long that thou mayest know how thou oughtest

727
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:07,739
to behave thyself in the house of God,

728
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:09,379
which is the church of the living God,

729
00:40:09,379 --> 00:40:10,699
the pillar and ground of the truth.

730
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:15,119
And so we understand that Timothy had an awareness

731
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:18,199
of the responsibility within the house of the Lord

732
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:20,999
of this principally being employed

733
00:40:20,999 --> 00:40:22,159
within the house of the Lord.

734
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:24,239
Let me draw your attention to the book of Jude.

735
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:25,659
You can leave 2 Timothy,

736
00:40:25,659 --> 00:40:28,539
look over at the book of Jude, if you will.

737
00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:33,119
Just one chapter in the book of Jude and a short chapter,

738
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:38,119
but the content is absolutely impactful and powerful.

739
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:39,959
It's amazing what God can give us

740
00:40:39,959 --> 00:40:42,219
in 25 verses of scripture.

741
00:40:42,219 --> 00:40:44,619
In Jude chapter number one, there's only one chapter.

742
00:40:44,619 --> 00:40:48,499
The Bible says this in verse three, Jude verse three,

743
00:40:48,499 --> 00:40:51,619
beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you

744
00:40:51,619 --> 00:40:54,299
the common salvation, it was needful for me to write

745
00:40:54,299 --> 00:40:57,499
unto you and to exhort you that you should earnestly

746
00:40:57,499 --> 00:40:59,659
contend for the faith, which was once delivered

747
00:40:59,659 --> 00:41:02,299
unto the saints, for there are certain men crept

748
00:41:02,299 --> 00:41:04,579
in unawares who were before of old ordained

749
00:41:04,579 --> 00:41:07,499
to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace

750
00:41:07,499 --> 00:41:09,779
of our God into lasciviousness and denying

751
00:41:09,779 --> 00:41:13,399
the only Lord God and our Lord, Jesus Christ.

752
00:41:13,399 --> 00:41:15,599
Can I tell you that just in the first century,

753
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:17,859
how these certain men crept in unawares,

754
00:41:17,859 --> 00:41:20,119
it's continued throughout the church age.

755
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:23,659
And can I tell you that they're, as I mentioned

756
00:41:23,659 --> 00:41:25,419
by way of introduction, they're peddling

757
00:41:25,419 --> 00:41:26,679
their false teaching.

758
00:41:27,499 --> 00:41:29,579
They're propagating their false teaching.

759
00:41:29,579 --> 00:41:34,579
They're using, I have quotes that I could share with you

760
00:41:34,739 --> 00:41:39,579
from those that are of an ungodly perspective,

761
00:41:39,579 --> 00:41:41,779
and they talk about using the classroom

762
00:41:41,779 --> 00:41:44,539
of the public school arena as their place,

763
00:41:44,539 --> 00:41:48,019
their pulpit, just as they would use in any church

764
00:41:48,019 --> 00:41:51,619
from any pastor, any clergyman, that they indoctrinate

765
00:41:51,619 --> 00:41:55,379
the next generation, and they speak about humanism

766
00:41:55,419 --> 00:42:00,419
being religion, it is, and that's what they're pushing.

767
00:42:02,499 --> 00:42:06,499
And by the way, if you look at the block of young people

768
00:42:06,499 --> 00:42:11,499
in our nation, you can see how successful they have been

769
00:42:11,979 --> 00:42:16,679
on indoctrinating the minds of the next generation.

770
00:42:19,659 --> 00:42:21,379
These men crept in unawares, so what are we to do?

771
00:42:21,379 --> 00:42:24,299
Well, we're to earnestly contend for the faith

772
00:42:24,299 --> 00:42:27,019
that was once delivered unto the saints,

773
00:42:27,019 --> 00:42:30,139
and we like, and I've never run a race

774
00:42:30,139 --> 00:42:33,779
that's the passing of the baton, a relay kind of race

775
00:42:33,779 --> 00:42:35,219
with one person doing one leg.

776
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:37,619
I've never done it, I'm not a runner,

777
00:42:37,619 --> 00:42:40,139
but the reality is that I understand how it works,

778
00:42:40,139 --> 00:42:43,419
and if I'm going to do the four by whatever race I'm doing,

779
00:42:43,419 --> 00:42:45,799
I run my leg of the race with my baton,

780
00:42:45,799 --> 00:42:47,539
and I hand it to the next person

781
00:42:47,539 --> 00:42:49,459
who's gonna run their leg of the race.

782
00:42:51,139 --> 00:42:53,079
I think, I didn't watch the Olympics,

783
00:42:53,079 --> 00:42:55,799
I watched a little tiny bit of the two basketball games,

784
00:42:55,799 --> 00:42:57,999
but I didn't watch the Olympics as a whole.

785
00:42:59,919 --> 00:43:01,599
I think, from what I read,

786
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:04,819
our team dropped the baton at one point.

787
00:43:05,919 --> 00:43:09,779
That's a disaster, it's a disaster.

788
00:43:09,779 --> 00:43:13,839
You're not gonna win the race if you drop the baton.

789
00:43:17,319 --> 00:43:18,759
I was at a pastor's meeting on Tuesday,

790
00:43:18,759 --> 00:43:21,039
and I made a comment, Mike Aylstock actually was

791
00:43:21,039 --> 00:43:22,639
one of the guys that preached, I made a comment,

792
00:43:23,199 --> 00:43:25,439
we were talking after the service,

793
00:43:25,439 --> 00:43:29,119
I think Brother Aylstock, 70, 71, 72, something like that,

794
00:43:30,039 --> 00:43:31,239
and here's what he said,

795
00:43:32,639 --> 00:43:35,759
I don't wanna mess up the baton pass.

796
00:43:35,759 --> 00:43:39,759
I don't wanna mess up the baton pass.

797
00:43:39,759 --> 00:43:44,759
Yeah, it's vital, but it's not just in the house of God,

798
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:49,119
it's in your house, and it's in my house.

799
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:51,239
Look over to the book of Ephesians, if you will.

800
00:43:51,239 --> 00:43:53,599
Ephesians chapter number six, and I want you to notice,

801
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:55,759
it's a familiar passage of scripture to us,

802
00:43:55,759 --> 00:43:57,519
but I want you to notice what God tells us,

803
00:43:57,519 --> 00:44:00,719
because in our house, it's not just in the house of God,

804
00:44:00,719 --> 00:44:03,999
although it's true that it should be in the house of God,

805
00:44:03,999 --> 00:44:06,439
that we're investing in the next generation,

806
00:44:06,439 --> 00:44:07,599
but it must be in your house.

807
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:10,079
By the way, let me say this, it starts at your house.

808
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:11,719
It starts at my house.

809
00:44:11,719 --> 00:44:14,919
Do you know how easy it is for you to undermine

810
00:44:14,919 --> 00:44:18,279
at your home what the preacher says in one hour,

811
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:22,519
when you have all day and all night and all week?

812
00:44:22,519 --> 00:44:27,039
It's super simple to undermine the teaching of God's word

813
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:29,759
that is given from the pulpit,

814
00:44:29,759 --> 00:44:33,579
from the classroom throughout the week.

815
00:44:33,579 --> 00:44:36,079
The amount of time that someone spends in church

816
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:38,879
is so limited with regard to the amount of time

817
00:44:38,879 --> 00:44:41,359
that someone spends at their home,

818
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:43,439
and it's so vital that we understand

819
00:44:43,439 --> 00:44:44,799
that it begins at your house.

820
00:44:45,639 --> 00:44:50,639
Really, the idea is that we would have the opportunity

821
00:44:50,799 --> 00:44:54,699
to be able to enforce and to reinforce

822
00:44:54,699 --> 00:44:56,959
the message that's being taught at home,

823
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:58,519
and the message that's being taught at home,

824
00:44:58,519 --> 00:45:00,159
and the message that's being taught in the church,

825
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:03,119
they're of the same message,

826
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:05,639
and they're reinforcing one another.

827
00:45:05,639 --> 00:45:07,019
I'm not gonna ask you to turn there,

828
00:45:07,019 --> 00:45:10,279
but in Psalm 106, the Bible says this in verse 25,

829
00:45:10,279 --> 00:45:12,919
but murmured in their tents,

830
00:45:12,919 --> 00:45:15,399
and hearken not unto the voice of the Lord.

831
00:45:15,399 --> 00:45:16,599
You know what their tent was?

832
00:45:16,599 --> 00:45:18,859
It was their house, it was their dwelling place,

833
00:45:18,859 --> 00:45:20,599
and they murmured there,

834
00:45:20,599 --> 00:45:24,039
and it caused a great impact on the next generation.

835
00:45:24,039 --> 00:45:27,119
You read Psalm 106, and you see it laid out there,

836
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:28,919
and we find here in Ephesians six,

837
00:45:28,919 --> 00:45:30,839
the Bible says this in verse number four,

838
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:33,559
and ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath,

839
00:45:33,559 --> 00:45:34,379
but do what?

840
00:45:34,379 --> 00:45:39,379
Bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.

841
00:45:40,379 --> 00:45:43,139
It's a great responsibility.

842
00:45:43,139 --> 00:45:45,219
It's a great responsibility.

843
00:45:45,219 --> 00:45:46,579
It's a great privilege.

844
00:45:48,059 --> 00:45:52,059
This morning, when we look at this passage of Scripture,

845
00:45:53,819 --> 00:45:58,139
this vital truth that begins 2 Timothy chapter number two,

846
00:45:59,259 --> 00:46:00,579
teach others also,

847
00:46:01,699 --> 00:46:03,539
our response to this truth

848
00:46:05,059 --> 00:46:08,339
will have long-lasting consequences.

849
00:46:09,259 --> 00:46:11,979
Whether we respond by embracing

850
00:46:15,099 --> 00:46:18,179
and actively being engaged in investing,

851
00:46:18,179 --> 00:46:19,779
or respond by ignoring and saying,

852
00:46:19,779 --> 00:46:22,219
you know, somebody else can do that.

853
00:46:23,419 --> 00:46:24,719
Somebody else can do that.

854
00:46:27,179 --> 00:46:28,979
The consequences are long-lasting,

855
00:46:30,419 --> 00:46:33,019
and we see what's happening in our generation today.

856
00:46:36,019 --> 00:46:37,099
How did we get here?

857
00:46:38,939 --> 00:46:40,619
How did we get here?

858
00:46:40,619 --> 00:46:42,619
I talked to a man at his door years ago.

859
00:46:44,339 --> 00:46:46,299
Asked him if he knew for sure that heaven was his home,

860
00:46:46,299 --> 00:46:51,299
and he was a little bit contentious, if you will,

861
00:46:51,479 --> 00:46:55,459
and you can't really know that, and so on and so forth,

862
00:46:55,459 --> 00:46:58,859
and I said, and he said something about, you know,

863
00:46:58,859 --> 00:47:00,859
just be sincere, everything, you know,

864
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:02,739
as long as you're sincere, you'll just make it,

865
00:47:02,739 --> 00:47:05,339
and I said, well, actually, Jesus said in John 14,

866
00:47:05,419 --> 00:47:08,179
I am the way, and as I got right there,

867
00:47:08,179 --> 00:47:10,339
he said the truth and the life,

868
00:47:10,339 --> 00:47:13,139
no man cometh unto the Father but by me.

869
00:47:13,139 --> 00:47:15,299
He finished quoting the verse of Scripture.

870
00:47:16,779 --> 00:47:20,219
I was like, wow, how'd you know that verse?

871
00:47:20,219 --> 00:47:21,219
Oh, I grew up in Sunday school,

872
00:47:21,219 --> 00:47:22,499
I grew up in a church just like yours,

873
00:47:22,499 --> 00:47:24,499
but I don't believe any of that anymore.

874
00:47:27,019 --> 00:47:28,779
I don't believe any of that anymore.

875
00:47:29,939 --> 00:47:31,799
I had hours of conversation with that man

876
00:47:31,799 --> 00:47:35,559
over the next few weeks, and unfortunately,

877
00:47:35,559 --> 00:47:38,599
that man completely just threw away

878
00:47:38,599 --> 00:47:40,199
everything that he'd ever heard,

879
00:47:41,399 --> 00:47:43,919
and was following a new religion,

880
00:47:43,919 --> 00:47:46,919
the religion of humanism, really, is what he was following,

881
00:47:47,799 --> 00:47:51,319
and this morning, we must understand

882
00:47:51,319 --> 00:47:55,119
this truth of investing, teaching others also,

883
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:57,919
investing in the future generation.

884
00:47:57,919 --> 00:47:59,519
None of us will be here forever,

885
00:48:00,519 --> 00:48:03,399
but God's work, until the rapture,

886
00:48:05,239 --> 00:48:08,159
our prayer is that the work of God continues on.

887
00:48:08,159 --> 00:48:09,559
Now, I hope I'm here for the rapture,

888
00:48:09,559 --> 00:48:12,519
but the reality is that generations of believers

889
00:48:12,519 --> 00:48:15,279
have anticipated being here for the rapture,

890
00:48:16,999 --> 00:48:18,359
and if I'm not here for the rapture,

891
00:48:18,359 --> 00:48:22,199
I want there to be a church in Oakden, Virginia

892
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:24,839
that stands for the truth of the gospel,

893
00:48:25,519 --> 00:48:29,959
that continues to do what God has called us to do.

894
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:33,959
We must teach others also.

895
00:48:33,959 --> 00:48:34,799
Let's pray together.

896
00:48:34,799 --> 00:48:35,639
Father, we love you.

897
00:48:35,639 --> 00:48:37,079
We thank you for loving us.

898
00:48:37,079 --> 00:48:41,399
Thank you for your word, the truth contained therein.

899
00:48:41,399 --> 00:48:46,399
Lord, I think the truth has been plainly given this morning.

900
00:48:46,479 --> 00:48:48,359
We're either actively involved

901
00:48:48,359 --> 00:48:50,519
in investing in others, or we're not.

902
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:52,759
Maybe there's someone this morning

903
00:48:52,759 --> 00:48:55,359
that's not actively involved, but they want to be,

904
00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:56,879
they desire to be.

905
00:48:56,879 --> 00:49:00,879
Lord, I pray that you would help them to have opportunity

906
00:49:00,879 --> 00:49:03,799
to be able to actively invest in others.

907
00:49:05,039 --> 00:49:08,559
Lord, I pray that you would use us

908
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:10,559
for your honor and for your glory,

909
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:13,359
as we seek to teach others also.

910
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:15,599
I pray that you'd have your will and way

911
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:18,079
in the lives of those who are in need,

912
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,039
that you'd have your will and way

913
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:22,079
in the lives of those that are gathered this morning,

914
00:49:23,079 --> 00:49:26,279
that decisions would be made that would please thee.

915
00:49:26,279 --> 00:49:27,879
We'll thank you for it.

916
00:49:27,879 --> 00:49:28,839
In Christ's name we pray.

917
00:49:28,839 --> 00:49:30,239
Would you stand with me?

918
00:49:30,239 --> 00:49:31,359
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

919
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:34,039
Kimberly's gonna play quietly on the piano.

920
00:49:34,039 --> 00:49:36,559
As she plays, the altar is open.

921
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:40,119
Maybe you're not investing in others as you should be,

922
00:49:40,119 --> 00:49:42,879
and you want to confess that to the Lord

923
00:49:42,879 --> 00:49:44,279
and ask God to give you an opportunity.

924
00:49:44,279 --> 00:49:45,839
Maybe you are investing, and you pray

925
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:48,279
that God would continue to give you opportunity.

926
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:51,759
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
