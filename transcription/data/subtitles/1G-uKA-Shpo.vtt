00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.119
Just at verses one and two this morning in 2 Timothy chapter number two, we are informed

00:00:05.119 --> 00:00:12.560
that the believer is a soldier in the Lord's army. Aren't you thankful for that? We are soldiers and

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:17.760
we're in the Lord's army, and hallelujah for that. Throughout the chapter of 2 Timothy chapter

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.559
number two, we find that God provides us with the number of characteristics of the Christian

00:00:24.559 --> 00:00:29.840
soldier. Over the weeks to come, we'll be looking at those characteristics and dealing with

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:36.720
the content that God gives us here in 2 Timothy chapter number two. However, there is a vital

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:42.159
truth provided for us in the beginning of this chapter, and I believe this morning that it is

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:51.200
imperative that every child of God understands and puts into practice this principle. It's absolutely

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.119
vital, and we're going to look at that this morning. We're going to take the entirety of

00:00:55.119 --> 00:01:00.720
the service this morning to look at just the first two verses, because I believe that this truth

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:09.839
is so vital, it is so absolutely imperative that we as the people of God understand and put into

00:01:09.839 --> 00:01:15.440
practice. You understand that God is the creator. You understand that this morning? You understand

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:22.400
that Satan is the imitator. Amen? He doesn't create anything. He imitates, and can I tell you

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:32.080
that he steals the truth that God has given, and his kingdom utilizes the same principles.

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:41.680
Amen? His kingdom uses the same principles. He's not a creator, but he's a thief, right? The Bible

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:48.319
tells us in John 8, he's a thief and he's a murderer. Amen? And we find that he's the father

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:55.040
of lies. He's the liar, and we find here that he steals the truth that God gives us in this

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:02.000
passage of Scripture, and can I tell you that the kingdom of this world—see, God refers to Satan in

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.440
2 Corinthians chapter number 4 as the god of this world, little g, all right? He's the little g god

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:16.320
of this world, and he has imitated—and by the way, 2 Corinthians chapter 10 tells us about the way

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.039
that he transforms himself into an angel of light, a minister of Christ, and so on and so forth,

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:26.479
and we find this morning that the principle that we're going to look at—if I would say broadly

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:35.759
this morning, the followers of Jesus Christ have failed to fully understand and implement this

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:42.320
truth, this vital principle, but yet the enemy is doing a great job implementing it,

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:48.080
and it's a sad reality. What is this truth? I believe it's a truth that has been embraced by

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:54.720
every generation of believers that has gone before us. It is a truth that they have embraced that

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:02.559
has allowed for each of us this morning to have the faith, the truth delivered to us. Now,

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:10.720
it's our time. It's our opportunity. Who can reach this generation? This generation. We must

00:03:11.679 --> 00:03:18.160
reach. We must understand that it is our opportunity, and as we embrace the truth of

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:24.479
God's Word, as we embrace the principle that God gives us in these two verses of Scripture,

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:31.039
and we implement it, incorporate it into our lives, then we can successfully, just as it has

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:38.479
been done for generations, pass down the truth of God's Word to those that are coming after us.

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:47.759
What does the principle summarize this way? Teach others also. Teach others also.

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:52.800
Notice with me in 2 Timothy 2, verse number one, the Bible says,

00:03:52.800 --> 00:04:00.320
Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. I'm thankful for the

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.960
grace that God gives. I'm thankful for the strength that God gives. And then notice in

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:13.279
verse number two, the focus of our message this morning, and the things that thou hast heard of me

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:22.000
among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men who shall be able to teach others

00:04:22.799 --> 00:04:31.359
also. I mentioned by way of introduction the way in which the enemy has imitated

00:04:31.359 --> 00:04:36.399
the plan that we find here. Can I tell you that our public schools have become a place in which

00:04:36.399 --> 00:04:40.959
there's indoctrination that is taking place? Can I tell you that the public arena, listen,

00:04:40.959 --> 00:04:48.399
they have taken and they have incorporated this principle of taking and passing down. Now,

00:04:48.399 --> 00:04:55.200
the problem is that they're not passing down truth. Amen? They're passing down wickedness,

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:01.040
and they're passing down those things which oppose God and His Word. They're calling evil good,

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:08.399
and they're calling good evil, but they are being extremely successful on teaching others.

00:05:09.679 --> 00:05:12.480
If you don't think that's true, you need to open your eyes.

00:05:15.359 --> 00:05:20.959
But somewhere along the line, God's people have failed to follow the principle. There

00:05:20.959 --> 00:05:26.880
are literally books that are being written on why we're losing generations of believers.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:32.160
Why is it that people that are growing up in churches, as soon as they reach a certain age,

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:37.760
they leave the church. They're no longer part of the church. Where is it that Christianity,

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:44.480
biblical Christianity, with the truth of God's Word have lost their way? We've tried some other

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.519
methodologies. We've done whatever it is that we've done, and we've missed the boat. We've

00:05:49.519 --> 00:05:53.519
failed to incorporate the principle, and now we have a group of people

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:59.040
that grew up in Sunday school. They grew up singing the songs. They grew up memorizing the verses,

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:05.040
but they don't come to church any longer. It's such a sad reality. Such a sad reality.

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.000
This morning, as we look at this principle that is contained in this passage of Scripture,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.640
I've titled the message, simply as the verse ends, teach others also. If you're taking notes,

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:22.160
number one, I want you to consider the investment of Paul. Consider with me the investment of Paul

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:26.480
right here in this text of Scripture in verse number two. You notice that the Bible says, as

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.880
Paul in verse number one refers to Timothy as his son, but then in verse number two he says,

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:39.279
and the things that thou hast heard of me. So Paul made a personal investment. We find

00:06:39.279 --> 00:06:44.720
that as he makes this investment, he's investing contextually. As we look at this letter to

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:51.519
Timothy, he's investing in Timothy, his son in the faith, and we find that he's invested not only in

00:06:51.519 --> 00:06:58.239
Timothy, there are others in whom Paul invested, but understanding the letter and the context,

00:06:58.239 --> 00:07:04.880
we find the investment, the personal investment that we have here of the apostle Paul. Now,

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:09.279
we find that in verse number 13 of chapter one, maybe on the same page of your Bible,

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:16.880
it says this in verse number 13 of chapter one, hold fast the form of sound words. Notice what

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:25.839
it says, which thou hast heard of me in faith and love, which is in Christ Jesus. So Paul was not

00:07:25.839 --> 00:07:32.160
trying to give Timothy some principle to follow that he himself had not incorporated in his life.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:39.600
Paul was active in investing in a future generation. Paul understood his age, he understood

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:45.440
his circumstances, he understood that he had to invest in the next generation. Understand with me

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:51.519
this morning that we are not always going to be the church members of Fellowship Baptist Church.

00:07:52.079 --> 00:07:57.279
I am not going to be the pastor of this church forever. The deacons that we have are not going

00:07:57.279 --> 00:08:01.679
to be the deacons of this church forever. The Sunday school teachers that we have are not going

00:08:01.679 --> 00:08:05.679
to be the Sunday school teachers forever. The musicians that we have are not going to be the

00:08:05.679 --> 00:08:12.720
musicians forever. Why? Because we will face death one day, and we no longer, even at times before

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:18.559
death, there are certain things we can't do any longer because of age and what have you, and we

00:08:18.559 --> 00:08:26.320
must be actively involved in understanding the importance of investing in a future generation.

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:32.960
Why? Because they're the future of our church. Who's going to teach Sunday school? Who's going

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:38.719
to lead music? Who's going to play the piano? Who's going to preach? Who's going to? You got to invest.

00:08:39.599 --> 00:08:44.960
And Paul understood this principle, and he personally was investing in the next generation.

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:51.039
We consider the investment of Paul, I would submit to you, as we studied for so long of this calendar

00:08:51.039 --> 00:08:59.119
year, the entirety of the book of 1 Timothy. And in that book, we have a written form of how Paul

00:08:59.119 --> 00:09:07.760
was investing in Timothy, how Paul was instructing Timothy, how he was giving him truth. And so we

00:09:08.239 --> 00:09:13.520
consider the investment of Paul. When I begin to think about investment in looking here, not

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:19.039
financial, you don't want me to be your instructor on financial investment, hallelujah, but I'm

00:09:19.039 --> 00:09:24.799
speaking of spiritual investment this morning. And as we think about the investment that we make

00:09:24.799 --> 00:09:30.239
spiritually in the next generation, let me give you three thoughts with regard to investment. You say,

00:09:30.239 --> 00:09:34.559
okay, pastor, I understand that I'm not going to be here forever. I understand that I should be

00:09:34.559 --> 00:09:40.159
teaching others also. I understand that I should be investing in someone else. Let me say this,

00:09:40.159 --> 00:09:50.000
number one, be purposed as you invest in others. Be purposed. Have a plan. Be purposed in your

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:58.080
investment. And we find that it's important that as Paul is investing in Timothy, he's preparing him

00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.919
for the things that he would face.

00:09:59.919 --> 00:10:04.959
He's preparing him. He's given truth with regard to the opposition at Ephesus,

00:10:04.959 --> 00:10:11.279
with regard to the false teaching, and he's being purposed in how he's investing

00:10:11.279 --> 00:10:18.639
in the one that's going to take the baton and run the next leg of the race.

00:10:18.639 --> 00:10:19.679
We must be purposed.

00:10:19.679 --> 00:10:24.399
Number two, I would say this, we must be patient as we invest in others.

00:10:24.399 --> 00:10:26.559
Now, this is probably one of the hardest parts of it.

00:10:28.479 --> 00:10:32.319
Patience is so necessary when we're investing in others.

00:10:32.319 --> 00:10:33.679
Why is that the case?

00:10:33.679 --> 00:10:35.919
Because they're not at the place where you are.

00:10:35.919 --> 00:10:37.759
That's why you're investing in them.

00:10:37.759 --> 00:10:38.559
Does that make sense?

00:10:39.359 --> 00:10:41.599
You think about the one that's starting to play an instrument.

00:10:41.599 --> 00:10:46.159
I remember when Brianna first started playing the violin, and Brother Pierre,

00:10:46.159 --> 00:10:50.559
you can relate to some of the violin students you've had over the years, including Brianna.

00:10:50.559 --> 00:10:53.439
There were times in which it was like, can you just make it stop?

00:10:55.359 --> 00:10:58.799
If you've ever had children that played an instrument when they first started,

00:10:58.799 --> 00:11:00.399
maybe you can relate to that.

00:11:00.399 --> 00:11:04.639
I'm not very musical, but there were times in which it was like, I just need it to stop.

00:11:06.239 --> 00:11:08.399
It's not the right note.

00:11:08.399 --> 00:11:08.879
Amen?

00:11:09.679 --> 00:11:16.639
And the reality is that there must be patience when we're investing in others.

00:11:16.639 --> 00:11:22.079
Brianna now, and it's no prideful statement, but she's able to play

00:11:22.079 --> 00:11:28.959
not only the violin and the cello and the piano because somebody, and Pierre was her instructor,

00:11:28.959 --> 00:11:31.999
had patience in those early days.

00:11:32.799 --> 00:11:33.279
Amen?

00:11:35.199 --> 00:11:38.799
And we see that it's necessary, listen, when we're trying to instruct somebody,

00:11:38.799 --> 00:11:42.319
listen, the reality is that when we're trying to instruct somebody to lead music,

00:11:42.319 --> 00:11:43.199
they might mess up.

00:11:43.199 --> 00:11:47.119
When you're investing in somebody that's going to play an instrument, lead music,

00:11:47.119 --> 00:11:48.879
you're investing in someone that's going to teach.

00:11:49.839 --> 00:11:54.479
I can't expect somebody that's going to just teach their very first lesson

00:11:54.479 --> 00:12:01.039
or preach their very first message to preach as if they've been preaching for 30 years,

00:12:01.039 --> 00:12:02.239
teaching for 30 years.

00:12:02.239 --> 00:12:04.879
It would be an unreasonable expectation.

00:12:04.879 --> 00:12:05.359
Amen?

00:12:06.479 --> 00:12:09.199
By the way, I remember the first message I ever preached.

00:12:09.199 --> 00:12:11.679
I remember, Brother Mark, being scared to death.

00:12:12.319 --> 00:12:14.159
You guys think I talk fast now?

00:12:14.159 --> 00:12:15.919
It was a whole nother level.

00:12:15.919 --> 00:12:16.799
Amen?

00:12:16.959 --> 00:12:21.439
I mean, I think I had 30 minutes of content that I spoke in about seven.

00:12:21.439 --> 00:12:23.359
I mean, I was just flying.

00:12:23.359 --> 00:12:24.559
I was nervous.

00:12:24.559 --> 00:12:26.079
I was, I sweat.

00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:27.679
Last Sunday, I was sweating like crazy.

00:12:27.679 --> 00:12:29.519
I was running around doing all kinds of things.

00:12:29.519 --> 00:12:31.599
Man, I was just pouring sweat.

00:12:31.599 --> 00:12:33.599
It was, I was so nervous.

00:12:33.599 --> 00:12:37.599
I could not wait for it to be over.

00:12:37.599 --> 00:12:41.119
And I think the people that were sitting there probably couldn't wait for it to be over either.

00:12:41.119 --> 00:12:41.999
Amen?

00:12:41.999 --> 00:12:43.999
And some of you say, I still feel that way.

00:12:43.999 --> 00:12:44.799
The Lord bless you.

00:12:44.799 --> 00:12:46.479
Thanks for being here this morning.

00:12:46.559 --> 00:12:51.279
But the reality is that we need to be patient as we're investing.

00:12:51.279 --> 00:12:52.159
Let me say this.

00:12:52.719 --> 00:12:54.239
We need to be particular.

00:12:54.239 --> 00:12:58.559
What I mean by that is that we ought to be selective.

00:12:59.679 --> 00:13:00.719
What do I mean by that?

00:13:00.719 --> 00:13:01.519
Let me say this.

00:13:01.519 --> 00:13:02.399
It sounds harsh.

00:13:03.039 --> 00:13:07.359
I'm going to preface what I'm going to say by telling you it sounds harsh, but the reality

00:13:07.359 --> 00:13:07.839
is this.

00:13:08.639 --> 00:13:13.519
We only have a limited amount of time to invest in individuals.

00:13:14.479 --> 00:13:14.959
Amen?

00:13:15.679 --> 00:13:23.039
And if we only have a limited amount of time, we must be wise in who we choose to invest

00:13:23.039 --> 00:13:23.599
in.

00:13:23.599 --> 00:13:25.199
You say, Pastor, that's harsh.

00:13:25.199 --> 00:13:26.399
I don't mean to be unkind.

00:13:26.399 --> 00:13:27.599
I don't mean to be harsh.

00:13:27.599 --> 00:13:31.919
But the reality is that I only have so many minutes and hours and you only have so many

00:13:31.919 --> 00:13:32.959
minutes and hours.

00:13:32.959 --> 00:13:34.879
And we have to be particular.

00:13:34.879 --> 00:13:40.479
We have to be wise in who we choose to invest in.

00:13:40.479 --> 00:13:44.719
In the text of Scripture, the Bible says, in the things that thou hast heard of me,

00:13:45.759 --> 00:13:50.319
among many witnesses, the same commit thou to, what does it say in your Bible?

00:13:51.199 --> 00:13:56.719
Faithful men who shall be able to teach others also.

00:13:56.719 --> 00:14:03.119
There was some element of criteria that would determine if an individual was faithful that

00:14:03.119 --> 00:14:06.159
that was somebody to spend the time investing in.

00:14:06.159 --> 00:14:07.359
Now, let me say this.

00:14:07.359 --> 00:14:10.959
We need to be careful because there are times in which we can look and say, there is no

00:14:10.959 --> 00:14:11.999
hope for that person.

00:14:11.999 --> 00:14:12.959
And really there is.

00:14:12.959 --> 00:14:14.479
We just need to be patient.

00:14:14.479 --> 00:14:19.839
There's a balance with these three thoughts this morning with regard to consider the investment

00:14:19.839 --> 00:14:23.279
of Paul, the being purposed and being patient and being particular.

00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:25.199
There is a balance here.

00:14:25.199 --> 00:14:31.839
But the reality is that soon, early on in the ministry of investing, you can find out

00:14:31.839 --> 00:14:36.799
if there's, if that individual is faithful, if that individual is the one that you should

00:14:36.799 --> 00:14:39.759
continue to pour that resource into.

00:14:41.439 --> 00:14:42.239
Let me say this.

00:14:42.879 --> 00:14:44.239
Jesus followed that pattern.

00:14:46.479 --> 00:14:47.119
You say, no.

00:14:47.759 --> 00:14:48.559
Yeah, yeah.

00:14:48.559 --> 00:14:49.999
Jesus had how many disciples?

00:14:49.999 --> 00:14:50.399
Twelve.

00:14:51.519 --> 00:14:54.399
But there was an inner circle of three.

00:14:55.759 --> 00:14:58.719
Peter, James, and John.

00:14:59.599 --> 00:15:00.399
They were the inner circle.

00:15:00.399 --> 00:15:02.079
Let me show you a couple of verses over in Matthew.

00:15:02.079 --> 00:15:03.439
Hold your place here in 2 Timothy.

00:15:03.439 --> 00:15:04.559
We'll be there in just a moment.

00:15:04.559 --> 00:15:10.399
But look over at Matthew 17, if you will, and look at two passages of Scripture in the

00:15:10.399 --> 00:15:11.919
Gospel of Matthew.

00:15:11.919 --> 00:15:17.439
And I want you to see this principle employed by the Lord Jesus Christ as he's investing

00:15:17.439 --> 00:15:20.319
in others, and he had the twelve.

00:15:20.319 --> 00:15:27.279
We understand that one, Judas, was a, was a betrayer, and so there's eleven after he

00:15:27.279 --> 00:15:32.719
goes and kills himself, after he ratted out the Lord and betrayed him.

00:15:32.719 --> 00:15:37.679
And we find that as we come to Matthew 17, prior to all of that taking place, there's

00:15:37.679 --> 00:15:42.639
twelve disciples at this particular time in history, in the life and ministry of the Lord

00:15:42.639 --> 00:15:43.679
Jesus Christ.

00:15:43.679 --> 00:15:48.239
But Matthew 17 reveals to us the three, the inner circle.

00:15:48.239 --> 00:15:58.879
Notice it says this, and after six days, Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John, his brother.

00:15:58.879 --> 00:16:01.279
Why didn't he take the other disciples?

00:16:01.359 --> 00:16:02.479
Well, there's an inner circle.

00:16:03.439 --> 00:16:05.039
And he takes Peter, James, and John.

00:16:05.039 --> 00:16:09.519
He's investing in them, the Bible says, and he bringeth them up into a high mountain apart

00:16:09.519 --> 00:16:12.319
and was transfigured before them.

00:16:13.199 --> 00:16:15.439
This is the record of the Mount of Transfiguration.

00:16:16.079 --> 00:16:20.799
And we find that Peter, in fact, spoke of this as he's writing later, and he talks about

00:16:20.799 --> 00:16:25.039
being on the Mount, and he talks about how we have a more sure word of prophecy.

00:16:25.039 --> 00:16:30.079
He literally heard the voice of God, this is my beloved Son.

00:16:30.079 --> 00:16:35.279
We find that as he heard that, and he encountered that, and he's there, and he hears all these

00:16:35.279 --> 00:16:40.319
things that he writes later, that we have a more sure word of prophecy.

00:16:41.199 --> 00:16:46.319
We have the Scriptures, we have the Word of God, and how thankful and how blessed we are.

00:16:46.319 --> 00:16:50.319
We understand that Peter would stand up on the day of Pentecost and he would preach,

00:16:50.319 --> 00:16:56.079
and you think about the roles of James and John in the early church and all that was

00:16:56.079 --> 00:17:01.919
taking place, and the Lord Jesus Christ was investing in these three individuals.

00:17:01.919 --> 00:17:07.519
We find in Matthew 26, turn there, if you will, and here in Matthew 26, we find that

00:17:07.519 --> 00:17:14.079
we're on the, really, the eve of the crucifixion and all that takes place and the preparation

00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:14.799
and all of that.

00:17:14.799 --> 00:17:21.599
And we find that it was there in the beginning of this text of Scripture, in Matthew 26,

00:17:21.599 --> 00:17:26.719
where it's spoken of Judas going to betray the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:17:26.719 --> 00:17:32.959
We find that Jesus mentions, as he's there at the Passover, about the fact that one that

00:17:32.959 --> 00:17:36.399
was there with them would be the one that would betray him.

00:17:36.399 --> 00:17:40.479
And we continue to read through, and we find that after they had observed that supper,

00:17:40.479 --> 00:17:44.959
it says in verse number 30, when they had sung a hymn, they went out into the Mount of Olives.

00:17:44.959 --> 00:17:47.679
Now, what was Judas doing at this point?

00:17:47.679 --> 00:17:51.919
Well, according to verse 25, he was the one that asked, is it I?

00:17:51.919 --> 00:17:57.279
But then we find that later on he would leave to go out to make the deal to be able to betray

00:17:57.279 --> 00:17:58.079
Jesus.

00:17:58.079 --> 00:18:03.359
But notice if you skip down, we find that as we're looking here throughout this text

00:18:03.359 --> 00:18:06.719
of Scripture, Jesus is speaking to the disciples.

00:18:06.719 --> 00:18:10.959
In verse 35, Peter said unto him, though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny

00:18:10.959 --> 00:18:11.599
thee.

00:18:11.599 --> 00:18:13.839
Likewise, also said, what does it say there?

00:18:14.959 --> 00:18:16.639
All the disciples.

00:18:16.639 --> 00:18:17.119
All right?

00:18:17.119 --> 00:18:18.639
So the 11 are there.

00:18:18.639 --> 00:18:21.679
It says in verse 36, then cometh Jesus with them.

00:18:21.679 --> 00:18:22.799
Now, what's them?

00:18:22.799 --> 00:18:24.719
That's referring back to all the disciples.

00:18:24.719 --> 00:18:25.199
Do we agree?

00:18:25.199 --> 00:18:29.519
I'm not an English scholar, but we can see here that he's speaking about the 11 unto

00:18:29.519 --> 00:18:31.359
a place called Gethsemane.

00:18:31.359 --> 00:18:36.479
And he saith unto the disciples, again, this is the 11 of them, sit ye here while I go

00:18:36.479 --> 00:18:37.679
and pray yonder.

00:18:37.679 --> 00:18:39.200
Look at verse 37.

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:43.760
And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee.

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:45.119
Now, who are the two sons of Zebedee?

00:18:45.119 --> 00:18:46.799
Well, that's James and John.

00:18:46.799 --> 00:18:50.079
And he takes them, and it says, and he began to be sorrowful and very heavy.

00:18:50.079 --> 00:18:56.000
So Jesus leaves the other eight, and he takes those three, Peter, James, and John, as he

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.440
goes further in.

00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:00.079
Jesus was purposed.

00:19:00.079 --> 00:19:01.200
He was patient.

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:06.320
Oh, the patience that he had to have with the disciples as he trained them, and especially

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:07.200
with Peter.

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.599
And Peter is the one that's part of the inner circle.

00:19:09.599 --> 00:19:10.559
He's being particular.

00:19:10.559 --> 00:19:14.159
But Peter was, I mean, he had to be patient with Peter, right?

00:19:14.159 --> 00:19:16.880
And we find God's been patient with us.

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:20.320
I'm thankful for my mentors who have been patient with me.

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:27.039
I'm thankful for those that gave opportunity in order to develop that made purposed investment

00:19:27.039 --> 00:19:27.839
in my life.

00:19:27.839 --> 00:19:32.719
And so as we look here at 2 Timothy chapter number two, and we consider the investment

00:19:32.719 --> 00:19:38.799
of Paul, we ought to take a step back and say, praise the Lord that Paul was interested

00:19:38.799 --> 00:19:41.599
in investing in the next generation.

00:19:41.599 --> 00:19:47.919
You know, one thing that I think causes people to ignore or to disobey, really that's the

00:19:47.919 --> 00:19:52.639
truth, is to disobey this portion of Scripture or this principle is pride.

00:19:54.159 --> 00:19:59.760
I don't want to invest in someone else because they might become better than me.

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:04.160
I don't want to invest in that fellow to be the next preacher, because he might preach

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:05.320
better than I do.

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:09.840
I don't want to invest in that person to play the instrument, because they may play...

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:10.980
Pride's dangerous.

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:16.240
We preached on that on Wednesday evening, that we ought to walk humbly.

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:18.800
That was the message on Wednesday evening.

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:25.920
The reality is that there are times in which pride will cause us to disobey this principle.

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:30.480
Have you ever been in a situation where someone has a piece of knowledge that they want to

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:33.360
keep to themselves, they don't want to share it with anyone else?

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:34.360
Why?

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:36.880
Because they want to be the important person.

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:44.200
They don't want anyone else to know, because as long as they know it, then they are needed.

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:45.680
Have you been in a situation like that?

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:51.840
Can I tell you, as God's people, we must recognize that God's work is far greater than any of

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:53.840
us.

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:55.200
We need God.

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:56.520
God doesn't need us.

00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:02.880
He's chosen to use us, and I can never understand it, but I just simply say, praise the Lord

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:05.680
that He would use us.

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:11.160
But the reality this morning is that He must increase and I must decrease.

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:18.120
We must acknowledge, we must recognize this morning, that the church, the work of God,

00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:21.720
is greater than any one of us as an individual.

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:23.520
Paul had to understand.

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:24.800
It wasn't about Paul.

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:30.240
It was about Christ, and therefore, he's going to take what he had learned from Christ,

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:33.120
and he was going to teach, he was going to invest in others.

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:37.680
By the way, you understand you don't need to turn there, but Paul makes this statement

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:42.960
in Galatians chapter 1 and verse 11, but I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:46.200
was preached of me is not after man.

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:52.120
Verse 12, for I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:53.680
of Jesus Christ.

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:58.520
And so Paul understood that he had received the instruction from Christ, and now he's

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:01.520
investing in the future generation.

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:07.120
And by the way, if we're walking in humility, if we're understanding the work of God the

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:12.140
way that we ought to understand the work of God, our desire should be that the preacher

00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:17.160
that I'm investing in would be a far better preacher than I am, that the musician that

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:20.360
I'm investing in would be a far better musician than I am.

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:21.360
Why?

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:26.880
Investing in them to do more, to do greater, to go further than we've ever done.

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:27.880
Does that not make sense?

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:36.480
We have a world to reach, we have a work to be done, and it's all to be for the glory

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:42.840
of God, not for the recognition of man, not for the glory of the individual.

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:47.360
And so we understand and consider the investment of Paul, understand number two, look at this

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:50.920
quickly with me this morning back in 2 Timothy 2.

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:53.320
Consider the instruction of Paul.

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:58.320
Paul made an investment, but then Paul gives instruction here in our text of Scripture.

00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:00.800
He says in 2 Timothy 2 and verse number two,

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:07.960
And the things that thou hast heard of me, among many witnesses, the same commit thou

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:14.400
to faithful men who shall be able to teach others also.

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:20.840
Paul invested in Timothy, and now he's going to instruct Timothy to invest in others.

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:24.520
Timothy, it's now your turn.

00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:26.600
Timothy, you're not going to be here forever.

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:31.000
Timothy, you're going to run the next leg of the race, but you're not going to finish

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.600
the entirety of the race.

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:37.040
He's going to finish his race, but the fact of the matter is that the church still needs

00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:38.200
to go forward.

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:42.280
The work of God still is going to carry on.

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:46.880
My race will come to an end, your race will come to an end, but when we see it from a

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:53.680
bigger picture, when we see it from the perspective of God, the work of God continues.

00:23:53.680 --> 00:24:00.040
And so therefore, Paul is seeking to invest in Timothy, and then Paul is seeking to instruct

00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:02.520
Timothy to invest in others.

00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:04.680
Timothy was to be actively involved.

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:09.000
Timothy could not take a seat and just kind of be a spectator and say, well, we're just

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.240
going to see how things work.

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:13.920
It's just going to be on autopilot, it's just going to happen.

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:21.240
No, it's not going to happen without being purposed, without being purposed.

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:23.920
We find that Timothy was to be actively involved.

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:25.440
What was it that Timothy was to do?

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:30.119
Well, the Bible tells us that he had been taught and now he is to teach others.

00:24:30.119 --> 00:24:31.119
What is it that he's to teach?

00:24:31.119 --> 00:24:35.320
Well, he's to teach the same, the same.

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:39.600
We notice that right in the middle of the verse, it says, the same commit thou to faithful

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:40.960
men.

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:43.640
Now, I like that because he's to teach what he's been taught.

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:45.720
He's to teach the truth of God's Word.

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:49.880
I'm so thankful that I don't have to get up here every service, Sunday school, Sunday

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:54.360
morning, Sunday night, Wednesday night, and come up with my own ideas and my new ideas.

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:59.400
No, I simply get up and do what Paul is going to instruct Timothy to do in the fourth chapter

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:02.440
and to preach the Word.

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:08.600
Now my job, no doubt, is to study the Word and to be a student of the Word and to be

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:15.200
able to process and to bring and to give the truth of God's Word in a manner in which

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:21.480
it can be understood and a way in which it can be applied.

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:26.520
I taught on choices in Sunday school this morning and the fact is that every message

00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:32.080
that I preach, every lesson that I teach, I'm desiring to bring people to a place of

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:33.400
decision.

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:36.200
There's a choice to be made.

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:43.200
We find that Joshua would say this in Joshua 24, choose you this day whom you will serve.

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:46.640
As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:50.960
He made the choice, but he couldn't make the choice for anyone else.

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:55.000
He simply had to let them know that there was a choice to be made.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:00.119
Moses draws a line in the sand and said, who is on the Lord's side?

00:26:00.119 --> 00:26:01.480
Amen?

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:08.800
And we find this morning that Timothy has a responsibility to teach the same, to teach

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:10.880
the same.

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:13.240
There's nothing new under the sun.

00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:17.600
I'm thankful that God's given us a complete canon of Scripture.

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:20.360
Sometimes you'll hear somebody say, I got something new for you.

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:22.480
Be careful.

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:25.640
Be careful.

00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:31.040
Now are there times in which God reveals something to us that's known in His Word?

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:34.360
Sure, but it's new to me or it's new to you, sure.

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:37.880
But it's not something you've never seen or never heard or never know.

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:38.880
It's God's Word.

00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:44.680
In fact, I think if you did some research, we've been going at this thing since the ascension

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:47.839
of Jesus Christ for 2,000 years now.

00:26:47.839 --> 00:26:53.279
I think probably if you could do some research and say, has anyone ever preached or taught

00:26:53.279 --> 00:26:57.760
this thought, you'd find that there's probably thousands of people that have preached and

00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:02.480
taught that thought.

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:07.080
We find here this morning that Timothy had to be actively involved.

00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:10.119
He had to be teaching.

00:27:10.119 --> 00:27:15.240
If I think about this responsibility that is now given to Timothy, as I understand the

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:20.960
instruction that Paul is giving, Paul had already made an investment, but now he's instructing

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:21.960
Timothy.

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:25.119
Remember, Paul understood that he would soon die.

00:27:25.119 --> 00:27:26.119
He's in prison.

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:28.000
He's awaiting a martyr's death.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.800
At the end of the chapter, he said, the time of my departure is at hand, at the end of

00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:33.240
the book in chapter four.

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:36.200
He knew, and so he's taking this opportunity.

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:40.400
Obviously, it's God's Word, so it's under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:44.320
but he's given this instruction, Timothy, you need to do this.

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:45.320
It's urgent.

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:46.320
It's imperative.

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:55.360
It is vital that you teach a next generation.

00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:58.000
With that instruction comes responsibility.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:05.160
Therefore, I say this, if I understand the responsibility, I better be a good student,

00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:10.800
because if I need to teach others also, I better be ready to teach, amen?

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:14.720
I can't teach what I don't know.

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:18.320
Armando sitting down here in the front, Armando has a flooring business.

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:21.600
I've attempted to lay floor a couple of times.

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:23.440
I've never done carpet.

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:27.200
I've only done the little, I say simple, but it's not really simple.

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:30.920
There's obviously a lot of work involved in it, but the, you know, tongue and groove kind

00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:33.520
of snap it together, floating floor.

00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:34.520
That's the only thing I've ever done.

00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:36.280
I've never done carpet.

00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:37.280
I've never done hardwood.

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:39.320
I've never done any kind of tile work.

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:43.080
Somebody comes to me and says, hey, can you teach me how to do tile work?

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:47.280
No, I can't, because I don't know how to do it.

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:52.160
But if you go to Armando and say, can you teach me how to do this?

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:53.160
Armando could teach.

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:54.160
Why?

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:58.200
Because he knows he's been taught and he does it.

00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:02.880
So if I go to Armando and say, Armando, would you teach me so that I could then teach somebody

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:03.880
else?

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:09.160
Well, I better be a good student if I'm going to teach him.

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:17.640
This morning, the Christian life is so important that we're fully in and we're understanding

00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:22.160
this great responsibility that God has given to us.

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:28.140
There is a generation of people coming after us, and how can we teach them if we ourselves

00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:30.220
do not know the truth?

00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:36.119
How can we invest in them the same things if we don't even know the things of God's

00:29:36.119 --> 00:29:37.119
Word?

00:29:37.119 --> 00:29:38.919
We must be a good student.

00:29:38.919 --> 00:29:43.919
And I'll tell you this, when we understand the responsibility, it helps us to understand

00:29:43.919 --> 00:29:49.000
I better be a good student because I have this responsibility to teach someone else.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:54.760
Teach them in such a way that they then will be able to teach others.

00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:56.040
Is that not what the verse says?

00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:59.479
Notice, the same commit thou to faithful men.

00:29:59.479 --> 00:30:05.979
who shall be able to teach others also."

00:30:05.979 --> 00:30:06.979
I'm not God.

00:30:06.979 --> 00:30:08.979
I never can tell somebody else

00:30:08.979 --> 00:30:12.279
what the will of God is for their lives.

00:30:12.279 --> 00:30:14.279
I'm not God.

00:30:14.279 --> 00:30:16.279
By the way, I'm thankful, and so are you.

00:30:16.279 --> 00:30:18.279
And you're not God.

00:30:18.279 --> 00:30:22.079
Amen?

00:30:22.079 --> 00:30:28.279
I've purposed to try to invest in people.

00:30:28.279 --> 00:30:30.279
In the last several months,

00:30:30.279 --> 00:30:33.279
it's not happened for various reasons,

00:30:33.279 --> 00:30:35.779
mostly schedule-wise.

00:30:35.779 --> 00:30:37.779
But I took some time

00:30:37.779 --> 00:30:40.779
over a period of months

00:30:40.779 --> 00:30:43.279
to specifically sit down

00:30:43.279 --> 00:30:46.779
and to invest in these two young men.

00:30:46.779 --> 00:30:49.279
One's my son.

00:30:49.279 --> 00:30:52.779
One's your son.

00:30:52.779 --> 00:30:54.279
I don't know what God's going to do

00:30:54.279 --> 00:30:55.779
with either one of them,

00:30:55.779 --> 00:30:58.779
but I know they're a lot younger than I am.

00:30:58.779 --> 00:31:00.779
Tim's going to be 18 this week.

00:31:00.779 --> 00:31:03.279
Joseph will be 18 in December.

00:31:03.279 --> 00:31:04.779
I don't know what God's going to do

00:31:04.779 --> 00:31:06.279
with either one of them,

00:31:06.279 --> 00:31:09.779
but they were interested.

00:31:09.779 --> 00:31:14.279
And I sat down for hours

00:31:14.279 --> 00:31:18.279
and purposefully invested in them

00:31:18.279 --> 00:31:21.279
in such a way

00:31:21.279 --> 00:31:24.779
that they could teach somebody else.

00:31:24.779 --> 00:31:29.279
Not just so that they could know it for themselves.

00:31:29.279 --> 00:31:32.279
I was purposed.

00:31:32.279 --> 00:31:35.279
Did it take time? Absolutely.

00:31:35.279 --> 00:31:37.279
Absolutely.

00:31:37.279 --> 00:31:38.779
But it was worth it.

00:31:38.779 --> 00:31:40.279
It's an investment.

00:31:40.279 --> 00:31:43.279
It's an investment.

00:31:43.279 --> 00:31:45.779
We must understand

00:31:45.779 --> 00:31:48.779
the instruction that Paul is giving.

00:31:48.779 --> 00:31:50.779
Listen, I'm not going to be the pastor here forever.

00:31:50.779 --> 00:31:52.279
I don't know who will be the next pastor.

00:31:52.279 --> 00:31:53.279
I'm only 44.

00:31:53.279 --> 00:31:55.279
If I don't get excited, then I'm leaving soon.

00:31:55.279 --> 00:31:57.279
But the reality is that I know

00:31:57.279 --> 00:32:00.279
I'm not going to be here forever.

00:32:00.279 --> 00:32:02.779
And therefore, I must be purposed.

00:32:02.779 --> 00:32:04.779
I can't tell you he's not here this morning,

00:32:04.779 --> 00:32:07.279
but I can't tell you how many countless hours

00:32:07.279 --> 00:32:10.279
I spent with Fernando.

00:32:10.279 --> 00:32:13.279
Why? Because he was hungry.

00:32:13.279 --> 00:32:14.779
When Fernando came to our church,

00:32:14.779 --> 00:32:16.279
he had never been in a Baptist church

00:32:16.279 --> 00:32:19.279
one day in his life.

00:32:19.279 --> 00:32:21.779
Not one.

00:32:21.779 --> 00:32:23.279
And he showed up, and actually,

00:32:23.279 --> 00:32:24.779
Ronnie met him in Walmart.

00:32:24.779 --> 00:32:27.279
He was in the book section.

00:32:27.279 --> 00:32:28.779
Ronnie meets people at Walmart all the time.

00:32:28.779 --> 00:32:30.279
Amen?

00:32:30.279 --> 00:32:32.779
I don't meet anyone at Walmart.

00:32:32.779 --> 00:32:34.279
I try to go in and get out.

00:32:34.279 --> 00:32:35.279
Amen?

00:32:35.279 --> 00:32:36.779
And I have a different perspective

00:32:36.779 --> 00:32:39.279
of going to Walmart than I do going to church.

00:32:39.279 --> 00:32:40.779
I don't come to church to get out of church,

00:32:40.779 --> 00:32:42.779
but I go to Walmart to get out of Walmart.

00:32:42.779 --> 00:32:43.779
Amen?

00:32:43.779 --> 00:32:45.779
And I'm trying to get in and out as fast as I can.

00:32:45.779 --> 00:32:47.279
Ronnie meets people.

00:32:47.279 --> 00:32:48.779
He just does.

00:32:48.779 --> 00:32:50.279
And he met Fernando.

00:32:50.279 --> 00:32:51.279
And Ronnie came and said,

00:32:51.279 --> 00:32:53.779
hey, I got a number of this guy, blah, blah, blah,

00:32:53.779 --> 00:32:55.279
and whatever, whatever.

00:32:55.279 --> 00:32:58.279
And Fernando calls me one day.

00:32:58.279 --> 00:32:59.779
Never been here.

00:32:59.779 --> 00:33:01.779
And I said, hey, listen, maybe we should meet.

00:33:01.779 --> 00:33:04.779
And he came to my office one day.

00:33:04.779 --> 00:33:08.279
He'd never been in a Baptist church.

00:33:08.279 --> 00:33:09.279
And he showed up.

00:33:09.279 --> 00:33:12.279
He told me his testimony of salvation.

00:33:12.279 --> 00:33:14.279
He revealed to me that he'd never been to a Baptist church.

00:33:14.279 --> 00:33:19.279
There was a level of fear of the unknown.

00:33:20.279 --> 00:33:23.279
I mean, just simple things, right?

00:33:23.279 --> 00:33:26.279
So I told him, hey, we're one of the most friendly churches

00:33:26.279 --> 00:33:27.279
you'll ever meet.

00:33:27.279 --> 00:33:29.279
And I was hoping that would be the case.

00:33:29.279 --> 00:33:30.279
No, I'm just kidding.

00:33:30.279 --> 00:33:31.279
I knew.

00:33:31.279 --> 00:33:32.279
We're a friendly church.

00:33:32.279 --> 00:33:33.279
We love people.

00:33:33.279 --> 00:33:35.279
We love one another.

00:33:35.279 --> 00:33:37.279
And Fernando said, I don't know much about the Bible.

00:33:37.279 --> 00:33:38.279
I want to learn.

00:33:38.279 --> 00:33:41.279
He'd never read the Bible through at that point.

00:33:41.279 --> 00:33:45.279
I began to sit down with him every week for hours

00:33:45.279 --> 00:33:48.279
and invest in him across the table, he and I,

00:33:48.279 --> 00:33:50.279
just the two of us.

00:33:50.279 --> 00:33:53.279
I don't know what God's going to do with Fernando.

00:33:53.279 --> 00:33:55.279
I have no idea.

00:33:55.279 --> 00:33:58.279
But I know that God allowed a time, a season,

00:33:58.279 --> 00:33:59.279
for me to invest in him.

00:33:59.279 --> 00:34:02.279
And I want him to be able to teach others also.

00:34:02.279 --> 00:34:03.279
Fernando's 20.

00:34:03.279 --> 00:34:05.279
I think 21.

00:34:05.279 --> 00:34:06.279
He's a little bit older than these guys,

00:34:06.279 --> 00:34:09.279
but he's still a lot younger than I am.

00:34:09.279 --> 00:34:11.279
And I want to invest in him.

00:34:11.279 --> 00:34:13.279
I don't know what God's going to do with him.

00:34:13.279 --> 00:34:14.279
But I know he had to grow.

00:34:14.279 --> 00:34:15.279
He had to learn.

00:34:15.279 --> 00:34:19.279
I remember him asking questions.

00:34:19.279 --> 00:34:22.279
He's not here, and I don't think this would embarrass him.

00:34:22.279 --> 00:34:25.279
I was in the same place, and you were in the same place

00:34:25.279 --> 00:34:28.279
when you first got saved too, by the way.

00:34:28.279 --> 00:34:33.279
He didn't know who the two good spies were.

00:34:33.279 --> 00:34:34.279
Is that fair?

00:34:34.279 --> 00:34:36.279
He didn't know who they were.

00:34:36.279 --> 00:34:38.279
But can I tell you, there was a day that I didn't know

00:34:38.279 --> 00:34:40.279
who they were either.

00:34:40.279 --> 00:34:42.279
We sing the song, 12 men went to spy on Cain,

00:34:42.279 --> 00:34:43.279
and 10 were bad, 2 were good.

00:34:43.279 --> 00:34:44.279
And then we asked the little kids,

00:34:44.279 --> 00:34:46.279
Lydia, who were the two good spies?

00:34:46.279 --> 00:34:48.279
And she says, they were Joshua and Caleb.

00:34:48.279 --> 00:34:50.279
Grew up in church.

00:34:50.279 --> 00:34:52.279
Knows the account.

00:34:52.279 --> 00:34:54.279
I sat in Bible college the first day.

00:34:54.279 --> 00:34:56.279
I mean, I remember my first semester in Bible college.

00:34:56.279 --> 00:34:58.279
I didn't even know that God parted the Red Sea.

00:34:58.279 --> 00:34:59.279
We're listening about the Red Sea parting,

00:34:59.279 --> 00:35:02.279
and I'm like, this is awesome.

00:35:02.279 --> 00:35:04.279
And I got guys sitting there like,

00:35:04.279 --> 00:35:05.279
heard this 100 times.

00:35:05.279 --> 00:35:07.279
I'm like, are you kidding me?

00:35:07.279 --> 00:35:09.279
This is awesome.

00:35:09.279 --> 00:35:10.279
Because it is.

00:35:10.279 --> 00:35:12.279
It's our God.

00:35:12.279 --> 00:35:14.279
You know what I did with Fernando?

00:35:14.279 --> 00:35:17.279
I didn't tell him who the two good spies were.

00:35:17.279 --> 00:35:21.279
I said, look, when you get to the book of Numbers,

00:35:21.279 --> 00:35:25.279
you'll read chapters 13 and 14,

00:35:25.279 --> 00:35:27.279
and when you get there,

00:35:27.279 --> 00:35:28.279
if you still don't know who they are,

00:35:28.279 --> 00:35:30.279
you come talk to me.

00:35:30.279 --> 00:35:31.279
And I was meeting with him every week,

00:35:31.279 --> 00:35:32.279
and I'd say to him every week,

00:35:32.279 --> 00:35:35.279
where are you in your Bible reading?

00:35:35.279 --> 00:35:36.279
I just finished up the book of Genesis,

00:35:36.279 --> 00:35:37.279
I'm starting Exodus.

00:35:37.279 --> 00:35:38.279
Okay, good.

00:35:38.279 --> 00:35:39.279
Where are you in your Bible reading?

00:35:39.279 --> 00:35:40.279
Well, I just finished Exodus,

00:35:40.279 --> 00:35:41.279
I'm in the book of Numbers.

00:35:41.279 --> 00:35:42.279
Oh, good, you're getting close.

00:35:42.279 --> 00:35:43.279
You got that bookmark there, right?

00:35:43.279 --> 00:35:46.279
Oh, yeah, I got the bookmark there.

00:35:46.279 --> 00:35:48.279
And you might think this is silly,

00:35:48.279 --> 00:35:50.279
but this is investment.

00:35:50.279 --> 00:35:53.279
This is being patient.

00:35:53.279 --> 00:35:54.279
It's what it is.

00:35:54.279 --> 00:35:56.279
It's the work of the ministry.

00:35:56.279 --> 00:35:59.279
And I remember when he read those chapters,

00:35:59.279 --> 00:36:03.279
he said, I know who the two good spies are.

00:36:03.279 --> 00:36:06.279
Joshua and Caleb.

00:36:06.279 --> 00:36:08.279
That's big stuff.

00:36:08.279 --> 00:36:10.279
It's a little truth

00:36:10.279 --> 00:36:12.279
that sometimes we take for granted.

00:36:12.279 --> 00:36:13.279
But I guarantee you,

00:36:13.279 --> 00:36:15.279
you can go around to a lot of places today,

00:36:15.279 --> 00:36:17.279
and you can talk about 12 spies,

00:36:17.279 --> 00:36:19.279
they don't even know what you're talking about.

00:36:19.279 --> 00:36:20.279
In fact, you can go to some churches today

00:36:20.279 --> 00:36:22.279
that don't even preach the Bible,

00:36:22.279 --> 00:36:23.279
because there's a lot of churches out there

00:36:23.279 --> 00:36:25.279
that are just for entertainment.

00:36:25.279 --> 00:36:27.279
That's not what this is called to do.

00:36:27.279 --> 00:36:30.279
This is not entertaining, this is investing.

00:36:30.279 --> 00:36:32.279
And we see the instruction that Paul gives,

00:36:32.279 --> 00:36:34.279
and Paul gives this instruction,

00:36:34.279 --> 00:36:37.279
and Timothy must embrace and he must follow.

00:36:37.279 --> 00:36:39.279
And I'll say this in closing this morning,

00:36:39.279 --> 00:36:40.279
number three,

00:36:40.279 --> 00:36:41.279
we must consider the importance

00:36:41.279 --> 00:36:44.279
of following this principle.

00:36:44.279 --> 00:36:45.279
We consider the investment,

00:36:45.279 --> 00:36:46.279
we consider the instruction,

00:36:46.279 --> 00:36:48.279
and then we must consider the importance

00:36:48.279 --> 00:36:50.279
for ourselves individually

00:36:50.279 --> 00:36:52.279
that we would follow the principle

00:36:52.279 --> 00:36:54.279
that God set forth in 2 Timothy 2,

00:36:54.279 --> 00:36:56.279
in verse number two.

00:36:56.279 --> 00:36:57.279
It's not a principle

00:36:57.279 --> 00:36:59.279
that was exclusively for Timothy, no.

00:36:59.279 --> 00:37:02.279
It's a pattern that Jesus established

00:37:02.279 --> 00:37:04.279
in his word that God is giving

00:37:04.279 --> 00:37:06.279
to Timothy through Paul.

00:37:06.279 --> 00:37:07.279
It is this principle

00:37:07.279 --> 00:37:10.279
that must continue to be employed today.

00:37:10.279 --> 00:37:12.279
It is absolutely vital,

00:37:12.279 --> 00:37:13.279
it's absolutely imperative

00:37:13.279 --> 00:37:15.279
that we as the people of God

00:37:15.279 --> 00:37:20.279
follow this principle in our lives.

00:37:20.279 --> 00:37:26.279
How did we get the truth that we have?

00:37:26.279 --> 00:37:27.279
God gave it,

00:37:27.279 --> 00:37:30.279
and then generations of believers

00:37:30.279 --> 00:37:34.279
followed this principle.

00:37:34.279 --> 00:37:36.279
They tried to stamp out Christianity,

00:37:36.279 --> 00:37:38.279
they tried to outlaw the Bible,

00:37:38.279 --> 00:37:40.279
they tried to burn the Bible.

00:37:40.279 --> 00:37:41.279
If you study anything

00:37:41.279 --> 00:37:42.279
about the English Bible

00:37:42.279 --> 00:37:44.279
and how we got our Bible,

00:37:44.279 --> 00:37:45.279
and the way in which many people

00:37:45.279 --> 00:37:46.279
were martyred,

00:37:46.279 --> 00:37:48.279
were killed for the faith,

00:37:48.279 --> 00:37:49.279
those that even simply

00:37:49.279 --> 00:37:51.279
had a copy of the Bible,

00:37:51.279 --> 00:37:52.279
if they were found with it,

00:37:52.279 --> 00:37:53.279
they would be imprisoned

00:37:53.279 --> 00:37:55.279
or worse, put to death.

00:37:55.279 --> 00:37:56.279
And they did all of that.

00:37:56.279 --> 00:37:57.279
Why?

00:37:57.279 --> 00:38:00.279
So somebody could have a Bible.

00:38:00.279 --> 00:38:01.279
We don't understand

00:38:01.279 --> 00:38:03.279
that level of investment today.

00:38:03.279 --> 00:38:04.279
We truly don't.

00:38:04.279 --> 00:38:06.279
It's really easy today.

00:38:06.279 --> 00:38:07.279
And maybe that's part of the reason

00:38:07.279 --> 00:38:12.279
that we've dropped the ball.

00:38:12.279 --> 00:38:15.279
And we find here

00:38:15.279 --> 00:38:17.279
this principle that God gives us,

00:38:17.279 --> 00:38:19.279
but it's absolutely imperative

00:38:19.279 --> 00:38:21.279
that each of us this morning

00:38:21.279 --> 00:38:23.279
take ownership of this principle,

00:38:23.279 --> 00:38:25.279
that we not only understand it,

00:38:25.279 --> 00:38:26.279
but we apply it,

00:38:26.279 --> 00:38:28.279
we introduce the truth

00:38:28.279 --> 00:38:29.279
in our own lives,

00:38:29.279 --> 00:38:31.279
and we incorporate the truth

00:38:31.279 --> 00:38:32.279
in our very lives,

00:38:32.279 --> 00:38:34.279
and we practice,

00:38:34.279 --> 00:38:36.279
we follow this principle

00:38:36.279 --> 00:38:38.279
in our lives.

00:38:38.279 --> 00:38:40.279
We could ask simply this morning,

00:38:40.279 --> 00:38:41.279
and I'd never want you

00:38:41.279 --> 00:38:43.279
to show a raised hand

00:38:43.279 --> 00:38:45.279
or to offer an audible answer,

00:38:45.279 --> 00:38:47.279
but I ask you this morning,

00:38:47.279 --> 00:38:49.279
if you were to examine your life,

00:38:49.279 --> 00:38:51.279
if you were to consider this morning,

00:38:51.279 --> 00:38:56.279
who are you investing in?

00:38:56.279 --> 00:38:58.279
If you've been given this principle,

00:38:58.279 --> 00:38:59.279
this truth, you say,

00:38:59.279 --> 00:39:00.279
no, it's written to Timothy,

00:39:00.279 --> 00:39:02.279
it's preserved for us,

00:39:02.279 --> 00:39:04.279
and the principle is applicable to us,

00:39:04.279 --> 00:39:07.279
who are you investing in?

00:39:07.279 --> 00:39:10.279
Who are you taking and teaching

00:39:10.279 --> 00:39:12.279
and sharing truth

00:39:12.279 --> 00:39:14.279
and leading them along?

00:39:14.279 --> 00:39:17.279
We call it discipleship.

00:39:17.279 --> 00:39:18.279
Who are we discipling?

00:39:18.279 --> 00:39:19.279
Who are we training?

00:39:19.279 --> 00:39:21.279
Who are we teaching?

00:39:21.279 --> 00:39:23.279
Because one day,

00:39:23.279 --> 00:39:25.279
I'm not going to be here anymore.

00:39:25.279 --> 00:39:28.279
You're not going to be here anymore.

00:39:28.279 --> 00:39:29.279
And we have to understand

00:39:29.279 --> 00:39:30.279
the importance of following

00:39:30.279 --> 00:39:32.279
this principle in our own lives.

00:39:32.279 --> 00:39:33.279
Let me say it this way,

00:39:33.279 --> 00:39:34.279
two thoughts.

00:39:34.279 --> 00:39:35.279
One, yes, it's true

00:39:35.279 --> 00:39:37.279
that we ought to follow this principle

00:39:37.279 --> 00:39:39.279
in the house of the Lord,

00:39:39.279 --> 00:39:40.279
in the house of the Lord.

00:39:40.279 --> 00:39:41.279
This is given to Timothy.

00:39:41.279 --> 00:39:43.279
He's the pastor at the church at Ephesus.

00:39:43.279 --> 00:39:45.279
We read of the church at Ephesus

00:39:45.279 --> 00:39:46.279
in Revelation chapter 2.

00:39:46.279 --> 00:39:47.279
There's much that we read

00:39:47.279 --> 00:39:48.279
of the church at Ephesus.

00:39:48.279 --> 00:39:50.279
In fact, the book of Ephesians

00:39:50.279 --> 00:39:52.279
is a book that's written there

00:39:52.279 --> 00:39:53.279
to those believers,

00:39:53.279 --> 00:39:54.279
and we have much insight

00:39:54.279 --> 00:39:55.279
that God gives us,

00:39:55.279 --> 00:39:57.279
and no doubt that even

00:39:57.279 --> 00:39:58.279
as we understood,

00:39:58.279 --> 00:39:59.279
as we studied,

00:39:59.279 --> 00:40:03.579
the first book, 1 Timothy chapter 3 and verse 15,

00:40:03.579 --> 00:40:06.079
but if I tarry long that thou mayest know how thou oughtest

00:40:06.079 --> 00:40:07.739
to behave thyself in the house of God,

00:40:07.739 --> 00:40:09.379
which is the church of the living God,

00:40:09.379 --> 00:40:10.699
the pillar and ground of the truth.

00:40:10.699 --> 00:40:15.119
And so we understand that Timothy had an awareness

00:40:15.119 --> 00:40:18.199
of the responsibility within the house of the Lord

00:40:18.199 --> 00:40:20.999
of this principally being employed

00:40:20.999 --> 00:40:22.159
within the house of the Lord.

00:40:22.159 --> 00:40:24.239
Let me draw your attention to the book of Jude.

00:40:24.239 --> 00:40:25.659
You can leave 2 Timothy,

00:40:25.659 --> 00:40:28.539
look over at the book of Jude, if you will.

00:40:28.619 --> 00:40:33.119
Just one chapter in the book of Jude and a short chapter,

00:40:33.119 --> 00:40:38.119
but the content is absolutely impactful and powerful.

00:40:38.159 --> 00:40:39.959
It's amazing what God can give us

00:40:39.959 --> 00:40:42.219
in 25 verses of scripture.

00:40:42.219 --> 00:40:44.619
In Jude chapter number one, there's only one chapter.

00:40:44.619 --> 00:40:48.499
The Bible says this in verse three, Jude verse three,

00:40:48.499 --> 00:40:51.619
beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you

00:40:51.619 --> 00:40:54.299
the common salvation, it was needful for me to write

00:40:54.299 --> 00:40:57.499
unto you and to exhort you that you should earnestly

00:40:57.499 --> 00:40:59.659
contend for the faith, which was once delivered

00:40:59.659 --> 00:41:02.299
unto the saints, for there are certain men crept

00:41:02.299 --> 00:41:04.579
in unawares who were before of old ordained

00:41:04.579 --> 00:41:07.499
to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace

00:41:07.499 --> 00:41:09.779
of our God into lasciviousness and denying

00:41:09.779 --> 00:41:13.399
the only Lord God and our Lord, Jesus Christ.

00:41:13.399 --> 00:41:15.599
Can I tell you that just in the first century,

00:41:15.599 --> 00:41:17.859
how these certain men crept in unawares,

00:41:17.859 --> 00:41:20.119
it's continued throughout the church age.

00:41:21.519 --> 00:41:23.659
And can I tell you that they're, as I mentioned

00:41:23.659 --> 00:41:25.419
by way of introduction, they're peddling

00:41:25.419 --> 00:41:26.679
their false teaching.

00:41:27.499 --> 00:41:29.579
They're propagating their false teaching.

00:41:29.579 --> 00:41:34.579
They're using, I have quotes that I could share with you

00:41:34.739 --> 00:41:39.579
from those that are of an ungodly perspective,

00:41:39.579 --> 00:41:41.779
and they talk about using the classroom

00:41:41.779 --> 00:41:44.539
of the public school arena as their place,

00:41:44.539 --> 00:41:48.019
their pulpit, just as they would use in any church

00:41:48.019 --> 00:41:51.619
from any pastor, any clergyman, that they indoctrinate

00:41:51.619 --> 00:41:55.379
the next generation, and they speak about humanism

00:41:55.419 --> 00:42:00.419
being religion, it is, and that's what they're pushing.

00:42:02.499 --> 00:42:06.499
And by the way, if you look at the block of young people

00:42:06.499 --> 00:42:11.499
in our nation, you can see how successful they have been

00:42:11.979 --> 00:42:16.679
on indoctrinating the minds of the next generation.

00:42:19.659 --> 00:42:21.379
These men crept in unawares, so what are we to do?

00:42:21.379 --> 00:42:24.299
Well, we're to earnestly contend for the faith

00:42:24.299 --> 00:42:27.019
that was once delivered unto the saints,

00:42:27.019 --> 00:42:30.139
and we like, and I've never run a race

00:42:30.139 --> 00:42:33.779
that's the passing of the baton, a relay kind of race

00:42:33.779 --> 00:42:35.219
with one person doing one leg.

00:42:35.219 --> 00:42:37.619
I've never done it, I'm not a runner,

00:42:37.619 --> 00:42:40.139
but the reality is that I understand how it works,

00:42:40.139 --> 00:42:43.419
and if I'm going to do the four by whatever race I'm doing,

00:42:43.419 --> 00:42:45.799
I run my leg of the race with my baton,

00:42:45.799 --> 00:42:47.539
and I hand it to the next person

00:42:47.539 --> 00:42:49.459
who's gonna run their leg of the race.

00:42:51.139 --> 00:42:53.079
I think, I didn't watch the Olympics,

00:42:53.079 --> 00:42:55.799
I watched a little tiny bit of the two basketball games,

00:42:55.799 --> 00:42:57.999
but I didn't watch the Olympics as a whole.

00:42:59.919 --> 00:43:01.599
I think, from what I read,

00:43:01.599 --> 00:43:04.819
our team dropped the baton at one point.

00:43:05.919 --> 00:43:09.779
That's a disaster, it's a disaster.

00:43:09.779 --> 00:43:13.839
You're not gonna win the race if you drop the baton.

00:43:17.319 --> 00:43:18.759
I was at a pastor's meeting on Tuesday,

00:43:18.759 --> 00:43:21.039
and I made a comment, Mike Aylstock actually was

00:43:21.039 --> 00:43:22.639
one of the guys that preached, I made a comment,

00:43:23.199 --> 00:43:25.439
we were talking after the service,

00:43:25.439 --> 00:43:29.119
I think Brother Aylstock, 70, 71, 72, something like that,

00:43:30.039 --> 00:43:31.239
and here's what he said,

00:43:32.639 --> 00:43:35.759
I don't wanna mess up the baton pass.

00:43:35.759 --> 00:43:39.759
I don't wanna mess up the baton pass.

00:43:39.759 --> 00:43:44.759
Yeah, it's vital, but it's not just in the house of God,

00:43:45.279 --> 00:43:49.119
it's in your house, and it's in my house.

00:43:49.119 --> 00:43:51.239
Look over to the book of Ephesians, if you will.

00:43:51.239 --> 00:43:53.599
Ephesians chapter number six, and I want you to notice,

00:43:53.599 --> 00:43:55.759
it's a familiar passage of scripture to us,

00:43:55.759 --> 00:43:57.519
but I want you to notice what God tells us,

00:43:57.519 --> 00:44:00.719
because in our house, it's not just in the house of God,

00:44:00.719 --> 00:44:03.999
although it's true that it should be in the house of God,

00:44:03.999 --> 00:44:06.439
that we're investing in the next generation,

00:44:06.439 --> 00:44:07.599
but it must be in your house.

00:44:07.599 --> 00:44:10.079
By the way, let me say this, it starts at your house.

00:44:10.079 --> 00:44:11.719
It starts at my house.

00:44:11.719 --> 00:44:14.919
Do you know how easy it is for you to undermine

00:44:14.919 --> 00:44:18.279
at your home what the preacher says in one hour,

00:44:18.559 --> 00:44:22.519
when you have all day and all night and all week?

00:44:22.519 --> 00:44:27.039
It's super simple to undermine the teaching of God's word

00:44:27.039 --> 00:44:29.759
that is given from the pulpit,

00:44:29.759 --> 00:44:33.579
from the classroom throughout the week.

00:44:33.579 --> 00:44:36.079
The amount of time that someone spends in church

00:44:36.079 --> 00:44:38.879
is so limited with regard to the amount of time

00:44:38.879 --> 00:44:41.359
that someone spends at their home,

00:44:41.359 --> 00:44:43.439
and it's so vital that we understand

00:44:43.439 --> 00:44:44.799
that it begins at your house.

00:44:45.639 --> 00:44:50.639
Really, the idea is that we would have the opportunity

00:44:50.799 --> 00:44:54.699
to be able to enforce and to reinforce

00:44:54.699 --> 00:44:56.959
the message that's being taught at home,

00:44:56.959 --> 00:44:58.519
and the message that's being taught at home,

00:44:58.519 --> 00:45:00.159
and the message that's being taught in the church,

00:45:00.159 --> 00:45:03.119
they're of the same message,

00:45:03.119 --> 00:45:05.639
and they're reinforcing one another.

00:45:05.639 --> 00:45:07.019
I'm not gonna ask you to turn there,

00:45:07.019 --> 00:45:10.279
but in Psalm 106, the Bible says this in verse 25,

00:45:10.279 --> 00:45:12.919
but murmured in their tents,

00:45:12.919 --> 00:45:15.399
and hearken not unto the voice of the Lord.

00:45:15.399 --> 00:45:16.599
You know what their tent was?

00:45:16.599 --> 00:45:18.859
It was their house, it was their dwelling place,

00:45:18.859 --> 00:45:20.599
and they murmured there,

00:45:20.599 --> 00:45:24.039
and it caused a great impact on the next generation.

00:45:24.039 --> 00:45:27.119
You read Psalm 106, and you see it laid out there,

00:45:27.119 --> 00:45:28.919
and we find here in Ephesians six,

00:45:28.919 --> 00:45:30.839
the Bible says this in verse number four,

00:45:30.839 --> 00:45:33.559
and ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath,

00:45:33.559 --> 00:45:34.379
but do what?

00:45:34.379 --> 00:45:39.379
Bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.

00:45:40.379 --> 00:45:43.139
It's a great responsibility.

00:45:43.139 --> 00:45:45.219
It's a great responsibility.

00:45:45.219 --> 00:45:46.579
It's a great privilege.

00:45:48.059 --> 00:45:52.059
This morning, when we look at this passage of Scripture,

00:45:53.819 --> 00:45:58.139
this vital truth that begins 2 Timothy chapter number two,

00:45:59.259 --> 00:46:00.579
teach others also,

00:46:01.699 --> 00:46:03.539
our response to this truth

00:46:05.059 --> 00:46:08.339
will have long-lasting consequences.

00:46:09.259 --> 00:46:11.979
Whether we respond by embracing

00:46:15.099 --> 00:46:18.179
and actively being engaged in investing,

00:46:18.179 --> 00:46:19.779
or respond by ignoring and saying,

00:46:19.779 --> 00:46:22.219
you know, somebody else can do that.

00:46:23.419 --> 00:46:24.719
Somebody else can do that.

00:46:27.179 --> 00:46:28.979
The consequences are long-lasting,

00:46:30.419 --> 00:46:33.019
and we see what's happening in our generation today.

00:46:36.019 --> 00:46:37.099
How did we get here?

00:46:38.939 --> 00:46:40.619
How did we get here?

00:46:40.619 --> 00:46:42.619
I talked to a man at his door years ago.

00:46:44.339 --> 00:46:46.299
Asked him if he knew for sure that heaven was his home,

00:46:46.299 --> 00:46:51.299
and he was a little bit contentious, if you will,

00:46:51.479 --> 00:46:55.459
and you can't really know that, and so on and so forth,

00:46:55.459 --> 00:46:58.859
and I said, and he said something about, you know,

00:46:58.859 --> 00:47:00.859
just be sincere, everything, you know,

00:47:00.859 --> 00:47:02.739
as long as you're sincere, you'll just make it,

00:47:02.739 --> 00:47:05.339
and I said, well, actually, Jesus said in John 14,

00:47:05.419 --> 00:47:08.179
I am the way, and as I got right there,

00:47:08.179 --> 00:47:10.339
he said the truth and the life,

00:47:10.339 --> 00:47:13.139
no man cometh unto the Father but by me.

00:47:13.139 --> 00:47:15.299
He finished quoting the verse of Scripture.

00:47:16.779 --> 00:47:20.219
I was like, wow, how'd you know that verse?

00:47:20.219 --> 00:47:21.219
Oh, I grew up in Sunday school,

00:47:21.219 --> 00:47:22.499
I grew up in a church just like yours,

00:47:22.499 --> 00:47:24.499
but I don't believe any of that anymore.

00:47:27.019 --> 00:47:28.779
I don't believe any of that anymore.

00:47:29.939 --> 00:47:31.799
I had hours of conversation with that man

00:47:31.799 --> 00:47:35.559
over the next few weeks, and unfortunately,

00:47:35.559 --> 00:47:38.599
that man completely just threw away

00:47:38.599 --> 00:47:40.199
everything that he'd ever heard,

00:47:41.399 --> 00:47:43.919
and was following a new religion,

00:47:43.919 --> 00:47:46.919
the religion of humanism, really, is what he was following,

00:47:47.799 --> 00:47:51.319
and this morning, we must understand

00:47:51.319 --> 00:47:55.119
this truth of investing, teaching others also,

00:47:55.119 --> 00:47:57.919
investing in the future generation.

00:47:57.919 --> 00:47:59.519
None of us will be here forever,

00:48:00.519 --> 00:48:03.399
but God's work, until the rapture,

00:48:05.239 --> 00:48:08.159
our prayer is that the work of God continues on.

00:48:08.159 --> 00:48:09.559
Now, I hope I'm here for the rapture,

00:48:09.559 --> 00:48:12.519
but the reality is that generations of believers

00:48:12.519 --> 00:48:15.279
have anticipated being here for the rapture,

00:48:16.999 --> 00:48:18.359
and if I'm not here for the rapture,

00:48:18.359 --> 00:48:22.199
I want there to be a church in Oakden, Virginia

00:48:22.199 --> 00:48:24.839
that stands for the truth of the gospel,

00:48:25.519 --> 00:48:29.959
that continues to do what God has called us to do.

00:48:31.119 --> 00:48:33.959
We must teach others also.

00:48:33.959 --> 00:48:34.799
Let's pray together.

00:48:34.799 --> 00:48:35.639
Father, we love you.

00:48:35.639 --> 00:48:37.079
We thank you for loving us.

00:48:37.079 --> 00:48:41.399
Thank you for your word, the truth contained therein.

00:48:41.399 --> 00:48:46.399
Lord, I think the truth has been plainly given this morning.

00:48:46.479 --> 00:48:48.359
We're either actively involved

00:48:48.359 --> 00:48:50.519
in investing in others, or we're not.

00:48:51.359 --> 00:48:52.759
Maybe there's someone this morning

00:48:52.759 --> 00:48:55.359
that's not actively involved, but they want to be,

00:48:55.359 --> 00:48:56.879
they desire to be.

00:48:56.879 --> 00:49:00.879
Lord, I pray that you would help them to have opportunity

00:49:00.879 --> 00:49:03.799
to be able to actively invest in others.

00:49:05.039 --> 00:49:08.559
Lord, I pray that you would use us

00:49:08.559 --> 00:49:10.559
for your honor and for your glory,

00:49:10.559 --> 00:49:13.359
as we seek to teach others also.

00:49:14.319 --> 00:49:15.599
I pray that you'd have your will and way

00:49:15.599 --> 00:49:18.079
in the lives of those who are in need,

00:49:18.079 --> 00:49:19.039
that you'd have your will and way

00:49:19.039 --> 00:49:22.079
in the lives of those that are gathered this morning,

00:49:23.079 --> 00:49:26.279
that decisions would be made that would please thee.

00:49:26.279 --> 00:49:27.879
We'll thank you for it.

00:49:27.879 --> 00:49:28.839
In Christ's name we pray.

00:49:28.839 --> 00:49:30.239
Would you stand with me?

00:49:30.239 --> 00:49:31.359
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

00:49:31.359 --> 00:49:34.039
Kimberly's gonna play quietly on the piano.

00:49:34.039 --> 00:49:36.559
As she plays, the altar is open.

00:49:36.559 --> 00:49:40.119
Maybe you're not investing in others as you should be,

00:49:40.119 --> 00:49:42.879
and you want to confess that to the Lord

00:49:42.879 --> 00:49:44.279
and ask God to give you an opportunity.

00:49:44.279 --> 00:49:45.839
Maybe you are investing, and you pray

00:49:45.839 --> 00:49:48.279
that God would continue to give you opportunity.

00:49:49.359 --> 00:49:51.759
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.

00:49:51.759 --> 00:49:56.759
