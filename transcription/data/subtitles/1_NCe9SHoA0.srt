1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
But before we get there, I'm going to be reading a passage from John 17.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And so perhaps you want to start in John chapter number 17.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And I'm going to read our text from 1 John.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
But then I'm going to immediately go to the book of John in the 17th chapter.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Of course, we know that God has used the human penman for this book that we're studying here on Sunday mornings.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The book of 1 John with our theme from this book in verse number 7 of chapter 1.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
If we walk in the light as he is in the light, our theme is walking in the light.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And so thankful for the truth that God has given us already through this book of 1 John.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Last week on Sunday morning, we looked at verses 12 through 14.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And we noted the three groups of people that are identified and written to.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The little children, the young men, and the fathers.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And as we looked at that passage of scripture, we made note as to the particulars that were mentioned with regard to them.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And we understand that the young men were said to have overcome the wicked one because of the spiritual strength received from the word of God.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And I'm so thankful for God's word and for the truth of God's word.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And the way in which his word will give us the strength that we need as we continue through the book of 1 John.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And this morning, looking at verses 15 through 17, we find that the passage begins with what I'll refer to as a stern warning.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
For those who are being addressed, and he begins by saying this,

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world.

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:46,000
For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the Father, but is of the world.

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,000
The world passeth away in the lust thereof, but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever.

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
We think about this stern warning that is issued under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God by the Apostle John to those in whom he is writing.

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:09,000
But I'm mindful, as I mentioned, that John chapter number 17 records for us just moments before the Lord Jesus Christ would go to the cross of Calvary.

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
The Bible begins in John 17 and verse number 11, and it says this,

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world.

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So I want you to pay attention as we read through and notice this word world that is used so often.

27
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It says, And I come to thee, Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one as we are.

28
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name.

29
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition, that the Scripture might be fulfilled.

30
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Verse 13, And now come I to thee, in these things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves.

31
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I have given them thy word, and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.

32
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.

33
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.

34
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Sanctify them through thy truth, thy word is truth.

35
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.

36
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And for their sakes I sanctified myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth.

37
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:45,000
As we notice in these verses of Scripture from John 17, many times the Lord Jesus Christ is referring to the world.

38
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And he says this, that he's given us his word in verse 14,

39
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And the world hateth them, hath hated them, why? Because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.

40
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Now he says this in verse 15, I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world.

41
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:11,000
No doubt as believers there have been times in our lives where we thought, man, it'd be just great if we could go to heaven, amen, and leave this old world.

42
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:21,000
But God did not ordain it that at the time of salvation we would immediately leave this world to go to our heavenly home, our eternal abode.

43
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,000
But he ordained it that he would leave us here for the purpose of being his representatives, his witnesses.

44
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And he says in verse 15, I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them, notice, from the evil.

45
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And then he says this in verse number 18, as thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.

46
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,000
And we think about this truth that is revealed to us in John 17 and coupled with what we read in 1 John chapter number 2,

47
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:04,000
and we are immediately confronted with a real difficulty that the child of God will face in his life with the world, the world in which we live.

48
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Now, when God speaks of the world, we understand that he speaks of creation as the world.

49
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
That's not what he's speaking about here in 1 John chapter number 2.

50
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
When he speaks of the world, there are times in which he speaks about the people.

51
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
For God so loved the world, right?

52
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:30,000
When he talks about in 1 John 2, in verse number 2, and he is the propitiation for our sins and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.

53
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
He's talking about the people.

54
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
That's not what he's speaking about in 1 John 2 and verse number 15 when he says, love not the world.

55
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
He's not talking about the creation.

56
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
He's not talking about the people.

57
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
He's talking about the world system.

58
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And the Bible tells us that the God of this world, the little g, the God of this world is Satan himself,

59
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
and he's speaking about this world system in which we live.

60
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
As believers, we must acknowledge that this world is not my home.

61
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Aren't you thankful for that?

62
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
That this world system and the way in which it operates and the way in which it's controlled,

63
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
that this is not my home, that this is not all there is for us.

64
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
That's a blessing.

65
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
My citizenship is in heaven.

66
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Just like he said in Hebrews 11 and verse number 13, we are strangers and we are pilgrims.

67
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm not home, but I'm heading home.

68
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Isn't that a blessing?

69
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
And so this morning as we look at this portion of Scripture in 1 John 2 in verses 15 through 17,

70
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I've simply titled the message this morning, love not the world.

71
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I want you to notice with me as we begin this morning the progression of worldliness,

72
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
the progression of worldliness.

73
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
We find here that he says, love not the world, neither the things that are in the world.

74
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him in verse number 15.

75
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
As we think about this progression of worldliness, we find that this term,

76
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
speaking about believers and their interaction with the world,

77
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
is used throughout a number of portions of Scripture.

78
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
We'll review several of those this morning as we consider this progression of worldliness.

79
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
But at the onset of the message this morning,

80
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I want us to be mindful of this wonderful truth that God gives us in the book of Ephesians,

81
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
and I hope that it will help us as we begin here in Ephesians 2

82
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
to help develop and understand this progression and how we combat it.

83
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Notice in Ephesians chapter number 2,

84
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
we must remember this truth that prior to salvation,

85
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
we walked according to the course of this world.

86
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Notice in Ephesians 2 in verse number 1, it says,

87
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
He made us alive.

88
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
That's salvation.

89
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And I'm so thankful.

90
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Yes, I was dead in my trespasses and in my sins,

91
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
but he hath quickened me by his great mercy and by his grace.

92
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It says in verse number 2, notice this,

93
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:06,000
wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world.

94
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Notice this, according to the prince of the power of the air,

95
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience.

96
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Notice in verse number 3, among whom also we all had our conversation in times past,

97
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
in the lust of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind,

98
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.

99
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
We begin to understand this truth this morning when we consider the progression of worldliness.

100
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
The reality is that prior to salvation, according to verses 2 and 3,

101
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
we all had our conversation in this world,

102
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
and we all walked according to the course of this world.

103
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
We were fulfilling the lust of this world.

104
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
We were lost, and we were on our way to a Christless eternity.

105
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
And the reality is that as we understand that that is our past,

106
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
if you've been born again this morning, if you've trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal Savior,

107
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
if you could sing that song that we started out with this morning,

108
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
that I'm saved by the blood of the crucified one,

109
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:21,000
now I am saved and I am in the world, but I'm not of the world.

110
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
And we understand what's happening and what God gives us in His Word

111
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:32,000
with regard to all of this transpiring and this great battle that takes place.

112
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
So here's what happens. I was walking after the course of this world.

113
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Now I'm saved. I have a new nature.

114
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Jesus now is my Savior, and the Holy Spirit of God indwells me.

115
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm heaven-bound, and He's left me here for the purpose of being His witness, His representative.

116
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And He says that we're in the world, but we're not of the world.

117
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
But my flesh and your flesh still remains. Correct?

118
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:08,779
And so here's what happens, the enemy is constantly, constantly trying to allure us

119
00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:12,340
and to taint us by this world.

120
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:20,020
He knows that we had our course in time past, and we walked according to the course of this

121
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,020
world.

122
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:27,540
And so he understands that truth, but now as believers and we consider this truth of

123
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:34,700
the progression of worldliness, we are mindful that John says, love not the world, neither

124
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,979
the things that are in the world.

125
00:10:35,979 --> 00:10:40,500
I don't believe that it first starts with loving the world.

126
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:46,419
That allure, that Satan is trying to tempt us and trying to taint us and pull us in.

127
00:10:46,419 --> 00:10:51,979
James 4 and verse number 4 tells us that we're not to be a friend of the world.

128
00:10:51,979 --> 00:10:56,040
Notice what the Bible says in James chapter number 4 and verse number 4, when we think

129
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:02,040
about these truths and consider the progression this morning of worldliness by way of really

130
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:07,760
getting into this passage in 1 John, notice the Bible says this in James 4 and verse number

131
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:14,760
4, ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity

132
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:21,339
with God, whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.

133
00:11:21,339 --> 00:11:24,980
You say, pastor, that's strong language, that's Bible.

134
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:31,379
When he says ye adulterers and adulteresses, I immediately, my mind races back to the book

135
00:11:31,379 --> 00:11:37,519
of Hosea, to the prophets of Israel when they were prophesying and they were preaching and

136
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:44,459
proclaiming that they, the nation had left and they followed after idols and they were

137
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:49,699
guilty of this spiritual adultery.

138
00:11:49,699 --> 00:11:55,819
We find here that God says that we're not to have friendship with the world because

139
00:11:55,819 --> 00:11:59,059
friendship with the world is enmity with God.

140
00:11:59,059 --> 00:12:03,940
And he says, whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.

141
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:07,440
I don't want to be God's enemy, amen?

142
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,500
And so it begins with this friendship and we find that the Bible tells us, look back

143
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:17,979
a few passages or a few pages in James 1 and verse number 27, notice what he says here,

144
00:12:17,979 --> 00:12:22,100
pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, to visit the fatherless

145
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:29,139
and widows in their affliction, notice what he says, and to keep himself unspotted from

146
00:12:29,139 --> 00:12:31,020
the world.

147
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:33,419
You know what happens when I begin to be a friend of the world?

148
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:36,580
I begin to be spotted by the world.

149
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:41,899
So I have no friendship with the world so that I can keep myself unspotted from the

150
00:12:41,899 --> 00:12:46,899
world, James 1 and verse number 27, and we find that we then come to 1 John 2 where we

151
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:52,259
see that the Bible says, love not the world, neither the things that are in the world.

152
00:12:52,259 --> 00:12:54,479
See that love doesn't happen overnight.

153
00:12:54,479 --> 00:12:56,660
It's not something that just immediately takes place.

154
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:01,220
There's this progression of worldliness and the reality is that the enemy wants you to

155
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:05,220
be worldly, the enemy wants me to be worldly so that we could be at odds with God so that

156
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:10,160
we can be ineffective in the purpose in which God has left us here.

157
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,639
God has left us here to be different.

158
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,740
We're not to be like the world.

159
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,320
We're not to love the world.

160
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,679
He tells us, love not the world.

161
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:19,600
Do you remember Demas?

162
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,320
The Bible tells us of Demas, that he hath forsaken me, what does it say?

163
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,559
Having loved this present world.

164
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:32,600
In Romans chapter number 12, we read of that great truth in verses 1 and 2 where Paul gives

165
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:38,520
this really a culmination of the book of Romans and he comes to this 12th chapter and he says,

166
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:43,320
I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies

167
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:48,360
a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service, and

168
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:55,679
then he says this, and be not conformed to this world, but be transformed, how?

169
00:13:55,679 --> 00:14:01,520
By the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and

170
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:05,580
perfect will of God.

171
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,839
How do I prevent this progression?

172
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,440
We'll look at some things here in just a moment that I hope will be a blessing to you and

173
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,600
will help us as we consider this progression of worldliness, but I want you to be mindful

174
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:21,320
of this, if I could use an illustration quickly from the book of Genesis.

175
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:27,279
Notice back in Genesis chapter number 13, I'll say this, Lot didn't end up in Sodom

176
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,920
overnight.

177
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,440
Lot didn't end up in Sodom overnight.

178
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:37,000
The Bible tells us in Genesis chapter number 13, in verse number 12, but even if you think

179
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,799
about the context in the book of Genesis, it tells us in chapter 13 and verse number

180
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:46,359
7, there was a strife there between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and the herdmen of Lot's

181
00:14:46,359 --> 00:14:50,600
cattle, and the Bible tells us that the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelt in the land at that

182
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:55,760
time, according to Genesis 13 and verse number 7.

183
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:01,239
Abram says that there should be no strife, and the instruction is given with regard to

184
00:15:01,239 --> 00:15:06,359
where they would go and how they would depart, and it tells us in verse number 12 of Genesis

185
00:15:06,359 --> 00:15:11,820
13 that Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, but it says this, that Lot dwelt in the cities

186
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:19,119
of the plain, but notice this phrase, he pitched his tent towards Sodom.

187
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:20,760
He pitched his tent towards Sodom.

188
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,799
He's not in Sodom.

189
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:25,559
He's just pitched his tent towards Sodom.

190
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:31,079
The Bible tells us, if you consider the progression in chapter number 14, of course you read of

191
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:36,279
the battle that takes place and how Abram is going to deliver Lot, but notice what the

192
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:39,160
Bible tells us about this great battle.

193
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:46,399
It tells us in verse number 12 of Genesis 14, and they took Lot, Abram's brother's son.

194
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:55,600
Notice this phrase, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed, and so Lot was now,

195
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,760
in Genesis 13, he had pitched his tent towards Sodom, but now in Genesis chapter 14 and verse

196
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:06,000
number 12, the Bible tells us that he dwelt in Sodom.

197
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,920
As you continue through the book of Genesis, you come to the 19th chapter, and you find

198
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,000
something very interesting in the first verse.

199
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,600
Of course, in chapter 18, God had revealed to Abraham that he was going to destroy Sodom

200
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,760
and Gomorrah because of their wickedness, but the Bible tells us that these angels come

201
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:25,519
to the city of Sodom, and even in Genesis 19 and verse number 1, and I want you to notice

202
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:30,480
that the Bible says that Lot sat in the gate of Sodom.

203
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:36,320
He had some level of influence and some level of responsibility, perhaps even being a judge

204
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:41,359
in the city at some level, and the Bible tells us that they, as these two angels came into

205
00:16:41,359 --> 00:16:44,720
the city, that Lot sat in the gate.

206
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,399
He sat in the gate of Sodom.

207
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:50,359
He didn't get there overnight.

208
00:16:50,359 --> 00:16:52,279
He pitched his tent towards Sodom.

209
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:53,920
There was a progression.

210
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:59,119
He dwelt in Sodom, and then now he's sitting in the gate of Sodom.

211
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:04,799
We begin to think about the progression of worldliness this morning, and we find where

212
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:13,640
John says in 1 John 2, love not the world, neither the things that are in the world.

213
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:18,959
Notice what he says, if any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.

214
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,760
Again, strong language.

215
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:27,720
God is being very direct and very strong with regard to this situation, and we must understand

216
00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:34,239
that the enemy, again, is constantly trying to allure us by the things of this world,

217
00:17:34,239 --> 00:17:39,440
the glitter and the shiny and all of the things of this world.

218
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,000
We begin to consider the progression, but now I want you to notice as we continue to

219
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,880
make progress through this passage of Scripture, number two this morning, the pitfalls to avoid.

220
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,920
I'm thankful for verse number 16.

221
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:55,880
God gives us here in this verse of Scripture some pitfalls to avoid.

222
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:00,559
Notice what he says, for all that is in the world, and then he lists these three things,

223
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:06,720
the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the Father,

224
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,079
but is of the world.

225
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:15,000
Notice he begins with the lust of the flesh, that materialism, that consumerism, and is

226
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,600
it not true that we live in a society, in a culture where there is a great lust of the

227
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,600
flesh?

228
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:26,239
It's amazing when you think about our society and you think about our culture, obviously

229
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:31,839
as a nation we're in crazy amounts of debt, but the population of America, for the most

230
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:36,539
part, and I'm thankful that there are some that aren't bound by this, but there are many

231
00:18:36,539 --> 00:18:43,840
that are in great depths of debt because of this materialism, because of this consumerism,

232
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:49,359
because of this lust of the flesh, and we find that the enemy often uses, as you think

233
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:52,520
about the connection between the lust of the flesh and then the second point that he

234
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:55,119
brings up, the lust of the eyes.

235
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:57,679
How often the enemy uses the eye gate.

236
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:05,359
You think about the marketing industry and all of their creativity and all of their approach

237
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:11,919
to try to get you and to get me, to get our society to think that we absolutely need whatever

238
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:17,119
this thing is that they're marketing, and that we just flat out cannot live life without

239
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:20,159
it.

240
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:24,840
You think about this world system and you think about the lust of the flesh, the lust

241
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:30,320
of the eyes, he then mentions the pride of life, understanding this morning that pride

242
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:36,440
is at the very center of sin in general as we speak about the danger of pride, the deception

243
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,520
of pride, the destruction of pride.

244
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:44,320
And we understand this morning that as you look at these three pitfalls that are mentioned,

245
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:49,039
the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, the pride of life, and we think about the

246
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:53,880
truth that he gives us at the end of the verse, he says, this is not of the Father, but is

247
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,880
of the world.

248
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,880
It's of the world.

249
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,239
Turn back to the book of Genesis once again.

250
00:19:58,239 --> 00:20:00,000
We were in Genesis looking at this…

251
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,480
progression, but I want you to go to Genesis 3, a familiar portion of Scripture for many

252
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,960
of us this morning, and we know this as being the account in which the Bible records for

253
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,960
us the fall of man when sin entered into the world.

254
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:18,280
And I want you to see that in this very passage of Scripture, that the lust of the flesh,

255
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:22,239
the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life is all contained.

256
00:20:22,239 --> 00:20:29,040
We find that here oftentimes as we look at this passage of Scripture, perhaps we are

257
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:34,639
mindful of what takes place and we're familiar with the account, but we must recognize this

258
00:20:34,639 --> 00:20:39,159
morning that the enemy still uses the same approach.

259
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:44,319
The lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life.

260
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:48,279
Notice in verse number one, now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field

261
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:50,159
which the Lord God had made.

262
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:55,360
And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the

263
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,360
garden.

264
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:00,400
And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden,

265
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,360
but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall

266
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,379
not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.

267
00:21:07,379 --> 00:21:12,480
And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die.

268
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,480
For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall

269
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,879
be as gods, knowing good and evil.

270
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:23,360
Notice this in verse number six.

271
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:32,720
And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, we see the lust of the flesh.

272
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,139
Oftentimes we think about the lust of the flesh, we are immediately thinking of sensuality

273
00:21:37,139 --> 00:21:42,800
and sexual desires, and certainly there's truth in the Word of God about fleeing fornication

274
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,839
and fleeing youthful lust and all of that truth.

275
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:51,319
You see here that the lust of the flesh for Eve was that it was good for food.

276
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:56,559
She saw it, the Bible tells us, notice it continues and says that it was pleasant to

277
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:57,559
the eyes.

278
00:21:57,559 --> 00:22:00,239
It was pleasant to the eyes.

279
00:22:00,239 --> 00:22:03,639
The lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes.

280
00:22:03,639 --> 00:22:09,800
But notice this as the verse continues, that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to

281
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:16,479
be desired why, to make one wise.

282
00:22:16,479 --> 00:22:17,479
So what did she do?

283
00:22:17,479 --> 00:22:22,000
She took of the fruit thereof and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her, and

284
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,679
he did eat.

285
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:27,160
The eyes of them both were open, and they knew that they were naked, and they sewed

286
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,960
fig leaves together and made themselves aprons.

287
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:34,160
We're familiar with all that takes place here with the judgment and all that God does and

288
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:38,919
how at the end of the passage He provides for them a coat of skins and the grace and

289
00:22:38,919 --> 00:22:43,639
mercy of God that is displayed there, but we find here in verse number 6 exactly what

290
00:22:43,639 --> 00:22:48,759
we find in 1 John 2 and verse number 16 when He tells us there's some pitfalls to avoid.

291
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:54,880
The lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, the pride of life, and we see these possessions

292
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,880
in position.

293
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:00,080
If we could note that this morning and we can see here in the life of Eve where then

294
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:04,479
all three are active in verse number 6, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and

295
00:23:04,479 --> 00:23:11,240
the pride of life, and the enemy continues to use the same playbook.

296
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:18,199
And it's so sad that he uses the same playbook and there are still countless people that

297
00:23:18,199 --> 00:23:21,339
become casualties.

298
00:23:21,339 --> 00:23:24,080
The allure, the pitfalls to avoid.

299
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,600
The question that I ask if I'm going to mention the pitfalls that are given to us here in

300
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:32,520
verse number 16, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, I'd

301
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,520
ask the question, how can I avoid these pitfalls?

302
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,440
Is it even possible that I can avoid these pitfalls?

303
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,240
The answer is yes.

304
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:46,520
Five simple thoughts, really six simple thoughts this morning on how we can avoid these pitfalls.

305
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:51,860
Number one, and this might be a little bit too basic, but I would say it's necessary,

306
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:54,199
we avoid them first by knowing what they are.

307
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:58,279
If I don't know what they are, it's going to be hard for me to avoid them.

308
00:23:58,279 --> 00:24:01,639
But when I know that He tells me it's the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and

309
00:24:01,639 --> 00:24:06,839
the pride of life, all that is in the world, and He sums them up in these three statements,

310
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:13,339
then I know what these pitfalls are, and God, with God's help and by God's grace, and having

311
00:24:13,339 --> 00:24:15,800
a knowledge of them, I can avoid them.

312
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,480
Notice this, I believe that we must put on the whole armor of God.

313
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,920
We're familiar with the passage of Scripture in Ephesians chapter number 6 that we're to

314
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:27,279
be strong in the Lord and the power of His might, that we're to put on the whole armor

315
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:28,279
of God.

316
00:24:28,279 --> 00:24:32,119
And when He goes through and He begins to list for us what those pieces of armor are,

317
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:36,839
we do not have time this morning to develop all of that, but it's necessary for us daily

318
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:40,720
to put on that whole armor of God.

319
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:48,839
Because we understand that that enemy, our enemy, he's going to shoot those fiery darts.

320
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:54,320
And we find that we put on that whole armor of God, I'd say this, as Paul recorded for

321
00:24:54,320 --> 00:25:00,079
us there in the book of Philippians, how that he learned contentment, number three,

322
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:03,440
of how to avoid these pitfalls, knowing what they are, number one, number two, putting

323
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:09,559
on the whole armor of God, number three, by learning contentment, by learning contentment.

324
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:14,119
The apostle Paul says this in the book of Philippians with regard to the subject matter

325
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:18,119
of contentment, and what a blessing to think about this truth.

326
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:23,799
He says, not that I speak in respect of want, notice, for I have learned in whatsoever state

327
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:26,679
I am therewith to be content.

328
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:30,679
I've always, as I look at this passage of Scripture, I've always focused and really

329
00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:37,799
considered the importance of that phrase when he says, for I have learned.

330
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:44,760
You know, in our most basic state, we are not content people.

331
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,160
We're not.

332
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,519
You think about the nation of Israel.

333
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:50,440
How many times were they complaining and murmuring?

334
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,040
What was that indicative of?

335
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:55,239
It was indicative of their discontentment.

336
00:25:55,239 --> 00:25:58,239
They didn't like what God had provided for them.

337
00:25:58,239 --> 00:26:02,399
They're eating manna and they're saying, my soul loatheth, I hate this manna.

338
00:26:02,399 --> 00:26:04,200
We have nothing to eat.

339
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:09,119
God miraculously was providing this.

340
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:12,720
They were complaining and complaining and complaining.

341
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,959
Complaining is the result of discontent.

342
00:26:17,959 --> 00:26:20,880
We find that we must learn contentment.

343
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:26,440
Paul continues and says, I know both how to be abased and I know how to abound.

344
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:30,359
Everywhere and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to

345
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:33,640
abound and to suffer need.

346
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,679
God knows what we need, doesn't He?

347
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:39,959
And He's capable of providing for us.

348
00:26:39,959 --> 00:26:44,559
You remember that familiar Psalm, Psalm 23, the Lord is my shepherd.

349
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:45,600
What does He say?

350
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:50,119
I shall not want.

351
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:52,720
I shall not want.

352
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,959
The Lord is a good shepherd, amen?

353
00:26:55,959 --> 00:26:58,040
He provides for us.

354
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,040
And what a blessing.

355
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,160
We must learn contentment.

356
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:03,279
I would say this, we must seek the Lord Jesus Christ.

357
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:07,679
Notice in Colossians 3, we studied this portion of Scripture last year as we studied through

358
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:13,640
the book of Colossians, but these first few verses of Colossians 3 are so powerful.

359
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:19,320
When the Bible says this, if you then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above.

360
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:24,440
Where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God, set your affection on things above, not

361
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,799
on things of the earth.

362
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:31,320
And as I do this, as I understand that I'm in the world but I'm not of the world, when

363
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:37,119
I understand and I'm so consumed with the Lord Jesus Christ and I'm looking to Him,

364
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:42,559
I'm seeking those things which are above, I'm setting my affection on things above,

365
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:47,320
not on things of the earth, oh, the things of this world aren't going to matter as much.

366
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,320
Right?

367
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,399
The reproach of the enemy, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride

368
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:58,200
of life, it's not going to be as impactful because I've set my affection on things above.

369
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:02,799
I got my eyes on the Lord Jesus Christ.

370
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:05,959
I'd say this, that we must be clothed with humility.

371
00:28:05,959 --> 00:28:08,799
We must be clothed with humility.

372
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:15,019
Peter says in 1 Peter chapter 5, and we know that both James and Peter mention the truth

373
00:28:15,019 --> 00:28:18,540
of God resisting the proud but giving grace to the humble.

374
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:23,299
But I want you to notice what Peter says in 1 Peter chapter 5, in verse number 5, he says,

375
00:28:23,299 --> 00:28:27,179
likewise ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder, yea, all of you be subject one

376
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:28,260
to another.

377
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:34,140
Notice what he says, and be clothed with humility, for God resisteth the proud and giveth grace

378
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,419
to the humble.

379
00:28:35,419 --> 00:28:44,099
Humble yourselves therefore unto the mighty hand of God that He may exalt you in due time.

380
00:28:44,179 --> 00:28:49,020
The enemy wants us to get so focused upon this world and so consumed with the things

381
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:54,020
of this world that we're more concerned about our position and our possessions here and

382
00:28:54,020 --> 00:29:00,299
give less thought to what our eternal life is going to be.

383
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:05,580
I've mentioned before, and I understand there's a whole industry that's wrapped around it,

384
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:11,380
and I'm not suggesting that we should not have any emphasis or focus upon planning for

385
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:13,539
retirement and being mindful of those things.

386
00:29:13,539 --> 00:29:15,500
And I believe that there's wisdom in that.

387
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:20,419
But I find that in our society today that far too many have spent more time in doing

388
00:29:20,419 --> 00:29:26,260
retirement planning and estate planning than they ever give thought of eternity.

389
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:30,619
And let me say this, retirement is not guaranteed.

390
00:29:30,619 --> 00:29:31,619
Some of you are retired.

391
00:29:31,619 --> 00:29:33,500
You say, man, I've been retired.

392
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,299
John tells me all the time, retirement's great.

393
00:29:35,299 --> 00:29:39,099
It's like Saturday every day.

394
00:29:39,099 --> 00:29:43,979
But the reality is this, retirement's not guaranteed.

395
00:29:43,979 --> 00:29:50,179
You know people that never made it to retirement, correct?

396
00:29:50,179 --> 00:29:52,460
Eternity is guaranteed.

397
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,460
Eternity is guaranteed.

398
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:57,780
Again, I'm not suggesting that we not consider retirement planning and estate planning, but

399
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:59,260
I'm saying there ought to be a balance.

400
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:04,660
Let me say this, number six, we think about how to avoid these pitfalls.

401
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:08,580
I would say this, by the renewing of your mind.

402
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:12,340
Remember what he said as we read that portion of Scripture in Romans 12, in verse number

403
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:16,820
two, he says, be not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your

404
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:17,820
mind.

405
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:22,460
You think about what Paul said in Philippians chapter number four with regard to the thought

406
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,140
of God's people.

407
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:27,820
He says, finally, brethren, what sort of things are true, what sort of things are honest,

408
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:31,420
what sort of things are just, what sort of things are pure, what sort of things are lovely,

409
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:33,180
what sort of things are of good report?

410
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:37,820
If there be any virtue and if there be any praise, think on these things.

411
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:43,180
He tells us that we're to bring every thought into the captivity, unto the obedience of

412
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,180
Christ.

413
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:50,620
And oh, if we'd understand the battle for our mind, and when we have our mind and we

414
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:56,900
have our affection set on things above, as we find in Colossians chapter number three,

415
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:01,660
how that will enable us and help us to avoid the pitfalls.

416
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:07,500
We've mentioned the progression of worldliness and we understand the friendship of the world

417
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:11,260
and being spotted by the world and loving the world and then being conformed to this

418
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,260
world.

419
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:16,980
And so we don't want that as the people of God, we have been saved and Jesus said that

420
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:22,140
he left us in this world, but we're not of the world and we're to be his representatives.

421
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:26,980
And we understand that the enemy is constantly trying to allure us and pull us back because

422
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:32,660
he knows that in time past, prior to your salvation, prior to my salvation, every one

423
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:37,500
of us walked according to the course of this world.

424
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:41,540
And so we're familiar with this world system.

425
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:45,420
Those that were saved later in life are more familiar with this world system.

426
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:52,180
It's always tragic to me when those that were saved early in life feel like their testimony

427
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:59,220
is not as important or not as powerful because, oh, how God has delivered you from some really,

428
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:03,540
really terrible things.

429
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:08,460
And oh, how my heart breaks when young people feel like they need to go out and experience

430
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,460
the world.

431
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:14,160
Let me tell you this, the world is never going to satisfy you.

432
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:19,760
The world will always leave you wanting, always.

433
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,960
The world does not satisfy.

434
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:28,600
The lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life, it's never fulfilled.

435
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,280
It's never satisfied.

436
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:35,920
There's always something else and something more, and go further.

437
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:40,480
Jesus, on the other hand, he satisfies, amen?

438
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,400
He satisfies.

439
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,840
And I'm so thankful for that.

440
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,400
And so we see the progression.

441
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,120
We understand that there are some pitfalls to avoid.

442
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:54,480
And I hope this morning that we would take note of those, how we can avoid these things.

443
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,680
What are some things I can do in my life so that I can avoid these pitfalls because God's

444
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,360
warned me about them?

445
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:05,840
And the reality is that there's record of people in the Word of God that forsook because

446
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,160
they love this world.

447
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,760
I don't want to be there.

448
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,540
So how do I avoid it?

449
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:15,440
Number three this morning, finally, I'd say this.

450
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,440
As you continue through the passage, you come to verse number 17, I would say that there's

451
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,160
a promise to embrace.

452
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:26,520
It's really a twofold promise that is given to us here, and I hope that this twofold promise

453
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:29,720
that is given to us would cause us to be encouraged.

454
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,300
Notice what the Bible says.

455
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:38,220
It begins by telling us this, and the world passeth away and the lust thereof.

456
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:40,000
This world is going to pass away.

457
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,880
The world system, listen, there are times in which we look at and we understand when

458
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:49,320
the Bible tells us, why do the heathen rage, right?

459
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:54,200
And you look at Psalm 2 and you understand how the kings of the earth, they set themselves

460
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,680
against the Lord.

461
00:33:55,680 --> 00:34:00,520
And you look at all that's taking place and you understand this world system in which

462
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:05,160
we're living and we're operating, and you find that in this world system there are some

463
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:11,000
that would try to get us to think that this world system has some level of permanence.

464
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:20,600
But no, the world system, we have the promise of God Almighty that this world passeth away

465
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,279
and the lust thereof.

466
00:34:22,279 --> 00:34:27,119
I'd say this, this world system is just temporary.

467
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:30,240
It's just temporary.

468
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:35,119
I understand that at times it seems like there's some level of permanence to it, and you sort

469
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:39,400
of see some things that are taking place, and it could bother us, it could cause us

470
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,800
to have worry and concern.

471
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:47,839
But oh, how we must run to the Scriptures and how we must just comfort ourselves with

472
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:52,400
regard to the great promises that God has given us.

473
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,240
I said this several weeks ago.

474
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:58,320
I believe that it's worth repeating, there are many today that are looking at our society

475
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,640
and they're saying something like this, the world is falling apart.

476
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:09,400
And I understand when people use that terminology, but I'd say this, it's falling in place.

477
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:13,480
When we look at the prophecy that God has given us and we look at all that's taking

478
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:21,320
place in our world, we see things falling right in place, and God is King, amen?

479
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,320
He is King of kings and Lord of lords.

480
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,119
The Lord God omnipotent reigneth.

481
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:31,320
I was reading this morning in reading where the Bible was saying repetitively, the Lord

482
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:37,160
reigneth, and I'm so thankful that He's in control.

483
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:43,160
The promise for you, the promise for me, as we live in this world system, that we understand

484
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,880
this world is not my home.

485
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,119
This world system is just temporary.

486
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:49,559
It's going to pass away.

487
00:35:49,559 --> 00:35:55,160
And the lust thereof, notice what He says, and I want to focus on this for the last several

488
00:35:55,160 --> 00:36:03,400
minutes this morning, but He that doeth the will of God abideth forever.

489
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:08,040
He that doeth the will of God abideth forever.

490
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:12,760
As we think about this individual that is mentioned here, really individuals if you

491
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:17,600
could use it in the plural sense, the one that is going to do the will of God, the one

492
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:23,680
that is going to obey the voice of God, the one that is overcoming, the one that is knowing

493
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:29,040
the Father, the one that is seeking, has set their affection on things above, not on

494
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,040
things of the earth.

495
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:34,559
The one that we find in 2 Corinthians chapter number 4 while Paul says, while we look not

496
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:38,880
at these things which are temporal, these things that just pass away, but our focus

497
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,440
is on those things that are eternal.

498
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:46,920
And we have that eternal focus and we understand that we're doing the will of God and we're

499
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:49,080
seeking to please God.

500
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:54,880
We don't fit into this world system, because we're in the world, but we're not of the

501
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,880
world.

502
00:36:55,880 --> 00:37:01,920
And as we try to fit into the world system, then we become really sideways in our walk

503
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,400
with God.

504
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:10,880
We find here this morning that He says, He that doeth the will of God abideth forever.

505
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,320
Abideth forever.

506
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:21,960
I'm thankful as a child of God that the second death has no power over me and that I will

507
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,760
forever be with my Lord.

508
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,760
Isn't that precious?

509
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,700
He that doeth the will of God abideth forever.

510
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:34,080
We understand that as we look at this passage of Scripture that it's quite evident and quite

511
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:38,600
clear that loving the world is not the will of the Father.

512
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,600
Amen?

513
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,200
Isn't that abundantly clear?

514
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,559
He says in verse number 15, for if any man loved the world, the love of the Father's

515
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:45,980
not in him.

516
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:50,279
He says in verse number 16 that all of this, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes

517
00:37:50,279 --> 00:37:54,240
and the pride of life, it's not of the Father, but it's of the world.

518
00:37:54,240 --> 00:38:02,580
So obviously, loving the world, the world system, is not the will of God.

519
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:05,160
Walking in the light is the will of God.

520
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,520
Wouldn't you agree?

521
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,559
He says that we walk in the light as He is in the light.

522
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:14,760
That we're walking with Him, we're enjoying that fellowship with Him, we're abiding in

523
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:20,000
Him, we're loving our brethren, we're growing in grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior

524
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,360
Jesus Christ, we're being sanctified, set apart.

525
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,559
That is God's will.

526
00:38:25,559 --> 00:38:30,920
Remember at the end of Romans 12 in verse number 2, it says that we might prove what

527
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:36,280
is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.

528
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:39,000
But we have to be renewed by the transforming of our mind.

529
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,840
We're not to be conformed to this world.

530
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:45,840
I'm mindful this morning of what the songwriter said.

531
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:49,479
It's a song that we don't often sing.

532
00:38:49,479 --> 00:38:56,880
It's a song, however, that you will often hear played for invitation.

533
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:01,520
That song is, Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus.

534
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:05,720
And think about these words at the chorus of that song.

535
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:14,479
And the songwriter said, turn your eyes upon Jesus, look full in His wonderful face.

536
00:39:14,479 --> 00:39:25,040
And then it says this, and the things of earth will grow strangely dim in the light of His

537
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,200
glory and grace.

538
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:31,880
The songwriter hit the nail on the head, right?

539
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:38,119
I understand that songs aren't inspired Scripture, but the songwriter, by reading the inspired

540
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:44,520
Scripture and by meditating upon the truth of God's Word, got it right.

541
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:50,080
And the reality is that we must turn our eyes upon Jesus, get our eyes off of this old world

542
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:54,679
and the world system and the things of this world, and we get our eyes on Jesus, and we

543
00:39:54,679 --> 00:39:59,359
look not partially, not partly, but we look fully in His wonderful face.

544
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:09,379
face and we just get consumed with Jesus. It bothers me when people say that you

545
00:40:09,379 --> 00:40:14,779
could become too heavenly minded to be of any good earthly of any earthly

546
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:20,899
value. I just don't find that to be true because we're to be consumed with our

547
00:40:20,899 --> 00:40:25,579
Lord and the reality is that as we're walking with Him and we're abiding in

548
00:40:25,579 --> 00:40:30,079
Him and we're worshiping Him, then guess what? We're going to be doing His

549
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:34,559
will. He's going to be leading us directly into the paths that He wants us

550
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:39,719
into to be His representatives and to be His spokespeople and to bring honor and

551
00:40:39,719 --> 00:40:45,839
glory to His name. How is it that my Father is glorified and Johnny says that

552
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:51,439
you bear much fruit, right? That's how that's our Father's glorified. One way in

553
00:40:51,459 --> 00:40:56,499
which He's glorified. And so we find that we look a fool in His wonderful face is

554
00:40:56,499 --> 00:41:01,939
what the songwriter says and just get consumed with Jesus. He says the things

555
00:41:01,939 --> 00:41:08,019
of this world, oh there are many things of this world. I love how it says we'll

556
00:41:08,019 --> 00:41:13,459
grow strangely dim because so often it's the glitter and glamour of the world

557
00:41:13,459 --> 00:41:20,259
that catches our attention. That many have fallen prey to and have become

558
00:41:20,279 --> 00:41:25,199
casualties. But the songwriter said when I've turned my eyes upon Jesus and I'm

559
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:30,879
looking fully in His wonderful face, then the things of this world grow strangely

560
00:41:30,879 --> 00:41:40,239
dim in the light of what? His glory and grace. This morning, it's a stern warning,

561
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:46,239
love not the world. The reality is that it doesn't happen overnight. There's a

562
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:53,699
progression. Being a friend of the world, being spotted by the world, loving the

563
00:41:53,699 --> 00:41:59,979
world, being conformed to this world. We want to avoid, there are pitfalls to avoid.

564
00:41:59,979 --> 00:42:07,419
The lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, the pride of life. God will give us

565
00:42:07,419 --> 00:42:10,859
the ability to avoid those pitfalls. I'm thankful that He's told us what they are.

566
00:42:10,919 --> 00:42:17,079
As we take heed to the Scripture and we put on the whole armor of God and we set

567
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:20,079
our affection on things above, we're clothed with humility and all those

568
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:24,119
things that we mentioned, that we can avoid those pitfalls and we ought to

569
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:29,999
rejoice in that promise and embrace it. That the world passeth away in the lust

570
00:42:29,999 --> 00:42:36,359
thereof. But he that doeth the will of God abideth forever. Let us determine

571
00:42:36,539 --> 00:42:41,399
this morning and agree with what God said. I'm in the world but I'm not of the

572
00:42:41,399 --> 00:42:44,979
world. This world is not my home, the songwriter said, I'm just a passing

573
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:52,199
through. I'm a pilgrim and a stranger and I don't want to get sideways in

574
00:42:52,199 --> 00:42:56,819
my walk with God because of the things of this world. I want to have my full

575
00:42:56,819 --> 00:43:03,739
attention on the Lord. Love not the world. The enemy continues to use the same

576
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:09,979
thing today, the same playbook that he used in Genesis chapter number 3. The

577
00:43:09,979 --> 00:43:15,319
lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life. Oh, that God would

578
00:43:15,319 --> 00:43:20,899
help us so that we would overcome. Amen? Let's pray. Father, we love You. We thank

579
00:43:20,899 --> 00:43:25,819
You for loving us. Thank You for the Word of God. Stern warning this morning from

580
00:43:25,819 --> 00:43:30,199
this passage of Scripture, but how I rejoice in the warnings that You give us

581
00:43:30,199 --> 00:43:40,479
in Your Word. God, I pray that You'd help us to avoid these pitfalls, to be

582
00:43:40,479 --> 00:43:48,999
mindful of the fact that the enemy is seeking through one, really a combination

583
00:43:48,999 --> 00:43:53,119
of all three of these, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride

584
00:43:53,119 --> 00:44:00,099
of life to taint us, to cause us to be worldly, to come to that place where we

585
00:44:00,099 --> 00:44:05,599
love this world. God, I pray that You'd help us to set our affection on things

586
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:12,959
above. God, that You'd help us to do as the songwriter said and to turn our eyes

587
00:44:12,959 --> 00:44:20,599
upon Jesus. Help us to think more of the permanence of Him that doeth the will of

588
00:44:20,599 --> 00:44:27,239
God abideth forever than the passing away of this world's system, the temporary

589
00:44:27,239 --> 00:44:34,119
nature of this world in which we live. We do thank You for the opportunity to be

590
00:44:34,119 --> 00:44:43,119
Your representatives. I thank You that You've given us Your Word. And as we

591
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:48,119
understand that we're in this world but You've given us this precious book, the

592
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:56,159
Word of God, to arm us, to enable us to be victorious. Perhaps this morning there's

593
00:44:56,159 --> 00:45:01,559
someone that's struggling with worldliness. I pray that You would use Your Word, Your

594
00:45:01,559 --> 00:45:07,000
Spirit would work in their heart and life, they'd respond. Maybe this morning there's

595
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:18,039
some folks that need to just come and be encouraged, be reminded of that daily,

596
00:45:18,039 --> 00:45:25,279
weekly attack and recommit their focus to You, Lord. Maybe there's one that's not

597
00:45:25,279 --> 00:45:33,639
sure of heaven. Lord, today would You reveal to them their need for salvation. I trust

598
00:45:33,639 --> 00:45:36,719
that You've worked and moved and we pray that You'd have Your will and way in these

599
00:45:36,719 --> 00:45:40,919
few moments of invitation. We'll give You the honor and glory for all that You'll

600
00:45:40,919 --> 00:45:42,759
do. For it's in Christ's name we pray.
