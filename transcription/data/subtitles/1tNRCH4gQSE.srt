1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,320
Genesis, chapter number 25, and you'll remember last Sunday evening we looked at the first

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:13,439
section of this chapter, Genesis 25, and looked at the truth that Isaac and Ishmael buried

3
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:14,680
Abraham.

4
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:20,920
We read of the death of Abraham there in that portion of Scripture, and really I mentioned

5
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:26,639
at the closing of the message last week how that the focus, if you will, the lens of Scripture

6
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:33,040
is going to shift focus from being upon Abraham to being upon Isaac, and really eventually

7
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,720
obviously Jacob who becomes Israel, and that's the focus of Scripture.

8
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:44,000
But in our text this evening we'll be looking specifically at verses 19-26, but we find

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,360
that there is a parting word in verses 12-18 that is given to us with regard to Ishmael.

10
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:56,159
We understand that Abraham had died, he was buried, and we are briefly told in these verses

11
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:02,479
of Scripture of Ishmael's death, his descendants, and their dwelling place.

12
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:06,879
And I want you to note right at the beginning this evening that these chapters as we are

13
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:11,199
looking at the history that is given to us, of course the book of Genesis, the book of

14
00:01:11,199 --> 00:01:17,919
beginnings, genealogies that are provided, you'll find the phrase twice tonight, these

15
00:01:17,919 --> 00:01:25,080
are the generations of, this reference of this truth is given multiple times in the

16
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,360
book of Genesis.

17
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,839
And so it's important to understand that in this particular section of what we're dealing

18
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:35,879
with it is not in strict chronological order, and it's important for us to understand that

19
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:40,160
if we think that it's in strict chronological order all of a sudden the events don't really

20
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:44,879
line up and don't make sense to us and we can get confused quite quickly as we look

21
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:46,160
at these chapters.

22
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:52,360
And so we understand there at the beginning of chapter 25 as we look at the death of Abraham,

23
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:57,559
we mentioned this last week, that Abraham was 175 years old according to verse number

24
00:01:57,559 --> 00:02:03,599
7, when he died, and we understand that was 38 years after the death of Sarah, which would

25
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:09,919
have put Ishmael and Isaac at 89 and 75.

26
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:15,600
So Ishmael would have been 89 years old, Isaac would have been 75 years old when they buried

27
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,600
Abraham.

28
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:21,399
So it's interesting to note as well, and we'll look at some of this this evening, is that

29
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,360
Jacob and Esau would have been 15 years old.

30
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,039
Now there's no reference of Jacob and Esau even being born until what we're looking at

31
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:32,320
this evening in our text of Scripture, but when you line up the chronological order you

32
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:38,460
find that these boys, these grandsons of Abraham, would have been 15 years old at his burial,

33
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:42,520
and it's important that we understand that as we go through the portion of Scripture

34
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,800
it's not as if Abraham died and then Ishmael died and then all of a sudden we're reading

35
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,080
about Jacob and Esau being born to Isaac and Rebekah.

36
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:53,399
It's not strict chronological order.

37
00:02:53,399 --> 00:02:56,559
So at the onset this evening we want to make sure that that's clear.

38
00:02:56,559 --> 00:03:01,600
Again in verses 12 through 18 we read, we are receiving this parting word with regard

39
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,600
to Ishmael.

40
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:07,679
Notice the Bible says, now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the

41
00:03:07,679 --> 00:03:10,960
Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bear unto Abraham.

42
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:15,119
And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael by their names according to their generations.

43
00:03:15,119 --> 00:03:23,720
The firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth, and Kidar, and Adbil, and Mibsam, and Mishmah, and Dumah,

44
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:29,080
and Masah, Hadar, and Timah, Jator, Naphish, and Kedemah.

45
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:34,279
These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names by their towns and by their castles,

46
00:03:34,279 --> 00:03:37,660
twelve princes according to their nations.

47
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:42,940
And so we see here in these verses of Scripture that we are told of these twelve princes according

48
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:43,940
to their nations.

49
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:48,460
Now, hold your place here, but turn back to Genesis 17 if you will.

50
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:52,139
You might want to throw a bookmark in Genesis 17, we'll look back here in just a moment

51
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:55,020
as we get further into the message this evening.

52
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:59,979
But you'll remember that God had given that promise to Abraham with regard to a son being

53
00:03:59,979 --> 00:04:02,179
born, that son being Isaac.

54
00:04:02,179 --> 00:04:09,059
And in verse number 18 of Genesis 17, Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before

55
00:04:09,059 --> 00:04:10,059
thee.

56
00:04:10,059 --> 00:04:14,380
And God's response to Abraham in verse number 19 was, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a

57
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:19,059
son indeed, and thou shalt call his name Isaac, and I will establish my covenant with him

58
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:22,140
for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.

59
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:27,820
But notice what the Bible says in verse number 20, and as for Ishmael, I have heard thee.

60
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:34,299
Behold, I have blessed him, and I will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly.

61
00:04:34,299 --> 00:04:38,559
Twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.

62
00:04:38,559 --> 00:04:41,720
And we see the fulfillment of that right here in the passage that we're looking at

63
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:46,640
in Genesis chapter 25 when we read of the descendants of Ishmael.

64
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:51,640
These are their names, it says in verse number 16, by their towns, by their castles, twelve

65
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,980
princes according to their nations.

66
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:59,440
We then are told that Ishmael in verse number 17, and these are the years of the life of

67
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:05,359
Ishmael, and 137 years, and he gave up the ghost and died, and was gathered unto his

68
00:05:05,359 --> 00:05:06,359
people.

69
00:05:06,359 --> 00:05:13,480
So Ishmael dies at 137 years old, Abraham was 175 years old according to the previous

70
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:20,260
passage in which we've looked at, and we find therefore that Ishmael lived 48 years after

71
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:24,200
the death of his father Abraham.

72
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,920
We find that in verse number 18, the Bible tells us about the dwelling place of the descendants

73
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,160
of Ishmael.

74
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,959
It tells us that they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest

75
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:39,119
toward Assyria, and he died in the presence of all his brethren.

76
00:05:39,119 --> 00:05:43,359
And so really, again, the generations is provided to us.

77
00:05:43,359 --> 00:05:49,119
We see this parting word with regard to Ishmael, but again, the lens of Scripture is focused

78
00:05:49,119 --> 00:05:55,779
not on Ishmael because the promise that was given to Abraham that was, of course, fulfilled

79
00:05:55,779 --> 00:06:03,220
with the birth of Isaac, that was the Messianic line, and that is the focus of the Scripture.

80
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:08,339
We have often referred to that wonderful book that was written by Mr. Strogge many

81
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:13,899
years ago, The Unfolding Drama of Redemption, and considering the truth of God's Word in

82
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:22,619
tracing that Messianic line, and thus the focus of Scripture is transferred from Abraham

83
00:06:22,619 --> 00:06:23,619
now to Isaac.

84
00:06:23,619 --> 00:06:27,019
As we get into verse number 19, really we get into the message this evening, I want

85
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:31,179
to just draw your attention to verse number 23, and we'll get into the message.

86
00:06:31,179 --> 00:06:35,779
The Bible says this, and the Lord said unto her, speaking of Rebekah, two nations are

87
00:06:35,779 --> 00:06:40,100
in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels, and the one

88
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:45,940
people shall be stronger than the other people, and the elder shall serve the younger.

89
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,980
If you are taking notes this evening, you've probably noticed already on the back of the

90
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:54,500
bulletin that the title of the message tonight is The Elder Shall Serve the Younger.

91
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,779
The elder shall serve the younger.

92
00:06:56,779 --> 00:07:01,579
I want you to note the supplication, as we look at the text of Scripture, God helps us

93
00:07:01,579 --> 00:07:07,779
and gives us some insight here as to the life of Isaac and Rebekah.

94
00:07:07,779 --> 00:07:12,619
Remember it was at the end of chapter 24, it was in chapter 24 in its entirety, in which

95
00:07:12,619 --> 00:07:19,019
Abraham had given the responsibility to his servant to go find a wife for his son Isaac.

96
00:07:19,019 --> 00:07:25,019
And we find that God blessed and made prosperous his journey, the servant prayed specifically

97
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:30,700
and God answered specifically, and there was great rejoicing as we study Genesis 24.

98
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:38,140
And we read now in Genesis 25, in verse number 19, the Bible says, and these are the generations

99
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:41,019
of Isaac, Abraham's son.

100
00:07:41,019 --> 00:07:45,459
Abraham begat Isaac, and then notice verse number 20, and Isaac was 40 years old when

101
00:07:45,459 --> 00:07:52,660
he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel, the Syrian of Paddan Aram, the sister to Laban,

102
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:53,779
the Syrian.

103
00:07:53,779 --> 00:07:58,500
And so we find that the Scriptures give us a point of reference with regard to the age

104
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,739
of Isaac.

105
00:07:59,739 --> 00:08:06,420
Again, we understand that Isaac would have been 75 when he buried his father Abraham,

106
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:11,540
and so this event that we're looking at here tonight in this portion of Scripture happens

107
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:14,899
35 years before Abraham dies.

108
00:08:14,899 --> 00:08:20,660
And the Bible tells us that they're married, Isaac and Rebekah, and he's 40 years old.

109
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:24,779
And notice verse number 21, this is where we note the supplication.

110
00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:31,779
The Bible tells us here in verse number 21, and Isaac entreated the Lord for his wife.

111
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:36,340
The reason for his prayer, the reason for the supplication is revealed to us here in

112
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:41,820
verse number 21, because she was barren.

113
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:47,340
Now think about this and understand, no doubt Abraham had shared with Isaac the promises

114
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:50,140
that God had given him, right?

115
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:56,059
God had given Abraham promises, and we understand the truth with regard to the birth of Isaac

116
00:08:56,059 --> 00:08:58,700
and the many years in which they waited.

117
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:03,659
But in Genesis chapter 17, I asked you to keep your place there, in verse number 21,

118
00:09:03,659 --> 00:09:09,780
the Bible says, but my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall bear unto thee

119
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:12,380
at this set time in the next year.

120
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:17,020
And we think about the covenant that God is speaking of, and He says that the covenant

121
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:22,179
that He would, that is speaking to Abraham that He would establish with Isaac, remember

122
00:09:22,179 --> 00:09:28,440
it was with regard to a land and also a seed, correct?

123
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:34,580
We know that for Abraham that was Isaac, but what did God tell Abraham with regard to his

124
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,059
descendants?

125
00:09:36,059 --> 00:09:42,380
They would be as the number of the stars in the sky, of the sand on the shore, right?

126
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:48,940
And now here's Isaac, he's now married to Rebecca, the Bible tells us in verse number

127
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:54,979
20 that he was 40 years old, it tells us in verse number 21 that he entreated the Lord,

128
00:09:54,979 --> 00:09:58,219
he prayed, he sought the face of God, why?

129
00:09:58,219 --> 00:10:00,020
Because she, Rebecca, was barren.

130
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:08,340
I want you to understand that in verse number 26, the Bible tells us that Isaac was 60 years

131
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:11,260
old when these boys were born.

132
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:18,700
So that means that they were married for 19 years before Rebekah conceived.

133
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:24,220
Now again, having the promise that God had given Abraham, and no doubt Abraham would

134
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:29,380
have shared with Isaac, there would have been every expectation that they would have children,

135
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,580
correct?

136
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:34,780
And the Bible tells us that Rebekah, however, is barren.

137
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:39,820
And so therefore we find that Isaac is going to seek the face of God.

138
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:46,460
And you think about these 19 years of marriage and of no children and understanding the promise

139
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:50,540
that had been given, and no doubt it was a stressful time.

140
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:56,220
And we find that he's praying, and the Bible tells us at the end of verse number 21,

141
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:02,140
And the Lord was entreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.

142
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:04,860
Isn't that a blessing?

143
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:10,300
Once again, and obviously as you read the Word of God, we are regularly confronted with

144
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:18,100
the truth and reminded of the precious reality of the believer's life, that we have a God

145
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,060
who answers prayer.

146
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:25,140
We have a God who hears and answers prayer.

147
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:30,820
It may not be in our time, it may not be according to that timeline that we've set up in our

148
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:36,900
timetable and our mind and so on and so forth, but we find that here the Bible tells us that

149
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:42,700
Isaac sought the face of God and he prayed for his wife specifically, why?

150
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,380
Because she was barren.

151
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,700
So what's he praying?

152
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:50,060
That she would bear fruit, that she would conceive.

153
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:56,260
No doubt, as you look at the passage of Scripture, that's the specific nature of the prayer,

154
00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:03,220
and what a joy to understand that the Bible tells us that Rebekah his wife conceived.

155
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:09,100
As we look at the natural implications of this truth this evening, we find that even

156
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:13,800
there would be spiritual application for us because we understand as believers that we

157
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,700
too are to bear fruit, right?

158
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:20,080
And we are to bear fruit, and there are times, no doubt, we understand that we're not the

159
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,720
ones that give the increase.

160
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:28,160
The truth that Paul reveals to the believers in Corinth is some plant and some water, but

161
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,120
God gives the increase.

162
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:34,340
But we find that in John chapter number 15, we often reference the beginning of that portion

163
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,340
of Scripture.

164
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:40,160
If you want to take a moment to turn there, in John chapter number 15, I mentioned it

165
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:46,640
actually this morning, how that we are the branches, but he is the vine, and the importance

166
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:51,240
of bearing fruit, and we see it here in this portion of Scripture.

167
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:56,520
In fact, it is encouraging to me as we think about the truth this evening, even that we

168
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:02,840
see here in the passage of Scripture with Isaac and Rebekah, that Isaac sought the Lord.

169
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:09,200
He prayed, and God was entreated, and God blessed, and we find that Rebekah conceived.

170
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:14,920
And this evening, we think about our responsibility to produce, or to bear, I should say, spiritual

171
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:19,840
fruit, then we need to pray and ask God to use us to that end.

172
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,200
We need to pray that God would give us the opportunities.

173
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,600
He would give us the boldness.

174
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,560
Notice here in John 15, I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.

175
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:31,960
Every branch in me that beareth not fruit, he taketh away.

176
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:36,480
And every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.

177
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,120
Just at the very beginning of this passage of Scripture, do you not see that it is God's

178
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,560
will and God's plan that we produce fruit?

179
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,560
Right?

180
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,240
I mean, that's the plan of God.

181
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:49,200
So we see in verse number three, now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken

182
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,200
unto you.

183
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:55,480
Abide in me, and I in you, as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself.

184
00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:01,920
We understand that as we look at the natural world, and spiritually the truth is being

185
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,960
provided to us as well.

186
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,600
It says, except it abide in the vine.

187
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,320
No more can ye, except ye abide in me.

188
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,040
I am the vine, ye are the branches.

189
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:16,000
He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit.

190
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,080
For without me ye can do nothing.

191
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,840
If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered.

192
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:26,920
And men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.

193
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:33,120
If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be

194
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,320
done unto you.

195
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:38,240
Well, that's a precious truth, is it not?

196
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,280
Specifically, contextually, what's he talking about?

197
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,840
Bearing fruit.

198
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,840
Correct?

199
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:49,680
Now, do you think that that's a prayer that God is delighted in answering?

200
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,240
God help me as I seek to be your witness, your ambassador.

201
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,600
You have planned it so that we would be fruit bearers.

202
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,960
God used me to that end.

203
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,320
God is delighted in that.

204
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:11,440
Notice the truth of verse number eight, herein is my Father glorified that ye bear much fruit.

205
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,480
So shall ye be my disciples.

206
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:22,280
Perhaps this evening, even at the beginning of this message, we look at what's taking

207
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:28,000
place here in John 15, and look at some spiritual application from the truth in Genesis 25,

208
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,760
and we say, God, we want you to be glorified, and we understand from John 15 in verse number

209
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:36,000
eight, herein is my Father glorified that you bear much fruit.

210
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:44,360
God help me, use me, help me to abide in you so that fruit can be produced.

211
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,360
Amen?

212
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,000
God wants to use us.

213
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
God wants to use you.

214
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,520
You say, I can't do it.

215
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,760
That's right, because you're the branch.

216
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,760
Amen?

217
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:57,400
And the branch, it can't produce fruit on its own.

218
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:02,920
But if you abide, if the branch is connected to the vine, and He is the true vine, then

219
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,400
all of a sudden, fruit can be produced.

220
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,880
And we are to be bearing fruit.

221
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:13,920
Back in Genesis chapter 25, we note the supplication in verses 19 through 21.

222
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:19,320
I want you to note the struggle in verses 22 through 26.

223
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:24,480
The Bible tells us this, and the children struggled together within her.

224
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,080
Now, of course, Rebecca had not been with child prior to this.

225
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,920
We find the Bible tells us, as we mentioned a moment ago, that she was barren, but now

226
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,400
she's conceived.

227
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:38,360
And it would seem as if, as you look at verse number 22, that the struggle was so intense,

228
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:43,680
the struggle was so unusual, that it resulted in her seeking the face of God to figure out

229
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,800
what in the world is going on.

230
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:53,180
And we find the Bible tells us here that there was this struggle within her, and she said,

231
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:57,660
if it be so, why am I thus?

232
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,220
Why this struggle?

233
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,980
Why of all of this that's going on?

234
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:07,300
And the Bible tells us that she went to inquire of the Lord.

235
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:12,020
Once again, we see the supplication, we see the prayer, we see the seeking the face of

236
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,020
God.

237
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:17,300
We noted it in verse number 21 with regard to the fact that Rebecca was barren, and Isaac

238
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:22,980
sought the Lord on her behalf with regard to that need, and now Rebecca herself, because

239
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:27,900
of the struggle that is taking place, she now seeks the face of God.

240
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:33,500
This struggle was intense, and thus she seeks God, and she wants to know why.

241
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,680
If it be so, why am I thus?

242
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,340
She didn't have an answer.

243
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,940
Isaac certainly didn't have an answer, amen?

244
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:47,660
And if you, any of you men, have wives that have had children, and we don't have answers

245
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:50,540
for why they feel the way that they feel, amen?

246
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:56,700
And the reality is that God, however, has an answer for Rebecca.

247
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:03,980
And she seeks the face of God, again, with just great joy, we are reminded of the fact

248
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:06,340
that our God hears and answers prayer.

249
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:13,660
Because she seeks God, she went to inquire of the Lord, notice verse 23, and the Lord

250
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,660
said unto her.

251
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,100
Aren't you thankful that God answers prayer?

252
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:21,860
I mean, honestly, we can just read through a passage like this, and just really, just

253
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:26,260
kind of mind not really connected, and just, yep, God answered her, so on and so forth,

254
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:29,500
but God hears us, and He answers us.

255
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,980
And here, Rebecca, she didn't know why she was dealing with what she was dealing with,

256
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:39,660
she didn't know why in her womb that these two children that were in her womb, why the

257
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,260
struggle was so intense, she could not understand it.

258
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:48,660
And perhaps, as we look at the passage, we know that she'd never been with child before,

259
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:53,700
but you have to acknowledge that at this point, she would have had people that she knew that

260
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:58,460
were with child, and experiences that were spoken of, and this was so unusual, and she

261
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:01,820
seeks God, and God answers.

262
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:08,380
And God says, here's why, two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall

263
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,820
be separated from thy bowels.

264
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:16,260
And the one people shall be stronger than the other people, and the elder shall serve

265
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,080
the younger.

266
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,580
That answer is huge.

267
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:28,660
I mean, the far-reaching aspect of this answer, the prophetic implications of the answer that

268
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:34,980
God gives to Rebecca in verse number 23 of Genesis 25 is phenomenal.

269
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:38,020
And we find that God gives her an answer, why?

270
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,880
Because she asks.

271
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,600
She inquired of the Lord.

272
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:46,360
And there are times, no doubt, remember, I preached this message several months ago,

273
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:53,080
I think it was in August, I preached the message there in 1 Samuel, with Samuel, where he says,

274
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,720
speak Lord, for thy servant heareth.

275
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:00,040
There are times when God wants to speak to us, but we're not listening.

276
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,420
We're not seeking His face.

277
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:02,800
We're not asking Him,

278
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,800
why, God, are these things going on?

279
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,700
Give me wisdom. Give me answers.

280
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,020
Help me to understand.

281
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:10,060
But we find here that Rebekah,

282
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,240
she sought the Lord.

283
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,080
She inquired of the Lord.

284
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,320
And God answered her.

285
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,740
We find that here in this passage of Scripture,

286
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:23,480
God reminds us again that He knows all things

287
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,760
and that He reveals those things.

288
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,240
And we find that in v. 24,

289
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,160
the Bible says,

290
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,400
"'And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled,

291
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:35,520
behold, there were twins in her womb.

292
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,300
And the first came out red,

293
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,740
all over like an hairy garment,

294
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,440
and they called His name Esau."

295
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,960
Isn't that an interesting way to describe your newborn baby?

296
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,440
You understand, Esau means red.

297
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,400
The name Edom means red.

298
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:55,520
And we find that it says He was like a hairy garment.

299
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,560
And some commentators said that He resembled

300
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,640
more of an animal than He did a baby.

301
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,720
And I thought that was kind of comical.

302
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,560
But the reality is that the description

303
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,640
is provided for us here in v. 25

304
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,680
with regard to note, the Bible says,

305
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,440
and the first.

306
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,400
Now, we have never had twins,

307
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,120
but we understand and we know people that have had twins.

308
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,320
And there is an older and a younger, right?

309
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,040
There's a firstborn and a secondborn,

310
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,400
and that's just the way it works.

311
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,760
And we find that oftentimes with twins,

312
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,820
there's a level of competition amongst them

313
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:32,560
as to I'm five minutes older or whatever the situation is.

314
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,520
In fact, we knew some people up in Pennsylvania

315
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,040
that had twins and they were actually born

316
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:39,720
on two different days because of the time, of course.

317
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,680
And so they had birthdays on two different days,

318
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,760
but they were twins.

319
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,560
Only separated by about seven minutes,

320
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,720
but it was on two different days.

321
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,520
And so we find here, notice it says, and the first,

322
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,240
and that first being Esau.

323
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,880
But remember the truth at the end of v. 23,

324
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:58,180
the elder shall serve the younger.

325
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,280
And so who's the elder?

326
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,120
Well, the first is the elder,

327
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,280
and that's Esau according to v. 25.

328
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:09,240
Notice in v. 26, and after that came his brother out.

329
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,920
And so he'd be the younger, correct?

330
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:14,600
After, and it says, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel

331
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,600
and his name was called Jacob

332
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:20,420
and Isaac was three score years old when she bared him.

333
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:23,340
And so we see that in v. 20, he's 40.

334
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,780
In v. 26, he's 60.

335
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,740
And so in just a few verses of scripture,

336
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:31,060
we cover 20 years of the life of Isaac.

337
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:33,700
And we find that in this period of time,

338
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,420
as we note what's going on,

339
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:40,140
we see the fact that Rebekah conceives.

340
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:43,540
We find the fact that she then delivers the children

341
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:46,540
after she'd inquired of the Lord and received word

342
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:50,500
with regard to why the struggle was so intense.

343
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,740
So we see the supplication, we see the struggle,

344
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,740
but I want you to note this evening

345
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,700
and really deal with some application tonight.

346
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,380
I want you to note the symbolism.

347
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:01,580
There's some great symbolism for us here

348
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,380
in this portion of scripture.

349
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,740
And we ask the question,

350
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:07,540
even as we looked at that last point of v. 22

351
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,660
and the children struggled,

352
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,780
why the struggle in the womb?

353
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:13,980
Well, first of all, it was because of their two nations.

354
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,900
And we see the two nations that are mentioned

355
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:18,980
in v. 23, two nations are in thy womb.

356
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,860
And this is the contextual truth

357
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,340
of this passage of scripture.

358
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:24,380
When you interpret the scripture,

359
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:28,140
you find that these two nations that were within the womb,

360
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:31,260
Jacob, whose name would be turned to Israel,

361
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:34,860
and we find Esau, who often is referred to as Edom.

362
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,380
And we see those two nations

363
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:39,620
being the Israelites and the Edomites.

364
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,500
And often as you read your Bible,

365
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,300
as you read through the Old Testament,

366
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:47,260
you will come across and you will read

367
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:50,740
of the descendants of Esau, the Edomites.

368
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:54,300
And you will find on regular occurrence,

369
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:59,300
the controversy between the Edomites and the Israelites.

370
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:04,660
But we find that that was told to Rebekah

371
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,060
in this portion of scripture.

372
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:08,580
It should be no surprise to us as we read the scriptures

373
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,540
and we understand what's taking place

374
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:12,940
where we find here that God said

375
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:15,980
that two nations are in thy womb

376
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:19,380
and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels.

377
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:22,020
And the one people shall be stronger than the other people

378
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:25,420
and the elder shall serve the younger.

379
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:28,540
In fact, the Old Testament minor prophet,

380
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:31,740
the book of Obadiah is specifically written.

381
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,700
It's only one chapter,

382
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:36,900
but it's specifically written about Edom and the Edomites.

383
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,580
Take just a moment and turn to the book of Obadiah,

384
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:40,460
if you will.

385
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:44,300
Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, and then Jonah.

386
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:47,020
And help you out there just a moment

387
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:49,500
so you can find it and see where it is.

388
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:53,780
In Obadiah, notice, we won't dig real deep into this,

389
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:57,340
but notice what the Bible says in verse number one.

390
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:00,500
The vision of Obadiah, you there, you found Obadiah?

391
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,100
Amen, I'll give you another second.

392
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,180
One preacher always says it's after Genesis

393
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,220
and before Revelation, isn't that helpful?

394
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,940
And somewhere in the middle.

395
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:10,900
And Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah,

396
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,940
if you get to Jonah, just turn back a page or two

397
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,060
and you'll be there.

398
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:17,340
Obadiah chapter one, there's only one chapter in the book.

399
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,820
Notice it says in verse number one,

400
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,820
the vision of Obadiah,

401
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:25,540
thus saith the Lord God concerning Edom, right?

402
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,060
Is that what your Bible says?

403
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:30,660
This is Esau, Edom, the Edomites.

404
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,140
We have heard a rumor from the Lord

405
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:33,820
and the ambassador is sent among the heathen.

406
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:36,620
Arise ye and let us rise up against her in battle

407
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:39,020
and we'll skip a few verses

408
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:41,540
and I want you to notice in verse number 10

409
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,580
and we'll just kind of move on from here.

410
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,980
In verse number 10, it says this.

411
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:50,420
For thy violence against thy brother Jacob,

412
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:55,420
shame shall cover thee and thou shalt be cut off forever.

413
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:59,100
That's a pretty serious indictment against them.

414
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:02,260
And really, if you look back and you begin to study

415
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,900
and you look specifically in Numbers chapter 20,

416
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,580
there's a specific incident that is there

417
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:09,500
that provides you with some insight

418
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:14,140
into how that the Edomites really rejoiced

419
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:18,980
at the difficulties and the trials of the Israelites.

420
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:21,300
And we find that God deals with that.

421
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,780
In verse number 11, it says this.

422
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:26,500
In the day that thou stoodest on the other side,

423
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,180
in the day that the strangers carried away captive

424
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:32,260
his forces and foreigners entered into his gates

425
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,420
and cast lots upon Jerusalem,

426
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:37,180
even thou wast as one of them.

427
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,220
But thou shouldest not have looked on the day

428
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:42,260
of thy brother in the day that he became a stranger,

429
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:44,380
neither shouldest thou have rejoiced

430
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:47,580
over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction,

431
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,980
neither shouldest thou have spoken proudly

432
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,700
in the day of distress.

433
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:56,060
And so we find that many of those things

434
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:58,380
going back to the book of Numbers

435
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,020
and in various portions of scripture

436
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:03,020
and seeing this hostility really is a good way

437
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:06,580
to describe it between the Edomites and the Israelites.

438
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:08,340
And we see it historically.

439
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,660
And it is given to us prophetically

440
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,820
here in Genesis chapter 25,

441
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:14,940
when the inquiry is made of Rebecca,

442
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:18,060
she has this struggle and she says,

443
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:20,500
why is it thus?

444
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,460
And God says, well, the symbolism

445
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:25,900
is that there are two nations within thy womb,

446
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:28,380
the nation of Israel and the nation of Edom,

447
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,420
the Edomites and the Israelites.

448
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:33,380
I want you to notice in Romans chapter number nine

449
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:35,700
and look at this passage of scripture

450
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,900
and we'll finish here with this aspect of the symbolism

451
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,300
and then make some application.

452
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,500
Remember the Bible says that the older

453
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,900
shall serve the younger,

454
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:48,220
the older being Esau shall serve the younger being Jacob.

455
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:52,420
And Jacob of course would be Israel

456
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:55,020
and of course the Messianic line and so on and so forth.

457
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,460
In Romans chapter number nine in verses 10 through 13,

458
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:58,900
by the way, let me say this,

459
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:03,100
many people get all sorts of afraid and sideways

460
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,580
reading Romans chapter number nine

461
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:06,900
and they fret over Calvinism.

462
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:10,740
And the reality is that Calvinism is very popular.

463
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:13,980
It's actually gaining a great amount of popularity

464
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:16,020
in many of our churches today.

465
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,900
And I believe with all of my heart

466
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:22,140
that the teaching of Calvinism is not biblical.

467
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:25,860
And I believe that we do not have to align our theology

468
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:29,500
with some person if that person,

469
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,940
really it's systematic theology,

470
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:34,060
is a development of Calvin

471
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,140
and he developed this kind of thought

472
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:38,100
of these points of Calvinism.

473
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,860
But if his points don't align with God's word,

474
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,100
what do we stick to?

475
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,620
The word of God, amen.

476
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:48,100
And so people shy away from this passage of scripture

477
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,940
because they don't know how to deal with it.

478
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:54,340
The reality is that God did not predestine people

479
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,380
to go to hell.

480
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:57,660
He didn't do that.

481
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:01,500
The Bible teaches us whosoever will may come, right?

482
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,180
Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord

483
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,980
shall be saved.

484
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:07,340
God is not willing that any should perish,

485
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,900
but that all should come to repentance.

486
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,900
God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son.

487
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:14,780
How do you get around those verses of scripture?

488
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:17,380
If you say that God just foreordained certain people

489
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,540
to go to hell, he didn't.

490
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,660
And here in Romans chapter nine,

491
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,500
people want to run to this passage of scripture

492
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:27,580
and say, see, God chose Jacob and he hated Esau.

493
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:31,860
And God, it has nothing to do with salvation.

494
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:33,700
Zero.

495
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,300
Nothing.

496
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,220
Romans nine, look at verse number 10.

497
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:41,060
And not only this, but when Rebecca also had conceived

498
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:43,340
by one, even by our father Isaac,

499
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:45,340
for the children being not yet born,

500
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:47,780
neither having done any good or evil,

501
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:50,180
that the purpose of God, according to election,

502
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:52,460
might stand not of works, but of him that calleth.

503
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:55,340
Now everyone gets afraid of that word election.

504
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:56,420
It's a Bible word.

505
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,980
We don't have to get worried about somebody

506
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,460
using it the wrong way.

507
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:00,920
In verse number 12, it says,

508
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,120
"'And it was said unto her,

509
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,720
The elder shall serve the younger,

510
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,720
as it is written,

511
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,420
Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.'"

512
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,420
And we see in this passage of Scripture

513
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,920
that what God is dealing with

514
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,920
is not selecting one for heaven

515
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,920
and one for hell,

516
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,920
one for redemption

517
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,420
and one for damnation.

518
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:20,920
He's choosing a nation.

519
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,920
Amen?

520
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,420
The nation of Israel.

521
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:25,420
The Messianic line.

522
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,920
His purpose is being fulfilled.

523
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,920
And we find that to be the case.

524
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,420
If you want to understand,

525
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:33,420
Ephesians 1 is another passage of Scripture.

526
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,420
We won't take the time this evening,

527
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,420
but let me just reference it for you.

528
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,920
Ephesians 1 is another one of those passages of Scripture

529
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,920
that so many people today are shying away from

530
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,920
because of the word chosen

531
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,420
and because of predestined

532
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:48,420
being in the passage of Scripture.

533
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:50,920
Listen, God in Ephesians 1,

534
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,920
let me just say this and we'll move on.

535
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,420
In Ephesians 1,

536
00:30:54,420 --> 00:31:00,420
God is not speaking about the who of salvation.

537
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:05,420
God, however, is speaking about the how of salvation.

538
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,920
Let me put it this way.

539
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:11,920
God predetermined before the foundation of the world

540
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,920
not who will be saved,

541
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:18,420
but how anybody will be saved.

542
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:20,420
Does that make sense?

543
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,420
So what He said,

544
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:23,920
before the foundation of the world,

545
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,920
He didn't say, nope, you're out.

546
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,920
Yep, you guys, you're good.

547
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,420
Yeah, I think you're good.

548
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,920
He didn't do that, okay?

549
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,920
That's not how God operated.

550
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,420
But what God did before the foundation of the world

551
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:37,420
is He said salvation is going to be

552
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:39,420
through one Person.

553
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:41,920
That's Jesus Christ, God in flesh.

554
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,920
There's no other name under heaven

555
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,920
given among men whereby we must be saved.

556
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,920
Right?

557
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,920
So therefore, that's Acts 4 and verse 12.

558
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:53,420
Therefore, God, before the foundation of the world,

559
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:56,920
determined the how of salvation.

560
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,920
The only way to be saved

561
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:03,420
is to be born again through the blood of Jesus Christ,

562
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:06,420
accepting His sacrifice on the cross of Calvary

563
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,420
for your payment.

564
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,920
You can't work your way to heaven.

565
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,920
There's no other way to get to heaven.

566
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,920
There's no other name.

567
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,920
There's no other process.

568
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,920
It's only through this one process.

569
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,920
It's exclusive, right?

570
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,420
That's the how of salvation.

571
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:25,420
But then, it's whosoever will may come.

572
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:29,420
As long as you come this predetermined way.

573
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:31,420
Does that make sense?

574
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,920
Remember back in Genesis

575
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,420
when we were beginning our study

576
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,420
through the book of Genesis,

577
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:40,920
and we got into Adam and Eve and all of that,

578
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,420
and we kind of went forward

579
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,920
and dealt with the truth

580
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,920
that Adam no doubt would have taught

581
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,420
Cain and Abel about sacrifice and so on and so forth.

582
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:51,420
Remember Cain and Abel both brought a sacrifice.

583
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:54,920
They were very different one from the other, correct?

584
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:58,920
One was accepted and one was rejected.

585
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,920
But I want you to understand

586
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:03,420
that when Cain's offering was rejected,

587
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:05,420
God said to Cain,

588
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:08,420
if thou doest well,

589
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:11,420
shalt thou not be accepted.

590
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:13,420
You know what God's saying to Cain?

591
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:16,420
You didn't come the right way.

592
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:19,920
If you come with an offering of blood,

593
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,920
you'll be accepted.

594
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,420
But you came the wrong way,

595
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:26,420
and therefore, you're rejected.

596
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:30,420
It's not that God chose Abel and rejected Cain.

597
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:32,920
It's not that God was choosing that

598
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,920
for salvation for those individuals.

599
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:38,420
No, rather, it's that he, Cain,

600
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:41,920
chose that he was going to do it his own way.

601
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,420
And if you choose that you're going to do it your own way,

602
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:45,920
and you say, I don't really care what God's Word says.

603
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,420
I don't care what the Bible says.

604
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:49,920
I'm going to just be a good person.

605
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,920
I'm going to do this, that, and the other.

606
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,920
And I'm going to get to heaven my own way.

607
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,920
It's not going to happen.

608
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,920
By the authority of God's Word, it's not going to happen.

609
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,920
And so here in Genesis chapter 25,

610
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,920
when you think about the symbolism,

611
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:06,420
and you think about the truth of Romans 9, verses 10 through 13,

612
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:07,920
nothing to do with salvation,

613
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,920
everything to do with choosing a nation

614
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,920
and dealing with the Messianic line.

615
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,920
Now think about the next aspect of the symbolism

616
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,920
that is given to us here in Genesis 25.

617
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:23,920
Not only two nations, but really two natures.

618
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,920
Notice what the Bible says back in Genesis 25,

619
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,920
in verse number 23.

620
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,920
And the Lord said unto her,

621
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,920
Two nations are in thy womb,

622
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,920
and two manner of people

623
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,920
shall be separated from thy bowels.

624
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,920
And the one people shall be stronger than the other people,

625
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:43,920
and the elder shall serve the younger.

626
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,920
So we see the two nations.

627
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,920
We see the contextual truth,

628
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,920
the interpretation with regard to the two nations.

629
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,920
But when we begin to look at application,

630
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,920
and we look at these two natures,

631
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,920
we can look at the two natures as being

632
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,920
the old man and the new man.

633
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,920
The old man and the new man.

634
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:05,920
The old man would be the older, correct?

635
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:10,920
The new man would be the younger, correct?

636
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:14,920
Because you have, if we've used this terminology before,

637
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,920
to be born once is to die twice,

638
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,920
but to be born twice is to die once.

639
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,920
When we say that, we're looking at what Jesus said to Nicodemus,

640
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,920
ye must be born again.

641
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,920
And we use that terminology, and we say,

642
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,920
you must be born again.

643
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,920
What does it mean to be born again?

644
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,920
It doesn't mean to be baptized.

645
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,920
It doesn't mean to say your first holy communion

646
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,920
or whatever anyone wants to say.

647
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,920
Being born again is placing your faith and trust

648
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,920
in Jesus Christ alone for your salvation.

649
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,920
And at that very moment,

650
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,920
the Bible tells us that we're quickened.

651
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:47,920
We're made alive.

652
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,920
We're born again.

653
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,920
And so we understand.

654
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:53,920
I have, therefore, if you've been born again,

655
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,920
as I've been born again, I have two birthdays.

656
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,920
I have a physical birthday, and I have a spiritual birthday.

657
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,920
And I look at those two birthdays

658
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,920
that I would acknowledge in a calendar year,

659
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,920
and they're separated by 17 years.

660
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:12,920
So the elder is my old man,

661
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,920
and the younger is the new man.

662
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,920
And that's the same for you as well.

663
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:22,920
Regardless of what that separation of time is,

664
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,920
whether you were born again when you were 30,

665
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,920
or 5, or 4, or whatever the age is,

666
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,920
there's the elder and there's the younger.

667
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,920
There's the old man and the new man.

668
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,920
And we find that here when we think about

669
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,920
this symbolism of these two natures,

670
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,920
the application for us from this passage of Scripture this evening,

671
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,920
we find that he says that two manner of people.

672
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,920
Isn't it amazing how different our old man is from our new man?

673
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,920
The desires of the old man versus the desires of the new man.

674
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,920
What about the struggle between the old man and the new man?

675
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,920
The Bible tells us in Galatians 5

676
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:02,920
that the Spirit and the flesh are at enmity one with the other.

677
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,920
Have you experienced it?

678
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:09,920
Do you understand the symbolism that we see here

679
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,920
in this passage of Scripture?

680
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,920
And so when we talk about the two natures

681
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,920
and we talk about the application,

682
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,920
we see no doubt the two nations

683
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,920
and the interpretation here,

684
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,920
and we see historically the struggle

685
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,920
between the Israelites and the Edomites,

686
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,920
and we can read of the judgments in the book of Obadiah,

687
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,920
and Hosea deals with it as well,

688
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,920
and you can read of those things and you can understand.

689
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,920
But when we make application for this symbolism

690
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,920
with regard to the two natures,

691
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,920
and we say the older shall serve the younger,

692
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,920
the old man shall serve the new man,

693
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,920
how is that even possible?

694
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,920
Through the Lord Jesus Christ.

695
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,920
There's no other way.

696
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,920
It's only through Jesus.

697
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,920
And I want you to look at Romans 6,

698
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,920
and we're going to look at several verses here,

699
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,920
and I hope this will be a blessing to you this evening

700
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,920
as we consider the symbolism that is provided.

701
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,920
We see the historical context.

702
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,920
We understand what's taking place with these two nations,

703
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,920
and we see the struggle that took place

704
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,920
after the conception

705
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,920
that was a result of the supplication.

706
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,920
But here, when we look at this symbolism

707
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,920
and we think about the two natures,

708
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,920
the reality is that the struggle that we have

709
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,920
between our old man and our new man

710
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:27,920
is a direct result of the birth.

711
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,920
The second birth.

712
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,920
You didn't have any struggle before you got saved.

713
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,920
There was no Holy Spirit of God that lived within you

714
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,920
that was convicting you.

715
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,920
There may have been some morals that you had

716
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,920
and a moral compass and so on and so forth,

717
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,920
but you think about the way in which that struggle

718
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,920
became real after salvation.

719
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,920
And all of a sudden, you went to do something

720
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,920
that you used to do and enjoy.

721
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,920
You say, man, I don't have any pleasure in this anymore.

722
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,920
And the struggle becomes real.

723
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,920
Romans 6 and verse 6, it says this,

724
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,920
knowing this,

725
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,920
that our old man is crucified with Him,

726
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,920
that the body of sin might be destroyed,

727
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:16,920
that henceforth we should not serve sin.

728
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,920
For he that is dead is freed from sin.

729
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,920
Now if we be dead with Christ,

730
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,920
we believe that we shall also live with Him,

731
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,920
knowing that Christ, being raised from the dead,

732
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:30,920
dieth no more, death hath no more dominion over Him.

733
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,920
For in that he died, he died unto sin once,

734
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:35,920
but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.

735
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,920
Likewise, in like manner,

736
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:44,920
reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin,

737
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,920
but alive unto God.

738
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,920
How? Through Jesus Christ our Lord.

739
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,920
Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body,

740
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,920
that you should obey it and the lusts thereof.

741
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:59,920
Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness.

742
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:04,940
righteousness unto sin, but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are

743
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:08,780
alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God.

744
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:15,260
For sin shall not have dominion over you, for you're not under the law, but under

745
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:21,400
grace." Man, that's precious. And we understand this controversy, this

746
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:26,060
struggle, again, the symbolism of the struggle. Yes, there's two nations within

747
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:30,020
thy womb, but there's two manner of people, and you think about the spiritual

748
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:34,180
application this evening, and we think about that old man and that new man, and

749
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:39,100
we see that the older shall serve the younger, not through any willpower that

750
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:45,300
we have, but through living for Christ and allowing Him, yielding to Him, and

751
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:51,740
allowing Him to give us the victory. We find that here, Paul says it this way in

752
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:57,740
Galatians 2, in verse number 20. It's a very familiar verse of Scripture. Often,

753
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:03,420
as we think about the truth in Paul's life and understanding so many of the

754
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:09,300
things that Paul was able to see God use him in great ways, it really

755
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:14,780
oftentimes, in my mind, I go back to the truth of Galatians 2.20 to see why God

756
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:19,020
was able to use Paul in the way that he was. Because Paul said, remember this

757
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:22,700
morning, Acts 20 and 24, none of these things move me, neither count I my life

758
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:29,260
dear unto myself. Why? Galatians 2.20, I am crucified with Christ. Nevertheless, I

759
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:33,500
live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me, and the life which I now live in the

760
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:41,860
flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave Himself for me.

761
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:48,340
We think about these two natures, and we think about the importance of crucifying

762
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:55,540
that old man so that we could have the older shall serve the

763
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:59,620
younger, the elder shall serve the younger. It's through crucifying that old

764
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:06,500
man and through the power of Christ that that new man, the younger, is able to have

765
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:12,820
the blessedness that God has designed for us to experience in the Christian

766
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:19,380
life. We notice in Galatians 5, a few chapters over, notice what God says here

767
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:25,940
in Galatians 5, in verse number 16. We referenced verse 17 a moment ago, but in

768
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:33,380
verse number 16 it says this, this I say then, walk in the Spirit and ye shall not

769
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:39,260
fulfill the lust of the flesh. Did he say that the lust of the flesh would be gone?

770
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:47,140
No. Do you still have, does your flesh still have desires? Sure it does, but as

771
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:55,780
we walk in the Spirit, he says ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh. When

772
00:42:55,780 --> 00:43:00,940
we've crucified that old man, we've crucified the flesh, we now are walking

773
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:04,700
in the Spirit. Aren't you thankful that the moment of salvation, Ephesians 1

774
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:07,860
deals with this as well, the proof of redemption is the Holy Spirit of God

775
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:12,180
lives within me. I didn't understand all of it when I got saved, and you probably

776
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:16,740
didn't either. It was a miracle that took place at salvation, and then as you

777
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:20,940
begin to grow and you understand that God in the person of the Holy Spirit

778
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:25,540
came and dwelt, and my body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in me, which I

779
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:29,900
have of God, and man it's amazing, and then it starts to make sense as to why

780
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:34,140
all of a sudden, you know, I didn't have the same level of ease and comfort of

781
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:38,100
doing these things because the Holy Spirit of God is convicting, and

782
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:42,460
he's dealing with us, and then the Holy Spirit of God enables us to have the

783
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:48,220
victory as we yield to him. It says this in verse 17, for the flesh lusteth against

784
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:52,860
the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh, and these are contrary the one to

785
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:58,100
the other, so that ye cannot do the things that ye would. Skip down to verse

786
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:03,820
number 24, and they that are Christ, are you Christ? Do you belong to him? Amen! I've

787
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:08,940
been born again. I belong to him. They that are Christ have crucified the

788
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:15,260
flesh with the affections and lust. If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in

789
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:20,260
the Spirit. The things I used to do, I don't do them anymore. We sing that song

790
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:24,060
with the kids and we talk about it. Listen, the reality is that if you've

791
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:31,700
been born again, and as we that are belonging to Christ, we crucify the flesh.

792
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:36,620
Ephesians 4 deals with this. Colossians 3 deals with this. We preached on this, I

793
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:41,260
preached on this on Sunday mornings this year several times in Colossians 3, when

794
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:46,700
we understood our position in Christ, who we are in Christ. We're complete in him.

795
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:52,620
We seek those things which are above, not those things which are below. We mortify

796
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:56,900
our members which are upon the earth, Colossians 3 and verse number 5, and we

797
00:44:56,900 --> 00:45:02,500
understand this put-off and put-on truth of Ephesians and Colossians and

798
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:07,140
the way in which we deal with this truth. And listen, the flesh is not

799
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:15,280
eradicated at salvation. It'd be wonderful if it was, but it's not. And the

800
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:19,940
way that we have victory is through yielding to Christ. And the Holy Spirit

801
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:25,300
of God lives within us, and it's such a precious truth. And so when we look at a

802
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:29,580
passage here this evening of Genesis chapter 25, and we note the

803
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:34,460
supplication, and we see the way, and we're reminded again how God hears and

804
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:38,580
answers prayer, and how that ought to cause us to rejoice, we find that Isaac

805
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:43,140
prayed, and then Rebekah conceived, and then we see that Rebekah prayed, and God

806
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:48,540
answered. Why am I thus? Why the struggle within? And God gives the answer, and

807
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:55,340
we find the symbolism. They're two nations. They're also two natures. When

808
00:45:55,340 --> 00:46:03,900
you look at the life of Jacob and Esau, you see two very different people. You

809
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:07,940
trace their lives. I mean, right from their birth, just their looks were

810
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:13,220
so different, right? And you see the difference in them, and you understand

811
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:18,300
the difference in the old man versus the new man. I'm so thankful that I'm not

812
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:25,020
what I used to be. I'm not all that I am supposed to be, because he's still

813
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:29,180
working on me, and he's still working on you, but I'm so glad I'm not what I used

814
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:36,060
to be. Aren't you? And the work that Christ has done through us as a

815
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:41,700
result of redemption and salvation, and we say, listen, there are two natures, and

816
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:46,060
the application this evening is so important. We understand the need for

817
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:53,580
us to submit ourselves and to yield ourselves to Christ. Sin no longer shall

818
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:59,220
have dominion over us. The flesh, according to Ephesians 1, there are

819
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:05,820
desires of the flesh, but as we walk in the Spirit, according to Galatians 5, you

820
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:11,980
shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh. And this evening, I'm thankful that we

821
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:16,460
can have victory. Aren't you thankful for that? I'm thankful for salvation, but

822
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:20,100
I'm thankful that we can live the victorious Christian life, and we can

823
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:25,660
live and have the joy and the peace that God has designed for us to have. The

824
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:30,820
Christian life is supposed to be just magnificent, I mean, marvelous,

825
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:36,940
wonderful, all that God has for us as we yield to him and allow him to work

826
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:44,420
through us. There's two natures, but God's plan is that the elder shall serve the

827
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:52,180
younger. The old man shall serve the new man, and it's only possible through the

828
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:56,620
Lord Jesus Christ. The elder shall serve the younger. Let's pray. Father, we love

829
00:47:56,620 --> 00:48:01,660
you. We thank you for loving us. Thank you for the Word of God. We note this evening

830
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:10,060
the truth. We understand the contextual interpretation and the truth with

831
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:14,540
regard to these two nations. We read all throughout the Old Testament of the

832
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:21,380
conflict between the Edomites and the Israelites. We see how that your focus

833
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:30,260
and the truth of Jacob being chosen for the nation of Israel and the Messianic

834
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:34,900
line, and Lord, we rejoice in that truth that was revealed in this passage of

835
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:41,020
Scripture. Personally and practically this evening, we think about our own two

836
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:46,340
natures. I thank you for salvation, redemption through the blood of Jesus

837
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:51,100
Christ, and God, I pray that you'd help us to walk in the Spirit so that we

838
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:55,780
would not fulfill the lust of the flesh, that truly the elder shall serve the

839
00:48:55,780 --> 00:49:01,140
younger, and I pray that we'd understand this evening that it's only possible

840
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:07,900
through your power, that you'd help us to yield and submit to you, that we'd allow

841
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:13,140
you to have your will in a way that we'd live in victory. Pray that you'd move and

842
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:16,500
work as only you can, that decisions would be made that would please thee, and

843
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:21,940
we'll thank you for all that you'll do. For it's in Christ's name we pray.
