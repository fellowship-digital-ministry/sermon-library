1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,039
text in the book of Ruth but Ruth chapter number three

2
00:00:04,039 --> 00:00:07,480
and if you're familiar with the book you'll understand

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,560
that Ruth, the book is obviously named

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,319
after her and she's a central character throughout the book

5
00:00:14,319 --> 00:00:18,479
and at this point we come to chapter three, they've already returned back to

6
00:00:18,479 --> 00:00:19,440
Bethlehem

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,159
and it was there in Moab where Ruth was

8
00:00:23,159 --> 00:00:26,959
married to a Jewish family or into a Jewish family

9
00:00:27,159 --> 00:00:30,360
and she went back to

10
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,840
the place of Bethlehem with her mother-in-law Naomi

11
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,439
and as she's there we see the wonderful account

12
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:41,759
of Boaz and all that takes place and really the book

13
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:45,720
if you were to look at the entirety of the book of Ruth it's a beautiful picture

14
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:50,520
of the kinsman Redeemer and obviously a great picture of the Lord Jesus Christ

15
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,599
as our kinsman Redeemer

16
00:00:52,599 --> 00:00:55,639
and Boaz as the human

17
00:00:55,639 --> 00:01:00,560
character here in the book of Ruth, he ensured that the law was fulfilled

18
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,680
before he redeemed Ruth, there were certain things that had to happen

19
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,720
based on the law that God had set forth

20
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:12,519
and I find that as we would look at the passage of Scripture and understand the

21
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:13,839
completeness of it

22
00:01:13,839 --> 00:01:18,879
that we can praise God that Jesus Christ also fulfilled all of the law so that we

23
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:20,440
could be redeemed

24
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:24,400
and what a blessing it is to know that Jesus is our Savior

25
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,360
and if you're here this morning and you know that you can remember a day in

26
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,519
which you trust that Christ is your Savior that you recognize you are a

27
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:32,120
sinner

28
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,199
and Christ was the only Savior you turn to Him

29
00:01:35,199 --> 00:01:39,919
alone not your works not anything you think you could do but Christ

30
00:01:39,919 --> 00:01:45,440
alone then we rejoice in our salvation if you're not saved we would trust that

31
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,680
God will work in your heart in such a way

32
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,760
that you would trust Christ as your Savior today

33
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,440
we find that today May 11th

34
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:58,279
2025 is Mother's Day and it's very interesting

35
00:01:58,279 --> 00:02:01,279
because it was a hundred and twelve years ago today

36
00:02:01,279 --> 00:02:06,839
that Worley was the first observance of Mother's Day though the law had not been

37
00:02:06,839 --> 00:02:10,559
established yet was May 11th 1913

38
00:02:10,559 --> 00:02:14,600
and what had happened is yesterday would be a hundred twelve years ago so the day

39
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,839
before on May 10th

40
00:02:15,839 --> 00:02:20,279
the House of Representatives passed a resolution calling on all federal

41
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,679
government officials

42
00:02:21,679 --> 00:02:27,320
from the president all the way down to wear a white carnation the following day

43
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:31,199
on May 11th 1913 on observance of Mother's Day

44
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:36,279
in the 1870s 80s 90s you can see a number of things with regard to

45
00:02:36,279 --> 00:02:40,440
some of the history with regard to Mother's Day and when it was first

46
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,880
observed in certain

47
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:46,240
places around the country and so on and so forth but we find that it was the

48
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,279
following year

49
00:02:47,279 --> 00:02:50,759
in 1914 that the US Congress passed

50
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:56,039
a law and in doing so they designated the second Sunday in May

51
00:02:56,039 --> 00:03:01,320
as Mother's Day so since 1914 it's been the second Sunday

52
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:06,039
in May in the United States of America that we observe Mother's Day I feel

53
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:08,919
like I'm safe to say that means for all of us

54
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:13,520
since 1914 so all of our lives the second Sunday

55
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:18,600
in May has been Mother's Day. Now not every country celebrates Mother's Day

56
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:23,160
on the same day but we find that best I can tell I tried to do a bunch of

57
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,679
research this week to get a number and it was kinda

58
00:03:25,679 --> 00:03:29,679
scattered with regard to some of the information I could find but best I

59
00:03:29,679 --> 00:03:32,000
could tell from the sources that I combined

60
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,039
there are 179 countries around the world

61
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:39,039
that have some day on their calendar to

62
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:44,559
honor mothers and a number of them have it set up like we do that it's the

63
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:45,960
second Sunday of May

64
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:51,679
but 179 countries that's a large majority of the countries around the

65
00:03:51,679 --> 00:03:52,520
globe

66
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,639
that have a day to celebrate mothers and to

67
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:59,759
honor their role. This morning as we begin to look at this passage of

68
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:00,639
scripture and

69
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:04,520
couple it with some verses from the book of Proverbs I want to deal with the

70
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,240
subject

71
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:10,000
here from the book of Ruth where the Bible refers to Ruth as being a virtuous

72
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,679
woman. A virtuous woman and that's the title for the message this morning. The

73
00:04:14,679 --> 00:04:16,760
word virtuous means morally good

74
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:22,040
it's acting in conformity to the moral law. It carries with it the idea of being

75
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,920
chaste

76
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:26,000
that word means to be undefiled, to be pure

77
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,399
we find that this phrase virtuous woman if you were to search through the

78
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:32,279
entirety of the Bible

79
00:04:32,559 --> 00:04:38,119
the phrase is used just three times. Just three times you'll find the phrase

80
00:04:38,119 --> 00:04:42,600
a virtuous woman. When you begin to think about those three times obviously since

81
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,440
it's so few you can easily go to them and study them and

82
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,920
easily reference them but in those three references

83
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:54,279
we find that there's only one time in the entire Bible that God describes

84
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:58,239
an individual as being a virtuous woman

85
00:04:58,679 --> 00:05:02,720
and that's here in the book of Ruth. It's very interesting as you begin to understand

86
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,679
what's taking place. Notice in verse number 11 of Ruth chapter 3

87
00:05:06,679 --> 00:05:11,000
and I'm jumping, I'll read verse 10, we'll read the context. In verse 10 he said

88
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,160
to Ruth, blessed be thou the Lord my daughter

89
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,480
for thou hast showed more kindness in the latter end

90
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:23,040
than at the beginning and as much as thou followest not young men whether poor or

91
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,600
rich

92
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:29,440
and now my daughter fear not I will do to thee all that thou requirest

93
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,959
then notice this phrase for all the city of my people doth know

94
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:37,279
that thou are a virtuous

95
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:42,079
woman. I believe there's probably arguments that we could make that we

96
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:43,559
could say that there are other

97
00:05:43,559 --> 00:05:49,440
ladies within the scriptures that could be referred to as being a virtuous woman

98
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,480
but God chose to only record on one occasion in his word

99
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,839
where he refers to someone as a virtuous woman

100
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:02,440
and that's Ruth. It's very interesting because the other two passages of

101
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,279
scripture

102
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:06,720
or verses of scripture that deal with the subject that you'll read the word or

103
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,600
the phrase a virtuous woman

104
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,880
those two references are found in the book of Proverbs.

105
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,839
We find that in the book of Proverbs we're reminded of course that the human

106
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:18,320
penman in the book of Proverbs is Solomon

107
00:06:18,359 --> 00:06:21,720
the wise man and it's interesting to note that he is the great

108
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:28,679
great grandson of Ruth and so Ruth is his great great grandmother the one that

109
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:30,200
God says is a

110
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,320
virtuous woman. This testimony that is

111
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:38,679
shared in verse number 11 as Boaz is speaking to her and says for all the

112
00:06:38,679 --> 00:06:40,279
city of my people

113
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:44,600
doth know that thou art a virtuous

114
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,160
woman. Many years later

115
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,640
God will allow Solomon to pen two verses of scripture

116
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:59,119
that speak about a virtuous woman and it's his great great grandmother that's

117
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:00,600
referred that way. I just find that

118
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:06,320
interesting and I don't believe that he probably knew his great great

119
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,320
grandmother

120
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,600
but there's no doubt in my mind that he knew about

121
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,839
and we have the opportunity to read scripture

122
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:18,839
that outlines the life of Ruth and so obviously there was a

123
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:22,519
an awareness that Solomon would have had regarding

124
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:26,519
this beautiful account that God has given to us in his word.

125
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:31,119
As we begin to think about this subject or this title a virtuous woman and thinking

126
00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:31,839
about this

127
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:35,839
description that is given to us I want you to consider a few thoughts this

128
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:36,480
morning

129
00:07:36,679 --> 00:07:39,880
Number one, a virtuous woman is invaluable.

130
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:44,079
Is invaluable. The word invaluable means precious

131
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:49,720
above estimation. It carries this idea so valuable

132
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,040
that its worth cannot be estimated.

133
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:58,160
Why would I use the word invaluable? Well I do have three eyes this morning for my

134
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:58,799
points

135
00:07:58,799 --> 00:08:02,480
but I did not simply try to find a word that would fit

136
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:07,239
in there so that it could be consistent but I truly believe that as we look at

137
00:08:07,239 --> 00:08:08,320
the scriptures

138
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:12,279
that we find that God communicates to us that a virtuous woman

139
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:15,760
is invaluable. That her value

140
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:20,399
that the value of her worth is it cannot be estimated.

141
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:23,399
Notice if you will over in Proverbs chapter 31

142
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:26,959
these are the two verses that we'll look at in the book of Proverbs that Solomon

143
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:27,839
would pen

144
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:31,760
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God. Turn to Proverbs 31 if you will.

145
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:38,320
In Proverbs 31

146
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:44,559
in verse number one the Bible tells us the proverb or the words, excuse me, of

147
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:47,039
King Lemuel. We believe that's a title that's

148
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:51,479
given to Solomon. The prophecy, notice this, that his mother

149
00:08:51,479 --> 00:08:55,440
taught him. In fact I preached from this few verses of

150
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,440
verses 1 through 9 last year on Mother's Day and I talked about the

151
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:02,640
teaching of a mother and the words, these things that

152
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:08,400
that his mother taught him and what a blessing and a privilege. But we're going to look

153
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,280
through the chapter and it's in this chapter we often refer to as the

154
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:16,919
Proverbs 31 woman and we'll use that phraseology and all of the description

155
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:17,840
that is given

156
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:22,080
but I want you to look in verse number 10. The Bible says this

157
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,640
who can find a virtuous woman

158
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:31,119
for her price is far

159
00:09:31,119 --> 00:09:37,200
above rubies. This is God giving to us, it's

160
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,679
His word. We know that Solomon is the human penman but God is communicating to

161
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:43,479
us here this morning as we

162
00:09:43,479 --> 00:09:48,359
consider this verse of scripture that the virtuous woman is invaluable, that

163
00:09:48,359 --> 00:09:50,559
she's precious above estimation.

164
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:54,039
This one that would be described as being morally good

165
00:09:54,039 --> 00:10:00,039
in conformity to the moral law, being chaste, being undefiled and pure.

166
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:02,039
that she's invaluable.

167
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:08,039
We find that God, as Solomon is writing here

168
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:10,039
and communicating to us, and we know if we were to study

169
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:13,039
the life of Solomon, that one of the problems

170
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:16,039
that Solomon had was a problem with women.

171
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:21,039
But it's interesting that God would even use him

172
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:26,039
to pen such valuable, powerful truth for us this morning

173
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:27,039
that we understand, he says,

174
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:31,039
who can find a virtuous woman for her price

175
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:34,039
is far above rubies?

176
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:37,039
Begin to consider, as I look at this verse of Scripture

177
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:40,039
and considering that a virtuous woman is invaluable,

178
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:43,039
that we'd understand this morning that if you are blessed

179
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:47,039
and you would begin to understand maybe your wife

180
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:51,039
or maybe your mother, maybe your wife and mother

181
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:54,039
of your children, if you were to consider this morning

182
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:58,039
that you have a wife that is a virtuous woman,

183
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:02,039
maybe this morning for the ladies that there's this desire

184
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:06,039
that we would be known as being a virtuous woman

185
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:10,039
and the appreciation of a child,

186
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:15,039
the appreciation of a husband, of this virtuous woman,

187
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:18,039
our bulletin today from Proverbs 31, the same chapter,

188
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:22,039
it says her children rise up and call her blessed.

189
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:29,039
It says that her price is far above rubies.

190
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:33,039
I hope this morning that you can understand the value

191
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:36,039
that God places back in Proverbs chapter 12.

192
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:37,039
You're there in chapter 31.

193
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:40,039
Look back, if you will, at chapter 12 just for a moment

194
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:43,039
and this is the other passage or verse of Scripture

195
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:47,039
that God gives us with regard to a virtuous woman.

196
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,039
And in this verse, like so many others

197
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:51,039
in the book of Proverbs, there's a contrast

198
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:54,039
that is provided to us in the verse of Scripture

199
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:57,039
and it begins by speaking about the virtuous woman

200
00:11:57,039 --> 00:11:59,039
and notice what the Bible says in Proverbs 12

201
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:04,039
in verse number four, a virtuous woman is a crown

202
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:08,039
to her husband, is a crown to her husband.

203
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:11,039
You know, the Bible says here in the book of Proverbs,

204
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:13,039
whoso findeth a wife, findeth a good thing

205
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:16,039
and obtain the favor of the Lord.

206
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:19,039
I'm thankful that God gave me a wife

207
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:22,039
and that I found a good thing, as he would say

208
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:24,039
and I don't use that word to be negative,

209
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:26,039
I'm just using the biblical context,

210
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:29,039
whoso findeth a wife, findeth a good thing

211
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:32,039
and obtain the favor of the Lord.

212
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:34,039
And the Bible says that a virtuous woman

213
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:38,039
is a crown to her husband.

214
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:41,039
The contrast, but she that maketh ashamed

215
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:44,039
is as rottenness in his bones.

216
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:48,039
I mean, what great contrast in one verse of Scripture

217
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:51,039
that we find here in Proverbs 12 in verse number four

218
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:54,039
and again, as he begins speaking about the virtuous woman,

219
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:57,039
he says that she's a crown to her husband.

220
00:12:57,039 --> 00:12:59,039
What a blessing.

221
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:01,039
As we consider Ruth this morning

222
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:04,039
and we look in this passage of Scripture

223
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:06,039
in the book of Ruth and we begin to understand

224
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:11,039
and deal with her and the situation

225
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:14,039
in which she was dealing with as she would go back there

226
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:19,039
to Bethlehem and being in that place

227
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:21,039
and all that would take place

228
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:24,039
and having this testimony.

229
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:26,039
Boaz understood the value.

230
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:30,039
He understood that she was invaluable.

231
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:35,039
Boaz says to her in verse number 11 of our text,

232
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:39,039
I will do to thee all that thou requirest.

233
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:43,039
Why was he willing to do all that was necessary?

234
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:45,039
Because he, not just the city,

235
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:48,039
he says all the people in the city, they know,

236
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:51,039
but he knew that she was a virtuous woman.

237
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:53,039
That's what we say.

238
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:55,039
I'm gonna do whatever's necessary

239
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:59,039
to be able to have her as my wife.

240
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:01,039
Praise the Lord.

241
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:03,039
She's invaluable.

242
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:05,039
And Boaz acknowledged that.

243
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:07,039
He recognized that this morning.

244
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:10,039
I hope that we would understand if God has blessed you

245
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:12,039
and you would sit there and not in a prideful way,

246
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:15,039
but you say, I believe that God has given to me a wife

247
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,039
that's a virtuous woman.

248
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:19,039
God's given to me a mother that's a virtuous woman

249
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:24,039
that you thank God for that, that you appreciate that truth.

250
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:27,039
We find that as we continue and look at this text

251
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:30,039
and we say that a virtuous woman is invaluable,

252
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:31,039
but I would say this, number two,

253
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:34,039
a virtuous woman is identifiable.

254
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,039
Identifiable.

255
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:36,039
What do we mean by that?

256
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:40,039
Well, we look in chapter three and we understand what happens,

257
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:42,039
but I wanna back up just a little bit,

258
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:44,039
if we could, into the book of Ruth

259
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:45,039
and catch some of the context.

260
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:48,039
The Bible tells us in chapter number one,

261
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:50,039
look back, if you will, in chapter number one.

262
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:53,039
We begin to see what happens and they were there.

263
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:54,039
They had gone to Moab.

264
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:55,039
Why?

265
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:56,039
Because there was a famine in the land

266
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:58,039
and they get there to Moab

267
00:14:58,039 --> 00:15:00,039
and it's just the husband and wife and two sons

268
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:02,039
and they marry girls from Moab

269
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:07,039
and Ruth and Orpah are the names of these daughters-in-laws

270
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:10,039
and we find that the husband, Malon and Chilion,

271
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:12,039
the sons, they all die

272
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:15,039
and so we find that here, Elimelech, Malon, Chilion,

273
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,039
they've all died and Ruth is there

274
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:20,039
with her two daughters-in-law.

275
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:21,039
She's gonna go back.

276
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:24,039
She heard, she did not experience,

277
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:27,039
but she heard that God had visited his people

278
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:30,039
according to verse number six and gave them bread.

279
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:31,039
There was a famine in the land,

280
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:33,039
but she heard that God was working

281
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:35,039
so she's gonna go back to her homeland

282
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:39,039
and as we look at the text, the Bible says that she says,

283
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:41,039
notice if you will, in verse number 11,

284
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:43,039
and Naomi said, turn again, my daughters.

285
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:45,039
Why will you go with me?

286
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:47,039
Are there yet any more sons in my womb

287
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:49,039
that they may be your husbands?

288
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:51,039
Turn again, my daughters, go your way

289
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:53,039
for I am too old to have a husband.

290
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:55,039
If I should say I have hope,

291
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:58,039
if I should have a husband also tonight

292
00:15:58,039 --> 00:15:59,039
and should also bear sons,

293
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:02,039
would you tarry for them till they were grown?

294
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:05,039
Would you stay for them from having husbands?

295
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:09,039
Nay, my daughters, for it grieveth me much for your sakes

296
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:12,039
that the hand of the Lord has gone out against me.

297
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:14,039
They lifted up their voice and wept again

298
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:17,039
and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law,

299
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:18,039
but notice this, the Bible says,

300
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:21,039
Ruth, clave unto her.

301
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:23,039
In verse number 15 of chapter one,

302
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:25,039
the Bible says that she said,

303
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:27,039
behold, thy sister-in-law has gone back

304
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:30,039
unto her people and unto her gods.

305
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:33,039
Return thou after thy sister-in-law.

306
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:35,039
And so what does Naomi say to Ruth?

307
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:38,039
She says, Orpah's gone back.

308
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:40,039
Orpah's not coming with me.

309
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:44,039
Orpah's returned as I've even suggested for her to do.

310
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:47,039
And yet Ruth clave to her.

311
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:49,039
And she says, go back with her,

312
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:50,039
not only to her people,

313
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:53,039
but she says this unto her gods.

314
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:54,039
You notice it's a little G,

315
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:56,039
they're false gods, they're idols.

316
00:16:56,039 --> 00:16:58,039
And we find that the Bible says

317
00:16:58,039 --> 00:17:02,039
that Ruth said, entreat me not to leave thee,

318
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:03,039
in verse number 16,

319
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:06,039
or to return from following after thee.

320
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:08,039
For whither thou goest, I will go,

321
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:10,039
and where thou lodgest, I will lodge.

322
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:12,039
Thy people shall be my people,

323
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:15,039
and thy God, my God.

324
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,039
Where thou diest, will I die,

325
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,039
and there will I be buried.

326
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:20,039
The Lord do so to me,

327
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:24,039
and more also, if ought, but death part thee and me.

328
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:27,039
When she saw that she was steadfastly minded

329
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,039
to go with her,

330
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:31,039
then she left speaking unto her.

331
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,039
The Bible tells us in verse 19,

332
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:37,039
so they too went until they came to Bethlehem,

333
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,039
and it came to pass,

334
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:39,039
notice what it says,

335
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,039
when they were come to Bethlehem,

336
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,039
that all the city was moved about them,

337
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:48,039
and they said, is this Naomi?

338
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:50,039
She said unto them, call me not Naomi,

339
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:51,039
call me Mara,

340
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:54,039
for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.

341
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:55,039
I went out full,

342
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,039
and the Lord hath brought me home again empty.

343
00:17:58,039 --> 00:17:59,039
Why then call you me Naomi,

344
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,039
seeing the Lord hath testified against me,

345
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,039
and the Almighty hath afflicted me.

346
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:06,039
The Bible tells us in verse 22,

347
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:07,039
that Naomi returned,

348
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,039
and Ruth the Moabitess,

349
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,039
her daughter-in-law with her,

350
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,039
which returned out of the country of Moab,

351
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,039
and they came to Bethlehem

352
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:17,039
in the beginning of barley harvest.

353
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,039
We won't take time to read

354
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:20,039
much of the next couple of chapters,

355
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:22,039
but we understand that in these days,

356
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:26,039
this is the entrance into the city of Bethlehem.

357
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:28,039
This is the first experience

358
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:33,039
that Ruth would have in the Jewish land,

359
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,039
in that Jewish city of Bethlehem,

360
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,039
and she comes,

361
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:38,039
and we find that the Bible tells us

362
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:40,039
that Naomi had a kinsman,

363
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:41,039
according to chapter two,

364
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,039
and his name is Boaz,

365
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,039
and Ruth was given specific instruction

366
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:48,039
throughout the next chapter and a half,

367
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:50,039
and we find that she was diligent

368
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:52,039
in her duties and her responsibilities.

369
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:53,039
She worked hard.

370
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,039
She did all of these things

371
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:56,039
that she was doing

372
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:58,039
to be able to provide

373
00:18:58,039 --> 00:18:59,039
and to help reach,

374
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,039
provide the food that they needed,

375
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,039
and so on and so forth,

376
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,039
and we find that during this time,

377
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:08,039
it's only about four to six weeks

378
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:10,039
at the end of chapter two.

379
00:19:10,039 --> 00:19:11,039
Notice the Bible says

380
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,039
at the end of chapter two in verse 23,

381
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,039
so she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz

382
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:18,039
to glean unto the end of barley harvest

383
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:19,039
and of wheat harvest,

384
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,039
and dwelt with her mother-in-law.

385
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,039
If you notice,

386
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:23,039
at the end of chapter one,

387
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,039
it tells us it was the beginning,

388
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,039
and now it tells us the end,

389
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:30,039
so it's only really about four to six weeks.

390
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:31,039
We're talking about

391
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,039
a virtuous woman is identifiable.

392
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:37,039
There was something about her behavior

393
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:40,039
in those four to six weeks,

394
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:41,039
because what happens

395
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,039
is we read chapter number three,

396
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,039
and we find that in chapter number three,

397
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,039
as we begin reading the chapter,

398
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,039
that Ruth is given

399
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:50,039
specific instruction from Naomi

400
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:52,039
with regard to what she is to do

401
00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:54,039
and how she is to go about

402
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:56,039
presenting herself to Boaz

403
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:58,039
as being the one,

404
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:00,039
the kinsman, the near kinsman.

405
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:02,699
that would redeem or buy her back.

406
00:20:02,699 --> 00:20:06,219
And we find that Ruth receives all of this instruction

407
00:20:06,219 --> 00:20:09,059
and she says that she's going to do,

408
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:10,739
according to verse number five,

409
00:20:10,739 --> 00:20:11,679
and she said unto her,

410
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,899
all that thou sayest unto me, I will do.

411
00:20:14,899 --> 00:20:16,839
She was submissive to the instruction.

412
00:20:16,839 --> 00:20:19,499
She was obedient to what her mother-in-law

413
00:20:19,499 --> 00:20:21,519
had given her to do.

414
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:25,299
Not only did she say that she would, but she did.

415
00:20:25,299 --> 00:20:27,259
If you read verses six through nine,

416
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:31,239
it's the fulfillment, the actual obedience, the outworking.

417
00:20:31,239 --> 00:20:36,239
We can say that we're going to do and not do, right?

418
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,159
The Lord Jesus Christ used the illustration.

419
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:43,239
He said about that situation there

420
00:20:43,239 --> 00:20:45,199
that one says, I'm not gonna do it,

421
00:20:45,199 --> 00:20:46,759
but then later on went and did it.

422
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:50,479
And one said, I'm going to do it, but never went and did it.

423
00:20:50,479 --> 00:20:53,159
The reality is that Naomi had given to Ruth

424
00:20:53,159 --> 00:20:57,939
good instruction with regard to the law of her people.

425
00:20:57,939 --> 00:21:00,739
Remember, she said, your people will be my people.

426
00:21:00,739 --> 00:21:02,339
Your God will be my God.

427
00:21:02,339 --> 00:21:06,679
And so there was a process that God had given to them

428
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:08,819
that had to be fulfilled.

429
00:21:08,819 --> 00:21:11,299
And Ruth is going to that place.

430
00:21:11,299 --> 00:21:12,979
She fulfills all of that.

431
00:21:12,979 --> 00:21:16,539
And we find that when Boaz speaks to her,

432
00:21:16,539 --> 00:21:19,539
as we've read already this morning in verse 10 and 11,

433
00:21:19,539 --> 00:21:21,019
that in verse number 11,

434
00:21:21,019 --> 00:21:24,999
Boaz says, for all the city of my people

435
00:21:24,999 --> 00:21:29,259
doth know that thou art a virtuous woman.

436
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:31,919
That's precious to me.

437
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:35,499
To think about the testimony that Ruth had

438
00:21:35,499 --> 00:21:37,039
in just four to six weeks,

439
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:38,719
and to consider this morning

440
00:21:38,719 --> 00:21:41,779
that a virtuous woman is identifiable,

441
00:21:41,779 --> 00:21:43,959
that we could understand this morning

442
00:21:43,959 --> 00:21:46,179
that your testimony is important,

443
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:48,699
that how, listen, people are watching you.

444
00:21:49,479 --> 00:21:52,239
People are observing you.

445
00:21:52,239 --> 00:21:56,039
You come to that place and you think that no one sees,

446
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:57,999
no one cares, no one has any idea.

447
00:21:57,999 --> 00:22:00,159
No, there's people that are watching.

448
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:01,899
And in four to six weeks,

449
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:06,239
the amount of time that she was there in Bethlehem,

450
00:22:06,239 --> 00:22:07,819
she had this testimony.

451
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:13,679
Boaz says, all the city, not just a few people.

452
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:17,899
She was, obviously there's a big talk in town

453
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:19,799
when Naomi comes back.

454
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:21,479
We read it at the end of chapter number one,

455
00:22:21,479 --> 00:22:22,679
is not this Naomi?

456
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:24,959
And of course, Ruth is with her,

457
00:22:24,959 --> 00:22:27,839
and there's no husband, there are no sons,

458
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:30,999
and they know, they're understanding what's taking place.

459
00:22:30,999 --> 00:22:34,019
And as they would observe the behavior of Ruth

460
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,439
over the next couple of,

461
00:22:35,439 --> 00:22:38,279
these next month and a half,

462
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:41,919
they reach the conclusion, she's a virtuous woman.

463
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:45,879
For all of us this morning, we have a testimony.

464
00:22:46,879 --> 00:22:48,179
We have a testimony.

465
00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:49,679
There are people watching us.

466
00:22:50,659 --> 00:22:53,979
There are people that know that we're Christians.

467
00:22:55,519 --> 00:23:00,519
There are people that know in the workplace,

468
00:23:02,299 --> 00:23:05,139
they hear some of the things that we say.

469
00:23:05,139 --> 00:23:08,539
They wonder, didn't they say they were Christian?

470
00:23:08,539 --> 00:23:11,819
Talk about our testimony, our testimony.

471
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,439
How do we respond?

472
00:23:14,439 --> 00:23:17,079
How do we deal with difficulties in our life,

473
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:20,939
trials, hardships, frustrations?

474
00:23:20,939 --> 00:23:23,399
Our testimony, our testimony matters.

475
00:23:24,479 --> 00:23:26,639
Our testimony matters.

476
00:23:26,639 --> 00:23:30,439
And our testimony is impactful.

477
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:36,599
These people that observed Ruth,

478
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:39,779
they reached this conclusion, she's a virtuous woman.

479
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:44,759
I wonder, as people observe us,

480
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:47,339
as they observe your life, they observe my life,

481
00:23:48,639 --> 00:23:50,319
what conclusion do they reach?

482
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:53,599
How many of you have heard somebody say

483
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:55,639
something like this before?

484
00:23:55,639 --> 00:23:56,739
I don't wanna go to church

485
00:23:56,739 --> 00:23:59,279
because church is full of hypocrites.

486
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:00,259
You ever hear somebody say that?

487
00:24:00,259 --> 00:24:03,319
I've heard people say that so many times through the years.

488
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:04,619
What do they mean by that?

489
00:24:05,639 --> 00:24:09,519
Well, they mean that our lifestyle doesn't always equal

490
00:24:10,259 --> 00:24:11,299
what we say.

491
00:24:11,299 --> 00:24:13,459
Now, we understand and we'd readily acknowledge

492
00:24:13,459 --> 00:24:16,739
we're not perfect, we're just saved people.

493
00:24:16,739 --> 00:24:19,579
But you know, there's some things that we do

494
00:24:19,579 --> 00:24:22,399
that tarnish our testimony.

495
00:24:23,739 --> 00:24:26,419
There's some decisions that we can make

496
00:24:26,419 --> 00:24:29,479
that can tarnish our testimony.

497
00:24:31,099 --> 00:24:34,539
And we find this morning that the purpose of our testimony,

498
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:38,659
yes, a good name is precious.

499
00:24:38,679 --> 00:24:40,079
We think about that truth,

500
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:42,419
and I just started to quote that all messed up,

501
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:45,459
but the reality is that we understand this morning

502
00:24:45,459 --> 00:24:48,479
that we are desiring to have a good name,

503
00:24:48,479 --> 00:24:51,079
but not just for our own selves.

504
00:24:51,079 --> 00:24:52,999
We understand that it says a good name

505
00:24:52,999 --> 00:24:56,119
is rather to be chosen than great riches and loving favor

506
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:58,639
rather than silver and gold.

507
00:24:58,639 --> 00:25:02,299
A good name, that testimony.

508
00:25:02,299 --> 00:25:04,559
But ultimately, what's our testimony to reflect?

509
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,399
Well, my savior, amen?

510
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:13,399
Jesus said this, we're to let our light shine, why?

511
00:25:13,399 --> 00:25:14,759
So that men may see your good works

512
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:18,159
and glorify your father, which is in heaven.

513
00:25:19,479 --> 00:25:21,039
Which is in heaven.

514
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:23,559
And I just wonder as I look at the text of scripture

515
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:24,919
and consider this morning

516
00:25:24,919 --> 00:25:27,319
that a virtuous woman is identifiable,

517
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:29,599
I wonder this morning how people,

518
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:32,039
what type of conclusion people would reach

519
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:33,779
about our testimony.

520
00:25:34,659 --> 00:25:37,859
Yes, for mothers, yes, for the ladies,

521
00:25:37,879 --> 00:25:39,679
but also for the men here this morning.

522
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:42,919
We have a testimony, we have a testimony.

523
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:47,639
We need to be careful that we seek to lift up

524
00:25:47,639 --> 00:25:51,159
and exalt the Lord Jesus Christ in our lives.

525
00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:53,039
We ought to be careful that people understand

526
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,919
that it's Christ that's the hero of our story,

527
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:58,839
that he's the one, if there's anything good about us,

528
00:25:58,839 --> 00:26:02,239
it's because of Jesus Christ and him alone.

529
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:06,719
And that we'd be careful not to make decisions

530
00:26:06,739 --> 00:26:10,139
that would tarnish our testimony.

531
00:26:11,379 --> 00:26:14,059
That we'd be careful, see Paul says this,

532
00:26:14,059 --> 00:26:15,659
he says, all things are lawful

533
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:18,019
but not all things are expedient.

534
00:26:18,019 --> 00:26:20,699
That's a great truth that God gives us in his word.

535
00:26:21,999 --> 00:26:24,419
You say, oh, you're a Christian, you can't do this.

536
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:26,699
Well, there's certain things that I choose not to do

537
00:26:26,699 --> 00:26:28,559
because of testimony sake.

538
00:26:29,619 --> 00:26:31,059
Does that make sense?

539
00:26:31,059 --> 00:26:32,779
Because of testimony sake.

540
00:26:34,019 --> 00:26:35,479
And there's some times in your life

541
00:26:35,479 --> 00:26:37,699
that you have to evaluate and say, what are we doing?

542
00:26:37,699 --> 00:26:39,339
Why are we doing?

543
00:26:39,339 --> 00:26:41,539
Are we making decisions

544
00:26:41,539 --> 00:26:45,059
that are tarnishing the testimony of ourselves

545
00:26:45,059 --> 00:26:47,339
and more importantly of our God?

546
00:26:48,259 --> 00:26:52,299
How important do people think your God is to you?

547
00:26:54,259 --> 00:26:57,819
How important do people think your church is to you?

548
00:26:57,819 --> 00:26:59,619
You understand what I'm saying?

549
00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:01,499
And this morning we have a testimony,

550
00:27:01,499 --> 00:27:03,999
Naomi had this great testimony.

551
00:27:04,819 --> 00:27:09,339
Boaz says, the whole city of my people doth know

552
00:27:09,339 --> 00:27:12,019
that thou art a virtuous woman.

553
00:27:12,019 --> 00:27:14,259
A virtuous woman is invaluable.

554
00:27:14,259 --> 00:27:17,419
Her price is above rubies.

555
00:27:17,419 --> 00:27:20,339
He says, a virtuous woman, who can find?

556
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:22,979
Her price is far above rubies.

557
00:27:22,979 --> 00:27:25,579
A virtuous woman is identifiable.

558
00:27:26,579 --> 00:27:30,919
They're observing and they say, she's a virtuous woman.

559
00:27:30,939 --> 00:27:33,819
Number three, I would say this,

560
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:36,699
a virtuous woman is influential.

561
00:27:36,699 --> 00:27:38,239
Influential.

562
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:40,759
The reality this morning is that if we're to be

563
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:43,179
completely honest and transparent,

564
00:27:43,179 --> 00:27:45,819
every single one of us are influential.

565
00:27:45,819 --> 00:27:47,419
We have influence.

566
00:27:47,419 --> 00:27:49,179
You have influence.

567
00:27:49,179 --> 00:27:50,699
You say, I don't have much influence.

568
00:27:50,699 --> 00:27:51,939
You have influence.

569
00:27:53,019 --> 00:27:54,299
It doesn't matter how little

570
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:57,959
or how much your influence is, you have influence.

571
00:27:57,959 --> 00:27:59,859
There's someone that's observing you.

572
00:27:59,859 --> 00:28:01,799
The last point that we looked at,

573
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:03,659
but there's a measure of influence

574
00:28:03,659 --> 00:28:05,899
that you have in people's lives.

575
00:28:06,839 --> 00:28:09,999
When I'm speaking about a virtuous woman being influential,

576
00:28:09,999 --> 00:28:12,799
I'm speaking about the truth that we read

577
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:13,919
at the end of chapter four.

578
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,759
If you were to read the entirety of the fourth chapter,

579
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:20,199
you find that Ruth and Naomi, they had to wait

580
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:23,039
and they had to sit still and they had to wait on God

581
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:27,099
and wait on the situation with Boaz fulfilling the law.

582
00:28:27,099 --> 00:28:27,939
Why?

583
00:28:28,199 --> 00:28:30,439
What happened, if you look contextually,

584
00:28:30,439 --> 00:28:33,479
is that there was someone, it was true that Boaz

585
00:28:33,479 --> 00:28:36,479
was a near kinsman, but there was someone that was nearer.

586
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:42,199
What that meant under the law that God had prescribed

587
00:28:42,199 --> 00:28:44,799
was that it was the right for someone else

588
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:48,500
to first redeem Ruth to himself.

589
00:28:49,639 --> 00:28:54,539
And so Boaz could not overstep what the law had given

590
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:58,079
and prescribed and he had to follow the law.

591
00:28:59,399 --> 00:29:02,539
As much as he understood that she was a virtuous woman

592
00:29:02,539 --> 00:29:04,880
and he desired that she would be his wife,

593
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,979
he had to do things the right way.

594
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:09,839
And Ruth had to wait.

595
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:13,719
She had to wait and trust.

596
00:29:13,719 --> 00:29:15,799
You come to the fourth chapter and you find

597
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:19,320
that the conversation takes place, the witnesses are there

598
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,479
as they would, again, fulfill the law

599
00:29:21,479 --> 00:29:23,039
that God had prescribed.

600
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:24,539
And it says in verse number nine,

601
00:29:24,539 --> 00:29:27,859
and Boaz said unto the elders and unto all the people,

602
00:29:27,859 --> 00:29:30,820
ye are witnesses this day that I have bought all

603
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:33,059
that was Alimelech's and all that was Chilion's

604
00:29:33,059 --> 00:29:35,739
and Malon's of the hand of Naomi.

605
00:29:35,739 --> 00:29:39,419
Moreover, Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Malon,

606
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:42,059
have I purchased to be my wife,

607
00:29:42,059 --> 00:29:44,859
to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance,

608
00:29:44,859 --> 00:29:46,440
that the name of the dead be not cut off

609
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,940
from among his brethren and from the gate of his place.

610
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:52,539
Ye are witnesses this day.

611
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:58,380
And so we find that Ruth is now the wife of Boaz.

612
00:29:59,139 --> 00:30:00,380
Speaking about influence.

613
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:04,380
If you read verse number 13, the Bible says,

614
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:08,380
So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife,

615
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:11,380
and when he went in unto her,

616
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:17,380
the Lord gave her conception, and she bare a son.

617
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:19,380
She became a mom, a mother.

618
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:23,380
I understand that not all are mothers.

619
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:25,380
I understand that not all have children.

620
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,380
I understand there are some that are unmarried,

621
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:29,380
some that have never been able to have children.

622
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:31,380
And I'm sensitive to that.

623
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,380
We understand this morning that children are an

624
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:34,380
inheritance of the Lord.

625
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,380
The fruit of the womb is His reward,

626
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:38,380
and we're thankful and we're blessed.

627
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:42,380
But we find that here, Ruth, entering into this new phase,

628
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:47,380
listen, she was a virtuous woman when she was single.

629
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,380
Amen?

630
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:52,380
She was a virtuous woman when she was single.

631
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:56,380
She was a virtuous woman when she had no children.

632
00:30:56,380 --> 00:31:01,380
I believe she's still a virtuous woman when she has children.

633
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:04,380
And so we understand this morning as we look here

634
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:07,380
at the example of Ruth, and we look at this,

635
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:10,380
and we understand that God now has chosen

636
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:13,380
to bless her with a son.

637
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,380
I believe that the greatest area of influence

638
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:18,380
for a mother is her children.

639
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:20,380
Someone of yesteryear said,

640
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:23,380
The hand that rocks the cradle rules the world.

641
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:25,380
It's a familiar quote.

642
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:29,380
The reality is that God would give her a son.

643
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:31,380
As we look through the text of Scripture

644
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:36,380
and understand the truth of what takes place,

645
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:39,380
the Bible says that God gives her this son.

646
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:41,380
And who is this son?

647
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:43,380
Well, the Bible tells us in verse number 17,

648
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:45,380
And the women, her neighbors, gave it a name,

649
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:47,380
saying, There is a son born to Naomi,

650
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:49,380
of course that's the mother-in-law,

651
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:53,380
and they called his name Obed.

652
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:57,380
What makes this interesting is that Obed

653
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:00,380
is the father of Jesse.

654
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:04,380
Jesse is the father of David.

655
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:12,380
A virtuous woman is influential.

656
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:14,380
I was at this men's retreat,

657
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:16,380
and I was talking to this young fella,

658
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:19,380
and I knew the pastor, I didn't know anyone else there,

659
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,380
and just chatting as we were sitting around

660
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:23,380
on Friday evening, Saturday morning,

661
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:26,380
had some time just kind of chatting and fellowshipping,

662
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:29,380
and I began to ask him, he had a shirt on,

663
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,380
it said he had his name and said firefighter,

664
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:34,380
so it was pretty easy to say you're a firefighter.

665
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:37,380
And we got to talk about what he did and so on and so forth,

666
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:39,380
and was he married, did he have children,

667
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:41,380
and we began to talk about being married.

668
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:43,380
He's a younger fella, has a two-year-old son,

669
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:46,380
and we were talking and what have you,

670
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:49,380
and he mentioned that they made the decision to,

671
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:52,380
and I'm just sharing this testimony,

672
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,380
I'm not being critical of it,

673
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:56,380
but the reality is that he says,

674
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:58,380
we made the decision that my wife would stay home

675
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:02,380
so that she could spend time raising our son.

676
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:07,380
Because the influence that she can have in his life,

677
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:11,380
we want her to influence our son, not someone else.

678
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:14,380
And I thought, wow, praise the Lord.

679
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:16,380
I understand that not everyone can do that.

680
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,380
I understand that.

681
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:19,380
I'm aware of that.

682
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:22,380
But if you can, it's a huge blessing.

683
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,380
A huge blessing.

684
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:25,380
Why?

685
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:29,380
Because virtuous women are influential.

686
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:31,380
And you think about the influence

687
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:36,380
that no doubt Ruth had in the life of Obed,

688
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:39,380
and no doubt the influence then

689
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:42,380
that would pass down generationally.

690
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:45,380
There's a generational influence.

691
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:47,380
We find that the Bible tells us here

692
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:50,380
that Naomi took this role with regard

693
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:53,380
to even helping with Obed

694
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:55,380
and all that would take place.

695
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,380
In fact, in verse 16, it says that Naomi

696
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:59,380
took the child and laid it in her bosom

697
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:01,380
and became nurse unto it.

698
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:05,380
And you think about that influence of a grandmother.

699
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:10,380
Naomi, she came back into Bethlehem bitter.

700
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:13,380
Mara, don't call me Naomi any longer,

701
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:15,380
but now she's got joy

702
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:19,380
because of all that has transpired.

703
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:22,380
And we find as we look at the text of Scripture

704
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:25,380
that Obed is born to Boaz and to Ruth,

705
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:28,380
and then as we begin to think about Jesse,

706
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:30,380
it was Jesse that God identified

707
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,380
when He would reject Saul

708
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:34,380
from being the king of Israel.

709
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:36,380
And He says to Samuel,

710
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:38,380
go to the house of Jesse.

711
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,380
Why?

712
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:42,380
Because I have the next king

713
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,380
as one of his sons.

714
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:48,380
And you're going to go and you're going to anoint him.

715
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:52,380
David.

716
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:54,380
The book of Acts says that David

717
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:59,380
is a man after God's own heart.

718
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:02,380
If we were to look at the history of Israel

719
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,380
and the kingdom and all of that,

720
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:06,380
we'd say that David was the greatest king.

721
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:09,380
In fact, as you read through the Chronicles and the Kings,

722
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:11,380
you'll find that many times

723
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:14,380
what is referenced is the behavior

724
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:17,380
of the individual king compared to David.

725
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,380
David wasn't perfect.

726
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:19,380
We know his sin.

727
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:24,380
God records it for us.

728
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:27,380
But we find that there's influence

729
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:29,380
that a virtuous woman has.

730
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:32,380
Can I tell you today

731
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:35,380
that if you never have had children,

732
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,380
you still have influence.

733
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:40,380
If your children are raised,

734
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:43,380
you still have influence.

735
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:46,380
We have opportunity to influence others.

736
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,380
Listen, they need to see,

737
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,380
they need to understand that testimony

738
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,380
of a virtuous woman.

739
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,380
What does it look like?

740
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:55,380
Listen, can I tell you this morning

741
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:58,380
that the example that the world is providing of a woman

742
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:00,380
is not an example that I want my daughters to follow

743
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:02,380
nor my granddaughter?

744
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:05,380
I'm being very honest with you.

745
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,380
My daughters, praise the Lord,

746
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:08,380
they're 22 and 20.

747
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:09,380
Well, almost 22.

748
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:12,380
Next week should be 22, 22 and 20.

749
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:16,380
But I got a 19-month-old granddaughter.

750
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,380
I don't want my daughters

751
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,380
nor do I want my granddaughter

752
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:22,380
emulating what the world portrays.

753
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,380
Are you tracking?

754
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,380
I want them to see some examples

755
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:28,380
of some virtuous women first in my wife,

756
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,380
but then in the ladies of our church.

757
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:32,380
You have influence.

758
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:35,380
You have influence.

759
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:38,380
These girls stood up here and sang this morning,

760
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:40,380
Brianna, 20, and how old's Camilla?

761
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:41,380
Six, seven?

762
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:42,380
Seven, she just had a birthday.

763
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,380
She's seven.

764
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,380
Don't tell her I said six.

765
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:48,380
You're in trouble with kids, man.

766
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:50,380
Listen, those young girls,

767
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:55,380
they need to see some virtuous women.

768
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,380
You have influence.

769
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:59,380
Yes, mom has influence,

770
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:00,380
but the ladies of our church,

771
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:02,380
you have influence.

772
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:03,380
You have influence.

773
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:06,380
I want you to think about Timothy in closing.

774
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:10,380
Turn, if you will, to the book of 2 Timothy.

775
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:13,380
I want you to see what God tells us

776
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,380
in the book of 2 Timothy.

777
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:17,380
I'm going to read a verse from chapter 3

778
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:20,380
and then we're going to go back to chapter 1.

779
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:23,380
In 2 Timothy chapter number 3,

780
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:26,380
God tells us this about Timothy.

781
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:28,380
In 2 Timothy chapter 3,

782
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,380
Paul is speaking to Timothy,

783
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:32,380
obviously writing to him as his son of the faith

784
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:35,380
and giving him instruction.

785
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:37,380
He tells him all of these things in chapter 3

786
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,380
about the perilous times of the last days

787
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:43,380
and so on and so forth.

788
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,380
What's the answer?

789
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:48,380
What do we do knowing all of these things?

790
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:50,380
We continue.

791
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,380
We don't give up.

792
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:52,380
We don't quit.

793
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,380
We don't run.

794
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:54,380
We don't hide.

795
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:55,380
We continue.

796
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,380
And what is Paul saying?

797
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:59,380
Notice if we will pick it up in verse 14.

798
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,380
He says,

799
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:13,380
I believe that he's speaking in verse 14

800
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:15,380
of many of the things that Paul himself

801
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:18,380
had taught Timothy.

802
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:20,380
But he continues on in verse number 15

803
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:21,380
and he says,

804
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:30,380
Thou hast known the holy scriptures,

805
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:33,380
which are able to make thee wise unto salvation

806
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:37,380
through faith which is in Christ Jesus.

807
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:41,380
I'm thankful that the scriptures are holy.

808
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,380
He says,

809
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:45,380
Thou hast known the holy scriptures.

810
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:48,380
And he says that from a child

811
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:51,380
thou hast known the holy scriptures.

812
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:54,380
There was some influence taking place

813
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:56,380
in the life of little Timothy.

814
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:59,380
He was just a child.

815
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:02,380
We find the Bible tells us that the scriptures are holy

816
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:03,380
but they're able to make thee wise.

817
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:06,380
Notice what the Bible says unto salvation

818
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:09,380
through faith which is in Christ Jesus.

819
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,380
By the way,

820
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:12,380
I'm thankful that God provides for us

821
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:15,380
the plan of redemption in his word.

822
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:17,380
Salvation.

823
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:19,380
And salvation through how?

824
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,380
Not your works.

825
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:23,380
The Bible plainly says

826
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:26,380
that he has made thee wise unto salvation

827
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:27,380
or the holy scriptures,

828
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:29,380
which are able to make thee wise unto salvation

829
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:31,380
through faith which is in Christ Jesus.

830
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:34,380
That's what God has determined.

831
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,380
But I want you to go back to chapter one

832
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:40,380
as we deal with this influence of a virtuous woman.

833
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,380
The two that are mentioned here

834
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,380
are not referred to as virtuous women

835
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:48,380
but we find that God will provide us

836
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,380
with the level of influence

837
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:53,380
that they had in the life of Timothy.

838
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:55,380
The Bible says in 2 Timothy chapter one in verse three,

839
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:58,380
I thank God whom I serve from my forefathers

840
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:00,380
with pure conscience that without

841
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:05,020
Without ceasing, I have remembrance of Thee in my prayers night and day, greatly desiring

842
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:09,900
to see Thee, being mindful of Thy tears, that I may be filled with joy.

843
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:15,100
Then notice what Paul says in verse number five, when I call to remembrance the unfeigned

844
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,100
faith that is in Thee.

845
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:23,740
It's a great testimony that Paul has, that Timothy has, that Paul is referring to.

846
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:27,940
That word unfeigned means not to be counterfeit or not to be hypocritical.

847
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:33,980
I could go back to our second point about our testimony, a virtuous woman being identifiable.

848
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:35,620
But notice what Paul says.

849
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:40,900
He says, I'm calling to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in Thee, but then he says this,

850
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:47,500
which first, which dwelt first in Thy grandmother Lois and Thy mother Eunice, and I am persuaded

851
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:51,100
that in Thee also.

852
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:54,580
That from a child Thou hast known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make Thee wise

853
00:40:54,580 --> 00:41:00,260
unto salvation through faith, which is in Christ Jesus.

854
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:03,420
Paul didn't meet Timothy when he was a child and have that influence.

855
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:08,100
No, it was grandmom and mom.

856
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:15,540
It was Lois and Eunice that had the influence in the life of little Timothy.

857
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:21,140
This morning, a virtuous woman is invaluable.

858
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:24,500
Who can find a virtuous woman?

859
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:27,900
Their price is far above Ruby's.

860
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:32,980
A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband.

861
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:35,740
A virtuous woman is identifiable.

862
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:43,020
Boaz says, for all the people of my city doth know that thou art a virtuous woman.

863
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:46,900
A virtuous woman is influential.

864
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:52,460
She has influence, Obed, Jesse, David.

865
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:58,100
We fast forward to the New Testament and we consider Timothy, Lois and Eunice.

866
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:59,100
Listen this morning.

867
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:05,820
I hope that God would give us the opportunity to be used of Him to influence other people

868
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:11,180
for the cause of Christ, that they would set their hope in God, that they would serve God

869
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:19,820
all the days of their lives, that they would see that your testimony, that our testimony

870
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:25,940
is God-honoring, that we're not making decisions that are carnal and fleshly decisions that

871
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:33,500
are tarnishing our testimony, our reputation with others, that are teaching our children

872
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:40,980
something that we do not desire to teach them because the decisions that you make are influencing

873
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:43,320
your children.

874
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:47,340
The decisions that you make reveal to your children how important you think things are

875
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:53,460
in your life and how unimportant things are in your life.

876
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:56,220
This morning, God gives us influence.

877
00:42:56,220 --> 00:43:01,340
I hope that if your wife, you would say, she's a virtuous woman if you're married.

878
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:05,059
I hope this morning if you'd say, my mother, she's a virtuous woman.

879
00:43:05,059 --> 00:43:07,559
You thank God, thank God.

880
00:43:07,559 --> 00:43:14,139
If she's still living, you make sure that you call her, reach out, let her know that

881
00:43:14,139 --> 00:43:17,180
you appreciate her, that you love her.

882
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:25,139
Your blessing to see that on only three occasions God uses this term, a virtuous woman.

883
00:43:25,139 --> 00:43:32,540
He describes one, Ruth, and then he uses her great-great-grandson to pen two verses of

884
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:37,260
Scripture that provide further description of a virtuous woman.

885
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:39,100
I pray that God would help us this morning.

886
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:42,460
You say, I'm not a woman, the message wasn't for me.

887
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:44,300
I'm not a mother, the message wasn't for me.

888
00:43:44,419 --> 00:43:50,660
I hope that you heard all the application throughout for all of us because God has given

889
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:53,700
to all of us a measure of influence.

890
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:54,700
Somebody's watching you.

891
00:43:54,700 --> 00:44:01,580
Can I say, lots of somebodies are watching you and if you have kids, they're very much

892
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:02,580
watching you.

893
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:04,980
They're watching everything you do.

894
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:12,700
I remember years ago reading a little thing that said about a little boy what their aspirations

895
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:13,700
were.

896
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:15,100
He said, I want to be just like my daddy.

897
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:19,100
I remember reading that, being convicted.

898
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:20,100
Why?

899
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:25,860
Because I have a son that watches me.

900
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:28,619
You have children that watch you.

901
00:44:28,619 --> 00:44:35,739
And if your son, my son, our children were just like us, would that be a good thing?

902
00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:37,739
I hope we could say yes.

903
00:44:37,739 --> 00:44:38,739
People are watching us.

904
00:44:38,739 --> 00:44:39,739
Let's pray.

905
00:44:39,739 --> 00:44:41,420
Father, we love you.

906
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:42,700
We thank you for loving us.

907
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:46,660
Thank you, God, for your Word.

908
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:48,779
Thank you for the testimony of Ruth.

909
00:44:48,779 --> 00:44:57,100
God, I pray that you'd help us to have a testimony like Ruth.

910
00:44:57,100 --> 00:45:02,220
Not all of us are women, but all of us have a testimony.

911
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:09,540
God, would you help us to live in such a way that we'd have godly biblical influence in

912
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:14,260
the lives of those that you would allow us to have influence in their lives.

913
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:16,100
Lord, help us.

914
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:23,420
I pray that you would, on this day, help us to honor and to remember our moms.

915
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:26,100
Lord, the blessing.

916
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:30,660
For those that have children, Lord, would you strengthen them this morning?

917
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:39,119
Would you help them to have that reset moment, maybe, refocus on the joy and responsibility

918
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:41,320
that's been entrusted to them?

919
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,679
I know that it's a lot of work.

920
00:45:42,679 --> 00:45:44,000
I know it's hard.

921
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,760
But, God, with your help, we can fulfill what you've called us to do.

922
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:51,800
I pray, God, that you'd have your will and way in the hearts and lives of your people

923
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:52,800
today.

924
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:57,119
If there's one not sure of heaven, God, we earnestly pray that today would be the day

925
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,119
of their salvation.

926
00:45:58,119 --> 00:46:02,360
We pray that you'd move and work as only you can for it's in Christ's name.

927
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:03,360
We pray.

928
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:04,360
Would you stand with me?

929
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:05,360
Heads are bowed.

930
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,360
Eyes are closed.

931
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:08,600
At the end of each of our services, we have an opportunity to have an invitation, give

932
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:09,100
you.
