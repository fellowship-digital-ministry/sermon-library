1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,899
passage of scripture that you would expect

2
00:00:01,899 --> 00:00:04,079
on the Sunday before Christmas.

3
00:00:04,079 --> 00:00:05,719
I do trust that the message, however,

4
00:00:05,719 --> 00:00:09,000
will be a blessing to you as we consider this statement

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,119
that is made by the Lord Jesus Christ

6
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:14,159
in this familiar passage of scripture in John 4,

7
00:00:14,159 --> 00:00:17,959
when Jesus has interaction with the woman at the well.

8
00:00:17,959 --> 00:00:20,959
And we're familiar with that passage in John 4,

9
00:00:20,959 --> 00:00:23,239
and I do trust it'll be a blessing to you.

10
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:26,079
During this time of year, the Christmas season,

11
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:29,260
we understand that it is common in our culture,

12
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:33,700
and in many cultures, for that matter, to exchange gifts.

13
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:38,700
Unfortunately, for some, that has become a primary focus.

14
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,619
And we see that we, of course, live in a society

15
00:00:41,619 --> 00:00:46,380
in which we have just bombarded with advertisements

16
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,459
from really successful marketing,

17
00:00:48,459 --> 00:00:51,380
a successful marketing industry,

18
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,619
and we find that many times they're showing us,

19
00:00:54,619 --> 00:00:56,740
and they're preparing, and they're trying to get you

20
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:00,900
to get this particular gift, and they make you,

21
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,340
after watching all of their advertisements,

22
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,419
think that you simply can't live life

23
00:01:05,419 --> 00:01:07,419
without whatever that item is.

24
00:01:07,419 --> 00:01:09,180
And they're very successful.

25
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,260
You have children that just need this particular item,

26
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,099
whatever the hot item is for any particular year,

27
00:01:16,099 --> 00:01:19,459
and we understand the society in which we live in.

28
00:01:19,459 --> 00:01:21,540
And we find, however, that really,

29
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,739
the holiday that we would celebrate

30
00:01:23,739 --> 00:01:26,220
during this time of year in our society

31
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,860
has really become over-commercialized.

32
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,660
And we find that they estimate, in America,

33
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,459
annually, over the last couple of years,

34
00:01:34,459 --> 00:01:36,660
and expectations for this year,

35
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:41,220
that somewhere between 800 and $900 billion will be spent.

36
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,580
That's a lot of money.

37
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,660
And we understand the hustle and bustle.

38
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,540
We understand people asking us, sometimes strangers,

39
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,900
we don't even know who they are,

40
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,739
and they ask us,

41
00:01:50,739 --> 00:01:52,180
have you finished your Christmas shopping?

42
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,319
Did you get all of your gifts?

43
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:54,160
Are they wrapped?

44
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:54,980
Are they this?

45
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,099
And so on and so forth.

46
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,220
And it's a common thing that we deal with

47
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,300
during this time of year.

48
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,900
It is true, when you read the passage of Scripture

49
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,580
in Matthew chapter number two,

50
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:07,819
that when the wise men worshiped the Lord Jesus Christ,

51
00:02:07,819 --> 00:02:10,539
that they presented unto him gifts.

52
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:13,460
Gold, frankincense, and myrrh.

53
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,500
And we're familiar with that passage of Scripture

54
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,580
in Matthew two.

55
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,139
We do understand, however,

56
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:20,020
that those gifts that were presented

57
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:23,179
were significant and symbolic.

58
00:02:23,179 --> 00:02:25,020
They dealt with the deity of Christ,

59
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,500
the purity of Christ,

60
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,979
and ultimately the death of Christ.

61
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:31,899
And we understand, even as we did not sing it this year,

62
00:02:31,899 --> 00:02:35,100
but a song that is often sang during the Christmas season,

63
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,460
Born to Die.

64
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,800
And we understand that even through the gifts

65
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,759
that were presented,

66
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:43,720
not only showing the deity and purity of Christ,

67
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,220
but the death of the Lord Jesus Christ.

68
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,179
And we know that it's through his death,

69
00:02:48,179 --> 00:02:51,619
his substitutionary atonement on the cross of Calvary,

70
00:02:51,619 --> 00:02:55,339
that we can even have any hope of eternal life.

71
00:02:55,339 --> 00:02:57,619
We understand that he bled and died.

72
00:02:57,619 --> 00:02:59,500
He was buried in that borrowed tomb,

73
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,020
and he rose, conquering sin, death, and the grave.

74
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,619
And how wonderful that is.

75
00:03:04,619 --> 00:03:06,979
As we come to John chapter number four,

76
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:09,500
there's a statement that is made from Jesus

77
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,580
in this interaction.

78
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,940
And we won't look at the entirety of the chapter.

79
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,800
We'll just kind of pick our way through.

80
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,699
But I want you to notice in John four, in verse number four,

81
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:19,820
Jesus says to his disciples,

82
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,220
and we know that they're traveling there,

83
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,699
and the Word of God tells us that it says this,

84
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:28,419
and he must needs go through Samaria.

85
00:03:28,419 --> 00:03:30,100
And it tells us in verse number six,

86
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,699
now Jacob's well was there.

87
00:03:31,699 --> 00:03:34,259
Jesus therefore being wearied with his journey

88
00:03:34,259 --> 00:03:36,139
sat thus on the well,

89
00:03:36,139 --> 00:03:38,419
and it was about the sixth hour.

90
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:41,380
There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water.

91
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,259
Jesus saith unto her,

92
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:46,139
give me to drink.

93
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:49,740
For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.

94
00:03:50,539 --> 00:03:52,660
Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him,

95
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,979
how is it that thou, being a Jew,

96
00:03:55,979 --> 00:03:58,419
askest drink of me?

97
00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:00,580
Which I'm a woman of Samaria.

98
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:04,740
For the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.

99
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,100
But notice here in verse number 10,

100
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:09,860
as Jesus responds to this woman at the well,

101
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,699
he answered and said unto her,

102
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:15,500
if thou knewest the gift of God,

103
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,980
and who it is that saith to thee,

104
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,700
give me to drink,

105
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,420
thou wouldest have asked of him,

106
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:26,820
and he would have given thee living water.

107
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,899
I wanna draw your attention to that phrase

108
00:04:28,899 --> 00:04:30,420
in verse number 10,

109
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:34,899
when Jesus says, if thou knewest the gift of God.

110
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:37,339
If thou knewest the gift of God.

111
00:04:37,339 --> 00:04:39,100
So often we have people today

112
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,339
that are running around buying gifts

113
00:04:41,339 --> 00:04:43,660
and wrapping gifts and presenting gifts,

114
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:46,059
but they do not know of the greatest gift

115
00:04:46,059 --> 00:04:47,500
that's ever been given.

116
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,540
And here as Jesus is interacting

117
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,100
with this woman at the well,

118
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:54,859
he says, if thou knewest the gift of God,

119
00:04:54,859 --> 00:04:56,820
and who it is that saith to thee,

120
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,260
he is Messiah, he is Christ,

121
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,660
he is the God in flesh,

122
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,500
and he's having this interaction

123
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,859
with this woman at the well.

124
00:05:04,859 --> 00:05:06,380
We'll read some of it as we continue

125
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,899
through the message this morning.

126
00:05:07,899 --> 00:05:10,459
But he says that if you knew the gift of God,

127
00:05:10,459 --> 00:05:12,459
and you knew who it was that saith to thee,

128
00:05:12,459 --> 00:05:13,619
give me to drink,

129
00:05:13,619 --> 00:05:16,540
thou wouldest have asked of him,

130
00:05:16,579 --> 00:05:21,019
and he would have given thee living water.

131
00:05:21,019 --> 00:05:23,779
New life through Christ.

132
00:05:23,779 --> 00:05:25,980
And we understand and we'll use as our title

133
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,140
for the message this morning,

134
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:30,420
if thou knewest the gift of God.

135
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,579
As you study the Scriptures,

136
00:05:31,579 --> 00:05:33,980
you'll find that in Romans chapter number six

137
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,500
and verse number 23,

138
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,380
the Word of God describes the gift of God this way.

139
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,940
In Romans six and verse number 23,

140
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:45,420
it begins on really a negative note if you will,

141
00:05:45,459 --> 00:05:48,859
but it's a note that is necessary nonetheless.

142
00:05:48,859 --> 00:05:51,339
The Bible says in Romans six and verse number 23,

143
00:05:51,339 --> 00:05:54,980
for the wages of sin is death.

144
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,619
And we understand that to be the case.

145
00:05:56,619 --> 00:05:59,140
We understand the Bible tells us in Romans three

146
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,260
that there's none that doeth good.

147
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,140
We understand the Bible tells us

148
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,859
that all of our good works in the book of Isaiah

149
00:06:05,859 --> 00:06:07,220
are as filthy rags.

150
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:11,299
And we understand that the wages of sin is death.

151
00:06:11,299 --> 00:06:13,700
All men are sinners.

152
00:06:13,739 --> 00:06:15,579
The penalty for sin is death,

153
00:06:15,579 --> 00:06:18,100
but you notice the great conjunction

154
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,380
in Romans six and verse number 23,

155
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,220
the Bible says,

156
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:26,220
but the gift of God is eternal life

157
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:31,779
through Jesus Christ, our Lord.

158
00:06:31,779 --> 00:06:35,820
I want you to consider the statement in John four

159
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,220
in verse number 10,

160
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,700
when Jesus says to the woman at the well,

161
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,980
if thou knewest the gift of God.

162
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:46,579
And we understand here in Romans six in verse number 23,

163
00:06:46,579 --> 00:06:48,260
when the word of God tells us

164
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:53,059
that the gift of God is eternal life

165
00:06:53,059 --> 00:06:55,899
through Jesus Christ, our Lord.

166
00:06:55,899 --> 00:06:56,779
I want you this morning,

167
00:06:56,779 --> 00:06:57,660
if you're taking notes,

168
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:01,380
first of all, to consider His gift to me.

169
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,019
Consider His gift to me.

170
00:07:03,019 --> 00:07:05,019
And I'm so thankful for the gift of God,

171
00:07:05,019 --> 00:07:08,100
which is eternal life through Jesus Christ, our Lord.

172
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,820
I'm thankful this morning to know

173
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,760
that my sins have been forgiven,

174
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,320
not by anything that I've done,

175
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,279
but all because of what Jesus Christ did

176
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:16,760
on the cross of Calvary.

177
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,160
And because of His substitutionary atonement,

178
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,399
because of His glorious resurrection,

179
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,440
we can stand redeemed,

180
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,600
understanding that we've been forgiven,

181
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,200
that we have been the recipients of the gift of God,

182
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,839
which is eternal life.

183
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:33,959
This morning, when I consider the gift of God,

184
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:36,079
and I consider His gift to me,

185
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:37,559
I would say this morning

186
00:07:37,559 --> 00:07:40,600
that His gift is truly the greatest gift.

187
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,000
It is the perfect gift.

188
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,399
So many people run around in this society

189
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,640
in the hustle and bustle,

190
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,619
and you get emails just like I do.

191
00:07:49,619 --> 00:07:50,880
You only have so many days,

192
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,299
and you missed the shipping window,

193
00:07:52,299 --> 00:07:54,040
and you got a this, and so on and so forth,

194
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,399
and people are looking for that perfect gift.

195
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:59,480
And all the while, they're ignorant,

196
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,260
they're unaware of the gift of God.

197
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,160
They're not knowing this morning

198
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,220
the subject matter in which we're dealing with.

199
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,500
They're not confident in their eternal security,

200
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,459
because they don't know the gift of God.

201
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:15,220
They're like that woman at the well

202
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,500
that came to simply draw water

203
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,339
and had no idea that she was gonna meet Jesus

204
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:22,339
on that particular day.

205
00:08:22,339 --> 00:08:25,119
And Jesus said, if thou knewest the gift of God.

206
00:08:25,119 --> 00:08:28,899
Let me give you some truth about this gift of God.

207
00:08:28,899 --> 00:08:33,219
I would say this, His gift to me is beyond description.

208
00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:34,380
You ever receive a gift,

209
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,500
and you try to describe it to someone,

210
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,820
and you try to explain it,

211
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,500
and perhaps in our society today,

212
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,059
we understand with advancements in technology

213
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:43,739
that we just can FaceTime people,

214
00:08:43,739 --> 00:08:45,659
and we can video message people,

215
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:47,820
and we can show them, and we can let them see it,

216
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:48,700
and so on and so forth.

217
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,179
But if you would entertain me just for a few moments,

218
00:08:51,179 --> 00:08:54,619
when I was a kid, that technology didn't exist.

219
00:08:54,619 --> 00:08:56,260
Yes, I'm not that old,

220
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,380
but the technology didn't exist, amen?

221
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,400
And I remember as a child,

222
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,099
I remember getting on the phone

223
00:09:02,099 --> 00:09:04,140
with my grandparents on Christmas Day,

224
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,140
and I remember having conversations with them,

225
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,179
and something that they would commonly ask

226
00:09:09,179 --> 00:09:11,539
on Christmas morning would be this question,

227
00:09:11,539 --> 00:09:13,859
what did you get for Christmas?

228
00:09:13,859 --> 00:09:16,619
And you understand that for many of those years,

229
00:09:16,619 --> 00:09:19,859
I was not saved, and I did not know the gift of God

230
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:21,599
that we're speaking about this morning.

231
00:09:21,599 --> 00:09:24,979
My grandparents were lost, I was lost, my family was lost.

232
00:09:24,979 --> 00:09:27,859
We didn't know anything about the gift of God.

233
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:29,219
We didn't understand the truth

234
00:09:29,219 --> 00:09:30,780
that we're dealing with this morning.

235
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,500
And I remember trying as a young child

236
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:38,539
to describe the gift that I received to my grandparents.

237
00:09:38,659 --> 00:09:39,820
And I would try to describe it.

238
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:43,340
Well, the gift of God is beyond description.

239
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,359
The reality is that the Bible tells us,

240
00:09:45,359 --> 00:09:47,020
if you turn over to the book of 2 Corinthians

241
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,380
in chapter number nine,

242
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,780
and we'll look at this verse a couple of times this morning,

243
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:53,260
in fact, it's a simple verse of Scripture,

244
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,700
but I want you to think about what the Word of God says

245
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,780
when we consider the description,

246
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:00,299
and the fact that His gift to me is beyond.

247
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:05,559
description. The Bible says this in 2nd Corinthians 9 and verse number 15,

248
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:14,439
thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift. As much as we try to describe the

249
00:10:14,439 --> 00:10:20,039
gift of God which is eternal life, as much as we try to exalt the Lord Jesus

250
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:24,519
Christ through understanding this gift, the reality is that we do not have a

251
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:29,999
full comprehension of all that is contained within this gift of God which

252
00:10:29,999 --> 00:10:35,479
is eternal life. It's a precious gift. And we think about the the truth in

253
00:10:35,479 --> 00:10:42,879
2nd Corinthians 9 for his unspeakable gift. If I could begin to describe to you

254
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:47,039
this gift of God which is eternal life, and I know that I'm speaking to many

255
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:50,579
that have received Christ as their Savior this morning, but as we would

256
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:55,399
begin to describe that gift of God that he has given me eternal life, but we

257
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:58,919
understand that it's it's so much more than just eternal life. I mean he's

258
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:03,679
given us abundant life, he's given us all things that pertain unto life and

259
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:07,759
godliness, he's blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places,

260
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:12,679
he's given us promises that are precious, and he promises to be with us and to

261
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:18,399
guide us and lead us. It's amazing. He said I'm your shepherd. You think about

262
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,839
the truth of Psalm 23 and you do not have to take the time to turn there, but

263
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:27,879
it's an amazing truth where the psalmist ends that psalm by saying surely goodness

264
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:33,639
and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house

265
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:39,359
of the Lord forever. I want you to understand this morning that the truth

266
00:11:39,359 --> 00:11:44,439
of the last statement of the 23rd Psalm is directly related to the first

267
00:11:44,439 --> 00:11:49,199
statement of the 23rd Psalm. He cannot have the confidence that he will dwell

268
00:11:49,199 --> 00:11:54,919
in the house of the Lord forever if first the Lord is not my shepherd. But

269
00:11:54,919 --> 00:12:01,479
because the Lord is my shepherd, because I understand who he is to me, I can say I

270
00:12:01,479 --> 00:12:07,119
will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. Oh this gift of God is precious.

271
00:12:07,119 --> 00:12:12,519
I understand it's beyond description, the gift was purchased with the precious

272
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:18,799
blood of Jesus Christ. If you purchase a gift, you have to pay for that gift, right?

273
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:22,199
That's how it works. You don't just go to the clerk at the store and say well my

274
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:27,199
kid really wants this. All right, I mean that's fine, it's X number of dollars and

275
00:12:27,199 --> 00:12:31,319
you say well I don't have that. Well you can't have the item. I mean we understand

276
00:12:31,319 --> 00:12:37,479
that, it's real simple. In this gift that God has for me, his gift for me, when he

277
00:12:37,479 --> 00:12:42,439
says to the woman at the well, if thou knewest the gift of God, we understand

278
00:12:42,439 --> 00:12:47,239
that this gift that he speaks of, this gift of eternal life, it was purchased

279
00:12:47,359 --> 00:12:54,039
with his own precious blood. The value is beyond anything that we could even begin

280
00:12:54,039 --> 00:13:00,759
to consider. In fact, when you consider this morning the truth of 1 Peter, take a

281
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:06,479
moment and turn to 1 Peter chapter number 1, we understand here that God

282
00:13:06,479 --> 00:13:13,399
gives us great truth with regard to the price for our salvation, the price for

283
00:13:13,439 --> 00:13:18,959
this gift that has been provided. And you understand that as we consider his gift

284
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:24,239
to me this morning and we understand what blessed truth it is that he would

285
00:13:24,239 --> 00:13:28,839
pay for that gift with his precious blood. Let me say this, he didn't simply

286
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:33,519
make a down payment for the gift. He paid for it in full. Aren't you thankful for

287
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,479
that? I remember back in the day, I don't even know if they still have it today, lay

288
00:13:37,479 --> 00:13:41,839
away, but I remember back in the day my grandmother on my mom's side, she would

289
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,599
like to shop at Kmart and Kmart had blue light specials and they also had lay

290
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:50,079
away. Some of you say, I don't even know what Kmart is. It's okay. And it's

291
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,679
Walmart but really bad. That's the best way I could describe it. That's why

292
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:58,559
they don't exist anymore. But the reality is that I remember my grandmother putting

293
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:03,439
things on lay away. Some of you remember lay away, some of you have no

294
00:14:03,439 --> 00:14:07,679
idea what we're talking about, but stick with me just for a moment. It's my

295
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:10,959
understanding I've never personally put anything on lay away, but I was with my

296
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:15,439
grandmother when she did on a number of occasions. Dad, didn't she like Kmart and

297
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:20,959
lay away? Man, she loved it. I'm being serious. And she'd go in there and guess

298
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,559
what? When she put those items in there, she'd have put some kind of down payment.

299
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:31,679
Right? But she couldn't take the items. They kept the items. Right? That's how it

300
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:36,440
worked. And then you'd go back and you make another payment. And you go back and

301
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:40,199
you make another payment and eventually, you guys don't know about lay away? Mike

302
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:47,319
and Elizabeth, you can't be that young. They're sitting here going, what? You guys

303
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:52,599
know about lay away? Some of you know about lay away. Come on. Amen? Come on. I'm

304
00:14:52,599 --> 00:15:02,639
not that old. Good night. Eventually, you paid off and then you get to take the

305
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:10,639
product. God didn't just make a down payment for your salvation. He paid for

306
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:17,279
it all. Amen? He says here in 1 Peter 1 in verse 17,

307
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:21,639
and if you call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth

308
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:26,359
according to every man's work, past the time of your sojourning here in fear, for

309
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:32,000
as much as you know, that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things as

310
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,679
silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from

311
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:42,079
your fathers. Now, we understand that he says, listen, the redemption that we enjoy

312
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:46,479
being saved, having this gift of God which is eternal life, it wasn't paid for

313
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:55,159
with silver and gold. Notice verse 19, but with the precious blood of Christ as of a

314
00:15:55,159 --> 00:16:00,519
lamb without blemish and without spot, who verily was for ordained before the

315
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:05,679
foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you, who by him

316
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:10,159
do believe in God that raised him up from the dead and gave him glory that

317
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:17,279
your faith and hope might be in God. We're redeemed with the precious blood

318
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:24,159
of Christ, the price, the price that was paid. Listen, you cannot buy the gift of

319
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:30,319
God. It's already been bought by him with his blood. And we understand this

320
00:16:30,319 --> 00:16:35,399
morning that this gift that we're speaking of, his gift to me, this gift of

321
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:39,399
eternal life, that it's beyond description. It says, but thanks be to God

322
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:44,079
for his unspeakable gift. We think about his gift being purchased with the

323
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:49,279
precious blood of Christ that we're redeemed, that we're forgiven through the

324
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:55,599
blood. The Old Testament, the types all throughout the Old Testament of

325
00:16:55,599 --> 00:17:00,720
the blood, of the blood, of the blood. You go to the tabernacle and you find that

326
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,720
as soon as you would enter into the tabernacle, and there's only one way to

327
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,559
enter into the tabernacle, and the first piece of furniture that you'd come to is

328
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:12,879
the brazen altar. Why? Because a sacrifice was required. Blood had to be

329
00:17:12,879 --> 00:17:17,639
shed. You find that if you go prior to that and you begin to look all the way

330
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:23,000
back into the garden, you understand that after sin entered into the world, after

331
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,559
Adam and Eve sinned and their eyes were opened, what's the first thing that they

332
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:32,199
did? They recognized that they were naked and they put fig leaves to try to cover

333
00:17:32,199 --> 00:17:39,039
their nakedness. Correct? What did God say? It's not satisfactory. That's not

334
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:44,639
sufficient. And therefore an animal had to be killed. I would argue a lamb had to

335
00:17:44,639 --> 00:17:51,879
be killed so that coats of skin could be provided for Adam and Eve while showing

336
00:17:51,879 --> 00:17:58,519
them that the blood was required. The works of your hands are not sufficient,

337
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:05,399
but the blood is required. And from that point all the way through, you find how

338
00:18:05,399 --> 00:18:10,479
that it was a picture. You notice with the offerings of Cain and Abel, you

339
00:18:10,479 --> 00:18:17,839
notice with the truth of Abraham and others, with believing God and the

340
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:25,479
truth of the Passover and the blood and how it all pointed to Messiah. And now

341
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:32,599
He's come and He paid. He went to that cross. He shed His precious blood. That's

342
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:45,519
how our gift was paid for. He says in John, it is finished. It's paid for, paid

343
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:54,239
in full. The gift, not only the unspeakable gift, not only that it's been purchased

344
00:18:54,239 --> 00:18:58,399
with His precious blood, but I want you to consider this this morning, His gift is

345
00:18:58,399 --> 00:19:05,080
available to all. His gift is available to all. We're living in a time right now

346
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,880
where they're talking about supply chain issues, right? We've been hearing about

347
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,880
it for a long time in the news and trying to get you to go spend your money

348
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:16,320
now so that you can get whatever that item is because the supply chain issues

349
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,399
and it's not going to be available and so on and so forth. And whatever those

350
00:19:19,399 --> 00:19:23,919
hot items are that are the most popular gifts of the year, you can find that

351
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:28,000
sometimes they're just not available. There are times in which you can't find

352
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,640
that gift that Johnny or Susie really wants and as a parent you so desire

353
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,320
perhaps to be able to get that gift for them, but it's just simply not available, out

354
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:43,719
of stock, coming soon. I want you to understand that this gift that we're

355
00:19:43,719 --> 00:19:47,399
speaking of this morning, when Jesus says to the woman at the well, if thou

356
00:19:47,399 --> 00:19:52,519
knewest the gift of God, this gift is available to all. It's available to every

357
00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:57,440
single person. The Bible tells us in Romans 1 and verse number 16, when Paul

358
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:02,640
is declaring this great truth, he says

359
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,120
I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ.

360
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,120
Why?

361
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:09,760
For it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth, to the Jew first

362
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,440
and also to the Greek."

363
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:18,600
We understand that the Word of God teaches us in Romans 10 in verse number 13, for whosoever

364
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:25,080
shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

365
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:29,960
In 2 Peter chapter number 3, the Bible tells us that our God is not willing that any should

366
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:34,080
perish, but that all should come to repentance.

367
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:39,200
When He went to that cruel cross, see, He was born to die, and we think about gifts

368
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:44,840
and exchanging of gifts, but the greatest gift, the most perfect gift, is this gift

369
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,640
of God, which is eternal life.

370
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:54,480
And Jesus says to the woman at the well, if thou knewest the gift of God, if you knew

371
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,480
it.

372
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:00,360
You've got to understand that in John chapter 4, if you've held your place there, or if

373
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,880
not, turn back there and notice what is happening here.

374
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:08,400
It says here, when we think about this truth of it being available, understand that in

375
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,960
verse number 9, there's some input that is given how that she says that she's a woman

376
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,960
of Samaria and that the Jews and the Samaritans, they have no dealings one with another.

377
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:23,840
There was great prejudice and there was great length of effort that would go forth by a

378
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:29,840
Jewish person to avoid Samaria, to avoid this region, to go around this region.

379
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:35,000
There was no dealings with one another, but Jesus, the Bible says He must needs go through

380
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Samaria.

381
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,120
And we find that when He says to her, if thou knewest the gift of God, notice in verse number

382
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:46,200
10 again, and who it is that saith to thee, give me to drink, thou wouldest have asked

383
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,440
of Him.

384
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,800
And what does it say?

385
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:54,120
And He would have given thee living water.

386
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:58,720
It's not that you ask and He says, I'm sorry, it's not for you.

387
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,040
That'd be tragic.

388
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,260
But the gift is available.

389
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,880
The gift is available to all people.

390
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,600
And for that, we rejoice.

391
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:13,640
This gift that we're speaking of this morning, you understand that you cannot buy this gift.

392
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,640
There's no place that you can go to buy this gift.

393
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,920
There's no work that you can do.

394
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,560
There's no sum of money that you can give.

395
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:23,680
There's nothing that you can do to earn this gift.

396
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,720
You can't buy it.

397
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,440
You can't earn it.

398
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,000
You can't work for it.

399
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
There's just nothing.

400
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,560
You must simply receive this gift.

401
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:41,360
In fact, many today in our society have been led astray into thinking by many of the world

402
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,080
religions that you can work your way to heaven.

403
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:51,040
In fact, many of the world religions today would teach that you just need to do certain

404
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:56,920
works and do certain things, and by that you will earn your salvation.

405
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:02,240
In fact, as we interact with people, as we go throughout our days, our weeks, and we

406
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,960
speak to people about the Lord, and we are to ask people, I've done this on a number

407
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:10,560
of occasions in my life, when I've said to someone, sir, ma'am, are you sure of heaven?

408
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:14,880
If you were to die today, would you go to heaven?

409
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,000
Sometimes people would say, no way.

410
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,440
Other times people say, absolutely, I've trust that Christ is my Savior.

411
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,240
Many times, however, people say, I hope so.

412
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,240
I want to.

413
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,920
What are you basing it on?

414
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,680
Well, I'm being the best person I can be.

415
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,320
I'm doing the best I can do.

416
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,360
Can I tell you, that's not good enough.

417
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:40,080
Again, I referenced Isaiah earlier, but all of our good works are as filthy rags as what

418
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,960
Isaiah says.

419
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:47,520
In Romans chapter number four, the Bible speaks to us about this very truth with regard to

420
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,960
this gift, and I'm so thankful that it's a gift.

421
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,480
I cannot work for it.

422
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,880
I cannot earn it.

423
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:57,000
I must simply receive it.

424
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,160
It says, what shall we say then that Abraham, our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath

425
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,160
found?

426
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:10,240
For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory, but not before God.

427
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,840
If you think about this truth in verse number two, when it says, he hath whereof to glory,

428
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:18,400
remember the truth of Ephesians 2, 8, 9, for by grace are you saved through faith, and

429
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:24,640
that not of yourselves is the gift of God, not of works, lest any man should boast.

430
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:29,760
If we could work our way to heaven, then it would give us reason to glory, reason to boast.

431
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:34,600
But God says no, what saith the Scripture in verse number three, for what saith the

432
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:39,840
Scripture, Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.

433
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:45,160
Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt, but our God

434
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,440
is a debtor to no man.

435
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,600
Amen?

436
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,880
We cannot earn this gift.

437
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,680
We must simply receive this gift.

438
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:59,320
So this morning, I would simply ask this question as we consider His gift to me, have you received

439
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,880
the gift?

440
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:06,280
Have you personally understood that you are a sinner and that Christ is the only Savior?

441
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:10,800
Have you understood this truth that is being revealed to us this morning through John 4,

442
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:17,400
that God has a gift for us and that this gift is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

443
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:21,160
It's a precious gift that was paid for with His blood.

444
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,880
There's nothing you can do to earn it.

445
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,900
It's available to all people.

446
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,280
You must simply receive it.

447
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,960
The question this morning is, have you received the gift of God?

448
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,160
Have you been born again?

449
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,520
Have you trusted Christ as your Savior?

450
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,520
Can I tell you this?

451
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,640
He won't force you to receive the gift.

452
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:42,600
In fact, you can reject the gift.

453
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:47,840
I used to be able to say that I've never had anyone reject a gift that I tried to give

454
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:54,080
them, but just recently I had someone reject a gift.

455
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:59,080
And you wouldn't know who they are, and it was just a token of appreciation.

456
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:04,280
I was trying to be a kind individual, and I extended a gift to someone, and it really

457
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,400
wasn't anything of any great monetary value.

458
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:12,280
It was just a small token of appreciation.

459
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:15,680
Within just a few minutes, the person said, I don't want this.

460
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,360
I can't take this.

461
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,280
And they gave it back to me.

462
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:24,880
Until that event, just recently, I'd never had anyone reject a gift that I tried to give

463
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,880
them.

464
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,760
It's pretty customary that we receive a gift.

465
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,440
And God says, I have a gift for you.

466
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,560
Will you receive it?

467
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,320
Or will you reject it?

468
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:39,700
Now this morning, I know that I'm talking to many that have already received the gift.

469
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:45,280
And we know this gift of God that is spoken of in John chapter number 4.

470
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:49,880
And this morning when we speak about this idea when he says, if thou knewest the gift

471
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:55,400
of God and I consider his gift to me, I want you to consider number 2 this morning, I

472
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:59,880
want you to consider my gift to him.

473
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,600
What's my gift to him?

474
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:09,360
And understand, when I deal with this truth this morning, my gift to him is not to try

475
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,000
to get his gift to me.

476
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,240
My gift to him is not to try to keep his gift that he's given me.

477
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:23,120
My gift to him is out of gratitude for what he's done for me.

478
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:27,280
And we understand that as we go through the Scriptures that there is a response that we

479
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:32,640
find littered throughout the New Testament, the Old Testament as well, how that the people

480
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:38,800
of God as they've received this gift, how they respond by thanking God, by praising

481
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:43,280
God, by living for God, because they understand this gift.

482
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,720
I've said this before from this pulpit.

483
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:50,480
The reality is that if we could lose the gift, if we could lose the salvation, we would

484
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:55,680
have lost it the day we got it.

485
00:27:55,680 --> 00:28:00,040
I know, there's no way I can keep it the same way I can't earn it.

486
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,040
Amen?

487
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:05,040
I'm kept by the power of God.

488
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,520
But what's my gift back to him?

489
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,840
Number 1, I would say this, it's my praise.

490
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,040
My praise.

491
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,400
Is he not worthy of our praise?

492
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:19,440
When we understand the gift that he's given to us, when we understand this gift of God,

493
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,680
which is eternal life, we ought to lift our voice and praise him and thank him.

494
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:28,480
2 Corinthians 9 and verse 15 said, but thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift.

495
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,760
I'm thanking him and I'm praising him.

496
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,760
Why?

497
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,240
Because I understand that he's given me this gift.

498
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:40,440
I couldn't earn it, I couldn't work for it, I'm without hope, I'm dead in my sins and

499
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,440
my trespasses.

500
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:47,480
I am hopeless and I am helpless, but God in his grace and his mercy, he says, I have a

501
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,400
gift for you.

502
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,600
And what's my gift back to him?

503
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,600
I praise him.

504
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,160
I praise him.

505
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,160
Consider Hebrews 13.

506
00:28:54,160 --> 00:29:00,200
Turn over there if you will and consider Hebrews 13 and what the word of God says with regard

507
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,040
to our praise for our God.

508
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:07,960
We of course could go to the book of Psalms and we could read many passages of Scripture

509
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:11,960
in the book of Psalms with regard to our praise and lifting our voice and praising

510
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:15,799
our God and the fact that he is worthy of our praise.

511
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:21,440
And here in Hebrews 13 and verse number 15, the Bible speaks here about the praise of

512
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,440
his people.

513
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:28,760
By him, therefore, let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God.

514
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,559
How often?

515
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,160
Continually.

516
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:39,000
That is the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name.

517
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,679
He is worthy of our praise.

518
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:47,359
And this morning, when I praise my God, I'm lifting him up, I'm exalting him, I'm magnifying

519
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:48,359
him.

520
00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:49,480
Let God be magnified.

521
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,160
Let God be exalted.

522
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,520
And I'm speaking about his gift.

523
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:59,520
Remember there's not a place for us to glory or for us to boast because it's not by works,

524
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,660
it's not by our merit.

525
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:02,940
It's all because of his glory.

526
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:07,620
grace and His mercy, and so therefore He alone is the one that receives the glory.

527
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:12,240
He alone is the one that receives the praise. When someone were to ask me the

528
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,420
question, are you sure of heaven, it's not in any glory in myself that I say, yep, I

529
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:19,900
know I'm going to heaven because I've done this and I'm this and so on and so

530
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:24,100
forth. No, I know I'm going to heaven because Jesus Christ died for me. He

531
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:29,300
paid my debt. He was buried and He rose again. He conquered sin, death, and the

532
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:34,700
grave, and He saved my soul, and I want to praise Him. I want to lift up my voice

533
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:42,780
and give thanks to God for His gift. Is it not customary in our society to thank

534
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:53,000
people for gifts? You receive a gift, someone says thank you, right? Sometimes

535
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,740
we give a gift to someone and we receive a thank-you card. Do you give a thank-you

536
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:04,540
card for the thank-you card? I mean, no, it's not customary, but you understand

537
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:10,700
what I'm saying, right? We understand what it is to express gratitude for a gift.

538
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:17,900
Well, if this greatest gift, this gift of God, which is eternal life, has been

539
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:22,980
freely given to us and we've understood, listen, I'm thankful that I do not live

540
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:26,700
in a place, I'm thankful that I've been exposed to the truth of the gospel, that

541
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:30,740
I know the gift of God, and for you this morning that are under the sound of my

542
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:34,380
voice, whether you're here locally or you're watching via live stream, you now

543
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:39,779
know the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. You may

544
00:31:39,779 --> 00:31:43,779
have entered into this building, you may have clicked on that link on the

545
00:31:43,779 --> 00:31:48,020
internet, and you may not have known what the gift of God is in this

546
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:54,740
sense, and understanding what the Scripture said, but now you know. And as

547
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:58,580
we receive that gift and we say, I no longer I'm gonna try to work for this

548
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:04,060
thing because I understand that I can't, He gives us a rest in our salvation, and

549
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:09,340
it's a blessed thing, and we ought to lift our voice and praise Him. And as we

550
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:13,460
praise Him and as we lift Him up and exalt Him and we speak of our Savior,

551
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:19,180
we're influencing others. Let me say this, not only my gift to Him is my praise, but

552
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:26,139
it's my life. It's my life. I'm mindful of the truth of Romans 12, and it's a

553
00:32:26,139 --> 00:32:29,940
familiar verse of Scripture, really two verses of Scripture, Romans 12 verses 1

554
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:33,979
and 2. Many of us are familiar with this passage of Scripture. If you were to take

555
00:32:33,979 --> 00:32:38,380
the whole of the book of Romans and really just divide it up into a few

556
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:43,660
sections and understand the indictment against mankind that all have sinned and

557
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:49,100
come short of the glory of God. There's none righteous, no not one. We find

558
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:53,059
those truths in the book of Romans in the third chapter. If you're to look in

559
00:32:53,059 --> 00:32:58,100
the fifth chapter and understand that sin entered into this world by one man,

560
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:03,260
by Adam, and sin has passed upon all men, death has passed upon all men, excuse me,

561
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:09,979
for all have sinned. We look at the truth of Romans 5 that by one man's

562
00:33:09,979 --> 00:33:14,979
transgression all have been influenced, but by the gift of one, speaking of the

563
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:20,940
price that was paid on the cross of Calvary by the Lord Jesus Christ, all men

564
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:26,699
now freely can receive this gift. Romans 6, we looked at verse 23 earlier, the

565
00:33:26,699 --> 00:33:31,540
wages of sin is death, the gift of God is eternal life. Romans 10, for whosoever

566
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:36,580
shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. So we understand our

567
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:39,940
condition that we were hopeless and helpless for all have sinned and come

568
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:43,740
short of the glory of God. There's none righteous, no not one, but we understand

569
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:47,860
that Jesus died for us and he paid the price for us so that we could have

570
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:52,540
eternal life. We've accepted him, we've called upon him, we've received this

571
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:57,660
gift, and now we come to Romans 12 and Paul says, I beseech you therefore,

572
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:04,260
brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice,

573
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:10,779
wholly acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. Be not conformed to

574
00:34:10,779 --> 00:34:14,500
this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may

575
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:20,619
prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God. I said often a

576
00:34:20,619 --> 00:34:24,140
couple of years ago we preached through the book of Ephesians on Sunday morning.

577
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:30,500
The theme is somewhat evident in the book of Colossians as well. We speak

578
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:34,179
about in the book of Ephesians, there's very clear distinction in that book

579
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:38,500
between the first section and the second section. In the first section of the book

580
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:43,820
of Ephesians, it specifically is dealing with our standing before God, the fact

581
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:46,700
that we've been saved, that we've received this gift that I'm speaking of

582
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:52,820
this morning. The second section of the book of Ephesians clearly deals with our

583
00:34:52,820 --> 00:35:01,380
service for our Lord. Because I'm saved, I walk in wisdom, I walk in truth, and all

584
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:05,220
of these truths that are given to us at the latter part of the book of

585
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:11,260
Ephesians. And we understand, and I said this often, that I do not, that the truth

586
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:16,940
of Ephesians is not that Paul is saying, walk in wisdom or walk worthy so that

587
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:21,179
you can get saved or so that you can stay saved. No, the matter of salvation

588
00:35:21,179 --> 00:35:27,940
has already been established. Our standing is already sure, and because of

589
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:35,899
that, I now serve my God. I offer to him my praise, but I offer to him my life.

590
00:35:35,899 --> 00:35:40,739
Remember the truth. Turn over. I sign every card that I sign. 2 Corinthians

591
00:35:40,739 --> 00:35:45,500
chapter number 5, in verse number 15, if you've received a card, a letter, an email

592
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:50,500
from me, you see 2 Corinthians 5.15 in my signature every time I write

593
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:56,339
something. And in 2 Corinthians chapter number 5, in verse number 14, the Bible

594
00:35:56,339 --> 00:35:59,700
says that the love of Christ constraineth us, because we thus judge

595
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:04,860
that if one died for all, then we're all dead. And notice verse number 15, in that

596
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:11,339
he died for all. Remember, we said the gift is available. It's available to all.

597
00:36:11,339 --> 00:36:17,299
He died for all, that they which live, I've been saved, I've been born again, it

598
00:36:17,299 --> 00:36:22,700
says that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto

599
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:28,700
him which died for them and rose again. We sing the song, Living for Jesus. You

600
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:34,260
know, if you're not saved, you can't live for Jesus. You can't. But because I've

601
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:39,220
been saved, I want to offer him my life. Paul says, this is your reasonable service,

602
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:44,059
that we present our bodies a living sacrifice. Again, it's not so that we can

603
00:36:44,059 --> 00:36:48,820
be saved, it's not so that we can stay saved, it's the result of us being saved

604
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:54,779
and understanding this gift that we have received. What glory, what blessing. I

605
00:36:54,779 --> 00:37:01,940
would say this as we turn back to John chapter number 4, nearing the end of the

606
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:06,820
thought this morning, and as we turn back to John chapter number 4, and I think

607
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:11,059
about my praise in my life, and I notice in this text of Scripture that both of

608
00:37:11,059 --> 00:37:17,619
those things are evident in this life of this woman that is mentioned here by her

609
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:24,660
witness, when I know the gift of God, I must share this gift with others. When I

610
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:28,220
truly understand, remember, he says in verse number 10, the beginning of their

611
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:33,820
interaction, if thou knewest the gift of God. The reality is that at this point,

612
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:40,500
she didn't know the gift of God, correct? She didn't know it, but it's about to be

613
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:46,500
revealed to her. She didn't know what the gift was. He said, if you knew what it was,

614
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:50,700
you would have asked me, and I would have given to thee living water. The woman

615
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:55,860
saith, in verse number 11, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with. The well is deep.

616
00:37:55,860 --> 00:38:01,619
From whence then hast thou that living water? And art thou greater than our

617
00:38:01,619 --> 00:38:08,100
father Jacob? Yes, absolutely, he is God. Which gave us the well, and drank there

618
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:11,619
of himself, and his children, and his cattle. Jesus answered and said unto her,

619
00:38:11,619 --> 00:38:15,980
whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again. Did she understand that?

620
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:20,420
Yeah, that's why she was there that day. She needed more water. Notice verse

621
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:26,019
number 14, but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never

622
00:38:26,019 --> 00:38:30,140
thirst, but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water

623
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:34,860
springing up into everlasting life. He's speaking about that living water that he

624
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:38,900
mentioned in verse number 10. He's speaking about salvation, and of course

625
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:44,340
her response immediately in verse number 15, Sir, give me this water that I thirst

626
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:49,059
not, neither come hither to draw. She didn't fully understand the gift yet. She

627
00:38:49,059 --> 00:38:53,299
was still thinking on the natural plane. She was still thinking physically. She

628
00:38:53,299 --> 00:38:58,580
was not understanding the spiritual truth that God was giving her, this gift

629
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:03,140
of God as eternal life, as we found in Romans 6, and she says, listen, I don't

630
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:06,979
want to have to keep coming back to this well. She's thinking on that physical

631
00:39:06,979 --> 00:39:12,820
plane. Notice Jesus, in order to help her understand her sinful condition, her

632
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:17,580
need for this spiritual water, this living water that he's speaking of, he

633
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:21,419
says in verse number 16, go call thy husband and come hither. The woman

634
00:39:21,419 --> 00:39:25,080
answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, thou hast well said, I have

635
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:29,739
no husband, for thou hast had five husbands, and he whom thou now hast is

636
00:39:29,739 --> 00:39:36,780
not thy husband, and that sayest thou truly. Notice her response, Sir, I perceive

637
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:46,220
that thou art a prophet. He's greater than a prophet. He's God. He's God. She

638
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:50,020
says, our fathers worshiped in this mountain, and ye say that in Jerusalem is

639
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:54,820
the place where men ought to worship. Jesus saith unto her, woman, believe

640
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:59,739
me, the hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem

641
00:39:59,739 --> 00:40:04,700
worship the Father. Ye worship, ye know not. What?

642
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:09,100
know what we worship, notice this, for salvation is of the Jews. What does he mean by that?

643
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:13,900
It was through the, of course we understand through the messianic prophecies, we've been

644
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:19,500
studying the book of Genesis, and as God called Abraham and the Jewish nation, the Hebrew

645
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:27,500
nation, that Christ would come through that line, and we understand that salvation is

646
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:32,300
of the Jews. But the hour cometh, verse 23, and now is when the true worshippers shall

647
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:37,500
worship the Father in spirit and in truth, for the Father seeketh such to worship him.

648
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:42,060
God is a spirit. They that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. Notice

649
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:47,700
what she says. It's, now she's understanding the gift of God. Because it says in verse

650
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:54,420
number 25, the woman saith unto him, I know that Messiah is cometh, which is called Christ.

651
00:40:54,420 --> 00:41:01,540
When he is come, he will tell us all things. And Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto

652
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:12,300
thee am he. Wow. Wow. She's met Messiah. Jesus must needs go through Samaria, and

653
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:19,300
we find that, she says, that as he's dealing with her and drilling down and dealing with

654
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:24,940
the spiritual issues at hand, she says, I know that Messiah is cometh, which is called

655
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:33,220
Christ. And he says, I am he. I that speak unto thee am he.

656
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:37,380
The disciples return. Remember back in verse number 8, they tell us that the disciples

657
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:40,740
were gone away into the city to buy meat, and so Jesus is there with this woman. The

658
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:46,060
disciples are off running some errands, if you will, getting the supplies that were needed.

659
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:50,780
The Bible tells us that they marveled that he talked to the woman in verse number 27.

660
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:54,740
But I want you to notice in verse 28 that the woman then left her water pot and went

661
00:41:54,740 --> 00:42:01,060
her way into the city, and saith to the men, Come, see a man which told me all things that

662
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:10,980
ever I did. Is not this the Christ? She now understands this gift. Not only does she understand

663
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:16,500
the gift, but she wants to share the gift. Isn't that natural?

664
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:21,500
This morning, for many of us, I started the message by saying, what's his gift to me?

665
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:24,260
What would I consider his gift to me? And we considered it, and we looked at a number

666
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:28,820
of truths within the Word of God, and for many of us this morning, we can say, I received

667
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:36,220
that gift. But here, when this woman that in the beginning of the passage did not know

668
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:42,380
the gift of God, if thou knewest the gift of God, she didn't know it, now as her eyes

669
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:49,060
have been opened, as Jesus deals with her, she now has her eyes opened, and she says,

670
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:57,220
Is not this the Christ? We find that she goes back and she tells them, and it says, as you

671
00:42:57,220 --> 00:43:07,300
look and skip down in verse number 39, and many of the Samaritans of the city believed

672
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:13,660
on him for the saying of the woman, which testified he told me all that ever I did.

673
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:17,500
So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with

674
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:23,060
them, and he abode there two days. So notice the scene, she leaves from getting water,

675
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:28,220
and she runs back to the city, and she tells these people, she announces this experience

676
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:32,820
that she's had, and this interaction that she's had with Christ, with the Messiah, and

677
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:36,860
the Bible tells us that many of the Samaritans believed on him for the saying of the woman,

678
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:42,340
according to verse number 39, and then a great multitude come to him, he mentions about that,

679
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:48,340
in verses 34 through 37, about the multitude that were coming, and he says that as they come,

680
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:52,860
they ask him, they beseech him, that he would tarry there, and he stayed there for two days.

681
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:59,980
And I want you to notice verses 41 and 42. It says that many more believed because of his own word,

682
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:06,460
and said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying, for we have heard him

683
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:15,820
ourselves, and know that this indeed is indeed the Christ, the Savior of the world. We sang this

684
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:23,059
morning, joy to the world, the Savior is come. He has come. And as we understand this gift of God,

685
00:44:23,059 --> 00:44:29,300
Galatians chapter number 4, you don't need to turn there, but in Galatians 4, in verse number 4,

686
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:35,700
the Bible says, when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman,

687
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:42,380
made under the law. What was the purpose of sending his Son? To redeem them that were under

688
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:49,100
the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons. How did he redeem us? Through his substitutionary

689
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:55,460
atonement. The gift of God that we're speaking of this morning, this gift that's been made

690
00:44:55,460 --> 00:45:01,620
available to us, and as we understand this gift, and as we've received this gift, then we ought to

691
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:09,860
have the desire to give him our praise, to give him our life, to lift up our voice and testify of

692
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:22,180
him. In John chapter number 1, John the Baptist is preaching, and the Lord Jesus Christ walks by,

693
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:29,380
and John the Baptist says, behold the Lamb of God. The Bible tells us that a couple of those

694
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:35,059
two disciples of John the Baptist, they followed after Jesus, and Jesus said, what seek ye? And

695
00:45:35,059 --> 00:45:44,059
they say, where dwellest thou? And he said, come and see. And the Bible says that in verse number

696
00:45:44,059 --> 00:45:48,540
40, one of the two which heard John speak and followed him was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.

697
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:55,620
He first findeth his own brother Simon and saith unto him, we have found the Messiah, which is

698
00:45:55,620 --> 00:46:01,260
being interpreted, the Christ. And I want you to notice this phrase in verse number 42, and he

699
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:13,860
brought him to Jesus. This morning, if thou knewest the gift of God, we consider his gift to us, it's

700
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:20,020
eternal life. This morning, if you've not received the gift of eternal life, I would say to you this

701
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:27,340
morning, would you receive the gift of God? It's available. He's paid for it. He makes it available

702
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:37,700
to all people. Today is the day of salvation. Today is the day of salvation. We know not what's

703
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:42,740
on the morrow, according to Proverbs 27. What is your life? It's a vapor that appeareth for a little

704
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:48,580
time and then vanisheth away. And this morning, if you're not sure of heaven, if you've not received

705
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:54,660
the gift of God, which is eternal life, this Christmas season, why don't you receive the

706
00:46:54,660 --> 00:47:04,820
greatest gift, the perfect gift, the gift of God, which is eternal life. This morning, if you've

707
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:11,700
already received that gift, what's our gift in return to him? How are we praising him? Are we

708
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:18,580
lifting his name? Are we exalting him the way that we should? Have we given him our lives? Not

709
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:23,340
to earn our salvation, not to keep it. We can't earn it or keep it. But because of what he's done

710
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:31,100
for us, have we offered him our lives? How's our testimony? Who are we bringing to Jesus? Who are

711
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:39,020
we saying, let me tell you about this gift, this gift of God. Let me tell you what he did for you,

712
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:44,460
or what he did for me and what he can do for you. Let me tell you how he changed my life

713
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:51,820
and how he can change your life too, if thou knewest the gift of God. Maybe this morning,

714
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:57,980
someone entered into this meeting place not knowing the gift of God, but now you know it.

715
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:05,660
Would you receive it? It's available. He's already paid for it. You say, what do I have to do? Just

716
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:13,340
receive it. Just receive it. I hope that you wouldn't reject it because God loves you so much

717
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:18,460
and he wants you to be saved. Let's pray together. Father, we love you.

718
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:23,180
We thank you for loving us. We thank you for the Word of God.

719
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:32,380
We're thankful that you sent your son, the Lord Jesus Christ, born of a virgin.

720
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:42,780
We're thankful that you sent your son to this world, to this sin-cursed world,

721
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:50,220
so he could live a sinless, perfect life, so he could make the atonement for our sin,

722
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:58,700
pay the price so that we could be redeemed. We're thankful this morning for this unspeakable gift.

723
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:06,380
That this gift has been paid for, paid in full, with the precious blood of Jesus Christ, proven

724
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:14,540
through his glorious resurrection. I'm thankful that it's available. Lord,

725
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:21,500
if there'd be one this morning, maybe there's several. Here locally, tuned in via live stream,

726
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:27,820
they entered this meeting time the same way that that woman at the well, not knowing the gift of

727
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:33,260
God. He said, if you knew it, you'd ask for it and I'd give it to you.

728
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:37,739
This morning, he is the Savior of the world.

729
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:46,220
He's my Savior. He wants to be your Savior. If you're not sure of heaven this morning,

730
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:47,900
Lord, would you work with the Holy Spirit,

731
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:54,700
convict and convince of sin and of Christ's righteousness and of judgment to come?

732
00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:00,540
For those that have already received the gift of God this morning,

733
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:04,540
would you help us to live for Jesus? Help us to live for you.

734
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:06,240
You.

735
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,280
Help us to praise You.

736
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:12,240
Help us to surrender our lives.

737
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:17,880
Help us to testify and bring others to Jesus, because we understand this wonderful gift

738
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:23,240
and we want the world to know that Jesus saves.

739
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:28,080
We pray that You'd move work as only You can in this time of invitation.

740
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:31,880
We'll give You the honor and glory for all that You'll do, for it's in Christ's name

741
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:32,880
we pray.

742
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:33,880
Would You stand with me?

743
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:36,160
God, eyes are closed.

744
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:41,600
The conclusion of our services, we have a time of invitation.

745
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:45,560
We invite you to respond to the preaching of the Word of God.

746
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:51,040
As the Holy Spirit of God has moved in your heart and your life, we ask that you'd respond.

747
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:55,240
No one's looking around, we'd never embarrass you.

748
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:58,800
Kimberly will play quietly on the piano, and as she does, the altar's open.

749
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:02,040
If you're not sure of heaven, we'd love to take a Bible and show you how you can know

750
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,680
for sure that heaven's your home.

751
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:11,680
If you want to just come and thank Him for this unspeakable gift, perhaps you just want

752
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:18,000
to praise His name and offer your life to Him, or bring others to Jesus.

753
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,040
However it is that the Lord may have spoken to your heart this morning, the altar is open

754
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:22,200
as Kimberly plays.
