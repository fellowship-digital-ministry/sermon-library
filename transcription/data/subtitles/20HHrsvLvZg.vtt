00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.899
passage of scripture that you would expect

00:00:01.899 --> 00:00:04.079
on the Sunday before Christmas.

00:00:04.079 --> 00:00:05.719
I do trust that the message, however,

00:00:05.719 --> 00:00:09.000
will be a blessing to you as we consider this statement

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.119
that is made by the Lord Jesus Christ

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:14.159
in this familiar passage of scripture in John 4,

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:17.959
when Jesus has interaction with the woman at the well.

00:00:17.959 --> 00:00:20.959
And we're familiar with that passage in John 4,

00:00:20.959 --> 00:00:23.239
and I do trust it'll be a blessing to you.

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:26.079
During this time of year, the Christmas season,

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:29.260
we understand that it is common in our culture,

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.700
and in many cultures, for that matter, to exchange gifts.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.700
Unfortunately, for some, that has become a primary focus.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.619
And we see that we, of course, live in a society

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:46.380
in which we have just bombarded with advertisements

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.459
from really successful marketing,

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:51.380
a successful marketing industry,

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.619
and we find that many times they're showing us,

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:56.740
and they're preparing, and they're trying to get you

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.900
to get this particular gift, and they make you,

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.340
after watching all of their advertisements,

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.419
think that you simply can't live life

00:01:05.419 --> 00:01:07.419
without whatever that item is.

00:01:07.419 --> 00:01:09.180
And they're very successful.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.260
You have children that just need this particular item,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.099
whatever the hot item is for any particular year,

00:01:16.099 --> 00:01:19.459
and we understand the society in which we live in.

00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:21.540
And we find, however, that really,

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.739
the holiday that we would celebrate

00:01:23.739 --> 00:01:26.220
during this time of year in our society

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.860
has really become over-commercialized.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.660
And we find that they estimate, in America,

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.459
annually, over the last couple of years,

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:36.660
and expectations for this year,

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:41.220
that somewhere between 800 and $900 billion will be spent.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.580
That's a lot of money.

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.660
And we understand the hustle and bustle.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.540
We understand people asking us, sometimes strangers,

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.900
we don't even know who they are,

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:50.739
and they ask us,

00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:52.180
have you finished your Christmas shopping?

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.319
Did you get all of your gifts?

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:54.160
Are they wrapped?

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.980
Are they this?

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.099
And so on and so forth.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.220
And it's a common thing that we deal with

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.300
during this time of year.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.900
It is true, when you read the passage of Scripture

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.580
in Matthew chapter number two,

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.819
that when the wise men worshiped the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:10.539
that they presented unto him gifts.

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.460
Gold, frankincense, and myrrh.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.500
And we're familiar with that passage of Scripture

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.580
in Matthew two.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.139
We do understand, however,

00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:20.020
that those gifts that were presented

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.179
were significant and symbolic.

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:25.020
They dealt with the deity of Christ,

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.500
the purity of Christ,

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.979
and ultimately the death of Christ.

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:31.899
And we understand, even as we did not sing it this year,

00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:35.100
but a song that is often sang during the Christmas season,

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.460
Born to Die.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.800
And we understand that even through the gifts

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:40.759
that were presented,

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:43.720
not only showing the deity and purity of Christ,

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.220
but the death of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.179
And we know that it's through his death,

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:51.619
his substitutionary atonement on the cross of Calvary,

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:55.339
that we can even have any hope of eternal life.

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:57.619
We understand that he bled and died.

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:59.500
He was buried in that borrowed tomb,

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.020
and he rose, conquering sin, death, and the grave.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.619
And how wonderful that is.

00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:06.979
As we come to John chapter number four,

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:09.500
there's a statement that is made from Jesus

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.580
in this interaction.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.940
And we won't look at the entirety of the chapter.

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.800
We'll just kind of pick our way through.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.699
But I want you to notice in John four, in verse number four,

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:19.820
Jesus says to his disciples,

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.220
and we know that they're traveling there,

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.699
and the Word of God tells us that it says this,

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:28.419
and he must needs go through Samaria.

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:30.100
And it tells us in verse number six,

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.699
now Jacob's well was there.

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:34.259
Jesus therefore being wearied with his journey

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:36.139
sat thus on the well,

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:38.419
and it was about the sixth hour.

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:41.380
There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.259
Jesus saith unto her,

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:46.139
give me to drink.

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:49.740
For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:52.660
Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him,

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.979
how is it that thou, being a Jew,

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:58.419
askest drink of me?

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:00.580
Which I'm a woman of Samaria.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.740
For the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:06.100
But notice here in verse number 10,

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.860
as Jesus responds to this woman at the well,

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.699
he answered and said unto her,

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:15.500
if thou knewest the gift of God,

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.980
and who it is that saith to thee,

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.700
give me to drink,

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.420
thou wouldest have asked of him,

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.820
and he would have given thee living water.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.899
I wanna draw your attention to that phrase

00:04:28.899 --> 00:04:30.420
in verse number 10,

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:34.899
when Jesus says, if thou knewest the gift of God.

00:04:34.899 --> 00:04:37.339
If thou knewest the gift of God.

00:04:37.339 --> 00:04:39.100
So often we have people today

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.339
that are running around buying gifts

00:04:41.339 --> 00:04:43.660
and wrapping gifts and presenting gifts,

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.059
but they do not know of the greatest gift

00:04:46.059 --> 00:04:47.500
that's ever been given.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.540
And here as Jesus is interacting

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.100
with this woman at the well,

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.859
he says, if thou knewest the gift of God,

00:04:54.859 --> 00:04:56.820
and who it is that saith to thee,

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.260
he is Messiah, he is Christ,

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.660
he is the God in flesh,

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.500
and he's having this interaction

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:04.859
with this woman at the well.

00:05:04.859 --> 00:05:06.380
We'll read some of it as we continue

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:07.899
through the message this morning.

00:05:07.899 --> 00:05:10.459
But he says that if you knew the gift of God,

00:05:10.459 --> 00:05:12.459
and you knew who it was that saith to thee,

00:05:12.459 --> 00:05:13.619
give me to drink,

00:05:13.619 --> 00:05:16.540
thou wouldest have asked of him,

00:05:16.579 --> 00:05:21.019
and he would have given thee living water.

00:05:21.019 --> 00:05:23.779
New life through Christ.

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:25.980
And we understand and we'll use as our title

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:27.140
for the message this morning,

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:30.420
if thou knewest the gift of God.

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:31.579
As you study the Scriptures,

00:05:31.579 --> 00:05:33.980
you'll find that in Romans chapter number six

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:35.500
and verse number 23,

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.380
the Word of God describes the gift of God this way.

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.940
In Romans six and verse number 23,

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.420
it begins on really a negative note if you will,

00:05:45.459 --> 00:05:48.859
but it's a note that is necessary nonetheless.

00:05:48.859 --> 00:05:51.339
The Bible says in Romans six and verse number 23,

00:05:51.339 --> 00:05:54.980
for the wages of sin is death.

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:56.619
And we understand that to be the case.

00:05:56.619 --> 00:05:59.140
We understand the Bible tells us in Romans three

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:01.260
that there's none that doeth good.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.140
We understand the Bible tells us

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.859
that all of our good works in the book of Isaiah

00:06:05.859 --> 00:06:07.220
are as filthy rags.

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:11.299
And we understand that the wages of sin is death.

00:06:11.299 --> 00:06:13.700
All men are sinners.

00:06:13.739 --> 00:06:15.579
The penalty for sin is death,

00:06:15.579 --> 00:06:18.100
but you notice the great conjunction

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.380
in Romans six and verse number 23,

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.220
the Bible says,

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:26.220
but the gift of God is eternal life

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:31.779
through Jesus Christ, our Lord.

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:35.820
I want you to consider the statement in John four

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:37.220
in verse number 10,

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.700
when Jesus says to the woman at the well,

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.980
if thou knewest the gift of God.

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:46.579
And we understand here in Romans six in verse number 23,

00:06:46.579 --> 00:06:48.260
when the word of God tells us

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:53.059
that the gift of God is eternal life

00:06:53.059 --> 00:06:55.899
through Jesus Christ, our Lord.

00:06:55.899 --> 00:06:56.779
I want you this morning,

00:06:56.779 --> 00:06:57.660
if you're taking notes,

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:01.380
first of all, to consider His gift to me.

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:03.019
Consider His gift to me.

00:07:03.019 --> 00:07:05.019
And I'm so thankful for the gift of God,

00:07:05.019 --> 00:07:08.100
which is eternal life through Jesus Christ, our Lord.

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:09.820
I'm thankful this morning to know

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:11.760
that my sins have been forgiven,

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.320
not by anything that I've done,

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.279
but all because of what Jesus Christ did

00:07:15.279 --> 00:07:16.760
on the cross of Calvary.

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:19.160
And because of His substitutionary atonement,

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.399
because of His glorious resurrection,

00:07:21.399 --> 00:07:23.440
we can stand redeemed,

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.600
understanding that we've been forgiven,

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:29.200
that we have been the recipients of the gift of God,

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.839
which is eternal life.

00:07:30.839 --> 00:07:33.959
This morning, when I consider the gift of God,

00:07:33.959 --> 00:07:36.079
and I consider His gift to me,

00:07:36.079 --> 00:07:37.559
I would say this morning

00:07:37.559 --> 00:07:40.600
that His gift is truly the greatest gift.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.000
It is the perfect gift.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.399
So many people run around in this society

00:07:46.399 --> 00:07:47.640
in the hustle and bustle,

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:49.619
and you get emails just like I do.

00:07:49.619 --> 00:07:50.880
You only have so many days,

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.299
and you missed the shipping window,

00:07:52.299 --> 00:07:54.040
and you got a this, and so on and so forth,

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:57.399
and people are looking for that perfect gift.

00:07:57.399 --> 00:07:59.480
And all the while, they're ignorant,

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.260
they're unaware of the gift of God.

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.160
They're not knowing this morning

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.220
the subject matter in which we're dealing with.

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:11.500
They're not confident in their eternal security,

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:13.459
because they don't know the gift of God.

00:08:13.459 --> 00:08:15.220
They're like that woman at the well

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:17.500
that came to simply draw water

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:20.339
and had no idea that she was gonna meet Jesus

00:08:20.339 --> 00:08:22.339
on that particular day.

00:08:22.339 --> 00:08:25.119
And Jesus said, if thou knewest the gift of God.

00:08:25.119 --> 00:08:28.899
Let me give you some truth about this gift of God.

00:08:28.899 --> 00:08:33.219
I would say this, His gift to me is beyond description.

00:08:33.219 --> 00:08:34.380
You ever receive a gift,

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:36.500
and you try to describe it to someone,

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:37.820
and you try to explain it,

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:39.500
and perhaps in our society today,

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.059
we understand with advancements in technology

00:08:42.059 --> 00:08:43.739
that we just can FaceTime people,

00:08:43.739 --> 00:08:45.659
and we can video message people,

00:08:45.659 --> 00:08:47.820
and we can show them, and we can let them see it,

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:48.700
and so on and so forth.

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:51.179
But if you would entertain me just for a few moments,

00:08:51.179 --> 00:08:54.619
when I was a kid, that technology didn't exist.

00:08:54.619 --> 00:08:56.260
Yes, I'm not that old,

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.380
but the technology didn't exist, amen?

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:00.400
And I remember as a child,

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.099
I remember getting on the phone

00:09:02.099 --> 00:09:04.140
with my grandparents on Christmas Day,

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:07.140
and I remember having conversations with them,

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.179
and something that they would commonly ask

00:09:09.179 --> 00:09:11.539
on Christmas morning would be this question,

00:09:11.539 --> 00:09:13.859
what did you get for Christmas?

00:09:13.859 --> 00:09:16.619
And you understand that for many of those years,

00:09:16.619 --> 00:09:19.859
I was not saved, and I did not know the gift of God

00:09:19.859 --> 00:09:21.599
that we're speaking about this morning.

00:09:21.599 --> 00:09:24.979
My grandparents were lost, I was lost, my family was lost.

00:09:24.979 --> 00:09:27.859
We didn't know anything about the gift of God.

00:09:27.859 --> 00:09:29.219
We didn't understand the truth

00:09:29.219 --> 00:09:30.780
that we're dealing with this morning.

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:33.500
And I remember trying as a young child

00:09:33.539 --> 00:09:38.539
to describe the gift that I received to my grandparents.

00:09:38.659 --> 00:09:39.820
And I would try to describe it.

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:43.340
Well, the gift of God is beyond description.

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:45.359
The reality is that the Bible tells us,

00:09:45.359 --> 00:09:47.020
if you turn over to the book of 2 Corinthians

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:48.380
in chapter number nine,

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:50.780
and we'll look at this verse a couple of times this morning,

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:53.260
in fact, it's a simple verse of Scripture,

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.700
but I want you to think about what the Word of God says

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:57.780
when we consider the description,

00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:00.299
and the fact that His gift to me is beyond.

00:10:00.299 --> 00:10:05.559
description. The Bible says this in 2nd Corinthians 9 and verse number 15,

00:10:05.559 --> 00:10:14.439
thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift. As much as we try to describe the

00:10:14.439 --> 00:10:20.039
gift of God which is eternal life, as much as we try to exalt the Lord Jesus

00:10:20.039 --> 00:10:24.519
Christ through understanding this gift, the reality is that we do not have a

00:10:24.519 --> 00:10:29.999
full comprehension of all that is contained within this gift of God which

00:10:29.999 --> 00:10:35.479
is eternal life. It's a precious gift. And we think about the the truth in

00:10:35.479 --> 00:10:42.879
2nd Corinthians 9 for his unspeakable gift. If I could begin to describe to you

00:10:42.879 --> 00:10:47.039
this gift of God which is eternal life, and I know that I'm speaking to many

00:10:47.039 --> 00:10:50.579
that have received Christ as their Savior this morning, but as we would

00:10:50.579 --> 00:10:55.399
begin to describe that gift of God that he has given me eternal life, but we

00:10:55.399 --> 00:10:58.919
understand that it's it's so much more than just eternal life. I mean he's

00:10:58.919 --> 00:11:03.679
given us abundant life, he's given us all things that pertain unto life and

00:11:03.679 --> 00:11:07.759
godliness, he's blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places,

00:11:07.759 --> 00:11:12.679
he's given us promises that are precious, and he promises to be with us and to

00:11:12.679 --> 00:11:18.399
guide us and lead us. It's amazing. He said I'm your shepherd. You think about

00:11:18.399 --> 00:11:22.839
the truth of Psalm 23 and you do not have to take the time to turn there, but

00:11:22.839 --> 00:11:27.879
it's an amazing truth where the psalmist ends that psalm by saying surely goodness

00:11:27.879 --> 00:11:33.639
and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house

00:11:33.639 --> 00:11:39.359
of the Lord forever. I want you to understand this morning that the truth

00:11:39.359 --> 00:11:44.439
of the last statement of the 23rd Psalm is directly related to the first

00:11:44.439 --> 00:11:49.199
statement of the 23rd Psalm. He cannot have the confidence that he will dwell

00:11:49.199 --> 00:11:54.919
in the house of the Lord forever if first the Lord is not my shepherd. But

00:11:54.919 --> 00:12:01.479
because the Lord is my shepherd, because I understand who he is to me, I can say I

00:12:01.479 --> 00:12:07.119
will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. Oh this gift of God is precious.

00:12:07.119 --> 00:12:12.519
I understand it's beyond description, the gift was purchased with the precious

00:12:12.519 --> 00:12:18.799
blood of Jesus Christ. If you purchase a gift, you have to pay for that gift, right?

00:12:18.799 --> 00:12:22.199
That's how it works. You don't just go to the clerk at the store and say well my

00:12:22.199 --> 00:12:27.199
kid really wants this. All right, I mean that's fine, it's X number of dollars and

00:12:27.199 --> 00:12:31.319
you say well I don't have that. Well you can't have the item. I mean we understand

00:12:31.319 --> 00:12:37.479
that, it's real simple. In this gift that God has for me, his gift for me, when he

00:12:37.479 --> 00:12:42.439
says to the woman at the well, if thou knewest the gift of God, we understand

00:12:42.439 --> 00:12:47.239
that this gift that he speaks of, this gift of eternal life, it was purchased

00:12:47.359 --> 00:12:54.039
with his own precious blood. The value is beyond anything that we could even begin

00:12:54.039 --> 00:13:00.759
to consider. In fact, when you consider this morning the truth of 1 Peter, take a

00:13:00.759 --> 00:13:06.479
moment and turn to 1 Peter chapter number 1, we understand here that God

00:13:06.479 --> 00:13:13.399
gives us great truth with regard to the price for our salvation, the price for

00:13:13.439 --> 00:13:18.959
this gift that has been provided. And you understand that as we consider his gift

00:13:18.959 --> 00:13:24.239
to me this morning and we understand what blessed truth it is that he would

00:13:24.239 --> 00:13:28.839
pay for that gift with his precious blood. Let me say this, he didn't simply

00:13:28.839 --> 00:13:33.519
make a down payment for the gift. He paid for it in full. Aren't you thankful for

00:13:33.519 --> 00:13:37.479
that? I remember back in the day, I don't even know if they still have it today, lay

00:13:37.479 --> 00:13:41.839
away, but I remember back in the day my grandmother on my mom's side, she would

00:13:41.839 --> 00:13:45.599
like to shop at Kmart and Kmart had blue light specials and they also had lay

00:13:45.599 --> 00:13:50.079
away. Some of you say, I don't even know what Kmart is. It's okay. And it's

00:13:50.079 --> 00:13:53.679
Walmart but really bad. That's the best way I could describe it. That's why

00:13:53.679 --> 00:13:58.559
they don't exist anymore. But the reality is that I remember my grandmother putting

00:13:58.559 --> 00:14:03.439
things on lay away. Some of you remember lay away, some of you have no

00:14:03.439 --> 00:14:07.679
idea what we're talking about, but stick with me just for a moment. It's my

00:14:07.679 --> 00:14:10.959
understanding I've never personally put anything on lay away, but I was with my

00:14:10.959 --> 00:14:15.439
grandmother when she did on a number of occasions. Dad, didn't she like Kmart and

00:14:15.439 --> 00:14:20.959
lay away? Man, she loved it. I'm being serious. And she'd go in there and guess

00:14:20.959 --> 00:14:24.559
what? When she put those items in there, she'd have put some kind of down payment.

00:14:24.559 --> 00:14:31.679
Right? But she couldn't take the items. They kept the items. Right? That's how it

00:14:31.679 --> 00:14:36.440
worked. And then you'd go back and you make another payment. And you go back and

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:40.199
you make another payment and eventually, you guys don't know about lay away? Mike

00:14:40.199 --> 00:14:47.319
and Elizabeth, you can't be that young. They're sitting here going, what? You guys

00:14:47.319 --> 00:14:52.599
know about lay away? Some of you know about lay away. Come on. Amen? Come on. I'm

00:14:52.599 --> 00:15:02.639
not that old. Good night. Eventually, you paid off and then you get to take the

00:15:02.639 --> 00:15:10.639
product. God didn't just make a down payment for your salvation. He paid for

00:15:10.639 --> 00:15:17.279
it all. Amen? He says here in 1 Peter 1 in verse 17,

00:15:17.279 --> 00:15:21.639
and if you call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth

00:15:21.639 --> 00:15:26.359
according to every man's work, past the time of your sojourning here in fear, for

00:15:26.359 --> 00:15:32.000
as much as you know, that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things as

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.679
silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from

00:15:37.679 --> 00:15:42.079
your fathers. Now, we understand that he says, listen, the redemption that we enjoy

00:15:42.079 --> 00:15:46.479
being saved, having this gift of God which is eternal life, it wasn't paid for

00:15:46.479 --> 00:15:55.159
with silver and gold. Notice verse 19, but with the precious blood of Christ as of a

00:15:55.159 --> 00:16:00.519
lamb without blemish and without spot, who verily was for ordained before the

00:16:00.519 --> 00:16:05.679
foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you, who by him

00:16:05.679 --> 00:16:10.159
do believe in God that raised him up from the dead and gave him glory that

00:16:10.159 --> 00:16:17.279
your faith and hope might be in God. We're redeemed with the precious blood

00:16:17.279 --> 00:16:24.159
of Christ, the price, the price that was paid. Listen, you cannot buy the gift of

00:16:24.159 --> 00:16:30.319
God. It's already been bought by him with his blood. And we understand this

00:16:30.319 --> 00:16:35.399
morning that this gift that we're speaking of, his gift to me, this gift of

00:16:35.399 --> 00:16:39.399
eternal life, that it's beyond description. It says, but thanks be to God

00:16:39.399 --> 00:16:44.079
for his unspeakable gift. We think about his gift being purchased with the

00:16:44.079 --> 00:16:49.279
precious blood of Christ that we're redeemed, that we're forgiven through the

00:16:49.279 --> 00:16:55.599
blood. The Old Testament, the types all throughout the Old Testament of

00:16:55.599 --> 00:17:00.720
the blood, of the blood, of the blood. You go to the tabernacle and you find that

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:03.720
as soon as you would enter into the tabernacle, and there's only one way to

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:07.559
enter into the tabernacle, and the first piece of furniture that you'd come to is

00:17:07.559 --> 00:17:12.879
the brazen altar. Why? Because a sacrifice was required. Blood had to be

00:17:12.879 --> 00:17:17.639
shed. You find that if you go prior to that and you begin to look all the way

00:17:17.799 --> 00:17:23.000
back into the garden, you understand that after sin entered into the world, after

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.559
Adam and Eve sinned and their eyes were opened, what's the first thing that they

00:17:27.559 --> 00:17:32.199
did? They recognized that they were naked and they put fig leaves to try to cover

00:17:32.199 --> 00:17:39.039
their nakedness. Correct? What did God say? It's not satisfactory. That's not

00:17:39.039 --> 00:17:44.639
sufficient. And therefore an animal had to be killed. I would argue a lamb had to

00:17:44.639 --> 00:17:51.879
be killed so that coats of skin could be provided for Adam and Eve while showing

00:17:51.879 --> 00:17:58.519
them that the blood was required. The works of your hands are not sufficient,

00:17:58.519 --> 00:18:05.399
but the blood is required. And from that point all the way through, you find how

00:18:05.399 --> 00:18:10.479
that it was a picture. You notice with the offerings of Cain and Abel, you

00:18:10.479 --> 00:18:17.839
notice with the truth of Abraham and others, with believing God and the

00:18:17.839 --> 00:18:25.479
truth of the Passover and the blood and how it all pointed to Messiah. And now

00:18:25.479 --> 00:18:32.599
He's come and He paid. He went to that cross. He shed His precious blood. That's

00:18:33.159 --> 00:18:45.519
how our gift was paid for. He says in John, it is finished. It's paid for, paid

00:18:45.519 --> 00:18:54.239
in full. The gift, not only the unspeakable gift, not only that it's been purchased

00:18:54.239 --> 00:18:58.399
with His precious blood, but I want you to consider this this morning, His gift is

00:18:58.399 --> 00:19:05.080
available to all. His gift is available to all. We're living in a time right now

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:07.880
where they're talking about supply chain issues, right? We've been hearing about

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:11.880
it for a long time in the news and trying to get you to go spend your money

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:16.320
now so that you can get whatever that item is because the supply chain issues

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:19.399
and it's not going to be available and so on and so forth. And whatever those

00:19:19.399 --> 00:19:23.919
hot items are that are the most popular gifts of the year, you can find that

00:19:23.919 --> 00:19:28.000
sometimes they're just not available. There are times in which you can't find

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.640
that gift that Johnny or Susie really wants and as a parent you so desire

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:37.320
perhaps to be able to get that gift for them, but it's just simply not available, out

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:43.719
of stock, coming soon. I want you to understand that this gift that we're

00:19:43.719 --> 00:19:47.399
speaking of this morning, when Jesus says to the woman at the well, if thou

00:19:47.399 --> 00:19:52.519
knewest the gift of God, this gift is available to all. It's available to every

00:19:52.519 --> 00:19:57.440
single person. The Bible tells us in Romans 1 and verse number 16, when Paul

00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:02.640
is declaring this great truth, he says

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:05.120
I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ.

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:06.120
Why?

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:09.760
For it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth, to the Jew first

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:12.440
and also to the Greek."

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:18.600
We understand that the Word of God teaches us in Romans 10 in verse number 13, for whosoever

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:25.080
shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:29.960
In 2 Peter chapter number 3, the Bible tells us that our God is not willing that any should

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:34.080
perish, but that all should come to repentance.

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:39.200
When He went to that cruel cross, see, He was born to die, and we think about gifts

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:44.840
and exchanging of gifts, but the greatest gift, the most perfect gift, is this gift

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:47.640
of God, which is eternal life.

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:54.480
And Jesus says to the woman at the well, if thou knewest the gift of God, if you knew

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:55.480
it.

00:20:55.480 --> 00:21:00.360
You've got to understand that in John chapter 4, if you've held your place there, or if

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:03.880
not, turn back there and notice what is happening here.

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:08.400
It says here, when we think about this truth of it being available, understand that in

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:12.960
verse number 9, there's some input that is given how that she says that she's a woman

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:16.960
of Samaria and that the Jews and the Samaritans, they have no dealings one with another.

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:23.840
There was great prejudice and there was great length of effort that would go forth by a

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:29.840
Jewish person to avoid Samaria, to avoid this region, to go around this region.

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:35.000
There was no dealings with one another, but Jesus, the Bible says He must needs go through

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.000
Samaria.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:41.120
And we find that when He says to her, if thou knewest the gift of God, notice in verse number

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:46.200
10 again, and who it is that saith to thee, give me to drink, thou wouldest have asked

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:47.440
of Him.

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:48.800
And what does it say?

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:54.120
And He would have given thee living water.

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:58.720
It's not that you ask and He says, I'm sorry, it's not for you.

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:02.040
That'd be tragic.

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:04.260
But the gift is available.

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:06.880
The gift is available to all people.

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:08.600
And for that, we rejoice.

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:13.640
This gift that we're speaking of this morning, you understand that you cannot buy this gift.

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:16.640
There's no place that you can go to buy this gift.

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:17.920
There's no work that you can do.

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:19.560
There's no sum of money that you can give.

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:23.680
There's nothing that you can do to earn this gift.

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:24.720
You can't buy it.

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:26.440
You can't earn it.

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:29.000
You can't work for it.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.000
There's just nothing.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.560
You must simply receive this gift.

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:41.360
In fact, many today in our society have been led astray into thinking by many of the world

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:45.080
religions that you can work your way to heaven.

00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:51.040
In fact, many of the world religions today would teach that you just need to do certain

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:56.920
works and do certain things, and by that you will earn your salvation.

00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:02.240
In fact, as we interact with people, as we go throughout our days, our weeks, and we

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:05.960
speak to people about the Lord, and we are to ask people, I've done this on a number

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:10.560
of occasions in my life, when I've said to someone, sir, ma'am, are you sure of heaven?

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:14.880
If you were to die today, would you go to heaven?

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:17.000
Sometimes people would say, no way.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.440
Other times people say, absolutely, I've trust that Christ is my Savior.

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:24.240
Many times, however, people say, I hope so.

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:25.240
I want to.

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:27.920
What are you basing it on?

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:30.680
Well, I'm being the best person I can be.

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:32.320
I'm doing the best I can do.

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:35.360
Can I tell you, that's not good enough.

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:40.080
Again, I referenced Isaiah earlier, but all of our good works are as filthy rags as what

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:41.960
Isaiah says.

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:47.520
In Romans chapter number four, the Bible speaks to us about this very truth with regard to

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:50.960
this gift, and I'm so thankful that it's a gift.

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:52.480
I cannot work for it.

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:53.880
I cannot earn it.

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:57.000
I must simply receive it.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:02.160
It says, what shall we say then that Abraham, our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:03.160
found?

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:10.240
For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory, but not before God.

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:14.840
If you think about this truth in verse number two, when it says, he hath whereof to glory,

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:18.400
remember the truth of Ephesians 2, 8, 9, for by grace are you saved through faith, and

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:24.640
that not of yourselves is the gift of God, not of works, lest any man should boast.

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:29.760
If we could work our way to heaven, then it would give us reason to glory, reason to boast.

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:34.600
But God says no, what saith the Scripture in verse number three, for what saith the

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:39.840
Scripture, Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:45.160
Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt, but our God

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:47.440
is a debtor to no man.

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:48.600
Amen?

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:50.880
We cannot earn this gift.

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:53.680
We must simply receive this gift.

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:59.320
So this morning, I would simply ask this question as we consider His gift to me, have you received

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:00.880
the gift?

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:06.280
Have you personally understood that you are a sinner and that Christ is the only Savior?

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:10.800
Have you understood this truth that is being revealed to us this morning through John 4,

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:17.400
that God has a gift for us and that this gift is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:21.160
It's a precious gift that was paid for with His blood.

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:22.880
There's nothing you can do to earn it.

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:24.900
It's available to all people.

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:27.280
You must simply receive it.

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:30.960
The question this morning is, have you received the gift of God?

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:32.160
Have you been born again?

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:34.520
Have you trusted Christ as your Savior?

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:35.520
Can I tell you this?

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:37.640
He won't force you to receive the gift.

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:42.600
In fact, you can reject the gift.

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:47.840
I used to be able to say that I've never had anyone reject a gift that I tried to give

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:54.080
them, but just recently I had someone reject a gift.

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:59.080
And you wouldn't know who they are, and it was just a token of appreciation.

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:04.280
I was trying to be a kind individual, and I extended a gift to someone, and it really

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:07.400
wasn't anything of any great monetary value.

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:12.280
It was just a small token of appreciation.

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:15.680
Within just a few minutes, the person said, I don't want this.

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:17.360
I can't take this.

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:21.280
And they gave it back to me.

00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:24.880
Until that event, just recently, I'd never had anyone reject a gift that I tried to give

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:25.880
them.

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:29.760
It's pretty customary that we receive a gift.

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:31.440
And God says, I have a gift for you.

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:33.560
Will you receive it?

00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:35.320
Or will you reject it?

00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:39.700
Now this morning, I know that I'm talking to many that have already received the gift.

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:45.280
And we know this gift of God that is spoken of in John chapter number 4.

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:49.880
And this morning when we speak about this idea when he says, if thou knewest the gift

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:55.400
of God and I consider his gift to me, I want you to consider number 2 this morning, I

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:59.880
want you to consider my gift to him.

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:01.600
What's my gift to him?

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:09.360
And understand, when I deal with this truth this morning, my gift to him is not to try

00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:13.000
to get his gift to me.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:18.240
My gift to him is not to try to keep his gift that he's given me.

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:23.120
My gift to him is out of gratitude for what he's done for me.

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:27.280
And we understand that as we go through the Scriptures that there is a response that we

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:32.640
find littered throughout the New Testament, the Old Testament as well, how that the people

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:38.800
of God as they've received this gift, how they respond by thanking God, by praising

00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:43.280
God, by living for God, because they understand this gift.

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:45.720
I've said this before from this pulpit.

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:50.480
The reality is that if we could lose the gift, if we could lose the salvation, we would

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:55.680
have lost it the day we got it.

00:27:55.680 --> 00:28:00.040
I know, there's no way I can keep it the same way I can't earn it.

00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:01.040
Amen?

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:05.040
I'm kept by the power of God.

00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:07.520
But what's my gift back to him?

00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:10.840
Number 1, I would say this, it's my praise.

00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:12.040
My praise.

00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:14.400
Is he not worthy of our praise?

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:19.440
When we understand the gift that he's given to us, when we understand this gift of God,

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:23.680
which is eternal life, we ought to lift our voice and praise him and thank him.

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:28.480
2 Corinthians 9 and verse 15 said, but thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift.

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:30.760
I'm thanking him and I'm praising him.

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:31.760
Why?

00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:34.240
Because I understand that he's given me this gift.

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:40.440
I couldn't earn it, I couldn't work for it, I'm without hope, I'm dead in my sins and

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:41.440
my trespasses.

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:47.480
I am hopeless and I am helpless, but God in his grace and his mercy, he says, I have a

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:49.400
gift for you.

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:50.600
And what's my gift back to him?

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:51.600
I praise him.

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:53.160
I praise him.

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:54.160
Consider Hebrews 13.

00:28:54.160 --> 00:29:00.200
Turn over there if you will and consider Hebrews 13 and what the word of God says with regard

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:03.040
to our praise for our God.

00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:07.960
We of course could go to the book of Psalms and we could read many passages of Scripture

00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:11.960
in the book of Psalms with regard to our praise and lifting our voice and praising

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:15.799
our God and the fact that he is worthy of our praise.

00:29:15.799 --> 00:29:21.440
And here in Hebrews 13 and verse number 15, the Bible speaks here about the praise of

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:22.440
his people.

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:28.760
By him, therefore, let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God.

00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:30.559
How often?

00:29:30.559 --> 00:29:32.160
Continually.

00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:39.000
That is the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.679
He is worthy of our praise.

00:29:40.679 --> 00:29:47.359
And this morning, when I praise my God, I'm lifting him up, I'm exalting him, I'm magnifying

00:29:47.359 --> 00:29:48.359
him.

00:29:48.359 --> 00:29:49.480
Let God be magnified.

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:51.160
Let God be exalted.

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:53.520
And I'm speaking about his gift.

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:59.520
Remember there's not a place for us to glory or for us to boast because it's not by works,

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:01.660
it's not by our merit.

00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:02.940
It's all because of his glory.

00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:07.620
grace and His mercy, and so therefore He alone is the one that receives the glory.

00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:12.240
He alone is the one that receives the praise. When someone were to ask me the

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:16.420
question, are you sure of heaven, it's not in any glory in myself that I say, yep, I

00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:19.900
know I'm going to heaven because I've done this and I'm this and so on and so

00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:24.100
forth. No, I know I'm going to heaven because Jesus Christ died for me. He

00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:29.300
paid my debt. He was buried and He rose again. He conquered sin, death, and the

00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:34.700
grave, and He saved my soul, and I want to praise Him. I want to lift up my voice

00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:42.780
and give thanks to God for His gift. Is it not customary in our society to thank

00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:53.000
people for gifts? You receive a gift, someone says thank you, right? Sometimes

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:58.740
we give a gift to someone and we receive a thank-you card. Do you give a thank-you

00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:04.540
card for the thank-you card? I mean, no, it's not customary, but you understand

00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:10.700
what I'm saying, right? We understand what it is to express gratitude for a gift.

00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:17.900
Well, if this greatest gift, this gift of God, which is eternal life, has been

00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:22.980
freely given to us and we've understood, listen, I'm thankful that I do not live

00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:26.700
in a place, I'm thankful that I've been exposed to the truth of the gospel, that

00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:30.740
I know the gift of God, and for you this morning that are under the sound of my

00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:34.380
voice, whether you're here locally or you're watching via live stream, you now

00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:39.779
know the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. You may

00:31:39.779 --> 00:31:43.779
have entered into this building, you may have clicked on that link on the

00:31:43.779 --> 00:31:48.020
internet, and you may not have known what the gift of God is in this

00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:54.740
sense, and understanding what the Scripture said, but now you know. And as

00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:58.580
we receive that gift and we say, I no longer I'm gonna try to work for this

00:31:58.580 --> 00:32:04.060
thing because I understand that I can't, He gives us a rest in our salvation, and

00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:09.340
it's a blessed thing, and we ought to lift our voice and praise Him. And as we

00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:13.460
praise Him and as we lift Him up and exalt Him and we speak of our Savior,

00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:19.180
we're influencing others. Let me say this, not only my gift to Him is my praise, but

00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:26.139
it's my life. It's my life. I'm mindful of the truth of Romans 12, and it's a

00:32:26.139 --> 00:32:29.940
familiar verse of Scripture, really two verses of Scripture, Romans 12 verses 1

00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:33.979
and 2. Many of us are familiar with this passage of Scripture. If you were to take

00:32:33.979 --> 00:32:38.380
the whole of the book of Romans and really just divide it up into a few

00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:43.660
sections and understand the indictment against mankind that all have sinned and

00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:49.100
come short of the glory of God. There's none righteous, no not one. We find

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:53.059
those truths in the book of Romans in the third chapter. If you're to look in

00:32:53.059 --> 00:32:58.100
the fifth chapter and understand that sin entered into this world by one man,

00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:03.260
by Adam, and sin has passed upon all men, death has passed upon all men, excuse me,

00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:09.979
for all have sinned. We look at the truth of Romans 5 that by one man's

00:33:09.979 --> 00:33:14.979
transgression all have been influenced, but by the gift of one, speaking of the

00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:20.940
price that was paid on the cross of Calvary by the Lord Jesus Christ, all men

00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:26.699
now freely can receive this gift. Romans 6, we looked at verse 23 earlier, the

00:33:26.699 --> 00:33:31.540
wages of sin is death, the gift of God is eternal life. Romans 10, for whosoever

00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:36.580
shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. So we understand our

00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:39.940
condition that we were hopeless and helpless for all have sinned and come

00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:43.740
short of the glory of God. There's none righteous, no not one, but we understand

00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:47.860
that Jesus died for us and he paid the price for us so that we could have

00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:52.540
eternal life. We've accepted him, we've called upon him, we've received this

00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:57.660
gift, and now we come to Romans 12 and Paul says, I beseech you therefore,

00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:04.260
brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice,

00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:10.779
wholly acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. Be not conformed to

00:34:10.779 --> 00:34:14.500
this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may

00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:20.619
prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God. I said often a

00:34:20.619 --> 00:34:24.140
couple of years ago we preached through the book of Ephesians on Sunday morning.

00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:30.500
The theme is somewhat evident in the book of Colossians as well. We speak

00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:34.179
about in the book of Ephesians, there's very clear distinction in that book

00:34:34.179 --> 00:34:38.500
between the first section and the second section. In the first section of the book

00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:43.820
of Ephesians, it specifically is dealing with our standing before God, the fact

00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:46.700
that we've been saved, that we've received this gift that I'm speaking of

00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:52.820
this morning. The second section of the book of Ephesians clearly deals with our

00:34:52.820 --> 00:35:01.380
service for our Lord. Because I'm saved, I walk in wisdom, I walk in truth, and all

00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:05.220
of these truths that are given to us at the latter part of the book of

00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:11.260
Ephesians. And we understand, and I said this often, that I do not, that the truth

00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:16.940
of Ephesians is not that Paul is saying, walk in wisdom or walk worthy so that

00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:21.179
you can get saved or so that you can stay saved. No, the matter of salvation

00:35:21.179 --> 00:35:27.940
has already been established. Our standing is already sure, and because of

00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:35.899
that, I now serve my God. I offer to him my praise, but I offer to him my life.

00:35:35.899 --> 00:35:40.739
Remember the truth. Turn over. I sign every card that I sign. 2 Corinthians

00:35:40.739 --> 00:35:45.500
chapter number 5, in verse number 15, if you've received a card, a letter, an email

00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:50.500
from me, you see 2 Corinthians 5.15 in my signature every time I write

00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:56.339
something. And in 2 Corinthians chapter number 5, in verse number 14, the Bible

00:35:56.339 --> 00:35:59.700
says that the love of Christ constraineth us, because we thus judge

00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:04.860
that if one died for all, then we're all dead. And notice verse number 15, in that

00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:11.339
he died for all. Remember, we said the gift is available. It's available to all.

00:36:11.339 --> 00:36:17.299
He died for all, that they which live, I've been saved, I've been born again, it

00:36:17.299 --> 00:36:22.700
says that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto

00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:28.700
him which died for them and rose again. We sing the song, Living for Jesus. You

00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:34.260
know, if you're not saved, you can't live for Jesus. You can't. But because I've

00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:39.220
been saved, I want to offer him my life. Paul says, this is your reasonable service,

00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:44.059
that we present our bodies a living sacrifice. Again, it's not so that we can

00:36:44.059 --> 00:36:48.820
be saved, it's not so that we can stay saved, it's the result of us being saved

00:36:48.980 --> 00:36:54.779
and understanding this gift that we have received. What glory, what blessing. I

00:36:54.779 --> 00:37:01.940
would say this as we turn back to John chapter number 4, nearing the end of the

00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:06.820
thought this morning, and as we turn back to John chapter number 4, and I think

00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:11.059
about my praise in my life, and I notice in this text of Scripture that both of

00:37:11.059 --> 00:37:17.619
those things are evident in this life of this woman that is mentioned here by her

00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:24.660
witness, when I know the gift of God, I must share this gift with others. When I

00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:28.220
truly understand, remember, he says in verse number 10, the beginning of their

00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:33.820
interaction, if thou knewest the gift of God. The reality is that at this point,

00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:40.500
she didn't know the gift of God, correct? She didn't know it, but it's about to be

00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:46.500
revealed to her. She didn't know what the gift was. He said, if you knew what it was,

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:50.700
you would have asked me, and I would have given to thee living water. The woman

00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:55.860
saith, in verse number 11, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with. The well is deep.

00:37:55.860 --> 00:38:01.619
From whence then hast thou that living water? And art thou greater than our

00:38:01.619 --> 00:38:08.100
father Jacob? Yes, absolutely, he is God. Which gave us the well, and drank there

00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:11.619
of himself, and his children, and his cattle. Jesus answered and said unto her,

00:38:11.619 --> 00:38:15.980
whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again. Did she understand that?

00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:20.420
Yeah, that's why she was there that day. She needed more water. Notice verse

00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:26.019
number 14, but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never

00:38:26.019 --> 00:38:30.140
thirst, but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water

00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:34.860
springing up into everlasting life. He's speaking about that living water that he

00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:38.900
mentioned in verse number 10. He's speaking about salvation, and of course

00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:44.340
her response immediately in verse number 15, Sir, give me this water that I thirst

00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:49.059
not, neither come hither to draw. She didn't fully understand the gift yet. She

00:38:49.059 --> 00:38:53.299
was still thinking on the natural plane. She was still thinking physically. She

00:38:53.299 --> 00:38:58.580
was not understanding the spiritual truth that God was giving her, this gift

00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:03.140
of God as eternal life, as we found in Romans 6, and she says, listen, I don't

00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:06.979
want to have to keep coming back to this well. She's thinking on that physical

00:39:06.979 --> 00:39:12.820
plane. Notice Jesus, in order to help her understand her sinful condition, her

00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:17.580
need for this spiritual water, this living water that he's speaking of, he

00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:21.419
says in verse number 16, go call thy husband and come hither. The woman

00:39:21.419 --> 00:39:25.080
answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, thou hast well said, I have

00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:29.739
no husband, for thou hast had five husbands, and he whom thou now hast is

00:39:29.739 --> 00:39:36.780
not thy husband, and that sayest thou truly. Notice her response, Sir, I perceive

00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:46.220
that thou art a prophet. He's greater than a prophet. He's God. He's God. She

00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:50.020
says, our fathers worshiped in this mountain, and ye say that in Jerusalem is

00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:54.820
the place where men ought to worship. Jesus saith unto her, woman, believe

00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:59.739
me, the hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem

00:39:59.739 --> 00:40:04.700
worship the Father. Ye worship, ye know not. What?

00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:09.100
know what we worship, notice this, for salvation is of the Jews. What does he mean by that?

00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:13.900
It was through the, of course we understand through the messianic prophecies, we've been

00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:19.500
studying the book of Genesis, and as God called Abraham and the Jewish nation, the Hebrew

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:27.500
nation, that Christ would come through that line, and we understand that salvation is

00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:32.300
of the Jews. But the hour cometh, verse 23, and now is when the true worshippers shall

00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:37.500
worship the Father in spirit and in truth, for the Father seeketh such to worship him.

00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:42.060
God is a spirit. They that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. Notice

00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:47.700
what she says. It's, now she's understanding the gift of God. Because it says in verse

00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:54.420
number 25, the woman saith unto him, I know that Messiah is cometh, which is called Christ.

00:40:54.420 --> 00:41:01.540
When he is come, he will tell us all things. And Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto

00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:12.300
thee am he. Wow. Wow. She's met Messiah. Jesus must needs go through Samaria, and

00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:19.300
we find that, she says, that as he's dealing with her and drilling down and dealing with

00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:24.940
the spiritual issues at hand, she says, I know that Messiah is cometh, which is called

00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:33.220
Christ. And he says, I am he. I that speak unto thee am he.

00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:37.380
The disciples return. Remember back in verse number 8, they tell us that the disciples

00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:40.740
were gone away into the city to buy meat, and so Jesus is there with this woman. The

00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:46.060
disciples are off running some errands, if you will, getting the supplies that were needed.

00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:50.780
The Bible tells us that they marveled that he talked to the woman in verse number 27.

00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:54.740
But I want you to notice in verse 28 that the woman then left her water pot and went

00:41:54.740 --> 00:42:01.060
her way into the city, and saith to the men, Come, see a man which told me all things that

00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:10.980
ever I did. Is not this the Christ? She now understands this gift. Not only does she understand

00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:16.500
the gift, but she wants to share the gift. Isn't that natural?

00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:21.500
This morning, for many of us, I started the message by saying, what's his gift to me?

00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:24.260
What would I consider his gift to me? And we considered it, and we looked at a number

00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:28.820
of truths within the Word of God, and for many of us this morning, we can say, I received

00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:36.220
that gift. But here, when this woman that in the beginning of the passage did not know

00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:42.380
the gift of God, if thou knewest the gift of God, she didn't know it, now as her eyes

00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:49.060
have been opened, as Jesus deals with her, she now has her eyes opened, and she says,

00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:57.220
Is not this the Christ? We find that she goes back and she tells them, and it says, as you

00:42:57.220 --> 00:43:07.300
look and skip down in verse number 39, and many of the Samaritans of the city believed

00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:13.660
on him for the saying of the woman, which testified he told me all that ever I did.

00:43:13.660 --> 00:43:17.500
So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with

00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:23.060
them, and he abode there two days. So notice the scene, she leaves from getting water,

00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:28.220
and she runs back to the city, and she tells these people, she announces this experience

00:43:28.220 --> 00:43:32.820
that she's had, and this interaction that she's had with Christ, with the Messiah, and

00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:36.860
the Bible tells us that many of the Samaritans believed on him for the saying of the woman,

00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:42.340
according to verse number 39, and then a great multitude come to him, he mentions about that,

00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:48.340
in verses 34 through 37, about the multitude that were coming, and he says that as they come,

00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:52.860
they ask him, they beseech him, that he would tarry there, and he stayed there for two days.

00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:59.980
And I want you to notice verses 41 and 42. It says that many more believed because of his own word,

00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:06.460
and said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying, for we have heard him

00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:15.820
ourselves, and know that this indeed is indeed the Christ, the Savior of the world. We sang this

00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:23.059
morning, joy to the world, the Savior is come. He has come. And as we understand this gift of God,

00:44:23.059 --> 00:44:29.300
Galatians chapter number 4, you don't need to turn there, but in Galatians 4, in verse number 4,

00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:35.700
the Bible says, when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman,

00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:42.380
made under the law. What was the purpose of sending his Son? To redeem them that were under

00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:49.100
the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons. How did he redeem us? Through his substitutionary

00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:55.460
atonement. The gift of God that we're speaking of this morning, this gift that's been made

00:44:55.460 --> 00:45:01.620
available to us, and as we understand this gift, and as we've received this gift, then we ought to

00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:09.860
have the desire to give him our praise, to give him our life, to lift up our voice and testify of

00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:22.180
him. In John chapter number 1, John the Baptist is preaching, and the Lord Jesus Christ walks by,

00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:29.380
and John the Baptist says, behold the Lamb of God. The Bible tells us that a couple of those

00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:35.059
two disciples of John the Baptist, they followed after Jesus, and Jesus said, what seek ye? And

00:45:35.059 --> 00:45:44.059
they say, where dwellest thou? And he said, come and see. And the Bible says that in verse number

00:45:44.059 --> 00:45:48.540
40, one of the two which heard John speak and followed him was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.

00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:55.620
He first findeth his own brother Simon and saith unto him, we have found the Messiah, which is

00:45:55.620 --> 00:46:01.260
being interpreted, the Christ. And I want you to notice this phrase in verse number 42, and he

00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:13.860
brought him to Jesus. This morning, if thou knewest the gift of God, we consider his gift to us, it's

00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:20.020
eternal life. This morning, if you've not received the gift of eternal life, I would say to you this

00:46:20.020 --> 00:46:27.340
morning, would you receive the gift of God? It's available. He's paid for it. He makes it available

00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:37.700
to all people. Today is the day of salvation. Today is the day of salvation. We know not what's

00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:42.740
on the morrow, according to Proverbs 27. What is your life? It's a vapor that appeareth for a little

00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:48.580
time and then vanisheth away. And this morning, if you're not sure of heaven, if you've not received

00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:54.660
the gift of God, which is eternal life, this Christmas season, why don't you receive the

00:46:54.660 --> 00:47:04.820
greatest gift, the perfect gift, the gift of God, which is eternal life. This morning, if you've

00:47:04.820 --> 00:47:11.700
already received that gift, what's our gift in return to him? How are we praising him? Are we

00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:18.580
lifting his name? Are we exalting him the way that we should? Have we given him our lives? Not

00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:23.340
to earn our salvation, not to keep it. We can't earn it or keep it. But because of what he's done

00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:31.100
for us, have we offered him our lives? How's our testimony? Who are we bringing to Jesus? Who are

00:47:31.100 --> 00:47:39.020
we saying, let me tell you about this gift, this gift of God. Let me tell you what he did for you,

00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:44.460
or what he did for me and what he can do for you. Let me tell you how he changed my life

00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:51.820
and how he can change your life too, if thou knewest the gift of God. Maybe this morning,

00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:57.980
someone entered into this meeting place not knowing the gift of God, but now you know it.

00:47:59.740 --> 00:48:05.660
Would you receive it? It's available. He's already paid for it. You say, what do I have to do? Just

00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:13.340
receive it. Just receive it. I hope that you wouldn't reject it because God loves you so much

00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:18.460
and he wants you to be saved. Let's pray together. Father, we love you.

00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:23.180
We thank you for loving us. We thank you for the Word of God.

00:48:25.340 --> 00:48:32.380
We're thankful that you sent your son, the Lord Jesus Christ, born of a virgin.

00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:42.780
We're thankful that you sent your son to this world, to this sin-cursed world,

00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:50.220
so he could live a sinless, perfect life, so he could make the atonement for our sin,

00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:58.700
pay the price so that we could be redeemed. We're thankful this morning for this unspeakable gift.

00:48:59.580 --> 00:49:06.380
That this gift has been paid for, paid in full, with the precious blood of Jesus Christ, proven

00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:14.540
through his glorious resurrection. I'm thankful that it's available. Lord,

00:49:14.540 --> 00:49:21.500
if there'd be one this morning, maybe there's several. Here locally, tuned in via live stream,

00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:27.820
they entered this meeting time the same way that that woman at the well, not knowing the gift of

00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:33.260
God. He said, if you knew it, you'd ask for it and I'd give it to you.

00:49:35.660 --> 00:49:37.739
This morning, he is the Savior of the world.

00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:46.220
He's my Savior. He wants to be your Savior. If you're not sure of heaven this morning,

00:49:46.220 --> 00:49:47.900
Lord, would you work with the Holy Spirit,

00:49:50.540 --> 00:49:54.700
convict and convince of sin and of Christ's righteousness and of judgment to come?

00:49:57.820 --> 00:50:00.540
For those that have already received the gift of God this morning,

00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:04.540
would you help us to live for Jesus? Help us to live for you.

00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:06.240
You.

00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:08.280
Help us to praise You.

00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:12.240
Help us to surrender our lives.

00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:17.880
Help us to testify and bring others to Jesus, because we understand this wonderful gift

00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:23.240
and we want the world to know that Jesus saves.

00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:28.080
We pray that You'd move work as only You can in this time of invitation.

00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:31.880
We'll give You the honor and glory for all that You'll do, for it's in Christ's name

00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:32.880
we pray.

00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:33.880
Would You stand with me?

00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:36.160
God, eyes are closed.

00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:41.600
The conclusion of our services, we have a time of invitation.

00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:45.560
We invite you to respond to the preaching of the Word of God.

00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:51.040
As the Holy Spirit of God has moved in your heart and your life, we ask that you'd respond.

00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:55.240
No one's looking around, we'd never embarrass you.

00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:58.800
Kimberly will play quietly on the piano, and as she does, the altar's open.

00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:02.040
If you're not sure of heaven, we'd love to take a Bible and show you how you can know

00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:03.680
for sure that heaven's your home.

00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:11.680
If you want to just come and thank Him for this unspeakable gift, perhaps you just want

00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:18.000
to praise His name and offer your life to Him, or bring others to Jesus.

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:21.040
However it is that the Lord may have spoken to your heart this morning, the altar is open

00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:22.200
as Kimberly plays.
