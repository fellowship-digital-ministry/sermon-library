WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.980
I even remain, and looking for the upper taker,

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:05.920
not the undertaker, amen.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.079
And what a blessing.

00:00:07.079 --> 00:00:09.760
Matthew chapter number 16 this evening,

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.979
and as you're turning there, I wanna remind you,

00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:13.720
if you would pray for Miss Norma Jean.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.139
Donna and Regina have not been able to be here today.

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.639
I chatted with Norma Jean this afternoon.

00:00:17.639 --> 00:00:20.440
She's still dealing with a great deal of pain

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.399
in her leg, hip area,

00:00:22.399 --> 00:00:25.639
and so she's got an appointment at 1.30 tomorrow,

00:00:25.639 --> 00:00:29.360
and she is hoping that as she goes to that appointment,

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:31.840
that they'll be able to determine what's going on,

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.200
and whether it means that they have to take some x-rays

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.919
or MRIs or what needs to happen

00:00:35.919 --> 00:00:38.080
to try to figure out that pain.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.240
And so if you pray for Norma Jean,

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.560
I know that she'd greatly appreciate that.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.840
Matthew chapter number 16 this evening,

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.799
over the past three weeks here on Sunday evenings,

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:51.279
we have focused our attention on sharing the gospel,

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:53.759
and it's not enough to simply understand

00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:56.200
the responsibility that God has given us

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.520
to share the gospel,

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.279
but we must know how to share the gospel.

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:01.919
I have found people over the years

00:01:01.919 --> 00:01:04.720
that say they have a desire to tell others about Jesus,

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.680
but they feel intimidated, they feel overwhelmed,

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.199
they have fear.

00:01:09.199 --> 00:01:11.360
I said many times over the last three weeks

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.440
that that first door that I knock on

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.120
every time I go out door knocking,

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.279
yesterday morning, the very first door I knocked on the door

00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:19.760
I had a measure of fear,

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.559
and it's just something that happens every single time.

00:01:23.559 --> 00:01:26.720
But man, it is a joy to know that you're going

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.680
in the power of the Lord, that you said I will be with thee

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.800
and we have the opportunity to be able to share Christ,

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.400
to share the gospel,

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.760
and God gave us some open doors yesterday.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.440
And we went through last week

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.720
and shared a number of different

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.720
really kind of just practical tips.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.839
And at the end of the service,

00:01:42.839 --> 00:01:45.800
we had you break up and interact with someone

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.839
that you'd not yet previously shared your testimony with

00:01:48.839 --> 00:01:50.400
and share your testimony with them.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.639
And I got some real positive feedback from that.

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:55.959
And I appreciate the opportunity.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
It was a joy as I stood here and kind of just observed

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.839
and saw what was going on.

00:02:00.839 --> 00:02:03.199
And of course, I mentioned at the end of the service

00:02:03.199 --> 00:02:05.000
that the idea was to get you a little bit

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.160
out of your comfort zone here

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.360
so that we would be equipped to be able to go out there

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.039
and share our testimony, share the gospel.

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:14.639
And what a joy that is.

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:17.119
I believe that those three weeks of lessons

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.679
really helped us and paved the way, if you will,

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:23.800
for the message this evening.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.199
And we've been dealing with this subject matter

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:27.520
on Sunday evenings.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.800
It started just a few weeks ago

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.199
of Ask the Pastor throughout the summer.

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:33.080
And many people submitted questions.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.320
We had forms that were available for you.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.919
And I know that there's a number of you

00:02:36.919 --> 00:02:37.839
that still have forms

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:39.279
because I know how many we printed out

00:02:39.279 --> 00:02:40.839
and I know how many I got back.

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:42.479
And so some of you still have forms

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:43.759
that you haven't submitted.

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:47.039
And you give it to me on like August 31st.

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:48.880
It's not gonna get answered until next year

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.360
because we're starting with a new series in September.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.520
And so if you have them, get them into me.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.639
But the question that I'm going to seek

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:58.479
to answer this evening,

00:02:58.479 --> 00:03:00.479
as I believe, again, the last three weeks

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:02.479
really built the foundation for this,

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:04.919
the question is asked this way.

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:09.919
How do churches grow according to the Bible?

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.919
How do churches grow according to the Bible?

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:14.320
I think it's a great question

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.399
and worthy of our consideration.

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:18.039
And really, as I look at the question,

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:20.300
I then also ask a couple of questions.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.899
Number one, this question comes to mind,

00:03:22.899 --> 00:03:25.179
should churches grow?

00:03:25.179 --> 00:03:27.779
I think obviously the answer to that would be yes,

00:03:27.779 --> 00:03:29.419
a church should grow.

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:31.660
I then ask this follow-up question

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.580
as I was preparing and just working

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.500
on developing the message,

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.899
is all growth, when we talk about church growth,

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:41.740
is all growth numeric?

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.419
In other words, you talk about numeric growth,

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:46.779
oftentimes that's the focus.

00:03:46.779 --> 00:03:48.580
When we talk about church growth,

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.380
we talk about numerical growth,

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.660
numbers adding to the church,

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.820
and certainly that's part of it.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.220
But I think we would do ourselves a disservice

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.679
if we think that is all of it,

00:03:59.679 --> 00:04:01.380
because the reality is that a church

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.860
should not simply be growing numerically,

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.940
but a church ought to be growing spiritually.

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.580
And we'll look at both of those aspects this evening

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.820
as we seek to answer this question.

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.740
I've titled the message here from Matthew 16,

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.380
I, that's Jesus speaking,

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.779
I will build my church.

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:24.220
Notice in Matthew 16, in verse number 13,

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.420
Jesus came into the coast of Caesarea Philippi,

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:28.980
he asked his disciples saying,

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.140
whom do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.579
And they said, some say that thou art John the Baptist,

00:04:34.579 --> 00:04:37.500
some Elias, and others Jeremias, or one of the prophets.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.260
He saith unto them, but whom say ye that I am?

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.820
And Simon Peter answered and said,

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.820
thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.540
What a great declaration that Peter makes here.

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.420
And Jesus tells Peter in verse number 17,

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.380
blessed art thou, Simon Barjona,

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.980
for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee,

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.100
but my Father, which is in heaven.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.500
And I say also unto thee, that thou art Peter,

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.100
and upon this rock I will build my church,

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.779
and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:12.899
In verse number 18 is a verse that's been taken

00:05:12.899 --> 00:05:14.980
out of context many times.

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:19.980
Of course, there's a large known religious organization

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:23.739
that says that Peter is the one in which Jesus

00:05:23.739 --> 00:05:26.820
is speaking of here, upon this rock, that being Peter.

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.700
I believe as you study the scriptures,

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.459
it makes obvious understanding here

00:05:31.459 --> 00:05:34.380
that it's on the declaration that Peter made,

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.980
not on Peter himself, and that declaration is,

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:40.899
thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:45.980
And we find that Jesus says, I will build my church.

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.260
As we dig in this evening, I want you to notice with me,

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.540
number one, the promise recorded.

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:52.700
Here in our text of scripture,

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.299
we see that God gives a promise.

00:05:54.299 --> 00:05:57.140
He gives them, he brings them to a particular place.

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.420
In fact, I have been, Holly and I had the opportunity

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:03.220
a couple of years ago to be right here in Caesarea Philippi

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:06.380
where Jesus had this interaction with the disciples.

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.940
And as we were there, it was of great interest

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:12.660
to understand how Jesus moved with such purpose

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.260
during his earthly ministry.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.540
He brought the disciples to this place, Caesarea Philippi,

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:19.980
which was actually not super convenient

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:23.899
with regard to the topography and the journey

00:06:23.899 --> 00:06:25.100
and all that would take place.

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.779
But he takes them there and he asked them this question,

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:32.980
whom do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:34.459
What a great question.

00:06:34.459 --> 00:06:38.739
There, of course, were many within Israel at that time

00:06:39.579 --> 00:06:40.579
that had heard about Jesus.

00:06:40.579 --> 00:06:41.940
They saw the miracles.

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.739
They were familiar with what was taking place

00:06:44.739 --> 00:06:46.220
during his earthly ministry.

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.799
And so there were a variety of opinions

00:06:48.799 --> 00:06:52.640
that had been formed by people in Israel during that time.

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.380
And so the disciples say, well,

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.019
some think that you're John the Baptist

00:06:56.019 --> 00:06:58.779
and some, Elijah and others, Jeremiah

00:06:58.779 --> 00:07:00.299
or one of the prophets.

00:07:00.299 --> 00:07:02.679
And in other words, there was an uncertainty

00:07:02.679 --> 00:07:04.619
amongst the masses of the people.

00:07:04.619 --> 00:07:07.940
And so then Jesus looks at the disciples and says,

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:12.859
but in verse number 15, whom say ye that I am?

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:16.619
You know, the world will give you a lot of answers

00:07:16.619 --> 00:07:18.559
with regard to who is Jesus.

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:22.899
But the reality is that we better know who Jesus is.

00:07:22.899 --> 00:07:27.380
He is God in flesh and he is the savior of the world.

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:30.339
And he, Jesus, God in flesh, he says,

00:07:30.339 --> 00:07:33.380
whom say ye that I am?

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:36.739
And Peter says, thou art the Christ,

00:07:36.739 --> 00:07:39.739
the son of the living God.

00:07:39.739 --> 00:07:44.040
And Jesus, after hearing that declaration of Peter,

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:46.820
he says that this has not been revealed to you

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:47.820
by flesh and blood.

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:50.880
Rather, he says that his father in heaven

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.299
has revealed it to him.

00:07:52.299 --> 00:07:55.100
And then he says, I will build my church in verse 18,

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.899
that promise that we're focused on this evening.

00:07:57.899 --> 00:08:00.339
And he says this, the gates of hell

00:08:00.339 --> 00:08:02.399
shall not prevail against it.

00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:05.079
The interesting dynamic of the location

00:08:05.079 --> 00:08:07.019
is that it was truly the place

00:08:07.019 --> 00:08:09.100
where they were in Caesarea Philippi.

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:12.519
It would be known as being the gates of hell,

00:08:12.519 --> 00:08:16.660
the most wicked, ungodly, idolatrous place

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:19.279
that they could physically be at.

00:08:19.279 --> 00:08:22.040
And they would call it the gates of hell.

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:25.559
And all of the pagan, idolatrous worship

00:08:25.559 --> 00:08:28.839
that was taking place, that Jesus says,

00:08:28.839 --> 00:08:32.400
I'm gonna build my church and the gates of hell

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:35.599
shall not prevail against it.

00:08:35.599 --> 00:08:38.659
Now that's a great promise and we take that promise

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:41.359
and every promise in the book is mine.

00:08:41.359 --> 00:08:43.280
Every chapter, every verse, every line,

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.840
we sing the verse, the song.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.719
And I'm so thankful that Peter would say

00:08:47.719 --> 00:08:49.840
as he's writing there later

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:52.200
and trying to encourage the people of God,

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:56.080
he talks about the exceeding precious promises

00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:01.080
that God gives and no doubt, this is one of them.

00:09:01.119 --> 00:09:03.840
We find that as Jesus makes this declaration,

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:06.400
as we have the entirety of the New Testament,

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:10.340
that Jesus says, I will build my church.

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:13.599
He is the one who is the owner, the possessor.

00:09:13.599 --> 00:09:17.559
The church is God's idea, not man's idea.

00:09:17.559 --> 00:09:21.080
And we find that Jesus says, I will build my church.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.799
It's important that we remember

00:09:22.799 --> 00:09:25.460
that Christ is the head of the church.

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:28.539
And Colossians chapter number one in verse number 18

00:09:28.539 --> 00:09:32.239
gives us great clarity with regard to the truth

00:09:32.239 --> 00:09:35.659
that the church is that he, Christ,

00:09:35.659 --> 00:09:36.659
is the head of the church.

00:09:36.659 --> 00:09:39.940
It says it this way in verse 18 of Colossians one,

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:41.840
and he is the head of the body of the church

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:44.219
who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead,

00:09:44.219 --> 00:09:48.200
that in all things he might have the preeminence.

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.059
No doubt that when we look at verse number 18

00:09:51.059 --> 00:09:53.619
that in all things he might have the preeminence,

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:56.059
that's an application that we can take

00:09:56.059 --> 00:09:57.739
that in every area of my life,

00:09:57.739 --> 00:10:00.059
but surely in the church.

00:10:00.059 --> 00:10:06.239
house, he ought to have the preeminence because it is his church, he is the head of the church.

00:10:06.239 --> 00:10:11.039
It's actually kind of disappointing as you look at the landscape of Christendom in the

00:10:11.039 --> 00:10:16.079
world today and all that's being done in the name of church, in the name of religion, and

00:10:16.079 --> 00:10:21.839
how Jesus seems to have no real place in a lot of that stuff that's going on and how

00:10:21.839 --> 00:10:23.239
sad that is.

00:10:23.239 --> 00:10:27.079
But we find that Christ, he said, I will build my church.

00:10:27.079 --> 00:10:32.399
He said in Acts chapter number 20, Paul is speaking to the Ephesian elders and he says

00:10:32.399 --> 00:10:35.959
that Christ purchased the church with his blood.

00:10:35.959 --> 00:10:41.659
We find that as he's talking to the church in Ephesus in Ephesians 5, he tells husbands

00:10:41.659 --> 00:10:48.599
that they loved their wives even as Christ loved the church and gave himself for it.

00:10:48.599 --> 00:10:54.839
And so we understand that God has instituted the church and we understand that Christ is

00:10:54.839 --> 00:10:59.799
the head of the church and he's made this promise and we must also acknowledge as we're

00:10:59.799 --> 00:11:06.519
considering the promise that is recorded that it is Christ who gives the increase.

00:11:06.519 --> 00:11:08.459
It is Christ who gives the increase.

00:11:08.459 --> 00:11:12.079
Remember what the Bible says in 1 Corinthians, turn there if you would, in 1 Corinthians

00:11:12.079 --> 00:11:16.239
chapter number 3, the church in Corinth is a church that is carnal.

00:11:16.239 --> 00:11:19.019
In fact, the beginning of chapter 3 deals with that.

00:11:19.019 --> 00:11:25.459
We find that chapter 1 addresses the divisions and all that's taking place there in Corinth.

00:11:25.459 --> 00:11:29.619
And some of what's happening is there are some that are saying I'm of Paul, I'm of Cephas,

00:11:29.619 --> 00:11:32.419
I'm of Apollos and so on and so forth.

00:11:32.419 --> 00:11:38.879
And Paul kind of does a system reset, if you will, for the church here and helps them understand

00:11:38.879 --> 00:11:44.239
an important truth, an important principle that is pertinent to our discussion this evening

00:11:44.239 --> 00:11:47.860
with regard to how is a church supposed to grow.

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:52.540
And so we find there's a promise that Jesus said I will build my church, he's the head

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:57.299
of the church, but he's also the one who gives the increase.

00:11:57.299 --> 00:12:03.299
In 1 Corinthians chapter 3, in verse number 5, the Bible says who then is Paul and who

00:12:03.299 --> 00:12:04.899
is Apollos?

00:12:04.899 --> 00:12:11.039
But ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man.

00:12:11.039 --> 00:12:17.479
I have planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the increase.

00:12:17.479 --> 00:12:22.000
Now I think this evening that all of us tonight that are here are familiar with this verse

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.479
of Scripture, with 1 Corinthians 3 and verse number 6, that God gives the increase.

00:12:27.479 --> 00:12:30.839
Some plants, some water, but God gives the increase.

00:12:30.839 --> 00:12:36.279
And so as we begin to consider the way that a church grows according to the Bible, we

00:12:36.279 --> 00:12:38.699
acknowledge the promise.

00:12:38.699 --> 00:12:43.599
The promise is that Christ said I will build my church, he's the head of the church, and

00:12:43.599 --> 00:12:45.860
he's the one that gives the increase.

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:49.300
But here's the thing that we must be aware of and we must understand if you're taking

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:52.300
notes number two, the process revealed.

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:56.539
We see that there's a promise recorded, but there's a process revealed.

00:12:56.539 --> 00:13:01.239
Now the reality is that God could have chosen to build his church any way that he desired

00:13:01.239 --> 00:13:07.020
to do so, but he chose, as he reveals to us in his word, the process for which a church

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:14.819
grows numerically and spiritually, he has chosen to use individual members of the church.

00:13:14.819 --> 00:13:21.099
Individuals that are saved, following the Lord, he uses us to build his church.

00:13:21.099 --> 00:13:27.459
Now I think back to the Old Testament, Noah was given the responsibility to build an ark,

00:13:27.459 --> 00:13:28.459
yeah?

00:13:28.459 --> 00:13:32.940
He was given the responsibility to build an ark, and he was told to build this ark, he

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:37.339
was given all of the dimensions, he was told that God was going to bring judgment, it was

00:13:37.339 --> 00:13:39.339
going to rain, and so on and so forth.

00:13:39.339 --> 00:13:41.559
But you know what Noah didn't have to do?

00:13:41.559 --> 00:13:44.580
He didn't have to go gather the animals.

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:46.500
Am I right?

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:52.020
God brought the animals to the ark, correct?

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:58.220
God if he chose to, he could simply bring people to a place, but he has commissioned

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:03.679
us as we look at the New Testament, we see the process revealed, that were to go out

00:14:03.679 --> 00:14:06.300
and compel them to come in.

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:09.619
Now, does God send people in?

00:14:09.619 --> 00:14:10.619
Absolutely.

00:14:10.619 --> 00:14:15.500
We find that God is the one that gives the increase, he's the one that gives the fruit,

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:22.380
and he is the one that is at work, but he has not given the process that we just sit

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:29.059
on the premises and expect that he's going to miraculously build the church.

00:14:29.059 --> 00:14:33.660
There's a portion in this thing that is our responsibility.

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:37.320
And so as we begin to look at the process that's revealed in the New Testament, we begin

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:41.119
in Matthew chapter 28, and we're going to look at a number of portions of scripture

00:14:41.119 --> 00:14:48.119
tonight as we look at this process as it's revealed to us with regard to how a church

00:14:48.119 --> 00:14:52.320
is to grow according to the Bible.

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:56.320
In Matthew chapter 28, we're familiar with the portion of scripture, we often refer to

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:57.320
it as the Great Commission.

00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:01.239
And I want you to notice in verse number 18 of Matthew 28, the Bible says,

00:15:01.239 --> 00:15:27.399
If we were to take this portion of scripture and look at it as being the Great Commission

00:15:27.399 --> 00:15:31.799
and separate it into its three particular categories, we would understand that number

00:15:31.799 --> 00:15:35.279
one, we're to preach the gospel.

00:15:35.279 --> 00:15:36.639
We're to preach the gospel.

00:15:36.639 --> 00:15:39.600
The gospel is the power of God unto salvation.

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:43.839
That's why Paul says in Romans chapter number one, I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ.

00:15:43.839 --> 00:15:44.839
Why?

00:15:44.839 --> 00:15:48.739
For it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth, to the Jew first

00:15:48.739 --> 00:15:50.139
and also to the Greek.

00:15:50.139 --> 00:15:55.040
And so we understand that he says as he's speaking to the church in Corinth that Christ

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:58.160
did not send him to baptize but to preach.

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:02.959
And he's to preach the gospel, Christ crucified and risen again.

00:16:02.959 --> 00:16:07.239
Isn't that a wonderful message that God has given us to declare?

00:16:07.239 --> 00:16:11.079
And we find that if we'd look at the three particular categories, it's preaching the

00:16:11.079 --> 00:16:12.079
gospel.

00:16:12.079 --> 00:16:14.839
Number two is believer's baptism.

00:16:14.839 --> 00:16:19.399
After they trust Christ as their savior, the Bible says they're baptizing them in the name

00:16:19.399 --> 00:16:22.799
of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.

00:16:22.799 --> 00:16:24.100
And I am thankful.

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:28.260
This is that step, that first step of obedience for every child of God.

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:35.139
It's the public demonstration, identification that I am a follower of Jesus Christ.

00:16:35.139 --> 00:16:40.139
I've been saved and I am seeking to walk and to serve the Lord.

00:16:40.139 --> 00:16:45.500
In Romans, the Bible talks about as we use that portion of scripture as we baptize, raised

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:48.700
to walk in newness of life.

00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:51.700
And so we find the truth of preaching the gospel.

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:53.980
You see souls saved, you baptize them.

00:16:53.980 --> 00:17:00.139
And then verse 20, teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you.

00:17:00.139 --> 00:17:03.859
And lo, I am with you all even to the end of the world, amen.

00:17:03.859 --> 00:17:07.100
The third category would be that of discipleship.

00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:08.739
And discipleship is important.

00:17:08.739 --> 00:17:12.299
We understand that our responsibility is to make disciples.

00:17:12.299 --> 00:17:16.919
And this thing of discipleship, the art of discipleship, if you will, I touched on it

00:17:16.919 --> 00:17:22.279
briefly in the message this morning, where Paul was appreciative of the opportunity that

00:17:22.279 --> 00:17:28.500
he had to be in the ministry, to have a Timothy that he could invest in, that he could be

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:35.519
a mentor in his life and influence him so that he, Timothy, could take the spiritual

00:17:35.519 --> 00:17:41.200
baton, so to speak, as Paul knew that his life would soon come to an end, but Timothy

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:44.440
would be able to run the next leg of the race.

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:45.600
Does that make sense?

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:47.880
If we could use that analogy this evening.

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:55.359
And so Paul is seeking through what we would refer to as discipleship of investing in someone

00:17:55.359 --> 00:18:00.559
that would be able to take the reins and go the next mile.

00:18:00.559 --> 00:18:04.639
So as we begin to understand this process that's revealed to us in the New Testament

00:18:04.639 --> 00:18:10.279
with regard to how a church is growing, how a church grows according to the Bible, we

00:18:10.279 --> 00:18:13.079
see this truth within the Great Commission.

00:18:13.079 --> 00:18:18.040
But then let's look at practically what it looks like in the book of Acts.

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:21.200
Turn over, if you will, the book of Acts, the second chapter, and I'm going to look

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:27.200
specifically, the first example that we're going to use is the church in Jerusalem.

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:29.040
The church in Jerusalem.

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:34.960
Now we understand that as we would have the opportunity to look here at this church in

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:41.099
Jerusalem and we'd understand that that's where they had started and that's where they

00:18:41.099 --> 00:18:45.219
had the opportunity to be able to see a great number of things.

00:18:45.219 --> 00:18:47.299
They were very familiar with that area.

00:18:47.299 --> 00:18:53.500
And Jesus had said before his ascension, but ye shall receive power after that the Holy

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:59.260
Ghost has come upon you and ye shall be witnesses unto me, both in Jerusalem, that's where

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:02.460
we start, Judea, Samaria, the uttermost.

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:04.700
But we find that it begins in Jerusalem.

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:09.840
And so on the day of Pentecost in Acts chapter number two, Peter stands up and he's preaching.

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:12.859
Of course, he's giving the truth of the gospel.

00:19:12.859 --> 00:19:16.380
We don't have time to look at the message that he preaches, but I want you to notice

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:24.580
in verse 41, the Bible says, then they that gladly received his word.

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:27.539
I believe that that's salvation.

00:19:27.539 --> 00:19:34.279
As Peter preached the gospel, they that gladly received his word, they were saved by the

00:19:34.279 --> 00:19:40.020
grace of God, because it then says, and were baptized, right?

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:43.020
And so they received the word, they were saved and they were baptized.

00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:47.179
We see no instance in the scriptures where somebody is baptized.

00:19:47.179 --> 00:19:49.760
No infants are ever baptized in the Bible.

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:51.239
You cannot find it.

00:19:51.239 --> 00:19:53.340
There are no children, infants that are baptized.

00:19:53.340 --> 00:20:00.080
We find that those that are baptized are always those that have trusted Christ as their savior.

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:06.000
That's why we refer to it as believer's baptism by immersion.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.640
And so when we look at the truth of the Philippian jailer, some people try to twist that thing

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:12.720
out of its context.

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:17.520
When Paul says, believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved and thy house,

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:20.880
and they say, oh, so if somebody gets saved, they ought to baptize all their kids so that

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:21.880
they can be saved.

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:25.520
That is not what Paul is teaching in that passage of scripture.

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:30.400
He's saying that the same way you get saved is the same way anybody in your house would

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:33.520
get saved by believing on the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:37.280
And so we see that the Bible says they gladly received his word.

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:38.280
They were baptized.

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:45.760
Notice, in the same day, there were added unto them about 3,000 souls.

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:52.660
And verse number 42, they continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship and

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:54.320
in breaking of bread and in prayers.

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:58.420
And notice in verse 42, discipleship.

00:20:58.420 --> 00:20:59.700
They're growing.

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:02.760
They continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine.

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:07.020
Notice in verse 47, it says, praising God and having favor with all the people.

00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:10.820
Notice this, and the Lord, who?

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:18.120
The Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.

00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:19.900
And so God was working.

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:25.700
We again look at the promise recorded, and we look at those fundamental truths with regard

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:31.700
to that promise that Jesus said, I will build my church, that he's the head of the church,

00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:34.160
and that he is also the one that gives the increase.

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:38.440
And now we look at the process, Peter stood up and preached.

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:42.720
And we find that souls were saved, and they were baptized, and they were added to the

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:43.720
church.

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:49.240
And the Lord, he added to the church daily such as should be saved.

00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:55.220
And so we see here in Jerusalem, specifically on the day of Pentecost, this growth.

00:21:55.220 --> 00:22:01.020
Turn over to chapter five, if you will, and we're still here in Jerusalem, in chapter

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:02.020
number five.

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:06.620
And we see in verse number 12, the Bible says, and by the hands of the apostles were many

00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:11.260
signs and wonders wrought among the people, and they were all with one accord in Solomon's

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:12.260
porch.

00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:16.540
And of the rest, there's no man joined himself to them, but the people magnified them.

00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:21.280
Notice in verse 14, and believers were the more added to the Lord.

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:26.000
Notice it says multitudes, both of men and women.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:31.040
We find that the church in Jerusalem is growing.

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:33.120
Why is the church in Jerusalem growing?

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:36.280
We talk about numeric and also spiritual growth.

00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:40.900
We find that they're growing numerically because the gospel's being preached.

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:44.440
If the gospel's not being preached, people aren't being exposed to the gospel.

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:46.680
They're not trusting Christ as their Savior.

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:49.020
There's no growth in a church.

00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:50.100
Amen?

00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:54.740
And so as the gospel is being preached, as they're faithfully doing what God had commanded

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:59.340
them to do, people are being saved, they're being baptized, they're being added to the

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:04.460
church, they're being discipled, there's spiritual growth.

00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:07.860
Those people that are being discipled, those people that are growing spiritually, you know

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:08.860
what they're doing?

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:10.680
They're going out and they're preaching the gospel.

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:15.020
They're going out and they're telling people about Jesus and they're sharing the gospel.

00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:19.460
As we've dealt with over the last three weeks, they're telling people, just like I'm encouraging

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:23.460
that we would tell people, can I tell you what Jesus has done for me?

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:25.480
Can I tell you how the Lord changed my life?

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:30.860
Can I tell you how he saved my soul, how he gave me hope and peace and joy?

00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:36.820
Because he changed me, he saved me, I was born again, and what a joy that is.

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:42.400
And so we see the process revealed here in the church in Jerusalem.

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:43.800
We see these couple of references.

00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:48.760
There are a number of other references that we could look to, but as we begin to see this

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:52.120
promise recorded, but then there's a process.

00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:56.680
The disciples were faithfully doing what they were commanded to do.

00:23:56.680 --> 00:24:03.840
They were not just sitting around and waiting for some kind of movement, no, they were out

00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:08.380
preaching and God was using the preaching of his word.

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:13.940
The Holy Spirit was convicting individuals of their need for Christ and the church was

00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:15.020
growing.

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:22.020
There are estimates that the church at Jerusalem potentially reached a size of nearly 100,000

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:23.020
people.

00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:28.860
Now scholars, biblical scholars have various ideas and opinions with regard to the actual

00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:34.480
number, but it is of interest that in the day of Pentecost, it says there were 3,000

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:35.480
souls.

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:40.100
After the situation at the gate, beautiful there, when that man that was lame was healed,

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:42.720
it says that there were 5,000 added.

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:48.960
And then the Bible stops giving us numbers, it says multitude, and then it says multitudes.

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:54.040
And obviously if God wanted to give us the exact number, he could have, but we see that

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:58.160
there was growth in the church in Jerusalem.

00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:04.240
It was not simply numeric growth, but we see also that it was spiritual growth as they

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:07.840
continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine.

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:14.240
They were discipling the individuals that they had seen trust Christ as their savior

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:17.880
and that they had had the opportunity to baptize them.

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:22.080
We find that as we continue to study through the book of Acts, you have the opportunity

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:27.800
to see how the persecution intensifies and it kind of reaches this high point, if you

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:32.200
will, in Acts chapter number seven with the stoning of Stephen.

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:37.800
And we find that Stephen is stoned and we find that during that situation, he had preached

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:39.160
a wonderful message.

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:46.600
He knew the Old Testament, he was able to very effectively preach and God brought conviction

00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:50.920
upon those individuals and they stoned him and he died.

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:56.200
The Bible tells us that they laid his clothes there at a man's feet by the name of Saul

00:25:56.200 --> 00:26:01.920
and we find that the persecution intensifies in chapter number eight.

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:06.000
But the Bible says something interesting in Acts chapter number eight and it's worth our

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:11.000
mentioning in verse number four, it says, therefore, they that were scattered abroad

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:18.440
went everywhere, notice what it says, preaching the word.

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:20.360
Those that were scattered, why were they scattered?

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:23.120
Were they were scattered because of the persecution?

00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:28.520
Because of the enemy and the opposition, the adversity, and they tried to really silence

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:35.840
the believers in Jerusalem, but they that were scattered abroad went everywhere preaching

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:37.680
the word.

00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:40.400
You find in Acts eight that they're in Samaria.

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:44.920
You find that as you continue throughout the entirety of the book of Acts, you eventually

00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:50.080
get to the uttermost and you find that they're preaching the gospel to the known world.

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:56.040
What a blessing to consider the obedience, to understand the process that is revealed

00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:57.040
to us in the scriptures.

00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:02.240
I'm going to take two examples, obviously there are a number of churches that are described

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:05.920
or detailed to us in the New Testament and I'm going to take two examples.

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:09.120
I'm going to start first with the church in Thessalonica.

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:12.640
Take your Bibles, if you will, and turn over to Acts chapter number 17.

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:17.480
Of course, many of us would be familiar with the fact that during, there in chapter number

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:22.480
13 is the first missionary journey, the second missionary journey, there's a third missionary

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:26.480
journey, and how that on those missionary journeys, what were they doing?

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:32.000
They were sending Paul and whoever was on his team, they were sending them out to preach

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:39.400
the gospel, to baptize those that were believers, that trust at Christ, and then to disciple

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:40.400
them.

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:46.440
And this is a pattern that we're going to see repeated in every time as they go to a

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:53.120
new city, to a new region, they preach the gospel, people are saved, they're baptized,

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:58.160
they're added to the church, they're discipled, and thus a church grows.

00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:03.920
Many of these churches, obviously the churches are established, right, the starting, the

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:07.000
founding of these churches, and then there's the growth.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:12.280
In Acts chapter 17, I'm going to use the example here of the church in Thessalonica.

00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:16.920
The Bible tells us in verse number one, now, when they had passed through Ampipholus and

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:24.520
Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews.

00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:30.160
And Paul, as his matter was, by the way, if you want to do a study, you study that phrase,

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:37.320
it's a great phrase, and be able to see the way in which the apostle Paul did ministry.

00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:45.119
He went in unto them and three Sabbath days reasoned with them, notice what it says, out

00:28:45.119 --> 00:28:47.400
of the scriptures.

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:48.480
So what is Paul doing?

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:51.380
He gets to Thessalonica and he begins to preach.

00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:52.799
What is he preaching?

00:28:52.799 --> 00:28:59.360
Verse three, opening and alleging that Christ must needs have suffered and risen again from

00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:05.880
the dead, and that this Jesus whom I preach unto you is Christ.

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:06.880
What is he doing?

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:09.559
He's doing exactly what we're talking about, this process.

00:29:09.559 --> 00:29:14.720
He gets to Thessalonica, he goes to the synagogue, he begins to reason with them out of the scriptures.

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:19.360
If you look back at some of the other instances in which Paul is traveling on these missionary

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:22.960
journeys, on the first missionary journey, he gets to the synagogue and he's sitting

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:25.119
there and they say, does anyone have anything to say?

00:29:25.119 --> 00:29:27.040
Oh, what a great opportunity.

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:30.160
And Paul's like, yeah, he stands up and he begins to preach.

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:35.799
And we find here in Thessalonica for three Sabbath days, the Bible says, so we assume

00:29:35.799 --> 00:29:40.320
we understand this, that he's there for just a short period of time, about three weeks,

00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:42.119
that he's preaching the gospel.

00:29:42.119 --> 00:29:47.119
He's opening and alleging that Christ must needs have suffered and risen again from the

00:29:47.119 --> 00:29:48.119
dead.

00:29:48.119 --> 00:29:49.119
Isn't that the gospels we preach?

00:29:49.119 --> 00:29:51.920
The death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:56.760
The burial isn't mentioned here specifically in that term, but we see that he suffered,

00:29:56.760 --> 00:30:00.119
he was dead, and he rose from the dead, obviously.

00:30:00.119 --> 00:30:02.599
we understand the burial is inferred here.

00:30:02.599 --> 00:30:04.599
And he says, whom I preach unto you,

00:30:04.599 --> 00:30:08.719
this Jesus, excuse me, whom I preach unto you is Christ.

00:30:08.719 --> 00:30:11.579
Well, what was the truth all the way back in Matthew 16?

00:30:12.919 --> 00:30:15.119
Whom do ye say that I am?

00:30:15.119 --> 00:30:19.619
Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.

00:30:19.619 --> 00:30:20.759
Who is Jesus?

00:30:20.759 --> 00:30:24.259
Well, he is the Christ, the anointed one, the Messiah.

00:30:24.259 --> 00:30:27.619
They knew who Jesus the man was.

00:30:27.619 --> 00:30:30.779
There were people in Israel that were familiar with Jesus.

00:30:30.779 --> 00:30:32.419
Whom do men say that I am?

00:30:32.419 --> 00:30:36.059
Well, John the Baptist, Elijah, Jeremiah,

00:30:36.059 --> 00:30:39.299
one of the prophets, but whom say ye that I am?

00:30:39.299 --> 00:30:43.299
Thou art the Christ, the anointed one, the Messiah,

00:30:43.299 --> 00:30:44.499
the Son of God.

00:30:44.499 --> 00:30:49.419
And here Paul is preaching the same thing

00:30:49.419 --> 00:30:53.579
that Peter declared when Jesus asked the question

00:30:53.579 --> 00:30:57.539
that thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.

00:30:58.259 --> 00:31:00.219
And so we find that Jesus said upon this rock,

00:31:00.219 --> 00:31:04.179
upon that statement, that truth that was declared,

00:31:04.179 --> 00:31:06.379
I will build my church

00:31:06.379 --> 00:31:08.419
and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.

00:31:08.419 --> 00:31:11.579
So it would make sense as you study the scriptures

00:31:11.579 --> 00:31:15.979
that as Paul goes out and he is preaching the gospel

00:31:15.979 --> 00:31:19.019
and he's faithfully doing what God had told him to do,

00:31:19.019 --> 00:31:21.399
that there's a church that's being built,

00:31:21.399 --> 00:31:23.859
being established, growing.

00:31:24.699 --> 00:31:28.779
All right, we see that here in Acts chapter number 17.

00:31:28.779 --> 00:31:32.139
We notice as we look at this truth in Acts 17,

00:31:32.139 --> 00:31:33.939
that after he preaches in verse four,

00:31:33.939 --> 00:31:36.299
and some of them believed and consorted with Paul

00:31:36.299 --> 00:31:39.099
and Silas, one of the devout Greeks, a great multitude,

00:31:39.099 --> 00:31:40.539
and one of the chief women, not a few.

00:31:40.539 --> 00:31:42.779
So there were souls saved.

00:31:42.779 --> 00:31:44.739
We would understand as we've coupled this

00:31:44.739 --> 00:31:46.419
with reading the book of 1 Thessalonians,

00:31:46.419 --> 00:31:48.979
that obviously they were baptized, they were taught.

00:31:48.979 --> 00:31:52.139
Paul talks about what he taught them while he was there.

00:31:52.139 --> 00:31:55.779
And he would follow up by sending Timothy to be there.

00:31:55.779 --> 00:31:58.299
And so we find that the opposition gathers together.

00:31:58.299 --> 00:31:59.499
They run them out of town.

00:31:59.499 --> 00:32:01.899
Paul has to leave and so on and so forth.

00:32:01.899 --> 00:32:03.579
But I want you with the understanding

00:32:03.579 --> 00:32:06.339
of this portion of scripture in Acts 17,

00:32:06.339 --> 00:32:09.519
now turn over to 1 Thessalonians chapter one.

00:32:09.519 --> 00:32:14.179
Because we look at the church and how it's growing

00:32:14.179 --> 00:32:18.819
and we find its start, its initial growth here in Acts 17.

00:32:18.819 --> 00:32:21.979
But as we come to 1 Thessalonians chapter number one,

00:32:22.819 --> 00:32:26.899
we begin to see how this growth continues.

00:32:26.899 --> 00:32:28.619
How does the growth continue?

00:32:30.619 --> 00:32:33.500
In 1 Thessalonians chapter one,

00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:36.419
Paul says this in verse number seven,

00:32:36.419 --> 00:32:39.539
so that ye, so now he's talking about the believers

00:32:39.539 --> 00:32:41.940
in Thessalonica, he had already given truth

00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:44.979
about how they came, actually let me back up and read it.

00:32:44.979 --> 00:32:47.379
In verse number two, we give thanks to God always

00:32:47.379 --> 00:32:49.459
for you all, making mention of you in our prayers,

00:32:49.459 --> 00:32:52.179
remembering without ceasing your work of faith,

00:32:52.179 --> 00:32:54.099
your labor of love, your patience of hope

00:32:54.099 --> 00:32:55.659
in our Lord Jesus Christ,

00:32:55.659 --> 00:32:57.699
and the sight of God and our Father,

00:32:57.699 --> 00:33:00.659
knowing brethren, beloved, your election of God,

00:33:00.659 --> 00:33:04.179
for our gospel came not unto you in word only,

00:33:04.179 --> 00:33:06.539
but also in power and in the Holy Ghost

00:33:06.539 --> 00:33:09.779
and in much assurance, as ye know what manner of men

00:33:09.779 --> 00:33:13.099
ye were, we were among you for your sake.

00:33:13.099 --> 00:33:15.539
And so Paul in verse number five is talking about

00:33:15.539 --> 00:33:18.779
his arrival there in the ministry in Thessalonica

00:33:18.819 --> 00:33:20.819
that we just read in Acts 17,

00:33:20.819 --> 00:33:22.339
and now in verse number six it says,

00:33:22.339 --> 00:33:26.299
and ye became followers of us and of the Lord,

00:33:26.299 --> 00:33:30.179
having received the word in much affliction

00:33:30.179 --> 00:33:33.259
with joy of the Holy Ghost.

00:33:33.259 --> 00:33:34.860
So now these people are saved.

00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:40.299
That's the start of the initial growth

00:33:40.299 --> 00:33:43.419
of the church in Thessalonica.

00:33:43.419 --> 00:33:46.019
How's the church in Thessalonica gonna continue to grow?

00:33:46.019 --> 00:33:48.059
Is the church in Thessalonica gonna grow?

00:33:48.059 --> 00:33:49.699
Is it supposed to grow?

00:33:49.699 --> 00:33:51.539
And so we find in verse number seven

00:33:51.539 --> 00:33:56.019
that Paul then says, so that ye were in samples

00:33:56.019 --> 00:34:00.899
to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia.

00:34:00.899 --> 00:34:03.299
You understand that Paul could not stay in Thessalonica.

00:34:03.299 --> 00:34:04.580
He was run out of town.

00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:05.940
I mean, he had to get out of there.

00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:07.059
They were gonna kill him,

00:34:07.059 --> 00:34:09.739
and we find that there were saved people

00:34:09.739 --> 00:34:11.580
that were left there in Thessalonica,

00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:14.179
and they began to preach the gospel.

00:34:14.179 --> 00:34:16.019
Notice how it's described in verse number eight,

00:34:16.019 --> 00:34:20.059
for from you, from the church in Thessalonica,

00:34:20.059 --> 00:34:23.299
from you sounded out the word of the Lord,

00:34:23.299 --> 00:34:24.660
not only in Macedonia and Achaia,

00:34:24.660 --> 00:34:27.100
but also in every place your faith to God

00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:28.339
were to spread abroad,

00:34:28.339 --> 00:34:30.979
so that we need not to speak anything.

00:34:30.979 --> 00:34:33.459
For they themselves show of us what manner of entering in

00:34:33.459 --> 00:34:37.299
we had unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols

00:34:37.299 --> 00:34:40.820
to serve the living and true God,

00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:42.820
and to wait for his son from heaven,

00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:45.540
whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus,

00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:49.579
which delivered us from the wrath to come.

00:34:49.579 --> 00:34:53.059
And so we find that here we begin to see

00:34:53.059 --> 00:34:56.660
how is the church, the local church in Thessalonica,

00:34:56.660 --> 00:34:58.380
it's a church that was established,

00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:00.579
but now how is that church gonna grow?

00:35:00.579 --> 00:35:03.979
Well, they have to take the responsibility

00:35:03.979 --> 00:35:07.699
to follow the process that God has established

00:35:07.699 --> 00:35:10.940
of preaching the gospel, people get saved,

00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:13.579
they get baptized, they join the church,

00:35:13.579 --> 00:35:16.979
they disciple them, and those people go out

00:35:16.979 --> 00:35:18.979
and they preach the gospel, and guess what's happening?

00:35:18.979 --> 00:35:20.660
The church is growing.

00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:23.179
The church is not only growing numerically,

00:35:23.179 --> 00:35:26.260
but the church is growing spiritually.

00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:29.380
And we find that as you look at the church in Thessalonica,

00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:33.179
we see this numeric growth that would be possible

00:35:33.179 --> 00:35:36.660
because of their vision and their understanding

00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:39.380
of preaching the gospel here in 1 Thessalonians 1,

00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:43.059
but I wanna note for you in 2 Thessalonians 1,

00:35:43.059 --> 00:35:45.019
the spiritual growth that we see

00:35:45.019 --> 00:35:46.619
in the church in Thessalonica.

00:35:47.899 --> 00:35:51.419
I asked the follow-up question by way of introduction,

00:35:51.419 --> 00:35:54.059
not only should a church grow spiritually,

00:35:54.059 --> 00:35:56.540
should a church grow, but I asked this,

00:35:56.540 --> 00:35:59.220
is all growth numeric?

00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:01.820
The answer is no, there should be numeric growth,

00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:04.220
but there should be spiritual growth.

00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:07.459
And by the way, I don't know that we can say

00:36:07.459 --> 00:36:10.100
one is better than the other,

00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:12.699
but spiritual growth is vital.

00:36:13.859 --> 00:36:16.459
It is absolutely imperative

00:36:16.459 --> 00:36:19.419
that God's people are growing spiritually,

00:36:19.419 --> 00:36:22.179
and I believe that as they grow spiritually,

00:36:22.179 --> 00:36:25.699
the byproduct is going to be numeric growth.

00:36:25.699 --> 00:36:27.779
Because as we're growing spiritually,

00:36:27.779 --> 00:36:31.779
we're doing what we're supposed to be doing,

00:36:31.779 --> 00:36:34.859
and therefore the numeric growth comes.

00:36:34.859 --> 00:36:36.579
Does that make sense?

00:36:36.579 --> 00:36:39.579
See, if we learn, if we learn to abide in him,

00:36:39.579 --> 00:36:43.339
if we learn to do, as I'm preaching on Wednesday nights,

00:36:43.339 --> 00:36:45.779
to do what we ought to do,

00:36:45.779 --> 00:36:47.940
then God is going to bless,

00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:50.940
and God is going to add to the church,

00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:52.739
because he's the one that made the promise,

00:36:52.739 --> 00:36:55.540
he's the one that gives the increase.

00:36:55.540 --> 00:36:59.299
And so the spiritual growth is so imperative.

00:36:59.299 --> 00:37:01.299
Remember, Paul says, I believe he wrote

00:37:01.299 --> 00:37:03.859
the book of Hebrews, he says there in Hebrews,

00:37:03.859 --> 00:37:06.820
for in the time that you ought to be teachers,

00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:09.660
you have need that one teach you,

00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:11.579
and it's interesting because he says

00:37:11.579 --> 00:37:14.419
that you need to be taught the basics.

00:37:15.299 --> 00:37:17.899
We find that there was a time

00:37:17.899 --> 00:37:19.380
that they ought to be teachers,

00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:21.139
there should have been spiritual growth,

00:37:21.139 --> 00:37:24.260
but they were, unfortunately they were not growing,

00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:26.299
and Paul really reproves them,

00:37:26.299 --> 00:37:28.299
rebukes them because of that.

00:37:28.299 --> 00:37:30.419
But we find here in 2 Thessalonians 1,

00:37:30.419 --> 00:37:32.619
notice in verse number three,

00:37:32.619 --> 00:37:36.940
Paul says this, we are bound to thank God always

00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:39.579
for you, brethren, as it is meat.

00:37:39.579 --> 00:37:42.540
Notice what he says, because your faith,

00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:47.220
because that your faith groweth exceedingly.

00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:51.380
He doesn't say your numbers are growing exceedingly,

00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:54.100
he says your faith groweth exceedingly.

00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:58.100
Then notice this, in the charity of every one of you all

00:37:58.100 --> 00:38:01.619
toward each other aboundeth.

00:38:02.619 --> 00:38:06.139
The church in Thessalonica, as we take as a model,

00:38:06.139 --> 00:38:07.459
I said we're gonna look at two churches,

00:38:07.459 --> 00:38:09.019
we're out of time, we're gonna look at just the church

00:38:09.019 --> 00:38:12.419
at Thessalonica tonight as our example.

00:38:12.419 --> 00:38:14.100
I was gonna look at the church at Ephesus,

00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:15.859
but we won't have time, you could look at the church

00:38:15.859 --> 00:38:19.019
at Philippi as well, but you notice specifically here

00:38:19.019 --> 00:38:22.540
as we use this example of how a church is to grow

00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:26.579
according to the Bible, the process was followed.

00:38:26.579 --> 00:38:31.579
Paul ends up in a city, he goes to the synagogue,

00:38:31.699 --> 00:38:35.260
he preaches the gospel, people get saved,

00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:37.700
they're baptized, they're discipled,

00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:40.940
those people then are going out and telling other people

00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:44.219
about Jesus, the church is growing numerically,

00:38:44.219 --> 00:38:47.219
those believers in the church are being discipled

00:38:47.219 --> 00:38:51.099
and they're growing spiritually because their faith

00:38:51.099 --> 00:38:54.260
groweth exceedingly, their charity or love

00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:57.460
toward one another aboundeth, there's this growth

00:38:57.460 --> 00:39:00.339
that's taking place spiritually among the people

00:39:00.339 --> 00:39:04.339
in the church in Thessalonica and God is at work.

00:39:05.359 --> 00:39:08.520
Let me remind you and we'll study it in a few weeks

00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:13.099
on Sunday morning, in 2 Timothy chapter number two,

00:39:13.099 --> 00:39:16.679
in 2 Timothy chapter two and verse number two,

00:39:16.679 --> 00:39:20.679
and this is again if we could summarize the process

00:39:20.679 --> 00:39:23.859
that is revealed to us in God's word with regard

00:39:23.859 --> 00:39:27.520
to how a church grows according to the Bible.

00:39:27.799 --> 00:39:30.440
In 2 Timothy two and verse number one,

00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:32.440
Paul says, thou therefore my son,

00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:35.839
be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.

00:39:35.839 --> 00:39:39.719
And the things that thou hast heard of me

00:39:39.719 --> 00:39:44.440
among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men

00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:48.799
who shall be able to teach others also.

00:39:48.799 --> 00:39:51.839
Do you see the perpetuity in this verse of scripture

00:39:51.839 --> 00:39:53.599
where Paul says, listen Timothy,

00:39:53.599 --> 00:39:55.960
you've heard some things from me

00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:57.599
and the things that you've heard from me,

00:39:57.599 --> 00:40:00.239
those same things you need to teach to others.

00:40:00.239 --> 00:40:05.239
these faithful men, and as you teach it to these faithful men,

00:40:05.239 --> 00:40:08.239
they then will be able to teach it to others.

00:40:08.239 --> 00:40:12.239
Wow. You think about the propagating of the gospel

00:40:12.239 --> 00:40:14.239
and the responsibility that we have,

00:40:14.239 --> 00:40:17.239
and you see the growth in a church.

00:40:17.239 --> 00:40:19.239
Let me say this.

00:40:19.239 --> 00:40:24.239
There are a lot of ways to get a crowd.

00:40:24.239 --> 00:40:31.239
Getting a crowd is not really the goal.

00:40:31.239 --> 00:40:33.239
If we wanted to get a crowd,

00:40:33.239 --> 00:40:36.239
I'm just going to be extremely blunt this evening,

00:40:36.239 --> 00:40:38.239
if we wanted to get a crowd,

00:40:38.239 --> 00:40:40.239
we would stop using the King James Bible,

00:40:40.239 --> 00:40:42.239
we would get rid of our hymnals,

00:40:42.239 --> 00:40:44.239
we'd get rid of our suits and our ties,

00:40:44.239 --> 00:40:46.239
we'd get rid of our instruments,

00:40:46.239 --> 00:40:49.239
we'd get some drums up here, and so on and so forth,

00:40:49.239 --> 00:40:53.239
we'd change our lighting, we'd change our paint stuff,

00:40:53.239 --> 00:40:57.239
and you can get a crowd.

00:40:57.239 --> 00:40:59.239
You can get a crowd.

00:40:59.239 --> 00:41:05.239
Washington, D.C. is known for having some pitiful sports teams.

00:41:05.239 --> 00:41:07.239
Am I not right?

00:41:07.239 --> 00:41:10.239
Do you know that they still charge like 100 bucks

00:41:10.239 --> 00:41:12.239
to get a ticket to go to the game?

00:41:12.239 --> 00:41:15.239
And they still get people that go.

00:41:15.239 --> 00:41:17.239
Think about the teams that are good.

00:41:17.239 --> 00:41:19.239
They can get a crowd.

00:41:19.239 --> 00:41:20.239
They can get a crowd.

00:41:20.239 --> 00:41:21.239
There's a lot of means.

00:41:21.239 --> 00:41:24.239
Listen, when we talk about church growth,

00:41:24.239 --> 00:41:28.239
we're not trying to adopt the corporate mentality

00:41:28.239 --> 00:41:30.239
of how does a church grow.

00:41:30.239 --> 00:41:32.239
We need to do this and we need to do that,

00:41:32.239 --> 00:41:34.239
and if we start at this and if we did that.

00:41:34.239 --> 00:41:38.239
No, God gave us the process,

00:41:38.239 --> 00:41:41.239
and God's process works

00:41:41.239 --> 00:41:46.239
because God's process is tied to God's promise,

00:41:46.239 --> 00:41:51.239
and God's promise is that I will build my church

00:41:51.239 --> 00:41:55.239
and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.

00:41:55.239 --> 00:41:59.239
We find today that as we seek to answer this question,

00:41:59.239 --> 00:42:03.239
how does a church grow according to the Bible?

00:42:03.239 --> 00:42:07.239
I hope that we first recognize that God has given us a promise

00:42:07.239 --> 00:42:09.239
and that growth is not just numeric,

00:42:09.239 --> 00:42:11.239
though it includes numeric growth,

00:42:11.239 --> 00:42:14.239
growth is also spiritual.

00:42:14.239 --> 00:42:18.239
And as we take and apply the truth,

00:42:18.239 --> 00:42:21.239
the process that God has revealed to us in his word,

00:42:21.239 --> 00:42:25.239
just as we have seen the church at Jerusalem

00:42:25.239 --> 00:42:27.239
and the church in Thessalonica,

00:42:27.239 --> 00:42:33.239
we see churches that are growing numerically and spiritually.

00:42:33.239 --> 00:42:37.239
We often would refer to the church in Thessalonica this way.

00:42:37.239 --> 00:42:41.239
They were a model church.

00:42:41.239 --> 00:42:42.239
Why were they a model church?

00:42:42.239 --> 00:42:43.239
They weren't a perfect church.

00:42:43.239 --> 00:42:45.239
There's no perfect church, but they were a model church.

00:42:45.239 --> 00:42:46.239
Why?

00:42:46.239 --> 00:42:50.239
Well, because they took the truth that God had given to them

00:42:50.239 --> 00:42:55.239
and they applied the truth and they worked it out

00:42:55.239 --> 00:42:57.239
and they reached people with the gospel

00:42:57.239 --> 00:43:00.239
and they had a church that was growing numerically

00:43:00.239 --> 00:43:03.239
and a church that was growing spiritually.

00:43:03.239 --> 00:43:05.239
And to God be the glory.

00:43:05.239 --> 00:43:09.239
I'm thankful that the church is God's church.

00:43:09.239 --> 00:43:11.239
It is.

00:43:11.239 --> 00:43:15.239
I'm thankful to be a part of, a member of a local church,

00:43:15.239 --> 00:43:17.239
to have an opportunity to serve in the capacity

00:43:17.239 --> 00:43:21.239
that God would give us the opportunity to serve him.

00:43:21.239 --> 00:43:25.239
And we desire to see a church that's growing.

00:43:25.239 --> 00:43:31.239
But we must follow the process that God has given to us.

00:43:31.239 --> 00:43:34.239
We must go forth preaching the gospel

00:43:34.239 --> 00:43:38.239
as we see souls saved, baptizing them and discipling them.

00:43:38.239 --> 00:43:41.239
And as we engage in teaching and discipleship

00:43:41.239 --> 00:43:43.239
that those that are being trained and equipped

00:43:43.239 --> 00:43:48.239
are able to go out and duplicate, multiply

00:43:48.239 --> 00:43:50.239
what we are seeking to do.

00:43:50.239 --> 00:43:52.239
So I hope tonight that that answers the question,

00:43:52.239 --> 00:43:55.239
how does a church grow according to the Bible?

00:43:55.239 --> 00:44:00.239
And I hope that we would be instruments in God's hand

00:44:00.239 --> 00:44:03.239
that God would be able to use to see his church,

00:44:03.239 --> 00:44:07.239
this church, our church grow for his honor and for his glory.

00:44:07.239 --> 00:44:08.239
Let's pray together.

00:44:08.239 --> 00:44:09.239
Father, we love you.

00:44:09.239 --> 00:44:10.239
We do thank you for loving us.

00:44:10.239 --> 00:44:13.239
We thank you for the opportunity that we have to serve you.

00:44:13.239 --> 00:44:17.239
We thank you for your word and for the truth contained therein.

00:44:17.239 --> 00:44:20.239
I thank you for this question that was submitted

00:44:20.239 --> 00:44:23.239
and for the opportunity that we have to study,

00:44:23.239 --> 00:44:24.239
to examine the scriptures,

00:44:24.239 --> 00:44:27.239
to see the promise that's recorded for us

00:44:27.239 --> 00:44:31.239
and to then analyze the process that is revealed to us

00:44:31.239 --> 00:44:34.239
that was incorporated by the early church,

00:44:34.239 --> 00:44:36.239
the church in Jerusalem, in Thessalonica.

00:44:36.239 --> 00:44:38.239
We could look at Philippi and Ephesus as well,

00:44:38.239 --> 00:44:41.239
and we could look at seeing how those churches grew,

00:44:41.239 --> 00:44:43.239
not only numerically, but spiritually.

00:44:43.239 --> 00:44:46.239
And I pray, God, that you would help us

00:44:46.239 --> 00:44:48.239
to be doers of the word and not hearers only.

00:44:48.239 --> 00:44:50.239
Help us to grow spiritually.

00:44:50.239 --> 00:44:52.239
Help us, Lord, to grow numerically.

00:44:52.239 --> 00:44:54.239
Help us to honor and glorify thee.

00:44:54.239 --> 00:44:56.239
We'll thank you for it in Christ.

00:44:56.239 --> 00:44:57.239
And we pray, would you stand with me?

00:44:57.239 --> 00:44:58.239
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

00:44:58.239 --> 00:45:00.239
And we're gonna have a moment of invitation.

00:45:00.239 --> 00:45:02.239
Kimberly's gonna play quietly on the piano.

00:45:02.239 --> 00:45:05.239
And as she does, the altar is open.

00:45:05.239 --> 00:45:07.239
