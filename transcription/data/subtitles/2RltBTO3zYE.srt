1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,339
that God would keep our hearts fixed upon Him, amen?

2
00:00:03,339 --> 00:00:05,539
And our hearts and our minds,

3
00:00:05,539 --> 00:00:07,679
we thank the Lord for the opportunity to be here.

4
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:10,119
Take your Bible, if you will, the book of Hebrews

5
00:00:10,119 --> 00:00:12,000
and we'll begin in the 12th chapter,

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,380
but I'll let you know right at the beginning of the message,

7
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,639
we're going to take a journey through the book of Hebrews.

8
00:00:17,639 --> 00:00:20,680
And so I trust that it will be a blessing to this morning.

9
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,600
If you've already looked at the back of the bulletin,

10
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,260
I've titled the message this morning,

11
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:27,719
Consider Christ, Consider Christ.

12
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:30,440
As you look at here at Hebrews chapter 12,

13
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,159
as you're turning there, just a reminder, of course,

14
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:37,279
we've placed this year an emphasis on the greatness of God.

15
00:00:37,279 --> 00:00:39,500
I'm so thankful for the theme

16
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,080
that God has given us for this year.

17
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,400
Great is the Lord and greatly to be praised

18
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,119
and we serve a great God.

19
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:48,400
And the Psalmist said, I know that the Lord is great

20
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,240
and yet without contradiction also declared

21
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,500
that His greatness is unsearchable.

22
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,459
And I'm thankful that though God has revealed to us

23
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:02,060
in the written precious word of God that He is great,

24
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,540
our minds cannot fully comprehend

25
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:07,620
just how great our God is.

26
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:10,180
And as we have placed an emphasis,

27
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:14,180
concentrated effort this year on placing the emphasis

28
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,360
on the truth that our God is great,

29
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,620
I believe that as we've looked through the scriptures

30
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,919
that we have found that God has declared His greatness

31
00:01:21,919 --> 00:01:24,019
and He has told us, I am great.

32
00:01:24,019 --> 00:01:25,860
He is a great God.

33
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,739
There's none like Him.

34
00:01:27,739 --> 00:01:29,940
He's also demonstrated His greatness.

35
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:32,739
I'm thankful that as you read through the pages

36
00:01:32,739 --> 00:01:35,260
of this precious book, that you have the privilege

37
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:38,580
of not only seeing that He's declared that He is great,

38
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:43,300
but the many ways in which He's demonstrated His greatness.

39
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:47,860
I believe this morning that as you and I are more aware of,

40
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:51,419
as we are gaining a greater understanding

41
00:01:51,419 --> 00:01:54,940
of how great our God is, that it should lead us

42
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:58,139
to a place that we stand in awe of Him,

43
00:01:58,139 --> 00:02:00,620
that we truly worship Him as He is,

44
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,639
that we truly give Him the honor and the glory

45
00:02:03,639 --> 00:02:06,220
that is due unto His wonderful name,

46
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:09,139
because we recognize how great He is.

47
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:11,460
I believe that His greatness not only should cause

48
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:14,139
each of us to stand in awe of who He is,

49
00:02:14,139 --> 00:02:17,740
but it should impact how we live our lives.

50
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,500
We've had the opportunity throughout this year

51
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,720
on Sunday mornings to deal with the demonstration

52
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,639
of God's greatness and understanding

53
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:30,600
through the scriptures how God has revealed to us

54
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,160
how great He is, and then we have spent some time

55
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,320
over the Sunday morning series of understanding

56
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,800
those that have declared God's greatness.

57
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,279
They've understood it, and now they're declaring

58
00:02:43,279 --> 00:02:47,240
how great God is, but over the next several weeks

59
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,720
as we close out the year, I want you to focus

60
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,600
on how God's greatness will impact our lives.

61
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,199
And I believe this morning that there's a number of areas,

62
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:00,000
and we'll look at them in more detail as we go

63
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,100
throughout the remainder of this calendar year

64
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,080
as to how it will impact our lives,

65
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,440
really the idea of living in light of His greatness.

66
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,800
And I serve a great God, and you serve a great God,

67
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,679
and I'm so thankful that He has given us

68
00:03:16,679 --> 00:03:20,600
the opportunity to know just how great He is.

69
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:23,720
As we kind of transition into that thought

70
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,679
throughout the remainder of the year,

71
00:03:25,679 --> 00:03:28,839
God has brought my attention to this passage of scripture

72
00:03:28,839 --> 00:03:30,860
in Hebrews chapter 12.

73
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,440
As we look at this simple phrase in verse number three,

74
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,520
I'll read verses one through three.

75
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,039
The Bible says, consider Him, I've titled the message,

76
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:40,639
consider Christ, but notice what the Bible says

77
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:42,720
beginning in verse number one of Hebrews 12.

78
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,240
Wherefore, seeing we also are compassed about

79
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,119
with so great a cloud of witnesses,

80
00:03:49,119 --> 00:03:51,720
let us lay aside every weight and the sin

81
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,880
which doth so easily beset us,

82
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,160
and let us run with patience the race

83
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,479
that is set before us, looking unto Jesus,

84
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:01,720
the author and finisher of our faith,

85
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,399
who for the joy that was set before Him

86
00:04:03,399 --> 00:04:05,960
endured the cross, despising the shame,

87
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,139
and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.

88
00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:12,360
For consider Him that endured such contradiction

89
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,039
of sinners against Himself,

90
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:18,179
lest ye be wearied and faint in your own minds.

91
00:04:18,179 --> 00:04:21,220
As we look at this thought this morning from Hebrews 12,

92
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,579
and particularly verse number three,

93
00:04:24,579 --> 00:04:26,899
we notice that it's simple instruction.

94
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:29,220
Consider Christ, consider Him.

95
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:33,260
But oh, how impactful this exercise will be

96
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:37,739
in each of our lives as we truly consider Him,

97
00:04:37,739 --> 00:04:39,179
as we truly consider Christ.

98
00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:42,179
The word consider means to think over.

99
00:04:42,179 --> 00:04:43,980
It means to ponder.

100
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,299
I believe that it would not be a far stretch

101
00:04:46,299 --> 00:04:48,339
for us to say this morning that the idea

102
00:04:48,339 --> 00:04:50,940
that is communicated through this word consider

103
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:54,299
is to meditate upon, to really muse upon,

104
00:04:54,299 --> 00:04:57,660
to allow us to really keep our focus

105
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,660
and our attention upon the Lord Jesus Christ.

106
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,339
Notice the end of the verse says this,

107
00:05:01,339 --> 00:05:06,059
lest ye be wearied and faint in your own minds.

108
00:05:06,059 --> 00:05:08,899
No doubt there's the opportunity as we live life,

109
00:05:08,899 --> 00:05:11,059
as we go through all that we go through,

110
00:05:11,059 --> 00:05:13,940
that there are things that are vying for your attention

111
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,140
and my attention, and we can become distracted,

112
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:20,179
and we can get our focus on certain things.

113
00:05:20,179 --> 00:05:22,619
But this morning, we need to consider Christ.

114
00:05:22,619 --> 00:05:23,660
We need to consider Him.

115
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,140
We need to think over, ponder, meditate,

116
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:31,140
muse upon just how wonderful our Savior truly is.

117
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,980
No doubt as we think about this admonition

118
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,779
that is given here in Hebrews chapter 12,

119
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:39,380
it's interesting, obviously the book of Hebrews

120
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,299
has 13 chapters, but as we're near the end of the book,

121
00:05:42,299 --> 00:05:46,000
as the writer of the human penman of the book of Hebrews

122
00:05:46,859 --> 00:05:48,760
is closing out, really getting to the conclusion

123
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,720
of the book, we find that he says consider Him,

124
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,559
consider Christ, really the theme of the book of Hebrews

125
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:58,040
is this, Christ is better, Christ is superior,

126
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,880
Christ is greater, and we begin to look at that theme

127
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,920
through the book of Hebrews, and we find that there are

128
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:06,200
a number of truths that God gives us with regard

129
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,839
to He's greater than the angels, He's greater than Moses,

130
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:10,880
and so on and so forth, and we'll look at a number

131
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,720
of those things, but the author says to these people,

132
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,880
and we understand that the author ultimately

133
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,600
is the Holy Spirit of God, all scripture is given

134
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,279
by inspiration of God, and so God is saying

135
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:24,799
to each of us this morning, by way of preservation

136
00:06:24,799 --> 00:06:29,279
through this portion of scripture, consider Christ.

137
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:33,540
Ponder, think upon, muse, meditate.

138
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:36,359
We sing the song more about Jesus.

139
00:06:36,359 --> 00:06:39,880
Oh, listen, Jesus is the sweetest name I know.

140
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:43,040
There's no one like Him, there's no one like Him.

141
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,239
We begin to think about the Lord Jesus Christ,

142
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:47,640
I mean, no doubt in my mind that there are times

143
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,799
in which you hear the name of Jesus as you're going through,

144
00:06:50,799 --> 00:06:52,920
maybe you hear it in the proper context,

145
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,200
where somebody is rejoicing and lifting up,

146
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,320
exalting the name of Jesus, and how it will

147
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,000
through your soul, there are times in my life,

148
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,359
I'm sure in your life as well, that you'll hear somebody

149
00:07:02,359 --> 00:07:04,760
use the name of Jesus inappropriately,

150
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,640
and oh, how it grieves my heart.

151
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,480
Why?

152
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,760
Because that's my God, that's my Jesus,

153
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,000
that's my Savior, that's my Redeemer,

154
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,399
and oh, how wonderful He is.

155
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:19,880
This morning, as we take this thought of considering Christ,

156
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,040
I really wanna take a journey through the book of Hebrews,

157
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,040
go back to Hebrews chapter number one,

158
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,959
the introduction this morning is far longer

159
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:30,519
than the actual message, though I have four points

160
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:32,480
this morning, we're gonna kinda go through

161
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,920
a whole lot of scripture, and then I'm gonna give you

162
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,559
four points really quickly as we go through

163
00:07:37,559 --> 00:07:40,720
the message this morning, and I want us to consider Christ,

164
00:07:41,679 --> 00:07:42,519
and in Hebrews chapter number one,

165
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:45,559
notice how the Bible begins, what a powerful book

166
00:07:45,559 --> 00:07:48,359
the book of Hebrews is, it begins similarly

167
00:07:48,359 --> 00:07:51,359
to the book of Genesis, in the beginning, God,

168
00:07:51,359 --> 00:07:54,119
and we find here that the Bible tells us in Hebrews one,

169
00:07:54,119 --> 00:07:57,480
God, who at sundry times and in diverse manners,

170
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,920
spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,

171
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:04,160
God used the prophets, there are many good prophets,

172
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,619
we can read of the prophets, and we can see how God

173
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:11,100
used them, and how God communicated truth to his people

174
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,739
through his prophets, yes, there were false prophets,

175
00:08:13,739 --> 00:08:16,260
but we think about the prophets that are being referred to

176
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:20,260
here in verse number one, and God would use those prophets

177
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:24,119
in order to communicate truth, truth with regard

178
00:08:24,119 --> 00:08:28,579
to their current time, truth with regard to future events,

179
00:08:28,579 --> 00:08:31,480
and you find that those prophets are recorded,

180
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,739
a number of them, we have the major and minor prophets

181
00:08:33,739 --> 00:08:36,380
in our Bible, and we still today have the privilege

182
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,140
of being able to read through those prophets,

183
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,979
but notice the Bible says in verse number two,

184
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:45,979
hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son,

185
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,580
notice the Bible says, whom he hath appointed heir

186
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:54,580
of all things, by whom also he made the worlds,

187
00:08:55,059 --> 00:08:56,659
who being the brightness of his glory,

188
00:08:56,659 --> 00:08:58,380
and the express image of his person,

189
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,219
and upholding all things by the word of his power,

190
00:09:01,219 --> 00:09:05,820
when he had by himself purged our sins,

191
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:10,299
sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high.

192
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:13,619
Wow, what an introduction the book of Hebrews gives to us

193
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:15,840
as we read these first three verses,

194
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,820
and in three verses of scripture,

195
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,979
as we consider Christ in the book of Hebrews,

196
00:09:19,979 --> 00:09:24,140
we find that he's the creator, I'm thankful that all things

197
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:26,260
were made by him, and that without him,

198
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,739
there's nothing that was made, the Bible says

199
00:09:28,739 --> 00:09:30,380
in the beginning was the word, and the word was with God,

200
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:33,239
and the word was God, and we find here that he says,

201
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:37,359
by him all things consist, we read Colossians one,

202
00:09:37,359 --> 00:09:40,500
and we read that he is creator, not only the creator,

203
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,080
but the sustainer, notice the Bible says,

204
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,320
that not only did he make the worlds in verse number two,

205
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,880
but in verse number three, upholding all things

206
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,320
by the word of his power.

207
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,039
I'm thankful that our God is the creator,

208
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:55,960
and he's also the sustainer.

209
00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:00,159
I'm thankful that God holds all things together.

210
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:03,499
We find that He is not only Creator and Sustainer,

211
00:10:03,499 --> 00:10:04,999
but He is Redeemer.

212
00:10:04,999 --> 00:10:08,999
And oh, how wonderful it is to know the Redeemer.

213
00:10:08,999 --> 00:10:10,959
The Bible says at the end of verse number three,

214
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:15,959
notice, when He had by Himself purged our sins,

215
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:21,719
notice, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high.

216
00:10:21,719 --> 00:10:24,179
I'm so thankful that in just three verses of Scripture

217
00:10:24,179 --> 00:10:28,559
here in Hebrews 1, that God is giving the truth to us

218
00:10:28,719 --> 00:10:31,759
that the Lord Jesus Christ, He's Creator,

219
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:35,019
He's Sustainer, and He is Redeemer.

220
00:10:35,019 --> 00:10:37,259
You think about the power of creation.

221
00:10:37,259 --> 00:10:38,599
God said, and it was so.

222
00:10:38,599 --> 00:10:41,899
You read the account in Genesis 1 and Genesis 2,

223
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:46,479
and how we are confronted with the power of God,

224
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:51,279
the wisdom of God, and the truth of the power

225
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,899
of upholding all things by the word of His power

226
00:10:53,899 --> 00:10:54,819
in verse number three.

227
00:10:54,819 --> 00:10:58,419
But all this morning, I really am so thankful.

228
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,739
Yes, that He's Creator and Sustainer,

229
00:11:00,739 --> 00:11:03,679
but isn't it wonderful to know that He's the Redeemer?

230
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:05,239
I hope this morning that you know Him

231
00:11:05,239 --> 00:11:07,759
as your personal Redeemer, that you've been saved

232
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:09,999
by the blood of the Lamb, that you know for sure today

233
00:11:09,999 --> 00:11:12,559
without any shadow of a doubt that heaven is your home.

234
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:13,399
Why?

235
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:14,219
Because He is the Redeemer.

236
00:11:14,219 --> 00:11:17,179
Notice it says that He had purged by Himself,

237
00:11:17,179 --> 00:11:18,159
purged our sins.

238
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:18,999
How did He do that?

239
00:11:18,999 --> 00:11:21,499
Through the atonement, through the blood that was shed

240
00:11:21,499 --> 00:11:24,099
on the cross of Calvary, His burial,

241
00:11:24,099 --> 00:11:25,599
and His glorious resurrection.

242
00:11:25,599 --> 00:11:27,979
We'll see some of that as we continue to move forward

243
00:11:27,999 --> 00:11:29,359
through the book of Hebrews.

244
00:11:29,359 --> 00:11:33,079
Notice in chapter number two, beginning in verse number nine,

245
00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:35,559
so we see in chapter one that He's Creator,

246
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:37,959
He's Sustainer, and He is Redeemer.

247
00:11:37,959 --> 00:11:39,839
Notice in chapter number two of the book of Hebrews

248
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,079
in verse number nine, notice the Bible says this,

249
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,399
but we see Jesus, who was made a little lower

250
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:47,519
than the angels for the suffering of death,

251
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,199
crowned with glory and honor, that He, by the grace of God,

252
00:11:52,199 --> 00:11:55,319
should taste death for every man.

253
00:11:55,319 --> 00:11:57,679
I'm thankful that He tasted death for every man.

254
00:11:58,379 --> 00:12:00,939
I'm thankful for the substitutionary atonement

255
00:12:00,939 --> 00:12:01,999
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

256
00:12:01,999 --> 00:12:03,659
Continue looking in verse number 10.

257
00:12:03,659 --> 00:12:06,139
For it became Him for whom are all things

258
00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:09,219
and by whom are all things in bringing many sons

259
00:12:09,219 --> 00:12:11,979
unto glory to make the captain of their salvation

260
00:12:11,979 --> 00:12:13,999
perfect through sufferings.

261
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:17,359
For both He that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified

262
00:12:17,359 --> 00:12:20,999
are all of one, for which cause He is not ashamed

263
00:12:20,999 --> 00:12:22,979
to call them brethren, saying,

264
00:12:22,979 --> 00:12:25,039
I will declare thy name unto my brethren.

265
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:27,179
In the midst of the church will I sing praise

266
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:29,759
unto thee, and again, I will put my trust in Him.

267
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:31,559
And again, behold, I and the children

268
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:33,079
which God hath given me.

269
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:36,319
For as much then as the children are partakers

270
00:12:36,319 --> 00:12:40,119
of flesh and blood, He also Himself likewise

271
00:12:40,119 --> 00:12:40,999
took part of the same.

272
00:12:40,999 --> 00:12:45,299
Notice that through death, He might destroy him

273
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:49,399
that had the power of death, that is the devil.

274
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:52,279
Oh man, I'm so thankful that He's our substitute,

275
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:55,679
but He's the conqueror, He's victorious, He is the victor.

276
00:12:55,699 --> 00:12:57,459
Notice the Bible says that through death,

277
00:12:57,459 --> 00:13:00,379
the death of the cross, He might destroy him

278
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:03,179
that had the power of death, that is the devil.

279
00:13:03,179 --> 00:13:06,419
Notice what He does, He delivers in verse number 15,

280
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:10,619
them who through fear of death were all their lifetime

281
00:13:10,619 --> 00:13:13,339
subject to bondage.

282
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:16,099
You know, I remember when I was lost.

283
00:13:16,099 --> 00:13:17,979
Do you remember when you were lost?

284
00:13:17,979 --> 00:13:19,639
I remember being afraid of dying.

285
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:23,339
I'd heard the gospel, I'd heard the truth

286
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:25,539
that Jesus saves, that there's only one way

287
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,479
to heaven and that's through the Lord Jesus Christ.

288
00:13:27,479 --> 00:13:29,839
I'd heard the truth that if you were to die

289
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,639
without salvation, without the blood being applied

290
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,119
to your account, that you'd spend eternity

291
00:13:34,119 --> 00:13:36,739
in the lake of fire, why, for the wages of sin is death

292
00:13:36,739 --> 00:13:40,599
and I knew I was guilty, but I had not yet

293
00:13:40,599 --> 00:13:42,519
trusted Christ as my savior.

294
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:44,919
Maybe you trusted Christ the very first time

295
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:47,299
you heard the gospel, I did not.

296
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:52,079
I heard the gospel, I didn't get saved right away.

297
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:56,899
I put it off and I remember for weeks

298
00:13:56,899 --> 00:14:00,779
fearing death, knowing that if I were to die,

299
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:03,479
that I'd go to a Christless eternity

300
00:14:03,479 --> 00:14:05,219
because I had not trusted Christ as my savior.

301
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,699
You say, well, why didn't you just trust Christ?

302
00:14:06,699 --> 00:14:07,999
Because I was hard-headed.

303
00:14:11,259 --> 00:14:14,099
I didn't trust Him my first time I heard the gospel,

304
00:14:14,099 --> 00:14:17,499
but oh, I'm so thankful for His pursuit of me.

305
00:14:17,499 --> 00:14:19,739
I'm so thankful for His long-suffering.

306
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:22,159
I'm so thankful that the Holy Spirit of God

307
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:25,439
kept working in my heart and kept convincing me

308
00:14:25,439 --> 00:14:29,079
of truth and convincing me of my own sin.

309
00:14:29,079 --> 00:14:33,279
I was guilty, convincing me that Jesus is the only savior

310
00:14:34,359 --> 00:14:37,079
and I trust that Christ is my savior.

311
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:39,799
And from that day until this, just to be completely honest

312
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:42,779
with you, I don't fear death, why?

313
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:45,479
Because the Bible says, I didn't understand this

314
00:14:45,479 --> 00:14:47,319
immediately at the time, I didn't know

315
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:49,099
Hebrews chapter two at that time,

316
00:14:49,099 --> 00:14:50,899
but the Bible says that He delivered them

317
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:54,139
who through fear of death were all their lifetime

318
00:14:54,139 --> 00:14:57,619
subject to bondage, that was me and that was you.

319
00:14:57,619 --> 00:15:00,499
But now I know that when I die, listen,

320
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:03,079
it doesn't mean that we're anxious for the process,

321
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:05,999
but it just simply means that I have no anxiety

322
00:15:05,999 --> 00:15:08,059
over the fact that I'm going to heaven,

323
00:15:08,059 --> 00:15:11,979
that it's but a doorway, it's but a path, if you will,

324
00:15:11,979 --> 00:15:14,579
through which I will enter into the wonderful presence

325
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:16,779
of my Lord and my savior.

326
00:15:17,119 --> 00:15:19,959
And He delivered me from that, He's my substitute,

327
00:15:19,959 --> 00:15:22,399
He is the victor, notice in verse 16,

328
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,559
for verily He took not on Him the nature of angels,

329
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,319
but He took on Him the seed of Abraham.

330
00:15:30,319 --> 00:15:32,479
He had to come in the likeness of man

331
00:15:32,479 --> 00:15:35,479
in order to die for us, it was not possible

332
00:15:35,479 --> 00:15:39,119
that an angel could die in your place.

333
00:15:39,119 --> 00:15:43,279
Jesus, God in flesh, He came to this sin-cursed world

334
00:15:43,499 --> 00:15:47,659
so that He could redeem them that were under the law.

335
00:15:47,659 --> 00:15:49,779
The Bible says in verse 17, wherefore,

336
00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:52,219
in all things that behooved Him to be made like

337
00:15:52,219 --> 00:15:55,219
unto His brethren, that He might be a merciful

338
00:15:55,219 --> 00:15:58,459
and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God

339
00:15:58,459 --> 00:16:01,219
to make reconciliation for the sins of the people,

340
00:16:01,219 --> 00:16:04,979
for in that He Himself hath suffered being tempted,

341
00:16:04,979 --> 00:16:08,379
He is able to succor them that are tempted.

342
00:16:08,379 --> 00:16:10,819
Oh, listen, we're considering Christ this morning,

343
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:12,759
we're considering Christ this morning,

344
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:14,919
we're looking and we're seeing He's creator,

345
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:18,559
He's sustainer, He's redeemer, He's my substitute,

346
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:21,959
He's victorious, He's the great high priest,

347
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:24,399
we see it introduced here, He's my helper.

348
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,439
That word succor means to help, to come alongside,

349
00:16:27,439 --> 00:16:30,279
He's able to help us that are tempted,

350
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:32,559
He's able to succor them that are tempted.

351
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:34,219
Oh, aren't you thankful for that?

352
00:16:34,219 --> 00:16:36,919
Listen, it's not past you yet, it's not past me yet

353
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:39,839
that we're tempted, amen?

354
00:16:39,859 --> 00:16:42,539
And He is able to help us, He's able to succor.

355
00:16:42,539 --> 00:16:45,619
Notice in chapter four in verse 14, the Bible says this,

356
00:16:45,619 --> 00:16:50,619
seeing then that we have a great high priest

357
00:16:50,899 --> 00:16:53,259
that is passed into the heavens,

358
00:16:53,259 --> 00:16:57,419
Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.

359
00:16:57,419 --> 00:16:59,819
Remember, back in chapter one in verse number three,

360
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:02,639
it told us that He had by Himself purged our sins

361
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,419
but then sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high

362
00:17:05,419 --> 00:17:07,539
and we read in chapter four in verse 14,

363
00:17:07,539 --> 00:17:11,159
the Bible says seeing then we have a great high priest

364
00:17:11,159 --> 00:17:15,599
that is passed into the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God,

365
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:18,199
let us hold fast our profession.

366
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:21,019
For we, verse 15, have not an high priest

367
00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:23,619
which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities

368
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:26,319
but was in all points tempted like as we are,

369
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:30,259
notice this, yet without sin.

370
00:17:30,259 --> 00:17:32,119
You understand when the Lord Jesus Christ

371
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:33,259
and you go through the book of Hebrews,

372
00:17:33,259 --> 00:17:35,759
we won't take time to develop all of it this morning

373
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:37,279
but you understand that when He went

374
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,559
to the cross of Calvary,

375
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,799
He did not have to first make an offering for His own sin.

376
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,119
That's what the high priest had to do in the Old Testament,

377
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:46,719
they first had to enter in

378
00:17:46,719 --> 00:17:49,439
and they had to make atonement for their own sin

379
00:17:49,439 --> 00:17:51,439
and then for the sin of the people

380
00:17:51,439 --> 00:17:55,719
but oh my Savior, my Christ, He's sinless yet without sin

381
00:17:55,719 --> 00:17:58,479
and He did not have to make an offering for Himself

382
00:17:58,479 --> 00:18:02,319
because He's perfect, He's pure, the just for the unjust

383
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:05,739
but He went and He made an offering for you and for me.

384
00:18:05,739 --> 00:18:07,199
The Bible says in verse 16,

385
00:18:07,199 --> 00:18:10,959
let us therefore come boldly under the throne of grace,

386
00:18:10,959 --> 00:18:15,199
the access that's been granted to you and I as His children

387
00:18:15,199 --> 00:18:18,599
because of the work that He did at Calvary

388
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:21,559
that we may obtain mercy and find grace

389
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:23,559
to help in time of need.

390
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:25,839
You ever find yourself in a place of need?

391
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:28,599
Oh, you can come boldly under the throne of grace

392
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:31,359
and the promise is that as you come boldly

393
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:34,519
to the throne of grace, you're able to obtain mercy

394
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:36,119
and you're able to find grace

395
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:39,419
that will help you in that time of need.

396
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:41,039
Some people say, I need help

397
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,699
and you might be thinking that the help that you need

398
00:18:43,699 --> 00:18:45,459
is something specific but God says,

399
00:18:45,459 --> 00:18:47,879
I'll give you the mercy and the grace

400
00:18:47,879 --> 00:18:49,479
that you need in that time

401
00:18:49,479 --> 00:18:52,339
and oh, the help that it will give us.

402
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:55,739
This morning, I'm thankful for the access

403
00:18:55,739 --> 00:18:58,019
that we have through the Lord Jesus Christ.

404
00:18:58,019 --> 00:19:00,559
You understand that we have an access today

405
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,839
that's unlike the Old Testament.

406
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:06,739
As you picture here, these Hebrews,

407
00:19:06,739 --> 00:19:10,479
these that had been raised and exposed to Judaism

408
00:19:10,479 --> 00:19:12,559
but now had trust at Christ

409
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,039
and there's all kinds of things going on

410
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:16,699
in the book of Hebrews with regard to the pull back

411
00:19:16,699 --> 00:19:18,579
to Judaism and all of those things

412
00:19:18,579 --> 00:19:20,179
but you understand in the Old Testament,

413
00:19:20,179 --> 00:19:23,519
they didn't have access like we have access today.

414
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:27,219
We have access to the throne room of heaven.

415
00:19:27,219 --> 00:19:28,359
Oh, how thankful.

416
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:31,879
Notice in chapter five and verse number nine,

417
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:34,599
the Bible tells us again as we consider Christ,

418
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:36,639
notice in chapter five and verse number nine

419
00:19:36,639 --> 00:19:39,619
and being made perfect, he, the Lord Jesus Christ,

420
00:19:39,619 --> 00:19:44,440
he became the author of eternal salvation

421
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,559
unto all them that obey him.

422
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:49,799
Aren't you thankful that he is the author

423
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:51,399
of eternal salvation?

424
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:55,719
I'm thankful as Hebrews 12 in verse one and two

425
00:19:55,719 --> 00:19:57,359
as we referenced earlier,

426
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:00,279
it talks about he's the author and finisher of our.

427
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:06,279
And here the Bible tells us that he is the author, notice, of eternal salvation.

428
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:09,279
Oh, I'm so thankful it's not temporary.

429
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:11,279
I'm so thankful it's not probationary.

430
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:13,279
I'm thankful that it's his work.

431
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:17,279
He's the author, he's the finisher, he's the author of eternal salvation.

432
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:20,279
Notice in chapter 7, in verse number 24.

433
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:24,279
Again, as we think about these believers that are being written to,

434
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:27,279
as we think about the preservation of Scripture for us this morning,

435
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:32,279
and as God has given us his word, he gives us the opportunity to read this admonition,

436
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:36,279
simple instruction in Hebrews 12, in verse number 3,

437
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:39,279
consider him, and I say this morning, consider Christ,

438
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:44,279
that we have the opportunity, as we look just within the book of Hebrews,

439
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:48,279
how exalted and magnified our Savior is.

440
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:51,279
Oh, we could go to so many other passages of Scripture this morning,

441
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:55,279
and so many other references with regard to revealing to us

442
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:58,279
and helping us understand how wonderful our Savior is,

443
00:20:58,279 --> 00:21:03,279
but just within the book of Hebrews, oh, the portrait of Christ is presented to us,

444
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:07,279
and we see him in such an amazing way,

445
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:10,279
that it should have a profound impact on us.

446
00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:13,279
In Hebrews 7, in verse 24, the Bible says,

447
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:16,279
but this man, speaking again of the Lord Jesus Christ,

448
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:19,279
because he continueth ever, aren't you thankful that he's eternal?

449
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:22,279
He has no beginning and no end, he's Alpha and Omega.

450
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:26,279
The Bible says that he hath an unchangeable priesthood.

451
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:29,279
Not only is he eternal, but he's immutable, he never changes,

452
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:32,279
he's the same yesterday, and today, and forever.

453
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:35,279
We'll look at that in chapter 13 here in just a moment,

454
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:39,279
but notice in verse number 25, wherefore, notice he is able

455
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:44,279
also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him.

456
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:46,279
Aren't you thankful that he's able to save?

457
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:49,279
Oh, I'm thankful this morning, what a wonderful promise,

458
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:52,279
as we go and we give the gospel, as we go and share

459
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:55,279
the truth of God's word that Jesus saves,

460
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:58,279
that we can look at Hebrews 7 and verse 25,

461
00:21:58,279 --> 00:22:01,279
and we can be reminded that he's able also to save them

462
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:03,279
to the uttermost that come unto God by him.

463
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:06,279
Listen, there's only one way to be saved, it's through the Lord Jesus Christ.

464
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:09,279
We find that the Bible tells us there's no salvation in any other,

465
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:12,279
there's no other name under heaven, whereby we must be saved.

466
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:14,279
Jesus said, I am the way, the truth, and the life.

467
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:17,279
No man cometh unto the Father but by me.

468
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:19,279
I'm thankful this morning that he's able to save,

469
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:20,279
that I can take that message.

470
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:24,279
Listen, Jesus revealed to us, Peter writes it this way,

471
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:26,279
that the Lord is not slack concerning his promises.

472
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:29,279
Some men count slackness, but is longsuffering to us,

473
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:33,279
not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.

474
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:35,279
I'm thankful this morning that he's able to save,

475
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:37,279
but notice the end of verse 25,

476
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:41,279
seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.

477
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:43,279
Listen, I'm thankful that he lives forever.

478
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:46,279
He was dead, but he rose, conquered sin, death, and the grave.

479
00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:51,279
And he's alive forevermore, is what we're told in the book of Revelation.

480
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:54,279
And we find here that he is our intercessor.

481
00:22:54,279 --> 00:22:58,279
He ever liveth to make intercession for them.

482
00:22:58,279 --> 00:23:00,279
The Bible says in verse 26,

483
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:04,279
For such a high priest became us, who was holy, harmless, undefiled,

484
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:07,279
separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens,

485
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:09,279
who needeth not daily as those high priests

486
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:12,279
to offer up sacrifice first for his own sins,

487
00:23:12,279 --> 00:23:13,279
and then for the people's.

488
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:17,279
For this he did once when he offered up himself.

489
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:20,279
Listen, I'm excited about who Christ is.

490
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:24,279
I'm excited this morning that we serve a wonderful Savior.

491
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:27,279
I'm excited this morning that God has given us,

492
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:31,279
through his word, the revelation of who he is.

493
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:35,279
And as I consider Christ this morning, as you consider Christ,

494
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:37,279
it's going to change our perspective.

495
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:39,279
It's going to change how we live our lives.

496
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:41,279
It should have a profound impact.

497
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:45,279
It's simple instruction, but oh, the impact that it will have

498
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:50,279
as we truly take time to ponder, to consider who Christ is.

499
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:52,279
Notice with me in chapter 9,

500
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:55,279
continuing our journey here through the book of Hebrews.

501
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,279
Hebrews chapter 9.

502
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,279
Look at verse 11, if you will.

503
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:03,279
The Bible says this, in Hebrews 9 and verse 11,

504
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:07,279
But Christ, being come in a high priest of good things to come

505
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,279
by a greater and more perfect tabernacle,

506
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:13,279
not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building,

507
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:16,279
neither by the blood of goats and calves,

508
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:18,279
notice, but by his own blood,

509
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:21,279
he entered in once into the holy place,

510
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:26,279
having obtained eternal redemption for us.

511
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:27,279
Wow.

512
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:31,279
Once again, we're reminded here in these verses in Hebrews 9, 11, 12,

513
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:33,279
and look at verse 14 as well.

514
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,279
How much more shall the blood of Christ,

515
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:39,279
who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God,

516
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:43,279
purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?

517
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,279
I'm thankful that he's my substitute,

518
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:49,279
that he made this sacrifice once and for all.

519
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,279
We'll see that in chapter 10 as well.

520
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,279
But notice the end of verse number 12,

521
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:58,279
having obtained eternal redemption for us.

522
00:24:58,279 --> 00:25:01,279
We saw already in Hebrews 5, in verse 9,

523
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:05,279
how the Bible says that he's the author of eternal salvation.

524
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:08,279
And now we see here in Hebrews 9 and verse number 12

525
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:11,279
that he's obtained eternal redemption for us.

526
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,279
How? By his blood.

527
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:16,279
Listen, if you remove the blood, you got nothing.

528
00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:19,279
People today attacking the blood of Christ, attacking the blood.

529
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:22,279
Listen, you understand this morning that without the shedding of blood,

530
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:25,279
Hebrews tells us there's no remission for sins.

531
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:28,279
The Bible says that we are saved through the blood of Christ.

532
00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:31,279
We're not redeemed with corruptible things such as silver and gold.

533
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,279
No, no, no.

534
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:36,279
We're redeemed with the precious blood of Christ.

535
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:40,279
This morning the blood is so important and so significant.

536
00:25:40,279 --> 00:25:43,279
Notice in verse 24 here in chapter 9, the Bible says this,

537
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:47,279
For Christ has not entered into the holy places made with hands,

538
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,279
which are the figures of the true, but into heaven itself,

539
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:53,279
now to appear in the presence of God, notice, for us.

540
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:59,279
Verse 25, nor yet that he should offer himself often

541
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:03,279
as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others.

542
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:07,279
For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world.

543
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:10,279
But now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin

544
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:12,279
by the sacrifice of himself.

545
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:15,279
Listen, it was one offering for sin forever.

546
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,279
We're going to see that plainly in chapter 10.

547
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:21,279
Listen, the Old Testament priests, they had to come every year, right?

548
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:24,279
At the Day of Atonement, they had to come and they had to come.

549
00:26:24,279 --> 00:26:27,279
And of course, the sacrifices and offerings that would be made

550
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:30,279
even between the times of the Day of Atonement,

551
00:26:30,279 --> 00:26:33,279
the 10th chapter talks about daily they were ministering

552
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:38,279
and offering the same sacrifices that could never take away sin.

553
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:41,279
Notice in verse 27, as it appointed unto man once to die,

554
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:42,279
but after this the judgment.

555
00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:45,279
And then notice verse 28, for Christ was once offered

556
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,279
to bear the sins of many.

557
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:51,279
And unto them that look for him, notice, shall he appear the second time

558
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,279
without sin unto salvation.

559
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:57,279
Again, we're reminded that he's the substitute.

560
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,279
It's a recurring theme through the book of Hebrews.

561
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,279
But I'm looking here in verse 28 of Hebrews 9.

562
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:03,279
Listen, he's coming again.

563
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:06,279
I'm thankful for that wonderful truth, that wonderful promise.

564
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:10,279
So many today are asking questions about world events

565
00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:13,279
and what's going on and what's this and what do you mean of that

566
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:14,279
and so on and so forth.

567
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:17,279
Understand this morning, it just reminds us that Jesus is coming,

568
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,279
that things are falling into place.

569
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:24,279
We see prophecy unfolding before our very eyes and Jesus is coming.

570
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:27,279
Do not get distracted with all the things that are going on.

571
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:31,279
Keep our mind focused on the task that God has given us,

572
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:33,279
redeeming the time for the days are evil.

573
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:35,279
We understand, listen, the time is short.

574
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,279
Jesus is coming.

575
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:40,279
And oh, what a glorious, wonderful truth it is.

576
00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:43,279
But you understand this morning that when that trumpet sounds,

577
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,279
and I believe it will sound soon,

578
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:48,279
that there's no more opportunity for you to share the gospel

579
00:27:48,279 --> 00:27:49,279
with your loved one.

580
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:51,279
There's no more opportunity for you to share the gospel

581
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:54,279
with your neighbor or your coworker or whomever it might be.

582
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:57,279
Now is the time.

583
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:59,279
Listen, Jesus is coming.

584
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,279
Aren't you thankful this morning?

585
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,279
Consider Christ.

586
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:06,279
He's the sinless, pure Lamb of God.

587
00:28:06,279 --> 00:28:09,279
He took my place on the cross of Calvary.

588
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:10,279
He lives right now.

589
00:28:10,279 --> 00:28:12,279
I mean, He's alive and He's interceding for us

590
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:15,279
and He's aware of what's going on.

591
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:17,279
He's able to help us.

592
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:21,279
We have access to His throne and we find that He's coming back for us.

593
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,279
Oh, what precious truth.

594
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:26,279
Notice in chapter 10,

595
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:28,279
in a wonderful portrait that God gives us

596
00:28:28,279 --> 00:28:31,279
in the book of Hebrews of our wonderful Savior.

597
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,279
Hebrews 10, in verse number 10, knows what the Bible says.

598
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:38,279
By the witch will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ.

599
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:40,279
Notice this phrase, once for all.

600
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:42,279
Aren't you thankful for that?

601
00:28:42,279 --> 00:28:44,279
In fact, there's a song that we sing, once for all.

602
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:45,279
Praise the Lord.

603
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:50,279
Verse number 11, and every priest standeth daily ministering and offering

604
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:54,279
oftentimes the same sacrifices, which could never take away sins.

605
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:57,279
You look at the Old Testament and you look at all of that process

606
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:00,279
in the Levitical system and all that they went through.

607
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:02,279
Yes, it was ordained by God,

608
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:05,279
but you understand that it was pointing to Messiah

609
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:09,279
who would one day come, Christ our Passover.

610
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:12,279
And we find that He fulfilled all of that.

611
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:14,279
And the Bible tells us in verse number 12,

612
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:16,279
but this man, the Lord Jesus Christ,

613
00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:19,279
oh, aren't you thankful for your Savior this morning.

614
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:24,279
After He'd offered one sacrifice for sins forever,

615
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:28,279
sat down on the right hand of God.

616
00:29:28,279 --> 00:29:31,279
He sat down because His work was complete.

617
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:34,279
Remember what He said on the cross of Calvary?

618
00:29:34,279 --> 00:29:37,279
It is finished.

619
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:40,279
And then He gave up the ghost.

620
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:43,279
He said, Father, the hour is come.

621
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,279
In John chapter number 17,

622
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:49,279
He knew that it was exactly why He came to this earth.

623
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:51,279
He understood the plan.

624
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:53,279
He's the author of eternal salvation.

625
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,279
And He came and He fulfilled.

626
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:59,279
And we find that here again in Hebrews 10 and verse 12,

627
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,279
how thankful He is.

628
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:03,279
of we are for this sacrifice that was made,

629
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,919
verse 13, from henceforth expecting

630
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:07,879
till his enemies be made his footstool.

631
00:30:07,879 --> 00:30:10,519
Notice again in verse 14, for by one offering

632
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:14,859
he hath perfected forever them that are sanctified.

633
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:16,959
Listen, I'm thankful this morning

634
00:30:16,959 --> 00:30:19,819
for the truth of sanctification.

635
00:30:19,819 --> 00:30:22,639
And when you understand the biblical teaching,

636
00:30:22,639 --> 00:30:25,599
as you understand what God has revealed to us

637
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:29,179
positionally this morning, when we understand

638
00:30:29,179 --> 00:30:31,819
what happened at that day when you trust

639
00:30:31,819 --> 00:30:34,179
at Christ as your savior, the Bible says

640
00:30:34,179 --> 00:30:36,659
that we're sanctified positionally.

641
00:30:36,659 --> 00:30:38,339
Now I understand there's a truth

642
00:30:38,339 --> 00:30:40,259
that God gives us in his word with regard

643
00:30:40,259 --> 00:30:43,879
to what we might refer to as progressive sanctification,

644
00:30:43,879 --> 00:30:46,459
that as we live, we're to live daily

645
00:30:46,459 --> 00:30:48,479
in light of his commands and we're to become

646
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:51,019
more and more like our savior.

647
00:30:51,019 --> 00:30:52,979
He has determined in Romans 8, 29

648
00:30:52,979 --> 00:30:56,099
that we are to be conformed to the image of his dear son.

649
00:30:56,099 --> 00:30:58,499
And we understand that truth, but I'm thankful

650
00:30:58,499 --> 00:31:00,699
to be sanctified, to be set apart,

651
00:31:00,699 --> 00:31:05,699
to have that positional standing with God.

652
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:08,459
Listen, we speak about the imputed righteousness

653
00:31:08,459 --> 00:31:10,459
for he hath made him to be sin for us

654
00:31:10,459 --> 00:31:12,619
who knew no sin that we might be made

655
00:31:12,619 --> 00:31:16,579
the righteousness of God through him and in him.

656
00:31:16,579 --> 00:31:17,919
And you think about the truth

657
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:20,719
that I am positionally sanctified.

658
00:31:20,719 --> 00:31:23,839
I am righteous because his righteousness

659
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:26,419
has been imputed upon me.

660
00:31:26,419 --> 00:31:28,259
Here in the same chapter, in chapter 10,

661
00:31:29,019 --> 00:31:31,019
notice in verse 19, having therefore brethren,

662
00:31:31,019 --> 00:31:33,699
notice it says boldness to enter

663
00:31:33,699 --> 00:31:35,739
into the holiest, how?

664
00:31:35,739 --> 00:31:37,059
By the blood of Jesus.

665
00:31:37,059 --> 00:31:39,779
We mentioned already in Hebrews 4 in verse 16

666
00:31:39,779 --> 00:31:42,219
about that access, but it says this in verse 20,

667
00:31:42,219 --> 00:31:45,979
by a new and living way which he hath consecrated

668
00:31:45,979 --> 00:31:50,819
for us through the veil, that is to say his flesh.

669
00:31:50,819 --> 00:31:53,379
And having a high priest, in verse number 21,

670
00:31:53,379 --> 00:31:56,179
over the house of God, let us draw near

671
00:31:56,179 --> 00:31:58,579
with a true heart and full assurance of faith,

672
00:31:58,579 --> 00:32:01,099
having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience

673
00:32:01,099 --> 00:32:04,359
and our bodies washed with pure water.

674
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:07,279
Oh, I'm thankful for the access that we have.

675
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:08,979
I'm thankful that we can draw near.

676
00:32:08,979 --> 00:32:11,859
Notice it says, it references there in verse number 20

677
00:32:11,859 --> 00:32:13,659
by a new and a living way.

678
00:32:13,659 --> 00:32:15,679
And then it talks about the veil.

679
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:17,779
Now remember what happened when Jesus

680
00:32:17,779 --> 00:32:19,939
went on the cross of Calvary at the temple there.

681
00:32:19,939 --> 00:32:21,739
There was a veil that separated.

682
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:24,219
Again, remember the tabernacle and the temple.

683
00:32:24,219 --> 00:32:27,539
There was the outer, then there was the holy place,

684
00:32:27,539 --> 00:32:29,459
and then there's the holy of holies.

685
00:32:29,459 --> 00:32:31,779
And that holy of holies could only be accessed

686
00:32:31,779 --> 00:32:33,499
once a year on the day of atonement,

687
00:32:33,499 --> 00:32:35,579
and you better go with blood,

688
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:39,099
otherwise you would die in that holy of holies.

689
00:32:39,099 --> 00:32:41,419
And the priest would go in, the high priest,

690
00:32:41,419 --> 00:32:43,839
on that day of atonement, and there were bells

691
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:47,259
at the bottom of his garment so that they could hear

692
00:32:47,259 --> 00:32:49,259
that he's ministering as he's in there

693
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:50,759
and applying the blood.

694
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:53,379
And you find that at the time of Christ's death

695
00:32:53,419 --> 00:32:54,859
that what happened to that veil,

696
00:32:54,859 --> 00:32:57,659
well, it was rent in twain.

697
00:32:57,659 --> 00:33:00,939
The Bible tells us from the top to the bottom.

698
00:33:02,579 --> 00:33:04,779
We find these as a new and a living way

699
00:33:05,739 --> 00:33:07,519
that he hath consecrated for us through the veil.

700
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:11,819
That is to say his flesh, he's given us access.

701
00:33:13,099 --> 00:33:15,999
There's one God and one mediator between God and man,

702
00:33:15,999 --> 00:33:18,779
the man, Christ Jesus.

703
00:33:19,659 --> 00:33:21,619
Listen, I'm thankful this morning that any time,

704
00:33:21,619 --> 00:33:25,079
any moment, any hour, any minute of the day,

705
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:28,759
you can have access to God.

706
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:30,659
It's a privilege.

707
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:32,019
And that access is being given to us.

708
00:33:32,019 --> 00:33:34,899
Listen, it's a privilege for the child of God.

709
00:33:34,899 --> 00:33:36,539
If you've been born again this morning,

710
00:33:36,539 --> 00:33:38,539
if you've been saved by the blood of Christ,

711
00:33:38,539 --> 00:33:40,779
you have access to the throne room of heaven.

712
00:33:42,539 --> 00:33:44,819
Notice the Bible tells us in chapter 10

713
00:33:44,819 --> 00:33:47,679
in verse number 37, for yet a little while.

714
00:33:48,939 --> 00:33:51,179
I don't know how long a little while is,

715
00:33:51,739 --> 00:33:54,299
but a little while today is less than a little while was

716
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:57,979
when the book was written, amen.

717
00:33:57,979 --> 00:34:00,059
For yet a little while.

718
00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:03,619
And he that, notice what it says, shall come.

719
00:34:03,619 --> 00:34:07,859
Not he that might come, but he that shall come.

720
00:34:07,859 --> 00:34:12,219
Notice what it says, will come and will not tarry.

721
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:14,099
Oh, I'm looking forward to that day.

722
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:17,739
The trumpet of the Lord shall sound

723
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:20,839
and time shall be no more is what the songwriter said.

724
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:24,599
You find the Bible teaches the imminent return of Christ.

725
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:26,299
No man knows the hour.

726
00:34:26,299 --> 00:34:29,139
Many have attempted over the years,

727
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:33,339
some even still today attempting to give a timeline,

728
00:34:33,339 --> 00:34:35,679
a date in which the Lord will return.

729
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,479
No man knows the hour.

730
00:34:37,479 --> 00:34:39,979
But I'm thankful this morning to know the truth

731
00:34:39,979 --> 00:34:41,919
that Jesus is coming again.

732
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:43,619
He's coming for us.

733
00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:44,859
What a blessing.

734
00:34:44,859 --> 00:34:47,599
Notice in chapter 12, we've read the verses already.

735
00:34:48,459 --> 00:34:51,699
In chapter 12, the Bible says in verse number two,

736
00:34:51,699 --> 00:34:56,539
looking, looking unto Jesus,

737
00:34:56,539 --> 00:35:00,139
the author, the finisher of our faith,

738
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:04,019
who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross,

739
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:06,079
despising the shame,

740
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:10,119
and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.

741
00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:13,359
For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners

742
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:14,719
against himself,

743
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:18,019
lest you be wearied and faint in your minds.

744
00:35:19,219 --> 00:35:21,659
There are three other truths in the 13th chapter

745
00:35:21,659 --> 00:35:23,419
that I wanna draw our attention to

746
00:35:25,299 --> 00:35:29,019
with regard to this truth of consider Christ.

747
00:35:29,019 --> 00:35:32,699
In chapter 13, in verse five, the Bible says,

748
00:35:32,699 --> 00:35:36,139
let your conversation be without covetousness

749
00:35:36,139 --> 00:35:39,279
and be content with such things as you have.

750
00:35:39,279 --> 00:35:43,239
For he hath said, I will never leave thee nor forsake thee.

751
00:35:43,239 --> 00:35:45,499
Aren't you thankful for that Bible promise?

752
00:35:45,499 --> 00:35:47,659
His presence is with us.

753
00:35:47,659 --> 00:35:49,099
In verse number six, the Bible says,

754
00:35:49,099 --> 00:35:52,839
so that we may boldly say, the Lord is my helper,

755
00:35:52,839 --> 00:35:57,219
and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.

756
00:35:57,219 --> 00:35:59,679
Aren't you thankful that the Lord is your helper?

757
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:02,579
The Bible already told us as we look back

758
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:05,179
in the fourth chapter that he's able to,

759
00:36:05,179 --> 00:36:06,159
excuse me, the second chapter,

760
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:09,079
he's able to succor them which are tempted.

761
00:36:09,079 --> 00:36:10,399
He's our helper.

762
00:36:10,399 --> 00:36:12,459
And we find that the Bible says that the Lord is my helper.

763
00:36:12,539 --> 00:36:14,219
I will not fear what man shall do unto me.

764
00:36:14,219 --> 00:36:15,919
Listen, when I understand who he is,

765
00:36:15,919 --> 00:36:17,719
when I understand the power that he possesses,

766
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:21,319
he said, all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.

767
00:36:21,319 --> 00:36:22,759
He spoke and it was so.

768
00:36:22,759 --> 00:36:25,719
He upholds all things by the power of his word.

769
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:30,239
And the Bible says that he is your helper, he's my helper.

770
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:32,139
The psalmist said it this way in Psalm 121.

771
00:36:32,139 --> 00:36:33,959
I will lift up mine eyes into the hills

772
00:36:33,959 --> 00:36:35,199
from whence cometh my help.

773
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:39,379
My help cometh from the Lord, which made heaven and earth.

774
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:43,039
We find in verse number eight here of Hebrews 13,

775
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:44,599
the Bible says Jesus Christ,

776
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:48,539
the same yesterday and today and forever.

777
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:51,339
He's immutable, he never changes.

778
00:36:51,339 --> 00:36:54,379
By the way, I am thankful for that Bible doctrine,

779
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:56,159
that Bible truth.

780
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:58,159
You know, if God changed,

781
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:00,599
we wouldn't know how to approach him day by day.

782
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:02,919
I believe that the immutability of God,

783
00:37:02,919 --> 00:37:05,719
if I could use this expression to explain it this morning,

784
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:08,799
is kind of like the glue that holds it all together

785
00:37:08,819 --> 00:37:10,819
in the sense that yes, God is holy,

786
00:37:10,819 --> 00:37:13,139
God's revealed that, God is great, God is just,

787
00:37:13,139 --> 00:37:16,219
he's merciful, he's loved, he's so on and so forth,

788
00:37:16,219 --> 00:37:19,499
but he's immutable, he never changes.

789
00:37:19,499 --> 00:37:23,379
And so when God revealed to the prophets of old,

790
00:37:23,379 --> 00:37:26,859
to his servants of old, his abilities and his nature,

791
00:37:26,859 --> 00:37:29,579
his attributes, we find that still today,

792
00:37:29,579 --> 00:37:32,539
that's the same God that we serve.

793
00:37:32,539 --> 00:37:33,979
What joy that is.

794
00:37:33,979 --> 00:37:36,619
Notice in verse 20 of chapter 13,

795
00:37:36,619 --> 00:37:37,459
the Bible says,

796
00:37:37,459 --> 00:37:40,999
now the God of peace that brought again from the dead,

797
00:37:40,999 --> 00:37:43,799
our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep

798
00:37:43,799 --> 00:37:45,679
through the blood of the everlasting covenant,

799
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:48,679
make you perfect in every good work to do his will,

800
00:37:48,679 --> 00:37:51,799
working in you that which is well-pleasing in his sight

801
00:37:51,799 --> 00:37:56,719
through Jesus Christ to whom be glory forever and ever.

802
00:37:56,719 --> 00:37:57,799
Amen.

803
00:37:57,799 --> 00:38:00,959
Notice with me from Hebrews 13 verses 20 and 21,

804
00:38:00,959 --> 00:38:04,679
that he is that great shepherd of the sheep.

805
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:07,059
I'm so thankful that the Lord is my shepherd.

806
00:38:07,059 --> 00:38:09,979
We find great comfort in reading the words of Psalm 23.

807
00:38:09,979 --> 00:38:11,819
It's a familiar Psalm, the Lord is my shepherd,

808
00:38:11,819 --> 00:38:13,059
I shall not want.

809
00:38:13,059 --> 00:38:15,659
And we can look through the whole six verses of that Psalm

810
00:38:15,659 --> 00:38:18,099
and how we can be comforted and encouraged,

811
00:38:18,099 --> 00:38:21,059
but we find here in Hebrews 13 and verse 20 and 21,

812
00:38:21,059 --> 00:38:23,139
the Bible speaks about the Lord Jesus Christ

813
00:38:23,139 --> 00:38:25,939
being the great shepherd of the sheep.

814
00:38:25,939 --> 00:38:27,899
I'm thankful that he's my shepherd.

815
00:38:27,899 --> 00:38:30,499
I'm thankful to be within his fold, aren't you?

816
00:38:30,499 --> 00:38:32,779
And this morning, listen, if you're not been born again,

817
00:38:32,779 --> 00:38:35,959
if you've not trusted Christ as your personal savior,

818
00:38:35,959 --> 00:38:39,119
then he's not yet your shepherd, but he wants to be.

819
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:41,319
He desires to be.

820
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,479
He's a good shepherd.

821
00:38:42,479 --> 00:38:43,959
He's the great shepherd.

822
00:38:43,959 --> 00:38:45,839
The Bible tells us in 1 Peter chapter five

823
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:48,439
that he's the chief shepherd and he shall appear.

824
00:38:48,439 --> 00:38:51,119
And we find this morning that as we look,

825
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,199
and again, there's so many other passages

826
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:54,019
that we could look through,

827
00:38:54,019 --> 00:38:56,359
even within the book of Hebrews this morning,

828
00:38:56,359 --> 00:38:59,839
but as we've taken this journey through the book of Hebrews,

829
00:38:59,899 --> 00:39:02,739
we've taken the instruction, this admonition

830
00:39:02,739 --> 00:39:05,839
from Hebrews 12 and verse number three, consider him.

831
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:08,479
I've said it this way, consider Christ.

832
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:12,679
What a portrait, what a wonderful savior.

833
00:39:12,679 --> 00:39:14,739
He's the creator, the sustainer, the redeemer.

834
00:39:14,739 --> 00:39:15,679
He's my substitute.

835
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:16,899
He's the great high priest.

836
00:39:16,899 --> 00:39:19,859
He's the author of eternal salvation.

837
00:39:19,859 --> 00:39:21,019
He's the intercessor.

838
00:39:21,019 --> 00:39:22,659
He's coming again.

839
00:39:22,659 --> 00:39:23,939
Aren't you thankful for that?

840
00:39:23,939 --> 00:39:27,139
He's granted me access, the author and finisher of my faith.

841
00:39:27,139 --> 00:39:28,939
He's my helper.

842
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:33,079
He is immutable and he is my great shepherd.

843
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:36,159
This morning, as we truly consider Christ,

844
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:38,679
I told you the introduction was longer than the message,

845
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:41,199
but when we truly think over, ponder,

846
00:39:41,199 --> 00:39:45,359
when we really meditate and muse upon who Christ is

847
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:48,879
and who he is to us, when I consider Christ,

848
00:39:48,879 --> 00:39:52,079
wow, what a wonderful savior.

849
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:54,359
But how does it impact us?

850
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:56,279
Four simple thoughts this morning.

851
00:39:56,279 --> 00:39:58,199
I'm not gonna spend much time on it.

852
00:39:58,199 --> 00:40:01,379
The hour is late, but four thoughts this morning.

853
00:40:01,379 --> 00:40:05,299
that I hope will help us as we consider Christ.

854
00:40:05,299 --> 00:40:11,939
Listen, the truth of God's Word is not supposed to just be a mental understanding, a mental

855
00:40:11,939 --> 00:40:14,419
understanding of who He is.

856
00:40:14,419 --> 00:40:18,139
It's supposed to impact how we live our lives.

857
00:40:18,139 --> 00:40:21,339
I understand how wonderful He is from what we've just looked at this morning.

858
00:40:21,339 --> 00:40:26,999
I can't understand, I can't fully comprehend how wonderful and how great He really is,

859
00:40:26,999 --> 00:40:31,179
but I'm thankful that He's given us the ability to understand at some level how great

860
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:33,599
He is, but how does it impact us?

861
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:38,059
Number one this morning, I believe when we consider Christ that we will love Him more

862
00:40:38,059 --> 00:40:41,679
fervently, that we will love Him more fervently.

863
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:44,539
Isn't He lovable?

864
00:40:44,539 --> 00:40:46,919
We understand that God is love.

865
00:40:46,919 --> 00:40:54,379
We understand that John said it this way, that we love Him because He first loved us.

866
00:40:54,379 --> 00:41:02,399
We sing the song, oh, how I love Jesus, and I believe that when we truly consider Christ

867
00:41:02,399 --> 00:41:05,339
that we will love Him more fervently.

868
00:41:05,339 --> 00:41:10,519
He told us that if we love Him that we're to keep His commandments.

869
00:41:10,519 --> 00:41:13,959
That's the evidence, if you will, of our love for Him.

870
00:41:13,959 --> 00:41:18,439
Listen, people today, making a claim is simple.

871
00:41:18,439 --> 00:41:23,899
We can say that we love Jesus, but does the evidence support the claim?

872
00:41:23,919 --> 00:41:29,039
This morning, when we truly consider who Christ is, when we truly ponder and meditate and

873
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:34,119
use, think over, and understanding how wonderful He is, I believe this morning it will result

874
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:36,979
in us loving Him more fervently.

875
00:41:36,979 --> 00:41:42,159
Number two, I believe that it will result in us serving Him more faithfully.

876
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:43,999
Serving Him more faithfully.

877
00:41:43,999 --> 00:41:47,639
When we understand that we're serving Christ, we think about all that He's done for us.

878
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:54,299
We think about all that He is, all of these things, again, just from the book of Hebrews.

879
00:41:54,299 --> 00:41:57,499
So many other portions of scripture that we could go to this morning, but just from the

880
00:41:57,499 --> 00:42:02,579
book of Hebrews to these original recipients that were told, consider Him, that as you

881
00:42:02,579 --> 00:42:08,459
look at all of these promises and all of these wonderful truths that were revealed to them,

882
00:42:08,459 --> 00:42:12,899
it should result in them loving Him more fervently, but also serving Him more faithfully.

883
00:42:12,899 --> 00:42:16,299
You know, it's a privilege to serve the Lord.

884
00:42:16,299 --> 00:42:22,399
We sing the song, there's joy in serving Jesus, and there really is.

885
00:42:22,399 --> 00:42:28,719
The psalmist talked about being a doorkeeper in the house of God, and listen, there's no

886
00:42:28,719 --> 00:42:34,739
task, when you think about being a servant of the Lord, there's no task that's too low.

887
00:42:34,739 --> 00:42:39,279
It's a privilege to serve the Lord Jesus Christ.

888
00:42:39,279 --> 00:42:44,879
And when I truly consider Him, I will not only love Him more fervently, but I will serve

889
00:42:44,879 --> 00:42:48,039
Him more faithfully.

890
00:42:48,039 --> 00:42:50,699
What is it that God wants me to do?

891
00:42:50,699 --> 00:42:52,899
What place does He want me in?

892
00:42:52,899 --> 00:42:56,079
What is it that I could do for Jesus?

893
00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:00,239
Not so that I could earn His favor, not so that I could earn His love, not so that I

894
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:05,539
could have, no, no, because I love Him, I want to serve Him, because I understand how

895
00:43:05,539 --> 00:43:11,119
wonderful He is, and I understand how, the greatness of who He is, and I want to serve

896
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:12,459
Him more faithfully.

897
00:43:12,459 --> 00:43:16,979
Let me say this, number three, I'll speak of Him more passionately.

898
00:43:16,979 --> 00:43:22,179
You know, when we truly understand how great He is, when we truly consider Christ, it'll

899
00:43:22,179 --> 00:43:24,059
impact how we talk about Him.

900
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:26,179
We'll speak of Him more passionately.

901
00:43:26,179 --> 00:43:29,999
Let me tell you about my God, let me tell you about my Savior, let me tell you how wonderful

902
00:43:29,999 --> 00:43:30,999
He is.

903
00:43:30,999 --> 00:43:36,319
See, there's a people that we live in the midst of today that simply do not know the

904
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:38,699
things that we've looked at this morning.

905
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:42,059
For some of us this morning that are here, maybe some of the things that you've heard

906
00:43:42,059 --> 00:43:45,759
this morning, you've heard them for the very first time, but maybe for some that are here

907
00:43:45,759 --> 00:43:50,539
this morning, you've heard this over and over, you're aware of this, you could have come

908
00:43:50,539 --> 00:43:54,659
to the same conclusions and looked at the same references, and you understand the greatness

909
00:43:54,659 --> 00:43:55,659
of God.

910
00:43:55,659 --> 00:44:00,739
But when we truly consider Him, we should speak of Him more passionately.

911
00:44:00,739 --> 00:44:05,019
Let me tell you about my God, let me tell you about what Jesus did for me, let me tell

912
00:44:05,019 --> 00:44:10,339
you how He changed my life, let me tell you how He's my helper.

913
00:44:11,099 --> 00:44:16,099
How do you handle the troubles and the trials of life, how do you continue on in the midst

914
00:44:16,099 --> 00:44:18,059
of great turmoil?

915
00:44:18,059 --> 00:44:20,659
Because Jesus is my helper.

916
00:44:20,659 --> 00:44:24,579
I'm not doing it at my own strength, I'm not doing it at my own power, the trials will

917
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:30,859
come and the storms will arise, but Jesus is my helper.

918
00:44:30,859 --> 00:44:33,219
And I speak of Him more passionately, why?

919
00:44:33,219 --> 00:44:35,999
Because I know Him.

920
00:44:35,999 --> 00:44:40,679
We should be gaining in our knowledge of Him day by day, we should never be content

921
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:44,959
with the place that we're at, we should say as Paul said, that I may know Him and the

922
00:44:44,959 --> 00:44:46,599
power of His resurrection.

923
00:44:46,599 --> 00:44:50,799
And we ought to say as we look at the truth of God's Word, that as we know these things

924
00:44:50,799 --> 00:44:54,239
that I'm going to speak of Him more passionately.

925
00:44:54,239 --> 00:45:00,719
Listen, I think you would agree with me this morning that there are some things that are

926
00:45:00,719 --> 00:45:08,319
spoken of in our society today that are spoken of with great passion that are just false.

927
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:15,439
There's just no truth in what the cause is that the people are speaking about passionately.

928
00:45:15,439 --> 00:45:17,119
Can I get a witness, amen?

929
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:19,159
Would you agree with that this morning?

930
00:45:19,159 --> 00:45:25,439
But listen, we serve the living Christ, we serve the King of kings and Lord of lords,

931
00:45:25,439 --> 00:45:30,039
we know that He's true, we know that He's righteous, we know that He's the Redeemer,

932
00:45:30,039 --> 00:45:34,479
and we ought to speak of Him with great passion.

933
00:45:34,479 --> 00:45:38,819
He said, I am with you, we don't have to fear.

934
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:42,719
Remember the truth of Hebrews 13, we looked at it a moment ago, so that we might boldly

935
00:45:42,719 --> 00:45:48,259
say the Lord is my helper, I will not fear what man shall do unto me.

936
00:45:48,259 --> 00:45:53,879
This morning, when we truly consider Christ, we'll love Him more fervently, we'll serve

937
00:45:53,879 --> 00:45:59,119
Him more faithfully, we'll speak of Him more passionately, and I believe this, number four,

938
00:45:59,199 --> 00:46:04,199
we will obey Him continuously, we'll obey Him continuously.

939
00:46:04,199 --> 00:46:09,359
I'm not speaking of sinless perfection, I'm just simply speaking of a life that's marked

940
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:13,279
by obedience, because I'm considering Christ.

941
00:46:13,279 --> 00:46:18,959
See, the example of Christ, according to what Peter said, he left us an example that we

942
00:46:18,959 --> 00:46:20,839
should follow his steps.

943
00:46:20,839 --> 00:46:26,399
According to what John says, that he obeyed always.

944
00:46:26,399 --> 00:46:32,399
He was obedient unto death, even the death of the cross, we read in the book of Philippians.

945
00:46:32,399 --> 00:46:39,759
And this morning, you know that the life of a believer should be marked by obedience?

946
00:46:39,759 --> 00:46:42,979
Your life and my life should be marked by obedience.

947
00:46:42,979 --> 00:46:47,719
It ought not be that the life of a believer is marked by disobedience.

948
00:46:47,719 --> 00:46:53,779
If the life of a believer is marked by disobedience, I would say they've not yet considered Christ.

949
00:46:53,779 --> 00:46:59,259
They have a small view of Jesus, but we have a proper view of who He is.

950
00:46:59,259 --> 00:47:00,259
Think about Isaiah.

951
00:47:00,259 --> 00:47:04,819
He saw God high, holy, and lifted up, his train filled the temple, he says, woe is me.

952
00:47:04,819 --> 00:47:07,699
And then he says, here am I, send me, I mean, what do you want me to do?

953
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:13,059
I will go, I will go, I will do, I will serve.

954
00:47:13,059 --> 00:47:19,099
A life marked by obedience, that's what our lives should be marked by.

955
00:47:19,099 --> 00:47:26,259
When we truly consider Christ, when we see Him for who He is, when we understand what

956
00:47:26,259 --> 00:47:31,739
we've looked at this morning, and we've pondered, we've meditated, listen, I hope every day

957
00:47:31,739 --> 00:47:33,939
of your life that you consider Christ.

958
00:47:33,939 --> 00:47:36,619
This isn't just a one-time event, it's not just a one-time thing.

959
00:47:36,619 --> 00:47:39,859
Listen, every day in your prayer life, you ought to be rejoicing and thanking God for

960
00:47:39,859 --> 00:47:40,859
who He is.

961
00:47:40,859 --> 00:47:44,099
You ought to get in your Bible and you ought to understand these attributes that we've

962
00:47:44,099 --> 00:47:48,579
looked at this morning, and as you understand these attributes, thank God for them and stand

963
00:47:48,579 --> 00:47:53,819
in light of who He is and see how it will impact our lives.

964
00:47:53,819 --> 00:48:00,079
It's simple instruction, consider Christ, but the exercise is impactful.

965
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:05,399
And as we truly consider Christ, I believe that this morning we'll love Him more fervently,

966
00:48:05,399 --> 00:48:10,139
we will serve Him more faithfully, we will speak of Him more passionately, and we will

967
00:48:10,139 --> 00:48:13,259
live lives that are marked by obedience.

968
00:48:13,259 --> 00:48:15,659
We will obey Him continuously.

969
00:48:15,739 --> 00:48:22,939
I hope this morning that as you would survey your own life, you would evaluate, examine,

970
00:48:22,939 --> 00:48:25,619
you'd say, how's my love for Jesus?

971
00:48:25,619 --> 00:48:31,139
How's my service to the King?

972
00:48:31,139 --> 00:48:35,299
How am I speaking of Him and for Him?

973
00:48:35,299 --> 00:48:38,739
How's my obedience?

974
00:48:38,739 --> 00:48:43,939
This morning, the remedy might simply be, consider Christ.

975
00:48:43,939 --> 00:48:48,859
You say, my love's kind of, you know what they said in Ephesus, Jesus said, John wrote,

976
00:48:48,859 --> 00:48:52,219
you've left your first love, right?

977
00:48:52,219 --> 00:48:56,539
Revelation chapter 2, I have somewhat against you, right?

978
00:48:56,539 --> 00:48:59,539
You left your first love.

979
00:48:59,539 --> 00:49:04,219
I know your works, He says to those churches, their service.

980
00:49:04,219 --> 00:49:08,579
Listen, sometimes the remedy for some of those things, you say, man, I examine my life and

981
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:13,739
I consider Christ, and I believe it will come into focus, and we'll be able to serve

982
00:49:13,739 --> 00:49:18,019
Him and love Him and speak of Him and obey Him the way that we should.

983
00:49:18,019 --> 00:49:19,019
Let's pray.

984
00:49:19,019 --> 00:49:20,019
Father, we love You.

985
00:49:20,019 --> 00:49:22,499
We thank You for loving us.

986
00:49:22,499 --> 00:49:25,579
I know this morning that we looked at a lot of Scripture.

987
00:49:25,579 --> 00:49:31,739
God, we want to get a portrait of our Savior.

988
00:49:31,739 --> 00:49:35,579
This morning, we want to consider Christ.

989
00:49:35,579 --> 00:49:42,579
I pray that as we've looked at these Scriptures, we've impacted our lives.

990
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:54,379
Lord, I pray that we would love You, serve You, speak of You, and obey You as we should.

991
00:49:54,379 --> 00:49:59,379
I pray that our lives would be marked by obedience, not by disobedience.

992
00:49:59,379 --> 00:50:01,339
Lord, I pray that if there's...

993
00:50:01,339 --> 00:50:08,579
some deficiency in our lives in any of those areas that we would consider Christ. I pray

994
00:50:08,579 --> 00:50:16,379
God that we'd, as the songwriter said, turn your eyes upon Jesus. That we'd see you in

995
00:50:16,379 --> 00:50:22,539
all of your fullness and all of your glory. The things of this world will grow strangely

996
00:50:22,539 --> 00:50:31,199
dim in the light of your glory and grace. Lord, I pray if there's one here this morning

997
00:50:31,199 --> 00:50:35,479
that's not saved, they've never trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal Savior.

998
00:50:35,479 --> 00:50:40,999
Oh God, I pray that today would be the day of their salvation. You said that today is

999
00:50:40,999 --> 00:50:47,399
the day of salvation. No man knoweth what a day would bring forth. Boast not thyself

1000
00:50:47,399 --> 00:50:53,239
of tomorrow. Oh, if there's one that needs to be saved, I pray that you would draw them

1001
00:50:53,239 --> 00:50:56,959
to yourself. That we'd have the opportunity to take a Bible and show them how they can

1002
00:50:56,959 --> 00:51:03,159
know for sure that heaven is their home. No more hoping or wishing, but knowing with

1003
00:51:03,159 --> 00:51:08,479
assurance that heaven is their home. Why? Because you are the Savior. You're the substitute,

1004
00:51:08,479 --> 00:51:13,639
the Redeemer. Oh God, I pray for your children this morning. I pray that you'd help each

1005
00:51:13,639 --> 00:51:22,519
and every one of us to consider you. Lord, help that time of meditation, of pondering

1006
00:51:22,519 --> 00:51:26,799
to have a profound impact on how we live our lives. Would you work in these moments

1007
00:51:26,799 --> 00:51:30,799
of invitation as only you can. We'll be careful to give you the honor and glory for all that

1008
00:51:30,799 --> 00:51:33,279
you'll do. For it's in Christ's name we pray. Would you stand with me?
