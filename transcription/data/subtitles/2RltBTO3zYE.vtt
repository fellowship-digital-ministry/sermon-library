WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.339
that God would keep our hearts fixed upon Him, amen?

00:00:03.339 --> 00:00:05.539
And our hearts and our minds,

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:07.679
we thank the Lord for the opportunity to be here.

00:00:07.679 --> 00:00:10.119
Take your Bible, if you will, the book of Hebrews

00:00:10.119 --> 00:00:12.000
and we'll begin in the 12th chapter,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.380
but I'll let you know right at the beginning of the message,

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.639
we're going to take a journey through the book of Hebrews.

00:00:17.639 --> 00:00:20.680
And so I trust that it will be a blessing to this morning.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.600
If you've already looked at the back of the bulletin,

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.260
I've titled the message this morning,

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.719
Consider Christ, Consider Christ.

00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:30.440
As you look at here at Hebrews chapter 12,

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.159
as you're turning there, just a reminder, of course,

00:00:33.159 --> 00:00:37.279
we've placed this year an emphasis on the greatness of God.

00:00:37.279 --> 00:00:39.500
I'm so thankful for the theme

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.080
that God has given us for this year.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.400
Great is the Lord and greatly to be praised

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.119
and we serve a great God.

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:48.400
And the Psalmist said, I know that the Lord is great

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.240
and yet without contradiction also declared

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.500
that His greatness is unsearchable.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.459
And I'm thankful that though God has revealed to us

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.060
in the written precious word of God that He is great,

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.540
our minds cannot fully comprehend

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.620
just how great our God is.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.180
And as we have placed an emphasis,

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.180
concentrated effort this year on placing the emphasis

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.360
on the truth that our God is great,

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.620
I believe that as we've looked through the scriptures

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.919
that we have found that God has declared His greatness

00:01:21.919 --> 00:01:24.019
and He has told us, I am great.

00:01:24.019 --> 00:01:25.860
He is a great God.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.739
There's none like Him.

00:01:27.739 --> 00:01:29.940
He's also demonstrated His greatness.

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.739
I'm thankful that as you read through the pages

00:01:32.739 --> 00:01:35.260
of this precious book, that you have the privilege

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.580
of not only seeing that He's declared that He is great,

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.300
but the many ways in which He's demonstrated His greatness.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.860
I believe this morning that as you and I are more aware of,

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.419
as we are gaining a greater understanding

00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:54.940
of how great our God is, that it should lead us

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.139
to a place that we stand in awe of Him,

00:01:58.139 --> 00:02:00.620
that we truly worship Him as He is,

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.639
that we truly give Him the honor and the glory

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:06.220
that is due unto His wonderful name,

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.139
because we recognize how great He is.

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:11.460
I believe that His greatness not only should cause

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.139
each of us to stand in awe of who He is,

00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:17.740
but it should impact how we live our lives.

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.500
We've had the opportunity throughout this year

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.720
on Sunday mornings to deal with the demonstration

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.639
of God's greatness and understanding

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:30.600
through the scriptures how God has revealed to us

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.160
how great He is, and then we have spent some time

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.320
over the Sunday morning series of understanding

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.800
those that have declared God's greatness.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.279
They've understood it, and now they're declaring

00:02:43.279 --> 00:02:47.240
how great God is, but over the next several weeks

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.720
as we close out the year, I want you to focus

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.600
on how God's greatness will impact our lives.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.199
And I believe this morning that there's a number of areas,

00:02:58.199 --> 00:03:00.000
and we'll look at them in more detail as we go

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.100
throughout the remainder of this calendar year

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.080
as to how it will impact our lives,

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.440
really the idea of living in light of His greatness.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.800
And I serve a great God, and you serve a great God,

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.679
and I'm so thankful that He has given us

00:03:16.679 --> 00:03:20.600
the opportunity to know just how great He is.

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:23.720
As we kind of transition into that thought

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.679
throughout the remainder of the year,

00:03:25.679 --> 00:03:28.839
God has brought my attention to this passage of scripture

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:30.860
in Hebrews chapter 12.

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.440
As we look at this simple phrase in verse number three,

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.520
I'll read verses one through three.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.039
The Bible says, consider Him, I've titled the message,

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:40.639
consider Christ, but notice what the Bible says

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:42.720
beginning in verse number one of Hebrews 12.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.240
Wherefore, seeing we also are compassed about

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.119
with so great a cloud of witnesses,

00:03:49.119 --> 00:03:51.720
let us lay aside every weight and the sin

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.880
which doth so easily beset us,

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.160
and let us run with patience the race

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.479
that is set before us, looking unto Jesus,

00:03:59.479 --> 00:04:01.720
the author and finisher of our faith,

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.399
who for the joy that was set before Him

00:04:03.399 --> 00:04:05.960
endured the cross, despising the shame,

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.139
and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:12.360
For consider Him that endured such contradiction

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.039
of sinners against Himself,

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:18.179
lest ye be wearied and faint in your own minds.

00:04:18.179 --> 00:04:21.220
As we look at this thought this morning from Hebrews 12,

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.579
and particularly verse number three,

00:04:24.579 --> 00:04:26.899
we notice that it's simple instruction.

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:29.220
Consider Christ, consider Him.

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.260
But oh, how impactful this exercise will be

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.739
in each of our lives as we truly consider Him,

00:04:37.739 --> 00:04:39.179
as we truly consider Christ.

00:04:39.179 --> 00:04:42.179
The word consider means to think over.

00:04:42.179 --> 00:04:43.980
It means to ponder.

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.299
I believe that it would not be a far stretch

00:04:46.299 --> 00:04:48.339
for us to say this morning that the idea

00:04:48.339 --> 00:04:50.940
that is communicated through this word consider

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.299
is to meditate upon, to really muse upon,

00:04:54.299 --> 00:04:57.660
to allow us to really keep our focus

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.660
and our attention upon the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.339
Notice the end of the verse says this,

00:05:01.339 --> 00:05:06.059
lest ye be wearied and faint in your own minds.

00:05:06.059 --> 00:05:08.899
No doubt there's the opportunity as we live life,

00:05:08.899 --> 00:05:11.059
as we go through all that we go through,

00:05:11.059 --> 00:05:13.940
that there are things that are vying for your attention

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.140
and my attention, and we can become distracted,

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.179
and we can get our focus on certain things.

00:05:20.179 --> 00:05:22.619
But this morning, we need to consider Christ.

00:05:22.619 --> 00:05:23.660
We need to consider Him.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.140
We need to think over, ponder, meditate,

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:31.140
muse upon just how wonderful our Savior truly is.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.980
No doubt as we think about this admonition

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:36.779
that is given here in Hebrews chapter 12,

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:39.380
it's interesting, obviously the book of Hebrews

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.299
has 13 chapters, but as we're near the end of the book,

00:05:42.299 --> 00:05:46.000
as the writer of the human penman of the book of Hebrews

00:05:46.859 --> 00:05:48.760
is closing out, really getting to the conclusion

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.720
of the book, we find that he says consider Him,

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.559
consider Christ, really the theme of the book of Hebrews

00:05:54.559 --> 00:05:58.040
is this, Christ is better, Christ is superior,

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.880
Christ is greater, and we begin to look at that theme

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.920
through the book of Hebrews, and we find that there are

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:06.200
a number of truths that God gives us with regard

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.839
to He's greater than the angels, He's greater than Moses,

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:10.880
and so on and so forth, and we'll look at a number

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.720
of those things, but the author says to these people,

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.880
and we understand that the author ultimately

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.600
is the Holy Spirit of God, all scripture is given

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.279
by inspiration of God, and so God is saying

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:24.799
to each of us this morning, by way of preservation

00:06:24.799 --> 00:06:29.279
through this portion of scripture, consider Christ.

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:33.540
Ponder, think upon, muse, meditate.

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:36.359
We sing the song more about Jesus.

00:06:36.359 --> 00:06:39.880
Oh, listen, Jesus is the sweetest name I know.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.040
There's no one like Him, there's no one like Him.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.239
We begin to think about the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:06:45.239 --> 00:06:47.640
I mean, no doubt in my mind that there are times

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.799
in which you hear the name of Jesus as you're going through,

00:06:50.799 --> 00:06:52.920
maybe you hear it in the proper context,

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.200
where somebody is rejoicing and lifting up,

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.320
exalting the name of Jesus, and how it will

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.000
through your soul, there are times in my life,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.359
I'm sure in your life as well, that you'll hear somebody

00:07:02.359 --> 00:07:04.760
use the name of Jesus inappropriately,

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.640
and oh, how it grieves my heart.

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:08.480
Why?

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.760
Because that's my God, that's my Jesus,

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.000
that's my Savior, that's my Redeemer,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.399
and oh, how wonderful He is.

00:07:16.399 --> 00:07:19.880
This morning, as we take this thought of considering Christ,

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:23.040
I really wanna take a journey through the book of Hebrews,

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.040
go back to Hebrews chapter number one,

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.959
the introduction this morning is far longer

00:07:27.959 --> 00:07:30.519
than the actual message, though I have four points

00:07:30.519 --> 00:07:32.480
this morning, we're gonna kinda go through

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.920
a whole lot of scripture, and then I'm gonna give you

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:37.559
four points really quickly as we go through

00:07:37.559 --> 00:07:40.720
the message this morning, and I want us to consider Christ,

00:07:41.679 --> 00:07:42.519
and in Hebrews chapter number one,

00:07:42.519 --> 00:07:45.559
notice how the Bible begins, what a powerful book

00:07:45.559 --> 00:07:48.359
the book of Hebrews is, it begins similarly

00:07:48.359 --> 00:07:51.359
to the book of Genesis, in the beginning, God,

00:07:51.359 --> 00:07:54.119
and we find here that the Bible tells us in Hebrews one,

00:07:54.119 --> 00:07:57.480
God, who at sundry times and in diverse manners,

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:00.920
spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:04.160
God used the prophets, there are many good prophets,

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.619
we can read of the prophets, and we can see how God

00:08:06.619 --> 00:08:11.100
used them, and how God communicated truth to his people

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:13.739
through his prophets, yes, there were false prophets,

00:08:13.739 --> 00:08:16.260
but we think about the prophets that are being referred to

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:20.260
here in verse number one, and God would use those prophets

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:24.119
in order to communicate truth, truth with regard

00:08:24.119 --> 00:08:28.579
to their current time, truth with regard to future events,

00:08:28.579 --> 00:08:31.480
and you find that those prophets are recorded,

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.739
a number of them, we have the major and minor prophets

00:08:33.739 --> 00:08:36.380
in our Bible, and we still today have the privilege

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:39.140
of being able to read through those prophets,

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:40.979
but notice the Bible says in verse number two,

00:08:40.979 --> 00:08:45.979
hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son,

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:49.580
notice the Bible says, whom he hath appointed heir

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:54.580
of all things, by whom also he made the worlds,

00:08:55.059 --> 00:08:56.659
who being the brightness of his glory,

00:08:56.659 --> 00:08:58.380
and the express image of his person,

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.219
and upholding all things by the word of his power,

00:09:01.219 --> 00:09:05.820
when he had by himself purged our sins,

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:10.299
sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high.

00:09:10.299 --> 00:09:13.619
Wow, what an introduction the book of Hebrews gives to us

00:09:13.619 --> 00:09:15.840
as we read these first three verses,

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.820
and in three verses of scripture,

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:19.979
as we consider Christ in the book of Hebrews,

00:09:19.979 --> 00:09:24.140
we find that he's the creator, I'm thankful that all things

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:26.260
were made by him, and that without him,

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.739
there's nothing that was made, the Bible says

00:09:28.739 --> 00:09:30.380
in the beginning was the word, and the word was with God,

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:33.239
and the word was God, and we find here that he says,

00:09:33.239 --> 00:09:37.359
by him all things consist, we read Colossians one,

00:09:37.359 --> 00:09:40.500
and we read that he is creator, not only the creator,

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:43.080
but the sustainer, notice the Bible says,

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:45.320
that not only did he make the worlds in verse number two,

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.880
but in verse number three, upholding all things

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:51.320
by the word of his power.

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.039
I'm thankful that our God is the creator,

00:09:54.039 --> 00:09:55.960
and he's also the sustainer.

00:09:55.960 --> 00:10:00.159
I'm thankful that God holds all things together.

00:10:00.159 --> 00:10:03.499
We find that He is not only Creator and Sustainer,

00:10:03.499 --> 00:10:04.999
but He is Redeemer.

00:10:04.999 --> 00:10:08.999
And oh, how wonderful it is to know the Redeemer.

00:10:08.999 --> 00:10:10.959
The Bible says at the end of verse number three,

00:10:10.959 --> 00:10:15.959
notice, when He had by Himself purged our sins,

00:10:17.339 --> 00:10:21.719
notice, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high.

00:10:21.719 --> 00:10:24.179
I'm so thankful that in just three verses of Scripture

00:10:24.179 --> 00:10:28.559
here in Hebrews 1, that God is giving the truth to us

00:10:28.719 --> 00:10:31.759
that the Lord Jesus Christ, He's Creator,

00:10:31.759 --> 00:10:35.019
He's Sustainer, and He is Redeemer.

00:10:35.019 --> 00:10:37.259
You think about the power of creation.

00:10:37.259 --> 00:10:38.599
God said, and it was so.

00:10:38.599 --> 00:10:41.899
You read the account in Genesis 1 and Genesis 2,

00:10:41.899 --> 00:10:46.479
and how we are confronted with the power of God,

00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:51.279
the wisdom of God, and the truth of the power

00:10:51.279 --> 00:10:53.899
of upholding all things by the word of His power

00:10:53.899 --> 00:10:54.819
in verse number three.

00:10:54.819 --> 00:10:58.419
But all this morning, I really am so thankful.

00:10:59.279 --> 00:11:00.739
Yes, that He's Creator and Sustainer,

00:11:00.739 --> 00:11:03.679
but isn't it wonderful to know that He's the Redeemer?

00:11:03.679 --> 00:11:05.239
I hope this morning that you know Him

00:11:05.239 --> 00:11:07.759
as your personal Redeemer, that you've been saved

00:11:07.759 --> 00:11:09.999
by the blood of the Lamb, that you know for sure today

00:11:09.999 --> 00:11:12.559
without any shadow of a doubt that heaven is your home.

00:11:12.559 --> 00:11:13.399
Why?

00:11:13.399 --> 00:11:14.219
Because He is the Redeemer.

00:11:14.219 --> 00:11:17.179
Notice it says that He had purged by Himself,

00:11:17.179 --> 00:11:18.159
purged our sins.

00:11:18.159 --> 00:11:18.999
How did He do that?

00:11:18.999 --> 00:11:21.499
Through the atonement, through the blood that was shed

00:11:21.499 --> 00:11:24.099
on the cross of Calvary, His burial,

00:11:24.099 --> 00:11:25.599
and His glorious resurrection.

00:11:25.599 --> 00:11:27.979
We'll see some of that as we continue to move forward

00:11:27.999 --> 00:11:29.359
through the book of Hebrews.

00:11:29.359 --> 00:11:33.079
Notice in chapter number two, beginning in verse number nine,

00:11:33.079 --> 00:11:35.559
so we see in chapter one that He's Creator,

00:11:35.559 --> 00:11:37.959
He's Sustainer, and He is Redeemer.

00:11:37.959 --> 00:11:39.839
Notice in chapter number two of the book of Hebrews

00:11:39.839 --> 00:11:42.079
in verse number nine, notice the Bible says this,

00:11:42.079 --> 00:11:45.399
but we see Jesus, who was made a little lower

00:11:45.399 --> 00:11:47.519
than the angels for the suffering of death,

00:11:47.519 --> 00:11:52.199
crowned with glory and honor, that He, by the grace of God,

00:11:52.199 --> 00:11:55.319
should taste death for every man.

00:11:55.319 --> 00:11:57.679
I'm thankful that He tasted death for every man.

00:11:58.379 --> 00:12:00.939
I'm thankful for the substitutionary atonement

00:12:00.939 --> 00:12:01.999
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:12:01.999 --> 00:12:03.659
Continue looking in verse number 10.

00:12:03.659 --> 00:12:06.139
For it became Him for whom are all things

00:12:06.139 --> 00:12:09.219
and by whom are all things in bringing many sons

00:12:09.219 --> 00:12:11.979
unto glory to make the captain of their salvation

00:12:11.979 --> 00:12:13.999
perfect through sufferings.

00:12:13.999 --> 00:12:17.359
For both He that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified

00:12:17.359 --> 00:12:20.999
are all of one, for which cause He is not ashamed

00:12:20.999 --> 00:12:22.979
to call them brethren, saying,

00:12:22.979 --> 00:12:25.039
I will declare thy name unto my brethren.

00:12:25.039 --> 00:12:27.179
In the midst of the church will I sing praise

00:12:27.679 --> 00:12:29.759
unto thee, and again, I will put my trust in Him.

00:12:29.759 --> 00:12:31.559
And again, behold, I and the children

00:12:31.559 --> 00:12:33.079
which God hath given me.

00:12:33.079 --> 00:12:36.319
For as much then as the children are partakers

00:12:36.319 --> 00:12:40.119
of flesh and blood, He also Himself likewise

00:12:40.119 --> 00:12:40.999
took part of the same.

00:12:40.999 --> 00:12:45.299
Notice that through death, He might destroy him

00:12:45.299 --> 00:12:49.399
that had the power of death, that is the devil.

00:12:49.399 --> 00:12:52.279
Oh man, I'm so thankful that He's our substitute,

00:12:52.279 --> 00:12:55.679
but He's the conqueror, He's victorious, He is the victor.

00:12:55.699 --> 00:12:57.459
Notice the Bible says that through death,

00:12:57.459 --> 00:13:00.379
the death of the cross, He might destroy him

00:13:00.379 --> 00:13:03.179
that had the power of death, that is the devil.

00:13:03.179 --> 00:13:06.419
Notice what He does, He delivers in verse number 15,

00:13:06.419 --> 00:13:10.619
them who through fear of death were all their lifetime

00:13:10.619 --> 00:13:13.339
subject to bondage.

00:13:13.339 --> 00:13:16.099
You know, I remember when I was lost.

00:13:16.099 --> 00:13:17.979
Do you remember when you were lost?

00:13:17.979 --> 00:13:19.639
I remember being afraid of dying.

00:13:20.899 --> 00:13:23.339
I'd heard the gospel, I'd heard the truth

00:13:23.339 --> 00:13:25.539
that Jesus saves, that there's only one way

00:13:26.399 --> 00:13:27.479
to heaven and that's through the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:13:27.479 --> 00:13:29.839
I'd heard the truth that if you were to die

00:13:29.839 --> 00:13:32.639
without salvation, without the blood being applied

00:13:32.639 --> 00:13:34.119
to your account, that you'd spend eternity

00:13:34.119 --> 00:13:36.739
in the lake of fire, why, for the wages of sin is death

00:13:36.739 --> 00:13:40.599
and I knew I was guilty, but I had not yet

00:13:40.599 --> 00:13:42.519
trusted Christ as my savior.

00:13:42.519 --> 00:13:44.919
Maybe you trusted Christ the very first time

00:13:44.919 --> 00:13:47.299
you heard the gospel, I did not.

00:13:48.799 --> 00:13:52.079
I heard the gospel, I didn't get saved right away.

00:13:52.079 --> 00:13:56.899
I put it off and I remember for weeks

00:13:56.899 --> 00:14:00.779
fearing death, knowing that if I were to die,

00:14:00.779 --> 00:14:03.479
that I'd go to a Christless eternity

00:14:03.479 --> 00:14:05.219
because I had not trusted Christ as my savior.

00:14:05.219 --> 00:14:06.699
You say, well, why didn't you just trust Christ?

00:14:06.699 --> 00:14:07.999
Because I was hard-headed.

00:14:11.259 --> 00:14:14.099
I didn't trust Him my first time I heard the gospel,

00:14:14.099 --> 00:14:17.499
but oh, I'm so thankful for His pursuit of me.

00:14:17.499 --> 00:14:19.739
I'm so thankful for His long-suffering.

00:14:19.759 --> 00:14:22.159
I'm so thankful that the Holy Spirit of God

00:14:22.159 --> 00:14:25.439
kept working in my heart and kept convincing me

00:14:25.439 --> 00:14:29.079
of truth and convincing me of my own sin.

00:14:29.079 --> 00:14:33.279
I was guilty, convincing me that Jesus is the only savior

00:14:34.359 --> 00:14:37.079
and I trust that Christ is my savior.

00:14:37.079 --> 00:14:39.799
And from that day until this, just to be completely honest

00:14:39.799 --> 00:14:42.779
with you, I don't fear death, why?

00:14:42.779 --> 00:14:45.479
Because the Bible says, I didn't understand this

00:14:45.479 --> 00:14:47.319
immediately at the time, I didn't know

00:14:47.319 --> 00:14:49.099
Hebrews chapter two at that time,

00:14:49.099 --> 00:14:50.899
but the Bible says that He delivered them

00:14:50.899 --> 00:14:54.139
who through fear of death were all their lifetime

00:14:54.139 --> 00:14:57.619
subject to bondage, that was me and that was you.

00:14:57.619 --> 00:15:00.499
But now I know that when I die, listen,

00:15:00.499 --> 00:15:03.079
it doesn't mean that we're anxious for the process,

00:15:03.079 --> 00:15:05.999
but it just simply means that I have no anxiety

00:15:05.999 --> 00:15:08.059
over the fact that I'm going to heaven,

00:15:08.059 --> 00:15:11.979
that it's but a doorway, it's but a path, if you will,

00:15:11.979 --> 00:15:14.579
through which I will enter into the wonderful presence

00:15:14.579 --> 00:15:16.779
of my Lord and my savior.

00:15:17.119 --> 00:15:19.959
And He delivered me from that, He's my substitute,

00:15:19.959 --> 00:15:22.399
He is the victor, notice in verse 16,

00:15:22.399 --> 00:15:26.559
for verily He took not on Him the nature of angels,

00:15:27.519 --> 00:15:30.319
but He took on Him the seed of Abraham.

00:15:30.319 --> 00:15:32.479
He had to come in the likeness of man

00:15:32.479 --> 00:15:35.479
in order to die for us, it was not possible

00:15:35.479 --> 00:15:39.119
that an angel could die in your place.

00:15:39.119 --> 00:15:43.279
Jesus, God in flesh, He came to this sin-cursed world

00:15:43.499 --> 00:15:47.659
so that He could redeem them that were under the law.

00:15:47.659 --> 00:15:49.779
The Bible says in verse 17, wherefore,

00:15:49.779 --> 00:15:52.219
in all things that behooved Him to be made like

00:15:52.219 --> 00:15:55.219
unto His brethren, that He might be a merciful

00:15:55.219 --> 00:15:58.459
and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God

00:15:58.459 --> 00:16:01.219
to make reconciliation for the sins of the people,

00:16:01.219 --> 00:16:04.979
for in that He Himself hath suffered being tempted,

00:16:04.979 --> 00:16:08.379
He is able to succor them that are tempted.

00:16:08.379 --> 00:16:10.819
Oh, listen, we're considering Christ this morning,

00:16:10.839 --> 00:16:12.759
we're considering Christ this morning,

00:16:12.759 --> 00:16:14.919
we're looking and we're seeing He's creator,

00:16:14.919 --> 00:16:18.559
He's sustainer, He's redeemer, He's my substitute,

00:16:18.559 --> 00:16:21.959
He's victorious, He's the great high priest,

00:16:21.959 --> 00:16:24.399
we see it introduced here, He's my helper.

00:16:24.399 --> 00:16:27.439
That word succor means to help, to come alongside,

00:16:27.439 --> 00:16:30.279
He's able to help us that are tempted,

00:16:30.279 --> 00:16:32.559
He's able to succor them that are tempted.

00:16:32.559 --> 00:16:34.219
Oh, aren't you thankful for that?

00:16:34.219 --> 00:16:36.919
Listen, it's not past you yet, it's not past me yet

00:16:36.919 --> 00:16:39.839
that we're tempted, amen?

00:16:39.859 --> 00:16:42.539
And He is able to help us, He's able to succor.

00:16:42.539 --> 00:16:45.619
Notice in chapter four in verse 14, the Bible says this,

00:16:45.619 --> 00:16:50.619
seeing then that we have a great high priest

00:16:50.899 --> 00:16:53.259
that is passed into the heavens,

00:16:53.259 --> 00:16:57.419
Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.

00:16:57.419 --> 00:16:59.819
Remember, back in chapter one in verse number three,

00:16:59.819 --> 00:17:02.639
it told us that He had by Himself purged our sins

00:17:02.639 --> 00:17:05.419
but then sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high

00:17:05.419 --> 00:17:07.539
and we read in chapter four in verse 14,

00:17:07.539 --> 00:17:11.159
the Bible says seeing then we have a great high priest

00:17:11.159 --> 00:17:15.599
that is passed into the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God,

00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:18.199
let us hold fast our profession.

00:17:18.199 --> 00:17:21.019
For we, verse 15, have not an high priest

00:17:21.019 --> 00:17:23.619
which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities

00:17:23.619 --> 00:17:26.319
but was in all points tempted like as we are,

00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:30.259
notice this, yet without sin.

00:17:30.259 --> 00:17:32.119
You understand when the Lord Jesus Christ

00:17:32.119 --> 00:17:33.259
and you go through the book of Hebrews,

00:17:33.259 --> 00:17:35.759
we won't take time to develop all of it this morning

00:17:35.759 --> 00:17:37.279
but you understand that when He went

00:17:37.279 --> 00:17:38.559
to the cross of Calvary,

00:17:38.559 --> 00:17:42.799
He did not have to first make an offering for His own sin.

00:17:42.799 --> 00:17:45.119
That's what the high priest had to do in the Old Testament,

00:17:45.119 --> 00:17:46.719
they first had to enter in

00:17:46.719 --> 00:17:49.439
and they had to make atonement for their own sin

00:17:49.439 --> 00:17:51.439
and then for the sin of the people

00:17:51.439 --> 00:17:55.719
but oh my Savior, my Christ, He's sinless yet without sin

00:17:55.719 --> 00:17:58.479
and He did not have to make an offering for Himself

00:17:58.479 --> 00:18:02.319
because He's perfect, He's pure, the just for the unjust

00:18:02.319 --> 00:18:05.739
but He went and He made an offering for you and for me.

00:18:05.739 --> 00:18:07.199
The Bible says in verse 16,

00:18:07.199 --> 00:18:10.959
let us therefore come boldly under the throne of grace,

00:18:10.959 --> 00:18:15.199
the access that's been granted to you and I as His children

00:18:15.199 --> 00:18:18.599
because of the work that He did at Calvary

00:18:18.599 --> 00:18:21.559
that we may obtain mercy and find grace

00:18:21.559 --> 00:18:23.559
to help in time of need.

00:18:23.559 --> 00:18:25.839
You ever find yourself in a place of need?

00:18:25.839 --> 00:18:28.599
Oh, you can come boldly under the throne of grace

00:18:28.599 --> 00:18:31.359
and the promise is that as you come boldly

00:18:31.359 --> 00:18:34.519
to the throne of grace, you're able to obtain mercy

00:18:34.519 --> 00:18:36.119
and you're able to find grace

00:18:36.119 --> 00:18:39.419
that will help you in that time of need.

00:18:39.419 --> 00:18:41.039
Some people say, I need help

00:18:41.039 --> 00:18:43.699
and you might be thinking that the help that you need

00:18:43.699 --> 00:18:45.459
is something specific but God says,

00:18:45.459 --> 00:18:47.879
I'll give you the mercy and the grace

00:18:47.879 --> 00:18:49.479
that you need in that time

00:18:49.479 --> 00:18:52.339
and oh, the help that it will give us.

00:18:52.339 --> 00:18:55.739
This morning, I'm thankful for the access

00:18:55.739 --> 00:18:58.019
that we have through the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:18:58.019 --> 00:19:00.559
You understand that we have an access today

00:19:00.559 --> 00:19:03.839
that's unlike the Old Testament.

00:19:03.839 --> 00:19:06.739
As you picture here, these Hebrews,

00:19:06.739 --> 00:19:10.479
these that had been raised and exposed to Judaism

00:19:10.479 --> 00:19:12.559
but now had trust at Christ

00:19:12.559 --> 00:19:14.039
and there's all kinds of things going on

00:19:14.039 --> 00:19:16.699
in the book of Hebrews with regard to the pull back

00:19:16.699 --> 00:19:18.579
to Judaism and all of those things

00:19:18.579 --> 00:19:20.179
but you understand in the Old Testament,

00:19:20.179 --> 00:19:23.519
they didn't have access like we have access today.

00:19:23.519 --> 00:19:27.219
We have access to the throne room of heaven.

00:19:27.219 --> 00:19:28.359
Oh, how thankful.

00:19:28.359 --> 00:19:31.879
Notice in chapter five and verse number nine,

00:19:31.879 --> 00:19:34.599
the Bible tells us again as we consider Christ,

00:19:34.599 --> 00:19:36.639
notice in chapter five and verse number nine

00:19:36.639 --> 00:19:39.619
and being made perfect, he, the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:19:39.619 --> 00:19:44.440
he became the author of eternal salvation

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:47.559
unto all them that obey him.

00:19:47.559 --> 00:19:49.799
Aren't you thankful that he is the author

00:19:49.799 --> 00:19:51.399
of eternal salvation?

00:19:51.399 --> 00:19:55.719
I'm thankful as Hebrews 12 in verse one and two

00:19:55.719 --> 00:19:57.359
as we referenced earlier,

00:19:57.359 --> 00:20:00.279
it talks about he's the author and finisher of our.

00:20:00.279 --> 00:20:06.279
And here the Bible tells us that he is the author, notice, of eternal salvation.

00:20:06.279 --> 00:20:09.279
Oh, I'm so thankful it's not temporary.

00:20:09.279 --> 00:20:11.279
I'm so thankful it's not probationary.

00:20:11.279 --> 00:20:13.279
I'm thankful that it's his work.

00:20:13.279 --> 00:20:17.279
He's the author, he's the finisher, he's the author of eternal salvation.

00:20:17.279 --> 00:20:20.279
Notice in chapter 7, in verse number 24.

00:20:20.279 --> 00:20:24.279
Again, as we think about these believers that are being written to,

00:20:24.279 --> 00:20:27.279
as we think about the preservation of Scripture for us this morning,

00:20:27.279 --> 00:20:32.279
and as God has given us his word, he gives us the opportunity to read this admonition,

00:20:32.279 --> 00:20:36.279
simple instruction in Hebrews 12, in verse number 3,

00:20:36.279 --> 00:20:39.279
consider him, and I say this morning, consider Christ,

00:20:39.279 --> 00:20:44.279
that we have the opportunity, as we look just within the book of Hebrews,

00:20:44.279 --> 00:20:48.279
how exalted and magnified our Savior is.

00:20:48.279 --> 00:20:51.279
Oh, we could go to so many other passages of Scripture this morning,

00:20:51.279 --> 00:20:55.279
and so many other references with regard to revealing to us

00:20:55.279 --> 00:20:58.279
and helping us understand how wonderful our Savior is,

00:20:58.279 --> 00:21:03.279
but just within the book of Hebrews, oh, the portrait of Christ is presented to us,

00:21:03.279 --> 00:21:07.279
and we see him in such an amazing way,

00:21:07.279 --> 00:21:10.279
that it should have a profound impact on us.

00:21:10.279 --> 00:21:13.279
In Hebrews 7, in verse 24, the Bible says,

00:21:13.279 --> 00:21:16.279
but this man, speaking again of the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:21:16.279 --> 00:21:19.279
because he continueth ever, aren't you thankful that he's eternal?

00:21:19.279 --> 00:21:22.279
He has no beginning and no end, he's Alpha and Omega.

00:21:22.279 --> 00:21:26.279
The Bible says that he hath an unchangeable priesthood.

00:21:26.279 --> 00:21:29.279
Not only is he eternal, but he's immutable, he never changes,

00:21:29.279 --> 00:21:32.279
he's the same yesterday, and today, and forever.

00:21:32.279 --> 00:21:35.279
We'll look at that in chapter 13 here in just a moment,

00:21:35.279 --> 00:21:39.279
but notice in verse number 25, wherefore, notice he is able

00:21:39.279 --> 00:21:44.279
also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him.

00:21:44.279 --> 00:21:46.279
Aren't you thankful that he's able to save?

00:21:46.279 --> 00:21:49.279
Oh, I'm thankful this morning, what a wonderful promise,

00:21:49.279 --> 00:21:52.279
as we go and we give the gospel, as we go and share

00:21:52.279 --> 00:21:55.279
the truth of God's word that Jesus saves,

00:21:55.279 --> 00:21:58.279
that we can look at Hebrews 7 and verse 25,

00:21:58.279 --> 00:22:01.279
and we can be reminded that he's able also to save them

00:22:01.279 --> 00:22:03.279
to the uttermost that come unto God by him.

00:22:03.279 --> 00:22:06.279
Listen, there's only one way to be saved, it's through the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:22:06.279 --> 00:22:09.279
We find that the Bible tells us there's no salvation in any other,

00:22:09.279 --> 00:22:12.279
there's no other name under heaven, whereby we must be saved.

00:22:12.279 --> 00:22:14.279
Jesus said, I am the way, the truth, and the life.

00:22:14.279 --> 00:22:17.279
No man cometh unto the Father but by me.

00:22:17.279 --> 00:22:19.279
I'm thankful this morning that he's able to save,

00:22:19.279 --> 00:22:20.279
that I can take that message.

00:22:20.279 --> 00:22:24.279
Listen, Jesus revealed to us, Peter writes it this way,

00:22:24.279 --> 00:22:26.279
that the Lord is not slack concerning his promises.

00:22:26.279 --> 00:22:29.279
Some men count slackness, but is longsuffering to us,

00:22:29.279 --> 00:22:33.279
not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.

00:22:33.279 --> 00:22:35.279
I'm thankful this morning that he's able to save,

00:22:35.279 --> 00:22:37.279
but notice the end of verse 25,

00:22:37.279 --> 00:22:41.279
seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.

00:22:41.279 --> 00:22:43.279
Listen, I'm thankful that he lives forever.

00:22:43.279 --> 00:22:46.279
He was dead, but he rose, conquered sin, death, and the grave.

00:22:46.279 --> 00:22:51.279
And he's alive forevermore, is what we're told in the book of Revelation.

00:22:51.279 --> 00:22:54.279
And we find here that he is our intercessor.

00:22:54.279 --> 00:22:58.279
He ever liveth to make intercession for them.

00:22:58.279 --> 00:23:00.279
The Bible says in verse 26,

00:23:00.279 --> 00:23:04.279
For such a high priest became us, who was holy, harmless, undefiled,

00:23:04.279 --> 00:23:07.279
separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens,

00:23:07.279 --> 00:23:09.279
who needeth not daily as those high priests

00:23:09.279 --> 00:23:12.279
to offer up sacrifice first for his own sins,

00:23:12.279 --> 00:23:13.279
and then for the people's.

00:23:13.279 --> 00:23:17.279
For this he did once when he offered up himself.

00:23:17.279 --> 00:23:20.279
Listen, I'm excited about who Christ is.

00:23:20.279 --> 00:23:24.279
I'm excited this morning that we serve a wonderful Savior.

00:23:24.279 --> 00:23:27.279
I'm excited this morning that God has given us,

00:23:27.279 --> 00:23:31.279
through his word, the revelation of who he is.

00:23:31.279 --> 00:23:35.279
And as I consider Christ this morning, as you consider Christ,

00:23:35.279 --> 00:23:37.279
it's going to change our perspective.

00:23:37.279 --> 00:23:39.279
It's going to change how we live our lives.

00:23:39.279 --> 00:23:41.279
It should have a profound impact.

00:23:41.279 --> 00:23:45.279
It's simple instruction, but oh, the impact that it will have

00:23:45.279 --> 00:23:50.279
as we truly take time to ponder, to consider who Christ is.

00:23:50.279 --> 00:23:52.279
Notice with me in chapter 9,

00:23:52.279 --> 00:23:55.279
continuing our journey here through the book of Hebrews.

00:23:55.279 --> 00:23:57.279
Hebrews chapter 9.

00:23:57.279 --> 00:23:59.279
Look at verse 11, if you will.

00:23:59.279 --> 00:24:03.279
The Bible says this, in Hebrews 9 and verse 11,

00:24:03.279 --> 00:24:07.279
But Christ, being come in a high priest of good things to come

00:24:07.279 --> 00:24:10.279
by a greater and more perfect tabernacle,

00:24:10.279 --> 00:24:13.279
not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building,

00:24:13.279 --> 00:24:16.279
neither by the blood of goats and calves,

00:24:16.279 --> 00:24:18.279
notice, but by his own blood,

00:24:18.279 --> 00:24:21.279
he entered in once into the holy place,

00:24:21.279 --> 00:24:26.279
having obtained eternal redemption for us.

00:24:26.279 --> 00:24:27.279
Wow.

00:24:27.279 --> 00:24:31.279
Once again, we're reminded here in these verses in Hebrews 9, 11, 12,

00:24:31.279 --> 00:24:33.279
and look at verse 14 as well.

00:24:33.279 --> 00:24:35.279
How much more shall the blood of Christ,

00:24:35.279 --> 00:24:39.279
who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God,

00:24:39.279 --> 00:24:43.279
purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?

00:24:43.279 --> 00:24:45.279
I'm thankful that he's my substitute,

00:24:45.279 --> 00:24:49.279
that he made this sacrifice once and for all.

00:24:49.279 --> 00:24:51.279
We'll see that in chapter 10 as well.

00:24:51.279 --> 00:24:53.279
But notice the end of verse number 12,

00:24:53.279 --> 00:24:58.279
having obtained eternal redemption for us.

00:24:58.279 --> 00:25:01.279
We saw already in Hebrews 5, in verse 9,

00:25:01.279 --> 00:25:05.279
how the Bible says that he's the author of eternal salvation.

00:25:05.279 --> 00:25:08.279
And now we see here in Hebrews 9 and verse number 12

00:25:08.279 --> 00:25:11.279
that he's obtained eternal redemption for us.

00:25:11.279 --> 00:25:13.279
How? By his blood.

00:25:13.279 --> 00:25:16.279
Listen, if you remove the blood, you got nothing.

00:25:16.279 --> 00:25:19.279
People today attacking the blood of Christ, attacking the blood.

00:25:19.279 --> 00:25:22.279
Listen, you understand this morning that without the shedding of blood,

00:25:22.279 --> 00:25:25.279
Hebrews tells us there's no remission for sins.

00:25:25.279 --> 00:25:28.279
The Bible says that we are saved through the blood of Christ.

00:25:28.279 --> 00:25:31.279
We're not redeemed with corruptible things such as silver and gold.

00:25:31.279 --> 00:25:32.279
No, no, no.

00:25:32.279 --> 00:25:36.279
We're redeemed with the precious blood of Christ.

00:25:36.279 --> 00:25:40.279
This morning the blood is so important and so significant.

00:25:40.279 --> 00:25:43.279
Notice in verse 24 here in chapter 9, the Bible says this,

00:25:43.279 --> 00:25:47.279
For Christ has not entered into the holy places made with hands,

00:25:47.279 --> 00:25:50.279
which are the figures of the true, but into heaven itself,

00:25:50.279 --> 00:25:53.279
now to appear in the presence of God, notice, for us.

00:25:53.279 --> 00:25:59.279
Verse 25, nor yet that he should offer himself often

00:25:59.279 --> 00:26:03.279
as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others.

00:26:04.279 --> 00:26:07.279
For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world.

00:26:07.279 --> 00:26:10.279
But now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin

00:26:10.279 --> 00:26:12.279
by the sacrifice of himself.

00:26:12.279 --> 00:26:15.279
Listen, it was one offering for sin forever.

00:26:15.279 --> 00:26:17.279
We're going to see that plainly in chapter 10.

00:26:17.279 --> 00:26:21.279
Listen, the Old Testament priests, they had to come every year, right?

00:26:21.279 --> 00:26:24.279
At the Day of Atonement, they had to come and they had to come.

00:26:24.279 --> 00:26:27.279
And of course, the sacrifices and offerings that would be made

00:26:27.279 --> 00:26:30.279
even between the times of the Day of Atonement,

00:26:30.279 --> 00:26:33.279
the 10th chapter talks about daily they were ministering

00:26:33.279 --> 00:26:38.279
and offering the same sacrifices that could never take away sin.

00:26:38.279 --> 00:26:41.279
Notice in verse 27, as it appointed unto man once to die,

00:26:41.279 --> 00:26:42.279
but after this the judgment.

00:26:42.279 --> 00:26:45.279
And then notice verse 28, for Christ was once offered

00:26:45.279 --> 00:26:47.279
to bear the sins of many.

00:26:47.279 --> 00:26:51.279
And unto them that look for him, notice, shall he appear the second time

00:26:51.279 --> 00:26:54.279
without sin unto salvation.

00:26:54.279 --> 00:26:57.279
Again, we're reminded that he's the substitute.

00:26:57.279 --> 00:26:59.279
It's a recurring theme through the book of Hebrews.

00:26:59.279 --> 00:27:01.279
But I'm looking here in verse 28 of Hebrews 9.

00:27:01.279 --> 00:27:03.279
Listen, he's coming again.

00:27:03.279 --> 00:27:06.279
I'm thankful for that wonderful truth, that wonderful promise.

00:27:06.279 --> 00:27:10.279
So many today are asking questions about world events

00:27:10.279 --> 00:27:13.279
and what's going on and what's this and what do you mean of that

00:27:13.279 --> 00:27:14.279
and so on and so forth.

00:27:14.279 --> 00:27:17.279
Understand this morning, it just reminds us that Jesus is coming,

00:27:17.279 --> 00:27:19.279
that things are falling into place.

00:27:19.279 --> 00:27:24.279
We see prophecy unfolding before our very eyes and Jesus is coming.

00:27:24.279 --> 00:27:27.279
Do not get distracted with all the things that are going on.

00:27:27.279 --> 00:27:31.279
Keep our mind focused on the task that God has given us,

00:27:31.279 --> 00:27:33.279
redeeming the time for the days are evil.

00:27:33.279 --> 00:27:35.279
We understand, listen, the time is short.

00:27:35.279 --> 00:27:37.279
Jesus is coming.

00:27:37.279 --> 00:27:40.279
And oh, what a glorious, wonderful truth it is.

00:27:40.279 --> 00:27:43.279
But you understand this morning that when that trumpet sounds,

00:27:43.279 --> 00:27:45.279
and I believe it will sound soon,

00:27:45.279 --> 00:27:48.279
that there's no more opportunity for you to share the gospel

00:27:48.279 --> 00:27:49.279
with your loved one.

00:27:49.279 --> 00:27:51.279
There's no more opportunity for you to share the gospel

00:27:51.279 --> 00:27:54.279
with your neighbor or your coworker or whomever it might be.

00:27:55.279 --> 00:27:57.279
Now is the time.

00:27:57.279 --> 00:27:59.279
Listen, Jesus is coming.

00:27:59.279 --> 00:28:01.279
Aren't you thankful this morning?

00:28:01.279 --> 00:28:03.279
Consider Christ.

00:28:03.279 --> 00:28:06.279
He's the sinless, pure Lamb of God.

00:28:06.279 --> 00:28:09.279
He took my place on the cross of Calvary.

00:28:09.279 --> 00:28:10.279
He lives right now.

00:28:10.279 --> 00:28:12.279
I mean, He's alive and He's interceding for us

00:28:12.279 --> 00:28:15.279
and He's aware of what's going on.

00:28:15.279 --> 00:28:17.279
He's able to help us.

00:28:17.279 --> 00:28:21.279
We have access to His throne and we find that He's coming back for us.

00:28:21.279 --> 00:28:23.279
Oh, what precious truth.

00:28:23.279 --> 00:28:26.279
Notice in chapter 10,

00:28:26.279 --> 00:28:28.279
in a wonderful portrait that God gives us

00:28:28.279 --> 00:28:31.279
in the book of Hebrews of our wonderful Savior.

00:28:31.279 --> 00:28:34.279
Hebrews 10, in verse number 10, knows what the Bible says.

00:28:34.279 --> 00:28:38.279
By the witch will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ.

00:28:38.279 --> 00:28:40.279
Notice this phrase, once for all.

00:28:40.279 --> 00:28:42.279
Aren't you thankful for that?

00:28:42.279 --> 00:28:44.279
In fact, there's a song that we sing, once for all.

00:28:44.279 --> 00:28:45.279
Praise the Lord.

00:28:45.279 --> 00:28:50.279
Verse number 11, and every priest standeth daily ministering and offering

00:28:50.279 --> 00:28:54.279
oftentimes the same sacrifices, which could never take away sins.

00:28:54.279 --> 00:28:57.279
You look at the Old Testament and you look at all of that process

00:28:57.279 --> 00:29:00.279
in the Levitical system and all that they went through.

00:29:00.279 --> 00:29:02.279
Yes, it was ordained by God,

00:29:02.279 --> 00:29:05.279
but you understand that it was pointing to Messiah

00:29:05.279 --> 00:29:09.279
who would one day come, Christ our Passover.

00:29:09.279 --> 00:29:12.279
And we find that He fulfilled all of that.

00:29:12.279 --> 00:29:14.279
And the Bible tells us in verse number 12,

00:29:14.279 --> 00:29:16.279
but this man, the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:29:16.279 --> 00:29:19.279
oh, aren't you thankful for your Savior this morning.

00:29:19.279 --> 00:29:24.279
After He'd offered one sacrifice for sins forever,

00:29:24.279 --> 00:29:28.279
sat down on the right hand of God.

00:29:28.279 --> 00:29:31.279
He sat down because His work was complete.

00:29:31.279 --> 00:29:34.279
Remember what He said on the cross of Calvary?

00:29:34.279 --> 00:29:37.279
It is finished.

00:29:37.279 --> 00:29:40.279
And then He gave up the ghost.

00:29:40.279 --> 00:29:43.279
He said, Father, the hour is come.

00:29:43.279 --> 00:29:45.279
In John chapter number 17,

00:29:45.279 --> 00:29:49.279
He knew that it was exactly why He came to this earth.

00:29:49.279 --> 00:29:51.279
He understood the plan.

00:29:51.279 --> 00:29:53.279
He's the author of eternal salvation.

00:29:53.279 --> 00:29:55.279
And He came and He fulfilled.

00:29:55.279 --> 00:29:59.279
And we find that here again in Hebrews 10 and verse 12,

00:29:59.279 --> 00:30:01.279
how thankful He is.

00:30:01.279 --> 00:30:03.279
of we are for this sacrifice that was made,

00:30:03.279 --> 00:30:05.919
verse 13, from henceforth expecting

00:30:05.919 --> 00:30:07.879
till his enemies be made his footstool.

00:30:07.879 --> 00:30:10.519
Notice again in verse 14, for by one offering

00:30:10.519 --> 00:30:14.859
he hath perfected forever them that are sanctified.

00:30:15.759 --> 00:30:16.959
Listen, I'm thankful this morning

00:30:16.959 --> 00:30:19.819
for the truth of sanctification.

00:30:19.819 --> 00:30:22.639
And when you understand the biblical teaching,

00:30:22.639 --> 00:30:25.599
as you understand what God has revealed to us

00:30:25.599 --> 00:30:29.179
positionally this morning, when we understand

00:30:29.179 --> 00:30:31.819
what happened at that day when you trust

00:30:31.819 --> 00:30:34.179
at Christ as your savior, the Bible says

00:30:34.179 --> 00:30:36.659
that we're sanctified positionally.

00:30:36.659 --> 00:30:38.339
Now I understand there's a truth

00:30:38.339 --> 00:30:40.259
that God gives us in his word with regard

00:30:40.259 --> 00:30:43.879
to what we might refer to as progressive sanctification,

00:30:43.879 --> 00:30:46.459
that as we live, we're to live daily

00:30:46.459 --> 00:30:48.479
in light of his commands and we're to become

00:30:48.479 --> 00:30:51.019
more and more like our savior.

00:30:51.019 --> 00:30:52.979
He has determined in Romans 8, 29

00:30:52.979 --> 00:30:56.099
that we are to be conformed to the image of his dear son.

00:30:56.099 --> 00:30:58.499
And we understand that truth, but I'm thankful

00:30:58.499 --> 00:31:00.699
to be sanctified, to be set apart,

00:31:00.699 --> 00:31:05.699
to have that positional standing with God.

00:31:05.919 --> 00:31:08.459
Listen, we speak about the imputed righteousness

00:31:08.459 --> 00:31:10.459
for he hath made him to be sin for us

00:31:10.459 --> 00:31:12.619
who knew no sin that we might be made

00:31:12.619 --> 00:31:16.579
the righteousness of God through him and in him.

00:31:16.579 --> 00:31:17.919
And you think about the truth

00:31:17.919 --> 00:31:20.719
that I am positionally sanctified.

00:31:20.719 --> 00:31:23.839
I am righteous because his righteousness

00:31:23.839 --> 00:31:26.419
has been imputed upon me.

00:31:26.419 --> 00:31:28.259
Here in the same chapter, in chapter 10,

00:31:29.019 --> 00:31:31.019
notice in verse 19, having therefore brethren,

00:31:31.019 --> 00:31:33.699
notice it says boldness to enter

00:31:33.699 --> 00:31:35.739
into the holiest, how?

00:31:35.739 --> 00:31:37.059
By the blood of Jesus.

00:31:37.059 --> 00:31:39.779
We mentioned already in Hebrews 4 in verse 16

00:31:39.779 --> 00:31:42.219
about that access, but it says this in verse 20,

00:31:42.219 --> 00:31:45.979
by a new and living way which he hath consecrated

00:31:45.979 --> 00:31:50.819
for us through the veil, that is to say his flesh.

00:31:50.819 --> 00:31:53.379
And having a high priest, in verse number 21,

00:31:53.379 --> 00:31:56.179
over the house of God, let us draw near

00:31:56.179 --> 00:31:58.579
with a true heart and full assurance of faith,

00:31:58.579 --> 00:32:01.099
having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience

00:32:01.099 --> 00:32:04.359
and our bodies washed with pure water.

00:32:04.359 --> 00:32:07.279
Oh, I'm thankful for the access that we have.

00:32:07.279 --> 00:32:08.979
I'm thankful that we can draw near.

00:32:08.979 --> 00:32:11.859
Notice it says, it references there in verse number 20

00:32:11.859 --> 00:32:13.659
by a new and a living way.

00:32:13.659 --> 00:32:15.679
And then it talks about the veil.

00:32:15.679 --> 00:32:17.779
Now remember what happened when Jesus

00:32:17.779 --> 00:32:19.939
went on the cross of Calvary at the temple there.

00:32:19.939 --> 00:32:21.739
There was a veil that separated.

00:32:21.739 --> 00:32:24.219
Again, remember the tabernacle and the temple.

00:32:24.219 --> 00:32:27.539
There was the outer, then there was the holy place,

00:32:27.539 --> 00:32:29.459
and then there's the holy of holies.

00:32:29.459 --> 00:32:31.779
And that holy of holies could only be accessed

00:32:31.779 --> 00:32:33.499
once a year on the day of atonement,

00:32:33.499 --> 00:32:35.579
and you better go with blood,

00:32:35.579 --> 00:32:39.099
otherwise you would die in that holy of holies.

00:32:39.099 --> 00:32:41.419
And the priest would go in, the high priest,

00:32:41.419 --> 00:32:43.839
on that day of atonement, and there were bells

00:32:43.839 --> 00:32:47.259
at the bottom of his garment so that they could hear

00:32:47.259 --> 00:32:49.259
that he's ministering as he's in there

00:32:49.259 --> 00:32:50.759
and applying the blood.

00:32:50.759 --> 00:32:53.379
And you find that at the time of Christ's death

00:32:53.419 --> 00:32:54.859
that what happened to that veil,

00:32:54.859 --> 00:32:57.659
well, it was rent in twain.

00:32:57.659 --> 00:33:00.939
The Bible tells us from the top to the bottom.

00:33:02.579 --> 00:33:04.779
We find these as a new and a living way

00:33:05.739 --> 00:33:07.519
that he hath consecrated for us through the veil.

00:33:07.519 --> 00:33:11.819
That is to say his flesh, he's given us access.

00:33:13.099 --> 00:33:15.999
There's one God and one mediator between God and man,

00:33:15.999 --> 00:33:18.779
the man, Christ Jesus.

00:33:19.659 --> 00:33:21.619
Listen, I'm thankful this morning that any time,

00:33:21.619 --> 00:33:25.079
any moment, any hour, any minute of the day,

00:33:25.079 --> 00:33:28.759
you can have access to God.

00:33:28.759 --> 00:33:30.659
It's a privilege.

00:33:30.659 --> 00:33:32.019
And that access is being given to us.

00:33:32.019 --> 00:33:34.899
Listen, it's a privilege for the child of God.

00:33:34.899 --> 00:33:36.539
If you've been born again this morning,

00:33:36.539 --> 00:33:38.539
if you've been saved by the blood of Christ,

00:33:38.539 --> 00:33:40.779
you have access to the throne room of heaven.

00:33:42.539 --> 00:33:44.819
Notice the Bible tells us in chapter 10

00:33:44.819 --> 00:33:47.679
in verse number 37, for yet a little while.

00:33:48.939 --> 00:33:51.179
I don't know how long a little while is,

00:33:51.739 --> 00:33:54.299
but a little while today is less than a little while was

00:33:54.299 --> 00:33:57.979
when the book was written, amen.

00:33:57.979 --> 00:34:00.059
For yet a little while.

00:34:00.059 --> 00:34:03.619
And he that, notice what it says, shall come.

00:34:03.619 --> 00:34:07.859
Not he that might come, but he that shall come.

00:34:07.859 --> 00:34:12.219
Notice what it says, will come and will not tarry.

00:34:12.219 --> 00:34:14.099
Oh, I'm looking forward to that day.

00:34:15.519 --> 00:34:17.739
The trumpet of the Lord shall sound

00:34:17.739 --> 00:34:20.839
and time shall be no more is what the songwriter said.

00:34:21.599 --> 00:34:24.599
You find the Bible teaches the imminent return of Christ.

00:34:24.599 --> 00:34:26.299
No man knows the hour.

00:34:26.299 --> 00:34:29.139
Many have attempted over the years,

00:34:29.139 --> 00:34:33.339
some even still today attempting to give a timeline,

00:34:33.339 --> 00:34:35.679
a date in which the Lord will return.

00:34:35.679 --> 00:34:37.479
No man knows the hour.

00:34:37.479 --> 00:34:39.979
But I'm thankful this morning to know the truth

00:34:39.979 --> 00:34:41.919
that Jesus is coming again.

00:34:41.919 --> 00:34:43.619
He's coming for us.

00:34:43.619 --> 00:34:44.859
What a blessing.

00:34:44.859 --> 00:34:47.599
Notice in chapter 12, we've read the verses already.

00:34:48.459 --> 00:34:51.699
In chapter 12, the Bible says in verse number two,

00:34:51.699 --> 00:34:56.539
looking, looking unto Jesus,

00:34:56.539 --> 00:35:00.139
the author, the finisher of our faith,

00:35:00.139 --> 00:35:04.019
who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross,

00:35:04.019 --> 00:35:06.079
despising the shame,

00:35:06.079 --> 00:35:10.119
and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.

00:35:10.119 --> 00:35:13.359
For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners

00:35:13.359 --> 00:35:14.719
against himself,

00:35:14.719 --> 00:35:18.019
lest you be wearied and faint in your minds.

00:35:19.219 --> 00:35:21.659
There are three other truths in the 13th chapter

00:35:21.659 --> 00:35:23.419
that I wanna draw our attention to

00:35:25.299 --> 00:35:29.019
with regard to this truth of consider Christ.

00:35:29.019 --> 00:35:32.699
In chapter 13, in verse five, the Bible says,

00:35:32.699 --> 00:35:36.139
let your conversation be without covetousness

00:35:36.139 --> 00:35:39.279
and be content with such things as you have.

00:35:39.279 --> 00:35:43.239
For he hath said, I will never leave thee nor forsake thee.

00:35:43.239 --> 00:35:45.499
Aren't you thankful for that Bible promise?

00:35:45.499 --> 00:35:47.659
His presence is with us.

00:35:47.659 --> 00:35:49.099
In verse number six, the Bible says,

00:35:49.099 --> 00:35:52.839
so that we may boldly say, the Lord is my helper,

00:35:52.839 --> 00:35:57.219
and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.

00:35:57.219 --> 00:35:59.679
Aren't you thankful that the Lord is your helper?

00:36:00.639 --> 00:36:02.579
The Bible already told us as we look back

00:36:02.579 --> 00:36:05.179
in the fourth chapter that he's able to,

00:36:05.179 --> 00:36:06.159
excuse me, the second chapter,

00:36:06.159 --> 00:36:09.079
he's able to succor them which are tempted.

00:36:09.079 --> 00:36:10.399
He's our helper.

00:36:10.399 --> 00:36:12.459
And we find that the Bible says that the Lord is my helper.

00:36:12.539 --> 00:36:14.219
I will not fear what man shall do unto me.

00:36:14.219 --> 00:36:15.919
Listen, when I understand who he is,

00:36:15.919 --> 00:36:17.719
when I understand the power that he possesses,

00:36:17.719 --> 00:36:21.319
he said, all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.

00:36:21.319 --> 00:36:22.759
He spoke and it was so.

00:36:22.759 --> 00:36:25.719
He upholds all things by the power of his word.

00:36:25.719 --> 00:36:30.239
And the Bible says that he is your helper, he's my helper.

00:36:30.239 --> 00:36:32.139
The psalmist said it this way in Psalm 121.

00:36:32.139 --> 00:36:33.959
I will lift up mine eyes into the hills

00:36:33.959 --> 00:36:35.199
from whence cometh my help.

00:36:35.199 --> 00:36:39.379
My help cometh from the Lord, which made heaven and earth.

00:36:40.239 --> 00:36:43.039
We find in verse number eight here of Hebrews 13,

00:36:43.039 --> 00:36:44.599
the Bible says Jesus Christ,

00:36:44.599 --> 00:36:48.539
the same yesterday and today and forever.

00:36:48.539 --> 00:36:51.339
He's immutable, he never changes.

00:36:51.339 --> 00:36:54.379
By the way, I am thankful for that Bible doctrine,

00:36:54.379 --> 00:36:56.159
that Bible truth.

00:36:56.159 --> 00:36:58.159
You know, if God changed,

00:36:58.159 --> 00:37:00.599
we wouldn't know how to approach him day by day.

00:37:00.599 --> 00:37:02.919
I believe that the immutability of God,

00:37:02.919 --> 00:37:05.719
if I could use this expression to explain it this morning,

00:37:05.719 --> 00:37:08.799
is kind of like the glue that holds it all together

00:37:08.819 --> 00:37:10.819
in the sense that yes, God is holy,

00:37:10.819 --> 00:37:13.139
God's revealed that, God is great, God is just,

00:37:13.139 --> 00:37:16.219
he's merciful, he's loved, he's so on and so forth,

00:37:16.219 --> 00:37:19.499
but he's immutable, he never changes.

00:37:19.499 --> 00:37:23.379
And so when God revealed to the prophets of old,

00:37:23.379 --> 00:37:26.859
to his servants of old, his abilities and his nature,

00:37:26.859 --> 00:37:29.579
his attributes, we find that still today,

00:37:29.579 --> 00:37:32.539
that's the same God that we serve.

00:37:32.539 --> 00:37:33.979
What joy that is.

00:37:33.979 --> 00:37:36.619
Notice in verse 20 of chapter 13,

00:37:36.619 --> 00:37:37.459
the Bible says,

00:37:37.459 --> 00:37:40.999
now the God of peace that brought again from the dead,

00:37:40.999 --> 00:37:43.799
our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep

00:37:43.799 --> 00:37:45.679
through the blood of the everlasting covenant,

00:37:45.679 --> 00:37:48.679
make you perfect in every good work to do his will,

00:37:48.679 --> 00:37:51.799
working in you that which is well-pleasing in his sight

00:37:51.799 --> 00:37:56.719
through Jesus Christ to whom be glory forever and ever.

00:37:56.719 --> 00:37:57.799
Amen.

00:37:57.799 --> 00:38:00.959
Notice with me from Hebrews 13 verses 20 and 21,

00:38:00.959 --> 00:38:04.679
that he is that great shepherd of the sheep.

00:38:04.699 --> 00:38:07.059
I'm so thankful that the Lord is my shepherd.

00:38:07.059 --> 00:38:09.979
We find great comfort in reading the words of Psalm 23.

00:38:09.979 --> 00:38:11.819
It's a familiar Psalm, the Lord is my shepherd,

00:38:11.819 --> 00:38:13.059
I shall not want.

00:38:13.059 --> 00:38:15.659
And we can look through the whole six verses of that Psalm

00:38:15.659 --> 00:38:18.099
and how we can be comforted and encouraged,

00:38:18.099 --> 00:38:21.059
but we find here in Hebrews 13 and verse 20 and 21,

00:38:21.059 --> 00:38:23.139
the Bible speaks about the Lord Jesus Christ

00:38:23.139 --> 00:38:25.939
being the great shepherd of the sheep.

00:38:25.939 --> 00:38:27.899
I'm thankful that he's my shepherd.

00:38:27.899 --> 00:38:30.499
I'm thankful to be within his fold, aren't you?

00:38:30.499 --> 00:38:32.779
And this morning, listen, if you're not been born again,

00:38:32.779 --> 00:38:35.959
if you've not trusted Christ as your personal savior,

00:38:35.959 --> 00:38:39.119
then he's not yet your shepherd, but he wants to be.

00:38:39.119 --> 00:38:41.319
He desires to be.

00:38:41.319 --> 00:38:42.479
He's a good shepherd.

00:38:42.479 --> 00:38:43.959
He's the great shepherd.

00:38:43.959 --> 00:38:45.839
The Bible tells us in 1 Peter chapter five

00:38:45.839 --> 00:38:48.439
that he's the chief shepherd and he shall appear.

00:38:48.439 --> 00:38:51.119
And we find this morning that as we look,

00:38:51.119 --> 00:38:53.199
and again, there's so many other passages

00:38:53.199 --> 00:38:54.019
that we could look through,

00:38:54.019 --> 00:38:56.359
even within the book of Hebrews this morning,

00:38:56.359 --> 00:38:59.839
but as we've taken this journey through the book of Hebrews,

00:38:59.899 --> 00:39:02.739
we've taken the instruction, this admonition

00:39:02.739 --> 00:39:05.839
from Hebrews 12 and verse number three, consider him.

00:39:05.839 --> 00:39:08.479
I've said it this way, consider Christ.

00:39:08.479 --> 00:39:12.679
What a portrait, what a wonderful savior.

00:39:12.679 --> 00:39:14.739
He's the creator, the sustainer, the redeemer.

00:39:14.739 --> 00:39:15.679
He's my substitute.

00:39:15.679 --> 00:39:16.899
He's the great high priest.

00:39:16.899 --> 00:39:19.859
He's the author of eternal salvation.

00:39:19.859 --> 00:39:21.019
He's the intercessor.

00:39:21.019 --> 00:39:22.659
He's coming again.

00:39:22.659 --> 00:39:23.939
Aren't you thankful for that?

00:39:23.939 --> 00:39:27.139
He's granted me access, the author and finisher of my faith.

00:39:27.139 --> 00:39:28.939
He's my helper.

00:39:28.999 --> 00:39:33.079
He is immutable and he is my great shepherd.

00:39:33.079 --> 00:39:36.159
This morning, as we truly consider Christ,

00:39:36.159 --> 00:39:38.679
I told you the introduction was longer than the message,

00:39:38.679 --> 00:39:41.199
but when we truly think over, ponder,

00:39:41.199 --> 00:39:45.359
when we really meditate and muse upon who Christ is

00:39:45.359 --> 00:39:48.879
and who he is to us, when I consider Christ,

00:39:48.879 --> 00:39:52.079
wow, what a wonderful savior.

00:39:52.079 --> 00:39:54.359
But how does it impact us?

00:39:54.359 --> 00:39:56.279
Four simple thoughts this morning.

00:39:56.279 --> 00:39:58.199
I'm not gonna spend much time on it.

00:39:58.199 --> 00:40:01.379
The hour is late, but four thoughts this morning.

00:40:01.379 --> 00:40:05.299
that I hope will help us as we consider Christ.

00:40:05.299 --> 00:40:11.939
Listen, the truth of God's Word is not supposed to just be a mental understanding, a mental

00:40:11.939 --> 00:40:14.419
understanding of who He is.

00:40:14.419 --> 00:40:18.139
It's supposed to impact how we live our lives.

00:40:18.139 --> 00:40:21.339
I understand how wonderful He is from what we've just looked at this morning.

00:40:21.339 --> 00:40:26.999
I can't understand, I can't fully comprehend how wonderful and how great He really is,

00:40:26.999 --> 00:40:31.179
but I'm thankful that He's given us the ability to understand at some level how great

00:40:31.179 --> 00:40:33.599
He is, but how does it impact us?

00:40:33.599 --> 00:40:38.059
Number one this morning, I believe when we consider Christ that we will love Him more

00:40:38.059 --> 00:40:41.679
fervently, that we will love Him more fervently.

00:40:41.679 --> 00:40:44.539
Isn't He lovable?

00:40:44.539 --> 00:40:46.919
We understand that God is love.

00:40:46.919 --> 00:40:54.379
We understand that John said it this way, that we love Him because He first loved us.

00:40:54.379 --> 00:41:02.399
We sing the song, oh, how I love Jesus, and I believe that when we truly consider Christ

00:41:02.399 --> 00:41:05.339
that we will love Him more fervently.

00:41:05.339 --> 00:41:10.519
He told us that if we love Him that we're to keep His commandments.

00:41:10.519 --> 00:41:13.959
That's the evidence, if you will, of our love for Him.

00:41:13.959 --> 00:41:18.439
Listen, people today, making a claim is simple.

00:41:18.439 --> 00:41:23.899
We can say that we love Jesus, but does the evidence support the claim?

00:41:23.919 --> 00:41:29.039
This morning, when we truly consider who Christ is, when we truly ponder and meditate and

00:41:29.039 --> 00:41:34.119
use, think over, and understanding how wonderful He is, I believe this morning it will result

00:41:34.119 --> 00:41:36.979
in us loving Him more fervently.

00:41:36.979 --> 00:41:42.159
Number two, I believe that it will result in us serving Him more faithfully.

00:41:42.159 --> 00:41:43.999
Serving Him more faithfully.

00:41:43.999 --> 00:41:47.639
When we understand that we're serving Christ, we think about all that He's done for us.

00:41:47.639 --> 00:41:54.299
We think about all that He is, all of these things, again, just from the book of Hebrews.

00:41:54.299 --> 00:41:57.499
So many other portions of scripture that we could go to this morning, but just from the

00:41:57.499 --> 00:42:02.579
book of Hebrews to these original recipients that were told, consider Him, that as you

00:42:02.579 --> 00:42:08.459
look at all of these promises and all of these wonderful truths that were revealed to them,

00:42:08.459 --> 00:42:12.899
it should result in them loving Him more fervently, but also serving Him more faithfully.

00:42:12.899 --> 00:42:16.299
You know, it's a privilege to serve the Lord.

00:42:16.299 --> 00:42:22.399
We sing the song, there's joy in serving Jesus, and there really is.

00:42:22.399 --> 00:42:28.719
The psalmist talked about being a doorkeeper in the house of God, and listen, there's no

00:42:28.719 --> 00:42:34.739
task, when you think about being a servant of the Lord, there's no task that's too low.

00:42:34.739 --> 00:42:39.279
It's a privilege to serve the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:42:39.279 --> 00:42:44.879
And when I truly consider Him, I will not only love Him more fervently, but I will serve

00:42:44.879 --> 00:42:48.039
Him more faithfully.

00:42:48.039 --> 00:42:50.699
What is it that God wants me to do?

00:42:50.699 --> 00:42:52.899
What place does He want me in?

00:42:52.899 --> 00:42:56.079
What is it that I could do for Jesus?

00:42:56.079 --> 00:43:00.239
Not so that I could earn His favor, not so that I could earn His love, not so that I

00:43:00.239 --> 00:43:05.539
could have, no, no, because I love Him, I want to serve Him, because I understand how

00:43:05.539 --> 00:43:11.119
wonderful He is, and I understand how, the greatness of who He is, and I want to serve

00:43:11.119 --> 00:43:12.459
Him more faithfully.

00:43:12.459 --> 00:43:16.979
Let me say this, number three, I'll speak of Him more passionately.

00:43:16.979 --> 00:43:22.179
You know, when we truly understand how great He is, when we truly consider Christ, it'll

00:43:22.179 --> 00:43:24.059
impact how we talk about Him.

00:43:24.059 --> 00:43:26.179
We'll speak of Him more passionately.

00:43:26.179 --> 00:43:29.999
Let me tell you about my God, let me tell you about my Savior, let me tell you how wonderful

00:43:29.999 --> 00:43:30.999
He is.

00:43:30.999 --> 00:43:36.319
See, there's a people that we live in the midst of today that simply do not know the

00:43:36.319 --> 00:43:38.699
things that we've looked at this morning.

00:43:38.699 --> 00:43:42.059
For some of us this morning that are here, maybe some of the things that you've heard

00:43:42.059 --> 00:43:45.759
this morning, you've heard them for the very first time, but maybe for some that are here

00:43:45.759 --> 00:43:50.539
this morning, you've heard this over and over, you're aware of this, you could have come

00:43:50.539 --> 00:43:54.659
to the same conclusions and looked at the same references, and you understand the greatness

00:43:54.659 --> 00:43:55.659
of God.

00:43:55.659 --> 00:44:00.739
But when we truly consider Him, we should speak of Him more passionately.

00:44:00.739 --> 00:44:05.019
Let me tell you about my God, let me tell you about what Jesus did for me, let me tell

00:44:05.019 --> 00:44:10.339
you how He changed my life, let me tell you how He's my helper.

00:44:11.099 --> 00:44:16.099
How do you handle the troubles and the trials of life, how do you continue on in the midst

00:44:16.099 --> 00:44:18.059
of great turmoil?

00:44:18.059 --> 00:44:20.659
Because Jesus is my helper.

00:44:20.659 --> 00:44:24.579
I'm not doing it at my own strength, I'm not doing it at my own power, the trials will

00:44:24.579 --> 00:44:30.859
come and the storms will arise, but Jesus is my helper.

00:44:30.859 --> 00:44:33.219
And I speak of Him more passionately, why?

00:44:33.219 --> 00:44:35.999
Because I know Him.

00:44:35.999 --> 00:44:40.679
We should be gaining in our knowledge of Him day by day, we should never be content

00:44:40.679 --> 00:44:44.959
with the place that we're at, we should say as Paul said, that I may know Him and the

00:44:44.959 --> 00:44:46.599
power of His resurrection.

00:44:46.599 --> 00:44:50.799
And we ought to say as we look at the truth of God's Word, that as we know these things

00:44:50.799 --> 00:44:54.239
that I'm going to speak of Him more passionately.

00:44:54.239 --> 00:45:00.719
Listen, I think you would agree with me this morning that there are some things that are

00:45:00.719 --> 00:45:08.319
spoken of in our society today that are spoken of with great passion that are just false.

00:45:08.319 --> 00:45:15.439
There's just no truth in what the cause is that the people are speaking about passionately.

00:45:15.439 --> 00:45:17.119
Can I get a witness, amen?

00:45:17.119 --> 00:45:19.159
Would you agree with that this morning?

00:45:19.159 --> 00:45:25.439
But listen, we serve the living Christ, we serve the King of kings and Lord of lords,

00:45:25.439 --> 00:45:30.039
we know that He's true, we know that He's righteous, we know that He's the Redeemer,

00:45:30.039 --> 00:45:34.479
and we ought to speak of Him with great passion.

00:45:34.479 --> 00:45:38.819
He said, I am with you, we don't have to fear.

00:45:38.819 --> 00:45:42.719
Remember the truth of Hebrews 13, we looked at it a moment ago, so that we might boldly

00:45:42.719 --> 00:45:48.259
say the Lord is my helper, I will not fear what man shall do unto me.

00:45:48.259 --> 00:45:53.879
This morning, when we truly consider Christ, we'll love Him more fervently, we'll serve

00:45:53.879 --> 00:45:59.119
Him more faithfully, we'll speak of Him more passionately, and I believe this, number four,

00:45:59.199 --> 00:46:04.199
we will obey Him continuously, we'll obey Him continuously.

00:46:04.199 --> 00:46:09.359
I'm not speaking of sinless perfection, I'm just simply speaking of a life that's marked

00:46:09.359 --> 00:46:13.279
by obedience, because I'm considering Christ.

00:46:13.279 --> 00:46:18.959
See, the example of Christ, according to what Peter said, he left us an example that we

00:46:18.959 --> 00:46:20.839
should follow his steps.

00:46:20.839 --> 00:46:26.399
According to what John says, that he obeyed always.

00:46:26.399 --> 00:46:32.399
He was obedient unto death, even the death of the cross, we read in the book of Philippians.

00:46:32.399 --> 00:46:39.759
And this morning, you know that the life of a believer should be marked by obedience?

00:46:39.759 --> 00:46:42.979
Your life and my life should be marked by obedience.

00:46:42.979 --> 00:46:47.719
It ought not be that the life of a believer is marked by disobedience.

00:46:47.719 --> 00:46:53.779
If the life of a believer is marked by disobedience, I would say they've not yet considered Christ.

00:46:53.779 --> 00:46:59.259
They have a small view of Jesus, but we have a proper view of who He is.

00:46:59.259 --> 00:47:00.259
Think about Isaiah.

00:47:00.259 --> 00:47:04.819
He saw God high, holy, and lifted up, his train filled the temple, he says, woe is me.

00:47:04.819 --> 00:47:07.699
And then he says, here am I, send me, I mean, what do you want me to do?

00:47:07.699 --> 00:47:13.059
I will go, I will go, I will do, I will serve.

00:47:13.059 --> 00:47:19.099
A life marked by obedience, that's what our lives should be marked by.

00:47:19.099 --> 00:47:26.259
When we truly consider Christ, when we see Him for who He is, when we understand what

00:47:26.259 --> 00:47:31.739
we've looked at this morning, and we've pondered, we've meditated, listen, I hope every day

00:47:31.739 --> 00:47:33.939
of your life that you consider Christ.

00:47:33.939 --> 00:47:36.619
This isn't just a one-time event, it's not just a one-time thing.

00:47:36.619 --> 00:47:39.859
Listen, every day in your prayer life, you ought to be rejoicing and thanking God for

00:47:39.859 --> 00:47:40.859
who He is.

00:47:40.859 --> 00:47:44.099
You ought to get in your Bible and you ought to understand these attributes that we've

00:47:44.099 --> 00:47:48.579
looked at this morning, and as you understand these attributes, thank God for them and stand

00:47:48.579 --> 00:47:53.819
in light of who He is and see how it will impact our lives.

00:47:53.819 --> 00:48:00.079
It's simple instruction, consider Christ, but the exercise is impactful.

00:48:00.079 --> 00:48:05.399
And as we truly consider Christ, I believe that this morning we'll love Him more fervently,

00:48:05.399 --> 00:48:10.139
we will serve Him more faithfully, we will speak of Him more passionately, and we will

00:48:10.139 --> 00:48:13.259
live lives that are marked by obedience.

00:48:13.259 --> 00:48:15.659
We will obey Him continuously.

00:48:15.739 --> 00:48:22.939
I hope this morning that as you would survey your own life, you would evaluate, examine,

00:48:22.939 --> 00:48:25.619
you'd say, how's my love for Jesus?

00:48:25.619 --> 00:48:31.139
How's my service to the King?

00:48:31.139 --> 00:48:35.299
How am I speaking of Him and for Him?

00:48:35.299 --> 00:48:38.739
How's my obedience?

00:48:38.739 --> 00:48:43.939
This morning, the remedy might simply be, consider Christ.

00:48:43.939 --> 00:48:48.859
You say, my love's kind of, you know what they said in Ephesus, Jesus said, John wrote,

00:48:48.859 --> 00:48:52.219
you've left your first love, right?

00:48:52.219 --> 00:48:56.539
Revelation chapter 2, I have somewhat against you, right?

00:48:56.539 --> 00:48:59.539
You left your first love.

00:48:59.539 --> 00:49:04.219
I know your works, He says to those churches, their service.

00:49:04.219 --> 00:49:08.579
Listen, sometimes the remedy for some of those things, you say, man, I examine my life and

00:49:08.579 --> 00:49:13.739
I consider Christ, and I believe it will come into focus, and we'll be able to serve

00:49:13.739 --> 00:49:18.019
Him and love Him and speak of Him and obey Him the way that we should.

00:49:18.019 --> 00:49:19.019
Let's pray.

00:49:19.019 --> 00:49:20.019
Father, we love You.

00:49:20.019 --> 00:49:22.499
We thank You for loving us.

00:49:22.499 --> 00:49:25.579
I know this morning that we looked at a lot of Scripture.

00:49:25.579 --> 00:49:31.739
God, we want to get a portrait of our Savior.

00:49:31.739 --> 00:49:35.579
This morning, we want to consider Christ.

00:49:35.579 --> 00:49:42.579
I pray that as we've looked at these Scriptures, we've impacted our lives.

00:49:42.579 --> 00:49:54.379
Lord, I pray that we would love You, serve You, speak of You, and obey You as we should.

00:49:54.379 --> 00:49:59.379
I pray that our lives would be marked by obedience, not by disobedience.

00:49:59.379 --> 00:50:01.339
Lord, I pray that if there's...

00:50:01.339 --> 00:50:08.579
some deficiency in our lives in any of those areas that we would consider Christ. I pray

00:50:08.579 --> 00:50:16.379
God that we'd, as the songwriter said, turn your eyes upon Jesus. That we'd see you in

00:50:16.379 --> 00:50:22.539
all of your fullness and all of your glory. The things of this world will grow strangely

00:50:22.539 --> 00:50:31.199
dim in the light of your glory and grace. Lord, I pray if there's one here this morning

00:50:31.199 --> 00:50:35.479
that's not saved, they've never trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal Savior.

00:50:35.479 --> 00:50:40.999
Oh God, I pray that today would be the day of their salvation. You said that today is

00:50:40.999 --> 00:50:47.399
the day of salvation. No man knoweth what a day would bring forth. Boast not thyself

00:50:47.399 --> 00:50:53.239
of tomorrow. Oh, if there's one that needs to be saved, I pray that you would draw them

00:50:53.239 --> 00:50:56.959
to yourself. That we'd have the opportunity to take a Bible and show them how they can

00:50:56.959 --> 00:51:03.159
know for sure that heaven is their home. No more hoping or wishing, but knowing with

00:51:03.159 --> 00:51:08.479
assurance that heaven is their home. Why? Because you are the Savior. You're the substitute,

00:51:08.479 --> 00:51:13.639
the Redeemer. Oh God, I pray for your children this morning. I pray that you'd help each

00:51:13.639 --> 00:51:22.519
and every one of us to consider you. Lord, help that time of meditation, of pondering

00:51:22.519 --> 00:51:26.799
to have a profound impact on how we live our lives. Would you work in these moments

00:51:26.799 --> 00:51:30.799
of invitation as only you can. We'll be careful to give you the honor and glory for all that

00:51:30.799 --> 00:51:33.279
you'll do. For it's in Christ's name we pray. Would you stand with me?
