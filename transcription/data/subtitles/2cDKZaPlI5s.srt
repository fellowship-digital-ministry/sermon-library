1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
That was just free tonight, amen, just an addendum to the song.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Genesis chapter 41, we're going to finish this chapter tonight.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And someone misunderstood me this morning and thought I was finishing the life of Joseph tonight.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
But just chapter 41, just this section of the life of Joseph.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And we got lots of chapters left here through the end of the book of Genesis chapter 50.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
But we look at Genesis chapter 41, we spent a few weeks in this particular chapter.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It is a lengthy chapter, it's 57 verses, and a lot of things happen.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I mean, it is a chapter that is filled with information.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And if you think about the life of Joseph and where we've been the last couple of weeks as we've studied through Genesis 41,

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
we find that those first seven years after Joseph is promoted,

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
we'll give him the title this evening as Prime Minister over Egypt, if we could use that terminology tonight.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And I understand the Bible doesn't say that, it says that he's second in charge, second in command.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
But if we could use that terminology, he's set in that place.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Pharaoh had made him ruler over all the land of Egypt.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And as Joseph is promoted to that place, that position of Prime Minister,

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
we find that those first seven years after he reaches that place, that position,

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
are described for us in verse 29 of Genesis 41 as being great plenty.

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Notice what the Bible says.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Behold, there come seven years, not just seven years of plenty,

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
but the Bible says seven years of great plenty.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And throughout all the land of Egypt, I believe that for those seven years of great plenty,

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
they reaped a harvest that was unlike anything they had ever experienced in their lives.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I believe that as they were going through and reaping during those seven years,

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
there were probably comments that would be made of,

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
man, we've never had a harvest like this before, and so on and so forth.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And there's seven years of great plenty.

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
We find that during those seven years, they are filled with a number of changes in the life of Joseph.

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Remember, when we started Genesis 41, he's in prison.

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
He interprets the dream, he's placed in that position, and the seven years begin.

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And we spoke about those seven years of great plenty last week.

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And so we see that Joseph, just in Genesis 41, he has a new position.

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I would say that he has a new home, a palace, a new place to live.

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
He is no longer there in the prison house.

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
He has a new wife, and he has two new sons.

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
And we spoke about those sons last week, and as we looked at the names of those sons,

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
and we talked about being fruitful in the land of affliction.

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And even in the midst of affliction, we can have that fruitfulness that Joseph describes,

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
and it requires that we forget some things, and then we see how God has blessed.

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
In addition to all of this, all of these changes in Genesis 41,

40
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Joseph had the great responsibility to prepare the nation for those seven years of famine

41
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
that would be, according to verse number 30 and 31, very grievous and would consume the land.

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Notice we read in verse 29 that those seven years, they would be of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt.

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
But then notice in verse 30 of Genesis 41, it says,

44
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
And there shall arise after them seven years of famine, and all the plenty,

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
notice what it says, shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt.

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And the famine shall, notice it says, consume the land.

47
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
The plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of the famine following,

48
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
for it shall be very grievous.

49
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And of course, God had given Joseph the wisdom that was necessary in order to give counsel to Pharaoh

50
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
with regard to what to do because of this dream that had been interpreted.

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And as we kind of skip into our passage this evening,

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
and we begin to think about the plan that God had given Joseph,

53
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
we would see that as God gave Joseph that great wisdom, that his plan was effective.

54
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
We are told that Joseph went throughout all the land.

55
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,000
In verse number 49, it tells us that he laid up that food.

56
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
In fact, at the end of verse number 45, it says that Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt.

57
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
At the end of verse number 46, it says that he, Joseph, went out from the presence of Pharaoh

58
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
and went throughout all the land of Egypt.

59
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
And it was during those seven plenteous years,

60
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
those years that were described in verse number 29 as being great plenty,

61
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
that Joseph went out and he gathered up, according to verse number 48,

62
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt.

63
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
And he laid up the food in the cities, the food of the field, which was round about every city,

64
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
laid he up in the same.

65
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And verse 49 tells us, and Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea very much

66
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
until he left numbering, for it was without number.

67
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,000
In these great days of plenty, Joseph was faithful to do what God had revealed to him.

68
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
He was faithful to complete the task that he had been entrusted with by Pharaoh

69
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
on storing up during those seven years.

70
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Remember, God had given Joseph the wisdom to be able to provide that counsel

71
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
as to what should take place during those seven years of great plenty.

72
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
According to verse number 34, they were to take up 20% of that which was produced

73
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,000
during those years of great plenty and store it so that they would have food during the famine.

74
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
We find that this plan was effective. Why was it effective?

75
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Well, because it was God's plan and God had revealed it to Joseph.

76
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And the effectiveness of the plan is seen throughout the portion of Scripture.

77
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
But we see that those days of great plenty ended.

78
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And as we enter into our text of Scripture this evening, in verse number 53,

79
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
notice what the Bible says, and we'll look at verse 53 down through the end of the chapter.

80
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:03,000
The Bible says, and the seven years of plenteousness that was in the land of Egypt were ended.

81
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
They were ended.

82
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And it says in verse number 54, and the seven years of dearth began to come.

83
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:20,000
According as Joseph had said, the dearth was in all lands, but in all the lands of Egypt there was bread.

84
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
When all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread,

85
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph, what he saith to you, do.

86
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And the famine was over all the face of the earth, and Joseph opened all the storehouses

87
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
and sold unto the Egyptians, and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt,

88
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
and all countries came unto Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn,

89
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
because the famine was so sore in all lands.

90
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I've titled the message from verse number 54 this evening, the seven years of dearth began.

91
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
The seven years of dearth began.

92
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
We notice as we conclude the chapter, I just read the verses,

93
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
but God reveals to us really in verse 56 and verse number 57,

94
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
how this circumstance, this great famine that was upon the land,

95
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
that was described as being very grievous, that would consume the land,

96
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
that God reveals to us how this would be the catalyst, if you will,

97
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
that would eventually bring Jacob and his family into the land of Egypt.

98
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Because the Bible says that all countries, verse 57, came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn,

99
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
because the famine was so sore, notice, in all lands.

100
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Now, it's kind of interesting, if you look at the end of verse number 57,

101
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
before we get into the message this evening, notice that little word, so.

102
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
We're familiar with that when we read John 3, 16,

103
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
for God so loved the world.

104
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
And you think about the impact when God is explaining to us

105
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
the terribleness, if you will, of this famine.

106
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
This is because the famine was so sore in all lands.

107
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
As you enter into the 42nd chapter, you find that the Bible tells us

108
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
that Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt.

109
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
And again, God would use this circumstance as really a catalyst

110
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
that would eventually bring Jacob and his family into the land of Egypt.

111
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
And it's a time in which Joseph eventually would reveal his person,

112
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
his identity to his brothers, and he would say this,

113
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
God sent me before you for what purpose? To preserve life.

114
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
And God was using Joseph in this land of affliction, as he refers to it in verse number 52,

115
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
but God was using him and God had a purpose.

116
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And I want you to think about these seven years of famine,

117
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
and as we've looked at the title, the seven years of dearth began.

118
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Consider just a couple of things with me this evening.

119
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Number one, I want you to consider with me the cry of the people.

120
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
The cry of the people.

121
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
As we notice in verse number 55 of our text of Scripture,

122
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
the Bible gives us a description. It's a dim description.

123
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
The Bible had told us, and we spent some time looking

124
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
and reminding ourselves of what we've studied throughout this 41st chapter already,

125
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
but we find that the Bible told us in verse number 30

126
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
that those years of famine would rise, and then notice what it says in verse number 30,

127
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
and all the plenty, notice what it says, shall be forgotten.

128
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Now think about that, because during those seven years of great plenty,

129
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
as it's described in verse 29, I believe again that many were saying,

130
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
we've never had a harvest like this, but then when that great famine comes,

131
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
those years of great plenty are forgotten.

132
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And why are they forgotten? Well, because it's severe, it's grievous,

133
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
it's going to consume the land.

134
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It's amazing what people will do when they have no food.

135
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It's amazing what people will do when there's no food.

136
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
And we find that as we look at the cry of the people, notice what God tells us in verse number 55,

137
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
and when all the land of Egypt, what does it say, was famished, was famished.

138
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Sometimes our children will say, I'm starving.

139
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You ever hear your kids say that?

140
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Maybe some of you wives, you've heard your husband say, I'm starving.

141
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
And you're like, you could...

142
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,760
live for days without eating, right? Like, you are not starving, you're okay. I'm going to die,

143
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:11,840
I'm so hungry. No, we've never probably truly experienced that. But the reality is that God

144
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:19,680
tells us here that the land, and it says all the land of Egypt, was famished. And it reveals to us

145
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,879
as we think about that statement in verse number 55, as we enter into this portion of scripture,

146
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:33,599
it reveals to us that this famine was so severe that it had an immediate impact. I mean, when

147
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:40,639
those, can you imagine, and God is in this, right? See, our God is the creator. This idea of mother

148
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:45,119
nature, no, no, God's in control of everything. God's the one that sends the rain, God's the one

149
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:50,959
that withholds the rain. In fact, for the children of Israel, they were told that God would send the

150
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:58,080
rain as a blessing, and that God would withhold the rain as judgment. Amen? And often, as you look

151
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:04,959
throughout the scriptures, you find that times, periods of drought and famine, were the direct

152
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:12,480
result of God's divine judgment upon his people. And so God brings this famine. He had revealed it,

153
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,199
of course, in his grace and his mercy, through this dream that Pharaoh has, and Joseph is able

154
00:11:17,199 --> 00:11:23,599
to interpret and give the counsel, but this particular famine had an immediate and severe

155
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:30,400
impact. The land, it says all the land of Egypt was famished, and then notice the Bible says that

156
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:39,519
the people, the people of Egypt, they cried to Pharaoh for bread. Over the next several weeks,

157
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:44,080
as we study throughout the next several portions of scripture in the book of Genesis, we'll see

158
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:50,000
to what extent people will go when they're hungry, what they will be willing to sell, and what they

159
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,680
will be willing to do, and in order to be able to get some food. It's no doubt in my mind, it's going

160
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:01,199
to be quite easy when things happen during the tribulation time, and they say, well, you're going

161
00:12:01,199 --> 00:12:05,199
to need to have this mark right here if you want to have some food, if you want to be able to buy,

162
00:12:05,199 --> 00:12:08,559
sell, or trade. It's going to be very, people are going to line up and say, where do you want to put

163
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:13,039
it? Which hand? Where out of my forehead? I mean, I'll take it, I'll have it in all three places. I

164
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:18,559
mean, people will really be that way. They'll be ready to do it, and we find here this evening, as

165
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:22,800
we continue, and again, over the next several weeks, we continue to look throughout the portions of

166
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:29,919
scripture here in the book of Genesis to see the depth of how this famine impacted the people,

167
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:35,759
but the people cried to Pharaoh for bread. I want you to think about this just for a moment. As we

168
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:40,320
think about the cry of the people, you know, in times of crisis, I believe that this here was a

169
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,800
time of crisis for the Egyptians. It was a time of crisis not only for the Egyptians, but we find

170
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:51,199
that for all of the world, because it affected not just Egypt, but all countries were impacted

171
00:12:51,199 --> 00:12:56,800
because of this famine. In fact, in verse 56, it says, and the famine was over all the face of the earth.

172
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,720
And we find that as this famine would impact, it was a time of great crisis, and you find that in a

173
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:10,559
time of crisis that people need direction. People need direction in time of crisis. People become

174
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:21,839
desperate in time of crisis. We think about time of crisis, and we see it here in this portion of

175
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:27,520
scripture, and we see the response of the people, and I wonder tonight, as we understand that the

176
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:33,119
people cry, and they cry to Pharaoh for bread, I wonder this evening in time of great distress,

177
00:13:33,119 --> 00:13:38,559
in time of crisis, in time of great difficulty, to whom do we look? To whom do we cry?

178
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:47,039
Because we find that here, the Bible tells us that these folks, that they cried, the people cried

179
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:54,399
to Pharaoh for bread. They were desperate. They were in need. They were famished. They were hungry.

180
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:02,000
Times of great desperation led them to a place where they were crying out to Pharaoh. As we look

181
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,720
at the text of scripture, we not only see the cry of the people, but we see, number two, the counsel

182
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,800
of Pharaoh. The counsel of Pharaoh. I want you to notice, and we're going to spend the remainder of

183
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:15,039
our time here on looking at the response of Pharaoh and what takes place. The Bible says,

184
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:20,160
and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, notice what he says, notice the counsel that Pharaoh gives,

185
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:29,200
go unto Joseph, what he saith to you, do. Now I want you to think about Pharaoh. He is the,

186
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:37,040
he's the man in charge. Joseph is second in command. Pharaoh is the man in charge, and the

187
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:43,279
people cry unto Pharaoh and say, give us bread. They're desperate. They're pleading. They're

188
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:50,239
crying for some help, and Pharaoh says, go to Joseph. And whatever Joseph says, what he saith to

189
00:14:50,239 --> 00:14:56,079
you, do. Now we have to back up, and I know this is review, but remember that back in verse number

190
00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:02,880
33, after Joseph interpreted the dream, Joseph begins to give this action plan, if you will,

191
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,600
to Pharaoh. And here's what he says, now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man, discreet and wise,

192
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,399
and send him over the land of Egypt. Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the

193
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,160
land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years. We're not

194
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:22,480
going to read all of it, but we find that Joseph is providing this counsel and instruction, and

195
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:29,839
Pharaoh concludes in verse number 38, he says to his servants, can we find such a one as this is,

196
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:39,200
a man in whom the Spirit of God is. And we find that Joseph is given this place of,

197
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:47,359
of power, of position. We mentioned last week how that Joseph was given a new name, and he was given

198
00:15:47,359 --> 00:15:53,839
that new name, and we mentioned that, and that Pharaoh gave him that name, and the name is

199
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:58,320
recorded for us. Notice in verse number 42, and Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put

200
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:04,000
it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck,

201
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,399
and he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had. And they cried before him, bow the

202
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:14,000
knee, and he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt. And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh,

203
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,959
without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt. And Pharaoh called

204
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:24,480
Joseph's name Zaphnath-Paneah, and he gave him to wife Asenath. But we mentioned last week in

205
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,119
verse number 45, as you see that name, and again there's some level of debate with regard to what

206
00:16:29,119 --> 00:16:36,239
that name really means, and there's some debate and discussion amongst theologians and Jewish

207
00:16:36,239 --> 00:16:43,200
rabbis with regard to that, but really it seems that the most likely interpretation of what that

208
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:51,519
name means is God speaks and he lives. God speaks and he lives, or and he giveth life. And you think

209
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:57,040
about what Pharaoh was recognizing in giving that name to Joseph. He could have named him whatever

210
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:04,239
he wanted to name him. And because of what had transpired, we find that Pharaoh gives that name,

211
00:17:04,239 --> 00:17:12,480
and Joseph is now in this position, and when the people come and they cry there to Pharaoh for help,

212
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:19,279
and they cry because they want bread, this time of great difficulty, this time of when the land

213
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:28,480
is famished, and they cry for bread, and Pharaoh says, go unto Joseph. What he saith to you, do.

214
00:17:28,959 --> 00:17:34,160
Now this evening as we look at this portion of Scripture, and I don't always go this route,

215
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:40,559
but you find in the Bible there's a lot of types, typologies. And I believe that it's important

216
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:45,760
this evening that we look at this and see the typology that the Lord is giving us. We see

217
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:50,079
the interpretation, when we talk about hermeneutics and interpreting Scripture,

218
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:55,679
we see that at face value this is an event that happened in the land of Egypt. This famine was

219
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:02,640
real, the people were famished, the people had no bread, and they cry out for help, and Pharaoh says,

220
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:09,600
go to Joseph. And that's truly what happens, but there's typologies in the Bible. And I believe

221
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,959
this evening as we look at this portion of Scripture, and I want you to consider this with

222
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:17,920
me, we'll make some application in our own lives, but I want you to know and consider with me that

223
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:25,920
Egypt and Pharaoh are really types, and they represent the world and its system. You understand

224
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:32,400
that the world has a system. The Bible says that we're to be not conformed to this world,

225
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,000
but to be transformed by the renewing of our mind, that we may prove what is that good and

226
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,000
acceptable and perfect will of God in Romans chapter number 12. And we find that Egypt and

227
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Pharaoh, as you study through the Old Testament, as you look into the typologies and you read into

228
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:54,159
even the New Testament, how that it's a picture, a type of the world and the world system. The world

229
00:18:54,159 --> 00:18:58,320
still is in existence. The Bible tells us this, love not the world, neither the things that are

230
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:03,280
in the world, right? And the world fadeth away, it passeth away. We understand that in 1 John chapter

231
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:09,200
number 2. And so we find this evening that Egypt and Pharaoh, and we find that Pharaoh is the one

232
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,919
that's addressed. And so these people that are famished, these people that are in great distress,

233
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:18,239
this time of great crisis when people are desperate and they're looking for direction,

234
00:19:18,239 --> 00:19:21,679
they're looking for leadership, where do they go? Well, they go to Pharaoh. It makes sense.

235
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:30,400
You know what Pharaoh says? I can't help you. In essence, what Pharaoh says is, I can't help you.

236
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:39,919
Go to Joseph. There was nothing that he could do. Joseph is a type of the Lord Jesus Christ.

237
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:46,559
Now understand this evening, he's not the Lord Jesus Christ. He's simply a type of the Lord

238
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:52,080
Jesus Christ. And as we study, we have the opportunity through these types and typologies

239
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,159
in the Old Testament, you have opportunity to see these glimpses and to see these truths.

240
00:19:56,159 --> 00:19:59,919
And we find this evening that Joseph is a type of the Lord.

241
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:04,919
And so we find this evening that if Egypt and Pharaoh represent the world and its system,

242
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:08,919
and Joseph represents or is a type of the Lord Jesus Christ,

243
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:13,919
and we begin to make application from this portion of Scripture tonight in our lives,

244
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,919
understand tonight that you're going to face times of crisis.

245
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:22,919
You're gonna face times of great difficulty, of distress, of being overwhelmed,

246
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:27,919
and needing direction, and desiring for someone to provide for something

247
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:29,919
that you have need of.

248
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,919
And the question, as we mentioned in that first point, the cry of the people,

249
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,919
to whom do we look? To whom do we go?

250
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:38,919
Notice what happens if you think about God's people.

251
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:42,919
Turn to the book of Isaiah, if you will, and go to Isaiah chapter number 30.

252
00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:45,919
We're gonna look at a couple of passages here in the book of Isaiah,

253
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,919
and then we're gonna go to the New Testament and make some final application this evening.

254
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,919
But I want you to consider, as we look at this historical event,

255
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:58,919
this recorded event that took place in the life of Joseph,

256
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:03,919
but how it applies for us tonight in our own lives.

257
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:09,919
In Isaiah chapter number 30,

258
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:15,919
the Bible says this in verse number 1, Isaiah 30 and verse number 1,

259
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:20,919
Woe to the rebellious children, saith the Lord,

260
00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:27,919
that take counsel, but then notice these words, but not of me.

261
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,919
But take counsel, but not of me.

262
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:36,919
And that cover with a covering, but not of my spirit,

263
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:40,919
that they may add sin to sin.

264
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:44,919
Notice verse number 2, that walk to go down into where?

265
00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:47,919
Egypt. It's a picture of what? It's a type of what?

266
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,919
The world and the world system.

267
00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:57,919
And then notice this last phrase, and have not asked at my mouth.

268
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:02,919
Can you imagine? It's just to strengthen themselves in the strength of who?

269
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:04,919
Pharaoh.

270
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:08,919
And to trust in the shadow of Egypt.

271
00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:13,919
So who is Isaiah prophesying to? He's prophesying to God's people.

272
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,919
To the children of Israel. He's prophesying to them.

273
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,919
And he's saying, woe to the rebellious children.

274
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:25,919
Why is this woe being given? And understand that it says, saith the Lord.

275
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:30,919
Isaiah is the human prophet, but he's delivering the message that God has given.

276
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:34,919
And he says that you're taking counsel, but not of me.

277
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:38,919
And then he provides further insight as to what they were really doing

278
00:22:38,919 --> 00:22:41,919
and how they were operating, so that they couldn't say,

279
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:44,919
what are you talking about? We're not taking counsel. No, here's what you're doing.

280
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:48,919
You're running down to Egypt.

281
00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:50,919
To the world.

282
00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:55,919
And then notice what he says, and this is so powerful in my mind,

283
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,919
and I hope that we grasp the concept this evening.

284
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:03,919
It says this, and have not asked at my mouth.

285
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,919
I said this this morning as I was preaching on the subject of prayer.

286
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:12,919
I said it's a wonderful truth to know that God hears and answers prayer.

287
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:17,919
But to know that he hears and answers prayer and not pray,

288
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,919
just doesn't make sense.

289
00:23:20,919 --> 00:23:23,919
It's of no help. Would you agree?

290
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,919
God hears and answers prayer, but I don't pray.

291
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:29,919
Well, that doesn't even make sense.

292
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,919
And here the Bible says that the people of God,

293
00:23:32,919 --> 00:23:35,919
the children, the rebellious children as they're described here,

294
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:39,919
that they have not asked at my mouth.

295
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,919
What if they just would have asked for counsel?

296
00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:45,919
What if they just would have sought the face of God?

297
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,919
What if they would have desired wisdom and counsel

298
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,919
from God instead of from the world?

299
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:55,919
Listen, you understand this evening, the world's not going to give you counsel

300
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:57,919
that's going to align with this book.

301
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,919
The world is not going to provide you with counsel

302
00:24:00,919 --> 00:24:04,919
that is going to align with what thus saith the Lord.

303
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:07,919
In fact, if you go to the world for counsel,

304
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,919
many times their counsel is going to be contrary

305
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:13,919
to what you find in God's Word.

306
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,919
Why? For the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God.

307
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:19,919
For there are foolishness unto him, neither can he know them.

308
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,919
Why? Because they are spiritually discerned, 1 Corinthians 2.

309
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:27,919
And we find here that God is sent in this indictment against his people

310
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:31,919
because they're taking counsel but not from God.

311
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:35,919
They're running down to Egypt, or walking to go down into Egypt,

312
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:38,919
but have not asked of My mouth.

313
00:24:38,919 --> 00:24:41,919
God says ask. And what?

314
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,919
Ye shall receive.

315
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:46,919
Is that not a promise?

316
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:49,919
He says ye have not

317
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,919
because ye ask not.

318
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:55,919
Right? Is that what He says? Is that Bible?

319
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,919
And we find here this evening that He says that you've not asked of My mouth

320
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:01,919
to strengthen themselves. Notice where it says,

321
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,919
in the strength of Pharaoh. Now this is amazing to me

322
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:07,919
because I think about the children of Israel.

323
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,919
We have the Bible and we can read back

324
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:13,919
and we can understand all that happened with the Exodus

325
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:16,919
and so on and so forth. And I understand the Exodus is

326
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:19,919
after what we've read in Genesis 41 this evening

327
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,919
but Isaiah is after the Exodus.

328
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:25,919
So I think it's fair that we could say that the children of Israel

329
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,919
were aware of what happened during the Exodus.

330
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:33,919
The children of God during the time of Isaiah's prophecy

331
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,919
were aware of the Exodus. They were aware of the plagues.

332
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:40,919
They could read the Psalms. They could read the book of Exodus.

333
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:43,919
They could be aware of what God did.

334
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,919
And let me ask you this. Who had more power?

335
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:50,919
God or Pharaoh?

336
00:25:50,919 --> 00:25:53,919
Was it abundantly clear?

337
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:59,919
So clear that even the magicians of Egypt

338
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:04,919
said this is the finger of God.

339
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:07,919
They asked Pharaoh, do you not see

340
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:10,919
that the land is devastated? I mean how long

341
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:14,919
are you going to allow these people to be a snare unto us?

342
00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:17,919
God made it abundantly clear and abundantly obvious

343
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,919
that He is the one that has all power.

344
00:26:20,919 --> 00:26:24,919
That He has more power than Pharaoh.

345
00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:27,919
Would you agree? But look at verse number 2.

346
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,919
These people that would have known that, it says

347
00:26:30,919 --> 00:26:37,919
to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh.

348
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:40,919
Why do we want Pharaoh's strength?

349
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:43,919
If Pharaoh's strength is inferior

350
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,919
to God's strength,

351
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:48,919
why do we want Pharaoh's strength?

352
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:52,919
Do you understand? But this is what they're doing.

353
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:54,919
It says at the end of verse number 2,

354
00:26:54,919 --> 00:27:00,919
and to trust in the shadow of Egypt.

355
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:03,919
The world.

356
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,919
Trust in the Lord.

357
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:09,919
Right? Proverbs 3 verse number 5 and 6.

358
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,919
With all thine heart and lean not.

359
00:27:12,919 --> 00:27:15,919
You know the verses, right?

360
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:18,919
And we find here this evening that they are going to

361
00:27:18,919 --> 00:27:22,919
seek to be strengthened by the strength of Pharaoh

362
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:24,919
who is inferior to God Almighty

363
00:27:24,919 --> 00:27:26,919
and God had made it abundantly clear

364
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:28,919
and demonstrated that truth.

365
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:30,919
And then they're going to trust

366
00:27:30,919 --> 00:27:33,919
in the shadow of Egypt.

367
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:36,919
That's a sad commentary, is it not?

368
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:39,919
I mean, what a sad, sad indictment

369
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:41,919
against the children of Israel here.

370
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,919
And we find that we are to abide.

371
00:27:44,919 --> 00:27:46,919
You don't need to turn there,

372
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:49,919
but I'm mindful this evening of the truth of Psalm 91.

373
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,919
He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High

374
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:56,919
shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.

375
00:27:56,919 --> 00:27:59,919
Not the shadow of Pharaoh of Egypt,

376
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:01,919
but of the shadow of the Almighty.

377
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:05,919
I will say to the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress.

378
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,919
My God, in Him will I trust.

379
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:11,919
Wow.

380
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:13,919
If we know the Lord,

381
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:17,919
why are we going to run to Egypt?

382
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:20,919
Look at Isaiah 31.

383
00:28:20,919 --> 00:28:24,919
We see the indictment in Isaiah 30,

384
00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:28,919
but we see it continue in chapter 31.

385
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:31,919
Woe to them, verse number 1,

386
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:35,919
that go down to Egypt for help

387
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,919
and stay on horses and trust in chariots.

388
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:40,919
Why are they trusting in chariots?

389
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:42,919
Because there aren't any.

390
00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:44,919
And in horsemen, because why?

391
00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:46,919
They're very strong.

392
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:52,919
But they look not unto the Holy One of Israel,

393
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:56,919
neither seek the Lord.

394
00:28:56,919 --> 00:28:59,919
Verse 2, yet He also is wise and will bring evil

395
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:01,919
and will not call back His words,

396
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,919
but will rise against the house of the evildoers

397
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:06,919
and against the help of them that work iniquity.

398
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:09,919
Now the Egyptians, notice what God says here

399
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:10,919
in verse number 3.

400
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:17,919
Now the Egyptians are men and not God,

401
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:22,919
and their horses flesh and not spirit.

402
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:25,919
When the Lord shall stretch out His hand,

403
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:27,919
both he that helpeth shall fall

404
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:29,919
and he that is hopin' shall fall down

405
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:32,919
and they shall fail together.

406
00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:35,919
He says, woe to them that go down to Egypt for help.

407
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:38,919
They look not unto the Holy One of Israel,

408
00:29:38,919 --> 00:29:41,919
neither seek the Lord.

409
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:43,919
The psalmist says in Psalm 121,

410
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:45,919
we used it as a theme verse a couple of years ago.

411
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:47,919
I will lift up mine eyes into the hills

412
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,919
from whence cometh my help.

413
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,919
My help cometh from the Lord,

414
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:56,919
which made heaven and earth.

415
00:29:56,919 --> 00:29:59,919
And so if we know the book of Hebrews

416
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:02,819
in the 13th chapter says, the Lord is my helper.

417
00:30:03,999 --> 00:30:05,119
Aren't you thankful for that?

418
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:06,659
What a blessing.

419
00:30:06,659 --> 00:30:08,359
And the little group that I was in this morning,

420
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:10,999
I didn't offer a whole lot in the Sunday school time

421
00:30:10,999 --> 00:30:12,039
when we sat around the table.

422
00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:14,979
I asked some questions to try to promote some thinking,

423
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:18,039
but I really didn't help them fill out some things.

424
00:30:18,039 --> 00:30:20,559
But one of the words that was on the list,

425
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,919
the table that I was with in Sunday school this morning

426
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:25,399
under the letter H was helper.

427
00:30:25,399 --> 00:30:26,899
He's my helper.

428
00:30:26,899 --> 00:30:29,119
And there are a bunch of little kids at our table.

429
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:31,599
And I was excited to hear them put together

430
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:32,599
and to have that idea.

431
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:34,279
Joseph was there and Holly and I,

432
00:30:34,279 --> 00:30:36,919
and then some younger children there.

433
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:38,359
And what a blessing.

434
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:40,199
Listen, God is my helper.

435
00:30:40,199 --> 00:30:42,819
I don't need to run down to Egypt for help.

436
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:46,079
And let me say this to you this evening,

437
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:47,959
and I'm saying this to myself as well.

438
00:30:47,959 --> 00:30:50,199
And you understand, I said this when I prayed this morning.

439
00:30:50,199 --> 00:30:51,719
Listen, when I preach messages,

440
00:30:51,719 --> 00:30:54,159
God gets to deal with me all week as I prepare,

441
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:56,199
and then he gets to deal with me again when I deliver.

442
00:30:56,199 --> 00:30:58,919
So I get it twice every time you get it once, amen?

443
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:00,439
And that's just the way it works.

444
00:31:00,439 --> 00:31:01,959
And actually, it's probably more than twice

445
00:31:01,959 --> 00:31:04,559
because the preparation time is over and over and over,

446
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:06,079
and so on and so forth.

447
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:07,939
But understand with me this evening

448
00:31:07,939 --> 00:31:10,399
that if this was true of the children of Israel

449
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:12,999
in Isaiah's day, you cannot tell me

450
00:31:12,999 --> 00:31:16,519
that it's still not true of God's people today.

451
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:19,799
That there are times in your life and in my life

452
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:23,839
when we go to the world and the world system

453
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:28,839
for help and for counsel and never even ask for help.

454
00:31:28,999 --> 00:31:32,239
God, we're guilty.

455
00:31:32,239 --> 00:31:34,079
We may not want to admit it.

456
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:36,719
We may not want to acknowledge this evening.

457
00:31:36,719 --> 00:31:38,959
We may not, we might've put that facade on

458
00:31:38,959 --> 00:31:42,159
of nope, I've never done that, pastor.

459
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:44,239
But the reality is that we're all guilty,

460
00:31:44,239 --> 00:31:48,399
just like the children of Israel were guilty in Isaiah's day.

461
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:51,439
There are times in our lives when we do,

462
00:31:51,439 --> 00:31:54,239
we don't even ask the Lord.

463
00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:57,719
We don't even, as it said in there,

464
00:31:57,719 --> 00:31:59,399
in chapter 30 and verse number two,

465
00:31:59,399 --> 00:32:03,039
they have not asked at my mouth.

466
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:06,279
There are times that we've simply not even sought the Lord,

467
00:32:07,979 --> 00:32:11,279
but we've sought the counsel, the help,

468
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:14,039
the direction of the world.

469
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:19,799
And we see here this evening that this prophet Isaiah

470
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:24,119
gives these indictments and we put all of this together

471
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:26,559
and think about the truth back there

472
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:30,639
in Genesis chapter 41, and we'll be in the New Testament

473
00:32:30,639 --> 00:32:32,119
in just a moment and finish the message,

474
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:33,959
but in Genesis chapter 41,

475
00:32:33,959 --> 00:32:35,839
I want to remind you of the counsel once again.

476
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:40,199
Remember the people, because all the land was famished,

477
00:32:40,199 --> 00:32:42,799
the people cried to Pharaoh for bread.

478
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:46,479
And Pharaoh sent out all the Egyptians going to Joseph,

479
00:32:46,479 --> 00:32:47,839
what do you say if you do?

480
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:51,939
Pharaoh wasn't able to offer any help.

481
00:32:51,939 --> 00:32:53,079
He sends them to Joseph.

482
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:55,519
Joseph, as I mentioned a moment ago,

483
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:58,599
is a type, a picture of the Lord Jesus Christ.

484
00:32:58,599 --> 00:33:01,959
And it's very amazing to me that here in Genesis chapter 41

485
00:33:01,959 --> 00:33:04,799
and verse number 55, that here's what the Bible says,

486
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:06,119
go unto Joseph.

487
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:07,979
This is what Pharaoh says to the Egyptians,

488
00:33:07,979 --> 00:33:12,979
go unto Joseph and notice what he saith to you, do.

489
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:17,959
Now, contextually, historically, what's going to happen

490
00:33:17,959 --> 00:33:19,799
is Joseph's gonna say, you want some bread?

491
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:20,639
All right, here's what you do.

492
00:33:20,639 --> 00:33:22,199
You gotta give me this and I'll give you some bread

493
00:33:22,199 --> 00:33:23,039
and so on and so forth.

494
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:24,919
Eventually they get the land and so on and so forth,

495
00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:28,079
and we'll study that over the next several weeks.

496
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:30,399
So what he saith to you do, you want food?

497
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,599
There's the source, you go to him and whatever he says,

498
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:34,119
that's what happens, right?

499
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:37,479
But I want you to think about Joseph being a type

500
00:33:37,479 --> 00:33:39,439
and a picture of the Lord Jesus Christ.

501
00:33:41,799 --> 00:33:44,599
Whatsoever he saith to you, do.

502
00:33:46,279 --> 00:33:51,279
There's a athletic company that coined the phrase,

503
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,519
just do it.

504
00:33:52,519 --> 00:33:54,499
No doubt you've heard that at some point

505
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:56,379
over your life.

506
00:33:57,259 --> 00:34:02,259
When you think about this phrase, what he saith to you do,

507
00:34:02,639 --> 00:34:06,339
it reminds me of the Lord Jesus Christ in John chapter two.

508
00:34:06,339 --> 00:34:09,299
Turn to the book of John, if you will, the gospel of John.

509
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:13,579
Of course, John chapter number one announces with,

510
00:34:13,579 --> 00:34:18,299
I mean, just great authority,

511
00:34:18,299 --> 00:34:20,859
the person of the Lord Jesus Christ

512
00:34:20,859 --> 00:34:23,099
and that he is God in flesh.

513
00:34:23,539 --> 00:34:27,019
I mean, what a powerful, powerful introduction

514
00:34:27,019 --> 00:34:29,819
that we receive in the gospel of John in the first chapter.

515
00:34:29,819 --> 00:34:31,779
And we come to the second chapter,

516
00:34:31,779 --> 00:34:34,219
and we find that this is the first miracle

517
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:35,659
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

518
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:37,979
In verse 11, it says, this beginning of miracles

519
00:34:37,979 --> 00:34:40,239
did Jesus in Cana of Galilee.

520
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:44,179
And we find that in this particular text of scripture,

521
00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:46,499
and I'm not gonna take the time to deal with the entirety

522
00:34:46,499 --> 00:34:48,539
of the miracle and what have you,

523
00:34:48,539 --> 00:34:50,859
but I wanna hone in on verse number five

524
00:34:50,859 --> 00:34:55,099
and look at that phrase that Mary, the mother of Jesus says

525
00:34:55,099 --> 00:34:59,299
to those servants that are gathered together

526
00:34:59,299 --> 00:35:01,819
to provide some assistance, if you will.

527
00:35:01,819 --> 00:35:05,059
And we find that it's very similar

528
00:35:05,059 --> 00:35:08,659
to what Pharaoh says to the people of Egypt.

529
00:35:08,659 --> 00:35:12,619
And here's what the mother of Jesus, Mary says,

530
00:35:12,619 --> 00:35:15,139
notice in verse number five,

531
00:35:15,139 --> 00:35:17,339
his mother saith unto the servants,

532
00:35:18,299 --> 00:35:23,299
whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.

533
00:35:24,979 --> 00:35:27,739
Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.

534
00:35:28,819 --> 00:35:30,259
You know, the reality is sometimes

535
00:35:30,259 --> 00:35:32,779
we just have a hard time with that

536
00:35:32,779 --> 00:35:34,539
because we wanna do things our way.

537
00:35:35,859 --> 00:35:40,279
We wanna do things the way we wanna do things.

538
00:35:40,279 --> 00:35:41,819
We've heard another way, we've heard,

539
00:35:41,819 --> 00:35:43,779
maybe we've gotten counsel from some other source

540
00:35:43,779 --> 00:35:46,059
and what have you, but we find that even,

541
00:35:46,059 --> 00:35:48,179
listen, I sat in my office 11 years ago,

542
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:49,539
no one here would even know the person

543
00:35:49,539 --> 00:35:50,579
that I was speaking to.

544
00:35:50,579 --> 00:35:52,499
And it was a mess of a situation,

545
00:35:52,499 --> 00:35:54,099
all sorts of crazy stuff, stuff

546
00:35:54,099 --> 00:35:56,979
I never even had thought happened.

547
00:35:56,979 --> 00:35:58,859
I'll be honest with you.

548
00:35:58,859 --> 00:35:59,699
I thought, what in the world?

549
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:01,859
I'm sitting in my office, I'm like, is this real?

550
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:02,739
Like, seriously?

551
00:36:02,739 --> 00:36:05,059
I didn't even know stuff like this happened.

552
00:36:05,059 --> 00:36:06,379
It was absolutely amazing.

553
00:36:08,219 --> 00:36:10,139
And I said, here's the, and they were trying to tell me

554
00:36:10,139 --> 00:36:11,899
how right they were with God and all this stuff.

555
00:36:11,899 --> 00:36:12,739
It was crazy.

556
00:36:13,779 --> 00:36:15,539
And I said, well, let me just ask you this.

557
00:36:15,939 --> 00:36:17,899
Are you doing everything God's telling you to do?

558
00:36:17,899 --> 00:36:19,499
Oh, yeah.

559
00:36:19,499 --> 00:36:22,099
I said, no, like whatsoever he sayeth, you do it.

560
00:36:22,099 --> 00:36:24,459
Oh, yeah, all of it.

561
00:36:24,459 --> 00:36:27,459
The guy was just lying straight out of his teeth, right?

562
00:36:27,459 --> 00:36:30,059
But the reality is that for us as God's people,

563
00:36:31,259 --> 00:36:35,419
we go to God for counsel and whatsoever he sayeth, we do it.

564
00:36:35,419 --> 00:36:36,539
You say, but it doesn't make sense.

565
00:36:36,539 --> 00:36:39,539
No, no, God's way doesn't always make sense.

566
00:36:39,539 --> 00:36:43,779
And let me say this, God's way doesn't have to make sense.

567
00:36:43,779 --> 00:36:44,619
Amen?

568
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:47,499
Sometimes, and listen, those of us that are more logical

569
00:36:47,499 --> 00:36:51,619
and what have you and have that analytical type of a mind,

570
00:36:51,619 --> 00:36:53,699
sometimes we struggle with that, why?

571
00:36:53,699 --> 00:36:55,979
Because we want things to make sense.

572
00:36:56,819 --> 00:36:59,699
And God's ways are not our ways.

573
00:36:59,699 --> 00:37:00,819
Amen?

574
00:37:00,819 --> 00:37:04,419
And God says, do it.

575
00:37:04,419 --> 00:37:07,579
And this evening, when we think about the time of crisis,

576
00:37:07,579 --> 00:37:11,859
the time of great difficulty, the time of great distress,

577
00:37:11,859 --> 00:37:13,759
to whom do we go?

578
00:37:13,759 --> 00:37:15,039
To whom do we cry?

579
00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:18,519
See, we see what happened in Genesis 41

580
00:37:19,759 --> 00:37:22,519
when those seven years of dearth began.

581
00:37:22,519 --> 00:37:24,319
It was immediate and severe.

582
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:28,959
We find that the people, they cried out,

583
00:37:28,959 --> 00:37:31,599
and I understand why they cried out.

584
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:32,899
They cried out to Pharaoh.

585
00:37:33,799 --> 00:37:35,599
And Pharaoh and Ensign said, I can't help you.

586
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:37,899
Go to Joseph, and whatsoever he sayeth, do it.

587
00:37:39,639 --> 00:37:41,039
What he sayeth to you, do.

588
00:37:42,039 --> 00:37:44,639
If we look at these types this evening,

589
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:49,639
for us in 2023, almost 2024 now,

590
00:37:49,639 --> 00:37:51,879
we have times of crisis and difficulty.

591
00:37:51,879 --> 00:37:52,819
To whom do we flee?

592
00:37:52,819 --> 00:37:53,959
To whom do we go?

593
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:56,639
Don't go to Egypt.

594
00:37:56,639 --> 00:37:57,899
Don't go to the world.

595
00:37:58,759 --> 00:38:01,159
The world doesn't have anything to offer you.

596
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:04,479
Go to God.

597
00:38:04,479 --> 00:38:06,519
Seek God.

598
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:09,799
And whatever God says, do it.

599
00:38:10,759 --> 00:38:12,239
Do it.

600
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:14,159
You know that we do not have to pray

601
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:17,879
about what God has revealed for us to do in his word.

602
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:18,959
You know what I mean by that?

603
00:38:18,959 --> 00:38:20,599
When God tells us to do something,

604
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:23,239
we don't say, well, you know, I'm gonna pray about that.

605
00:38:23,239 --> 00:38:25,159
When God says that we're to rejoice in everything,

606
00:38:25,159 --> 00:38:26,859
give thanks for this will of God and Christ Jesus

607
00:38:26,859 --> 00:38:28,959
concerning you, I'm gonna pray about that.

608
00:38:28,959 --> 00:38:31,059
No, no, no, just do it.

609
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:31,979
Amen?

610
00:38:31,979 --> 00:38:33,399
You don't have to pray about whether you're gonna,

611
00:38:33,399 --> 00:38:34,760
you don't have to pray about whether you're gonna give.

612
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,599
You don't have to pray whether you're gonna go to church.

613
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:37,559
You don't have to pray.

614
00:38:37,559 --> 00:38:39,359
We're commanded to do those things.

615
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:41,200
We don't pray about the commands.

616
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,359
Does that make sense?

617
00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:43,760
We just do them.

618
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,919
We just obey.

619
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,320
And God will bless.

620
00:38:48,399 --> 00:38:50,519
See, God's way is not always our way.

621
00:38:50,519 --> 00:38:51,519
But you know what God wants us to do?

622
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:52,940
He wants us to trust him.

623
00:38:54,359 --> 00:38:55,679
He is the almighty.

624
00:38:57,159 --> 00:38:59,359
He is the one that spoke everything into existence.

625
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:01,899
He is the one that saved your soul.

626
00:39:01,899 --> 00:39:03,779
You understand that there's nothing you can do tonight

627
00:39:03,779 --> 00:39:06,039
to get to heaven on your own.

628
00:39:06,039 --> 00:39:07,440
We all agree on that.

629
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,639
There's nothing we can do to get to heaven on our own.

630
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:12,359
We need Jesus.

631
00:39:12,359 --> 00:39:13,200
Would you agree?

632
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:18,159
But you know what happens sometimes for living tomorrow?

633
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:19,579
We think, I got this.

634
00:39:20,799 --> 00:39:21,899
I can handle tomorrow.

635
00:39:21,899 --> 00:39:24,320
I mean, I can't handle eternity,

636
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,639
but I can handle tomorrow.

637
00:39:25,639 --> 00:39:27,599
I can handle this week.

638
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:30,519
And we live independently of God.

639
00:39:31,399 --> 00:39:34,119
And that just makes zero sense.

640
00:39:34,119 --> 00:39:37,679
Listen, if you can trust him with your eternal destiny,

641
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:40,039
you can trust him with your tomorrow.

642
00:39:40,039 --> 00:39:41,359
Amen?

643
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:43,559
If you can trust him with your eternal destiny,

644
00:39:43,559 --> 00:39:47,239
you can trust him with tomorrow.

645
00:39:47,239 --> 00:39:49,839
Whatsoever he sayeth unto you, do it.

646
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:51,159
To whom do we cry?

647
00:39:51,159 --> 00:39:53,880
To whom do we go in times of crisis?

648
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,839
We all face them.

649
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:56,919
We all have times of great difficulty.

650
00:39:56,919 --> 00:40:00,119
And I hope tonight that we run to the cross.

651
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:04,119
that we run to the Lord Jesus Christ and we say,

652
00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:08,119
Lord, help me. You ever read Psalm 12?

653
00:40:08,119 --> 00:40:12,119
Help, Lord. That's how it begins. You know, sometimes that's all we can pray.

654
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:16,119
Help, Lord. I just need help and I know that you're the helper

655
00:40:16,119 --> 00:40:20,119
and you said that you would give us help. Aren't you so thankful

656
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:24,119
that we have a wonderful Savior and He offers to give us

657
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:28,119
the counsel, the direction that we need. He's our

658
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:32,119
shepherd and as our shepherd, He takes good care

659
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:36,119
of His sheep. Let's pray this evening. Father, we love You.

660
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:40,119
We thank You for loving us. We thank You for Your Word, the truth contained therein.

661
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:44,119
I pray that even as we look at this historical event,

662
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:48,119
this time in Egypt

663
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:52,119
when Joseph is there and this famine begins

664
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:56,119
and the land is famished,

665
00:40:56,119 --> 00:41:00,119
Lord, I pray that tonight as we can understand

666
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:04,119
the historical context of this event that we also

667
00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:08,119
would be able to make application in our lives. Lord,

668
00:41:08,119 --> 00:41:12,119
I pray that You'd help us tonight

669
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:16,119
to run to You in times of difficulty, of great

670
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:20,119
need, of great distress, times of crisis.

671
00:41:20,119 --> 00:41:24,119
Help us, Lord, not to run to the world, the world

672
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:28,119
system. Help us, Lord, to trust You,

673
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:32,119
to obey You. I pray that You'd help us, Lord,

674
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:36,119
to be doers of the Word and not hearers only. Help us to have a heart

675
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:40,119
of surrender and submission to You and to Your

676
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:44,119
Word. I pray that in these few moments of invitation that You'd have Your will and way

677
00:41:44,119 --> 00:41:48,119
that You would move and work in hearts and lives as only You can. We'll thank You for

678
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:50,119
what You'll do. For it's in Christ's name we pray.
