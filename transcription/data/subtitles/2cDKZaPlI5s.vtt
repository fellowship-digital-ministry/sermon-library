00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
That was just free tonight, amen, just an addendum to the song.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Genesis chapter 41, we're going to finish this chapter tonight.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And someone misunderstood me this morning and thought I was finishing the life of Joseph tonight.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
But just chapter 41, just this section of the life of Joseph.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And we got lots of chapters left here through the end of the book of Genesis chapter 50.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
But we look at Genesis chapter 41, we spent a few weeks in this particular chapter.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
It is a lengthy chapter, it's 57 verses, and a lot of things happen.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I mean, it is a chapter that is filled with information.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And if you think about the life of Joseph and where we've been the last couple of weeks as we've studied through Genesis 41,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
we find that those first seven years after Joseph is promoted,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
we'll give him the title this evening as Prime Minister over Egypt, if we could use that terminology tonight.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And I understand the Bible doesn't say that, it says that he's second in charge, second in command.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
But if we could use that terminology, he's set in that place.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Pharaoh had made him ruler over all the land of Egypt.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And as Joseph is promoted to that place, that position of Prime Minister,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
we find that those first seven years after he reaches that place, that position,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
are described for us in verse 29 of Genesis 41 as being great plenty.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Notice what the Bible says.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Behold, there come seven years, not just seven years of plenty,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
but the Bible says seven years of great plenty.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.000
And throughout all the land of Egypt, I believe that for those seven years of great plenty,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
they reaped a harvest that was unlike anything they had ever experienced in their lives.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I believe that as they were going through and reaping during those seven years,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
there were probably comments that would be made of,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
man, we've never had a harvest like this before, and so on and so forth.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And there's seven years of great plenty.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.000
We find that during those seven years, they are filled with a number of changes in the life of Joseph.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Remember, when we started Genesis 41, he's in prison.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
He interprets the dream, he's placed in that position, and the seven years begin.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
And we spoke about those seven years of great plenty last week.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
And so we see that Joseph, just in Genesis 41, he has a new position.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I would say that he has a new home, a palace, a new place to live.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
He is no longer there in the prison house.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
He has a new wife, and he has two new sons.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
And we spoke about those sons last week, and as we looked at the names of those sons,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
and we talked about being fruitful in the land of affliction.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And even in the midst of affliction, we can have that fruitfulness that Joseph describes,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000
and it requires that we forget some things, and then we see how God has blessed.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
In addition to all of this, all of these changes in Genesis 41,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Joseph had the great responsibility to prepare the nation for those seven years of famine

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000
that would be, according to verse number 30 and 31, very grievous and would consume the land.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Notice we read in verse 29 that those seven years, they would be of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
But then notice in verse 30 of Genesis 41, it says,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
And there shall arise after them seven years of famine, and all the plenty,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
notice what it says, shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
And the famine shall, notice it says, consume the land.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
The plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of the famine following,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
for it shall be very grievous.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.000
And of course, God had given Joseph the wisdom that was necessary in order to give counsel to Pharaoh

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
with regard to what to do because of this dream that had been interpreted.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
And as we kind of skip into our passage this evening,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
and we begin to think about the plan that God had given Joseph,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000
we would see that as God gave Joseph that great wisdom, that his plan was effective.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
We are told that Joseph went throughout all the land.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:16.000
In verse number 49, it tells us that he laid up that food.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
In fact, at the end of verse number 45, it says that Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000
At the end of verse number 46, it says that he, Joseph, went out from the presence of Pharaoh

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
and went throughout all the land of Egypt.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
And it was during those seven plenteous years,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
those years that were described in verse number 29 as being great plenty,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
that Joseph went out and he gathered up, according to verse number 48,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
And he laid up the food in the cities, the food of the field, which was round about every city,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
laid he up in the same.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And verse 49 tells us, and Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea very much

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
until he left numbering, for it was without number.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.000
In these great days of plenty, Joseph was faithful to do what God had revealed to him.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
He was faithful to complete the task that he had been entrusted with by Pharaoh

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
on storing up during those seven years.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Remember, God had given Joseph the wisdom to be able to provide that counsel

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
as to what should take place during those seven years of great plenty.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
According to verse number 34, they were to take up 20% of that which was produced

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.000
during those years of great plenty and store it so that they would have food during the famine.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
We find that this plan was effective. Why was it effective?

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Well, because it was God's plan and God had revealed it to Joseph.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
And the effectiveness of the plan is seen throughout the portion of Scripture.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
But we see that those days of great plenty ended.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
And as we enter into our text of Scripture this evening, in verse number 53,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
notice what the Bible says, and we'll look at verse 53 down through the end of the chapter.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:03.000
The Bible says, and the seven years of plenteousness that was in the land of Egypt were ended.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
They were ended.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:12.000
And it says in verse number 54, and the seven years of dearth began to come.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:20.000
According as Joseph had said, the dearth was in all lands, but in all the lands of Egypt there was bread.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
When all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:30.000
and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph, what he saith to you, do.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
And the famine was over all the face of the earth, and Joseph opened all the storehouses

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
and sold unto the Egyptians, and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
and all countries came unto Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
because the famine was so sore in all lands.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:52.000
I've titled the message from verse number 54 this evening, the seven years of dearth began.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
The seven years of dearth began.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
We notice as we conclude the chapter, I just read the verses,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
but God reveals to us really in verse 56 and verse number 57,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
how this circumstance, this great famine that was upon the land,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
that was described as being very grievous, that would consume the land,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000
that God reveals to us how this would be the catalyst, if you will,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000
that would eventually bring Jacob and his family into the land of Egypt.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Because the Bible says that all countries, verse 57, came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
because the famine was so sore, notice, in all lands.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
Now, it's kind of interesting, if you look at the end of verse number 57,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
before we get into the message this evening, notice that little word, so.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
We're familiar with that when we read John 3, 16,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
for God so loved the world.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
And you think about the impact when God is explaining to us

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
the terribleness, if you will, of this famine.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
This is because the famine was so sore in all lands.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
As you enter into the 42nd chapter, you find that the Bible tells us

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
that Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
And again, God would use this circumstance as really a catalyst

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
that would eventually bring Jacob and his family into the land of Egypt.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
And it's a time in which Joseph eventually would reveal his person,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
his identity to his brothers, and he would say this,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:21.000
God sent me before you for what purpose? To preserve life.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000
And God was using Joseph in this land of affliction, as he refers to it in verse number 52,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
but God was using him and God had a purpose.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
And I want you to think about these seven years of famine,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
and as we've looked at the title, the seven years of dearth began.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Consider just a couple of things with me this evening.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Number one, I want you to consider with me the cry of the people.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000
The cry of the people.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
As we notice in verse number 55 of our text of Scripture,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
the Bible gives us a description. It's a dim description.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
The Bible had told us, and we spent some time looking

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000
and reminding ourselves of what we've studied throughout this 41st chapter already,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
but we find that the Bible told us in verse number 30

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000
that those years of famine would rise, and then notice what it says in verse number 30,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000
and all the plenty, notice what it says, shall be forgotten.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Now think about that, because during those seven years of great plenty,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
as it's described in verse 29, I believe again that many were saying,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
we've never had a harvest like this, but then when that great famine comes,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.000
those years of great plenty are forgotten.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
And why are they forgotten? Well, because it's severe, it's grievous,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
it's going to consume the land.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000
It's amazing what people will do when they have no food.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
It's amazing what people will do when there's no food.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
And we find that as we look at the cry of the people, notice what God tells us in verse number 55,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.000
and when all the land of Egypt, what does it say, was famished, was famished.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Sometimes our children will say, I'm starving.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
You ever hear your kids say that?

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Maybe some of you wives, you've heard your husband say, I'm starving.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000
And you're like, you could...

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.760
live for days without eating, right? Like, you are not starving, you're okay. I'm going to die,

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:11.840
I'm so hungry. No, we've never probably truly experienced that. But the reality is that God

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:19.680
tells us here that the land, and it says all the land of Egypt, was famished. And it reveals to us

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:24.879
as we think about that statement in verse number 55, as we enter into this portion of scripture,

00:10:24.879 --> 00:10:33.599
it reveals to us that this famine was so severe that it had an immediate impact. I mean, when

00:10:33.599 --> 00:10:40.639
those, can you imagine, and God is in this, right? See, our God is the creator. This idea of mother

00:10:40.639 --> 00:10:45.119
nature, no, no, God's in control of everything. God's the one that sends the rain, God's the one

00:10:45.119 --> 00:10:50.959
that withholds the rain. In fact, for the children of Israel, they were told that God would send the

00:10:50.959 --> 00:10:58.080
rain as a blessing, and that God would withhold the rain as judgment. Amen? And often, as you look

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:04.959
throughout the scriptures, you find that times, periods of drought and famine, were the direct

00:11:04.959 --> 00:11:12.480
result of God's divine judgment upon his people. And so God brings this famine. He had revealed it,

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:17.199
of course, in his grace and his mercy, through this dream that Pharaoh has, and Joseph is able

00:11:17.199 --> 00:11:23.599
to interpret and give the counsel, but this particular famine had an immediate and severe

00:11:23.599 --> 00:11:30.400
impact. The land, it says all the land of Egypt was famished, and then notice the Bible says that

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:39.519
the people, the people of Egypt, they cried to Pharaoh for bread. Over the next several weeks,

00:11:39.519 --> 00:11:44.080
as we study throughout the next several portions of scripture in the book of Genesis, we'll see

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:50.000
to what extent people will go when they're hungry, what they will be willing to sell, and what they

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.680
will be willing to do, and in order to be able to get some food. It's no doubt in my mind, it's going

00:11:55.680 --> 00:12:01.199
to be quite easy when things happen during the tribulation time, and they say, well, you're going

00:12:01.199 --> 00:12:05.199
to need to have this mark right here if you want to have some food, if you want to be able to buy,

00:12:05.199 --> 00:12:08.559
sell, or trade. It's going to be very, people are going to line up and say, where do you want to put

00:12:08.559 --> 00:12:13.039
it? Which hand? Where out of my forehead? I mean, I'll take it, I'll have it in all three places. I

00:12:13.039 --> 00:12:18.559
mean, people will really be that way. They'll be ready to do it, and we find here this evening, as

00:12:18.559 --> 00:12:22.800
we continue, and again, over the next several weeks, we continue to look throughout the portions of

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:29.919
scripture here in the book of Genesis to see the depth of how this famine impacted the people,

00:12:29.919 --> 00:12:35.759
but the people cried to Pharaoh for bread. I want you to think about this just for a moment. As we

00:12:35.759 --> 00:12:40.320
think about the cry of the people, you know, in times of crisis, I believe that this here was a

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:44.800
time of crisis for the Egyptians. It was a time of crisis not only for the Egyptians, but we find

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:51.199
that for all of the world, because it affected not just Egypt, but all countries were impacted

00:12:51.199 --> 00:12:56.800
because of this famine. In fact, in verse 56, it says, and the famine was over all the face of the earth.

00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:02.720
And we find that as this famine would impact, it was a time of great crisis, and you find that in a

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:10.559
time of crisis that people need direction. People need direction in time of crisis. People become

00:13:10.559 --> 00:13:21.839
desperate in time of crisis. We think about time of crisis, and we see it here in this portion of

00:13:21.839 --> 00:13:27.520
scripture, and we see the response of the people, and I wonder tonight, as we understand that the

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:33.119
people cry, and they cry to Pharaoh for bread, I wonder this evening in time of great distress,

00:13:33.119 --> 00:13:38.559
in time of crisis, in time of great difficulty, to whom do we look? To whom do we cry?

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:47.039
Because we find that here, the Bible tells us that these folks, that they cried, the people cried

00:13:47.039 --> 00:13:54.399
to Pharaoh for bread. They were desperate. They were in need. They were famished. They were hungry.

00:13:55.360 --> 00:14:02.000
Times of great desperation led them to a place where they were crying out to Pharaoh. As we look

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.720
at the text of scripture, we not only see the cry of the people, but we see, number two, the counsel

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:10.800
of Pharaoh. The counsel of Pharaoh. I want you to notice, and we're going to spend the remainder of

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:15.039
our time here on looking at the response of Pharaoh and what takes place. The Bible says,

00:14:15.039 --> 00:14:20.160
and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, notice what he says, notice the counsel that Pharaoh gives,

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:29.200
go unto Joseph, what he saith to you, do. Now I want you to think about Pharaoh. He is the,

00:14:29.839 --> 00:14:37.040
he's the man in charge. Joseph is second in command. Pharaoh is the man in charge, and the

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:43.279
people cry unto Pharaoh and say, give us bread. They're desperate. They're pleading. They're

00:14:43.279 --> 00:14:50.239
crying for some help, and Pharaoh says, go to Joseph. And whatever Joseph says, what he saith to

00:14:50.239 --> 00:14:56.079
you, do. Now we have to back up, and I know this is review, but remember that back in verse number

00:14:56.079 --> 00:15:02.880
33, after Joseph interpreted the dream, Joseph begins to give this action plan, if you will,

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:07.600
to Pharaoh. And here's what he says, now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man, discreet and wise,

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:12.399
and send him over the land of Egypt. Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the

00:15:12.399 --> 00:15:16.160
land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years. We're not

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:22.480
going to read all of it, but we find that Joseph is providing this counsel and instruction, and

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:29.839
Pharaoh concludes in verse number 38, he says to his servants, can we find such a one as this is,

00:15:30.559 --> 00:15:39.200
a man in whom the Spirit of God is. And we find that Joseph is given this place of,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:47.359
of power, of position. We mentioned last week how that Joseph was given a new name, and he was given

00:15:47.359 --> 00:15:53.839
that new name, and we mentioned that, and that Pharaoh gave him that name, and the name is

00:15:53.839 --> 00:15:58.320
recorded for us. Notice in verse number 42, and Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:04.000
it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.399
and he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had. And they cried before him, bow the

00:16:08.399 --> 00:16:14.000
knee, and he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt. And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.959
without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt. And Pharaoh called

00:16:18.959 --> 00:16:24.480
Joseph's name Zaphnath-Paneah, and he gave him to wife Asenath. But we mentioned last week in

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:29.119
verse number 45, as you see that name, and again there's some level of debate with regard to what

00:16:29.119 --> 00:16:36.239
that name really means, and there's some debate and discussion amongst theologians and Jewish

00:16:36.239 --> 00:16:43.200
rabbis with regard to that, but really it seems that the most likely interpretation of what that

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:51.519
name means is God speaks and he lives. God speaks and he lives, or and he giveth life. And you think

00:16:51.519 --> 00:16:57.040
about what Pharaoh was recognizing in giving that name to Joseph. He could have named him whatever

00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:04.239
he wanted to name him. And because of what had transpired, we find that Pharaoh gives that name,

00:17:04.239 --> 00:17:12.480
and Joseph is now in this position, and when the people come and they cry there to Pharaoh for help,

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:19.279
and they cry because they want bread, this time of great difficulty, this time of when the land

00:17:19.279 --> 00:17:28.480
is famished, and they cry for bread, and Pharaoh says, go unto Joseph. What he saith to you, do.

00:17:28.959 --> 00:17:34.160
Now this evening as we look at this portion of Scripture, and I don't always go this route,

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:40.559
but you find in the Bible there's a lot of types, typologies. And I believe that it's important

00:17:40.559 --> 00:17:45.760
this evening that we look at this and see the typology that the Lord is giving us. We see

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:50.079
the interpretation, when we talk about hermeneutics and interpreting Scripture,

00:17:50.079 --> 00:17:55.679
we see that at face value this is an event that happened in the land of Egypt. This famine was

00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:02.640
real, the people were famished, the people had no bread, and they cry out for help, and Pharaoh says,

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:09.600
go to Joseph. And that's truly what happens, but there's typologies in the Bible. And I believe

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:12.959
this evening as we look at this portion of Scripture, and I want you to consider this with

00:18:12.959 --> 00:18:17.920
me, we'll make some application in our own lives, but I want you to know and consider with me that

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:25.920
Egypt and Pharaoh are really types, and they represent the world and its system. You understand

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:32.400
that the world has a system. The Bible says that we're to be not conformed to this world,

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:36.000
but to be transformed by the renewing of our mind, that we may prove what is that good and

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:42.000
acceptable and perfect will of God in Romans chapter number 12. And we find that Egypt and

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:48.000
Pharaoh, as you study through the Old Testament, as you look into the typologies and you read into

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:54.159
even the New Testament, how that it's a picture, a type of the world and the world system. The world

00:18:54.159 --> 00:18:58.320
still is in existence. The Bible tells us this, love not the world, neither the things that are

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:03.280
in the world, right? And the world fadeth away, it passeth away. We understand that in 1 John chapter

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:09.200
number 2. And so we find this evening that Egypt and Pharaoh, and we find that Pharaoh is the one

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:13.919
that's addressed. And so these people that are famished, these people that are in great distress,

00:19:13.919 --> 00:19:18.239
this time of great crisis when people are desperate and they're looking for direction,

00:19:18.239 --> 00:19:21.679
they're looking for leadership, where do they go? Well, they go to Pharaoh. It makes sense.

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:30.400
You know what Pharaoh says? I can't help you. In essence, what Pharaoh says is, I can't help you.

00:19:31.359 --> 00:19:39.919
Go to Joseph. There was nothing that he could do. Joseph is a type of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:46.559
Now understand this evening, he's not the Lord Jesus Christ. He's simply a type of the Lord

00:19:46.559 --> 00:19:52.080
Jesus Christ. And as we study, we have the opportunity through these types and typologies

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:56.159
in the Old Testament, you have opportunity to see these glimpses and to see these truths.

00:19:56.159 --> 00:19:59.919
And we find this evening that Joseph is a type of the Lord.

00:19:59.919 --> 00:20:04.919
And so we find this evening that if Egypt and Pharaoh represent the world and its system,

00:20:04.919 --> 00:20:08.919
and Joseph represents or is a type of the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:20:08.919 --> 00:20:13.919
and we begin to make application from this portion of Scripture tonight in our lives,

00:20:13.919 --> 00:20:17.919
understand tonight that you're going to face times of crisis.

00:20:17.919 --> 00:20:22.919
You're gonna face times of great difficulty, of distress, of being overwhelmed,

00:20:22.919 --> 00:20:27.919
and needing direction, and desiring for someone to provide for something

00:20:27.919 --> 00:20:29.919
that you have need of.

00:20:29.919 --> 00:20:33.919
And the question, as we mentioned in that first point, the cry of the people,

00:20:33.919 --> 00:20:36.919
to whom do we look? To whom do we go?

00:20:36.919 --> 00:20:38.919
Notice what happens if you think about God's people.

00:20:38.919 --> 00:20:42.919
Turn to the book of Isaiah, if you will, and go to Isaiah chapter number 30.

00:20:42.919 --> 00:20:45.919
We're gonna look at a couple of passages here in the book of Isaiah,

00:20:45.919 --> 00:20:49.919
and then we're gonna go to the New Testament and make some final application this evening.

00:20:49.919 --> 00:20:53.919
But I want you to consider, as we look at this historical event,

00:20:53.919 --> 00:20:58.919
this recorded event that took place in the life of Joseph,

00:20:58.919 --> 00:21:03.919
but how it applies for us tonight in our own lives.

00:21:03.919 --> 00:21:09.919
In Isaiah chapter number 30,

00:21:09.919 --> 00:21:15.919
the Bible says this in verse number 1, Isaiah 30 and verse number 1,

00:21:15.919 --> 00:21:20.919
Woe to the rebellious children, saith the Lord,

00:21:20.919 --> 00:21:27.919
that take counsel, but then notice these words, but not of me.

00:21:27.919 --> 00:21:31.919
But take counsel, but not of me.

00:21:31.919 --> 00:21:36.919
And that cover with a covering, but not of my spirit,

00:21:36.919 --> 00:21:40.919
that they may add sin to sin.

00:21:40.919 --> 00:21:44.919
Notice verse number 2, that walk to go down into where?

00:21:44.919 --> 00:21:47.919
Egypt. It's a picture of what? It's a type of what?

00:21:47.919 --> 00:21:50.919
The world and the world system.

00:21:50.919 --> 00:21:57.919
And then notice this last phrase, and have not asked at my mouth.

00:21:57.919 --> 00:22:02.919
Can you imagine? It's just to strengthen themselves in the strength of who?

00:22:02.919 --> 00:22:04.919
Pharaoh.

00:22:04.919 --> 00:22:08.919
And to trust in the shadow of Egypt.

00:22:08.919 --> 00:22:13.919
So who is Isaiah prophesying to? He's prophesying to God's people.

00:22:13.919 --> 00:22:17.919
To the children of Israel. He's prophesying to them.

00:22:17.919 --> 00:22:21.919
And he's saying, woe to the rebellious children.

00:22:21.919 --> 00:22:25.919
Why is this woe being given? And understand that it says, saith the Lord.

00:22:25.919 --> 00:22:30.919
Isaiah is the human prophet, but he's delivering the message that God has given.

00:22:30.919 --> 00:22:34.919
And he says that you're taking counsel, but not of me.

00:22:34.919 --> 00:22:38.919
And then he provides further insight as to what they were really doing

00:22:38.919 --> 00:22:41.919
and how they were operating, so that they couldn't say,

00:22:41.919 --> 00:22:44.919
what are you talking about? We're not taking counsel. No, here's what you're doing.

00:22:44.919 --> 00:22:48.919
You're running down to Egypt.

00:22:48.919 --> 00:22:50.919
To the world.

00:22:50.919 --> 00:22:55.919
And then notice what he says, and this is so powerful in my mind,

00:22:55.919 --> 00:22:58.919
and I hope that we grasp the concept this evening.

00:22:58.919 --> 00:23:03.919
It says this, and have not asked at my mouth.

00:23:03.919 --> 00:23:07.919
I said this this morning as I was preaching on the subject of prayer.

00:23:07.919 --> 00:23:12.919
I said it's a wonderful truth to know that God hears and answers prayer.

00:23:12.919 --> 00:23:17.919
But to know that he hears and answers prayer and not pray,

00:23:17.919 --> 00:23:20.919
just doesn't make sense.

00:23:20.919 --> 00:23:23.919
It's of no help. Would you agree?

00:23:23.919 --> 00:23:26.919
God hears and answers prayer, but I don't pray.

00:23:26.919 --> 00:23:29.919
Well, that doesn't even make sense.

00:23:29.919 --> 00:23:32.919
And here the Bible says that the people of God,

00:23:32.919 --> 00:23:35.919
the children, the rebellious children as they're described here,

00:23:35.919 --> 00:23:39.919
that they have not asked at my mouth.

00:23:39.919 --> 00:23:42.919
What if they just would have asked for counsel?

00:23:42.919 --> 00:23:45.919
What if they just would have sought the face of God?

00:23:45.919 --> 00:23:49.919
What if they would have desired wisdom and counsel

00:23:49.919 --> 00:23:52.919
from God instead of from the world?

00:23:52.919 --> 00:23:55.919
Listen, you understand this evening, the world's not going to give you counsel

00:23:55.919 --> 00:23:57.919
that's going to align with this book.

00:23:57.919 --> 00:24:00.919
The world is not going to provide you with counsel

00:24:00.919 --> 00:24:04.919
that is going to align with what thus saith the Lord.

00:24:04.919 --> 00:24:07.919
In fact, if you go to the world for counsel,

00:24:07.919 --> 00:24:10.919
many times their counsel is going to be contrary

00:24:10.919 --> 00:24:13.919
to what you find in God's Word.

00:24:13.919 --> 00:24:16.919
Why? For the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God.

00:24:16.919 --> 00:24:19.919
For there are foolishness unto him, neither can he know them.

00:24:19.919 --> 00:24:22.919
Why? Because they are spiritually discerned, 1 Corinthians 2.

00:24:22.919 --> 00:24:27.919
And we find here that God is sent in this indictment against his people

00:24:27.919 --> 00:24:31.919
because they're taking counsel but not from God.

00:24:31.919 --> 00:24:35.919
They're running down to Egypt, or walking to go down into Egypt,

00:24:35.919 --> 00:24:38.919
but have not asked of My mouth.

00:24:38.919 --> 00:24:41.919
God says ask. And what?

00:24:41.919 --> 00:24:44.919
Ye shall receive.

00:24:44.919 --> 00:24:46.919
Is that not a promise?

00:24:46.919 --> 00:24:49.919
He says ye have not

00:24:49.919 --> 00:24:52.919
because ye ask not.

00:24:52.919 --> 00:24:55.919
Right? Is that what He says? Is that Bible?

00:24:55.919 --> 00:24:58.919
And we find here this evening that He says that you've not asked of My mouth

00:24:58.919 --> 00:25:01.919
to strengthen themselves. Notice where it says,

00:25:01.919 --> 00:25:04.919
in the strength of Pharaoh. Now this is amazing to me

00:25:04.919 --> 00:25:07.919
because I think about the children of Israel.

00:25:07.919 --> 00:25:10.919
We have the Bible and we can read back

00:25:10.919 --> 00:25:13.919
and we can understand all that happened with the Exodus

00:25:13.919 --> 00:25:16.919
and so on and so forth. And I understand the Exodus is

00:25:16.919 --> 00:25:19.919
after what we've read in Genesis 41 this evening

00:25:19.919 --> 00:25:22.919
but Isaiah is after the Exodus.

00:25:22.919 --> 00:25:25.919
So I think it's fair that we could say that the children of Israel

00:25:25.919 --> 00:25:29.919
were aware of what happened during the Exodus.

00:25:29.919 --> 00:25:33.919
The children of God during the time of Isaiah's prophecy

00:25:33.919 --> 00:25:36.919
were aware of the Exodus. They were aware of the plagues.

00:25:36.919 --> 00:25:40.919
They could read the Psalms. They could read the book of Exodus.

00:25:40.919 --> 00:25:43.919
They could be aware of what God did.

00:25:43.919 --> 00:25:47.919
And let me ask you this. Who had more power?

00:25:47.919 --> 00:25:50.919
God or Pharaoh?

00:25:50.919 --> 00:25:53.919
Was it abundantly clear?

00:25:53.919 --> 00:25:59.919
So clear that even the magicians of Egypt

00:25:59.919 --> 00:26:04.919
said this is the finger of God.

00:26:04.919 --> 00:26:07.919
They asked Pharaoh, do you not see

00:26:07.919 --> 00:26:10.919
that the land is devastated? I mean how long

00:26:10.919 --> 00:26:14.919
are you going to allow these people to be a snare unto us?

00:26:14.919 --> 00:26:17.919
God made it abundantly clear and abundantly obvious

00:26:17.919 --> 00:26:20.919
that He is the one that has all power.

00:26:20.919 --> 00:26:24.919
That He has more power than Pharaoh.

00:26:24.919 --> 00:26:27.919
Would you agree? But look at verse number 2.

00:26:27.919 --> 00:26:30.919
These people that would have known that, it says

00:26:30.919 --> 00:26:37.919
to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh.

00:26:37.919 --> 00:26:40.919
Why do we want Pharaoh's strength?

00:26:40.919 --> 00:26:43.919
If Pharaoh's strength is inferior

00:26:43.919 --> 00:26:46.919
to God's strength,

00:26:46.919 --> 00:26:48.919
why do we want Pharaoh's strength?

00:26:48.919 --> 00:26:52.919
Do you understand? But this is what they're doing.

00:26:52.919 --> 00:26:54.919
It says at the end of verse number 2,

00:26:54.919 --> 00:27:00.919
and to trust in the shadow of Egypt.

00:27:00.919 --> 00:27:03.919
The world.

00:27:03.919 --> 00:27:06.919
Trust in the Lord.

00:27:06.919 --> 00:27:09.919
Right? Proverbs 3 verse number 5 and 6.

00:27:09.919 --> 00:27:12.919
With all thine heart and lean not.

00:27:12.919 --> 00:27:15.919
You know the verses, right?

00:27:15.919 --> 00:27:18.919
And we find here this evening that they are going to

00:27:18.919 --> 00:27:22.919
seek to be strengthened by the strength of Pharaoh

00:27:22.919 --> 00:27:24.919
who is inferior to God Almighty

00:27:24.919 --> 00:27:26.919
and God had made it abundantly clear

00:27:26.919 --> 00:27:28.919
and demonstrated that truth.

00:27:28.919 --> 00:27:30.919
And then they're going to trust

00:27:30.919 --> 00:27:33.919
in the shadow of Egypt.

00:27:33.919 --> 00:27:36.919
That's a sad commentary, is it not?

00:27:36.919 --> 00:27:39.919
I mean, what a sad, sad indictment

00:27:39.919 --> 00:27:41.919
against the children of Israel here.

00:27:41.919 --> 00:27:44.919
And we find that we are to abide.

00:27:44.919 --> 00:27:46.919
You don't need to turn there,

00:27:46.919 --> 00:27:49.919
but I'm mindful this evening of the truth of Psalm 91.

00:27:49.919 --> 00:27:52.919
He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High

00:27:52.919 --> 00:27:56.919
shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.

00:27:56.919 --> 00:27:59.919
Not the shadow of Pharaoh of Egypt,

00:27:59.919 --> 00:28:01.919
but of the shadow of the Almighty.

00:28:01.919 --> 00:28:05.919
I will say to the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress.

00:28:05.919 --> 00:28:09.919
My God, in Him will I trust.

00:28:09.919 --> 00:28:11.919
Wow.

00:28:11.919 --> 00:28:13.919
If we know the Lord,

00:28:13.919 --> 00:28:17.919
why are we going to run to Egypt?

00:28:17.919 --> 00:28:20.919
Look at Isaiah 31.

00:28:20.919 --> 00:28:24.919
We see the indictment in Isaiah 30,

00:28:24.919 --> 00:28:28.919
but we see it continue in chapter 31.

00:28:28.919 --> 00:28:31.919
Woe to them, verse number 1,

00:28:31.919 --> 00:28:35.919
that go down to Egypt for help

00:28:35.919 --> 00:28:38.919
and stay on horses and trust in chariots.

00:28:38.919 --> 00:28:40.919
Why are they trusting in chariots?

00:28:40.919 --> 00:28:42.919
Because there aren't any.

00:28:42.919 --> 00:28:44.919
And in horsemen, because why?

00:28:44.919 --> 00:28:46.919
They're very strong.

00:28:46.919 --> 00:28:52.919
But they look not unto the Holy One of Israel,

00:28:52.919 --> 00:28:56.919
neither seek the Lord.

00:28:56.919 --> 00:28:59.919
Verse 2, yet He also is wise and will bring evil

00:28:59.919 --> 00:29:01.919
and will not call back His words,

00:29:01.919 --> 00:29:04.919
but will rise against the house of the evildoers

00:29:04.919 --> 00:29:06.919
and against the help of them that work iniquity.

00:29:06.919 --> 00:29:09.919
Now the Egyptians, notice what God says here

00:29:09.919 --> 00:29:10.919
in verse number 3.

00:29:10.919 --> 00:29:17.919
Now the Egyptians are men and not God,

00:29:17.919 --> 00:29:22.919
and their horses flesh and not spirit.

00:29:22.919 --> 00:29:25.919
When the Lord shall stretch out His hand,

00:29:25.919 --> 00:29:27.919
both he that helpeth shall fall

00:29:27.919 --> 00:29:29.919
and he that is hopin' shall fall down

00:29:29.919 --> 00:29:32.919
and they shall fail together.

00:29:32.919 --> 00:29:35.919
He says, woe to them that go down to Egypt for help.

00:29:35.919 --> 00:29:38.919
They look not unto the Holy One of Israel,

00:29:38.919 --> 00:29:41.919
neither seek the Lord.

00:29:41.919 --> 00:29:43.919
The psalmist says in Psalm 121,

00:29:43.919 --> 00:29:45.919
we used it as a theme verse a couple of years ago.

00:29:45.919 --> 00:29:47.919
I will lift up mine eyes into the hills

00:29:47.919 --> 00:29:49.919
from whence cometh my help.

00:29:49.919 --> 00:29:52.919
My help cometh from the Lord,

00:29:52.919 --> 00:29:56.919
which made heaven and earth.

00:29:56.919 --> 00:29:59.919
And so if we know the book of Hebrews

00:29:59.919 --> 00:30:02.819
in the 13th chapter says, the Lord is my helper.

00:30:03.999 --> 00:30:05.119
Aren't you thankful for that?

00:30:05.119 --> 00:30:06.659
What a blessing.

00:30:06.659 --> 00:30:08.359
And the little group that I was in this morning,

00:30:08.359 --> 00:30:10.999
I didn't offer a whole lot in the Sunday school time

00:30:10.999 --> 00:30:12.039
when we sat around the table.

00:30:12.039 --> 00:30:14.979
I asked some questions to try to promote some thinking,

00:30:14.979 --> 00:30:18.039
but I really didn't help them fill out some things.

00:30:18.039 --> 00:30:20.559
But one of the words that was on the list,

00:30:20.559 --> 00:30:22.919
the table that I was with in Sunday school this morning

00:30:22.919 --> 00:30:25.399
under the letter H was helper.

00:30:25.399 --> 00:30:26.899
He's my helper.

00:30:26.899 --> 00:30:29.119
And there are a bunch of little kids at our table.

00:30:29.119 --> 00:30:31.599
And I was excited to hear them put together

00:30:31.599 --> 00:30:32.599
and to have that idea.

00:30:32.599 --> 00:30:34.279
Joseph was there and Holly and I,

00:30:34.279 --> 00:30:36.919
and then some younger children there.

00:30:36.919 --> 00:30:38.359
And what a blessing.

00:30:38.359 --> 00:30:40.199
Listen, God is my helper.

00:30:40.199 --> 00:30:42.819
I don't need to run down to Egypt for help.

00:30:44.399 --> 00:30:46.079
And let me say this to you this evening,

00:30:46.079 --> 00:30:47.959
and I'm saying this to myself as well.

00:30:47.959 --> 00:30:50.199
And you understand, I said this when I prayed this morning.

00:30:50.199 --> 00:30:51.719
Listen, when I preach messages,

00:30:51.719 --> 00:30:54.159
God gets to deal with me all week as I prepare,

00:30:54.159 --> 00:30:56.199
and then he gets to deal with me again when I deliver.

00:30:56.199 --> 00:30:58.919
So I get it twice every time you get it once, amen?

00:30:59.599 --> 00:31:00.439
And that's just the way it works.

00:31:00.439 --> 00:31:01.959
And actually, it's probably more than twice

00:31:01.959 --> 00:31:04.559
because the preparation time is over and over and over,

00:31:04.559 --> 00:31:06.079
and so on and so forth.

00:31:06.079 --> 00:31:07.939
But understand with me this evening

00:31:07.939 --> 00:31:10.399
that if this was true of the children of Israel

00:31:10.399 --> 00:31:12.999
in Isaiah's day, you cannot tell me

00:31:12.999 --> 00:31:16.519
that it's still not true of God's people today.

00:31:16.519 --> 00:31:19.799
That there are times in your life and in my life

00:31:19.799 --> 00:31:23.839
when we go to the world and the world system

00:31:23.839 --> 00:31:28.839
for help and for counsel and never even ask for help.

00:31:28.999 --> 00:31:32.239
God, we're guilty.

00:31:32.239 --> 00:31:34.079
We may not want to admit it.

00:31:34.079 --> 00:31:36.719
We may not want to acknowledge this evening.

00:31:36.719 --> 00:31:38.959
We may not, we might've put that facade on

00:31:38.959 --> 00:31:42.159
of nope, I've never done that, pastor.

00:31:42.159 --> 00:31:44.239
But the reality is that we're all guilty,

00:31:44.239 --> 00:31:48.399
just like the children of Israel were guilty in Isaiah's day.

00:31:48.399 --> 00:31:51.439
There are times in our lives when we do,

00:31:51.439 --> 00:31:54.239
we don't even ask the Lord.

00:31:56.079 --> 00:31:57.719
We don't even, as it said in there,

00:31:57.719 --> 00:31:59.399
in chapter 30 and verse number two,

00:31:59.399 --> 00:32:03.039
they have not asked at my mouth.

00:32:03.039 --> 00:32:06.279
There are times that we've simply not even sought the Lord,

00:32:07.979 --> 00:32:11.279
but we've sought the counsel, the help,

00:32:11.279 --> 00:32:14.039
the direction of the world.

00:32:15.759 --> 00:32:19.799
And we see here this evening that this prophet Isaiah

00:32:19.799 --> 00:32:24.119
gives these indictments and we put all of this together

00:32:24.119 --> 00:32:26.559
and think about the truth back there

00:32:26.559 --> 00:32:30.639
in Genesis chapter 41, and we'll be in the New Testament

00:32:30.639 --> 00:32:32.119
in just a moment and finish the message,

00:32:32.119 --> 00:32:33.959
but in Genesis chapter 41,

00:32:33.959 --> 00:32:35.839
I want to remind you of the counsel once again.

00:32:35.839 --> 00:32:40.199
Remember the people, because all the land was famished,

00:32:40.199 --> 00:32:42.799
the people cried to Pharaoh for bread.

00:32:42.799 --> 00:32:46.479
And Pharaoh sent out all the Egyptians going to Joseph,

00:32:46.479 --> 00:32:47.839
what do you say if you do?

00:32:49.119 --> 00:32:51.939
Pharaoh wasn't able to offer any help.

00:32:51.939 --> 00:32:53.079
He sends them to Joseph.

00:32:53.079 --> 00:32:55.519
Joseph, as I mentioned a moment ago,

00:32:55.519 --> 00:32:58.599
is a type, a picture of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:32:58.599 --> 00:33:01.959
And it's very amazing to me that here in Genesis chapter 41

00:33:01.959 --> 00:33:04.799
and verse number 55, that here's what the Bible says,

00:33:04.799 --> 00:33:06.119
go unto Joseph.

00:33:06.119 --> 00:33:07.979
This is what Pharaoh says to the Egyptians,

00:33:07.979 --> 00:33:12.979
go unto Joseph and notice what he saith to you, do.

00:33:14.559 --> 00:33:17.959
Now, contextually, historically, what's going to happen

00:33:17.959 --> 00:33:19.799
is Joseph's gonna say, you want some bread?

00:33:19.799 --> 00:33:20.639
All right, here's what you do.

00:33:20.639 --> 00:33:22.199
You gotta give me this and I'll give you some bread

00:33:22.199 --> 00:33:23.039
and so on and so forth.

00:33:23.039 --> 00:33:24.919
Eventually they get the land and so on and so forth,

00:33:25.319 --> 00:33:28.079
and we'll study that over the next several weeks.

00:33:28.079 --> 00:33:30.399
So what he saith to you do, you want food?

00:33:30.399 --> 00:33:32.599
There's the source, you go to him and whatever he says,

00:33:32.599 --> 00:33:34.119
that's what happens, right?

00:33:35.079 --> 00:33:37.479
But I want you to think about Joseph being a type

00:33:37.479 --> 00:33:39.439
and a picture of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:33:41.799 --> 00:33:44.599
Whatsoever he saith to you, do.

00:33:46.279 --> 00:33:51.279
There's a athletic company that coined the phrase,

00:33:51.279 --> 00:33:52.519
just do it.

00:33:52.519 --> 00:33:54.499
No doubt you've heard that at some point

00:33:55.119 --> 00:33:56.379
over your life.

00:33:57.259 --> 00:34:02.259
When you think about this phrase, what he saith to you do,

00:34:02.639 --> 00:34:06.339
it reminds me of the Lord Jesus Christ in John chapter two.

00:34:06.339 --> 00:34:09.299
Turn to the book of John, if you will, the gospel of John.

00:34:10.659 --> 00:34:13.579
Of course, John chapter number one announces with,

00:34:13.579 --> 00:34:18.299
I mean, just great authority,

00:34:18.299 --> 00:34:20.859
the person of the Lord Jesus Christ

00:34:20.859 --> 00:34:23.099
and that he is God in flesh.

00:34:23.539 --> 00:34:27.019
I mean, what a powerful, powerful introduction

00:34:27.019 --> 00:34:29.819
that we receive in the gospel of John in the first chapter.

00:34:29.819 --> 00:34:31.779
And we come to the second chapter,

00:34:31.779 --> 00:34:34.219
and we find that this is the first miracle

00:34:34.219 --> 00:34:35.659
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:34:35.659 --> 00:34:37.979
In verse 11, it says, this beginning of miracles

00:34:37.979 --> 00:34:40.239
did Jesus in Cana of Galilee.

00:34:40.239 --> 00:34:44.179
And we find that in this particular text of scripture,

00:34:44.179 --> 00:34:46.499
and I'm not gonna take the time to deal with the entirety

00:34:46.499 --> 00:34:48.539
of the miracle and what have you,

00:34:48.539 --> 00:34:50.859
but I wanna hone in on verse number five

00:34:50.859 --> 00:34:55.099
and look at that phrase that Mary, the mother of Jesus says

00:34:55.099 --> 00:34:59.299
to those servants that are gathered together

00:34:59.299 --> 00:35:01.819
to provide some assistance, if you will.

00:35:01.819 --> 00:35:05.059
And we find that it's very similar

00:35:05.059 --> 00:35:08.659
to what Pharaoh says to the people of Egypt.

00:35:08.659 --> 00:35:12.619
And here's what the mother of Jesus, Mary says,

00:35:12.619 --> 00:35:15.139
notice in verse number five,

00:35:15.139 --> 00:35:17.339
his mother saith unto the servants,

00:35:18.299 --> 00:35:23.299
whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.

00:35:24.979 --> 00:35:27.739
Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.

00:35:28.819 --> 00:35:30.259
You know, the reality is sometimes

00:35:30.259 --> 00:35:32.779
we just have a hard time with that

00:35:32.779 --> 00:35:34.539
because we wanna do things our way.

00:35:35.859 --> 00:35:40.279
We wanna do things the way we wanna do things.

00:35:40.279 --> 00:35:41.819
We've heard another way, we've heard,

00:35:41.819 --> 00:35:43.779
maybe we've gotten counsel from some other source

00:35:43.779 --> 00:35:46.059
and what have you, but we find that even,

00:35:46.059 --> 00:35:48.179
listen, I sat in my office 11 years ago,

00:35:48.179 --> 00:35:49.539
no one here would even know the person

00:35:49.539 --> 00:35:50.579
that I was speaking to.

00:35:50.579 --> 00:35:52.499
And it was a mess of a situation,

00:35:52.499 --> 00:35:54.099
all sorts of crazy stuff, stuff

00:35:54.099 --> 00:35:56.979
I never even had thought happened.

00:35:56.979 --> 00:35:58.859
I'll be honest with you.

00:35:58.859 --> 00:35:59.699
I thought, what in the world?

00:35:59.699 --> 00:36:01.859
I'm sitting in my office, I'm like, is this real?

00:36:01.859 --> 00:36:02.739
Like, seriously?

00:36:02.739 --> 00:36:05.059
I didn't even know stuff like this happened.

00:36:05.059 --> 00:36:06.379
It was absolutely amazing.

00:36:08.219 --> 00:36:10.139
And I said, here's the, and they were trying to tell me

00:36:10.139 --> 00:36:11.899
how right they were with God and all this stuff.

00:36:11.899 --> 00:36:12.739
It was crazy.

00:36:13.779 --> 00:36:15.539
And I said, well, let me just ask you this.

00:36:15.939 --> 00:36:17.899
Are you doing everything God's telling you to do?

00:36:17.899 --> 00:36:19.499
Oh, yeah.

00:36:19.499 --> 00:36:22.099
I said, no, like whatsoever he sayeth, you do it.

00:36:22.099 --> 00:36:24.459
Oh, yeah, all of it.

00:36:24.459 --> 00:36:27.459
The guy was just lying straight out of his teeth, right?

00:36:27.459 --> 00:36:30.059
But the reality is that for us as God's people,

00:36:31.259 --> 00:36:35.419
we go to God for counsel and whatsoever he sayeth, we do it.

00:36:35.419 --> 00:36:36.539
You say, but it doesn't make sense.

00:36:36.539 --> 00:36:39.539
No, no, God's way doesn't always make sense.

00:36:39.539 --> 00:36:43.779
And let me say this, God's way doesn't have to make sense.

00:36:43.779 --> 00:36:44.619
Amen?

00:36:44.619 --> 00:36:47.499
Sometimes, and listen, those of us that are more logical

00:36:47.499 --> 00:36:51.619
and what have you and have that analytical type of a mind,

00:36:51.619 --> 00:36:53.699
sometimes we struggle with that, why?

00:36:53.699 --> 00:36:55.979
Because we want things to make sense.

00:36:56.819 --> 00:36:59.699
And God's ways are not our ways.

00:36:59.699 --> 00:37:00.819
Amen?

00:37:00.819 --> 00:37:04.419
And God says, do it.

00:37:04.419 --> 00:37:07.579
And this evening, when we think about the time of crisis,

00:37:07.579 --> 00:37:11.859
the time of great difficulty, the time of great distress,

00:37:11.859 --> 00:37:13.759
to whom do we go?

00:37:13.759 --> 00:37:15.039
To whom do we cry?

00:37:16.119 --> 00:37:18.519
See, we see what happened in Genesis 41

00:37:19.759 --> 00:37:22.519
when those seven years of dearth began.

00:37:22.519 --> 00:37:24.319
It was immediate and severe.

00:37:26.159 --> 00:37:28.959
We find that the people, they cried out,

00:37:28.959 --> 00:37:31.599
and I understand why they cried out.

00:37:31.599 --> 00:37:32.899
They cried out to Pharaoh.

00:37:33.799 --> 00:37:35.599
And Pharaoh and Ensign said, I can't help you.

00:37:35.599 --> 00:37:37.899
Go to Joseph, and whatsoever he sayeth, do it.

00:37:39.639 --> 00:37:41.039
What he sayeth to you, do.

00:37:42.039 --> 00:37:44.639
If we look at these types this evening,

00:37:45.639 --> 00:37:49.639
for us in 2023, almost 2024 now,

00:37:49.639 --> 00:37:51.879
we have times of crisis and difficulty.

00:37:51.879 --> 00:37:52.819
To whom do we flee?

00:37:52.819 --> 00:37:53.959
To whom do we go?

00:37:55.079 --> 00:37:56.639
Don't go to Egypt.

00:37:56.639 --> 00:37:57.899
Don't go to the world.

00:37:58.759 --> 00:38:01.159
The world doesn't have anything to offer you.

00:38:02.839 --> 00:38:04.479
Go to God.

00:38:04.479 --> 00:38:06.519
Seek God.

00:38:06.519 --> 00:38:09.799
And whatever God says, do it.

00:38:10.759 --> 00:38:12.239
Do it.

00:38:12.239 --> 00:38:14.159
You know that we do not have to pray

00:38:14.159 --> 00:38:17.879
about what God has revealed for us to do in his word.

00:38:17.879 --> 00:38:18.959
You know what I mean by that?

00:38:18.959 --> 00:38:20.599
When God tells us to do something,

00:38:20.599 --> 00:38:23.239
we don't say, well, you know, I'm gonna pray about that.

00:38:23.239 --> 00:38:25.159
When God says that we're to rejoice in everything,

00:38:25.159 --> 00:38:26.859
give thanks for this will of God and Christ Jesus

00:38:26.859 --> 00:38:28.959
concerning you, I'm gonna pray about that.

00:38:28.959 --> 00:38:31.059
No, no, no, just do it.

00:38:31.059 --> 00:38:31.979
Amen?

00:38:31.979 --> 00:38:33.399
You don't have to pray about whether you're gonna,

00:38:33.399 --> 00:38:34.760
you don't have to pray about whether you're gonna give.

00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:36.599
You don't have to pray whether you're gonna go to church.

00:38:36.599 --> 00:38:37.559
You don't have to pray.

00:38:37.559 --> 00:38:39.359
We're commanded to do those things.

00:38:39.719 --> 00:38:41.200
We don't pray about the commands.

00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:42.359
Does that make sense?

00:38:42.359 --> 00:38:43.760
We just do them.

00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:44.919
We just obey.

00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:47.320
And God will bless.

00:38:48.399 --> 00:38:50.519
See, God's way is not always our way.

00:38:50.519 --> 00:38:51.519
But you know what God wants us to do?

00:38:51.519 --> 00:38:52.940
He wants us to trust him.

00:38:54.359 --> 00:38:55.679
He is the almighty.

00:38:57.159 --> 00:38:59.359
He is the one that spoke everything into existence.

00:38:59.359 --> 00:39:01.899
He is the one that saved your soul.

00:39:01.899 --> 00:39:03.779
You understand that there's nothing you can do tonight

00:39:03.779 --> 00:39:06.039
to get to heaven on your own.

00:39:06.039 --> 00:39:07.440
We all agree on that.

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:09.639
There's nothing we can do to get to heaven on our own.

00:39:09.639 --> 00:39:12.359
We need Jesus.

00:39:12.359 --> 00:39:13.200
Would you agree?

00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:18.159
But you know what happens sometimes for living tomorrow?

00:39:18.159 --> 00:39:19.579
We think, I got this.

00:39:20.799 --> 00:39:21.899
I can handle tomorrow.

00:39:21.899 --> 00:39:24.320
I mean, I can't handle eternity,

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:25.639
but I can handle tomorrow.

00:39:25.639 --> 00:39:27.599
I can handle this week.

00:39:27.599 --> 00:39:30.519
And we live independently of God.

00:39:31.399 --> 00:39:34.119
And that just makes zero sense.

00:39:34.119 --> 00:39:37.679
Listen, if you can trust him with your eternal destiny,

00:39:37.679 --> 00:39:40.039
you can trust him with your tomorrow.

00:39:40.039 --> 00:39:41.359
Amen?

00:39:41.359 --> 00:39:43.559
If you can trust him with your eternal destiny,

00:39:43.559 --> 00:39:47.239
you can trust him with tomorrow.

00:39:47.239 --> 00:39:49.839
Whatsoever he sayeth unto you, do it.

00:39:49.839 --> 00:39:51.159
To whom do we cry?

00:39:51.159 --> 00:39:53.880
To whom do we go in times of crisis?

00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:54.839
We all face them.

00:39:54.839 --> 00:39:56.919
We all have times of great difficulty.

00:39:56.919 --> 00:40:00.119
And I hope tonight that we run to the cross.

00:40:00.119 --> 00:40:04.119
that we run to the Lord Jesus Christ and we say,

00:40:04.119 --> 00:40:08.119
Lord, help me. You ever read Psalm 12?

00:40:08.119 --> 00:40:12.119
Help, Lord. That's how it begins. You know, sometimes that's all we can pray.

00:40:12.119 --> 00:40:16.119
Help, Lord. I just need help and I know that you're the helper

00:40:16.119 --> 00:40:20.119
and you said that you would give us help. Aren't you so thankful

00:40:20.119 --> 00:40:24.119
that we have a wonderful Savior and He offers to give us

00:40:24.119 --> 00:40:28.119
the counsel, the direction that we need. He's our

00:40:28.119 --> 00:40:32.119
shepherd and as our shepherd, He takes good care

00:40:32.119 --> 00:40:36.119
of His sheep. Let's pray this evening. Father, we love You.

00:40:36.119 --> 00:40:40.119
We thank You for loving us. We thank You for Your Word, the truth contained therein.

00:40:40.119 --> 00:40:44.119
I pray that even as we look at this historical event,

00:40:44.119 --> 00:40:48.119
this time in Egypt

00:40:48.119 --> 00:40:52.119
when Joseph is there and this famine begins

00:40:52.119 --> 00:40:56.119
and the land is famished,

00:40:56.119 --> 00:41:00.119
Lord, I pray that tonight as we can understand

00:41:00.119 --> 00:41:04.119
the historical context of this event that we also

00:41:04.119 --> 00:41:08.119
would be able to make application in our lives. Lord,

00:41:08.119 --> 00:41:12.119
I pray that You'd help us tonight

00:41:12.119 --> 00:41:16.119
to run to You in times of difficulty, of great

00:41:16.119 --> 00:41:20.119
need, of great distress, times of crisis.

00:41:20.119 --> 00:41:24.119
Help us, Lord, not to run to the world, the world

00:41:24.119 --> 00:41:28.119
system. Help us, Lord, to trust You,

00:41:28.119 --> 00:41:32.119
to obey You. I pray that You'd help us, Lord,

00:41:32.119 --> 00:41:36.119
to be doers of the Word and not hearers only. Help us to have a heart

00:41:36.119 --> 00:41:40.119
of surrender and submission to You and to Your

00:41:40.119 --> 00:41:44.119
Word. I pray that in these few moments of invitation that You'd have Your will and way

00:41:44.119 --> 00:41:48.119
that You would move and work in hearts and lives as only You can. We'll thank You for

00:41:48.119 --> 00:41:50.119
what You'll do. For it's in Christ's name we pray.
