1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
10 this evening, plan to preach a little bit shorter

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,780
this evening at the end of the invitation tonight.

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,039
We have a couple of update videos

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:09,760
that we're gonna watch from our missionaries.

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,640
We've gotten a couple of updates recently

6
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,560
from missionaries via video,

7
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,559
and I always like to be able to show those to you

8
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:18,959
so that you can see what God is doing

9
00:00:18,959 --> 00:00:20,700
and how God is working.

10
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,520
And we'd gotten a couple right at the same time,

11
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,860
and I was just praying about when to show those.

12
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,680
Sometimes we show them on a Wednesday evening,

13
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,760
but of course, several folks aren't here

14
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,299
with student ministries and other things going on.

15
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:36,720
And the Lord laid this passage of scripture

16
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,599
upon my heart for this week, for tonight,

17
00:00:39,599 --> 00:00:41,680
and to show these videos.

18
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,200
In Romans 10 is a familiar passage of scripture.

19
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,240
We think about missions.

20
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,880
I've titled the message tonight, Why Missions?

21
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,159
And really, the thought of the songs

22
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:54,400
that we've had the opportunity to sing tonight about heaven,

23
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,119
well, that's a good reason to answer the question,

24
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:00,159
why missions, because eternity is certain,

25
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:01,799
and people are gonna die,

26
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:04,480
and people are gonna spend eternity in either heaven

27
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,839
or the lake of fire, and we have the truth.

28
00:01:06,839 --> 00:01:10,239
We have the opportunity to take the message of the gospel

29
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:12,319
to a lost and dying world.

30
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:14,519
If you've been around Fellowship Baptist Church

31
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:15,879
for any period of time,

32
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:18,879
you know that world missions is a priority.

33
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:20,500
A number of years ago, in fact,

34
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,360
the first calendar year that I was here as the pastor,

35
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,000
I worked with Brother Doug Cook about an idea

36
00:01:27,839 --> 00:01:29,440
in order to put a map in our sanctuary

37
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,879
that would give us an idea of missions

38
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:34,080
that would say, as you walk in,

39
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,220
it would just kinda scream for your attention.

40
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,519
All of you are looking over there,

41
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:39,599
even as I'm talking about it,

42
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,720
because what happens is you walk into this sanctuary,

43
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,319
and you have immediately,

44
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:46,379
your eyes are drawn to a couple of things,

45
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:49,139
the pulpit area, by the way, that's on purpose,

46
00:01:49,139 --> 00:01:52,440
but also to the map on the wall,

47
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,339
and over here, send the light with another map of the world.

48
00:01:55,339 --> 00:01:58,260
That's our duty, that's our mission,

49
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,500
and we began to talk about

50
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,300
how we could do something like this.

51
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,819
I had a lot of ideas,

52
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:05,779
and knew where to buy a lot of things

53
00:02:05,779 --> 00:02:07,419
from my days in the corporate world,

54
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:10,300
but the ability to put all of that together,

55
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,419
well, God allowed Doug Cook to be here

56
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:13,740
and to have that ability,

57
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,520
and he worked, and several of our men

58
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,979
would go over to his house regularly

59
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:21,660
as they worked on this project,

60
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,380
and still today, I hear many people,

61
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,460
in fact, I think Mimi last Sunday night,

62
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,860
we had some visitors, and she said,

63
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,220
do you see our missions map?

64
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,100
And she takes them over there to show them our missions map.

65
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,139
Every time we have a missionary that comes,

66
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:36,380
we have the opportunity to show them our missions map,

67
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,779
and to show them how it lights up,

68
00:02:37,779 --> 00:02:42,660
and give us that indication of where we have representation,

69
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,380
and where we do not have representation,

70
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,220
and missions is a priority,

71
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,919
and I'm thankful for that.

72
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:51,899
We make every effort, I make every effort

73
00:02:51,899 --> 00:02:54,539
to ensure that you're provided with updates,

74
00:02:54,539 --> 00:02:56,380
and that you have an opportunity

75
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:00,300
to be able to pray effectively and intelligently

76
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,000
for our missionaries.

77
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,820
How can you pray for them intelligently

78
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,020
if you don't know what their needs are,

79
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,740
if you're not receiving updates,

80
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:11,059
and so missionaries provide updates at various times.

81
00:03:11,059 --> 00:03:13,899
Some people, some missionaries provide updates every month,

82
00:03:13,899 --> 00:03:15,279
some every other month.

83
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:18,020
We require no less than one a quarter,

84
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,619
and we have the opportunity to get those update letters,

85
00:03:20,619 --> 00:03:23,179
and we seek to provide you with those updates

86
00:03:23,179 --> 00:03:25,940
Wednesday evenings on the back of our prayer bulletin,

87
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,300
three or four a week that we give you,

88
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:31,259
and Sunday mornings, we have a missions moment

89
00:03:31,259 --> 00:03:32,839
in our Sunday morning service,

90
00:03:32,839 --> 00:03:35,179
so that we can bring an update to you.

91
00:03:35,179 --> 00:03:36,660
The young men have been helping,

92
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,139
I've done some of those,

93
00:03:38,139 --> 00:03:41,479
and Joseph and Tim have been helping with that,

94
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:44,020
getting them some opportunity to serve,

95
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,740
and we have an opportunity to have a directory.

96
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:49,020
It's amazing to me, especially with,

97
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,539
I think of Brother Scott Cottle and others

98
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:53,860
that have come and seen our missionary directory,

99
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,419
and they say, man, can I take one of these?

100
00:03:55,419 --> 00:03:58,220
This is phenomenal, this is a great tool,

101
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,619
and we wanna keep that in front of you, why?

102
00:04:00,619 --> 00:04:02,860
Because missions is important.

103
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,520
Missions is a priority,

104
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:08,740
and we encourage you regularly to give to missions.

105
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,479
Why do we encourage you to give to missions?

106
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:13,520
Well, because it is our privilege

107
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,179
to be able to give of our resources

108
00:04:16,179 --> 00:04:18,040
that God blesses us with,

109
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,480
not just to give a tithe and an offering

110
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,940
to the local church,

111
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:25,160
but to designate and give toward missions,

112
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,119
toward world missions, why?

113
00:04:27,119 --> 00:04:29,040
So that we can support all those missionaries,

114
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,059
so that the gospel can go forward.

115
00:04:31,059 --> 00:04:34,559
We have on our weekly offering envelopes,

116
00:04:34,559 --> 00:04:36,040
there's only two categories,

117
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,119
and one is general offering, tithe and offering,

118
00:04:39,119 --> 00:04:40,880
and one is missions.

119
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,799
I'm thankful that when I first got saved,

120
00:04:43,799 --> 00:04:47,359
someone challenged me with regard to missions giving,

121
00:04:47,359 --> 00:04:50,079
and I've had people ask me over the years,

122
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:51,880
how do you determine your missions giving,

123
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,339
and so on and so forth.

124
00:04:53,339 --> 00:04:55,119
I don't think there's a magic formula.

125
00:04:55,119 --> 00:04:57,559
I do know that it's not part of your tithe.

126
00:04:57,559 --> 00:04:59,440
I know that the tithe is one thing,

127
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,559
and missions is a different thing,

128
00:05:01,559 --> 00:05:04,359
and to be able to give to missions, what a blessing,

129
00:05:04,359 --> 00:05:06,019
and for all these years,

130
00:05:06,019 --> 00:05:07,600
Holly and I have had the opportunity

131
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,359
to give personally to missions.

132
00:05:09,359 --> 00:05:11,739
I don't just encourage our church family

133
00:05:11,739 --> 00:05:14,160
to give to missions, but I, we participate,

134
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,359
we give to missions, why?

135
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,720
Because we're investing in eternity.

136
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,200
We're investing in eternity.

137
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,239
Missions, I believe, is the heartbeat of God.

138
00:05:24,239 --> 00:05:25,200
I really do.

139
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,519
For God so loved the world

140
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:30,420
that he gave his only begotten son, right?

141
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:33,799
He sent the Lord Jesus Christ to this world.

142
00:05:33,799 --> 00:05:34,640
Why?

143
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,459
To save sinners.

144
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:38,239
This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation

145
00:05:38,239 --> 00:05:40,019
that Christ Jesus came into the world

146
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:40,859
for what purpose?

147
00:05:40,859 --> 00:05:43,399
To save sinners, 1 Timothy,

148
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:46,279
and we find that missions is not only the heart of God,

149
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:48,959
but it really should be the life of any local church,

150
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:50,160
any New Testament church,

151
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,720
they should have a robust missions program,

152
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,399
and we ought to be mindful of our responsibility

153
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,920
to reach our Jerusalem,

154
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,920
but at the same time reaching

155
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:05,079
to the uttermost part of the earth, the world.

156
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:06,440
What an opportunity.

157
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,119
I mentioned this morning in the book of Acts,

158
00:06:08,119 --> 00:06:10,760
the Bible says that the early church,

159
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,260
they filled Jerusalem with their doctrine,

160
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,839
but then we see also in the early church

161
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:18,440
that it said of them that they turned the world upside down.

162
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,480
The known world received the gospel,

163
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,600
the missionary journeys that we read of

164
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,119
beginning in Acts 13 and how even in Acts 8,

165
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:28,239
that they that were scattered from Jerusalem,

166
00:06:28,239 --> 00:06:30,200
they went everywhere preaching the word,

167
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,119
and how God was using his people

168
00:06:33,119 --> 00:06:35,920
to take the gospel message to the world,

169
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:40,119
and that still remains our responsibility to this very day.

170
00:06:40,119 --> 00:06:43,079
I say this to just simply say to God be the glory.

171
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:45,040
I did a little research last week.

172
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,880
Why?

173
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,299
Because we say that missions is a priority,

174
00:06:48,299 --> 00:06:51,239
but you know the reality is you can say anything you want.

175
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,160
You can say anything you want.

176
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,380
I know church is the same mission is a priority,

177
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,959
but really it's not a priority,

178
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,760
and I'm not casting stones, it's just the reality,

179
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,000
and as we say that missions is a priority,

180
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,040
I did a little research,

181
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,519
and during the time that God has allowed me

182
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:08,779
to be the pastor at Fellowship Baptist Church,

183
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:13,619
almost 30% of our total income has gone to world missions.

184
00:07:13,619 --> 00:07:15,579
I say to God be the glory,

185
00:07:15,579 --> 00:07:19,100
and that's a phenomenal testimony of a church

186
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:23,420
that has a focus on reaching the world with the gospel,

187
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,500
and I praise the Lord for it.

188
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,779
This year, this calendar year,

189
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:32,179
if God would allow, if things would continue,

190
00:07:32,179 --> 00:07:35,220
and of course we're not presuming upon the Lord

191
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:38,339
or in anything else, but if things would continue,

192
00:07:38,899 --> 00:07:40,420
and at the close of this calendar year,

193
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:44,260
we will come very close to hitting or exceeding

194
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:47,540
one and a half million dollars of missions giving

195
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,859
through our church during my tenure,

196
00:07:49,859 --> 00:07:51,220
and I just praise the Lord for that.

197
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,019
I think to God be the glory.

198
00:07:53,019 --> 00:07:56,019
I've often been asked, and I'm at the age now

199
00:07:56,019 --> 00:07:58,660
where I'm really not an old man, praise the Lord for that,

200
00:07:58,660 --> 00:07:59,579
I'm still a young man,

201
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:01,100
but I've been pastoring the same church

202
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,500
for 12 and a half years,

203
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,299
and so often I begin to get questions from other pastors,

204
00:08:05,299 --> 00:08:08,459
younger pastors or pastors that are going to a church

205
00:08:08,459 --> 00:08:09,739
and just kind of beginning,

206
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:12,820
and they've asked questions about missions and what have you

207
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:16,019
and I regularly try to tell these pastors

208
00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:18,820
that if you wanna have a missions-minded church,

209
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:21,820
you need to place an emphasis on missions.

210
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,660
It's not gonna happen on accident,

211
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,660
and I appreciate your investment.

212
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:29,500
I appreciate the opportunity that we have corporately,

213
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,580
collectively to be involved in world missions.

214
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,500
Why missions?

215
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,780
We deal with the subject and we understand that missions,

216
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:39,979
as we give to missions, as we pray for missions,

217
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:43,820
that we're making an investment in eternity.

218
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,580
We're making an investment in eternity.

219
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:48,799
You ever hear people talk about investing and investments

220
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:50,900
and they have portfolios and all sorts of things

221
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,820
that they wanna give you,

222
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:55,780
and quite honestly, I'm readily admitting

223
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:59,059
that that is not my strong area, my strong suit,

224
00:08:59,059 --> 00:09:00,700
but there are some people that are very smart

225
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,979
and wise in that situation and what have you,

226
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,780
and they have people that you can talk to,

227
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,140
but I want you to understand that when you give to missions

228
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,780
that you're investing in eternity.

229
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,020
You're investing in eternity.

230
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,580
A missionary once said this,

231
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:15,159
and the returns are out of this world,

232
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:17,059
and I understand what they meant by that,

233
00:09:17,059 --> 00:09:19,940
and I like the phraseology because so often

234
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,739
when you start talking about investments,

235
00:09:21,739 --> 00:09:23,719
what is the question you wanna have is,

236
00:09:23,719 --> 00:09:27,059
what is the return on my investment, ROI, right?

237
00:09:27,059 --> 00:09:29,979
What is my return on my investment?

238
00:09:29,979 --> 00:09:31,859
We've had, I don't know the numbers.

239
00:09:31,859 --> 00:09:34,140
It would be impossible for me

240
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,940
to be able to calculate the numbers

241
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,900
because of the number of missionaries that we have

242
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,359
and the way that the update letters come in,

243
00:09:40,359 --> 00:09:43,739
but hundreds, if not thousands of souls

244
00:09:43,739 --> 00:09:46,539
have been saved through our missions program

245
00:09:46,539 --> 00:09:49,979
as we have the opportunity to support these missionaries.

246
00:09:49,979 --> 00:09:50,900
Now think about that.

247
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,619
Paul says the church at Philippi

248
00:09:52,619 --> 00:09:54,260
in Philippians chapter number four

249
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,099
that this is fruit to your account,

250
00:09:57,099 --> 00:09:59,140
and God keeps record of that,

251
00:09:59,140 --> 00:09:59,979
and these missionaries,

252
00:09:59,979 --> 00:10:01,899
that we have the opportunity to support

253
00:10:01,899 --> 00:10:04,819
and we hear back from them of souls being saved

254
00:10:04,819 --> 00:10:09,059
and lives being changed and discipleship going forward,

255
00:10:09,059 --> 00:10:10,499
you have a part in that.

256
00:10:10,499 --> 00:10:11,619
If you're giving to missions,

257
00:10:11,619 --> 00:10:13,939
our church has a part in that, why?

258
00:10:13,939 --> 00:10:15,739
Because we support missions.

259
00:10:15,739 --> 00:10:17,719
And we want you as an individual,

260
00:10:17,719 --> 00:10:21,059
every individual to have a part in that, why?

261
00:10:21,059 --> 00:10:23,339
Because collectively we're making an investment,

262
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:25,619
but it's made up of individuals

263
00:10:25,619 --> 00:10:28,019
that are giving and making that investment.

264
00:10:28,059 --> 00:10:31,099
Dozens of churches have been started.

265
00:10:31,099 --> 00:10:34,579
We can look at pictures over the years of empty fields

266
00:10:34,579 --> 00:10:37,619
where there was no church and now there's a church.

267
00:10:37,619 --> 00:10:40,319
We can look at pictures of storefront buildings

268
00:10:40,319 --> 00:10:43,019
where other establishments and businesses

269
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:46,579
had their business in these particular locations

270
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:50,079
and they were vacant and now there's a church in that place.

271
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,819
We can think even most recently of a situation

272
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,699
there in Belgium with the Haley family

273
00:10:55,699 --> 00:10:58,859
where a restaurant has been converted to a church

274
00:10:58,859 --> 00:11:00,899
and to God be the glory.

275
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:03,659
That's exciting when you have the opportunity to see that

276
00:11:03,659 --> 00:11:05,659
and to think about the local church

277
00:11:05,659 --> 00:11:09,139
and what God intends for the church and what the church is.

278
00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:12,779
We've had the opportunity as we provide help

279
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:13,919
with Beacon of Truth,

280
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:17,559
not only in supporting that ministry financially,

281
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:20,659
but also in putting Romans booklets together.

282
00:11:20,659 --> 00:11:22,379
I've said jokingly,

283
00:11:22,379 --> 00:11:24,899
but I think there's a measure of seriousness to it

284
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:25,819
that if I ever said

285
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:28,019
that we were gonna cancel scripture assembly

286
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:29,399
and we're not gonna do it anymore,

287
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:32,079
I'd get fired and you'd look for a new pastor.

288
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:32,919
And why?

289
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:35,259
Because you love that ministry.

290
00:11:35,259 --> 00:11:38,879
We've put over 400,000 Romans booklets together.

291
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:42,299
We have, our church personally, we've done that.

292
00:11:42,299 --> 00:11:44,059
I mentioned it's fruit to our account.

293
00:11:44,059 --> 00:11:45,659
The Bible says you're there in Romans 10.

294
00:11:45,659 --> 00:11:47,179
We'll be there in just a moment.

295
00:11:47,179 --> 00:11:48,139
But in Philippians,

296
00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:49,799
I want you to see what Paul says

297
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:51,459
about the church at Philippi

298
00:11:51,459 --> 00:11:55,579
and how he commends them here beginning

299
00:11:55,579 --> 00:11:58,979
in verse number 14 of Philippians chapter four.

300
00:11:58,979 --> 00:12:02,739
And what a blessing to think about the church at Philippi

301
00:12:02,739 --> 00:12:05,059
and the part that they had

302
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:07,939
in helping the work of the ministry

303
00:12:07,939 --> 00:12:10,319
through their offering, through their contribution.

304
00:12:10,319 --> 00:12:11,159
It says in verse 14,

305
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:14,919
notwithstanding ye have well done,

306
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:17,839
that ye did communicate with my affliction.

307
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,239
Now you Philippians know also

308
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,839
that in the beginning of the gospel,

309
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,599
when I departed from Macedonia,

310
00:12:23,599 --> 00:12:24,719
notice what he says,

311
00:12:24,719 --> 00:12:26,959
no church communicated with me

312
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,799
as concerning giving and receiving.

313
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:31,279
Notice those last three words,

314
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:35,679
but ye only, but ye only.

315
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:38,439
Aren't you thankful for the church at Philippi?

316
00:12:38,439 --> 00:12:39,259
Why?

317
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:40,639
Because it enabled Paul to be able to go

318
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,719
and to continue to preach the gospel message.

319
00:12:42,719 --> 00:12:44,599
Notice in verse 17,

320
00:12:44,599 --> 00:12:45,439
Paul says this,

321
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:47,879
not because I desire a gift,

322
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:52,879
but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.

323
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,279
How does that work?

324
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:56,159
I just trust God with it.

325
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:57,439
I'm not sure how it all works.

326
00:12:57,439 --> 00:13:00,599
I'm not sure how God keeps account of all of that,

327
00:13:00,599 --> 00:13:02,319
but I know that God does.

328
00:13:02,319 --> 00:13:05,039
And I know that it's an investment in eternity.

329
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:06,559
And we can trust that God,

330
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:08,299
he'd do with all things well.

331
00:13:08,299 --> 00:13:09,399
In verse 18, he says,

332
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:10,719
but I have all that abound.

333
00:13:10,719 --> 00:13:13,279
I am full having received of Epaphroditus,

334
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,239
the things which were sent from you.

335
00:13:15,239 --> 00:13:17,039
And then notice how those things,

336
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:19,679
that offering, how it's described,

337
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:24,239
an odor of a sweet smell, a sacrifice,

338
00:13:24,239 --> 00:13:29,199
acceptable, well-pleasing to God.

339
00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:32,159
God was pleased with the church at Philippi

340
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:35,519
because they gave, they gave regularly.

341
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,599
And then the great promise that many of us

342
00:13:37,599 --> 00:13:38,919
are familiar with in verse 19,

343
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:41,479
but my God shall supply all your need

344
00:13:41,479 --> 00:13:44,999
according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.

345
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:48,079
And we read in the book of 2 Corinthians

346
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,799
how that they gave out of their poverty

347
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:53,839
and they were first willing to give of themselves.

348
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,879
And quite honestly, I'm convicted as I read that truth

349
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:00,939
in 2 Corinthians, when the Bible speaks about,

350
00:14:00,939 --> 00:14:02,679
as Paul is speaking to them about

351
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:04,759
how they gave out of their poverty.

352
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:07,119
And I begin to think about that

353
00:14:07,119 --> 00:14:09,479
and I begin to be challenged, why?

354
00:14:09,479 --> 00:14:12,959
Because so often here in 2024,

355
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,799
most often we give out of our abundance,

356
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:18,239
not out of our poverty.

357
00:14:19,319 --> 00:14:20,279
We really do.

358
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:25,639
It's fruit to our account.

359
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:27,879
It's a joy, I mentioned already,

360
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:31,759
to personally be involved in giving to missions.

361
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:34,979
It's a joy to know that as we give to Bible projects

362
00:14:34,979 --> 00:14:37,879
and we've given to Papua New Guinea Bible project,

363
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:41,439
to Samoan Bible project, involved in other Bible projects

364
00:14:41,439 --> 00:14:43,519
as we send these Bibles around the world.

365
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:44,959
But those two in particular,

366
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:49,719
we had very specific designated campaigns, if you will,

367
00:14:49,719 --> 00:14:52,959
to raise funds for those Bibles.

368
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,439
I'm thankful to have had a part, our family, your family,

369
00:14:56,439 --> 00:14:59,799
us as a church in knowing that there's some people

370
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:01,039
on the other side of the world

371
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:05,279
that can hold a Bible in their hand today because you gave.

372
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,939
Isn't that amazing?

373
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:09,119
It's absolutely phenomenal.

374
00:15:09,119 --> 00:15:11,119
This book, the Bible says in Psalm 119,

375
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:13,839
the entrance of thy words giveth light.

376
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,519
And what a joy and what a blessing.

377
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,199
It's a blessing to be a pastor of a church

378
00:15:18,199 --> 00:15:20,339
with a heart for world missions.

379
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:24,559
And I just thank you this evening for your part in missions.

380
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:27,959
And it's not something that I obviously could do on my own.

381
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:31,079
I try to cast the vision and try to encourage you

382
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:34,319
and do all that I can to keep it before you.

383
00:15:34,319 --> 00:15:36,099
And I appreciate your response.

384
00:15:36,099 --> 00:15:38,359
I appreciate your sensitivity to the Lord.

385
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,439
I appreciate the fact that when a missionary has a need

386
00:15:41,439 --> 00:15:44,479
that people are ready to help and do what we can

387
00:15:44,479 --> 00:15:46,519
to help with those missionaries.

388
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:48,439
I appreciate how you pray for our missionaries.

389
00:15:48,439 --> 00:15:52,199
I appreciate the way in which you give and pray

390
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:54,199
and support our missionaries.

391
00:15:54,199 --> 00:15:56,279
As we answer the question, why missions?

392
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:57,959
We come to Romans 10.

393
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:00,239
We'll look at just a few verses of scripture this evening.

394
00:16:00,239 --> 00:16:01,719
It's a passage of scripture

395
00:16:01,719 --> 00:16:04,119
that is quite familiar to many of us.

396
00:16:04,119 --> 00:16:07,039
In Romans chapter number 10, beginning in verse number 13,

397
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:09,919
again, a verse that many of us could quote tonight.

398
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:10,759
The Bible says,

399
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:14,359
for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord

400
00:16:14,359 --> 00:16:17,119
shall be saved.

401
00:16:17,119 --> 00:16:19,719
Aren't you thankful for that Bible verse?

402
00:16:19,719 --> 00:16:23,259
For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord

403
00:16:23,259 --> 00:16:25,399
shall be saved.

404
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:26,599
Verse 14 says this,

405
00:16:26,599 --> 00:16:29,959
how then shall they call on him

406
00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:32,639
in whom they have not believed?

407
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,379
And how shall they believe in him

408
00:16:34,379 --> 00:16:36,479
of whom they have not heard?

409
00:16:36,479 --> 00:16:39,279
And how shall they hear without a preacher?

410
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:43,439
And how shall they preach except they be sent?

411
00:16:43,439 --> 00:16:44,999
As it is written,

412
00:16:44,999 --> 00:16:46,619
how beautiful are the feet of them

413
00:16:46,619 --> 00:16:48,959
that preach the gospel of peace

414
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,199
and bring glad tidings of good things.

415
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:55,199
But they have not all obeyed the gospel.

416
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,959
For Isaiah saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?

417
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,239
So then faith cometh by hearing,

418
00:17:01,239 --> 00:17:03,619
and hearing by the word of God.

419
00:17:04,479 --> 00:17:06,319
As we look at this passage of scripture,

420
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,279
if you're taking notes,

421
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:09,279
just a couple of thoughts.

422
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:12,719
Number one, we see that there's a precious promise.

423
00:17:12,719 --> 00:17:14,879
Verse 13 is a precious verse of scripture

424
00:17:14,879 --> 00:17:18,479
that I remember someone sharing with me many years ago.

425
00:17:18,479 --> 00:17:19,979
I remember many years ago,

426
00:17:19,979 --> 00:17:23,179
as I was not certain, of course, of my salvation,

427
00:17:23,179 --> 00:17:25,479
I did not know that heaven was my home.

428
00:17:25,479 --> 00:17:26,799
And someone took a Bible

429
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,239
and showed me how I could know for sure

430
00:17:28,239 --> 00:17:29,519
that heaven was my home.

431
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:30,879
And I remember that eventually

432
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,959
he got into Romans 10 in verse number 13.

433
00:17:32,959 --> 00:17:35,619
And I can't tell you how many times over the years

434
00:17:35,619 --> 00:17:37,939
I've had the opportunity to speak with people

435
00:17:37,939 --> 00:17:40,499
about the gospel and to share the gospel

436
00:17:40,499 --> 00:17:43,059
of the Lord Jesus Christ with individuals,

437
00:17:43,059 --> 00:17:45,419
with groups of people in preaching services

438
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:46,619
and so on and so forth,

439
00:17:46,619 --> 00:17:49,779
and use this verse of scripture to say to them,

440
00:17:49,779 --> 00:17:52,939
for whosoever, and I kind of pause there and say,

441
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:54,539
you know, that means anybody.

442
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:56,659
We could take and insert our name

443
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:58,219
into that verse of scripture.

444
00:17:58,219 --> 00:18:00,099
And we can understand that the Bible

445
00:18:00,099 --> 00:18:02,059
gives this precious promise,

446
00:18:02,099 --> 00:18:06,179
for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord

447
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:09,259
shall be saved.

448
00:18:09,259 --> 00:18:11,739
Man, I hope you never get over this precious promise

449
00:18:11,739 --> 00:18:14,219
of Romans 10 in verse number 13.

450
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:17,499
The reality this evening is that God gives us a promise.

451
00:18:17,499 --> 00:18:19,219
He does not say that you might be saved.

452
00:18:19,219 --> 00:18:20,779
He does not say that you could be saved.

453
00:18:20,779 --> 00:18:24,739
He says that you shall be saved.

454
00:18:24,739 --> 00:18:28,339
The reality this evening is that God is not a man

455
00:18:28,339 --> 00:18:30,379
that he should lie, amen.

456
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:32,380
Titus says it this way.

457
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,459
In Titus chapter number one,

458
00:18:34,459 --> 00:18:37,139
it's a precious truth that God gives us.

459
00:18:37,139 --> 00:18:38,059
In verse number three,

460
00:18:38,059 --> 00:18:40,779
but hath in due times manifested his word

461
00:18:41,859 --> 00:18:43,619
through preaching, which is committed unto me

462
00:18:43,619 --> 00:18:45,739
according to the commandment of our Savior,

463
00:18:45,739 --> 00:18:47,500
to God our Savior.

464
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,539
In verse number two, in hope of eternal life,

465
00:18:49,539 --> 00:18:54,539
which God that cannot lie promised before the world began.

466
00:18:55,139 --> 00:18:56,260
God can't lie.

467
00:18:57,219 --> 00:19:00,339
God said, for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord

468
00:19:01,179 --> 00:19:03,139
shall be saved.

469
00:19:03,139 --> 00:19:04,579
That's a precious promise.

470
00:19:04,579 --> 00:19:06,099
We can stand with authority.

471
00:19:06,099 --> 00:19:09,619
You ever talk to somebody that's doubted their salvation?

472
00:19:09,619 --> 00:19:10,659
I have.

473
00:19:10,659 --> 00:19:12,419
Maybe you at some point in your life

474
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:14,179
have doubted your salvation.

475
00:19:14,179 --> 00:19:17,859
And I do not minimize when someone doubts their salvation.

476
00:19:17,859 --> 00:19:19,820
I understand the seriousness of it.

477
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,899
I understand the complication that someone deals with

478
00:19:22,899 --> 00:19:24,260
when they have that doubt.

479
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:27,419
I understand how the enemy works and uses doubt

480
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:31,339
to really hinder the effectiveness of the child of God.

481
00:19:31,339 --> 00:19:32,179
Why?

482
00:19:32,179 --> 00:19:33,500
Because if you're doubting your salvation,

483
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:37,899
if you're not confident and certain of your own security,

484
00:19:37,899 --> 00:19:39,099
your own salvation,

485
00:19:39,099 --> 00:19:40,899
you're gonna have a hard time telling other people

486
00:19:40,899 --> 00:19:42,059
how they can be saved.

487
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:45,339
Because you yourself are doubting and you're struggling

488
00:19:45,339 --> 00:19:46,659
and you're not certain.

489
00:19:46,659 --> 00:19:48,260
And we find that many,

490
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:51,979
it is a tool that the enemy uses regularly from his toolbox

491
00:19:51,979 --> 00:19:53,699
in the lives of God's people

492
00:19:53,699 --> 00:19:56,659
is to cause them to doubt their salvation.

493
00:19:56,659 --> 00:20:00,099
And I do not minimize those that would struggle with.

494
00:20:00,099 --> 00:20:04,899
With that, there's a number of verses that God gives us that teach eternal security very

495
00:20:04,899 --> 00:20:07,699
clearly and plainly and we rejoice in them.

496
00:20:07,699 --> 00:20:14,779
And I've often said to people, listen, either you didn't call or you don't believe God.

497
00:20:14,779 --> 00:20:18,899
And really it just boils down to that because God said, for whosoever shall call upon the

498
00:20:18,899 --> 00:20:23,699
name of the Lord shall be saved.

499
00:20:23,699 --> 00:20:25,779
God is not a man that he should lie.

500
00:20:25,779 --> 00:20:28,179
God always does what he says he will do.

501
00:20:28,179 --> 00:20:32,499
And if you called on him, believing on him, then he saved you.

502
00:20:32,499 --> 00:20:39,419
The Bible says, my sheep hear my voice and I know them and I give unto them eternal life

503
00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:40,619
and they shall never perish.

504
00:20:40,619 --> 00:20:43,299
Isn't that precious in John 10?

505
00:20:43,299 --> 00:20:48,339
We find in the book of 2 Peter, the Bible says that we're kept by the power of God in

506
00:20:48,339 --> 00:20:55,019
the first chapter and we have an inheritance that's incorruptible, it's undefiled, it

507
00:20:55,019 --> 00:20:56,739
fadeth not away.

508
00:20:56,739 --> 00:21:00,259
It is reserved in heaven for us.

509
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,899
Hallelujah.

510
00:21:01,899 --> 00:21:06,899
It's a precious promise that God gives us in Romans 10 and verse number 13.

511
00:21:06,899 --> 00:21:13,479
But I want you to see not only the precious promise, but we see four piercing questions.

512
00:21:13,479 --> 00:21:16,539
Number two this evening, four piercing questions.

513
00:21:16,539 --> 00:21:19,019
I'm going to deal with them in reverse order tonight.

514
00:21:19,019 --> 00:21:23,779
I'm going to begin with the question that is asked in verse 15 and then we'll go back

515
00:21:23,779 --> 00:21:26,299
and answer the questions in verse 14.

516
00:21:26,299 --> 00:21:31,859
We've read it already this evening from verse 13 through 17, but if we look at these four

517
00:21:31,859 --> 00:21:35,979
piercing questions, I want you to notice how verse number 15 begins.

518
00:21:35,979 --> 00:21:43,219
The Bible says, and how shall they preach except they be sent?

519
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:47,619
We have an opportunity to support missions and to be involved in world missions.

520
00:21:47,619 --> 00:21:54,079
What we're doing is we're investing in, we're giving to missionaries so that they can be

521
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:57,079
sent to the foreign field.

522
00:21:57,079 --> 00:21:58,479
They're being sent with a mission.

523
00:21:58,479 --> 00:22:00,319
They're being sent with a purpose.

524
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:05,939
We are very careful as we vet missionaries and have an understanding of what their ministry

525
00:22:05,939 --> 00:22:07,119
plans are.

526
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:13,159
I get phone calls and emails regularly from missionaries that never come and present their

527
00:22:13,159 --> 00:22:14,759
ministry to our church.

528
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:15,759
Why?

529
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:22,999
Because they're not doing what I believe biblically missions that we would support are to be doing.

530
00:22:22,999 --> 00:22:26,959
And so we find that there's a process that we go through in vetting missionaries so that

531
00:22:26,959 --> 00:22:32,039
we can understand that this is, we're investing in, we're giving so that they can be sent.

532
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:37,559
Do you know there's a number of countries around the world that as a missionary family,

533
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:41,839
if you were to go to that country, first of all, there's a lot of process that you have

534
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:48,719
to go through, but many of them require that you would be able to show them financially

535
00:22:48,719 --> 00:22:54,679
that you can enter into that country and not take of the resources of that country.

536
00:22:54,679 --> 00:22:57,999
You're not, not just that you're going to get handouts, but you're not even going to

537
00:22:57,999 --> 00:23:04,039
go and get a job in that country because they want a national from their country to be able

538
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:05,039
to have that job.

539
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,839
They don't want you coming and taking their jobs.

540
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:09,479
That's regular around the world.

541
00:23:09,479 --> 00:23:12,559
I know it's not like that in America, but it's like that around the world.

542
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,479
It really is.

543
00:23:14,479 --> 00:23:16,359
And here's what I say.

544
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:24,039
These missionaries, they can't go if they don't have finances.

545
00:23:24,039 --> 00:23:26,639
God places a call on their life.

546
00:23:26,639 --> 00:23:28,399
They surrender to that call.

547
00:23:28,399 --> 00:23:32,479
We read in Isaiah where God says, who will go for us?

548
00:23:32,479 --> 00:23:35,999
And Isaiah says, here am I, Lord, send me.

549
00:23:35,999 --> 00:23:41,319
And we have missionaries that are saying, I've answered the call, I'm ready to be sent,

550
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:43,999
and they need resources.

551
00:23:43,999 --> 00:23:49,519
How shall they preach except they be sent?

552
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:56,359
The model that we have adopted in our independent Baptist churches is that these missionaries

553
00:23:56,359 --> 00:24:02,239
receive support from a number of churches, often somewhere to 80 to 100 different supporting

554
00:24:02,239 --> 00:24:04,399
churches.

555
00:24:04,399 --> 00:24:09,099
They travel on deputation, they present their ministry, a church like ours votes to pick

556
00:24:09,099 --> 00:24:11,239
them up for support.

557
00:24:11,239 --> 00:24:15,519
And we have one piece of the pie that gets the missionary to the field.

558
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:18,719
How shall they preach except they be sent?

559
00:24:18,719 --> 00:24:23,939
Notice in verse number 14, the Bible begins to ask these questions, of course, leading

560
00:24:23,939 --> 00:24:27,279
back to the promise, that precious promise of verse 13.

561
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:31,599
But the last question in verse 14, the first that we'll deal with, is this, how shall they

562
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:35,319
hear without a preacher?

563
00:24:35,319 --> 00:24:38,719
I don't know if you've ever been in a place, I don't know if you've ever been aware of

564
00:24:38,719 --> 00:24:43,779
someone that's been in a place where there's no gospel presence.

565
00:24:43,779 --> 00:24:49,759
In other words, there's a place that is void of Bible preaching, a place where there's

566
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:53,479
no gospel message that's being proclaimed.

567
00:24:53,479 --> 00:24:59,519
There's no church, there's no missionary, it's a dark place.

568
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:02,239
There are places like that around the world.

569
00:25:02,239 --> 00:25:07,999
And we find that the Bible says, how shall they hear without a preacher?

570
00:25:07,999 --> 00:25:11,039
How shall they preach except they be sent?

571
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,359
So we want to send the preachers, why?

572
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:18,079
Because how shall they hear without a preacher?

573
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:26,639
If we never take the important step of verse number 15 of sending a missionary, a preacher,

574
00:25:26,639 --> 00:25:31,719
then the person that's in that place that is void of the gospel, that is dark, that

575
00:25:31,719 --> 00:25:38,399
has no presence of a church or a missionary, how are they going to hear?

576
00:25:38,399 --> 00:25:44,519
You know, it's amazing to me how many places around the world do not have a true gospel

577
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:50,099
witness but, oh, there are so many false teachers in those places.

578
00:25:50,099 --> 00:25:54,399
It's heartbreaking.

579
00:25:54,399 --> 00:26:05,559
The cults that we're familiar with, often you can find them almost anywhere in the world.

580
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:08,399
I remember going to villages while I was in Mexico.

581
00:26:08,399 --> 00:26:13,319
My brother Lacey Wheeler would say, as we'd go to a particular village, now as far as

582
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:17,919
we know, as far as any missionary here in Mexico that I'm a friend with, that I've talked

583
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:23,579
to, as far as we know, there's never been a church that preaches the gospel in these

584
00:26:23,579 --> 00:26:25,859
particular villages.

585
00:26:25,859 --> 00:26:32,979
Hundreds, thousands of people that do not have an opportunity to hear because there's

586
00:26:32,979 --> 00:26:34,979
no preacher.

587
00:26:34,979 --> 00:26:35,979
I showed you pictures.

588
00:26:35,979 --> 00:26:40,179
I could still show them this evening if you had interest in seeing them, but I showed

589
00:26:40,179 --> 00:26:46,779
you in a particular village, El Rodeo was the name of the village that we went to, and

590
00:26:46,779 --> 00:26:51,539
in that particular village there was no gospel presence but there was a Coca-Cola distribution

591
00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:53,819
plant.

592
00:26:53,819 --> 00:27:02,019
And I had remembered reading years ago at the time the CEO of Coca-Cola made the statement

593
00:27:02,019 --> 00:27:09,079
that he had a vision that every living soul on the planet Earth would know the refreshing

594
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:11,979
taste of a Coca-Cola.

595
00:27:11,979 --> 00:27:14,699
That was the vision of the CEO of Coca-Cola.

596
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:16,659
I saw it in print form.

597
00:27:16,659 --> 00:27:21,379
It's probably 25 years ago at this point that I read that.

598
00:27:22,219 --> 00:27:27,659
When I got to that village, I saw firsthand how there's no gospel presence but there's

599
00:27:27,659 --> 00:27:28,659
Coca-Cola.

600
00:27:28,659 --> 00:27:31,019
Isn't that sad?

601
00:27:31,019 --> 00:27:34,379
How shall they hear without a preacher?

602
00:27:34,379 --> 00:27:38,459
Second question in verse number 14, going of course backwards again, it says here, how

603
00:27:38,459 --> 00:27:44,579
shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard?

604
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:49,139
Well obviously you can't believe in Him of whom you've not heard.

605
00:27:49,139 --> 00:27:52,919
How shall you hear without a preacher?

606
00:27:52,919 --> 00:28:00,179
But if belief is necessary and there's no way, how can you believe in Him of whom you've

607
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:03,179
not heard?

608
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:12,219
And verse 14 says this, how then shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed?

609
00:28:12,219 --> 00:28:17,479
As we look at the precious promise of verse 13 and we think about these four piercing

610
00:28:17,479 --> 00:28:24,919
questions of verses 14 and 15, we find that the Bible says, for whosoever shall call upon

611
00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:27,999
the name of the Lord shall be saved.

612
00:28:27,999 --> 00:28:33,880
But then the Bible says, how shall they call, how then shall they call on Him in whom they

613
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,880
have not believed?

614
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:39,639
How shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard?

615
00:28:39,639 --> 00:28:42,719
And how shall they hear without a preacher?

616
00:28:42,719 --> 00:28:46,839
How shall they preach except they be sent?

617
00:28:46,839 --> 00:28:49,399
Why missions?

618
00:28:49,399 --> 00:28:57,159
Well because there are billions of people in this world and a large majority of them

619
00:28:57,159 --> 00:28:59,759
are not saved.

620
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:04,359
It's staggering to think about the number of people in this world that have never even

621
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:10,679
heard the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ one time.

622
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:17,159
We used to think that often that was the case of various far-reaching places in the

623
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:18,159
world.

624
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:21,359
But you know we're finding it to be more and more common here in the United States

625
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:24,399
of America.

626
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:28,039
It's sad to me the number of young people that are growing up that the only reference

627
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:32,440
that they have to Jesus is as a curse word.

628
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,599
That's shameful.

629
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:37,119
It's sad.

630
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:42,919
Verse 17 is a precious verse of scripture, so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing

631
00:29:42,919 --> 00:29:44,399
by the word of God.

632
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:46,679
Yes, the truth is there in verse 16.

633
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:48,319
They have not all obeyed the gospel.

634
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:50,239
Have you found it to be so?

635
00:29:50,239 --> 00:29:51,239
Not everyone's going to hear the gospel.

636
00:29:51,239 --> 00:29:52,239
Not everyone's going to believe.

637
00:29:52,239 --> 00:29:55,599
There are people that reject.

638
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:59,519
We just move on and we just go on to the next place and the next person.

639
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:05,659
And so as we think about the subject of missions and we understand tonight the focus of our

640
00:30:05,659 --> 00:30:09,959
church and I think every once in a while, yes, we have a missions conference during

641
00:30:09,959 --> 00:30:16,279
the year and we have guest speakers that come and will challenge us, but it's important

642
00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:22,439
for me to be able to cast some vision, if you will, and to help you understand and obviously

643
00:30:22,439 --> 00:30:26,819
those that have been here for a long time, you have a greater understanding.

644
00:30:26,819 --> 00:30:31,299
Those that would be a little newer to the ministry, it's good for you to understand

645
00:30:31,299 --> 00:30:37,419
the emphasis and the importance and why, why missions.

646
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:45,019
I wonder this evening, if you ever think about how the gospel got to you.

647
00:30:45,019 --> 00:30:49,259
I wonder this evening, you know, it'd be easy for us to say, I think of Holly, she was born

648
00:30:49,259 --> 00:30:50,259
in a Christian home.

649
00:30:50,259 --> 00:30:55,099
Her parents were both saved when she got, when she was born, they were saved.

650
00:30:55,099 --> 00:30:59,419
Her dad was employed at the church, he was an assistant pastor, school administrator

651
00:30:59,419 --> 00:31:01,159
when she was born.

652
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:05,059
She was born in church, but you know, Holly still had to get saved, she had to be born

653
00:31:05,059 --> 00:31:08,539
again and she got saved, a little girl, what a blessing that is.

654
00:31:08,539 --> 00:31:10,899
My parents weren't saved when I was born.

655
00:31:10,899 --> 00:31:13,779
I was a teenager when my parents got saved.

656
00:31:13,779 --> 00:31:19,499
To God be the glory that there was a man that shared the gospel, that was faithful.

657
00:31:19,499 --> 00:31:23,499
But you know, the reality is that Holly's story might be different than my story, might

658
00:31:23,499 --> 00:31:27,659
be different than your story, but there was someone that brought the gospel to her mom

659
00:31:27,659 --> 00:31:30,619
or to her dad or to her grandparents.

660
00:31:30,619 --> 00:31:35,699
Somewhere along the line, someone brought the gospel to her family.

661
00:31:35,699 --> 00:31:37,899
The same is true in your family.

662
00:31:37,899 --> 00:31:43,099
And I wonder this evening how often we thank God for some faithful people that went before

663
00:31:43,099 --> 00:31:46,339
us so that we could hear the gospel.

664
00:31:46,339 --> 00:31:50,819
They took the baton that was given to them and they were obedient and faithful to take

665
00:31:50,899 --> 00:31:54,939
the gospel message and now here we are and we have the opportunity.

666
00:31:54,939 --> 00:31:59,059
We've been saved by the grace of God.

667
00:31:59,059 --> 00:32:03,299
We say this is a privilege, this is an opportunity for us to be involved in missions.

668
00:32:03,299 --> 00:32:11,219
Yes, actively involved in reaching our Jerusalem as God has placed us here as a lighthouse

669
00:32:11,219 --> 00:32:17,059
to reach this community, but at the very same time to reach the world with the gospel.

670
00:32:17,059 --> 00:32:19,699
It's not going to happen on accident.

671
00:32:19,699 --> 00:32:20,699
We've got to be purposed.

672
00:32:20,699 --> 00:32:22,939
We have to be purposed in doing it.

673
00:32:22,939 --> 00:32:27,939
We have to understand when we fill out that check, when we fill out that offering envelope,

674
00:32:27,939 --> 00:32:33,299
it's not just a, I hope, and I know sometimes I said it already, that so often in 2024,

675
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:37,579
we don't give out of our poverty, we give out of our abundance.

676
00:32:37,579 --> 00:32:42,619
And I'm not being, I'm not trying to criticize anyone, I'm in the same boat.

677
00:32:42,619 --> 00:32:47,259
What I'm saying this evening is that it's not just a budget line item, can I use that

678
00:32:47,259 --> 00:32:49,259
terminology this evening?

679
00:32:49,819 --> 00:32:53,939
It's an investment in eternity, souls.

680
00:32:53,939 --> 00:32:58,459
How shall they call on Him in whom they've not believed?

681
00:32:58,459 --> 00:33:03,779
How shall they believe in Him of whom they've not heard?

682
00:33:03,779 --> 00:33:07,899
How shall they hear without a preacher?

683
00:33:07,899 --> 00:33:12,219
How shall they preach except they be sent?

684
00:33:12,219 --> 00:33:19,539
God, that He would put us in a position of being the ones doing the sending and not waiting

685
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:22,419
for someone to come.

686
00:33:22,419 --> 00:33:23,419
Can you imagine?

687
00:33:23,419 --> 00:33:31,779
Can you imagine being somewhere and maybe just looking up and recognizing maybe in a

688
00:33:31,779 --> 00:33:41,939
place where there's polytheistic worldview, all sorts of false gods, but deep down is

689
00:33:42,099 --> 00:33:46,899
the Bible says the heavens declare the glory of God and you look and you, there's got to

690
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:52,979
be something, someone, but there's no one there to give you the truth.

691
00:33:52,979 --> 00:33:57,739
And I'm thankful that God's allowed us to be on this side of the equation, if I could

692
00:33:57,739 --> 00:34:06,619
use that terminology, but we must recognize how indebted we are to give the gospel to

693
00:34:06,619 --> 00:34:10,139
a lost and dying world and to be involved in world missions.

694
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:13,619
I love the fact that the children sang this morning.

695
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:18,419
They quoted Romans 1 in verse 16, for I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Christ.

696
00:34:18,419 --> 00:34:23,379
If you look in the context in verse 14 and 15, before you get to verse 16, there's three

697
00:34:23,379 --> 00:34:24,659
statements that Paul makes.

698
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:30,179
He says I am ready in verse 16, but he also says I am, or I'm not ashamed in verse 16,

699
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:33,019
but he says I am ready and I am debtor.

700
00:34:33,019 --> 00:34:34,739
I am debtor.

701
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:39,819
Paul understood the responsibility that God had given him.

702
00:34:39,819 --> 00:34:46,059
They sang that song and they talked about yellow and that crayon box, and yellow represents

703
00:34:46,059 --> 00:34:47,059
the Christian.

704
00:34:47,059 --> 00:34:49,459
Some of these little kids helped me.

705
00:34:49,459 --> 00:34:50,459
What does it represent?

706
00:34:50,459 --> 00:34:53,299
The Christian who is what?

707
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:56,779
Afraid or ashamed to tell.

708
00:34:56,779 --> 00:35:03,739
I love how they got quiet there on that last little stanza repeat of the chorus and challenged

709
00:35:03,739 --> 00:35:12,219
us a, don't be, don't be a Christian that's yellow, that's ashamed.

710
00:35:12,219 --> 00:35:13,219
Why missions?

711
00:35:13,219 --> 00:35:18,619
A mission is a heartbeat of God, it's the lifeblood of any local church.

712
00:35:18,619 --> 00:35:22,339
You kill missions, really you kind of lose your whole focus.

713
00:35:22,339 --> 00:35:27,579
I've heard preachers say finances are tight, we need to get rid of our missionaries.

714
00:35:27,579 --> 00:35:30,779
I say that is such a wrong perspective.

715
00:35:30,819 --> 00:35:36,419
I heard a missionary say once that their pastor said finances are tight, we better pick up

716
00:35:36,419 --> 00:35:38,899
a new missionary, and I say I like it.

717
00:35:38,899 --> 00:35:39,899
Why?

718
00:35:39,899 --> 00:35:44,579
Because you're doing what God wants you to do, you're proving God, and I'm thankful that

719
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:47,819
God's given us the opportunity to be involved in world missions.

720
00:35:47,819 --> 00:35:48,819
Let's pray.

721
00:35:48,819 --> 00:35:50,859
Father, we love you.

722
00:35:50,859 --> 00:35:51,959
We thank you for loving us.

723
00:35:51,959 --> 00:35:55,179
We thank you for the privilege of being able to serve you.

724
00:35:55,179 --> 00:36:01,899
And thank you for those that have gone before us that have faithfully proclaimed the gospel

725
00:36:01,899 --> 00:36:09,779
message, those that brought the gospel to us personally or to our families.

726
00:36:09,779 --> 00:36:14,979
God I pray that you'd help us to have our focus aligned biblically.

727
00:36:14,979 --> 00:36:21,979
Lord, that we would give, that we'd pray, that we'd be involved.

728
00:36:21,979 --> 00:36:25,819
Lord I pray that you'd just do a work in our lives.

729
00:36:25,819 --> 00:36:29,299
Encourage us, challenge us.

730
00:36:29,299 --> 00:36:31,539
We'll give you the glory for every decision that's made.

731
00:36:31,539 --> 00:36:32,859
For it's in Christ's name we pray.
