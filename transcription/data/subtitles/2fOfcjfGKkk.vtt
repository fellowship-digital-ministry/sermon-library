WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440
10 this evening, plan to preach a little bit shorter

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.780
this evening at the end of the invitation tonight.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.039
We have a couple of update videos

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:09.760
that we're gonna watch from our missionaries.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.640
We've gotten a couple of updates recently

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.560
from missionaries via video,

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.559
and I always like to be able to show those to you

00:00:16.559 --> 00:00:18.959
so that you can see what God is doing

00:00:18.959 --> 00:00:20.700
and how God is working.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.520
And we'd gotten a couple right at the same time,

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.860
and I was just praying about when to show those.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.680
Sometimes we show them on a Wednesday evening,

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.760
but of course, several folks aren't here

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.299
with student ministries and other things going on.

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:36.720
And the Lord laid this passage of scripture

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.599
upon my heart for this week, for tonight,

00:00:39.599 --> 00:00:41.680
and to show these videos.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.200
In Romans 10 is a familiar passage of scripture.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.240
We think about missions.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.880
I've titled the message tonight, Why Missions?

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.159
And really, the thought of the songs

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:54.400
that we've had the opportunity to sing tonight about heaven,

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.119
well, that's a good reason to answer the question,

00:00:57.119 --> 00:01:00.159
why missions, because eternity is certain,

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:01.799
and people are gonna die,

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:04.480
and people are gonna spend eternity in either heaven

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.839
or the lake of fire, and we have the truth.

00:01:06.839 --> 00:01:10.239
We have the opportunity to take the message of the gospel

00:01:10.239 --> 00:01:12.319
to a lost and dying world.

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:14.519
If you've been around Fellowship Baptist Church

00:01:14.519 --> 00:01:15.879
for any period of time,

00:01:15.879 --> 00:01:18.879
you know that world missions is a priority.

00:01:18.879 --> 00:01:20.500
A number of years ago, in fact,

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.360
the first calendar year that I was here as the pastor,

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.000
I worked with Brother Doug Cook about an idea

00:01:27.839 --> 00:01:29.440
in order to put a map in our sanctuary

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.879
that would give us an idea of missions

00:01:31.879 --> 00:01:34.080
that would say, as you walk in,

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.220
it would just kinda scream for your attention.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.519
All of you are looking over there,

00:01:37.519 --> 00:01:39.599
even as I'm talking about it,

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:42.720
because what happens is you walk into this sanctuary,

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.319
and you have immediately,

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:46.379
your eyes are drawn to a couple of things,

00:01:46.379 --> 00:01:49.139
the pulpit area, by the way, that's on purpose,

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:52.440
but also to the map on the wall,

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.339
and over here, send the light with another map of the world.

00:01:55.339 --> 00:01:58.260
That's our duty, that's our mission,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.500
and we began to talk about

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.300
how we could do something like this.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.819
I had a lot of ideas,

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:05.779
and knew where to buy a lot of things

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:07.419
from my days in the corporate world,

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:10.300
but the ability to put all of that together,

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.419
well, God allowed Doug Cook to be here

00:02:12.419 --> 00:02:13.740
and to have that ability,

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.520
and he worked, and several of our men

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.979
would go over to his house regularly

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:21.660
as they worked on this project,

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.380
and still today, I hear many people,

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.460
in fact, I think Mimi last Sunday night,

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:27.860
we had some visitors, and she said,

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.220
do you see our missions map?

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.100
And she takes them over there to show them our missions map.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.139
Every time we have a missionary that comes,

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:36.380
we have the opportunity to show them our missions map,

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:37.779
and to show them how it lights up,

00:02:37.779 --> 00:02:42.660
and give us that indication of where we have representation,

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.380
and where we do not have representation,

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.220
and missions is a priority,

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.919
and I'm thankful for that.

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:51.899
We make every effort, I make every effort

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:54.539
to ensure that you're provided with updates,

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:56.380
and that you have an opportunity

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.300
to be able to pray effectively and intelligently

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.000
for our missionaries.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.820
How can you pray for them intelligently

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.020
if you don't know what their needs are,

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.740
if you're not receiving updates,

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.059
and so missionaries provide updates at various times.

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:13.899
Some people, some missionaries provide updates every month,

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:15.279
some every other month.

00:03:15.279 --> 00:03:18.020
We require no less than one a quarter,

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.619
and we have the opportunity to get those update letters,

00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:23.179
and we seek to provide you with those updates

00:03:23.179 --> 00:03:25.940
Wednesday evenings on the back of our prayer bulletin,

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.300
three or four a week that we give you,

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.259
and Sunday mornings, we have a missions moment

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:32.839
in our Sunday morning service,

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:35.179
so that we can bring an update to you.

00:03:35.179 --> 00:03:36.660
The young men have been helping,

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.139
I've done some of those,

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:41.479
and Joseph and Tim have been helping with that,

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:44.020
getting them some opportunity to serve,

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.740
and we have an opportunity to have a directory.

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.020
It's amazing to me, especially with,

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.539
I think of Brother Scott Cottle and others

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:53.860
that have come and seen our missionary directory,

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.419
and they say, man, can I take one of these?

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:58.220
This is phenomenal, this is a great tool,

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.619
and we wanna keep that in front of you, why?

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:02.860
Because missions is important.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.520
Missions is a priority,

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.740
and we encourage you regularly to give to missions.

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:10.479
Why do we encourage you to give to missions?

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:13.520
Well, because it is our privilege

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.179
to be able to give of our resources

00:04:16.179 --> 00:04:18.040
that God blesses us with,

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.480
not just to give a tithe and an offering

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.940
to the local church,

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.160
but to designate and give toward missions,

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.119
toward world missions, why?

00:04:27.119 --> 00:04:29.040
So that we can support all those missionaries,

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.059
so that the gospel can go forward.

00:04:31.059 --> 00:04:34.559
We have on our weekly offering envelopes,

00:04:34.559 --> 00:04:36.040
there's only two categories,

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.119
and one is general offering, tithe and offering,

00:04:39.119 --> 00:04:40.880
and one is missions.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.799
I'm thankful that when I first got saved,

00:04:43.799 --> 00:04:47.359
someone challenged me with regard to missions giving,

00:04:47.359 --> 00:04:50.079
and I've had people ask me over the years,

00:04:50.079 --> 00:04:51.880
how do you determine your missions giving,

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.339
and so on and so forth.

00:04:53.339 --> 00:04:55.119
I don't think there's a magic formula.

00:04:55.119 --> 00:04:57.559
I do know that it's not part of your tithe.

00:04:57.559 --> 00:04:59.440
I know that the tithe is one thing,

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.559
and missions is a different thing,

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:04.359
and to be able to give to missions, what a blessing,

00:05:04.359 --> 00:05:06.019
and for all these years,

00:05:06.019 --> 00:05:07.600
Holly and I have had the opportunity

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.359
to give personally to missions.

00:05:09.359 --> 00:05:11.739
I don't just encourage our church family

00:05:11.739 --> 00:05:14.160
to give to missions, but I, we participate,

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.359
we give to missions, why?

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:19.720
Because we're investing in eternity.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.200
We're investing in eternity.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.239
Missions, I believe, is the heartbeat of God.

00:05:24.239 --> 00:05:25.200
I really do.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.519
For God so loved the world

00:05:26.519 --> 00:05:30.420
that he gave his only begotten son, right?

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:33.799
He sent the Lord Jesus Christ to this world.

00:05:33.799 --> 00:05:34.640
Why?

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:35.459
To save sinners.

00:05:35.459 --> 00:05:38.239
This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation

00:05:38.239 --> 00:05:40.019
that Christ Jesus came into the world

00:05:40.019 --> 00:05:40.859
for what purpose?

00:05:40.859 --> 00:05:43.399
To save sinners, 1 Timothy,

00:05:43.399 --> 00:05:46.279
and we find that missions is not only the heart of God,

00:05:47.079 --> 00:05:48.959
but it really should be the life of any local church,

00:05:48.959 --> 00:05:50.160
any New Testament church,

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.720
they should have a robust missions program,

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:57.399
and we ought to be mindful of our responsibility

00:05:57.399 --> 00:05:58.920
to reach our Jerusalem,

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.920
but at the same time reaching

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:05.079
to the uttermost part of the earth, the world.

00:06:05.079 --> 00:06:06.440
What an opportunity.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.119
I mentioned this morning in the book of Acts,

00:06:08.119 --> 00:06:10.760
the Bible says that the early church,

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.260
they filled Jerusalem with their doctrine,

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:14.839
but then we see also in the early church

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:18.440
that it said of them that they turned the world upside down.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.480
The known world received the gospel,

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.600
the missionary journeys that we read of

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:26.119
beginning in Acts 13 and how even in Acts 8,

00:06:26.119 --> 00:06:28.239
that they that were scattered from Jerusalem,

00:06:28.239 --> 00:06:30.200
they went everywhere preaching the word,

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:33.119
and how God was using his people

00:06:33.119 --> 00:06:35.920
to take the gospel message to the world,

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:40.119
and that still remains our responsibility to this very day.

00:06:40.119 --> 00:06:43.079
I say this to just simply say to God be the glory.

00:06:43.079 --> 00:06:45.040
I did a little research last week.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:45.880
Why?

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.299
Because we say that missions is a priority,

00:06:48.299 --> 00:06:51.239
but you know the reality is you can say anything you want.

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.160
You can say anything you want.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.380
I know church is the same mission is a priority,

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:57.959
but really it's not a priority,

00:06:57.959 --> 00:07:00.760
and I'm not casting stones, it's just the reality,

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:03.000
and as we say that missions is a priority,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.040
I did a little research,

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.519
and during the time that God has allowed me

00:07:06.519 --> 00:07:08.779
to be the pastor at Fellowship Baptist Church,

00:07:08.779 --> 00:07:13.619
almost 30% of our total income has gone to world missions.

00:07:13.619 --> 00:07:15.579
I say to God be the glory,

00:07:15.579 --> 00:07:19.100
and that's a phenomenal testimony of a church

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:23.420
that has a focus on reaching the world with the gospel,

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:25.500
and I praise the Lord for it.

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:27.779
This year, this calendar year,

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:32.179
if God would allow, if things would continue,

00:07:32.179 --> 00:07:35.220
and of course we're not presuming upon the Lord

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:38.339
or in anything else, but if things would continue,

00:07:38.899 --> 00:07:40.420
and at the close of this calendar year,

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:44.260
we will come very close to hitting or exceeding

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.540
one and a half million dollars of missions giving

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:49.859
through our church during my tenure,

00:07:49.859 --> 00:07:51.220
and I just praise the Lord for that.

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:53.019
I think to God be the glory.

00:07:53.019 --> 00:07:56.019
I've often been asked, and I'm at the age now

00:07:56.019 --> 00:07:58.660
where I'm really not an old man, praise the Lord for that,

00:07:58.660 --> 00:07:59.579
I'm still a young man,

00:07:59.579 --> 00:08:01.100
but I've been pastoring the same church

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:02.500
for 12 and a half years,

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:05.299
and so often I begin to get questions from other pastors,

00:08:05.299 --> 00:08:08.459
younger pastors or pastors that are going to a church

00:08:08.459 --> 00:08:09.739
and just kind of beginning,

00:08:09.739 --> 00:08:12.820
and they've asked questions about missions and what have you

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:16.019
and I regularly try to tell these pastors

00:08:16.019 --> 00:08:18.820
that if you wanna have a missions-minded church,

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:21.820
you need to place an emphasis on missions.

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:23.660
It's not gonna happen on accident,

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:25.660
and I appreciate your investment.

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:29.500
I appreciate the opportunity that we have corporately,

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:32.580
collectively to be involved in world missions.

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:33.500
Why missions?

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:36.780
We deal with the subject and we understand that missions,

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:39.979
as we give to missions, as we pray for missions,

00:08:39.979 --> 00:08:43.820
that we're making an investment in eternity.

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:45.580
We're making an investment in eternity.

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:48.799
You ever hear people talk about investing and investments

00:08:48.799 --> 00:08:50.900
and they have portfolios and all sorts of things

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:51.820
that they wanna give you,

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:55.780
and quite honestly, I'm readily admitting

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:59.059
that that is not my strong area, my strong suit,

00:08:59.059 --> 00:09:00.700
but there are some people that are very smart

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:02.979
and wise in that situation and what have you,

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:04.780
and they have people that you can talk to,

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:07.140
but I want you to understand that when you give to missions

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.780
that you're investing in eternity.

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:11.020
You're investing in eternity.

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:12.580
A missionary once said this,

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:15.159
and the returns are out of this world,

00:09:15.159 --> 00:09:17.059
and I understand what they meant by that,

00:09:17.059 --> 00:09:19.940
and I like the phraseology because so often

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:21.739
when you start talking about investments,

00:09:21.739 --> 00:09:23.719
what is the question you wanna have is,

00:09:23.719 --> 00:09:27.059
what is the return on my investment, ROI, right?

00:09:27.059 --> 00:09:29.979
What is my return on my investment?

00:09:29.979 --> 00:09:31.859
We've had, I don't know the numbers.

00:09:31.859 --> 00:09:34.140
It would be impossible for me

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:35.940
to be able to calculate the numbers

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:37.900
because of the number of missionaries that we have

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:40.359
and the way that the update letters come in,

00:09:40.359 --> 00:09:43.739
but hundreds, if not thousands of souls

00:09:43.739 --> 00:09:46.539
have been saved through our missions program

00:09:46.539 --> 00:09:49.979
as we have the opportunity to support these missionaries.

00:09:49.979 --> 00:09:50.900
Now think about that.

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:52.619
Paul says the church at Philippi

00:09:52.619 --> 00:09:54.260
in Philippians chapter number four

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.099
that this is fruit to your account,

00:09:57.099 --> 00:09:59.140
and God keeps record of that,

00:09:59.140 --> 00:09:59.979
and these missionaries,

00:09:59.979 --> 00:10:01.899
that we have the opportunity to support

00:10:01.899 --> 00:10:04.819
and we hear back from them of souls being saved

00:10:04.819 --> 00:10:09.059
and lives being changed and discipleship going forward,

00:10:09.059 --> 00:10:10.499
you have a part in that.

00:10:10.499 --> 00:10:11.619
If you're giving to missions,

00:10:11.619 --> 00:10:13.939
our church has a part in that, why?

00:10:13.939 --> 00:10:15.739
Because we support missions.

00:10:15.739 --> 00:10:17.719
And we want you as an individual,

00:10:17.719 --> 00:10:21.059
every individual to have a part in that, why?

00:10:21.059 --> 00:10:23.339
Because collectively we're making an investment,

00:10:23.339 --> 00:10:25.619
but it's made up of individuals

00:10:25.619 --> 00:10:28.019
that are giving and making that investment.

00:10:28.059 --> 00:10:31.099
Dozens of churches have been started.

00:10:31.099 --> 00:10:34.579
We can look at pictures over the years of empty fields

00:10:34.579 --> 00:10:37.619
where there was no church and now there's a church.

00:10:37.619 --> 00:10:40.319
We can look at pictures of storefront buildings

00:10:40.319 --> 00:10:43.019
where other establishments and businesses

00:10:43.019 --> 00:10:46.579
had their business in these particular locations

00:10:46.579 --> 00:10:50.079
and they were vacant and now there's a church in that place.

00:10:50.079 --> 00:10:53.819
We can think even most recently of a situation

00:10:53.819 --> 00:10:55.699
there in Belgium with the Haley family

00:10:55.699 --> 00:10:58.859
where a restaurant has been converted to a church

00:10:58.859 --> 00:11:00.899
and to God be the glory.

00:11:00.899 --> 00:11:03.659
That's exciting when you have the opportunity to see that

00:11:03.659 --> 00:11:05.659
and to think about the local church

00:11:05.659 --> 00:11:09.139
and what God intends for the church and what the church is.

00:11:09.139 --> 00:11:12.779
We've had the opportunity as we provide help

00:11:12.779 --> 00:11:13.919
with Beacon of Truth,

00:11:13.919 --> 00:11:17.559
not only in supporting that ministry financially,

00:11:17.559 --> 00:11:20.659
but also in putting Romans booklets together.

00:11:20.659 --> 00:11:22.379
I've said jokingly,

00:11:22.379 --> 00:11:24.899
but I think there's a measure of seriousness to it

00:11:24.899 --> 00:11:25.819
that if I ever said

00:11:25.819 --> 00:11:28.019
that we were gonna cancel scripture assembly

00:11:28.019 --> 00:11:29.399
and we're not gonna do it anymore,

00:11:29.399 --> 00:11:32.079
I'd get fired and you'd look for a new pastor.

00:11:32.079 --> 00:11:32.919
And why?

00:11:32.919 --> 00:11:35.259
Because you love that ministry.

00:11:35.259 --> 00:11:38.879
We've put over 400,000 Romans booklets together.

00:11:38.879 --> 00:11:42.299
We have, our church personally, we've done that.

00:11:42.299 --> 00:11:44.059
I mentioned it's fruit to our account.

00:11:44.059 --> 00:11:45.659
The Bible says you're there in Romans 10.

00:11:45.659 --> 00:11:47.179
We'll be there in just a moment.

00:11:47.179 --> 00:11:48.139
But in Philippians,

00:11:48.139 --> 00:11:49.799
I want you to see what Paul says

00:11:49.799 --> 00:11:51.459
about the church at Philippi

00:11:51.459 --> 00:11:55.579
and how he commends them here beginning

00:11:55.579 --> 00:11:58.979
in verse number 14 of Philippians chapter four.

00:11:58.979 --> 00:12:02.739
And what a blessing to think about the church at Philippi

00:12:02.739 --> 00:12:05.059
and the part that they had

00:12:05.059 --> 00:12:07.939
in helping the work of the ministry

00:12:07.939 --> 00:12:10.319
through their offering, through their contribution.

00:12:10.319 --> 00:12:11.159
It says in verse 14,

00:12:11.159 --> 00:12:14.919
notwithstanding ye have well done,

00:12:14.919 --> 00:12:17.839
that ye did communicate with my affliction.

00:12:17.839 --> 00:12:20.239
Now you Philippians know also

00:12:20.239 --> 00:12:21.839
that in the beginning of the gospel,

00:12:21.839 --> 00:12:23.599
when I departed from Macedonia,

00:12:23.599 --> 00:12:24.719
notice what he says,

00:12:24.719 --> 00:12:26.959
no church communicated with me

00:12:26.959 --> 00:12:29.799
as concerning giving and receiving.

00:12:29.799 --> 00:12:31.279
Notice those last three words,

00:12:31.279 --> 00:12:35.679
but ye only, but ye only.

00:12:35.679 --> 00:12:38.439
Aren't you thankful for the church at Philippi?

00:12:38.439 --> 00:12:39.259
Why?

00:12:39.259 --> 00:12:40.639
Because it enabled Paul to be able to go

00:12:40.639 --> 00:12:42.719
and to continue to preach the gospel message.

00:12:42.719 --> 00:12:44.599
Notice in verse 17,

00:12:44.599 --> 00:12:45.439
Paul says this,

00:12:45.439 --> 00:12:47.879
not because I desire a gift,

00:12:47.879 --> 00:12:52.879
but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.

00:12:53.119 --> 00:12:54.279
How does that work?

00:12:54.279 --> 00:12:56.159
I just trust God with it.

00:12:56.159 --> 00:12:57.439
I'm not sure how it all works.

00:12:57.439 --> 00:13:00.599
I'm not sure how God keeps account of all of that,

00:13:00.599 --> 00:13:02.319
but I know that God does.

00:13:02.319 --> 00:13:05.039
And I know that it's an investment in eternity.

00:13:05.039 --> 00:13:06.559
And we can trust that God,

00:13:06.559 --> 00:13:08.299
he'd do with all things well.

00:13:08.299 --> 00:13:09.399
In verse 18, he says,

00:13:09.399 --> 00:13:10.719
but I have all that abound.

00:13:10.719 --> 00:13:13.279
I am full having received of Epaphroditus,

00:13:13.279 --> 00:13:15.239
the things which were sent from you.

00:13:15.239 --> 00:13:17.039
And then notice how those things,

00:13:17.039 --> 00:13:19.679
that offering, how it's described,

00:13:19.679 --> 00:13:24.239
an odor of a sweet smell, a sacrifice,

00:13:24.239 --> 00:13:29.199
acceptable, well-pleasing to God.

00:13:29.199 --> 00:13:32.159
God was pleased with the church at Philippi

00:13:32.159 --> 00:13:35.519
because they gave, they gave regularly.

00:13:35.519 --> 00:13:37.599
And then the great promise that many of us

00:13:37.599 --> 00:13:38.919
are familiar with in verse 19,

00:13:38.919 --> 00:13:41.479
but my God shall supply all your need

00:13:41.479 --> 00:13:44.999
according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.

00:13:45.039 --> 00:13:48.079
And we read in the book of 2 Corinthians

00:13:48.079 --> 00:13:50.799
how that they gave out of their poverty

00:13:50.799 --> 00:13:53.839
and they were first willing to give of themselves.

00:13:53.839 --> 00:13:57.879
And quite honestly, I'm convicted as I read that truth

00:13:57.879 --> 00:14:00.939
in 2 Corinthians, when the Bible speaks about,

00:14:00.939 --> 00:14:02.679
as Paul is speaking to them about

00:14:02.679 --> 00:14:04.759
how they gave out of their poverty.

00:14:04.759 --> 00:14:07.119
And I begin to think about that

00:14:07.119 --> 00:14:09.479
and I begin to be challenged, why?

00:14:09.479 --> 00:14:12.959
Because so often here in 2024,

00:14:12.959 --> 00:14:15.799
most often we give out of our abundance,

00:14:15.799 --> 00:14:18.239
not out of our poverty.

00:14:19.319 --> 00:14:20.279
We really do.

00:14:23.559 --> 00:14:25.639
It's fruit to our account.

00:14:25.639 --> 00:14:27.879
It's a joy, I mentioned already,

00:14:27.879 --> 00:14:31.759
to personally be involved in giving to missions.

00:14:31.759 --> 00:14:34.979
It's a joy to know that as we give to Bible projects

00:14:34.979 --> 00:14:37.879
and we've given to Papua New Guinea Bible project,

00:14:37.879 --> 00:14:41.439
to Samoan Bible project, involved in other Bible projects

00:14:41.439 --> 00:14:43.519
as we send these Bibles around the world.

00:14:43.519 --> 00:14:44.959
But those two in particular,

00:14:44.959 --> 00:14:49.719
we had very specific designated campaigns, if you will,

00:14:49.719 --> 00:14:52.959
to raise funds for those Bibles.

00:14:52.959 --> 00:14:56.439
I'm thankful to have had a part, our family, your family,

00:14:56.439 --> 00:14:59.799
us as a church in knowing that there's some people

00:14:59.799 --> 00:15:01.039
on the other side of the world

00:15:01.039 --> 00:15:05.279
that can hold a Bible in their hand today because you gave.

00:15:05.279 --> 00:15:06.939
Isn't that amazing?

00:15:06.939 --> 00:15:09.119
It's absolutely phenomenal.

00:15:09.119 --> 00:15:11.119
This book, the Bible says in Psalm 119,

00:15:11.679 --> 00:15:13.839
the entrance of thy words giveth light.

00:15:13.839 --> 00:15:15.519
And what a joy and what a blessing.

00:15:15.519 --> 00:15:18.199
It's a blessing to be a pastor of a church

00:15:18.199 --> 00:15:20.339
with a heart for world missions.

00:15:20.339 --> 00:15:24.559
And I just thank you this evening for your part in missions.

00:15:24.559 --> 00:15:27.959
And it's not something that I obviously could do on my own.

00:15:27.959 --> 00:15:31.079
I try to cast the vision and try to encourage you

00:15:31.079 --> 00:15:34.319
and do all that I can to keep it before you.

00:15:34.319 --> 00:15:36.099
And I appreciate your response.

00:15:36.099 --> 00:15:38.359
I appreciate your sensitivity to the Lord.

00:15:38.399 --> 00:15:41.439
I appreciate the fact that when a missionary has a need

00:15:41.439 --> 00:15:44.479
that people are ready to help and do what we can

00:15:44.479 --> 00:15:46.519
to help with those missionaries.

00:15:46.519 --> 00:15:48.439
I appreciate how you pray for our missionaries.

00:15:48.439 --> 00:15:52.199
I appreciate the way in which you give and pray

00:15:52.199 --> 00:15:54.199
and support our missionaries.

00:15:54.199 --> 00:15:56.279
As we answer the question, why missions?

00:15:56.279 --> 00:15:57.959
We come to Romans 10.

00:15:57.959 --> 00:16:00.239
We'll look at just a few verses of scripture this evening.

00:16:00.239 --> 00:16:01.719
It's a passage of scripture

00:16:01.719 --> 00:16:04.119
that is quite familiar to many of us.

00:16:04.119 --> 00:16:07.039
In Romans chapter number 10, beginning in verse number 13,

00:16:07.039 --> 00:16:09.919
again, a verse that many of us could quote tonight.

00:16:09.919 --> 00:16:10.759
The Bible says,

00:16:10.759 --> 00:16:14.359
for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord

00:16:14.359 --> 00:16:17.119
shall be saved.

00:16:17.119 --> 00:16:19.719
Aren't you thankful for that Bible verse?

00:16:19.719 --> 00:16:23.259
For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord

00:16:23.259 --> 00:16:25.399
shall be saved.

00:16:25.399 --> 00:16:26.599
Verse 14 says this,

00:16:26.599 --> 00:16:29.959
how then shall they call on him

00:16:29.959 --> 00:16:32.639
in whom they have not believed?

00:16:32.639 --> 00:16:34.379
And how shall they believe in him

00:16:34.379 --> 00:16:36.479
of whom they have not heard?

00:16:36.479 --> 00:16:39.279
And how shall they hear without a preacher?

00:16:39.279 --> 00:16:43.439
And how shall they preach except they be sent?

00:16:43.439 --> 00:16:44.999
As it is written,

00:16:44.999 --> 00:16:46.619
how beautiful are the feet of them

00:16:46.619 --> 00:16:48.959
that preach the gospel of peace

00:16:48.959 --> 00:16:52.199
and bring glad tidings of good things.

00:16:52.199 --> 00:16:55.199
But they have not all obeyed the gospel.

00:16:55.199 --> 00:16:58.959
For Isaiah saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?

00:16:58.959 --> 00:17:01.239
So then faith cometh by hearing,

00:17:01.239 --> 00:17:03.619
and hearing by the word of God.

00:17:04.479 --> 00:17:06.319
As we look at this passage of scripture,

00:17:07.319 --> 00:17:08.279
if you're taking notes,

00:17:08.279 --> 00:17:09.279
just a couple of thoughts.

00:17:09.279 --> 00:17:12.719
Number one, we see that there's a precious promise.

00:17:12.719 --> 00:17:14.879
Verse 13 is a precious verse of scripture

00:17:14.879 --> 00:17:18.479
that I remember someone sharing with me many years ago.

00:17:18.479 --> 00:17:19.979
I remember many years ago,

00:17:19.979 --> 00:17:23.179
as I was not certain, of course, of my salvation,

00:17:23.179 --> 00:17:25.479
I did not know that heaven was my home.

00:17:25.479 --> 00:17:26.799
And someone took a Bible

00:17:26.799 --> 00:17:28.239
and showed me how I could know for sure

00:17:28.239 --> 00:17:29.519
that heaven was my home.

00:17:29.519 --> 00:17:30.879
And I remember that eventually

00:17:30.879 --> 00:17:32.959
he got into Romans 10 in verse number 13.

00:17:32.959 --> 00:17:35.619
And I can't tell you how many times over the years

00:17:35.619 --> 00:17:37.939
I've had the opportunity to speak with people

00:17:37.939 --> 00:17:40.499
about the gospel and to share the gospel

00:17:40.499 --> 00:17:43.059
of the Lord Jesus Christ with individuals,

00:17:43.059 --> 00:17:45.419
with groups of people in preaching services

00:17:45.419 --> 00:17:46.619
and so on and so forth,

00:17:46.619 --> 00:17:49.779
and use this verse of scripture to say to them,

00:17:49.779 --> 00:17:52.939
for whosoever, and I kind of pause there and say,

00:17:52.939 --> 00:17:54.539
you know, that means anybody.

00:17:54.539 --> 00:17:56.659
We could take and insert our name

00:17:56.659 --> 00:17:58.219
into that verse of scripture.

00:17:58.219 --> 00:18:00.099
And we can understand that the Bible

00:18:00.099 --> 00:18:02.059
gives this precious promise,

00:18:02.099 --> 00:18:06.179
for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord

00:18:06.179 --> 00:18:09.259
shall be saved.

00:18:09.259 --> 00:18:11.739
Man, I hope you never get over this precious promise

00:18:11.739 --> 00:18:14.219
of Romans 10 in verse number 13.

00:18:14.219 --> 00:18:17.499
The reality this evening is that God gives us a promise.

00:18:17.499 --> 00:18:19.219
He does not say that you might be saved.

00:18:19.219 --> 00:18:20.779
He does not say that you could be saved.

00:18:20.779 --> 00:18:24.739
He says that you shall be saved.

00:18:24.739 --> 00:18:28.339
The reality this evening is that God is not a man

00:18:28.339 --> 00:18:30.379
that he should lie, amen.

00:18:30.419 --> 00:18:32.380
Titus says it this way.

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:34.459
In Titus chapter number one,

00:18:34.459 --> 00:18:37.139
it's a precious truth that God gives us.

00:18:37.139 --> 00:18:38.059
In verse number three,

00:18:38.059 --> 00:18:40.779
but hath in due times manifested his word

00:18:41.859 --> 00:18:43.619
through preaching, which is committed unto me

00:18:43.619 --> 00:18:45.739
according to the commandment of our Savior,

00:18:45.739 --> 00:18:47.500
to God our Savior.

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:49.539
In verse number two, in hope of eternal life,

00:18:49.539 --> 00:18:54.539
which God that cannot lie promised before the world began.

00:18:55.139 --> 00:18:56.260
God can't lie.

00:18:57.219 --> 00:19:00.339
God said, for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord

00:19:01.179 --> 00:19:03.139
shall be saved.

00:19:03.139 --> 00:19:04.579
That's a precious promise.

00:19:04.579 --> 00:19:06.099
We can stand with authority.

00:19:06.099 --> 00:19:09.619
You ever talk to somebody that's doubted their salvation?

00:19:09.619 --> 00:19:10.659
I have.

00:19:10.659 --> 00:19:12.419
Maybe you at some point in your life

00:19:12.419 --> 00:19:14.179
have doubted your salvation.

00:19:14.179 --> 00:19:17.859
And I do not minimize when someone doubts their salvation.

00:19:17.859 --> 00:19:19.820
I understand the seriousness of it.

00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:22.899
I understand the complication that someone deals with

00:19:22.899 --> 00:19:24.260
when they have that doubt.

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:27.419
I understand how the enemy works and uses doubt

00:19:27.419 --> 00:19:31.339
to really hinder the effectiveness of the child of God.

00:19:31.339 --> 00:19:32.179
Why?

00:19:32.179 --> 00:19:33.500
Because if you're doubting your salvation,

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:37.899
if you're not confident and certain of your own security,

00:19:37.899 --> 00:19:39.099
your own salvation,

00:19:39.099 --> 00:19:40.899
you're gonna have a hard time telling other people

00:19:40.899 --> 00:19:42.059
how they can be saved.

00:19:43.099 --> 00:19:45.339
Because you yourself are doubting and you're struggling

00:19:45.339 --> 00:19:46.659
and you're not certain.

00:19:46.659 --> 00:19:48.260
And we find that many,

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:51.979
it is a tool that the enemy uses regularly from his toolbox

00:19:51.979 --> 00:19:53.699
in the lives of God's people

00:19:53.699 --> 00:19:56.659
is to cause them to doubt their salvation.

00:19:56.659 --> 00:20:00.099
And I do not minimize those that would struggle with.

00:20:00.099 --> 00:20:04.899
With that, there's a number of verses that God gives us that teach eternal security very

00:20:04.899 --> 00:20:07.699
clearly and plainly and we rejoice in them.

00:20:07.699 --> 00:20:14.779
And I've often said to people, listen, either you didn't call or you don't believe God.

00:20:14.779 --> 00:20:18.899
And really it just boils down to that because God said, for whosoever shall call upon the

00:20:18.899 --> 00:20:23.699
name of the Lord shall be saved.

00:20:23.699 --> 00:20:25.779
God is not a man that he should lie.

00:20:25.779 --> 00:20:28.179
God always does what he says he will do.

00:20:28.179 --> 00:20:32.499
And if you called on him, believing on him, then he saved you.

00:20:32.499 --> 00:20:39.419
The Bible says, my sheep hear my voice and I know them and I give unto them eternal life

00:20:39.419 --> 00:20:40.619
and they shall never perish.

00:20:40.619 --> 00:20:43.299
Isn't that precious in John 10?

00:20:43.299 --> 00:20:48.339
We find in the book of 2 Peter, the Bible says that we're kept by the power of God in

00:20:48.339 --> 00:20:55.019
the first chapter and we have an inheritance that's incorruptible, it's undefiled, it

00:20:55.019 --> 00:20:56.739
fadeth not away.

00:20:56.739 --> 00:21:00.259
It is reserved in heaven for us.

00:21:00.259 --> 00:21:01.899
Hallelujah.

00:21:01.899 --> 00:21:06.899
It's a precious promise that God gives us in Romans 10 and verse number 13.

00:21:06.899 --> 00:21:13.479
But I want you to see not only the precious promise, but we see four piercing questions.

00:21:13.479 --> 00:21:16.539
Number two this evening, four piercing questions.

00:21:16.539 --> 00:21:19.019
I'm going to deal with them in reverse order tonight.

00:21:19.019 --> 00:21:23.779
I'm going to begin with the question that is asked in verse 15 and then we'll go back

00:21:23.779 --> 00:21:26.299
and answer the questions in verse 14.

00:21:26.299 --> 00:21:31.859
We've read it already this evening from verse 13 through 17, but if we look at these four

00:21:31.859 --> 00:21:35.979
piercing questions, I want you to notice how verse number 15 begins.

00:21:35.979 --> 00:21:43.219
The Bible says, and how shall they preach except they be sent?

00:21:43.219 --> 00:21:47.619
We have an opportunity to support missions and to be involved in world missions.

00:21:47.619 --> 00:21:54.079
What we're doing is we're investing in, we're giving to missionaries so that they can be

00:21:54.079 --> 00:21:57.079
sent to the foreign field.

00:21:57.079 --> 00:21:58.479
They're being sent with a mission.

00:21:58.479 --> 00:22:00.319
They're being sent with a purpose.

00:22:00.319 --> 00:22:05.939
We are very careful as we vet missionaries and have an understanding of what their ministry

00:22:05.939 --> 00:22:07.119
plans are.

00:22:07.119 --> 00:22:13.159
I get phone calls and emails regularly from missionaries that never come and present their

00:22:13.159 --> 00:22:14.759
ministry to our church.

00:22:14.759 --> 00:22:15.759
Why?

00:22:15.759 --> 00:22:22.999
Because they're not doing what I believe biblically missions that we would support are to be doing.

00:22:22.999 --> 00:22:26.959
And so we find that there's a process that we go through in vetting missionaries so that

00:22:26.959 --> 00:22:32.039
we can understand that this is, we're investing in, we're giving so that they can be sent.

00:22:32.039 --> 00:22:37.559
Do you know there's a number of countries around the world that as a missionary family,

00:22:37.559 --> 00:22:41.839
if you were to go to that country, first of all, there's a lot of process that you have

00:22:41.839 --> 00:22:48.719
to go through, but many of them require that you would be able to show them financially

00:22:48.719 --> 00:22:54.679
that you can enter into that country and not take of the resources of that country.

00:22:54.679 --> 00:22:57.999
You're not, not just that you're going to get handouts, but you're not even going to

00:22:57.999 --> 00:23:04.039
go and get a job in that country because they want a national from their country to be able

00:23:04.039 --> 00:23:05.039
to have that job.

00:23:05.039 --> 00:23:07.839
They don't want you coming and taking their jobs.

00:23:07.839 --> 00:23:09.479
That's regular around the world.

00:23:09.479 --> 00:23:12.559
I know it's not like that in America, but it's like that around the world.

00:23:12.559 --> 00:23:14.479
It really is.

00:23:14.479 --> 00:23:16.359
And here's what I say.

00:23:16.359 --> 00:23:24.039
These missionaries, they can't go if they don't have finances.

00:23:24.039 --> 00:23:26.639
God places a call on their life.

00:23:26.639 --> 00:23:28.399
They surrender to that call.

00:23:28.399 --> 00:23:32.479
We read in Isaiah where God says, who will go for us?

00:23:32.479 --> 00:23:35.999
And Isaiah says, here am I, Lord, send me.

00:23:35.999 --> 00:23:41.319
And we have missionaries that are saying, I've answered the call, I'm ready to be sent,

00:23:41.319 --> 00:23:43.999
and they need resources.

00:23:43.999 --> 00:23:49.519
How shall they preach except they be sent?

00:23:49.519 --> 00:23:56.359
The model that we have adopted in our independent Baptist churches is that these missionaries

00:23:56.359 --> 00:24:02.239
receive support from a number of churches, often somewhere to 80 to 100 different supporting

00:24:02.239 --> 00:24:04.399
churches.

00:24:04.399 --> 00:24:09.099
They travel on deputation, they present their ministry, a church like ours votes to pick

00:24:09.099 --> 00:24:11.239
them up for support.

00:24:11.239 --> 00:24:15.519
And we have one piece of the pie that gets the missionary to the field.

00:24:15.519 --> 00:24:18.719
How shall they preach except they be sent?

00:24:18.719 --> 00:24:23.939
Notice in verse number 14, the Bible begins to ask these questions, of course, leading

00:24:23.939 --> 00:24:27.279
back to the promise, that precious promise of verse 13.

00:24:27.279 --> 00:24:31.599
But the last question in verse 14, the first that we'll deal with, is this, how shall they

00:24:31.599 --> 00:24:35.319
hear without a preacher?

00:24:35.319 --> 00:24:38.719
I don't know if you've ever been in a place, I don't know if you've ever been aware of

00:24:38.719 --> 00:24:43.779
someone that's been in a place where there's no gospel presence.

00:24:43.779 --> 00:24:49.759
In other words, there's a place that is void of Bible preaching, a place where there's

00:24:49.759 --> 00:24:53.479
no gospel message that's being proclaimed.

00:24:53.479 --> 00:24:59.519
There's no church, there's no missionary, it's a dark place.

00:24:59.519 --> 00:25:02.239
There are places like that around the world.

00:25:02.239 --> 00:25:07.999
And we find that the Bible says, how shall they hear without a preacher?

00:25:07.999 --> 00:25:11.039
How shall they preach except they be sent?

00:25:11.039 --> 00:25:13.359
So we want to send the preachers, why?

00:25:13.359 --> 00:25:18.079
Because how shall they hear without a preacher?

00:25:18.079 --> 00:25:26.639
If we never take the important step of verse number 15 of sending a missionary, a preacher,

00:25:26.639 --> 00:25:31.719
then the person that's in that place that is void of the gospel, that is dark, that

00:25:31.719 --> 00:25:38.399
has no presence of a church or a missionary, how are they going to hear?

00:25:38.399 --> 00:25:44.519
You know, it's amazing to me how many places around the world do not have a true gospel

00:25:44.519 --> 00:25:50.099
witness but, oh, there are so many false teachers in those places.

00:25:50.099 --> 00:25:54.399
It's heartbreaking.

00:25:54.399 --> 00:26:05.559
The cults that we're familiar with, often you can find them almost anywhere in the world.

00:26:05.559 --> 00:26:08.399
I remember going to villages while I was in Mexico.

00:26:08.399 --> 00:26:13.319
My brother Lacey Wheeler would say, as we'd go to a particular village, now as far as

00:26:13.319 --> 00:26:17.919
we know, as far as any missionary here in Mexico that I'm a friend with, that I've talked

00:26:17.919 --> 00:26:23.579
to, as far as we know, there's never been a church that preaches the gospel in these

00:26:23.579 --> 00:26:25.859
particular villages.

00:26:25.859 --> 00:26:32.979
Hundreds, thousands of people that do not have an opportunity to hear because there's

00:26:32.979 --> 00:26:34.979
no preacher.

00:26:34.979 --> 00:26:35.979
I showed you pictures.

00:26:35.979 --> 00:26:40.179
I could still show them this evening if you had interest in seeing them, but I showed

00:26:40.179 --> 00:26:46.779
you in a particular village, El Rodeo was the name of the village that we went to, and

00:26:46.779 --> 00:26:51.539
in that particular village there was no gospel presence but there was a Coca-Cola distribution

00:26:51.539 --> 00:26:53.819
plant.

00:26:53.819 --> 00:27:02.019
And I had remembered reading years ago at the time the CEO of Coca-Cola made the statement

00:27:02.019 --> 00:27:09.079
that he had a vision that every living soul on the planet Earth would know the refreshing

00:27:09.079 --> 00:27:11.979
taste of a Coca-Cola.

00:27:11.979 --> 00:27:14.699
That was the vision of the CEO of Coca-Cola.

00:27:14.699 --> 00:27:16.659
I saw it in print form.

00:27:16.659 --> 00:27:21.379
It's probably 25 years ago at this point that I read that.

00:27:22.219 --> 00:27:27.659
When I got to that village, I saw firsthand how there's no gospel presence but there's

00:27:27.659 --> 00:27:28.659
Coca-Cola.

00:27:28.659 --> 00:27:31.019
Isn't that sad?

00:27:31.019 --> 00:27:34.379
How shall they hear without a preacher?

00:27:34.379 --> 00:27:38.459
Second question in verse number 14, going of course backwards again, it says here, how

00:27:38.459 --> 00:27:44.579
shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard?

00:27:44.579 --> 00:27:49.139
Well obviously you can't believe in Him of whom you've not heard.

00:27:49.139 --> 00:27:52.919
How shall you hear without a preacher?

00:27:52.919 --> 00:28:00.179
But if belief is necessary and there's no way, how can you believe in Him of whom you've

00:28:00.179 --> 00:28:03.179
not heard?

00:28:03.179 --> 00:28:12.219
And verse 14 says this, how then shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed?

00:28:12.219 --> 00:28:17.479
As we look at the precious promise of verse 13 and we think about these four piercing

00:28:17.479 --> 00:28:24.919
questions of verses 14 and 15, we find that the Bible says, for whosoever shall call upon

00:28:24.919 --> 00:28:27.999
the name of the Lord shall be saved.

00:28:27.999 --> 00:28:33.880
But then the Bible says, how shall they call, how then shall they call on Him in whom they

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:35.880
have not believed?

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:39.639
How shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard?

00:28:39.639 --> 00:28:42.719
And how shall they hear without a preacher?

00:28:42.719 --> 00:28:46.839
How shall they preach except they be sent?

00:28:46.839 --> 00:28:49.399
Why missions?

00:28:49.399 --> 00:28:57.159
Well because there are billions of people in this world and a large majority of them

00:28:57.159 --> 00:28:59.759
are not saved.

00:28:59.759 --> 00:29:04.359
It's staggering to think about the number of people in this world that have never even

00:29:04.359 --> 00:29:10.679
heard the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ one time.

00:29:10.679 --> 00:29:17.159
We used to think that often that was the case of various far-reaching places in the

00:29:17.159 --> 00:29:18.159
world.

00:29:18.159 --> 00:29:21.359
But you know we're finding it to be more and more common here in the United States

00:29:21.359 --> 00:29:24.399
of America.

00:29:24.399 --> 00:29:28.039
It's sad to me the number of young people that are growing up that the only reference

00:29:28.039 --> 00:29:32.440
that they have to Jesus is as a curse word.

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:34.599
That's shameful.

00:29:34.599 --> 00:29:37.119
It's sad.

00:29:37.119 --> 00:29:42.919
Verse 17 is a precious verse of scripture, so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing

00:29:42.919 --> 00:29:44.399
by the word of God.

00:29:44.399 --> 00:29:46.679
Yes, the truth is there in verse 16.

00:29:46.679 --> 00:29:48.319
They have not all obeyed the gospel.

00:29:48.319 --> 00:29:50.239
Have you found it to be so?

00:29:50.239 --> 00:29:51.239
Not everyone's going to hear the gospel.

00:29:51.239 --> 00:29:52.239
Not everyone's going to believe.

00:29:52.239 --> 00:29:55.599
There are people that reject.

00:29:55.599 --> 00:29:59.519
We just move on and we just go on to the next place and the next person.

00:29:59.519 --> 00:30:05.659
And so as we think about the subject of missions and we understand tonight the focus of our

00:30:05.659 --> 00:30:09.959
church and I think every once in a while, yes, we have a missions conference during

00:30:09.959 --> 00:30:16.279
the year and we have guest speakers that come and will challenge us, but it's important

00:30:16.279 --> 00:30:22.439
for me to be able to cast some vision, if you will, and to help you understand and obviously

00:30:22.439 --> 00:30:26.819
those that have been here for a long time, you have a greater understanding.

00:30:26.819 --> 00:30:31.299
Those that would be a little newer to the ministry, it's good for you to understand

00:30:31.299 --> 00:30:37.419
the emphasis and the importance and why, why missions.

00:30:37.419 --> 00:30:45.019
I wonder this evening, if you ever think about how the gospel got to you.

00:30:45.019 --> 00:30:49.259
I wonder this evening, you know, it'd be easy for us to say, I think of Holly, she was born

00:30:49.259 --> 00:30:50.259
in a Christian home.

00:30:50.259 --> 00:30:55.099
Her parents were both saved when she got, when she was born, they were saved.

00:30:55.099 --> 00:30:59.419
Her dad was employed at the church, he was an assistant pastor, school administrator

00:30:59.419 --> 00:31:01.159
when she was born.

00:31:01.159 --> 00:31:05.059
She was born in church, but you know, Holly still had to get saved, she had to be born

00:31:05.059 --> 00:31:08.539
again and she got saved, a little girl, what a blessing that is.

00:31:08.539 --> 00:31:10.899
My parents weren't saved when I was born.

00:31:10.899 --> 00:31:13.779
I was a teenager when my parents got saved.

00:31:13.779 --> 00:31:19.499
To God be the glory that there was a man that shared the gospel, that was faithful.

00:31:19.499 --> 00:31:23.499
But you know, the reality is that Holly's story might be different than my story, might

00:31:23.499 --> 00:31:27.659
be different than your story, but there was someone that brought the gospel to her mom

00:31:27.659 --> 00:31:30.619
or to her dad or to her grandparents.

00:31:30.619 --> 00:31:35.699
Somewhere along the line, someone brought the gospel to her family.

00:31:35.699 --> 00:31:37.899
The same is true in your family.

00:31:37.899 --> 00:31:43.099
And I wonder this evening how often we thank God for some faithful people that went before

00:31:43.099 --> 00:31:46.339
us so that we could hear the gospel.

00:31:46.339 --> 00:31:50.819
They took the baton that was given to them and they were obedient and faithful to take

00:31:50.899 --> 00:31:54.939
the gospel message and now here we are and we have the opportunity.

00:31:54.939 --> 00:31:59.059
We've been saved by the grace of God.

00:31:59.059 --> 00:32:03.299
We say this is a privilege, this is an opportunity for us to be involved in missions.

00:32:03.299 --> 00:32:11.219
Yes, actively involved in reaching our Jerusalem as God has placed us here as a lighthouse

00:32:11.219 --> 00:32:17.059
to reach this community, but at the very same time to reach the world with the gospel.

00:32:17.059 --> 00:32:19.699
It's not going to happen on accident.

00:32:19.699 --> 00:32:20.699
We've got to be purposed.

00:32:20.699 --> 00:32:22.939
We have to be purposed in doing it.

00:32:22.939 --> 00:32:27.939
We have to understand when we fill out that check, when we fill out that offering envelope,

00:32:27.939 --> 00:32:33.299
it's not just a, I hope, and I know sometimes I said it already, that so often in 2024,

00:32:33.299 --> 00:32:37.579
we don't give out of our poverty, we give out of our abundance.

00:32:37.579 --> 00:32:42.619
And I'm not being, I'm not trying to criticize anyone, I'm in the same boat.

00:32:42.619 --> 00:32:47.259
What I'm saying this evening is that it's not just a budget line item, can I use that

00:32:47.259 --> 00:32:49.259
terminology this evening?

00:32:49.819 --> 00:32:53.939
It's an investment in eternity, souls.

00:32:53.939 --> 00:32:58.459
How shall they call on Him in whom they've not believed?

00:32:58.459 --> 00:33:03.779
How shall they believe in Him of whom they've not heard?

00:33:03.779 --> 00:33:07.899
How shall they hear without a preacher?

00:33:07.899 --> 00:33:12.219
How shall they preach except they be sent?

00:33:12.219 --> 00:33:19.539
God, that He would put us in a position of being the ones doing the sending and not waiting

00:33:19.539 --> 00:33:22.419
for someone to come.

00:33:22.419 --> 00:33:23.419
Can you imagine?

00:33:23.419 --> 00:33:31.779
Can you imagine being somewhere and maybe just looking up and recognizing maybe in a

00:33:31.779 --> 00:33:41.939
place where there's polytheistic worldview, all sorts of false gods, but deep down is

00:33:42.099 --> 00:33:46.899
the Bible says the heavens declare the glory of God and you look and you, there's got to

00:33:46.899 --> 00:33:52.979
be something, someone, but there's no one there to give you the truth.

00:33:52.979 --> 00:33:57.739
And I'm thankful that God's allowed us to be on this side of the equation, if I could

00:33:57.739 --> 00:34:06.619
use that terminology, but we must recognize how indebted we are to give the gospel to

00:34:06.619 --> 00:34:10.139
a lost and dying world and to be involved in world missions.

00:34:10.139 --> 00:34:13.619
I love the fact that the children sang this morning.

00:34:13.619 --> 00:34:18.419
They quoted Romans 1 in verse 16, for I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Christ.

00:34:18.419 --> 00:34:23.379
If you look in the context in verse 14 and 15, before you get to verse 16, there's three

00:34:23.379 --> 00:34:24.659
statements that Paul makes.

00:34:24.659 --> 00:34:30.179
He says I am ready in verse 16, but he also says I am, or I'm not ashamed in verse 16,

00:34:30.179 --> 00:34:33.019
but he says I am ready and I am debtor.

00:34:33.019 --> 00:34:34.739
I am debtor.

00:34:34.739 --> 00:34:39.819
Paul understood the responsibility that God had given him.

00:34:39.819 --> 00:34:46.059
They sang that song and they talked about yellow and that crayon box, and yellow represents

00:34:46.059 --> 00:34:47.059
the Christian.

00:34:47.059 --> 00:34:49.459
Some of these little kids helped me.

00:34:49.459 --> 00:34:50.459
What does it represent?

00:34:50.459 --> 00:34:53.299
The Christian who is what?

00:34:53.299 --> 00:34:56.779
Afraid or ashamed to tell.

00:34:56.779 --> 00:35:03.739
I love how they got quiet there on that last little stanza repeat of the chorus and challenged

00:35:03.739 --> 00:35:12.219
us a, don't be, don't be a Christian that's yellow, that's ashamed.

00:35:12.219 --> 00:35:13.219
Why missions?

00:35:13.219 --> 00:35:18.619
A mission is a heartbeat of God, it's the lifeblood of any local church.

00:35:18.619 --> 00:35:22.339
You kill missions, really you kind of lose your whole focus.

00:35:22.339 --> 00:35:27.579
I've heard preachers say finances are tight, we need to get rid of our missionaries.

00:35:27.579 --> 00:35:30.779
I say that is such a wrong perspective.

00:35:30.819 --> 00:35:36.419
I heard a missionary say once that their pastor said finances are tight, we better pick up

00:35:36.419 --> 00:35:38.899
a new missionary, and I say I like it.

00:35:38.899 --> 00:35:39.899
Why?

00:35:39.899 --> 00:35:44.579
Because you're doing what God wants you to do, you're proving God, and I'm thankful that

00:35:44.579 --> 00:35:47.819
God's given us the opportunity to be involved in world missions.

00:35:47.819 --> 00:35:48.819
Let's pray.

00:35:48.819 --> 00:35:50.859
Father, we love you.

00:35:50.859 --> 00:35:51.959
We thank you for loving us.

00:35:51.959 --> 00:35:55.179
We thank you for the privilege of being able to serve you.

00:35:55.179 --> 00:36:01.899
And thank you for those that have gone before us that have faithfully proclaimed the gospel

00:36:01.899 --> 00:36:09.779
message, those that brought the gospel to us personally or to our families.

00:36:09.779 --> 00:36:14.979
God I pray that you'd help us to have our focus aligned biblically.

00:36:14.979 --> 00:36:21.979
Lord, that we would give, that we'd pray, that we'd be involved.

00:36:21.979 --> 00:36:25.819
Lord I pray that you'd just do a work in our lives.

00:36:25.819 --> 00:36:29.299
Encourage us, challenge us.

00:36:29.299 --> 00:36:31.539
We'll give you the glory for every decision that's made.

00:36:31.539 --> 00:36:32.859
For it's in Christ's name we pray.
