1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,500
and verse number 9, and we'll plan to go through the end of the chapter this evening.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:11,199
And let me just read a couple of verses for you, and then we'll get into the message this evening.

3
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:14,000
Revelation chapter 1, beginning in verse number 9,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:23,200
I, John, who also am your brother and companion in tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ,

5
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:29,799
was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.

6
00:00:29,799 --> 00:00:37,099
I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,

7
00:00:37,099 --> 00:00:43,099
saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last, and what thou seest, write in a book,

8
00:00:43,099 --> 00:00:49,400
and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia, unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamos,

9
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:54,599
and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea.

10
00:00:54,599 --> 00:01:01,599
And I turned to see the voice that spake with me, and being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks.

11
00:01:01,599 --> 00:01:05,300
And in the midst of the seven candlesticks, one like unto the Son of Man,

12
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:11,000
clothed with a garment down to the foot, and gird about the paps with a golden girdle.

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,099
His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow, and his eyes were as a flame of fire,

14
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:26,000
and his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace, and his voice as the sound of many waters.

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,500
And he had in his right hand seven stars, and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword,

16
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:36,099
and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength.

17
00:01:36,099 --> 00:01:41,300
And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead.

18
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:47,500
And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not, I am the first and the last.

19
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:54,199
I am he that liveth and was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore. Amen.

20
00:01:54,199 --> 00:01:57,000
And have the keys of hell and of death.

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,400
Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter.

22
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:08,899
The mystery of the seven stars, which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks.

23
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:16,500
The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches.

24
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:23,500
To begin Revelation, we find that God provides us with a glorious picture of our wonderful Savior.

25
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:33,699
We're reminded in this opening chapter to this book of Revelation of who he is, and what he has done, and what he is going to do.

26
00:02:33,699 --> 00:02:38,899
We find that in the midst of all of our difficulties and all that we're facing in life,

27
00:02:38,899 --> 00:02:45,100
just as these original recipients were dealing with great adversity and persecution,

28
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:50,899
that we are reminded in these opening verses of Revelation 1, as we preached last week,

29
00:02:50,899 --> 00:02:53,699
get your eyes on Jesus.

30
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:57,199
And it's so easy to get our eyes on other things.

31
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:59,199
It's so easy to become distracted.

32
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:06,899
It's so easy to become overwhelmed with the adversity and the opposition that we face in life.

33
00:03:06,899 --> 00:03:14,100
But we must be disciplined to keep our eyes on Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith.

34
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:17,100
We read and we studied last week in verses 4 through 8,

35
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:23,100
and I handled that passage of Scripture and gave the charge that we would get our eyes on Jesus.

36
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:30,800
And as we look at this portion this evening, we find that John heard him, and then John saw him.

37
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:36,300
We read in verse number 10, where the Bible says that he heard behind me a great voice,

38
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,600
and in verse number 17, and when I saw him.

39
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:46,500
We begin to think about this portion of Scripture, and we find that unlike really any other book of the Bible,

40
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:53,000
we have for us in verse 19 of chapter number 1, an outline for the entire book.

41
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,699
And we find that he tells us in verse 19, right, the things which thou hast seen,

42
00:03:57,699 --> 00:04:04,100
and that's the first part, the first division, if you will, if you're going to outline this book,

43
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,500
and that covers chapter number 1.

44
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,600
And then he says this, and the things which are,

45
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:16,899
and we find that those things which are are going to cover chapters 2 and 3,

46
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:22,200
dealing with the letters that are going to be written to the seven churches in Asian.

47
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:28,000
And we find that that second section is chapter 2 and 3, things which are,

48
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,299
and then verse 19 ends this way, and the things which shall be hereafter.

49
00:04:33,299 --> 00:04:35,700
And we find that that's the third division of the book,

50
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:41,600
and it begins in chapter number 4 and ends in chapter 22 at the conclusion of the book.

51
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,500
And it's so wonderful to see that God has given to us an outline for the book,

52
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:51,299
but he also gave us in chapter 4 and verse number 1 that clear distinction

53
00:04:51,299 --> 00:04:55,600
with regard to the division between the things which thou hast seen,

54
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,899
the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter.

55
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:02,100
For we find in Revelation 4 and verse 1, the Bible says,

56
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,899
After this I looked, and behold, a door was opened in heaven,

57
00:05:05,899 --> 00:05:10,000
and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me,

58
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,299
which said, Come up hither.

59
00:05:12,299 --> 00:05:18,100
Notice, and I will show thee things which must be hereafter.

60
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:23,700
And so we find that that third division that is mentioned in verse 19 of chapter 1

61
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,600
covers chapters 4 through 22.

62
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,299
And as we look at the text of Scripture before us this evening,

63
00:05:29,299 --> 00:05:33,600
and beginning in verse 9 and going through the rest of chapter number 1,

64
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,100
I'm going to title the message, if you've seen in the bulletin already,

65
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,899
John saw him.

66
00:05:38,899 --> 00:05:42,200
And I'm thankful that one day I will see him as well.

67
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,799
Isn't that an awesome truth?

68
00:05:43,799 --> 00:05:48,899
We find that the Bible teaches us, we sing songs about seeing him face to face,

69
00:05:48,899 --> 00:05:54,000
and what a joy to know that one day, if you're saved by the grace of God,

70
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,399
that you will see your Savior.

71
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:00,200
Let me remind you of what John said in 1 John chapter number 3.

72
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,399
The Bible says this in verse number 2,

73
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:08,399
Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be,

74
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:13,600
but we know that when he shall appear, we shall be like him,

75
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,799
for we shall, notice, see him as he is.

76
00:06:18,799 --> 00:06:23,799
Can I tell you that John was that disciple that when he writes the Gospel of John,

77
00:06:23,799 --> 00:06:26,299
he always refers to himself in the third person.

78
00:06:26,299 --> 00:06:31,299
We find that often he will refer to himself as the disciple whom Christ loved.

79
00:06:31,299 --> 00:06:37,200
And we find that he had that close relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ.

80
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:42,600
Yes, he was in that inner circle, but we find often that John had that relationship,

81
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,500
that closeness with the Lord Jesus Christ.

82
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:53,000
But now in Revelation chapter 1, when John sees Jesus in this passage of Scripture,

83
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,700
he sees him unlike he saw him during his earthly ministry.

84
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:02,200
He sees him in his glory, and God gives us a glimpse of this vision.

85
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:07,799
And I'm so thankful that one day, and I believe that the day is quickly approaching,

86
00:07:07,799 --> 00:07:12,600
that we will hear the trumpet of the Lord sound, and we will be raptured out of here,

87
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,799
and we will see our Savior face to face.

88
00:07:16,799 --> 00:07:24,399
Can I tell you that that truth is a comforting truth, but it also is a sobering truth.

89
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:27,200
Because when we see him, when that trumpet sounds,

90
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:33,399
and time shall be no more, then only what's done for Christ is really going to matter.

91
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:38,700
And the reality is that we look forward with great anticipation and excitement

92
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:43,399
to that day when the trumpet sounds and we see our Savior face to face,

93
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:50,899
but we must understand that it's important that we are busy now doing the work that he's called us to do.

94
00:07:50,899 --> 00:07:53,899
As we study this first chapter of the book of Revelation,

95
00:07:53,899 --> 00:07:57,100
notice with me in verses 9 and 10, number one this evening,

96
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:00,200
I want you to notice how John is identified.

97
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:04,700
The Bible says, I, John, who also am your brother.

98
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,799
And we find that it begins as he's writing here.

99
00:08:06,799 --> 00:08:12,700
Remember, John is going to write to these that are facing great adversity and persecution.

100
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:16,299
And we find that he's writing to these suffering believers,

101
00:08:16,299 --> 00:08:20,100
and he's trying to encourage them to get their eyes on Jesus,

102
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:24,000
to understand that though the wicked emperor is ruling,

103
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,899
and though you're facing great adversity,

104
00:08:26,899 --> 00:08:31,799
that our God rules and reigns, and he's on his throne, and he has a plan.

105
00:08:31,799 --> 00:08:34,700
And again, the idea of the book of Revelation,

106
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:42,000
our approach cannot simply be to try to satisfy our thoughts with regard to a timeline,

107
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,500
but we're to see our Savior in his rightful place.

108
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,500
And these suffering saints that John is writing to,

109
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,200
these that have been dealing with great adversity,

110
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,500
John says, I am your brother.

111
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:58,099
And I want you to just pause for a moment and think about the relationship

112
00:08:58,099 --> 00:09:01,799
that we have as brothers and sisters in Christ.

113
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:07,599
And I want you to understand that as John is writing to these that are suffering greatly,

114
00:09:07,599 --> 00:09:09,400
he identifies with them.

115
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,200
He says, I am your brother.

116
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:17,099
What makes him a brother is that he too has been saved by the blood of Christ,

117
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:18,700
and he is a Christian.

118
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,200
We are the sons of God.

119
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,299
Remember, John chapter number 1,

120
00:09:23,299 --> 00:09:25,700
but as many as received him in verse number 12,

121
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,700
to them gave he power to become the sons of God,

122
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,900
even to them that believe on his name.

123
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:36,099
So often we refer to one another as brother or sister,

124
00:09:36,099 --> 00:09:39,500
and it's not because we have the same biological parents,

125
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,599
it's because we've been saved by the grace of God,

126
00:09:42,599 --> 00:09:45,299
and we're in the family of God.

127
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:49,900
And that is a precious truth of New Testament Christianity,

128
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,500
and I'm so thankful for it.

129
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,200
But John goes on to say this,

130
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,799
not only does he say that I'm your brother,

131
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:00,000
but he says, and companion.

132
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,119
in tribulation.

133
00:10:02,119 --> 00:10:05,260
John understood that these, that he was writing to,

134
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,480
that they were suffering,

135
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,760
that they were dealing with this adversity,

136
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,239
but he himself was also suffering

137
00:10:11,239 --> 00:10:12,960
and he's able to write to them

138
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,479
and say that I'm your brother,

139
00:10:14,479 --> 00:10:18,219
but I'm also your companion in tribulation.

140
00:10:18,219 --> 00:10:21,440
I understand what it is to face the hardships

141
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,459
and the difficulties.

142
00:10:22,459 --> 00:10:25,520
I understand what it is to stand for Christ

143
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,520
in an evil, wicked day.

144
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:31,440
I understand how it is to try to live for Jesus

145
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,000
in the midst of all that's taking place.

146
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,959
He says, I'm a companion in tribulation.

147
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm so thankful as you think about the apostle Paul

148
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,439
and we mentioned as we've studied

149
00:10:41,439 --> 00:10:43,619
through 1st and 2nd Timothy this year,

150
00:10:43,619 --> 00:10:46,799
that so often as he's encouraging Timothy

151
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:50,840
with regard to how he is to live his Christian life,

152
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:55,479
that Paul himself is an example of doing the very things

153
00:10:55,479 --> 00:10:58,040
that he encourages Timothy to do.

154
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,180
Paul says that, listen, he suffered.

155
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,720
You're going to suffer.

156
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,040
He faced difficulty.

157
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,680
You read the book of Acts

158
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,480
and you read the missionary journeys

159
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,480
and you find that time and time again,

160
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,440
the apostle Paul faced great adversity

161
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,220
and great tribulation and great difficulty,

162
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,199
but what did he do?

163
00:11:17,199 --> 00:11:18,559
He kept on preaching.

164
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:19,760
He kept on going.

165
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,160
He kept on serving the Lord.

166
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:27,160
And John says to these hurting that are suffering greatly,

167
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:29,040
he says, I'm your brother

168
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,639
and I'm your companion in tribulation.

169
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:35,040
And I believe that that introduction

170
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,120
and how John is identified in verse number nine

171
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,120
helps us to understand that there would be this bond

172
00:11:44,599 --> 00:11:48,279
with regard to those that are receiving the letter

173
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:49,519
and the information.

174
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,440
It would help them to understand

175
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,120
as John has introduced this way,

176
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,400
understand why the cause for which he is suffering,

177
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,959
the cause for which he's facing tribulation.

178
00:11:58,959 --> 00:11:59,800
In verse number nine, it says,

179
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,260
in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ,

180
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:06,199
notice was in the aisle that is called Patmos.

181
00:12:06,199 --> 00:12:07,400
Why was he there?

182
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:12,119
He was sent there really in a difficult place,

183
00:12:12,119 --> 00:12:16,399
hard labor that he would be sentenced to.

184
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,160
And basically it was to make his life miserable.

185
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,800
And he was sent there.

186
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,520
Notice the Bible says for the word of God

187
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:28,119
and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.

188
00:12:28,119 --> 00:12:29,679
Can I remind you what Peter says

189
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:31,600
in 1 Peter chapter number four?

190
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,080
If you have a moment to turn back just a few pages

191
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,880
in 1 Peter chapter number four,

192
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,279
I wanna remind you of what Peter tells us about suffering

193
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,320
for the cause of Christ.

194
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,240
I wanna remind you this evening of the disciples

195
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,639
in Acts chapter number five,

196
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:48,119
after they were beaten and they were threatened,

197
00:12:48,119 --> 00:12:50,919
they departed from that place and they rejoiced.

198
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:51,759
Why?

199
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:55,320
Because they were counted worthy to suffer shame

200
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,919
for his namesake.

201
00:12:56,919 --> 00:12:59,880
And we find in 1 Peter chapter four in verse number 12,

202
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,240
the Bible says this,

203
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:06,199
beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial,

204
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:09,320
which is to try you as though some strange thing

205
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,899
happened unto you.

206
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:15,899
Notice, but rejoice in so much as ye are partakers

207
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,820
of Christ's sufferings,

208
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,580
that when his glory shall be revealed,

209
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:25,820
ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.

210
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:28,660
If ye be reproached for the name of Christ,

211
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:31,759
notice this, happy are ye.

212
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,979
We often see that same word translated blessed.

213
00:13:36,979 --> 00:13:39,100
Blessed, happy are ye,

214
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,660
for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you.

215
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:45,139
On their part he is evil speaking of,

216
00:13:45,139 --> 00:13:48,339
but on your part he is glorified.

217
00:13:48,339 --> 00:13:51,860
Notice verse 15, but let none of you suffer as a murderer

218
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:54,619
or as a thief or as an evildoer or as a busybody

219
00:13:54,619 --> 00:13:56,139
in other man's matters.

220
00:13:56,139 --> 00:13:57,740
In other words, we're not suffering

221
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,419
because of our own wrongdoing,

222
00:13:59,419 --> 00:14:02,179
but like John, as it says in Revelation one

223
00:14:02,179 --> 00:14:04,339
in verse number nine, he was suffering.

224
00:14:04,339 --> 00:14:07,699
He was a companion in tribulation for the word of God

225
00:14:07,699 --> 00:14:09,740
and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.

226
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:12,779
And therefore he's blessed, he's to be happy.

227
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:15,100
It was not that he was doing something wicked

228
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,739
and suffering those consequences.

229
00:14:16,739 --> 00:14:19,380
No, he was serving his master.

230
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,380
Verse 16, yet if any man suffer as a Christian,

231
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:26,100
let him not be ashamed,

232
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:30,179
but let him glorify God on this behalf.

233
00:14:30,179 --> 00:14:31,459
And it's wonderful.

234
00:14:31,459 --> 00:14:32,500
And I understand you say,

235
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,859
well, I don't want to face persecution.

236
00:14:33,859 --> 00:14:35,420
Neither do I.

237
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,519
But can I tell you that if we suffer for Christ,

238
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,540
if we suffer for the cause of Christ,

239
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,940
I believe that God gives us mercy

240
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,619
and God gives us grace.

241
00:14:43,619 --> 00:14:46,579
And I believe that God will be glorified in

242
00:14:46,579 --> 00:14:47,420
and through that.

243
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,820
Notice in verse number 10, back in Revelation one,

244
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:53,899
the Bible says, I was in the spirit on the Lord's day.

245
00:14:53,899 --> 00:14:56,980
I want you to just for a moment consider this,

246
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:00,299
that John says that his physical location

247
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:03,040
in verse number nine was that he was in the aisle

248
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,619
that is called Patmos.

249
00:15:04,619 --> 00:15:06,540
But we find in verse number 10, he says,

250
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,899
I was in the spirit on the Lord's day.

251
00:15:08,899 --> 00:15:11,700
And I'm thankful that our physical location,

252
00:15:12,459 --> 00:15:16,100
our physical difficulties do not have to define us,

253
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,420
do not have to cause us to live,

254
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:22,739
listen, under the circumstances that woe is me.

255
00:15:22,739 --> 00:15:25,459
I'm on the aisle that is called Patmos.

256
00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:28,140
I've been exiled out here.

257
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:31,279
I'm suffering, it's so hard and woe is me.

258
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,920
And this isn't fair.

259
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,459
No, no, he says my physical location

260
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:39,559
is not going to have victory over the fact

261
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:41,339
that I can be in the spirit.

262
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,279
Isn't that awesome?

263
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:46,959
Listen, we cannot allow our circumstances

264
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,100
to dictate our walk with God.

265
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,299
We cannot allow our circumstances

266
00:15:52,299 --> 00:15:54,059
and the difficulties that we face

267
00:15:54,059 --> 00:15:56,019
to cause us to have a pity party

268
00:15:56,019 --> 00:15:58,660
and just go over and just give up and say it's not,

269
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:02,739
no, no, no, we can still worship God.

270
00:16:02,739 --> 00:16:05,660
And he says, I'm physically in the aisle

271
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:08,320
that is called Patmos, but spiritually,

272
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,260
I'm in the spirit on the Lord's day.

273
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,459
Now, I do not believe that as we look at this

274
00:16:13,459 --> 00:16:16,760
and there's many people that have debated over this,

275
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,899
I believe that when he says the Lord's day,

276
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:22,260
he's speaking about Sunday, the first day of the week.

277
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,600
We find that in the Roman Empire,

278
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,940
the first day of the month was often referred to

279
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,880
as Emperor's day, and we find that that phrase,

280
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,079
the Lord's day, was often used by Christians

281
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:36,940
with regard to Sunday being the day of resurrection

282
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,279
and it being the Lord's day.

283
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:42,519
In fact, oftentimes today, we still use that terminology,

284
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:46,160
speaking of Sunday being the Lord's day.

285
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,239
I'm thankful that it's not the Lord's hour,

286
00:16:48,239 --> 00:16:51,160
it's the Lord's day, and we have an opportunity

287
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,640
to be able to serve the Lord and to be used of him.

288
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,959
We find that here in this text of scripture,

289
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,320
when Paul, excuse me, when John mentions

290
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,839
that he's in the aisle, but he's in the spirit,

291
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:05,100
it reminds me of what Paul said

292
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,160
to the believers at Colossae.

293
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,600
Don't take the time to go there,

294
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,279
I'm just gonna read it very quickly for you,

295
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:13,040
but in Colossians one and verse number two,

296
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,119
and I want you to notice what Paul says,

297
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:19,480
to the saints and faithful brethren in Christ,

298
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,799
which are at Colossae.

299
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:24,179
I'm thankful that I can be in Christ,

300
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:27,079
but I'm at a particular location.

301
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,119
Tonight, we're in Oakton,

302
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:32,399
but you know that we're seated in the heavenlies?

303
00:17:32,399 --> 00:17:34,839
It's an awesome truth of God's word.

304
00:17:34,839 --> 00:17:36,440
Listen, tonight, we're citizens

305
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,079
of the United States of America,

306
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:39,679
but greater than being a citizen

307
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:40,940
of the United States of America,

308
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:44,359
if you're saved tonight, you're a citizen of heaven.

309
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:47,559
This world is not my home, I'm just passing through,

310
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:48,880
is what the songwriter said.

311
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,279
Hebrews 11 says this, that we're pilgrims

312
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:54,839
and we're strangers, and what a joy to know

313
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:59,079
that though John was exiled to this place

314
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:02,480
for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ,

315
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,839
that he was in the Spirit on the Lord's day,

316
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:07,320
and I want you to notice that as he's in the Spirit

317
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,519
on the Lord's day, the Bible tells us

318
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:11,279
at the end of verse number 10,

319
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:16,279
and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet.

320
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,760
We know how John is identified.

321
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,399
Now notice how John is instructed,

322
00:18:23,399 --> 00:18:24,920
beginning in verse number 11,

323
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,559
and really containing much of the remainder

324
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:29,660
of our text this evening.

325
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,580
Notice the voice that he heard in verse 11,

326
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:36,900
it says, saying, I am Alpha and Omega.

327
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,340
Now remember, we just read last week

328
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:41,780
in verse number eight of our text of Scripture,

329
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:43,380
that the Bible says, I am Alpha and Omega

330
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,299
at the beginning and the ending,

331
00:18:44,299 --> 00:18:46,419
saith the Lord, which is and which was

332
00:18:46,419 --> 00:18:48,500
and which is to come, the Almighty.

333
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,900
And now John, as he's there at Patmos,

334
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,500
and he's in the Spirit of the Lord's day,

335
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,500
he hears this voice behind him,

336
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,140
and here's what the voice says,

337
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:00,700
I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last.

338
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:05,020
Notice he says, what thou seest, write in a book,

339
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:09,140
and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia.

340
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:12,460
We'll deal with these churches over the next several weeks

341
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,619
as we deal with chapters two and three,

342
00:19:14,619 --> 00:19:16,460
and deal with each church individually,

343
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:19,299
and I'll make a few comments about the churches

344
00:19:19,299 --> 00:19:20,700
that are listed at the end of the message

345
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,219
this evening as well, but let's just keep moving

346
00:19:23,219 --> 00:19:26,020
in verse number 12, and see the content

347
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:29,940
of this vision, and to see how John is instructed.

348
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,059
What a great vision he receives.

349
00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:34,179
He hears this great voice, which identified

350
00:19:34,179 --> 00:19:36,340
as being the Lord, Alpha and Omega,

351
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:38,460
the beginning, the first, and the last,

352
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,659
is what he says here in verse number 11.

353
00:19:40,659 --> 00:19:42,099
It's in verse number eight that he says

354
00:19:42,099 --> 00:19:44,219
the beginning and the ending.

355
00:19:44,219 --> 00:19:48,059
We find that as we continue, he says in verse number 18,

356
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:51,140
I am he that liveth and was dead,

357
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,900
and behold, I am alive forevermore, amen,

358
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:57,219
and have the keys of hell and of death.

359
00:19:57,219 --> 00:20:00,179
We find that he's identified this voice.

360
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:02,659
that speaks to John, that he hears,

361
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:04,319
it's identified as being the Lord,

362
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:07,819
he's eternal, he's immortal, he's almighty,

363
00:20:07,819 --> 00:20:09,659
he has all authority.

364
00:20:09,659 --> 00:20:11,559
And we find that in verse number 12,

365
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:15,639
a description begins to be unfolded for us

366
00:20:15,639 --> 00:20:19,359
to see what John is hearing and as he looks

367
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:21,479
and he begins to see, the Bible says,

368
00:20:21,479 --> 00:20:22,899
I turn to see the voice.

369
00:20:22,899 --> 00:20:25,859
Now, think about that just for a moment.

370
00:20:25,859 --> 00:20:28,459
Is that not a natural reaction?

371
00:20:28,479 --> 00:20:31,759
You hear a voice and what do you do?

372
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:33,979
You turn to see.

373
00:20:33,979 --> 00:20:38,319
And we find that as John hears this voice behind him,

374
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:41,159
it's a great voice and he hears it saying,

375
00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:43,519
I am Alpha and Omega, in verse 12,

376
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:45,959
he turns to see the voice.

377
00:20:45,959 --> 00:20:50,079
And the Bible tells us he sees that spake with me

378
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:52,739
and being turned, notice what he saw,

379
00:20:52,739 --> 00:20:56,519
seven golden candlesticks.

380
00:20:56,539 --> 00:20:58,519
We'll mention that in just a moment

381
00:20:58,519 --> 00:20:59,879
as we look at verse number 20,

382
00:20:59,879 --> 00:21:03,699
but I want you to see specifically in verse 13,

383
00:21:03,699 --> 00:21:06,779
it says, and in the midst of the seven candlesticks,

384
00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:10,179
one like unto the Son of Man.

385
00:21:11,259 --> 00:21:13,259
Notice how he's described for us.

386
00:21:13,259 --> 00:21:16,819
We find that in the midst of these seven golden candlesticks

387
00:21:16,819 --> 00:21:21,019
is the Son of Man, one that's like unto the Son of Man

388
00:21:21,019 --> 00:21:24,479
and he begins to provide this description to us.

389
00:21:24,899 --> 00:21:27,819
The vision is explained in verse number 20

390
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:29,859
with regard to the golden candlesticks

391
00:21:29,859 --> 00:21:32,299
and we'll look at that in just a few moments,

392
00:21:32,299 --> 00:21:35,439
but just look at the description that God gives us.

393
00:21:35,439 --> 00:21:38,219
In verse number 13, he begins by saying,

394
00:21:38,219 --> 00:21:42,699
clothed with a garment down to the foot.

395
00:21:42,699 --> 00:21:45,019
I want you to think about the Lord Jesus Christ

396
00:21:45,019 --> 00:21:48,219
when he went to the cross of Calvary for you and for me,

397
00:21:48,219 --> 00:21:50,599
he was ripped of his garments.

398
00:21:51,459 --> 00:21:53,899
They gambled for his garments,

399
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:56,119
but now when John sees him,

400
00:21:56,119 --> 00:21:59,119
the Bible tells us that he sees one

401
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:01,539
that's in the midst of the seven candlesticks,

402
00:22:01,539 --> 00:22:03,079
one like unto the Son of Man,

403
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:06,539
clothed with a garment down to the foot.

404
00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:08,599
There's many that have debated what this is

405
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:09,639
and what it represents,

406
00:22:09,639 --> 00:22:11,799
but I believe that we can understand

407
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:15,359
that the Lord Jesus Christ is our great high priest

408
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:18,879
and I believe this evening that we can see in this picture,

409
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,599
in this image of this vision,

410
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:23,719
the high priestly garments of the Lord Jesus Christ

411
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:26,779
I'm thankful that Hebrews goes to great lengths

412
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:31,419
to teach us that we have a great high priest.

413
00:22:31,419 --> 00:22:34,459
I'm thankful for the work of intercession that he's doing.

414
00:22:34,459 --> 00:22:36,579
According to Hebrews seven and verse 25,

415
00:22:36,579 --> 00:22:39,500
he ever liveth to make intercession for us.

416
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,659
I'm thankful that he's given us direct access

417
00:22:42,659 --> 00:22:44,219
to the throne room of heaven

418
00:22:44,219 --> 00:22:47,399
and that he is our great high priest.

419
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:50,819
We find that it continues and it says this in verse 13,

420
00:22:50,819 --> 00:22:54,819
and girt about the paps with a golden girdle.

421
00:22:54,819 --> 00:22:56,000
Now this would have been something

422
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,759
that would have been very easy for John

423
00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:00,879
to understand the garments and how it's robed.

424
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:04,759
It's maybe something not very much clear in our minds

425
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:06,599
because it's not how we dress,

426
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:09,319
but we find that what this would represent,

427
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:11,559
this being girt with a golden girdle

428
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:13,759
would represent that authority.

429
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:15,079
And I want you to think about the authority

430
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:16,719
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

431
00:23:16,719 --> 00:23:18,559
Even during his earthly ministry,

432
00:23:18,579 --> 00:23:21,979
when he spoke and when there were crowds that gathered,

433
00:23:21,979 --> 00:23:23,979
many times they would leave that place

434
00:23:23,979 --> 00:23:27,019
and they would say, none spake like this man.

435
00:23:27,019 --> 00:23:31,179
He speaketh as one that has authority.

436
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:34,379
Can I tell you what he reminded the disciples of

437
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:38,299
when he gave that great commission?

438
00:23:38,299 --> 00:23:42,979
All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.

439
00:23:42,979 --> 00:23:45,899
I'm thankful that our God has all authority.

440
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:50,000
And this being girt with a golden girdle

441
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,879
represents that authority that our God has

442
00:23:53,879 --> 00:23:56,679
that he is robed in this fashion.

443
00:23:56,679 --> 00:23:59,479
In verse number 14, his head and his hairs

444
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:02,399
were white like wool.

445
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:05,679
And we find that as we look at that description

446
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:08,279
in verse number 14, we can see a couple of things.

447
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:11,239
Number one, the eternality of our God,

448
00:24:11,239 --> 00:24:14,319
the fact that he has no beginning and no ending,

449
00:24:14,339 --> 00:24:16,660
the fact that he introduced in verse number eight

450
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:19,660
that he's alpha and omega, the beginning and the ending,

451
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,820
and then in verse number 11, I am alpha and omega,

452
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:26,220
the first and the last, we find that our God is eternal.

453
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,899
I'm thankful that he's outside of time.

454
00:24:28,899 --> 00:24:31,739
See, we are bound by time.

455
00:24:31,739 --> 00:24:36,739
Everything that we do has time constraints, right?

456
00:24:37,779 --> 00:24:40,500
Everything that we do, they're time constraints.

457
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,100
And we understand this evening when we think about

458
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:45,279
the time constraints that we live with

459
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:48,160
and that we deal with, that we must rejoice

460
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:51,799
in knowing that our God is outside of time.

461
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:54,239
And our God is eternal.

462
00:24:54,239 --> 00:24:56,679
There's some, they've asked me over the years,

463
00:24:56,679 --> 00:24:59,320
I've been asked this question, well, who created God?

464
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,759
No one created God, he is the creator.

465
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:05,940
In fact, the name Jehovah means the self-existent one.

466
00:25:06,959 --> 00:25:11,320
And I'm so thankful that our God is the eternal God.

467
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,979
And here we find when he talks about his head

468
00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:16,779
and his hairs were white like wool,

469
00:25:16,779 --> 00:25:19,639
it not only reveals to us his eternality,

470
00:25:19,639 --> 00:25:23,539
but it reveals to us his purity, that he's pure.

471
00:25:23,539 --> 00:25:25,799
I'm thankful the Bible says that Jesus,

472
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:29,299
that he suffered for us, the just for the unjust.

473
00:25:29,299 --> 00:25:33,940
He's completely pure, he's holy and undefiled.

474
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:37,600
We find that the verse continues in verse number 14,

475
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,139
it says, as white as snow, can you see the description

476
00:25:41,959 --> 00:25:44,160
that is given there, and you see as John is writing,

477
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,919
and I believe that he's going through great lengths

478
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:49,759
to be able to provide for us exactly what he's seeing

479
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:51,959
and to give us this description.

480
00:25:51,959 --> 00:25:56,959
He ends verse 14 by saying his eyes were as a flame of fire.

481
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,880
I believe that this really reveals to us two thoughts

482
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,720
with regard to his eyes being as a flame of fire.

483
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:09,239
Think about his eyes and think about what we perceive

484
00:26:09,259 --> 00:26:11,739
with our eyes, what we see.

485
00:26:11,739 --> 00:26:13,739
And I want you to understand this evening

486
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:15,699
that when we think about his eyes,

487
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:19,380
as it's mentioned in verse 14, our God knows all things.

488
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,759
Our God sees all things.

489
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:24,979
There's nothing that's hidden from our God.

490
00:26:24,979 --> 00:26:27,500
And again, that's a comforting truth,

491
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,500
but it's also a convicting truth

492
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,699
that there's nothing hidden from our God.

493
00:26:31,699 --> 00:26:33,500
And we find that he knows all things,

494
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,519
his eyes, notice, were as a flame of fire.

495
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:38,399
Not only does he know all things,

496
00:26:38,399 --> 00:26:41,479
but he judges all things.

497
00:26:41,479 --> 00:26:44,119
Fire often would represent judgment.

498
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:48,160
And you think about the work of purifying

499
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:51,399
and all that would take place and being tried by fire

500
00:26:51,399 --> 00:26:53,519
and understanding that his eyes,

501
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:56,839
he knows everything and he judges everything.

502
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:00,880
There are times in which we can go through life

503
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,600
and we can think, does anyone even know?

504
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,079
Does anyone even see?

505
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:06,039
Does anyone even care?

506
00:27:06,039 --> 00:27:09,079
We can be assured this evening

507
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:12,519
that our God sees and he knows and he cares.

508
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:17,799
We find in verse number 15, as the description continues,

509
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:22,799
it says that his feet likened to fine brass

510
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:26,839
as if they burned in a furnace.

511
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:30,079
You begin to think about his feet being like fine brass

512
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:31,440
and that judgment.

513
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,239
Listen, Jesus is the judge.

514
00:27:34,239 --> 00:27:36,199
He is the righteous judge.

515
00:27:36,199 --> 00:27:39,720
We understand that as we enter into Revelation 19

516
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,519
and he sets up his millennial kingdom

517
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:45,000
that he will rule and reign for 1,000 years upon earth.

518
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,160
But we understand that he's the righteous judge

519
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,839
and he's been given that position

520
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:52,440
and that role of being the judge.

521
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,320
When we begin to think about for us as believers

522
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,119
that we will stand at the bema seat of Christ,

523
00:27:58,119 --> 00:28:00,039
the judgment seat of Christ.

524
00:28:00,039 --> 00:28:01,759
We will stand before him.

525
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:04,479
We find that 1 Corinthians and 2 Corinthians

526
00:28:04,479 --> 00:28:06,899
both deal with this teaching and this truth

527
00:28:06,899 --> 00:28:09,039
with regard to the judgment seat of Christ

528
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:11,799
and his feet are likened to fine brass

529
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:13,519
as if they burned in a furnace.

530
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:15,359
Notice at the end of verse 15,

531
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:19,799
and his voice is the sound of many waters.

532
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:22,239
Again, you would think about the authority

533
00:28:22,239 --> 00:28:24,839
that is being communicated to us

534
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:26,600
as you think about his voice

535
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,639
being as the sound of many waters.

536
00:28:29,639 --> 00:28:31,039
I mean, it's not a faint voice.

537
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:32,139
It's not a weak voice.

538
00:28:32,139 --> 00:28:34,239
I mean, the Bible says in verse number 10

539
00:28:34,239 --> 00:28:38,679
that he heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet

540
00:28:38,679 --> 00:28:41,039
and then it's described at the end of verse 15

541
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:44,339
as the sound of many waters.

542
00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:48,559
Oftentimes I've been told that I have a strong voice

543
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:49,700
and I praise the Lord for it.

544
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,320
God gave me that voice.

545
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,359
We had this marriage conference this past week.

546
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:55,940
We're in this weekend and we're in this conference room

547
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:59,880
and they had no microphones and that sort of thing

548
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,039
and Holly commented.

549
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,559
She said, well, I guess you didn't really need

550
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:03,440
a microphone, did you?

551
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,719
And I said, no, I'm perfectly fine.

552
00:29:04,719 --> 00:29:05,599
I could handle it.

553
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:07,799
The first time I ever preached in this church,

554
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:09,960
the microphone wasn't on and I thought it was

555
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,080
and someone tried to tell me that the mic wasn't on.

556
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,320
I said, no, I'm pretty sure it is

557
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,399
and then we found out afterwards that it wasn't

558
00:29:15,399 --> 00:29:18,479
and but I think about the voice of God.

559
00:29:19,479 --> 00:29:22,159
It's unlike any voice you've ever heard

560
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:27,159
and it's a voice that has authority

561
00:29:27,159 --> 00:29:30,520
and it's a voice is the sound of many waters

562
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,599
and he had in verse 16 in his right hand,

563
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:37,039
the right hand picturing that hand of authority.

564
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:41,200
It says he had in his right hand seven stars,

565
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,440
that authority and that power of his right hand

566
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,719
and we'll see again in verse number 20

567
00:29:46,719 --> 00:29:48,279
with the vision being explained,

568
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:51,119
the seven candlesticks and also the seven stars

569
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:53,799
in just a few moments as we get to verse 20

570
00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:56,279
but notice the middle there, verse 16

571
00:29:56,279 --> 00:30:00,119
and out of his mouth when a sharp two-edged sword.

572
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:03,839
We obviously see in this verse of Scripture

573
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:07,119
the reference to the Word of God.

574
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:09,719
In the reality, listen, the Bible tells us

575
00:30:09,719 --> 00:30:12,839
in Ephesians chapter number six and verse number 17

576
00:30:12,839 --> 00:30:15,319
that we're to take the sword of the Spirit

577
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:17,839
which is the Word of God.

578
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:21,139
We find that in Hebrews chapter four and verse number 12,

579
00:30:21,139 --> 00:30:23,859
it says, for the Word of God is quick and powerful

580
00:30:23,859 --> 00:30:25,639
and sharper than a two-edged sword,

581
00:30:25,639 --> 00:30:28,999
piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit

582
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:31,239
and of the joints and marrow and as a discerner

583
00:30:31,239 --> 00:30:35,179
of the thoughts and intents of the heart.

584
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:38,059
When the Bible says the Word of God is quick,

585
00:30:38,059 --> 00:30:41,199
it doesn't mean that it's fast, it means it's alive.

586
00:30:41,199 --> 00:30:42,719
It's a living book.

587
00:30:42,719 --> 00:30:45,619
And I wanna remind you that in Revelation 19,

588
00:30:45,619 --> 00:30:50,619
that the Bible tells us in verse number 11 of Revelation 19

589
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:53,499
and I saw heaven open and behold a white horse

590
00:30:53,499 --> 00:30:56,379
and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true

591
00:30:56,419 --> 00:30:59,539
and in righteousness he doth judge and make war.

592
00:30:59,539 --> 00:31:01,899
His eyes was a flame of fire and on his head

593
00:31:01,899 --> 00:31:04,219
were many crowns and he had a name written

594
00:31:04,219 --> 00:31:06,139
that no man knew but he himself

595
00:31:06,139 --> 00:31:09,139
and he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood

596
00:31:09,139 --> 00:31:13,299
and his name is called the Word of God.

597
00:31:13,299 --> 00:31:15,499
The armies which were in heaven followed him

598
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:19,699
upon white horses clothed in fine linen, white and clean

599
00:31:19,699 --> 00:31:23,699
and out of his mouth goeth, notice, a sharp sword

600
00:31:23,739 --> 00:31:26,899
that with it he should smite the nations

601
00:31:26,899 --> 00:31:29,739
and he shall rule them with a rod of iron

602
00:31:29,739 --> 00:31:32,059
and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness

603
00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:35,539
and wrath of Almighty God and he hath on his vesture

604
00:31:35,539 --> 00:31:37,619
and his thigh a name written,

605
00:31:37,619 --> 00:31:40,539
King of kings and Lord of lords.

606
00:31:41,539 --> 00:31:43,099
See Jesus when he comes back,

607
00:31:43,099 --> 00:31:46,539
he's coming back as the conquering king, amen.

608
00:31:46,539 --> 00:31:48,579
He's coming back in all of his authority

609
00:31:48,579 --> 00:31:50,539
and all of his power.

610
00:31:50,539 --> 00:31:53,739
We're gonna come back with him in Revelation 19,

611
00:31:53,739 --> 00:31:57,959
he's coming for us and to start the tribulation

612
00:31:57,959 --> 00:32:01,219
and then he's coming with us to end the tribulation

613
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:03,899
and we're gonna rule and reign with him, amen.

614
00:32:03,899 --> 00:32:05,019
Hallelujah.

615
00:32:06,619 --> 00:32:10,259
And we find that here in Revelation chapter one

616
00:32:10,259 --> 00:32:15,019
in verse 16, he mentions about the Word of God.

617
00:32:15,019 --> 00:32:16,779
Understand that in the scriptures,

618
00:32:16,779 --> 00:32:19,860
that term Word of God is used to reference,

619
00:32:20,179 --> 00:32:25,019
a name for our savior that he is the living Word of God.

620
00:32:25,019 --> 00:32:27,899
The Word was made flesh and dwelt among us,

621
00:32:27,899 --> 00:32:29,659
John one in verse 14.

622
00:32:29,659 --> 00:32:32,459
But we understand that the phrase Word of God

623
00:32:32,459 --> 00:32:36,519
is used in reference to the written Word of God as well.

624
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:39,699
And I'm thankful that God has given us his Word.

625
00:32:39,699 --> 00:32:43,059
I mentioned this morning that every Word of God is pure.

626
00:32:43,059 --> 00:32:45,339
It's trustworthy, it's dependable.

627
00:32:45,339 --> 00:32:47,539
And I've had people say, well, don't you know

628
00:32:47,659 --> 00:32:51,779
that the Bible contains in it the words of men

629
00:32:51,779 --> 00:32:53,699
when they were not speaking the truth?

630
00:32:53,699 --> 00:32:54,720
Absolutely.

631
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,899
Don't you know that the Bible contains

632
00:32:56,899 --> 00:32:58,099
the words of Satan?

633
00:32:58,099 --> 00:32:59,940
Absolutely.

634
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,860
I've read it countless times.

635
00:33:03,019 --> 00:33:05,639
But if the Word of God isn't pure,

636
00:33:05,639 --> 00:33:08,720
then we wouldn't know that it's a valid, accurate record.

637
00:33:10,059 --> 00:33:12,059
We'd have no idea.

638
00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:14,159
But every Word of God is pure.

639
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:16,899
If I were standing on trial this evening

640
00:33:17,259 --> 00:33:19,379
before a judge and I was an eyewitness to something

641
00:33:19,379 --> 00:33:22,259
and they said, Mr. Mann, can you please tell us

642
00:33:22,259 --> 00:33:23,739
what so-and-so said?

643
00:33:23,739 --> 00:33:26,500
And if what so-and-so said was a lie,

644
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,899
but I give an accurate testimony,

645
00:33:28,899 --> 00:33:31,860
then my testimony is pure.

646
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:35,339
Even though the testimony that I'm giving is a lie.

647
00:33:35,339 --> 00:33:36,699
Does that make sense tonight?

648
00:33:36,699 --> 00:33:38,339
And so we find God's given us,

649
00:33:38,339 --> 00:33:40,899
not only is he the living Word,

650
00:33:40,899 --> 00:33:42,459
but he's given us the written Word.

651
00:33:42,459 --> 00:33:44,179
And it says that out of his mouth

652
00:33:44,179 --> 00:33:46,779
went a sharp two-edged sword.

653
00:33:47,619 --> 00:33:48,619
And then notice at the end of verse 16,

654
00:33:48,619 --> 00:33:50,580
it says that his countenance

655
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:56,360
was as the sun shineth in his strength.

656
00:33:58,539 --> 00:34:03,539
This reveals to me his glory and his sovereignty.

657
00:34:03,659 --> 00:34:05,779
I think about the glory of our God.

658
00:34:07,339 --> 00:34:10,339
The Bible says that his countenance

659
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:15,339
was as the sun shineth, notice, in his strength.

660
00:34:15,419 --> 00:34:17,019
You ever try to look directly at the sun?

661
00:34:17,019 --> 00:34:21,419
I hope you haven't, it's a bad idea, amen?

662
00:34:21,419 --> 00:34:23,940
But I want you to think about the sun and its strength.

663
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:27,139
And John says, that's what the countenance says

664
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:29,100
as the one that was standing in the midst

665
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,579
of the seven candlesticks.

666
00:34:30,579 --> 00:34:34,339
And so John, when he is given this instruction

667
00:34:34,339 --> 00:34:39,139
and we find that he's provided with all of these things,

668
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:43,779
and again, Jesus says to him in the end of verse number 17,

669
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,979
fear not, I am the first and the last.

670
00:34:45,979 --> 00:34:48,179
Now he had already said that in verse number 11.

671
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:50,660
He then says, I am he that liveth in verse 18

672
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:54,899
and was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore, amen,

673
00:34:54,899 --> 00:34:57,779
and have the keys of hell and of death.

674
00:34:57,779 --> 00:35:01,380
Having the keys gives us the truth of authority.

675
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:04,619
The one who has the keys has the authority, has the power.

676
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:07,260
And he has the keys, notice, of hell and of death.

677
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,820
In verse 20, he begins to give us

678
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:13,459
the explanation of this vision.

679
00:35:14,139 --> 00:35:16,220
It tells us in verse number 20 that the mystery

680
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:19,739
of the seven stars, which thou sawest in my right hand,

681
00:35:19,739 --> 00:35:22,339
and the seven golden candlesticks.

682
00:35:22,339 --> 00:35:27,339
The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches.

683
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:28,619
What are the seven churches?

684
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:29,540
Where does that come from?

685
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,299
Well, if you read in verse number 11, remember,

686
00:35:31,299 --> 00:35:33,779
he says, what thou seest, write in a book

687
00:35:33,779 --> 00:35:38,540
and send it unto the seven churches, which are in Asia.

688
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:42,320
And so he says that the seven golden candlesticks

689
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,279
that are there, he says, you saw the stars,

690
00:35:45,279 --> 00:35:47,079
which thou sawest in my right hand,

691
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:48,720
and the seven golden candlesticks.

692
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,079
The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches,

693
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:53,040
and the seven candlesticks, which thou sawest,

694
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,220
are the seven churches.

695
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,959
There's been much discussion with regard to,

696
00:35:58,959 --> 00:36:00,320
obviously, we understand the candlesticks

697
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,359
are the seven churches, very straightforward.

698
00:36:02,359 --> 00:36:05,639
The stars are the angels of the seven churches.

699
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:09,199
And I believe that the word angel

700
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:11,859
often is used as being a messenger.

701
00:36:12,619 --> 00:36:14,059
And that would be the understanding.

702
00:36:14,059 --> 00:36:16,619
I believe that most likely it's the pastor

703
00:36:16,619 --> 00:36:18,419
of those particular churches

704
00:36:18,419 --> 00:36:22,059
that's being represented by those seven stars.

705
00:36:22,059 --> 00:36:23,979
Some have argued that it's not the pastor,

706
00:36:23,979 --> 00:36:28,820
it's maybe just a messenger that is the one given authority

707
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:33,239
by which to receive the correspondence from John

708
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:34,500
and so on and so forth.

709
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,019
But I believe that we find here

710
00:36:36,019 --> 00:36:39,619
that as God has given to John this vision,

711
00:36:39,619 --> 00:36:42,540
we're reminded again of the work

712
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:46,220
that God is doing through the churches.

713
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,739
Remember, he says,

714
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:51,699
write the things which thou hast seen,

715
00:36:51,699 --> 00:36:54,820
and the things which are.

716
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:56,699
And those things which are

717
00:36:56,699 --> 00:36:59,579
are what we're gonna read in chapters two and three.

718
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:03,239
And we find that those are seven literal churches

719
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:06,419
that are in Asia that John has the responsibility

720
00:37:06,419 --> 00:37:08,779
of being able to send these messages to,

721
00:37:08,779 --> 00:37:11,799
and to be able to give them the instruction.

722
00:37:11,799 --> 00:37:15,760
These churches are local, visible churches.

723
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,940
Notice, if you will, in verse number 11,

724
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:22,940
the Bible says unto the seven churches which are in Asia.

725
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:26,019
It does not use the word church singular,

726
00:37:26,019 --> 00:37:28,179
but it uses the word plural

727
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:30,600
because they're all individual churches.

728
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,779
In their individual locale,

729
00:37:32,779 --> 00:37:36,139
it says unto Ephesus, unto Smyrna,

730
00:37:36,139 --> 00:37:38,459
unto Pergamos, unto Thyatira,

731
00:37:38,459 --> 00:37:42,019
unto Sardis, unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea.

732
00:37:42,019 --> 00:37:45,179
And we find that these are all churches in Asia,

733
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:47,779
Asia Minor, modern-day Turkey

734
00:37:47,779 --> 00:37:50,059
is where these churches were located.

735
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:53,440
And we find that John would have the responsibility

736
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,899
of writing and sending to these seven churches

737
00:37:57,899 --> 00:38:01,380
the message that the Lord Jesus Christ,

738
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:05,739
the head of the church, has for each church.

739
00:38:05,739 --> 00:38:07,579
We'll look at those seven churches

740
00:38:07,579 --> 00:38:10,199
and those seven letters over the next couple of weeks,

741
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:13,179
but I want you to think about a couple of things.

742
00:38:13,179 --> 00:38:15,899
Let me actually touch on this before I deal with that.

743
00:38:15,899 --> 00:38:17,139
If you're taking notes, number three,

744
00:38:17,139 --> 00:38:19,059
notice how John was impacted.

745
00:38:19,059 --> 00:38:20,559
And then we'll get back to just a moment

746
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:21,940
making an application.

747
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,359
Notice how John, we said this,

748
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:27,720
how he was given to us, how he was identified,

749
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,179
and then how he was instructed.

750
00:38:29,179 --> 00:38:31,660
Notice how he was impacted by this whole thing.

751
00:38:32,659 --> 00:38:34,460
In verse number 17, the Bible says,

752
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:39,460
and when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead.

753
00:38:42,619 --> 00:38:44,099
You know, I've often heard through the years

754
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:45,339
people say something like this.

755
00:38:45,339 --> 00:38:47,619
When I get to heaven, I'm going to,

756
00:38:47,619 --> 00:38:49,940
and you just kind of fill in the blank.

757
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,739
Can I tell you that I honestly believe

758
00:38:51,739 --> 00:38:52,919
that when we get to heaven, all we're gonna do

759
00:38:52,919 --> 00:38:54,679
is fall at the feet of Jesus.

760
00:38:55,659 --> 00:38:57,659
We're not gonna ask him questions about this, that,

761
00:38:57,659 --> 00:38:59,099
and the other thing, what happened here.

762
00:38:59,099 --> 00:39:00,059
None of that's gonna matter.

763
00:39:00,059 --> 00:39:01,339
It's all gonna be over.

764
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,260
We're gonna fall at his feet.

765
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:04,460
We're gonna worship him

766
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:07,339
because he's worthy of our worship.

767
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:12,619
And we find that John says, when I saw him,

768
00:39:12,619 --> 00:39:16,219
I'm so thankful tonight that I'm gonna see him one day.

769
00:39:16,219 --> 00:39:18,099
If you're saved tonight, you're gonna see him one day.

770
00:39:18,099 --> 00:39:19,940
I hope that motivates you.

771
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,979
I hope that encourages you.

772
00:39:21,979 --> 00:39:24,500
I hope that comforts you.

773
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,700
I hope it convicts you.

774
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,339
You say, pastor, I like the first three things

775
00:39:28,339 --> 00:39:29,339
that you said I hope it does.

776
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:30,940
I don't know about that convicting thing.

777
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:32,659
Honestly, it's a convicting thing to know

778
00:39:32,659 --> 00:39:35,020
that I'm gonna see my savior face to face.

779
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,779
It's a comforting thing for sure,

780
00:39:37,779 --> 00:39:39,219
but it's a convicting thing.

781
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:45,380
But I want you to see the grace and the kindness of our God.

782
00:39:46,099 --> 00:39:48,739
In verse 17, it says, when I saw him,

783
00:39:48,739 --> 00:39:50,779
I fell at his feet as dead,

784
00:39:50,779 --> 00:39:54,539
and he laid his right hand upon me,

785
00:39:54,539 --> 00:39:59,299
saying, fear not, I am the first and the last.

786
00:39:59,299 --> 00:40:00,900
Our God is so great.

787
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:04,540
How gracious. Our God is so kind.

788
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:08,820
And even as John fell at his feet as dead,

789
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:11,500
I can see in this great vision

790
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,380
and all the description that we gave

791
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:16,260
from verses 13-16 and all the glory

792
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:22,660
that the Bible says that He laid His right hand upon me.

793
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:23,900
Isn't that awesome?

794
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:29,060
To consider the grace and the kindness of our God.

795
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:31,100
We see how John is impacted.

796
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:34,020
Let me make application just very quickly this evening.

797
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:35,500
I believe that there's special insight

798
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,060
that's given to us in this passage of scripture

799
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:41,820
with regard to the judgment of the Lord Jesus Christ.

800
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:43,580
I believe that as we look at the outline

801
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:45,060
that is given in verse 19

802
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:48,260
and we begin to understand the scriptures

803
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:52,100
that God has given to us with regard to judgment,

804
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:54,100
we see the verse number 11,

805
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:56,360
the churches that are to be addressed.

806
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:59,920
We find that Jesus is going to,

807
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,240
in Revelation 2 and 3,

808
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,480
those seven churches, those local churches,

809
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,640
they're going to receive letters

810
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:10,920
that truly are records of the judgment

811
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:14,000
that God is giving to those churches.

812
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,600
If you read those letters

813
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,680
and we'll study them over the next several weeks,

814
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,920
we find that one thing that is said

815
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,920
to every one of the seven churches,

816
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:25,800
I know thy works.

817
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,940
And we find that Jesus,

818
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:30,280
in certain of the letters to the churches,

819
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,120
you know what he does?

820
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:34,680
He commends the church for what it is that they're doing.

821
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,600
But we find that there's other churches

822
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,240
that even if they're commended for something,

823
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,640
they're also corrected for something.

824
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,100
We find that there are many of the churches

825
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:48,800
that are given this word of repent.

826
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,520
The judgment has been given

827
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:55,560
and the God that loves us

828
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,360
and the God who corrects us

829
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,520
and the God who chastens us,

830
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:03,980
he calls us to change our behavior to repent.

831
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:08,640
And that judgment is recorded in chapters 2 and 3

832
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,800
of first, the church.

833
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,720
And then we see in chapter number four and following,

834
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,400
really in chapter six and following,

835
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,200
because verses, chapters four and five

836
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,160
give us scenes of heaven.

837
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,480
But beginning in chapter number six,

838
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,320
you know what we see?

839
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,940
We see God's judgment on the world.

840
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,360
On the unbelievers.

841
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,960
On those that rejected him.

842
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:35,080
And we see God's judgment, his wrath being poured out.

843
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,960
The Bible tells us this in first Peter four

844
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,560
and I wanna close with this thought tonight.

845
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,000
In first Peter chapter four,

846
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,240
we read verses 12 through 16.

847
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:50,360
I so badly wanted to read verse 17 with it when I was there,

848
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,040
but I knew I was coming back to it

849
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:54,000
at the end of the message.

850
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,080
In chapter four, verses 12 through 16,

851
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:59,760
we read about that suffering for the cause of Christ

852
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,100
and being happy, being joyful,

853
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:05,760
rejoicing that we're able to suffer for the name of Christ.

854
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,920
But we find that in verse 17 of first Peter chapter four,

855
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,240
the Bible says,

856
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:15,460
for the time has come that judgment must begin

857
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:18,240
at the house of God.

858
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,920
And if it first begin at us,

859
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:23,120
what shall the end be of them that obey not

860
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:25,620
the gospel of God?

861
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:31,160
In a very different way than in years previous,

862
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,760
this past week, this verse of scripture

863
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:36,480
has been so heavy on my heart and my mind

864
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:40,680
in connection with the outline of revelation.

865
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,100
In chapters two and three,

866
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:44,240
where the Bible records for us

867
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,500
the judgment of these seven churches

868
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,680
and here where this verse of scripture says,

869
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:52,840
for the time has come that judgment must begin

870
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:54,960
at the house of God.

871
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:58,080
And then it says, if it first begin at us,

872
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:01,920
what shall the end be of them that obey not

873
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,480
the gospel of God?

874
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,160
And you begin reading in chapter number six and following

875
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:09,520
and you read the judgment of God

876
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:12,360
and literally the wrath of God

877
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:13,980
being poured out upon this earth.

878
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:17,020
When you begin to read the seals as they're open

879
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:19,480
and the death and the destruction and all of that,

880
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:23,280
literally there will be billions of people

881
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,440
that will be killed during the tribulation.

882
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,640
And you say, no way, yes way.

883
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:34,660
It is absolutely overwhelming to read of the judgment,

884
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:39,660
but it's of those notice that obey not the gospel of God.

885
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:45,720
I'm so thankful that the gospel came to me.

886
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:49,160
I'm so thankful that we've been entrusted with the gospel,

887
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,080
but I wanna encourage you tonight to know

888
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:55,080
that as we see in Revelation chapter number one,

889
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:59,440
yes, John saw him, he gets this vision,

890
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,360
but he gets this instruction,

891
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,800
write these letters to these churches,

892
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:07,560
these local assemblies of believers

893
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:10,120
and these letters contain judgment.

894
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:13,360
And then after that, beginning in chapter four,

895
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:14,920
and we get to chapter six,

896
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:17,980
we begin to see the judgment upon the world.

897
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:24,720
I don't want those people that I know,

898
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:28,720
my loved ones, family, friends,

899
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:31,920
for you I would say coworkers,

900
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,720
my coworker is my wife and she's saved,

901
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:42,120
but we ought not want anyone to suffer the kind of judgment

902
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,680
that will be suffered beginning in Revelation

903
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:46,040
chapter number six.

904
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:51,600
And obviously that's just the beginning of the judgment

905
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,560
because eventually the judgment is contained

906
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:57,360
in Revelation 20,

907
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:01,160
where they will be judged for all of eternity.

908
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,580
And it's a sad thing.

909
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:07,840
This evening I'm thankful to be saved by the grace of God,

910
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:11,240
to know that the second death has no power over me,

911
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:12,560
to know that I won't stand

912
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,040
at that great white throne judgment,

913
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,840
to know that my sins have been forgiven.

914
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:20,600
But can I tell you that for us as a church this evening,

915
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,180
just like those seven churches

916
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:24,520
that we'll begin studying next Sunday evening,

917
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:28,140
judgment must first begin at the house of God.

918
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:32,400
We must have a measure of humility and honesty

919
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:36,200
and we must listen to what the one who has all power

920
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:40,440
and authority would say about our local assembly.

921
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:42,800
We don't have, we're not going to receive a letter

922
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,560
like they did, but we can take the truth of God's word

923
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,700
and seek to apply it in our own lives, our own ministry.

924
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,360
Is God pleased with us?

925
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:57,080
Is God going to commend us?

926
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:00,240
Where is it that God's going to correct us?

927
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:03,440
And where is it that God might say to us, repent?

928
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:06,680
You've lost your focus.

929
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:10,060
Ephesus, you left your first love.

930
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:12,940
And oh, that God would help us

931
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:15,700
over these next several weeks on Sunday nights,

932
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:19,740
as we look at these seven churches in chapters two and three

933
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:24,740
to have a humble approach of what God has for us.

934
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:27,180
John saw him.

935
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:29,320
Let me leave you with a positive.

936
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:31,600
One day you will see him as well.

937
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:35,840
And what glorious, glorious day that is going to be.

938
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:39,700
We sing the song, what a day that will be.

939
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:43,500
And certainly it's going to be a wonderful, wonderful day

940
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:46,060
when I see my savior face to face.

941
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:46,900
Let's pray together.

942
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:48,140
Father, we love you.

943
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:49,380
We thank you for loving us.

944
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:51,380
We thank you for your word.

945
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:54,420
We thank you for the vision that John sees here.

946
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:57,340
And Lord, as we were encouraged last week

947
00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:59,660
and in the middle of this first chapter

948
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:02,500
to get our eyes on Jesus, and then John sees you.

949
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:05,080
And Lord, we know that one day we will see you.

950
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:06,820
And I pray that you would help us, Lord,

951
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:10,140
to be found faithful, obediently serving you

952
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:11,680
and living for you.

953
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,200
I pray that as individuals,

954
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,780
we would live for you and serve you.

955
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:16,580
I pray that corporately as a church,

956
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:19,660
that we would live and operate in such a way

957
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:22,420
that you'd be honored and glorified.

958
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:24,100
I pray, Father, that you'd help us

959
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:28,560
to recognize your great power and your great authority,

960
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:30,660
that we would rejoice in who you are,

961
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:33,540
that we'd keep our eyes on Jesus.

962
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:36,160
I pray, God, that you'd work in the moment of invitation.

963
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:39,320
I pray, Lord, that you'd help us to rejoice in thee.

964
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:41,800
Lord, help us to obey thee.

965
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,520
And we'll thank you for the work that you'll do.

966
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:44,880
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

967
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,080
Would you stand with me?

968
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:47,240
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

969
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:48,880
Kimberly's gonna play quietly on the piano.

970
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,880
And as she does, the altar is open.
