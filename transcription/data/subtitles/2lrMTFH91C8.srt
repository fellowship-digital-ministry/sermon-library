1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Genesis chapter number 41 this evening.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And you'll recall from Genesis chapter number 40

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
that God provided for us the record

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
of the interaction between Joseph,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
the butler, and the baker.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And you'll remember that the butler and baker,

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
they were in prison because they offended their lord,

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
the king of Egypt, Pharaoh.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And their offense is not recorded for us,

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
but we know that they were placed in prison,

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
the place where Joseph was bound.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And through those events and circumstances,

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
God allowed for Joseph, the butler and baker, to meet.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We understand they had dreams, each of them,

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and the same night their countenance was sad

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
for there was no one to interpret their dreams.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And Joseph, says interpretations, belonged to the lord

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and he interpreted the dreams.

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And the scriptures tell us that as the dreams were interpreted

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
that Joseph first spoke with the butler

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and interpreted that dream

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and then told him to think on me, in verse 14,

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
when it shall be well with thee.

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And Joseph was assured of the interpretation

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
that was provided and knew that the butler

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
would be restored to his butlership

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
as he had interpreted to him.

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Of course, the baker, after hearing such a good interpretation

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
of the dream, decided that he'd also let Joseph

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
know about his dream.

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And unfortunately for him, yes, it was three days,

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
but he would meet a death in three days.

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
He would not be restored to his position.

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And so we find that the Bible tells us

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
at the end of chapter number 40 and verse number 23,

36
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
notice what the Bible says,

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph,

38
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
but forget him.

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I wonder this evening,

40
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
do you ever feel like someone's forgotten you?

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And there's a lot of people in our world that feel lonely.

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
In fact, if you were to look at some things on the internet

43
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
and look at some statistics and what have you,

44
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
and not that I'm a huge fan of looking at all of those things,

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
but there is in our society today

46
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
quite a serious situation with loneliness.

47
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And people feel forgotten, they feel lonely.

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And I find Joseph, the Bible tells us

49
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
that he was forgotten by the butler.

50
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Now you think about it, Joseph was there in prison.

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
He was serving, he was being faithful.

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
We understand that he kept his focus where it had to be.

53
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
God was using him.

54
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And then as we enter into the 41st chapter,

55
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
the chapter in which we'll study this evening,

56
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
we find that the Bible begins by providing us

57
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
with some timeline to what's going on.

58
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It says in verse one of chapter 41,

59
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
and it came to pass at the end of two full years.

60
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Now we were talking this evening,

61
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
there's a group of us that were here early this evening

62
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
before the service, just chit-chatting here.

63
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
And we're talking about the older you get,

64
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
the faster time seems to pass by.

65
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And many of you can testify to that.

66
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And you seem like someone said this,

67
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
it seemed like all year you would wait for Christmas

68
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
and you're just so anxious as a young person

69
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
waiting for Christmas.

70
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And now it just seems like it's Christmas again.

71
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And the cycle just seems to go so quickly.

72
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
But the reality is that two years is really a long time.

73
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And Joseph is there in prison.

74
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
He knows that the butler has been restored to his place.

75
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
We know that the butler and the baker,

76
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
three days after the interpretation,

77
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
they were both removed from prison.

78
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
The one restored, the one had his life taken from him,

79
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
according to what we read here in this chapter.

80
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
In chapter number 40, but we find that Joseph,

81
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
and the Bible doesn't give us a record

82
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
as to all that took place during those two years.

83
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
But I just wonder this evening,

84
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
as you and I can just consider life

85
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
and consider what we've dealt with,

86
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
can you imagine being in a place for two years

87
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
and we don't know how long he was there

88
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
before he had this interaction with the butler and the baker.

89
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
But for two years after that interaction,

90
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
you are in prison, falsely accused.

91
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You're in that place.

92
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And though Joseph was forgotten by the butler,

93
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
as we see in our text of scripture,

94
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I would like to submit to you this evening,

95
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
just as we're looking at the introduction here,

96
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
that he was not forgotten by God.

97
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
God always knows where we are.

98
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
He always knows what's going on.

99
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And I would tell you this evening, God has a plan.

100
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
See, sometimes we don't know what God's plan is.

101
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You ever feel that? You ever find, I'm in that place.

102
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I just don't know what God is doing.

103
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I don't know what God is doing in this season in my life

104
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
and what's the situation here.

105
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
But we can rest assured at knowing that God has a plan

106
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
and that God has not forgotten us.

107
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
He said he would never forsake us.

108
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
And we understand this evening that he knows us.

109
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
He knows who we are.

110
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
He knows the very hairs on our head,

111
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
the number of the hairs on our head.

112
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And he knows everything about us.

113
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And though Joseph was forgotten by the butler,

114
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
as we look and we understand the entirety of the account

115
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
that God gives us of the life of Joseph,

116
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
we're confident that God had Joseph exactly

117
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
where he was supposed to be at that time.

118
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You know, there are times in your life and in my life

119
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
that God might have us in a place

120
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
because there's some preparation that we need.

121
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
There's something that we need to learn.

122
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
There's some process that we need to go through.

123
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Oftentimes when I talk to missionaries

124
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
and they're talking about their deputation,

125
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
and some unfortunately have a negative perspective

126
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
with regard to deputation,

127
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
that they have to travel so many miles

128
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
and all of this to raise their support.

129
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
But others, and I would say the majority

130
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
of the missionaries that I speak to,

131
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
they have this perspective of deputation

132
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
that during that season, listen,

133
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
God can raise the support as quickly as he wants to.

134
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
He's able to do that, but God has some lessons.

135
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
He has some preparation,

136
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
some things that I'm supposed to learn during this season.

137
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And there are times in your life and in my life

138
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
that God is training us, he's preparing us

139
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
for what the future might hold,

140
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
what his plan is for us.

141
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
The problem sometimes is during that,

142
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
quote unquote, waiting time,

143
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
sometimes we get ahead of God.

144
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Sometimes we make poor decisions during that time,

145
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
and then the plan never really comes to pass

146
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
because we have gotten outside

147
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
of what God desired for us to do.

148
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
This evening, as we look at this passage of scripture,

149
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I wanna draw your attention to verse number 10,

150
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
give you the title, we'll dig in.

151
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
The Bible says in verse number 14, excuse me,

152
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph

153
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon

154
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
and he shaved himself and changed his raiment

155
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
and came in unto Pharaoh.

156
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
The title for the message this evening

157
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
right there from verse number 14,

158
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Pharaoh sent and called Joseph.

159
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
If you're taking notes this evening,

160
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I wanna share with you just three thoughts

161
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
from this portion of scripture

162
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
verses one through eight, number one this evening,

163
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
an uncertain situation.

164
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
An uncertain situation, the Bible says

165
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
and it came to pass at the end of two full years

166
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
that Pharaoh dreamed and behold, he stood by the river

167
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
and behold, there came up out of the river

168
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
seven well-favored kind in fat flesh

169
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
and they fed in a meadow.

170
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Sounds pretty peaceful, sounds pretty positive.

171
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
We find in verse number three, it says

172
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
and behold, seven other kind came up after them

173
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
out of the river, ill-favored and lean flesh

174
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
and stood by the other kind upon the brink of the river.

175
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
The Bible tells us in verse number four

176
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
that the ill-favored and lean flesh kind

177
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
did eat up the seven well-favored and fat kind

178
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
and then it says, so Pharaoh awoke.

179
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's more like a nightmare than a dream, right?

180
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
And he sees what's taking place, he's had this dream

181
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
and he awakes from this dream

182
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
and the Bible says that he slept again in verse number five

183
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
and he dreamed the second time.

184
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Now this next dream, the Bible says

185
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
that there were seven ears of corn came up

186
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
upon one stalk, rank and good

187
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
and behold, seven thin ears and blasted

188
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
with the east wind sprung up after them

189
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
and the Bible tells us in verse number seven

190
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
that the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank

191
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
and full ears and Pharaoh awoke

192
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
and behold, it was a dream

193
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
and no doubt as we look at these first seven verses

194
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
and we see these two dreams that Pharaoh had

195
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
in this one night, it reminds or it provides for us

196
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
this uncertain situation.

197
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Verse eight gives us great insight to what's taking place

198
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
but we find that that first dream

199
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
as recorded in verses one through four,

200
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
the seven is repeated in both dreams

201
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
and we see there in the first dream

202
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
that there were seven well-favored kind and fat-fleshed

203
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
and then the Bible tells us that there were seven

204
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
that were other, that were ill-favored and lean-fleshed

205
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
and then the truth of the second dream

206
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
is that there were seven ears that came up

207
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
according to verse number one

208
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
that on one stalk, rank and good

209
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
followed by the seven thin ears

210
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
that were blasted with the east wind

211
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
and they sprung up after them

212
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
and the Bible tells us that he awoke after the first dream,

213
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
he awoke after the second dream

214
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
and then in verse number eight,

215
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
the Bible fast-forwards to the morning.

216
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I don't know about you if you ever had a dream,

217
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
you ever dream and you think about,

218
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
man, I can't remember the dream that I had and what have you.

219
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Well, Pharaoh remembered these dreams

220
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
and we understand that God has given us

221
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
the complete canon of scripture

222
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
and God is not communicating to you and I today

223
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
through dreams and visions

224
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
but we find that in this particular time of human history

225
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
that God was communicating to Pharaoh through these dreams

226
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
and we find that it would be interpreted by Joseph

227
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
but notice in the morning, Pharaoh remembers the dreams.

228
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
The Bible says in verse number eight

229
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
that his spirit was troubled.

230
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
This uncertain situation led to an unsettled leader.

231
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
He's the leader of Egypt.

232
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Think about the power that Pharaoh has.

233
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You think about even in chapter number 40

234
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
with the butler and the baker,

235
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
they offended the Pharaoh.

236
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
He has them cast into prison.

237
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
One then is restored to his butlership

238
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
but the baker is put to death.

239
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
He is sentenced to death

240
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
and we see the power that Pharaoh has

241
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
but yet the Bible tells us that his spirit was troubled.

242
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
He was an unsettled leader.

243
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
The thoughts that would permeate his mind

244
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
after these dreams that he had,

245
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
they caused him to be unsettled.

246
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,220
unsettled to be that his spirit was troubled.

247
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,960
We find that the Bible then tells us

248
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,079
that he took action in verse number eight

249
00:10:07,079 --> 00:10:09,420
and he did what he always did.

250
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,520
No doubt this was something that he would have had dreams

251
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,359
in the past.

252
00:10:13,359 --> 00:10:15,399
No doubt these people that are referenced in verse number

253
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:18,000
eight would have been beckoned at various times

254
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,040
during his time of leadership and reign.

255
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,440
And this is something that was just kind of his response.

256
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,000
It was a natural response to what had occurred.

257
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,200
He had these dreams, he didn't understand them.

258
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,000
So what does he do when his spirit is troubled?

259
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,180
The Bible says in verse number eight

260
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,560
that he sent and called.

261
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:37,680
Notice the Bible says for all the magicians of Egypt.

262
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,159
The Bible continues and says this,

263
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:42,080
and all the wise men thereof.

264
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,880
And Pharaoh told them his dream.

265
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,279
Again, I believe that this was something

266
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:48,720
that was probably a common practice.

267
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,360
It was a situation in which these men,

268
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,419
these magicians and these wise men

269
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:53,880
that are mentioned in verse number eight,

270
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:58,319
they would have received at various times similar requests.

271
00:10:58,319 --> 00:11:00,200
And we find that Pharaoh brings them in.

272
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,200
Can you see in your mind's eye this evening,

273
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,639
the picture, the event as it unfolds.

274
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:10,000
Pharaoh really a kind of a restless night's sleep

275
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,879
with these two dreams and he's troubled.

276
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:15,400
The Bible says his spirit was troubled.

277
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,319
And in the morning, when his spirit is troubled,

278
00:11:18,319 --> 00:11:20,239
he's unsettled as a leader.

279
00:11:20,239 --> 00:11:22,620
He calls for all of the magicians.

280
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:25,080
He calls for all of the wise men.

281
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,879
And what do you think his expectation was?

282
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,480
Well, no doubt he was expecting

283
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,839
that as he would reveal to these wise men,

284
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,519
to these magicians, when he would provide for them

285
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,639
the information with regard to his dream,

286
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:44,480
that they would provide to him an interpretation.

287
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,839
That was his expectation.

288
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,360
That's why he gathered them together.

289
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,940
That's why he thought this is going to cause my spirit

290
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,419
to no longer be troubled.

291
00:11:52,419 --> 00:11:55,360
This is going to give me some understanding.

292
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,519
And so he told them his dream,

293
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,559
but the verse ends in verse number eight,

294
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:06,559
but there was none, none that could interpret them

295
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,759
unto Pharaoh.

296
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,839
You think about his expectation.

297
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,240
Do you think, I mean, he's a man that was

298
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,240
an uncertain situation that led to an unsettled leader.

299
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,679
He brings these men in, he tells them the dream,

300
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:23,800
and then there's no answer.

301
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,240
Man, can you imagine?

302
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,080
I mean, it's a rough day.

303
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,199
It's a troubled leader.

304
00:12:28,199 --> 00:12:29,919
It's a difficult situation.

305
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:32,559
And we find that the Bible says that he called

306
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:36,919
for all the magicians of Egypt and all the wise men thereof,

307
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:39,679
but the Bible tells us that there was none

308
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:41,559
that could interpret.

309
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:43,520
And we begin to see what God is doing

310
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,199
and how God is moving, and we begin to understand

311
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:49,580
the events, again, we're familiar with the life of Joseph.

312
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,720
Many of us have read the book of Genesis.

313
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,919
We've read the chapters in which we're studying,

314
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:56,639
but I hope this evening that even the familiar nature

315
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,679
of this particular text of Scripture,

316
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:00,360
that we would pay close attention

317
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,160
and that God would help us tonight

318
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,759
to understand that Joseph was in a place

319
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:09,179
where God was going to use him for God's honor

320
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:10,639
and for God's glory.

321
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,080
The Bible tells us of this uncertain situation,

322
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:16,320
but it's followed in verses nine through 15, number two,

323
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,360
with an urgent call, with an urgent call.

324
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,839
The Bible says this in verse number nine,

325
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:23,559
and then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying,

326
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:25,559
I do remember my faults this day.

327
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:27,559
Now, isn't that interesting that the chief butler

328
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:30,000
at this particular time, two years had passed,

329
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,039
and all of a sudden, all of these magicians,

330
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:35,279
all of these wise men are gathered,

331
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,839
and Pharaoh shares his dream,

332
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:38,639
and there's none that can interpret,

333
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,720
and then the butler comes up to the plate, so to speak,

334
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,080
and he says to Pharaoh, I remember my faults this day.

335
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:48,660
He says, Pharaoh was wroth with his servants

336
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,759
in verse number 10, and put me in ward,

337
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,419
and the captain of the guard's house,

338
00:13:52,419 --> 00:13:54,440
both me and the chief baker.

339
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,720
Now, this was two years had passed.

340
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,679
According to the start of chapter 41 in verse number one,

341
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:02,960
two years had passed, and so now, this urgent call

342
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,559
that we're going to see that takes place

343
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:06,479
within the midst of these verses,

344
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:09,520
it begins with the butler remembering

345
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,360
what had taken place.

346
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,119
All of a sudden, he remembers, and he begins to rehearse.

347
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:16,399
He's sharing with Pharaoh about the events

348
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,679
that had led up to both he and the baker

349
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,320
being put in ward, being the captain of the guard's house,

350
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,279
and the Bible tells us in verse number 11

351
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:27,920
that the butler says, we, he and the baker,

352
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,079
we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he.

353
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:34,839
He dreamed each man according to the interpretation

354
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:35,720
of his dream.

355
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,359
Notice in verse 12, and there was there with us

356
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:41,600
a young man in Hebrew.

357
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:44,079
I want you to just pause for a moment

358
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,519
and consider the truth of verse number 12.

359
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:50,040
How did this man, Joseph, get to that place?

360
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,399
There are a lot of things that we would say

361
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:56,399
are unfortunate circumstances, unfortunate events.

362
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,079
I mean, he was, his brothers were gonna kill him.

363
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,200
His brothers decided, no, let's not kill him,

364
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,359
let's sell him into slavery, right?

365
00:15:06,359 --> 00:15:08,720
We could say, oh, man, that's unfortunate.

366
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,239
We could look at that and say, as some,

367
00:15:11,239 --> 00:15:14,359
as we look at events and just happenings in our lives,

368
00:15:14,359 --> 00:15:17,440
woe is me, and this just isn't fair.

369
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,559
He's in Potiphar's house, and he's lied about,

370
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:25,279
falsely accused, placed into prison.

371
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:28,239
But the Bible says that this butler,

372
00:15:28,239 --> 00:15:30,359
as he's speaking to Pharaoh, he says,

373
00:15:30,359 --> 00:15:34,640
there was there with us a young man in Hebrew.

374
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,640
Though Pharaoh may not have understood

375
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,359
all of the circumstances that led to Joseph

376
00:15:40,359 --> 00:15:43,040
being in that prison at the time

377
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:45,160
the butler and baker were in that prison,

378
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,799
though the butler may not have understood

379
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:50,600
every detail with regard to the circumstances

380
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,760
that led to that, I can and you can this evening

381
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:57,000
rest assured in knowing that God was at work.

382
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,720
See, the Bible tells us, and we know,

383
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,600
that all things work together for good,

384
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,320
to them who love God, to them who are the called

385
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,559
according to His purpose.

386
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:07,760
And it doesn't say that all things are good,

387
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,920
that all things work together for good.

388
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,720
And I would say that we serve a God who is good,

389
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:14,519
and He's good all of the time,

390
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:17,640
and He has a plan, and He has a purpose.

391
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,480
And sometimes when the events,

392
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,959
when the circumstances of your life and my life

393
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:24,880
are not what we desire, are not what we expect,

394
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,359
we can refuse to submit to the Lord,

395
00:16:29,359 --> 00:16:32,519
we can respond in an inappropriate way

396
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:34,799
that leads us in a place where we're not able to see

397
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:36,720
what God was planning to do.

398
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,480
The Bible says that there was a man there,

399
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,279
there was a young man in Hebrew,

400
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,600
servant to the captain of the guard.

401
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:49,600
And we told him and he interpreted to us our dreams,

402
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:54,160
to each man according to his dream, he did interpret.

403
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,600
And it came to pass as he interpreted to us,

404
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,920
notice these three words, so it was.

405
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,200
So it was, me, he restored into my office

406
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,079
and him, he hanged.

407
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,760
And so as this butler remembers and rehearses

408
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,239
the events that happened two years prior,

409
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:12,920
we find that he's sharing this.

410
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,119
Now remember, the Pharaoh, he, when he had a dream,

411
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:18,959
he calls for the magicians, he calls for the wise men.

412
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,160
Remember what it was said when those men,

413
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:24,279
the butler and the baker, when they were in the prison

414
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:27,119
in verse number four of back in chapter number 40,

415
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,279
the Bible says the captain of the guard charged Joseph

416
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:31,000
with them and he served them and they continued

417
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,200
a season in ward.

418
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,880
Notice in verse number five, this is the original event

419
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,320
that the butler is speaking of now

420
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,760
when he stands before Pharaoh.

421
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,959
And they dreamed a dream, both of them,

422
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:41,799
each man his dream in one night,

423
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:44,320
each man according to the interpretation of his dream,

424
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,000
the butler and the baker, the king of Egypt,

425
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,920
which were bound in the prison.

426
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,040
And Joseph came in unto them in the morning

427
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,200
and looked upon them and they were sad.

428
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,519
And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him

429
00:17:56,519 --> 00:17:58,559
in the ward of his lord's house saying,

430
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,600
wherefore look ye so sadly today?

431
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,279
Notice the Bible says in verse number eight,

432
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:03,920
and they said unto him, we have dreamed a dream,

433
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:08,920
notice what they say, and there is no interpreter of it.

434
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,160
Who do you think they expected

435
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,399
that would interpret their dreams?

436
00:18:13,399 --> 00:18:15,959
The magicians and the wise men.

437
00:18:15,959 --> 00:18:17,640
This was the common practice,

438
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,440
this was how they dealt with things.

439
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,000
And so I want you to see the fullness of the picture here

440
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,239
and what's taking place.

441
00:18:23,239 --> 00:18:25,679
The butler and the baker, they were in prison,

442
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,079
they were separated from those wise men,

443
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:32,239
from those magicians that would typically interpret dreams.

444
00:18:32,239 --> 00:18:35,020
And so they were sad because there's no interpreter.

445
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:38,479
But Joseph, a man, a young man that's in Hebrew,

446
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:42,320
he says, tell me the dream and he interprets the dreams.

447
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,000
And so now we find that this butler

448
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,080
is sharing this information with Pharaoh.

449
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,799
Now Pharaoh's in a similar situation.

450
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,760
No, he's not in prison, but he's had a dream

451
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,119
and he's called for all of the magicians

452
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:57,559
and all of the wise men and no one can interpret.

453
00:18:57,559 --> 00:18:59,359
And so we find that this urgent call

454
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:01,400
is recorded to us in verse number 14.

455
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,719
The Bible says, then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph.

456
00:19:04,719 --> 00:19:07,299
It's almost as if he had this perspective,

457
00:19:07,299 --> 00:19:08,140
I've heard enough.

458
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:11,020
I mean, I had an expectation

459
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:13,700
that when I brought these magicians and these wise men in,

460
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,260
they would interpret the dream, but they could not.

461
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,140
There was none that could interpret them.

462
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:21,140
And then the butler shares, he rehearses what tooks place.

463
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:24,539
And it's as if the Pharaoh is saying, I need this man.

464
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,659
And the Bible says that Pharaoh sent and called Joseph

465
00:19:27,659 --> 00:19:30,820
and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon

466
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:33,539
and he shaved himself and changed his raiment

467
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,979
and came in unto Pharaoh.

468
00:19:35,979 --> 00:19:38,020
Now, can you imagine verse number 14?

469
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,059
I mean, he is just in prison.

470
00:19:40,059 --> 00:19:42,380
Again, we don't know all that Joseph was doing

471
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,299
during those two full years.

472
00:19:44,299 --> 00:19:46,179
We believe as we would understand

473
00:19:46,179 --> 00:19:48,140
and look at the record that God gives us

474
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:51,919
that he was faithfully doing what he had always done.

475
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:54,900
He was living in the very presence of God.

476
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,659
He was serving, he was ministering

477
00:19:56,659 --> 00:19:59,659
in whatever capacities he was able to do so.

478
00:19:59,659 --> 00:20:04,379
But think about the word coming to Joseph as he's there, hey, the Pharaoh wants to see

479
00:20:04,379 --> 00:20:05,379
you.

480
00:20:05,379 --> 00:20:06,859
That's big stuff.

481
00:20:06,859 --> 00:20:10,419
That's a big situation.

482
00:20:10,419 --> 00:20:15,099
And the Bible says that it, I've referenced that it's an urgent call because the Bible

483
00:20:15,099 --> 00:20:20,579
says in verse number 14 that they brought him notice hastily out of the dungeon.

484
00:20:20,579 --> 00:20:21,579
Hastily.

485
00:20:21,579 --> 00:20:26,419
But I want you to see that he shaved himself and he changed his raiment.

486
00:20:26,419 --> 00:20:30,219
That's kind of interesting, a side subject that we could talk about really, and so many

487
00:20:30,219 --> 00:20:35,379
people want to talk about in our society today, that the outward doesn't matter because God

488
00:20:35,379 --> 00:20:39,179
only sees the heart, but the reality is man can only see the outward.

489
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:40,179
Amen?

490
00:20:40,179 --> 00:20:44,379
Yes, it's true that God sees the heart, but man can only see the outward.

491
00:20:44,379 --> 00:20:51,219
I can't see your heart, but what you show on the outside reflects your heart.

492
00:20:51,219 --> 00:20:53,219
And Joseph was going to go stand before Pharaoh.

493
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:59,979
By the way, a heathen polytheistic man, and he shaved himself and changed his raiment.

494
00:20:59,979 --> 00:21:01,379
Amen?

495
00:21:01,379 --> 00:21:04,699
Not the subject of what we're dealing with tonight, but he wanted to present himself

496
00:21:04,699 --> 00:21:08,059
properly in the presence of that individual.

497
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:10,879
Oh, there's so much that we could say.

498
00:21:10,879 --> 00:21:15,779
Notice in verse number 15, the Bible says this, and Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have

499
00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:22,099
dreamed a dream and there is none that can interpret it.

500
00:21:22,099 --> 00:21:31,299
And I have heard say of thee that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.

501
00:21:31,299 --> 00:21:34,139
Joseph answered Pharaoh saying, it is not in me.

502
00:21:34,139 --> 00:21:37,059
God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.

503
00:21:37,059 --> 00:21:40,059
As we look at verse 14 and 15, we see this urgent call.

504
00:21:40,059 --> 00:21:42,859
We see that Joseph is brought into the presence of Pharaoh.

505
00:21:42,859 --> 00:21:47,379
We see very quickly that there's an introduction that's given, and I want you to think about

506
00:21:47,379 --> 00:21:52,019
the pressure, if you will, of such a situation.

507
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:54,779
Joseph's in prison.

508
00:21:54,779 --> 00:21:57,379
Pharaoh, great power.

509
00:21:57,379 --> 00:22:02,299
Egypt, the power of this nation.

510
00:22:02,299 --> 00:22:08,859
And Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, he brings Joseph into his presence and he says, I have

511
00:22:08,859 --> 00:22:12,739
dreamed a dream and no one can interpret it.

512
00:22:12,739 --> 00:22:16,099
But I hear that you can.

513
00:22:16,099 --> 00:22:17,539
High stakes.

514
00:22:17,539 --> 00:22:18,539
Pressure situation.

515
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:23,659
I said this before, but it's worth repeating in this particular context.

516
00:22:23,659 --> 00:22:27,699
As we look at this situation, we see God's hand at work.

517
00:22:27,699 --> 00:22:30,819
God's timing is not always our timing.

518
00:22:30,819 --> 00:22:32,459
But God's timing is always right.

519
00:22:32,459 --> 00:22:38,099
See, there are times in which we're kind of, what's going on, like, let's hurry up.

520
00:22:38,099 --> 00:22:42,019
But God's timing is not our timing, but God's timing is always right.

521
00:22:42,019 --> 00:22:43,019
I've said it this way.

522
00:22:43,019 --> 00:22:46,859
As you look at this portion of Scripture, the two years that have passed led to a time

523
00:22:46,859 --> 00:22:50,039
in which Pharaoh had a dream and none could interpret.

524
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:54,779
If the butler immediately upon being released from prison, remember the context of when

525
00:22:54,779 --> 00:22:56,179
he was released from prison.

526
00:22:56,179 --> 00:23:00,259
According to chapter number 40 and verse number 20, the Bible says, and it came to pass the

527
00:23:00,259 --> 00:23:06,319
third day, notice which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants.

528
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:09,139
There was a lot of things going on during that period of time.

529
00:23:09,139 --> 00:23:13,859
That feast that was going on, I mean, all of the events and so on and so forth, and

530
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:18,459
we find that if the butler in that moment of being released from prison, if he says

531
00:23:18,459 --> 00:23:23,819
to Pharaoh, hey, listen, there's a guy in prison that interpreted my dream.

532
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,259
Pharaoh's got so many other things going on.

533
00:23:25,259 --> 00:23:26,259
It's his birthday.

534
00:23:26,259 --> 00:23:27,739
All of these festivities are going on.

535
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:33,699
All of this fanfare, if you will, and he's the king of Egypt and all of this, plus he

536
00:23:33,699 --> 00:23:37,299
has magicians and he has wise men.

537
00:23:37,299 --> 00:23:41,059
Why does he need this Hebrew?

538
00:23:41,059 --> 00:23:46,759
Because in God's perfect time and God's timing is perfect, Pharaoh has a dream and there's

539
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:49,499
none that can interpret.

540
00:23:49,499 --> 00:23:55,899
And at that very moment, the chief butler, he says, I remember, and he rehearses.

541
00:23:55,899 --> 00:23:58,979
And Pharaoh issues an urgent call.

542
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:04,299
And now Joseph is in the very presence of Pharaoh and he's heard what Pharaoh has to

543
00:24:04,299 --> 00:24:09,299
say about this dream and receiving an interpretation.

544
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:15,659
An uncertain situation led to an urgent call, which resulted in a unique opportunity.

545
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:19,119
Number three, if you're taking notes, a unique opportunity.

546
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:23,859
As we look in verses 16 through 32 this evening, as we look at these verses of Scripture, we

547
00:24:23,859 --> 00:24:28,299
find the unique opportunity that God gives to Joseph.

548
00:24:28,299 --> 00:24:32,279
Again, in verse number 16, the Bible says that Joseph answered Pharaoh.

549
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:33,279
Notice the answer that he gives.

550
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,259
It is not in me.

551
00:24:35,259 --> 00:24:37,459
God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.

552
00:24:37,619 --> 00:24:41,779
I'm thankful that Joseph, standing in the very presence of this world leader, of this

553
00:24:41,779 --> 00:24:44,819
powerful man, that he shares this truth.

554
00:24:44,819 --> 00:24:48,779
He proclaims a truth that it's not in me.

555
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:54,759
He says this, that God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.

556
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:58,699
We find that Joseph had great, just certainty.

557
00:24:58,699 --> 00:25:01,059
He was assured of, he was confident.

558
00:25:01,059 --> 00:25:06,659
He had this measure of confidence that God could interpret the dream, that he could give

559
00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:07,659
him the interpretation.

560
00:25:07,659 --> 00:25:12,539
In fact, he says it this way to the butler and the baker in verse 8 of chapter 40, do

561
00:25:12,539 --> 00:25:15,739
not interpretations belong to God.

562
00:25:15,739 --> 00:25:17,819
Tell me them, I pray you.

563
00:25:17,819 --> 00:25:23,079
And so Joseph understood that it was not in him, but he understood that he had a responsibility

564
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:24,819
to proclaim the truth.

565
00:25:24,819 --> 00:25:30,019
Listen, at this moment, as I think about what's unfolding in Joseph's life and what's taking

566
00:25:30,019 --> 00:25:34,419
place, it could be very easy for Joseph to be like, yep, that's right, I can interpret

567
00:25:34,419 --> 00:25:35,419
your dreams.

568
00:25:35,419 --> 00:25:41,779
What are you going to do for me if I interpret your dream?

569
00:25:41,779 --> 00:25:44,739
But Joseph says it's not in me.

570
00:25:44,739 --> 00:25:45,739
It's not in me.

571
00:25:45,739 --> 00:25:51,219
See, what I'd like to understand as we look at verse number 16 this evening, is that Joseph

572
00:25:51,219 --> 00:25:55,779
was a man that even in this unique opportunity that was presented to him, he was not trying

573
00:25:55,779 --> 00:25:59,259
to gain for himself.

574
00:25:59,259 --> 00:26:03,459
He was in a situation where he's in prison, falsely accused.

575
00:26:03,499 --> 00:26:06,939
He's not sitting there saying to Pharaoh, well listen, let me tell you about my situation

576
00:26:06,939 --> 00:26:12,539
first, and if you can help me out of my situation, then maybe I'll help you with your dream.

577
00:26:12,539 --> 00:26:16,579
I'm being a little festitious this evening, but the reality is that sometimes when we

578
00:26:16,579 --> 00:26:21,619
have circumstances and situations in our life, we might not take the opportunity to

579
00:26:21,619 --> 00:26:27,059
ensure that God alone gets the glory.

580
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:33,259
Pharaoh says, the butler says, even though the butler heard that Joseph said that dreams

581
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:39,859
and interpretations belong to God, the butler says that he interpreted to us our dreams

582
00:26:39,859 --> 00:26:46,779
in verse number 12, and so we find that Pharaoh has the understanding that you can understand

583
00:26:46,779 --> 00:26:47,779
a dream.

584
00:26:47,779 --> 00:26:52,619
And Joseph immediately says, it's not in me.

585
00:26:52,619 --> 00:26:55,339
God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.

586
00:26:55,339 --> 00:27:02,159
Listen, when we're only concerned with God receiving the glory, it's amazing what opportunities

587
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,519
God will give us.

588
00:27:04,519 --> 00:27:11,839
When we are singularly, solely, only concerned with God receiving the glory.

589
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:15,839
Joseph didn't know that through in providing an interpretation for the dream, it was going

590
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:18,119
to change his circumstances.

591
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:24,599
He had no assurance that if he interpreted this dream, that it would provide him an escape,

592
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:25,599
that he would have some...

593
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:27,639
No, he had no assurance of that.

594
00:27:28,639 --> 00:27:30,639
But you know what he was concerned about?

595
00:27:30,639 --> 00:27:32,839
God being glorified.

596
00:27:32,839 --> 00:27:34,039
God being glorified.

597
00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:37,599
He wasn't really concerned about his circumstances changing.

598
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:42,799
You know what I'm fearful of as I look at my own life?

599
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:49,039
And I believe this evening, if we would be honest, so often we are guilty of desiring

600
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:54,079
that we would have circumstances that are favorable.

601
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:58,079
I'm the first one to admit, I like for things to be comfortable.

602
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:01,119
I don't like problems.

603
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:04,839
I really don't.

604
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:11,599
But when we're more concerned for God's glory than our own comfort, then God can do something.

605
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:14,719
Then God can work.

606
00:28:14,719 --> 00:28:20,039
So often I feel like we could be guilty of being more concerned about our own comfort

607
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:25,639
that we miss opportunities for God to be exalted because our singular focus is not for him

608
00:28:25,639 --> 00:28:26,639
to be exalted.

609
00:28:26,639 --> 00:28:28,719
Does that make sense tonight?

610
00:28:28,719 --> 00:28:35,839
And we find that Joseph, in this moment, when the butler says, he interpreted, and Pharaoh

611
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:40,279
says, I understand that you can interpret, that you understand dreams, and Joseph is

612
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:47,119
standing there before this world leader and says, it's not in me.

613
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:49,959
It's not in me.

614
00:28:49,959 --> 00:28:53,319
God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.

615
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:59,079
It reminds me of what John the Baptist would say so long later, he must increase, I must

616
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:00,879
decrease.

617
00:29:00,879 --> 00:29:03,479
Joseph wasn't looking for a change of circumstances.

618
00:29:03,479 --> 00:29:06,239
He was looking for God to be glorified.

619
00:29:06,239 --> 00:29:10,239
We find that, yes, as we study through the portion of Scripture that Joseph's circumstances

620
00:29:10,239 --> 00:29:16,799
will change, but I believe this evening if his singular motivation was on a campaign

621
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:20,919
to get out of prison, that this event would never be recorded the way that it is in our

622
00:29:20,919 --> 00:29:24,440
Bibles.

623
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:29,000
Look at verse 17, the Bible says, Pharaoh said unto Joseph, in my dream, behold, I stood

624
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
upon the bank of the river.

625
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,519
And so in these next few verses, 17 through 24, Pharaoh rehearses the dreams for Joseph.

626
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:41,759
Of course, we've read already of this as he shares these dreams in verses 2 through 7

627
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:46,159
with those magicians and, excuse me, as God records for us what had happened and then

628
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,879
the dreams that night and then he then shares them with the magicians.

629
00:29:49,879 --> 00:29:54,399
We find that Pharaoh now brings Joseph into his presence and he rehearses the dreams.

630
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:59,440
It says in verse 17, Pharaoh said unto Joseph, in my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank

631
00:29:59,440 --> 00:29:59,799
of the river.

632
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:02,959
And behold, there came up out of the river seven kind,

633
00:30:02,959 --> 00:30:05,959
fat-fleshed and well-favored, and they fed in a meadow.

634
00:30:05,959 --> 00:30:08,139
Behold, seven other kind came up after them,

635
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:10,199
poor and very ill-favored and lean flesh,

636
00:30:10,199 --> 00:30:14,039
such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness.

637
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:17,279
And the lean and the ill-favored kind

638
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:20,479
did eat up the first seven fat kind.

639
00:30:20,479 --> 00:30:22,119
Verse 20, when they'd eaten them up,

640
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:24,859
it could not be known that they had eaten them,

641
00:30:24,859 --> 00:30:28,259
but they were still ill-favored as at the beginning,

642
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:29,419
so I awoke.

643
00:30:30,379 --> 00:30:31,859
And I saw my dream, and behold,

644
00:30:31,859 --> 00:30:34,339
seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good.

645
00:30:34,339 --> 00:30:36,019
And behold, seven ears withered thin

646
00:30:36,019 --> 00:30:38,899
and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them.

647
00:30:38,899 --> 00:30:41,599
And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears,

648
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:43,379
and I told this unto the magicians,

649
00:30:43,379 --> 00:30:47,739
but there was none that could declare it to me.

650
00:30:47,739 --> 00:30:50,039
And so we find that as Pharaoh rehearses these dreams

651
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:53,899
that Joseph is now hearing in verses 17 through 24,

652
00:30:53,899 --> 00:30:57,399
this record of these dreams that Pharaoh had,

653
00:30:57,399 --> 00:30:58,919
there's a little additional insight

654
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:02,239
that is provided to us there in verse number 21,

655
00:31:02,239 --> 00:31:04,919
that even after those ill-favored kind

656
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:06,519
ate up those fat flesh kind,

657
00:31:06,519 --> 00:31:09,399
that it was not noticeable, you could not tell,

658
00:31:09,399 --> 00:31:11,559
and they were just as they were at the beginning.

659
00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:14,719
And we find that he ends, Pharaoh ends,

660
00:31:14,719 --> 00:31:18,159
this conversation with Joseph or his part of it

661
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:20,199
as rehearsing these dreams by telling him

662
00:31:20,199 --> 00:31:22,439
that I told this to the magicians,

663
00:31:22,439 --> 00:31:24,799
but there was none that could declare it to me.

664
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:27,519
Notice Joseph's response.

665
00:31:28,439 --> 00:31:31,999
In verse 25, Joseph said unto Pharaoh,

666
00:31:31,999 --> 00:31:33,559
the dream of Pharaoh is won.

667
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:37,839
Notice what he says, God hath showed Pharaoh

668
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:40,999
what he is about to do.

669
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:44,279
Understand that God is always at work.

670
00:31:45,999 --> 00:31:47,959
Listen, God's in control of everything.

671
00:31:48,879 --> 00:31:51,079
You ever hear somebody talk about mother nature?

672
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:53,719
No, no, God is the creator and he's the sustainer.

673
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:57,839
God sends the rain and God withholds the rain, amen.

674
00:31:57,839 --> 00:31:59,959
God's in control of everything.

675
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:02,239
God is God.

676
00:32:02,239 --> 00:32:05,599
And we find that he says, God hath showed Pharaoh

677
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:09,079
what he is about to do.

678
00:32:09,079 --> 00:32:11,039
By the way, that was gracious of God

679
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:15,039
to show to Pharaoh what he was about to do.

680
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:16,359
It was gracious.

681
00:32:16,359 --> 00:32:17,399
Can I tell you this evening

682
00:32:17,399 --> 00:32:19,359
that when we look at this portion of Scripture

683
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:21,119
and we see what God is going to do,

684
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:22,919
really in the next 14 years

685
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:25,639
and their history and what's going on,

686
00:32:25,639 --> 00:32:28,359
God's revealing to Pharaoh in this dream

687
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:30,999
what's going to take place over these next 14 years,

688
00:32:30,999 --> 00:32:33,399
I want you to understand that God has revealed to us

689
00:32:33,399 --> 00:32:35,039
his plans for the future as well.

690
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:38,479
Listen, God is at work today.

691
00:32:38,479 --> 00:32:40,039
God is on his throne today.

692
00:32:40,039 --> 00:32:42,319
The Lord God omnipotent reigneth.

693
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:43,279
He is in control.

694
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:45,239
There's nothing that takes God by surprise.

695
00:32:45,239 --> 00:32:47,199
There's nothing that God is not aware of.

696
00:32:47,199 --> 00:32:49,319
We understand that God has a plan.

697
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:51,359
And by the way, not only does God have a plan,

698
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:54,679
but God's plan will come to pass.

699
00:32:54,679 --> 00:32:57,519
We're not going to keep God's plan from coming to pass.

700
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:00,839
God's plan is going to come forth.

701
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:02,079
It's going to come to pass.

702
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:04,639
And so he tells him, God hath showed Pharaoh

703
00:33:04,639 --> 00:33:05,719
what he's about to do.

704
00:33:05,719 --> 00:33:09,239
Notice in verse 26, the seven good kind are seven years

705
00:33:09,239 --> 00:33:11,159
and the seven good ears are seven years.

706
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:12,959
The dream is one.

707
00:33:12,959 --> 00:33:14,839
The seven thin and ill favored kind

708
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:17,159
that came up after them are seven years

709
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:19,919
and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind

710
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:21,599
shall be seven years of famine.

711
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:23,559
This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh,

712
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:27,679
what God is about to do, he showeth unto Pharaoh.

713
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:29,719
Behold, notice the verse 29,

714
00:33:29,719 --> 00:33:32,879
there comes seven years of great plenty

715
00:33:32,879 --> 00:33:36,159
throughout all the land of Egypt.

716
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:39,839
Now that's a positive, that's welcomed news.

717
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:42,279
There's going to be seven years.

718
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:46,039
Notice it doesn't just say of plenty, but of great plenty.

719
00:33:46,039 --> 00:33:47,719
There's going to be blessing.

720
00:33:47,719 --> 00:33:50,239
I mean, there's going to be an abundance.

721
00:33:50,239 --> 00:33:52,919
And it says throughout all the land of Egypt,

722
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:55,559
it says this, and there shall arise after them

723
00:33:55,559 --> 00:33:57,759
seven years of famine.

724
00:33:57,759 --> 00:33:59,319
Notice what it says in verse 30,

725
00:33:59,319 --> 00:34:04,319
and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt

726
00:34:04,479 --> 00:34:08,919
and the famine shall consume the land.

727
00:34:08,919 --> 00:34:10,799
Now that's a problem.

728
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:15,679
But God is gracious in revealing what's going to happen

729
00:34:16,319 --> 00:34:17,319
in these next 14 years.

730
00:34:17,319 --> 00:34:19,919
In verse 31, the Bible says the plenty

731
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:21,319
shall not be known in the land

732
00:34:21,319 --> 00:34:23,119
by reason of the famine following,

733
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:26,159
for it shall be very grievous.

734
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,759
The Bible said of the years of plenty

735
00:34:27,759 --> 00:34:30,199
that it shall be, according to verse 29,

736
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:33,239
great plenty, seven years of great plenty.

737
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:35,879
But we find that that famine, those seven years of famine,

738
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:40,000
at the end of verse 31 is described as being very grievous.

739
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:45,359
And for that, the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice.

740
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:48,440
And the reason it's doubled is because the thing,

741
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:51,440
notice what it says, is established by God,

742
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:56,440
and God will shortly bring it to pass.

743
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,399
The thing is established by God.

744
00:34:58,399 --> 00:35:00,000
This is what God is going to do.

745
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,959
We find that God is going to bring it to pass,

746
00:35:03,959 --> 00:35:05,479
notice the Bible says shortly.

747
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:07,440
And so we think about these seven years of plenty,

748
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,000
what happens oftentimes,

749
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,359
what's the human tendency in times of plenty?

750
00:35:12,479 --> 00:35:16,679
Live large, right, am I not right?

751
00:35:17,759 --> 00:35:18,839
There's years of plenty,

752
00:35:18,839 --> 00:35:21,039
and I understand that there's some people,

753
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:23,839
I'm not talking about across the board 100%,

754
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:25,879
but I'm saying generally speaking,

755
00:35:25,879 --> 00:35:28,279
when there's times of plenty,

756
00:35:28,279 --> 00:35:30,720
there's times of extravagance,

757
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:35,039
there's times of living large, enjoying life.

758
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:40,559
No thought of that plenty might not continue, right?

759
00:35:40,879 --> 00:35:42,839
That's the typical human behavior.

760
00:35:43,959 --> 00:35:46,720
God in his grace and his mercy

761
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,199
is showing to Pharaoh, to the Egyptians,

762
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:52,279
Joseph will be the one to interpret the dreams,

763
00:35:52,279 --> 00:35:55,799
but he's showing to them what he is going to bring to pass,

764
00:35:55,799 --> 00:35:58,239
what he is about to do.

765
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:01,759
And we find that that dream, as Joseph says,

766
00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:03,919
it's one dream, yes, there were two, but it's one,

767
00:36:03,919 --> 00:36:06,359
and God doubled it to you

768
00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:09,559
because he's established these things, this thing,

769
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:13,399
and he wants you to know he's going to bring it to pass.

770
00:36:13,399 --> 00:36:15,279
And so Joseph interprets the dreams.

771
00:36:15,279 --> 00:36:16,639
Next week, actually in two weeks,

772
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:18,919
we'll look at the rest of chapter 41.

773
00:36:18,919 --> 00:36:20,440
It's a lengthy passage of scripture,

774
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,720
but we'll go through the end of the chapter next week

775
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,359
and look at the position in which Joseph is promoted to.

776
00:36:26,359 --> 00:36:28,339
And of course, many of us are familiar with this,

777
00:36:28,339 --> 00:36:29,399
but I want us to focus,

778
00:36:29,399 --> 00:36:31,359
as we finish the message this evening,

779
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:34,359
at really considering this unique opportunity.

780
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:37,759
And where Joseph was at the beginning of chapter 41,

781
00:36:37,759 --> 00:36:42,199
to where he stands in verses 17 through 32,

782
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:43,779
standing before Pharaoh,

783
00:36:43,779 --> 00:36:47,799
providing him with an interpretation for this dream,

784
00:36:47,799 --> 00:36:50,399
when all of the magicians and all of these wise men

785
00:36:50,399 --> 00:36:52,319
are kind of on the sidelines, so to speak,

786
00:36:52,319 --> 00:36:54,199
and they have nothing to offer,

787
00:36:54,199 --> 00:36:57,679
and yet Joseph is there with this unique opportunity.

788
00:36:57,679 --> 00:36:59,839
I believe this evening, as I mentioned,

789
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:01,879
though Joseph was forgotten by the butler,

790
00:37:01,879 --> 00:37:04,000
God knew exactly where he was,

791
00:37:04,039 --> 00:37:07,799
and God's plan was coming to pass just as he had planned it.

792
00:37:07,799 --> 00:37:09,279
We find this evening that the Lord

793
00:37:09,279 --> 00:37:11,399
had a unique opportunity for Joseph,

794
00:37:11,399 --> 00:37:14,119
and I believe tonight that God has unique opportunities

795
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:15,799
for you and I as well.

796
00:37:15,799 --> 00:37:19,839
God has opportunities for us, unique opportunities.

797
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:21,919
And sometimes those unique opportunities

798
00:37:21,919 --> 00:37:24,239
are going to come through maybe,

799
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:26,359
as we looked at this portion of scripture,

800
00:37:26,359 --> 00:37:29,919
maybe some uncertain situations that we face in life,

801
00:37:29,919 --> 00:37:32,559
maybe some uncertainties in our world today

802
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:33,519
that are taking place,

803
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:37,899
and we find that God has unique opportunities for us.

804
00:37:37,899 --> 00:37:40,119
Every opportunity isn't gonna look the same.

805
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:42,599
It's not going to come packaged the same way,

806
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:45,079
but I believe this evening that God wants to use

807
00:37:45,079 --> 00:37:48,879
each and every one of us for his honor and for his glory.

808
00:37:48,879 --> 00:37:50,319
Brother Don, we and I were talking

809
00:37:50,319 --> 00:37:51,639
before the service this evening.

810
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:53,559
He's gonna be 91 in just a few weeks,

811
00:37:53,559 --> 00:37:54,559
and he said this, he said,

812
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:55,599
I don't think about it often.

813
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,079
I hope it's okay that I share this.

814
00:37:57,079 --> 00:37:58,199
He said, I don't think about it often,

815
00:37:58,199 --> 00:38:01,440
but sometimes I wonder, man, 91's a long time,

816
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,319
and I'm still alive,

817
00:38:02,319 --> 00:38:05,559
and so many others die prior to that age.

818
00:38:05,559 --> 00:38:08,119
And I said, Brother Don, God has a plan for you.

819
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:10,119
God's not done with you.

820
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:11,119
You know what I believe tonight?

821
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:14,440
When God's done with us, he's gonna take us home, amen?

822
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,039
And I know that God's not done with us

823
00:38:16,039 --> 00:38:16,879
because we're still here,

824
00:38:16,879 --> 00:38:18,119
and see, he still has a purpose,

825
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:20,399
and he still has a plan, and he's still working.

826
00:38:20,399 --> 00:38:22,179
And I think about these unique opportunities

827
00:38:22,179 --> 00:38:23,379
that God would give us,

828
00:38:23,379 --> 00:38:26,179
but if we're going to have these unique opportunities,

829
00:38:26,179 --> 00:38:28,839
if we're going to have the kind of opportunity,

830
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:31,079
and I understand we're not gonna stand before a pharaoh

831
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:32,479
and maybe interpret a dream,

832
00:38:32,479 --> 00:38:34,080
but we find this evening

833
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,659
that these opportunities that we might have,

834
00:38:36,659 --> 00:38:40,760
we must not grow weary in the time of difficulty.

835
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,320
We must not grow weary.

836
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,640
We must not give up.

837
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,519
We must not throw in the towel.

838
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:46,959
We must remain faithful.

839
00:38:46,959 --> 00:38:48,640
We must remain steadfast.

840
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,619
We must recognize that God's timing is perfect,

841
00:38:51,619 --> 00:38:53,399
and at God's perfect time,

842
00:38:53,399 --> 00:38:57,679
that he will open the door that only he can open.

843
00:38:57,679 --> 00:39:00,739
You ever try to open a door that God hasn't opened?

844
00:39:00,739 --> 00:39:02,099
It's frustrating.

845
00:39:03,779 --> 00:39:05,179
You try to beat down a door,

846
00:39:05,179 --> 00:39:06,739
and you know what happens sometimes?

847
00:39:06,739 --> 00:39:08,500
Sometimes you can be successful,

848
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,899
and then you regret it real quick

849
00:39:09,899 --> 00:39:10,899
after you get into the room,

850
00:39:10,899 --> 00:39:13,880
and you find out, well, man, I made a mess of this.

851
00:39:15,279 --> 00:39:18,260
So much better when you let God open the door,

852
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:21,519
when you let God work as only he can work,

853
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:24,779
and we find that those opportunities are going to come.

854
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:26,659
Listen, I understand that it might not be

855
00:39:26,659 --> 00:39:29,479
like Joseph here in Genesis 41, that someone has a dream,

856
00:39:29,479 --> 00:39:31,279
but I understand there's a lot of people today

857
00:39:31,279 --> 00:39:33,119
in our world that don't know what's going on

858
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:34,479
with all the things that are taking place

859
00:39:34,479 --> 00:39:35,440
in our world today.

860
00:39:36,679 --> 00:39:38,559
They have no clue whatsoever.

861
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:40,820
There are a lot of people that are scared of death.

862
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:43,779
I mentioned that this morning from Hebrews chapter number two.

863
00:39:43,779 --> 00:39:46,179
They have no clue as to what's going to happen.

864
00:39:46,179 --> 00:39:48,459
They have no idea when they take their final breath.

865
00:39:48,459 --> 00:39:50,859
Listen, we believe in the rapture.

866
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,119
The trumpet of the Lord's gonna sound.

867
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:56,179
We're gonna be raptured out of here.

868
00:39:56,179 --> 00:39:57,279
It's an imminent thing.

869
00:39:57,279 --> 00:40:00,080
It's going to begin the seven-year tribulation period.

870
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:06,480
time that's going to be great tribulation here upon this earth, and we find that, listen,

871
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:11,200
we have opportunity right now to tell people, hey, Jesus loves you.

872
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,640
He died for you.

873
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,840
He wants to save you.

874
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:18,600
There are people that look at world events, they have no idea what's going on, but God's

875
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,600
given us some insight.

876
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,600
Why?

877
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,880
Because He's given us this book.

878
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:27,960
There's some answers that we have to the questions that people have in this world because we

879
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,680
have the Bible.

880
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:34,960
We have the Holy Spirit of God living within us, and we can give an answer to those that

881
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:39,880
would ask us of the hope that lies within us, and we can have those opportunities.

882
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:45,880
And this evening, as we consider this situation here with Joseph, and we understand all that

883
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:50,440
has taken place, and we see this unique opportunity, we say, man, that's wonderful that he has

884
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,800
this unique opportunity.

885
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:55,800
Don't forget how it came to pass.

886
00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:01,720
Don't forget all of the, quote-unquote, unfortunate things that happened from our human perspective

887
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:05,040
that led to this unique opportunity.

888
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:09,920
When you're dealing with the circumstances in your life, you must rest assured that God

889
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,960
is in control and that God has a plan.

890
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:19,280
And we must not, we must not overlook the truth that we spent time trying to really

891
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,600
hammer in this evening.

892
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:27,760
We must not lose sight of that truth in verse number 16, and we must live our lives with

893
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,960
the perspective that God receives the glory.

894
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:35,520
Joseph said, it is not in me.

895
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:39,360
It is not in me.

896
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:43,880
God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.

897
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:48,680
He was troubled, but Joseph provides an interpretation.

898
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,080
Joseph was there in that place.

899
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:55,960
He would say to his brothers later, far later, am I not in the place of God?

900
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:58,920
He understood that God was at work in his life.

901
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:03,680
This evening, I don't know what opportunity God has for you, but I believe He does have

902
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,200
an opportunity for you.

903
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:09,680
And I believe that God wants to use you for His honor and for His glory.

904
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,680
He wants to use me for His honor and for His glory.

905
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:16,400
And if we just get to the place where it was not really about us, but it was all about

906
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:25,920
Him, and our singular, most focused concern would be that He alone would be glorified,

907
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,760
God will give us opportunities.

908
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:36,160
Because our concern is not for us, but for His name to be exalted and magnified.

909
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,480
Joseph said, it is not in me.

910
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:42,560
Oh, that we would seize the opportunities that God would give us.

911
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,800
I believe that He has opportunities.

912
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:49,520
We need to pray that God would keep us faithful, help us not to grow weary, and help us to

913
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:54,320
be ready to seize those opportunities when they come that we would be used to bring honor

914
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:57,960
and glory to His name and to His name alone.

915
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:58,960
Let's pray.

916
00:42:58,960 --> 00:42:59,960
Father, we love You.

917
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:00,960
We thank You for loving us.

918
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:05,120
We thank You for the truth of this portion of Scripture in the book of Genesis and the

919
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,120
events, the life of Joseph.

920
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:14,560
And God, I pray that through studying these verses tonight, You would help us not only

921
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:23,000
to understand the historical context, a testimony of Joseph's life, but God, would You help

922
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:29,320
us to rest in knowing that You have a plan for us as well, that You know where we are.

923
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:33,880
Though Joseph was forgotten by the butler, You knew exactly where he was.

924
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:36,520
You had him in exactly the place You wanted him.

925
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:41,960
God, You gave him such unique opportunity to stand before the leader of the nation of

926
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:46,320
Egypt in order to exalt Your name.

927
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:50,080
God, I thank You for Joseph and for his testimony.

928
00:43:50,080 --> 00:44:00,240
And I pray that we would follow that pattern, that we would not desire to receive glory

929
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:05,600
of ourselves, but all be about Christ.

930
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:09,880
I pray that You'd give us unique opportunities, help us to seize them, Lord, help us to speak

931
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,300
of Thee.

932
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:16,780
We live in a world that's confused, a world that's hurting, a world that's searching.

933
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:19,940
God, You've given us Your Word.

934
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:26,180
God, I pray that You'd help us to have those opportunities, to be ready to give an answer

935
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:27,740
to the hope that lieth within us.

936
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:31,820
I pray that You'd help us, Lord, to be doers of the Word tonight, and we'll thank You for

937
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:32,820
it.

938
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:33,100
In Christ's name we pray.
