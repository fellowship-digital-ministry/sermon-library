00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Genesis chapter number 41 this evening.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
And you'll recall from Genesis chapter number 40

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
that God provided for us the record

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
of the interaction between Joseph,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
the butler, and the baker.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And you'll remember that the butler and baker,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
they were in prison because they offended their lord,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
the king of Egypt, Pharaoh.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And their offense is not recorded for us,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
but we know that they were placed in prison,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
the place where Joseph was bound.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And through those events and circumstances,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
God allowed for Joseph, the butler and baker, to meet.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
We understand they had dreams, each of them,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and the same night their countenance was sad

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
for there was no one to interpret their dreams.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And Joseph, says interpretations, belonged to the lord

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and he interpreted the dreams.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And the scriptures tell us that as the dreams were interpreted

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
that Joseph first spoke with the butler

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and interpreted that dream

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and then told him to think on me, in verse 14,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
when it shall be well with thee.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And Joseph was assured of the interpretation

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
that was provided and knew that the butler

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
would be restored to his butlership

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
as he had interpreted to him.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Of course, the baker, after hearing such a good interpretation

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
of the dream, decided that he'd also let Joseph

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000
know about his dream.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And unfortunately for him, yes, it was three days,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
but he would meet a death in three days.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
He would not be restored to his position.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And so we find that the Bible tells us

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
at the end of chapter number 40 and verse number 23,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000
notice what the Bible says,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
but forget him.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
I wonder this evening,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
do you ever feel like someone's forgotten you?

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
And there's a lot of people in our world that feel lonely.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
In fact, if you were to look at some things on the internet

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
and look at some statistics and what have you,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and not that I'm a huge fan of looking at all of those things,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
but there is in our society today

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
quite a serious situation with loneliness.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
And people feel forgotten, they feel lonely.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
And I find Joseph, the Bible tells us

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
that he was forgotten by the butler.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Now you think about it, Joseph was there in prison.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
He was serving, he was being faithful.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
We understand that he kept his focus where it had to be.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
God was using him.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
And then as we enter into the 41st chapter,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
the chapter in which we'll study this evening,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
we find that the Bible begins by providing us

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
with some timeline to what's going on.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
It says in verse one of chapter 41,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and it came to pass at the end of two full years.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Now we were talking this evening,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
there's a group of us that were here early this evening

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
before the service, just chit-chatting here.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
And we're talking about the older you get,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
the faster time seems to pass by.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
And many of you can testify to that.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
And you seem like someone said this,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
it seemed like all year you would wait for Christmas

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
and you're just so anxious as a young person

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000
waiting for Christmas.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
And now it just seems like it's Christmas again.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
And the cycle just seems to go so quickly.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
But the reality is that two years is really a long time.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
And Joseph is there in prison.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
He knows that the butler has been restored to his place.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
We know that the butler and the baker,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
three days after the interpretation,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
they were both removed from prison.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
The one restored, the one had his life taken from him,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
according to what we read here in this chapter.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
In chapter number 40, but we find that Joseph,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
and the Bible doesn't give us a record

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
as to all that took place during those two years.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
But I just wonder this evening,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
as you and I can just consider life

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
and consider what we've dealt with,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
can you imagine being in a place for two years

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
and we don't know how long he was there

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
before he had this interaction with the butler and the baker.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
But for two years after that interaction,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
you are in prison, falsely accused.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000
You're in that place.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
And though Joseph was forgotten by the butler,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
as we see in our text of scripture,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
I would like to submit to you this evening,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
just as we're looking at the introduction here,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
that he was not forgotten by God.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
God always knows where we are.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
He always knows what's going on.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
And I would tell you this evening, God has a plan.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
See, sometimes we don't know what God's plan is.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
You ever feel that? You ever find, I'm in that place.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000
I just don't know what God is doing.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
I don't know what God is doing in this season in my life

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
and what's the situation here.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
But we can rest assured at knowing that God has a plan

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
and that God has not forgotten us.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
He said he would never forsake us.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
And we understand this evening that he knows us.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000
He knows who we are.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
He knows the very hairs on our head,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
the number of the hairs on our head.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
And he knows everything about us.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
And though Joseph was forgotten by the butler,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
as we look and we understand the entirety of the account

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
that God gives us of the life of Joseph,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
we're confident that God had Joseph exactly

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
where he was supposed to be at that time.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
You know, there are times in your life and in my life

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
that God might have us in a place

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
because there's some preparation that we need.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
There's something that we need to learn.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
There's some process that we need to go through.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Oftentimes when I talk to missionaries

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
and they're talking about their deputation,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
and some unfortunately have a negative perspective

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000
with regard to deputation,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
that they have to travel so many miles

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
and all of this to raise their support.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
But others, and I would say the majority

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
of the missionaries that I speak to,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
they have this perspective of deputation

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
that during that season, listen,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
God can raise the support as quickly as he wants to.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
He's able to do that, but God has some lessons.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000
He has some preparation,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
some things that I'm supposed to learn during this season.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
And there are times in your life and in my life

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
that God is training us, he's preparing us

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
for what the future might hold,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
what his plan is for us.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
The problem sometimes is during that,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
quote unquote, waiting time,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
sometimes we get ahead of God.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Sometimes we make poor decisions during that time,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
and then the plan never really comes to pass

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
because we have gotten outside

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
of what God desired for us to do.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
This evening, as we look at this passage of scripture,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
I wanna draw your attention to verse number 10,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000
give you the title, we'll dig in.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
The Bible says in verse number 14, excuse me,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
and he shaved himself and changed his raiment

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
and came in unto Pharaoh.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000
The title for the message this evening

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
right there from verse number 14,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Pharaoh sent and called Joseph.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000
If you're taking notes this evening,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
I wanna share with you just three thoughts

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
from this portion of scripture

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
verses one through eight, number one this evening,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
an uncertain situation.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
An uncertain situation, the Bible says

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
and it came to pass at the end of two full years

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
that Pharaoh dreamed and behold, he stood by the river

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
and behold, there came up out of the river

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
seven well-favored kind in fat flesh

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
and they fed in a meadow.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Sounds pretty peaceful, sounds pretty positive.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
We find in verse number three, it says

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
and behold, seven other kind came up after them

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
out of the river, ill-favored and lean flesh

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000
and stood by the other kind upon the brink of the river.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000
The Bible tells us in verse number four

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
that the ill-favored and lean flesh kind

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
did eat up the seven well-favored and fat kind

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
and then it says, so Pharaoh awoke.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
It's more like a nightmare than a dream, right?

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
And he sees what's taking place, he's had this dream

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000
and he awakes from this dream

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
and the Bible says that he slept again in verse number five

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
and he dreamed the second time.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Now this next dream, the Bible says

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
that there were seven ears of corn came up

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
upon one stalk, rank and good

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
and behold, seven thin ears and blasted

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
with the east wind sprung up after them

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
and the Bible tells us in verse number seven

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
that the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
and full ears and Pharaoh awoke

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
and behold, it was a dream

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
and no doubt as we look at these first seven verses

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
and we see these two dreams that Pharaoh had

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
in this one night, it reminds or it provides for us

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
this uncertain situation.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Verse eight gives us great insight to what's taking place

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
but we find that that first dream

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
as recorded in verses one through four,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
the seven is repeated in both dreams

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
and we see there in the first dream

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
that there were seven well-favored kind and fat-fleshed

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
and then the Bible tells us that there were seven

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
that were other, that were ill-favored and lean-fleshed

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
and then the truth of the second dream

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
is that there were seven ears that came up

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000
according to verse number one

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
that on one stalk, rank and good

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
followed by the seven thin ears

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
that were blasted with the east wind

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
and they sprung up after them

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
and the Bible tells us that he awoke after the first dream,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
he awoke after the second dream

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000
and then in verse number eight,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
the Bible fast-forwards to the morning.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
I don't know about you if you ever had a dream,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
you ever dream and you think about,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
man, I can't remember the dream that I had and what have you.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Well, Pharaoh remembered these dreams

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
and we understand that God has given us

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
the complete canon of scripture

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
and God is not communicating to you and I today

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
through dreams and visions

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
but we find that in this particular time of human history

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
that God was communicating to Pharaoh through these dreams

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
and we find that it would be interpreted by Joseph

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
but notice in the morning, Pharaoh remembers the dreams.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000
The Bible says in verse number eight

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
that his spirit was troubled.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
This uncertain situation led to an unsettled leader.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
He's the leader of Egypt.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Think about the power that Pharaoh has.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
You think about even in chapter number 40

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000
with the butler and the baker,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.000
they offended the Pharaoh.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
He has them cast into prison.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
One then is restored to his butlership

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
but the baker is put to death.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000
He is sentenced to death

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
and we see the power that Pharaoh has

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
but yet the Bible tells us that his spirit was troubled.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
He was an unsettled leader.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
The thoughts that would permeate his mind

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
after these dreams that he had,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
they caused him to be unsettled.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.220
unsettled to be that his spirit was troubled.

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:04.960
We find that the Bible then tells us

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:07.079
that he took action in verse number eight

00:10:07.079 --> 00:10:09.420
and he did what he always did.

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:12.520
No doubt this was something that he would have had dreams

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:13.359
in the past.

00:10:13.359 --> 00:10:15.399
No doubt these people that are referenced in verse number

00:10:15.399 --> 00:10:18.000
eight would have been beckoned at various times

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.040
during his time of leadership and reign.

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:24.440
And this is something that was just kind of his response.

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:27.000
It was a natural response to what had occurred.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.200
He had these dreams, he didn't understand them.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.000
So what does he do when his spirit is troubled?

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.180
The Bible says in verse number eight

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:33.560
that he sent and called.

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:37.680
Notice the Bible says for all the magicians of Egypt.

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.159
The Bible continues and says this,

00:10:39.159 --> 00:10:42.080
and all the wise men thereof.

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:44.880
And Pharaoh told them his dream.

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.279
Again, I believe that this was something

00:10:46.279 --> 00:10:48.720
that was probably a common practice.

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.360
It was a situation in which these men,

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:52.419
these magicians and these wise men

00:10:52.419 --> 00:10:53.880
that are mentioned in verse number eight,

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:58.319
they would have received at various times similar requests.

00:10:58.319 --> 00:11:00.200
And we find that Pharaoh brings them in.

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:03.200
Can you see in your mind's eye this evening,

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.639
the picture, the event as it unfolds.

00:11:05.639 --> 00:11:10.000
Pharaoh really a kind of a restless night's sleep

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.879
with these two dreams and he's troubled.

00:11:12.879 --> 00:11:15.400
The Bible says his spirit was troubled.

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:18.319
And in the morning, when his spirit is troubled,

00:11:18.319 --> 00:11:20.239
he's unsettled as a leader.

00:11:20.239 --> 00:11:22.620
He calls for all of the magicians.

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:25.080
He calls for all of the wise men.

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:27.879
And what do you think his expectation was?

00:11:28.639 --> 00:11:30.480
Well, no doubt he was expecting

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:33.839
that as he would reveal to these wise men,

00:11:33.839 --> 00:11:37.519
to these magicians, when he would provide for them

00:11:37.519 --> 00:11:40.639
the information with regard to his dream,

00:11:40.639 --> 00:11:44.480
that they would provide to him an interpretation.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:45.839
That was his expectation.

00:11:45.839 --> 00:11:47.360
That's why he gathered them together.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.940
That's why he thought this is going to cause my spirit

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:52.419
to no longer be troubled.

00:11:52.419 --> 00:11:55.360
This is going to give me some understanding.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:58.519
And so he told them his dream,

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:01.559
but the verse ends in verse number eight,

00:12:01.559 --> 00:12:06.559
but there was none, none that could interpret them

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:08.759
unto Pharaoh.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.839
You think about his expectation.

00:12:11.839 --> 00:12:14.240
Do you think, I mean, he's a man that was

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:18.240
an uncertain situation that led to an unsettled leader.

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:21.679
He brings these men in, he tells them the dream,

00:12:21.679 --> 00:12:23.800
and then there's no answer.

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.240
Man, can you imagine?

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:27.080
I mean, it's a rough day.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.199
It's a troubled leader.

00:12:28.199 --> 00:12:29.919
It's a difficult situation.

00:12:29.919 --> 00:12:32.559
And we find that the Bible says that he called

00:12:32.559 --> 00:12:36.919
for all the magicians of Egypt and all the wise men thereof,

00:12:36.919 --> 00:12:39.679
but the Bible tells us that there was none

00:12:39.679 --> 00:12:41.559
that could interpret.

00:12:41.559 --> 00:12:43.520
And we begin to see what God is doing

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:46.199
and how God is moving, and we begin to understand

00:12:46.199 --> 00:12:49.580
the events, again, we're familiar with the life of Joseph.

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:51.720
Many of us have read the book of Genesis.

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.919
We've read the chapters in which we're studying,

00:12:53.919 --> 00:12:56.639
but I hope this evening that even the familiar nature

00:12:56.639 --> 00:12:58.679
of this particular text of Scripture,

00:12:58.679 --> 00:13:00.360
that we would pay close attention

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:02.160
and that God would help us tonight

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:05.759
to understand that Joseph was in a place

00:13:05.759 --> 00:13:09.179
where God was going to use him for God's honor

00:13:09.179 --> 00:13:10.639
and for God's glory.

00:13:10.639 --> 00:13:13.080
The Bible tells us of this uncertain situation,

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:16.320
but it's followed in verses nine through 15, number two,

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:19.360
with an urgent call, with an urgent call.

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:20.839
The Bible says this in verse number nine,

00:13:20.839 --> 00:13:23.559
and then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying,

00:13:23.559 --> 00:13:25.559
I do remember my faults this day.

00:13:25.559 --> 00:13:27.559
Now, isn't that interesting that the chief butler

00:13:27.559 --> 00:13:30.000
at this particular time, two years had passed,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.039
and all of a sudden, all of these magicians,

00:13:32.039 --> 00:13:35.279
all of these wise men are gathered,

00:13:35.279 --> 00:13:36.839
and Pharaoh shares his dream,

00:13:36.839 --> 00:13:38.639
and there's none that can interpret,

00:13:38.639 --> 00:13:41.720
and then the butler comes up to the plate, so to speak,

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:45.080
and he says to Pharaoh, I remember my faults this day.

00:13:46.679 --> 00:13:48.660
He says, Pharaoh was wroth with his servants

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:50.759
in verse number 10, and put me in ward,

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:52.419
and the captain of the guard's house,

00:13:52.419 --> 00:13:54.440
both me and the chief baker.

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:56.720
Now, this was two years had passed.

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:59.679
According to the start of chapter 41 in verse number one,

00:13:59.679 --> 00:14:02.960
two years had passed, and so now, this urgent call

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:04.559
that we're going to see that takes place

00:14:04.559 --> 00:14:06.479
within the midst of these verses,

00:14:06.479 --> 00:14:09.520
it begins with the butler remembering

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:11.360
what had taken place.

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:14.119
All of a sudden, he remembers, and he begins to rehearse.

00:14:14.119 --> 00:14:16.399
He's sharing with Pharaoh about the events

00:14:16.399 --> 00:14:18.679
that had led up to both he and the baker

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:22.320
being put in ward, being the captain of the guard's house,

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.279
and the Bible tells us in verse number 11

00:14:24.279 --> 00:14:27.920
that the butler says, we, he and the baker,

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:31.079
we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he.

00:14:31.079 --> 00:14:34.839
He dreamed each man according to the interpretation

00:14:34.839 --> 00:14:35.720
of his dream.

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:39.359
Notice in verse 12, and there was there with us

00:14:39.359 --> 00:14:41.600
a young man in Hebrew.

00:14:42.519 --> 00:14:44.079
I want you to just pause for a moment

00:14:44.079 --> 00:14:46.519
and consider the truth of verse number 12.

00:14:46.519 --> 00:14:50.040
How did this man, Joseph, get to that place?

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:51.399
There are a lot of things that we would say

00:14:51.399 --> 00:14:56.399
are unfortunate circumstances, unfortunate events.

00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:00.079
I mean, he was, his brothers were gonna kill him.

00:15:01.279 --> 00:15:03.200
His brothers decided, no, let's not kill him,

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:06.359
let's sell him into slavery, right?

00:15:06.359 --> 00:15:08.720
We could say, oh, man, that's unfortunate.

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:11.239
We could look at that and say, as some,

00:15:11.239 --> 00:15:14.359
as we look at events and just happenings in our lives,

00:15:14.359 --> 00:15:17.440
woe is me, and this just isn't fair.

00:15:19.519 --> 00:15:22.559
He's in Potiphar's house, and he's lied about,

00:15:22.559 --> 00:15:25.279
falsely accused, placed into prison.

00:15:26.359 --> 00:15:28.239
But the Bible says that this butler,

00:15:28.239 --> 00:15:30.359
as he's speaking to Pharaoh, he says,

00:15:30.359 --> 00:15:34.640
there was there with us a young man in Hebrew.

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:37.640
Though Pharaoh may not have understood

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:40.359
all of the circumstances that led to Joseph

00:15:40.359 --> 00:15:43.040
being in that prison at the time

00:15:43.079 --> 00:15:45.160
the butler and baker were in that prison,

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:47.799
though the butler may not have understood

00:15:47.799 --> 00:15:50.600
every detail with regard to the circumstances

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:53.760
that led to that, I can and you can this evening

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:57.000
rest assured in knowing that God was at work.

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:00.720
See, the Bible tells us, and we know,

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:02.600
that all things work together for good,

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:04.320
to them who love God, to them who are the called

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:05.559
according to His purpose.

00:16:05.559 --> 00:16:07.760
And it doesn't say that all things are good,

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:09.920
that all things work together for good.

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:12.720
And I would say that we serve a God who is good,

00:16:13.399 --> 00:16:14.519
and He's good all of the time,

00:16:14.519 --> 00:16:17.640
and He has a plan, and He has a purpose.

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:19.480
And sometimes when the events,

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:21.959
when the circumstances of your life and my life

00:16:21.959 --> 00:16:24.880
are not what we desire, are not what we expect,

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:29.359
we can refuse to submit to the Lord,

00:16:29.359 --> 00:16:32.519
we can respond in an inappropriate way

00:16:32.519 --> 00:16:34.799
that leads us in a place where we're not able to see

00:16:34.799 --> 00:16:36.720
what God was planning to do.

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:39.480
The Bible says that there was a man there,

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:41.279
there was a young man in Hebrew,

00:16:41.279 --> 00:16:44.600
servant to the captain of the guard.

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:49.600
And we told him and he interpreted to us our dreams,

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:54.160
to each man according to his dream, he did interpret.

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:56.600
And it came to pass as he interpreted to us,

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:59.920
notice these three words, so it was.

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:03.200
So it was, me, he restored into my office

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.079
and him, he hanged.

00:17:06.079 --> 00:17:08.760
And so as this butler remembers and rehearses

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:11.239
the events that happened two years prior,

00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:12.920
we find that he's sharing this.

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:16.119
Now remember, the Pharaoh, he, when he had a dream,

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:18.959
he calls for the magicians, he calls for the wise men.

00:17:18.959 --> 00:17:21.160
Remember what it was said when those men,

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:24.279
the butler and the baker, when they were in the prison

00:17:24.279 --> 00:17:27.119
in verse number four of back in chapter number 40,

00:17:27.119 --> 00:17:29.279
the Bible says the captain of the guard charged Joseph

00:17:29.279 --> 00:17:31.000
with them and he served them and they continued

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.200
a season in ward.

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:34.880
Notice in verse number five, this is the original event

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:36.320
that the butler is speaking of now

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:37.760
when he stands before Pharaoh.

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:39.959
And they dreamed a dream, both of them,

00:17:39.959 --> 00:17:41.799
each man his dream in one night,

00:17:41.799 --> 00:17:44.320
each man according to the interpretation of his dream,

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:46.000
the butler and the baker, the king of Egypt,

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.920
which were bound in the prison.

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:51.040
And Joseph came in unto them in the morning

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:54.200
and looked upon them and they were sad.

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:56.519
And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him

00:17:56.519 --> 00:17:58.559
in the ward of his lord's house saying,

00:17:58.559 --> 00:18:00.600
wherefore look ye so sadly today?

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:02.279
Notice the Bible says in verse number eight,

00:18:02.279 --> 00:18:03.920
and they said unto him, we have dreamed a dream,

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:08.920
notice what they say, and there is no interpreter of it.

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:11.160
Who do you think they expected

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:13.399
that would interpret their dreams?

00:18:13.399 --> 00:18:15.959
The magicians and the wise men.

00:18:15.959 --> 00:18:17.640
This was the common practice,

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:19.440
this was how they dealt with things.

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:22.000
And so I want you to see the fullness of the picture here

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.239
and what's taking place.

00:18:23.239 --> 00:18:25.679
The butler and the baker, they were in prison,

00:18:25.679 --> 00:18:28.079
they were separated from those wise men,

00:18:28.079 --> 00:18:32.239
from those magicians that would typically interpret dreams.

00:18:32.239 --> 00:18:35.020
And so they were sad because there's no interpreter.

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:38.479
But Joseph, a man, a young man that's in Hebrew,

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:42.320
he says, tell me the dream and he interprets the dreams.

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:45.000
And so now we find that this butler

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.080
is sharing this information with Pharaoh.

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:48.799
Now Pharaoh's in a similar situation.

00:18:48.799 --> 00:18:51.760
No, he's not in prison, but he's had a dream

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:54.119
and he's called for all of the magicians

00:18:54.119 --> 00:18:57.559
and all of the wise men and no one can interpret.

00:18:57.559 --> 00:18:59.359
And so we find that this urgent call

00:18:59.359 --> 00:19:01.400
is recorded to us in verse number 14.

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:04.719
The Bible says, then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph.

00:19:04.719 --> 00:19:07.299
It's almost as if he had this perspective,

00:19:07.299 --> 00:19:08.140
I've heard enough.

00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:11.020
I mean, I had an expectation

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:13.700
that when I brought these magicians and these wise men in,

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:16.260
they would interpret the dream, but they could not.

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:18.140
There was none that could interpret them.

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:21.140
And then the butler shares, he rehearses what tooks place.

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:24.539
And it's as if the Pharaoh is saying, I need this man.

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:27.659
And the Bible says that Pharaoh sent and called Joseph

00:19:27.659 --> 00:19:30.820
and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon

00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:33.539
and he shaved himself and changed his raiment

00:19:33.539 --> 00:19:35.979
and came in unto Pharaoh.

00:19:35.979 --> 00:19:38.020
Now, can you imagine verse number 14?

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:40.059
I mean, he is just in prison.

00:19:40.059 --> 00:19:42.380
Again, we don't know all that Joseph was doing

00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:44.299
during those two full years.

00:19:44.299 --> 00:19:46.179
We believe as we would understand

00:19:46.179 --> 00:19:48.140
and look at the record that God gives us

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:51.919
that he was faithfully doing what he had always done.

00:19:51.919 --> 00:19:54.900
He was living in the very presence of God.

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:56.659
He was serving, he was ministering

00:19:56.659 --> 00:19:59.659
in whatever capacities he was able to do so.

00:19:59.659 --> 00:20:04.379
But think about the word coming to Joseph as he's there, hey, the Pharaoh wants to see

00:20:04.379 --> 00:20:05.379
you.

00:20:05.379 --> 00:20:06.859
That's big stuff.

00:20:06.859 --> 00:20:10.419
That's a big situation.

00:20:10.419 --> 00:20:15.099
And the Bible says that it, I've referenced that it's an urgent call because the Bible

00:20:15.099 --> 00:20:20.579
says in verse number 14 that they brought him notice hastily out of the dungeon.

00:20:20.579 --> 00:20:21.579
Hastily.

00:20:21.579 --> 00:20:26.419
But I want you to see that he shaved himself and he changed his raiment.

00:20:26.419 --> 00:20:30.219
That's kind of interesting, a side subject that we could talk about really, and so many

00:20:30.219 --> 00:20:35.379
people want to talk about in our society today, that the outward doesn't matter because God

00:20:35.379 --> 00:20:39.179
only sees the heart, but the reality is man can only see the outward.

00:20:39.179 --> 00:20:40.179
Amen?

00:20:40.179 --> 00:20:44.379
Yes, it's true that God sees the heart, but man can only see the outward.

00:20:44.379 --> 00:20:51.219
I can't see your heart, but what you show on the outside reflects your heart.

00:20:51.219 --> 00:20:53.219
And Joseph was going to go stand before Pharaoh.

00:20:53.219 --> 00:20:59.979
By the way, a heathen polytheistic man, and he shaved himself and changed his raiment.

00:20:59.979 --> 00:21:01.379
Amen?

00:21:01.379 --> 00:21:04.699
Not the subject of what we're dealing with tonight, but he wanted to present himself

00:21:04.699 --> 00:21:08.059
properly in the presence of that individual.

00:21:08.059 --> 00:21:10.879
Oh, there's so much that we could say.

00:21:10.879 --> 00:21:15.779
Notice in verse number 15, the Bible says this, and Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have

00:21:15.779 --> 00:21:22.099
dreamed a dream and there is none that can interpret it.

00:21:22.099 --> 00:21:31.299
And I have heard say of thee that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.

00:21:31.299 --> 00:21:34.139
Joseph answered Pharaoh saying, it is not in me.

00:21:34.139 --> 00:21:37.059
God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.

00:21:37.059 --> 00:21:40.059
As we look at verse 14 and 15, we see this urgent call.

00:21:40.059 --> 00:21:42.859
We see that Joseph is brought into the presence of Pharaoh.

00:21:42.859 --> 00:21:47.379
We see very quickly that there's an introduction that's given, and I want you to think about

00:21:47.379 --> 00:21:52.019
the pressure, if you will, of such a situation.

00:21:52.019 --> 00:21:54.779
Joseph's in prison.

00:21:54.779 --> 00:21:57.379
Pharaoh, great power.

00:21:57.379 --> 00:22:02.299
Egypt, the power of this nation.

00:22:02.299 --> 00:22:08.859
And Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, he brings Joseph into his presence and he says, I have

00:22:08.859 --> 00:22:12.739
dreamed a dream and no one can interpret it.

00:22:12.739 --> 00:22:16.099
But I hear that you can.

00:22:16.099 --> 00:22:17.539
High stakes.

00:22:17.539 --> 00:22:18.539
Pressure situation.

00:22:18.539 --> 00:22:23.659
I said this before, but it's worth repeating in this particular context.

00:22:23.659 --> 00:22:27.699
As we look at this situation, we see God's hand at work.

00:22:27.699 --> 00:22:30.819
God's timing is not always our timing.

00:22:30.819 --> 00:22:32.459
But God's timing is always right.

00:22:32.459 --> 00:22:38.099
See, there are times in which we're kind of, what's going on, like, let's hurry up.

00:22:38.099 --> 00:22:42.019
But God's timing is not our timing, but God's timing is always right.

00:22:42.019 --> 00:22:43.019
I've said it this way.

00:22:43.019 --> 00:22:46.859
As you look at this portion of Scripture, the two years that have passed led to a time

00:22:46.859 --> 00:22:50.039
in which Pharaoh had a dream and none could interpret.

00:22:50.039 --> 00:22:54.779
If the butler immediately upon being released from prison, remember the context of when

00:22:54.779 --> 00:22:56.179
he was released from prison.

00:22:56.179 --> 00:23:00.259
According to chapter number 40 and verse number 20, the Bible says, and it came to pass the

00:23:00.259 --> 00:23:06.319
third day, notice which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants.

00:23:06.319 --> 00:23:09.139
There was a lot of things going on during that period of time.

00:23:09.139 --> 00:23:13.859
That feast that was going on, I mean, all of the events and so on and so forth, and

00:23:13.859 --> 00:23:18.459
we find that if the butler in that moment of being released from prison, if he says

00:23:18.459 --> 00:23:23.819
to Pharaoh, hey, listen, there's a guy in prison that interpreted my dream.

00:23:23.819 --> 00:23:25.259
Pharaoh's got so many other things going on.

00:23:25.259 --> 00:23:26.259
It's his birthday.

00:23:26.259 --> 00:23:27.739
All of these festivities are going on.

00:23:27.739 --> 00:23:33.699
All of this fanfare, if you will, and he's the king of Egypt and all of this, plus he

00:23:33.699 --> 00:23:37.299
has magicians and he has wise men.

00:23:37.299 --> 00:23:41.059
Why does he need this Hebrew?

00:23:41.059 --> 00:23:46.759
Because in God's perfect time and God's timing is perfect, Pharaoh has a dream and there's

00:23:46.759 --> 00:23:49.499
none that can interpret.

00:23:49.499 --> 00:23:55.899
And at that very moment, the chief butler, he says, I remember, and he rehearses.

00:23:55.899 --> 00:23:58.979
And Pharaoh issues an urgent call.

00:23:58.979 --> 00:24:04.299
And now Joseph is in the very presence of Pharaoh and he's heard what Pharaoh has to

00:24:04.299 --> 00:24:09.299
say about this dream and receiving an interpretation.

00:24:09.299 --> 00:24:15.659
An uncertain situation led to an urgent call, which resulted in a unique opportunity.

00:24:15.659 --> 00:24:19.119
Number three, if you're taking notes, a unique opportunity.

00:24:19.119 --> 00:24:23.859
As we look in verses 16 through 32 this evening, as we look at these verses of Scripture, we

00:24:23.859 --> 00:24:28.299
find the unique opportunity that God gives to Joseph.

00:24:28.299 --> 00:24:32.279
Again, in verse number 16, the Bible says that Joseph answered Pharaoh.

00:24:32.279 --> 00:24:33.279
Notice the answer that he gives.

00:24:33.279 --> 00:24:35.259
It is not in me.

00:24:35.259 --> 00:24:37.459
God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.

00:24:37.619 --> 00:24:41.779
I'm thankful that Joseph, standing in the very presence of this world leader, of this

00:24:41.779 --> 00:24:44.819
powerful man, that he shares this truth.

00:24:44.819 --> 00:24:48.779
He proclaims a truth that it's not in me.

00:24:48.779 --> 00:24:54.759
He says this, that God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.

00:24:54.759 --> 00:24:58.699
We find that Joseph had great, just certainty.

00:24:58.699 --> 00:25:01.059
He was assured of, he was confident.

00:25:01.059 --> 00:25:06.659
He had this measure of confidence that God could interpret the dream, that he could give

00:25:06.659 --> 00:25:07.659
him the interpretation.

00:25:07.659 --> 00:25:12.539
In fact, he says it this way to the butler and the baker in verse 8 of chapter 40, do

00:25:12.539 --> 00:25:15.739
not interpretations belong to God.

00:25:15.739 --> 00:25:17.819
Tell me them, I pray you.

00:25:17.819 --> 00:25:23.079
And so Joseph understood that it was not in him, but he understood that he had a responsibility

00:25:23.079 --> 00:25:24.819
to proclaim the truth.

00:25:24.819 --> 00:25:30.019
Listen, at this moment, as I think about what's unfolding in Joseph's life and what's taking

00:25:30.019 --> 00:25:34.419
place, it could be very easy for Joseph to be like, yep, that's right, I can interpret

00:25:34.419 --> 00:25:35.419
your dreams.

00:25:35.419 --> 00:25:41.779
What are you going to do for me if I interpret your dream?

00:25:41.779 --> 00:25:44.739
But Joseph says it's not in me.

00:25:44.739 --> 00:25:45.739
It's not in me.

00:25:45.739 --> 00:25:51.219
See, what I'd like to understand as we look at verse number 16 this evening, is that Joseph

00:25:51.219 --> 00:25:55.779
was a man that even in this unique opportunity that was presented to him, he was not trying

00:25:55.779 --> 00:25:59.259
to gain for himself.

00:25:59.259 --> 00:26:03.459
He was in a situation where he's in prison, falsely accused.

00:26:03.499 --> 00:26:06.939
He's not sitting there saying to Pharaoh, well listen, let me tell you about my situation

00:26:06.939 --> 00:26:12.539
first, and if you can help me out of my situation, then maybe I'll help you with your dream.

00:26:12.539 --> 00:26:16.579
I'm being a little festitious this evening, but the reality is that sometimes when we

00:26:16.579 --> 00:26:21.619
have circumstances and situations in our life, we might not take the opportunity to

00:26:21.619 --> 00:26:27.059
ensure that God alone gets the glory.

00:26:27.059 --> 00:26:33.259
Pharaoh says, the butler says, even though the butler heard that Joseph said that dreams

00:26:33.259 --> 00:26:39.859
and interpretations belong to God, the butler says that he interpreted to us our dreams

00:26:39.859 --> 00:26:46.779
in verse number 12, and so we find that Pharaoh has the understanding that you can understand

00:26:46.779 --> 00:26:47.779
a dream.

00:26:47.779 --> 00:26:52.619
And Joseph immediately says, it's not in me.

00:26:52.619 --> 00:26:55.339
God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.

00:26:55.339 --> 00:27:02.159
Listen, when we're only concerned with God receiving the glory, it's amazing what opportunities

00:27:02.159 --> 00:27:04.519
God will give us.

00:27:04.519 --> 00:27:11.839
When we are singularly, solely, only concerned with God receiving the glory.

00:27:11.839 --> 00:27:15.839
Joseph didn't know that through in providing an interpretation for the dream, it was going

00:27:15.839 --> 00:27:18.119
to change his circumstances.

00:27:18.119 --> 00:27:24.599
He had no assurance that if he interpreted this dream, that it would provide him an escape,

00:27:24.599 --> 00:27:25.599
that he would have some...

00:27:25.599 --> 00:27:27.639
No, he had no assurance of that.

00:27:28.639 --> 00:27:30.639
But you know what he was concerned about?

00:27:30.639 --> 00:27:32.839
God being glorified.

00:27:32.839 --> 00:27:34.039
God being glorified.

00:27:34.039 --> 00:27:37.599
He wasn't really concerned about his circumstances changing.

00:27:37.599 --> 00:27:42.799
You know what I'm fearful of as I look at my own life?

00:27:42.799 --> 00:27:49.039
And I believe this evening, if we would be honest, so often we are guilty of desiring

00:27:49.039 --> 00:27:54.079
that we would have circumstances that are favorable.

00:27:54.079 --> 00:27:58.079
I'm the first one to admit, I like for things to be comfortable.

00:27:58.079 --> 00:28:01.119
I don't like problems.

00:28:01.119 --> 00:28:04.839
I really don't.

00:28:04.839 --> 00:28:11.599
But when we're more concerned for God's glory than our own comfort, then God can do something.

00:28:11.599 --> 00:28:14.719
Then God can work.

00:28:14.719 --> 00:28:20.039
So often I feel like we could be guilty of being more concerned about our own comfort

00:28:20.159 --> 00:28:25.639
that we miss opportunities for God to be exalted because our singular focus is not for him

00:28:25.639 --> 00:28:26.639
to be exalted.

00:28:26.639 --> 00:28:28.719
Does that make sense tonight?

00:28:28.719 --> 00:28:35.839
And we find that Joseph, in this moment, when the butler says, he interpreted, and Pharaoh

00:28:35.839 --> 00:28:40.279
says, I understand that you can interpret, that you understand dreams, and Joseph is

00:28:40.279 --> 00:28:47.119
standing there before this world leader and says, it's not in me.

00:28:47.119 --> 00:28:49.959
It's not in me.

00:28:49.959 --> 00:28:53.319
God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.

00:28:53.319 --> 00:28:59.079
It reminds me of what John the Baptist would say so long later, he must increase, I must

00:28:59.079 --> 00:29:00.879
decrease.

00:29:00.879 --> 00:29:03.479
Joseph wasn't looking for a change of circumstances.

00:29:03.479 --> 00:29:06.239
He was looking for God to be glorified.

00:29:06.239 --> 00:29:10.239
We find that, yes, as we study through the portion of Scripture that Joseph's circumstances

00:29:10.239 --> 00:29:16.799
will change, but I believe this evening if his singular motivation was on a campaign

00:29:16.799 --> 00:29:20.919
to get out of prison, that this event would never be recorded the way that it is in our

00:29:20.919 --> 00:29:24.440
Bibles.

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:29.000
Look at verse 17, the Bible says, Pharaoh said unto Joseph, in my dream, behold, I stood

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.000
upon the bank of the river.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:35.519
And so in these next few verses, 17 through 24, Pharaoh rehearses the dreams for Joseph.

00:29:35.519 --> 00:29:41.759
Of course, we've read already of this as he shares these dreams in verses 2 through 7

00:29:41.759 --> 00:29:46.159
with those magicians and, excuse me, as God records for us what had happened and then

00:29:46.159 --> 00:29:49.879
the dreams that night and then he then shares them with the magicians.

00:29:49.879 --> 00:29:54.399
We find that Pharaoh now brings Joseph into his presence and he rehearses the dreams.

00:29:54.399 --> 00:29:59.440
It says in verse 17, Pharaoh said unto Joseph, in my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank

00:29:59.440 --> 00:29:59.799
of the river.

00:29:59.799 --> 00:30:02.959
And behold, there came up out of the river seven kind,

00:30:02.959 --> 00:30:05.959
fat-fleshed and well-favored, and they fed in a meadow.

00:30:05.959 --> 00:30:08.139
Behold, seven other kind came up after them,

00:30:08.139 --> 00:30:10.199
poor and very ill-favored and lean flesh,

00:30:10.199 --> 00:30:14.039
such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness.

00:30:14.039 --> 00:30:17.279
And the lean and the ill-favored kind

00:30:17.279 --> 00:30:20.479
did eat up the first seven fat kind.

00:30:20.479 --> 00:30:22.119
Verse 20, when they'd eaten them up,

00:30:22.119 --> 00:30:24.859
it could not be known that they had eaten them,

00:30:24.859 --> 00:30:28.259
but they were still ill-favored as at the beginning,

00:30:28.259 --> 00:30:29.419
so I awoke.

00:30:30.379 --> 00:30:31.859
And I saw my dream, and behold,

00:30:31.859 --> 00:30:34.339
seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good.

00:30:34.339 --> 00:30:36.019
And behold, seven ears withered thin

00:30:36.019 --> 00:30:38.899
and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them.

00:30:38.899 --> 00:30:41.599
And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears,

00:30:41.599 --> 00:30:43.379
and I told this unto the magicians,

00:30:43.379 --> 00:30:47.739
but there was none that could declare it to me.

00:30:47.739 --> 00:30:50.039
And so we find that as Pharaoh rehearses these dreams

00:30:50.039 --> 00:30:53.899
that Joseph is now hearing in verses 17 through 24,

00:30:53.899 --> 00:30:57.399
this record of these dreams that Pharaoh had,

00:30:57.399 --> 00:30:58.919
there's a little additional insight

00:30:58.919 --> 00:31:02.239
that is provided to us there in verse number 21,

00:31:02.239 --> 00:31:04.919
that even after those ill-favored kind

00:31:04.919 --> 00:31:06.519
ate up those fat flesh kind,

00:31:06.519 --> 00:31:09.399
that it was not noticeable, you could not tell,

00:31:09.399 --> 00:31:11.559
and they were just as they were at the beginning.

00:31:11.559 --> 00:31:14.719
And we find that he ends, Pharaoh ends,

00:31:14.719 --> 00:31:18.159
this conversation with Joseph or his part of it

00:31:18.159 --> 00:31:20.199
as rehearsing these dreams by telling him

00:31:20.199 --> 00:31:22.439
that I told this to the magicians,

00:31:22.439 --> 00:31:24.799
but there was none that could declare it to me.

00:31:25.799 --> 00:31:27.519
Notice Joseph's response.

00:31:28.439 --> 00:31:31.999
In verse 25, Joseph said unto Pharaoh,

00:31:31.999 --> 00:31:33.559
the dream of Pharaoh is won.

00:31:34.399 --> 00:31:37.839
Notice what he says, God hath showed Pharaoh

00:31:37.839 --> 00:31:40.999
what he is about to do.

00:31:42.079 --> 00:31:44.279
Understand that God is always at work.

00:31:45.999 --> 00:31:47.959
Listen, God's in control of everything.

00:31:48.879 --> 00:31:51.079
You ever hear somebody talk about mother nature?

00:31:51.079 --> 00:31:53.719
No, no, God is the creator and he's the sustainer.

00:31:54.079 --> 00:31:57.839
God sends the rain and God withholds the rain, amen.

00:31:57.839 --> 00:31:59.959
God's in control of everything.

00:31:59.959 --> 00:32:02.239
God is God.

00:32:02.239 --> 00:32:05.599
And we find that he says, God hath showed Pharaoh

00:32:05.599 --> 00:32:09.079
what he is about to do.

00:32:09.079 --> 00:32:11.039
By the way, that was gracious of God

00:32:12.559 --> 00:32:15.039
to show to Pharaoh what he was about to do.

00:32:15.039 --> 00:32:16.359
It was gracious.

00:32:16.359 --> 00:32:17.399
Can I tell you this evening

00:32:17.399 --> 00:32:19.359
that when we look at this portion of Scripture

00:32:19.359 --> 00:32:21.119
and we see what God is going to do,

00:32:21.119 --> 00:32:22.919
really in the next 14 years

00:32:22.919 --> 00:32:25.639
and their history and what's going on,

00:32:25.639 --> 00:32:28.359
God's revealing to Pharaoh in this dream

00:32:28.359 --> 00:32:30.999
what's going to take place over these next 14 years,

00:32:30.999 --> 00:32:33.399
I want you to understand that God has revealed to us

00:32:33.399 --> 00:32:35.039
his plans for the future as well.

00:32:36.159 --> 00:32:38.479
Listen, God is at work today.

00:32:38.479 --> 00:32:40.039
God is on his throne today.

00:32:40.039 --> 00:32:42.319
The Lord God omnipotent reigneth.

00:32:42.319 --> 00:32:43.279
He is in control.

00:32:43.279 --> 00:32:45.239
There's nothing that takes God by surprise.

00:32:45.239 --> 00:32:47.199
There's nothing that God is not aware of.

00:32:47.199 --> 00:32:49.319
We understand that God has a plan.

00:32:49.319 --> 00:32:51.359
And by the way, not only does God have a plan,

00:32:51.359 --> 00:32:54.679
but God's plan will come to pass.

00:32:54.679 --> 00:32:57.519
We're not going to keep God's plan from coming to pass.

00:32:57.519 --> 00:33:00.839
God's plan is going to come forth.

00:33:00.839 --> 00:33:02.079
It's going to come to pass.

00:33:02.079 --> 00:33:04.639
And so he tells him, God hath showed Pharaoh

00:33:04.639 --> 00:33:05.719
what he's about to do.

00:33:05.719 --> 00:33:09.239
Notice in verse 26, the seven good kind are seven years

00:33:09.239 --> 00:33:11.159
and the seven good ears are seven years.

00:33:11.159 --> 00:33:12.959
The dream is one.

00:33:12.959 --> 00:33:14.839
The seven thin and ill favored kind

00:33:14.839 --> 00:33:17.159
that came up after them are seven years

00:33:17.159 --> 00:33:19.919
and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind

00:33:19.919 --> 00:33:21.599
shall be seven years of famine.

00:33:21.599 --> 00:33:23.559
This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh,

00:33:23.559 --> 00:33:27.679
what God is about to do, he showeth unto Pharaoh.

00:33:27.679 --> 00:33:29.719
Behold, notice the verse 29,

00:33:29.719 --> 00:33:32.879
there comes seven years of great plenty

00:33:32.879 --> 00:33:36.159
throughout all the land of Egypt.

00:33:36.159 --> 00:33:39.839
Now that's a positive, that's welcomed news.

00:33:39.839 --> 00:33:42.279
There's going to be seven years.

00:33:42.279 --> 00:33:46.039
Notice it doesn't just say of plenty, but of great plenty.

00:33:46.039 --> 00:33:47.719
There's going to be blessing.

00:33:47.719 --> 00:33:50.239
I mean, there's going to be an abundance.

00:33:50.239 --> 00:33:52.919
And it says throughout all the land of Egypt,

00:33:52.919 --> 00:33:55.559
it says this, and there shall arise after them

00:33:55.559 --> 00:33:57.759
seven years of famine.

00:33:57.759 --> 00:33:59.319
Notice what it says in verse 30,

00:33:59.319 --> 00:34:04.319
and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt

00:34:04.479 --> 00:34:08.919
and the famine shall consume the land.

00:34:08.919 --> 00:34:10.799
Now that's a problem.

00:34:12.839 --> 00:34:15.679
But God is gracious in revealing what's going to happen

00:34:16.319 --> 00:34:17.319
in these next 14 years.

00:34:17.319 --> 00:34:19.919
In verse 31, the Bible says the plenty

00:34:19.919 --> 00:34:21.319
shall not be known in the land

00:34:21.319 --> 00:34:23.119
by reason of the famine following,

00:34:23.119 --> 00:34:26.159
for it shall be very grievous.

00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:27.759
The Bible said of the years of plenty

00:34:27.759 --> 00:34:30.199
that it shall be, according to verse 29,

00:34:30.199 --> 00:34:33.239
great plenty, seven years of great plenty.

00:34:33.239 --> 00:34:35.879
But we find that that famine, those seven years of famine,

00:34:35.879 --> 00:34:40.000
at the end of verse 31 is described as being very grievous.

00:34:41.039 --> 00:34:45.359
And for that, the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice.

00:34:46.079 --> 00:34:48.440
And the reason it's doubled is because the thing,

00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:51.440
notice what it says, is established by God,

00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:56.440
and God will shortly bring it to pass.

00:34:56.639 --> 00:34:58.399
The thing is established by God.

00:34:58.399 --> 00:35:00.000
This is what God is going to do.

00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:03.959
We find that God is going to bring it to pass,

00:35:03.959 --> 00:35:05.479
notice the Bible says shortly.

00:35:05.479 --> 00:35:07.440
And so we think about these seven years of plenty,

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:09.000
what happens oftentimes,

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.359
what's the human tendency in times of plenty?

00:35:12.479 --> 00:35:16.679
Live large, right, am I not right?

00:35:17.759 --> 00:35:18.839
There's years of plenty,

00:35:18.839 --> 00:35:21.039
and I understand that there's some people,

00:35:21.039 --> 00:35:23.839
I'm not talking about across the board 100%,

00:35:23.839 --> 00:35:25.879
but I'm saying generally speaking,

00:35:25.879 --> 00:35:28.279
when there's times of plenty,

00:35:28.279 --> 00:35:30.720
there's times of extravagance,

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:35.039
there's times of living large, enjoying life.

00:35:36.199 --> 00:35:40.559
No thought of that plenty might not continue, right?

00:35:40.879 --> 00:35:42.839
That's the typical human behavior.

00:35:43.959 --> 00:35:46.720
God in his grace and his mercy

00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:49.199
is showing to Pharaoh, to the Egyptians,

00:35:49.199 --> 00:35:52.279
Joseph will be the one to interpret the dreams,

00:35:52.279 --> 00:35:55.799
but he's showing to them what he is going to bring to pass,

00:35:55.799 --> 00:35:58.239
what he is about to do.

00:35:58.239 --> 00:36:01.759
And we find that that dream, as Joseph says,

00:36:01.759 --> 00:36:03.919
it's one dream, yes, there were two, but it's one,

00:36:03.919 --> 00:36:06.359
and God doubled it to you

00:36:06.359 --> 00:36:09.559
because he's established these things, this thing,

00:36:09.559 --> 00:36:13.399
and he wants you to know he's going to bring it to pass.

00:36:13.399 --> 00:36:15.279
And so Joseph interprets the dreams.

00:36:15.279 --> 00:36:16.639
Next week, actually in two weeks,

00:36:16.639 --> 00:36:18.919
we'll look at the rest of chapter 41.

00:36:18.919 --> 00:36:20.440
It's a lengthy passage of scripture,

00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:22.720
but we'll go through the end of the chapter next week

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:26.359
and look at the position in which Joseph is promoted to.

00:36:26.359 --> 00:36:28.339
And of course, many of us are familiar with this,

00:36:28.339 --> 00:36:29.399
but I want us to focus,

00:36:29.399 --> 00:36:31.359
as we finish the message this evening,

00:36:31.359 --> 00:36:34.359
at really considering this unique opportunity.

00:36:34.359 --> 00:36:37.759
And where Joseph was at the beginning of chapter 41,

00:36:37.759 --> 00:36:42.199
to where he stands in verses 17 through 32,

00:36:42.199 --> 00:36:43.779
standing before Pharaoh,

00:36:43.779 --> 00:36:47.799
providing him with an interpretation for this dream,

00:36:47.799 --> 00:36:50.399
when all of the magicians and all of these wise men

00:36:50.399 --> 00:36:52.319
are kind of on the sidelines, so to speak,

00:36:52.319 --> 00:36:54.199
and they have nothing to offer,

00:36:54.199 --> 00:36:57.679
and yet Joseph is there with this unique opportunity.

00:36:57.679 --> 00:36:59.839
I believe this evening, as I mentioned,

00:36:59.839 --> 00:37:01.879
though Joseph was forgotten by the butler,

00:37:01.879 --> 00:37:04.000
God knew exactly where he was,

00:37:04.039 --> 00:37:07.799
and God's plan was coming to pass just as he had planned it.

00:37:07.799 --> 00:37:09.279
We find this evening that the Lord

00:37:09.279 --> 00:37:11.399
had a unique opportunity for Joseph,

00:37:11.399 --> 00:37:14.119
and I believe tonight that God has unique opportunities

00:37:14.119 --> 00:37:15.799
for you and I as well.

00:37:15.799 --> 00:37:19.839
God has opportunities for us, unique opportunities.

00:37:19.839 --> 00:37:21.919
And sometimes those unique opportunities

00:37:21.919 --> 00:37:24.239
are going to come through maybe,

00:37:24.239 --> 00:37:26.359
as we looked at this portion of scripture,

00:37:26.359 --> 00:37:29.919
maybe some uncertain situations that we face in life,

00:37:29.919 --> 00:37:32.559
maybe some uncertainties in our world today

00:37:32.559 --> 00:37:33.519
that are taking place,

00:37:33.519 --> 00:37:37.899
and we find that God has unique opportunities for us.

00:37:37.899 --> 00:37:40.119
Every opportunity isn't gonna look the same.

00:37:40.119 --> 00:37:42.599
It's not going to come packaged the same way,

00:37:42.599 --> 00:37:45.079
but I believe this evening that God wants to use

00:37:45.079 --> 00:37:48.879
each and every one of us for his honor and for his glory.

00:37:48.879 --> 00:37:50.319
Brother Don, we and I were talking

00:37:50.319 --> 00:37:51.639
before the service this evening.

00:37:51.639 --> 00:37:53.559
He's gonna be 91 in just a few weeks,

00:37:53.559 --> 00:37:54.559
and he said this, he said,

00:37:54.559 --> 00:37:55.599
I don't think about it often.

00:37:55.599 --> 00:37:57.079
I hope it's okay that I share this.

00:37:57.079 --> 00:37:58.199
He said, I don't think about it often,

00:37:58.199 --> 00:38:01.440
but sometimes I wonder, man, 91's a long time,

00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:02.319
and I'm still alive,

00:38:02.319 --> 00:38:05.559
and so many others die prior to that age.

00:38:05.559 --> 00:38:08.119
And I said, Brother Don, God has a plan for you.

00:38:08.119 --> 00:38:10.119
God's not done with you.

00:38:10.119 --> 00:38:11.119
You know what I believe tonight?

00:38:11.119 --> 00:38:14.440
When God's done with us, he's gonna take us home, amen?

00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:16.039
And I know that God's not done with us

00:38:16.039 --> 00:38:16.879
because we're still here,

00:38:16.879 --> 00:38:18.119
and see, he still has a purpose,

00:38:18.119 --> 00:38:20.399
and he still has a plan, and he's still working.

00:38:20.399 --> 00:38:22.179
And I think about these unique opportunities

00:38:22.179 --> 00:38:23.379
that God would give us,

00:38:23.379 --> 00:38:26.179
but if we're going to have these unique opportunities,

00:38:26.179 --> 00:38:28.839
if we're going to have the kind of opportunity,

00:38:28.839 --> 00:38:31.079
and I understand we're not gonna stand before a pharaoh

00:38:31.079 --> 00:38:32.479
and maybe interpret a dream,

00:38:32.479 --> 00:38:34.080
but we find this evening

00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:36.659
that these opportunities that we might have,

00:38:36.659 --> 00:38:40.760
we must not grow weary in the time of difficulty.

00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:42.320
We must not grow weary.

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:43.640
We must not give up.

00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:45.519
We must not throw in the towel.

00:38:45.519 --> 00:38:46.959
We must remain faithful.

00:38:46.959 --> 00:38:48.640
We must remain steadfast.

00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:51.619
We must recognize that God's timing is perfect,

00:38:51.619 --> 00:38:53.399
and at God's perfect time,

00:38:53.399 --> 00:38:57.679
that he will open the door that only he can open.

00:38:57.679 --> 00:39:00.739
You ever try to open a door that God hasn't opened?

00:39:00.739 --> 00:39:02.099
It's frustrating.

00:39:03.779 --> 00:39:05.179
You try to beat down a door,

00:39:05.179 --> 00:39:06.739
and you know what happens sometimes?

00:39:06.739 --> 00:39:08.500
Sometimes you can be successful,

00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:09.899
and then you regret it real quick

00:39:09.899 --> 00:39:10.899
after you get into the room,

00:39:10.899 --> 00:39:13.880
and you find out, well, man, I made a mess of this.

00:39:15.279 --> 00:39:18.260
So much better when you let God open the door,

00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:21.519
when you let God work as only he can work,

00:39:21.519 --> 00:39:24.779
and we find that those opportunities are going to come.

00:39:24.779 --> 00:39:26.659
Listen, I understand that it might not be

00:39:26.659 --> 00:39:29.479
like Joseph here in Genesis 41, that someone has a dream,

00:39:29.479 --> 00:39:31.279
but I understand there's a lot of people today

00:39:31.279 --> 00:39:33.119
in our world that don't know what's going on

00:39:33.119 --> 00:39:34.479
with all the things that are taking place

00:39:34.479 --> 00:39:35.440
in our world today.

00:39:36.679 --> 00:39:38.559
They have no clue whatsoever.

00:39:38.559 --> 00:39:40.820
There are a lot of people that are scared of death.

00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:43.779
I mentioned that this morning from Hebrews chapter number two.

00:39:43.779 --> 00:39:46.179
They have no clue as to what's going to happen.

00:39:46.179 --> 00:39:48.459
They have no idea when they take their final breath.

00:39:48.459 --> 00:39:50.859
Listen, we believe in the rapture.

00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:54.119
The trumpet of the Lord's gonna sound.

00:39:54.119 --> 00:39:56.179
We're gonna be raptured out of here.

00:39:56.179 --> 00:39:57.279
It's an imminent thing.

00:39:57.279 --> 00:40:00.080
It's going to begin the seven-year tribulation period.

00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:06.480
time that's going to be great tribulation here upon this earth, and we find that, listen,

00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:11.200
we have opportunity right now to tell people, hey, Jesus loves you.

00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:12.640
He died for you.

00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:13.840
He wants to save you.

00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:18.600
There are people that look at world events, they have no idea what's going on, but God's

00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:19.600
given us some insight.

00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:20.600
Why?

00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:22.880
Because He's given us this book.

00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:27.960
There's some answers that we have to the questions that people have in this world because we

00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:29.680
have the Bible.

00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:34.960
We have the Holy Spirit of God living within us, and we can give an answer to those that

00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:39.880
would ask us of the hope that lies within us, and we can have those opportunities.

00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:45.880
And this evening, as we consider this situation here with Joseph, and we understand all that

00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:50.440
has taken place, and we see this unique opportunity, we say, man, that's wonderful that he has

00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:51.800
this unique opportunity.

00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:55.800
Don't forget how it came to pass.

00:40:55.800 --> 00:41:01.720
Don't forget all of the, quote-unquote, unfortunate things that happened from our human perspective

00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:05.040
that led to this unique opportunity.

00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:09.920
When you're dealing with the circumstances in your life, you must rest assured that God

00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:12.960
is in control and that God has a plan.

00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:19.280
And we must not, we must not overlook the truth that we spent time trying to really

00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:21.600
hammer in this evening.

00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:27.760
We must not lose sight of that truth in verse number 16, and we must live our lives with

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:31.960
the perspective that God receives the glory.

00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:35.520
Joseph said, it is not in me.

00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:39.360
It is not in me.

00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:43.880
God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.

00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:48.680
He was troubled, but Joseph provides an interpretation.

00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:50.080
Joseph was there in that place.

00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:55.960
He would say to his brothers later, far later, am I not in the place of God?

00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:58.920
He understood that God was at work in his life.

00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:03.680
This evening, I don't know what opportunity God has for you, but I believe He does have

00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:06.200
an opportunity for you.

00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:09.680
And I believe that God wants to use you for His honor and for His glory.

00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:12.680
He wants to use me for His honor and for His glory.

00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:16.400
And if we just get to the place where it was not really about us, but it was all about

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:25.920
Him, and our singular, most focused concern would be that He alone would be glorified,

00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:29.760
God will give us opportunities.

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:36.160
Because our concern is not for us, but for His name to be exalted and magnified.

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:38.480
Joseph said, it is not in me.

00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:42.560
Oh, that we would seize the opportunities that God would give us.

00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:44.800
I believe that He has opportunities.

00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:49.520
We need to pray that God would keep us faithful, help us not to grow weary, and help us to

00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:54.320
be ready to seize those opportunities when they come that we would be used to bring honor

00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:57.960
and glory to His name and to His name alone.

00:42:57.960 --> 00:42:58.960
Let's pray.

00:42:58.960 --> 00:42:59.960
Father, we love You.

00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:00.960
We thank You for loving us.

00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:05.120
We thank You for the truth of this portion of Scripture in the book of Genesis and the

00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:07.120
events, the life of Joseph.

00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:14.560
And God, I pray that through studying these verses tonight, You would help us not only

00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:23.000
to understand the historical context, a testimony of Joseph's life, but God, would You help

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:29.320
us to rest in knowing that You have a plan for us as well, that You know where we are.

00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:33.880
Though Joseph was forgotten by the butler, You knew exactly where he was.

00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:36.520
You had him in exactly the place You wanted him.

00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:41.960
God, You gave him such unique opportunity to stand before the leader of the nation of

00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:46.320
Egypt in order to exalt Your name.

00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:50.080
God, I thank You for Joseph and for his testimony.

00:43:50.080 --> 00:44:00.240
And I pray that we would follow that pattern, that we would not desire to receive glory

00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:05.600
of ourselves, but all be about Christ.

00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:09.880
I pray that You'd give us unique opportunities, help us to seize them, Lord, help us to speak

00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:11.300
of Thee.

00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:16.780
We live in a world that's confused, a world that's hurting, a world that's searching.

00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:19.940
God, You've given us Your Word.

00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:26.180
God, I pray that You'd help us to have those opportunities, to be ready to give an answer

00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:27.740
to the hope that lieth within us.

00:44:27.740 --> 00:44:31.820
I pray that You'd help us, Lord, to be doers of the Word tonight, and we'll thank You for

00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:32.820
it.

00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:33.100
In Christ's name we pray.
