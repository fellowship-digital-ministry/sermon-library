WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.539
Covenant there's a little bit much to deal with all in one service

00:00:03.539 --> 00:00:10.039
So we're looking at the first five verses in Hebrews chapter number eight this morning. I certainly enjoy the book of Hebrews

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:16.239
It's been a tremendous blessing in my life. And of course in this calendar year on Sunday mornings preaching through the book

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:18.799
I know we haven't done it consistently every single week

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:25.459
But we have made our way through the first seven chapters and now embark on chapter number eight this morning

00:00:26.139 --> 00:00:30.100
Obviously our theme for the year looking unto Jesus and what a great

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:34.220
Encouragement that we receive in Hebrews chapter number 12, of course

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.819
we would understand some of that which is given in those first few verses of Hebrews chapter number 12 where

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.580
the believers are encouraged to

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:49.299
Run their race and in so doing to keep their eyes on our wonderful Savior

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:52.819
and the reality is that we have a wonderful Savior and

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.860
We understand that he lives that he rules that he reigns and we understand as we look at the book of Hebrews

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.880
And we look at all that's taking place really in the first 10 chapters

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.019
And then we get into some things in chapter 11 the Hall of Faith chapters

00:01:09.019 --> 00:01:14.139
We often refer to it as but as we make our way through the book of Hebrews and come to that 12th chapter

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:20.620
why is it that the believers would be encouraged to run their race and keep their eyes on Jesus because

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.819
He is superior he is better and

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:30.860
we've studied through these first seven chapters and we have discussed the fact that the Lord Jesus Christ is

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.940
Superior to what to everything and everyone. Amen

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.059
obviously the book of Hebrews deals with some things specifically and we've gone through those starting with the

00:01:40.339 --> 00:01:46.779
Prophets and the angels and Moses and Abraham and all of that. We're in the midst of the section of

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:53.300
The book of Hebrews where he's dealing with the superiority of the priesthood of the Lord Jesus Christ

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:59.940
Of course the believers that are being written to here in the book of Hebrews. They would have had a level of

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:04.459
Understanding of the Levitical we've often referred to it as the Aaronic priesthood

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:09.300
They would have had an understanding of what the roles and responsibilities were

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.539
of the priest in fact at the particular time of the writing the temple still stood and the

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:20.580
Offerings were still being made and these Jewish believers that were saved

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:23.779
That that had come out of that

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:31.380
Judaism now there's this thought of returning to Judaism and they're seeing all of those things and we find that the author is giving us

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.779
really in chapters 5 through 10

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:39.020
the truth of the superiority of Christ priesthood and

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:47.300
We understand as we've looked through the passages of Scripture that there are many references back to the Old Testament with regard to

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.820
several of those things that would have been

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:57.179
messianic prophecies and how they're fulfilled in the person of the Lord Jesus Christ and we understand that for the

00:02:57.899 --> 00:03:03.899
Jewish believers their attachment and their understanding to Moses to Abraham to the

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:11.860
priesthood and all of those things they would have been keenly aware of the the truths that are being presented and then the

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.259
author so

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:18.740
Adequately shows that our Savior is superior and what a blessing that is

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:22.940
Of course we think about as we enter into the eighth chapter notice in verse number one

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:26.779
The Bible says this now the things which we have spoken. This is the sum

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:35.539
We have such an high priest who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens a

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.779
minister of the sanctuary and of the true

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.020
Tabernacle, which the Lord pitched and not man

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:47.419
For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices

00:03:48.779 --> 00:03:50.779
Wherefore it is of necessity

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:56.380
That this man have somewhat also to offer who is this man

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:01.339
that's the Lord Jesus Christ that has been referred to verse number four for if he

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.300
Jesus were on earth

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:08.460
He should not be a priest seeing that there are priests that offer gifts

00:04:08.679 --> 00:04:15.220
according to the law who serve under the unto excuse me the example and shadow of

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:17.859
heavenly things as

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:22.579
Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:30.739
First see saith he that thou make all things according to the pattern showed to thee in

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:32.859
the Mount

00:04:32.859 --> 00:04:35.019
we find that the writer of

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:42.140
Hebrews now goes all the way back to the last several chapters of the book of Exodus and really we find in an Exodus

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.700
2829 and 39

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:51.619
The reference would be given to the the the priest details concerning the priest garments and their

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.420
consecration we understand that the service of the tabernacle of the priest is

00:04:56.619 --> 00:05:03.420
outlined throughout those last several chapters of the book of Exodus as God is giving Moses the

00:05:03.899 --> 00:05:10.380
instruction for the construction of the tabernacle and now we find that the writer is now

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.339
Referring to that tabernacle

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:20.380
we understand the tabernacle was replaced with the temple and we understand that during the reign of Solomon king of Israel that he

00:05:20.459 --> 00:05:27.179
Built that temple now during the reign of Saul and the reign of David. There was no temple

00:05:27.179 --> 00:05:34.619
there was still the tabernacle the Ark of the Covenant that would be in the Holy of Holies and we understand all of those things

00:05:34.619 --> 00:05:36.019
that had

00:05:36.019 --> 00:05:38.940
transpired for all of that generation and for many

00:05:39.859 --> 00:05:42.700
Generations you can read in the Old Testament you can see the

00:05:43.179 --> 00:05:48.619
Responsibilities and you can understand the truth with regard to the tabernacle. Then the temple is built

00:05:48.619 --> 00:05:52.540
It was in the heart of David to do so God said no

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:57.619
You're not permitted to do it, but your son will be responsible for building a temple

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.380
We understand that David prepared greatly

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:03.480
and all of the things that he did to have all of the

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:07.679
Materials prepared and ready for Solomon and what a glorious occasion

00:06:07.679 --> 00:06:13.200
It was when the nation of Israel under the leadership of Solomon completed the temple

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:19.040
And then of course they had worship there at the temple that temple would be destroyed

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:25.040
We understand that they come back if you study and read the books of Ezra and Nehemiah and when that

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:32.760
That remnant returned after the Babylonian captivity. What did they do? Not only did they repair the wall, but they restored

00:06:33.399 --> 00:06:40.359
Sacrifice there at the temple when we see those things taking place that temple as well was destroyed. We see there's a new temple

00:06:40.359 --> 00:06:46.720
That's here during the time of Jesus and during this time in which the book of Hebrews is written

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.799
Remember it was Jesus back

00:06:48.799 --> 00:06:49.700
You don't need to turn there

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:50.839
but in the book of John

00:06:50.839 --> 00:06:57.559
When he was speaking about the fact that he would go to the cross of Calvary and that he would rise from the dead

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:04.239
He said this in verse 19 of John 2 he said destroy this temple and in three days

00:07:04.239 --> 00:07:05.679
I will raise it up

00:07:05.679 --> 00:07:12.000
Then said the Jews forty and six years was this temple in building and wilt thou rear it up in three days?

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.279
But he Jesus spake of the temple of his body

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:22.640
We spent a number of weeks a few years ago on Wednesday evening

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:28.239
Studying all of the details with regard to the tabernacle and as we studied the tabernacle

00:07:28.239 --> 00:07:31.640
We understood that the tabernacle was a picture

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:39.119
It was a type and how that every detail within the tabernacle in some way is pointing to Jesus Christ

00:07:39.519 --> 00:07:45.079
We'll deal with some of those things as we go through here in Hebrews 8 and then again in Hebrews 9 as some of those things

00:07:45.079 --> 00:07:49.880
Are dealt with but we rejoice in the fact that as we come to this passage of Scripture

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:54.239
You notice in verse number 1 of chapter 8. It's where I've adopted the title this morning

00:07:54.239 --> 00:07:57.720
He says we have such and high priest

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:05.399
I've simply titled we have and high priest see the reality is that these people the Jewish believers

00:08:05.519 --> 00:08:09.880
They understood what it was to have a priest and they understood the responsibility of the priest

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:14.679
In fact the priests they daily ministered we read of that in Hebrews chapter number 10

00:08:14.679 --> 00:08:18.079
We read of it all throughout the Old Testament all of that

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:24.119
Sacrificial system and everything that was being done and how that they daily ministered and they were constantly

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:31.839
They're making those sacrifices when you think specifically about the tabernacle. There was only one entrance to the tabernacle

00:08:32.359 --> 00:08:35.880
And in that single entrance we saw we find

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:41.900
That it would help us to understand the New Testament truth that there's only one way to heaven

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:46.460
There's only one way that's Jesus Christ. I am the way the truth and the life

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:53.380
There's only one entrance into the tabernacle and when you entered through that gate you find yourself in the outer court

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:54.940
quote unquote as we refer to it

00:08:54.940 --> 00:09:01.820
But the very first thing that you come to is the brazen altar and in the brazen altar

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:04.859
You would find that there were sacrifices that were made

00:09:05.539 --> 00:09:10.659
Showing us again that the way to God has to be through a sacrifice

00:09:10.979 --> 00:09:15.500
It's required. And so of course Jesus Christ is that perfect sacrifice?

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:19.500
We'll get into this morning as we study these first five verses of Hebrews chapter number eight

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:23.659
But we understand this morning that our Savior lives

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:29.099
They understand what it was to have a priest to have a high priest and really the responsibility

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:34.020
They think about the Day of Atonement once a year when not only were there

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.299
Sacrifices daily at the brazen altar

00:09:36.299 --> 00:09:41.460
But on one day a year the high priest would go into the Holy of Holies

00:09:41.739 --> 00:09:48.979
Where it was that God's presence dwelt with the nation of Israel and they could only enter in once per year

00:09:49.099 --> 00:09:51.859
And when they entered they better have blood

00:09:52.859 --> 00:09:54.299
Amen

00:09:54.299 --> 00:10:00.140
They entered in and they did the the the service that they were responsible. They fulfilled

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:04.160
their responsibilities. At the end of chapter number seven, you find that in

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.940
verse number 27, it talks about the fact that they had to first offer for their

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:14.980
own sins. I'm thankful that Jesus, as the Son of God, He was sinless, He was just,

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:21.060
and the just died for the unjust. And we understand as we look at the

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:26.340
passage of Scripture that these priests, as they would understand the role and

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:32.260
responsibility these Jewish people so connected to this religious system that

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:38.700
now they're reminded we have in high priest and his name is Jesus. We have a

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:43.540
wonderful Savior. I think about that wonderful song and I know that it's

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:47.540
probably one of my favorite songs. It's number 184 in our hymnal.

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:53.980
Hallelujah, what a Savior. And the song says this, man of sorrows what a name for

00:10:53.980 --> 00:11:01.100
the Son of God who came. Ruined sinners to reclaim. Hallelujah, what a Savior.

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:09.220
Bearing shame and scoffing rude. In my place condemned He stood. Sealed my

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:19.580
pardon with His blood. Hallelujah, what a Savior. Guilty, vile, helpless we. Spotless

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:28.620
Lamb of God was He. Full atonement can it be. Hallelujah, what a Savior. Lifted up

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:36.580
was He to die. It is finished was His cry. Now in heaven exalted high. Hallelujah,

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:44.860
what a Savior. When He comes, our glorious King, all His ransomed home to bring. Then

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:51.740
anew this song will sing. Hallelujah, what a Savior. We have a wonderful Savior. He

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:56.300
is our high priest. And these believers needed to be reminded of this truth. I

00:11:56.300 --> 00:12:01.820
mentioned that really the truth of the superiority of Christ's

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:05.380
priesthood is really contained in chapters 5 through 10 of the book of

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:10.780
Hebrews, but we find that even before really digging into the subject in its

00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:16.940
entirety, that you begin to see references in chapters 2, 3, and 4 with

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:22.260
regard to the high priest and that we have that Jesus is our high priest.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:27.100
Notice in chapter number 2, if you turn back just a few pages there, notice in

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:31.900
verses 17 and 18 the Bible says, wherefore in all things that behooved

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:37.900
him to be made like unto his brethren that he might be a merciful and faithful

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:43.580
high priest in things pertaining to God to make reconciliation for the sins of

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:48.020
the people. For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:53.180
succor them that are tempted. In chapter number 3, in verse number 1, it says

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:58.860
wherefore holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the apostle

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:05.940
and high priest of our profession Christ Jesus. In chapter number 4, in verse

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:12.460
number 14, the Bible says, seeing then that we have a great high priest that

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:19.100
is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:22.740
for we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:28.220
our infirmities, but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin.

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:32.460
We get into chapter number 5 and we find that there's a reference in the

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:37.740
beginning of this portion with regard to the ministry and role of the priest

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:42.340
and the the understanding that the Jewish believers would have of their

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:47.940
that role and responsibility, and the writer of Hebrews presents the Lord

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:54.140
Jesus Christ as being our great high priest, and he lives, and we can rejoice

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:58.180
in that truth. Notice if you look back in Hebrews chapter number 8, just two

00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:04.420
thoughts this morning. Number one, our high priest ministers in a better place.

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:09.420
He ministers in a better place. Notice in verse number 1 and 2 of our text of

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:13.940
Scripture, the Bible says, now of the things which we have spoken, this is the

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:19.820
sum, we have such an high priest who is set on the right hand of the throne of

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:24.760
the majesty in the heavens, a minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:30.920
which the Lord pitched and not man. Notice as we kind of pick apart these

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:35.040
verses of Scripture, as we would consider the fact that our high priest

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:38.960
ministers in a better place, we find that it tells us in verse number 1 that he

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:45.040
is set on the right hand of the throne of the majesty in the heavens. Isn't that

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:49.480
wonderful? And it's interesting as you think about the truth of the Word of God

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:54.460
where the Bible tells us that our Savior, that He ascended to heaven, we

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:57.820
understand that He went to the cross of Calvary and we'll deal with that in just

00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:03.860
a few moments, but we understand that He did not stay in that tomb. He rose in

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:08.700
victory. We understand that He ascended to heaven and we find that the writer of

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:13.540
Hebrews is saying to these Jewish believers that we have a high priest and

00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:18.980
He's better and I want you to understand that He ministers in a better place. It's

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:23.780
not just this temple that you can see with your eyes, it's not this

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:30.580
temporal location, but He serves, He ministers, He's in, He's at the right

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:35.660
hand of the throne of the majesty in the heavens. Notice verse number 2. The Bible

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:41.360
refers to it as being the true tabernacle. I like that phraseology. He

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:49.660
then says this, which the Lord pitched and not man. Now if you have a level of

00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:52.620
understanding of the Bible and some of the things that I've already said by way

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:56.340
of introduction, you'd understand that He's talking about the tabernacle that

00:15:56.340 --> 00:16:00.620
was pitched by Moses. And you'd understand that as we look at the

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:06.780
passage of Scripture here and these Jewish believers, that they would hear as

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:12.020
they read this book that this high priest that we have, Jesus, the Son of

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:16.780
God, He's ministering at a better place and the writer says it's the true

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:22.420
tabernacle. It's not pitched by man, it was pitched by the Lord. If you run all

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:25.740
the way back to the book of Exodus, and for sake of time we won't do that, we

00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:31.260
find that the Old Testament tabernacle served as a shadow and it was made after

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:36.460
the pattern that was given to Moses. We understand that even as you look at

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:42.140
verse number 5 here in Hebrews 8, the Bible says, who serve unto the example

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:47.820
and shadow of heavenly things. Notice what the Bible continues to say here, as

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:54.780
Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle. For see,

00:16:54.780 --> 00:17:01.500
saith he, that's God, that thou, that's Moses, make all things according to the

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:07.860
pattern showed to thee in the mount. You might want to jot down in your notes

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:14.220
Exodus chapter 25 in verse number 40, Exodus chapter 26 in verse number 30. In

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:19.380
both of those passages of Scripture or verses of Scripture, we find that God

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:25.140
gives the instruction to Moses and God specifically tells Moses, you have to

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:32.300
follow the pattern, you can't deviate. Why? Because of what it typified, because of

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:37.580
the type, because of what the tabernacle was a type of, and we understand in

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:41.700
all of the offerings and all of those things how that they were a picture of

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:46.460
Messiah. We think about the children of Israel as they first left from Egypt and

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:51.180
they were delivered with a mighty hand, that tenth plague, the death of the

00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:55.100
firstborn, it was the Passover. And remember, they were to observe the

00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:59.980
Passover annually, not only to remind them of the fact that they were delivered

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:04.540
from Egyptian bondage, but to remind them that there was a Savior that would one

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:10.780
day come that would make the ultimate sacrifice. We find that here, as we would

00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:15.980
consider the Old Testament pattern in this tabernacle, we find that yes, it was

00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:20.980
Moses that God instructed and that pitched that tabernacle. If you read

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:26.260
through the latter parts of the book of Exodus, you come to read all of these

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:31.540
details and all of the specifics that are given with regard to the materials

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:39.140
and the dimensions. I mean, God is a God of order. God didn't just say to Moses,

00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:44.059
hey, go make a tabernacle. What is that? Like, what do you want me to do? No, God

00:18:44.059 --> 00:18:51.580
was extremely precise in the instruction that he gave because of the truth that

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:57.420
it was presenting and really revealing, not only pointing to Jesus Christ, but

00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:03.420
revealing the plan of redemption. We find that as we look at the tabernacle and we

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:08.020
understand all that had transpired, the instruction that was given, that God

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:13.859
raised up some men, Bezalel in particular, was one of those that was given this

00:19:13.859 --> 00:19:19.420
ability to craft and to make these things, these pieces of furniture that

00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:23.619
would find themselves in the tabernacle, and how that instruction was given. And

00:19:23.619 --> 00:19:27.739
you come to chapter number 40 of the book of Exodus and you find that the

00:19:27.739 --> 00:19:32.460
Bible records for us in that passage of Scripture how that they reared up the

00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:37.580
tabernacle for the very first time. But it's interesting, before they ever reared

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:42.220
up for the first time, you read in that passage of Scripture how that the Lord

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:47.260
gave specific instruction and how that Moses and the children of Israel obeyed

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:53.460
and did as they were commanded. They reared up that tabernacle and the glory

00:19:53.460 --> 00:20:00.980
of God filled that place. And here's what the writer is saying.

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:06.780
That was just a picture, that was just a shadow, that was just a type,

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:12.580
but our High Priest, he serves, he ministers in the true tabernacle,

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:17.780
the one that was not pitched by man, but the one that he himself pitched,

00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:23.080
the one in which he showed to Moses to follow the pattern.

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:25.080
It's an amazing truth.

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:29.080
We find that these Jewish believers that were struggling with

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:31.880
the thought of Judaism and returning to it,

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:35.880
and they see all of these things that are taking place at the temple,

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:37.380
we find that they're confronted,

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:40.080
no, no, we have a High Priest.

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:42.080
He is the great High Priest.

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:48.680
He's Jesus, and he serves, he ministers in a better place.

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:52.580
We find that at the resurrection of Jesus Christ,

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:55.180
that he conquered sin, death, and the grave.

00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:57.780
We're mindful that even before his resurrection,

00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:01.880
when you consider the time in which he was on the cross of Calvary,

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:05.680
and he said, it is finished.

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:08.780
Something amazing took place.

00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:11.980
The veil of the temple was rent in twain.

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:12.780
Amen?

00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:15.980
From the top to the bottom.

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:19.180
See, remember, as we would look at the shadow of the Old Testament,

00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:22.180
we think about the tabernacle, and then even into the temple,

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:24.380
and you would think about that holy of holies.

00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:27.180
Yes, there was the outer court that had the brazen altar,

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:31.480
and had the laver, but you would come to the holy place,

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:35.080
that there you would find that much of the ministry would take place,

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:38.380
but then that was separated from the holy of holies

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:43.280
that could only be entered on that one day a year, the day of atonement.

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:48.580
And you find that that veil that separated the holy place from the holy of holies,

00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:53.580
that it was rent in twain, showing that now access was available.

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:57.280
We'll deal with that as we get into chapters 9 and 10 in more detail,

00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:02.180
but we understand that when Jesus died on the cross of Calvary,

00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:06.980
He paid, He was our substitute, and then He rose from the dead.

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:12.880
Acts 1 as well as Luke 24 record for us the ascension of Jesus Christ,

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:17.680
and the Bible tells us in verse 2 that He is a minister of the sanctuary

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:23.980
and of the true tabernacle which the Lord pitched, and not man.

00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:26.280
We've read some of these verses already,

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:29.780
but you notice as I repeat in Hebrews 4 and verse number 14,

00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:33.780
the Bible says, seeing then that we have a great high priest

00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:37.680
that is passed into the heavens.

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:42.680
Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:46.680
See, the high priest, he could only enter into the holy of holies.

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:52.080
He could only pass through that veil, but Jesus entered into heaven.

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:55.380
We find that in chapter number 7, we studied this a few weeks ago,

00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:58.780
but in verse number 25, the Bible says at the end of that verse,

00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:03.980
seeing He ever liveth to make intercession for them.

00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:07.680
I'm so thankful that our Savior lives.

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:09.480
Hallelujah, what a Savior.

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:12.280
And He is our high priest.

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:14.880
Notice that as we look at the passage of Scripture,

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:18.780
not only does our high priest minister in a better place,

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:23.680
but number two, our high priest presented a better offering.

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:25.580
He presented a better offering.

00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:29.780
As we look at the passage, we come to verse number 3 in Hebrews chapter number 8,

00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:36.880
and the Bible says this, for every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices.

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:39.580
He dealt with this back in chapter number 5,

00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:42.580
when he talked about the fact that they were to bring those sacrifices.

00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:45.880
Notice in verse number 1 of Hebrews 5, the Bible says,

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:53.480
for every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God,

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:59.280
that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins.

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:01.880
In chapter 7, in verse number 27,

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:07.480
the Bible talks about how they would first offer for their own sins, then for the people's.

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:13.780
We find that as we go through the book of Hebrews and you enter into the 10th chapter,

00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:18.380
you find that the Bible would say this about these offerings.

00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:22.580
In verse number 1, it says, for the law having a shadow of good things to come,

00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:24.580
and not the very image of the things,

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:28.180
can never with those sacrifices which they offered,

00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:34.280
notice this, year by year continually, make the comers thereunto perfect.

00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:38.580
Notice it says, in verse number 3, but in those sacrifices,

00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:42.880
there is a remembrance again made of sins every year,

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:46.880
for it is not possible the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:49.480
Wherefore, when he cometh into the world, he sayeth,

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:53.580
sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared for me.

00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:55.780
Notice in verse number 11, the Bible says,

00:24:55.780 --> 00:25:00.980
and every priest standeth daily ministering and offering,

00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:08.680
notice what it says, oftentimes the same sacrifices which can never take away sins.

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:13.480
Why? Because it was pointing to Messiah who would one day come.

00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:19.380
As a reminder, that Jesus, the Messiah, all the way back in Genesis chapter 3,

00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:22.980
when you read of that prophecy that is given after the fall of man,

00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:26.980
we understand that God and His plan, as we'd read in Ephesians,

00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:30.080
as we'd understand as Peter reveals to us in 1 Peter,

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:32.680
that our Savior Jesus, the Son of God,

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:36.980
that He was the Lamb slain before the foundation of the world.

00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:40.480
That Jesus was the one that would come,

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:45.180
and all of those offerings and all those sacrifices that these priests would offer,

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:48.880
they were pointing to Messiah.

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:51.480
And we find that here in verse number 3,

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:55.380
this was the role and responsibility of these priests.

00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:58.380
Can I tell you, it was a busy job.

00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:03.080
It was a job that, if you look at the tabernacle and you look at all of the pieces of furniture,

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:06.580
you won't find a chair.

00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:09.080
There was never time to sit down.

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:12.080
There were constantly these offerings that were being made,

00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:15.780
and all of this stuff that was happening, and daily they were doing these things,

00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:17.880
they were fulfilling their responsibility.

00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:20.780
And so we find that it was the responsibility of the priest,

00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:25.580
of the high priest here as it's mentioned, to offer gifts and sacrifices,

00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:29.380
and therefore the logical conclusion would be this,

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:34.380
if that's what the high priest, if that's what the role is of these priests,

00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:38.980
then certainly it would be necessary for Jesus,

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:43.880
if He's our high priest, that He too would have an offering to present.

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:44.980
Amen?

00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:46.180
It has to be.

00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:48.780
You notice in verse number 3, notice the entirety of the verse,

00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:53.280
for every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices.

00:26:53.280 --> 00:27:04.080
Wherefore, it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:08.080
It wasn't just that it would be nice if He had an offering,

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:14.280
it was necessary, it was absolutely essential that He would have an offering to present.

00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:16.580
It's interesting that as you go into verse number 4,

00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:20.980
that the Bible reminds us of the truth that had been previously shared in chapter number 7,

00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:22.080
and the Bible says this,

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:26.780
for if He were on earth, He should not be a priest,

00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:30.880
seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law.

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:33.080
Why couldn't He be a priest on earth?

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:37.380
He was of the tribe of Judah, not of the tribe of Levi, right?

00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:39.380
We looked at that in chapter number 7,

00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:41.880
when the Bible tells us in verse number 14,

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:45.180
for it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Judah,

00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:50.780
of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.

00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:55.280
When you were a priest in the Old Testament, it wasn't that you volunteered to be a priest.

00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:56.880
You were in the tribe of Levi.

00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:01.680
That was the tribe that had been ordained and selected by God,

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:05.480
and we find that we speak of the Aaronic or the Levitical priesthood,

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:11.080
and that was understood, but Jesus, He was from the tribe of Judah.

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:15.380
If you're from the tribe of Judah, you could not be a priest.

00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:18.780
Kings came from the line of Judah.

00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:21.880
And we find that if you're a king, you could not be a priest.

00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:24.280
If you're a priest, you could not be a king.

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:28.480
We find that Jesus is prophet, priest, and king.

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:32.580
We find that there was example, as we find in the Old Testament,

00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:36.280
there were times in which the priests, they were vile.

00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:39.280
They were wicked. They didn't do as they should do.

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:43.180
There was a particular occasion in which Uzziah thought that he, as king,

00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:45.980
would go in and offer some incense.

00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:48.580
It was a bad decision.

00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:50.580
He became a leper.

00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:53.580
Jesus, if He were on earth, notice what it says in verse number four,

00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:56.780
if He were on earth, He should not be a priest,

00:28:56.780 --> 00:28:59.880
seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law.

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:05.080
But remember, in chapter number five,

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:07.680
and then all of chapter number seven,

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:12.980
the Bible presented the truth that the Messianic prophecy from the book of Psalms,

00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:16.480
that thou art a priest after the order of Melchizedek,

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:20.180
is fulfilled in the person of Jesus Christ.

00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:22.880
So He is able to make an offering. Why?

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:27.380
Not because He's of the tribe of Levi, but because He's after the order of Melchizedek.

00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:31.380
And the offering that He presents is a better offering. Why?

00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:35.880
Because He offered Himself. He offered Himself.

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:41.380
Notice, the Bible tells us it was necessary,

00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:43.780
it says it is of necessity,

00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:48.880
that this man have somewhat also to offer.

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:54.180
Notice in chapter number seven, in verse number 27,

00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:54.880
the Bible says,

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:57.980
who needeth not daily as those high priests.

00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:00.980
And so the contrast in the beginning of this verse is dealing with

00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:05.840
those offerings and sacrifices of the Aaronic Levitical priesthood it says who

00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:11.260
needeth not daily as those high priests to offer up sacrifice first for his own

00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:18.340
sins and then for the people's notice the latter part for this he Christ did

00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:28.380
once when he offered up himself he offered himself in chapter 9 look at a

00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:35.500
few verses here in this great chapter in verse number 14 let me read verses 11

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:39.900
through 14 the Bible says in verse number 11 but Christ being come in high

00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:46.140
priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not

00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:50.300
made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of

00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:55.420
goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place

00:30:55.420 --> 00:31:02.340
having obtained eternal redemption for us for if the blood of bulls and of

00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:06.060
goats and the ashes on a heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctified through

00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:10.820
the purifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood of Christ who through

00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:15.140
the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God purge your

00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:21.540
conscience from dead works to serve the living God in verse 26 the Bible says

00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:25.260
for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world but

00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:30.740
now once in the end of the world have he appeared to put away sin by the

00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:38.380
sacrifice of himself verse 28 so Christ was once offered to bear the sins of

00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:42.780
many and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without

00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:50.260
sin unto salvation I read for you verse number 11 of chapter 10 about the

00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:54.780
priest standing and ministering daily those same sacrifices which could never

00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:58.820
take away sin but you look at verse number 12 and the Bible says but this

00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:04.940
man speaking of our high priest the Lord Jesus Christ this man after he'd offered

00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:11.660
one sacrifice for sins notice what it says forever sat down on the right hand

00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:19.900
of God we speak about the high priest being our high priest we have an high

00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:24.300
priest the Lord Jesus Christ he ministers in a better place but we find

00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:30.220
that he presented a better offering he offered himself it's interesting as we

00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:33.540
think about the offering of himself and how that the Lord Jesus Christ

00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:38.940
willingly went to the cross of Calvary he says to his disciples in John chapter

00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:43.500
number 10 in that dialogue about him being the Good Shepherd and he talks

00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:47.980
about the fact that the Good Shepherd layeth down his life for the sheep in

00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:54.020
John chapter number 10 it's interesting that he not only tells us that he lays

00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:58.540
down his life for the sheep but he tells about the truth of the resurrection in

00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:03.380
chapter 10 in verse 17 it says therefore doth my father love me because I lay

00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:09.740
down my life that I might take it again no man taketh it from me but I lay it

00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:13.340
down of myself I have power to lay it down and I have power to take it again

00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:19.660
this commandment have I received of my father I'm so thankful that the Lord

00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:25.220
Jesus Christ our high priest our great high priest that he ministers in a

00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:29.340
better place but he presented a better offering and that he offered himself

00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:34.780
there's a perfect offering we often speak about the substitutionary atonement

00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:41.300
the fact that Jesus the Son of God that he hung in our place he was our

00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:47.220
substitute why did he have to die because sin had to be paid for the Bible

00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:51.260
tells us in Genesis chapter number three about sin entering into the world the

00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:55.700
Bible tells us in Romans chapter number five as it references that account of

00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:59.820
Adam and Eve in the garden in Genesis chapter number three that that's how sin

00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:05.780
entered and then sin is passed on to all men the the penalty death is passed on

00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:11.620
to all men for that all have sinned for the wages of death is or for the wages

00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:19.300
of sin is death and we understand that Jesus Christ God in flesh he went

00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:24.900
willingly to that old rugged cross he suffered great torment as you read

00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:29.540
through the gospel accounts and you read of all that he experienced and all that

00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:35.660
he dealt with we understand that he did that demonstrating to us his love he

00:34:35.660 --> 00:34:41.500
died for the sins of the world he died so that man could be reconciled to God

00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:49.260
see we were at enmity with God we were separated from God why because of our

00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:56.100
sin the Bible tells us that God hath made him Jesus to be sin for us who knew

00:34:56.100 --> 00:35:03.620
no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him it's not as

00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:07.700
Paul deals with in the book of Philippians it's not our own righteousness

00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:14.300
it's the righteousness of Christ that is imputed upon our account see he's the

00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:18.300
substitute he's we speak about the substitutionary atonement we understand

00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:25.140
that it satisfied the demands of death it satisfied the price for sin the

00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:30.740
precious sinless blood of Christ was the payment that was necessary and we find

00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:34.780
the Bible tells us as we read that passage of Scripture in Hebrews 9 in

00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:39.540
verse number 12 that what did that what did that sinless precious blood get

00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:47.020
eternal redemption for us Peter says that we're not redeemed with corruptible

00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:52.220
things he speaks about gold and silver he says no we're not redeemed with those

00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:58.580
things we're redeemed with the precious blood of Christ and so we think about

00:35:58.580 --> 00:36:03.540
this better offering how that Jesus Christ God in flesh that he presented

00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:11.820
himself that he offered himself but then he rose victoriously conquering sin

00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:19.260
death and the grave we find that he continueth ever in Hebrews 7 in verse

00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:24.020
number 24 the Bible says but this man speaking again of Jesus because he

00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:29.580
continueth ever hath an unchangeable priesthood see what happened the

00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:34.780
priest in the Old Testament the Aaronic priesthood man they died right part of

00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:39.220
the whole study as you look as the instruction is given to Moses and then

00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:43.580
to Joshua we see that it's an implement it in the life and ministry of Joshua

00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:47.580
with the cities of refuge they had to stay there until the death of the high

00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:54.340
priest and then they could leave our high priest the Lord Jesus Christ he

00:36:54.340 --> 00:37:02.100
continueth ever why because he conquered sin death and the grave we find that

00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:07.100
Paul would make this declaration in the passage of Scripture that we often refer

00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:12.340
to as the passage that is the the greatest with regard to the resurrection

00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:18.300
and the fact that because Jesus rose from the dead that we to have the hope

00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:24.700
the expectation of rising from the dead why because he's the firstfruits and

00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:32.340
Paul would finish that passage by saying Oh death where is thy sting Oh great

00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:39.140
where is thy victory the sting of death is sin the strength of sin is the law

00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:45.380
but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus

00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:52.660
Christ see as we think about the truth of Hebrews chapter 5 and I understand

00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:57.680
that we're living nearly you know 1950 years or whatever it is after the

00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:00.540
writing of the book of Hebrews and I understand that we're living in a

00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:04.860
different culture in a different time and all of those things and we don't see

00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:08.820
a temple we didn't come out of Judaism we weren't practicing those things but I

00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:12.940
want you to think about these Jewish believers being reminded and confronted

00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:18.420
with the truth that you have an high priest don't look at those things that

00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:23.780
are temporal that were a picture that were a shadow that followed a pattern

00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:30.780
you have a high priest his name is Jesus and he lives and he ministers in a

00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:34.980
better place and he presented a better offering and for us today as New

00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:40.300
Testament believers in the year 2020 we find that we're in this place that we

00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:47.060
say we serve a risen Savior we ought to live like it amen we ought to act like

00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:53.580
it as we live as we go through this life we understand I serve a risen Savior I

00:38:53.580 --> 00:39:02.500
am NOT serving some dead religion I'm not caught in some dead orthodoxy no I

00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:09.700
serve the King of Kings and Lord of Lords many songs have been written by

00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:15.620
people that have been overwhelmed with the thought of our Savior living in the

00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:20.900
impact that that ought to have on us as the children of God listen our God rules

00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:29.460
and reigns he's still on his throne amen we have a message to tell just as the

00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:35.460
writer of Hebrews says to these believers and of course being preserved

00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:41.620
for all of these years in the canon of Scripture we have an high priest what

00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:44.700
should I think about this truth that is given in these first five verses of

00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:47.940
course I mentioned already by way of introduction that as we finish chapter

00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:51.540
number eight next week we'll deal with the new covenant that is revealed in

00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:55.180
verses 6 through 13 really going back to Jeremiah we'll get into all of that next

00:39:55.300 --> 00:40:00.540
week as we finish chapter number eight but we understand that just has as it

00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:02.940
has been

00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:08.220
the case through the book of Hebrews, we find that the the author of Hebrews will

00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:15.940
share some truth and then further discuss and expound on that truth in a

00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:22.300
following chapter. In these two truths that are presented in the first few

00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:26.380
verses of chapter number eight, that our high priest ministers in a better place

00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:30.140
and that our high priest presented a better offering, we find that they're

00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:35.940
expounded upon in Hebrews 9 and Hebrews 10, and we'll enjoy studying those

00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:40.060
chapters. What great truth is given to us. I've picked some of those verses to

00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:44.460
share with you this morning. We'll dig into them entirely as we move through

00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:48.140
the book of Hebrews, but I want you to go to 1st John chapter 2 as we conclude

00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:53.360
this morning. In 1st John chapter number 2, the book of 1st John is written to

00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:58.180
believers. The book of 1st John is dealing with the fellowship that we have

00:40:58.180 --> 00:41:03.020
with Christ, and what a joy to know that we can have fellowship with our God. Why?

00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:08.280
Because of what Jesus did in reconciling, right? He's the mediator. He is the one

00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:13.400
that reconciles, and we come to the book of 1st John and we see this truth with

00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:17.740
regard to fellowship and so on and so forth, and as we think about the truth of

00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:22.020
Hebrews chapter number 5 that we have in high priest that ministers in a better

00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:26.940
place, that presented a better offering, I come to chapter number 2 of 1st John

00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:30.180
and I look at the first two verses and the Bible says this,

00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:38.900
My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. Now, we're

00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:44.220
supposed to sin less, amen? I mean, we're not going to ever reach a place of

00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:48.500
sinless perfection here upon this earth. I know there are some that propagated

00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:52.980
that idea years ago and some that still would hold to that truth, but the Bible

00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:55.620
reveals to us that we're not going to reach a place of

00:41:55.620 --> 00:42:00.300
sinless perfection here upon earth, but I'm thankful that one day when I meet my

00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:07.260
Savior face-to-face, when I'm in heaven, I will have no more sin, amen? But as we

00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:13.140
grow in our walk with the Lord, as we walk with Christ, as we walk in the

00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:17.340
Spirit so that we do not fulfill the lust of the flesh, we ought to sin less,

00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:26.340
amen? But we find that it says in verse number 1, and if any man sin, aren't you

00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:30.420
thankful for that? Because have you sinned since you've been saved? If you

00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:38.700
say no, you're lying, amen? And I just caught you in a sin, amen? Right? So if

00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:47.940
any man sin, notice we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the

00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:56.100
righteous, and He, Jesus Christ, our advocate, He is the propitiation for our

00:42:56.100 --> 00:43:00.620
sins. Now, we look at that word, we don't use it very often, it's a Bible word

00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:05.180
obviously, it speaks about the truth of being the satisfaction, but also the

00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:10.540
mercy seat really is the idea, and we think about the the Ark of the Covenant,

00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:14.500
really the Ark of the Covenant is the Ark of Judgment without the mercy seat.

00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:22.580
When that mercy seat is placed upon that Ark, we find it becomes a mercy, an altar

00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:27.580
of mercy, and we find here the Bible says that He, Jesus Christ, not only is

00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:32.180
He our advocate with the Father, but He is the propitiation, notice, for our sins,

00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:41.220
and not for our sins only, but also for the sins of the whole world. This morning,

00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:46.180
if you're a believer, if you've trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal

00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:50.300
Savior, if you would say today that there was a time in my life when I understood

00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:55.220
that I was a sinner, because of my sin there was a price that had to be paid,

00:43:55.220 --> 00:44:00.660
and that price is death, the penalty of sin, the wage of sin is death, but I

00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:05.620
understood that Jesus Christ, God in flesh, He loved me, and He died for me,

00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:10.980
and He offered me a gift, and that gift is eternal life through Jesus Christ, our

00:44:10.980 --> 00:44:17.460
Lord. The Bible says that if any man, if we call upon the name of the Lord,

00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:21.680
whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. You say, pastor,

00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:24.780
I've called upon the name of the Lord, I've been saved, can I encourage you this

00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:29.980
morning? You're having a high priest, and he's ministering in a better place, he's

00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:35.820
presented a better offering, he ever liveth to make intercession for us, he

00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:43.140
is our advocate, he is the propitiation for our sins, but not for ours only, but

00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:46.180
also the sins of the whole world. Maybe this morning there's someone that's

00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:50.420
never trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal Savior. You say, the honest

00:44:50.420 --> 00:44:53.660
truth this morning is that if I were to die today I have no idea what would

00:44:53.660 --> 00:44:58.900
happen. I'd like to think I'd go to heaven, most people don't like to think

00:44:58.900 --> 00:45:07.740
about going to hell, amen? I'd like to think, I hope so, I think so, maybe, can I

00:45:07.740 --> 00:45:12.100
tell you that you can know for sure that heaven is your home? It's not because of

00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:16.580
anything you've done, it's because of the offering that Christ made when he

00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:22.900
offered himself, because he said, it is finished. If there's nothing you can do,

00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:26.860
the Bible says, for by grace are you saved through faith, amen? Not of works lest

00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:32.580
any man should boast. We understand that Jesus paid it all, that he made the way

00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:38.180
for mankind to be redeemed, and this morning maybe someone here locally, maybe

00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:42.060
somebody that's watching live stream, you've never been born again. Can I tell

00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:48.820
you that the Lord Jesus Christ, he offered himself to pay for your sin, so

00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:52.220
you could have eternal life. You say, well that's nice, but I'm gonna keep trying my

00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:57.300
way, I'm gonna keep trying, just try to be a good person, I'm gonna try to do

00:45:57.300 --> 00:46:01.340
this, and I'm gonna just try to turn a new leaf. Can I tell you on the authority

00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:05.980
of the Word of God, there's only one way to get to heaven, and it's through the

00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:12.700
Lord Jesus Christ. The blood that he shed on the cross of Calvary, the only payment

00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:20.180
that is valid for your sin, and for my sin, is the blood of Jesus Christ. Nothing

00:46:20.180 --> 00:46:30.100
else is accepted, nothing, amen? Peter, as he preached, and he in Acts chapter

00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:33.700
before, I almost said Hebrews, he wasn't preaching in Hebrews, amen? In Acts

00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:36.980
chapter number four, there's a great miracle that was recorded in Acts chapter

00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:44.100
number three. That man at the gate, beautiful, he was healed. We find that

00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:49.900
Peter is preaching in Acts chapter number four, he said, if you're asking by what

00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:54.580
name this man has been made whole, he helps them understand, listen, it's not in the

00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:59.340
name of Peter or John, it's the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth. And then he

00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:05.340
says this, and there is no other name under heaven, given among men, whereby we

00:47:05.340 --> 00:47:11.140
must be saved. What was Peter saying? Well, he was saying the same thing that Jesus

00:47:11.140 --> 00:47:17.820
said in John 14. I am the way, the truth, and the life. No man cometh unto the

00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:22.540
Father but by me. This morning, if you're saved, would you rejoice that you have a

00:47:22.540 --> 00:47:27.580
high priest, that he lives? And oh, that God would help us to live our lives

00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:34.300
daily with the understanding that we serve a risen Savior, that he lives. One

00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:38.660
day I'm gonna be with him, see him face to face, isn't that wonderful? That song

00:47:38.660 --> 00:47:45.180
that I shared the words to, the hallelujah, what a Savior, that verse that

00:47:45.220 --> 00:47:51.060
talks about when he comes, our glorious King, he's coming. No man knoweth the

00:47:51.060 --> 00:47:55.460
day nor hour, but I'd like to say that it's getting close. And I say that on the

00:47:55.460 --> 00:47:58.620
authority of the Word of God, when James recorded for us that the coming of the

00:47:58.620 --> 00:48:05.140
Lord draweth nigh. Amen? If you've not been saved, could I offer to you this

00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:10.260
morning the greatest gift that has ever been given? It's not a gift that I could

00:48:10.260 --> 00:48:13.140
offer you personally, it's a gift that has been offered by the Lord Jesus

00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:17.300
Christ, and it's the gift of God which is eternal life through Jesus Christ our

00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:22.140
Lord. Don't leave here this morning, don't tune off from live stream without

00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:27.220
knowing for sure that heaven is your home. Because our high priest offered a

00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:31.980
better, he presented a better offering when he offered himself. Let's pray.

00:48:31.980 --> 00:48:36.500
Father, we love you this morning, we thank you for loving us, we thank you for thy

00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:42.620
Word and for the truth contained therein. We thank you that we have an high

00:48:42.660 --> 00:48:48.340
priest, Jesus Christ, the Son of God. We thank you that he entered into the

00:48:48.340 --> 00:48:56.460
heavens, the true tabernacle. We thank you that he made an offering that was far

00:48:56.460 --> 00:49:03.260
superior to any offering that was made by any priest when he offered himself,

00:49:03.260 --> 00:49:11.180
the just for the unjust. We're so thankful for the precious blood of Christ, we're

00:49:11.180 --> 00:49:15.940
thankful that he was buried in a borrowed tomb and rose in victory on the

00:49:15.940 --> 00:49:23.580
third day. Father, I pray you'd help us to, those of us that are saved, been born

00:49:23.580 --> 00:49:29.140
again, help us to live with that understanding that we serve a risen

00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:33.820
Savior. Father, I pray that if there's one that's not sure of heaven, it's our

00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:40.020
prayer this morning that the Holy Spirit of God would do the work that was outlined in

00:49:40.020 --> 00:49:52.380
John 16. Oh Holy Spirit, I pray that you would convict of sin, of Christ's

00:49:52.380 --> 00:49:58.820
righteousness, and of judgment to come. I pray that not one person would leave

00:49:58.820 --> 00:50:04.020
this place, not that one person would...

00:50:04.020 --> 00:50:11.780
Log off of Livestream without knowing for sure that heaven is their home.

00:50:11.780 --> 00:50:16.220
Thank you for being our wonderful Savior.

00:50:16.220 --> 00:50:23.020
Indeed, we echo the words of the songwriter, hallelujah, what a Savior.

00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:26.660
I pray that you'd move in our midst, that you'd have your will and way.

00:50:26.660 --> 00:50:27.660
We'll thank you for it.

00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:28.660
In Christ's name we pray.

00:50:28.660 --> 00:50:29.660
Would you stand with me?

00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:32.900
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed, no one's looking around.

00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:35.900
It is our practice to have a time of invitation at the end of each of our sermons.
