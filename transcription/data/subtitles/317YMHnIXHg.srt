1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,639
for 2020, and we'll get into the 12th chapter in our next study, and of course that's where

2
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:11,199
that verse of Scripture is found, Hebrews 12, and verse number 2, looking unto Jesus,

3
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:14,159
the author and finisher of our faith, and we'll deal with that next week, but as we

4
00:00:14,159 --> 00:00:20,040
look at Hebrews 11 and finish up the chapter, we've seen some amazing things that God has

5
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:25,840
recorded for us here in Hebrews 11 with regard to those that have gone before us.

6
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,639
Of course we know that as we look at the passage of Scripture and really think about the book

7
00:00:29,639 --> 00:00:35,279
of Hebrews, and we understand the way in which these believers have been instructed,

8
00:00:35,279 --> 00:00:41,080
we find the theme of the book really that Jesus is better, he's superior, he's greater,

9
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:45,599
and we find that the writer of Hebrews goes through a whole host of things that he deals

10
00:00:45,599 --> 00:00:51,400
with and proves biblically that Christ is superior, that he's better.

11
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:57,799
We find that there's many Old Testament references in the book of Hebrews that are properly applied

12
00:00:57,799 --> 00:01:00,799
to the person of the Lord Jesus Christ, to Messiah.

13
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:05,599
And what a joy that is, and what a blessing, and these believers, they were suffering under

14
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:10,919
some great, intense difficulties, and there were all sorts of things going on, and there

15
00:01:10,919 --> 00:01:17,000
was a real draw to return to Judaism, and perhaps that would just take care of some

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,459
of the problems that they had encountered and that they were enduring, and yet we know

17
00:01:21,459 --> 00:01:27,779
that the book, the idea, is because Christ is superior, why would you go back?

18
00:01:27,779 --> 00:01:32,779
The law having a shadow of good things to come, it certainly is appropriate, it's a

19
00:01:32,779 --> 00:01:39,099
picture, it's a pattern, but we have the substance, the person of the Lord Jesus Christ has come

20
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:42,900
and he's completed the work, and what a joy that is.

21
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:49,940
And we find that these believers have been encouraged to go on, to continue, to live

22
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:50,940
by faith.

23
00:01:51,419 --> 00:01:54,900
It's interesting that at the end of Hebrews chapter number 10, that he quotes that Old

24
00:01:54,900 --> 00:02:02,180
Testament truth that we find quoted many times here in the New Testament, the just shall

25
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,300
live by faith.

26
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:09,300
He says that this interesting truth in verse number 39 of Hebrews 10, we are not of them

27
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:15,979
who draw back unto perdition, no, we go on, we go forward, we live by faith.

28
00:02:15,979 --> 00:02:19,580
We see, if you would look at the end of Hebrews chapter number 10 and the beginning of Hebrews

29
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:25,100
chapter number 12, and you really could look at Hebrews chapter 11 as being a parenthetical,

30
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:32,179
if you will, to say, listen, we go on by faith, let us run our race, but let me take a moment

31
00:02:32,179 --> 00:02:38,460
to remind you of all of those that have gone before us who have lived by faith.

32
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:43,860
And what a joy and what a blessing to be encouraged by these Old Testament accounts.

33
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:48,259
It's interesting, as we've worked our way through Hebrews chapter 11, especially in

34
00:02:48,259 --> 00:02:52,940
the last two Sunday morning services, we've seen that there's been really a sufficient

35
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,699
amount of Scripture that has been given.

36
00:02:54,699 --> 00:02:58,779
You think about, of course, the greatest amount of Scripture in this passage that is given

37
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:02,860
to an individual is that of Abraham, and we read about those things.

38
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:07,259
And then we come to our text this morning, and the writer says in verse number 32, and

39
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:10,100
what shall I say more, or what shall I more say?

40
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:15,580
For the time would fail me to tell of Gideon, of Barak, of Samson, of Jephthah, of David

41
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:18,059
also, and Samuel of the prophets.

42
00:03:18,059 --> 00:03:22,300
Now, we're going to look at the whole text, but I want you to skip over and look at verse

43
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,300
number 39.

44
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:30,220
It says, and these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the

45
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,220
promise.

46
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:35,100
I want to preach a message this morning that I've simply entitled from verse number 39,

47
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,100
a good report through faith.

48
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:42,460
Now you'll recall with me as we began studying this portion of Scripture, that in Hebrews

49
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:46,500
11, in verse number 1, the Bible says, now faith is the substance of things hoped for,

50
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,259
the evidence of things not seen.

51
00:03:48,259 --> 00:03:50,699
And then it tells us this, for by it, by what?

52
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:56,300
By faith, the elders obtained a good report.

53
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:03,220
And as we get to the end of the chapter, we are reminded, and these all, having obtained

54
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:07,179
a good report through faith.

55
00:04:07,179 --> 00:04:12,600
And as we look at this passage of Scripture, and we think about these names that are provided

56
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:20,220
to us really in rapid succession, it causes our mind to race back to those Old Testament

57
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,619
events that are being referenced.

58
00:04:21,619 --> 00:04:26,779
And we find there are a number of names given in verse number 32 and verses 33, down really

59
00:04:26,779 --> 00:04:29,299
through verse number 37, 38.

60
00:04:29,299 --> 00:04:34,299
You begin to see all of these events that are being referenced, just quick references

61
00:04:34,299 --> 00:04:36,260
and in rapid succession.

62
00:04:36,339 --> 00:04:40,779
And as we would have an understanding of the Old Testament, we have some familiarity with

63
00:04:40,779 --> 00:04:46,220
the Word of God, our mind races back to those events that are mentioned, back to the Old

64
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,500
Testament account.

65
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:52,959
Now think about the original recipients to the book of Hebrews, and how well they would

66
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,179
have been acquainted with the Old Testament.

67
00:04:55,179 --> 00:05:01,220
And now as these names and these events are being provided to these believers in rapid

68
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:05,619
succession, no doubt their mind is going back to all of those things that they were

69
00:05:05,619 --> 00:05:07,619
very familiar with.

70
00:05:07,619 --> 00:05:13,100
And as we look at the passage of Scripture, I believe that at least two important principles

71
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,260
are being communicated to us this morning.

72
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:23,899
The first of these two important principles would be this, in every era of human history,

73
00:05:23,899 --> 00:05:29,579
there are those that believe the Lord and lived by faith.

74
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:33,899
We begin to look at Hebrews chapter 11, and we find that this is written to the believers

75
00:05:33,899 --> 00:05:39,899
in the first century, and we find that we began Hebrews 11 all the way back in creation.

76
00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:44,100
And then we begin to deal with, as we looked at the portion of Scripture about the faith

77
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:50,299
of Abel, and the faith of Enoch, and the faith of Noah, and we go through human history,

78
00:05:50,299 --> 00:05:55,380
we begin at creation in verse number 3, and we end up, notice at the end of verse number

79
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:59,619
32, he says, in Samuel and of the prophets.

80
00:05:59,619 --> 00:06:03,579
And you think about that, and of the prophets, and you just begin to think about all of the

81
00:06:03,579 --> 00:06:08,500
great prophets of God that ministered, that are recorded in the Old Testament, and for

82
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:14,500
these believers of the first century, really what we're finding is that in every era, there

83
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:19,179
were those that believed God and lived by faith.

84
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:24,859
If we were to look this morning at the last 2,000 years of human history, and we were

85
00:06:24,859 --> 00:06:30,420
to dig in, and we were beginning to examine church history, we would begin that we could

86
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:37,820
easily identify that there are people all throughout history that believed God and lived

87
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:38,820
by faith.

88
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:43,660
Now, it's not recorded for us here in the words of Scripture, because the canon of Scripture

89
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:49,500
was closed there, of course, several centuries ago, many centuries ago, and we find here

90
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:55,980
though that this is a great principle that these believers are being confronted with.

91
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,140
There's always been people that believed God.

92
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,700
Will you believe God?

93
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,660
There have always been people that have lived by faith.

94
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:04,100
Will you live by faith?

95
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:09,260
And then we find that a second principle that I believe that is being communicated here

96
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:16,420
in this portion of Scripture is this, living by faith is not synonymous with having no

97
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,420
problems.

98
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,420
Amen?

99
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:21,459
Have you found it to be so?

100
00:07:21,459 --> 00:07:26,339
The reality is that at times in our lives, when we think about the great heroes of the

101
00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:32,739
faith, when we think about those that live by faith, we think that they have a life void

102
00:07:32,739 --> 00:07:34,380
of problem.

103
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:40,100
The reality is that the portion of Scripture proves otherwise, and we find that as we would

104
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:45,940
begin to examine history, biblical history, and then even contemporary history, we would

105
00:07:46,059 --> 00:07:52,899
find that those that live by faith, many times, yes, we get to see God work miraculously,

106
00:07:52,899 --> 00:07:58,380
and we get to see the great victories, but there are problems that we encounter.

107
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:03,459
There are difficulties that we endure, but I want you to understand that even in those

108
00:08:03,459 --> 00:08:07,140
moments it's still by faith.

109
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:14,899
And the reality is that we understand, biblically speaking, that God has a different definition

110
00:08:14,899 --> 00:08:18,739
for success than the world does.

111
00:08:18,739 --> 00:08:24,459
The world thinks of success in certain terms of what you have, what your possessions are,

112
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:29,299
what your position is, what your bank account looks like, all of those types of things,

113
00:08:29,299 --> 00:08:34,500
and there are those that would look at people with all of these pleasures and possessions

114
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,780
and position, and the world would say, oh, they're so successful.

115
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:45,700
But we find that God says to Joshua, in Joshua chapter number one, with regard to having

116
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:52,419
good success, that it was resulted in the reality that you believe the Word of God,

117
00:08:52,419 --> 00:08:55,820
that this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth.

118
00:08:55,820 --> 00:09:00,179
Thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to

119
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:06,179
all that is written therein, then thou shalt have good success, amen?

120
00:09:06,219 --> 00:09:07,700
And your way will be prosperous.

121
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:11,179
And we begin to think about that principle in Joshua 1 and verse number 8, and I'm so

122
00:09:11,179 --> 00:09:15,659
thankful that God's given us a Bible, and I'm so thankful that He's given us the truth

123
00:09:15,659 --> 00:09:17,619
with regard to how to please Him.

124
00:09:17,619 --> 00:09:21,580
We looked at that great truth in verse number 6 of this great chapter.

125
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:27,380
But without faith, it is impossible to please Him, for he that cometh to God must believe

126
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:32,659
that He is, and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him.

127
00:09:32,659 --> 00:09:37,700
And God has given us the truth all the way back in the Old Testament, and it's been repeated

128
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:43,340
in the New Testament, the just shall live by faith.

129
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:49,780
He asks the question, when the people of God have been delivered from the bondage of Egypt,

130
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:56,539
when they've been able to see the power of God through all of the plagues, and His provision

131
00:09:56,539 --> 00:09:59,940
and His leadership, and the crossing of the Red Sea.

132
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,700
And yet, when the spies go,

133
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,880
they come back and ten of them say,

134
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,460
listen, the land, there are giants there

135
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:10,480
and it's well fortified and we're not able.

136
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,660
Joshua and Caleb, they say if God is for us,

137
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:17,160
since God is with us,

138
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,360
since God has promised us,

139
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,140
we can't deny any of what they said

140
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,620
about the things that we saw in the land,

141
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:27,420
but we know that our God is able.

142
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,700
But the ten, that evil report,

143
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,140
influenced the whole congregation

144
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:34,460
and God says this to Moses,

145
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:40,100
how long ere it be that my people believe me?

146
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,060
And still today, all of these years later,

147
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:46,300
we ask the question, will we believe God?

148
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,780
Because faith is simply taking God at His word.

149
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,300
Believing what God said.

150
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,780
Let's dig into the passage.

151
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,300
If you're taking notes this morning,

152
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,500
notice with me, number one, the accomplishments.

153
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,780
Notice the accomplishments.

154
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:01,340
Hebrews 11, v. 32 through the very first phrase

155
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,980
of v. 35, there's a great list

156
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,260
that is provided to us.

157
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,220
The Bible says this,

158
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,060
and what shall I more say?

159
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,980
For the time would fail me to tell of Gideon,

160
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,060
of Barak, and of Samson, of Jephthah,

161
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,540
of David also, and Samuel, and the prophets.

162
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,060
And then notice these accomplishments

163
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,500
in v. 33.

164
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:24,900
Who through faith subdued kingdoms,

165
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,220
wrought righteousness,

166
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:30,139
obtained promises,

167
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:33,500
stopped the mouths of lions,

168
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,260
quenched the violence of fire,

169
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:39,459
escaped the edge of the sword,

170
00:11:39,459 --> 00:11:41,700
out of weakness were made strong,

171
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,819
waxed valiant in fight,

172
00:11:43,819 --> 00:11:46,819
turned to flight the armies of the aliens.

173
00:11:46,819 --> 00:11:48,540
The first section of v. 35,

174
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,980
women received their dead,

175
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:54,180
raised to life again.

176
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,180
Then we begin to read those verses of Scripture

177
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,340
and we begin to see the accomplishments.

178
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,700
We begin to see what was wrought through faith

179
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,060
and how God was working supernaturally.

180
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,500
Why? Because His people believed Him.

181
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,900
And they believed what God said.

182
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,940
That He would do what He said.

183
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,860
And we see their great accomplishments.

184
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,419
No doubt as we read the names of the people

185
00:12:14,419 --> 00:12:18,460
in v. 32, we are reminded of some of the great victories

186
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:21,660
that are represented by these names.

187
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:25,339
We're reminded of some of the most familiar

188
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:28,300
Bible accounts in all of the Word of God.

189
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,139
We're reminded of some of those right here in this list

190
00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:35,820
that is provided to us in v. 32.

191
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,900
Notice Gideon.

192
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:37,740
What do you think?

193
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,619
I mean, the little kids in Sunday school,

194
00:12:39,619 --> 00:12:41,619
they've been learning about Gideon

195
00:12:41,619 --> 00:12:43,779
from the youngest of age.

196
00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:45,139
You mean to think about Gideon

197
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,779
and what do we know about Gideon

198
00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:48,740
when we know that he had an army?

199
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,260
First of all, he was the youngest

200
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:53,460
and he was the least and God, the angel of the Lord

201
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,500
comes and calls him a mighty man of valor.

202
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,339
And Gideon thinks he's got the wrong guy.

203
00:12:58,339 --> 00:13:00,460
You've come to the wrong place.

204
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:03,540
And God, through a series of events,

205
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:07,820
encourages Gideon and builds his faith.

206
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,940
See, in the beginning, Gideon didn't have enough faith

207
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:13,059
to believe that they would be able to have this victory.

208
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:14,900
They were outnumbered.

209
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,460
But God, from His perspective,

210
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,979
He says, actually you have too many.

211
00:13:18,979 --> 00:13:20,260
What do you mean I have too many?

212
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,699
I mean, we're outnumbered like four to one.

213
00:13:22,699 --> 00:13:23,779
Yeah, yeah, but that's too many

214
00:13:23,779 --> 00:13:26,619
because if I give you the victory,

215
00:13:26,619 --> 00:13:27,820
then you're gonna think that it was

216
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,180
because of your own power.

217
00:13:30,339 --> 00:13:33,300
And all the way down to just 300 men,

218
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,220
through a series of events, faith builders.

219
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,820
We're familiar with Gideon.

220
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:42,500
Barak, Jephthah, Samson, I put them out of order there.

221
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,900
David also, isn't that interesting?

222
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,380
Just to say, and David also.

223
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,220
Now, what is your mind?

224
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,940
I mean, when you think about David and I don't have time,

225
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:52,500
I'm gonna say the same thing that the writer of Hebrews said

226
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,139
what shall I more say for the time

227
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:55,580
would fail me to tell, right?

228
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:58,339
I mean, we can't dig into all of this,

229
00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:02,139
but we find the great record that is provided

230
00:14:02,139 --> 00:14:04,460
in the way in which the people of God,

231
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,820
not only in the first century,

232
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,100
but even still because it's been preserved

233
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:08,979
in the Word of God.

234
00:14:08,979 --> 00:14:10,820
For us this morning, we're reminded

235
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,860
that people live by faith.

236
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,900
You think about David.

237
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,140
You think about the great victories.

238
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,339
You think about probably one of the first things

239
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:22,420
that comes to many people's minds

240
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:25,299
if you were to list Bible characters and say,

241
00:14:25,299 --> 00:14:26,779
what's the first thing that comes to your mind?

242
00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:27,899
You list Bible characters,

243
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:29,700
you're gonna get a variety of answers.

244
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,739
And with David, no doubt,

245
00:14:31,739 --> 00:14:34,739
someone is gonna say David and Goliath.

246
00:14:34,739 --> 00:14:37,420
Someone will, maybe many will.

247
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,100
You see the faith of David.

248
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,500
Goliath says, I'm gonna kill you.

249
00:14:45,339 --> 00:14:48,940
And David says, the battle is the Lord's.

250
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:54,940
And he goes in faith believing that God can and God will.

251
00:14:55,179 --> 00:14:59,220
He said, is there not a cause?

252
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,700
When Saul and all of the other soldiers were fearful

253
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,140
when Goliath would make himself known,

254
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:07,100
and we find that David had faith.

255
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,580
He just believed God.

256
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,779
Saul says, okay, I'm gonna let you go,

257
00:15:10,779 --> 00:15:11,899
but you need to have some armor.

258
00:15:11,899 --> 00:15:13,059
You need to have these things.

259
00:15:13,059 --> 00:15:16,100
And of course, he told him before that,

260
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,700
that you can't go fight against them

261
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,619
because you're just a youth

262
00:15:18,619 --> 00:15:20,860
and this man is a man of war from his youth.

263
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,380
What does David do?

264
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:26,420
He remembers what God has done.

265
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:29,700
Right?

266
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,100
There's a bear.

267
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,299
Begins to reflect upon what God did

268
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:35,860
and showing His power.

269
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:39,260
And he says, the same God who wrought victory then,

270
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:42,220
He is able in this situation.

271
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:46,980
We go through, we see the Samuel and the prophets

272
00:15:47,059 --> 00:15:49,700
and we begin to think about these events

273
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,619
that are mentioned.

274
00:15:50,619 --> 00:15:52,500
And you think about the way in which

275
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,899
they subdued kingdoms,

276
00:15:53,899 --> 00:15:55,739
the victories of the Old Testament

277
00:15:55,739 --> 00:15:56,940
that you can read of,

278
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,220
wrought righteousness,

279
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:02,140
the great revivals that you can read of in Judah's history,

280
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,380
obtained promises,

281
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,299
stopped the mouths of lions.

282
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:08,459
What do you think about when you read those words?

283
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:09,299
Right?

284
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:10,179
What do you think of?

285
00:16:10,179 --> 00:16:11,540
Daniel, right?

286
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:15,059
Again, one of those very familiar Bible accounts, right?

287
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,940
And remember, Darius, he can't even sleep, right?

288
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,260
I mean, he's all kinds of messed up

289
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,380
because Daniel has to go into the den of lions.

290
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,260
And he knew that those lions,

291
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,179
I mean, they purposed,

292
00:16:24,179 --> 00:16:26,779
they understood what the whole process was

293
00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:29,459
and those lions are ready to destroy and devour.

294
00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:31,820
And in fact, after Daniel is delivered,

295
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:34,700
those accusers and their families are cast in

296
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,940
and before they even touch the ground,

297
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,100
they're devoured.

298
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:42,059
But he comes to that den that morning

299
00:16:42,059 --> 00:16:43,420
after a sleepless night.

300
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,260
And he says,

301
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:48,940
is your God that you serve continually able to deliver thee?

302
00:16:49,899 --> 00:16:51,260
Yes.

303
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,820
Yes.

304
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,860
We sing the song,

305
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:56,220
He is able to deliver thee.

306
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:01,179
We see obvious reference to Daniel in chapter number six.

307
00:17:01,179 --> 00:17:04,459
We look at the passage and we see that he continues,

308
00:17:04,459 --> 00:17:06,339
quenched the violence of fire.

309
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:07,940
What do you think about?

310
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,860
Again, you think about the book of Daniel,

311
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,779
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, right?

312
00:17:11,779 --> 00:17:14,100
Remember Nebuchadnezzar with all of his power

313
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:18,019
and all of his might in the world empire at that time,

314
00:17:18,019 --> 00:17:19,619
the Babylonian kingdom.

315
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:20,459
And he says,

316
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:24,059
who is that God that will deliver you out of my hand?

317
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:25,739
I mean, he has power.

318
00:17:25,739 --> 00:17:28,059
He says, I can't believe that you're not gonna bow.

319
00:17:28,059 --> 00:17:30,059
In fact, I'm gonna give you another opportunity.

320
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:32,019
We'll play the music just for you.

321
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,100
And they said,

322
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,220
we're not gonna bow.

323
00:17:38,339 --> 00:17:39,779
We're just not gonna bow.

324
00:17:40,619 --> 00:17:44,059
And they believe that their God was able.

325
00:17:44,059 --> 00:17:44,899
And they said,

326
00:17:44,899 --> 00:17:45,739
and if not,

327
00:17:45,739 --> 00:17:47,739
we're still not gonna bow.

328
00:17:47,739 --> 00:17:49,220
Amen?

329
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,459
And what happens?

330
00:17:51,339 --> 00:17:52,940
He cast them in.

331
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:57,019
We understand that the ones who cast in

332
00:17:57,019 --> 00:17:58,260
these three Hebrew children,

333
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:01,260
they died because the furnace was so heated.

334
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:05,260
And they're cast in bound.

335
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,739
And Nebuchadnezzar says,

336
00:18:06,739 --> 00:18:07,580
just a little while,

337
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,980
he's a stone, the Bible says.

338
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,619
And he looks and he says,

339
00:18:10,619 --> 00:18:12,660
hey guys, how many did we throw in there?

340
00:18:13,779 --> 00:18:15,459
Three.

341
00:18:15,459 --> 00:18:17,619
He says, well, I see four.

342
00:18:17,619 --> 00:18:19,660
And they're walking around.

343
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,019
They turn down the fire,

344
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:24,260
get them out.

345
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:28,059
They don't even have the smell of fire.

346
00:18:28,059 --> 00:18:29,100
That's our God.

347
00:18:30,459 --> 00:18:33,299
Armando, I've had fires at your house.

348
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:34,900
We've gone and had a fire,

349
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:35,979
a campfire.

350
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,580
I've never left from a campfire

351
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,659
not smelling like smoke.

352
00:18:40,659 --> 00:18:42,659
And I've never been in the fire.

353
00:18:42,659 --> 00:18:43,659
Amen?

354
00:18:43,659 --> 00:18:44,979
I've been close to the fire,

355
00:18:44,979 --> 00:18:46,700
but I've never been in the fire,

356
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,140
but I've never left without smelling like smoke.

357
00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:52,700
These boys went into the fiery furnace.

358
00:18:53,739 --> 00:18:54,580
You keep going,

359
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,419
you see escape the edge of the sword.

360
00:18:56,419 --> 00:18:57,940
Out of weakness were made strong.

361
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,179
Wax valiant in fight.

362
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:00,020
Turn to flight,

363
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,299
the armies of the aliens.

364
00:19:01,299 --> 00:19:02,140
Of course,

365
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,340
that's not talking about extraterrestrial aliens

366
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,460
and all that sort of thing.

367
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:08,179
That are those that are not the Hebrews.

368
00:19:08,179 --> 00:19:09,659
And so please understand that.

369
00:19:09,659 --> 00:19:10,580
Verse 35,

370
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,979
women received their dead raised to life again.

371
00:19:12,979 --> 00:19:14,140
What do you think about?

372
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,020
There are two examples.

373
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:15,859
One with Elijah,

374
00:19:15,859 --> 00:19:16,979
one with Elisha.

375
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,340
Right?

376
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,179
The woman at Zarephath,

377
00:19:20,179 --> 00:19:21,099
the widow of Zarephath,

378
00:19:21,099 --> 00:19:22,500
and the Shunammite.

379
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,140
And you look at those two examples,

380
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:28,020
you see the way in which they were raised again.

381
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,179
And we look at this passage of Scripture

382
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:32,099
and we notice their accomplishments.

383
00:19:32,099 --> 00:19:33,539
And I would say this,

384
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:34,940
as I think of their accomplishments,

385
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,380
I look at it as being this.

386
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:39,299
Faith on the mountaintop.

387
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:40,140
I mean,

388
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,260
seeing God work

389
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,739
and experiencing the great victories

390
00:19:43,739 --> 00:19:44,859
and the accomplishments

391
00:19:44,859 --> 00:19:48,220
and knowing that our God is able.

392
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,020
And then we continue with the text of Scripture.

393
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:50,859
And again,

394
00:19:50,859 --> 00:19:52,700
as I mentioned by way of introduction,

395
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:55,020
the two principles that are being communicated.

396
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:55,859
One,

397
00:19:55,859 --> 00:19:57,419
that there's always been a group of people

398
00:19:57,419 --> 00:19:58,539
that have lived by faith

399
00:19:58,539 --> 00:19:59,820
and believed the Lord.

400
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,360
Number two, it's not synonymous.

401
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,280
To live by faith is not synonymous

402
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,660
with having no problems.

403
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:08,300
And we get to our second point this morning.

404
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,680
I noticed the accomplishments,

405
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,860
and now I notice the adversities.

406
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:15,120
The adversities.

407
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,680
Notice with me as we continue reading in v. 35

408
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,200
and really go down through v. 38.

409
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,120
It says this and others.

410
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,460
I want you to take note of that phrase others.

411
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,080
It's used twice in our passage.

412
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,360
You'll see it again in v. 36.

413
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,320
And the names of these aren't given.

414
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,420
We can of course look back historically

415
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:36,400
and see some of who would be referenced

416
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,680
with these particular descriptive terms.

417
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,600
But it says and others were tortured.

418
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:46,400
Notice what it says, not accepting deliverance.

419
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,820
You understand there were certain times

420
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:51,120
throughout the history of mankind,

421
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,780
those that believed God,

422
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,640
that they suffered great affliction,

423
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,280
that they were tortured.

424
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:59,220
But the ones that were doing the torturing

425
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,420
offered them deliverance

426
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:05,420
if they would just stop living for God.

427
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:08,140
Stop preaching Christ.

428
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,420
Stop and we'll leave you alone.

429
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,740
You'll be delivered.

430
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:14,340
John Bunyan, by the way, had the opportunity.

431
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,800
We're told of John Bunyan

432
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,500
that when he was in prison,

433
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,880
that he of course was illegally preaching

434
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,160
because it was not sanctioned

435
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,620
by the state church.

436
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:26,520
And he's preaching.

437
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,100
Why couldn't he be part of the state church?

438
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,780
Because it didn't line up with the Word of God.

439
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,900
And he's preaching and he's in prison.

440
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,860
And it's understood through history

441
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:38,900
that just without the side of the bars of the prison,

442
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:42,580
he could have signed his own release

443
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:48,260
if he would just agree to no longer preach.

444
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:53,420
And he stayed in prison.

445
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:55,780
Not accepting deliverance.

446
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,020
I understand that John Bunyan's

447
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,460
someone spoken of here.

448
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,620
He lived many years later.

449
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:05,220
But you understand that there are those

450
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:07,060
that lived by faith.

451
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:10,060
That dealt with great adversities.

452
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,300
The end of v. 35,

453
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:15,100
that they might obtain a better resurrection.

454
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,180
And others, we see that word again,

455
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:22,300
and others had trial of cruel mockings

456
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,100
and scourgings.

457
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,180
Yay?

458
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:29,380
Moreover, of bonds and imprisonment.

459
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,100
They were stoned.

460
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,940
They were sawn asunder.

461
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,420
Were tempted.

462
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,540
Were slain with the sword.

463
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:39,980
They wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins,

464
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:44,340
being destitute, afflicted, tormented.

465
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:46,820
Of whom the world was not worthy.

466
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:49,300
They wandered in deserts and in mountains

467
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:52,740
and in dens and caves of the earth.

468
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:55,380
Remember, as we studied several weeks ago,

469
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,660
that the Bible told us in v. 16,

470
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,900
but now they desire a better country,

471
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,180
that is in heavenly,

472
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,460
wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God,

473
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,300
for He hath prepared for them a city.

474
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,500
And we notice that at the end of v. 13,

475
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,380
it says that they confess that they were

476
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:13,340
strangers and pilgrims on the earth.

477
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,620
We confess this morning,

478
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:16,220
this world is not my home.

479
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,700
I'm just a passing through.

480
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,140
I'm a stranger and a pilgrim.

481
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:22,420
I'm not home, but I'm going home.

482
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,460
I don't know when I'm going to get there.

483
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,220
But I know that there's one of two ways

484
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,220
that I'm going to get there.

485
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,900
The trumpet of the Lord's going to sound

486
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,220
and the rapture will take place

487
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:33,060
and I will forevermore be with my Lord and Savior.

488
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:36,980
Or, I will cross the door of death

489
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,500
and to be absent from the body

490
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:43,100
is to be present with the Lord.

491
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:45,020
We're pilgrims and strangers.

492
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,420
It tells us in v. 38,

493
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,260
they wandered in deserts and in mountains

494
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,020
and in dens and caves of the earth.

495
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:51,500
And we begin to look at this list

496
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,660
and we begin to think about the adversities

497
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:56,740
that these individuals would face.

498
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,540
My mind races back.

499
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,580
I'm just going to use a couple of illustrations.

500
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,740
Turn over to 2 Chronicles if you will.

501
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,500
And look at chapter 16.

502
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,820
We're going to begin there.

503
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:08,660
I'm just going to give you three references this morning

504
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,980
of some of those that were faithful

505
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,500
and lived by faith

506
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,180
and did the work of God,

507
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,180
but they suffered.

508
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:17,580
They dealt with adversity.

509
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:20,820
By the way, if you read the testimony

510
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:23,300
of the Apostle Paul,

511
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:26,700
he suffered greatly, did he not?

512
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,300
He suffered greatly.

513
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:32,020
I think about the very first missionary journey

514
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:35,899
of the Apostle Paul.

515
00:24:35,899 --> 00:24:37,980
He gets in every city that he goes to.

516
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:40,500
Iconium, Lyster, Derbe, Antioch, and Pisidia.

517
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,100
All four of those places that he goes to

518
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,740
in that first missionary journey.

519
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:44,899
He suffers the same thing.

520
00:24:44,899 --> 00:24:47,260
He deals with adversity.

521
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:49,820
But yet, he gets up and goes to the next place

522
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:52,140
and preaches.

523
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,260
He understands that the work that he's doing

524
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,940
he was called of the Lord to do it.

525
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,779
In 2 Chronicles 16, you're there.

526
00:24:57,779 --> 00:25:00,339
Look in v. 10 to give you just kind of

527
00:25:00,339 --> 00:25:02,100
the understanding.

528
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:05,020
Let me back up and look in v. 7.

529
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:07,940
This is a situation here between a man of God,

530
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:10,339
a seer, a prophet, and Asa the king.

531
00:25:10,339 --> 00:25:11,779
The Bible says this in v. 7,

532
00:25:11,779 --> 00:25:13,740
At that time, Hanani the seer

533
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,779
came to Asa king of Judah

534
00:25:15,779 --> 00:25:18,540
and said unto him,

535
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:21,059
Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria

536
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:23,179
and not relied on the Lord thy God,

537
00:25:23,179 --> 00:25:25,140
therefore is the host of the king of Syria

538
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,580
escaped out of thine hand.

539
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,540
Now, you understand Asa wasn't very pleased

540
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,899
to receive that word.

541
00:25:30,899 --> 00:25:33,860
The prophet did not gain any level of popularity

542
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:35,100
by standing before the king

543
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:38,059
and telling him this truth.

544
00:25:38,059 --> 00:25:39,540
In v. 8, the Bible says,

545
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:42,380
Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubams a huge host

546
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,140
with very many chariots and horsemen?

547
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:48,059
Yet, because thou didst rely on the Lord,

548
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,300
he delivered them into thine hand.

549
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,380
And so he reminds them of a past victory

550
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,300
in which he relied on the Lord

551
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,420
and received the deliverance,

552
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,339
and God worked.

553
00:25:57,339 --> 00:25:59,420
But in this particular situation with the Syrians,

554
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:01,740
he did not rely on the Lord

555
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:04,540
because he relied on the king of Syria,

556
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,899
and therefore they've escaped.

557
00:26:05,899 --> 00:26:07,779
V. 9, notice this great truth,

558
00:26:07,779 --> 00:26:10,140
this Bible principle,

559
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:12,140
For the eyes of the Lord

560
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:14,820
run to and fro throughout the whole earth

561
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:18,899
to show Himself strong in the behalf of them

562
00:26:18,899 --> 00:26:23,740
whose heart is perfect toward Him.

563
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:27,580
Herein, thou hast done foolishly.

564
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:30,899
Therefore, from henceforth, thou shalt have wars.

565
00:26:30,899 --> 00:26:33,260
Then Asa was wroth.

566
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,660
You understand, there are people

567
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:37,860
that don't like the preaching of the Word of God.

568
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:38,940
Amen?

569
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,339
They just don't want to hear the Bible.

570
00:26:41,339 --> 00:26:43,140
They want to hear somebody tell them

571
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,500
everything's going to be okay

572
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:48,140
There are plenty of false prophets in the Old Testament.

573
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,660
We're going to go in the next passage

574
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:50,700
and look at Micaiah.

575
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,860
There are a lot of false prophets

576
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:52,700
that were telling the king,

577
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:55,460
oh yeah, go, you're going to have victory.

578
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:57,420
Telling him what he wants to hear.

579
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:00,179
The New Testament principle is there in 2 Timothy 4.

580
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:02,339
They're not going to endorse sound doctrine, right?

581
00:27:02,339 --> 00:27:03,740
They're going to have itching ears, right?

582
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:06,660
They want to hear this feel good, do good, whatever.

583
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:09,179
And the reality is that Asa now is wroth.

584
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:12,100
He's angry with the seer, with Hanani,

585
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,500
because he gave them the truth of the Word of God.

586
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,899
The Bible says, and put him in a prison house,

587
00:27:17,899 --> 00:27:21,779
for he was in a rage with him because of that thing.

588
00:27:21,779 --> 00:27:25,580
And Asa oppressed some of the people the same time.

589
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,380
Chapter number 18, turn over if you will,

590
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:31,500
just maybe a page or two in your Bible.

591
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,660
In chapter number 18, we see the record of Jehoshaphat,

592
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:37,540
who basically was a good king in Judah,

593
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:42,059
join with Ahab, who was an extremely wicked king

594
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:42,940
of Israel.

595
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:46,460
The Bible tells us about this agreement that they make,

596
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:48,860
and it was an ungodly agreement.

597
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:51,540
We find that they're going to enter into battle,

598
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:54,740
and of course, Jehoshaphat asks Ahab,

599
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,179
is there not a prophet of the Lord here

600
00:27:56,179 --> 00:27:57,300
that we can inquire of?

601
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,779
And Ahab says, well, there's this guy Micaiah,

602
00:27:59,779 --> 00:28:02,140
but he's always prophesying bad about me,

603
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,260
and so on and so forth.

604
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:06,260
Well, Ahab was an extremely wicked man.

605
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:10,580
Married to Jezebel.

606
00:28:10,619 --> 00:28:12,540
There's probably a reason that there's not a whole lot

607
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:15,940
of Jezebels and Ahabs running around schools today, amen?

608
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,580
We don't name our kids Ahab.

609
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,420
We don't name our kids Jezebel.

610
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:24,420
And we notice here that Micaiah comes.

611
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:26,059
I'm gonna just pick it up in verse 13.

612
00:28:26,059 --> 00:28:27,619
We don't have time to look at the whole text,

613
00:28:27,619 --> 00:28:29,980
and I'm gonna skip down to verses 25 and 26,

614
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:32,539
but notice Micaiah said, as the Lord liveth,

615
00:28:32,539 --> 00:28:34,859
even what my God saith, that will I speak.

616
00:28:34,859 --> 00:28:37,619
And so he's going to go, and he's gonna give the truth,

617
00:28:37,619 --> 00:28:41,660
and we find that Micaiah is faithful

618
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,900
to be a prophet of the Lord,

619
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,299
but his message is not well received.

620
00:28:46,299 --> 00:28:49,299
Notice verse 25, then the king of Israel said,

621
00:28:49,299 --> 00:28:51,380
take ye Micaiah, and carry him back to Ammon,

622
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:54,140
the governor of the city, and to Joash, the king's son,

623
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,419
and say, thus saith the king,

624
00:28:55,419 --> 00:28:57,380
put this fellow in the prison,

625
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:59,260
and feed him with bread of affliction

626
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:01,900
and with water of affliction until I return in peace.

627
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,619
He's never gonna return in peace.

628
00:29:03,619 --> 00:29:04,859
He's gonna die in battle.

629
00:29:05,859 --> 00:29:08,419
Skip over, if you will, and look at chapter 24.

630
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,340
Chapter 24 of the book of 2 Chronicles,

631
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:18,900
in my opinion, is a very sad passage of Scripture,

632
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:21,299
a very unfortunate situation here

633
00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:25,140
with this one Joash, who was the king,

634
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:28,820
and Joash had a very godly influence in his life.

635
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:31,460
It was the priest Jehoiada.

636
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:34,580
The Bible tells us that the priest Jehoiada

637
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:37,539
had great influence on the life of Joash,

638
00:29:37,539 --> 00:29:39,419
and as long as Jehoiada lived,

639
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:41,780
Joash really kind of did that which was right.

640
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,539
But at some point,

641
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:49,220
that person that has influence in your life is gonna die.

642
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,260
And Jehoiada dies.

643
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:54,700
And then there's some new influence in Joash's life.

644
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,900
And unfortunately, I would conclude

645
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,979
as I look at the passage of Scripture,

646
00:29:58,979 --> 00:30:03,979
that Joash was a very godly influence in Jehoiada's life.

647
00:30:03,979 --> 00:30:08,279
never had his own personal walk with God.

648
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:10,239
And how vitally important it is

649
00:30:10,239 --> 00:30:11,879
that we teach our young people

650
00:30:11,879 --> 00:30:14,599
that we instruct the generation behind us

651
00:30:14,599 --> 00:30:17,319
to understand that they need to develop

652
00:30:17,319 --> 00:30:20,159
their own personal walk with God.

653
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:21,439
We've often said this,

654
00:30:21,439 --> 00:30:23,119
that God has no grandchildren.

655
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:25,139
He only has children.

656
00:30:25,139 --> 00:30:26,479
What do we mean by that?

657
00:30:26,479 --> 00:30:28,199
You're not saved because your mom saved,

658
00:30:28,199 --> 00:30:30,519
your dad saved, your grandma saved.

659
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:33,199
You've got to trust Christ as your personal Savior.

660
00:30:33,199 --> 00:30:34,319
And when you get saved,

661
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:36,939
you need to develop that walk with Christ.

662
00:30:36,939 --> 00:30:38,899
And unfortunately, Joash didn't do that.

663
00:30:38,899 --> 00:30:40,159
We pick it up in v. 17.

664
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:41,239
The Bible says this,

665
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:42,739
now after the death of Jehoiada

666
00:30:42,739 --> 00:30:44,039
came the princes of Judah

667
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:45,619
and made obeisance to the king.

668
00:30:45,619 --> 00:30:47,279
Then the king hearkened unto them.

669
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,159
Isn't it amazing how this new influence

670
00:30:49,159 --> 00:30:51,099
comes into Joash's life

671
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:53,779
and they begin to lift him up

672
00:30:53,779 --> 00:30:55,279
and they make obeisance to him

673
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,199
and they wow him, so to speak,

674
00:30:57,199 --> 00:30:59,559
and now they're going to influence him

675
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:02,199
in an ungodly manner.

676
00:31:02,199 --> 00:31:03,979
They left the house of the Lord God

677
00:31:03,979 --> 00:31:04,979
of their fathers.

678
00:31:04,979 --> 00:31:06,659
They served groves and idols

679
00:31:06,659 --> 00:31:08,859
and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem.

680
00:31:08,859 --> 00:31:10,619
For this their trespass.

681
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:13,999
Yet, v. 19, God in His faithfulness

682
00:31:13,999 --> 00:31:16,539
and in His grace says this,

683
00:31:16,539 --> 00:31:20,119
that He sent prophets to them

684
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:21,939
to bring them again unto the Lord.

685
00:31:21,939 --> 00:31:23,419
And they testified against them.

686
00:31:23,419 --> 00:31:25,139
But notice the end of v. 19,

687
00:31:25,139 --> 00:31:29,059
but they would not give ear.

688
00:31:29,059 --> 00:31:31,259
I'm so thankful that God is faithful

689
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:33,959
to send a messenger.

690
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:36,699
I'm so thankful that there are messengers

691
00:31:36,699 --> 00:31:39,239
that have been faithful to deliver the message.

692
00:31:39,239 --> 00:31:43,739
Though at times the message is not popular.

693
00:31:43,739 --> 00:31:45,799
But we see the faithfulness.

694
00:31:45,799 --> 00:31:49,719
Unfortunately, they would not give ear.

695
00:31:49,719 --> 00:31:52,539
There's some people that just don't want to listen.

696
00:31:52,539 --> 00:31:55,259
They don't want to listen.

697
00:31:55,259 --> 00:31:56,719
The Spirit of God came upon Zechariah,

698
00:31:56,719 --> 00:31:58,719
the son of Jehoiada, the priest.

699
00:31:58,719 --> 00:32:00,719
Now think about that.

700
00:32:00,719 --> 00:32:02,339
He was the son of Jehoiada.

701
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:03,759
Remember, Jehoiada was the man

702
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:06,419
that had a great influence in Joash's life.

703
00:32:06,419 --> 00:32:08,579
Furthermore, we find that Joash

704
00:32:08,579 --> 00:32:10,839
was seven years old when it began to rain.

705
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:12,419
So we could easily understand

706
00:32:12,419 --> 00:32:14,259
as we look at the passage of Scripture

707
00:32:14,259 --> 00:32:16,979
that Joash and this one that is mentioned here

708
00:32:16,979 --> 00:32:19,679
in v. 20, Zechariah the son of Jehoiada,

709
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:22,999
they were very close in age, no doubt.

710
00:32:22,999 --> 00:32:25,099
The influence of Jehoiada upon Joash,

711
00:32:25,099 --> 00:32:27,259
they knew one another.

712
00:32:27,259 --> 00:32:29,859
And yet, the Bible tells us in v. 20,

713
00:32:30,579 --> 00:32:31,299
it says,

714
00:32:31,299 --> 00:32:32,979
"...which stood above the people and said unto them,

715
00:32:32,979 --> 00:32:36,639
Thus saith God,

716
00:32:36,639 --> 00:32:39,099
why transgress ye the commandments of the Lord

717
00:32:39,099 --> 00:32:40,819
that ye cannot prosper?

718
00:32:40,819 --> 00:32:42,659
Because ye have forsaken the Lord,

719
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:45,799
He hath also forsaken you.

720
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:46,779
And they..."

721
00:32:46,779 --> 00:32:47,599
Who's they?

722
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:52,879
Well, that's Joash and this new group of friends.

723
00:32:52,879 --> 00:32:55,899
"...they conspired against him, Zechariah,

724
00:32:55,899 --> 00:32:57,819
and stoned him with stones

725
00:32:57,819 --> 00:32:59,759
at the commandment of..." who?

726
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:00,799
The king.

727
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:02,479
Joash.

728
00:33:02,479 --> 00:33:05,719
"...in the court of the house of the Lord."

729
00:33:05,719 --> 00:33:08,839
See, I look at these three Old Testament principles.

730
00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:11,619
Make your way back to Hebrews, if you will, chapter 11.

731
00:33:11,619 --> 00:33:13,619
And no doubt, we could look at others.

732
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:15,919
No doubt, we could begin to discuss

733
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:20,459
the things that are not recorded in Scripture.

734
00:33:20,459 --> 00:33:22,899
Tradition would tell us of some of the deaths

735
00:33:22,899 --> 00:33:24,319
of some of the prophets.

736
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:27,359
When it speaks about here in v. 37

737
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:28,859
that they were saunas under,

738
00:33:28,859 --> 00:33:30,059
tradition would tell us,

739
00:33:30,059 --> 00:33:32,059
though it's not recorded in Holy Scripture,

740
00:33:32,059 --> 00:33:34,059
that it was Isaiah, the prophet of the Lord,

741
00:33:34,059 --> 00:33:35,599
that was sauna and sunder.

742
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:37,439
They say that they put him in a tree,

743
00:33:37,439 --> 00:33:40,459
a hollowed out tree, and cut him in half.

744
00:33:40,459 --> 00:33:42,599
Wow.

745
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:44,599
And we could go on and we could think about

746
00:33:44,599 --> 00:33:48,699
even with the New Testament list of folks

747
00:33:48,699 --> 00:33:52,399
that we could look to being even further in history

748
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,199
removed from the writing of Scripture

749
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:55,999
and we could think about the disciples

750
00:33:55,999 --> 00:33:58,199
and we could understand the historical accounts

751
00:33:58,199 --> 00:34:01,839
given to us of the death in which they faced,

752
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:05,139
the difficulties, the adversities in which they endured.

753
00:34:05,139 --> 00:34:07,999
But I want to draw your attention to two phrases

754
00:34:07,999 --> 00:34:12,399
in this same section that deals with the adversities.

755
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:16,099
The first phrase is found in v. 35.

756
00:34:16,099 --> 00:34:17,639
The Bible says this,

757
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:24,499
that they might obtain a better resurrection.

758
00:34:24,499 --> 00:34:27,999
Now, the reality is that there are times

759
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:29,399
really in the New Testament

760
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:31,699
even during the era in which this was written

761
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:32,999
in the first century there,

762
00:34:32,999 --> 00:34:35,099
you could offer just a little salt on the altar

763
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:38,799
and you could really avoid a whole lot of problems.

764
00:34:38,799 --> 00:34:40,999
But it says no, we're not going to do that.

765
00:34:40,999 --> 00:34:42,999
The writer of Hebrews is saying to these people,

766
00:34:42,999 --> 00:34:43,999
live by faith.

767
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:47,999
Listen, don't accept deliverance.

768
00:34:47,999 --> 00:34:48,999
Why?

769
00:34:48,999 --> 00:34:51,499
Because it says here that they might obtain

770
00:34:51,499 --> 00:34:52,999
a better resurrection.

771
00:34:52,999 --> 00:34:56,999
See, the reality is that we're going to stand before God one day.

772
00:34:56,999 --> 00:34:59,499
Every single person that has ever lived

773
00:34:59,499 --> 00:35:02,499
upon the face of the earth will stand before God.

774
00:35:02,499 --> 00:35:04,699
If you have accepted the Lord Jesus Christ

775
00:35:04,699 --> 00:35:05,899
as your personal Savior,

776
00:35:05,899 --> 00:35:07,999
you can rejoice in the truth that God gives us

777
00:35:07,999 --> 00:35:09,099
in the book of Revelation

778
00:35:09,099 --> 00:35:11,699
that the second death has no power over us,

779
00:35:11,699 --> 00:35:13,299
and you can rejoice in the fact

780
00:35:13,299 --> 00:35:16,299
that you will not stand at the great white throne judgment.

781
00:35:16,299 --> 00:35:17,899
That judgment is given to us

782
00:35:17,899 --> 00:35:20,299
and provided a record of that judgment

783
00:35:20,299 --> 00:35:22,299
in Revelation 20.

784
00:35:22,299 --> 00:35:23,899
If you begin to look at that judgment,

785
00:35:23,899 --> 00:35:25,599
you see that that's the judgment

786
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:27,299
for those that have not accepted

787
00:35:27,299 --> 00:35:29,799
the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal Savior.

788
00:35:29,799 --> 00:35:32,999
And the Bible says that they'll be cast in the lake of fire.

789
00:35:32,999 --> 00:35:34,399
And that's terrible.

790
00:35:34,399 --> 00:35:38,099
It says this is the second death.

791
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:40,799
Mankind without the Lord Jesus Christ

792
00:35:40,799 --> 00:35:44,599
will suffer for all of eternity in the lake of fire.

793
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:46,799
But we find that there's another judgment,

794
00:35:46,799 --> 00:35:49,799
the bema seat, the judgment seat of Christ.

795
00:35:49,799 --> 00:35:51,599
Paul says on a regular occurrence

796
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,799
that we all must stand before God

797
00:35:53,799 --> 00:35:55,499
and give an account.

798
00:35:55,499 --> 00:35:57,399
I preached a message before a revival meeting.

799
00:35:57,399 --> 00:36:00,099
Actually, the Sunday morning of our revival meeting,

800
00:36:00,099 --> 00:36:02,799
I preached a message about examining ourselves

801
00:36:02,799 --> 00:36:05,099
and understanding the preparation

802
00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:06,099
and understanding the fact

803
00:36:06,099 --> 00:36:08,599
that I'm going to stand before the Lord,

804
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:10,599
and therefore, if I'm going to stand before Him

805
00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:11,299
and give an account,

806
00:36:11,299 --> 00:36:13,599
I ought to be preparing for that.

807
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:14,699
But we find that it says

808
00:36:14,699 --> 00:36:16,799
that they might obtain a better resurrection.

809
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:19,499
The fact that though I am tortured

810
00:36:19,499 --> 00:36:21,499
at the hands of mankind

811
00:36:21,499 --> 00:36:23,499
and though they might put me to death

812
00:36:23,499 --> 00:36:25,799
as it goes into the next passage of Scripture

813
00:36:25,799 --> 00:36:27,799
about those that had these trials

814
00:36:27,799 --> 00:36:29,799
and about those in v. 37

815
00:36:29,799 --> 00:36:31,999
that were stoned and were sawn asunder,

816
00:36:31,999 --> 00:36:33,599
yet we have a better resurrection.

817
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:34,899
We can stand before the Lord

818
00:36:34,899 --> 00:36:38,099
and understand that we never bowed down.

819
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:40,999
It's like what the three Hebrew children said

820
00:36:40,999 --> 00:36:42,499
in the book of Daniel,

821
00:36:42,499 --> 00:36:45,099
and we referenced it already a few moments ago,

822
00:36:45,099 --> 00:36:47,399
but you understand that as they're standing there

823
00:36:47,399 --> 00:36:50,699
before the King Nebuchadnezzar,

824
00:36:50,699 --> 00:36:54,299
that they say this in Daniel 3,

825
00:36:54,299 --> 00:36:55,999
when they make it known,

826
00:36:55,999 --> 00:36:57,299
they say, if it be so,

827
00:36:57,299 --> 00:36:59,799
if you're going to send us into this fiery furnace,

828
00:36:59,799 --> 00:37:01,599
we want you to understand that our God

829
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:03,599
whom we serve is able to deliver us

830
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:05,099
from the burning fiery furnace,

831
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:07,899
and He will deliver us out of thine hand, O King.

832
00:37:07,899 --> 00:37:09,199
But it says this,

833
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:11,199
if not, v. 18,

834
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:12,599
be it known unto thee, O King,

835
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:14,299
that we will not serve thy gods

836
00:37:14,299 --> 00:37:15,599
nor worship the golden image

837
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:16,899
which thou hast set up.

838
00:37:16,899 --> 00:37:19,199
Whether it was by being delivered

839
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:20,599
through the fire,

840
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:21,699
from the fire,

841
00:37:21,699 --> 00:37:22,699
in the fire,

842
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:23,599
whatever it was,

843
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:26,099
they knew that God was going to deliver.

844
00:37:26,099 --> 00:37:28,399
We're not going to bow down to your gods.

845
00:37:28,399 --> 00:37:29,799
He is, our God,

846
00:37:29,799 --> 00:37:32,099
is going to deliver us out of your hand,

847
00:37:32,099 --> 00:37:34,199
and it might be through death.

848
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:36,699
We are rejoicing as we look at Daniel 3

849
00:37:36,699 --> 00:37:40,499
that they were delivered from the fire.

850
00:37:40,499 --> 00:37:42,799
The reality this morning

851
00:37:42,799 --> 00:37:43,899
is that there are times

852
00:37:43,899 --> 00:37:45,899
in which God will deliver us

853
00:37:45,899 --> 00:37:47,299
as we live by faith.

854
00:37:47,399 --> 00:37:49,199
He will deliver us from

855
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:51,599
whatever the difficulty is.

856
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,399
There are times in which He will deliver us

857
00:37:53,399 --> 00:37:56,399
through that adversity.

858
00:37:56,399 --> 00:38:00,899
He's with us in the storm.

859
00:38:00,899 --> 00:38:04,699
The disciples encountered storms in the boat.

860
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:07,399
The Lord was with them.

861
00:38:07,399 --> 00:38:08,599
We've often said this,

862
00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:09,599
that there are,

863
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:12,399
as we understand the attributes of God,

864
00:38:12,399 --> 00:38:13,799
the Bible reveals to us

865
00:38:13,799 --> 00:38:15,099
that our God is omnipotent.

866
00:38:15,099 --> 00:38:16,199
He has all power.

867
00:38:16,299 --> 00:38:18,099
He declares after His resurrection,

868
00:38:18,099 --> 00:38:20,799
all power is given unto Me in heaven and on earth.

869
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:23,099
And we understand that He is the Lord God omnipotent,

870
00:38:23,099 --> 00:38:24,599
that He has all power,

871
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:26,499
and no doubt He could prevent

872
00:38:26,499 --> 00:38:29,299
any difficulty in your life and in my life.

873
00:38:29,299 --> 00:38:31,199
And if we'd be honest this morning,

874
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:33,099
we would say we'd be okay

875
00:38:33,099 --> 00:38:36,099
if He would deliver us from any problem.

876
00:38:36,099 --> 00:38:36,699
Amen?

877
00:38:36,699 --> 00:38:38,099
We don't like problems.

878
00:38:38,099 --> 00:38:41,099
I don't like problems.

879
00:38:41,099 --> 00:38:42,099
But the reality is that

880
00:38:42,099 --> 00:38:43,899
sometimes God's delivering us

881
00:38:43,899 --> 00:38:46,299
through the problem.

882
00:38:46,299 --> 00:38:48,399
And He's proving us.

883
00:38:48,399 --> 00:38:49,299
And He's developing us.

884
00:38:49,299 --> 00:38:51,599
And He's being glorified.

885
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:57,599
And we find that there's this better resurrection.

886
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:01,000
Can you imagine how Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,

887
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,599
I mean, obviously we wouldn't read the passage as we do.

888
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:08,799
Can you imagine as we couple that thought

889
00:39:08,799 --> 00:39:12,599
with the thought of if they had accepted deliverance,

890
00:39:12,699 --> 00:39:16,299
and then couple that thought with what John says in 1 John

891
00:39:16,299 --> 00:39:19,500
about those that would be ashamed of His appearing,

892
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,299
I wonder how Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego

893
00:39:21,299 --> 00:39:27,299
would have felt if they went ahead and bowed down.

894
00:39:27,299 --> 00:39:30,500
First of all, we would not read it the way that we read it.

895
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:31,000
Right?

896
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Because Nebuchadnezzar never would have sent them into the fire.

897
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Because he simply said if you're going to bow down,

898
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,299
you don't have to go into the fire.

899
00:39:37,299 --> 00:39:39,500
What if they accepted it?

900
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,500
What if they said, okay, that's easy.

901
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:44,500
You know what, we justify it in our minds.

902
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:47,000
And we don't really mean it, God, but we're going to...

903
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,399
You know what I mean?

904
00:39:49,399 --> 00:39:52,399
We wouldn't read Daniel 3 the way that we read Daniel 3.

905
00:39:52,399 --> 00:39:57,099
And I believe as the Apostle John says in 1 John

906
00:39:57,099 --> 00:39:59,899
when he talks about the fact that our God is going to return

907
00:39:59,899 --> 00:40:01,399
in verse 28 of chapter 2, he says,

908
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:04,399
Our little children abide in Him that when He shall appear...

909
00:40:04,399 --> 00:40:09,959
we may have confidence and not be ashamed before him it is coming."

910
00:40:09,959 --> 00:40:13,919
I'm thankful that they didn't accept deliverance.

911
00:40:13,919 --> 00:40:22,099
We know that they were delivered by God, but they didn't accept deliverance from Nebuchadnezzar.

912
00:40:22,099 --> 00:40:27,559
We find that these others that were stoned, that were sawn asunder, the folks that dealt

913
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:34,559
with these adversities, that they might obtain a better resurrection, that we could stand

914
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:44,019
before the Lord knowing that we are faithful unto death, unto the end, right?

915
00:40:44,019 --> 00:40:48,319
We notice not only that truth with regard to these that dealt with these adversities,

916
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:52,799
these others, but notice the statement in verse 38.

917
00:40:52,799 --> 00:40:59,239
Only to begin it, it's in parenthesis, of whom the world was not worthy.

918
00:40:59,239 --> 00:41:04,999
You know, the reality is that our worth is not based on what the world says.

919
00:41:04,999 --> 00:41:06,919
The world hates you?

920
00:41:06,919 --> 00:41:07,919
Don't be surprised by that.

921
00:41:07,919 --> 00:41:08,919
They hated Jesus.

922
00:41:08,919 --> 00:41:12,939
By the way, isn't that what Jesus said in John when he was preparing his disciples?

923
00:41:12,939 --> 00:41:15,199
I mean, if they hate you, you've got to understand that they hated me first.

924
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:21,179
That's what Jesus says to the disciples, and the reality is that we're not looking for

925
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:24,999
acceptance or worthiness by the world's standard.

926
00:41:24,999 --> 00:41:29,899
We can rejoice in the truth of Ephesians when he says that we're accepted in the Beloved.

927
00:41:29,899 --> 00:41:30,899
Why?

928
00:41:30,899 --> 00:41:33,099
Because Jesus Christ is our Savior.

929
00:41:33,099 --> 00:41:34,099
We've been born again.

930
00:41:34,099 --> 00:41:36,859
We've been adopted in the family of God.

931
00:41:36,859 --> 00:41:42,339
We see that the Bible says of whom the world was not worthy, but I'm thankful that though

932
00:41:42,339 --> 00:41:47,659
the world might scourge us, and though the world might mock us, and though the world

933
00:41:47,659 --> 00:41:55,979
might imprison us, and though the world might kill us, I'm not looking for acceptance by

934
00:41:55,979 --> 00:41:57,939
the world.

935
00:41:57,939 --> 00:42:04,259
I'm thankful to be a child of God and to know that one day, one glorious day, I will see

936
00:42:04,259 --> 00:42:08,299
Him face to face, and we shall be like Him.

937
00:42:08,299 --> 00:42:11,459
And what a great truth that is.

938
00:42:11,459 --> 00:42:13,659
We notice the accomplishments.

939
00:42:13,659 --> 00:42:15,339
We notice the adversities.

940
00:42:15,339 --> 00:42:23,019
If we likened the accomplishments to faith on the mountaintop, we would liken the adversities

941
00:42:23,019 --> 00:42:25,739
to faith in the valley.

942
00:42:25,739 --> 00:42:26,819
We need faith in the valley.

943
00:42:26,819 --> 00:42:28,979
We need faith on the mountaintop.

944
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:31,459
We need to live by faith.

945
00:42:31,459 --> 00:42:38,499
And help us not to believe the lie of the enemy, to think that if we live by faith that

946
00:42:38,499 --> 00:42:41,619
that means we'll have no problems.

947
00:42:41,619 --> 00:42:47,139
Paul is reminded of a truth in 2 Timothy when Paul says to Timothy,

948
00:42:47,139 --> 00:42:52,339
Yea, all those that live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.

949
00:42:52,339 --> 00:42:58,019
By the way, when you begin to think about Ezra and Nehemiah, those guys had a certain

950
00:42:58,019 --> 00:43:03,619
level of comfort and ease until they went to go do something for God by faith, and all

951
00:43:03,619 --> 00:43:05,899
of a sudden the adversity showed up.

952
00:43:05,899 --> 00:43:07,859
The adversary showed up.

953
00:43:07,859 --> 00:43:08,859
Right?

954
00:43:09,099 --> 00:43:11,739
Sanballat and Tobiah, you read about those guys.

955
00:43:11,739 --> 00:43:13,419
And many others.

956
00:43:13,419 --> 00:43:19,099
And we find here that there are a list of accomplishments, there's a list of adversities,

957
00:43:19,099 --> 00:43:23,619
but then I notice as we conclude the passage of Scripture, I notice all.

958
00:43:23,619 --> 00:43:25,699
You say, that's weird.

959
00:43:25,699 --> 00:43:26,699
I understand it's weird.

960
00:43:26,699 --> 00:43:29,219
I thought it was weird when I wrote it down too.

961
00:43:29,219 --> 00:43:32,579
But the reality is that in verse number 39 it says this,

962
00:43:32,579 --> 00:43:36,779
And these all.

963
00:43:36,779 --> 00:43:37,779
These all.

964
00:43:37,779 --> 00:43:38,779
What does all mean?

965
00:43:38,819 --> 00:43:42,499
There was a Bible college professor that was super deep, and he said, I'm going to give

966
00:43:42,499 --> 00:43:47,459
you a lot of insight this morning, I'm going to tell you that all means all, and that's

967
00:43:47,459 --> 00:43:50,619
all that all means.

968
00:43:50,619 --> 00:43:56,059
And Brother Bish, he pastored for a number of years and he's with the Lord now, he was

969
00:43:56,059 --> 00:44:00,739
a Bible college professor, he's a great man, and I remember that day, there were many times

970
00:44:00,739 --> 00:44:06,819
that he would do something of that nature where he would begin to enter into class and

971
00:44:06,859 --> 00:44:11,699
you'd think that he was going to give you this just deep, profound, and you'd get your

972
00:44:11,699 --> 00:44:13,819
pen out and you're ready.

973
00:44:13,819 --> 00:44:17,219
And then he'd say something like that, and you'd be like, you know what, that is good

974
00:44:17,219 --> 00:44:18,219
though.

975
00:44:18,219 --> 00:44:20,099
It's true.

976
00:44:20,099 --> 00:44:22,059
All does mean all.

977
00:44:22,059 --> 00:44:27,219
And when I read it, when it says in these all, my mind races back, not just to verse

978
00:44:27,219 --> 00:44:33,179
number 32, but all the way back to the beginning of the 11th chapter of the book of Hebrews,

979
00:44:33,179 --> 00:44:38,259
we begin to see all, remember every era of human history, remember not every name is

980
00:44:38,259 --> 00:44:43,259
mentioned because it says of Samuel and of the prophets, and so we begin to think about

981
00:44:43,259 --> 00:44:50,339
all of these, the entire body of people represented by what is given to us in Hebrews chapter

982
00:44:50,339 --> 00:44:57,739
number 11, these all having obtained a good report through faith.

983
00:44:57,739 --> 00:45:01,339
We're going to deal with the last name in just a moment, but I want you to understand

984
00:45:01,459 --> 00:45:09,899
that when we look at this list of people, there's not a better report or a better testimony

985
00:45:09,899 --> 00:45:15,339
that they receive because of accomplishment or because of adversity.

986
00:45:15,339 --> 00:45:19,459
They all receive a good report through faith.

987
00:45:19,459 --> 00:45:22,019
Because God's interested in our faith.

988
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:27,659
Remember, success is not measured in God's eyes the same way man measures success.

989
00:45:27,739 --> 00:45:32,259
It's not appropriate for us to say, well, David was better than Micaiah.

990
00:45:32,259 --> 00:45:36,779
No, they both were faithful and they both lived by faith.

991
00:45:36,779 --> 00:45:42,979
We could look at some that seem to be great pillars and wonderful things that were accomplished

992
00:45:42,979 --> 00:45:48,099
and we look at others and say, man, they were faithful, but they just suffered and they

993
00:45:48,099 --> 00:45:49,099
were afflicted.

994
00:45:49,099 --> 00:45:51,619
I mentioned to the family last night as we're having devotions.

995
00:45:51,619 --> 00:45:55,699
So often we talk about these great things that have happened with the people of God

996
00:45:55,699 --> 00:46:02,779
and we should and we rejoice and we enjoy speaking about the triumphs of Scripture.

997
00:46:02,779 --> 00:46:04,179
How often do we hear a message?

998
00:46:04,179 --> 00:46:11,379
I ask myself, how often do I preach a message on John the Baptist being beheaded?

999
00:46:11,379 --> 00:46:15,739
I've preached on it before, but it's certainly not my favorite topic to go to.

1000
00:46:15,739 --> 00:46:18,299
I like dealing with some of those great accomplishments.

1001
00:46:18,299 --> 00:46:22,339
But you know what the Bible says that Jesus says about John the Baptist?

1002
00:46:22,339 --> 00:46:26,539
That he was a bright and burning light.

1003
00:46:26,539 --> 00:46:27,739
He fulfilled his role.

1004
00:46:27,739 --> 00:46:29,539
He did what he was called to do.

1005
00:46:29,539 --> 00:46:30,619
He lived by faith.

1006
00:46:30,619 --> 00:46:35,939
He stood before the king and he gave him a message from the Lord and it wasn't a very

1007
00:46:35,939 --> 00:46:39,739
well-received message.

1008
00:46:39,739 --> 00:46:43,259
Herod wanted to kill John the Baptist, but he couldn't because he was afraid of the people.

1009
00:46:43,259 --> 00:46:46,219
If you read the passage, you understand what happened and he says, well, you know, I made

1010
00:46:46,219 --> 00:46:48,619
an oath that I would do whatever they asked for.

1011
00:46:49,619 --> 00:46:57,059
But the reality is that it says, and these all, having obtained a good report through

1012
00:46:57,059 --> 00:47:02,859
faith, if you live by faith, you please God.

1013
00:47:02,859 --> 00:47:05,699
Without faith, it is impossible to please him.

1014
00:47:05,699 --> 00:47:10,379
But if you live by faith, you please God.

1015
00:47:10,379 --> 00:47:18,219
And in pleasing God, it's not measured by, well, you know, sometimes pre-COVID because

1016
00:47:18,219 --> 00:47:19,699
COVID's messed everything up.

1017
00:47:19,699 --> 00:47:24,979
But sometimes, unfortunately, even within Christian circles, someone will look at the

1018
00:47:24,979 --> 00:47:33,139
success or the faithfulness of a pastor based on the size of the congregation.

1019
00:47:33,139 --> 00:47:37,059
But the reality is the church is God's, amen?

1020
00:47:37,059 --> 00:47:41,819
And I believe, and I've said this for years, I believe that there's some men that pastor

1021
00:47:41,819 --> 00:47:46,819
in some remote parts of this nation and other parts of the world that have just a handful

1022
00:47:46,819 --> 00:47:51,859
of people and they're going to be rewarded in like fashion, maybe even in greater fashion

1023
00:47:51,859 --> 00:47:53,499
than some that have some of the largest churches.

1024
00:47:53,499 --> 00:47:54,499
Why?

1025
00:47:54,499 --> 00:47:55,499
Because they were faithful.

1026
00:47:55,499 --> 00:47:56,499
They were faithful.

1027
00:47:56,499 --> 00:48:03,659
Moreover, it's required in the steward that a man be found faithful.

1028
00:48:03,659 --> 00:48:09,459
We're seeing the faithfulness of these people and we notice all, all of them have received,

1029
00:48:09,459 --> 00:48:12,979
they've obtained this good report and it was through faith.

1030
00:48:12,979 --> 00:48:16,679
We understand the last phrase of verse number 39.

1031
00:48:16,679 --> 00:48:20,359
That's what it says, received not the promise.

1032
00:48:20,359 --> 00:48:25,359
Now let me ensure, just ensure you this morning that there's no contradiction in scripture.

1033
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:26,639
I'm thankful for that.

1034
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:33,119
In verse 33, it says of the list of accomplishments that they obtain promises, but now it says

1035
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:35,519
this, that they receive not the promise.

1036
00:48:35,519 --> 00:48:36,519
There's an important aspect.

1037
00:48:36,519 --> 00:48:41,279
Listen, every jot and tittle in our English Bible, every letter, right?

1038
00:48:41,279 --> 00:48:42,859
Every word of God is pure.

1039
00:48:42,859 --> 00:48:48,699
But it says promises in verse number 33 and it says promise in verse number 39.

1040
00:48:48,699 --> 00:48:50,019
What's it referring to in verse number 39?

1041
00:48:50,019 --> 00:48:53,579
Well, the reality in verse number 33, there were promises that God gave and they received

1042
00:48:53,579 --> 00:48:54,819
those promises.

1043
00:48:54,819 --> 00:48:59,419
But the promise that is mentioned in verse number 39 is the coming of Messiah.

1044
00:48:59,419 --> 00:49:05,299
Remember, all the way back in Genesis chapter number 3, God promised that his, that Messiah

1045
00:49:05,299 --> 00:49:06,299
would come.

1046
00:49:06,299 --> 00:49:12,259
And all throughout the Old Testament, there is a picture in type after type of Messiah

1047
00:49:12,659 --> 00:49:13,659
who would one day come.

1048
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:18,979
The book of Hebrews deals in such depth with all of those pictures and all those typologies.

1049
00:49:18,979 --> 00:49:23,979
And now, as the writer of Hebrews concludes this 11th chapter, he speaks about all those

1050
00:49:23,979 --> 00:49:28,259
Old Testament saints and how they lived by faith, but they received not the promise.

1051
00:49:28,259 --> 00:49:31,339
Jesus did not come in their time.

1052
00:49:31,339 --> 00:49:33,499
Messiah had not come.

1053
00:49:33,499 --> 00:49:37,819
Paul says in the book of Galatians, when the fullness of time was come, that God sent forth

1054
00:49:37,819 --> 00:49:40,139
his son.

1055
00:49:40,139 --> 00:49:43,899
We understand that as Paul continues, he sent them forth for a purpose and that was to live

1056
00:49:43,899 --> 00:49:48,139
a sinless, perfect life, to go to the cross of Calvary, to bleed and die, to be buried

1057
00:49:48,139 --> 00:49:52,259
and to rise again, conquering sin, death, and the grave.

1058
00:49:52,259 --> 00:49:57,659
And so we look at the portion of Scripture and we understand they received not the promise.

1059
00:49:57,659 --> 00:50:03,939
They looked for Messiah, but in their lifetime, he never came.

1060
00:50:03,939 --> 00:50:04,419
Because God's...

1061
00:50:04,419 --> 00:50:12,899
timing is perfect. He's never late. He's rarely early. He's always on time because

1062
00:50:12,899 --> 00:50:18,899
God has a plan. And we find that it continues and ends in verse number 40

1063
00:50:18,899 --> 00:50:25,539
and it says this, God having provided some better thing, look at those next two

1064
00:50:25,539 --> 00:50:31,219
words, for us. Now it's interesting because if you go all the way back to

1065
00:50:31,219 --> 00:50:36,219
the beginning of chapter 11, he says this in verse number 3, we dealt with

1066
00:50:36,219 --> 00:50:41,939
this, for through faith, we. Remember we dealt with this with regard to creation

1067
00:50:41,939 --> 00:50:45,479
and we talked about the fact that there's a record all throughout the

1068
00:50:45,479 --> 00:50:49,459
scriptures of those that believed in creation and even we, those that he's

1069
00:50:49,459 --> 00:50:54,739
being written to, and we still today, we understand creation through faith. We

1070
00:50:54,739 --> 00:50:58,859
take God at his word. We believe that the account of Genesis is a true

1071
00:50:58,859 --> 00:51:04,819
account and we believe that God said and it was so. And we find that from

1072
00:51:04,819 --> 00:51:08,659
verse number 3, beginning in verse number 4, all the way through verse number 39,

1073
00:51:08,659 --> 00:51:15,899
he's talking about these other people. Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Sarah. You go

1074
00:51:15,899 --> 00:51:21,819
through the list. You get to Joseph and before then Jacob and you look at Moses

1075
00:51:21,819 --> 00:51:25,499
and you look at Rahab and you look at and then he deals with we don't have the

1076
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:29,979
time and let me just list all these people and all these events. And what is

1077
00:51:29,979 --> 00:51:37,619
he doing? He's referencing them, others, people of history. But then he brings it

1078
00:51:37,619 --> 00:51:46,979
back. God having provided some better thing for us. Notice that they, all those

1079
00:51:46,979 --> 00:51:52,019
that we've been talking about, without us should not be made perfect. So we look at

1080
00:51:52,059 --> 00:51:56,579
and we begin to say, what is God talking about? Well, God has a perfect timeline of

1081
00:51:56,579 --> 00:52:00,459
history. And we can look at the history and we can begin to

1082
00:52:00,459 --> 00:52:05,859
analyze the end times and we can give a chart of eschatology that's revealed to

1083
00:52:05,859 --> 00:52:08,979
us in the Word of God. We don't know the dates of what's going to happen, but we

1084
00:52:08,979 --> 00:52:11,939
understand the timeline. We understand what God has told us is going to take

1085
00:52:11,939 --> 00:52:16,199
place. And we understand the next event on the prophetic calendar is the

1086
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:20,099
rapture. And when that happens, we can draw out a timeline and know exactly the

1087
00:52:21,059 --> 00:52:26,139
dates, but the timeline of what happens. And what we see here is that all of

1088
00:52:26,139 --> 00:52:30,299
those that have been mentioned in Hebrews chapter 11, those Old Testament saints

1089
00:52:30,299 --> 00:52:36,779
that are referenced, they were looking back, or excuse me, looking forward to the

1090
00:52:36,779 --> 00:52:43,179
Incarnation. They were looking forward to Messiah coming. But we, like these first

1091
00:52:43,179 --> 00:52:48,459
century believers, we live on this side of Calvary. And we're looking back

1092
00:52:48,539 --> 00:52:53,259
understanding that Jesus did come, that he did complete the work of redemption.

1093
00:52:53,259 --> 00:52:57,099
The plan of redemption has been completed. He said it is finished. And

1094
00:52:57,099 --> 00:53:02,619
then he gave up the ghost. And we find that he completed the plan of redemption.

1095
00:53:02,619 --> 00:53:07,459
And I understand as I look at this whole thing and I begin to look at God's

1096
00:53:07,459 --> 00:53:12,219
perfect timeline, listen, sometimes we say, when is he gonna come back? He's

1097
00:53:12,219 --> 00:53:16,619
gonna come back on time. I don't know when he's gonna come back. But all I know

1098
00:53:16,739 --> 00:53:20,819
is that I've been given marching orders. Occupy till I come. Redeem the time for

1099
00:53:20,819 --> 00:53:24,619
the days are evil. Go and preach the gospel to every creature. These are

1100
00:53:24,619 --> 00:53:29,179
commands that we've been given. And we understand that in God's perfect timeline,

1101
00:53:29,179 --> 00:53:33,939
listen, he might not return during your lifetime. Just like for the Old Testament

1102
00:53:33,939 --> 00:53:39,139
prophets, Christ didn't come the first time in their lifetime. But we rest

1103
00:53:39,139 --> 00:53:46,659
assured that there is this truth of having some better thing for us, that one

1104
00:53:46,659 --> 00:53:55,019
day, for all of eternity, my faith, your faith, will be made sight. We will see him

1105
00:53:55,019 --> 00:54:02,899
face to face. And we will be with him for all of eternity. And we begin to think

1106
00:54:02,899 --> 00:54:08,979
about that truth. And we begin to think about the completion of God's plan of

1107
00:54:09,339 --> 00:54:14,379
in our faith. And we begin to think, there's a great song, it is well with my

1108
00:54:14,379 --> 00:54:19,859
soul. Many of you know the song. In that last line, the last verse, when my faith

1109
00:54:19,859 --> 00:54:28,299
shall be made sight. And we understand this morning, that as we look at this

1110
00:54:28,299 --> 00:54:31,019
11th chapter, I wish I could get into chapter 12. By the way, do you have lunch

1111
00:54:31,019 --> 00:54:35,259
plans? We just keep on going, amen? I mean, it's exciting. But you enter, I'll give you

1112
00:54:35,259 --> 00:54:39,859
a preview of Hebrews chapter number 12. After he gives all of this great truth

1113
00:54:39,859 --> 00:54:46,539
of those that lived pre-Calvary, but lived by faith, and stayed faithful, and

1114
00:54:46,539 --> 00:54:51,059
did not accept that deliverance, they served God, some with great

1115
00:54:51,059 --> 00:54:55,059
accomplishments, some with great adversities. And then he says this,

1116
00:54:55,059 --> 00:54:59,499
we're foreseeing we also are encompassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses.

1117
00:54:59,499 --> 00:55:04,979
Let us lay aside every weight in the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us

1118
00:55:04,979 --> 00:55:09,379
run with patience the race that is set before us. You have a race, I have a race,

1119
00:55:09,379 --> 00:55:16,259
and we, on this side of Calvary, we still continue on looking unto Jesus, the

1120
00:55:16,259 --> 00:55:21,939
author and finisher of our faith. And begin to understand all that God is

1121
00:55:21,939 --> 00:55:25,619
giving us here, and to these first century believers that were dealing with

1122
00:55:25,619 --> 00:55:31,139
great adversity. For us today, in 2020, that are dealing with difficulty. Listen,

1123
00:55:31,139 --> 00:55:34,899
I get periodicals every day, I get emails about the fact that, man,

1124
00:55:34,899 --> 00:55:37,339
they're gonna close down churches, they're not gonna let you preach anymore,

1125
00:55:37,339 --> 00:55:42,979
they're gonna arrest you, they're gonna imprison you. We gotta be faithful, amen?

1126
00:55:42,979 --> 00:55:52,219
We live by faith, we trust God. I'd rather not go to jail, amen? But if that's what

1127
00:55:52,219 --> 00:56:00,659
happens, we live by faith. And we know that we could stand before God and

1128
00:56:00,659 --> 00:56:09,379
receive, as these did, a good report through faith. This morning, are we living

1129
00:56:09,379 --> 00:56:14,419
by faith? I know I've asked that question for a number of weeks now, as we've

1130
00:56:14,419 --> 00:56:21,219
studied Hebrews chapter 11. It's so easy to live by sight, it really is. But oh, we

1131
00:56:21,219 --> 00:56:26,219
have to embrace the promises of God. We have to understand that he will be with

1132
00:56:26,219 --> 00:56:31,739
us as he promised to be with us, that he will give us the power, that he will use

1133
00:56:31,739 --> 00:56:37,619
his word in the preaching of the gospel to save sinners. And that, as Paul said,

1134
00:56:37,619 --> 00:56:42,099
I'm gonna straight betwixt two. Having a desire to depart to be with Christ, which

1135
00:56:42,099 --> 00:56:47,779
is far better. That's what he said. For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.

1136
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:54,699
Why? Because I'm gonna be with them. And we looked this morning, these all, verse

1137
00:56:54,699 --> 00:57:00,419
number 39, they've obtained a good report through faith. We too, I believe, as we

1138
00:57:00,419 --> 00:57:06,099
look at the passage, we too can obtain a good report through faith. Without faith,

1139
00:57:06,099 --> 00:57:11,739
it's impossible to please him. Oh, that God would help us this morning to live

1140
00:57:11,739 --> 00:57:19,979
by faith, to believe God, to take God as his word. Let me tell you what Charles Spurgeon

1141
00:57:19,979 --> 00:57:24,539
said. I wasn't gonna use this quote, but I want to use it, and I hope it'll be a

1142
00:57:24,539 --> 00:57:28,939
blessing to you. And I want to tell you what, let me just look it up, I got it right here.

1143
00:57:28,939 --> 00:57:34,699
Here's what Charles Spurgeon said about faith. He said this, I would recommend you either

1144
00:57:34,699 --> 00:57:42,539
believe God up to the hilt, or else not to believe God at all. Believe this book of God,

1145
00:57:42,539 --> 00:57:50,899
every letter of it, or else reject it. There is no logical standing place between the two.

1146
00:57:50,899 --> 00:57:58,339
It's not a, I'll take some and leave some. It's all. He says this, be satisfied with

1147
00:57:58,339 --> 00:58:06,659
nothing less than a faith that swims in the deeps of divine revelation. A faith that paddles

1148
00:58:06,659 --> 00:58:13,499
about the edge of the water is poor faith at best. It is little better than a dry land

1149
00:58:13,499 --> 00:58:22,619
of faith, and is not good for much. What he's saying, believe God. Just believe God.

1150
00:58:22,619 --> 00:58:29,299
We had many years ago, some folks that would say things like this, you can take that to

1151
00:58:29,299 --> 00:58:32,819
the bank. What do they mean by that? Oh man, I'm gonna fulfill what I said I was gonna

1152
00:58:32,819 --> 00:58:39,940
do. Listen, every promise of God is in him, yea. He will do what he said he will do. He's

1153
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:46,500
not a man that he should lie. Amen? We serve a great God, and he's given us his revelation.

1154
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:51,219
And what does he want us to do? Believe him. Believe him. Live by faith. Father, we love

1155
00:58:51,219 --> 00:58:54,779
you this morning. We thank you for loving us. Thank you for your word and the truth

1156
00:58:54,779 --> 00:59:02,859
contained therein. We look at this great chapter. We love the Bible, all of it is so good. We

1157
00:59:02,859 --> 00:59:06,700
think about this particular chapter, and as we finish up this morning at this eleventh

1158
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:13,500
chapter of the book of Hebrews, Lord, we are encouraged by those that have gone before

1159
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:19,739
us and lived by faith, took you at your word. Those that had great accomplishments as they're

1160
00:59:19,739 --> 00:59:25,019
mentioned there. Those that dealt with great adversities that are mentioned there. Then

1161
00:59:25,019 --> 00:59:32,940
we notice all, and these all having obtained a good report through faith. God, I pray that

1162
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:38,859
you'd help us to live by faith, just as these examples were provided to these first century

1163
00:59:38,859 --> 00:59:48,339
believers. May we this morning be stirred up, challenged, and convicted to live by faith.

1164
00:59:48,339 --> 00:59:53,299
Help us to run our race. Help us to keep our eyes on the Lord Jesus Christ, the author

1165
00:59:53,299 --> 01:00:01,779
and finisher of our faith. Help us, Lord, to have an eternal perspective and to be used

1166
01:00:01,779 --> 01:00:04,179
to bring honor and glory to thy name.

1167
01:00:04,179 --> 01:00:04,779
Would you move?

1168
01:00:04,779 --> 01:00:08,699
and work this morning in the lives of your people.

1169
01:00:08,699 --> 01:00:10,239
As we have a moment of invitation,

1170
01:00:10,239 --> 01:00:13,659
I pray, God, that you would just help us to respond

1171
01:00:13,659 --> 01:00:16,039
in obedience to thy word.

1172
01:00:16,039 --> 01:00:17,779
As the Holy Spirit has spoken to each of us,

1173
01:00:17,779 --> 01:00:20,319
Lord, I pray that we would be doers of the word

1174
01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:21,399
and not hearers only.

1175
01:00:21,399 --> 01:00:25,039
I'll say yes, Lord, yes, to your will and to your way.

1176
01:00:25,039 --> 01:00:27,199
Thank you for speaking to our hearts.

1177
01:00:27,199 --> 01:00:28,959
I pray that you'd seal each decision that is made.

1178
01:00:28,959 --> 01:00:29,999
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

1179
01:00:29,999 --> 01:00:31,659
Would you stand with me, heads are bowed,

1180
01:00:31,659 --> 01:00:33,539
eyes are closed, no one's looking around.

1181
01:00:33,579 --> 01:00:35,139
As our custom is, we have an invitation

1182
01:00:35,139 --> 01:00:35,959
at the end of our service,

1183
01:00:35,959 --> 01:00:37,959
is give you an opportunity to respond

1184
01:00:37,959 --> 01:00:39,339
to how the Lord may have spoken to you

1185
01:00:39,339 --> 01:00:42,099
through the preaching of his word this morning.

1186
01:00:42,099 --> 01:00:43,639
Kimberly's gonna play quietly on the piano.

1187
01:00:43,639 --> 01:00:44,979
You can make your pew an altar.

1188
01:00:44,979 --> 01:00:46,899
You can come to this old-fashioned altar.

1189
01:00:46,899 --> 01:00:47,719
If you're not sure of heaven,

1190
01:00:47,719 --> 01:00:48,559
we'd love to take a Bible and show you

1191
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:50,779
that you know for sure that heaven is your home.

1192
01:00:50,779 --> 01:00:52,339
If you're a child of God and you just need to come

1193
01:00:52,339 --> 01:00:53,619
and ask God to help you,
