1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,719
Psalm 119 last week, as we started this brand new series that I've entitled, Teach Me.

2
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:11,960
And the heart cry of the psalmist, you see it oft repeated through the book of Psalms

3
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:18,659
a number of times in the 119th Psalm, is this heart cry, teach me.

4
00:00:18,659 --> 00:00:24,120
And I believe that we find, as we even discussed last week, that this heart cry of the psalmist

5
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:28,639
reveals his sincere desire to learn.

6
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:34,060
And as we express our desire to learn, I believe that it's important that we understand some

7
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,599
of the purposes of learning.

8
00:00:36,599 --> 00:00:42,599
And tonight, I just desire to really consider two purposes for learning.

9
00:00:42,599 --> 00:00:48,040
Admittedly, right at the beginning of this message tonight, obviously this is not intended

10
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:52,919
to be an exhaustive list of all of the purposes for learning.

11
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:57,279
So if you are taking notes and want a title, I've simply titled the message this evening,

12
00:00:57,279 --> 00:01:00,439
Two Purposes for Learning.

13
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:05,400
I believe that the Lord Jesus Christ is the master teacher, and we find that in the book

14
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,400
of Matthew.

15
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,919
In fact, if you read throughout the gospel accounts, you'll find many times in which

16
00:01:10,919 --> 00:01:16,160
the gospels make this record that Jesus taught them.

17
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:22,440
And you can read of accounts in which the settings are provided for us, and Jesus is

18
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:28,639
teaching, he's at times teaching the disciples, at times he's teaching multitudes, at times

19
00:01:28,639 --> 00:01:33,599
the religious leaders are there hearing the instruction, at times he's in the synagogue

20
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:34,599
teaching.

21
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:39,000
I mean, you just look through the gospels and you will find a number of accounts in

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,599
which Jesus is teaching.

23
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:47,360
And we find that here in Matthew chapter number 7, it's interesting, at the end of the passage,

24
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,879
really as we look at Matthew 5, 6, and 7, the Sermon on the Mountain, we find that at

25
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:56,279
the conclusion in verse number 29, notice what the Word of God says,

26
00:01:56,279 --> 00:02:05,120
For he, speaking of Jesus, taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.

27
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:11,039
And that's a great verse of Scripture in understanding the way that Jesus, as the master teacher,

28
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,240
he taught with authority.

29
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:19,820
And you'll remember in John chapter number 3 and verse number 2, Jesus is there and Nicodemus

30
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,899
comes to Jesus by night, and he makes the statement,

31
00:02:22,899 --> 00:02:27,820
We know that thou art a teacher sent from God.

32
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:32,779
And it's interesting, as you would consider the teaching ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ,

33
00:02:32,779 --> 00:02:38,380
we know that his purpose for coming to the earth was not simply to teach, his purpose

34
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:43,380
for coming to the earth was to be our Savior, to die on the cross of Calvary, which he fulfilled

35
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:50,199
and finished, but while he was on earth, man, did he teach some wonderful truth.

36
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:53,820
And we find that it's interesting, for the Bible says here in our verse, our springboard

37
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:57,820
verse, For he taught them as one having authority, but I want you to turn over a few chapters

38
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:03,179
in the book of Matthew in the 11th chapter, and I want you to consider a phrase that really

39
00:03:03,179 --> 00:03:09,539
is an invitation here that is given, and there are several points within these verses of

40
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:14,240
Scripture you could preach an entire message, in fact, I have in the past from this portion

41
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,240
of Scripture.

42
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:19,199
It's a familiar passage, but I want to note a statement in verse number 29, beginning

43
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:23,919
in verse 28 of Matthew 11, the Bible says, Come unto me, all you that labor and are heavy

44
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:27,460
laid in, and I will give you rest.

45
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:33,039
Take my yoke upon you, notice this phrase, and learn of me.

46
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:38,119
For I am meek and lowly in heart, and you shall find rest unto your souls.

47
00:03:38,119 --> 00:03:42,619
For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.

48
00:03:42,619 --> 00:03:47,179
There in verse number 29, it says, Learn of me, and learn of me.

49
00:03:47,179 --> 00:03:53,779
It said there in Matthew 7 that he taught as one that had authority, and he then offers

50
00:03:53,779 --> 00:03:59,100
this invitation to come unto him, and part of what they would do is they would learn

51
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,100
of him.

52
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:05,860
In fact, there are records in which the Scriptures give us where the disciples learned valuable

53
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,860
lessons.

54
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:11,660
They learned from the teaching that Jesus gave them, and when we think about learning

55
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:17,959
and we think about the importance of identifying some of the purposes of learning, I mentioned

56
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:24,079
last week in our introductory message that the purpose of learning is not to just accumulate

57
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:25,079
wealth.

58
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:30,160
The idea is not a prideful motive, a look at what I know in comparison to what someone

59
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,000
else knows.

60
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,359
And as we consider this subject matter, I believe that as we have pure, God-honoring

61
00:04:37,359 --> 00:04:44,000
motives that would fuel that desire of ours to learn, that I believe that the Lord Jesus

62
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,239
Christ will graciously teach us.

63
00:04:47,239 --> 00:04:52,320
It's interesting that during the earthly ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ, many accounts

64
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,480
are given where he's teaching, and he says that they should come and learn of him.

65
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,339
And I mentioned this last week, but before we get into the points tonight, it's important

66
00:05:01,339 --> 00:05:05,779
for us to understand that the Holy Spirit of God is the divine teacher, and I'm thankful

67
00:05:05,779 --> 00:05:10,660
that one of the ministries, he's the comforter, and how thankful I am for that.

68
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:16,540
He convicts us, and it's wonderful to be convicted, but he teaches us.

69
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:20,700
And I'm thankful for that ministry of the Holy Spirit of God, and we have the complete

70
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:26,260
canon of God's Word, and he teaches us, and what a blessing that is.

71
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:30,779
Two thoughts this evening I mentioned by the title, Two Purposes for Learning.

72
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:37,779
Number one, the application of truth, the application of truth, our purpose, one purpose

73
00:05:37,779 --> 00:05:40,619
of learning is doing.

74
00:05:40,619 --> 00:05:43,220
Really doesn't make a whole lot of sense to learn something if we're not going to do it,

75
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,140
if we're not going to apply it.

76
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:50,859
And we're not just trying to accumulate this information, as I mentioned a moment ago.

77
00:05:50,859 --> 00:05:55,540
And I believe that the simplicity of this truth or this thought, the application of

78
00:05:55,540 --> 00:06:00,179
truth being the first of these two purposes that we'll look at this evening, the simplicity

79
00:06:00,179 --> 00:06:03,380
of this truth must not be overlooked.

80
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:07,899
As you think about the Christian life, and you think about the importance of growing

81
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:13,579
and learning, we find that we learn these principles from the Word of God with the purpose

82
00:06:13,579 --> 00:06:18,380
of applying these principles in our lives, that as I study the Word of God, as I read

83
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:23,859
the Word of God, as I hear the Word of God taught and preached, that I'm anxiously desiring

84
00:06:23,859 --> 00:06:31,540
and seeking, excitedly desiring the Lord to show me how this truth applies in my life,

85
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:37,019
how I can take and apply the principles that we're learning from the Word of God.

86
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:40,940
The reality is that I cannot do what I have not learned.

87
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,339
It's a pretty simple statement.

88
00:06:43,339 --> 00:06:45,420
I cannot do what I have not learned.

89
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:49,179
Has anyone ever asked you to do something that you don't have the knowledge of doing?

90
00:06:49,179 --> 00:06:53,059
Someone's asked you to do something and you simply can't fulfill the task.

91
00:06:53,059 --> 00:06:54,059
Why?

92
00:06:54,059 --> 00:06:57,059
Because you don't know how to do it.

93
00:06:57,059 --> 00:07:01,059
But the reality is that I must, biblically speaking, we're speaking about the spiritual

94
00:07:01,059 --> 00:07:06,339
aspect of teach me, I must do that which I have learned.

95
00:07:06,339 --> 00:07:12,059
God holds us accountable for those truths that He reveals to us and the truth that He

96
00:07:12,059 --> 00:07:14,779
teaches us, and we are to be doers of the Word.

97
00:07:14,779 --> 00:07:19,179
Turn to the book of Deuteronomy, if you will, to the fourth chapter, and I'm just going

98
00:07:19,179 --> 00:07:22,579
to look at a few verses here in the book of Deuteronomy, and then we'll look at a couple

99
00:07:22,579 --> 00:07:25,179
of New Testament truths as well.

100
00:07:25,179 --> 00:07:29,579
But look in Deuteronomy chapter number four in verse number five, and notice what Moses

101
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:34,660
says to the children of Israel with regard to the teaching of the Word of God.

102
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:39,500
In fact, he begins in verse number one of Deuteronomy four, now therefore hearken, O

103
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,140
Israel, unto the statutes and unto the judgments which I teach you.

104
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:47,700
Notice this next phrase, for to do them that you may live and go in and possess the land

105
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,220
which the Lord God of your fathers giveth you.

106
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:55,619
Notice verse number five, behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as

107
00:07:55,619 --> 00:07:58,100
the Lord my God commanded me.

108
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:04,700
The next phrase, that ye should do so in the land whither you go to possess it.

109
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:11,459
Keep therefore and do them, notice this, for this is your wisdom and your understanding

110
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:16,700
in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these statutes and say, surely this great

111
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:21,179
nation is a wise and understanding people.

112
00:08:21,179 --> 00:08:25,459
It's interesting as we know and go through this initial point, I'll make some comments

113
00:08:25,459 --> 00:08:30,299
at the end with regard to knowledge versus wisdom, but you see here in verse number six

114
00:08:30,299 --> 00:08:35,859
when he says, keep therefore and do them, for this is your wisdom and your understanding

115
00:08:35,859 --> 00:08:37,820
in the sight of the nations.

116
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:41,700
As we think about these verses of Scripture and the importance of them and the fact that

117
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:47,299
he's saying, I have taught you, but the purpose of teaching you, the purpose of giving you

118
00:08:47,299 --> 00:08:50,159
is to do them, to apply them.

119
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:56,840
Chapter five in verse number one, the Bible says here, and Moses called all Israel and

120
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:03,299
said unto them, hear, O Israel, the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this

121
00:09:03,299 --> 00:09:04,299
day.

122
00:09:04,299 --> 00:09:07,859
So hear them for what purpose, that ye may learn them.

123
00:09:07,859 --> 00:09:12,919
Remember when the psalmist said, teach me, we say that that reveals a sincere desire

124
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:19,859
to learn, that we may learn them and keep and do them.

125
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:25,739
In chapter 17 in verse number 19 of the book of Deuteronomy, it's so often repeated I could

126
00:09:25,739 --> 00:09:30,659
look at a whole host of verses throughout the entirety of the book of Deuteronomy.

127
00:09:30,659 --> 00:09:36,340
It's repeated over and over, but look at this one as our final one this evening.

128
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:40,940
In Deuteronomy 17 in verse number 19, the Bible says, and it shall be with him and he

129
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:46,219
shall read therein all the days of his life that he may learn to fear the Lord his God,

130
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:50,580
to keep all the words of this law and these statutes, to do them.

131
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:56,260
Contextually here in this passage of Scripture, it's with regard to the kings and the importance

132
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:59,700
of when God would place a king over his people.

133
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,460
that they would take, it says in verse number 18,

134
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,380
and it shall be when he sitteth upon the throne

135
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:08,100
of his kingdom, that he shall write him a copy of this law

136
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,300
and a book out of that which is before the priests,

137
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,340
the Levites.

138
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:15,980
Now think about that, the king writing the law of the Lord.

139
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:19,140
I've never written all of the Pentateuch

140
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,780
in some kind of notebook paper

141
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,540
and you probably haven't either.

142
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,500
I know that there are accounts of those

143
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,300
where Bibles are not readily available,

144
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,940
where they do write out word for word

145
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,620
the scriptures because they have one Bible

146
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,420
amongst a group of believers

147
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,300
and the only way for them to have any portion

148
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,980
of the scriptures if they write it out themselves.

149
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,380
But I will say this, when you write out the scripture,

150
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,580
it helps us to remember it, doesn't it?

151
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:45,220
And as we remember it, we're mindful of it,

152
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,900
it goes a long distance in helping us

153
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,900
to perform it or to do it.

154
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:53,960
It doesn't immediately mean that we will do it

155
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,620
just because we've written it,

156
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:58,420
but the reality is that he tells them the purpose

157
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,180
at the end of verse number 19,

158
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,100
that they would have these words of the law

159
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,100
and these statutes, but to do them,

160
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,700
the purpose of the application of truth.

161
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,180
We're familiar with James 1 in verse number 22,

162
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:13,860
we use the verse of scripture often and rightly so,

163
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:18,100
that we are to be doers of the word and not hearers only.

164
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:22,900
How often in my life, perhaps if you'd evaluate your life,

165
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:26,340
have we been guilty of not applying truth,

166
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:29,180
not applying that which we've been taught?

167
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,900
Philippians chapter number four in verse number nine,

168
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,540
we'll look at this verse a couple of times this evening.

169
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,940
I want you to just look at a single word in this verse,

170
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,460
I'll read the entirety of it,

171
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,820
but in Philippians chapter number four in verse number nine,

172
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:43,220
Paul is writing to these believers

173
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,340
and he's concluding this letter.

174
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,180
And notice what he says in verse number nine

175
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,740
of Philippians four,

176
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,180
those things which ye have both learned,

177
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:53,580
I'll give you a second,

178
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:56,620
those things that ye have both learned

179
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:00,100
and received and heard and seen in me,

180
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,940
what's that next word?

181
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:02,780
Do.

182
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:07,860
Paul said I've taught, I've instructed, I've given,

183
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,860
I have fulfilled my responsibility in teaching

184
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,820
and I've lived out that which I'm teaching.

185
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,820
He said that not only the things that you learned

186
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,060
and received and heard,

187
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:21,780
but he says the things that you've seen in me, do.

188
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,820
The God of peace shall be with you.

189
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:28,380
So we find this evening that one of the purposes

190
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,300
for learning is the application of truth.

191
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,820
I learned the principles of the word of God

192
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,700
so that I can apply them in my life,

193
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,460
so that I can do them.

194
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:41,940
We think about the difference between knowledge and wisdom.

195
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:46,940
Knowledge would really be the idea of information learned,

196
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,900
having facts, if you will,

197
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:53,220
the accumulation of truth, of facts, of principles.

198
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:56,940
But wisdom is the application

199
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,540
of that information that has been learned.

200
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,980
So I have all of these truths,

201
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,420
I have all of these principles,

202
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:06,220
I have all of these precepts that I've learned,

203
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,900
these facts, and that's knowledge.

204
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,380
But the appropriate application

205
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:14,260
of that information is wisdom.

206
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,620
We're to walk in wisdom.

207
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:21,020
Someone said this, that knowledge is knowing what to say.

208
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:24,780
Wisdom is knowing when to say it.

209
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:31,300
Knowing what to say versus knowing when to say it.

210
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,460
Let me illustrate it this way.

211
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,300
Knowledge, and this is an original with me,

212
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,860
I heard it years ago, but it is quite comical.

213
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:44,780
Knowledge is knowing that a tomato is a fruit.

214
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:50,700
Wisdom is not putting tomatoes in fruit salad

215
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,140
or in a fruit smoothie, right?

216
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,220
You say, oh, that's kind of,

217
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,180
it just helps us kind of see the difference

218
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,540
between the knowledge and the wisdom.

219
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,660
And we think about the application of truth,

220
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,140
that's wisdom, that's walking in wisdom.

221
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:08,940
Yes, we're to have knowledge, we're to get knowledge,

222
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,220
we're to get understanding,

223
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,900
and we understand the Word of God teaches that,

224
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,779
but the purpose of getting the knowledge,

225
00:14:16,779 --> 00:14:19,420
the purpose of learning the precepts,

226
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:22,420
the purpose of crying out to the Lord, teach me,

227
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:25,940
the purpose of Jesus teaching during His earthly ministry,

228
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:29,340
the purpose of Jesus inviting them to come learn of Him

229
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:32,620
is so that we would apply the truth.

230
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,940
Not just so that we could have head knowledge,

231
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:37,160
not so that we could answer some questionnaires,

232
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:41,620
not so that we could do well on some Bible trivia game,

233
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:45,779
but so that we can apply the truth in our lives.

234
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:49,559
The application of truth is the first of the two reasons

235
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:52,260
or purposes for learning that we look at this evening.

236
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:55,260
The second is the dissemination of truth.

237
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:59,600
The reality is that I learn that I might teach others.

238
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,760
I learn that I might teach others.

239
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,779
We see this throughout the Word of God,

240
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:07,900
we see this illustrated in the lives

241
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,660
of many of God's servants.

242
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,559
I'll use two examples this evening.

243
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,559
One from the Old and one from the New Testament.

244
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:16,960
Look in the book of 2 Chronicles, if you will,

245
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:21,240
and look at Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, Jehoshaphat.

246
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,240
I want you to look in 2 Chronicles chapter 17.

247
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,480
I want you to consider the dissemination of truth

248
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,559
in his life and the revival that took place

249
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:33,720
during his reign as king of Judah.

250
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,660
And we find that he strengthened himself,

251
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:40,040
we find that he sought the Lord, his God,

252
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,580
he walked in the commandments

253
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,920
and not after the doings of Israel.

254
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,080
In fact, the Bible tells us, it's an interesting statement

255
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,920
in verse number six of 2 Chronicles 17.

256
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,380
It says, and his heart was lifted up

257
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,680
in the ways of the Lord.

258
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,520
Isn't that good?

259
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,840
So often when you hear of someone's heart being lifted up,

260
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,920
you go to the place in which they're being prideful, right?

261
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,600
Their heart is lifted up.

262
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,600
But here the Bible tells us of Jehoshaphat

263
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,080
that his heart was lifted up in the ways of the Lord.

264
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,300
Moreover, he took away the high places

265
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,920
and groves out of Egypt.

266
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,800
Notice it says in verse number seven,

267
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,960
also in the third year of his reign,

268
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:23,000
he sent to his princes,

269
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,080
and it says to Ben-Hel and to Obadiah and to Zechariah

270
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,480
and to Nethaniel and to Micaiah.

271
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,040
Notice what he sent to them.

272
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,760
The end of verse number seven,

273
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:36,720
to teach in the cities of Judah.

274
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,800
Jehoshaphat had learned some things

275
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,980
and though he would not be capable of teaching

276
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,520
in all of these cities himself,

277
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,760
we find that he employed others

278
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,620
and he gave this solution to the problem

279
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,279
in which he was dealing with.

280
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:53,920
And he sent these folks out for the purpose of teaching

281
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,960
throughout the cities of Judah.

282
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,400
It tells us in verse number nine,

283
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,559
notice it says, and they taught in Judah

284
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:04,120
and had the book of the law of the Lord with them

285
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:07,320
and went about throughout all the cities of Judah

286
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,880
and taught the people.

287
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,400
Isn't it interesting when you consider

288
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:17,240
the approach of Jehoshaphat, the desire of Jehoshaphat,

289
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,800
he had learned some things,

290
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,680
he had applied some things in his life,

291
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,320
he desired to apply truth in his life,

292
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:26,680
and then he wanted to have truth given out.

293
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:30,040
He wanted for others to be taught the same truth.

294
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:34,960
And so he employs these princes to this task

295
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,760
and it tells us that they taught in Judah

296
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,440
the book that they were teaching

297
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,279
as the book of the law of the Lord, the word of God.

298
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:45,120
And notice the impact in verse number 10,

299
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,460
and the fear of the Lord fell upon all the kingdoms

300
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,000
of the lands that were around about Judah

301
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,360
so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat.

302
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,840
In fact, if you continue reading,

303
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,440
you'll find how the Philistines and others

304
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:03,400
brought gifts to Jehoshaphat and to Judah

305
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,360
because of that which had been taking place.

306
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,840
The dissemination of truth,

307
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,440
when we learn the truth of the word of God

308
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,440
and we apply, when we have that spirit of teach me Lord,

309
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,440
remember the psalmist said, I know that the Lord is great.

310
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,640
He had learned this truth.

311
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:26,240
And then he says this, I must declare his greatness

312
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,720
because what I've learned, I desire for others to know.

313
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,720
And how truthful when it comes to the content of this book,

314
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:39,000
how important when we understand the word of life,

315
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,119
the very word of God that has been given to us

316
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:45,520
and how we have had the privilege of learning

317
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,080
and being taught the word of God,

318
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,220
but it's not so that we could just be a sponge

319
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,919
and soak it all up,

320
00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:55,359
not so that we could become a dead sea kind of a mentality

321
00:18:55,359 --> 00:19:00,080
that we just constantly receive, but never give.

322
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,760
And as I receive truth and as I apply truth in my life,

323
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,960
I ought to desire this second purpose of learning

324
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,480
is the dissemination of truth.

325
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,640
I've learned these things so that I can apply them,

326
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,340
but so also that I might teach them

327
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,320
so that others would know.

328
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,460
Think about the apostle Paul with me,

329
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,640
probably the greatest example

330
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,580
aside from the Lord Jesus Christ in the New Testament

331
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,660
of living out this truth in Acts chapter number 20.

332
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:29,179
I want you to notice what he says to the Ephesian elders

333
00:19:29,179 --> 00:19:33,100
as he calls them together on his way to Jerusalem.

334
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:36,780
He's speaking to these church leaders

335
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,580
and he's giving them instruction.

336
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:41,640
And I want you to see what he says here

337
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,340
with regard to his teaching ministry.

338
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:48,340
Now he testifies, in fact, he speaks of this,

339
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,320
you don't need to turn there,

340
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,900
but in the book of Galatians in the first chapter,

341
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,460
he clearly teaches to these believers

342
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:58,980
in the region of Galatia that what he had learned,

343
00:19:58,980 --> 00:19:59,820
he had learned.

344
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,240
from the Lord Jesus Christ.

345
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,360
In verse number 12 of Galatians 1,

346
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,380
he says, for I neither received it of man,

347
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,800
neither was I taught it,

348
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,980
but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.

349
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:12,440
And what he, Paul, had learned,

350
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,980
he desired to teach others.

351
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,240
We find in verse number 20 of Acts 20,

352
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,680
the Bible says this,

353
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:24,680
and how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you,

354
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,620
but have showed you and have taught you publicly

355
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:31,220
and from house to house.

356
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,960
I want you to think about Paul saying this.

357
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,540
We're familiar with the verse of Scripture

358
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:37,060
in 2 Timothy 3, in verse number 16,

359
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,340
where the Bible says all Scripture

360
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,860
is given by inspiration of God.

361
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,200
What's the next phrase?

362
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,580
And is profitable, right?

363
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:49,580
It's what he says in 2 Timothy 3, in verse number 16,

364
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,180
for doctrine, for reproof, for correction,

365
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,460
for instruction in righteousness.

366
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,460
You see in verse 17 that the man of God

367
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:59,220
might be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.

368
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:02,140
And then in the next chapter, chapter four,

369
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:04,020
preach the word, so on and so forth.

370
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,340
But notice what he says,

371
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:10,180
and how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you.

372
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:14,020
Well, the word of God is profitable to people, amen?

373
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:16,860
And Paul had been taught by the Lord Jesus Christ,

374
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,340
by the revelation of Jesus Christ,

375
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:22,920
and he desired to teach others

376
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:27,000
to the point in which it caused him great physical harm.

377
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,720
Right?

378
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,000
Think about the lengths by which Paul went through

379
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,540
in order to teach the word of God.

380
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,960
To these very people in Philippi,

381
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,000
that he's, excuse me, in Ephesus,

382
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,880
that he's writing to these leaders of the church there,

383
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,600
that he's writing to in Ephesus.

384
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,400
And you think about some of the understanding

385
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,480
that they had with regard to his entry into their city,

386
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,000
but also the preceding journeys and all of the testimony

387
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,080
and how various accounts of difficulty

388
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,860
that he suffered and dealt with.

389
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,320
And he did all of that, why?

390
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:06,300
Because he wanted to get the word of God out.

391
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,600
Because he knew that it was profitable.

392
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:12,560
If it's helped me, then I want it to help somebody else.

393
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,720
If it's profitable for me, it's profitable for thee.

394
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,560
Amen?

395
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,800
And we find that Paul says, I've kept back nothing

396
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,160
that was profitable unto you,

397
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,480
but have showed you and have taught you publicly

398
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,520
and from house to house.

399
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,560
Notice in Philippians four and verse number nine,

400
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,280
we looked at this verse a moment ago

401
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,320
and focused on that word do

402
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,640
because of the first point of the application of truth.

403
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,840
When we think about the dissemination of truth,

404
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,840
we find in Philippians four and verse number nine,

405
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,080
Paul says those things,

406
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,080
now writing to the church in Philippi,

407
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,200
which ye have both learned and received

408
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,120
and heard and seen in me.

409
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,840
Paul was faithful to teach the word of God.

410
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,920
And then a verse of scripture

411
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,240
that we have used over the years.

412
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,320
In fact, before we painted the stairway downstairs,

413
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,320
the words of this verse of scripture

414
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,040
were after the first landing as you walk downstairs,

415
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,960
our Sunday school ministries take place down there.

416
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,240
And second Timothy two and verse number two

417
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,760
is an important verse of scripture.

418
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,840
It teaches us the importance of this truth

419
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,040
that we're dealing with this evening.

420
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,800
And Paul, of course, is writing to his son in the faith,

421
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,040
to Timothy.

422
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,200
But the principle is so important

423
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,280
here in second Timothy two and verse number two.

424
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,400
And Paul says this,

425
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,640
and the things that thou hast heard of me

426
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,040
among many witnesses,

427
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:38,560
the same commit thou to faithful men

428
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:42,280
who shall be able to teach others also.

429
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,760
Isn't that a good verse of scripture?

430
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,240
Paul's been taught.

431
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,160
Paul is teaching.

432
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,480
And Paul says, now you need to take

433
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,400
what you've learned of me

434
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,840
and you need to teach that same truth to others

435
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,600
who will then be able to teach others.

436
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,760
Wow.

437
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,560
Generational influence, generational impact.

438
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,400
The pattern that's been given to us

439
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:11,000
by the Lord Jesus Christ of the dissemination of truth

440
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,160
Paul had learned,

441
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,720
but it wasn't so that Paul could just sit over idle

442
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,800
by himself and say, look at all of these things

443
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,440
that I've been taught.

444
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,160
Look at all of this knowledge that I've accumulated.

445
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,440
Look at all of these facts that I can share.

446
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,800
No, rather he was seeking to make sure

447
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,119
that he could teach others

448
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:34,320
and that those that he taught, that he invested in

449
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,040
would understand the importance

450
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,080
of not only applying it in their lives,

451
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,160
but then teaching it to others.

452
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:46,240
As we think of these two purposes for learning this evening,

453
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,679
I want you to consider them in light of

454
00:24:48,679 --> 00:24:52,160
really two things in closing, two thoughts.

455
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,880
Number one is the testimony of Ezra.

456
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,480
Again, using an Old Testament

457
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,880
and a New Testament principle this evening.

458
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,520
And turn over to Ezra chapter number seven

459
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,440
quickly as we close this evening.

460
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,160
And I want you to consider

461
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,399
in light of what we've looked at this evening

462
00:25:07,399 --> 00:25:10,920
for these two purposes for learning,

463
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:14,960
the application of truth and the dissemination of truth,

464
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,080
I want you to think about what the Bible tells us

465
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:22,080
about the testimony of Ezra in Ezra chapter number seven.

466
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:25,080
In verse number 10, notice what the Bible says.

467
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:29,839
For Ezra had prepared his heart

468
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:32,600
to seek the law of the Lord.

469
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,760
Could I say this evening

470
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,920
that he was desiring to learn the word of God?

471
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,640
Would that be fair?

472
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,080
He's seeking the law of the Lord.

473
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:43,200
He's seeking to know the truth of God's word.

474
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,200
The word teach or learn or taught is not there,

475
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,800
but I believe that it's understood

476
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,000
as you see that the Bible says

477
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,200
that Ezra had prepared his heart

478
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,800
to seek the law of the Lord.

479
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:57,279
He desired to know the truth of God's word,

480
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:58,839
but then notice what it says,

481
00:25:58,839 --> 00:26:02,040
and to do it.

482
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,160
Why did Ezra prepare his heart

483
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,040
to seek the law of the Lord?

484
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,240
Well, our first purpose this evening,

485
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,839
the application of truth, to do it.

486
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:12,279
Ezra wanted to learn it

487
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:13,600
so that he could apply it.

488
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,360
Ezra wanted to learn the truth

489
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,080
so that he could do the truth,

490
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:20,920
so that he could have the blessing of God in his life.

491
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:24,720
But then notice the rest of the verse of Scripture,

492
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,800
and to teach.

493
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:32,559
To teach in Israel statutes and judgments,

494
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,600
the dissemination of truth.

495
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,399
Ezra says, I've prepared my heart

496
00:26:36,399 --> 00:26:37,920
to seek the law of the Lord

497
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,119
for these two purposes,

498
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:40,320
number one, to do it,

499
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,200
and number two, to teach it.

500
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,960
Notice the words of Jesus Christ

501
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,000
in Matthew 5.

502
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,399
In Matthew 5,

503
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:53,720
the beginning area of this Sermon on the Mount

504
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,839
that we looked at,

505
00:26:54,839 --> 00:26:56,440
and we looked at the last verse

506
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:00,679
of chapter 7 by our introduction this evening

507
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:02,040
and how He taught them

508
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,440
as one having authority

509
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,920
and not as the scribes.

510
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,000
But I want you to notice

511
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,600
what Jesus Christ says in Matthew 5

512
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,720
near the beginning of the Sermon on the Mount

513
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,800
in verse number 19.

514
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,119
And I'm going to just jump

515
00:27:14,119 --> 00:27:15,440
right in the middle of the verse here

516
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,399
and give the truth

517
00:27:17,399 --> 00:27:20,559
that we're seeking to convey this evening.

518
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,600
Notice in the beginning of verse number 19,

519
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,119
it says,

520
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:24,480
Whosoever therefore shall break

521
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,440
one of these least commandments

522
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,240
and shall teach men so,

523
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,320
he shall be called the least

524
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,559
in the kingdom of heaven.

525
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,640
That's not part of what we're dealing with this evening.

526
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,119
I want you to look after the colon there

527
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:36,640
and after the conjunction but.

528
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,880
Notice what He says,

529
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:45,480
But whosoever shall do and teach them,

530
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,800
the same shall be called great

531
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,800
in the kingdom of heaven.

532
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,000
What are two purposes for learning?

533
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,440
The application of truth to do it

534
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,839
and the dissemination of truth to teach it.

535
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:02,760
And as we enter into this

536
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:06,600
several month long study of Teach Me

537
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,559
and we adopt the heart cry of the psalmist

538
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,600
as our own heart cry.

539
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,440
And say, Lord, teach me.

540
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,160
I want to learn.

541
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:19,200
I have a sincere desire

542
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,119
to learn the Word of God.

543
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:25,440
And as I begin that journey,

544
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,480
as we begin that series,

545
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,440
I believe that it's of utmost importance

546
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,039
for us to understand and to identify

547
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:35,600
right now what are the purposes

548
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,400
in two of them,

549
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,320
to do the application

550
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:42,600
and to teach the dissemination.

551
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,799
And as we have those as our focal points,

552
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:48,520
if you will, as these two,

553
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,520
and again, it's not an exhaustive list.

554
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,919
There are many other purposes

555
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:54,239
that we could give for learning.

556
00:28:54,239 --> 00:28:57,239
We look at these two truths this evening

557
00:28:57,239 --> 00:28:59,799
and these would be our motives,

558
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:04,119
if you will, to know Him absolutely.

559
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,359
And as we learn the Word of God

560
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:10,479
and as we learn the mind of Christ

561
00:29:10,479 --> 00:29:12,400
for the purpose of applying and doing

562
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,679
and the purpose of teaching

563
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:15,400
that others would know.

564
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,880
I don't want to be that sponge.

565
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:21,960
A sponge absorbs everything in,

566
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,119
but you've got to get it out.

567
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:25,440
Right?

568
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,039
You don't want to become a Dead Sea Christian

569
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:32,600
where you're just constantly having an inflow,

570
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,400
and never anything leaving.

571
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,840
And this evening,

572
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,440
I want the Lord to teach me.

573
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,239
I hope that each of us would say,

574
00:29:41,239 --> 00:29:44,359
Lord, teach me.

575
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:48,280
And I purpose to do the Word of God,

576
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,679
to keep the Word of God.

577
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:51,919
And then, Lord, would You give me

578
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:54,799
opportunities to teach others

579
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,479
that I would be able to share with them

580
00:29:56,479 --> 00:30:01,479
knowing that just as it's profitable for me,

581
00:30:01,479 --> 00:30:04,639
it will be profitable for them.

582
00:30:04,639 --> 00:30:11,319
The truth of Ezra 7.10, perhaps a verse of Scripture that we would commit to memory,

583
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:18,039
that Ezra prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord, and to do it, and to teach in

584
00:30:18,039 --> 00:30:20,679
Israel statutes and judgments.

585
00:30:20,679 --> 00:30:23,319
Oh, that would be our heart cry.

586
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:24,319
Let's pray.

587
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:25,319
Father, we love You.

588
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:27,179
We thank You for loving us.

589
00:30:27,179 --> 00:30:30,279
We thank You that You've given us the Word of God.

590
00:30:30,279 --> 00:30:36,219
We thank You that the Holy Spirit that indwells us, that sealed us into the day of redemption,

591
00:30:36,219 --> 00:30:40,759
yes, is our comforter, but we thank You that He's our teacher.

592
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:46,719
And I pray that You would guide us into all truth, and I pray that as we learn Your Word,

593
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:55,799
as we take and echo the heart cry of the psalmist, teach me, that these two purposes for learning

594
00:30:55,799 --> 00:31:03,879
would be constantly at the forefront of our minds as we understand that we're being taught

595
00:31:03,879 --> 00:31:10,759
so that we would do, and we're being taught so that we might teach.

596
00:31:10,759 --> 00:31:12,439
I pray that You'd bless our time of prayer.

597
00:31:12,439 --> 00:31:15,559
We thank You for the privilege.

598
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:18,319
We pray that You'd be honored and glorified through the remainder of our service.

599
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:21,839
For it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.

600
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:23,359
Does anyone need a prayer bulletin tonight?

601
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:24,639
You did not get one when you came in.

602
00:31:24,639 --> 00:31:25,639
Anyone need one?

603
00:31:25,639 --> 00:31:25,639
