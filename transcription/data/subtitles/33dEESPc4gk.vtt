00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.719
Psalm 119 last week, as we started this brand new series that I've entitled, Teach Me.

00:00:06.719 --> 00:00:11.960
And the heart cry of the psalmist, you see it oft repeated through the book of Psalms

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:18.659
a number of times in the 119th Psalm, is this heart cry, teach me.

00:00:18.659 --> 00:00:24.120
And I believe that we find, as we even discussed last week, that this heart cry of the psalmist

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.639
reveals his sincere desire to learn.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.060
And as we express our desire to learn, I believe that it's important that we understand some

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.599
of the purposes of learning.

00:00:36.599 --> 00:00:42.599
And tonight, I just desire to really consider two purposes for learning.

00:00:42.599 --> 00:00:48.040
Admittedly, right at the beginning of this message tonight, obviously this is not intended

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.919
to be an exhaustive list of all of the purposes for learning.

00:00:52.919 --> 00:00:57.279
So if you are taking notes and want a title, I've simply titled the message this evening,

00:00:57.279 --> 00:01:00.439
Two Purposes for Learning.

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:05.400
I believe that the Lord Jesus Christ is the master teacher, and we find that in the book

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.400
of Matthew.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.919
In fact, if you read throughout the gospel accounts, you'll find many times in which

00:01:10.919 --> 00:01:16.160
the gospels make this record that Jesus taught them.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:22.440
And you can read of accounts in which the settings are provided for us, and Jesus is

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:28.639
teaching, he's at times teaching the disciples, at times he's teaching multitudes, at times

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:33.599
the religious leaders are there hearing the instruction, at times he's in the synagogue

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:34.599
teaching.

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:39.000
I mean, you just look through the gospels and you will find a number of accounts in

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.599
which Jesus is teaching.

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:47.360
And we find that here in Matthew chapter number 7, it's interesting, at the end of the passage,

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.879
really as we look at Matthew 5, 6, and 7, the Sermon on the Mountain, we find that at

00:01:51.879 --> 00:01:56.279
the conclusion in verse number 29, notice what the Word of God says,

00:01:56.279 --> 00:02:05.120
For he, speaking of Jesus, taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:11.039
And that's a great verse of Scripture in understanding the way that Jesus, as the master teacher,

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.240
he taught with authority.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:19.820
And you'll remember in John chapter number 3 and verse number 2, Jesus is there and Nicodemus

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.899
comes to Jesus by night, and he makes the statement,

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:27.820
We know that thou art a teacher sent from God.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.779
And it's interesting, as you would consider the teaching ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:02:32.779 --> 00:02:38.380
we know that his purpose for coming to the earth was not simply to teach, his purpose

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.380
for coming to the earth was to be our Savior, to die on the cross of Calvary, which he fulfilled

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:50.199
and finished, but while he was on earth, man, did he teach some wonderful truth.

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:53.820
And we find that it's interesting, for the Bible says here in our verse, our springboard

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.820
verse, For he taught them as one having authority, but I want you to turn over a few chapters

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:03.179
in the book of Matthew in the 11th chapter, and I want you to consider a phrase that really

00:03:03.179 --> 00:03:09.539
is an invitation here that is given, and there are several points within these verses of

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:14.240
Scripture you could preach an entire message, in fact, I have in the past from this portion

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.240
of Scripture.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.199
It's a familiar passage, but I want to note a statement in verse number 29, beginning

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:23.919
in verse 28 of Matthew 11, the Bible says, Come unto me, all you that labor and are heavy

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:27.460
laid in, and I will give you rest.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:33.039
Take my yoke upon you, notice this phrase, and learn of me.

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:38.119
For I am meek and lowly in heart, and you shall find rest unto your souls.

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:42.619
For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:47.179
There in verse number 29, it says, Learn of me, and learn of me.

00:03:47.179 --> 00:03:53.779
It said there in Matthew 7 that he taught as one that had authority, and he then offers

00:03:53.779 --> 00:03:59.100
this invitation to come unto him, and part of what they would do is they would learn

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.100
of him.

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:05.860
In fact, there are records in which the Scriptures give us where the disciples learned valuable

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:06.860
lessons.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.660
They learned from the teaching that Jesus gave them, and when we think about learning

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:17.959
and we think about the importance of identifying some of the purposes of learning, I mentioned

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:24.079
last week in our introductory message that the purpose of learning is not to just accumulate

00:04:24.079 --> 00:04:25.079
wealth.

00:04:25.079 --> 00:04:30.160
The idea is not a prideful motive, a look at what I know in comparison to what someone

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.000
else knows.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.359
And as we consider this subject matter, I believe that as we have pure, God-honoring

00:04:37.359 --> 00:04:44.000
motives that would fuel that desire of ours to learn, that I believe that the Lord Jesus

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.239
Christ will graciously teach us.

00:04:47.239 --> 00:04:52.320
It's interesting that during the earthly ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ, many accounts

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.480
are given where he's teaching, and he says that they should come and learn of him.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.339
And I mentioned this last week, but before we get into the points tonight, it's important

00:05:01.339 --> 00:05:05.779
for us to understand that the Holy Spirit of God is the divine teacher, and I'm thankful

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:10.660
that one of the ministries, he's the comforter, and how thankful I am for that.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:16.540
He convicts us, and it's wonderful to be convicted, but he teaches us.

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:20.700
And I'm thankful for that ministry of the Holy Spirit of God, and we have the complete

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:26.260
canon of God's Word, and he teaches us, and what a blessing that is.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:30.779
Two thoughts this evening I mentioned by the title, Two Purposes for Learning.

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:37.779
Number one, the application of truth, the application of truth, our purpose, one purpose

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:40.619
of learning is doing.

00:05:40.619 --> 00:05:43.220
Really doesn't make a whole lot of sense to learn something if we're not going to do it,

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.140
if we're not going to apply it.

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:50.859
And we're not just trying to accumulate this information, as I mentioned a moment ago.

00:05:50.859 --> 00:05:55.540
And I believe that the simplicity of this truth or this thought, the application of

00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:00.179
truth being the first of these two purposes that we'll look at this evening, the simplicity

00:06:00.179 --> 00:06:03.380
of this truth must not be overlooked.

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.899
As you think about the Christian life, and you think about the importance of growing

00:06:07.899 --> 00:06:13.579
and learning, we find that we learn these principles from the Word of God with the purpose

00:06:13.579 --> 00:06:18.380
of applying these principles in our lives, that as I study the Word of God, as I read

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:23.859
the Word of God, as I hear the Word of God taught and preached, that I'm anxiously desiring

00:06:23.859 --> 00:06:31.540
and seeking, excitedly desiring the Lord to show me how this truth applies in my life,

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:37.019
how I can take and apply the principles that we're learning from the Word of God.

00:06:37.019 --> 00:06:40.940
The reality is that I cannot do what I have not learned.

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:43.339
It's a pretty simple statement.

00:06:43.339 --> 00:06:45.420
I cannot do what I have not learned.

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:49.179
Has anyone ever asked you to do something that you don't have the knowledge of doing?

00:06:49.179 --> 00:06:53.059
Someone's asked you to do something and you simply can't fulfill the task.

00:06:53.059 --> 00:06:54.059
Why?

00:06:54.059 --> 00:06:57.059
Because you don't know how to do it.

00:06:57.059 --> 00:07:01.059
But the reality is that I must, biblically speaking, we're speaking about the spiritual

00:07:01.059 --> 00:07:06.339
aspect of teach me, I must do that which I have learned.

00:07:06.339 --> 00:07:12.059
God holds us accountable for those truths that He reveals to us and the truth that He

00:07:12.059 --> 00:07:14.779
teaches us, and we are to be doers of the Word.

00:07:14.779 --> 00:07:19.179
Turn to the book of Deuteronomy, if you will, to the fourth chapter, and I'm just going

00:07:19.179 --> 00:07:22.579
to look at a few verses here in the book of Deuteronomy, and then we'll look at a couple

00:07:22.579 --> 00:07:25.179
of New Testament truths as well.

00:07:25.179 --> 00:07:29.579
But look in Deuteronomy chapter number four in verse number five, and notice what Moses

00:07:29.579 --> 00:07:34.660
says to the children of Israel with regard to the teaching of the Word of God.

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:39.500
In fact, he begins in verse number one of Deuteronomy four, now therefore hearken, O

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:43.140
Israel, unto the statutes and unto the judgments which I teach you.

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:47.700
Notice this next phrase, for to do them that you may live and go in and possess the land

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:50.220
which the Lord God of your fathers giveth you.

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:55.619
Notice verse number five, behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as

00:07:55.619 --> 00:07:58.100
the Lord my God commanded me.

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:04.700
The next phrase, that ye should do so in the land whither you go to possess it.

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:11.459
Keep therefore and do them, notice this, for this is your wisdom and your understanding

00:08:11.459 --> 00:08:16.700
in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these statutes and say, surely this great

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:21.179
nation is a wise and understanding people.

00:08:21.179 --> 00:08:25.459
It's interesting as we know and go through this initial point, I'll make some comments

00:08:25.459 --> 00:08:30.299
at the end with regard to knowledge versus wisdom, but you see here in verse number six

00:08:30.299 --> 00:08:35.859
when he says, keep therefore and do them, for this is your wisdom and your understanding

00:08:35.859 --> 00:08:37.820
in the sight of the nations.

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:41.700
As we think about these verses of Scripture and the importance of them and the fact that

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:47.299
he's saying, I have taught you, but the purpose of teaching you, the purpose of giving you

00:08:47.299 --> 00:08:50.159
is to do them, to apply them.

00:08:50.159 --> 00:08:56.840
Chapter five in verse number one, the Bible says here, and Moses called all Israel and

00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:03.299
said unto them, hear, O Israel, the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this

00:09:03.299 --> 00:09:04.299
day.

00:09:04.299 --> 00:09:07.859
So hear them for what purpose, that ye may learn them.

00:09:07.859 --> 00:09:12.919
Remember when the psalmist said, teach me, we say that that reveals a sincere desire

00:09:12.919 --> 00:09:19.859
to learn, that we may learn them and keep and do them.

00:09:19.859 --> 00:09:25.739
In chapter 17 in verse number 19 of the book of Deuteronomy, it's so often repeated I could

00:09:25.739 --> 00:09:30.659
look at a whole host of verses throughout the entirety of the book of Deuteronomy.

00:09:30.659 --> 00:09:36.340
It's repeated over and over, but look at this one as our final one this evening.

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:40.940
In Deuteronomy 17 in verse number 19, the Bible says, and it shall be with him and he

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:46.219
shall read therein all the days of his life that he may learn to fear the Lord his God,

00:09:46.219 --> 00:09:50.580
to keep all the words of this law and these statutes, to do them.

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:56.260
Contextually here in this passage of Scripture, it's with regard to the kings and the importance

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.700
of when God would place a king over his people.

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:02.460
that they would take, it says in verse number 18,

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:04.380
and it shall be when he sitteth upon the throne

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:08.100
of his kingdom, that he shall write him a copy of this law

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:10.300
and a book out of that which is before the priests,

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:11.340
the Levites.

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:15.980
Now think about that, the king writing the law of the Lord.

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:19.140
I've never written all of the Pentateuch

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:20.780
in some kind of notebook paper

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:22.540
and you probably haven't either.

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:24.500
I know that there are accounts of those

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:26.300
where Bibles are not readily available,

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:28.940
where they do write out word for word

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:31.620
the scriptures because they have one Bible

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:33.420
amongst a group of believers

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:35.300
and the only way for them to have any portion

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:37.980
of the scriptures if they write it out themselves.

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:40.380
But I will say this, when you write out the scripture,

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:42.580
it helps us to remember it, doesn't it?

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:45.220
And as we remember it, we're mindful of it,

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:47.900
it goes a long distance in helping us

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:49.900
to perform it or to do it.

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:53.960
It doesn't immediately mean that we will do it

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.620
just because we've written it,

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:58.420
but the reality is that he tells them the purpose

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:00.180
at the end of verse number 19,

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:02.100
that they would have these words of the law

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:05.100
and these statutes, but to do them,

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:07.700
the purpose of the application of truth.

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:10.180
We're familiar with James 1 in verse number 22,

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:13.860
we use the verse of scripture often and rightly so,

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:18.100
that we are to be doers of the word and not hearers only.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.900
How often in my life, perhaps if you'd evaluate your life,

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:26.340
have we been guilty of not applying truth,

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:29.180
not applying that which we've been taught?

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:31.900
Philippians chapter number four in verse number nine,

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:34.540
we'll look at this verse a couple of times this evening.

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:36.940
I want you to just look at a single word in this verse,

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:38.460
I'll read the entirety of it,

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:40.820
but in Philippians chapter number four in verse number nine,

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:43.220
Paul is writing to these believers

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:45.340
and he's concluding this letter.

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:47.180
And notice what he says in verse number nine

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:48.740
of Philippians four,

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:51.180
those things which ye have both learned,

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:53.580
I'll give you a second,

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:56.620
those things that ye have both learned

00:11:56.620 --> 00:12:00.100
and received and heard and seen in me,

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:01.940
what's that next word?

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:02.780
Do.

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:07.860
Paul said I've taught, I've instructed, I've given,

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:11.860
I have fulfilled my responsibility in teaching

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:14.820
and I've lived out that which I'm teaching.

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:16.820
He said that not only the things that you learned

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:18.060
and received and heard,

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:21.780
but he says the things that you've seen in me, do.

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:23.820
The God of peace shall be with you.

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:28.380
So we find this evening that one of the purposes

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:31.300
for learning is the application of truth.

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:34.820
I learned the principles of the word of God

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:36.700
so that I can apply them in my life,

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:38.460
so that I can do them.

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:41.940
We think about the difference between knowledge and wisdom.

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:46.940
Knowledge would really be the idea of information learned,

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:48.900
having facts, if you will,

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:53.220
the accumulation of truth, of facts, of principles.

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:56.940
But wisdom is the application

00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:59.540
of that information that has been learned.

00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:01.980
So I have all of these truths,

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:03.420
I have all of these principles,

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:06.220
I have all of these precepts that I've learned,

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:08.900
these facts, and that's knowledge.

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:11.380
But the appropriate application

00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:14.260
of that information is wisdom.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.620
We're to walk in wisdom.

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:21.020
Someone said this, that knowledge is knowing what to say.

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:24.780
Wisdom is knowing when to say it.

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:31.300
Knowing what to say versus knowing when to say it.

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:34.460
Let me illustrate it this way.

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:38.300
Knowledge, and this is an original with me,

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:41.860
I heard it years ago, but it is quite comical.

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:44.780
Knowledge is knowing that a tomato is a fruit.

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:50.700
Wisdom is not putting tomatoes in fruit salad

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:55.140
or in a fruit smoothie, right?

00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:57.220
You say, oh, that's kind of,

00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:59.180
it just helps us kind of see the difference

00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:01.540
between the knowledge and the wisdom.

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:03.660
And we think about the application of truth,

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:06.140
that's wisdom, that's walking in wisdom.

00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:08.940
Yes, we're to have knowledge, we're to get knowledge,

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:11.220
we're to get understanding,

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:13.900
and we understand the Word of God teaches that,

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:16.779
but the purpose of getting the knowledge,

00:14:16.779 --> 00:14:19.420
the purpose of learning the precepts,

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:22.420
the purpose of crying out to the Lord, teach me,

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:25.940
the purpose of Jesus teaching during His earthly ministry,

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:29.340
the purpose of Jesus inviting them to come learn of Him

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:32.620
is so that we would apply the truth.

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:34.940
Not just so that we could have head knowledge,

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:37.160
not so that we could answer some questionnaires,

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:41.620
not so that we could do well on some Bible trivia game,

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:45.779
but so that we can apply the truth in our lives.

00:14:45.779 --> 00:14:49.559
The application of truth is the first of the two reasons

00:14:49.559 --> 00:14:52.260
or purposes for learning that we look at this evening.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.260
The second is the dissemination of truth.

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:59.600
The reality is that I learn that I might teach others.

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:03.760
I learn that I might teach others.

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:05.779
We see this throughout the Word of God,

00:15:05.779 --> 00:15:07.900
we see this illustrated in the lives

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:09.660
of many of God's servants.

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:11.559
I'll use two examples this evening.

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:14.559
One from the Old and one from the New Testament.

00:15:14.559 --> 00:15:16.960
Look in the book of 2 Chronicles, if you will,

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:21.240
and look at Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, Jehoshaphat.

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:24.240
I want you to look in 2 Chronicles chapter 17.

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:27.480
I want you to consider the dissemination of truth

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:30.559
in his life and the revival that took place

00:15:30.559 --> 00:15:33.720
during his reign as king of Judah.

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:36.660
And we find that he strengthened himself,

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:40.040
we find that he sought the Lord, his God,

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:41.580
he walked in the commandments

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:43.920
and not after the doings of Israel.

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:47.080
In fact, the Bible tells us, it's an interesting statement

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:49.920
in verse number six of 2 Chronicles 17.

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:53.380
It says, and his heart was lifted up

00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:55.680
in the ways of the Lord.

00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:57.520
Isn't that good?

00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:00.840
So often when you hear of someone's heart being lifted up,

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:03.920
you go to the place in which they're being prideful, right?

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:05.600
Their heart is lifted up.

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:08.600
But here the Bible tells us of Jehoshaphat

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:12.080
that his heart was lifted up in the ways of the Lord.

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:14.300
Moreover, he took away the high places

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:15.920
and groves out of Egypt.

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:17.800
Notice it says in verse number seven,

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:19.960
also in the third year of his reign,

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:23.000
he sent to his princes,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.080
and it says to Ben-Hel and to Obadiah and to Zechariah

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:29.480
and to Nethaniel and to Micaiah.

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:31.040
Notice what he sent to them.

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:32.760
The end of verse number seven,

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:36.720
to teach in the cities of Judah.

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:38.800
Jehoshaphat had learned some things

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:41.980
and though he would not be capable of teaching

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:43.520
in all of these cities himself,

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:45.760
we find that he employed others

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:48.620
and he gave this solution to the problem

00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:50.279
in which he was dealing with.

00:16:50.279 --> 00:16:53.920
And he sent these folks out for the purpose of teaching

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:55.960
throughout the cities of Judah.

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:57.400
It tells us in verse number nine,

00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:00.559
notice it says, and they taught in Judah

00:17:00.559 --> 00:17:04.120
and had the book of the law of the Lord with them

00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:07.320
and went about throughout all the cities of Judah

00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:09.880
and taught the people.

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:12.400
Isn't it interesting when you consider

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:17.240
the approach of Jehoshaphat, the desire of Jehoshaphat,

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:18.800
he had learned some things,

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:20.680
he had applied some things in his life,

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:23.320
he desired to apply truth in his life,

00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:26.680
and then he wanted to have truth given out.

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:30.040
He wanted for others to be taught the same truth.

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:34.960
And so he employs these princes to this task

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:37.760
and it tells us that they taught in Judah

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:39.440
the book that they were teaching

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:42.279
as the book of the law of the Lord, the word of God.

00:17:42.279 --> 00:17:45.120
And notice the impact in verse number 10,

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:48.460
and the fear of the Lord fell upon all the kingdoms

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:51.000
of the lands that were around about Judah

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.360
so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat.

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:55.840
In fact, if you continue reading,

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:58.440
you'll find how the Philistines and others

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:03.400
brought gifts to Jehoshaphat and to Judah

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:06.360
because of that which had been taking place.

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:07.840
The dissemination of truth,

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:11.440
when we learn the truth of the word of God

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:15.440
and we apply, when we have that spirit of teach me Lord,

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:18.440
remember the psalmist said, I know that the Lord is great.

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:20.640
He had learned this truth.

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:26.240
And then he says this, I must declare his greatness

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:30.720
because what I've learned, I desire for others to know.

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:35.720
And how truthful when it comes to the content of this book,

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:39.000
how important when we understand the word of life,

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.119
the very word of God that has been given to us

00:18:42.119 --> 00:18:45.520
and how we have had the privilege of learning

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:47.080
and being taught the word of God,

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:49.220
but it's not so that we could just be a sponge

00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:50.919
and soak it all up,

00:18:50.919 --> 00:18:55.359
not so that we could become a dead sea kind of a mentality

00:18:55.359 --> 00:19:00.080
that we just constantly receive, but never give.

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:03.760
And as I receive truth and as I apply truth in my life,

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:06.960
I ought to desire this second purpose of learning

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:08.480
is the dissemination of truth.

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:11.640
I've learned these things so that I can apply them,

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:14.340
but so also that I might teach them

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:16.320
so that others would know.

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:18.460
Think about the apostle Paul with me,

00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:20.640
probably the greatest example

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:23.580
aside from the Lord Jesus Christ in the New Testament

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:26.660
of living out this truth in Acts chapter number 20.

00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:29.179
I want you to notice what he says to the Ephesian elders

00:19:29.179 --> 00:19:33.100
as he calls them together on his way to Jerusalem.

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:36.780
He's speaking to these church leaders

00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:38.580
and he's giving them instruction.

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:41.640
And I want you to see what he says here

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:44.340
with regard to his teaching ministry.

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:48.340
Now he testifies, in fact, he speaks of this,

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:49.320
you don't need to turn there,

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:51.900
but in the book of Galatians in the first chapter,

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:54.460
he clearly teaches to these believers

00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:58.980
in the region of Galatia that what he had learned,

00:19:58.980 --> 00:19:59.820
he had learned.

00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:01.240
from the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:03.360
In verse number 12 of Galatians 1,

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:05.380
he says, for I neither received it of man,

00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:06.800
neither was I taught it,

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:09.980
but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:12.440
And what he, Paul, had learned,

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:14.980
he desired to teach others.

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:17.240
We find in verse number 20 of Acts 20,

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:19.680
the Bible says this,

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:24.680
and how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you,

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:28.620
but have showed you and have taught you publicly

00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:31.220
and from house to house.

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:32.960
I want you to think about Paul saying this.

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:34.540
We're familiar with the verse of Scripture

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:37.060
in 2 Timothy 3, in verse number 16,

00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:38.340
where the Bible says all Scripture

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:40.860
is given by inspiration of God.

00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:42.200
What's the next phrase?

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:46.580
And is profitable, right?

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:49.580
It's what he says in 2 Timothy 3, in verse number 16,

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:51.180
for doctrine, for reproof, for correction,

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:53.460
for instruction in righteousness.

00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:55.460
You see in verse 17 that the man of God

00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:59.220
might be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.

00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:02.140
And then in the next chapter, chapter four,

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:04.020
preach the word, so on and so forth.

00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:05.340
But notice what he says,

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:10.180
and how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you.

00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:14.020
Well, the word of God is profitable to people, amen?

00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:16.860
And Paul had been taught by the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:19.340
by the revelation of Jesus Christ,

00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:22.920
and he desired to teach others

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:27.000
to the point in which it caused him great physical harm.

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:28.720
Right?

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:32.000
Think about the lengths by which Paul went through

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.540
in order to teach the word of God.

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:38.960
To these very people in Philippi,

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:41.000
that he's, excuse me, in Ephesus,

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.880
that he's writing to these leaders of the church there,

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:46.600
that he's writing to in Ephesus.

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:49.400
And you think about some of the understanding

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:52.480
that they had with regard to his entry into their city,

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:56.000
but also the preceding journeys and all of the testimony

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.080
and how various accounts of difficulty

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:01.860
that he suffered and dealt with.

00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:03.320
And he did all of that, why?

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:06.300
Because he wanted to get the word of God out.

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:08.600
Because he knew that it was profitable.

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:12.560
If it's helped me, then I want it to help somebody else.

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:15.720
If it's profitable for me, it's profitable for thee.

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:16.560
Amen?

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:19.800
And we find that Paul says, I've kept back nothing

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:21.160
that was profitable unto you,

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:23.480
but have showed you and have taught you publicly

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:26.520
and from house to house.

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:28.560
Notice in Philippians four and verse number nine,

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:30.280
we looked at this verse a moment ago

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:32.320
and focused on that word do

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:35.640
because of the first point of the application of truth.

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:37.840
When we think about the dissemination of truth,

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:39.840
we find in Philippians four and verse number nine,

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:41.080
Paul says those things,

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:43.080
now writing to the church in Philippi,

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:45.200
which ye have both learned and received

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:47.120
and heard and seen in me.

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:49.840
Paul was faithful to teach the word of God.

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:53.920
And then a verse of scripture

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:56.240
that we have used over the years.

00:22:56.240 --> 00:23:00.320
In fact, before we painted the stairway downstairs,

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:02.320
the words of this verse of scripture

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:05.040
were after the first landing as you walk downstairs,

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:07.960
our Sunday school ministries take place down there.

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:10.240
And second Timothy two and verse number two

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:12.760
is an important verse of scripture.

00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:15.840
It teaches us the importance of this truth

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:18.040
that we're dealing with this evening.

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:20.800
And Paul, of course, is writing to his son in the faith,

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:22.040
to Timothy.

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:24.200
But the principle is so important

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:27.280
here in second Timothy two and verse number two.

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:28.400
And Paul says this,

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:31.640
and the things that thou hast heard of me

00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:34.040
among many witnesses,

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:38.560
the same commit thou to faithful men

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:42.280
who shall be able to teach others also.

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:44.760
Isn't that a good verse of scripture?

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:46.240
Paul's been taught.

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:49.160
Paul is teaching.

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:52.480
And Paul says, now you need to take

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:54.400
what you've learned of me

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:57.840
and you need to teach that same truth to others

00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:00.600
who will then be able to teach others.

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:01.760
Wow.

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:05.560
Generational influence, generational impact.

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:07.400
The pattern that's been given to us

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:11.000
by the Lord Jesus Christ of the dissemination of truth

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.160
Paul had learned,

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:15.720
but it wasn't so that Paul could just sit over idle

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:17.800
by himself and say, look at all of these things

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:19.440
that I've been taught.

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:22.160
Look at all of this knowledge that I've accumulated.

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:25.440
Look at all of these facts that I can share.

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:29.800
No, rather he was seeking to make sure

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:31.119
that he could teach others

00:24:31.119 --> 00:24:34.320
and that those that he taught, that he invested in

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:37.040
would understand the importance

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:39.080
of not only applying it in their lives,

00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:41.160
but then teaching it to others.

00:24:42.559 --> 00:24:46.240
As we think of these two purposes for learning this evening,

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:48.679
I want you to consider them in light of

00:24:48.679 --> 00:24:52.160
really two things in closing, two thoughts.

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:54.880
Number one is the testimony of Ezra.

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:56.480
Again, using an Old Testament

00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:58.880
and a New Testament principle this evening.

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:01.520
And turn over to Ezra chapter number seven

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:03.440
quickly as we close this evening.

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:05.160
And I want you to consider

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:07.399
in light of what we've looked at this evening

00:25:07.399 --> 00:25:10.920
for these two purposes for learning,

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:14.960
the application of truth and the dissemination of truth,

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:17.080
I want you to think about what the Bible tells us

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:22.080
about the testimony of Ezra in Ezra chapter number seven.

00:25:22.119 --> 00:25:25.080
In verse number 10, notice what the Bible says.

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:29.839
For Ezra had prepared his heart

00:25:29.839 --> 00:25:32.600
to seek the law of the Lord.

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:33.760
Could I say this evening

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:35.920
that he was desiring to learn the word of God?

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:37.640
Would that be fair?

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:39.080
He's seeking the law of the Lord.

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:43.200
He's seeking to know the truth of God's word.

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:46.200
The word teach or learn or taught is not there,

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:47.800
but I believe that it's understood

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:49.000
as you see that the Bible says

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.200
that Ezra had prepared his heart

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:53.800
to seek the law of the Lord.

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:57.279
He desired to know the truth of God's word,

00:25:57.279 --> 00:25:58.839
but then notice what it says,

00:25:58.839 --> 00:26:02.040
and to do it.

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:04.160
Why did Ezra prepare his heart

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:06.040
to seek the law of the Lord?

00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:08.240
Well, our first purpose this evening,

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:10.839
the application of truth, to do it.

00:26:10.839 --> 00:26:12.279
Ezra wanted to learn it

00:26:12.279 --> 00:26:13.600
so that he could apply it.

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:15.360
Ezra wanted to learn the truth

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:17.080
so that he could do the truth,

00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:20.920
so that he could have the blessing of God in his life.

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:24.720
But then notice the rest of the verse of Scripture,

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:27.800
and to teach.

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:32.559
To teach in Israel statutes and judgments,

00:26:32.559 --> 00:26:34.600
the dissemination of truth.

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:36.399
Ezra says, I've prepared my heart

00:26:36.399 --> 00:26:37.920
to seek the law of the Lord

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:39.119
for these two purposes,

00:26:39.119 --> 00:26:40.320
number one, to do it,

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:43.200
and number two, to teach it.

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:44.960
Notice the words of Jesus Christ

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:48.000
in Matthew 5.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.399
In Matthew 5,

00:26:49.399 --> 00:26:53.720
the beginning area of this Sermon on the Mount

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:54.839
that we looked at,

00:26:54.839 --> 00:26:56.440
and we looked at the last verse

00:26:56.440 --> 00:27:00.679
of chapter 7 by our introduction this evening

00:27:00.679 --> 00:27:02.040
and how He taught them

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:03.440
as one having authority

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:04.920
and not as the scribes.

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:06.000
But I want you to notice

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.600
what Jesus Christ says in Matthew 5

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:10.720
near the beginning of the Sermon on the Mount

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:12.800
in verse number 19.

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:14.119
And I'm going to just jump

00:27:14.119 --> 00:27:15.440
right in the middle of the verse here

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:17.399
and give the truth

00:27:17.399 --> 00:27:20.559
that we're seeking to convey this evening.

00:27:20.559 --> 00:27:22.600
Notice in the beginning of verse number 19,

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:23.119
it says,

00:27:23.119 --> 00:27:24.480
Whosoever therefore shall break

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:26.440
one of these least commandments

00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:28.240
and shall teach men so,

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:29.320
he shall be called the least

00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:30.559
in the kingdom of heaven.

00:27:30.559 --> 00:27:32.640
That's not part of what we're dealing with this evening.

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:35.119
I want you to look after the colon there

00:27:35.119 --> 00:27:36.640
and after the conjunction but.

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:37.880
Notice what He says,

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:45.480
But whosoever shall do and teach them,

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:47.800
the same shall be called great

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:50.800
in the kingdom of heaven.

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:53.000
What are two purposes for learning?

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.440
The application of truth to do it

00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:59.839
and the dissemination of truth to teach it.

00:27:59.839 --> 00:28:02.760
And as we enter into this

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:06.600
several month long study of Teach Me

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:10.559
and we adopt the heart cry of the psalmist

00:28:10.559 --> 00:28:12.600
as our own heart cry.

00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:14.440
And say, Lord, teach me.

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:16.160
I want to learn.

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:19.200
I have a sincere desire

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:23.119
to learn the Word of God.

00:28:23.119 --> 00:28:25.440
And as I begin that journey,

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:27.480
as we begin that series,

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:29.440
I believe that it's of utmost importance

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:33.039
for us to understand and to identify

00:28:33.039 --> 00:28:35.600
right now what are the purposes

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:37.400
in two of them,

00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:39.320
to do the application

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:42.600
and to teach the dissemination.

00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:45.799
And as we have those as our focal points,

00:28:45.799 --> 00:28:48.520
if you will, as these two,

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:50.520
and again, it's not an exhaustive list.

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:51.919
There are many other purposes

00:28:51.919 --> 00:28:54.239
that we could give for learning.

00:28:54.239 --> 00:28:57.239
We look at these two truths this evening

00:28:57.239 --> 00:28:59.799
and these would be our motives,

00:28:59.799 --> 00:29:04.119
if you will, to know Him absolutely.

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:06.359
And as we learn the Word of God

00:29:06.359 --> 00:29:10.479
and as we learn the mind of Christ

00:29:10.479 --> 00:29:12.400
for the purpose of applying and doing

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:13.679
and the purpose of teaching

00:29:13.679 --> 00:29:15.400
that others would know.

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:17.880
I don't want to be that sponge.

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:21.960
A sponge absorbs everything in,

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:24.119
but you've got to get it out.

00:29:24.119 --> 00:29:25.440
Right?

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:29.039
You don't want to become a Dead Sea Christian

00:29:29.039 --> 00:29:32.600
where you're just constantly having an inflow,

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:35.400
and never anything leaving.

00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:36.840
And this evening,

00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:39.440
I want the Lord to teach me.

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:41.239
I hope that each of us would say,

00:29:41.239 --> 00:29:44.359
Lord, teach me.

00:29:44.359 --> 00:29:48.280
And I purpose to do the Word of God,

00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:50.679
to keep the Word of God.

00:29:50.679 --> 00:29:51.919
And then, Lord, would You give me

00:29:51.919 --> 00:29:54.799
opportunities to teach others

00:29:54.799 --> 00:29:56.479
that I would be able to share with them

00:29:56.479 --> 00:30:01.479
knowing that just as it's profitable for me,

00:30:01.479 --> 00:30:04.639
it will be profitable for them.

00:30:04.639 --> 00:30:11.319
The truth of Ezra 7.10, perhaps a verse of Scripture that we would commit to memory,

00:30:11.319 --> 00:30:18.039
that Ezra prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord, and to do it, and to teach in

00:30:18.039 --> 00:30:20.679
Israel statutes and judgments.

00:30:20.679 --> 00:30:23.319
Oh, that would be our heart cry.

00:30:23.319 --> 00:30:24.319
Let's pray.

00:30:24.319 --> 00:30:25.319
Father, we love You.

00:30:25.319 --> 00:30:27.179
We thank You for loving us.

00:30:27.179 --> 00:30:30.279
We thank You that You've given us the Word of God.

00:30:30.279 --> 00:30:36.219
We thank You that the Holy Spirit that indwells us, that sealed us into the day of redemption,

00:30:36.219 --> 00:30:40.759
yes, is our comforter, but we thank You that He's our teacher.

00:30:40.759 --> 00:30:46.719
And I pray that You would guide us into all truth, and I pray that as we learn Your Word,

00:30:46.719 --> 00:30:55.799
as we take and echo the heart cry of the psalmist, teach me, that these two purposes for learning

00:30:55.799 --> 00:31:03.879
would be constantly at the forefront of our minds as we understand that we're being taught

00:31:03.879 --> 00:31:10.759
so that we would do, and we're being taught so that we might teach.

00:31:10.759 --> 00:31:12.439
I pray that You'd bless our time of prayer.

00:31:12.439 --> 00:31:15.559
We thank You for the privilege.

00:31:15.559 --> 00:31:18.319
We pray that You'd be honored and glorified through the remainder of our service.

00:31:18.319 --> 00:31:21.839
For it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.

00:31:21.839 --> 00:31:23.359
Does anyone need a prayer bulletin tonight?

00:31:23.359 --> 00:31:24.639
You did not get one when you came in.

00:31:24.639 --> 00:31:25.639
Anyone need one?

00:31:25.639 --> 00:31:25.639
