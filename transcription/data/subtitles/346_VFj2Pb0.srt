1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,519
5, and I want you to remember we're studying through the first and second letters that

2
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:06,920
Paul writes to Timothy.

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:09,560
We're entering into the fifth chapter here this morning.

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:14,500
Our theme, of course, for this calendar year is continue, as we see the charge that's given

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,719
throughout both of these letters.

6
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:22,760
To continue in the face of adversity and difficulty, the admonition, the charge is continue.

7
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:27,000
And we find that as we look at this letter, this epistle, it provides not only a charge

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,080
to Timothy, but we find that there's much within this particular letter that is given

9
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:39,400
as instruction for how God's people are to behave in God's church.

10
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,159
And we spent much time in the third chapter, really the end of the second chapter and through

11
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:47,119
the third chapter, dealing with behavior in God's church.

12
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:51,700
We had two messages with that title, part one and part two.

13
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:58,060
And we find that as we understand the truth that God has given, we find that God is the

14
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,779
one that is the head of the church.

15
00:00:59,779 --> 00:01:01,340
He instituted the church.

16
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,540
The church is God's idea.

17
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:07,580
But we find that he gives instruction for behavior in his church.

18
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:13,459
There is behavior that pleases God, and there is, that behavior is appropriate.

19
00:01:13,459 --> 00:01:17,139
We find there is inappropriate behavior that does not please the Lord.

20
00:01:17,139 --> 00:01:19,900
It does not bring honor and glory to God.

21
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:24,900
We find that Jesus said this in John chapter number four, God is a spirit, and they that

22
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,680
worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.

23
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,059
We find this morning as we, of course, last week looked at the fourth chapter of the book

24
00:01:34,059 --> 00:01:40,339
of 1 Timothy, there was an emphasis, an obvious emphasis that was placed upon sound teaching

25
00:01:40,339 --> 00:01:42,260
versus false teaching.

26
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:45,339
Timothy had the responsibility to teach truth.

27
00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:52,559
The individual believer must recognize what they should receive and what they should refuse.

28
00:01:52,559 --> 00:01:57,940
We asked the question, the title of the message last week was really a question, how is your

29
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:58,940
diet?

30
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:05,059
We're speaking spiritually about our diet and making sure that we are receiving those

31
00:02:05,059 --> 00:02:10,179
things that we ought to receive and refusing or rejecting those things that we ought not

32
00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:11,179
receive.

33
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,660
And so we looked at that last week in 1 Timothy chapter number four.

34
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:19,139
As we enter into the fifth chapter, we find that Paul begins to provide instruction with

35
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:22,259
regard to relationships within the church.

36
00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:27,179
You find that we, obviously as a church, we're a church family, and there are relationships

37
00:02:27,179 --> 00:02:33,500
that we have in the church, and so Timothy is instructed on how he is to interact with

38
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:40,520
those that are making up the church, the members of the church, and his behavior and interactions

39
00:02:40,559 --> 00:02:45,320
with church family would be an example to the rest of the body.

40
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,899
The pastor is to set forth the pattern.

41
00:02:48,899 --> 00:02:53,279
We find in this chapter in 1 Timothy 5 that God, the first 16 verses we're going to look

42
00:02:53,279 --> 00:02:58,320
at this morning, God deals with relationships in the church.

43
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:02,240
In verses one and two, notice the Bible says, rebuke not an elder, but entreat him as a

44
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:07,300
father and the younger men as brethren, the elder women as mothers, the younger as sisters

45
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,039
with all purity.

46
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:12,960
Verse three, honor widows that are widows indeed.

47
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,119
We'll skip down and look at verse 16, and we'll get into the message this morning.

48
00:03:16,119 --> 00:03:23,520
The Bible says, if any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them relieve them, and let

49
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:31,199
not the church be charged that it may relieve them that are widows indeed.

50
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:35,139
So as we come to this fifth chapter, look at 1 Timothy, we find that God provides this

51
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:39,259
instruction with regard to relationships within the church.

52
00:03:39,259 --> 00:03:45,580
By the way, God is an eternal God that understands all things, he has all wisdom and all knowledge,

53
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:51,000
and we find that he's given us a book, the Bible, the mind of Christ, and he's given

54
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,380
us the instruction that we need to follow.

55
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:58,820
It's very interesting as you come to 1 Timothy chapter number five that there are two verses

56
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:04,820
that are given really with regard to the members of the church as a whole, the senior saints

57
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:09,020
and the younger folks, and you pick which category you're in, but we find that there's

58
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:15,020
a two verses given to that, and then from verse three down through verse number 16,

59
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:19,940
God deals with the subject matter of widows, and we find that he provides a great deal

60
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:24,380
of instruction, obviously, and we'll deal with this as we go through it.

61
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:29,420
There was a number of widows that would be there in the church at Ephesus, and they needed

62
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:32,959
instruction on how to handle this.

63
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:40,000
It's also interesting to note that in Acts chapter number six, there's a contention that

64
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:47,000
arises within the church at Jerusalem, and that contention is really with regard to how

65
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,920
the widows were being cared for.

66
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:55,200
It's very interesting as you begin to couple this passage with that truth in Acts chapter

67
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:00,720
number six and understanding the attack of the enemy that is laid forth in the book of

68
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:08,160
Acts and how that the enemy seeks to attack from without, and that persecution, the religious

69
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,720
leaders, they, you cannot speak in the name of Jesus, and so on and so forth, we're going

70
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,799
to beat you, we're going to imprison you, and we're going to try to stop you, and that

71
00:05:17,799 --> 00:05:19,480
wasn't very successful.

72
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:24,600
And so then we find that the enemy would bring some division within in Acts chapter number

73
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,600
six.

74
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,799
I'm thankful for the leaders of the church in Jerusalem and the wisdom that God gave

75
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:34,279
them for handling that situation, but we find that as we come to First Timothy chapter number

76
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:40,200
five that God gives instruction so that not only the church at Ephesus, but every New

77
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:45,440
Testament church would have a pattern and would have the mind of the Lord with regard

78
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,040
to how to deal with these situations.

79
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:56,440
There are a variety of situations that churches have, the interactions of people, the relationships

80
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:02,440
within a local church, and we find that God provides instruction, and when God provides

81
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:06,160
instruction, it is our duty to know it and to apply it.

82
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,239
And so we find that as we enter into this passage of Scripture, number one, if you're

83
00:06:09,239 --> 00:06:12,839
taking notes, regarding the elder.

84
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,959
We see this in verse one and two regarding the elder.

85
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:19,519
Now the word elder is interpreted by the context.

86
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:24,279
Understand that even in this single passage of Scripture, we find that the word elder

87
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:29,239
is used in verses one and two, but then again in verse 17 and 19, here in verses one and

88
00:06:29,239 --> 00:06:35,399
two it is referring to those who are the elderly, those that are up in age, if we could use

89
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:39,880
that phraseology this morning, the senior saints, if you will, that is who is being

90
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,079
referred to in verses one and two.

91
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:47,640
In verse 17 and 19, when he uses the word elder, it gives clarity in verse 17 where

92
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,760
it talks about let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor.

93
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:55,160
Verse 19, against an elder received not an accusation.

94
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:00,279
He's speaking about the leader of the church, the office that was dealt with in chapter

95
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:04,959
number three, that office, the pastor.

96
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:10,720
And so we find that here in verses one and two, he first deals with instruction with

97
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:17,160
regard to the elder and emphasis is placed, notice in verse number one, rebuke not an

98
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:22,559
elder, but entreat him as a father.

99
00:07:22,559 --> 00:07:27,799
In verse number two, the elder women as mothers.

100
00:07:27,799 --> 00:07:34,040
So we find that Paul is giving this instruction to Timothy with regard to how he is to interact

101
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:39,959
with those within the congregation and not only how he is to interact, but then setting

102
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:44,799
forth the pattern for how each member is to interact one with another.

103
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:48,799
We find that there's an emphasis placed in verse one and two when we talk about the instruction

104
00:07:48,799 --> 00:07:55,760
regarding the elder or the elderly, that there's an emphasis placed on honoring and respecting

105
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,640
the elder men and the elder women.

106
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:05,679
He says this, notice what he uses as an example, he says in verse number one, as a father.

107
00:08:05,679 --> 00:08:09,160
He says in verse number two, as mothers.

108
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:14,760
You think about that relationship that we understand physically in our immediate families

109
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:20,440
and you find that the application is being made within the context of a church family

110
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:26,480
and understanding that there are churches, and really a church should have representation

111
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,799
in each age bracket.

112
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:33,919
A church that only has senior saints is a church that's dying, a church that needs to

113
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:39,039
be revitalized, a church that needs to reach a next generation, and you have a church that

114
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:43,799
has elderly, you have a church that has younger, and everywhere in between, and if you're not

115
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:47,479
sure where you fit, you just kind of pick a category, you say I'm not ready to be a

116
00:08:47,479 --> 00:08:51,840
senior saint, ask your spouse or ask somebody else that you trust and they'll let you know

117
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,760
if you're a senior saint or not.

118
00:08:53,760 --> 00:09:00,080
But the reality is that there's an emphasis placed on honoring and respecting.

119
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:07,359
That's important for us to understand, especially within the shift that's taking place today,

120
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,239
culturally speaking, within our nation.

121
00:09:11,239 --> 00:09:17,880
Culturally speaking, there is a shift that is taking place in America with regard to,

122
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:25,679
and I'm speaking in general terms, with regard to how we interact with the elderly.

123
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:33,039
It's a sad thing when it's as if a younger generation lives and acts as if they do not

124
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:36,520
need the older generation.

125
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:42,400
And we find that the importance within, and bringing it back into the context of the scripture

126
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:49,799
and dealing with the church, there's opportunity to glean from the experience and wisdom of

127
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:52,239
those that have gone before us.

128
00:09:52,239 --> 00:09:54,719
It's an opportunity that we have to learn.

129
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:59,960
I have men, personally, that are pastors of churches that are...

130
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:04,120
that exceed my age, that some of them have pastored

131
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,040
the church that they pastor longer than I've been alive,

132
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,600
and those are men that I will counsel with,

133
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,560
those are men that I like to get into their presence

134
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,700
and to have conversation with, why?

135
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,920
Because I can learn something from them.

136
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,560
They have experienced the many times that I've not yet had,

137
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,040
and I have the opportunity to glean from,

138
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,360
to learn from their experiences.

139
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:32,220
I'm now getting to the place and being at that age

140
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,640
where I'm kinda shifting a little bit,

141
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,600
where I have younger folks that come to me

142
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,840
that are just new in the ministry, starting a church,

143
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,880
and they say, hey, you've been pastoring now

144
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,120
for this number of years, and I got some questions for you.

145
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,760
Have you experienced this?

146
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,620
And I begin to hear the questions, and I see, Tim,

147
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:53,540
that I'm changing from one category to another category,

148
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:56,560
but the reality is that's life, that's how it works.

149
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:01,160
It's a troubling thing when you find, and no doubt,

150
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,460
you've seen it in the news over the last several years,

151
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:09,300
where there are elderly people that are targeted for crimes.

152
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,440
It breaks my heart when I see those things,

153
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:17,440
because there used to be an understanding culturally,

154
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,200
even without the church on the outside,

155
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,300
just culturally speaking, there was a respect

156
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,540
for the elderly.

157
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:30,500
There are still today in some cultures,

158
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,700
and especially if you were to study the Asian culture,

159
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,420
it's extremely prevalent within their culture

160
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:39,180
of respect for the elderly.

161
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:42,000
They are extremely careful.

162
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,740
I've spoken with many that have ministered

163
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:48,420
in that particular context, and it's amazing

164
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:52,100
of the way in which they teach the young people,

165
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,660
and it's really just driven into them

166
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:58,700
on that responsibility to have the honor

167
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,140
and respect for the elderly.

168
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:05,380
So when Paul is writing to Timothy, he says to him,

169
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,980
look, within the church, you're gonna have

170
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:11,860
some elderly people, and that's a good thing,

171
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:15,620
that's appropriate, a healthy church is going to be made up

172
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:20,060
of a diversity of those age brackets, if you will,

173
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,740
but he says, here's how you handle,

174
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,780
here's how you interact with, you entreat him,

175
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:28,380
meaning the elderly men, as a father,

176
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:33,300
and then for the elderly women as mothers.

177
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,820
What a great picture that we find that God gives

178
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:39,700
for the church and how they're to function.

179
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,220
He then deals with, again, in verses one and two,

180
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,940
regarding not only the elderly,

181
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:47,580
but he gives instruction regarding the younger.

182
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,180
Notice in verse number one, he says,

183
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:51,260
rebuke not an elder, but entreat him as a father,

184
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:55,060
and then he says this, and the younger men as brethren.

185
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:58,820
In verse number two, the elder women as mothers,

186
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:03,580
the younger as sisters with all purity.

187
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:06,500
And so as we begin to understand the interaction

188
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:10,420
that Timothy would have with the younger men and women

189
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:13,340
in the church, that he's to interact with them

190
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:16,340
as a brother or as a sister.

191
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,700
We find that we often will use that phraseology

192
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,220
that we're brothers and sisters in Christ.

193
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,420
What a blessing to have that relationship,

194
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,900
that bond, if you will.

195
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:29,020
And we find that he gives this picture

196
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:32,820
for us to understand that bond that is there,

197
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:36,140
the relationships between the pastor and the members,

198
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,900
but then for member to member

199
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,020
and how they're to interact one with another.

200
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,140
And he talks about these relationships.

201
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,540
We would understand that they're to be appropriate

202
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,540
and they're to be pure.

203
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,220
He says at the end of verse number two,

204
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:50,980
with all purity, the importance of appropriateness

205
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,180
and purity, I think about a brother.

206
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,380
I only have a, physically speaking,

207
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,940
I only have one brother.

208
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:01,620
And you think about brothers and the bond.

209
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,140
And you may not have a good relationship

210
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:04,980
with your brother.

211
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,220
I'll just speak of my relationship with my brother.

212
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,740
I have a good relationship with my brother.

213
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,300
I got to see him this past weekend

214
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,580
as his daughter graduated from high school

215
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,740
and what a blessing to be able to see him.

216
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,700
And we have that bond.

217
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,300
Did we always get along all of the time?

218
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,580
No, if you have a brother,

219
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,260
you know there are times that you disagreed

220
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,620
and you had some kind of,

221
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,540
but you know there was something

222
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,900
that was interesting about that.

223
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,860
Though my brother and I could have a disagreement,

224
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,220
we were on the same team.

225
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:34,900
We were unified and if someone else were to step in,

226
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,380
no, sorry, that's not how it works.

227
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,460
There was a bond.

228
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:43,020
A brother is born for adversity.

229
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,780
And that doesn't mean that a brother is born

230
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,300
so you can fight with them.

231
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,260
It means that your brother is your brother

232
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,900
and when there's adversity that comes,

233
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:53,860
it means that you have that relationship.

234
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,940
God did not allow me to have a sister,

235
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,980
but I have two daughters and we have a son

236
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,780
and so I get to see in their relationships

237
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:04,260
and their interactions some of how that works.

238
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,580
And you know, though God didn't allow me

239
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:09,380
to have any sisters, just having one brother,

240
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:12,700
I do understand through seeing other relationships

241
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:16,020
and other families that oftentimes a brother

242
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:19,300
has a protective spirit about a sister.

243
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,260
A protective spirit about a sister.

244
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,460
Why?

245
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,900
Because it's his sister.

246
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:29,060
Joseph is the youngest of our children,

247
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,020
but even as the youngest of our children

248
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,420
having two older sisters, you know,

249
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:36,700
Joseph, he wants to protect his sisters as much as he can.

250
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:40,660
And it's just, we didn't have to teach him that.

251
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:43,100
It's just kind of a natural thing

252
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,940
that he always loved them telling him.

253
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,540
We used to joke that he had three moms

254
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,140
and you know, that kind of thing,

255
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,540
being the youngest boy and what have you.

256
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:54,340
But the reality is that he wanted to protect his sisters.

257
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:57,860
And I begin to think about the physical relationships,

258
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:01,200
family relationships that we have one with another

259
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,860
and how God gives us this picture in verses one and two

260
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,820
and you begin to think about the way

261
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:11,340
that the family of God is to interact one with another.

262
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,260
You know, we find that in the scriptures,

263
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,880
the church at Corinth is an example,

264
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,420
of course a negative example,

265
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:19,780
of a church that was having great difficulties,

266
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:22,020
a church that had divisions and contentions,

267
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,420
a church that was carnal,

268
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,020
that could not receive all

269
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,900
that Paul wanted to instruct them with

270
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,220
because they were carnal.

271
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:33,760
They had those divisions and those contentions

272
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,900
and that is not God's plan for a local church.

273
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,220
God's plan for a local church

274
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,620
is that they would operate as a family.

275
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,380
He uses the term in the book of 1 Corinthians

276
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:45,440
that we're a body of the body of Christ,

277
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,960
a body that is fitly framed together,

278
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:51,200
a body that is to weep with those that weep,

279
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,040
to rejoice with those that rejoice.

280
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:53,880
Why?

281
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,160
Because we're a family.

282
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,640
What a blessing.

283
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,280
And here he gives this admonition to Timothy

284
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,360
with regard to the relationship

285
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,320
between him and the church family,

286
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:07,120
the elderly and the younger.

287
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,480
As we look, and I mentioned already by way of introduction,

288
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,040
beginning in verse number three,

289
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,120
he now turns the attention

290
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,300
not only to the elderly and to the younger,

291
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,080
but now instruction regarding the widows.

292
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,380
In verses three through 16,

293
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:22,100
we see that this instruction is provided

294
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,780
and the situation of emphasis

295
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:27,040
was obviously one where there were many widows.

296
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:30,340
The church was in need of direction.

297
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,300
Why do I say that?

298
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,860
Well, because God gave it.

299
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:37,020
The church was in need of how do we handle this circumstance?

300
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,020
How do we handle this situation?

301
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,340
I think about Moses

302
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,540
when he was leading the children of Israel,

303
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,380
there were times in which Moses

304
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,140
was leading the children of Israel

305
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,660
and he just simply did not know what to do.

306
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,040
There had not been instruction that had been provided

307
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,220
with dealing with a particular circumstance or situation.

308
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,900
And you know what Moses did?

309
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,780
He said, let us ask the Lord.

310
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:00,040
Let us seek the face of God.

311
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:03,260
Now at that point, the canon of scripture was not closed

312
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:05,880
and we find that God would answer the question.

313
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,900
God would give counsel and direction, instruction

314
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:13,580
for how to deal with that circumstance.

315
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:15,140
What a great example.

316
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:19,140
We now find here with Timothy ministering in Ephesus,

317
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,540
again, the canon of scripture not being closed.

318
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:25,180
They're dealing with this situation with having widows

319
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,860
and widows that are widows indeed.

320
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:30,800
The scripture uses that terminology and then younger widows

321
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,540
and how do we deal with this?

322
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:35,580
How do we as a local church handle this?

323
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,900
And God gives them instruction.

324
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:38,900
The instruction is clear.

325
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,700
The instruction is pointed.

326
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,900
We find that today that we have the opportunity

327
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:47,660
to go to the scriptures and to find what God says

328
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:52,600
with regard to these circumstances that even we may face.

329
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,460
Now it's important for us to understand

330
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:57,820
that in the first century, many times,

331
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:02,540
if a husband was a father, a husband and father was killed

332
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,940
through whatever means it was,

333
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:07,880
whether it was just a sickness or an accident or so forth,

334
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:12,440
there was really no way, no means by which the spouse,

335
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,679
the wife, the widow in this context

336
00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:18,559
would be able to provide for herself.

337
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,760
And so we find that there's instruction that's given.

338
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:25,160
Today across the world, there are places that have systems,

339
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,280
if you will, that are very similar

340
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,740
to what you would have found in the first century.

341
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:33,480
Today in America, we have various systems and things

342
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,760
where many times I think about myself

343
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,800
with regard to having a life insurance policy.

344
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,760
And I'm not here, I don't sell life insurance,

345
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,480
so don't get the wrong idea,

346
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,679
but I made a decision when we got married

347
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:49,720
and we had children that I got a life insurance policy on me

348
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,880
so that if or when I die,

349
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,960
that Holly would receive some amount of finances

350
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,119
to be able to take care of her and the children.

351
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:01,119
Why?

352
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:08,799
Because I felt like that was my duty, my responsibility, and so therefore I made that decision.

353
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:16,399
And so every month, still to this day, I pay for a life insurance policy so that that would

354
00:20:16,399 --> 00:20:20,939
be taken care of, not to be a burden and what have you.

355
00:20:20,939 --> 00:20:25,879
And so we have different circumstances today, but we understand that the biblical truth

356
00:20:25,879 --> 00:20:30,459
is still appropriate and applicable, and as we seek the mind of God with regard to

357
00:20:30,459 --> 00:20:36,559
circumstances that we would face, we run to His word, we establish that God has the answers

358
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:40,599
and the principles that we need to glean so that we can make application.

359
00:20:40,599 --> 00:20:48,119
So notice with me in verse number three, Paul says to Timothy, honor widows that are widows

360
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:50,579
indeed.

361
00:20:50,579 --> 00:20:56,059
So it's interesting because he starts using that phrase right away, widows indeed, and

362
00:20:56,059 --> 00:20:59,979
we'll see it repeated, and then notice in verse number four, it begins with a conjunction,

363
00:20:59,979 --> 00:21:09,019
it says, but, but if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to show piety

364
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:16,419
at home and to requite their parents, for that is good and acceptable before God.

365
00:21:16,419 --> 00:21:20,419
Now anytime that you find where God's word says this is good and acceptable, you ought

366
00:21:20,419 --> 00:21:23,139
to take note because this is what pleases the Lord.

367
00:21:23,139 --> 00:21:28,739
And so we find that God is giving the instruction, He says in verse number five, now she that

368
00:21:28,739 --> 00:21:34,599
is a widow indeed and desolate, trusteth in God and continueth in supplications and prayers

369
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:40,059
night and day, but she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth, and these things

370
00:21:40,059 --> 00:21:45,339
give in charge that they may be blameless.

371
00:21:45,339 --> 00:21:49,059
But in verse number eight, if any provide not for his own, and especially for those

372
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:54,179
of his own house, he hath denied the faith and is worse than an infidel.

373
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:58,779
Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old, having been the wife

374
00:21:58,779 --> 00:22:03,859
of one man, well reported of for good works, if she have brought up children, if she have

375
00:22:03,859 --> 00:22:08,860
lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints' feet, if she have relieved the afflicted,

376
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:15,419
if she have diligently followed every good work, but the younger widows refuse.

377
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:20,459
For when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they will marry, having damnation

378
00:22:20,459 --> 00:22:25,299
because they have cast off their first faith, and withal they learn to be idle, wandering

379
00:22:25,299 --> 00:22:30,339
about from house to house, and not only idle, but tattlers also in busy bodies, speaking

380
00:22:30,339 --> 00:22:33,099
things which they ought not.

381
00:22:33,099 --> 00:22:37,940
Verse 14, I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house,

382
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:42,139
give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully, for some are already turned

383
00:22:42,139 --> 00:22:45,019
after, turned aside after Satan.

384
00:22:45,019 --> 00:22:52,000
If any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church

385
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,899
be charged that it may relieve them that are widows indeed.

386
00:22:57,899 --> 00:23:01,500
It's interesting as you look at verse number seven, the Bible says, and these things give

387
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:05,139
in charge that they may be blameless.

388
00:23:05,139 --> 00:23:10,659
So Timothy has the responsibility to communicate this truth so that those that are within the

389
00:23:10,659 --> 00:23:17,259
church, and now we find that as God's Word, this letter has been preserved in the Bible,

390
00:23:17,259 --> 00:23:22,739
that we can understand the mind of the Lord in dealing with these situations.

391
00:23:22,739 --> 00:23:24,379
So let's break it down, if you will.

392
00:23:24,379 --> 00:23:28,039
The first aspect, he deals with widows that are widows indeed.

393
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:32,059
We see this really primarily in verses three through ten, there's a couple of verses scattered

394
00:23:32,059 --> 00:23:38,099
in there that deal with the younger, but notice that there is here given to us, those that

395
00:23:38,099 --> 00:23:43,059
are widows indeed, the primary responsibility, and now understand, this is important for

396
00:23:43,059 --> 00:23:50,220
us to understand, the primary responsibility for caring for a widow that is a widow indeed

397
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:56,019
is the immediate family, not the church, okay?

398
00:23:56,019 --> 00:23:57,580
That's biblical.

399
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:01,699
I've had people say, oh, we have widows, man, the church should just pay them all every

400
00:24:01,699 --> 00:24:04,580
month a certain amount, that's not what the Bible says.

401
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:09,019
If they're widows that don't have family, now all of a sudden we've gotten to deal with

402
00:24:09,019 --> 00:24:16,699
that, but the primary responsibility for the widow's care is the immediate family.

403
00:24:16,699 --> 00:24:23,100
Notice in verse number four, but if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first

404
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:30,940
to show piety at home and to requite their parents, for that is good and acceptable before

405
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,579
God.

406
00:24:32,579 --> 00:24:37,500
Not only do we see there in verse number four the truth with regard to the primary

407
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:43,540
responsibility being to the immediate family and not to the church, we find again, as Paul

408
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:49,179
would summarize the entire teaching in verse number 16, he says, if any man or woman that

409
00:24:49,179 --> 00:24:57,059
believeth have widows, let them relieve them and let not the church be charged.

410
00:24:57,059 --> 00:24:59,419
Now, that's not confusing, is it?

411
00:24:59,419 --> 00:25:00,600
Pretty clear.

412
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,320
And it says why, why should the church not be charged?

413
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:09,519
Well, that it, the church may relieve them that are widows indeed.

414
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:13,359
They have no family, they have no one that could care for them, and therefore it becomes

415
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:16,959
the responsibility of the church.

416
00:25:16,959 --> 00:25:22,679
There's a warning that is given to the family members of widows in verse number eight.

417
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:28,040
Notice the warning, if any provide not for his own, and especially for those of his own

418
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:32,239
house, he hath denied the faith and is worse than an infidel.

419
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,919
That's strong language.

420
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:38,959
We find that within the context of this passage of Scripture, many times verse eight is taken

421
00:25:38,959 --> 00:25:43,519
out of context and people just use it and make the application however they want, but

422
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:49,119
we understand primarily within the context of this verse of Scripture is the teaching

423
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:51,119
with regard to widows.

424
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:57,799
And therefore, if you have a widow that's a widow indeed in your immediate family, you

425
00:25:57,799 --> 00:26:02,359
have a responsibility, you have a responsibility.

426
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:07,639
And we find that that responsibility, that warning is given in verse number eight.

427
00:26:07,639 --> 00:26:12,760
It's not something that you just simply say, well, I'm going to let somebody else have

428
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,760
that responsibility.

429
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,040
No, it's your responsibility.

430
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:22,160
We find that the criteria is laid forth, the qualifications, if you will, for assistance.

431
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:28,279
Notice in verse number five, now she that is a widow indeed and desolate trusteth in

432
00:26:28,279 --> 00:26:33,320
God and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day.

433
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:39,440
This one that is being referred to in verse number five, that now there's no family, there's

434
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,839
no immediate family, and there's the need for the church, there's some criteria that

435
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:44,839
is given.

436
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:51,040
Notice in verse number one, excuse me, verse number nine, let not a widow be taken into

437
00:26:51,199 --> 00:26:56,720
the number under threescore years old, having been the wife of one man.

438
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,639
So there's actually an age that's given in verse number nine, an age of 60 that's provided.

439
00:27:01,639 --> 00:27:06,479
And we find that that is given to us as we see the contrast in the teaching with regard

440
00:27:06,479 --> 00:27:13,239
to the younger widows and what their tendency would be, and no doubt writing from and dealing

441
00:27:13,239 --> 00:27:18,000
with the situation in Ephesus, not only a tendency, but probably something that had

442
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,199
actively taken place.

443
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:24,559
So he gives an age in verse number nine and then notices that the criteria continues in

444
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:30,079
verse number 10, well reported of for good works.

445
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:35,479
If she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saint's

446
00:27:35,479 --> 00:27:41,160
feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good

447
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,160
work.

448
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:46,380
And as we look at verse number 10, these are not things that are given that would make

449
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:49,079
this individual a saved person.

450
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:51,679
No, they're saved by the grace of God.

451
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:56,399
They're saved because of what Jesus Christ did on the cross of Calvary, his death barrel

452
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:57,940
and glorious resurrection.

453
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:03,119
But because they were saved, this was how they were serving God.

454
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:09,519
These were the works that they were doing not to be saved or to stay saved, but because

455
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:11,559
of their salvation.

456
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:17,720
And we find that the instruction is given with regard to, if you will, criteria or qualifications

457
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,479
for how the church would provide that assistance.

458
00:28:21,479 --> 00:28:23,880
And we find that the responsibility is given.

459
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:29,519
I read verse 16 a moment ago, but the last part of the verse says that it may relieve,

460
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:35,080
speaking about the church, them that are widows indeed.

461
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,279
So there may be a local church.

462
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:41,299
The church at Ephesus was in a situation evidently where there were several widows.

463
00:28:41,299 --> 00:28:43,479
We have a number of widows in our church.

464
00:28:43,479 --> 00:28:48,599
And there may be a situation that presents itself where there's a widow that has no family,

465
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:54,400
that has no ability to be able to provide for themselves, and therefore the church then

466
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,919
has a responsibility.

467
00:28:56,919 --> 00:29:01,400
But we find that primarily the responsibility is for the immediate family.

468
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:06,799
By the way, as you look at this portion of Scripture, it's not so that a church can say,

469
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:09,479
well, that's not my problem or not my responsibility.

470
00:29:09,479 --> 00:29:14,880
It's so that this is God's Word that God gives the instruction to the church on how

471
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,479
to handle these matters.

472
00:29:17,479 --> 00:29:20,320
And what a blessing to have the mind of the Lord.

473
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,960
Notice with me, he then not only deals with those that are widows indeed, but he deals

474
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,119
with younger widows, the terminology that is used.

475
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:31,559
We find that in verse number five, he talked about the one that was a widow indeed in verse

476
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:37,839
six, but she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth, evidently dealing with those

477
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:42,760
that were widows, that were the young widows, because we find that we come back to verse

478
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:46,679
number 11, and it says, but the younger widows refuse.

479
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:53,440
For when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they will marry.

480
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:59,039
And so we find that there would be some that were widows, that were widows indeed, the

481
00:29:59,039 --> 00:29:59,880
older, the...

482
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,660
verse nine dealing with the age,

483
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:04,720
but then verse number 11 talking about younger widows.

484
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,920
And again, with regard to the timeline,

485
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:11,040
and we understand that there would be those

486
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,600
in the category of younger and older

487
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,440
when their spouse would die, their husband would die.

488
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,320
And so we find that here,

489
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,820
God says in verse number 11 to refuse them.

490
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,660
Why?

491
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,800
Because when they wax wanton against Christ,

492
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,000
they will marry.

493
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,080
But not only that,

494
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,400
notice what the Bible says in verse 13

495
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:33,180
with regard to the behavior, if you will,

496
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:35,880
of these younger women, these younger widows

497
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:39,600
in contrast to what we read in verse number 10.

498
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,600
In verse number 13, the Bible says in with all,

499
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,320
they, speaking about the younger widows,

500
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:49,200
they learn, notice what it says, to be idle.

501
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:53,360
Wandering about from house to house,

502
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:58,360
and not only idle, but tattlers also in busy bodies,

503
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:02,160
speaking things which they ought not.

504
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,160
And so Paul begins to address the situation.

505
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:08,960
Again, I believe that there were probably some experiences

506
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,560
or some circumstances that Paul had understanding

507
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,060
of these things taking place.

508
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:17,760
And it was not just a matter of this may happen,

509
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,960
but probably this was something that had taken place.

510
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:25,040
And this one that is referred to as being a younger widow,

511
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,280
not only when they wax wanton against Christ,

512
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,840
will they marry, but they learn to be idle.

513
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,520
And then it goes downhill from there.

514
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,640
They're wandering about from house to house

515
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,560
and not only idle, but tattlers in busy bodies.

516
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:41,940
The Bible says this, speaking things which they ought not.

517
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,360
That's not a compliment in verse number 13.

518
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,960
It's an indictment against behavior that's not appropriate,

519
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:53,280
not behavior that's pleasing to God.

520
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:56,560
You think about the idea of being idle

521
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,280
and being busy bodies and speaking things

522
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,600
which they ought not.

523
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,520
Let me say this, this morning by way of application,

524
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:07,240
it doesn't just have to be a young widow

525
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:10,240
that gets involved in this kind of inappropriate behavior.

526
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,320
Amen, it doesn't have to even be a widow.

527
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,440
It doesn't even have to be a lady.

528
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,240
Amen, sometimes all people,

529
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,600
regardless of their marital status,

530
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,860
regardless of their age,

531
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:27,340
can be guilty of being busy bodies.

532
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:30,840
We find, we've been studying on Sunday night,

533
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,620
excuse me, on Wednesday night,

534
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,320
through 1 and 2 Thessalonians,

535
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,860
walk worthy and please God.

536
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:39,620
In verse number 11 of 2 Thessalonians 3,

537
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,419
the Bible says, for we hear that there are some

538
00:32:41,419 --> 00:32:43,200
which walk among you disorderly,

539
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,559
working not at all, but are busy bodies.

540
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:50,380
And we find here, listen, it's not just a marital status

541
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:53,900
or an age relation that determines every person,

542
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:56,059
regardless of those criteria,

543
00:32:56,059 --> 00:32:59,100
can be guilty of being a busy body.

544
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,660
Speaking, as it says at the end of verse number 13,

545
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:04,419
things which they ought not.

546
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:10,139
Sometimes we refer to it as having a filter.

547
00:33:10,139 --> 00:33:12,900
You ever meet somebody that seems like they have no filter?

548
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,320
And what do we mean by that?

549
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,740
Well, they just speak.

550
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:18,180
They speak and they speak and they speak.

551
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:20,180
Sometimes they say things that they ought not say.

552
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:21,700
They get involved in areas

553
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,059
where they ought not get involved.

554
00:33:24,139 --> 00:33:25,220
You ever said something, you say, man,

555
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:28,020
I wish I had not said that, it's already been said.

556
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:29,860
We need to be careful about this situation

557
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,900
because what can happen is we can become,

558
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,740
if we're not careful, again,

559
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:37,600
without regard to marital status or age,

560
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,460
you can become a busy body getting yourself involved

561
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:44,220
in areas where you ought not get involved.

562
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:47,260
And you hear that word about being a gossip.

563
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,660
Now I understand how it works typically

564
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,860
in a church setting.

565
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:52,540
It's not really gossip, it's just a prayer request.

566
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:54,120
I understand how it works.

567
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,419
But sometimes you fool yourself

568
00:33:57,419 --> 00:33:59,080
more than you fool somebody else.

569
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:02,500
You fool yourself more than you fool somebody else.

570
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,700
Hey, I got a prayer request for you,

571
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:04,779
but really I just want to gossip.

572
00:34:04,779 --> 00:34:05,860
I want to tell you what I found out.

573
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,820
Let me tell you, did you hear what happened?

574
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:10,620
Oh, would you please pray for them?

575
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:13,040
Listen, be careful, be careful.

576
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:15,899
This is not pleasing to God.

577
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:18,100
And we understand again within the context

578
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:22,420
He's dealing with the younger widows,

579
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:26,660
but the reality is that any of us could be guilty

580
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:30,820
of speaking about things which we ought not,

581
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:35,420
becoming tattlers and busy bodies.

582
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:37,540
Let me say this.

583
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:40,660
They didn't have social media back then like we do today.

584
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:43,020
Amen?

585
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:46,220
They went, according to verse number 13,

586
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:48,300
from house to house.

587
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,860
You know what people do today on social media?

588
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,220
They don't have to leave and leave anywhere.

589
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:53,420
They just sit there and they just,

590
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:54,980
I don't have social media.

591
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:58,660
Sometimes I wish I did, but most times I'm glad I don't.

592
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,540
The times that I wish I did is when I hear

593
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,140
about a good article or something

594
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,300
that a preacher friend wrote

595
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,580
and I didn't have an opportunity to see it

596
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:07,260
because I don't have the social media, what have you.

597
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,459
And sometimes I'll ask somebody,

598
00:35:08,459 --> 00:35:11,179
hey, can you just email it to me, whatever.

599
00:35:11,179 --> 00:35:13,739
But most times I'm happy I don't have social media.

600
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:15,739
And here's the problem.

601
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:17,700
You can sit around and you can be guilty

602
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:20,220
of being tattlers and busy bodies

603
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:22,459
and speaking the things that you ought not speak

604
00:35:22,459 --> 00:35:24,420
because you're sitting behind a screen somewhere

605
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:27,500
on a phone or a device of some nature.

606
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,059
Be careful, be careful.

607
00:35:31,739 --> 00:35:35,260
We continue and we look here at a pattern

608
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:39,540
that God establishes as Paul gives this instruction

609
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:43,420
with regard to those that are the younger widows.

610
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:45,500
He speaks about those that are widows indeed,

611
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,860
the older, and he talks about their testimony

612
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,059
and their behavior.

613
00:35:50,059 --> 00:35:52,779
But he talks about these younger and he says refuse them

614
00:35:52,779 --> 00:35:56,739
because here's the likelihood of what they will do

615
00:35:56,739 --> 00:35:59,059
and here's perhaps what some have already done

616
00:35:59,059 --> 00:36:02,140
and participated in and we find that he gives us

617
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:06,300
in verse number 14, excuse me, a pattern to be established.

618
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:10,899
He says, I will therefore that the younger women marry,

619
00:36:10,899 --> 00:36:13,300
bear children, guide the house,

620
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:17,380
give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully.

621
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,220
Now, I understand again that this is not

622
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:22,020
a culturally popular verse of scripture

623
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:25,420
with regard to the roles, if you will,

624
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:28,860
but we understand that Paul is establishing a pattern

625
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:29,700
and I'm thankful.

626
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:32,619
We started a few weeks ago a Sunday school class,

627
00:36:32,619 --> 00:36:33,660
a marriage Sunday school class.

628
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:34,899
I'm thankful for marriage.

629
00:36:34,899 --> 00:36:37,700
I'm thankful that God instituted marriage.

630
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:40,100
I'm thankful, I remember reading the verse,

631
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,619
when I first, after I got saved,

632
00:36:41,619 --> 00:36:43,540
whoso findeth a wife, findeth a good thing

633
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:45,580
and obtain the favor of the Lord, amen.

634
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,220
And I'm glad for Holly.

635
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:51,459
I'm glad that God allowed me the opportunity to be married

636
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:54,059
and that we'll be celebrating our 23rd wedding anniversary

637
00:36:54,059 --> 00:36:54,899
this year.

638
00:36:54,899 --> 00:36:56,820
What a blessing, I am blessed.

639
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:00,239
We understand that there are some that will not be married,

640
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:01,820
but we find here, Paul deals with that

641
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,600
in 1 Corinthians chapter seven,

642
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,459
but we find that here in verse number 14,

643
00:37:05,459 --> 00:37:07,899
he's laying forth this pattern

644
00:37:07,899 --> 00:37:09,020
and he talks about being married,

645
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:11,220
he talks about bearing children.

646
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,820
I spoke about this on Mother's Day.

647
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:15,459
We're living in a time today where people,

648
00:37:15,459 --> 00:37:18,179
unfortunately, especially in our society in America,

649
00:37:18,179 --> 00:37:20,619
they're viewing children as being a burden

650
00:37:20,619 --> 00:37:22,260
and not a blessing.

651
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:24,380
What a sad situation that is,

652
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:26,020
because the Bible says that the fruit of the womb

653
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,559
is his reward.

654
00:37:27,559 --> 00:37:30,339
Children are an heritage of the Lord.

655
00:37:30,339 --> 00:37:33,339
And we find that there are some that have that idea.

656
00:37:33,339 --> 00:37:35,660
Children, why do they look at them as being a burden?

657
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,179
Well, they get in way of their career,

658
00:37:37,179 --> 00:37:38,779
they get in way of their ambitions

659
00:37:38,779 --> 00:37:41,300
and their bucket list of where they wanna go

660
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,700
and what they wanna do and all of this type of thing,

661
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:46,779
but Paul lays forth this pattern.

662
00:37:46,779 --> 00:37:51,779
He says, not only would they have opportunity

663
00:37:51,899 --> 00:37:54,600
to marry and to bear children,

664
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,300
but this says guide the house.

665
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:00,260
What a blessing to think about the ministry

666
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:04,260
of a wife and a mother within the parameters here

667
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:07,899
that we find of giving this guidance to the house.

668
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,660
And having the opportunity,

669
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:12,580
yes, the husband is to be the head,

670
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:14,660
and we understand that as we look at Ephesians

671
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,580
and you look at Colossians

672
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:19,420
and you understand the pattern that God has set forth,

673
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:22,860
but what a privilege for ladies,

674
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:24,779
if they're married and have children,

675
00:38:24,779 --> 00:38:26,140
to give that guidance,

676
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:29,679
to invest in the fulfillment that is there.

677
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:34,299
Ends this verse by saying,

678
00:38:34,299 --> 00:38:37,419
not only to marry, bear children and guide the house,

679
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:40,419
but give none occasion to the adversary

680
00:38:40,419 --> 00:38:42,140
to speak reproachfully.

681
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:44,460
You know, the devil, the adversary,

682
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:47,220
you know that he hates everything that God is for

683
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:49,220
and that God loves.

684
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,580
God hates the church.

685
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:52,799
Or excuse me, sorry, let me rephrase that.

686
00:38:52,799 --> 00:38:54,140
Satan hates the church.

687
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:54,979
Why?

688
00:38:54,979 --> 00:38:58,140
Because God loves the church and gave himself for it.

689
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:00,220
The church is the bride of Christ.

690
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:01,260
Amen?

691
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:03,340
We find that Satan hates the church,

692
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:06,220
but Satan hates the family.

693
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:08,020
The family is under attack today.

694
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:10,859
The family is under attack today.

695
00:39:10,859 --> 00:39:13,880
We see it all over in our society.

696
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,720
Why?

697
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,660
Because the enemy hates the family.

698
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:21,739
Because God is the one that established the family.

699
00:39:21,739 --> 00:39:25,260
And so it says here that none occasion

700
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:27,220
to the adversary to speak reproachfully,

701
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:29,260
that they're in a situation

702
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:32,039
where they're not putting themselves in a position

703
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:34,799
where they're going to give place to the devil,

704
00:39:34,799 --> 00:39:36,559
that they're going to speak reproachfully,

705
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:39,039
as we saw earlier in verse number 13

706
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:41,200
with regard to the behavior that is established.

707
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,160
No, they're too busy to be dealing with that stuff.

708
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,960
They're focused on their home

709
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,359
and they're focused on their children

710
00:39:48,359 --> 00:39:49,239
and they're doing those things.

711
00:39:49,239 --> 00:39:51,599
They don't have time to get involved

712
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:53,559
with all these other things.

713
00:39:53,559 --> 00:39:58,559
It's amazing to me how many times I hear people say,

714
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:02,239
And this is a general statement, it's not about anyone specific in our church, though

715
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:10,179
we've all been guilty of saying it, I just don't have time to do X, Y, or Z.

716
00:40:10,179 --> 00:40:14,059
But yet, they spend how many hours a week on social media, they spend how many hours

717
00:40:14,059 --> 00:40:22,419
a week watching this stuff and doing this thing, and it's how we steward our time.

718
00:40:22,419 --> 00:40:24,739
I hear people say, I've got to make time for that.

719
00:40:24,739 --> 00:40:27,499
I tell people all the time, you can't make time.

720
00:40:27,499 --> 00:40:28,939
You can't make time.

721
00:40:28,939 --> 00:40:32,159
All you can do is steward time.

722
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:39,339
Because you have a certain number of hours every day, and how you steward those hours,

723
00:40:39,339 --> 00:40:40,339
you can't make more.

724
00:40:40,339 --> 00:40:44,239
So man, if I just had more time, you've got to steward it wisely.

725
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:45,859
Steward time.

726
00:40:45,859 --> 00:40:51,059
And so they would not have the time to get involved in the behavior that is outlined

727
00:40:51,059 --> 00:40:56,379
in verse number 13 because they're doing that which is outlined in verse number 14, and

728
00:40:56,379 --> 00:41:01,899
they're not giving any occasion to the adversary to be involved in that behavior.

729
00:41:01,899 --> 00:41:06,360
He says this in verse 15, and this is why we believe, and I said earlier, that some

730
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:09,479
have already been doing these things because it says in verse 15, for some are already

731
00:41:09,479 --> 00:41:12,540
turned aside after Satan.

732
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:16,579
There were some that were widows that were already behaving in this manner that was not

733
00:41:16,579 --> 00:41:18,099
pleasing to the Lord.

734
00:41:18,099 --> 00:41:24,139
And so we find that he ends the whole conversation, the whole instruction in verse 16, if any man

735
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:29,500
or woman that believeth have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be charged

736
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:34,259
that it may relieve them that are widows indeed.

737
00:41:34,259 --> 00:41:38,339
As we look at the first 16 verses of 1 Timothy chapter 5, you see it passes as an unusual

738
00:41:38,339 --> 00:41:40,139
message for a Sunday morning.

739
00:41:40,139 --> 00:41:44,479
It's a lot different than last week's message on Sunday morning.

740
00:41:44,479 --> 00:41:48,939
But the reality is that God gives us instruction for a reason.

741
00:41:48,939 --> 00:41:52,779
The Bible says in 2 Timothy chapter number 3, a verse that we often reference, that all

742
00:41:52,779 --> 00:41:56,939
Scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof,

743
00:41:56,939 --> 00:42:01,180
for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be perfect, throughly

744
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:03,500
furnished unto all good works.

745
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:06,199
So we have God's instruction.

746
00:42:06,199 --> 00:42:09,899
It is not for us to sit around and say, well, what do you think we should do about this

747
00:42:09,899 --> 00:42:10,899
situation?

748
00:42:10,899 --> 00:42:15,559
Hey, I think we should, no, we need to go to God's Word and we need to find out what

749
00:42:15,559 --> 00:42:20,739
did God set forth as the instruction that we as His people are to follow.

750
00:42:20,739 --> 00:42:22,660
You say, well, I don't like that very much.

751
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:26,300
Well, you better change your perspective because I can assure you that God's not going to change

752
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:27,300
His Word.

753
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,300
Amen?

754
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,979
You say, I just don't like that.

755
00:42:29,979 --> 00:42:32,419
Well, you better change because God's not changing.

756
00:42:32,419 --> 00:42:34,539
He was the same yesterday, today, and forever.

757
00:42:34,539 --> 00:42:35,539
Amen?

758
00:42:35,539 --> 00:42:37,660
He said, I'm the Lord, I change not.

759
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:43,239
And so what happens is we live in culture, we live in society that if we're not careful,

760
00:42:43,239 --> 00:42:51,360
we develop our thought process based upon the ideas of the world as opposed to the

761
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,679
truth of God's Word.

762
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:58,720
It is imperative that even as we look at a passage of Scripture like 1 Timothy chapter

763
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:03,319
5, verses 1 through 16, we say, why do we focus on this?

764
00:43:03,319 --> 00:43:10,559
Well, because God's church is made up of people, and the people that make up a church are to

765
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:16,919
interact one with another in a manner that is appropriate, that is God-honoring.

766
00:43:16,919 --> 00:43:24,720
That we have the opportunity as a church family to show by our interactions one with another

767
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,520
the love of Christ.

768
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,080
That we get to set forth a pattern.

769
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:33,119
You know, what a terrible thing when a church has a testimony in a community that, man,

770
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:36,759
all they do is fight and argue down there, there's always problems down there, I'd never

771
00:43:36,759 --> 00:43:38,399
go to that church.

772
00:43:38,399 --> 00:43:39,839
I've heard people say that.

773
00:43:40,479 --> 00:43:42,959
That's a terrible testimony.

774
00:43:42,959 --> 00:43:45,559
That's not what God's plan is.

775
00:43:45,559 --> 00:43:51,399
So God gives to Timothy and then gives to all of us by way of preservation instruction

776
00:43:51,399 --> 00:43:54,000
for relationships within the church.

777
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,800
Did God know that there were going to be some elderly people in the church?

778
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,800
Absolutely.

779
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,360
Did He know there were going to be some younger people in the church?

780
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,360
Absolutely.

781
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:01,360
So He says, here's how you interact.

782
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:04,119
Did He know there'd be some widows?

783
00:44:04,119 --> 00:44:06,399
Some widows that are widows indeed, some that are younger?

784
00:44:06,399 --> 00:44:07,399
Yes, God knew.

785
00:44:07,399 --> 00:44:11,119
So God gives instruction.

786
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:14,239
We have a wonderful book here, the Bible.

787
00:44:14,239 --> 00:44:19,919
And in this book, God has given us the instruction for every situation we'll ever face.

788
00:44:19,919 --> 00:44:23,760
You say, well, I have this circumstance and I don't have…

789
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,480
Sometimes you've got to dig a little deeper.

790
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:31,519
Sometimes the answer isn't as surface ready as this one is in 1 Timothy chapter 5.

791
00:44:31,519 --> 00:44:35,440
Sometimes you've got to dig in, be students of the Word.

792
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:39,119
But you run to God and you run to His Word and say, how do we behave?

793
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:40,119
How do we interact?

794
00:44:40,119 --> 00:44:41,119
Hey, there's a widow.

795
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:42,119
What do we do?

796
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:43,119
Do we just…

797
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:49,720
No, let's run to the Bible and find out what God says and let's follow God's pattern

798
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:55,440
because that's going to bring honor and glory to God and result in His blessing and

799
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,440
His favor.

800
00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:01,600
And we want God's blessing, we want God's favor individually, but also corporately as

801
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:04,760
a church we want God's blessing and God's favor.

802
00:45:05,079 --> 00:45:06,079
Let's pray together.

803
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:07,079
Father, we love You.

804
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:08,079
We thank You for loving us.

805
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:11,480
We thank You for the privilege that You've given us to gather today.

806
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:15,600
And Lord, though this text of Scripture and this message is a little different for a Sunday

807
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:20,200
morning, we thank You that You've given us the instruction.

808
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:29,160
And God, we thank You that when we face circumstances in life, when we face questions and scenarios

809
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:34,720
that we do not have to just rely on our own understanding, no, we can run to Your Word

810
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:41,200
and we can receive Your instruction and we're thankful for the clarity that You've provided.

811
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:45,919
And God, I pray that You would help us to determine even in a message like this that

812
00:45:45,919 --> 00:45:50,059
we're going to be biblical, we're going to be scriptural.

813
00:45:50,059 --> 00:45:55,959
That as we deal with circumstances and relationships in a church that we're going to seek the

814
00:45:55,959 --> 00:46:01,079
mind of Christ, that we're going to apply the truth of Your Word in our interactions.

815
00:46:01,079 --> 00:46:07,200
Father, I pray that if there's one here that's not sure of heaven, God, we pray that they'd

816
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:11,480
be saved today, that they understand that, God, You love them.

817
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:14,639
You love them so much that You sent Your Son to die for them.

818
00:46:14,639 --> 00:46:20,359
The Lord Jesus Christ came here, God in flesh, to the sin-cursed world, lived a perfect sinless

819
00:46:20,359 --> 00:46:25,480
life, went to a cruel cross, bled and died, buried, but rose conquering sin, death, and

820
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:26,480
the grave.

821
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:31,000
He did all of that so that we might be forgiven.

822
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:36,519
God, if there's one that's not sure of heaven, they've never trusted the Lord Jesus Christ

823
00:46:36,519 --> 00:46:41,200
as their personal Savior, I pray the Holy Spirit of God would convict them this morning,

824
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:46,399
convince them of their sin and of Christ's righteousness and of judgment to come.

825
00:46:46,399 --> 00:46:52,119
I pray for every child of God, Lord, would You help us to determine this morning that

826
00:46:52,119 --> 00:46:59,119
we will be doers of the Word, that we will think and behave biblically, scripturally.

827
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:02,799
In this moment of invitation, we pray that You'd have Your will in way.

828
00:47:02,799 --> 00:47:03,799
We'll thank You for it.

829
00:47:03,799 --> 00:47:04,919
In Christ's name we pray.
