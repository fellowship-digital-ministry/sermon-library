WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.519
5, and I want you to remember we're studying through the first and second letters that

00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:06.920
Paul writes to Timothy.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.560
We're entering into the fifth chapter here this morning.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:14.500
Our theme, of course, for this calendar year is continue, as we see the charge that's given

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.719
throughout both of these letters.

00:00:16.719 --> 00:00:22.760
To continue in the face of adversity and difficulty, the admonition, the charge is continue.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.000
And we find that as we look at this letter, this epistle, it provides not only a charge

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.080
to Timothy, but we find that there's much within this particular letter that is given

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:39.400
as instruction for how God's people are to behave in God's church.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.159
And we spent much time in the third chapter, really the end of the second chapter and through

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:47.119
the third chapter, dealing with behavior in God's church.

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:51.700
We had two messages with that title, part one and part two.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:58.060
And we find that as we understand the truth that God has given, we find that God is the

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.779
one that is the head of the church.

00:00:59.779 --> 00:01:01.340
He instituted the church.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.540
The church is God's idea.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.580
But we find that he gives instruction for behavior in his church.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.459
There is behavior that pleases God, and there is, that behavior is appropriate.

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:17.139
We find there is inappropriate behavior that does not please the Lord.

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:19.900
It does not bring honor and glory to God.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.900
We find that Jesus said this in John chapter number four, God is a spirit, and they that

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.680
worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.059
We find this morning as we, of course, last week looked at the fourth chapter of the book

00:01:34.059 --> 00:01:40.339
of 1 Timothy, there was an emphasis, an obvious emphasis that was placed upon sound teaching

00:01:40.339 --> 00:01:42.260
versus false teaching.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.339
Timothy had the responsibility to teach truth.

00:01:45.339 --> 00:01:52.559
The individual believer must recognize what they should receive and what they should refuse.

00:01:52.559 --> 00:01:57.940
We asked the question, the title of the message last week was really a question, how is your

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:58.940
diet?

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:05.059
We're speaking spiritually about our diet and making sure that we are receiving those

00:02:05.059 --> 00:02:10.179
things that we ought to receive and refusing or rejecting those things that we ought not

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:11.179
receive.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.660
And so we looked at that last week in 1 Timothy chapter number four.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.139
As we enter into the fifth chapter, we find that Paul begins to provide instruction with

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:22.259
regard to relationships within the church.

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:27.179
You find that we, obviously as a church, we're a church family, and there are relationships

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:33.500
that we have in the church, and so Timothy is instructed on how he is to interact with

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:40.520
those that are making up the church, the members of the church, and his behavior and interactions

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:45.320
with church family would be an example to the rest of the body.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.899
The pastor is to set forth the pattern.

00:02:48.899 --> 00:02:53.279
We find in this chapter in 1 Timothy 5 that God, the first 16 verses we're going to look

00:02:53.279 --> 00:02:58.320
at this morning, God deals with relationships in the church.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.240
In verses one and two, notice the Bible says, rebuke not an elder, but entreat him as a

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.300
father and the younger men as brethren, the elder women as mothers, the younger as sisters

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.039
with all purity.

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:12.960
Verse three, honor widows that are widows indeed.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.119
We'll skip down and look at verse 16, and we'll get into the message this morning.

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:23.520
The Bible says, if any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them relieve them, and let

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:31.199
not the church be charged that it may relieve them that are widows indeed.

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:35.139
So as we come to this fifth chapter, look at 1 Timothy, we find that God provides this

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.259
instruction with regard to relationships within the church.

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:45.580
By the way, God is an eternal God that understands all things, he has all wisdom and all knowledge,

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:51.000
and we find that he's given us a book, the Bible, the mind of Christ, and he's given

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.380
us the instruction that we need to follow.

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.820
It's very interesting as you come to 1 Timothy chapter number five that there are two verses

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:04.820
that are given really with regard to the members of the church as a whole, the senior saints

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:09.020
and the younger folks, and you pick which category you're in, but we find that there's

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:15.020
a two verses given to that, and then from verse three down through verse number 16,

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:19.940
God deals with the subject matter of widows, and we find that he provides a great deal

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.380
of instruction, obviously, and we'll deal with this as we go through it.

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.420
There was a number of widows that would be there in the church at Ephesus, and they needed

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.959
instruction on how to handle this.

00:04:32.959 --> 00:04:40.000
It's also interesting to note that in Acts chapter number six, there's a contention that

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.000
arises within the church at Jerusalem, and that contention is really with regard to how

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.920
the widows were being cared for.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:55.200
It's very interesting as you begin to couple this passage with that truth in Acts chapter

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:00.720
number six and understanding the attack of the enemy that is laid forth in the book of

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:08.160
Acts and how that the enemy seeks to attack from without, and that persecution, the religious

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.720
leaders, they, you cannot speak in the name of Jesus, and so on and so forth, we're going

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.799
to beat you, we're going to imprison you, and we're going to try to stop you, and that

00:05:17.799 --> 00:05:19.480
wasn't very successful.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:24.600
And so then we find that the enemy would bring some division within in Acts chapter number

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:25.600
six.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.799
I'm thankful for the leaders of the church in Jerusalem and the wisdom that God gave

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.279
them for handling that situation, but we find that as we come to First Timothy chapter number

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:40.200
five that God gives instruction so that not only the church at Ephesus, but every New

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:45.440
Testament church would have a pattern and would have the mind of the Lord with regard

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.040
to how to deal with these situations.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:56.440
There are a variety of situations that churches have, the interactions of people, the relationships

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:02.440
within a local church, and we find that God provides instruction, and when God provides

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.160
instruction, it is our duty to know it and to apply it.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.239
And so we find that as we enter into this passage of Scripture, number one, if you're

00:06:09.239 --> 00:06:12.839
taking notes, regarding the elder.

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:14.959
We see this in verse one and two regarding the elder.

00:06:14.959 --> 00:06:19.519
Now the word elder is interpreted by the context.

00:06:19.519 --> 00:06:24.279
Understand that even in this single passage of Scripture, we find that the word elder

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:29.239
is used in verses one and two, but then again in verse 17 and 19, here in verses one and

00:06:29.239 --> 00:06:35.399
two it is referring to those who are the elderly, those that are up in age, if we could use

00:06:35.399 --> 00:06:39.880
that phraseology this morning, the senior saints, if you will, that is who is being

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.079
referred to in verses one and two.

00:06:42.079 --> 00:06:47.640
In verse 17 and 19, when he uses the word elder, it gives clarity in verse 17 where

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:51.760
it talks about let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor.

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:55.160
Verse 19, against an elder received not an accusation.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:07:00.279
He's speaking about the leader of the church, the office that was dealt with in chapter

00:07:00.279 --> 00:07:04.959
number three, that office, the pastor.

00:07:04.959 --> 00:07:10.720
And so we find that here in verses one and two, he first deals with instruction with

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:17.160
regard to the elder and emphasis is placed, notice in verse number one, rebuke not an

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:22.559
elder, but entreat him as a father.

00:07:22.559 --> 00:07:27.799
In verse number two, the elder women as mothers.

00:07:27.799 --> 00:07:34.040
So we find that Paul is giving this instruction to Timothy with regard to how he is to interact

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:39.959
with those within the congregation and not only how he is to interact, but then setting

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:44.799
forth the pattern for how each member is to interact one with another.

00:07:44.799 --> 00:07:48.799
We find that there's an emphasis placed in verse one and two when we talk about the instruction

00:07:48.799 --> 00:07:55.760
regarding the elder or the elderly, that there's an emphasis placed on honoring and respecting

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:58.640
the elder men and the elder women.

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:05.679
He says this, notice what he uses as an example, he says in verse number one, as a father.

00:08:05.679 --> 00:08:09.160
He says in verse number two, as mothers.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:14.760
You think about that relationship that we understand physically in our immediate families

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:20.440
and you find that the application is being made within the context of a church family

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:26.480
and understanding that there are churches, and really a church should have representation

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.799
in each age bracket.

00:08:28.799 --> 00:08:33.919
A church that only has senior saints is a church that's dying, a church that needs to

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:39.039
be revitalized, a church that needs to reach a next generation, and you have a church that

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:43.799
has elderly, you have a church that has younger, and everywhere in between, and if you're not

00:08:43.799 --> 00:08:47.479
sure where you fit, you just kind of pick a category, you say I'm not ready to be a

00:08:47.479 --> 00:08:51.840
senior saint, ask your spouse or ask somebody else that you trust and they'll let you know

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.760
if you're a senior saint or not.

00:08:53.760 --> 00:09:00.080
But the reality is that there's an emphasis placed on honoring and respecting.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:07.359
That's important for us to understand, especially within the shift that's taking place today,

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:11.239
culturally speaking, within our nation.

00:09:11.239 --> 00:09:17.880
Culturally speaking, there is a shift that is taking place in America with regard to,

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:25.679
and I'm speaking in general terms, with regard to how we interact with the elderly.

00:09:25.679 --> 00:09:33.039
It's a sad thing when it's as if a younger generation lives and acts as if they do not

00:09:33.039 --> 00:09:36.520
need the older generation.

00:09:36.679 --> 00:09:42.400
And we find that the importance within, and bringing it back into the context of the scripture

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:49.799
and dealing with the church, there's opportunity to glean from the experience and wisdom of

00:09:49.799 --> 00:09:52.239
those that have gone before us.

00:09:52.239 --> 00:09:54.719
It's an opportunity that we have to learn.

00:09:54.719 --> 00:09:59.960
I have men, personally, that are pastors of churches that are...

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:04.120
that exceed my age, that some of them have pastored

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:07.040
the church that they pastor longer than I've been alive,

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.600
and those are men that I will counsel with,

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:12.560
those are men that I like to get into their presence

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:14.700
and to have conversation with, why?

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:17.920
Because I can learn something from them.

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:22.560
They have experienced the many times that I've not yet had,

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:25.040
and I have the opportunity to glean from,

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:28.360
to learn from their experiences.

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:32.220
I'm now getting to the place and being at that age

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.640
where I'm kinda shifting a little bit,

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:37.600
where I have younger folks that come to me

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:39.840
that are just new in the ministry, starting a church,

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.880
and they say, hey, you've been pastoring now

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:45.120
for this number of years, and I got some questions for you.

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.760
Have you experienced this?

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:49.620
And I begin to hear the questions, and I see, Tim,

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:53.540
that I'm changing from one category to another category,

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:56.560
but the reality is that's life, that's how it works.

00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:01.160
It's a troubling thing when you find, and no doubt,

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:04.460
you've seen it in the news over the last several years,

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:09.300
where there are elderly people that are targeted for crimes.

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:12.440
It breaks my heart when I see those things,

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:17.440
because there used to be an understanding culturally,

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:21.200
even without the church on the outside,

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:25.300
just culturally speaking, there was a respect

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:26.540
for the elderly.

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:30.500
There are still today in some cultures,

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:33.700
and especially if you were to study the Asian culture,

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:36.420
it's extremely prevalent within their culture

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:39.180
of respect for the elderly.

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:42.000
They are extremely careful.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.740
I've spoken with many that have ministered

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:48.420
in that particular context, and it's amazing

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:52.100
of the way in which they teach the young people,

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:54.660
and it's really just driven into them

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:58.700
on that responsibility to have the honor

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:01.140
and respect for the elderly.

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:05.380
So when Paul is writing to Timothy, he says to him,

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:07.980
look, within the church, you're gonna have

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:11.860
some elderly people, and that's a good thing,

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:15.620
that's appropriate, a healthy church is going to be made up

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:20.060
of a diversity of those age brackets, if you will,

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:21.740
but he says, here's how you handle,

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:24.780
here's how you interact with, you entreat him,

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:28.380
meaning the elderly men, as a father,

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:33.300
and then for the elderly women as mothers.

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:36.820
What a great picture that we find that God gives

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:39.700
for the church and how they're to function.

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:42.220
He then deals with, again, in verses one and two,

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:43.940
regarding not only the elderly,

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:47.580
but he gives instruction regarding the younger.

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:49.180
Notice in verse number one, he says,

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:51.260
rebuke not an elder, but entreat him as a father,

00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:55.060
and then he says this, and the younger men as brethren.

00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:58.820
In verse number two, the elder women as mothers,

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:03.580
the younger as sisters with all purity.

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:06.500
And so as we begin to understand the interaction

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:10.420
that Timothy would have with the younger men and women

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:13.340
in the church, that he's to interact with them

00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:16.340
as a brother or as a sister.

00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:18.700
We find that we often will use that phraseology

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:21.220
that we're brothers and sisters in Christ.

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:23.420
What a blessing to have that relationship,

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:24.900
that bond, if you will.

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:29.020
And we find that he gives this picture

00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:32.820
for us to understand that bond that is there,

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:36.140
the relationships between the pastor and the members,

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:37.900
but then for member to member

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:40.020
and how they're to interact one with another.

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:42.140
And he talks about these relationships.

00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:44.540
We would understand that they're to be appropriate

00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:45.540
and they're to be pure.

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:47.220
He says at the end of verse number two,

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:50.980
with all purity, the importance of appropriateness

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:53.180
and purity, I think about a brother.

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:55.380
I only have a, physically speaking,

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:56.940
I only have one brother.

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:01.620
And you think about brothers and the bond.

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:04.140
And you may not have a good relationship

00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:04.980
with your brother.

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:07.220
I'll just speak of my relationship with my brother.

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:08.740
I have a good relationship with my brother.

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:10.300
I got to see him this past weekend

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:12.580
as his daughter graduated from high school

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:14.740
and what a blessing to be able to see him.

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:16.700
And we have that bond.

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:19.300
Did we always get along all of the time?

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:20.580
No, if you have a brother,

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:22.260
you know there are times that you disagreed

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:23.620
and you had some kind of,

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:24.540
but you know there was something

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:25.900
that was interesting about that.

00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:28.860
Though my brother and I could have a disagreement,

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:30.220
we were on the same team.

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:34.900
We were unified and if someone else were to step in,

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:37.380
no, sorry, that's not how it works.

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:38.460
There was a bond.

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:43.020
A brother is born for adversity.

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:44.780
And that doesn't mean that a brother is born

00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:46.300
so you can fight with them.

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:48.260
It means that your brother is your brother

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:49.900
and when there's adversity that comes,

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.860
it means that you have that relationship.

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:55.940
God did not allow me to have a sister,

00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:57.980
but I have two daughters and we have a son

00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:00.780
and so I get to see in their relationships

00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:04.260
and their interactions some of how that works.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.580
And you know, though God didn't allow me

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:09.380
to have any sisters, just having one brother,

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:12.700
I do understand through seeing other relationships

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:16.020
and other families that oftentimes a brother

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:19.300
has a protective spirit about a sister.

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:23.260
A protective spirit about a sister.

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:24.460
Why?

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:25.900
Because it's his sister.

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:29.060
Joseph is the youngest of our children,

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:31.020
but even as the youngest of our children

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:32.420
having two older sisters, you know,

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:36.700
Joseph, he wants to protect his sisters as much as he can.

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:40.660
And it's just, we didn't have to teach him that.

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:43.100
It's just kind of a natural thing

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:44.940
that he always loved them telling him.

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:46.540
We used to joke that he had three moms

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:48.140
and you know, that kind of thing,

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:50.540
being the youngest boy and what have you.

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:54.340
But the reality is that he wanted to protect his sisters.

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:57.860
And I begin to think about the physical relationships,

00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:01.200
family relationships that we have one with another

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:04.860
and how God gives us this picture in verses one and two

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:06.820
and you begin to think about the way

00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:11.340
that the family of God is to interact one with another.

00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:13.260
You know, we find that in the scriptures,

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:14.880
the church at Corinth is an example,

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:16.420
of course a negative example,

00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:19.780
of a church that was having great difficulties,

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:22.020
a church that had divisions and contentions,

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:23.420
a church that was carnal,

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:25.020
that could not receive all

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:26.900
that Paul wanted to instruct them with

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:29.220
because they were carnal.

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:33.760
They had those divisions and those contentions

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:36.900
and that is not God's plan for a local church.

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:38.220
God's plan for a local church

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:40.620
is that they would operate as a family.

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:42.380
He uses the term in the book of 1 Corinthians

00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:45.440
that we're a body of the body of Christ,

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:47.960
a body that is fitly framed together,

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:51.200
a body that is to weep with those that weep,

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:53.040
to rejoice with those that rejoice.

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:53.880
Why?

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:55.160
Because we're a family.

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:56.640
What a blessing.

00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:59.280
And here he gives this admonition to Timothy

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:01.360
with regard to the relationship

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:04.320
between him and the church family,

00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:07.120
the elderly and the younger.

00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:09.480
As we look, and I mentioned already by way of introduction,

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:11.040
beginning in verse number three,

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:13.120
he now turns the attention

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:15.300
not only to the elderly and to the younger,

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.080
but now instruction regarding the widows.

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:19.380
In verses three through 16,

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:22.100
we see that this instruction is provided

00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:23.780
and the situation of emphasis

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:27.040
was obviously one where there were many widows.

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:30.340
The church was in need of direction.

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:31.300
Why do I say that?

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:32.860
Well, because God gave it.

00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:37.020
The church was in need of how do we handle this circumstance?

00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:39.020
How do we handle this situation?

00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:40.340
I think about Moses

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:42.540
when he was leading the children of Israel,

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:44.380
there were times in which Moses

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:46.140
was leading the children of Israel

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:48.660
and he just simply did not know what to do.

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:51.040
There had not been instruction that had been provided

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:54.220
with dealing with a particular circumstance or situation.

00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:55.900
And you know what Moses did?

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:57.780
He said, let us ask the Lord.

00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:00.040
Let us seek the face of God.

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:03.260
Now at that point, the canon of scripture was not closed

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:05.880
and we find that God would answer the question.

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:09.900
God would give counsel and direction, instruction

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:13.580
for how to deal with that circumstance.

00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:15.140
What a great example.

00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:19.140
We now find here with Timothy ministering in Ephesus,

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:21.540
again, the canon of scripture not being closed.

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:25.180
They're dealing with this situation with having widows

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:27.860
and widows that are widows indeed.

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:30.800
The scripture uses that terminology and then younger widows

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:32.540
and how do we deal with this?

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:35.580
How do we as a local church handle this?

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:37.900
And God gives them instruction.

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:38.900
The instruction is clear.

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:40.700
The instruction is pointed.

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:43.900
We find that today that we have the opportunity

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:47.660
to go to the scriptures and to find what God says

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:52.600
with regard to these circumstances that even we may face.

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:54.460
Now it's important for us to understand

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:57.820
that in the first century, many times,

00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:02.540
if a husband was a father, a husband and father was killed

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:03.940
through whatever means it was,

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:07.880
whether it was just a sickness or an accident or so forth,

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:12.440
there was really no way, no means by which the spouse,

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:14.679
the wife, the widow in this context

00:19:14.679 --> 00:19:18.559
would be able to provide for herself.

00:19:18.559 --> 00:19:20.760
And so we find that there's instruction that's given.

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:25.160
Today across the world, there are places that have systems,

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:27.280
if you will, that are very similar

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:29.740
to what you would have found in the first century.

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:33.480
Today in America, we have various systems and things

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:36.760
where many times I think about myself

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:39.800
with regard to having a life insurance policy.

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:41.760
And I'm not here, I don't sell life insurance,

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:43.480
so don't get the wrong idea,

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:45.679
but I made a decision when we got married

00:19:45.679 --> 00:19:49.720
and we had children that I got a life insurance policy on me

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:52.880
so that if or when I die,

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:56.960
that Holly would receive some amount of finances

00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:00.119
to be able to take care of her and the children.

00:20:00.119 --> 00:20:01.119
Why?

00:20:01.119 --> 00:20:08.799
Because I felt like that was my duty, my responsibility, and so therefore I made that decision.

00:20:08.799 --> 00:20:16.399
And so every month, still to this day, I pay for a life insurance policy so that that would

00:20:16.399 --> 00:20:20.939
be taken care of, not to be a burden and what have you.

00:20:20.939 --> 00:20:25.879
And so we have different circumstances today, but we understand that the biblical truth

00:20:25.879 --> 00:20:30.459
is still appropriate and applicable, and as we seek the mind of God with regard to

00:20:30.459 --> 00:20:36.559
circumstances that we would face, we run to His word, we establish that God has the answers

00:20:36.559 --> 00:20:40.599
and the principles that we need to glean so that we can make application.

00:20:40.599 --> 00:20:48.119
So notice with me in verse number three, Paul says to Timothy, honor widows that are widows

00:20:48.119 --> 00:20:50.579
indeed.

00:20:50.579 --> 00:20:56.059
So it's interesting because he starts using that phrase right away, widows indeed, and

00:20:56.059 --> 00:20:59.979
we'll see it repeated, and then notice in verse number four, it begins with a conjunction,

00:20:59.979 --> 00:21:09.019
it says, but, but if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to show piety

00:21:09.019 --> 00:21:16.419
at home and to requite their parents, for that is good and acceptable before God.

00:21:16.419 --> 00:21:20.419
Now anytime that you find where God's word says this is good and acceptable, you ought

00:21:20.419 --> 00:21:23.139
to take note because this is what pleases the Lord.

00:21:23.139 --> 00:21:28.739
And so we find that God is giving the instruction, He says in verse number five, now she that

00:21:28.739 --> 00:21:34.599
is a widow indeed and desolate, trusteth in God and continueth in supplications and prayers

00:21:34.599 --> 00:21:40.059
night and day, but she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth, and these things

00:21:40.059 --> 00:21:45.339
give in charge that they may be blameless.

00:21:45.339 --> 00:21:49.059
But in verse number eight, if any provide not for his own, and especially for those

00:21:49.059 --> 00:21:54.179
of his own house, he hath denied the faith and is worse than an infidel.

00:21:54.179 --> 00:21:58.779
Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old, having been the wife

00:21:58.779 --> 00:22:03.859
of one man, well reported of for good works, if she have brought up children, if she have

00:22:03.859 --> 00:22:08.860
lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints' feet, if she have relieved the afflicted,

00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:15.419
if she have diligently followed every good work, but the younger widows refuse.

00:22:15.419 --> 00:22:20.459
For when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they will marry, having damnation

00:22:20.459 --> 00:22:25.299
because they have cast off their first faith, and withal they learn to be idle, wandering

00:22:25.299 --> 00:22:30.339
about from house to house, and not only idle, but tattlers also in busy bodies, speaking

00:22:30.339 --> 00:22:33.099
things which they ought not.

00:22:33.099 --> 00:22:37.940
Verse 14, I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house,

00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:42.139
give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully, for some are already turned

00:22:42.139 --> 00:22:45.019
after, turned aside after Satan.

00:22:45.019 --> 00:22:52.000
If any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:57.899
be charged that it may relieve them that are widows indeed.

00:22:57.899 --> 00:23:01.500
It's interesting as you look at verse number seven, the Bible says, and these things give

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:05.139
in charge that they may be blameless.

00:23:05.139 --> 00:23:10.659
So Timothy has the responsibility to communicate this truth so that those that are within the

00:23:10.659 --> 00:23:17.259
church, and now we find that as God's Word, this letter has been preserved in the Bible,

00:23:17.259 --> 00:23:22.739
that we can understand the mind of the Lord in dealing with these situations.

00:23:22.739 --> 00:23:24.379
So let's break it down, if you will.

00:23:24.379 --> 00:23:28.039
The first aspect, he deals with widows that are widows indeed.

00:23:28.039 --> 00:23:32.059
We see this really primarily in verses three through ten, there's a couple of verses scattered

00:23:32.059 --> 00:23:38.099
in there that deal with the younger, but notice that there is here given to us, those that

00:23:38.099 --> 00:23:43.059
are widows indeed, the primary responsibility, and now understand, this is important for

00:23:43.059 --> 00:23:50.220
us to understand, the primary responsibility for caring for a widow that is a widow indeed

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:56.019
is the immediate family, not the church, okay?

00:23:56.019 --> 00:23:57.580
That's biblical.

00:23:57.580 --> 00:24:01.699
I've had people say, oh, we have widows, man, the church should just pay them all every

00:24:01.699 --> 00:24:04.580
month a certain amount, that's not what the Bible says.

00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:09.019
If they're widows that don't have family, now all of a sudden we've gotten to deal with

00:24:09.019 --> 00:24:16.699
that, but the primary responsibility for the widow's care is the immediate family.

00:24:16.699 --> 00:24:23.100
Notice in verse number four, but if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first

00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:30.940
to show piety at home and to requite their parents, for that is good and acceptable before

00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:32.579
God.

00:24:32.579 --> 00:24:37.500
Not only do we see there in verse number four the truth with regard to the primary

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:43.540
responsibility being to the immediate family and not to the church, we find again, as Paul

00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:49.179
would summarize the entire teaching in verse number 16, he says, if any man or woman that

00:24:49.179 --> 00:24:57.059
believeth have widows, let them relieve them and let not the church be charged.

00:24:57.059 --> 00:24:59.419
Now, that's not confusing, is it?

00:24:59.419 --> 00:25:00.600
Pretty clear.

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:03.320
And it says why, why should the church not be charged?

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:09.519
Well, that it, the church may relieve them that are widows indeed.

00:25:09.519 --> 00:25:13.359
They have no family, they have no one that could care for them, and therefore it becomes

00:25:13.359 --> 00:25:16.959
the responsibility of the church.

00:25:16.959 --> 00:25:22.679
There's a warning that is given to the family members of widows in verse number eight.

00:25:22.679 --> 00:25:28.040
Notice the warning, if any provide not for his own, and especially for those of his own

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:32.239
house, he hath denied the faith and is worse than an infidel.

00:25:32.239 --> 00:25:33.919
That's strong language.

00:25:33.919 --> 00:25:38.959
We find that within the context of this passage of Scripture, many times verse eight is taken

00:25:38.959 --> 00:25:43.519
out of context and people just use it and make the application however they want, but

00:25:43.519 --> 00:25:49.119
we understand primarily within the context of this verse of Scripture is the teaching

00:25:49.119 --> 00:25:51.119
with regard to widows.

00:25:51.119 --> 00:25:57.799
And therefore, if you have a widow that's a widow indeed in your immediate family, you

00:25:57.799 --> 00:26:02.359
have a responsibility, you have a responsibility.

00:26:02.359 --> 00:26:07.639
And we find that that responsibility, that warning is given in verse number eight.

00:26:07.639 --> 00:26:12.760
It's not something that you just simply say, well, I'm going to let somebody else have

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:13.760
that responsibility.

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:16.040
No, it's your responsibility.

00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:22.160
We find that the criteria is laid forth, the qualifications, if you will, for assistance.

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:28.279
Notice in verse number five, now she that is a widow indeed and desolate trusteth in

00:26:28.279 --> 00:26:33.320
God and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day.

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:39.440
This one that is being referred to in verse number five, that now there's no family, there's

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:43.839
no immediate family, and there's the need for the church, there's some criteria that

00:26:43.839 --> 00:26:44.839
is given.

00:26:44.839 --> 00:26:51.040
Notice in verse number one, excuse me, verse number nine, let not a widow be taken into

00:26:51.199 --> 00:26:56.720
the number under threescore years old, having been the wife of one man.

00:26:56.720 --> 00:27:01.639
So there's actually an age that's given in verse number nine, an age of 60 that's provided.

00:27:01.639 --> 00:27:06.479
And we find that that is given to us as we see the contrast in the teaching with regard

00:27:06.479 --> 00:27:13.239
to the younger widows and what their tendency would be, and no doubt writing from and dealing

00:27:13.239 --> 00:27:18.000
with the situation in Ephesus, not only a tendency, but probably something that had

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.199
actively taken place.

00:27:20.239 --> 00:27:24.559
So he gives an age in verse number nine and then notices that the criteria continues in

00:27:24.559 --> 00:27:30.079
verse number 10, well reported of for good works.

00:27:30.079 --> 00:27:35.479
If she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saint's

00:27:35.479 --> 00:27:41.160
feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:42.160
work.

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:46.380
And as we look at verse number 10, these are not things that are given that would make

00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:49.079
this individual a saved person.

00:27:49.079 --> 00:27:51.679
No, they're saved by the grace of God.

00:27:51.679 --> 00:27:56.399
They're saved because of what Jesus Christ did on the cross of Calvary, his death barrel

00:27:56.399 --> 00:27:57.940
and glorious resurrection.

00:27:57.940 --> 00:28:03.119
But because they were saved, this was how they were serving God.

00:28:03.119 --> 00:28:09.519
These were the works that they were doing not to be saved or to stay saved, but because

00:28:09.519 --> 00:28:11.559
of their salvation.

00:28:11.559 --> 00:28:17.720
And we find that the instruction is given with regard to, if you will, criteria or qualifications

00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:21.479
for how the church would provide that assistance.

00:28:21.479 --> 00:28:23.880
And we find that the responsibility is given.

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:29.519
I read verse 16 a moment ago, but the last part of the verse says that it may relieve,

00:28:29.519 --> 00:28:35.080
speaking about the church, them that are widows indeed.

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:37.279
So there may be a local church.

00:28:37.279 --> 00:28:41.299
The church at Ephesus was in a situation evidently where there were several widows.

00:28:41.299 --> 00:28:43.479
We have a number of widows in our church.

00:28:43.479 --> 00:28:48.599
And there may be a situation that presents itself where there's a widow that has no family,

00:28:48.599 --> 00:28:54.400
that has no ability to be able to provide for themselves, and therefore the church then

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:56.919
has a responsibility.

00:28:56.919 --> 00:29:01.400
But we find that primarily the responsibility is for the immediate family.

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:06.799
By the way, as you look at this portion of Scripture, it's not so that a church can say,

00:29:06.799 --> 00:29:09.479
well, that's not my problem or not my responsibility.

00:29:09.479 --> 00:29:14.880
It's so that this is God's Word that God gives the instruction to the church on how

00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:17.479
to handle these matters.

00:29:17.479 --> 00:29:20.320
And what a blessing to have the mind of the Lord.

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:23.960
Notice with me, he then not only deals with those that are widows indeed, but he deals

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:27.119
with younger widows, the terminology that is used.

00:29:27.119 --> 00:29:31.559
We find that in verse number five, he talked about the one that was a widow indeed in verse

00:29:31.559 --> 00:29:37.839
six, but she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth, evidently dealing with those

00:29:37.919 --> 00:29:42.760
that were widows, that were the young widows, because we find that we come back to verse

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:46.679
number 11, and it says, but the younger widows refuse.

00:29:46.679 --> 00:29:53.440
For when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they will marry.

00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:59.039
And so we find that there would be some that were widows, that were widows indeed, the

00:29:59.039 --> 00:29:59.880
older, the...

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:01.660
verse nine dealing with the age,

00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:04.720
but then verse number 11 talking about younger widows.

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:07.920
And again, with regard to the timeline,

00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:11.040
and we understand that there would be those

00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:13.600
in the category of younger and older

00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:16.440
when their spouse would die, their husband would die.

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:18.320
And so we find that here,

00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:21.820
God says in verse number 11 to refuse them.

00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:22.660
Why?

00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:24.800
Because when they wax wanton against Christ,

00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:26.000
they will marry.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.080
But not only that,

00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:29.400
notice what the Bible says in verse 13

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:33.180
with regard to the behavior, if you will,

00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:35.880
of these younger women, these younger widows

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:39.600
in contrast to what we read in verse number 10.

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:42.600
In verse number 13, the Bible says in with all,

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:45.320
they, speaking about the younger widows,

00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:49.200
they learn, notice what it says, to be idle.

00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:53.360
Wandering about from house to house,

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:58.360
and not only idle, but tattlers also in busy bodies,

00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:02.160
speaking things which they ought not.

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:05.160
And so Paul begins to address the situation.

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:08.960
Again, I believe that there were probably some experiences

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:12.560
or some circumstances that Paul had understanding

00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:14.060
of these things taking place.

00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:17.760
And it was not just a matter of this may happen,

00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:21.960
but probably this was something that had taken place.

00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:25.040
And this one that is referred to as being a younger widow,

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:27.280
not only when they wax wanton against Christ,

00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:29.840
will they marry, but they learn to be idle.

00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:32.520
And then it goes downhill from there.

00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:34.640
They're wandering about from house to house

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:38.560
and not only idle, but tattlers in busy bodies.

00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:41.940
The Bible says this, speaking things which they ought not.

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:46.360
That's not a compliment in verse number 13.

00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:49.960
It's an indictment against behavior that's not appropriate,

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:53.280
not behavior that's pleasing to God.

00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:56.560
You think about the idea of being idle

00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:59.280
and being busy bodies and speaking things

00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:00.600
which they ought not.

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:03.520
Let me say this, this morning by way of application,

00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:07.240
it doesn't just have to be a young widow

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:10.240
that gets involved in this kind of inappropriate behavior.

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:13.320
Amen, it doesn't have to even be a widow.

00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:15.440
It doesn't even have to be a lady.

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:19.240
Amen, sometimes all people,

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:21.600
regardless of their marital status,

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:23.860
regardless of their age,

00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:27.340
can be guilty of being busy bodies.

00:32:28.559 --> 00:32:30.840
We find, we've been studying on Sunday night,

00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:32.620
excuse me, on Wednesday night,

00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:34.320
through 1 and 2 Thessalonians,

00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:36.860
walk worthy and please God.

00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:39.620
In verse number 11 of 2 Thessalonians 3,

00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:41.419
the Bible says, for we hear that there are some

00:32:41.419 --> 00:32:43.200
which walk among you disorderly,

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:46.559
working not at all, but are busy bodies.

00:32:46.559 --> 00:32:50.380
And we find here, listen, it's not just a marital status

00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:53.900
or an age relation that determines every person,

00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:56.059
regardless of those criteria,

00:32:56.059 --> 00:32:59.100
can be guilty of being a busy body.

00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:01.660
Speaking, as it says at the end of verse number 13,

00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:04.419
things which they ought not.

00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:10.139
Sometimes we refer to it as having a filter.

00:33:10.139 --> 00:33:12.900
You ever meet somebody that seems like they have no filter?

00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:14.320
And what do we mean by that?

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:15.740
Well, they just speak.

00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:18.180
They speak and they speak and they speak.

00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:20.180
Sometimes they say things that they ought not say.

00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:21.700
They get involved in areas

00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:23.059
where they ought not get involved.

00:33:24.139 --> 00:33:25.220
You ever said something, you say, man,

00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:28.020
I wish I had not said that, it's already been said.

00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:29.860
We need to be careful about this situation

00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:31.900
because what can happen is we can become,

00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:33.740
if we're not careful, again,

00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:37.600
without regard to marital status or age,

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:41.460
you can become a busy body getting yourself involved

00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:44.220
in areas where you ought not get involved.

00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:47.260
And you hear that word about being a gossip.

00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:48.660
Now I understand how it works typically

00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:49.860
in a church setting.

00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:52.540
It's not really gossip, it's just a prayer request.

00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:54.120
I understand how it works.

00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:57.419
But sometimes you fool yourself

00:33:57.419 --> 00:33:59.080
more than you fool somebody else.

00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:02.500
You fool yourself more than you fool somebody else.

00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:03.700
Hey, I got a prayer request for you,

00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:04.779
but really I just want to gossip.

00:34:04.779 --> 00:34:05.860
I want to tell you what I found out.

00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:07.820
Let me tell you, did you hear what happened?

00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:10.620
Oh, would you please pray for them?

00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:13.040
Listen, be careful, be careful.

00:34:13.919 --> 00:34:15.899
This is not pleasing to God.

00:34:15.899 --> 00:34:18.100
And we understand again within the context

00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:22.420
He's dealing with the younger widows,

00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:26.660
but the reality is that any of us could be guilty

00:34:26.660 --> 00:34:30.820
of speaking about things which we ought not,

00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:35.420
becoming tattlers and busy bodies.

00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:37.540
Let me say this.

00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:40.660
They didn't have social media back then like we do today.

00:34:42.179 --> 00:34:43.020
Amen?

00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:46.220
They went, according to verse number 13,

00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:48.300
from house to house.

00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:49.860
You know what people do today on social media?

00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:51.220
They don't have to leave and leave anywhere.

00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:53.420
They just sit there and they just,

00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:54.980
I don't have social media.

00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:58.660
Sometimes I wish I did, but most times I'm glad I don't.

00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:00.540
The times that I wish I did is when I hear

00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:02.140
about a good article or something

00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:03.300
that a preacher friend wrote

00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:04.580
and I didn't have an opportunity to see it

00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:07.260
because I don't have the social media, what have you.

00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:08.459
And sometimes I'll ask somebody,

00:35:08.459 --> 00:35:11.179
hey, can you just email it to me, whatever.

00:35:11.179 --> 00:35:13.739
But most times I'm happy I don't have social media.

00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:15.739
And here's the problem.

00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:17.700
You can sit around and you can be guilty

00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:20.220
of being tattlers and busy bodies

00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:22.459
and speaking the things that you ought not speak

00:35:22.459 --> 00:35:24.420
because you're sitting behind a screen somewhere

00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:27.500
on a phone or a device of some nature.

00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:30.059
Be careful, be careful.

00:35:31.739 --> 00:35:35.260
We continue and we look here at a pattern

00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:39.540
that God establishes as Paul gives this instruction

00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:43.420
with regard to those that are the younger widows.

00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:45.500
He speaks about those that are widows indeed,

00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:48.860
the older, and he talks about their testimony

00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:50.059
and their behavior.

00:35:50.059 --> 00:35:52.779
But he talks about these younger and he says refuse them

00:35:52.779 --> 00:35:56.739
because here's the likelihood of what they will do

00:35:56.739 --> 00:35:59.059
and here's perhaps what some have already done

00:35:59.059 --> 00:36:02.140
and participated in and we find that he gives us

00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:06.300
in verse number 14, excuse me, a pattern to be established.

00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:10.899
He says, I will therefore that the younger women marry,

00:36:10.899 --> 00:36:13.300
bear children, guide the house,

00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:17.380
give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully.

00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:19.220
Now, I understand again that this is not

00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:22.020
a culturally popular verse of scripture

00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:25.420
with regard to the roles, if you will,

00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:28.860
but we understand that Paul is establishing a pattern

00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:29.700
and I'm thankful.

00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:32.619
We started a few weeks ago a Sunday school class,

00:36:32.619 --> 00:36:33.660
a marriage Sunday school class.

00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:34.899
I'm thankful for marriage.

00:36:34.899 --> 00:36:37.700
I'm thankful that God instituted marriage.

00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:40.100
I'm thankful, I remember reading the verse,

00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:41.619
when I first, after I got saved,

00:36:41.619 --> 00:36:43.540
whoso findeth a wife, findeth a good thing

00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:45.580
and obtain the favor of the Lord, amen.

00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:47.220
And I'm glad for Holly.

00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:51.459
I'm glad that God allowed me the opportunity to be married

00:36:51.459 --> 00:36:54.059
and that we'll be celebrating our 23rd wedding anniversary

00:36:54.059 --> 00:36:54.899
this year.

00:36:54.899 --> 00:36:56.820
What a blessing, I am blessed.

00:36:57.860 --> 00:37:00.239
We understand that there are some that will not be married,

00:37:00.239 --> 00:37:01.820
but we find here, Paul deals with that

00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:03.600
in 1 Corinthians chapter seven,

00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:05.459
but we find that here in verse number 14,

00:37:05.459 --> 00:37:07.899
he's laying forth this pattern

00:37:07.899 --> 00:37:09.020
and he talks about being married,

00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:11.220
he talks about bearing children.

00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:12.820
I spoke about this on Mother's Day.

00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:15.459
We're living in a time today where people,

00:37:15.459 --> 00:37:18.179
unfortunately, especially in our society in America,

00:37:18.179 --> 00:37:20.619
they're viewing children as being a burden

00:37:20.619 --> 00:37:22.260
and not a blessing.

00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:24.380
What a sad situation that is,

00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:26.020
because the Bible says that the fruit of the womb

00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:27.559
is his reward.

00:37:27.559 --> 00:37:30.339
Children are an heritage of the Lord.

00:37:30.339 --> 00:37:33.339
And we find that there are some that have that idea.

00:37:33.339 --> 00:37:35.660
Children, why do they look at them as being a burden?

00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:37.179
Well, they get in way of their career,

00:37:37.179 --> 00:37:38.779
they get in way of their ambitions

00:37:38.779 --> 00:37:41.300
and their bucket list of where they wanna go

00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:43.700
and what they wanna do and all of this type of thing,

00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:46.779
but Paul lays forth this pattern.

00:37:46.779 --> 00:37:51.779
He says, not only would they have opportunity

00:37:51.899 --> 00:37:54.600
to marry and to bear children,

00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:57.300
but this says guide the house.

00:37:57.300 --> 00:38:00.260
What a blessing to think about the ministry

00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:04.260
of a wife and a mother within the parameters here

00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:07.899
that we find of giving this guidance to the house.

00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:10.660
And having the opportunity,

00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:12.580
yes, the husband is to be the head,

00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:14.660
and we understand that as we look at Ephesians

00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:16.580
and you look at Colossians

00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:19.420
and you understand the pattern that God has set forth,

00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:22.860
but what a privilege for ladies,

00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:24.779
if they're married and have children,

00:38:24.779 --> 00:38:26.140
to give that guidance,

00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:29.679
to invest in the fulfillment that is there.

00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:34.299
Ends this verse by saying,

00:38:34.299 --> 00:38:37.419
not only to marry, bear children and guide the house,

00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:40.419
but give none occasion to the adversary

00:38:40.419 --> 00:38:42.140
to speak reproachfully.

00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:44.460
You know, the devil, the adversary,

00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:47.220
you know that he hates everything that God is for

00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:49.220
and that God loves.

00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:50.580
God hates the church.

00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:52.799
Or excuse me, sorry, let me rephrase that.

00:38:52.799 --> 00:38:54.140
Satan hates the church.

00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:54.979
Why?

00:38:54.979 --> 00:38:58.140
Because God loves the church and gave himself for it.

00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:00.220
The church is the bride of Christ.

00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:01.260
Amen?

00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:03.340
We find that Satan hates the church,

00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:06.220
but Satan hates the family.

00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:08.020
The family is under attack today.

00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:10.859
The family is under attack today.

00:39:10.859 --> 00:39:13.880
We see it all over in our society.

00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:14.720
Why?

00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:16.660
Because the enemy hates the family.

00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:21.739
Because God is the one that established the family.

00:39:21.739 --> 00:39:25.260
And so it says here that none occasion

00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:27.220
to the adversary to speak reproachfully,

00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:29.260
that they're in a situation

00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:32.039
where they're not putting themselves in a position

00:39:32.039 --> 00:39:34.799
where they're going to give place to the devil,

00:39:34.799 --> 00:39:36.559
that they're going to speak reproachfully,

00:39:36.559 --> 00:39:39.039
as we saw earlier in verse number 13

00:39:39.039 --> 00:39:41.200
with regard to the behavior that is established.

00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:44.160
No, they're too busy to be dealing with that stuff.

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:46.960
They're focused on their home

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:48.359
and they're focused on their children

00:39:48.359 --> 00:39:49.239
and they're doing those things.

00:39:49.239 --> 00:39:51.599
They don't have time to get involved

00:39:51.599 --> 00:39:53.559
with all these other things.

00:39:53.559 --> 00:39:58.559
It's amazing to me how many times I hear people say,

00:39:58.559 --> 00:40:02.239
And this is a general statement, it's not about anyone specific in our church, though

00:40:02.239 --> 00:40:10.179
we've all been guilty of saying it, I just don't have time to do X, Y, or Z.

00:40:10.179 --> 00:40:14.059
But yet, they spend how many hours a week on social media, they spend how many hours

00:40:14.059 --> 00:40:22.419
a week watching this stuff and doing this thing, and it's how we steward our time.

00:40:22.419 --> 00:40:24.739
I hear people say, I've got to make time for that.

00:40:24.739 --> 00:40:27.499
I tell people all the time, you can't make time.

00:40:27.499 --> 00:40:28.939
You can't make time.

00:40:28.939 --> 00:40:32.159
All you can do is steward time.

00:40:32.159 --> 00:40:39.339
Because you have a certain number of hours every day, and how you steward those hours,

00:40:39.339 --> 00:40:40.339
you can't make more.

00:40:40.339 --> 00:40:44.239
So man, if I just had more time, you've got to steward it wisely.

00:40:44.239 --> 00:40:45.859
Steward time.

00:40:45.859 --> 00:40:51.059
And so they would not have the time to get involved in the behavior that is outlined

00:40:51.059 --> 00:40:56.379
in verse number 13 because they're doing that which is outlined in verse number 14, and

00:40:56.379 --> 00:41:01.899
they're not giving any occasion to the adversary to be involved in that behavior.

00:41:01.899 --> 00:41:06.360
He says this in verse 15, and this is why we believe, and I said earlier, that some

00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:09.479
have already been doing these things because it says in verse 15, for some are already

00:41:09.479 --> 00:41:12.540
turned aside after Satan.

00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:16.579
There were some that were widows that were already behaving in this manner that was not

00:41:16.579 --> 00:41:18.099
pleasing to the Lord.

00:41:18.099 --> 00:41:24.139
And so we find that he ends the whole conversation, the whole instruction in verse 16, if any man

00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:29.500
or woman that believeth have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be charged

00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:34.259
that it may relieve them that are widows indeed.

00:41:34.259 --> 00:41:38.339
As we look at the first 16 verses of 1 Timothy chapter 5, you see it passes as an unusual

00:41:38.339 --> 00:41:40.139
message for a Sunday morning.

00:41:40.139 --> 00:41:44.479
It's a lot different than last week's message on Sunday morning.

00:41:44.479 --> 00:41:48.939
But the reality is that God gives us instruction for a reason.

00:41:48.939 --> 00:41:52.779
The Bible says in 2 Timothy chapter number 3, a verse that we often reference, that all

00:41:52.779 --> 00:41:56.939
Scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof,

00:41:56.939 --> 00:42:01.180
for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be perfect, throughly

00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:03.500
furnished unto all good works.

00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:06.199
So we have God's instruction.

00:42:06.199 --> 00:42:09.899
It is not for us to sit around and say, well, what do you think we should do about this

00:42:09.899 --> 00:42:10.899
situation?

00:42:10.899 --> 00:42:15.559
Hey, I think we should, no, we need to go to God's Word and we need to find out what

00:42:15.559 --> 00:42:20.739
did God set forth as the instruction that we as His people are to follow.

00:42:20.739 --> 00:42:22.660
You say, well, I don't like that very much.

00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:26.300
Well, you better change your perspective because I can assure you that God's not going to change

00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:27.300
His Word.

00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:28.300
Amen?

00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:29.979
You say, I just don't like that.

00:42:29.979 --> 00:42:32.419
Well, you better change because God's not changing.

00:42:32.419 --> 00:42:34.539
He was the same yesterday, today, and forever.

00:42:34.539 --> 00:42:35.539
Amen?

00:42:35.539 --> 00:42:37.660
He said, I'm the Lord, I change not.

00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:43.239
And so what happens is we live in culture, we live in society that if we're not careful,

00:42:43.239 --> 00:42:51.360
we develop our thought process based upon the ideas of the world as opposed to the

00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:53.679
truth of God's Word.

00:42:53.679 --> 00:42:58.720
It is imperative that even as we look at a passage of Scripture like 1 Timothy chapter

00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:03.319
5, verses 1 through 16, we say, why do we focus on this?

00:43:03.319 --> 00:43:10.559
Well, because God's church is made up of people, and the people that make up a church are to

00:43:10.559 --> 00:43:16.919
interact one with another in a manner that is appropriate, that is God-honoring.

00:43:16.919 --> 00:43:24.720
That we have the opportunity as a church family to show by our interactions one with another

00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:26.520
the love of Christ.

00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:28.080
That we get to set forth a pattern.

00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:33.119
You know, what a terrible thing when a church has a testimony in a community that, man,

00:43:33.119 --> 00:43:36.759
all they do is fight and argue down there, there's always problems down there, I'd never

00:43:36.759 --> 00:43:38.399
go to that church.

00:43:38.399 --> 00:43:39.839
I've heard people say that.

00:43:40.479 --> 00:43:42.959
That's a terrible testimony.

00:43:42.959 --> 00:43:45.559
That's not what God's plan is.

00:43:45.559 --> 00:43:51.399
So God gives to Timothy and then gives to all of us by way of preservation instruction

00:43:51.399 --> 00:43:54.000
for relationships within the church.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.800
Did God know that there were going to be some elderly people in the church?

00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:57.800
Absolutely.

00:43:57.800 --> 00:43:59.360
Did He know there were going to be some younger people in the church?

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:00.360
Absolutely.

00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:01.360
So He says, here's how you interact.

00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:04.119
Did He know there'd be some widows?

00:44:04.119 --> 00:44:06.399
Some widows that are widows indeed, some that are younger?

00:44:06.399 --> 00:44:07.399
Yes, God knew.

00:44:07.399 --> 00:44:11.119
So God gives instruction.

00:44:11.119 --> 00:44:14.239
We have a wonderful book here, the Bible.

00:44:14.239 --> 00:44:19.919
And in this book, God has given us the instruction for every situation we'll ever face.

00:44:19.919 --> 00:44:23.760
You say, well, I have this circumstance and I don't have…

00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:26.480
Sometimes you've got to dig a little deeper.

00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:31.519
Sometimes the answer isn't as surface ready as this one is in 1 Timothy chapter 5.

00:44:31.519 --> 00:44:35.440
Sometimes you've got to dig in, be students of the Word.

00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:39.119
But you run to God and you run to His Word and say, how do we behave?

00:44:39.119 --> 00:44:40.119
How do we interact?

00:44:40.119 --> 00:44:41.119
Hey, there's a widow.

00:44:41.119 --> 00:44:42.119
What do we do?

00:44:42.119 --> 00:44:43.119
Do we just…

00:44:43.119 --> 00:44:49.720
No, let's run to the Bible and find out what God says and let's follow God's pattern

00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:55.440
because that's going to bring honor and glory to God and result in His blessing and

00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:56.440
His favor.

00:44:56.440 --> 00:45:01.600
And we want God's blessing, we want God's favor individually, but also corporately as

00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:04.760
a church we want God's blessing and God's favor.

00:45:05.079 --> 00:45:06.079
Let's pray together.

00:45:06.079 --> 00:45:07.079
Father, we love You.

00:45:07.079 --> 00:45:08.079
We thank You for loving us.

00:45:08.079 --> 00:45:11.480
We thank You for the privilege that You've given us to gather today.

00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:15.600
And Lord, though this text of Scripture and this message is a little different for a Sunday

00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:20.200
morning, we thank You that You've given us the instruction.

00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:29.160
And God, we thank You that when we face circumstances in life, when we face questions and scenarios

00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:34.720
that we do not have to just rely on our own understanding, no, we can run to Your Word

00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:41.200
and we can receive Your instruction and we're thankful for the clarity that You've provided.

00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:45.919
And God, I pray that You would help us to determine even in a message like this that

00:45:45.919 --> 00:45:50.059
we're going to be biblical, we're going to be scriptural.

00:45:50.059 --> 00:45:55.959
That as we deal with circumstances and relationships in a church that we're going to seek the

00:45:55.959 --> 00:46:01.079
mind of Christ, that we're going to apply the truth of Your Word in our interactions.

00:46:01.079 --> 00:46:07.200
Father, I pray that if there's one here that's not sure of heaven, God, we pray that they'd

00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:11.480
be saved today, that they understand that, God, You love them.

00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:14.639
You love them so much that You sent Your Son to die for them.

00:46:14.639 --> 00:46:20.359
The Lord Jesus Christ came here, God in flesh, to the sin-cursed world, lived a perfect sinless

00:46:20.359 --> 00:46:25.480
life, went to a cruel cross, bled and died, buried, but rose conquering sin, death, and

00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:26.480
the grave.

00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:31.000
He did all of that so that we might be forgiven.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:36.519
God, if there's one that's not sure of heaven, they've never trusted the Lord Jesus Christ

00:46:36.519 --> 00:46:41.200
as their personal Savior, I pray the Holy Spirit of God would convict them this morning,

00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:46.399
convince them of their sin and of Christ's righteousness and of judgment to come.

00:46:46.399 --> 00:46:52.119
I pray for every child of God, Lord, would You help us to determine this morning that

00:46:52.119 --> 00:46:59.119
we will be doers of the Word, that we will think and behave biblically, scripturally.

00:46:59.119 --> 00:47:02.799
In this moment of invitation, we pray that You'd have Your will in way.

00:47:02.799 --> 00:47:03.799
We'll thank You for it.

00:47:03.799 --> 00:47:04.919
In Christ's name we pray.
