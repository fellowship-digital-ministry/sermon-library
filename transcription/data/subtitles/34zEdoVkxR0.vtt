00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.599
Job chapter number 16, and I'll be looking at verses 1-5, Job 16, verses 1-5 this evening.

00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:13.600
And as we look at this particular portion of Scripture, we'll find that Job is responding.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:20.559
He's answering one of the friends, Eliphaz, his speech, and he's giving an answer, Job

00:00:20.559 --> 00:00:21.559
is.

00:00:21.559 --> 00:00:26.319
We understand that the book of Job begins by recording the trials of Job.

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:32.319
When you read the first and second chapters of the book of Job, you find that there was

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:39.520
just much that transpired in a very quick matter of time in the life of Job.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:45.119
And we're told in Job chapter number 2, in verse number 11, that he had some friends

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:51.939
that heard about his troubles, and these friends determined that after hearing of the situation

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:53.919
that they were going to come.

00:00:53.919 --> 00:00:59.979
And in Job 2, in verse number 11, they have a two-fold purpose for them coming to where

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:06.180
Job is, and it was one, to mourn with him, and two, to comfort him.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.620
And so that was their stated purpose, according to Job 2, in verse number 11.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.739
They heard about his situation, they heard of all that was transpired, or had transpired,

00:01:15.739 --> 00:01:19.620
and they said, we're going to go to our friend, and we're going to mourn with him, and we're

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.059
going to comfort him.

00:01:22.059 --> 00:01:26.639
The passage of Scripture that is before us this evening, as I mentioned, Job is responding

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:31.559
to Eliphaz, and in fact, one of the most—I shouldn't say the most familiar—but one

00:01:31.559 --> 00:01:36.599
of the well-known verses of the book of Job is found within our text this evening.

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:41.680
Many times we're familiar with that phrase, when Job declares, miserable comforters are

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.220
ye all, and that's Job 16, in verse number 2.

00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:50.319
When we find that Job is responding, notice in verse number 1,

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:05.080
Now that's kind of a bad deal if they came with the stated purpose of one, mourning with

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:11.360
him, and two, comforting him, and Job says, miserable comforters are ye all, right?

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.820
That was their purpose, that was their aim, that was their goal, to go and to comfort

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.580
this man, and Job says, you're miserable comforters.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:21.580
Verse 3,

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:27.919
Now vain words have an end, or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest?

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:35.699
I also could speak as ye do, if your soul were in my soul's stead, I could heap up words

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:41.580
against you, and shake mine head at you.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.580
Notice the conjunction that begins verse number 5.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:55.580
But I, I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips should assuage your

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:56.580
grief.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.580
I want to share a thought with you this evening.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:06.580
I've titled the message from verse number 5, I would strengthen you with my mouth.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.539
I would strengthen you with my mouth.

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:15.539
These verses of Scripture really provide for us a contrast between the words of these

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:19.020
friends and the words of Job.

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.380
We of course understand that our words have much power.

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:30.139
In fact, the wise man notes in Proverbs 18 and verse number 21, death and life are in

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:32.820
the power of the tongue.

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:40.100
That's Proverbs 18, 21a, the first part of the verse, death and life are in the power

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.779
of the tongue.

00:03:41.779 --> 00:03:48.380
And we understand that the word of God has much to say about our words, and we understand

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:54.539
if you are taking notes, number one this evening, just simply consider the impact of our words.

00:03:54.539 --> 00:04:00.899
In verses 2 through 4, Job as he's responding to these men, these friends that came, again

00:04:00.899 --> 00:04:07.539
with the expressed purpose, the stated purpose of mourning with him and comforting him, according

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:12.740
to what we read in Job 2 and verse number 11, we find that instead of them comforting

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:18.440
him, instead of their words being used to help him, rather they hurt him.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.660
And the Bible says that Job as he's responding and answering Eliphaz here, it says, I have

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.579
heard many such things.

00:04:26.579 --> 00:04:32.339
Notice how he refers to it in verse number 3, shall vain words have an end?

00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:36.500
Or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest?

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.500
He says, I could speak as ye do.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.820
If you were in the same position that I am in, if your soul were in my soul's stead,

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:51.019
and you think about the heaviness of Job after all that he experienced in Job 1 and 2 and

00:04:51.019 --> 00:04:57.179
all that had transpired, he says, I could heap up words against you and shake mine head

00:04:57.179 --> 00:04:58.179
at you.

00:04:58.179 --> 00:04:59.179
See, that's what they were doing.

00:04:59.179 --> 00:05:03.540
They were speaking, they were heaping up these words against Job.

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:10.140
Notice, maybe on the same page of your Bible, but in chapter 19, look at verse number 2,

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.420
look at what Job says.

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:17.859
In Job 19, Job is not responding to Eliphaz, he's not responding to Bildad.

00:05:17.859 --> 00:05:22.500
And we find that Bildad then gives his speech, and they're just kind of going back and forth,

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.019
and one of these friends will give a speech, and then Job will reply, and then another

00:05:26.019 --> 00:05:30.640
friend will give a speech, and then Job will reply, and that's the main part of the book

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:36.200
of Job as far as chapters 3 through almost the end of the book, you see this back and

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:42.959
forth dialogue that's taking place, but here, as Job would answer Bildad in Job 19, notice

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:52.320
what he says in verse number 2, how long will you vex my soul and break me in pieces, how?

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.160
With words.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.899
With words.

00:05:55.899 --> 00:05:59.239
He says, how long are you going to notice what they're doing?

00:05:59.239 --> 00:06:03.760
Vex my soul and break me in pieces.

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:10.239
Now, it's interesting as we think about the impact of our words, and we think about these

00:06:10.239 --> 00:06:14.839
friends, and back in Job chapter number 2, I mean, they had a good purpose, they had

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:19.679
a good reason for coming to Job, but we find that they fail miserably.

00:06:19.679 --> 00:06:24.600
They come to this place, and Job says that the words that I'm hearing from you, that

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:29.440
these words are vain words, and he tells them that they're miserable comforters.

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:35.000
He then will tell them that he, by their words, that they're vexing his soul and breaking

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.679
him in pieces.

00:06:38.679 --> 00:06:42.679
We're not studying all of the words of what these individuals have said.

00:06:42.679 --> 00:06:47.119
It would take us longer than just the short time that we have this evening in order to

00:06:47.119 --> 00:06:50.880
do that, but if you go back and you read through the book of Job, you find that there are many

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:56.679
accusations that are sent against Job from these friends.

00:06:56.679 --> 00:07:04.760
And we find that Job is giving this answer, and he's helping us to recognize this evening

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.399
the impact of our words.

00:07:07.399 --> 00:07:14.600
No doubt many of you probably at some point said or heard said that little thing of sticks

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:18.200
and stones can break my bones, but words can never hurt me.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.559
How many of you heard that?

00:07:19.559 --> 00:07:21.720
When you're a kid, maybe you said it, whatever.

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:27.079
You know, I understand the saying, and I understand people using it, but the reality is that words

00:07:27.079 --> 00:07:29.760
can hurt.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:35.359
What people say, the way that we use our tongue, the way that we use our mouth, our words,

00:07:35.359 --> 00:07:39.279
our speech, we can hurt people.

00:07:39.279 --> 00:07:44.119
And Job reveals that to us when he says that they're miserable comforters when he tells

00:07:44.119 --> 00:07:48.000
them that they break me in pieces with words.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.760
And so remember, Solomon said in Proverbs 18 and verse 21, death and life are in the

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.880
power of the tongue.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:08:00.279
And so what a great contrast, death and life in the power of the tongue.

00:08:00.279 --> 00:08:05.000
And we find here that there is a great impact that our words have.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.119
The people that speak to us, their words have impact.

00:08:08.119 --> 00:08:12.399
The way in which we use our words, they impact people.

00:08:12.399 --> 00:08:16.320
But I want you to consider not only the impact of our words in these first few verses of

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:20.720
Job 16, but I want you to consider the intent of Job.

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:24.760
Notice what he says in verse number five, we've made note of it by way of giving our

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:30.000
title for the message this evening, but we see that there's this conjunction.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.880
He says to them as he answers them in verses two, three, and four, he says, this is the

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:37.400
way that you're using your words.

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.159
This is the impact of your words.

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:45.400
This is the result of what you're saying, you're miserable comforters, but I, remember

00:08:45.479 --> 00:08:49.679
he says, I could heap up words against you if you were in my stead, if we would switch

00:08:49.679 --> 00:08:56.679
places here, I could speak the same way that you are, but notice the intent of Job twofold.

00:08:57.859 --> 00:09:02.799
Number one, I would strengthen you with my mouth.

00:09:02.799 --> 00:09:06.719
I would strengthen you with my mouth.

00:09:06.719 --> 00:09:13.719
And then notice, and the moving of my lips should assuage your grief.

00:09:14.719 --> 00:09:20.280
How Job would use his words as he makes this declaration in verse number five, as he would

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:27.280
respond to Eliphaz and tell him that you guys came to mourn with me and to comfort me, but

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:32.599
miserable comforters are you all, and you've used your words and they're vain words and

00:09:32.599 --> 00:09:38.239
you've used your words and they're hurtful and they're not helpful, but if you were in

00:09:38.239 --> 00:09:45.239
my place, if I had the roles reversed and I were coming to you, I would use my mouth

00:09:45.799 --> 00:09:48.039
first of all to strengthen you.

00:09:48.039 --> 00:09:52.000
Wow, that's a good purpose, is it not?

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.799
You think about the, you ever hear somebody say, you should think before you speak?

00:09:57.799 --> 00:10:04.799
Or maybe you've said, I don't want to think before I speak.

00:10:04.799 --> 00:10:07.439
I didn't think before I spoke.

00:10:07.439 --> 00:10:10.559
You ever wish you could take some words back,

00:10:10.559 --> 00:10:13.239
but once they pass that gate of your lips,

00:10:13.239 --> 00:10:15.259
they're kind of already out there,

00:10:15.259 --> 00:10:16.899
and you say, oh man,

00:10:16.899 --> 00:10:19.479
that's not what I really wanted to say.

00:10:19.479 --> 00:10:22.459
I wasn't thinking when I said that.

00:10:22.459 --> 00:10:24.059
I would submit to you this evening

00:10:24.059 --> 00:10:27.999
that if we take the approach of Job here,

00:10:27.999 --> 00:10:29.519
what he says in v. 5,

00:10:29.519 --> 00:10:31.679
if we have this same intent,

00:10:31.679 --> 00:10:33.939
this same purpose, if you will,

00:10:34.179 --> 00:10:35.779
on how we would use our words,

00:10:35.779 --> 00:10:39.899
that he says, I would strengthen you with my mouth.

00:10:39.899 --> 00:10:41.219
That's gonna require us to think

00:10:41.219 --> 00:10:43.339
about what we're gonna say.

00:10:43.339 --> 00:10:48.339
How can I strengthen somebody with the words of my mouth?

00:10:48.419 --> 00:10:52.699
It's going to have to require that we are thoughtful

00:10:52.699 --> 00:10:56.419
and we are specific and very pointed

00:10:56.419 --> 00:10:57.819
in the things that we say,

00:10:57.819 --> 00:11:01.139
and that we are going to give these words

00:11:01.179 --> 00:11:06.059
an understanding that we're seeking to strengthen someone.

00:11:06.059 --> 00:11:08.299
That's why it's helpful

00:11:08.299 --> 00:11:11.019
to let the Word of God get into you,

00:11:11.019 --> 00:11:14.539
because then you can speak the Word of God to people.

00:11:14.539 --> 00:11:17.339
And when you're speaking the Word of God to people,

00:11:17.339 --> 00:11:19.539
it is God's Word that you're speaking to them,

00:11:19.539 --> 00:11:23.259
and your mouth is being used to strengthen them,

00:11:23.259 --> 00:11:26.139
because you're speaking the words of God.

00:11:26.139 --> 00:11:28.659
I know that as we look at Psalm 119,

00:11:28.659 --> 00:11:30.059
and there's so many references

00:11:30.059 --> 00:11:31.339
in that portion of Scripture

00:11:31.339 --> 00:11:33.419
that are so impactful for the believer,

00:11:33.419 --> 00:11:37.219
and just the way in which God's Word would influence us.

00:11:37.219 --> 00:11:40.419
And as we've looked through that passage in years gone by,

00:11:40.419 --> 00:11:43.819
we made note that the psalmist really had a desire

00:11:43.819 --> 00:11:47.259
to think and act biblically.

00:11:47.259 --> 00:11:49.339
And the more we get into the Word of God,

00:11:49.339 --> 00:11:51.579
and the more we allow the Word of God to get into us,

00:11:51.579 --> 00:11:54.659
the more we're able to use the Word of God

00:11:54.659 --> 00:11:59.059
in seeking to encourage and strengthen others.

00:12:01.059 --> 00:12:05.099
We need to be calculated in how we would speak to people

00:12:05.099 --> 00:12:08.699
in the words that we would choose to use.

00:12:08.699 --> 00:12:12.339
I find not only does Job say that he would strengthen them,

00:12:12.339 --> 00:12:14.419
he says, I would strengthen you with my mouth,

00:12:14.419 --> 00:12:16.899
but notice the last part of verse 5.

00:12:16.899 --> 00:12:20.499
He says, and the moving of my lips

00:12:20.499 --> 00:12:23.819
should assuage your grief.

00:12:23.819 --> 00:12:26.139
That phraseology carries with it

00:12:26.179 --> 00:12:30.579
the idea of easing or lessening your grief.

00:12:30.579 --> 00:12:32.939
And we look to the Word of God,

00:12:32.939 --> 00:12:35.619
again, as we allow the Word of God to get into us,

00:12:35.619 --> 00:12:37.939
and we begin to respond.

00:12:37.939 --> 00:12:41.139
There were some things that these friends understood

00:12:41.139 --> 00:12:44.419
about the principle of sowing and reaping.

00:12:44.419 --> 00:12:46.579
They understood some of the principle,

00:12:46.579 --> 00:12:49.819
the law, if you will, that God has established

00:12:49.819 --> 00:12:53.219
that be not deceived, God is not mocked,

00:12:53.219 --> 00:12:55.579
whatsoever man soweth, that shall he also reap.

00:12:55.579 --> 00:12:59.099
That is a Bible principle, a Bible truth.

00:12:59.099 --> 00:13:02.419
But there's also the fact that times in our lives

00:13:02.419 --> 00:13:05.739
that here for Job, it was not necessarily

00:13:05.739 --> 00:13:08.779
a corrective thing that was going on in Job 1.

00:13:08.779 --> 00:13:10.619
It was a pruning thing.

00:13:10.619 --> 00:13:12.739
It was a proving thing.

00:13:12.739 --> 00:13:15.779
And the reality is that as we go through the Word of God

00:13:15.779 --> 00:13:20.459
and we are able to share truth with individuals,

00:13:20.459 --> 00:13:23.979
those that are hurting, listen, Job, he was hurting.

00:13:24.979 --> 00:13:27.379
His wife said, curse God and die.

00:13:29.499 --> 00:13:32.419
Then he has some friends come that come to mourn with him

00:13:32.419 --> 00:13:36.699
and to comfort him, and they're miserable comforters.

00:13:36.699 --> 00:13:39.179
You know, there are people that you come into contact with

00:13:39.179 --> 00:13:41.859
and I come into contact with that are hurting people.

00:13:43.139 --> 00:13:45.339
And there are times in which we may know

00:13:45.339 --> 00:13:49.019
just a little bit of what they're going through

00:13:49.019 --> 00:13:50.499
and how they're hurting.

00:13:50.659 --> 00:13:54.979
But God might allow us to be in a place where we could,

00:13:54.979 --> 00:13:58.659
as Job declares here, we could use our words

00:13:58.659 --> 00:14:01.779
to strengthen and to help assuage the grief

00:14:01.779 --> 00:14:03.259
of that individual.

00:14:03.259 --> 00:14:04.499
Notice what the psalmist says,

00:14:04.499 --> 00:14:06.979
a couple of truths that we understand.

00:14:06.979 --> 00:14:08.499
Notice Psalm 19.

00:14:09.459 --> 00:14:13.019
Psalm 19, again, when we think about the stated intent

00:14:13.019 --> 00:14:16.379
or purpose of Job and how he would use his words,

00:14:16.379 --> 00:14:18.899
it helps us to understand how we need to think

00:14:18.899 --> 00:14:19.739
before we speak.

00:14:19.739 --> 00:14:22.139
It helps us to be calculated in the things

00:14:22.139 --> 00:14:25.500
that we would say, such as the case even here in Psalm 19,

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:28.579
a familiar verse of scripture in verse number 14.

00:14:28.579 --> 00:14:31.979
The psalm ends with this verse and the psalmist says,

00:14:31.979 --> 00:14:36.979
let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart

00:14:38.539 --> 00:14:42.099
be acceptable in thy sight,

00:14:42.099 --> 00:14:46.099
O Lord, my strength and my redeemer.

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:50.259
Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart

00:14:50.259 --> 00:14:53.419
be acceptable in thy sight.

00:14:53.419 --> 00:14:57.299
That would, again, require us to think before we speak.

00:14:57.299 --> 00:15:00.179
Is God going to be pleased with that

00:15:00.179 --> 00:15:02.139
which I'm going to communicate?

00:15:02.139 --> 00:15:06.099
It causes me to be calculated before I just begin

00:15:06.099 --> 00:15:07.539
to let me share with you.

00:15:07.539 --> 00:15:09.139
I mean, these friends, they kind of are,

00:15:09.139 --> 00:15:11.699
let me just share with you what I think.

00:15:11.699 --> 00:15:12.539
And let me just give it to you.

00:15:12.539 --> 00:15:15.139
And you get to the end of the chapter and the young guy,

00:15:15.179 --> 00:15:17.139
he says, well, all these older guys have spoken

00:15:17.139 --> 00:15:18.179
and they haven't figured it out.

00:15:18.179 --> 00:15:19.220
So now I'm going to speak

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:21.179
and I'm going to reveal wisdom to you.

00:15:23.859 --> 00:15:26.419
Notice over in the book of Ephesians, if you will,

00:15:27.579 --> 00:15:29.940
Ephesians chapter number five,

00:15:32.739 --> 00:15:36.739
four, excuse me, Ephesians chapter number four.

00:15:36.739 --> 00:15:38.979
And look at verse number 29.

00:15:40.539 --> 00:15:44.419
Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth.

00:15:46.139 --> 00:15:48.779
What's that second word?

00:15:48.779 --> 00:15:53.779
No, let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth.

00:15:54.659 --> 00:15:59.659
But that which is good to the use of edifying,

00:16:02.579 --> 00:16:07.059
to edify, to build up, to encourage.

00:16:07.059 --> 00:16:08.579
What did Job say?

00:16:08.579 --> 00:16:10.699
To strengthen you, right?

00:16:10.699 --> 00:16:11.779
That's what he said.

00:16:11.779 --> 00:16:13.139
I would use my words.

00:16:13.139 --> 00:16:17.139
I would strengthen you with my mouth.

00:16:17.139 --> 00:16:20.259
And so here, the New Testament tells us

00:16:20.259 --> 00:16:22.539
that we're not to allow corrupt communication

00:16:22.539 --> 00:16:23.659
to proceed out of your mouth,

00:16:23.659 --> 00:16:27.220
but that which is good to the use of edifying,

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:31.500
that it may minister grace unto the hearers.

00:16:32.459 --> 00:16:37.459
Oh, we can use our speech in that manner.

00:16:37.819 --> 00:16:41.739
As I consider the passage in Job 16,

00:16:41.739 --> 00:16:44.179
as I think about the circumstances

00:16:44.179 --> 00:16:47.579
in which Job had endured and all that was going on,

00:16:47.579 --> 00:16:50.299
and I see his response to Eliphaz,

00:16:50.299 --> 00:16:53.899
and I consider his response to Bildad in chapter 19,

00:16:53.899 --> 00:16:56.619
and we see the impact of our words,

00:16:56.619 --> 00:16:59.579
but the stated intent or purpose of Job

00:16:59.579 --> 00:17:01.940
on how he would use his words,

00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:03.419
I then notice this.

00:17:03.419 --> 00:17:04.819
If you're taking notes number three,

00:17:04.819 --> 00:17:07.659
I want you to note the testimony of Job.

00:17:07.659 --> 00:17:11.139
It's interesting that here in chapter number 16,

00:17:11.339 --> 00:17:13.739
Job is answering Eliphaz,

00:17:13.739 --> 00:17:15.299
and as he's answering Eliphaz,

00:17:15.299 --> 00:17:17.259
he says, here's what you guys have done,

00:17:17.259 --> 00:17:19.259
but I, if I were to speak to you,

00:17:19.259 --> 00:17:20.779
if you were in my place,

00:17:20.779 --> 00:17:22.619
if the roles were reversed,

00:17:22.619 --> 00:17:25.220
I could heap up words against you.

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:27.179
I could shake mine head at you,

00:17:27.179 --> 00:17:30.659
but I would strengthen you with my mouth,

00:17:30.659 --> 00:17:34.539
and the moving of my lips should assuage your grief.

00:17:34.539 --> 00:17:37.059
That's his intent.

00:17:37.059 --> 00:17:38.220
That's his purpose.

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:40.259
That's what he says he would do.

00:17:40.259 --> 00:17:42.739
But when I note the testimony of Job,

00:17:42.739 --> 00:17:45.859
really, if you go back to Job chapter number four,

00:17:45.859 --> 00:17:48.379
you find that that's exactly what Job did.

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:52.220
Notice, turn back to Job chapter number four, if you will.

00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:53.379
It's very interesting.

00:17:54.459 --> 00:17:56.419
In Job chapter number four,

00:17:56.419 --> 00:17:59.579
we read the first speech of Eliphaz.

00:17:59.579 --> 00:18:01.379
Now remember, this is the fellow

00:18:01.379 --> 00:18:04.339
that Job is responding to,

00:18:04.339 --> 00:18:06.779
and it's really the second speech of Eliphaz

00:18:06.779 --> 00:18:10.220
that he's speaking to in chapter number 16,

00:18:11.059 --> 00:18:13.099
and he's responding to that particular speech,

00:18:13.099 --> 00:18:15.539
but we find that Job chapter number four

00:18:15.539 --> 00:18:17.619
records for us the first speech

00:18:17.619 --> 00:18:19.979
of this man Eliphaz the Temanite.

00:18:19.979 --> 00:18:22.419
Notice it says this in verse number one,

00:18:22.419 --> 00:18:24.899
then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,

00:18:24.899 --> 00:18:27.739
if we say to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved?

00:18:27.739 --> 00:18:30.500
But who can withhold himself from speaking?

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:34.699
Notice what he says about Job in verses three and four.

00:18:34.699 --> 00:18:37.099
Now understand, in chapter number 16,

00:18:37.099 --> 00:18:38.739
we're reading the words of Job.

00:18:38.739 --> 00:18:41.459
We're reading that Job says, this is what I would do.

00:18:41.459 --> 00:18:43.580
I would strengthen you with my mouth.

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:46.820
I would use my words to assuage your grief.

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:48.619
But here in chapter number four,

00:18:48.619 --> 00:18:53.260
this is what Eliphaz is saying that Job did.

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:58.260
Verse three, behold, thou hast instructed many,

00:18:59.779 --> 00:19:04.779
and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.

00:19:04.979 --> 00:19:08.140
Well, that's a great testimony, is it not?

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:12.739
That Job was known by Eliphaz to do two things

00:19:12.739 --> 00:19:14.299
according to verse number three.

00:19:14.299 --> 00:19:18.019
Number one, he instructed, he instructed many.

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:20.899
We know that as we read the book of Job

00:19:20.899 --> 00:19:22.260
and you go through the entirety of the book,

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:27.260
you understand that Job was a very profitable man,

00:19:28.219 --> 00:19:31.260
been blessed by God in a very distinct way.

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:33.140
And Job, according to verse number three,

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:35.820
he had great influence because the Bible says

00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:39.940
that Eliphaz says thou hast instructed many.

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:43.299
We can use our mouth, our words, our lips

00:19:43.299 --> 00:19:46.339
to instruct individuals, but we also notice

00:19:46.339 --> 00:19:48.739
that in verse number three, it says this,

00:19:48.739 --> 00:19:53.739
and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:57.500
What is it that Job said he would do?

00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:58.859
I would strengthen you.

00:19:58.859 --> 00:20:00.219
Is that not what he said?

00:20:00.219 --> 00:20:02.580
In verse number five of Job 16,

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:05.059
he says I would strengthen you with my mouth.

00:20:05.059 --> 00:20:08.479
Well, Eliphaz said in his first speech, as he begins, he says,

00:20:08.479 --> 00:20:10.979
Job, you have instructed many,

00:20:10.979 --> 00:20:15.319
but also you have strengthened the weak hands.

00:20:15.319 --> 00:20:19.079
Notice verse number four, thy words.

00:20:19.079 --> 00:20:21.539
So we understand that's how Job did it, right?

00:20:21.539 --> 00:20:25.279
Job instructed, he strengthened the weak hands with his words.

00:20:25.279 --> 00:20:29.119
Thy words have upholden him that was falling,

00:20:29.119 --> 00:20:34.259
and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.

00:20:34.499 --> 00:20:36.739
Well, praise the Lord for that testimony.

00:20:38.039 --> 00:20:41.279
That Job had this testimony that Eliphaz says,

00:20:41.279 --> 00:20:43.179
this is what you have done.

00:20:43.179 --> 00:20:47.499
Job, you have been in a position earlier in your life,

00:20:47.499 --> 00:20:49.439
many, many times in your life,

00:20:49.439 --> 00:20:50.739
you've been in the position

00:20:50.739 --> 00:20:52.619
where you've been able to instruct people.

00:20:52.619 --> 00:20:53.659
You've been in the position

00:20:53.659 --> 00:20:56.419
that you've been able to strengthen people.

00:20:56.419 --> 00:20:58.179
You have done this.

00:20:58.179 --> 00:21:00.419
Obviously, we find in verse number five, he says,

00:21:00.419 --> 00:21:02.299
but now it has come upon thee, and thou faintest,

00:21:02.299 --> 00:21:04.139
it touches thee, and thou art troubled.

00:21:04.979 --> 00:21:06.979
And so he's thinking that he's going to now share some words

00:21:06.979 --> 00:21:09.979
and try to help Job through this situation.

00:21:09.979 --> 00:21:12.979
And we find, even as we mentioned in our text in Job 16,

00:21:12.979 --> 00:21:14.459
that they're miserable comforters,

00:21:14.459 --> 00:21:17.059
and they did not use their words to strengthen

00:21:17.059 --> 00:21:20.759
or to instruct, but rather to these vain words

00:21:20.759 --> 00:21:24.899
that were used according to what we read in Job chapter 19,

00:21:24.899 --> 00:21:26.699
that they were vexing his soul

00:21:26.699 --> 00:21:31.619
and breaking in pieces his bones with their words.

00:21:31.619 --> 00:21:35.379
And so this evening, as we look at this simple thought

00:21:35.379 --> 00:21:38.899
in this few passages of scripture from the book of Job,

00:21:38.899 --> 00:21:42.899
I find that there's a lesson for us

00:21:42.899 --> 00:21:47.059
with regard to our words and how we would use our words.

00:21:47.059 --> 00:21:50.579
We understand that God says much about our speech,

00:21:50.579 --> 00:21:53.500
and our speech, we've mentioned a few other verses

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:54.979
throughout the scriptures this evening,

00:21:54.979 --> 00:21:58.379
and the word of God obviously gives us instruction

00:21:58.379 --> 00:22:01.180
as to how we are to speak and the things that we are to say,

00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:02.739
but I would ask this evening,

00:22:04.699 --> 00:22:07.459
are we more like the friends of Job,

00:22:07.459 --> 00:22:08.779
or are we more like Job?

00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:15.580
Are we using our words to strengthen,

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:21.500
to comfort, to help assuage the grief of those

00:22:21.739 --> 00:22:23.860
that we come into contact with,

00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:27.860
or are we coming in with these words that are vain words?

00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:31.779
Are we hurting people instead of helping people?

00:22:32.819 --> 00:22:35.699
See, there's a great contrast in Job 16.

00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:39.860
And the reality is that these friends,

00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:41.619
according to Job 2 and verse number 11,

00:22:41.619 --> 00:22:42.860
I have not read that verse too,

00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:43.979
I've referenced it a few times,

00:22:43.979 --> 00:22:45.179
but if you want to look at it,

00:22:45.179 --> 00:22:46.539
just so you can see what it says,

00:22:46.539 --> 00:22:48.819
now, when Job's three friends heard of all this evil

00:22:48.819 --> 00:22:50.099
that was come upon him,

00:22:50.099 --> 00:22:51.779
they came, everyone from his own place,

00:22:51.779 --> 00:22:54.459
Eliphaz the Tammanite, and Bildad the Shuhite,

00:22:54.459 --> 00:22:56.020
and Zophar the Namathite,

00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:58.660
for they had made an appointment together,

00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:02.580
notice, to come to mourn with him and to comfort him.

00:23:05.339 --> 00:23:07.220
But they were miserable comforters.

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:08.300
They didn't use their words.

00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:11.979
They were not successful at using their words

00:23:11.979 --> 00:23:15.139
for the stated purpose of Job 2 and verse number 11.

00:23:15.139 --> 00:23:16.979
So if we were to evaluate our words,

00:23:16.979 --> 00:23:18.500
our speech this evening,

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:22.419
would we align more with Job,

00:23:22.459 --> 00:23:24.819
as it says in chapter 4,

00:23:24.819 --> 00:23:29.059
instructing many, strengthening the weak hands,

00:23:29.059 --> 00:23:32.699
thy words have upholden him that was falling,

00:23:32.699 --> 00:23:36.779
thou hast strengthened the feeble knees,

00:23:36.779 --> 00:23:40.459
or would we align more with the friends of Job?

00:23:40.459 --> 00:23:43.779
Eliphaz specifically being spoken to in chapter 16,

00:23:43.779 --> 00:23:48.139
Bildad specifically being spoken to in chapter 19,

00:23:48.139 --> 00:23:53.139
vain words, hurtful words, destructive words,

00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:57.779
death and life are in the power of the tongue.

00:23:57.779 --> 00:23:59.580
And this evening, when we think about our words

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:01.259
and we just evaluate,

00:24:01.259 --> 00:24:03.580
and we think about this simple thought

00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:04.979
from the book of Job,

00:24:04.979 --> 00:24:06.779
I believe that when we keep this in mind

00:24:06.779 --> 00:24:08.779
and when we pray the prayer that the psalmist prayed

00:24:08.779 --> 00:24:11.419
in Psalm 19 and verse number 14,

00:24:11.419 --> 00:24:12.739
it would cause us to be in a position

00:24:12.739 --> 00:24:15.300
where we have to think before we speak.

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:18.699
We have to be calculated in the things that we say.

00:24:18.699 --> 00:24:21.220
Speak the truth in love.

00:24:22.179 --> 00:24:23.579
Speak the truth in love.

00:24:23.579 --> 00:24:25.019
You know, it's interesting to me,

00:24:25.019 --> 00:24:27.100
if you study the Bible,

00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:28.980
of course, obviously you're going to learn

00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:31.299
a lot of wonderful things if you study the Bible,

00:24:31.299 --> 00:24:34.019
and what a simple statement.

00:24:34.899 --> 00:24:36.660
But I think about the Apostle Paul.

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:41.380
Paul said some things to some people,

00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:43.380
to some of the churches and some of the individuals

00:24:43.419 --> 00:24:46.820
that he ministered to that were

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:53.299
direct and could have been hurtful things,

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:56.459
but he said them in love.

00:24:57.859 --> 00:25:00.779
If you look at the book of First Thessalonians,

00:25:00.779 --> 00:25:02.739
when he speaks to the believers of Thessalonica,

00:25:02.739 --> 00:25:05.540
he tells those believers that he desired

00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:07.660
to send Timothy unto them

00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:09.739
so that Timothy could perfect that

00:25:09.739 --> 00:25:13.220
which was lacking in their faith.

00:25:14.059 --> 00:25:14.899
Now, when you're telling somebody

00:25:14.899 --> 00:25:16.299
that they have some areas in which they need to grow

00:25:16.299 --> 00:25:18.700
that you're lacking in your faith,

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:20.380
that could be taken wrong.

00:25:22.459 --> 00:25:24.179
But you know, it doesn't seem that the believers

00:25:24.179 --> 00:25:26.100
in Thessalonica took it wrong

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:29.540
because they knew that Paul was speaking it in love.

00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:31.459
He was trying to help them.

00:25:31.459 --> 00:25:35.100
He said, listen, there's some instruction that's needed

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:37.100
and we're going to provide a means

00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:40.179
in which that instruction can be provided.

00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:43.220
And so the reality is that we,

00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:45.059
it's not that we would use our words

00:25:45.059 --> 00:25:47.299
that we would just lie to people to make them feel good.

00:25:47.299 --> 00:25:50.019
That's not the point of what I'm saying this evening.

00:25:50.019 --> 00:25:52.179
We need to speak the truth.

00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:57.339
We speak it in love and we speak calculated.

00:25:57.339 --> 00:26:02.339
How can my words strengthen this individual?

00:26:02.899 --> 00:26:06.820
How can my words help assuage the grief

00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:08.940
that this individual is enduring

00:26:09.019 --> 00:26:10.940
at this particular time in their life?

00:26:12.019 --> 00:26:16.019
We begin to see that as we would evaluate our own words

00:26:16.019 --> 00:26:18.260
and our own opportunities,

00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:21.380
perhaps we could look at these comparisons,

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:23.339
this contrast, if you will,

00:26:23.339 --> 00:26:26.619
between the words of Job and the words of his friends.

00:26:26.619 --> 00:26:30.100
And I just ask for a simple, I guess,

00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:32.579
evaluation of ourselves.

00:26:32.579 --> 00:26:34.619
On what side would we align?

00:26:34.619 --> 00:26:38.500
Would we align more with Job or more with his friends?

00:26:39.019 --> 00:26:41.380
I hope this evening that the answer would be

00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:43.660
that we align with Job.

00:26:44.619 --> 00:26:48.380
That we are using our words to strengthen,

00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:50.059
to help assuage the grief,

00:26:50.059 --> 00:26:53.459
to help strengthen those that are weak.

00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:57.220
And God will allow us to do so.

00:26:58.260 --> 00:26:59.459
We need to think.

00:26:59.459 --> 00:27:02.500
We need to be calculated in how we speak.

00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:07.260
Job says that he would strengthen them

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:08.419
with the words of his mouth,

00:27:08.419 --> 00:27:10.579
or with his mouth he would strengthen them.

00:27:10.579 --> 00:27:12.019
And what a blessing.

00:27:12.019 --> 00:27:14.540
And not only do we see he intended to do that,

00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:16.100
he said that's what he would do,

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:19.459
but he was known to have done that.

00:27:19.459 --> 00:27:21.260
That was his practice,

00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:24.940
according to what Eliphaz says of him in Job 4.

00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:27.380
What a great testimony that Job had.

00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:30.339
And oh, that we too would have a similar testimony.

00:27:30.339 --> 00:27:31.179
Let's pray.

00:27:31.179 --> 00:27:32.419
Father, we love you.

00:27:32.419 --> 00:27:34.700
We thank you for loving us.

00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:38.100
God, I pray that you would help us

00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:39.619
to evaluate our speech,

00:27:39.619 --> 00:27:43.299
that we would pray as the psalmist prayed in Psalm 19,

00:27:43.299 --> 00:27:45.820
let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart

00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:48.500
be acceptable in thy sight.

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:52.019
That we would understand that we're to use our words

00:27:52.019 --> 00:27:54.419
according to what Paul tells the believers in Ephesus

00:27:54.419 --> 00:27:58.220
for the edifying of the brethren.

00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:01.380
Father, I pray that you'd help us to align with Job,

00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:03.500
that we would be purposed and calculated

00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:05.059
in the things that we would say,

00:28:05.059 --> 00:28:06.779
that we might be used of thee

00:28:06.779 --> 00:28:09.980
to help strengthen those that are weak,

00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:12.779
that we might help to assuage the grief

00:28:12.779 --> 00:28:15.820
of those that are enduring hardship.

00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:19.859
Lord, help us to speak the truth in love.

00:28:21.139 --> 00:28:22.980
I pray that you'd bless our time of prayer.

00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:24.739
We thank you so much for the privilege

00:28:24.739 --> 00:28:27.339
and for the opportunity in the middle of our week

00:28:27.339 --> 00:28:29.820
to come and not only study your word,

00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:33.419
but to spend time in prayer as a church family.

00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:36.260
We understand the significance of prayer,

00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:39.820
the importance, the priority of prayer.

00:28:40.779 --> 00:28:42.700
We pray that you'd be pleased with our time

00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:43.659
and we'll thank you for it.

00:28:43.659 --> 00:28:46.140
In Christ's name we pray, amen.

00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:48.500
Does anyone need a prayer bulletin this evening?
