1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,679
You use 50 verses of scripture

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:04,000
and you're gonna try to turn to every one of them.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,280
We'll be here for a couple of hours, amen.

4
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,079
And I know that you're not wanting to be here

5
00:00:08,079 --> 00:00:09,100
for a couple of hours.

6
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:13,279
And so I've put the majority of the verses.

7
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:14,840
There's one passage of scripture

8
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:18,280
that I did not type out all of the 20 verses

9
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,079
of that passage, but for everything else,

10
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:21,760
I've typed out the verses

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,020
so that we can see it here on the screen.

12
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:26,000
In Psalm chapter 10, it's the title

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,959
that I've used for the message this morning.

14
00:00:27,959 --> 00:00:30,399
Verse number 16 says this,

15
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:35,400
the Lord is king forever and ever.

16
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:38,639
The Bible says the heathen are perished out of his land.

17
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:43,639
And I'm thankful to know the Lord is king forever and ever.

18
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,959
It is important that we understand

19
00:00:45,959 --> 00:00:50,639
from the start this morning that our God is on his throne.

20
00:00:50,639 --> 00:00:53,159
I mean, right now at this very moment,

21
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:56,000
the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.

22
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,520
And it's important for us to understand that.

23
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,360
And we find that Jesus is king.

24
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,560
Can I say this this morning?

25
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,480
He's not on the ballot.

26
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,400
He's not on the ballot.

27
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,680
Why isn't he on the ballot?

28
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,760
Because he doesn't need to be, it's his rightful place.

29
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,839
All right, we're not voting for Jesus.

30
00:01:14,839 --> 00:01:17,000
Jesus is on his throne.

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,120
Aren't you thankful for that?

32
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,120
Amen.

33
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,519
And he's not on the ballot.

34
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:23,599
Listen, he always has been,

35
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:28,599
and he always will be king of kings and Lord of lords.

36
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,239
And that ought to cause us this morning to rejoice greatly.

37
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:35,400
And we look at this and I got a picture there

38
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,400
that has a Bible open to the book of Psalms.

39
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,720
And then it has a individual that's casting a ballot.

40
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,879
As you know, and you cannot,

41
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:47,019
if you don't know, your head is in the sand.

42
00:01:47,019 --> 00:01:48,739
I'm not sure how you could not know.

43
00:01:48,739 --> 00:01:50,639
But in just a couple of weeks,

44
00:01:50,639 --> 00:01:52,599
we're gonna have a, actually a week

45
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:56,160
in just a couple of days, an election here in our nation.

46
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,800
And this morning, I want us to understand

47
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,319
with great clarity that the truth of this here

48
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:06,199
has to impact this here.

49
00:02:06,199 --> 00:02:07,800
What do I mean by that?

50
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:12,559
The Bible is our sole authority for faith and practice.

51
00:02:12,559 --> 00:02:16,160
And it's absolutely vital that Christians once again

52
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,100
recognize the authority of God's word

53
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:23,139
and its influence on how we cast a ballot.

54
00:02:23,139 --> 00:02:25,679
We have the privilege of casting a ballot

55
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:27,380
and I'm thankful for that.

56
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,779
But I rejoice this morning to know that my King,

57
00:02:30,779 --> 00:02:34,300
my King Jesus, that he rules and that he reigns.

58
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:37,539
Notice with me, we mentioned Psalm 10, 16 already,

59
00:02:37,539 --> 00:02:42,380
but notice if you will, in Psalm 29, in verse number 10,

60
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:46,220
the Bible says this, the Lord sitteth upon the flood,

61
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:51,100
yea, the Lord sitteth King forever.

62
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:54,300
We find in Psalm 97 and verse number one,

63
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,300
the Bible says this, the Lord reigneth.

64
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,139
Aren't you thankful?

65
00:02:58,139 --> 00:02:59,259
The book of Revelation says,

66
00:02:59,259 --> 00:03:02,580
the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.

67
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,380
Our God reigns.

68
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:07,740
And I'm so thankful this morning that we understand that

69
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,600
and we can rejoice in that truth,

70
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,220
but we must acknowledge that long ago,

71
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:16,020
mankind rejected God as their ruler.

72
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:18,300
We understand as you were to study the Old Testament

73
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,119
and study the people of Israel,

74
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:26,740
that they had a theocracy where literally God was their King.

75
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,339
God was their ruler.

76
00:03:28,339 --> 00:03:32,059
And we find that they rejected God and they said this,

77
00:03:32,059 --> 00:03:33,779
give us a King.

78
00:03:33,779 --> 00:03:36,240
Samuel was disappointed with their interest

79
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,080
in having a King.

80
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,339
They desired to be like all the other people.

81
00:03:39,339 --> 00:03:44,339
They were so distinct and so unique that God was their King.

82
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:45,820
They had a theocracy,

83
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:50,820
but yet they wanted what the other nations of the world had.

84
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:54,300
We find that Samuel was disappointed,

85
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,820
that Samuel struggled greatly with that.

86
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:02,139
But we find that in that rejection of the nation of Israel,

87
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:06,339
rejecting God and changing the truth of a theocracy

88
00:04:06,339 --> 00:04:08,039
into a monarchy,

89
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,899
that human history from that point forward

90
00:04:10,899 --> 00:04:13,580
has really plunged into the situation

91
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:16,459
of having humans rule us

92
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:20,260
or lead us from a government perspective.

93
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,700
Now here's what I'm thankful for.

94
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,540
God knew that.

95
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,459
If you study the book of Deuteronomy,

96
00:04:25,459 --> 00:04:28,820
well before the people ever asked for a King,

97
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:32,700
God gave instruction to Kings.

98
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,779
Why would he give instruction to Kings

99
00:04:34,779 --> 00:04:37,700
if it wasn't his plan that there be Kings?

100
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,380
Because he knew that man would not follow his plan

101
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,980
and because he's the omniscient eternal God,

102
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:45,619
he provided them with instruction

103
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,160
and for that we can rejoice.

104
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,119
But from that point in human history,

105
00:04:49,119 --> 00:04:52,899
we find that man has been ruled by humanity.

106
00:04:52,899 --> 00:04:54,940
Humanity has been ruled by humanity.

107
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,540
Sometimes there have been good rulers.

108
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,899
Sometimes there's been ruthless rulers.

109
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:01,179
But consider this thought from Proverbs 29

110
00:05:01,179 --> 00:05:02,500
in verse number two.

111
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,619
When the righteous are in authority,

112
00:05:04,619 --> 00:05:05,739
notice what the Bible says,

113
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:08,779
the people rejoice.

114
00:05:08,779 --> 00:05:11,579
But when the wicked beareth rule,

115
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:13,940
the people mourn.

116
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,820
There's a contrast in this verse of Scripture

117
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,100
between the righteous that are in authority

118
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,940
versus the wicked that beareth rule.

119
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:25,380
And we find that the contrast between the leadership

120
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:29,320
has a profound impact on those that are being ruled.

121
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,820
The Bible says that when the righteous are in authority,

122
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:32,839
the people rejoice.

123
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:34,899
But when the wicked beareth rule,

124
00:05:34,899 --> 00:05:36,859
that the people mourn.

125
00:05:36,859 --> 00:05:39,059
Understand some foundational truth

126
00:05:39,059 --> 00:05:41,700
as we consider the thought this morning,

127
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:46,040
as we go through this thought this morning

128
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:50,700
with regard to our role in understanding biblical truth.

129
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,820
One day, Jesus will come back

130
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,579
and set up his millennial kingdom.

131
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,859
He'll literally rule and reign for a thousand years.

132
00:06:01,179 --> 00:06:03,000
He'll rule with a rod of iron.

133
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,980
We as the people of God will have the privilege

134
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,320
of being able to rule with him

135
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,559
and to experience that truth.

136
00:06:11,559 --> 00:06:14,619
And we find that Revelation 20 verses one through six

137
00:06:14,619 --> 00:06:17,700
gives in a very condensed passage that truth.

138
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,600
We can find references to the millennium

139
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,440
all throughout the pages of Scripture.

140
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,880
In fact, the Old Testament prophets speak much

141
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,959
about the millennial kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ.

142
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:32,880
Until that time, however, we are governed by human rulers.

143
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,380
We have the unique blessing

144
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,160
of living United States of America

145
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,399
where we have elected officials.

146
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:43,640
We find that as citizens, we have not only a privilege,

147
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,320
but a responsibility to vote.

148
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,339
But as Christians, I would say this,

149
00:06:49,339 --> 00:06:52,480
when it is our privilege and our responsibility to vote

150
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,399
that we have to understand that the Bible

151
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:59,760
must influence how we cast our ballot.

152
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,880
It's absolutely imperative.

153
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,880
I cannot separate my Christian life duty obligation

154
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,519
from my civil duty and obligation.

155
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:12,559
I am a Christian first and foremost,

156
00:07:12,559 --> 00:07:16,600
and therefore it must affect every part of me.

157
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,480
I understand that in Proverbs 14 in verse number 34,

158
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,399
the Bible says this.

159
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:25,820
It says that righteousness exalteth a nation,

160
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,720
but sin is a reproach to any people.

161
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,839
It's interesting to me when I look at this verse

162
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:34,600
of Scripture that God did not say righteousness

163
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,480
exalted Israel or sin is a reproach to Israel.

164
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,559
The truth that is given to us is a truth

165
00:07:41,559 --> 00:07:43,880
that's beyond just Israel.

166
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,720
It's for all people, all nations.

167
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,279
And thus God says righteousness exalteth a nation,

168
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:53,160
but sin is a reproach to any people.

169
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,880
Understand this in Psalm 11 in verse number seven,

170
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,359
the Bible says that the righteous Lord

171
00:07:58,359 --> 00:08:01,160
loveth righteousness.

172
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,640
He's a righteous God and he loves righteousness.

173
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,799
The Bible tells us in Psalm 33 in verse number 12,

174
00:08:07,799 --> 00:08:10,239
blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord

175
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,640
and the people whom he hath chosen

176
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,920
for his own inheritance.

177
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,920
But then consider this truth of Psalm nine in verse 17,

178
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,559
the wicked shall be turned into hell

179
00:08:22,559 --> 00:08:26,239
and all the nations that forget God.

180
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:28,839
You say pastor, that's strong language, it's Bible.

181
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:34,599
Our God is a righteous God and he loves righteousness.

182
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:37,280
I've said this from the pulpit many times over the years,

183
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:41,719
even in recent days, our nation is ripe for judgment.

184
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,880
Our nation is ripe for judgment.

185
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,320
We read throughout the pages of Scripture

186
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,559
of God judging nations and peoples,

187
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:55,880
even his own people because of their wickedness

188
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,159
and because of their disobedience.

189
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:02,119
America as a nation is ripe for judgment.

190
00:09:02,119 --> 00:09:04,799
I'm thankful that our God is long suffering.

191
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:06,159
I'm thankful that he's long suffering.

192
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:08,159
Consider with me this morning,

193
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:10,000
we have to remember as we consider

194
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,440
some of these foundational truths

195
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,599
before we dig in to specifics

196
00:09:13,599 --> 00:09:15,880
with regarding this upcoming election.

197
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,239
But I want you to remember that our main purpose

198
00:09:18,239 --> 00:09:20,400
for being left here upon this earth,

199
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,479
Jesus said in Acts one in verse number eight,

200
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:25,119
ye shall be witnesses unto me.

201
00:09:25,119 --> 00:09:27,599
And I want you to see I got both verses on the screen

202
00:09:27,599 --> 00:09:31,359
because in Acts 5.32, the disciples just,

203
00:09:31,359 --> 00:09:36,000
they absolutely embraced what Jesus had told them

204
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,359
in Acts one in verse number eight,

205
00:09:37,359 --> 00:09:39,919
when Jesus said ye shall be witnesses unto me,

206
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:41,719
then in chapter five in verse 32,

207
00:09:41,719 --> 00:09:45,159
they say we are his witnesses.

208
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:48,719
And God's people must embrace that truth once again,

209
00:09:48,719 --> 00:09:50,239
that we are his witnesses.

210
00:09:50,239 --> 00:09:53,479
Listen, we have been given the responsibility

211
00:09:53,479 --> 00:09:56,219
of not only being his witnesses, but being his ambassadors.

212
00:09:56,219 --> 00:09:57,859
The Bible says in second Corinthians five

213
00:09:57,859 --> 00:10:00,219
in verse number 20, now then we are.

214
00:10:00,219 --> 00:10:04,959
ambassadors for Christ. I'm thankful that I'm a pilgrim. I'm a stranger. This world

215
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:10,459
is not my home. I'm just a passing through. The reality is that I have dual citizenship.

216
00:10:10,459 --> 00:10:17,159
Number one, I'm a citizen of heaven. My conversation is in heaven, for which I rejoice, but I also

217
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:22,739
happen to be a citizen of the United States of America. But I'm an ambassador. The Bible

218
00:10:22,739 --> 00:10:27,779
says at the end of that verse, as though God did beseech you by us, we pray you in Christ's

219
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:33,139
stead be reconciled to God. And it reminds us just a couple of verses earlier that God

220
00:10:33,139 --> 00:10:38,379
said this, that all things are of God who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ

221
00:10:38,379 --> 00:10:46,299
and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation. I'm so thankful to be reconciled. I was at

222
00:10:46,299 --> 00:10:54,179
variance with God. I was an enemy. I was lost and undone. But because of the work at Calvary,

223
00:10:54,259 --> 00:11:00,459
I've been redeemed. I've been justified. I've been reconciled. And I'm so thankful for that.

224
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:07,639
And he's given to us the ministry of reconciliation. So it's important that we understand our purpose

225
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:14,019
for being here on earth. Our purpose is not primarily political. Amen? That's not our

226
00:11:14,019 --> 00:11:19,139
purpose. Now we get to engage in that arena. We get to influence that arena, but that is

227
00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:25,979
not our main purpose. Our main purpose is to preach the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.

228
00:11:25,979 --> 00:11:33,939
I understand this morning that principles and policies matter more than personalities.

229
00:11:33,939 --> 00:11:40,979
Principles and policies matter more than personalities. Listen, we have to have the right position,

230
00:11:40,979 --> 00:11:45,959
and it's also helpful that we have the right disposition. If one of those things is going

231
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:51,479
to be out of balance, it's far better to have a right position and a wrong disposition

232
00:11:51,479 --> 00:11:57,679
than to have a right disposition with a wrong position. Did you follow that with me? And

233
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:02,239
the reality is that we want to have it in harmony. We want to have the right position,

234
00:12:02,239 --> 00:12:05,979
and we want to have the right disposition. We want people to know that we love them.

235
00:12:05,979 --> 00:12:09,159
We want people to know that we care about them, and we're giving them the gospel because

236
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:14,039
we love them. Yes, we've been instructed to do so, but I don't want to be ugly about it.

237
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:19,839
I want to be gracious about it. Let me say this. There will never be a candidate that

238
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:29,239
aligns with you 100%. Never. You don't agree with yourself 100% of the time. Amen? What

239
00:12:29,239 --> 00:12:36,159
do you want for dinner? Just think about it. You don't agree with yourself 100% of the

240
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:45,839
As Christians, as followers of the Lord Jesus Christ, we must no longer allow politicians

241
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:55,959
to take biblical matters and politicize them. Then they demand that we as the people of

242
00:12:55,959 --> 00:13:05,679
God not speak up with the threat of being labeled a bigot or worse. Can I tell you?

243
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:13,799
We've got to talk about the Bible. What's happened in our nation is politicians have

244
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:20,159
taken biblical truth and they've politicized it. Then they've told us as Christians you

245
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:26,499
don't belong in the political arena, and therefore you can't talk about it because we're going

246
00:13:26,499 --> 00:13:32,079
to label you as, and we're going to cancel you as, and so on and so forth. But the reality

247
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:41,159
is that they're biblical principles. A bigot is defined as a person who is obstinately

248
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:47,559
or unreasonably attached to a belief, opinion, or fraction. Listen, I am absolutely attached

249
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:53,839
to this book. We have been called as Baptists throughout the centuries. We've been called

250
00:13:53,839 --> 00:14:02,319
people of the book. That's a compliment. It's a compliment. And listen, we must understand

251
00:14:02,319 --> 00:14:09,239
this morning, we must remember this morning that this truth of speaking on biblical matters

252
00:14:09,239 --> 00:14:19,279
and biblical principles is absolutely imperative. Our world is blind. Our world has been blinded

253
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:23,959
by the enemy. I want to read to you a quote. It's not going to be on the screen there,

254
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:29,619
but in 1983 Howard Hendricks said this, and if it was true in 1983, it's so much more

255
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:34,919
true today. He said this, in a midst of a generation, or in the midst of a generation

256
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:43,799
screaming for answers, Christians are stuttering. Think about that just for a moment. They're

257
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:50,079
screaming for answers. Listen, our world is confused. Our world has no absolute truth

258
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:57,119
because they've made themselves the authority. And when you don't have an absolute truth,

259
00:14:57,119 --> 00:15:02,299
when you enter into an arena of just do what makes you feel good and you redefine terms

260
00:15:02,299 --> 00:15:11,639
and you have no boundaries, then you end up with what we're dealing with in America today.

261
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:15,279
Christians can no longer stutter. We must know why we believe what we believe and be

262
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:20,959
able to speak it in love. We must be able to articulate our position. We must be able

263
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:24,799
to speak on these matters. We've been given the responsibility, I'm going to say it one

264
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:31,639
more time, to preach the gospel to a lost and dying world. Understand with me this morning

265
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:41,599
that those with a different view are our mission field. They're not our enemy. Let me remind

266
00:15:41,599 --> 00:15:50,879
you of something. Saul considered David his enemy continually. But David did not consider

267
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:58,599
Saul his enemy. I don't have time to develop all of that this morning, but I hope you can

268
00:15:58,599 --> 00:16:05,879
be mindful. Listen, Saul was hunting David to kill him. He made David his enemy continually.

269
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:12,159
But David never viewed Saul as his enemy. He said, why do you come out to fight against

270
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:20,079
us? I mean, he understood that Saul was anointed to be the king. And this morning, we must

271
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:24,799
understand that those with a different view, they're not our enemy. You say, but they've

272
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:29,039
made…they're our mission field. The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit

273
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:33,039
of God. For their foolishness unto him, neither can he know them, because they're spiritually

274
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:37,599
discerned. 1 Corinthians 2 and verse 14. So let me give you some biblical principles

275
00:16:37,599 --> 00:16:41,759
for casting your vote. If you're taking notes this morning, I only have two points, but

276
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:47,199
they're two very long points. All right? Number one this morning, biblical principles for

277
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:51,159
casting your vote. I used that first slide. I'm going to show it again at the end of

278
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:55,999
the presentation this morning. But the first slide was a picture of an open Bible and a

279
00:16:55,999 --> 00:17:01,279
picture with an American flag and an individual casting a ballot. And I say this, that there

280
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:08,439
are biblical principles that must influence and impact how we cast our ballot. Know the

281
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:15,339
issues and study your Bible. Don't go reading all of these political things and listening

282
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:21,499
to all these politicians. No. Get into your Bible, because your Bible is the authority.

283
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:25,199
Let me mention, I'm going to mention a number of things this morning that are matters that

284
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,859
we must consider. Number one, the matter of life. Do you understand this morning that

285
00:17:29,859 --> 00:17:38,339
they have made life a political issue, but life is a biblical issue? God is the author

286
00:17:38,339 --> 00:17:44,619
and giver of life. We find that the Bible tells us in Psalm 139 and verse 14, I will

287
00:17:44,619 --> 00:17:49,979
praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Marvelous are thy works, and that my

288
00:17:49,979 --> 00:17:56,539
soul knoweth right well. Verse 15, my substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret

289
00:17:56,539 --> 00:18:02,419
and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth. And then verse 16, it says this,

290
00:18:02,419 --> 00:18:08,619
thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect. And in my book all my members were

291
00:18:08,619 --> 00:18:15,859
written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them. What a

292
00:18:15,859 --> 00:18:22,679
marvelous passage of Scripture dealing with the sanctity of life and understanding that

293
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:28,719
our God is the giver of life. The subject of abortion is all over our map today. It's

294
00:18:28,719 --> 00:18:35,079
all over. There's individuals that are just fighting for up until the very last moment

295
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:40,459
that they could kill a baby. It's so sad. And all they want to talk about is, well,

296
00:18:40,459 --> 00:18:47,479
it's a choice, and it's a choice. And no, it's not a choice, it's a human being. And

297
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:53,959
God is the giver of life. And we have to understand this morning that this is not a political

298
00:18:53,959 --> 00:19:00,439
issue, it is a biblical issue. Jeremiah 1 and verse number 5, the Bible says this, sorry,

299
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:05,319
I think I'm on Exodus 21, sorry. Exodus 21, notice in verse number 22 it says, if men

300
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:10,639
strive and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief

301
00:19:10,639 --> 00:19:14,079
follow. Now do you understand the language here? What's happening is there are men that

302
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:20,839
are fighting, they hurt a woman that's expecting, her fruit depart, she has the baby. But it

303
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:27,839
says here that there's no mischief to follow. In other words, the baby survives. The baby

304
00:19:28,399 --> 00:19:33,119
survives. The Bible goes on to say, he shall be surely punished according as the woman's

305
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:39,359
husband will lay upon him, and he shall pay as the judges determine. But verse 23 says

306
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:46,159
and if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life. What does it mean if any

307
00:19:46,159 --> 00:19:52,139
mischief follow? It means if the baby dies. That's what it means. And so if two people

308
00:19:52,139 --> 00:19:57,359
are fighting and there's a woman that's expecting that's there, and that woman gets hurt in

309
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:00,239
the fight, and her baby is born.

310
00:20:00,239 --> 00:20:02,559
and there's no mischief, there's still a consequence,

311
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,279
there's still a price to be paid,

312
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:09,279
but if the baby dies, God says life for life.

313
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:16,199
The Bible tells us in Proverbs 6 and verses 16 and 17,

314
00:20:16,199 --> 00:20:18,119
these six things doth the Lord hate,

315
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:20,359
yea, seven are an abomination unto him,

316
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:21,959
a proud look, a lying tongue,

317
00:20:21,959 --> 00:20:25,979
and notice, and hands that shed innocent blood.

318
00:20:25,979 --> 00:20:28,239
If there's ever a description of abortion

319
00:20:28,259 --> 00:20:29,859
that I can find in the Bible,

320
00:20:29,859 --> 00:20:32,979
it's hands that shed innocent blood.

321
00:20:35,619 --> 00:20:38,219
I believe with my whole heart this morning

322
00:20:38,219 --> 00:20:40,039
that if we could deal with the subject

323
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:42,219
of fornication in our society,

324
00:20:42,219 --> 00:20:44,219
it would go a long way to dealing with the subject

325
00:20:44,219 --> 00:20:46,179
of abortion in our society.

326
00:20:47,299 --> 00:20:51,699
We live in a loose living, sexualized society,

327
00:20:51,699 --> 00:20:54,339
and therefore abortion is the byproduct,

328
00:20:54,339 --> 00:20:57,259
I don't want that consequence, I don't want that result.

329
00:20:58,199 --> 00:21:00,199
Righteousness exalteth a nation,

330
00:21:00,199 --> 00:21:02,479
but sin is a reproach to any people.

331
00:21:02,479 --> 00:21:05,919
Consider with me this morning the matter of gender,

332
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,439
the matter of gender.

333
00:21:07,439 --> 00:21:09,799
God said this in Genesis 1 and verse 27,

334
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:11,279
so God created man in his own image,

335
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:12,899
in the image of God created he him,

336
00:21:12,899 --> 00:21:15,079
male and female created he them.

337
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:16,759
In Matthew 9 and verse number four,

338
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:18,119
and he answered and said unto them,

339
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:20,779
have ye not read that he which made them at the beginning

340
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,319
made them male and female?

341
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:24,599
We're living in a society today,

342
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:26,859
listen, I don't know how you think about this,

343
00:21:26,859 --> 00:21:28,279
I don't know how you feel about this,

344
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:30,919
but for me, when I begin to look at some of these things

345
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:32,999
that are going on, I shake my head and say,

346
00:21:32,999 --> 00:21:36,359
how in the world did we get here?

347
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:37,919
How did we get here?

348
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:41,059
The slippery slope of sin.

349
00:21:43,379 --> 00:21:45,219
They did not want to acknowledge God,

350
00:21:45,219 --> 00:21:46,699
Romans chapter number one,

351
00:21:46,699 --> 00:21:49,599
and God gave them over to a reprobate mind.

352
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:53,039
And we find this morning that we're living in the midst,

353
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:56,039
listen, they don't know, they say you can figure it out

354
00:21:56,099 --> 00:21:59,279
at some point, no, no, we know if you're a male or a female.

355
00:22:00,339 --> 00:22:04,419
It's absolutely obvious and easy to identify.

356
00:22:04,419 --> 00:22:07,339
This idea of allowing people to think

357
00:22:07,339 --> 00:22:09,939
that they're something else and to participate in sports

358
00:22:09,939 --> 00:22:14,419
and all the others, it's nonsense, it's against God.

359
00:22:14,419 --> 00:22:16,939
And it's against his order.

360
00:22:16,939 --> 00:22:20,299
The subject of gender is not a political subject.

361
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:22,779
It's biblical.

362
00:22:22,779 --> 00:22:24,759
God is the author and giver of life,

363
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:28,579
and he's the one that determined your gender.

364
00:22:28,579 --> 00:22:30,679
And by the way, I'm thankful for it.

365
00:22:33,579 --> 00:22:35,359
Notice with me, consider number three,

366
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:37,639
the matter of marriage.

367
00:22:37,639 --> 00:22:39,719
God instituted marriage.

368
00:22:39,719 --> 00:22:42,919
God instructed, gave instruction for marriage

369
00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:44,699
in Genesis two and verse 24.

370
00:22:44,699 --> 00:22:47,019
Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother

371
00:22:47,019 --> 00:22:51,899
and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh.

372
00:22:51,899 --> 00:22:53,379
The subject of marriage.

373
00:22:55,599 --> 00:23:00,599
As a nation, we bought into the lie that love is love.

374
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:02,259
It's such a catchphrase today.

375
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,719
Whatever makes you happy, no, God defined.

376
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,079
God gave the truth.

377
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:12,239
And it's important this morning that we understand

378
00:23:12,239 --> 00:23:15,599
that the matter of marriage is settled by God,

379
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:18,679
not by politicians, it's settled by God.

380
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:20,519
Let me say this, the matter of family.

381
00:23:20,519 --> 00:23:24,519
God designed the family, and we find that the family

382
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:27,959
has been designed by God, it's been defined by God,

383
00:23:27,959 --> 00:23:30,719
and God has directed the family.

384
00:23:30,719 --> 00:23:34,679
How do we operate as husband, as wife, as children?

385
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:38,279
Understand with me this morning that there is an effort

386
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:42,619
to destroy the nuclear family structure as we've known it.

387
00:23:42,619 --> 00:23:47,199
That term nuclear family refers to a man and a woman

388
00:23:47,199 --> 00:23:51,239
that marry and have children and live in a home.

389
00:23:51,239 --> 00:23:53,799
And that's the idea of a nuclear family.

390
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:56,759
And this morning, they have distorted that,

391
00:23:56,759 --> 00:23:59,599
they have tried to break that down.

392
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:02,639
Can I tell you that those are the truths

393
00:24:02,639 --> 00:24:04,239
of the backbone of our society

394
00:24:04,239 --> 00:24:06,199
that made America what it is?

395
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:12,399
It's the enemy, it's Satan that wants to attack

396
00:24:12,399 --> 00:24:17,399
what God instituted and to attack what God has designed,

397
00:24:17,639 --> 00:24:20,599
and we find that happening in the family.

398
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:23,239
And it's so sad to see what's happening in our society

399
00:24:23,559 --> 00:24:25,160
today with regard to the family.

400
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,399
I want you to think about the matter of justice,

401
00:24:29,399 --> 00:24:30,479
the matter of justice.

402
00:24:30,479 --> 00:24:32,720
You say that we live, you're familiar with this,

403
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,199
the lady justice is supposed to be blindfolded.

404
00:24:36,199 --> 00:24:39,720
And we find that today, we live in a time in which

405
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:43,839
there's, we could say that the justice is corrupt.

406
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:46,519
And we don't have to, we're not exaggerating

407
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:48,079
by saying that this morning,

408
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:51,399
but we understand the importance of justice.

409
00:24:51,399 --> 00:24:54,759
The Bible says this, righteous art thou, O Lord,

410
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:59,759
and upright are thy judgments, in Psalm 119, in verse 137.

411
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:03,679
In Isaiah 59, in verses 14 and 15,

412
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,239
there's an indictment that is made,

413
00:25:05,239 --> 00:25:06,599
the Bible says in verse 14,

414
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:08,679
and judgment is turned away backward,

415
00:25:08,679 --> 00:25:10,559
and justice standeth afar off,

416
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,319
for truth is fallen in the street,

417
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:15,319
and equity cannot enter.

418
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:17,919
Verse number 15, the Bible says this,

419
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:20,799
yea, truth falleth, faileth, excuse me,

420
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:24,119
and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey,

421
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:27,119
and the Lord saw it, and it displeased him

422
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:30,179
that there was no judgment.

423
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,279
Sad.

424
00:25:33,479 --> 00:25:36,440
Our God is a righteous, just God.

425
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:42,319
There is right, and there is wrong.

426
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:44,799
There is good, and there is evil.

427
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,880
And God is the one that defines that.

428
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,359
Isaiah deals with it.

429
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:51,599
The Bible says that they were saying

430
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:53,079
that that which was good is evil,

431
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:54,299
and that which is evil is good.

432
00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:56,839
That's what's happening in our society today.

433
00:25:56,839 --> 00:25:57,959
We see it.

434
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:01,519
And we begin to think about biblical principles

435
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:03,000
for casting our votes,

436
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,440
and we're gonna go stand at a ballot box,

437
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,919
and we're gonna cast a vote,

438
00:26:06,919 --> 00:26:10,759
and these things that our politicians have tried to take

439
00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:12,319
and politicize them,

440
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:15,539
we must acknowledge that they're biblical matters.

441
00:26:16,399 --> 00:26:19,199
The Bible tells us in Leviticus 19, in verse number 15,

442
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:21,919
he shall do no unrighteousness in judgment.

443
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:24,599
Thou shalt not respect the person of the poor,

444
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:26,399
nor honor the person of the mighty,

445
00:26:26,399 --> 00:26:30,079
but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbor.

446
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,399
In righteousness thou shalt judge thy neighbor.

447
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,319
We find this matter of justice again

448
00:26:37,319 --> 00:26:42,319
living in a corrupt society with corrupt justice system.

449
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:46,299
And we begin to understand the authority of those

450
00:26:46,299 --> 00:26:48,539
that are elected in the positions

451
00:26:48,579 --> 00:26:50,220
in which they're able to fill

452
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:53,019
and how it affects our justice department.

453
00:26:54,299 --> 00:26:56,339
It's important that we understand this.

454
00:26:57,899 --> 00:26:59,139
I want you to think about this one,

455
00:26:59,139 --> 00:27:01,259
the matter of partiality.

456
00:27:01,259 --> 00:27:03,899
Today, many people wanna use the word racism,

457
00:27:03,899 --> 00:27:05,299
and I understand the term,

458
00:27:05,299 --> 00:27:07,299
and I understand why they use it.

459
00:27:07,299 --> 00:27:11,299
I use the word partiality because it's a Bible word,

460
00:27:11,299 --> 00:27:15,699
and I believe that partiality defines much clearer

461
00:27:15,699 --> 00:27:17,639
the subject than just racism,

462
00:27:17,639 --> 00:27:20,399
because partiality can be done

463
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:24,039
without race being even in the conversation.

464
00:27:24,039 --> 00:27:26,119
You can be partial towards someone

465
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:28,079
because of their economic status,

466
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:31,160
though they are the same race as you are

467
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:34,959
from that perspective of what they have

468
00:27:34,959 --> 00:27:38,000
as race being their calling card.

469
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,500
You can have prejudice or partiality towards someone

470
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:45,199
because of their religious identification.

471
00:27:45,199 --> 00:27:47,479
We see this all around the globe, by the way.

472
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:49,919
You see it over in Asia,

473
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,039
and you see it in Africa, the Middle East.

474
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:54,759
You see people that have all of this partiality

475
00:27:54,759 --> 00:27:59,319
based on the economic status

476
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:01,720
and the religious identification,

477
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,639
and they all have the same skin color,

478
00:28:04,639 --> 00:28:07,759
but they're partial, they're partial.

479
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:09,799
So the Bible says this in Acts 17,

480
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:12,319
and it's so important that we understand this this morning,

481
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:17,079
and hath made of one blood all nations of men

482
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:18,919
for to dwell in all the face of the earth

483
00:28:18,919 --> 00:28:21,000
and hath determined the times before appointed

484
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,839
and the bounds of their habitation.

485
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:25,519
James 2, verses eight and nine, the Bible says this.

486
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:28,319
If you fulfill the royal law according to the scripture,

487
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:31,399
thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself, ye do well.

488
00:28:31,399 --> 00:28:33,760
But if you have respect to persons,

489
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:38,760
ye commit sin and are convinced of the law as transgressors.

490
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,119
This thing of partiality is important

491
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:44,399
that we understand as biblical people.

492
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:47,119
Can I help you understand an important truth

493
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:49,679
that so many have missed, I believe, today,

494
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:50,839
and that is this.

495
00:28:50,839 --> 00:28:53,080
Darwinian evolution ideology

496
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:56,419
promotes further perpetuates partiality.

497
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:00,080
I put up here on a screen a picture of the book

498
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,479
that Darwin wrote.

499
00:29:01,479 --> 00:29:04,039
Many of you would know it by the name

500
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:06,399
On the Origin of Species,

501
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:09,080
and really that's the only title that they want us today

502
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,520
to really be aware of,

503
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:13,119
but I want you to understand the full title of that book

504
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:17,320
goes on to say, or the preservation of favored races

505
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,679
in the struggle of life.

506
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:20,799
That's the full title of the book.

507
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:22,799
You look at me like it's strange, I didn't make that up.

508
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,399
It's the full title of the book.

509
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,039
Wow is right, because Darwinian evolution

510
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:31,799
permeates our society.

511
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,559
And Darwinian evolution ideology

512
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:37,119
not only permeates our society,

513
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:39,200
but it influences our perspective,

514
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,580
and it changes how we approach things.

515
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,859
Listen, the second book that he wrote,

516
00:29:43,859 --> 00:29:45,140
The Descent of Man,

517
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:47,219
I didn't take a picture of that one and put it there,

518
00:29:47,219 --> 00:29:49,619
but I'm telling you that Darwinian evolution

519
00:29:49,619 --> 00:29:54,039
is a major, major contributing factor to this subject.

520
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:58,219
I was blown away when I visited England several years ago,

521
00:29:58,219 --> 00:30:00,820
and some of you have been to England, you know this.

522
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:04,000
but when I was in England, I was absolutely blown away

523
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,140
by the fact that while I was there,

524
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:09,740
that I got some pounds, and when I got the pounds,

525
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:12,560
that Charles Darwin is on one of their notes.

526
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,140
We have folks on our notes,

527
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:17,060
and we talk about the presidents that are on the notes,

528
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:19,180
and so on and so forth, on our paper bills,

529
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:21,080
and even on our coins, and one of those,

530
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,840
I think it was a 10, a British pound, a 10 currency,

531
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:28,500
and it had Charles Darwin's face on that bill.

532
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,540
It's sad.

533
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,120
Can I tell you this?

534
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:38,540
Partiality existed way before Charles Darwin, okay?

535
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,220
Just as it said in James two and verse number nine,

536
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:46,920
the truth of being in sin if you show partiality,

537
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:52,820
partiality in racism, it's sinful, it's wicked.

538
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,020
It's been going on for centuries.

539
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,460
Jesus was the one that said in John four,

540
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,820
thy must needs go through Samaria.

541
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,280
Why did he have to go through Samaria?

542
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,220
Why does that interaction take place?

543
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:06,700
Well, because the Jewish people hated the Samaritans.

544
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,600
They were partial towards them,

545
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:14,460
and Jesus was showing them that we're all of one blood.

546
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:17,140
Jesus further said in Acts one and verse number eight,

547
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:20,660
ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, Judea,

548
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,940
help me, Samaria.

549
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,100
Why did he say Samaria?

550
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,700
Why do you think he said Samaria?

551
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,440
Because he's talking to Jewish people,

552
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,500
and they had to know that the Samaritans

553
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,940
also had to hear the gospel.

554
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:36,380
As much as Darwinian evolution ideology

555
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:41,060
further perpetuates the idea of partiality,

556
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,020
I mention this.

557
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:44,460
Listen, it existed before Charles Darwin,

558
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:48,180
but at the time of Charles Darwin and his prominence

559
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:50,540
and all that he did, can I tell you what happened?

560
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:52,980
All of a sudden, especially men like Adolf Hitler

561
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:56,300
and others, they took and they ran with the fact

562
00:31:56,300 --> 00:32:00,700
that now science and biology supports my wicked heart

563
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:05,700
and my agenda to be able to have this perspective

564
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:08,260
and to kill masses of people.

565
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:12,140
Until then, partiality existed,

566
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:15,480
but now all of a sudden, it could be justified

567
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,780
in the wicked hearts of mankind

568
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:20,300
because science supports it.

569
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,460
No, science doesn't.

570
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:24,020
We're all of one blood.

571
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,460
I'm thankful for that.

572
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:28,980
God created man in his own image.

573
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:32,800
As much as we find that Darwinian evolution perpetuates,

574
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,740
I want you to understand that the Bible,

575
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,960
that the gospel and biblical Christianity is the answer.

576
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,900
Why is it the answer?

577
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:41,700
Well, notice he said in Mark 16 and verse 15,

578
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,580
and he said unto them, go ye into all the world

579
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:47,580
and preach the gospel to every creature.

580
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,060
We find that the Bible tells us

581
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:51,380
in the book of Colossians chapter three

582
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,100
and verse number 11, where there's neither Greek nor Jew,

583
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,740
circumcision nor uncircumcision,

584
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,840
barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free,

585
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,100
but Christ is all and in all.

586
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,020
What's he talking about?

587
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,100
In the church, listen, we're made up

588
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:05,980
of different nationalities or backgrounds,

589
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:08,100
but we're saved by the blood of Christ

590
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:12,080
and we're brothers and sisters in Christ.

591
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,720
The gospel of Jesus Christ and the truth

592
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,720
of biblical Christianity will absolutely

593
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,860
be the answer to partiality.

594
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,700
I wanna remind you that in the book of Revelation

595
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,260
chapter five and verse number nine,

596
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:26,340
the Bible says they sang a new song

597
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,220
and here's what they said.

598
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:29,140
Thou art worthy to take the book

599
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:32,100
and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain

600
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,660
and has redeemed us to God by thy blood

601
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:37,340
out of notice every kindred and tongue

602
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:39,900
and people and nation.

603
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,540
Hallelujah.

604
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,940
I love our church.

605
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:45,620
I mentioned this often to individuals

606
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:47,580
about the diversity of our church.

607
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,140
I absolutely love it.

608
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,540
I don't know today as we'd go around

609
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:54,340
and determine where people are originally from,

610
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,700
there'd be a number of nations that are represented

611
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,520
and I love that.

612
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,520
You know why I love it so much?

613
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,740
That's what heaven's gonna be like.

614
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,560
That's what heaven's gonna be like.

615
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:05,580
The gospel in biblical Christianity

616
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,780
is the answer for partiality.

617
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:11,380
Listen, our world is trying to use this thing

618
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:14,380
of partiality specifically in America

619
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:18,580
of racism to divide, to cause hatred

620
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:22,339
and we must understand that the Bible speaks on this.

621
00:34:22,339 --> 00:34:23,420
The Bible speaks on this.

622
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:25,020
It's not a political issue.

623
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:27,460
Think about this, the matter of,

624
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:28,619
this is the last one I'm gonna deal with,

625
00:34:28,619 --> 00:34:30,580
the matter of debt.

626
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:32,880
You know how in debt we are as a nation?

627
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,740
It's absolutely sickening how in debt we are

628
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:39,260
and here's what the Bible says in Proverbs 22 in verse seven,

629
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,460
the rich ruleth over the poor

630
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:44,260
and the borrower is servant to the lender.

631
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:48,660
As a nation, I'm gonna put up some numbers here

632
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:50,220
and it's hard for us to understand these

633
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:55,220
but as a nation, our current debt is nearing $36 trillion.

634
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,240
That's a lot of money.

635
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,380
To be honest with you, Ron,

636
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,860
I can't even think about that kind of number.

637
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,179
I don't even know how many zeros there are.

638
00:35:02,179 --> 00:35:03,940
Actually, I was working on it this week

639
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:04,779
trying to figure it out.

640
00:35:04,779 --> 00:35:07,020
I was trying to do math on these numbers

641
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,300
and you know what the calculator did?

642
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,700
Error.

643
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:12,700
There ain't enough space on the calculator.

644
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,660
36 trillion is what we're nearing.

645
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:18,619
This year alone, $892 billion to pay

646
00:35:18,619 --> 00:35:20,740
just for the interest of our debt

647
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:24,040
and for some reason, we can't help people

648
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,460
that were devastated by a hurricane.

649
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,220
You understand what I'm saying?

650
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:33,960
They made it political but there's a biblical truth

651
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,100
that the borrower is servant to the lender

652
00:35:37,279 --> 00:35:39,920
and we need some fiscal responsibility.

653
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,200
Listen, how does it work in your home?

654
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:46,679
You have to be responsible to pay your bills.

655
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:47,600
How does it work as a church?

656
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,440
Why do we have a budget as a church?

657
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,080
Why don't we just spend and spend and spend

658
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,399
and borrow and borrow and borrow

659
00:35:53,399 --> 00:35:54,440
and spend and spend and spend?

660
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:57,600
No, we have to be fiscally responsible.

661
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,700
In my home, I have to be fiscally responsible.

662
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,720
Has there ever been a situation where you said in your home,

663
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:04,360
hey, we don't have the money to do this.

664
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:07,080
We can't afford this right now.

665
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:07,920
Why?

666
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,279
Because you're being fiscally responsible.

667
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:16,040
As a nation, we've got out of control with debt.

668
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,000
Here's an interesting calculation.

669
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,679
If you suppose that every $1 equals one minute,

670
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:26,839
that equals 68,493 years.

671
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:30,399
If we could talk about our debt in terms of time

672
00:36:30,399 --> 00:36:33,080
because 36 trillion is so, 68,000 years,

673
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,820
that's 10 times, almost 10 times

674
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,559
as long as the earth's been around.

675
00:36:37,559 --> 00:36:38,520
Unbelievable.

676
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,440
I want you to understand this morning

677
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,320
that these matters are biblical matters.

678
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,740
But all of these matters that I touched on,

679
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,040
they've tried to politicize.

680
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,200
It's not an exhaustive list.

681
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,980
Can I tell you that Israel is a biblical matter?

682
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,960
It's not a political issue, it's a biblical issue.

683
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,040
Amen?

684
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,660
Can I tell you that borders, immigration,

685
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:01,700
you start talking, they're all,

686
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:04,160
listen, I don't have time in one service

687
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,460
to deal with all of it, but you have a Bible.

688
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,380
Go home and study your Bible.

689
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:10,420
Go home and figure out the principles

690
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:12,779
that God has given us that are to influence

691
00:37:12,779 --> 00:37:16,420
how we cast our ballot because if we're Bible believers,

692
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:20,760
then the Bible has to influence every part of me.

693
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,820
Not just Sunday morning, not just Sunday night,

694
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:27,059
not just Wednesday night, but every part of me

695
00:37:27,059 --> 00:37:30,740
is impacted and affected because I am a child of God,

696
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:33,480
I'm a follower of Jesus Christ.

697
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:37,440
Now, let me change gears just for a moment

698
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,440
and deal with this second.

699
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,000
I told you my points were long.

700
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,360
Number two this morning, biblical principles

701
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:46,440
to cope with election results.

702
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,960
You say, pastor, why are you dealing with this?

703
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,960
Well, because my head's not in the sand.

704
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,080
My head's not in the sand and I've heard people

705
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:59,080
for years discussing whether there's election interference,

706
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,800
election fraud, and so on and so forth,

707
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:05,480
whatever term you wanna use, I've heard many of them

708
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:10,000
and I'm aware of how some have taken that perspective.

709
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,720
But I want you to understand that there are

710
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:14,080
biblical principles that we must be aware of

711
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:17,460
that will help me cope with the results of an election.

712
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,320
Can I remind you this morning that there are some things

713
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:24,399
that are outside of your control and there are some things

714
00:38:24,399 --> 00:38:27,480
that are outside of my control, but there's absolutely

715
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,899
nothing outside of the control of my God.

716
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,359
Nothing is outside of his control.

717
00:38:34,359 --> 00:38:37,600
So we must remember this morning that all things

718
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:41,600
are within the control of God.

719
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,780
And I can rejoice in that.

720
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:45,400
Listen, if I had to sit around and worry about

721
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,419
all the things that some of you have shared with me

722
00:38:47,419 --> 00:38:49,640
about election fraud, interference, and all that stuff,

723
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,880
I'd have less hair than I have.

724
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:54,640
I'd have more, if I had any more, it'd be gray.

725
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,039
I'd be worried all the time.

726
00:38:56,039 --> 00:38:57,799
I'd have all kinds of, but listen,

727
00:38:57,799 --> 00:38:59,359
I don't have to worry about it.

728
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:05,200
I told you last week about the friends, the niece of Jackie

729
00:39:05,239 --> 00:39:08,400
who told me about in Washington State, you have to write

730
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,799
the particular party of the vote that you're casting

731
00:39:12,799 --> 00:39:16,440
on the outside of the envelope before you mail it in.

732
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,640
And here's what I told her when she shared that with me.

733
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,840
I said, listen, if I didn't know Jesus,

734
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,400
if I didn't know God, it would drive me insane

735
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,900
to think about those things that are going on.

736
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,619
But I know God.

737
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:30,220
I know God.

738
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:31,179
And he gave me a peace.

739
00:39:31,179 --> 00:39:33,340
I was reading this morning in John 14,

740
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:35,960
where Jesus said, my peace I give unto you.

741
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,739
Not as the world giveth.

742
00:39:37,739 --> 00:39:39,220
Man, I have the peace of God

743
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:41,460
which passeth all understanding.

744
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:44,760
Can I remind you this morning that when we talk about

745
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,739
these election things and we talk about interference

746
00:39:47,739 --> 00:39:49,080
and fraud and all of those things,

747
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,220
we're looking just at this plane.

748
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:52,619
We're looking at the temporal.

749
00:39:52,619 --> 00:39:55,940
We're removing the eternal God who's in control.

750
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,820
And we're saying, listen, it's not fair.

751
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:59,780
That's what people want to say.

752
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:00,979
Can I remind you of the.

753
00:40:00,979 --> 00:40:11,239
trial that Jesus had? Was it fair? Can I remind you of the trial that Stephen had? Was it

754
00:40:11,239 --> 00:40:18,859
fair? But God was in control. Can I tell you this? There are some times I believe with

755
00:40:18,859 --> 00:40:29,899
all my heart that sometimes a way, a way, that God judges a nation is through its leadership.

756
00:40:29,899 --> 00:40:33,939
So how do I cope? What are some biblical principles? Number one, let me give you this verse. I'll

757
00:40:33,939 --> 00:40:36,819
share some things here in just a moment, but let me give you a couple of verses. Psalm

758
00:40:36,819 --> 00:40:43,219
75, verses 6 and 7. For promotion cometh neither from the east nor from the west nor from the

759
00:40:43,219 --> 00:40:52,219
south. But God is the judge. Notice this. He putteth down one and setteth up another.

760
00:40:52,219 --> 00:40:57,239
So really it comes down to this. Do we believe the Bible? Do we believe these verses of Scripture?

761
00:40:57,239 --> 00:41:01,439
Do we believe that God's in control? Let me remind you of Daniel 4 and verse 17. The

762
00:41:01,439 --> 00:41:06,419
Bible says this matter is by the decree of the watchers and the demand by the word of

763
00:41:06,419 --> 00:41:12,279
the holy ones to the intent that the living may know. What is it that the living may know?

764
00:41:12,279 --> 00:41:17,759
That the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men and giveth it to whomsoever He will and

765
00:41:17,759 --> 00:41:26,519
setteth up over it the basest of men. The question is do we believe the Bible? He said

766
00:41:26,519 --> 00:41:32,439
in Daniel 4, 17 that the living may know. As far as I know, we're all still alive here

767
00:41:32,439 --> 00:41:40,399
this morning. And that the living may know what? That the Most High ruleth in the kingdom

768
00:41:40,399 --> 00:41:47,279
of men. Listen, God did not create and then take His hands off. God is still very much

769
00:41:47,279 --> 00:41:52,999
involved in the affairs of mankind. God is still a very present help in the time of trouble.

770
00:41:52,999 --> 00:41:58,519
I'm thankful that God did not just remove His hands after creation, but that He withholds

771
00:41:58,519 --> 00:42:03,559
all things by the power of His hand and that He's involved. He knows. Listen, if it wasn't

772
00:42:03,559 --> 00:42:08,679
the truth, then prayer would never have been given to us to pray to the God who's able

773
00:42:08,679 --> 00:42:13,199
to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think. But He gave us prayer because

774
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:21,399
He's actively involved in the affairs of mankind. Notice this truth in Proverbs 21 and verse

775
00:42:21,399 --> 00:42:28,679
number 1, the King's heart is in the hand of the Lord. As the rivers of water, He turneth

776
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:36,399
it, the King's heart, whithersoever He will. So the question basically is this this morning,

777
00:42:36,399 --> 00:42:44,999
do we believe God? Do we believe God? Do we believe that in 2024 that God is still on

778
00:42:44,999 --> 00:42:50,839
His throne? Do we believe in 2024 that God still has a plan and that God is still able,

779
00:42:51,239 --> 00:42:57,479
listen, whoever you want to accuse of whatever you want to accuse them of with regard to the

780
00:42:57,479 --> 00:43:01,639
results of an election, I want to remind you that God's in control. Here's the thing that's

781
00:43:01,639 --> 00:43:06,119
important for us to understand. There were people that tried to bring me, I mean, I had

782
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:11,399
videos sent to me in 2020 and I had documents printed out and sent to me in 2020. I had

783
00:43:11,399 --> 00:43:15,879
videos, Bart, that were, I mean, like 40 hours long of videos. I ain't watching them, man.

784
00:43:16,839 --> 00:43:21,279
I don't have time for that. I'm just being honest with you. You say, I watched every

785
00:43:21,279 --> 00:43:26,059
single one of them. I'm sorry. I'm being honest. I'm sorry. Because what it did is it messed

786
00:43:26,059 --> 00:43:34,919
with your head. And it caused you to not have a right view of God. Because even if all that

787
00:43:34,919 --> 00:43:42,959
stuff happened, you know what the bottom line is? God allowed it to happen. God allowed

788
00:43:42,959 --> 00:43:49,319
it to happen. And we must acknowledge that this morning. So, what do we do? How do we

789
00:43:49,319 --> 00:43:54,519
respond? How is it that we can cope with the results of an election? See, the reality is

790
00:43:54,519 --> 00:44:01,479
that in America, elections have boiled down basically to two individuals or two parties.

791
00:44:01,479 --> 00:44:09,899
Okay? And so, I'm not here to say how or who or any of that sort of thing. I'm simply giving

792
00:44:09,939 --> 00:44:15,659
you biblical principles. I think that as we study our Bibles, we have an individual responsibility.

793
00:44:15,659 --> 00:44:19,499
But the reality is that the one that has to be able to cope with the election results

794
00:44:19,499 --> 00:44:24,959
is the one that's in that situation. They're going to begin to look at some of these things

795
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:28,919
and maybe their particular candidate didn't win and they wanted them to or whatever the

796
00:44:28,919 --> 00:44:33,659
case may be. But I have to acknowledge that God's on His throne, that God's in control.

797
00:44:33,659 --> 00:44:41,259
And therefore, number one, I trust the Lord. I trust the Lord. Can I tell you this morning,

798
00:44:41,259 --> 00:44:51,339
can I remind you this morning, that as Bible believers, our hope is not in the White House.

799
00:44:51,339 --> 00:45:02,379
Sometimes I fear that we say that but don't really believe that. Our hope is not in the

800
00:45:02,379 --> 00:45:07,539
White House. Our hope is not in the State House. Our hope is not in Wall Street. Our

801
00:45:07,539 --> 00:45:16,719
hope is in Jesus Christ, who is King of Kings. And for that, we trust Him. We trust Him.

802
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:21,579
We come to that place where we say, I'm trusting the Lord, that His plan is perfect, that He

803
00:45:21,579 --> 00:45:29,559
knows what He is doing. Blessed, in Psalm 2, in verse number 12, blessed are all they

804
00:45:29,719 --> 00:45:36,679
that put their trust in Him. Psalm 20, in verse number 7, some trust in chariots and

805
00:45:36,679 --> 00:45:45,959
some in horses, but we will remember the name of the Lord our God. Listen, don't be putting

806
00:45:45,959 --> 00:45:50,719
your trust and confidence in the wrong thing. Isaiah talks about the fact that they were

807
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:56,319
trusting in Egypt. That's the picture of the world. They weren't trusting the living God.

808
00:45:56,319 --> 00:46:00,039
They were trusting in Egypt. Jeremiah 17, in verse number 7, it says, blessed is the

809
00:46:00,039 --> 00:46:05,999
man that trusteth in the Lord and whose hope the Lord is. There was a recent, I'll just

810
00:46:05,999 --> 00:46:10,119
say this to be pretty generic about it, but in the time that I've been here, this is the

811
00:46:10,119 --> 00:46:13,879
fourth election cycle, presidential election cycle, that I've had the privilege of being

812
00:46:13,879 --> 00:46:19,839
the pastor through. And the reality is that during one of those, somebody that's not a

813
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:26,079
member of our church, never really attended our church, but a Christian worker, actually,

814
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:30,119
from another church and heavily involved in some ministry things, after the result

815
00:46:30,119 --> 00:46:35,199
of one of those elections over the four cycles that I've been here, sent an email with this

816
00:46:35,199 --> 00:46:41,999
verse of Scripture and said, we have hope because of the result of the election. And

817
00:46:41,999 --> 00:46:49,039
I was absolutely furious. And I sent the individual an email and I said, listen, we have hope

818
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:58,439
because Jesus is on His throne. Listen, if on November 6th you become depressed, your

819
00:46:58,439 --> 00:47:04,779
eyes aren't on Jesus. You're not trusting the Lord like you should be. Because regardless

820
00:47:04,779 --> 00:47:09,679
of what the result of the election is, my God's still on the throne. And my God still

821
00:47:09,679 --> 00:47:13,599
has a purpose. And my God still has a plan. And He's still going to use us. And by the

822
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:20,639
way, one day I'm going to heaven. Hallelujah. This world is not my home. I'm just a passing

823
00:47:20,639 --> 00:47:24,519
through. My treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue. That's what the songwriter

824
00:47:24,519 --> 00:47:30,239
said. And we need to start living like that. But the reality is that if we take the perspective

825
00:47:30,239 --> 00:47:38,119
that God is in control, only if my candidate wins, you are not understanding the truth

826
00:47:38,119 --> 00:47:44,879
of the Bible. You cannot say, because my candidate wins, that God is in control. And

827
00:47:44,879 --> 00:47:50,039
then if your candidate loses, you say, well, God must not be in control. They did this,

828
00:47:50,039 --> 00:47:57,239
they did… No, no, no, no, no. God is in control regardless. And we have to understand

829
00:47:57,239 --> 00:48:03,719
that. So what do I do? Number one, I trust in the Lord. Number two, I rejoice. I rejoice.

830
00:48:03,719 --> 00:48:09,979
You know what Jesus said in Luke? Those disciples came back because the spirits were made subject

831
00:48:09,979 --> 00:48:15,239
to them, and they were rejoicing, man. They saw the power of God demonstrated. And Jesus

832
00:48:15,239 --> 00:48:22,959
said this, don't rejoice in that. But rather rejoice, why? Because your names are written

833
00:48:22,959 --> 00:48:30,599
in the book. Listen, this morning, it does not matter who wins an election in this nation

834
00:48:30,599 --> 00:48:37,799
with regard to my eternity. I'm going to rejoice. Psalm 5 and verse number 11, but

835
00:48:37,799 --> 00:48:41,679
let all those that put their trust in thee, what? Rejoice. I said, number one, we must

836
00:48:41,679 --> 00:48:47,579
trust Him. But if I put my trust in Him, then I must rejoice. Let them ever shout for joy,

837
00:48:47,579 --> 00:48:52,279
because thou defendest them. Let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee. Can

838
00:48:52,279 --> 00:48:58,059
I tell you that really, if you study the church history, there has never been a nation like

839
00:48:58,059 --> 00:49:03,859
our nation that has had as much liberty and freedom for a church as we have experienced.

840
00:49:03,859 --> 00:49:11,139
And you know what's happening? We're doing less for God today than we ever have. There

841
00:49:11,139 --> 00:49:15,339
literally, last week, Brother Hummel stood in this pulpit and said, America is now in

842
00:49:15,339 --> 00:49:21,000
the place where we need missionaries to come to her. Where we used to be the number one

843
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:27,880
sending mission field of the, or mission sender of the entire world. And guess what?

844
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:32,339
England was that at one point. And if you go to England today, you find that church

845
00:49:32,339 --> 00:49:37,159
after church after church has been turned into pubs, has been turned into apartments,

846
00:49:37,159 --> 00:49:43,479
has been turned into mosques. And guess what has to happen in England? We have missionaries

847
00:49:43,479 --> 00:49:50,719
that we support from the U.S. going to England. America's not far behind. But you know what

848
00:49:50,719 --> 00:49:54,799
I'm going to do? I'm going to trust in the Lord. And I'm going to rejoice because my

849
00:49:54,799 --> 00:50:01,000
God's on His throne. And I'm going to rejoice because God is able. Listen, can I say this?

850
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,480
Number three, continue.

851
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:05,519
It's been our theme for this whole year.

852
00:50:05,519 --> 00:50:06,519
It's been our theme.

853
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:11,140
The truth of 2 Timothy 3, verses 13 and 14.

854
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:13,439
But evil men and seducers shall wax in worse and worse,

855
00:50:13,439 --> 00:50:15,140
deceiving and being deceived.

856
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,639
Isn't it interesting that God reveals that truth to us?

857
00:50:19,639 --> 00:50:21,399
And then right after revealing that truth to us

858
00:50:21,399 --> 00:50:24,340
in verse 13 says, but continue, in verse 14.

859
00:50:25,959 --> 00:50:27,879
But the evil men are waxing worse and worse.

860
00:50:27,879 --> 00:50:29,440
I mean, they're deceiving and they're being deceived.

861
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,040
I mean, it's bad, it's perilous times

862
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,040
is how it starts in chapter three in verse one.

863
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,680
And all of this is going on.

864
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:35,500
What are we supposed to do?

865
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:36,880
Continue.

866
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:37,720
Continue in what?

867
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:41,479
Continue thou in the things which thou hast learned

868
00:50:41,479 --> 00:50:44,119
and has been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast

869
00:50:44,119 --> 00:50:44,959
learned them.

870
00:50:44,959 --> 00:50:47,759
And we find that as we look at this truth,

871
00:50:47,759 --> 00:50:50,900
that we as the church of God, we must continue.

872
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:51,740
We don't give up.

873
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:52,720
We don't run for the hills.

874
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:56,959
We don't, do you remember what Jesus said in Matthew 16?

875
00:50:56,959 --> 00:50:59,299
He said, I will build my church.

876
00:51:00,139 --> 00:51:05,139
And the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.

877
00:51:05,419 --> 00:51:09,540
This morning, we must put our trust in the Lord.

878
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:11,339
We must rejoice in him.

879
00:51:11,339 --> 00:51:16,260
And we must continue until the trumpet sounds.

880
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:18,260
I believe that one day, and I think it's soon

881
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:21,019
that the trumpet of the Lord is gonna sound.

882
00:51:21,019 --> 00:51:22,660
We're gonna be raptured out of here.

883
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:26,300
But until then, God's given us a responsibility.

884
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:31,139
And we must understand that the Bible must influence

885
00:51:31,139 --> 00:51:33,860
how we cast a ballot.

886
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:36,459
But then the Bible must also influence on how I cope

887
00:51:36,459 --> 00:51:38,059
with the results of an election.

888
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:42,379
This morning, I'm gonna use a quote from someone

889
00:51:42,379 --> 00:51:44,699
that perhaps you've heard the quote before.

890
00:51:44,699 --> 00:51:49,699
I thought it was so pertinent to our thought this morning.

891
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:52,379
But Booker T. Washington said this,

892
00:51:52,419 --> 00:51:56,819
a lie doesn't become truth, wrong doesn't become right,

893
00:51:56,819 --> 00:51:58,339
and evil doesn't become good,

894
00:51:58,339 --> 00:52:01,680
just because it's accepted by a majority.

895
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:05,940
What defines, what is truth?

896
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:08,019
Well, Jesus is truth.

897
00:52:08,019 --> 00:52:09,779
But then he said that he gave us his word,

898
00:52:09,779 --> 00:52:11,440
and his word is truth.

899
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:14,619
He said, sanctify them through thy word.

900
00:52:14,619 --> 00:52:17,779
Thy word is truth.

901
00:52:17,779 --> 00:52:20,059
We must filter everything through the Bible.

902
00:52:20,059 --> 00:52:21,699
It means that we have to be Bible students.

903
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:24,220
We have to know our Bibles.

904
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:27,619
It says here that wrong doesn't become right.

905
00:52:27,619 --> 00:52:28,740
Who defines wrong?

906
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:29,779
Who defines right?

907
00:52:29,779 --> 00:52:31,460
God does.

908
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:33,699
Remember the one came to Jesus and said, good master?

909
00:52:33,699 --> 00:52:36,020
He said, why callest thou me good?

910
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:37,979
There's one good, that's God.

911
00:52:37,979 --> 00:52:41,419
Well, Jesus is God, and he defines what's good,

912
00:52:41,419 --> 00:52:44,139
and he defines what's evil.

913
00:52:44,139 --> 00:52:47,979
And here it says that the third part here,

914
00:52:47,979 --> 00:52:49,419
evil doesn't become good.

915
00:52:50,259 --> 00:52:53,360
I understand this morning,

916
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:55,660
we start getting into, well, the majority.

917
00:52:57,100 --> 00:52:58,860
It's never been about the majority.

918
00:53:00,259 --> 00:53:03,520
We don't make decisions based upon the majority.

919
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:07,220
We make decisions based upon the truth of God's word.

920
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:10,259
And so I submit to you this morning,

921
00:53:11,259 --> 00:53:13,500
as I used this line at the very beginning,

922
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:17,020
that your Bible and my Bible should influence my ballot.

923
00:53:17,919 --> 00:53:22,820
There are biblical principles that we must understand

924
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:25,440
in casting a ballot.

925
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:29,460
We must no longer allow the politicians

926
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:33,979
to hijack biblical truth and politicize it

927
00:53:33,979 --> 00:53:36,500
and then demand that you don't speak about it

928
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:38,580
and that I don't speak about it,

929
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:41,139
because their Bible matters.

930
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:45,979
And if we're Christians, if we're followers of Jesus Christ,

931
00:53:45,979 --> 00:53:49,139
the Bible must influence how I vote.

932
00:53:49,139 --> 00:53:51,119
It influences how I live.

933
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:54,300
And then how do we cope with it?

934
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:55,740
Say, I don't know what's gonna happen.

935
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:56,699
You don't know what's gonna happen,

936
00:53:56,699 --> 00:53:58,419
and if you keep watching the polls every day,

937
00:53:58,419 --> 00:54:00,119
you're gonna go absolutely insane.

938
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:03,380
I'm telling you, it's crazy.

939
00:54:05,059 --> 00:54:06,539
So you know what I do?

940
00:54:06,539 --> 00:54:08,580
I just choose to focus on Jesus.

941
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:12,660
I sat here this morning and I was praying for our service.

942
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:14,460
I sat right here and I was praying this morning

943
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:16,059
for a while in the sanctuary.

944
00:54:18,059 --> 00:54:19,579
It was just, you know, we pray,

945
00:54:19,579 --> 00:54:21,779
we're in the presence of God.

946
00:54:21,779 --> 00:54:24,940
I was just thanking the Lord for how great He is

947
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:28,040
and the peace that He gives and the joy that He gives.

948
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:30,220
We live in a world that's full of turmoil,

949
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:36,140
chaos, confusion, but God has given us the truth.

950
00:54:37,179 --> 00:54:39,619
And this morning, we must allow the truth

951
00:54:39,619 --> 00:54:43,899
to impact every area of our lives.

952
00:54:43,899 --> 00:54:44,739
Let's pray together.

953
00:54:44,739 --> 00:54:46,380
Father, we love You.

954
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:47,579
We thank You for loving us.

955
00:54:47,579 --> 00:54:50,660
We thank You for Your Word.

956
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:53,459
This morning, we looked at so many verses of Scripture

957
00:54:53,459 --> 00:54:57,779
and quickly deal with so many matters that we face.

958
00:54:57,779 --> 00:55:00,660
And God, I hope that this morning,

959
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:03,299
every individual has been able to see the truth

960
00:55:03,299 --> 00:55:07,040
that these are biblical matters.

961
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:12,260
God, I pray that You would help us to remember

962
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:14,940
with great clarity and conviction

963
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:17,359
the reason that You've left us here,

964
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:19,440
to be Your witnesses, to be Your ambassadors.

965
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,399
You've given to us the ministry of reconciliation.

966
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:26,619
God, I pray that You would help each and every one of us,

967
00:55:26,619 --> 00:55:29,600
Lord, to keep our eyes on Jesus.

968
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:34,500
Let come what may, You rule and You reign.

969
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:36,859
You are King forever and ever.

970
00:55:37,779 --> 00:55:40,059
And yes, we live in this incursed world

971
00:55:40,059 --> 00:55:43,660
and we're ruled by other humans

972
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:46,500
because long ago, we rejected,

973
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:49,019
humanity rejected Your rulership.

974
00:55:52,019 --> 00:55:55,000
And God, we pray that You would help us

975
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,480
to be the salt and the light You've called us to be,

976
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:03,920
that we would trust You, rejoice in You,

977
00:56:04,899 --> 00:56:06,859
and that we would continue.

978
00:56:06,859 --> 00:56:09,859
I pray that You'd use us for Your honor and for Your glory.

979
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:13,859
Help us, Lord, to be people of the book.

980
00:56:13,859 --> 00:56:15,459
Well, thank You, God, for what You'll do

981
00:56:15,459 --> 00:56:16,760
in this moment of invitation.

982
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:18,100
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

983
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:18,940
Would you stand?
