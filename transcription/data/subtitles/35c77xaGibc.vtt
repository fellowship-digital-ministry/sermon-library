00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.679
You use 50 verses of scripture

00:00:01.679 --> 00:00:04.000
and you're gonna try to turn to every one of them.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.280
We'll be here for a couple of hours, amen.

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.079
And I know that you're not wanting to be here

00:00:08.079 --> 00:00:09.100
for a couple of hours.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.279
And so I've put the majority of the verses.

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:14.840
There's one passage of scripture

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.280
that I did not type out all of the 20 verses

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.079
of that passage, but for everything else,

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:21.760
I've typed out the verses

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.020
so that we can see it here on the screen.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.000
In Psalm chapter 10, it's the title

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.959
that I've used for the message this morning.

00:00:27.959 --> 00:00:30.399
Verse number 16 says this,

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:35.400
the Lord is king forever and ever.

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:38.639
The Bible says the heathen are perished out of his land.

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:43.639
And I'm thankful to know the Lord is king forever and ever.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.959
It is important that we understand

00:00:45.959 --> 00:00:50.639
from the start this morning that our God is on his throne.

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:53.159
I mean, right now at this very moment,

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:56.000
the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.520
And it's important for us to understand that.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.360
And we find that Jesus is king.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.560
Can I say this this morning?

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.480
He's not on the ballot.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.400
He's not on the ballot.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.680
Why isn't he on the ballot?

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.760
Because he doesn't need to be, it's his rightful place.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.839
All right, we're not voting for Jesus.

00:01:14.839 --> 00:01:17.000
Jesus is on his throne.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.120
Aren't you thankful for that?

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.120
Amen.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.519
And he's not on the ballot.

00:01:20.519 --> 00:01:23.599
Listen, he always has been,

00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:28.599
and he always will be king of kings and Lord of lords.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.239
And that ought to cause us this morning to rejoice greatly.

00:01:32.239 --> 00:01:35.400
And we look at this and I got a picture there

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.400
that has a Bible open to the book of Psalms.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.720
And then it has a individual that's casting a ballot.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.879
As you know, and you cannot,

00:01:44.879 --> 00:01:47.019
if you don't know, your head is in the sand.

00:01:47.019 --> 00:01:48.739
I'm not sure how you could not know.

00:01:48.739 --> 00:01:50.639
But in just a couple of weeks,

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:52.599
we're gonna have a, actually a week

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:56.160
in just a couple of days, an election here in our nation.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.800
And this morning, I want us to understand

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.319
with great clarity that the truth of this here

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:06.199
has to impact this here.

00:02:06.199 --> 00:02:07.800
What do I mean by that?

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.559
The Bible is our sole authority for faith and practice.

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:16.160
And it's absolutely vital that Christians once again

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.100
recognize the authority of God's word

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.139
and its influence on how we cast a ballot.

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:25.679
We have the privilege of casting a ballot

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:27.380
and I'm thankful for that.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.779
But I rejoice this morning to know that my King,

00:02:30.779 --> 00:02:34.300
my King Jesus, that he rules and that he reigns.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.539
Notice with me, we mentioned Psalm 10, 16 already,

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:42.380
but notice if you will, in Psalm 29, in verse number 10,

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.220
the Bible says this, the Lord sitteth upon the flood,

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.100
yea, the Lord sitteth King forever.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.300
We find in Psalm 97 and verse number one,

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.300
the Bible says this, the Lord reigneth.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.139
Aren't you thankful?

00:02:58.139 --> 00:02:59.259
The book of Revelation says,

00:02:59.259 --> 00:03:02.580
the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.380
Our God reigns.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.740
And I'm so thankful this morning that we understand that

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.600
and we can rejoice in that truth,

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.220
but we must acknowledge that long ago,

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.020
mankind rejected God as their ruler.

00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:18.300
We understand as you were to study the Old Testament

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.119
and study the people of Israel,

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:26.740
that they had a theocracy where literally God was their King.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.339
God was their ruler.

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:32.059
And we find that they rejected God and they said this,

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:33.779
give us a King.

00:03:33.779 --> 00:03:36.240
Samuel was disappointed with their interest

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.080
in having a King.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.339
They desired to be like all the other people.

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:44.339
They were so distinct and so unique that God was their King.

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:45.820
They had a theocracy,

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.820
but yet they wanted what the other nations of the world had.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.300
We find that Samuel was disappointed,

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.820
that Samuel struggled greatly with that.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.139
But we find that in that rejection of the nation of Israel,

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:06.339
rejecting God and changing the truth of a theocracy

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:08.039
into a monarchy,

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:10.899
that human history from that point forward

00:04:10.899 --> 00:04:13.580
has really plunged into the situation

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.459
of having humans rule us

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.260
or lead us from a government perspective.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.700
Now here's what I'm thankful for.

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.540
God knew that.

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.459
If you study the book of Deuteronomy,

00:04:25.459 --> 00:04:28.820
well before the people ever asked for a King,

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.700
God gave instruction to Kings.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.779
Why would he give instruction to Kings

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:37.700
if it wasn't his plan that there be Kings?

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.380
Because he knew that man would not follow his plan

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.980
and because he's the omniscient eternal God,

00:04:43.019 --> 00:04:45.619
he provided them with instruction

00:04:45.619 --> 00:04:47.160
and for that we can rejoice.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.119
But from that point in human history,

00:04:49.119 --> 00:04:52.899
we find that man has been ruled by humanity.

00:04:52.899 --> 00:04:54.940
Humanity has been ruled by humanity.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.540
Sometimes there have been good rulers.

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.899
Sometimes there's been ruthless rulers.

00:04:58.899 --> 00:05:01.179
But consider this thought from Proverbs 29

00:05:01.179 --> 00:05:02.500
in verse number two.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.619
When the righteous are in authority,

00:05:04.619 --> 00:05:05.739
notice what the Bible says,

00:05:05.739 --> 00:05:08.779
the people rejoice.

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:11.579
But when the wicked beareth rule,

00:05:11.579 --> 00:05:13.940
the people mourn.

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.820
There's a contrast in this verse of Scripture

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.100
between the righteous that are in authority

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.940
versus the wicked that beareth rule.

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.380
And we find that the contrast between the leadership

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.320
has a profound impact on those that are being ruled.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.820
The Bible says that when the righteous are in authority,

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:32.839
the people rejoice.

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:34.899
But when the wicked beareth rule,

00:05:34.899 --> 00:05:36.859
that the people mourn.

00:05:36.859 --> 00:05:39.059
Understand some foundational truth

00:05:39.059 --> 00:05:41.700
as we consider the thought this morning,

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:46.040
as we go through this thought this morning

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:50.700
with regard to our role in understanding biblical truth.

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.820
One day, Jesus will come back

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:54.579
and set up his millennial kingdom.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.859
He'll literally rule and reign for a thousand years.

00:06:01.179 --> 00:06:03.000
He'll rule with a rod of iron.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.980
We as the people of God will have the privilege

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:08.320
of being able to rule with him

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.559
and to experience that truth.

00:06:11.559 --> 00:06:14.619
And we find that Revelation 20 verses one through six

00:06:14.619 --> 00:06:17.700
gives in a very condensed passage that truth.

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:19.600
We can find references to the millennium

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.440
all throughout the pages of Scripture.

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.880
In fact, the Old Testament prophets speak much

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.959
about the millennial kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:06:28.959 --> 00:06:32.880
Until that time, however, we are governed by human rulers.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.380
We have the unique blessing

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:36.160
of living United States of America

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.399
where we have elected officials.

00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:43.640
We find that as citizens, we have not only a privilege,

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:46.320
but a responsibility to vote.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.339
But as Christians, I would say this,

00:06:49.339 --> 00:06:52.480
when it is our privilege and our responsibility to vote

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.399
that we have to understand that the Bible

00:06:55.399 --> 00:06:59.760
must influence how we cast our ballot.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:00.880
It's absolutely imperative.

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:05.880
I cannot separate my Christian life duty obligation

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:09.519
from my civil duty and obligation.

00:07:09.519 --> 00:07:12.559
I am a Christian first and foremost,

00:07:12.559 --> 00:07:16.600
and therefore it must affect every part of me.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:20.480
I understand that in Proverbs 14 in verse number 34,

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.399
the Bible says this.

00:07:22.399 --> 00:07:25.820
It says that righteousness exalteth a nation,

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:29.720
but sin is a reproach to any people.

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.839
It's interesting to me when I look at this verse

00:07:31.839 --> 00:07:34.600
of Scripture that God did not say righteousness

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:38.480
exalted Israel or sin is a reproach to Israel.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:41.559
The truth that is given to us is a truth

00:07:41.559 --> 00:07:43.880
that's beyond just Israel.

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.720
It's for all people, all nations.

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:50.279
And thus God says righteousness exalteth a nation,

00:07:50.279 --> 00:07:53.160
but sin is a reproach to any people.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.880
Understand this in Psalm 11 in verse number seven,

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:58.359
the Bible says that the righteous Lord

00:07:58.359 --> 00:08:01.160
loveth righteousness.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:04.640
He's a righteous God and he loves righteousness.

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:07.799
The Bible tells us in Psalm 33 in verse number 12,

00:08:07.799 --> 00:08:10.239
blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord

00:08:10.239 --> 00:08:12.640
and the people whom he hath chosen

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:14.920
for his own inheritance.

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:18.920
But then consider this truth of Psalm nine in verse 17,

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:22.559
the wicked shall be turned into hell

00:08:22.559 --> 00:08:26.239
and all the nations that forget God.

00:08:26.239 --> 00:08:28.839
You say pastor, that's strong language, it's Bible.

00:08:29.839 --> 00:08:34.599
Our God is a righteous God and he loves righteousness.

00:08:34.599 --> 00:08:37.280
I've said this from the pulpit many times over the years,

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:41.719
even in recent days, our nation is ripe for judgment.

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:45.880
Our nation is ripe for judgment.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.320
We read throughout the pages of Scripture

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:52.559
of God judging nations and peoples,

00:08:52.559 --> 00:08:55.880
even his own people because of their wickedness

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:58.159
and because of their disobedience.

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:02.119
America as a nation is ripe for judgment.

00:09:02.119 --> 00:09:04.799
I'm thankful that our God is long suffering.

00:09:04.799 --> 00:09:06.159
I'm thankful that he's long suffering.

00:09:06.159 --> 00:09:08.159
Consider with me this morning,

00:09:08.159 --> 00:09:10.000
we have to remember as we consider

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.440
some of these foundational truths

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.599
before we dig in to specifics

00:09:13.599 --> 00:09:15.880
with regarding this upcoming election.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:18.239
But I want you to remember that our main purpose

00:09:18.239 --> 00:09:20.400
for being left here upon this earth,

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.479
Jesus said in Acts one in verse number eight,

00:09:22.479 --> 00:09:25.119
ye shall be witnesses unto me.

00:09:25.119 --> 00:09:27.599
And I want you to see I got both verses on the screen

00:09:27.599 --> 00:09:31.359
because in Acts 5.32, the disciples just,

00:09:31.359 --> 00:09:36.000
they absolutely embraced what Jesus had told them

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.359
in Acts one in verse number eight,

00:09:37.359 --> 00:09:39.919
when Jesus said ye shall be witnesses unto me,

00:09:39.919 --> 00:09:41.719
then in chapter five in verse 32,

00:09:41.719 --> 00:09:45.159
they say we are his witnesses.

00:09:45.159 --> 00:09:48.719
And God's people must embrace that truth once again,

00:09:48.719 --> 00:09:50.239
that we are his witnesses.

00:09:50.239 --> 00:09:53.479
Listen, we have been given the responsibility

00:09:53.479 --> 00:09:56.219
of not only being his witnesses, but being his ambassadors.

00:09:56.219 --> 00:09:57.859
The Bible says in second Corinthians five

00:09:57.859 --> 00:10:00.219
in verse number 20, now then we are.

00:10:00.219 --> 00:10:04.959
ambassadors for Christ. I'm thankful that I'm a pilgrim. I'm a stranger. This world

00:10:04.959 --> 00:10:10.459
is not my home. I'm just a passing through. The reality is that I have dual citizenship.

00:10:10.459 --> 00:10:17.159
Number one, I'm a citizen of heaven. My conversation is in heaven, for which I rejoice, but I also

00:10:17.159 --> 00:10:22.739
happen to be a citizen of the United States of America. But I'm an ambassador. The Bible

00:10:22.739 --> 00:10:27.779
says at the end of that verse, as though God did beseech you by us, we pray you in Christ's

00:10:27.779 --> 00:10:33.139
stead be reconciled to God. And it reminds us just a couple of verses earlier that God

00:10:33.139 --> 00:10:38.379
said this, that all things are of God who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ

00:10:38.379 --> 00:10:46.299
and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation. I'm so thankful to be reconciled. I was at

00:10:46.299 --> 00:10:54.179
variance with God. I was an enemy. I was lost and undone. But because of the work at Calvary,

00:10:54.259 --> 00:11:00.459
I've been redeemed. I've been justified. I've been reconciled. And I'm so thankful for that.

00:11:00.459 --> 00:11:07.639
And he's given to us the ministry of reconciliation. So it's important that we understand our purpose

00:11:07.639 --> 00:11:14.019
for being here on earth. Our purpose is not primarily political. Amen? That's not our

00:11:14.019 --> 00:11:19.139
purpose. Now we get to engage in that arena. We get to influence that arena, but that is

00:11:19.139 --> 00:11:25.979
not our main purpose. Our main purpose is to preach the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:11:25.979 --> 00:11:33.939
I understand this morning that principles and policies matter more than personalities.

00:11:33.939 --> 00:11:40.979
Principles and policies matter more than personalities. Listen, we have to have the right position,

00:11:40.979 --> 00:11:45.959
and it's also helpful that we have the right disposition. If one of those things is going

00:11:45.959 --> 00:11:51.479
to be out of balance, it's far better to have a right position and a wrong disposition

00:11:51.479 --> 00:11:57.679
than to have a right disposition with a wrong position. Did you follow that with me? And

00:11:57.679 --> 00:12:02.239
the reality is that we want to have it in harmony. We want to have the right position,

00:12:02.239 --> 00:12:05.979
and we want to have the right disposition. We want people to know that we love them.

00:12:05.979 --> 00:12:09.159
We want people to know that we care about them, and we're giving them the gospel because

00:12:09.159 --> 00:12:14.039
we love them. Yes, we've been instructed to do so, but I don't want to be ugly about it.

00:12:14.039 --> 00:12:19.839
I want to be gracious about it. Let me say this. There will never be a candidate that

00:12:19.839 --> 00:12:29.239
aligns with you 100%. Never. You don't agree with yourself 100% of the time. Amen? What

00:12:29.239 --> 00:12:36.159
do you want for dinner? Just think about it. You don't agree with yourself 100% of the

00:12:37.159 --> 00:12:45.839
As Christians, as followers of the Lord Jesus Christ, we must no longer allow politicians

00:12:45.839 --> 00:12:55.959
to take biblical matters and politicize them. Then they demand that we as the people of

00:12:55.959 --> 00:13:05.679
God not speak up with the threat of being labeled a bigot or worse. Can I tell you?

00:13:05.679 --> 00:13:13.799
We've got to talk about the Bible. What's happened in our nation is politicians have

00:13:13.799 --> 00:13:20.159
taken biblical truth and they've politicized it. Then they've told us as Christians you

00:13:20.159 --> 00:13:26.499
don't belong in the political arena, and therefore you can't talk about it because we're going

00:13:26.499 --> 00:13:32.079
to label you as, and we're going to cancel you as, and so on and so forth. But the reality

00:13:32.079 --> 00:13:41.159
is that they're biblical principles. A bigot is defined as a person who is obstinately

00:13:41.159 --> 00:13:47.559
or unreasonably attached to a belief, opinion, or fraction. Listen, I am absolutely attached

00:13:47.559 --> 00:13:53.839
to this book. We have been called as Baptists throughout the centuries. We've been called

00:13:53.839 --> 00:14:02.319
people of the book. That's a compliment. It's a compliment. And listen, we must understand

00:14:02.319 --> 00:14:09.239
this morning, we must remember this morning that this truth of speaking on biblical matters

00:14:09.239 --> 00:14:19.279
and biblical principles is absolutely imperative. Our world is blind. Our world has been blinded

00:14:19.279 --> 00:14:23.959
by the enemy. I want to read to you a quote. It's not going to be on the screen there,

00:14:23.959 --> 00:14:29.619
but in 1983 Howard Hendricks said this, and if it was true in 1983, it's so much more

00:14:29.619 --> 00:14:34.919
true today. He said this, in a midst of a generation, or in the midst of a generation

00:14:34.919 --> 00:14:43.799
screaming for answers, Christians are stuttering. Think about that just for a moment. They're

00:14:43.799 --> 00:14:50.079
screaming for answers. Listen, our world is confused. Our world has no absolute truth

00:14:50.079 --> 00:14:57.119
because they've made themselves the authority. And when you don't have an absolute truth,

00:14:57.119 --> 00:15:02.299
when you enter into an arena of just do what makes you feel good and you redefine terms

00:15:02.299 --> 00:15:11.639
and you have no boundaries, then you end up with what we're dealing with in America today.

00:15:11.639 --> 00:15:15.279
Christians can no longer stutter. We must know why we believe what we believe and be

00:15:15.279 --> 00:15:20.959
able to speak it in love. We must be able to articulate our position. We must be able

00:15:20.959 --> 00:15:24.799
to speak on these matters. We've been given the responsibility, I'm going to say it one

00:15:24.799 --> 00:15:31.639
more time, to preach the gospel to a lost and dying world. Understand with me this morning

00:15:31.639 --> 00:15:41.599
that those with a different view are our mission field. They're not our enemy. Let me remind

00:15:41.599 --> 00:15:50.879
you of something. Saul considered David his enemy continually. But David did not consider

00:15:50.879 --> 00:15:58.599
Saul his enemy. I don't have time to develop all of that this morning, but I hope you can

00:15:58.599 --> 00:16:05.879
be mindful. Listen, Saul was hunting David to kill him. He made David his enemy continually.

00:16:05.879 --> 00:16:12.159
But David never viewed Saul as his enemy. He said, why do you come out to fight against

00:16:12.159 --> 00:16:20.079
us? I mean, he understood that Saul was anointed to be the king. And this morning, we must

00:16:20.079 --> 00:16:24.799
understand that those with a different view, they're not our enemy. You say, but they've

00:16:24.799 --> 00:16:29.039
made…they're our mission field. The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit

00:16:29.039 --> 00:16:33.039
of God. For their foolishness unto him, neither can he know them, because they're spiritually

00:16:33.039 --> 00:16:37.599
discerned. 1 Corinthians 2 and verse 14. So let me give you some biblical principles

00:16:37.599 --> 00:16:41.759
for casting your vote. If you're taking notes this morning, I only have two points, but

00:16:41.759 --> 00:16:47.199
they're two very long points. All right? Number one this morning, biblical principles for

00:16:47.199 --> 00:16:51.159
casting your vote. I used that first slide. I'm going to show it again at the end of

00:16:51.159 --> 00:16:55.999
the presentation this morning. But the first slide was a picture of an open Bible and a

00:16:55.999 --> 00:17:01.279
picture with an American flag and an individual casting a ballot. And I say this, that there

00:17:01.279 --> 00:17:08.439
are biblical principles that must influence and impact how we cast our ballot. Know the

00:17:08.439 --> 00:17:15.339
issues and study your Bible. Don't go reading all of these political things and listening

00:17:15.339 --> 00:17:21.499
to all these politicians. No. Get into your Bible, because your Bible is the authority.

00:17:21.499 --> 00:17:25.199
Let me mention, I'm going to mention a number of things this morning that are matters that

00:17:25.199 --> 00:17:29.859
we must consider. Number one, the matter of life. Do you understand this morning that

00:17:29.859 --> 00:17:38.339
they have made life a political issue, but life is a biblical issue? God is the author

00:17:38.339 --> 00:17:44.619
and giver of life. We find that the Bible tells us in Psalm 139 and verse 14, I will

00:17:44.619 --> 00:17:49.979
praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Marvelous are thy works, and that my

00:17:49.979 --> 00:17:56.539
soul knoweth right well. Verse 15, my substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret

00:17:56.539 --> 00:18:02.419
and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth. And then verse 16, it says this,

00:18:02.419 --> 00:18:08.619
thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect. And in my book all my members were

00:18:08.619 --> 00:18:15.859
written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them. What a

00:18:15.859 --> 00:18:22.679
marvelous passage of Scripture dealing with the sanctity of life and understanding that

00:18:22.679 --> 00:18:28.719
our God is the giver of life. The subject of abortion is all over our map today. It's

00:18:28.719 --> 00:18:35.079
all over. There's individuals that are just fighting for up until the very last moment

00:18:35.079 --> 00:18:40.459
that they could kill a baby. It's so sad. And all they want to talk about is, well,

00:18:40.459 --> 00:18:47.479
it's a choice, and it's a choice. And no, it's not a choice, it's a human being. And

00:18:47.599 --> 00:18:53.959
God is the giver of life. And we have to understand this morning that this is not a political

00:18:53.959 --> 00:19:00.439
issue, it is a biblical issue. Jeremiah 1 and verse number 5, the Bible says this, sorry,

00:19:00.439 --> 00:19:05.319
I think I'm on Exodus 21, sorry. Exodus 21, notice in verse number 22 it says, if men

00:19:05.319 --> 00:19:10.639
strive and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief

00:19:10.639 --> 00:19:14.079
follow. Now do you understand the language here? What's happening is there are men that

00:19:14.079 --> 00:19:20.839
are fighting, they hurt a woman that's expecting, her fruit depart, she has the baby. But it

00:19:20.839 --> 00:19:27.839
says here that there's no mischief to follow. In other words, the baby survives. The baby

00:19:28.399 --> 00:19:33.119
survives. The Bible goes on to say, he shall be surely punished according as the woman's

00:19:33.119 --> 00:19:39.359
husband will lay upon him, and he shall pay as the judges determine. But verse 23 says

00:19:39.559 --> 00:19:46.159
and if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life. What does it mean if any

00:19:46.159 --> 00:19:52.139
mischief follow? It means if the baby dies. That's what it means. And so if two people

00:19:52.139 --> 00:19:57.359
are fighting and there's a woman that's expecting that's there, and that woman gets hurt in

00:19:57.359 --> 00:20:00.239
the fight, and her baby is born.

00:20:00.239 --> 00:20:02.559
and there's no mischief, there's still a consequence,

00:20:02.559 --> 00:20:04.279
there's still a price to be paid,

00:20:04.279 --> 00:20:09.279
but if the baby dies, God says life for life.

00:20:11.879 --> 00:20:16.199
The Bible tells us in Proverbs 6 and verses 16 and 17,

00:20:16.199 --> 00:20:18.119
these six things doth the Lord hate,

00:20:18.119 --> 00:20:20.359
yea, seven are an abomination unto him,

00:20:20.359 --> 00:20:21.959
a proud look, a lying tongue,

00:20:21.959 --> 00:20:25.979
and notice, and hands that shed innocent blood.

00:20:25.979 --> 00:20:28.239
If there's ever a description of abortion

00:20:28.259 --> 00:20:29.859
that I can find in the Bible,

00:20:29.859 --> 00:20:32.979
it's hands that shed innocent blood.

00:20:35.619 --> 00:20:38.219
I believe with my whole heart this morning

00:20:38.219 --> 00:20:40.039
that if we could deal with the subject

00:20:40.039 --> 00:20:42.219
of fornication in our society,

00:20:42.219 --> 00:20:44.219
it would go a long way to dealing with the subject

00:20:44.219 --> 00:20:46.179
of abortion in our society.

00:20:47.299 --> 00:20:51.699
We live in a loose living, sexualized society,

00:20:51.699 --> 00:20:54.339
and therefore abortion is the byproduct,

00:20:54.339 --> 00:20:57.259
I don't want that consequence, I don't want that result.

00:20:58.199 --> 00:21:00.199
Righteousness exalteth a nation,

00:21:00.199 --> 00:21:02.479
but sin is a reproach to any people.

00:21:02.479 --> 00:21:05.919
Consider with me this morning the matter of gender,

00:21:05.919 --> 00:21:07.439
the matter of gender.

00:21:07.439 --> 00:21:09.799
God said this in Genesis 1 and verse 27,

00:21:09.799 --> 00:21:11.279
so God created man in his own image,

00:21:11.279 --> 00:21:12.899
in the image of God created he him,

00:21:12.899 --> 00:21:15.079
male and female created he them.

00:21:15.079 --> 00:21:16.759
In Matthew 9 and verse number four,

00:21:16.759 --> 00:21:18.119
and he answered and said unto them,

00:21:18.119 --> 00:21:20.779
have ye not read that he which made them at the beginning

00:21:20.779 --> 00:21:23.319
made them male and female?

00:21:23.319 --> 00:21:24.599
We're living in a society today,

00:21:24.599 --> 00:21:26.859
listen, I don't know how you think about this,

00:21:26.859 --> 00:21:28.279
I don't know how you feel about this,

00:21:28.279 --> 00:21:30.919
but for me, when I begin to look at some of these things

00:21:30.919 --> 00:21:32.999
that are going on, I shake my head and say,

00:21:32.999 --> 00:21:36.359
how in the world did we get here?

00:21:36.359 --> 00:21:37.919
How did we get here?

00:21:38.919 --> 00:21:41.059
The slippery slope of sin.

00:21:43.379 --> 00:21:45.219
They did not want to acknowledge God,

00:21:45.219 --> 00:21:46.699
Romans chapter number one,

00:21:46.699 --> 00:21:49.599
and God gave them over to a reprobate mind.

00:21:50.519 --> 00:21:53.039
And we find this morning that we're living in the midst,

00:21:53.039 --> 00:21:56.039
listen, they don't know, they say you can figure it out

00:21:56.099 --> 00:21:59.279
at some point, no, no, we know if you're a male or a female.

00:22:00.339 --> 00:22:04.419
It's absolutely obvious and easy to identify.

00:22:04.419 --> 00:22:07.339
This idea of allowing people to think

00:22:07.339 --> 00:22:09.939
that they're something else and to participate in sports

00:22:09.939 --> 00:22:14.419
and all the others, it's nonsense, it's against God.

00:22:14.419 --> 00:22:16.939
And it's against his order.

00:22:16.939 --> 00:22:20.299
The subject of gender is not a political subject.

00:22:21.139 --> 00:22:22.779
It's biblical.

00:22:22.779 --> 00:22:24.759
God is the author and giver of life,

00:22:24.759 --> 00:22:28.579
and he's the one that determined your gender.

00:22:28.579 --> 00:22:30.679
And by the way, I'm thankful for it.

00:22:33.579 --> 00:22:35.359
Notice with me, consider number three,

00:22:35.359 --> 00:22:37.639
the matter of marriage.

00:22:37.639 --> 00:22:39.719
God instituted marriage.

00:22:39.719 --> 00:22:42.919
God instructed, gave instruction for marriage

00:22:42.919 --> 00:22:44.699
in Genesis two and verse 24.

00:22:44.699 --> 00:22:47.019
Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother

00:22:47.019 --> 00:22:51.899
and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh.

00:22:51.899 --> 00:22:53.379
The subject of marriage.

00:22:55.599 --> 00:23:00.599
As a nation, we bought into the lie that love is love.

00:23:00.759 --> 00:23:02.259
It's such a catchphrase today.

00:23:03.919 --> 00:23:07.719
Whatever makes you happy, no, God defined.

00:23:07.719 --> 00:23:09.079
God gave the truth.

00:23:10.119 --> 00:23:12.239
And it's important this morning that we understand

00:23:12.239 --> 00:23:15.599
that the matter of marriage is settled by God,

00:23:15.599 --> 00:23:18.679
not by politicians, it's settled by God.

00:23:18.679 --> 00:23:20.519
Let me say this, the matter of family.

00:23:20.519 --> 00:23:24.519
God designed the family, and we find that the family

00:23:25.279 --> 00:23:27.959
has been designed by God, it's been defined by God,

00:23:27.959 --> 00:23:30.719
and God has directed the family.

00:23:30.719 --> 00:23:34.679
How do we operate as husband, as wife, as children?

00:23:34.679 --> 00:23:38.279
Understand with me this morning that there is an effort

00:23:38.279 --> 00:23:42.619
to destroy the nuclear family structure as we've known it.

00:23:42.619 --> 00:23:47.199
That term nuclear family refers to a man and a woman

00:23:47.199 --> 00:23:51.239
that marry and have children and live in a home.

00:23:51.239 --> 00:23:53.799
And that's the idea of a nuclear family.

00:23:53.799 --> 00:23:56.759
And this morning, they have distorted that,

00:23:56.759 --> 00:23:59.599
they have tried to break that down.

00:23:59.599 --> 00:24:02.639
Can I tell you that those are the truths

00:24:02.639 --> 00:24:04.239
of the backbone of our society

00:24:04.239 --> 00:24:06.199
that made America what it is?

00:24:07.979 --> 00:24:12.399
It's the enemy, it's Satan that wants to attack

00:24:12.399 --> 00:24:17.399
what God instituted and to attack what God has designed,

00:24:17.639 --> 00:24:20.599
and we find that happening in the family.

00:24:20.599 --> 00:24:23.239
And it's so sad to see what's happening in our society

00:24:23.559 --> 00:24:25.160
today with regard to the family.

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:29.399
I want you to think about the matter of justice,

00:24:29.399 --> 00:24:30.479
the matter of justice.

00:24:30.479 --> 00:24:32.720
You say that we live, you're familiar with this,

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:36.199
the lady justice is supposed to be blindfolded.

00:24:36.199 --> 00:24:39.720
And we find that today, we live in a time in which

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:43.839
there's, we could say that the justice is corrupt.

00:24:43.839 --> 00:24:46.519
And we don't have to, we're not exaggerating

00:24:46.519 --> 00:24:48.079
by saying that this morning,

00:24:48.079 --> 00:24:51.399
but we understand the importance of justice.

00:24:51.399 --> 00:24:54.759
The Bible says this, righteous art thou, O Lord,

00:24:54.759 --> 00:24:59.759
and upright are thy judgments, in Psalm 119, in verse 137.

00:25:00.359 --> 00:25:03.679
In Isaiah 59, in verses 14 and 15,

00:25:03.679 --> 00:25:05.239
there's an indictment that is made,

00:25:05.239 --> 00:25:06.599
the Bible says in verse 14,

00:25:06.599 --> 00:25:08.679
and judgment is turned away backward,

00:25:08.679 --> 00:25:10.559
and justice standeth afar off,

00:25:10.559 --> 00:25:13.319
for truth is fallen in the street,

00:25:13.319 --> 00:25:15.319
and equity cannot enter.

00:25:15.319 --> 00:25:17.919
Verse number 15, the Bible says this,

00:25:17.919 --> 00:25:20.799
yea, truth falleth, faileth, excuse me,

00:25:20.799 --> 00:25:24.119
and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey,

00:25:24.119 --> 00:25:27.119
and the Lord saw it, and it displeased him

00:25:27.119 --> 00:25:30.179
that there was no judgment.

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:32.279
Sad.

00:25:33.479 --> 00:25:36.440
Our God is a righteous, just God.

00:25:39.039 --> 00:25:42.319
There is right, and there is wrong.

00:25:42.319 --> 00:25:44.799
There is good, and there is evil.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.880
And God is the one that defines that.

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:49.359
Isaiah deals with it.

00:25:49.359 --> 00:25:51.599
The Bible says that they were saying

00:25:51.599 --> 00:25:53.079
that that which was good is evil,

00:25:53.079 --> 00:25:54.299
and that which is evil is good.

00:25:54.299 --> 00:25:56.839
That's what's happening in our society today.

00:25:56.839 --> 00:25:57.959
We see it.

00:25:59.519 --> 00:26:01.519
And we begin to think about biblical principles

00:26:01.519 --> 00:26:03.000
for casting our votes,

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.440
and we're gonna go stand at a ballot box,

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:06.919
and we're gonna cast a vote,

00:26:06.919 --> 00:26:10.759
and these things that our politicians have tried to take

00:26:10.759 --> 00:26:12.319
and politicize them,

00:26:12.319 --> 00:26:15.539
we must acknowledge that they're biblical matters.

00:26:16.399 --> 00:26:19.199
The Bible tells us in Leviticus 19, in verse number 15,

00:26:19.839 --> 00:26:21.919
he shall do no unrighteousness in judgment.

00:26:21.919 --> 00:26:24.599
Thou shalt not respect the person of the poor,

00:26:24.599 --> 00:26:26.399
nor honor the person of the mighty,

00:26:26.399 --> 00:26:30.079
but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbor.

00:26:31.039 --> 00:26:33.399
In righteousness thou shalt judge thy neighbor.

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:37.319
We find this matter of justice again

00:26:37.319 --> 00:26:42.319
living in a corrupt society with corrupt justice system.

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:46.299
And we begin to understand the authority of those

00:26:46.299 --> 00:26:48.539
that are elected in the positions

00:26:48.579 --> 00:26:50.220
in which they're able to fill

00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:53.019
and how it affects our justice department.

00:26:54.299 --> 00:26:56.339
It's important that we understand this.

00:26:57.899 --> 00:26:59.139
I want you to think about this one,

00:26:59.139 --> 00:27:01.259
the matter of partiality.

00:27:01.259 --> 00:27:03.899
Today, many people wanna use the word racism,

00:27:03.899 --> 00:27:05.299
and I understand the term,

00:27:05.299 --> 00:27:07.299
and I understand why they use it.

00:27:07.299 --> 00:27:11.299
I use the word partiality because it's a Bible word,

00:27:11.299 --> 00:27:15.699
and I believe that partiality defines much clearer

00:27:15.699 --> 00:27:17.639
the subject than just racism,

00:27:17.639 --> 00:27:20.399
because partiality can be done

00:27:20.399 --> 00:27:24.039
without race being even in the conversation.

00:27:24.039 --> 00:27:26.119
You can be partial towards someone

00:27:26.119 --> 00:27:28.079
because of their economic status,

00:27:28.079 --> 00:27:31.160
though they are the same race as you are

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:34.959
from that perspective of what they have

00:27:34.959 --> 00:27:38.000
as race being their calling card.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.500
You can have prejudice or partiality towards someone

00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:45.199
because of their religious identification.

00:27:45.199 --> 00:27:47.479
We see this all around the globe, by the way.

00:27:48.319 --> 00:27:49.919
You see it over in Asia,

00:27:49.919 --> 00:27:52.039
and you see it in Africa, the Middle East.

00:27:52.039 --> 00:27:54.759
You see people that have all of this partiality

00:27:54.759 --> 00:27:59.319
based on the economic status

00:27:59.319 --> 00:28:01.720
and the religious identification,

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:04.639
and they all have the same skin color,

00:28:04.639 --> 00:28:07.759
but they're partial, they're partial.

00:28:07.759 --> 00:28:09.799
So the Bible says this in Acts 17,

00:28:09.799 --> 00:28:12.319
and it's so important that we understand this this morning,

00:28:12.319 --> 00:28:17.079
and hath made of one blood all nations of men

00:28:17.079 --> 00:28:18.919
for to dwell in all the face of the earth

00:28:18.919 --> 00:28:21.000
and hath determined the times before appointed

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.839
and the bounds of their habitation.

00:28:22.839 --> 00:28:25.519
James 2, verses eight and nine, the Bible says this.

00:28:25.519 --> 00:28:28.319
If you fulfill the royal law according to the scripture,

00:28:28.319 --> 00:28:31.399
thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself, ye do well.

00:28:31.399 --> 00:28:33.760
But if you have respect to persons,

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:38.760
ye commit sin and are convinced of the law as transgressors.

00:28:40.399 --> 00:28:42.119
This thing of partiality is important

00:28:42.119 --> 00:28:44.399
that we understand as biblical people.

00:28:44.399 --> 00:28:47.119
Can I help you understand an important truth

00:28:47.119 --> 00:28:49.679
that so many have missed, I believe, today,

00:28:49.679 --> 00:28:50.839
and that is this.

00:28:50.839 --> 00:28:53.080
Darwinian evolution ideology

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:56.419
promotes further perpetuates partiality.

00:28:57.359 --> 00:29:00.080
I put up here on a screen a picture of the book

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:01.479
that Darwin wrote.

00:29:01.479 --> 00:29:04.039
Many of you would know it by the name

00:29:04.039 --> 00:29:06.399
On the Origin of Species,

00:29:06.399 --> 00:29:09.080
and really that's the only title that they want us today

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:10.520
to really be aware of,

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:13.119
but I want you to understand the full title of that book

00:29:13.119 --> 00:29:17.320
goes on to say, or the preservation of favored races

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:19.679
in the struggle of life.

00:29:19.679 --> 00:29:20.799
That's the full title of the book.

00:29:20.799 --> 00:29:22.799
You look at me like it's strange, I didn't make that up.

00:29:22.799 --> 00:29:24.399
It's the full title of the book.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.039
Wow is right, because Darwinian evolution

00:29:30.039 --> 00:29:31.799
permeates our society.

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:35.559
And Darwinian evolution ideology

00:29:35.559 --> 00:29:37.119
not only permeates our society,

00:29:37.119 --> 00:29:39.200
but it influences our perspective,

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:41.580
and it changes how we approach things.

00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:43.859
Listen, the second book that he wrote,

00:29:43.859 --> 00:29:45.140
The Descent of Man,

00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:47.219
I didn't take a picture of that one and put it there,

00:29:47.219 --> 00:29:49.619
but I'm telling you that Darwinian evolution

00:29:49.619 --> 00:29:54.039
is a major, major contributing factor to this subject.

00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:58.219
I was blown away when I visited England several years ago,

00:29:58.219 --> 00:30:00.820
and some of you have been to England, you know this.

00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:04.000
but when I was in England, I was absolutely blown away

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.140
by the fact that while I was there,

00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:09.740
that I got some pounds, and when I got the pounds,

00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:12.560
that Charles Darwin is on one of their notes.

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:15.140
We have folks on our notes,

00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:17.060
and we talk about the presidents that are on the notes,

00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:19.180
and so on and so forth, on our paper bills,

00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:21.080
and even on our coins, and one of those,

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:24.840
I think it was a 10, a British pound, a 10 currency,

00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:28.500
and it had Charles Darwin's face on that bill.

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:30.540
It's sad.

00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:33.120
Can I tell you this?

00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:38.540
Partiality existed way before Charles Darwin, okay?

00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:43.220
Just as it said in James two and verse number nine,

00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:46.920
the truth of being in sin if you show partiality,

00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:52.820
partiality in racism, it's sinful, it's wicked.

00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:55.020
It's been going on for centuries.

00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:57.460
Jesus was the one that said in John four,

00:30:57.460 --> 00:30:59.820
thy must needs go through Samaria.

00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:01.280
Why did he have to go through Samaria?

00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:03.220
Why does that interaction take place?

00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:06.700
Well, because the Jewish people hated the Samaritans.

00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:08.600
They were partial towards them,

00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:14.460
and Jesus was showing them that we're all of one blood.

00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:17.140
Jesus further said in Acts one and verse number eight,

00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:20.660
ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, Judea,

00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:22.940
help me, Samaria.

00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:24.100
Why did he say Samaria?

00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:25.700
Why do you think he said Samaria?

00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:28.440
Because he's talking to Jewish people,

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:30.500
and they had to know that the Samaritans

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:31.940
also had to hear the gospel.

00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:36.380
As much as Darwinian evolution ideology

00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:41.060
further perpetuates the idea of partiality,

00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:42.020
I mention this.

00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:44.460
Listen, it existed before Charles Darwin,

00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:48.180
but at the time of Charles Darwin and his prominence

00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:50.540
and all that he did, can I tell you what happened?

00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:52.980
All of a sudden, especially men like Adolf Hitler

00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:56.300
and others, they took and they ran with the fact

00:31:56.300 --> 00:32:00.700
that now science and biology supports my wicked heart

00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:05.700
and my agenda to be able to have this perspective

00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:08.260
and to kill masses of people.

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:12.140
Until then, partiality existed,

00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:15.480
but now all of a sudden, it could be justified

00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:17.780
in the wicked hearts of mankind

00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:20.300
because science supports it.

00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:21.460
No, science doesn't.

00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:24.020
We're all of one blood.

00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:26.460
I'm thankful for that.

00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:28.980
God created man in his own image.

00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:32.800
As much as we find that Darwinian evolution perpetuates,

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:34.740
I want you to understand that the Bible,

00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:37.960
that the gospel and biblical Christianity is the answer.

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:38.900
Why is it the answer?

00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:41.700
Well, notice he said in Mark 16 and verse 15,

00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:44.580
and he said unto them, go ye into all the world

00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:47.580
and preach the gospel to every creature.

00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:49.060
We find that the Bible tells us

00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:51.380
in the book of Colossians chapter three

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:54.100
and verse number 11, where there's neither Greek nor Jew,

00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:55.740
circumcision nor uncircumcision,

00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:57.840
barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free,

00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:00.100
but Christ is all and in all.

00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:01.020
What's he talking about?

00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:03.100
In the church, listen, we're made up

00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:05.980
of different nationalities or backgrounds,

00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:08.100
but we're saved by the blood of Christ

00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:12.080
and we're brothers and sisters in Christ.

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:15.720
The gospel of Jesus Christ and the truth

00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:18.720
of biblical Christianity will absolutely

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:20.860
be the answer to partiality.

00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:22.700
I wanna remind you that in the book of Revelation

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:24.260
chapter five and verse number nine,

00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:26.340
the Bible says they sang a new song

00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:27.220
and here's what they said.

00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:29.140
Thou art worthy to take the book

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:32.100
and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain

00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:34.660
and has redeemed us to God by thy blood

00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:37.340
out of notice every kindred and tongue

00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:39.900
and people and nation.

00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:41.540
Hallelujah.

00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:42.940
I love our church.

00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:45.620
I mentioned this often to individuals

00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:47.580
about the diversity of our church.

00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:49.140
I absolutely love it.

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:51.540
I don't know today as we'd go around

00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:54.340
and determine where people are originally from,

00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:56.700
there'd be a number of nations that are represented

00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:57.520
and I love that.

00:33:57.520 --> 00:33:58.520
You know why I love it so much?

00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:00.740
That's what heaven's gonna be like.

00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:02.560
That's what heaven's gonna be like.

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:05.580
The gospel in biblical Christianity

00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:07.780
is the answer for partiality.

00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:11.380
Listen, our world is trying to use this thing

00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:14.380
of partiality specifically in America

00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:18.580
of racism to divide, to cause hatred

00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:22.339
and we must understand that the Bible speaks on this.

00:34:22.339 --> 00:34:23.420
The Bible speaks on this.

00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:25.020
It's not a political issue.

00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:27.460
Think about this, the matter of,

00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:28.619
this is the last one I'm gonna deal with,

00:34:28.619 --> 00:34:30.580
the matter of debt.

00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:32.880
You know how in debt we are as a nation?

00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:35.740
It's absolutely sickening how in debt we are

00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:39.260
and here's what the Bible says in Proverbs 22 in verse seven,

00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:40.460
the rich ruleth over the poor

00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:44.260
and the borrower is servant to the lender.

00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:48.660
As a nation, I'm gonna put up some numbers here

00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:50.220
and it's hard for us to understand these

00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:55.220
but as a nation, our current debt is nearing $36 trillion.

00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:57.240
That's a lot of money.

00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:58.380
To be honest with you, Ron,

00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:00.860
I can't even think about that kind of number.

00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:02.179
I don't even know how many zeros there are.

00:35:02.179 --> 00:35:03.940
Actually, I was working on it this week

00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:04.779
trying to figure it out.

00:35:04.779 --> 00:35:07.020
I was trying to do math on these numbers

00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:08.300
and you know what the calculator did?

00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:09.700
Error.

00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:12.700
There ain't enough space on the calculator.

00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:14.660
36 trillion is what we're nearing.

00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:18.619
This year alone, $892 billion to pay

00:35:18.619 --> 00:35:20.740
just for the interest of our debt

00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:24.040
and for some reason, we can't help people

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:26.460
that were devastated by a hurricane.

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:30.220
You understand what I'm saying?

00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:33.960
They made it political but there's a biblical truth

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:36.100
that the borrower is servant to the lender

00:35:37.279 --> 00:35:39.920
and we need some fiscal responsibility.

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:42.200
Listen, how does it work in your home?

00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:46.679
You have to be responsible to pay your bills.

00:35:46.679 --> 00:35:47.600
How does it work as a church?

00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:49.440
Why do we have a budget as a church?

00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:52.080
Why don't we just spend and spend and spend

00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:53.399
and borrow and borrow and borrow

00:35:53.399 --> 00:35:54.440
and spend and spend and spend?

00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:57.600
No, we have to be fiscally responsible.

00:35:57.600 --> 00:35:59.700
In my home, I have to be fiscally responsible.

00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:01.720
Has there ever been a situation where you said in your home,

00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:04.360
hey, we don't have the money to do this.

00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:07.080
We can't afford this right now.

00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:07.920
Why?

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:10.279
Because you're being fiscally responsible.

00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:16.040
As a nation, we've got out of control with debt.

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:18.000
Here's an interesting calculation.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.679
If you suppose that every $1 equals one minute,

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:26.839
that equals 68,493 years.

00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:30.399
If we could talk about our debt in terms of time

00:36:30.399 --> 00:36:33.080
because 36 trillion is so, 68,000 years,

00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:34.820
that's 10 times, almost 10 times

00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:36.559
as long as the earth's been around.

00:36:37.559 --> 00:36:38.520
Unbelievable.

00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:41.440
I want you to understand this morning

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:44.320
that these matters are biblical matters.

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:46.740
But all of these matters that I touched on,

00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:48.040
they've tried to politicize.

00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:49.200
It's not an exhaustive list.

00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:52.980
Can I tell you that Israel is a biblical matter?

00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:55.960
It's not a political issue, it's a biblical issue.

00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:57.040
Amen?

00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:00.660
Can I tell you that borders, immigration,

00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:01.700
you start talking, they're all,

00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:04.160
listen, I don't have time in one service

00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:06.460
to deal with all of it, but you have a Bible.

00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:08.380
Go home and study your Bible.

00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:10.420
Go home and figure out the principles

00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:12.779
that God has given us that are to influence

00:37:12.779 --> 00:37:16.420
how we cast our ballot because if we're Bible believers,

00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:20.760
then the Bible has to influence every part of me.

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:23.820
Not just Sunday morning, not just Sunday night,

00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:27.059
not just Wednesday night, but every part of me

00:37:27.059 --> 00:37:30.740
is impacted and affected because I am a child of God,

00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:33.480
I'm a follower of Jesus Christ.

00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:37.440
Now, let me change gears just for a moment

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:38.440
and deal with this second.

00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:40.000
I told you my points were long.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.360
Number two this morning, biblical principles

00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:46.440
to cope with election results.

00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:47.960
You say, pastor, why are you dealing with this?

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:49.960
Well, because my head's not in the sand.

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:54.080
My head's not in the sand and I've heard people

00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:59.080
for years discussing whether there's election interference,

00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:01.800
election fraud, and so on and so forth,

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:05.480
whatever term you wanna use, I've heard many of them

00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:10.000
and I'm aware of how some have taken that perspective.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.720
But I want you to understand that there are

00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:14.080
biblical principles that we must be aware of

00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:17.460
that will help me cope with the results of an election.

00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:21.320
Can I remind you this morning that there are some things

00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:24.399
that are outside of your control and there are some things

00:38:24.399 --> 00:38:27.480
that are outside of my control, but there's absolutely

00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:30.899
nothing outside of the control of my God.

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:34.359
Nothing is outside of his control.

00:38:34.359 --> 00:38:37.600
So we must remember this morning that all things

00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:41.600
are within the control of God.

00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:42.780
And I can rejoice in that.

00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:45.400
Listen, if I had to sit around and worry about

00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:47.419
all the things that some of you have shared with me

00:38:47.419 --> 00:38:49.640
about election fraud, interference, and all that stuff,

00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:51.880
I'd have less hair than I have.

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:54.640
I'd have more, if I had any more, it'd be gray.

00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:56.039
I'd be worried all the time.

00:38:56.039 --> 00:38:57.799
I'd have all kinds of, but listen,

00:38:57.799 --> 00:38:59.359
I don't have to worry about it.

00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:05.200
I told you last week about the friends, the niece of Jackie

00:39:05.239 --> 00:39:08.400
who told me about in Washington State, you have to write

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:12.799
the particular party of the vote that you're casting

00:39:12.799 --> 00:39:16.440
on the outside of the envelope before you mail it in.

00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:18.640
And here's what I told her when she shared that with me.

00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:20.840
I said, listen, if I didn't know Jesus,

00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:23.400
if I didn't know God, it would drive me insane

00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:26.900
to think about those things that are going on.

00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:28.619
But I know God.

00:39:28.619 --> 00:39:30.220
I know God.

00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:31.179
And he gave me a peace.

00:39:31.179 --> 00:39:33.340
I was reading this morning in John 14,

00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:35.960
where Jesus said, my peace I give unto you.

00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:37.739
Not as the world giveth.

00:39:37.739 --> 00:39:39.220
Man, I have the peace of God

00:39:39.220 --> 00:39:41.460
which passeth all understanding.

00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:44.760
Can I remind you this morning that when we talk about

00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:47.739
these election things and we talk about interference

00:39:47.739 --> 00:39:49.080
and fraud and all of those things,

00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:51.220
we're looking just at this plane.

00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:52.619
We're looking at the temporal.

00:39:52.619 --> 00:39:55.940
We're removing the eternal God who's in control.

00:39:55.940 --> 00:39:57.820
And we're saying, listen, it's not fair.

00:39:57.820 --> 00:39:59.780
That's what people want to say.

00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:00.979
Can I remind you of the.

00:40:00.979 --> 00:40:11.239
trial that Jesus had? Was it fair? Can I remind you of the trial that Stephen had? Was it

00:40:11.239 --> 00:40:18.859
fair? But God was in control. Can I tell you this? There are some times I believe with

00:40:18.859 --> 00:40:29.899
all my heart that sometimes a way, a way, that God judges a nation is through its leadership.

00:40:29.899 --> 00:40:33.939
So how do I cope? What are some biblical principles? Number one, let me give you this verse. I'll

00:40:33.939 --> 00:40:36.819
share some things here in just a moment, but let me give you a couple of verses. Psalm

00:40:36.819 --> 00:40:43.219
75, verses 6 and 7. For promotion cometh neither from the east nor from the west nor from the

00:40:43.219 --> 00:40:52.219
south. But God is the judge. Notice this. He putteth down one and setteth up another.

00:40:52.219 --> 00:40:57.239
So really it comes down to this. Do we believe the Bible? Do we believe these verses of Scripture?

00:40:57.239 --> 00:41:01.439
Do we believe that God's in control? Let me remind you of Daniel 4 and verse 17. The

00:41:01.439 --> 00:41:06.419
Bible says this matter is by the decree of the watchers and the demand by the word of

00:41:06.419 --> 00:41:12.279
the holy ones to the intent that the living may know. What is it that the living may know?

00:41:12.279 --> 00:41:17.759
That the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men and giveth it to whomsoever He will and

00:41:17.759 --> 00:41:26.519
setteth up over it the basest of men. The question is do we believe the Bible? He said

00:41:26.519 --> 00:41:32.439
in Daniel 4, 17 that the living may know. As far as I know, we're all still alive here

00:41:32.439 --> 00:41:40.399
this morning. And that the living may know what? That the Most High ruleth in the kingdom

00:41:40.399 --> 00:41:47.279
of men. Listen, God did not create and then take His hands off. God is still very much

00:41:47.279 --> 00:41:52.999
involved in the affairs of mankind. God is still a very present help in the time of trouble.

00:41:52.999 --> 00:41:58.519
I'm thankful that God did not just remove His hands after creation, but that He withholds

00:41:58.519 --> 00:42:03.559
all things by the power of His hand and that He's involved. He knows. Listen, if it wasn't

00:42:03.559 --> 00:42:08.679
the truth, then prayer would never have been given to us to pray to the God who's able

00:42:08.679 --> 00:42:13.199
to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think. But He gave us prayer because

00:42:13.199 --> 00:42:21.399
He's actively involved in the affairs of mankind. Notice this truth in Proverbs 21 and verse

00:42:21.399 --> 00:42:28.679
number 1, the King's heart is in the hand of the Lord. As the rivers of water, He turneth

00:42:28.679 --> 00:42:36.399
it, the King's heart, whithersoever He will. So the question basically is this this morning,

00:42:36.399 --> 00:42:44.999
do we believe God? Do we believe God? Do we believe that in 2024 that God is still on

00:42:44.999 --> 00:42:50.839
His throne? Do we believe in 2024 that God still has a plan and that God is still able,

00:42:51.239 --> 00:42:57.479
listen, whoever you want to accuse of whatever you want to accuse them of with regard to the

00:42:57.479 --> 00:43:01.639
results of an election, I want to remind you that God's in control. Here's the thing that's

00:43:01.639 --> 00:43:06.119
important for us to understand. There were people that tried to bring me, I mean, I had

00:43:06.119 --> 00:43:11.399
videos sent to me in 2020 and I had documents printed out and sent to me in 2020. I had

00:43:11.399 --> 00:43:15.879
videos, Bart, that were, I mean, like 40 hours long of videos. I ain't watching them, man.

00:43:16.839 --> 00:43:21.279
I don't have time for that. I'm just being honest with you. You say, I watched every

00:43:21.279 --> 00:43:26.059
single one of them. I'm sorry. I'm being honest. I'm sorry. Because what it did is it messed

00:43:26.059 --> 00:43:34.919
with your head. And it caused you to not have a right view of God. Because even if all that

00:43:34.919 --> 00:43:42.959
stuff happened, you know what the bottom line is? God allowed it to happen. God allowed

00:43:42.959 --> 00:43:49.319
it to happen. And we must acknowledge that this morning. So, what do we do? How do we

00:43:49.319 --> 00:43:54.519
respond? How is it that we can cope with the results of an election? See, the reality is

00:43:54.519 --> 00:44:01.479
that in America, elections have boiled down basically to two individuals or two parties.

00:44:01.479 --> 00:44:09.899
Okay? And so, I'm not here to say how or who or any of that sort of thing. I'm simply giving

00:44:09.939 --> 00:44:15.659
you biblical principles. I think that as we study our Bibles, we have an individual responsibility.

00:44:15.659 --> 00:44:19.499
But the reality is that the one that has to be able to cope with the election results

00:44:19.499 --> 00:44:24.959
is the one that's in that situation. They're going to begin to look at some of these things

00:44:24.959 --> 00:44:28.919
and maybe their particular candidate didn't win and they wanted them to or whatever the

00:44:28.919 --> 00:44:33.659
case may be. But I have to acknowledge that God's on His throne, that God's in control.

00:44:33.659 --> 00:44:41.259
And therefore, number one, I trust the Lord. I trust the Lord. Can I tell you this morning,

00:44:41.259 --> 00:44:51.339
can I remind you this morning, that as Bible believers, our hope is not in the White House.

00:44:51.339 --> 00:45:02.379
Sometimes I fear that we say that but don't really believe that. Our hope is not in the

00:45:02.379 --> 00:45:07.539
White House. Our hope is not in the State House. Our hope is not in Wall Street. Our

00:45:07.539 --> 00:45:16.719
hope is in Jesus Christ, who is King of Kings. And for that, we trust Him. We trust Him.

00:45:16.719 --> 00:45:21.579
We come to that place where we say, I'm trusting the Lord, that His plan is perfect, that He

00:45:21.579 --> 00:45:29.559
knows what He is doing. Blessed, in Psalm 2, in verse number 12, blessed are all they

00:45:29.719 --> 00:45:36.679
that put their trust in Him. Psalm 20, in verse number 7, some trust in chariots and

00:45:36.679 --> 00:45:45.959
some in horses, but we will remember the name of the Lord our God. Listen, don't be putting

00:45:45.959 --> 00:45:50.719
your trust and confidence in the wrong thing. Isaiah talks about the fact that they were

00:45:50.719 --> 00:45:56.319
trusting in Egypt. That's the picture of the world. They weren't trusting the living God.

00:45:56.319 --> 00:46:00.039
They were trusting in Egypt. Jeremiah 17, in verse number 7, it says, blessed is the

00:46:00.039 --> 00:46:05.999
man that trusteth in the Lord and whose hope the Lord is. There was a recent, I'll just

00:46:05.999 --> 00:46:10.119
say this to be pretty generic about it, but in the time that I've been here, this is the

00:46:10.119 --> 00:46:13.879
fourth election cycle, presidential election cycle, that I've had the privilege of being

00:46:13.879 --> 00:46:19.839
the pastor through. And the reality is that during one of those, somebody that's not a

00:46:19.839 --> 00:46:26.079
member of our church, never really attended our church, but a Christian worker, actually,

00:46:26.079 --> 00:46:30.119
from another church and heavily involved in some ministry things, after the result

00:46:30.119 --> 00:46:35.199
of one of those elections over the four cycles that I've been here, sent an email with this

00:46:35.199 --> 00:46:41.999
verse of Scripture and said, we have hope because of the result of the election. And

00:46:41.999 --> 00:46:49.039
I was absolutely furious. And I sent the individual an email and I said, listen, we have hope

00:46:49.039 --> 00:46:58.439
because Jesus is on His throne. Listen, if on November 6th you become depressed, your

00:46:58.439 --> 00:47:04.779
eyes aren't on Jesus. You're not trusting the Lord like you should be. Because regardless

00:47:04.779 --> 00:47:09.679
of what the result of the election is, my God's still on the throne. And my God still

00:47:09.679 --> 00:47:13.599
has a purpose. And my God still has a plan. And He's still going to use us. And by the

00:47:13.599 --> 00:47:20.639
way, one day I'm going to heaven. Hallelujah. This world is not my home. I'm just a passing

00:47:20.639 --> 00:47:24.519
through. My treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue. That's what the songwriter

00:47:24.519 --> 00:47:30.239
said. And we need to start living like that. But the reality is that if we take the perspective

00:47:30.239 --> 00:47:38.119
that God is in control, only if my candidate wins, you are not understanding the truth

00:47:38.119 --> 00:47:44.879
of the Bible. You cannot say, because my candidate wins, that God is in control. And

00:47:44.879 --> 00:47:50.039
then if your candidate loses, you say, well, God must not be in control. They did this,

00:47:50.039 --> 00:47:57.239
they did… No, no, no, no, no. God is in control regardless. And we have to understand

00:47:57.239 --> 00:48:03.719
that. So what do I do? Number one, I trust in the Lord. Number two, I rejoice. I rejoice.

00:48:03.719 --> 00:48:09.979
You know what Jesus said in Luke? Those disciples came back because the spirits were made subject

00:48:09.979 --> 00:48:15.239
to them, and they were rejoicing, man. They saw the power of God demonstrated. And Jesus

00:48:15.239 --> 00:48:22.959
said this, don't rejoice in that. But rather rejoice, why? Because your names are written

00:48:22.959 --> 00:48:30.599
in the book. Listen, this morning, it does not matter who wins an election in this nation

00:48:30.599 --> 00:48:37.799
with regard to my eternity. I'm going to rejoice. Psalm 5 and verse number 11, but

00:48:37.799 --> 00:48:41.679
let all those that put their trust in thee, what? Rejoice. I said, number one, we must

00:48:41.679 --> 00:48:47.579
trust Him. But if I put my trust in Him, then I must rejoice. Let them ever shout for joy,

00:48:47.579 --> 00:48:52.279
because thou defendest them. Let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee. Can

00:48:52.279 --> 00:48:58.059
I tell you that really, if you study the church history, there has never been a nation like

00:48:58.059 --> 00:49:03.859
our nation that has had as much liberty and freedom for a church as we have experienced.

00:49:03.859 --> 00:49:11.139
And you know what's happening? We're doing less for God today than we ever have. There

00:49:11.139 --> 00:49:15.339
literally, last week, Brother Hummel stood in this pulpit and said, America is now in

00:49:15.339 --> 00:49:21.000
the place where we need missionaries to come to her. Where we used to be the number one

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:27.880
sending mission field of the, or mission sender of the entire world. And guess what?

00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:32.339
England was that at one point. And if you go to England today, you find that church

00:49:32.339 --> 00:49:37.159
after church after church has been turned into pubs, has been turned into apartments,

00:49:37.159 --> 00:49:43.479
has been turned into mosques. And guess what has to happen in England? We have missionaries

00:49:43.479 --> 00:49:50.719
that we support from the U.S. going to England. America's not far behind. But you know what

00:49:50.719 --> 00:49:54.799
I'm going to do? I'm going to trust in the Lord. And I'm going to rejoice because my

00:49:54.799 --> 00:50:01.000
God's on His throne. And I'm going to rejoice because God is able. Listen, can I say this?

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.480
Number three, continue.

00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:05.519
It's been our theme for this whole year.

00:50:05.519 --> 00:50:06.519
It's been our theme.

00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:11.140
The truth of 2 Timothy 3, verses 13 and 14.

00:50:11.140 --> 00:50:13.439
But evil men and seducers shall wax in worse and worse,

00:50:13.439 --> 00:50:15.140
deceiving and being deceived.

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:19.639
Isn't it interesting that God reveals that truth to us?

00:50:19.639 --> 00:50:21.399
And then right after revealing that truth to us

00:50:21.399 --> 00:50:24.340
in verse 13 says, but continue, in verse 14.

00:50:25.959 --> 00:50:27.879
But the evil men are waxing worse and worse.

00:50:27.879 --> 00:50:29.440
I mean, they're deceiving and they're being deceived.

00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:31.040
I mean, it's bad, it's perilous times

00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:33.040
is how it starts in chapter three in verse one.

00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:34.680
And all of this is going on.

00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:35.500
What are we supposed to do?

00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:36.880
Continue.

00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:37.720
Continue in what?

00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:41.479
Continue thou in the things which thou hast learned

00:50:41.479 --> 00:50:44.119
and has been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast

00:50:44.119 --> 00:50:44.959
learned them.

00:50:44.959 --> 00:50:47.759
And we find that as we look at this truth,

00:50:47.759 --> 00:50:50.900
that we as the church of God, we must continue.

00:50:50.900 --> 00:50:51.740
We don't give up.

00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:52.720
We don't run for the hills.

00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:56.959
We don't, do you remember what Jesus said in Matthew 16?

00:50:56.959 --> 00:50:59.299
He said, I will build my church.

00:51:00.139 --> 00:51:05.139
And the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.

00:51:05.419 --> 00:51:09.540
This morning, we must put our trust in the Lord.

00:51:09.540 --> 00:51:11.339
We must rejoice in him.

00:51:11.339 --> 00:51:16.260
And we must continue until the trumpet sounds.

00:51:16.260 --> 00:51:18.260
I believe that one day, and I think it's soon

00:51:18.260 --> 00:51:21.019
that the trumpet of the Lord is gonna sound.

00:51:21.019 --> 00:51:22.660
We're gonna be raptured out of here.

00:51:22.660 --> 00:51:26.300
But until then, God's given us a responsibility.

00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:31.139
And we must understand that the Bible must influence

00:51:31.139 --> 00:51:33.860
how we cast a ballot.

00:51:33.860 --> 00:51:36.459
But then the Bible must also influence on how I cope

00:51:36.459 --> 00:51:38.059
with the results of an election.

00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:42.379
This morning, I'm gonna use a quote from someone

00:51:42.379 --> 00:51:44.699
that perhaps you've heard the quote before.

00:51:44.699 --> 00:51:49.699
I thought it was so pertinent to our thought this morning.

00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:52.379
But Booker T. Washington said this,

00:51:52.419 --> 00:51:56.819
a lie doesn't become truth, wrong doesn't become right,

00:51:56.819 --> 00:51:58.339
and evil doesn't become good,

00:51:58.339 --> 00:52:01.680
just because it's accepted by a majority.

00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:05.940
What defines, what is truth?

00:52:05.940 --> 00:52:08.019
Well, Jesus is truth.

00:52:08.019 --> 00:52:09.779
But then he said that he gave us his word,

00:52:09.779 --> 00:52:11.440
and his word is truth.

00:52:12.580 --> 00:52:14.619
He said, sanctify them through thy word.

00:52:14.619 --> 00:52:17.779
Thy word is truth.

00:52:17.779 --> 00:52:20.059
We must filter everything through the Bible.

00:52:20.059 --> 00:52:21.699
It means that we have to be Bible students.

00:52:21.740 --> 00:52:24.220
We have to know our Bibles.

00:52:24.220 --> 00:52:27.619
It says here that wrong doesn't become right.

00:52:27.619 --> 00:52:28.740
Who defines wrong?

00:52:28.740 --> 00:52:29.779
Who defines right?

00:52:29.779 --> 00:52:31.460
God does.

00:52:31.460 --> 00:52:33.699
Remember the one came to Jesus and said, good master?

00:52:33.699 --> 00:52:36.020
He said, why callest thou me good?

00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:37.979
There's one good, that's God.

00:52:37.979 --> 00:52:41.419
Well, Jesus is God, and he defines what's good,

00:52:41.419 --> 00:52:44.139
and he defines what's evil.

00:52:44.139 --> 00:52:47.979
And here it says that the third part here,

00:52:47.979 --> 00:52:49.419
evil doesn't become good.

00:52:50.259 --> 00:52:53.360
I understand this morning,

00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:55.660
we start getting into, well, the majority.

00:52:57.100 --> 00:52:58.860
It's never been about the majority.

00:53:00.259 --> 00:53:03.520
We don't make decisions based upon the majority.

00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:07.220
We make decisions based upon the truth of God's word.

00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:10.259
And so I submit to you this morning,

00:53:11.259 --> 00:53:13.500
as I used this line at the very beginning,

00:53:13.500 --> 00:53:17.020
that your Bible and my Bible should influence my ballot.

00:53:17.919 --> 00:53:22.820
There are biblical principles that we must understand

00:53:23.820 --> 00:53:25.440
in casting a ballot.

00:53:26.380 --> 00:53:29.460
We must no longer allow the politicians

00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:33.979
to hijack biblical truth and politicize it

00:53:33.979 --> 00:53:36.500
and then demand that you don't speak about it

00:53:36.500 --> 00:53:38.580
and that I don't speak about it,

00:53:38.580 --> 00:53:41.139
because their Bible matters.

00:53:42.020 --> 00:53:45.979
And if we're Christians, if we're followers of Jesus Christ,

00:53:45.979 --> 00:53:49.139
the Bible must influence how I vote.

00:53:49.139 --> 00:53:51.119
It influences how I live.

00:53:52.220 --> 00:53:54.300
And then how do we cope with it?

00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:55.740
Say, I don't know what's gonna happen.

00:53:55.740 --> 00:53:56.699
You don't know what's gonna happen,

00:53:56.699 --> 00:53:58.419
and if you keep watching the polls every day,

00:53:58.419 --> 00:54:00.119
you're gonna go absolutely insane.

00:54:01.940 --> 00:54:03.380
I'm telling you, it's crazy.

00:54:05.059 --> 00:54:06.539
So you know what I do?

00:54:06.539 --> 00:54:08.580
I just choose to focus on Jesus.

00:54:09.660 --> 00:54:12.660
I sat here this morning and I was praying for our service.

00:54:12.660 --> 00:54:14.460
I sat right here and I was praying this morning

00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:16.059
for a while in the sanctuary.

00:54:18.059 --> 00:54:19.579
It was just, you know, we pray,

00:54:19.579 --> 00:54:21.779
we're in the presence of God.

00:54:21.779 --> 00:54:24.940
I was just thanking the Lord for how great He is

00:54:24.940 --> 00:54:28.040
and the peace that He gives and the joy that He gives.

00:54:28.040 --> 00:54:30.220
We live in a world that's full of turmoil,

00:54:31.140 --> 00:54:36.140
chaos, confusion, but God has given us the truth.

00:54:37.179 --> 00:54:39.619
And this morning, we must allow the truth

00:54:39.619 --> 00:54:43.899
to impact every area of our lives.

00:54:43.899 --> 00:54:44.739
Let's pray together.

00:54:44.739 --> 00:54:46.380
Father, we love You.

00:54:46.380 --> 00:54:47.579
We thank You for loving us.

00:54:47.579 --> 00:54:50.660
We thank You for Your Word.

00:54:50.660 --> 00:54:53.459
This morning, we looked at so many verses of Scripture

00:54:53.459 --> 00:54:57.779
and quickly deal with so many matters that we face.

00:54:57.779 --> 00:55:00.660
And God, I hope that this morning,

00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:03.299
every individual has been able to see the truth

00:55:03.299 --> 00:55:07.040
that these are biblical matters.

00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:12.260
God, I pray that You would help us to remember

00:55:12.260 --> 00:55:14.940
with great clarity and conviction

00:55:14.940 --> 00:55:17.359
the reason that You've left us here,

00:55:17.359 --> 00:55:19.440
to be Your witnesses, to be Your ambassadors.

00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:22.399
You've given to us the ministry of reconciliation.

00:55:24.220 --> 00:55:26.619
God, I pray that You would help each and every one of us,

00:55:26.619 --> 00:55:29.600
Lord, to keep our eyes on Jesus.

00:55:31.660 --> 00:55:34.500
Let come what may, You rule and You reign.

00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:36.859
You are King forever and ever.

00:55:37.779 --> 00:55:40.059
And yes, we live in this incursed world

00:55:40.059 --> 00:55:43.660
and we're ruled by other humans

00:55:43.660 --> 00:55:46.500
because long ago, we rejected,

00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:49.019
humanity rejected Your rulership.

00:55:52.019 --> 00:55:55.000
And God, we pray that You would help us

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:58.480
to be the salt and the light You've called us to be,

00:56:00.079 --> 00:56:03.920
that we would trust You, rejoice in You,

00:56:04.899 --> 00:56:06.859
and that we would continue.

00:56:06.859 --> 00:56:09.859
I pray that You'd use us for Your honor and for Your glory.

00:56:10.820 --> 00:56:13.859
Help us, Lord, to be people of the book.

00:56:13.859 --> 00:56:15.459
Well, thank You, God, for what You'll do

00:56:15.459 --> 00:56:16.760
in this moment of invitation.

00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:18.100
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:56:18.100 --> 00:56:18.940
Would you stand?
