1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,199
2 Kings 6, we'll be looking at verses 1-7 this evening

2
00:00:05,199 --> 00:00:09,399
as we continue our study through the life of Elijah and Elisha.

3
00:00:09,399 --> 00:00:12,800
Of course, we've been dealing with the life of Elisha for many weeks now

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,399
and we'll continue this evening.

5
00:00:14,399 --> 00:00:17,600
But in 2 Kings 6, verses 1-7,

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,000
we'll look at this passage of Scripture.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,200
You'll recall with me that the content of 2 Kings 5 is exciting.

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,600
You read all of the account there.

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,399
We spent three weeks in 2 Kings 5

10
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:34,400
looking at the interaction between Naaman and the little maid.

11
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,000
And then, of course, Naaman coming to the house of Elisha

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,599
and the healing of Naaman.

13
00:00:39,599 --> 00:00:41,799
And then, of course, the sin of Gehazi

14
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:44,200
as we looked at last Wednesday evening.

15
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,599
And what a great passage of Scripture

16
00:00:46,599 --> 00:00:50,200
that not only some exciting substance

17
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,799
and seeing what God is able to do and how God is working,

18
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:58,400
but we find that there are many valuable lessons for each of us today

19
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,400
even as we study this Old Testament passage of Scripture,

20
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,799
the account that's been given to us there.

21
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:08,199
As we continue to trace the steps of the prophet Elisha,

22
00:01:08,199 --> 00:01:11,199
we find now as we come to 2 Kings 6,

23
00:01:11,199 --> 00:01:13,400
a record that is given to us

24
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,599
really about a building project, if you will.

25
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:19,199
We find that this building project

26
00:01:19,199 --> 00:01:22,000
was really led by some of the sons of the prophets.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,599
You'll remember over several of our studies in recent weeks,

28
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:28,199
we've made reference to these sons of the prophets.

29
00:01:28,199 --> 00:01:31,400
And we found that there were many of them in chapter number 2

30
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:36,400
as Elisha was accompanying Elijah before his translation.

31
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,800
And as they went from each town,

32
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,800
we found that there were some that would gather and make statements.

33
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:47,599
And we found that as we've gone through the passages of Scripture

34
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:49,599
and we came to the end of chapter number 4,

35
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,400
how that Elisha was there,

36
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,599
there was a dearth in the land there in Gilgal.

37
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:58,800
He was teaching, instructing these sons of the prophets.

38
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,199
And we find that there was death in the pot and God worked.

39
00:02:03,199 --> 00:02:08,199
And through Elisha giving instruction with regard to the meal

40
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,600
and so on and so forth.

41
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,600
And so we've seen some reference to these sons of the prophets.

42
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,399
And we come to chapter number 6

43
00:02:14,399 --> 00:02:17,000
and we see some interaction that's recorded for us

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,399
between these sons of the prophets and Elisha.

45
00:02:19,399 --> 00:02:22,199
And we see this project that is ongoing.

46
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:24,399
Notice with me in verse number 1, the Bible says,

47
00:02:24,399 --> 00:02:27,399
And the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha,

48
00:02:27,399 --> 00:02:34,600
Behold now, the place where we dwell with thee is too straight for us.

49
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:39,000
Let us go, we pray thee, unto Jordan and take thence every man a beam

50
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,199
and let us make us a place there where we may dwell.

51
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:45,000
And he answered, Go ye.

52
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,800
One said, Be content, I pray thee, and go with thy servants.

53
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,800
And he answered, I will go.

54
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,199
So he went with them and when they came to Jordan,

55
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:57,000
they cut down wood.

56
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,199
But as one was felling a beam, the axe head fell into the water

57
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:06,399
and he cried and said, Alas, master, for it was borrowed.

58
00:03:06,399 --> 00:03:11,000
The man of God said, Where fell it?

59
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,399
And he showed him the place and he cut down a stick and cast it in thither.

60
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:21,800
And the iron did swim.

61
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,199
Therefore said he, Take it up to thee.

62
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:28,399
And he put out his hand and took it.

63
00:03:28,399 --> 00:03:31,399
That's an amazing passage of Scripture.

64
00:03:31,399 --> 00:03:36,199
Again, we look at the miracles of the Bible and if we're not careful,

65
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:38,800
we can just kind of, oh yeah, I heard that before,

66
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,000
and just kind of move over.

67
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,199
But this is a wonderful passage of Scripture.

68
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:46,399
This is an event that happened in the life of Elisha

69
00:03:46,399 --> 00:03:49,000
and the lives of these sons of the prophets

70
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,399
that were preparing and being taught.

71
00:03:51,399 --> 00:03:53,600
And we find that as we look at the passage of Scripture,

72
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,600
if you're taking notes this evening,

73
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,000
I've simply entitled the message tonight,

74
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,199
The Iron Did Swim.

75
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,800
We see that at the end of verse number six.

76
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,399
The iron did swim.

77
00:04:04,399 --> 00:04:06,000
2 Kings 6 verses 1 through 7.

78
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,600
Notice with me, as we look at the passage of Scripture,

79
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,000
number one, an honorable work.

80
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,600
An honorable work.

81
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,399
We find that as we look at this passage of Scripture,

82
00:04:15,399 --> 00:04:17,000
as we come to verse number one,

83
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,399
and we see the interaction that is recorded for us

84
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:22,200
between Elisha and these sons of the prophets,

85
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,600
that these sons of the prophets,

86
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,799
they take the initiative and they go to Elisha.

87
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:30,399
And I want you to notice that they say to Elisha,

88
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:36,600
behold now, the place where we dwell with thee is too straight for us.

89
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,000
See, this is an honorable work.

90
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,200
If you're taking notes, we notice, first of all, the honorable work.

91
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,200
Why would we say that it's an honorable work?

92
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,200
Well, there was a need.

93
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,799
There was a need.

94
00:04:47,799 --> 00:04:49,600
You find that the sons of the prophets,

95
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,000
they're recognizing that this place is too small for us.

96
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And as we would understand what's taking place,

97
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
it would seem to indicate to us

98
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,399
that there's an increase of the prophets that are being instructed,

99
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:04,799
and therefore, they need more room.

100
00:05:04,799 --> 00:05:06,000
They're out of space.

101
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,600
Now, that's a good thing.

102
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,000
And I'm thankful for the initiative that these men take

103
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
in approaching Elisha,

104
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,399
and they notice that there's a problem,

105
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:18,000
but they don't just say, well, here's a problem, Elisha.

106
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Would you deal with it?

107
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
No, it's an honorable work.

108
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,200
They identify the problem, but then they provide a solution,

109
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:30,600
and we find that they seek the permission of Elisha, the man of God.

110
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,200
Notice in verse number two,

111
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,200
let us go, we pray thee, unto Jordan,

112
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:40,000
and take thence every man a bean.

113
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,399
And let us make us a place there where we may dwell.

114
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:46,600
They sought the permission from Elisha,

115
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,799
and we find that Elisha granted permission.

116
00:05:49,799 --> 00:05:52,399
You notice at the end of verse number two, he answered,

117
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:54,000
Go ye.

118
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So they recognized that there was a problem,

119
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
but they said, here's a solution.

120
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,399
We can go and we can get some beans,

121
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:05,000
and we can make a place for us to dwell.

122
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,600
See, because this place is too small, it's too straight for us.

123
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,399
There's not enough room, and we need more room.

124
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:14,000
And so here, Elisha, here's what we're seeking.

125
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Would you grant us permission that we go to Jordan,

126
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,399
and every man takes a bean,

127
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:20,799
and there we build a place where we may dwell.

128
00:06:20,799 --> 00:06:22,399
And Elisha says, go ye.

129
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:25,399
We find that they then asked Elisha

130
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:28,000
if they would join on this endeavor.

131
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,399
The Bible says in verse number three,

132
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:30,799
that one says to Elisha,

133
00:06:30,799 --> 00:06:34,600
Be content, I pray thee, and go with thy servants.

134
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,399
And he said, I will go.

135
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:41,200
Now, in my mind's eye, as I look at this passage of Scripture

136
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,000
and consider a sanctified imagination,

137
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,200
I see these guys that are gathered together.

138
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,600
They identify the problem.

139
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,200
They provide a solution.

140
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,799
They receive permission.

141
00:06:50,799 --> 00:06:53,000
And they say, Elisha, we want you to go with us.

142
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,200
Now, in your mind's eye this evening, in your imagination,

143
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,200
can you see these men leaving from the place where they are,

144
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,399
going down to Jordan?

145
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:02,600
I mean, this is an old-fashioned work day.

146
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,399
Let's go cut down some beans so that we can have the wood,

147
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:07,200
so that we can build a place to dwell.

148
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,600
This is an honorable work.

149
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,000
This is a good thing that they're engaged in.

150
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,799
They were not doing something that would be in disobedience

151
00:07:15,799 --> 00:07:17,799
to what God has commanded.

152
00:07:17,799 --> 00:07:22,600
They were not in violation of any of God's laws or principles.

153
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,399
They were not violating the authority of Elisha.

154
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:29,200
In fact, they sought his permission before they went to go.

155
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,200
This is an honorable work.

156
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,399
See, they got busy doing the work.

157
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:35,600
I believe that the work that we look at here

158
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,000
in 2 Kings chapter number 6, not only is it necessary,

159
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,200
it's honorable.

160
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,200
We find that the Bible says, so he's, in verse number 4,

161
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,600
speaking of Elisha, went with them,

162
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,799
speaking of these sons of the prophets.

163
00:07:47,799 --> 00:07:51,600
And when they came to Jordan, they cut down wood.

164
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,399
Now, I enjoy cutting down wood with a chainsaw, amen?

165
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:58,200
And you get a good chainsaw, and you kind of just

166
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,000
can have a good time.

167
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
And I believe that in a certain way,

168
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
it almost helps to relieve some stress.

169
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,399
And I enjoy using an ax every once in a while as well,

170
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:14,399
but I will admit that I enjoyed that about 20 years ago

171
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:17,200
more than I enjoy that today.

172
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,799
But it's enjoyable.

173
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:22,399
Get some work done, and they go.

174
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:24,799
And I mean, again, can you see what's happening

175
00:08:24,799 --> 00:08:26,799
where they recognize the problem,

176
00:08:26,799 --> 00:08:29,600
and they provide a solution, and they go,

177
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:34,000
and they're all together in the work.

178
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,599
The sons of the prophets, I don't know how many are there,

179
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,000
but they're all there, and Elisha's there,

180
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,599
and they're working.

181
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:42,000
They're cutting down wood.

182
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,200
It's an honorable work.

183
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,400
There's an unfortunate loss that is given to us

184
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,000
in verse number 5.

185
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
The Bible now turns as we go through the dialogue here

186
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
as we're reading this record that is provided to us

187
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,400
of this historical account.

188
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,799
It now focuses upon an individual

189
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:02,400
that was engaged in the work.

190
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,000
There was an individual there who was felling a bean.

191
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,200
He was busy working.

192
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,400
He had that ax, and he's chopping away.

193
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,000
I mean, he's right there in the work.

194
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
He's not lazy.

195
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,400
He's not on the sideline.

196
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,400
He's not letting somebody else do the work.

197
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,200
No, he's engaged in this honorable work.

198
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,799
He's not a spectator.

199
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:22,000
He's a participator.

200
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,400
He's in, and he's cutting down a tree.

201
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,000
And the Bible says in verse number 5,

202
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,200
but as one was felling a bean,

203
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:35,599
the ax head fell into the water.

204
00:09:35,599 --> 00:09:37,799
We find that the Bible tells us

205
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:39,599
of this unfortunate loss

206
00:09:39,599 --> 00:09:42,599
that this ax head is now in the water,

207
00:09:42,599 --> 00:09:45,799
and we know that an iron ax head

208
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:47,400
will do what in water?

209
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,000
It sinks.

210
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It sinks.

211
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,400
We find that as we look at this passage of Scripture

212
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:59,000
and we find that which is taking place for us,

213
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
and we...

214
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,960
look at what's going on, we find that the principles of physics

215
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,519
would teach us that that axe head is

216
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:10,800
going to sink in the water.

217
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,239
And those principles of physics, the laws of physics,

218
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:18,559
if you will, they are, in fact, carried out.

219
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:21,239
And we find that this man cries.

220
00:10:21,239 --> 00:10:24,840
And notice, he says, alas, master.

221
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,760
Who's he speaking to?

222
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,479
He's speaking to Elisha.

223
00:10:27,479 --> 00:10:29,840
I bet you some, I don't know if this is the same fellow

224
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,559
that invited Elisha to come, but I'm

225
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:34,880
sure thinking that he's happy that Elisha's there.

226
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,680
Amen, it'd be kind of interesting

227
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,319
if it was the same fellow that invited Elisha.

228
00:10:39,319 --> 00:10:41,880
Because the Bible says that in verse number three,

229
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:47,439
and one said, be content, I pray thee, and go with thy servants.

230
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:49,520
And he answered, I will go.

231
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,080
I'm not telling you this evening that it's the same person,

232
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,599
but I'm just saying it'd be interesting if it was.

233
00:10:55,599 --> 00:10:57,599
But even if it wasn't the same person,

234
00:10:57,599 --> 00:10:59,840
I believe that the fellow that's cutting down the tree

235
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,959
is quite happy that Elisha's there.

236
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:07,720
When he cries out to Elisha, I want you to notice what he says.

237
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:14,199
He says, alas, master, for it was borrowed.

238
00:11:14,199 --> 00:11:15,319
What's he speaking about?

239
00:11:15,319 --> 00:11:18,440
He's speaking about this axe head that now is

240
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,239
missing this unfortunate loss.

241
00:11:20,239 --> 00:11:22,559
We would find that it's this unnamed man that

242
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:25,639
is given to us here as he's called out

243
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:27,319
to Elisha for assistance.

244
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:31,319
He reveals to Elisha the situation not only

245
00:11:31,319 --> 00:11:36,440
of the loss, but the fact that this axe head was borrowed.

246
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,160
Really, I believe that it reveals to us

247
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,080
the poverty of these individuals.

248
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,000
The fact that they were going to engage in a work,

249
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,559
and they were understanding that this was a necessary work.

250
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:50,239
It was an honorable work.

251
00:11:50,239 --> 00:11:54,160
And they were going to expand their place of residence.

252
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,639
And it was a project that they were engaged in.

253
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,279
And they were involved together.

254
00:11:58,279 --> 00:11:59,480
And Elisha was there.

255
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,199
And the sons of the prophets were there.

256
00:12:01,199 --> 00:12:02,279
But they were poor.

257
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:05,000
And they had to borrow an axe.

258
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,679
And now that which is borrowed is missing.

259
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:09,720
It's unfortunate.

260
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,160
If he didn't have money to buy his own axe,

261
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,240
surely he'd have a hard time getting money

262
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,320
to replace the axe that's now been lost.

263
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,119
I want you to think about this just for a moment.

264
00:12:22,119 --> 00:12:25,080
Sometimes we look at these types of situations,

265
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:28,520
and we say something like this.

266
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:32,080
Why do bad things happen to good people?

267
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,199
You ever heard somebody say that?

268
00:12:34,199 --> 00:12:35,679
Maybe we'd ask the question.

269
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:38,399
Sometimes people say, I was doing something good,

270
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,119
and this bad thing happened.

271
00:12:41,119 --> 00:12:43,160
Yeah, it happens.

272
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:47,279
The work that these men were engaged in was a good work.

273
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,720
They were not doing anything in violation

274
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,000
to any of God's laws or principles.

275
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,800
They had the blessing of their master.

276
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,839
The man of God, the prophet Elisha, he said, go ye.

277
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:01,360
In fact, he went with them.

278
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,559
And they're engaged in the work.

279
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:06,080
But yet, the axe head is lost.

280
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,600
The axe head is lost.

281
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,639
And as we think about the context of what's going on,

282
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,679
and we think about the situation for this man, for some of us

283
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:18,440
today, we might say, what's the big deal?

284
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:18,919
An axe head.

285
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:19,800
Just go buy a new one.

286
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,000
Just go replace it.

287
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,759
It was borrowed.

288
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:25,399
He didn't have the resources.

289
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:27,160
Some of us might have the resources.

290
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:27,839
Yeah, I broke it.

291
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:28,839
I'll just go replace it.

292
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:29,339
It's fine.

293
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:30,320
No big deal.

294
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,800
And we don't even think twice about it.

295
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,679
But for this man, in this circumstance,

296
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:38,479
this was a major situation.

297
00:13:38,479 --> 00:13:41,000
It was a real problem at hand.

298
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,800
And we find that as this situation is unfolding,

299
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:49,240
we would understand this evening that there

300
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,160
are times in which we can be engaged in a good thing,

301
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,720
and something unfortunate happens.

302
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:00,160
Something that we could look at and say, why did that happen?

303
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,479
I was doing right.

304
00:14:01,479 --> 00:14:03,600
I was doing good.

305
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,839
Can I tell you that sometimes, even

306
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,000
in the midst of doing a good thing,

307
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,119
we might have something that appears

308
00:14:10,119 --> 00:14:13,559
to be at surface level unfortunate,

309
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:16,920
but God is going to show himself mighty.

310
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,920
God's always at work in our lives.

311
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,079
I believe that.

312
00:14:21,079 --> 00:14:23,559
I believe that God's always at work in your life.

313
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:27,200
He's always seeking to develop his people.

314
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:31,160
He's always seeking to receive glory unto himself.

315
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,679
And he works in and through circumstances and situations

316
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:36,799
in life so that we would be developed,

317
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,880
so that he would be glorified.

318
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,239
And here, I believe that though these individuals were

319
00:14:42,239 --> 00:14:45,799
engaged in honorable work, yes, there's an unfortunate loss.

320
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:48,160
But oh, God's going to work.

321
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,920
And God's going to work in such a way

322
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,559
that something miraculous is going to happen.

323
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,839
And we find that these individuals no doubt

324
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:58,760
would have had their faith increased.

325
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,880
But even now, thousands of years later,

326
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,880
we have the opportunity to read of this account that

327
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,679
took place in this man's life.

328
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:09,600
And we can say, man, look at how God worked.

329
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,079
Look at when it increases my faith.

330
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:17,000
It helps me to understand what my God is able to do.

331
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,079
We find that there's an honorable work in which they're

332
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,119
engaged in.

333
00:15:21,119 --> 00:15:23,320
We find that there's an unfortunate loss.

334
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,079
And notice with me, as we look at the remainder

335
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,640
of the text of Scripture in verses 6 and 7,

336
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,200
there is a miraculous recovery.

337
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,040
A miraculous recovery.

338
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,239
We notice in verse number 6 that the man of God said,

339
00:15:36,239 --> 00:15:37,799
where fell it?

340
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:38,799
Where fell it?

341
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,399
As I study the life of Elisha, as you've

342
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,799
joined me over these last many weeks,

343
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:51,839
and really this is our 26th lesson on Elijah and Elisha.

344
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,799
So we've been at this for a while.

345
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:58,559
And it's amazing to me how so many times, specifically

346
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:02,760
in the life of Elisha, he asks very simple questions.

347
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:07,320
He gives very simple instruction.

348
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,399
Where fell it?

349
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:11,160
Can you imagine?

350
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,600
I believe that Elisha has a calm demeanor.

351
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,160
I mean, just in my sanctified imagination, I see this fella.

352
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,880
He's kind of beside himself.

353
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:23,440
Alas, master, it was borrowed, right?

354
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,399
I mean, he's kind of.

355
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:28,000
And Elisha just calmly in his calm demeanor

356
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,239
comes over and says, where fell it?

357
00:16:32,239 --> 00:16:34,679
Where fell it?

358
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:36,799
And he showed him the place.

359
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:39,200
Can you see it in your mind's eye?

360
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,000
Can you see it unfolding at the river?

361
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,040
I mean, I just have this picture in my mind of the anxiety,

362
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,239
the anxiousness of this individual

363
00:16:49,239 --> 00:16:52,359
as he's concerned about this lost ax head.

364
00:16:52,359 --> 00:16:54,600
And Elisha says, where fell it?

365
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,839
And he shows him the place.

366
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,839
Elisha is right over here.

367
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,160
And he shows him the place.

368
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,040
And Elisha, the Bible tells us in verse number six,

369
00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:07,519
it says that he cut down a stick and cast it in thither.

370
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:08,640
Now, just hold on right there.

371
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,559
I know the verse doesn't end there.

372
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:14,040
But put yourself in the position of the man

373
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,760
that had the lost ax.

374
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:22,079
He cuts down, the Bible says, a stick and cast it in thither.

375
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:26,519
Can I ask you, what is that gonna do, right?

376
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:27,839
Maybe you'd ask the question.

377
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,119
That's probably what I would ask.

378
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:31,119
And I'm just being transparent with you this evening.

379
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,320
Just like in chapter number four,

380
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,040
when there was death in the pot, remember?

381
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,480
And Elisha said, get some meal.

382
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,440
And he said, cast it in.

383
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:44,040
And we find that they brought the meal, flour.

384
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:47,480
There was death in the pot.

385
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,079
And the Bible says, when they brought the meal,

386
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:50,040
that he put it in.

387
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,920
And then he says, eat.

388
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,079
And they ate.

389
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:57,079
And it was good.

390
00:17:57,079 --> 00:17:58,920
Sustenance satisfied them.

391
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,079
God healed it.

392
00:18:01,959 --> 00:18:05,880
And now we find that Elisha cuts down a stick

393
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,959
and he cast it in thither,

394
00:18:07,959 --> 00:18:10,839
in the place where the man showed him.

395
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:12,720
Here's where it fell.

396
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,880
Because that's the question that Elisha asked.

397
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,679
Where fell it?

398
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,399
And he cuts down the stick

399
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,399
and he cast it in that same place.

400
00:18:24,399 --> 00:18:28,279
And the Bible says, the iron did swim.

401
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:30,920
That's amazing.

402
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:36,760
The principles of physics,

403
00:18:37,239 --> 00:18:41,520
the law of physics was overcome in this moment.

404
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:44,960
Iron doesn't swim.

405
00:18:46,479 --> 00:18:47,320
Amen?

406
00:18:48,239 --> 00:18:52,479
You can look, and I don't wanna get all into it this evening

407
00:18:52,479 --> 00:18:54,320
but you can look at Archimedes' principle

408
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,159
and you can look at all the laws of buoyancy

409
00:18:56,159 --> 00:18:57,520
and all of those sort of things

410
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,000
and understand how the displacement of water

411
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,559
and the principles of buoyancy and so on and so forth,

412
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:06,200
the iron axe head is going to sink.

413
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,840
It's just the way it's gonna work.

414
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,559
But Elisha cast in a stick

415
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:16,159
and the Bible says that the iron did swim.

416
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:18,239
Our God is the creator.

417
00:19:19,479 --> 00:19:21,760
He is the creator God.

418
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,840
And there are moments in history that has been recorded,

419
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,039
the miracles of our God,

420
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:31,440
where he has overcome laws and principles

421
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,760
that are in place to show his power.

422
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,719
This is one such instance.

423
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:42,559
When Elisha is there with the sons of the prophets

424
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,559
and they're doing a good work,

425
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:48,400
they're engaged in an honorable work, a necessary work,

426
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,359
there's an unfortunate loss.

427
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:53,359
And he cries out to Elisha and he goes to him

428
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:54,559
and he says, it was borrowed.

429
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,880
And Elisha says, where fell it?

430
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,280
And he cuts the stick, he throws it in

431
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,320
and then the iron.

432
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,120
and notice in verse number seven,

433
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,160
"'Therefore,' said He,

434
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,460
"'take it up to thee.'

435
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:09,620
And He put out His hand and took it."

436
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:12,700
Now, verse number seven is interesting to me

437
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:17,420
because it just seems like it's so nonchalant, right?

438
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,160
It just seems like it's just a,

439
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:23,120
okay, now get it, right?

440
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,460
This is an amazing miracle.

441
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:28,380
The iron did swim.

442
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,860
And this Son of the Prophet,

443
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:35,740
He put His hand and took it.

444
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:38,860
The Bible doesn't tell us anything more

445
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,400
about this event.

446
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,320
Seven verses, that's it.

447
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,200
It doesn't tell us about any conversation

448
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,780
on the way back to where they were.

449
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,580
It doesn't tell us about how they finished the project.

450
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:54,040
It doesn't tell us anything more about this.

451
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,840
In fact, as you go further into chapter number six,

452
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,200
we'll study over the next several weeks,

453
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,040
you'll find how the Syrians are seeking

454
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,660
to have war against Israel.

455
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:05,780
And Elisha keeps telling the people of God

456
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:08,660
all the secrets of the king of Syria.

457
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,780
And he thinks that there's a snitch,

458
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,580
a spy within them, and so on and so forth.

459
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:15,040
And the Scriptures don't tell us anything more

460
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:20,080
about this particular event in history.

461
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,880
But I just believe this evening

462
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:28,940
that this had a great impact upon this individual,

463
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:34,040
and no doubt upon everybody else that was there.

464
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,040
Amen?

465
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:38,380
I mean, the reality is that when this man cries out,

466
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:41,140
Alas, Master, for it was borrowed,

467
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:43,460
Elisha's not the only one that came

468
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,840
and knew what was going on.

469
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,340
There are other people working.

470
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,140
They were all engaged in the same thing.

471
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,640
They're all cutting down beams

472
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,020
so they can build a place to dwell in.

473
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,680
And they know what the problem is.

474
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,440
They know what the situation is.

475
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,940
And then they know the miracle of God

476
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:02,440
and how God allowed that iron to swim

477
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,100
so it could be recovered

478
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,220
and so it could be returned.

479
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,020
And I just wonder sometimes in our lives

480
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:12,220
we think about the impact upon these individuals

481
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,740
and how it would have developed them.

482
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,420
And I wonder in my life

483
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,620
as I look at these seven verses of Scripture,

484
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:21,620
and we say, oh yeah, I know about that passage.

485
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,360
I know that we would be in that moment

486
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,840
and see how God was working

487
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:30,680
and to understand that our God is indeed able

488
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,560
to do anything.

489
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,720
He says to Abraham, is anything too hard for God?

490
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,780
We find that throughout the Scriptures,

491
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:41,480
Jeremiah prays a wonderful prayer.

492
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,800
Oh Lord God, thou hast made the heavens and the earth.

493
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,440
By thy great power,

494
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,360
he declares in the passage of Scripture

495
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,640
that nothing is too hard for the Lord.

496
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,060
We find that in the book of Luke,

497
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:54,620
the Bible says that nothing is impossible

498
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:57,060
with the Lord, with God.

499
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,460
We find that in Ephesians,

500
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,740
the Bible tells us that he's able

501
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,500
to do exceeding abundantly above

502
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,460
all that we ask or think.

503
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,940
Our God is able.

504
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,340
We read a passage like this.

505
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:14,300
Most likely, if I was in a situation

506
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:19,260
and I lost the axe head in the water,

507
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,840
I'd just probably realize it was gone forever.

508
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,160
I'd have to get into the water

509
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,220
and try to find it.

510
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,880
But our God is able to overcome

511
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,200
and able to do anything.

512
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,340
He's God.

513
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,160
He is the Lord God omnipotent.

514
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,920
He's King of kings and Lord of lords,

515
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,760
the great I am.

516
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,980
He spoke it all into existence.

517
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:46,120
This evening, we look at this historical account,

518
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,120
we see the impact of this account.

519
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:50,260
We understand how it still would influence

520
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,140
and impact our lives.

521
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:55,380
But I wonder if we could,

522
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,140
by way of application this evening,

523
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:00,500
continue with the thought that I shared earlier.

524
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,340
What is it that God's trying to teach me?

525
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:05,660
What is it that God's trying to teach you in your life?

526
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:09,200
When we're involved in doing something right,

527
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,300
something honorable,

528
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:14,340
but we deal with some type of an adversity

529
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:18,399
or a setback or a trouble, a problem,

530
00:24:18,399 --> 00:24:21,200
and how do we respond to that?

531
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,779
Because most of us don't really like problems.

532
00:24:24,779 --> 00:24:27,600
Most of us really don't like setbacks and adversities

533
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,640
and troubles and difficulties,

534
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,600
especially if we're doing something good.

535
00:24:35,339 --> 00:24:37,920
But I wonder in those moments,

536
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,480
what is God trying to teach me?

537
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,920
What is God trying to show me

538
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:46,380
about what he is able to do,

539
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:49,420
about how he can be glorified?

540
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,980
Because the work that they were engaged in

541
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,420
was an honorable work.

542
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,980
It was necessary.

543
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:59,500
And it was a good thing that they were doing.

544
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,899
But there was an unfortunate loss.

545
00:25:02,899 --> 00:25:06,260
Could God have prevented that axe head from coming off?

546
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,100
Sure he could.

547
00:25:08,339 --> 00:25:10,860
God could have kept that thing from coming off,

548
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,880
but God allowed it to come off

549
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,380
so that he could make it swim.

550
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,399
Isn't that amazing?

551
00:25:17,399 --> 00:25:19,399
That's the God we serve.

552
00:25:19,399 --> 00:25:21,480
And how it developed that, man.

553
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,960
See, if God would have prevented the axe head

554
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,000
from falling off,

555
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,640
most likely we wouldn't be reading about it tonight,

556
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,320
and most likely it wouldn't have had much of an impact

557
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,960
on the life of that individual.

558
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,600
Because probably when he borrowed the axe head,

559
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,679
he anticipated going back with it.

560
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,119
But because of the unfortunate loss,

561
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:45,960
God steps in,

562
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,040
and God does something that only he could do.

563
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,520
All of this evening,

564
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,440
I trust that we'd allow God to be glorified in our lives,

565
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,880
that we'd understand that at times,

566
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:02,000
God's just working to develop us and to glorify himself.

567
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,839
That we would learn, yes, this historical account

568
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:07,119
and see the impact, but that we in our lives,

569
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:09,559
we would understand God's at work,

570
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:11,260
and he'd do with all things well.

571
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:14,260
His way is perfect.

572
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:16,420
Our God makes no mistakes.

573
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:19,619
This evening, the iron did swim.

574
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:20,460
Let's pray.

575
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,500
Father, we love you.

576
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,700
We thank you for loving us.

577
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,700
Thank you for the opportunity to study thy word.

578
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:29,339
What a blessing to read about this event

579
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:33,059
in the lives of the sons of the prophets in Elisha,

580
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:36,220
and as we consider the text that is before us

581
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,220
and the event that transpired.

582
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:42,200
Lord, how we rejoice in the work that they were engaged in

583
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,520
and how they were willing to roll up their sleeves

584
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,800
and get busy in the work.

585
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,720
Lord, as we read of that loss of the axe head,

586
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,640
we see the concern of the individual,

587
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,880
it was borrowed,

588
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,480
revealing to us their level of poverty.

589
00:27:00,839 --> 00:27:05,600
God, we rejoice in the miracle that was performed

590
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,100
when the iron did swim.

591
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,360
Lord, I pray that you would work in our lives,

592
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,720
that you would help us to keep our eyes upon

593
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,000
the Lord Jesus Christ,

594
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,920
the author and finisher of our faith.

595
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,880
God, you would help us to be mindful

596
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,740
as we go throughout our daily routine

597
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:25,880
that Lord, you're at work in our lives,

598
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,220
that you're seeking to develop us.

599
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:31,440
That Lord, through these events,

600
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,880
that you would be glorified.

601
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:38,220
I pray that you would continue to work in

602
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,660
and through each of our lives.

603
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:43,460
Lord, use us for your honor and for your glory.

604
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,860
We'll thank you for all that you'll do

605
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:47,779
for it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
