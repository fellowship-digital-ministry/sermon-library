WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.199
2 Kings 6, we'll be looking at verses 1-7 this evening

00:00:05.199 --> 00:00:09.399
as we continue our study through the life of Elijah and Elisha.

00:00:09.399 --> 00:00:12.800
Of course, we've been dealing with the life of Elisha for many weeks now

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.399
and we'll continue this evening.

00:00:14.399 --> 00:00:17.600
But in 2 Kings 6, verses 1-7,

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.000
we'll look at this passage of Scripture.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.200
You'll recall with me that the content of 2 Kings 5 is exciting.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.600
You read all of the account there.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.399
We spent three weeks in 2 Kings 5

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:34.400
looking at the interaction between Naaman and the little maid.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.000
And then, of course, Naaman coming to the house of Elisha

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.599
and the healing of Naaman.

00:00:39.599 --> 00:00:41.799
And then, of course, the sin of Gehazi

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:44.200
as we looked at last Wednesday evening.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.599
And what a great passage of Scripture

00:00:46.599 --> 00:00:50.200
that not only some exciting substance

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.799
and seeing what God is able to do and how God is working,

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:58.400
but we find that there are many valuable lessons for each of us today

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.400
even as we study this Old Testament passage of Scripture,

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.799
the account that's been given to us there.

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:08.199
As we continue to trace the steps of the prophet Elisha,

00:01:08.199 --> 00:01:11.199
we find now as we come to 2 Kings 6,

00:01:11.199 --> 00:01:13.400
a record that is given to us

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.599
really about a building project, if you will.

00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:19.199
We find that this building project

00:01:19.199 --> 00:01:22.000
was really led by some of the sons of the prophets.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.599
You'll remember over several of our studies in recent weeks,

00:01:25.599 --> 00:01:28.199
we've made reference to these sons of the prophets.

00:01:28.199 --> 00:01:31.400
And we found that there were many of them in chapter number 2

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.400
as Elisha was accompanying Elijah before his translation.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.800
And as they went from each town,

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.800
we found that there were some that would gather and make statements.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:47.599
And we found that as we've gone through the passages of Scripture

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:49.599
and we came to the end of chapter number 4,

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.400
how that Elisha was there,

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.599
there was a dearth in the land there in Gilgal.

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:58.800
He was teaching, instructing these sons of the prophets.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.199
And we find that there was death in the pot and God worked.

00:02:03.199 --> 00:02:08.199
And through Elisha giving instruction with regard to the meal

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:09.600
and so on and so forth.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.600
And so we've seen some reference to these sons of the prophets.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.399
And we come to chapter number 6

00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:17.000
and we see some interaction that's recorded for us

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.399
between these sons of the prophets and Elisha.

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:22.199
And we see this project that is ongoing.

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:24.399
Notice with me in verse number 1, the Bible says,

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:27.399
And the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha,

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:34.600
Behold now, the place where we dwell with thee is too straight for us.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.000
Let us go, we pray thee, unto Jordan and take thence every man a beam

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.199
and let us make us a place there where we may dwell.

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:45.000
And he answered, Go ye.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.800
One said, Be content, I pray thee, and go with thy servants.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.800
And he answered, I will go.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.199
So he went with them and when they came to Jordan,

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:57.000
they cut down wood.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.199
But as one was felling a beam, the axe head fell into the water

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:06.399
and he cried and said, Alas, master, for it was borrowed.

00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:11.000
The man of God said, Where fell it?

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.399
And he showed him the place and he cut down a stick and cast it in thither.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.800
And the iron did swim.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.199
Therefore said he, Take it up to thee.

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:28.399
And he put out his hand and took it.

00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:31.399
That's an amazing passage of Scripture.

00:03:31.399 --> 00:03:36.199
Again, we look at the miracles of the Bible and if we're not careful,

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:38.800
we can just kind of, oh yeah, I heard that before,

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.000
and just kind of move over.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.199
But this is a wonderful passage of Scripture.

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:46.399
This is an event that happened in the life of Elisha

00:03:46.399 --> 00:03:49.000
and the lives of these sons of the prophets

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.399
that were preparing and being taught.

00:03:51.399 --> 00:03:53.600
And we find that as we look at the passage of Scripture,

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.600
if you're taking notes this evening,

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.000
I've simply entitled the message tonight,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.199
The Iron Did Swim.

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:01.800
We see that at the end of verse number six.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.399
The iron did swim.

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:06.000
2 Kings 6 verses 1 through 7.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.600
Notice with me, as we look at the passage of Scripture,

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.000
number one, an honorable work.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.600
An honorable work.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.399
We find that as we look at this passage of Scripture,

00:04:15.399 --> 00:04:17.000
as we come to verse number one,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.399
and we see the interaction that is recorded for us

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:22.200
between Elisha and these sons of the prophets,

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.600
that these sons of the prophets,

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.799
they take the initiative and they go to Elisha.

00:04:26.799 --> 00:04:30.399
And I want you to notice that they say to Elisha,

00:04:30.399 --> 00:04:36.600
behold now, the place where we dwell with thee is too straight for us.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.000
See, this is an honorable work.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.200
If you're taking notes, we notice, first of all, the honorable work.

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.200
Why would we say that it's an honorable work?

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.200
Well, there was a need.

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.799
There was a need.

00:04:47.799 --> 00:04:49.600
You find that the sons of the prophets,

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.000
they're recognizing that this place is too small for us.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
And as we would understand what's taking place,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
it would seem to indicate to us

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.399
that there's an increase of the prophets that are being instructed,

00:05:02.399 --> 00:05:04.799
and therefore, they need more room.

00:05:04.799 --> 00:05:06.000
They're out of space.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.600
Now, that's a good thing.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.000
And I'm thankful for the initiative that these men take

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
in approaching Elisha,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.399
and they notice that there's a problem,

00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:18.000
but they don't just say, well, here's a problem, Elisha.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Would you deal with it?

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
No, it's an honorable work.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.200
They identify the problem, but then they provide a solution,

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.600
and we find that they seek the permission of Elisha, the man of God.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.200
Notice in verse number two,

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.200
let us go, we pray thee, unto Jordan,

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:40.000
and take thence every man a bean.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.399
And let us make us a place there where we may dwell.

00:05:43.399 --> 00:05:46.600
They sought the permission from Elisha,

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.799
and we find that Elisha granted permission.

00:05:49.799 --> 00:05:52.399
You notice at the end of verse number two, he answered,

00:05:52.399 --> 00:05:54.000
Go ye.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
So they recognized that there was a problem,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
but they said, here's a solution.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.399
We can go and we can get some beans,

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:05.000
and we can make a place for us to dwell.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.600
See, because this place is too small, it's too straight for us.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.399
There's not enough room, and we need more room.

00:06:11.399 --> 00:06:14.000
And so here, Elisha, here's what we're seeking.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Would you grant us permission that we go to Jordan,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.399
and every man takes a bean,

00:06:18.399 --> 00:06:20.799
and there we build a place where we may dwell.

00:06:20.799 --> 00:06:22.399
And Elisha says, go ye.

00:06:22.399 --> 00:06:25.399
We find that they then asked Elisha

00:06:25.399 --> 00:06:28.000
if they would join on this endeavor.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.399
The Bible says in verse number three,

00:06:29.399 --> 00:06:30.799
that one says to Elisha,

00:06:30.799 --> 00:06:34.600
Be content, I pray thee, and go with thy servants.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.399
And he said, I will go.

00:06:37.399 --> 00:06:41.200
Now, in my mind's eye, as I look at this passage of Scripture

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.000
and consider a sanctified imagination,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.200
I see these guys that are gathered together.

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:47.600
They identify the problem.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.200
They provide a solution.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.799
They receive permission.

00:06:50.799 --> 00:06:53.000
And they say, Elisha, we want you to go with us.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.200
Now, in your mind's eye this evening, in your imagination,

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.200
can you see these men leaving from the place where they are,

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.399
going down to Jordan?

00:07:00.399 --> 00:07:02.600
I mean, this is an old-fashioned work day.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.399
Let's go cut down some beans so that we can have the wood,

00:07:05.399 --> 00:07:07.200
so that we can build a place to dwell.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.600
This is an honorable work.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.000
This is a good thing that they're engaged in.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.799
They were not doing something that would be in disobedience

00:07:15.799 --> 00:07:17.799
to what God has commanded.

00:07:17.799 --> 00:07:22.600
They were not in violation of any of God's laws or principles.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.399
They were not violating the authority of Elisha.

00:07:25.399 --> 00:07:29.200
In fact, they sought his permission before they went to go.

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:31.200
This is an honorable work.

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.399
See, they got busy doing the work.

00:07:33.399 --> 00:07:35.600
I believe that the work that we look at here

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:39.000
in 2 Kings chapter number 6, not only is it necessary,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.200
it's honorable.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:43.200
We find that the Bible says, so he's, in verse number 4,

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:45.600
speaking of Elisha, went with them,

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.799
speaking of these sons of the prophets.

00:07:47.799 --> 00:07:51.600
And when they came to Jordan, they cut down wood.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:55.399
Now, I enjoy cutting down wood with a chainsaw, amen?

00:07:55.399 --> 00:07:58.200
And you get a good chainsaw, and you kind of just

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:00.000
can have a good time.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
And I believe that in a certain way,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
it almost helps to relieve some stress.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.399
And I enjoy using an ax every once in a while as well,

00:08:10.399 --> 00:08:14.399
but I will admit that I enjoyed that about 20 years ago

00:08:14.399 --> 00:08:17.200
more than I enjoy that today.

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:18.799
But it's enjoyable.

00:08:18.799 --> 00:08:22.399
Get some work done, and they go.

00:08:22.399 --> 00:08:24.799
And I mean, again, can you see what's happening

00:08:24.799 --> 00:08:26.799
where they recognize the problem,

00:08:26.799 --> 00:08:29.600
and they provide a solution, and they go,

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:34.000
and they're all together in the work.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.599
The sons of the prophets, I don't know how many are there,

00:08:36.599 --> 00:08:39.000
but they're all there, and Elisha's there,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.599
and they're working.

00:08:40.599 --> 00:08:42.000
They're cutting down wood.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.200
It's an honorable work.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.400
There's an unfortunate loss that is given to us

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:49.000
in verse number 5.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
The Bible now turns as we go through the dialogue here

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
as we're reading this record that is provided to us

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.400
of this historical account.

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.799
It now focuses upon an individual

00:09:00.799 --> 00:09:02.400
that was engaged in the work.

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:06.000
There was an individual there who was felling a bean.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.200
He was busy working.

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:10.400
He had that ax, and he's chopping away.

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.000
I mean, he's right there in the work.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000
He's not lazy.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.400
He's not on the sideline.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.400
He's not letting somebody else do the work.

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.200
No, he's engaged in this honorable work.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.799
He's not a spectator.

00:09:20.799 --> 00:09:22.000
He's a participator.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.400
He's in, and he's cutting down a tree.

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:27.000
And the Bible says in verse number 5,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.200
but as one was felling a bean,

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:35.599
the ax head fell into the water.

00:09:35.599 --> 00:09:37.799
We find that the Bible tells us

00:09:37.799 --> 00:09:39.599
of this unfortunate loss

00:09:39.599 --> 00:09:42.599
that this ax head is now in the water,

00:09:42.599 --> 00:09:45.799
and we know that an iron ax head

00:09:45.799 --> 00:09:47.400
will do what in water?

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:50.000
It sinks.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
It sinks.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.400
We find that as we look at this passage of Scripture

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:59.000
and we find that which is taking place for us,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000
and we...

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.960
look at what's going on, we find that the principles of physics

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.519
would teach us that that axe head is

00:10:06.519 --> 00:10:10.800
going to sink in the water.

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:15.239
And those principles of physics, the laws of physics,

00:10:15.239 --> 00:10:18.559
if you will, they are, in fact, carried out.

00:10:18.559 --> 00:10:21.239
And we find that this man cries.

00:10:21.239 --> 00:10:24.840
And notice, he says, alas, master.

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:25.760
Who's he speaking to?

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:27.479
He's speaking to Elisha.

00:10:27.479 --> 00:10:29.840
I bet you some, I don't know if this is the same fellow

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:31.559
that invited Elisha to come, but I'm

00:10:31.559 --> 00:10:34.880
sure thinking that he's happy that Elisha's there.

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:36.680
Amen, it'd be kind of interesting

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:39.319
if it was the same fellow that invited Elisha.

00:10:39.319 --> 00:10:41.880
Because the Bible says that in verse number three,

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:47.439
and one said, be content, I pray thee, and go with thy servants.

00:10:47.439 --> 00:10:49.520
And he answered, I will go.

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:52.080
I'm not telling you this evening that it's the same person,

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:55.599
but I'm just saying it'd be interesting if it was.

00:10:55.599 --> 00:10:57.599
But even if it wasn't the same person,

00:10:57.599 --> 00:10:59.840
I believe that the fellow that's cutting down the tree

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:02.959
is quite happy that Elisha's there.

00:11:02.959 --> 00:11:07.720
When he cries out to Elisha, I want you to notice what he says.

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:14.199
He says, alas, master, for it was borrowed.

00:11:14.199 --> 00:11:15.319
What's he speaking about?

00:11:15.319 --> 00:11:18.440
He's speaking about this axe head that now is

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:20.239
missing this unfortunate loss.

00:11:20.239 --> 00:11:22.559
We would find that it's this unnamed man that

00:11:22.559 --> 00:11:25.639
is given to us here as he's called out

00:11:25.639 --> 00:11:27.319
to Elisha for assistance.

00:11:27.319 --> 00:11:31.319
He reveals to Elisha the situation not only

00:11:31.319 --> 00:11:36.440
of the loss, but the fact that this axe head was borrowed.

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:39.160
Really, I believe that it reveals to us

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:42.080
the poverty of these individuals.

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:45.000
The fact that they were going to engage in a work,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.559
and they were understanding that this was a necessary work.

00:11:48.559 --> 00:11:50.239
It was an honorable work.

00:11:50.239 --> 00:11:54.160
And they were going to expand their place of residence.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.639
And it was a project that they were engaged in.

00:11:56.639 --> 00:11:58.279
And they were involved together.

00:11:58.279 --> 00:11:59.480
And Elisha was there.

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:01.199
And the sons of the prophets were there.

00:12:01.199 --> 00:12:02.279
But they were poor.

00:12:02.279 --> 00:12:05.000
And they had to borrow an axe.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.679
And now that which is borrowed is missing.

00:12:08.679 --> 00:12:09.720
It's unfortunate.

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:13.160
If he didn't have money to buy his own axe,

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.240
surely he'd have a hard time getting money

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:17.320
to replace the axe that's now been lost.

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.119
I want you to think about this just for a moment.

00:12:22.119 --> 00:12:25.080
Sometimes we look at these types of situations,

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:28.520
and we say something like this.

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:32.080
Why do bad things happen to good people?

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:34.199
You ever heard somebody say that?

00:12:34.199 --> 00:12:35.679
Maybe we'd ask the question.

00:12:35.679 --> 00:12:38.399
Sometimes people say, I was doing something good,

00:12:38.399 --> 00:12:41.119
and this bad thing happened.

00:12:41.119 --> 00:12:43.160
Yeah, it happens.

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:47.279
The work that these men were engaged in was a good work.

00:12:47.279 --> 00:12:49.720
They were not doing anything in violation

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:52.000
to any of God's laws or principles.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.800
They had the blessing of their master.

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:58.839
The man of God, the prophet Elisha, he said, go ye.

00:12:58.839 --> 00:13:01.360
In fact, he went with them.

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.559
And they're engaged in the work.

00:13:03.559 --> 00:13:06.080
But yet, the axe head is lost.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:08.600
The axe head is lost.

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:12.639
And as we think about the context of what's going on,

00:13:12.639 --> 00:13:16.679
and we think about the situation for this man, for some of us

00:13:16.679 --> 00:13:18.440
today, we might say, what's the big deal?

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:18.919
An axe head.

00:13:18.919 --> 00:13:19.800
Just go buy a new one.

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:21.000
Just go replace it.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.759
It was borrowed.

00:13:22.759 --> 00:13:25.399
He didn't have the resources.

00:13:25.399 --> 00:13:27.160
Some of us might have the resources.

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:27.839
Yeah, I broke it.

00:13:27.839 --> 00:13:28.839
I'll just go replace it.

00:13:28.839 --> 00:13:29.339
It's fine.

00:13:29.339 --> 00:13:30.320
No big deal.

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:32.800
And we don't even think twice about it.

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:35.679
But for this man, in this circumstance,

00:13:35.679 --> 00:13:38.479
this was a major situation.

00:13:38.479 --> 00:13:41.000
It was a real problem at hand.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.800
And we find that as this situation is unfolding,

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:49.240
we would understand this evening that there

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:53.160
are times in which we can be engaged in a good thing,

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.720
and something unfortunate happens.

00:13:55.720 --> 00:14:00.160
Something that we could look at and say, why did that happen?

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:01.479
I was doing right.

00:14:01.479 --> 00:14:03.600
I was doing good.

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.839
Can I tell you that sometimes, even

00:14:05.839 --> 00:14:08.000
in the midst of doing a good thing,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.119
we might have something that appears

00:14:10.119 --> 00:14:13.559
to be at surface level unfortunate,

00:14:13.559 --> 00:14:16.920
but God is going to show himself mighty.

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:19.920
God's always at work in our lives.

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:21.079
I believe that.

00:14:21.079 --> 00:14:23.559
I believe that God's always at work in your life.

00:14:23.559 --> 00:14:27.200
He's always seeking to develop his people.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:31.160
He's always seeking to receive glory unto himself.

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:34.679
And he works in and through circumstances and situations

00:14:34.679 --> 00:14:36.799
in life so that we would be developed,

00:14:36.799 --> 00:14:38.880
so that he would be glorified.

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:42.239
And here, I believe that though these individuals were

00:14:42.239 --> 00:14:45.799
engaged in honorable work, yes, there's an unfortunate loss.

00:14:45.799 --> 00:14:48.160
But oh, God's going to work.

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:50.920
And God's going to work in such a way

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:53.559
that something miraculous is going to happen.

00:14:53.559 --> 00:14:56.839
And we find that these individuals no doubt

00:14:56.839 --> 00:14:58.760
would have had their faith increased.

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:01.880
But even now, thousands of years later,

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:04.880
we have the opportunity to read of this account that

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:06.679
took place in this man's life.

00:15:06.679 --> 00:15:09.600
And we can say, man, look at how God worked.

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:13.079
Look at when it increases my faith.

00:15:13.079 --> 00:15:17.000
It helps me to understand what my God is able to do.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.079
We find that there's an honorable work in which they're

00:15:20.079 --> 00:15:21.119
engaged in.

00:15:21.119 --> 00:15:23.320
We find that there's an unfortunate loss.

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:26.079
And notice with me, as we look at the remainder

00:15:26.079 --> 00:15:28.640
of the text of Scripture in verses 6 and 7,

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:31.200
there is a miraculous recovery.

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.040
A miraculous recovery.

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:36.239
We notice in verse number 6 that the man of God said,

00:15:36.239 --> 00:15:37.799
where fell it?

00:15:37.799 --> 00:15:38.799
Where fell it?

00:15:41.519 --> 00:15:44.399
As I study the life of Elisha, as you've

00:15:44.399 --> 00:15:46.799
joined me over these last many weeks,

00:15:46.799 --> 00:15:51.839
and really this is our 26th lesson on Elijah and Elisha.

00:15:51.839 --> 00:15:53.799
So we've been at this for a while.

00:15:53.799 --> 00:15:58.559
And it's amazing to me how so many times, specifically

00:15:58.559 --> 00:16:02.760
in the life of Elisha, he asks very simple questions.

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:07.320
He gives very simple instruction.

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:09.399
Where fell it?

00:16:09.399 --> 00:16:11.160
Can you imagine?

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:14.600
I believe that Elisha has a calm demeanor.

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:18.160
I mean, just in my sanctified imagination, I see this fella.

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:19.880
He's kind of beside himself.

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:23.440
Alas, master, it was borrowed, right?

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:25.399
I mean, he's kind of.

00:16:25.399 --> 00:16:28.000
And Elisha just calmly in his calm demeanor

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.239
comes over and says, where fell it?

00:16:32.239 --> 00:16:34.679
Where fell it?

00:16:34.679 --> 00:16:36.799
And he showed him the place.

00:16:36.799 --> 00:16:39.200
Can you see it in your mind's eye?

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:42.000
Can you see it unfolding at the river?

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.040
I mean, I just have this picture in my mind of the anxiety,

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:49.239
the anxiousness of this individual

00:16:49.239 --> 00:16:52.359
as he's concerned about this lost ax head.

00:16:52.359 --> 00:16:54.600
And Elisha says, where fell it?

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:55.839
And he shows him the place.

00:16:55.839 --> 00:16:57.839
Elisha is right over here.

00:16:57.839 --> 00:16:59.160
And he shows him the place.

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:03.040
And Elisha, the Bible tells us in verse number six,

00:17:03.079 --> 00:17:07.519
it says that he cut down a stick and cast it in thither.

00:17:07.519 --> 00:17:08.640
Now, just hold on right there.

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:10.559
I know the verse doesn't end there.

00:17:10.559 --> 00:17:14.040
But put yourself in the position of the man

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:15.760
that had the lost ax.

00:17:17.079 --> 00:17:22.079
He cuts down, the Bible says, a stick and cast it in thither.

00:17:22.119 --> 00:17:26.519
Can I ask you, what is that gonna do, right?

00:17:26.519 --> 00:17:27.839
Maybe you'd ask the question.

00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:29.119
That's probably what I would ask.

00:17:29.119 --> 00:17:31.119
And I'm just being transparent with you this evening.

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:33.320
Just like in chapter number four,

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:36.040
when there was death in the pot, remember?

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:38.480
And Elisha said, get some meal.

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:40.440
And he said, cast it in.

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:44.040
And we find that they brought the meal, flour.

00:17:45.119 --> 00:17:47.480
There was death in the pot.

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:49.079
And the Bible says, when they brought the meal,

00:17:49.079 --> 00:17:50.040
that he put it in.

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:52.920
And then he says, eat.

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:54.079
And they ate.

00:17:55.279 --> 00:17:57.079
And it was good.

00:17:57.079 --> 00:17:58.920
Sustenance satisfied them.

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:01.079
God healed it.

00:18:01.959 --> 00:18:05.880
And now we find that Elisha cuts down a stick

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:07.959
and he cast it in thither,

00:18:07.959 --> 00:18:10.839
in the place where the man showed him.

00:18:10.839 --> 00:18:12.720
Here's where it fell.

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:15.880
Because that's the question that Elisha asked.

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:17.679
Where fell it?

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.399
And he cuts down the stick

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:24.399
and he cast it in that same place.

00:18:24.399 --> 00:18:28.279
And the Bible says, the iron did swim.

00:18:29.839 --> 00:18:30.920
That's amazing.

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:36.760
The principles of physics,

00:18:37.239 --> 00:18:41.520
the law of physics was overcome in this moment.

00:18:43.679 --> 00:18:44.960
Iron doesn't swim.

00:18:46.479 --> 00:18:47.320
Amen?

00:18:48.239 --> 00:18:52.479
You can look, and I don't wanna get all into it this evening

00:18:52.479 --> 00:18:54.320
but you can look at Archimedes' principle

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:56.159
and you can look at all the laws of buoyancy

00:18:56.159 --> 00:18:57.520
and all of those sort of things

00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:01.000
and understand how the displacement of water

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:03.559
and the principles of buoyancy and so on and so forth,

00:19:03.559 --> 00:19:06.200
the iron axe head is going to sink.

00:19:07.479 --> 00:19:09.840
It's just the way it's gonna work.

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:11.559
But Elisha cast in a stick

00:19:11.559 --> 00:19:16.159
and the Bible says that the iron did swim.

00:19:16.159 --> 00:19:18.239
Our God is the creator.

00:19:19.479 --> 00:19:21.760
He is the creator God.

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:25.840
And there are moments in history that has been recorded,

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:28.039
the miracles of our God,

00:19:28.039 --> 00:19:31.440
where he has overcome laws and principles

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:34.760
that are in place to show his power.

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:36.719
This is one such instance.

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:42.559
When Elisha is there with the sons of the prophets

00:19:42.559 --> 00:19:44.559
and they're doing a good work,

00:19:44.559 --> 00:19:48.400
they're engaged in an honorable work, a necessary work,

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:50.359
there's an unfortunate loss.

00:19:50.359 --> 00:19:53.359
And he cries out to Elisha and he goes to him

00:19:53.359 --> 00:19:54.559
and he says, it was borrowed.

00:19:54.559 --> 00:19:56.880
And Elisha says, where fell it?

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:59.280
And he cuts the stick, he throws it in

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:00.320
and then the iron.

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:02.120
and notice in verse number seven,

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:04.160
"'Therefore,' said He,

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:06.460
"'take it up to thee.'

00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:09.620
And He put out His hand and took it."

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:12.700
Now, verse number seven is interesting to me

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:17.420
because it just seems like it's so nonchalant, right?

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:19.160
It just seems like it's just a,

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:23.120
okay, now get it, right?

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:25.460
This is an amazing miracle.

00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:28.380
The iron did swim.

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:31.860
And this Son of the Prophet,

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:35.740
He put His hand and took it.

00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:38.860
The Bible doesn't tell us anything more

00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:40.400
about this event.

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:43.320
Seven verses, that's it.

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:45.200
It doesn't tell us about any conversation

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:48.780
on the way back to where they were.

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:51.580
It doesn't tell us about how they finished the project.

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:54.040
It doesn't tell us anything more about this.

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:56.840
In fact, as you go further into chapter number six,

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:58.200
we'll study over the next several weeks,

00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:01.040
you'll find how the Syrians are seeking

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:02.660
to have war against Israel.

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:05.780
And Elisha keeps telling the people of God

00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:08.660
all the secrets of the king of Syria.

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:10.780
And he thinks that there's a snitch,

00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:12.580
a spy within them, and so on and so forth.

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:15.040
And the Scriptures don't tell us anything more

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:20.080
about this particular event in history.

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:23.880
But I just believe this evening

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:28.940
that this had a great impact upon this individual,

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:34.040
and no doubt upon everybody else that was there.

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:35.040
Amen?

00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:38.380
I mean, the reality is that when this man cries out,

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:41.140
Alas, Master, for it was borrowed,

00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:43.460
Elisha's not the only one that came

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:44.840
and knew what was going on.

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:46.340
There are other people working.

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:48.140
They were all engaged in the same thing.

00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:49.640
They're all cutting down beams

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:52.020
so they can build a place to dwell in.

00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:53.680
And they know what the problem is.

00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:55.440
They know what the situation is.

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:58.940
And then they know the miracle of God

00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:02.440
and how God allowed that iron to swim

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:04.100
so it could be recovered

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:06.220
and so it could be returned.

00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:08.020
And I just wonder sometimes in our lives

00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:12.220
we think about the impact upon these individuals

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:14.740
and how it would have developed them.

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:16.420
And I wonder in my life

00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:18.620
as I look at these seven verses of Scripture,

00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:21.620
and we say, oh yeah, I know about that passage.

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:24.360
I know that we would be in that moment

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:26.840
and see how God was working

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:30.680
and to understand that our God is indeed able

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:32.560
to do anything.

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:36.720
He says to Abraham, is anything too hard for God?

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:38.780
We find that throughout the Scriptures,

00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:41.480
Jeremiah prays a wonderful prayer.

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:44.800
Oh Lord God, thou hast made the heavens and the earth.

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:46.440
By thy great power,

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:48.360
he declares in the passage of Scripture

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:50.640
that nothing is too hard for the Lord.

00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:52.060
We find that in the book of Luke,

00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:54.620
the Bible says that nothing is impossible

00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:57.060
with the Lord, with God.

00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:58.460
We find that in Ephesians,

00:22:58.460 --> 00:22:59.740
the Bible tells us that he's able

00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:01.500
to do exceeding abundantly above

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:03.460
all that we ask or think.

00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:04.940
Our God is able.

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:08.340
We read a passage like this.

00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:14.300
Most likely, if I was in a situation

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:19.260
and I lost the axe head in the water,

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:21.840
I'd just probably realize it was gone forever.

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:23.160
I'd have to get into the water

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:24.220
and try to find it.

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:28.880
But our God is able to overcome

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:32.200
and able to do anything.

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:33.340
He's God.

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:36.160
He is the Lord God omnipotent.

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:38.920
He's King of kings and Lord of lords,

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:39.760
the great I am.

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:42.980
He spoke it all into existence.

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:46.120
This evening, we look at this historical account,

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:48.120
we see the impact of this account.

00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:50.260
We understand how it still would influence

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:52.140
and impact our lives.

00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:55.380
But I wonder if we could,

00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:57.140
by way of application this evening,

00:23:57.140 --> 00:24:00.500
continue with the thought that I shared earlier.

00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:02.340
What is it that God's trying to teach me?

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:05.660
What is it that God's trying to teach you in your life?

00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:09.200
When we're involved in doing something right,

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:11.300
something honorable,

00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:14.340
but we deal with some type of an adversity

00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:18.399
or a setback or a trouble, a problem,

00:24:18.399 --> 00:24:21.200
and how do we respond to that?

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:24.779
Because most of us don't really like problems.

00:24:24.779 --> 00:24:27.600
Most of us really don't like setbacks and adversities

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:29.640
and troubles and difficulties,

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:32.600
especially if we're doing something good.

00:24:35.339 --> 00:24:37.920
But I wonder in those moments,

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:39.480
what is God trying to teach me?

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:42.920
What is God trying to show me

00:24:43.899 --> 00:24:46.380
about what he is able to do,

00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:49.420
about how he can be glorified?

00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:52.980
Because the work that they were engaged in

00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:54.420
was an honorable work.

00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:56.980
It was necessary.

00:24:56.980 --> 00:24:59.500
And it was a good thing that they were doing.

00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:02.899
But there was an unfortunate loss.

00:25:02.899 --> 00:25:06.260
Could God have prevented that axe head from coming off?

00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:07.100
Sure he could.

00:25:08.339 --> 00:25:10.860
God could have kept that thing from coming off,

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:13.880
but God allowed it to come off

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:15.380
so that he could make it swim.

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:17.399
Isn't that amazing?

00:25:17.399 --> 00:25:19.399
That's the God we serve.

00:25:19.399 --> 00:25:21.480
And how it developed that, man.

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:23.960
See, if God would have prevented the axe head

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:26.000
from falling off,

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.640
most likely we wouldn't be reading about it tonight,

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:32.320
and most likely it wouldn't have had much of an impact

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:33.960
on the life of that individual.

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:37.600
Because probably when he borrowed the axe head,

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:39.679
he anticipated going back with it.

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:44.119
But because of the unfortunate loss,

00:25:44.119 --> 00:25:45.960
God steps in,

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:49.040
and God does something that only he could do.

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:51.520
All of this evening,

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:55.440
I trust that we'd allow God to be glorified in our lives,

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:57.880
that we'd understand that at times,

00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:02.000
God's just working to develop us and to glorify himself.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.839
That we would learn, yes, this historical account

00:26:04.839 --> 00:26:07.119
and see the impact, but that we in our lives,

00:26:07.119 --> 00:26:09.559
we would understand God's at work,

00:26:09.559 --> 00:26:11.260
and he'd do with all things well.

00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:14.260
His way is perfect.

00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:16.420
Our God makes no mistakes.

00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:19.619
This evening, the iron did swim.

00:26:19.619 --> 00:26:20.460
Let's pray.

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:21.500
Father, we love you.

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:22.700
We thank you for loving us.

00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:25.700
Thank you for the opportunity to study thy word.

00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:29.339
What a blessing to read about this event

00:26:29.339 --> 00:26:33.059
in the lives of the sons of the prophets in Elisha,

00:26:33.059 --> 00:26:36.220
and as we consider the text that is before us

00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:38.220
and the event that transpired.

00:26:38.279 --> 00:26:42.200
Lord, how we rejoice in the work that they were engaged in

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:44.520
and how they were willing to roll up their sleeves

00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:46.800
and get busy in the work.

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:52.720
Lord, as we read of that loss of the axe head,

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:55.640
we see the concern of the individual,

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:56.880
it was borrowed,

00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:59.480
revealing to us their level of poverty.

00:27:00.839 --> 00:27:05.600
God, we rejoice in the miracle that was performed

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:07.100
when the iron did swim.

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:10.360
Lord, I pray that you would work in our lives,

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:12.720
that you would help us to keep our eyes upon

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:15.000
the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.920
the author and finisher of our faith.

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:20.880
God, you would help us to be mindful

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:22.740
as we go throughout our daily routine

00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:25.880
that Lord, you're at work in our lives,

00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:28.220
that you're seeking to develop us.

00:27:29.839 --> 00:27:31.440
That Lord, through these events,

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:33.880
that you would be glorified.

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:38.220
I pray that you would continue to work in

00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:39.660
and through each of our lives.

00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:43.460
Lord, use us for your honor and for your glory.

00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:44.860
We'll thank you for all that you'll do

00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:47.779
for it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
