WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.980
We'll be looking at verses 26 down through verse number 40 and brother Jim if you could mute that projector for me

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:07.920
I'd appreciate it

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.880
I'm about to pull my notes up on my iPad and you guys don't need to see on my chicken scratch

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.399
amen, and you'll say what in the world is wrong with that guy and

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.200
I

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.500
Can read it amen Acts chapter number 8 and I'll be looking at this passage of Scripture

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.680
I'm not gonna read all of it in the by way of introduction

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.399
I want to draw your attention to verse number 36

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.439
Go through a quick introduction and then get into the passage this evening

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:36.119
Acts chapter number 8 will be looking at verses 26 through 40

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:40.680
but in verse number 36 notice what the Bible says and as they and they is

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.759
Philip in the Ethiopian eunuch. All right, I'll get into all of that as we go through way of introduction

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:47.680
But so that you understand who it is

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.560
Contextually, it's being speaking spoken of as they're traveling it says and as they went on their way

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.720
They came unto a certain water and the eunuch said see

00:00:59.439 --> 00:01:01.279
Here is water

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:07.879
What doth hinder me to be baptized and I preach a message this evening that I've simply

00:01:08.199 --> 00:01:15.800
Entitled from verse number 36 of our passage of Scripture. What doth hinder me to be baptized this evening?

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.319
As you know, I mentioned this morning

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:23.680
We'll have three follow the Lord and believers baptism at the close of the service and that's a tremendous blessing. I rejoice

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:31.239
each time that someone trusts the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal Savior and then as they make that decision to follow the Lord and

00:01:31.239 --> 00:01:36.080
Believers baptism it gives us reason to rejoice. Amen. And so that's an exciting thing

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.239
But as we look at the passage of Scripture this evening

00:01:39.239 --> 00:01:45.160
We'll note that at the very beginning of chapter number eight really what you see happening is the persecution of the church

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.239
Intensifies we find that Saul is not yet converted

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:54.160
We read of the conversion of Saul in Acts chapter number nine and you find that there in the beginning of the eighth chapter

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:59.839
of course, Stephen is martyred in chapter number seven and you come to Acts chapter number eight and the

00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:02.519
persecution against the local church

00:02:03.199 --> 00:02:04.559
intensifies

00:02:04.559 --> 00:02:12.000
Exponentially and we find that as the persecution would intensify that the Bible tells us that the believers were scattered

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:18.559
Abroad now really God was using this to fulfill his purpose. You remember in Acts chapter number one

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.160
He said that you shall receive power

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.240
After that, the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem Judea

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:31.720
Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth and we find that is the Lord

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:38.639
Jesus Christ had given the Great Commission going into all the world and preached the gospel to every creature as it's recorded in Acts 1

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:45.639
He named the geographical locations that they were to go to as you study the book of Acts you find that there's great work

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:47.559
That is taking place in Jerusalem

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:52.179
But they yet had not gone and taken the gospel as they had been

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:59.800
instructed and so we see that the persecution led to the scattering which really led to the propagating of the gospel to the

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:07.160
furtherance of the gospel and we find that Philip according to verse number five he went down to the city of

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:15.039
Samaria now the Bible tells us that they that went with that were scattered abroad went everywhere preaching the word

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:20.119
one Bible commentary actually a Bible a preacher of yesteryear

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:22.399
He made the statement that they sought to

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:28.520
stamp out the fire in Jerusalem and they spread the embers across the world and

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:33.199
What a great description of what happened here in Acts chapter number eight

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:39.440
We find that Philip really the passage of scripture chase traces the steps of Philip he finds himself in Samaria

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:43.919
He's preaching Christ unto those that are there in Samaria

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:48.440
And we find that the Bible tells us that there was great joy in that

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:54.820
City people are being saved the preaching of the Word of God is going forth and we find there's a great work

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.720
That is taking place in Samaria and in the midst of that great work the Lord

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:03.759
Separates Philip to go deal with an individual that

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:08.240
Individual is this eunuch from Ethiopia that we read of this evening

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.119
Look at verse number 26 as we begin this evening

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:16.200
And really what I want to do as we go through the passage of scripture is first

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.720
I want to note the questions

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:24.119
there are four questions that we find within the text and we'll look at those questions and dig in and then we'll find how the

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:30.679
Scriptures in this passage provide us with instruction regarding baptism in verse number 26

00:04:30.679 --> 00:04:32.679
The Bible says in the angel of the Lord

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.959
Spoken to Philip saying arise and go

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.600
Toward the south under the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza

00:04:41.079 --> 00:04:45.200
Which is desert now remember as I've mentioned very quickly

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:51.040
That they were in the midst of really a great revival meeting in Samaria. I mean God was working

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.920
There was great joy in the city. He's preaching Christ people are being saved

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:01.359
What a great opportunity to serve God in that capacity, but we find that God

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:08.040
Had instructed that Philip go and he gives them direction specific direction as to where to go

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.359
Notice that the Bible tells us in verse number 27 and he arose and went

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.839
Isn't that good to just see the obedience of God's servant to just see how that the Spirit of God

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:28.079
Gave direction to the servant of God to Philip and Philip simply responded in obedience

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:35.040
And it was immediate obedience and it's a joy to see because the reality is there was a great opportunity

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.040
Awaiting him and we read of this wonderful

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:44.160
Encounter between Philip and the Ethiopian eunuch and as we read of the encounter

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:51.000
We must understand that if it had not been for the prompting of the Holy Spirit of God and the obedience of Philip

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.239
This opportunity may never have happened. We find that here the Bible begins as we look at what's happening

00:05:57.239 --> 00:06:03.679
it tells us that behold a man of Ethiopia and eunuch of great authority under Candace Queen of the

00:06:03.959 --> 00:06:10.399
Ethiopians who had the charge of all her treasure and had come to Jerusalem for to worship

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:18.679
Notice verse 28. The Bible says that this man this eunuch he was returning and sitting in his chariot read

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:25.359
Isaiah the prophet the book of Isaiah is a powerful book the book of Isaiah contains much

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:30.640
Messianic prophecy the book of Isaiah as we'll find as we read through the passage this evening

00:06:30.839 --> 00:06:37.420
That they're reading in the 53rd chapter of the book of Isaiah and what a great chapter that is

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:42.720
And we find here that as this one is sitting there reading the book of Isaiah

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:49.239
That the Spirit then says to Philip in verse number 29 go near and join

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.320
Thyself to this chariot again

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:59.440
We see the direction and the instruction of the Lord and we see the obedience of God's servant here in Acts 8 in verse number

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:04.720
30 the Bible says in Philip ran fither to him. I like the expression

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:10.119
He did not delay. He did not question. He did not sit there. You know, sometimes we can

00:07:10.959 --> 00:07:15.720
Is it really something I should do we kind of get into this is the Spirit of God really?

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:20.559
Prompting me to do this and so on and so forth and we can perhaps miss an opportunity

00:07:20.559 --> 00:07:25.260
But the Bible tells us that Philip ran fither to him

00:07:25.859 --> 00:07:27.859
Notice

00:07:27.899 --> 00:07:30.619
He heard him read the prophet Isaiah now

00:07:30.619 --> 00:07:36.619
Can you imagine as you would be obedient to the Spirit of God and Philip arises up?

00:07:36.619 --> 00:07:38.059
He leaves Samaria

00:07:38.059 --> 00:07:44.179
He goes to the place where the Lord had instructed them to go and then he sees this chariot and the Spirit of God says yes

00:07:44.179 --> 00:07:48.500
Go to that chariot join him and as he's going to that place. He's reading

00:07:48.899 --> 00:07:52.779
He hears the man reading from the book of Isaiah

00:07:53.779 --> 00:07:55.779
Question number one is

00:07:56.220 --> 00:08:02.220
Given to us here in verse number 30, and it's a question that Philip asks the eunuch

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:04.660
Notice the latter part of verse number 30

00:08:06.179 --> 00:08:11.679
Understandest thou what thou readest that's an appropriate question, is it not?

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:21.980
You're reading this portion of Scripture, but the question is do you understand what you're reading

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.100
understandest thou

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:26.700
what thou

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:28.700
readest I

00:08:28.739 --> 00:08:30.220
understand that as

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:34.739
Philip would join himself to the chariot and as he would climb up into

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:37.179
That chariot and that eunuch is there

00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:43.419
Can you imagine being the eunuch and this guy just jumps up in the chariot with you and and immediately the man says hey

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:45.419
Do you understand what you're reading?

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:49.760
Understand this now what thou readest and notice the question

00:08:50.239 --> 00:08:53.280
That is given in response to the question now

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:57.320
Typically you answer a question with a statement not with a question

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:03.960
But really we see that the eunuch forms it as a question in verse number 31 and really it's question

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:08.760
Number two in our text of Scripture. He the eunuch said to Philip. How

00:09:09.479 --> 00:09:11.479
can I

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:13.520
Accept some man

00:09:13.719 --> 00:09:15.719
Should guide me

00:09:15.919 --> 00:09:17.919
That's a great question, isn't it?

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:20.520
How can I

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:22.280
Accept some man

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:23.919
Should guide me

00:09:23.919 --> 00:09:25.919
You know, it's good to

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.559
distribute Bibles

00:09:27.559 --> 00:09:31.799
It's good to distribute the Word of God to distribute gospel tracts

00:09:32.479 --> 00:09:40.400
but the reality is that as we would look at this truth from Acts chapter number 8 and we would consider the fact that we

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:41.520
can distribute

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:48.400
The the Word of God that the question would be that even if they read it do they understand what they read?

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.400
And the eunuch says how can I?

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:56.679
Accept some man should guide me. In fact as we go through the passage of Scripture

00:09:56.679 --> 00:10:00.200
We'll come to the third question here in just a few verses. We understand

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:04.780
the portion in which he's reading, but we understand that there's a measure of

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:09.300
confusion on his part as he's reading it. We understand as we have the whole

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:13.460
canon of Scripture that the Bible teaches us. Paul says to the believers

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:17.180
in Corinth that the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:22.160
of God for their foolishness unto him neither can he know them. Why? Because

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:27.220
they are spiritually discerned. 1st Corinthians 2 and verse 14. And so we

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:31.660
find here in the passage of Scripture that this man, Philip, who had been

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:35.620
ministering in Samaria, he comes alongside this individual and this

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:41.740
individual is reading from the book of Isaiah. And he greets him by saying, do

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:48.300
you understand what you're reading? The eunuch says, how can I except some man

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:53.460
should guide me? I believe this evening that every child of God ought to be

00:10:53.460 --> 00:11:00.580
challenged by the response of this eunuch. There are people that perhaps God

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:06.940
would allow you to cross paths with that need some guidance into understanding

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:14.140
the truth of the Word of God. Amen? And God can use us. Oh, aren't you thankful as

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:19.740
we read the passage of Scripture that Philip was ready to give an answer? If

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:23.060
Philip says, hey man, I think we should have a roundtable discussion on this. I'm

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:25.500
not really sure what it talks about either. I don't know. What are your

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:28.980
thoughts? What are your thoughts? No, no. Philip is able to go in and give him

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:34.460
truth. He was equipped. He was prepared. I think of Ezra the scribe who the Bible

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:39.460
says that he had prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord in Israel. And

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:44.300
not only to seek but to do it and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:48.260
and how important it is even as we find Peter that says that we ought to be

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:54.140
always to give an answer of the hope that lieth within us. And we find here

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:58.500
that this man, Philip, he joins this eunuch in the chariot and he says, do you

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:03.140
understand? And he says, how can I except some man should guide me? Notice in verse

00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:08.260
32. We'll read the rest of verse 31. It says, and he desired Philip that he would

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:13.500
come up and sit with him. What a great opportunity. Amen? In verse 32, the place

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:18.620
of the scripture which he read was this. He was led as a sheep to the slaughter

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:24.940
and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth. In his

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:31.700
humiliation, his judgment was taken away. And who shall declare his generation? For

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:40.340
his life is taken from the earth. Isaiah 53 verses 7 and 8, the portion of Isaiah

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:44.340
in which the eunuch was reading. And the Bible tells us and records for us

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:48.900
question number three in verse 34. And the eunuch answered Philip and said, I

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:58.980
pray thee, notice of whom speaketh the prophet this? Of himself or of some other

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:06.580
man? It's a good question. What do we find? That as the eunuch is reading this

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:11.500
portion of scripture in Isaiah 53, he says, I'm not sure. I can't discern. I

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:17.900
don't understand who is being spoken of in these verses of scripture. And he

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:26.940
asked the question, he says, of whom speaketh the prophet this? Of himself or

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:31.700
of some other man? Well, I'm so glad that you asked. Can you see Philip? I mean,

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:36.980
just rejoicing at the opportunity that is before him. For we find that in verse

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:44.740
number 35, the Bible says, then Philip opened his mouth and began at the same

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:53.340
scripture and preached unto him Jesus. Isn't that precious? Began at the same

00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:59.460
scripture. He used the Old Testament. Amen? Isaiah is in the Old Testament. Praise

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:05.940
God. He used the Old Testament and he used those prophecies, those messianic

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:11.900
prophecies that are recorded even there in that portion of Isaiah 53, and he

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:18.140
preached unto him Jesus. Now, the Bible doesn't record the whole message that

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:25.860
Philip preached. I'd love to know exactly how he articulated what it was that he

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:30.300
said, but God has chosen that it was not necessary for us to receive the

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:34.580
entirety of the message. In fact, as you read the scriptures, you read the gospel

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:38.700
accounts, there are some occasions in which the teachings of Jesus are

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:43.900
provided in great detail. There are other times in which the scriptures simply say

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:49.220
that Jesus taught the multitudes. There are times even here in the book of Acts

00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:56.380
that you read lengthy sermons from Peter, from Stephen, from Paul, and there

00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:59.980
are other times that you just read something like this of Philip, that he

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:05.980
preached unto him Jesus. Can I tell you that that's what our duty is, to preach

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:13.779
Jesus. Amen? To lift him up, to preach Christ, to exalt our Savior. He's a

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:19.940
wonderful Savior, and we find here that Philip is going to begin at that same

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:25.660
scripture, and he's going to show this eunuch how that Jesus was the promised

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:33.380
Messiah, and that Jesus, that he came to this earth, that he was born of a virgin,

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:38.660
that he is the very Son of God. You think about the prophecies of Isaiah 7 and the

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:43.660
prophecy of Isaiah 9. I'm not sure how much of the book of Isaiah Philip used.

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:47.900
Again, we don't have the entirety of the message, but I'm sure that as he's

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:53.540
preaching Jesus to this eunuch, that he's using the Word of God, and even as

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:57.620
the scriptures would later tell us of the Apostle Paul, that Paul would go into

00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:02.660
those synagogues, and what would he do? He would preach to them that this Jesus

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:08.900
whom I preach unto you is Christ, that he is the Messiah, he is the promised

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:16.260
one, he is God in flesh. We find he's preaching Jesus. What a blessing. It's

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:24.420
ours still today, 2,000 years later, it's still our call to preach Jesus, to preach

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:29.260
Jesus, to lift him up. See, why? Because there's some people that don't know.

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:37.940
There's some people that say, how can I? Except some man should guide me. We find

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:44.660
that Philip preaches. The passage of Scripture tells us, as I've read by way

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:50.300
of introduction, verse number 36, that they went on their way. I'm not sure how

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:56.860
much time passed there during this encounter that Philip and this eunuch

00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:02.460
have, and how much time was given to this discussion, and this preaching of Jesus

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:07.500
to this man, but the Bible then tells us that they continue on their way, they

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:12.059
went on their way, and they came to a certain water. And as they come to this

00:17:12.059 --> 00:17:17.980
certain water, the Bible records for us the fourth question. And that question is

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:21.900
the question that we used for our title this evening, and the question is this,

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:29.020
see, here is water, what doth hinder me to be baptized? It's another great

00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:36.540
question, is it not? And we find that, once again, Philip has a proper answer. Again,

00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:39.300
I'm thankful that Philip doesn't sit back and say, you know, I'm not really

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:44.420
sure. I mean, you know, if you want to, I mean, I guess we can. And no, no, Philip was

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:49.580
prepared to give an answer. He was prepared with, as we understand biblical

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:54.100
truth, and the truth that we would find in this passage of Scripture has helped

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:59.740
us, even as we look at other portions of Scripture and begin to teach a doctrine,

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:04.700
if you will, a belief with regard to the scriptural teaching of baptism. And we

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:09.580
find that he asked the question, what doth hinder me to be baptized? Now, in

00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:18.100
verse number 37, we find that Philip will give an answer to this eunuch. As we look

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:22.779
in verses 37 really through 38, and we'll look at verses 39 and 40 as well,

00:18:22.779 --> 00:18:27.620
but as we look at these next two verses, really we've noted the four questions of

00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:31.620
the text of Scripture, but now as we get into this section of Acts chapter number

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:36.700
8, we'll have the opportunity to discover what the passage teaches us

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:43.299
regarding baptism. The answer that Philip gives to this eunuch is of significant

00:18:43.299 --> 00:18:49.739
importance. When someone approaches me, when these three guys that are going to

00:18:49.739 --> 00:18:52.980
be baptized this evening, when they approached me and said they want to get

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:57.739
baptized, I didn't just say, okay, what day do you want to get baptized? Let's go

00:18:57.739 --> 00:19:01.140
ahead and put something on the calendar, what works well for you, and we just

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:05.739
drop something on the calendar. No, that was part of the discussion, but the first

00:19:05.739 --> 00:19:09.660
part of the discussion is, why do you want to get baptized, and what does

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:16.780
baptism mean, and let's understand that we have a qualified candidate for

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:22.739
baptism, if you will. And so as we look at the passage of Scripture and we read the

00:19:22.739 --> 00:19:27.619
answer that Philip gives to the eunuch, we find that really what is

00:19:27.619 --> 00:19:33.059
revealed to us is the proper candidate for baptism. Philip says in verse number

00:19:33.059 --> 00:19:42.140
37, if thou believest with all thine heart thou mayest. What's he saying? You've

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:49.700
got to be saved. Amen? You've got to be saved. If thou believest with all thine

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:58.179
heart thou mayest. And so the requirement, the prerequisite, if you will, for

00:19:58.179 --> 00:20:02.059
baptism is salvation.

00:20:02.059 --> 00:20:07.919
you don't get baptized if you're not saved. Amen? And we find that the

00:20:07.919 --> 00:20:13.199
Scriptures clearly teach this, and we understand even as we go through all as

00:20:13.199 --> 00:20:16.379
you study through the Scriptures, you study various portions that deal with

00:20:16.379 --> 00:20:20.879
baptism, you'll understand that truth being revealed on each of those

00:20:20.879 --> 00:20:25.599
occasions. And so we find here that Philip is going to answer the question. Now I'm

00:20:25.599 --> 00:20:31.079
thankful that the man had inquired, that the man understood as he saw the water,

00:20:31.079 --> 00:20:37.379
as he understood the the teachings, no doubt that he had come in contact with

00:20:37.379 --> 00:20:42.859
with regard to baptism, and he says, what hinders me, what is it that's stopping

00:20:42.859 --> 00:20:49.979
me from being able to be baptized? If thou believest with all thine heart, thou

00:20:49.979 --> 00:20:57.139
mayest. And I love the answer of the eunuch. He answered Philip, and notice

00:20:57.139 --> 00:21:06.159
what he says at the end of verse number 37. I believe that Jesus Christ is the

00:21:06.159 --> 00:21:14.360
Son of God. He believed. He received the truth that preaching unto him Jesus, in

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:19.540
verse number 35, when Philip took and started the same passage of

00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:25.739
Scripture and preached unto him Jesus, this eunuch believed. He was confronted

00:21:25.739 --> 00:21:32.059
with the need that he had personally of a Savior. He was understanding of the

00:21:32.059 --> 00:21:37.220
truth that had been presented to him. No doubt, as we understand the whole of

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:43.099
Scripture, the Holy Spirit of God was convicting this man of his sin, of Christ's

00:21:43.099 --> 00:21:47.860
righteousness, and of judgment to come. And he questions, what doth hinder me to

00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:52.779
be baptized? And Philip responds and says, if you believe with all your

00:21:52.779 --> 00:21:57.779
heart, you may. And he says, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. What

00:21:57.779 --> 00:22:07.459
a great declaration. We find that as this encounter is taking place, and as the

00:22:07.459 --> 00:22:13.020
information is revealed to us in verse number 37, it teaches us of that proper

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:17.979
candidate for baptism that you must be saved. It also, not only in teaching us

00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:23.539
the proper candidate for baptism, we find that at the very same time, it refutes

00:22:23.539 --> 00:22:31.459
the teaching of baptismal regeneration. There are those that have the teaching

00:22:31.459 --> 00:22:40.179
that baptism saves you. It's called baptismal regeneration. This passage of

00:22:40.179 --> 00:22:45.179
Scripture would refute that teaching. We find that there are other portions of

00:22:45.179 --> 00:22:48.580
Scripture that we could go to that would refute that as well, but as we stay

00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:54.139
within the context here of Acts chapter number 8, we find that he says that

00:22:54.139 --> 00:22:59.739
if you believe, you may. So we understand that baptism doesn't save you. How are we

00:22:59.739 --> 00:23:03.739
saved? By the blood of Christ. For by grace are you saved through faith, right?

00:23:03.739 --> 00:23:07.539
It is the gift of God, not of works, lest any man should boast. We understand that

00:23:07.539 --> 00:23:13.099
salvation was paid for on the cross of Calvary with the precious blood of Jesus

00:23:13.139 --> 00:23:19.179
Christ, His death, burial, and glorious resurrection. We find that baptism is

00:23:19.179 --> 00:23:25.300
that first step of obedience, that identifying with the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:32.459
We find that baptism cannot save you. I've often said to individuals, in fact,

00:23:32.459 --> 00:23:38.139
there are large denominations that teach this thought of baptismal

00:23:38.139 --> 00:23:42.459
regeneration. In fact, if you were to go out and confront some people about their

00:23:42.459 --> 00:23:46.259
soul and ask them if they were 100% sure if they were to die today that

00:23:46.259 --> 00:23:51.179
they'd go to heaven, no doubt in my mind that if you ask enough people that

00:23:51.179 --> 00:23:56.300
somewhere along the line you'll receive the answer, yes. Why? Because I was

00:23:56.300 --> 00:24:01.979
baptized. I've received that answer plenty of times. Why? Because the

00:24:01.979 --> 00:24:07.300
denomination, the church that they're affiliated with, teaches baptismal

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:12.660
regeneration that if you're baptized, then you're saved. That's what the Bible

00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:21.220
teaches. The Bible teaches that we're saved by grace through faith, that baptism is our

00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:29.859
identifying with Jesus Christ. You can get baptized before you get saved and

00:24:29.859 --> 00:24:35.500
you've just gotten wet. I've often said to people, you took a bath without some

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:42.299
soap. Amen? Because we believe in immersion. So you get all the way wet, but you

00:24:42.299 --> 00:24:49.380
didn't get the benefit of a real bath. You just got wet. It's identifying with

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:55.579
Christ. So this teaching here not only reveals to us who the proper candidate

00:24:55.579 --> 00:24:59.380
for baptism is that you must be saved, but it also refutes baptismal

00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:04.459
regeneration. It refutes infant baptism, pedo-baptism. There are a number of

00:25:04.459 --> 00:25:11.260
denominations that teach that as well. The reality is that baptism always

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:17.899
follows salvation. In order to be saved, you've got to understand that you're a sinner. Amen?

00:25:17.899 --> 00:25:23.700
You understand that you're a sinner. There's a penalty for sin. That penalty is death,

00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:32.139
but that Jesus Christ paid that sin, that penalty for you, that God made him sin

00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:37.299
who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him. And so

00:25:37.299 --> 00:25:42.660
we understand that baptism always follows salvation, and so therefore the

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:49.019
passage before us would refute the teaching of infant baptism. Baptism

00:25:49.019 --> 00:25:53.500
always follows salvation. So we find that the text of Scripture that starts with

00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:58.419
four questions then begins to reveal to us this important teaching with regard

00:25:58.419 --> 00:26:03.299
to baptism, and first it reveals to us who the proper candidate is for baptism.

00:26:03.299 --> 00:26:08.980
Second, in verse number 38, we find that the Bible teaches us the proper mode for

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:17.859
baptism. Notice in verse number 38, and he commanded the chariot to stand still. Now

00:26:17.859 --> 00:26:21.500
again, I want you to think about Philip being in this situation, and I want you

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:25.899
to think about this conversation between Philip and the eunuch, and think about

00:26:26.139 --> 00:26:30.059
where Philip was in Samaria, all that was happening, the revival there in Samaria,

00:26:30.059 --> 00:26:34.260
and the Spirit of God moves him and brings him to this individual, this eunuch

00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:38.660
from Ethiopia. There's this conversation, this encounter that takes place. He

00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:43.660
preaches unto him, Jesus. He says, what hinders me to be baptized? And Philip

00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:47.899
says, if you believe, you may. And he says, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of

00:26:47.899 --> 00:26:52.059
God, and the Bible tells us that they commanded the chariot to stop. I think

00:26:52.059 --> 00:26:58.339
there was some excitement. Amen? I mean, I think that Philip was overwhelmed with

00:26:58.339 --> 00:27:03.660
joy as to what had just happened, understanding that a sinner had just

00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:09.660
been converted, that one that would have died and spent eternity in a Christless,

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:15.019
had a Christless eternity in the place called the Lake of Fire, now has been

00:27:15.019 --> 00:27:23.500
saved. What a blessing. What joy. By the way, some of the modern translations

00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:30.779
completely remove verse number 37 from your Bible. When the Bible says, if thou

00:27:30.779 --> 00:27:38.380
believest, thou mayest, and Philip says, or the eunuch says, I believe, in many

00:27:38.419 --> 00:27:44.139
modern translations, that verse is completely omitted. Now, think about this.

00:27:44.139 --> 00:27:49.739
The question in verse number 36, what does hinder me to be baptized? Without the

00:27:49.739 --> 00:27:54.459
answer in verse number 37, there is absolutely no reason to stop the chariot

00:27:54.459 --> 00:28:01.260
and to baptize the man. Would you agree? So these people that tell you that the

00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:06.540
modern translations just make it easier to understand. We don't change doctrine.

00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:17.100
Don't believe it. Don't believe it. Amen? So we find that that verse is completely

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:23.459
omitted. You don't believe me, go look it up. Go get an NIV. It's not there. I've

00:28:23.459 --> 00:28:31.779
shown people. It's just completely removed. Verse 38, back to the text, the proper

00:28:31.779 --> 00:28:38.419
mode for baptism. He commanded the chariot to stand still, and they went

00:28:38.419 --> 00:28:47.419
down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him. What a

00:28:47.419 --> 00:28:51.739
great, I mean, as far as we can tell, there's not a great host of people there.

00:28:51.739 --> 00:28:54.900
There's not, in a church service, where there's people that are gonna be excited

00:28:54.900 --> 00:29:00.099
and rejoicing with them. But man, this fella, this Ethiopian eunuch, he

00:29:00.099 --> 00:29:04.419
trusted Christ as a Savior. Now he's being baptized. We find that the mode is

00:29:04.419 --> 00:29:08.940
that of immersion, which would be consistent with other portions of

00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:12.739
Scripture in which we read of those that have been baptized. I'll share with you

00:29:12.739 --> 00:29:17.260
just one here with the the baptism of our Savior. In Matthew chapter number

00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:20.419
three, you don't need to turn there, I'll just read it to you. In verse number 16,

00:29:20.419 --> 00:29:25.340
the Bible says, and Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the

00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:30.260
water. If he had to go out of the water, he had to be in the water, amen? And so we

00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:35.340
find that the mode of baptism is immersion. It's consistent with others

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:40.059
that were baptized. It's consistent, by the way, with the definition of the word.

00:29:40.059 --> 00:29:47.299
They would use the word baptized, and it would mean to submerge. We understand

00:29:47.299 --> 00:29:53.500
that we would teach that baptism, the proper mode of baptism, is immersion. Not

00:29:53.539 --> 00:29:57.739
only would it be consistent with others that were baptized, not only would it be

00:29:57.739 --> 00:30:01.580
consistent with the the actual definition of the word, but we also find

00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:04.099
that it would be

00:30:04.099 --> 00:30:07.739
consistent with the picture that baptism represents.

00:30:07.739 --> 00:30:10.659
You understand that the Lord has given

00:30:10.659 --> 00:30:14.899
the local New Testament church two ordinances.

00:30:14.899 --> 00:30:17.059
We have the ordinance of the Lord's Supper,

00:30:17.059 --> 00:30:19.499
we have the ordinance of baptism.

00:30:19.499 --> 00:30:21.739
Those are local church ordinances,

00:30:21.739 --> 00:30:25.259
and we understand the teaching that he has given us,

00:30:25.259 --> 00:30:29.259
and as we understand the teaching of the Lord's Supper,

00:30:29.259 --> 00:30:34.259
that this is a memorial, this due in remembrance of me,

00:30:34.499 --> 00:30:36.499
we also understand it's a picture.

00:30:36.499 --> 00:30:40.139
It does show the Lord's death till he returned, right?

00:30:40.139 --> 00:30:43.179
That's what the scriptures teach us in 1 Corinthians 11.

00:30:43.179 --> 00:30:45.499
And so we find that this second ordinance

00:30:45.499 --> 00:30:47.899
for the local church, that of baptism,

00:30:47.899 --> 00:30:50.939
also pictures something significant.

00:30:50.939 --> 00:30:53.539
In Romans chapter number six, turn over there if you will,

00:30:53.539 --> 00:30:55.559
in Romans chapter number six,

00:30:55.559 --> 00:30:57.459
we find that the scriptures would teach,

00:30:57.459 --> 00:31:00.159
as the Apostle Paul is speaking to these at Rome,

00:31:00.159 --> 00:31:01.999
he's speaking to them about baptism,

00:31:01.999 --> 00:31:06.099
and he says this in verses three and four of Romans six.

00:31:09.879 --> 00:31:13.079
Know ye not that so many of us,

00:31:13.079 --> 00:31:16.719
as were baptized into Jesus Christ,

00:31:16.719 --> 00:31:20.679
were baptized into his death?

00:31:20.679 --> 00:31:22.279
Notice verse number four.

00:31:22.279 --> 00:31:27.279
Therefore, we are buried with him,

00:31:27.599 --> 00:31:30.439
by baptism into death,

00:31:30.439 --> 00:31:33.859
that like as Christ was raised up from the dead

00:31:33.859 --> 00:31:35.239
by the glory of the Father,

00:31:35.239 --> 00:31:40.239
even so we also should walk in newness of life.

00:31:42.119 --> 00:31:43.239
In just a few moments,

00:31:43.239 --> 00:31:47.259
as these young guys get into the baptismal tank,

00:31:47.259 --> 00:31:50.799
the water is there, and they will stand in the water.

00:31:50.799 --> 00:31:53.199
And I've often used the picture

00:31:53.199 --> 00:31:56.519
that that water is like this horizontal plane here,

00:31:56.519 --> 00:31:58.359
and they will stand in that water,

00:31:58.359 --> 00:32:03.139
if you could picture in your mind's eye, a cross.

00:32:03.139 --> 00:32:04.759
And as they are baptized,

00:32:04.759 --> 00:32:08.979
they're baptized as Christ was buried, right?

00:32:08.979 --> 00:32:13.659
And then to rise and walk in newness of life.

00:32:13.659 --> 00:32:17.219
And so we find that it pictures the death,

00:32:17.219 --> 00:32:20.899
burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

00:32:22.519 --> 00:32:25.759
We understand the picture as it's given here

00:32:25.759 --> 00:32:29.919
by the Apostle Paul in Romans 6, verses 3 and 4,

00:32:29.919 --> 00:32:33.799
that we, as many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ,

00:32:33.799 --> 00:32:35.879
were baptized into his death.

00:32:35.879 --> 00:32:40.419
Therefore, we are buried with him by baptism into death.

00:32:40.419 --> 00:32:44.019
That like as Christ was raised up from the dead

00:32:44.019 --> 00:32:45.299
by the glory of the Father,

00:32:45.299 --> 00:32:49.279
even so we also should walk in newness of life.

00:32:49.279 --> 00:32:52.959
Often, I've had people ask me this question.

00:32:53.039 --> 00:32:57.279
How long are you going to hold me under the water?

00:32:57.279 --> 00:32:59.039
It's a fun question.

00:32:59.039 --> 00:33:01.679
And I'll say to these folks that ask that question,

00:33:01.679 --> 00:33:05.359
I'll say, well, how long was Jesus in the tomb?

00:33:05.359 --> 00:33:08.179
And then they look at me real perplexed.

00:33:08.179 --> 00:33:09.459
Because they know the answer,

00:33:09.459 --> 00:33:11.959
but they don't really want to give the answer, right?

00:33:11.959 --> 00:33:13.919
And they just kind of look at you like,

00:33:13.919 --> 00:33:15.979
you've got to be kidding, right?

00:33:15.979 --> 00:33:18.419
And I'll say, well, I know you can't hold your breath

00:33:18.419 --> 00:33:20.159
for three days, but maybe we'll just do a minute

00:33:20.159 --> 00:33:21.459
for each day.

00:33:21.459 --> 00:33:23.859
And they still look at you really perplexed, you know?

00:33:23.859 --> 00:33:25.859
And so I had to reassure these three guys

00:33:25.859 --> 00:33:27.879
before the service that it's just going to be real quick.

00:33:27.879 --> 00:33:28.719
Don't panic.

00:33:28.719 --> 00:33:30.359
I'm just going to put you under and bring you back up.

00:33:30.359 --> 00:33:31.199
Amen?

00:33:31.199 --> 00:33:34.659
And it's not going to be any kind of lengthy

00:33:34.659 --> 00:33:36.819
period of time that you'd be under the water,

00:33:36.819 --> 00:33:40.359
but it is important that they are under the water

00:33:40.359 --> 00:33:43.019
because of the picture.

00:33:43.019 --> 00:33:43.859
Amen?

00:33:44.939 --> 00:33:47.099
So we notice the instruction,

00:33:47.099 --> 00:33:49.739
but just as we found in verse number 37

00:33:49.739 --> 00:33:51.019
of Acts chapter number eight,

00:33:51.539 --> 00:33:54.739
that the instruction also gave us some teachings

00:33:54.739 --> 00:33:57.579
that it would refute, such as the case even here

00:33:57.579 --> 00:33:59.779
with the proper mode for baptism,

00:33:59.779 --> 00:34:02.139
that it would refute that of sprinkling.

00:34:03.299 --> 00:34:06.059
It would refute the teaching of baptism by sprinkling.

00:34:06.059 --> 00:34:08.619
We teach baptism by immersion.

00:34:08.619 --> 00:34:09.459
Why?

00:34:09.459 --> 00:34:10.679
Because it's biblical.

00:34:11.579 --> 00:34:13.579
And we're supposed to be biblical.

00:34:13.579 --> 00:34:14.539
Amen?

00:34:14.539 --> 00:34:17.819
The book that is sitting here upon this sacred desk,

00:34:17.819 --> 00:34:19.899
the book I now hold in my hand,

00:34:19.899 --> 00:34:22.299
we say, as Baptist people,

00:34:22.299 --> 00:34:27.299
that it is the sole authority for faith and practice.

00:34:28.419 --> 00:34:29.739
Amen?

00:34:29.739 --> 00:34:30.739
And it must be.

00:34:32.219 --> 00:34:36.299
By the way, if we deviate from this book,

00:34:36.299 --> 00:34:37.219
we're in trouble.

00:34:39.719 --> 00:34:41.219
We're in trouble.

00:34:41.219 --> 00:34:44.039
We've got to follow the teachings of the word of God.

00:34:44.039 --> 00:34:48.199
It's important that we follow the scriptures.

00:34:49.119 --> 00:34:51.399
Now, notice what happens.

00:34:51.399 --> 00:34:53.959
The Bible tells us that they went down into the water

00:34:53.959 --> 00:34:56.039
in verse 38, verse 39,

00:34:56.039 --> 00:34:58.559
and when they were come up out of the water,

00:35:00.119 --> 00:35:03.079
the spirit of the Lord caught away Philip.

00:35:03.079 --> 00:35:04.519
Now, think about the eunuch.

00:35:05.919 --> 00:35:10.919
I mean, Philip just arrived out of nowhere, seemingly, right?

00:35:11.879 --> 00:35:12.999
He'd been in Samaria,

00:35:12.999 --> 00:35:14.539
and the spirit of God brought him there

00:35:14.539 --> 00:35:15.759
to where the eunuch was,

00:35:15.759 --> 00:35:17.519
and he says, yeah, that's the chariot,

00:35:17.679 --> 00:35:19.479
the spirit of God leads him to the chariot.

00:35:19.479 --> 00:35:21.559
He climbs up in after he says,

00:35:21.559 --> 00:35:23.879
understandest thou what thou readest?

00:35:25.039 --> 00:35:27.919
And as he baptizes this eunuch,

00:35:27.919 --> 00:35:29.599
the Bible says they come out of the water,

00:35:29.599 --> 00:35:33.039
and the spirit of the Lord caught away Philip

00:35:33.039 --> 00:35:36.039
that the eunuch saw him no more.

00:35:37.439 --> 00:35:40.359
But notice the last part of verse number 39.

00:35:40.359 --> 00:35:44.399
And he went on his way rejoicing.

00:35:45.239 --> 00:35:47.799
He went on his way rejoicing.

00:35:49.839 --> 00:35:52.239
The Bible says that Philip was found at Azotus

00:35:52.239 --> 00:35:54.239
and passing through, he preached in all the cities

00:35:54.239 --> 00:35:55.639
till he came to Caesarea.

00:35:55.639 --> 00:35:57.119
I mean, Philip was,

00:35:57.119 --> 00:35:59.839
if I could use the terminology this evening,

00:35:59.839 --> 00:36:01.899
he's on a spiritual high, amen?

00:36:01.899 --> 00:36:05.039
I mean, he's just seen some amazing things happening

00:36:05.039 --> 00:36:06.919
in Samaria, and now with the eunuch,

00:36:06.919 --> 00:36:09.919
and now he's going and preaching

00:36:09.919 --> 00:36:12.479
through all of these cities in which he would travel

00:36:12.479 --> 00:36:14.279
until he came to Caesarea.

00:36:15.119 --> 00:36:17.079
And we find, however, that as we would trace the steps

00:36:17.079 --> 00:36:19.839
of the eunuch throughout the passage of Scripture,

00:36:19.839 --> 00:36:21.679
I want you to consider his condition.

00:36:23.679 --> 00:36:26.399
Consider where it was that we found the eunuch.

00:36:26.399 --> 00:36:28.719
He was lost, right?

00:36:29.879 --> 00:36:33.999
The beginning of our account in verse number 26,

00:36:33.999 --> 00:36:36.439
when the spirit of God begins to lead Philip,

00:36:36.439 --> 00:36:40.319
and then of course as we find the encounter with the eunuch,

00:36:40.319 --> 00:36:43.559
we'd find that this eunuch is lost.

00:36:43.599 --> 00:36:47.559
Not only is he lost, he's confused, right?

00:36:47.559 --> 00:36:50.439
He says, how can I except some man should guide me?

00:36:50.439 --> 00:36:53.159
That someone would give me instruction.

00:36:53.159 --> 00:36:56.639
He says, whom speaketh the prophet this of himself

00:36:56.639 --> 00:36:57.919
or of some other man?

00:36:57.919 --> 00:36:59.919
There was a measure of confusion.

00:37:01.959 --> 00:37:03.519
No doubt he was convicted

00:37:04.479 --> 00:37:08.239
when Philip took the same portion of Scripture

00:37:08.239 --> 00:37:10.359
and preached unto him Jesus.

00:37:11.239 --> 00:37:15.879
You know, the Bible tells us that God has ordained preaching.

00:37:17.039 --> 00:37:17.959
Amen?

00:37:17.959 --> 00:37:19.199
He has ordained preaching.

00:37:19.199 --> 00:37:21.879
You read 1 Corinthians chapter number one.

00:37:21.879 --> 00:37:25.439
You read how that God has ordained

00:37:25.439 --> 00:37:28.319
the preaching of His Word.

00:37:28.319 --> 00:37:31.719
He uses the preaching of His Word.

00:37:31.719 --> 00:37:35.679
Paul instructs Timothy at the end of Paul's life

00:37:35.679 --> 00:37:37.439
in 2 Timothy chapter number four,

00:37:37.639 --> 00:37:41.439
and he says, preach the Word.

00:37:41.439 --> 00:37:42.279
Why?

00:37:42.279 --> 00:37:44.199
Because that's what God uses.

00:37:44.199 --> 00:37:45.679
That's what God uses.

00:37:45.679 --> 00:37:47.759
No doubt in my mind,

00:37:47.759 --> 00:37:51.879
this eunuch was under conviction during the preaching.

00:37:51.879 --> 00:37:54.359
By the way, it's good to be under conviction.

00:37:54.359 --> 00:37:55.439
Amen?

00:37:55.439 --> 00:37:57.439
I hope that when you read your Bible tomorrow,

00:37:57.439 --> 00:37:59.879
the Holy Spirit of God convicts you.

00:37:59.879 --> 00:38:01.839
You say, oh, why do you hope that?

00:38:01.839 --> 00:38:03.719
I hope He convicts me.

00:38:04.799 --> 00:38:05.919
Amen?

00:38:05.919 --> 00:38:07.399
I want to be sensitive to the leading

00:38:07.399 --> 00:38:09.079
of the Holy Spirit of God.

00:38:09.079 --> 00:38:11.039
I want the Lord to teach me.

00:38:11.039 --> 00:38:13.279
As I open my Bible each morning,

00:38:13.279 --> 00:38:15.319
I say, Lord, open Thou mine eyes

00:38:15.319 --> 00:38:17.759
that I may behold wondrous things out of Thy law.

00:38:17.759 --> 00:38:19.639
I say, Lord, teach me Thy way.

00:38:19.639 --> 00:38:21.439
Help me to walk in Thy way.

00:38:21.439 --> 00:38:24.559
Help me to be a doer of the Word, not a hearer only.

00:38:24.559 --> 00:38:27.559
Help me, Lord, to understand what I need to stop doing.

00:38:27.559 --> 00:38:29.839
Help me to start doing the things I need to do.

00:38:29.839 --> 00:38:32.159
Lord, convict me.

00:38:32.159 --> 00:38:32.999
Amen?

00:38:32.999 --> 00:38:34.359
We ought to pray that God convicts us.

00:38:34.359 --> 00:38:36.159
It's good for us.

00:38:38.199 --> 00:38:40.919
If the Word of God doesn't convict you,

00:38:40.919 --> 00:38:44.239
I'd be concerned, honestly.

00:38:44.239 --> 00:38:45.839
If you'd evaluate and say, you know,

00:38:45.839 --> 00:38:48.239
I don't remember the last time I was convicted,

00:38:49.199 --> 00:38:50.880
I'd be concerned.

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:51.719
Why?

00:38:51.719 --> 00:38:54.719
Because we're not gonna be perfect until we get to heaven.

00:38:54.719 --> 00:38:55.559
Amen?

00:38:56.559 --> 00:38:58.279
The Word of God convicts.

00:38:58.279 --> 00:39:02.199
And I believe that this lost, confused man

00:39:02.199 --> 00:39:04.479
was convicted when he heard the preaching

00:39:04.479 --> 00:39:06.000
of the Word of God,

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.279
when Philip preached Christ unto him.

00:39:09.479 --> 00:39:10.599
Then he was converted.

00:39:11.599 --> 00:39:13.239
Amen?

00:39:13.239 --> 00:39:18.239
He said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.

00:39:19.399 --> 00:39:23.880
I can see Philip, as he commanded that chariot to stop,

00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:26.880
saying, based upon your profession of faith,

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:28.440
that's what we say.

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:29.279
Amen?

00:39:29.279 --> 00:39:31.880
When I'm about to baptize these boys, what did I do?

00:39:32.559 --> 00:39:33.399
I sat down with him and said,

00:39:33.399 --> 00:39:34.880
tell me about when you got saved.

00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:35.719
Why?

00:39:35.719 --> 00:39:37.359
Because you gotta be a proper candidate.

00:39:37.359 --> 00:39:39.199
Not just anyone's getting baptized.

00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:42.279
They gotta be saved.

00:39:42.279 --> 00:39:46.159
This man's converted, then he's baptized,

00:39:46.159 --> 00:39:49.919
and we see him at the end of the passage

00:39:49.919 --> 00:39:52.599
in a different way than we saw in the beginning.

00:39:52.599 --> 00:39:54.839
We see him rejoicing.

00:39:54.839 --> 00:39:57.239
You know, it's good to be saved.

00:39:57.239 --> 00:39:58.319
Amen?

00:39:58.319 --> 00:40:00.639
I mean, just to think about,

00:40:00.639 --> 00:40:03.119
even as I mentioned last Sunday evening,

00:40:03.119 --> 00:40:04.719
we had that outdoor service.

00:40:04.719 --> 00:40:08.719
and look at that simple truth from 1 Thessalonians 5

00:40:08.719 --> 00:40:11.439
and verse 16, rejoice evermore.

00:40:11.439 --> 00:40:13.379
Remember what Jesus said to the disciples,

00:40:13.379 --> 00:40:15.679
they came back rejoicing in the fact

00:40:15.679 --> 00:40:17.679
that the spirits were, you know,

00:40:17.679 --> 00:40:21.399
they were able to do some amazing things

00:40:21.399 --> 00:40:23.719
and Jesus said, rejoice not in this,

00:40:23.719 --> 00:40:25.479
that the spirits are made subject unto thee,

00:40:25.479 --> 00:40:28.479
rather rejoice, why, that your names are written in heaven.

00:40:29.899 --> 00:40:34.119
And this evening we see that this man went on his way,

00:40:34.159 --> 00:40:37.559
rejoicing, went on his way rejoicing.

00:40:37.559 --> 00:40:38.699
I wonder this evening,

00:40:42.359 --> 00:40:44.439
how often do we go on our way rejoicing?

00:40:45.639 --> 00:40:50.259
Not to re-preach what I shared last Sunday evening,

00:40:50.259 --> 00:40:55.259
but the reality is that, man, I'm going to heaven, amen?

00:40:55.319 --> 00:40:57.979
Miss Joyce encourages me often,

00:40:57.979 --> 00:41:02.979
91, gonna be 92 in April, May, April.

00:41:04.879 --> 00:41:08.199
She says all the time, I'm going to heaven.

00:41:10.159 --> 00:41:12.099
Praise God.

00:41:12.099 --> 00:41:13.599
I mean, we think about the Apostle Paul,

00:41:13.599 --> 00:41:14.819
he says, why, we look down at these things

00:41:14.819 --> 00:41:17.119
which are temporal, those things which are eternal, right?

00:41:17.119 --> 00:41:19.599
Paul said that he was in a straight betwixt two,

00:41:19.599 --> 00:41:22.539
you read it in Philippians chapter number one.

00:41:22.539 --> 00:41:23.999
He says, I'm in a straight betwixt two,

00:41:23.999 --> 00:41:25.679
having the desire to part with Christ,

00:41:25.679 --> 00:41:28.999
which is far better.

00:41:28.999 --> 00:41:30.999
He knew he was going to heaven.

00:41:30.999 --> 00:41:32.999
He said, it's not time yet,

00:41:33.039 --> 00:41:34.519
I gotta be here for you.

00:41:34.519 --> 00:41:36.759
He understood the plan of God.

00:41:36.759 --> 00:41:38.199
But we understand this evening

00:41:38.199 --> 00:41:40.559
that as we look at the passage of Scripture,

00:41:40.559 --> 00:41:45.559
that when we started, we see a lost, confused man.

00:41:45.879 --> 00:41:50.719
And when we end, we see a saved, rejoicing man.

00:41:50.719 --> 00:41:51.759
Isn't that exciting?

00:41:53.119 --> 00:41:58.119
And this evening, I don't know who you are in this story.

00:41:58.439 --> 00:42:03.479
Maybe you can identify at the end of the story

00:42:03.479 --> 00:42:06.559
and say, I'm the eunuch that's saved and rejoicing.

00:42:06.559 --> 00:42:07.639
If you're saved this evening,

00:42:07.639 --> 00:42:09.959
we ought to identify with the eunuch.

00:42:09.959 --> 00:42:12.079
But maybe there's someone either here locally

00:42:12.079 --> 00:42:14.479
or watching live stream that really,

00:42:14.479 --> 00:42:16.319
they best identify with the eunuch

00:42:16.319 --> 00:42:17.919
at the beginning of the story,

00:42:17.919 --> 00:42:20.719
at the beginning of the account.

00:42:20.719 --> 00:42:24.119
They're lost, they're confused.

00:42:24.119 --> 00:42:27.639
The reality of death frightens them.

00:42:27.639 --> 00:42:30.799
They do not have an assurance of salvation.

00:42:30.799 --> 00:42:32.759
Maybe someone would identify with the eunuch

00:42:32.759 --> 00:42:35.839
at the start of the account and say,

00:42:35.839 --> 00:42:36.959
what do I need?

00:42:36.959 --> 00:42:39.959
You need to be saved, you need to be saved.

00:42:39.959 --> 00:42:43.239
Maybe this evening, some of us can identify with Philip.

00:42:44.119 --> 00:42:45.959
Lord, use me.

00:42:47.039 --> 00:42:48.639
The preacher this morning, Brother Hurst,

00:42:48.639 --> 00:42:53.279
he shared about how God uses his servants.

00:42:53.279 --> 00:42:55.559
Isn't it a blessing to be used of the Lord?

00:42:56.559 --> 00:42:59.799
To think that Philip had the opportunity

00:42:59.799 --> 00:43:03.679
to be able to go and to have this encounter.

00:43:04.839 --> 00:43:05.999
As we have noted,

00:43:05.999 --> 00:43:08.159
as we've gone through the passage of Scripture,

00:43:08.159 --> 00:43:11.679
there had to have been some preparation on Philip's part.

00:43:13.359 --> 00:43:17.119
God chose to use Philip in this way

00:43:17.119 --> 00:43:19.919
because Philip had prepared to be used.

00:43:20.919 --> 00:43:22.279
Amen?

00:43:22.279 --> 00:43:24.719
And so maybe we gotta be prepared to be used.

00:43:24.919 --> 00:43:26.839
Lord, I wanna be used.

00:43:26.839 --> 00:43:29.439
Lord, help me to be in a position

00:43:29.439 --> 00:43:32.359
where I can be used to bring honor and glory to thy name.

00:43:32.359 --> 00:43:35.519
Help me to study to show myself approved unto God.

00:43:35.519 --> 00:43:38.159
Help me to understand the truth of thy word.

00:43:38.159 --> 00:43:40.919
Lord, use me for your honor and glory.

00:43:40.919 --> 00:43:45.919
And then when the Spirit of God would whisper to us

00:43:46.479 --> 00:43:48.399
of going and speaking to someone,

00:43:48.399 --> 00:43:50.319
of being used in this capacity,

00:43:50.319 --> 00:43:52.879
that we would follow the example of Philip

00:43:52.879 --> 00:43:54.879
and we'd obey straight away.

00:43:55.839 --> 00:43:59.519
We see that he not only arose and went in verse number 27,

00:43:59.519 --> 00:44:01.479
but when he was told of what chariot to go to,

00:44:01.479 --> 00:44:03.399
he ran thither.

00:44:03.399 --> 00:44:04.239
I love it.

00:44:07.239 --> 00:44:09.439
So again, as we look at the passage of Scripture,

00:44:09.439 --> 00:44:11.399
we read some important questions.

00:44:11.399 --> 00:44:14.359
We can identify with some of the characters.

00:44:14.359 --> 00:44:17.119
We can receive the instruction that God has for us

00:44:17.119 --> 00:44:19.159
with regard to baptism.

00:44:20.079 --> 00:44:23.399
And we, this evening, if we're saved,

00:44:23.399 --> 00:44:25.119
we need to go on our way rejoicing.

00:44:26.519 --> 00:44:27.999
What are you so happy about?

00:44:29.159 --> 00:44:30.279
What are you so joyful?

00:44:30.279 --> 00:44:33.119
Don't you know what's going on in our,

00:44:33.119 --> 00:44:34.719
I'm going to heaven.

00:44:34.719 --> 00:44:37.319
It's not that, again, I said this many times this year.

00:44:37.319 --> 00:44:40.439
I haven't said it often recently.

00:44:40.439 --> 00:44:43.519
I'm not rejoicing because I have my head in the sand.

00:44:45.079 --> 00:44:48.239
I'm aware of things that are going on in our world.

00:44:48.519 --> 00:44:51.599
I'm rejoicing because I got my eyes on my Savior.

00:44:52.999 --> 00:44:56.199
And the reality is that he knows all about it.

00:44:56.199 --> 00:44:58.199
He's alpha and omega.

00:44:58.199 --> 00:44:59.319
Do we believe it?

00:44:59.319 --> 00:45:00.439
Beginning and the end.

00:45:00.439 --> 00:45:02.919
Did anything this year, did anything in 2020,

00:45:02.919 --> 00:45:04.679
I know the answer already.

00:45:04.679 --> 00:45:07.919
Did anything in 2020 happen that surprised you?

00:45:07.919 --> 00:45:08.959
You say anything?

00:45:08.959 --> 00:45:11.759
How about everything, right?

00:45:11.759 --> 00:45:14.319
But do you understand that nothing surprised God?

00:45:15.439 --> 00:45:16.999
Nothing did.

00:45:16.999 --> 00:45:18.119
He knows all about it.

00:45:19.639 --> 00:45:20.759
He's sovereign.

00:45:20.759 --> 00:45:22.399
He's in control.

00:45:22.399 --> 00:45:24.439
And so we can go on our way rejoicing.

00:45:25.359 --> 00:45:28.119
We can ask God, God, would you use me?

00:45:28.119 --> 00:45:29.559
I'm not Philip.

00:45:31.199 --> 00:45:33.919
See, sometimes people say, I want to be used like so-and-so.

00:45:33.919 --> 00:45:35.279
I want to be used like Paul.

00:45:35.279 --> 00:45:37.279
I want God to, the reality is that

00:45:37.279 --> 00:45:40.159
if we would just surrender ourselves,

00:45:40.159 --> 00:45:45.159
God will use us in the way that he chooses to use us

00:45:46.039 --> 00:45:48.839
to bring honor and glory to his name.

00:45:50.919 --> 00:45:52.919
And we simply have to be surrendered.

00:45:53.799 --> 00:45:55.719
I heard a man say this.

00:45:55.719 --> 00:45:59.479
He had heard many people speak about wanting to be used

00:45:59.479 --> 00:46:01.319
as the apostle Paul was used.

00:46:02.639 --> 00:46:07.639
And he said, basically,

00:46:08.199 --> 00:46:11.119
I don't want you to use that terminology anymore.

00:46:12.119 --> 00:46:15.159
I want you to rather say, I want to be surrendered

00:46:15.159 --> 00:46:16.479
as Paul was.

00:46:17.399 --> 00:46:21.199
Because if you're surrendered as Paul was,

00:46:21.199 --> 00:46:22.479
then God will use you.

00:46:24.799 --> 00:46:26.919
And I want God to use me.

00:46:26.919 --> 00:46:29.839
God used Philip in this passage of Scripture.

00:46:29.839 --> 00:46:32.079
In fact, I believe that as this eunuch

00:46:32.079 --> 00:46:34.519
went on his way rejoicing,

00:46:34.519 --> 00:46:35.639
history would tell us,

00:46:35.639 --> 00:46:37.959
though the book of Acts doesn't trace it,

00:46:38.919 --> 00:46:41.239
that there were many that received the gospel

00:46:41.239 --> 00:46:43.239
because of this man's testimony.

00:46:43.999 --> 00:46:46.199
Oh, that God would use us.

00:46:46.199 --> 00:46:48.279
What doth hinder me to be baptized?

00:46:48.279 --> 00:46:49.519
Well, you gotta be saved.

00:46:50.519 --> 00:46:52.559
The proper candidate is given to us.

00:46:52.559 --> 00:46:55.079
The proper mode is given to us.

00:46:55.079 --> 00:46:58.599
And this evening, we're gonna baptize these three guys.

00:46:58.599 --> 00:47:00.799
And looking forward to that here in just a moment.

00:47:00.799 --> 00:47:03.359
Before we do, we'll have a moment of invitation.

00:47:03.359 --> 00:47:04.679
Father, we love you.

00:47:04.679 --> 00:47:06.399
We thank you so much for loving us.

00:47:06.679 --> 00:47:08.119
We thank you for the Word of God,

00:47:08.119 --> 00:47:09.839
the truth contained therein.

00:47:11.039 --> 00:47:16.039
We thank you for the opportunity to study this account,

00:47:16.479 --> 00:47:19.359
to identify with these individuals.

00:47:19.359 --> 00:47:22.879
Lord, to be strengthened in our faith.

00:47:23.759 --> 00:47:26.119
I pray, God, that you'd use us.

00:47:26.119 --> 00:47:29.399
I pray that we would be yielded and surrendered.

00:47:29.399 --> 00:47:32.239
God, that we would allow you

00:47:32.239 --> 00:47:34.039
to have your will and way in our lives.

00:47:34.039 --> 00:47:39.039
That we will respond in obedience to your direction.

00:47:44.519 --> 00:47:48.199
Father, I pray that if there's one that's not saved,

00:47:48.199 --> 00:47:50.079
Lord, that the Holy Spirit of God

00:47:50.079 --> 00:47:52.079
would convict and convince.

00:47:53.159 --> 00:47:54.679
They would not leave this place

00:47:54.679 --> 00:47:56.439
nor log off from livestream

00:47:56.439 --> 00:47:59.159
without knowing for sure that heaven is their home.

00:48:00.159 --> 00:48:05.159
Thank you for Tim and Joel, Lucas.

00:48:05.999 --> 00:48:08.239
Thank you for their salvation.

00:48:08.239 --> 00:48:10.159
We thank you for the opportunity this evening

00:48:10.159 --> 00:48:11.759
to baptize them,

00:48:11.759 --> 00:48:15.399
for their desire to follow you in believers' baptism.

00:48:15.399 --> 00:48:18.159
I pray, God, that you'd use these young men

00:48:18.159 --> 00:48:19.879
for your honor and for your glory.

00:48:21.719 --> 00:48:24.239
I pray, God, that we would, as the eunuch did,

00:48:24.239 --> 00:48:26.359
Lord, go on our way rejoicing.

00:48:27.359 --> 00:48:29.679
Have your will and way in these moments

00:48:29.679 --> 00:48:30.599
and we'll thank you for it.

00:48:30.599 --> 00:48:32.719
In Christ's name we pray, amen.

00:48:32.719 --> 00:48:33.559
Would you stand with me?

00:48:33.559 --> 00:48:34.759
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

00:48:34.759 --> 00:48:37.119
Holly's gonna play quietly on the piano

00:48:37.119 --> 00:48:38.799
and we'll have a moment of invitation.

00:48:38.799 --> 00:48:42.119
You can pray there in your seat, make your seat and altar.

00:48:42.119 --> 00:48:45.079
You can come up to this old-fashioned altar and pray here.

00:48:45.079 --> 00:48:47.159
And after the invitation time,

00:48:47.159 --> 00:48:50.959
we'll sing a song as we get ready for baptism this evening.

00:48:50.959 --> 00:48:54.000
Let the Lord have his way in your life.
