WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.239
number four, 1 John chapter number four, and the title of our message you've seen in the

00:00:05.239 --> 00:00:09.000
bulletin on the back of the bulletin comes from the middle of verse number four.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.560
And I'll say this, the phrase from verse number four that we'll use as our title this morning

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:20.680
is a phrase of Scripture that is often quoted, often referred to as it should be.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.680
The Bible says in the middle of verse number four, greater is he that is in you than he

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.639
that is in the world.

00:00:27.639 --> 00:00:34.459
And we often quote and reference that truth of 1 John 4 in verse number four.

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:39.799
And I'm so thankful for this truth in verse number four, as we started the fourth chapter

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:43.799
of the book of 1 John, as we're studying through this book, last week, we noticed that there

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:49.799
was a twofold exhortation to begin the fourth chapter of the book of 1 John.

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:57.279
And that twofold exhortation, it started first by telling us this, believe not every spirit.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:03.400
And we found that we were given this truth from John as the false teachers, of course,

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.480
were active and working.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.080
And John says to these believers that he's writing to, believe not every spirit.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.580
And then he says this, try the spirits.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.459
And he gives us the instruction on how we try the spirits to determine whether they

00:01:17.459 --> 00:01:18.680
are of God.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.959
He tells us that many false prophets have gone out into the world, and hereby know ye

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:24.959
the Spirit of God.

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:29.199
Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God.

00:01:29.199 --> 00:01:33.339
And the contrast in verse number three, and every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus

00:01:33.339 --> 00:01:36.639
Christ has come in the flesh is not of God.

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:42.400
And this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come, and even

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.319
now already is it in the world.

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:52.480
And we find that these false teachers, they continue even to this very day to peddle their

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.980
false doctrine.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.180
But we've been provided, as we study the Word of God, we've been provided with everything

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:05.339
necessary to not only expose, but to overcome the false teachers, to overcome the false

00:02:05.339 --> 00:02:06.339
doctrine.

00:02:06.339 --> 00:02:11.119
Now, we find that the Spirit of truth indwells every believer, as we studied, as we referenced

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:15.580
back to the book of John last week, we understand that Jesus said that He would send the Spirit

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:22.419
of truth, and when He, the Spirit of truth, has come, that He will lead you into all truth.

00:02:22.419 --> 00:02:24.020
And for that, we ought to rejoice.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.660
And then He says this, thy word is truth, amen?

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:34.339
And what a joy to understand this morning that God has given us everything that we need

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:41.220
in order to expose and overcome the false teaching that continues to be prevalent even

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.179
still today.

00:02:43.179 --> 00:02:49.380
We find that God has given us the authoritative, preserved, perfect Word of God, and every

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.059
Word of God is pure.

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:56.179
And we find that as we have the Spirit of God leading us into all truth, and we have

00:02:56.179 --> 00:03:03.919
the Word of God, that we are able to determine the truth and expose the error.

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:06.899
Our God has blessed us with all spiritual blessings.

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:11.660
He's given us all things that pertain unto life and godliness.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:18.740
We are equipped, God has equipped us to not be defeated by false teachers, but to overcome

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.100
false teaching.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.100
And we ought to rejoice in that.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.339
We ought to be thankful for that this morning.

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:27.679
And so we preach this message this morning, greater is He that is in you.

00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:29.259
Greater is He that is in you.

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:33.619
Notice in verse number four, the text of Scripture continues, and John, under the inspiration

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:41.660
of the Holy Spirit of God, says to these believers, ye are of God, little children, and have overcome

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:47.539
them because greater is He that is in you than He that is in the world.

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:54.580
They are of the world, therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them.

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.460
We are of God.

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.100
He that knoweth God heareth us.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.619
He that is not of God heareth not us.

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:08.419
Hereby know we the Spirit of truth and the Spirit of error.

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:14.460
Listen, there is the Holy Spirit of God, the third person of the Godhead, that is the Spirit

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:15.699
of truth.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.859
But there is a Spirit of error.

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:25.779
And we see that the enemy, the Satan, the enemy of God's people, the enemy of God Himself,

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:31.059
that Spirit of error, the Spirit of antichrist that we read of in verse number three, it

00:04:31.059 --> 00:04:37.920
says at the end of the verse, of verse number three, even now already is it in the world.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.880
This morning, if you're taking notes, I want you to first notice what was recognized.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.559
Notice what is recognized in verse number four.

00:04:44.559 --> 00:04:50.040
As we begin reading this portion of this passage of Scripture, we find that John once again

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.880
will refer to those that he's writing to.

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.899
He says, you're of God, and he refers to them as little children.

00:04:54.899 --> 00:04:57.500
We read that back in the second chapter as well.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.119
But I want you to notice this phrase right at the beginning of verse number four.

00:05:01.119 --> 00:05:06.239
He says, and have overcome them.

00:05:06.239 --> 00:05:10.720
What is recognized by John under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God as he's writing

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.880
to these believers, he is saying to them that ye have overcome them.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.040
And I want you to just think about this recognition for just a moment, and I want you to understand

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.640
that contextually, as we look at the verse of Scripture, that the warning that had been

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:30.200
given with regard to false teachers in the previous text of Scripture, that John is now

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:37.160
recognizing that these recipients of this book, they had overcome the false teachers.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:43.540
They had not been overcome by the false teachers, no rather, they had overcome the false teachers.

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:49.399
We find that these individuals that John is writing to, they had not been led astray.

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:51.000
Aren't you thankful for that?

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.519
The Bible tells us in the book of 2 Peter, in chapter number two, turn over there if

00:05:54.519 --> 00:05:59.119
you will, when we think about these false teachers and their desire, we looked at in

00:05:59.119 --> 00:06:05.200
the second chapter how the desire of these false teachers is to lead astray, to lead

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.200
away.

00:06:06.239 --> 00:06:12.000
We look back in 2 Peter, notice how Peter words it here, but there were false prophets

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:19.200
also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:24.799
bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves

00:06:24.799 --> 00:06:26.079
swift destruction.

00:06:26.079 --> 00:06:32.079
Notice this in verse number two, and many shall follow their pernicious ways.

00:06:32.079 --> 00:06:36.040
You ever see how sometimes it seems like these false teachers, these false cults, they have

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:41.119
a large following, they seem that they have a majority of people, and there are times

00:06:41.119 --> 00:06:45.480
in which, if we're not careful, that we may look at the size of a crowd and we might come

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:49.959
to the conclusion that because of the size of the crowd, they may be right, they must

00:06:49.959 --> 00:06:53.600
be right, because look at how many people are following them.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:57.600
But the reality is that the Bible tells us Jesus, in fact, said broad was the road, the

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.600
way that leads to destruction.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:00.600
Amen?

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:01.600
Narrow.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:06.799
And we find here that as we look at the verse of Scripture in verse number two of 2 Peter

00:07:06.799 --> 00:07:12.040
chapter number two, that Peter says, many shall follow their pernicious ways.

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:16.799
Remember, the Antichrist, or that spirit of Antichrist, we know that there will be an

00:07:16.799 --> 00:07:21.640
Antichrist, but the spirit of Antichrist is already working, and we find that the attack

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:27.839
of the enemy, the desire of the enemy, is to blind people from truth, to keep them in

00:07:27.839 --> 00:07:28.839
darkness.

00:07:29.079 --> 00:07:32.679
That's 2 Corinthians chapter number four, and there are many that would follow their

00:07:32.679 --> 00:07:33.679
pernicious ways.

00:07:33.679 --> 00:07:35.119
Notice the end of verse number two.

00:07:35.119 --> 00:07:41.920
By reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of, and through covetousness shall

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:48.160
they with feigned words make merchandise of you, whose judgment now of a long time lingereth

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:52.239
not, and their damnation slumbereth not.

00:07:52.239 --> 00:07:57.720
What John is recognizing here in 1 John 4, in verse number four, when he makes the statement

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:04.799
and have overcome them, them as the false teachers, and he's saying, listen, I've written

00:08:04.799 --> 00:08:10.000
this to you and I'm writing this to you and I'm encouraging and exhorting you to not believe

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.160
every spirit, to try the spirits, to be aware of the false teachers, to understand their

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:20.359
activity and their desire, but I'm rejoicing because why?

00:08:20.359 --> 00:08:22.320
You have overcome them.

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:24.000
You've not been led astray.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.779
You've not been deceived.

00:08:25.779 --> 00:08:30.500
Listen to the truth of Ephesians 4, in verse number 14, when Paul is writing to the church

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:36.419
in Ephesus and he's speaking there to these believers about those that were tossed to

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:37.500
and fro.

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:42.460
He says this in verse 14, that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:47.859
carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slight of men and cunning craftiness.

00:08:47.859 --> 00:08:53.659
Notice what he says, whereby they lay in wait to deceive.

00:08:53.659 --> 00:08:58.500
Notice that John is writing to, he says that you've overcome them.

00:08:58.500 --> 00:08:59.539
You've not been deceived.

00:08:59.539 --> 00:09:01.820
It doesn't mean that you will never be deceived.

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:04.780
I believe that as he's writing to them, he's saying you've not been deceived.

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:07.500
Listen, I don't like being deceived.

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:08.780
Do you?

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:09.940
I do not like being deceived.

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:11.799
I don't like being lied to.

00:09:11.799 --> 00:09:12.799
Just tell me the truth.

00:09:12.799 --> 00:09:13.799
Amen?

00:09:13.799 --> 00:09:14.799
Are you that way too?

00:09:14.799 --> 00:09:15.799
Just tell me the truth.

00:09:15.799 --> 00:09:18.059
Eventually, it's going to be found out anyway, right?

00:09:18.059 --> 00:09:19.059
Just tell me the truth.

00:09:19.059 --> 00:09:20.059
Don't lie to me.

00:09:20.059 --> 00:09:21.059
Don't deceive me.

00:09:21.059 --> 00:09:22.059
I don't want to be deceived.

00:09:22.059 --> 00:09:23.780
He wants to deceive.

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:27.260
He's a liar, John 8, the father of it, right?

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:32.940
And we find that here as we look at the text of Scripture, that John is recognizing that

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:34.419
they've overcome them.

00:09:34.419 --> 00:09:35.900
They've not been led astray.

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:37.059
They've not been deceived.

00:09:37.059 --> 00:09:38.340
They've not been seduced.

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:45.260
In 1 John 2, in verse 26, he says of these false teachers, these many antichrists that

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:50.619
he refers to in verse 18 of 1 John 2, in verse 26, he says, these things have I written

00:09:50.619 --> 00:09:53.940
unto you concerning them that seduce you.

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:55.619
That is their desire.

00:09:55.619 --> 00:09:59.859
That is what they desire to do.

00:09:59.859 --> 00:10:04.559
teachers still exist, their false teaching is still prevalent in the society in which

00:10:04.559 --> 00:10:10.079
we live this morning, it's so necessary that we as the people of God guard against

00:10:10.079 --> 00:10:17.079
and are aware of false teaching that is prevalent, and that we know this book, that we study

00:10:17.079 --> 00:10:22.679
to show ourselves approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing

00:10:22.679 --> 00:10:28.439
the word of truth, that we search the Scriptures, that we know the Scriptures, that we are solid

00:10:28.439 --> 00:10:35.959
and grounded, and we find that John is saying, you've overcome them, these believers, they

00:10:35.959 --> 00:10:44.199
had been victorious, it was not because there were no false teachers, it was because they

00:10:44.199 --> 00:10:50.679
were walking in truth, it was because they had followed the instruction that had been

00:10:50.679 --> 00:10:58.679
given, the existence of false teachers this morning does not guarantee their triumph,

00:10:58.679 --> 00:11:03.719
and I'm thankful for that. Listen, there are false teachers that exist, but their existence

00:11:03.719 --> 00:11:11.959
does not guarantee their triumph. We can be victorious. We can look at this passage of

00:11:11.959 --> 00:11:17.879
Scripture and we can find that John is recognizing, he says to these believers, ye are of God,

00:11:17.879 --> 00:11:28.759
my little children, and have overcome them. What a joy. No doubt as John would write under

00:11:28.759 --> 00:11:34.599
the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God, and as he would give this truth to these believers

00:11:34.599 --> 00:11:39.479
and he would recognize that they had overcome, I'm mindful of the statement in 3 John in

00:11:39.479 --> 00:11:45.559
verse number 4 when it says, I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in

00:11:45.559 --> 00:11:52.679
truth. No greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth. Listen, John was not

00:11:52.679 --> 00:11:58.919
going to eradicate the false teachers. Amen? He wasn't going to eradicate them by himself,

00:11:58.919 --> 00:12:04.359
but what he could do is he could give instruction, and he could give warning. We find that God

00:12:04.359 --> 00:12:08.679
has given us the instruction and the warning and he's, yes, the false teachers exist,

00:12:08.679 --> 00:12:13.239
he told us, he made us aware of the fact, as we read in 2 Peter chapter number 2, Peter

00:12:13.239 --> 00:12:19.719
says, listen, there were false prophets and there will be false teachers. But what do we do about

00:12:19.719 --> 00:12:24.999
that? Do we just lay down and let them have victory? No, no, their existence does not guarantee

00:12:24.999 --> 00:12:31.879
their triumph. As we look at the text of Scripture, we notice what is recognized, but I notice

00:12:31.879 --> 00:12:38.199
how these believers are reminded. They're reminded of great truth. As we finish up the fourth verse

00:12:38.199 --> 00:12:42.599
of Scripture, we find that the Word of God continues. Notice in verse 4, it says, you're of

00:12:42.599 --> 00:12:47.639
God, little children, and have overcome them. And I want you to notice that next word, because

00:12:49.159 --> 00:12:53.959
that word is important. For we find that John, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

00:12:53.959 --> 00:13:00.359
is going to remind these believers why it was that they had overcome these false teachers,

00:13:00.359 --> 00:13:05.959
that he was going to remind them, these people, these recipients of this letter for us this

00:13:05.959 --> 00:13:10.919
morning as it's been preserved for us and we are so thankful for the truth of the preservation of

00:13:10.919 --> 00:13:17.879
Scripture, it is necessary for us as the people of God to be reminded of some things. In fact,

00:13:17.879 --> 00:13:23.319
Paul would tell Timothy that what makes you a good minister is if you remind the believers,

00:13:23.319 --> 00:13:28.439
those that you're ministering to. Peter says it this way, I'm going to stir up your minds by

00:13:28.439 --> 00:13:34.599
putting you in remembrance. Though you know these things, these are not new things to you, you know

00:13:34.599 --> 00:13:39.719
them, but I'm going to remind you. How many times do we find that in the Old Testament, the people

00:13:39.719 --> 00:13:47.639
of God, they simply forgot. They forgot, they need to be reminded. The psalmist in Psalm 119 says,

00:13:47.639 --> 00:13:54.439
I will not forget. Think about the depth of that statement and how if we're going to make such a

00:13:54.439 --> 00:13:59.319
statement that I'm not going to forget, we better be in this book and we better be receiving it

00:13:59.319 --> 00:14:04.999
regularly and continually. Why? So that we do not forget. And we find that John, under the

00:14:04.999 --> 00:14:09.239
inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God, was going to remind the people of God. What was it that he

00:14:09.239 --> 00:14:14.199
was going to remind them? He was going to remind them that the victory that they had experienced

00:14:14.199 --> 00:14:21.239
was not a result of themselves. The victory that they were enjoying, the victory that they had over

00:14:21.239 --> 00:14:27.479
these false teachers was not about themselves, it was about the one living in them. And we need to

00:14:27.479 --> 00:14:34.039
be reminded of that this morning because the Bible says, year of God, little children, and have

00:14:34.039 --> 00:14:45.799
overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world. What was it that

00:14:45.799 --> 00:14:51.479
caused these people to triumph, that caused them for John to be able to say that you've overcome

00:14:51.479 --> 00:14:58.119
them, the because is given, the reason is revealed to us, and John is reminding them it's because the

00:14:58.119 --> 00:15:05.719
one within you is greater than the one that's without. The enemy, the spirit of error that is

00:15:05.719 --> 00:15:11.479
mentioned at the end of verse number six, we find that I'm so thankful that he is the one that's

00:15:11.479 --> 00:15:16.839
within me, the Holy Spirit of God, the Spirit of Truth, the Comforter, that he indwells every

00:15:16.839 --> 00:15:22.279
believer at the moment of salvation, and he is the third person of the Godhead. He is God,

00:15:22.279 --> 00:15:28.599
and the Bible says that he indwells us, and because of the indwelling Holy Spirit of God,

00:15:28.599 --> 00:15:34.599
and because of the abiding of the Word of God within us, we can have the victory,

00:15:34.599 --> 00:15:42.519
and we can understand, listen, it's not about us. It's about Christ in us, the hope of glory.

00:15:43.159 --> 00:15:47.000
Notice what was said in 1 John chapter 2. Turn back, if you will, just a page or two,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.359
and I want you to notice in verses 12 through 14, as John is writing to these believers,

00:15:52.359 --> 00:15:58.599
and notice what he says in verse number 12 of 1 John chapter number 2. He says this,

00:15:58.599 --> 00:16:03.000
I write unto you little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake.

00:16:03.799 --> 00:16:09.000
Isn't it wonderful to know that you've been forgiven? I mention as I preach through this

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.799
passage of Scripture in 1 John chapter number 2, that when we first get saved, really the only

00:16:13.799 --> 00:16:18.519
thing I really understood was that I was forgiven. I didn't understand all that I understand today

00:16:18.519 --> 00:16:23.159
about salvation and all that God did for me at that moment of salvation, but I understood that

00:16:23.159 --> 00:16:28.519
he promised to forgive me. He promised to save me. It continues, I write unto you fathers,

00:16:28.519 --> 00:16:32.359
because you have known him that is from the beginning. I write unto you young men, because

00:16:32.359 --> 00:16:36.519
you have overcome the wicked one. I write unto you little children, because you have known the

00:16:36.519 --> 00:16:41.319
Father. Notice in verse number 14, I have written unto you fathers, because you have known him that

00:16:41.319 --> 00:16:45.000
is from the beginning. I have written unto you young men, notice this, because you're strong,

00:16:45.719 --> 00:16:52.359
and the word of God abideth in you, and you have overcome the wicked one. He was not speaking about

00:16:52.359 --> 00:16:57.000
a physical strength in verse number 14. He was speaking about a spiritual strength. He was not

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.359
saying that they had overcome the wicked one because of some physical strength, because of

00:17:02.359 --> 00:17:07.799
some time spent in a gym by following some protocol. No, he says that you've overcome.

00:17:07.799 --> 00:17:15.239
You're strong. Why? Because the word of God abideth in you. Be strong in the Lord, the power of his

00:17:15.239 --> 00:17:20.199
might. That's what Paul says to the believers in Ephesus in Ephesians chapter number six.

00:17:20.199 --> 00:17:26.679
We think about that spiritual strength. There's such an emphasis and such a focus in our society

00:17:26.679 --> 00:17:34.679
in which we live of the physical. There's so much time invested in the physical realm, and

00:17:34.679 --> 00:17:40.359
dealing with physical strength, and physical stature, and so on and so forth, and having that

00:17:40.359 --> 00:17:44.759
strength. And I understand it, and I see where we are in our society, but the reality is that the

00:17:44.759 --> 00:17:50.039
people of God… Listen, the Bible says bodily exercise profiteth little. There is a profit to

00:17:50.039 --> 00:17:56.359
bodily exercise. But I want you to understand this morning that we must make it serious,

00:17:56.359 --> 00:18:03.000
and we must make a priority of our spiritual strength. There is no way that any child of

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:08.279
God should spend more time at a gym working on their physique than they do working on their

00:18:08.279 --> 00:18:15.959
spiritual strength. Amen? Come on. Help me this morning. Seriously. I'm for it. I've been trying

00:18:16.679 --> 00:18:21.319
to take care of some things physically, but the reality is that if I spend more time at the gym

00:18:21.319 --> 00:18:28.919
physically and less time in God's Word, that's not going to profit me. Amen? And we must understand

00:18:28.919 --> 00:18:34.760
this morning there are people that would never miss a day working out physically but think nothing

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:41.000
about skipping reading the Bible. Think nothing about skipping church. Think nothing about… Do

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.479
you understand what I'm saying this morning? Listen, that's when we become overcome

00:18:47.479 --> 00:18:53.239
because we're not strong spiritually. Physical strength is not what wins the battle in a

00:18:53.239 --> 00:19:01.479
spiritual battle. We wrestle not against flesh and blood but against spiritual wickedness in high

00:19:01.479 --> 00:19:12.279
places. The weapons of our warfare are not carnal. They're spiritual. The pulling down of

00:19:12.279 --> 00:19:19.640
strongholds. This morning as we think about this truth and we understand what these believers are

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:24.039
being reminded of, I'm thankful that John recognized that they have overcome them,

00:19:24.039 --> 00:19:29.479
but understand this morning that just because they had victory at that moment does not mean

00:19:29.479 --> 00:19:33.479
that the enemy, that the false teacher, is going to pack up and go somewhere else.

00:19:34.279 --> 00:19:38.519
They're just going to try to come in a different door. They're just going to kind of come… Do you

00:19:38.519 --> 00:19:44.839
understand what I'm saying this morning? Because the false teachers, they are persistent. Our enemy

00:19:44.839 --> 00:19:50.119
is relentless. You read in the Old Testament about the way in which the enemy worked against

00:19:50.119 --> 00:19:55.719
the children of Israel. You read about how the enemy tried to destroy the Messianic line,

00:19:55.719 --> 00:19:59.719
and you read all of those instances. You understand. Listen, it's not just that Haman…

00:19:59.719 --> 00:20:02.479
hated Mordecai.

00:20:02.479 --> 00:20:05.659
If we're not careful, we read the book of Esther and we just think it's about some guy

00:20:05.659 --> 00:20:08.479
that hated some other guy.

00:20:08.479 --> 00:20:13.159
But it was Satan that was influencing Haman to destroy all of the Jews.

00:20:13.159 --> 00:20:14.159
Why?

00:20:14.159 --> 00:20:17.039
So that Messiah couldn't come.

00:20:17.039 --> 00:20:19.659
We see the broader picture.

00:20:19.659 --> 00:20:24.039
We understand the spiritual warfare that we're engaged in.

00:20:24.039 --> 00:20:30.319
And the enemy, we can be victorious today, but if we start thinking about, I was able

00:20:30.319 --> 00:20:36.559
to get that victory, then all of a sudden, what happened to Uzziah when he was strong?

00:20:36.559 --> 00:20:39.839
He was lifted up with pride.

00:20:39.839 --> 00:20:48.119
The Bible says this of Uzziah, that he was marvelously helped till he was strong.

00:20:48.119 --> 00:20:51.799
I want you to think about that statement.

00:20:51.799 --> 00:20:56.279
He was marvelously helped till he was strong.

00:20:56.279 --> 00:21:01.119
Oh, that God would help us to recognize that we need Him.

00:21:01.119 --> 00:21:02.979
We need Him.

00:21:02.979 --> 00:21:06.279
We sang this morning, stand up, stand up for Jesus.

00:21:06.279 --> 00:21:11.099
The songwriter said in that song, the arm of flesh will fail you.

00:21:11.099 --> 00:21:13.719
We sang it this morning.

00:21:13.719 --> 00:21:19.619
And we find that here as we look at this truth, the believers that John is writing to, he

00:21:19.619 --> 00:21:23.579
says to them in the second chapter, you are strong and you have overcome.

00:21:23.579 --> 00:21:24.579
Why?

00:21:24.579 --> 00:21:26.259
Because the Word of God abideth in you.

00:21:26.259 --> 00:21:31.019
In the third chapter, in verse number 24, John reminded them at the end of the verse,

00:21:31.019 --> 00:21:35.419
and hereby we know that He abideth in us by the Spirit which He hath given us.

00:21:35.419 --> 00:21:38.699
And so we have the Spirit of God that indwells us.

00:21:38.699 --> 00:21:44.379
We have the Word of God that is to be within us.

00:21:44.379 --> 00:21:49.939
And we must be reminded this morning that if we are going to overcome them, it is going

00:21:49.939 --> 00:21:52.859
to be because of those two things.

00:21:52.859 --> 00:21:56.339
Because of the Spirit of God and the Word of God.

00:21:56.339 --> 00:22:01.719
This morning, we must see that here in verses 5 and 6, He gives us the contrast.

00:22:01.719 --> 00:22:04.299
He speaks about they and we.

00:22:04.299 --> 00:22:10.419
In verse number 5, He says, they are of the world, therefore speak they of the world and

00:22:10.419 --> 00:22:12.899
the world heareth them.

00:22:12.899 --> 00:22:17.379
They're of the world.

00:22:17.379 --> 00:22:20.659
But we, we are of God.

00:22:20.659 --> 00:22:22.259
We are of God.

00:22:22.259 --> 00:22:25.379
And he that knoweth God heareth us.

00:22:25.379 --> 00:22:28.019
He that is not of God heareth not us.

00:22:28.019 --> 00:22:35.859
Hereby, by this, know we the Spirit of truth and the Spirit of error.

00:22:35.859 --> 00:22:41.179
This is a serious situation for these believers in the first century, but it continues to

00:22:41.179 --> 00:22:44.219
be a serious situation for us today.

00:22:44.219 --> 00:22:51.739
As I mentioned several weeks ago, false teaching is so prevalent in our society.

00:22:51.739 --> 00:22:56.539
It's not that false teaching is more prevalent today perhaps than it's ever been, but I would

00:22:56.539 --> 00:23:00.099
say it this way, it's more available.

00:23:00.099 --> 00:23:04.139
It's more at your fingertips right now than it ever has been.

00:23:04.139 --> 00:23:09.539
Listen, technology, if used properly, is a wonderful thing.

00:23:09.539 --> 00:23:12.659
But I'm going to tell you this morning that you get on that computer and you start typing

00:23:12.659 --> 00:23:19.699
stuff in Google, and Google has their search results and all that they do in providing

00:23:19.699 --> 00:23:23.119
you with some type of response, and I want you to know there's a lot of false teachers

00:23:23.119 --> 00:23:26.139
out there in cyber world.

00:23:26.139 --> 00:23:30.019
They got all kinds of things that they could spin.

00:23:30.019 --> 00:23:35.419
And we must understand this morning that God didn't say to us that we are going to overcome

00:23:35.419 --> 00:23:37.099
Him by a Google search.

00:23:37.099 --> 00:23:38.099
No.

00:23:38.139 --> 00:23:39.139
No.

00:23:39.139 --> 00:23:40.139
By the Word of God.

00:23:40.139 --> 00:23:43.059
Listen, I'm thankful for the theologians that went before us.

00:23:43.059 --> 00:23:47.139
How many of you have ever used a concordance before?

00:23:47.139 --> 00:23:52.259
I'm thankful for a concordance, but you're saying that Strong like sat down and wrote

00:23:52.259 --> 00:23:53.259
all that stuff.

00:23:53.259 --> 00:23:54.259
Can you imagine?

00:23:54.259 --> 00:23:57.659
I'm thankful for his labor.

00:23:57.659 --> 00:24:02.059
Every time I use a Strong's concordance, man, I am thankful for his labor.

00:24:02.059 --> 00:24:05.739
The time, the diligence.

00:24:05.739 --> 00:24:12.179
But I want you to understand, listen, I know many times people reference about commentaries.

00:24:12.179 --> 00:24:15.819
I have commentaries in my office, but I want you to know this morning that the greatest

00:24:15.819 --> 00:24:17.899
commentary on the Bible is the Bible.

00:24:17.899 --> 00:24:23.979
Listen, I need to know the Bible more than I need to know the commentary, because a commentary

00:24:23.979 --> 00:24:28.939
is only going to tell you what some person says about the Scriptures, right?

00:24:28.939 --> 00:24:32.059
And yet we find that God gives us the Word of God.

00:24:32.059 --> 00:24:35.059
I'm not suggesting that you should not have any commentary.

00:24:35.059 --> 00:24:38.899
I'm just suggesting that you ought to get into the Word of God.

00:24:38.899 --> 00:24:45.099
We ought to pray and ask God, teach us thy Word, lead me into truth, help me to understand

00:24:45.099 --> 00:24:46.099
this.

00:24:46.099 --> 00:24:49.859
But what happens with things being so readily available, sometimes we just rush and let

00:24:49.859 --> 00:24:55.619
somebody else's labor in their work kind of take care of our answer, our question, what

00:24:55.619 --> 00:24:56.619
have you.

00:24:56.619 --> 00:25:01.059
But the reality this morning is that we need to know the Word of God.

00:25:01.059 --> 00:25:03.299
And John is reminding these believers.

00:25:03.299 --> 00:25:06.819
He recognizes that they had been victorious.

00:25:06.819 --> 00:25:14.139
He recognizes that they had overcome them, but he reminds them, let me remind you why

00:25:14.139 --> 00:25:15.859
you have victory.

00:25:15.859 --> 00:25:19.019
Let me remind you why you overcame them.

00:25:19.019 --> 00:25:27.579
It's because greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world.

00:25:27.579 --> 00:25:33.059
This recognition and reminder leads me to a third thought this morning.

00:25:33.059 --> 00:25:38.659
And that is this, that we should consider how we should rejoice this morning.

00:25:38.659 --> 00:25:45.899
The existence of false teachers, the activity of Satan should not cause the people of God

00:25:45.899 --> 00:25:50.859
to fret, nor should it cause us to live in discouragement.

00:25:50.859 --> 00:25:53.179
Why?

00:25:53.179 --> 00:25:54.279
Why would we fret?

00:25:54.279 --> 00:25:57.419
Why would we live in discouragement?

00:25:58.259 --> 00:26:03.539
And this morning, as we think about the truth that God has given us, the reminder in this

00:26:03.539 --> 00:26:07.659
passage of Scripture, it starts with this two-fold exhortation.

00:26:07.659 --> 00:26:13.659
But we find that there's a group of believers that had been victorious, and John is reminding

00:26:13.659 --> 00:26:15.339
them why they had victory.

00:26:15.339 --> 00:26:19.979
And for us this morning, we find that even as these people should have rejoiced, that

00:26:19.979 --> 00:26:25.979
we too should rejoice in knowing that the activity and the existence of these false

00:26:25.979 --> 00:26:30.479
teachers, it should not cause us to wave some white flag of surrender.

00:26:30.479 --> 00:26:33.219
It should not cause us to live in discouragement.

00:26:33.219 --> 00:26:36.979
It should not cause us to say, well, I can't engage anybody with the Bible because I'm

00:26:36.979 --> 00:26:39.099
just not going to be able to answer their questions.

00:26:39.099 --> 00:26:40.099
No!

00:26:40.099 --> 00:26:43.019
We have truth.

00:26:43.019 --> 00:26:46.019
And truth is powerful.

00:26:46.019 --> 00:26:47.599
And we must not fret.

00:26:47.599 --> 00:26:50.139
We must not live lives of discouragement.

00:26:50.139 --> 00:26:54.539
We must not go hide somewhere and say, even so, come Lord Jesus.

00:26:54.539 --> 00:26:57.419
Listen, I want Jesus to come.

00:26:57.419 --> 00:26:58.419
I'm ready.

00:26:58.419 --> 00:26:59.899
I'm listening for the trumpet.

00:26:59.899 --> 00:27:00.899
Amen?

00:27:00.899 --> 00:27:04.659
Tim was playing the trumpet over here this morning when I'm over in Sunday school, and

00:27:04.659 --> 00:27:08.699
he was just kind of warming up, and I'm like, one day, we're going to hear that for real.

00:27:08.699 --> 00:27:09.699
Amen?

00:27:09.699 --> 00:27:12.099
And listen, the trumpet of God is going to sound.

00:27:12.099 --> 00:27:18.559
The dead in Christ shall rise, and we are going to be with Jesus forevermore.

00:27:18.559 --> 00:27:23.179
But I want you to understand that right now, we look at all of the society in which we're

00:27:23.179 --> 00:27:28.139
living and we look at the false teaching and we hear of these false prophets and we

00:27:28.139 --> 00:27:30.779
read of their peddling of their doctrine.

00:27:30.779 --> 00:27:36.179
Listen, they have more courage and they have more wherewithal to go out and peddle their

00:27:36.179 --> 00:27:41.659
false doctrine than most of God's people do to peddle the truth.

00:27:41.659 --> 00:27:43.379
Right?

00:27:43.379 --> 00:27:46.219
It's sad.

00:27:46.219 --> 00:27:50.819
The existence of false teachers should not cause us to be discouraged.

00:27:50.819 --> 00:27:53.779
I shouldn't sit over in a corner and just wring my hands, what are we going to do with

00:27:53.779 --> 00:27:55.659
these false teachers?

00:27:55.659 --> 00:27:59.059
No, God gave us truth.

00:27:59.059 --> 00:28:05.659
We're not prideful about it, we're not arrogant about it, we're not self-sufficient with regard

00:28:05.659 --> 00:28:06.659
to that.

00:28:06.659 --> 00:28:07.659
No, we're Christ-dependent.

00:28:07.659 --> 00:28:10.099
So, we have the truth.

00:28:10.099 --> 00:28:13.139
I don't have to fear.

00:28:13.139 --> 00:28:17.459
Sometimes we get all kinds of worked up over, well, they have a degree in this and they

00:28:17.459 --> 00:28:20.619
have a degree in that, and I'm not going to be able to answer their question, and they

00:28:20.619 --> 00:28:28.259
can use words that I never even heard of before, and just give the Bible.

00:28:28.259 --> 00:28:33.019
Notice in 1 Corinthians, I was going to turn here, but go over to 1 Corinthians just quickly.

00:28:33.019 --> 00:28:36.099
By the way, Romans chapter number 1 says, professing themselves to be wise, they became

00:28:36.099 --> 00:28:38.859
fools.

00:28:38.859 --> 00:28:52.219
Notice in 1 Corinthians chapter number 1, notice the Bible says this in verse number

00:28:52.219 --> 00:28:56.459
18, for the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness, but unto us which

00:28:56.459 --> 00:29:00.659
are saved it is the power of God.

00:29:00.659 --> 00:29:05.059
Verse number 23, we preach Christ crucified unto the Jews, the stumbling block, unto the

00:29:05.059 --> 00:29:09.419
Greeks foolishness, but unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ, the

00:29:09.419 --> 00:29:11.579
power of God and the wisdom of God.

00:29:11.579 --> 00:29:12.579
Why?

00:29:12.579 --> 00:29:21.539
Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than

00:29:21.539 --> 00:29:23.739
men.

00:29:23.739 --> 00:29:28.500
Look at verse number 26, for you see your calling brethren, how that not many wise men

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:33.099
after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble are called, but God hath chosen the

00:29:33.139 --> 00:29:37.739
foolish things of the world to confound the wise, and God hath chosen the weak things

00:29:37.739 --> 00:29:41.579
of the world to confound the things which are mighty, and base things of the world and

00:29:41.579 --> 00:29:46.139
things which are despised hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not to bring to

00:29:46.139 --> 00:29:53.659
naught things that are, why, that no flesh should glory in his presence.

00:29:53.659 --> 00:29:57.219
Our sufficiency is of Christ.

00:29:57.219 --> 00:29:59.779
We find that he says, but of him, in verse number.

00:29:59.779 --> 00:30:05.159
30, are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God has made unto us wisdom and righteousness and

00:30:05.159 --> 00:30:10.839
sanctification and redemption, that according as it is written, he that glorieth, let him

00:30:10.839 --> 00:30:14.519
glory in the Lord."

00:30:14.519 --> 00:30:17.679
You know what God said in James 1?

00:30:17.679 --> 00:30:23.479
If any man lack wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth all men liberally and upbraideth

00:30:23.479 --> 00:30:24.479
not.

00:30:24.479 --> 00:30:27.719
Listen, He's going to give us real wisdom.

00:30:27.719 --> 00:30:32.119
He is the all-wise God, omniscience.

00:30:32.119 --> 00:30:37.519
And He says, as the all-wise God, He says, hey, if you lack wisdom, you just ask me and

00:30:37.519 --> 00:30:38.519
I'll give you wisdom.

00:30:38.519 --> 00:30:40.519
Isn't that wonderful?

00:30:40.519 --> 00:30:44.799
There's a contrast in the second chapter of the book of 1 Corinthians in verses 6 and

00:30:44.799 --> 00:30:47.239
7 between worldly wisdom and godly wisdom.

00:30:47.239 --> 00:30:49.479
Notice what it says in verse number 6.

00:30:49.479 --> 00:30:54.679
It says, how be it we speak wisdom among them that are perfect, yet not the wisdom of this

00:30:54.679 --> 00:31:00.719
world, nor of the princes of this world that come to nought, but we speak the wisdom of

00:31:00.719 --> 00:31:08.319
God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our

00:31:08.319 --> 00:31:10.039
glory.

00:31:10.039 --> 00:31:14.519
This morning, we should rejoice in having truth.

00:31:14.519 --> 00:31:19.359
We should rejoice in the fact that greater is He that is in me than he that is in the

00:31:19.359 --> 00:31:20.359
world.

00:31:20.359 --> 00:31:22.479
The Holy Spirit of God indwells me.

00:31:22.479 --> 00:31:24.159
He guides me into all truth.

00:31:24.159 --> 00:31:25.319
He enables me.

00:31:25.319 --> 00:31:26.519
He is greater.

00:31:26.519 --> 00:31:33.079
We find this morning that we are more than conquerors, that we are on the winning side.

00:31:33.079 --> 00:31:38.319
And so often when we think about false teaching and we think about all of these cults and

00:31:38.319 --> 00:31:43.639
isms and so on and so forth, we can get all kinds of sideways and begin to think, how

00:31:43.639 --> 00:31:45.339
can I answer their questions?

00:31:45.339 --> 00:31:50.039
How can I engage in conversation?

00:31:50.039 --> 00:31:59.799
Let us not be discouraged, but let us rejoice because we know God, and God is able to give

00:31:59.799 --> 00:32:02.039
us the victory.

00:32:02.039 --> 00:32:07.719
God has equipped us as we look to the Word of God, as we take the truth of God's Word

00:32:07.719 --> 00:32:13.719
and we see those that are going around and giving these false doctrines and these false

00:32:13.719 --> 00:32:20.079
teachings, we find this morning that we have the truth.

00:32:20.079 --> 00:32:25.119
By the truth, the Word of God tells us in the book of Proverbs, sell it not.

00:32:25.119 --> 00:32:34.479
And this morning, as I think about those that would be identified as being false teachers,

00:32:34.479 --> 00:32:41.839
those cults that we have in our own land, we think about how they go around with great

00:32:41.959 --> 00:32:48.359
confidence, teaching their false doctrine.

00:32:48.359 --> 00:32:54.599
And yet for some reason, we as Christians, sometimes we just kind of keep our mouth shut.

00:32:54.599 --> 00:32:56.719
What are we going to say?

00:32:56.719 --> 00:32:57.719
How are we going to respond?

00:32:57.719 --> 00:32:58.719
What are we going to do?

00:32:58.719 --> 00:32:59.719
We have truth.

00:32:59.719 --> 00:33:09.399
You understand this morning that I believe that some of the most dangerous false teaching

00:33:09.399 --> 00:33:15.479
that exists today is that of humanism, Darwinian evolution.

00:33:15.479 --> 00:33:22.839
If you think about humanism, listen, they actually of themselves, if you look at their

00:33:22.839 --> 00:33:30.799
writings and such, they consider humanism a religion.

00:33:30.799 --> 00:33:40.719
We find this morning that these humanists, that they try to bring God down, exalt man.

00:33:40.719 --> 00:33:44.719
And you think about humanism, and you think about Darwinian evolution, and we think about

00:33:44.719 --> 00:33:46.119
those things that are being dealt with.

00:33:46.119 --> 00:33:51.739
Think about what our children are being taught in school today.

00:33:51.739 --> 00:34:02.939
Think about how they're taking and just twisting such basic revealed truth that is just naturally…I

00:34:02.939 --> 00:34:11.819
mean the natural man can understand some of the basic truth, and yet they twist it.

00:34:11.819 --> 00:34:20.539
They're teaching a false teaching, these false teachers, they're peddling their false doctrine.

00:34:20.539 --> 00:34:24.299
They're denying the existence of God.

00:34:24.299 --> 00:34:32.299
They're turning the grace of God into lasciviousness, and they're doing it boldly.

00:34:32.299 --> 00:34:35.979
They're doing it boldly.

00:34:35.979 --> 00:34:36.979
They're standing up.

00:34:36.979 --> 00:34:41.339
And sometimes, have you listened to people in recent days?

00:34:41.339 --> 00:34:45.099
And here's something that I listen to some of these people in recent days, and I'm like

00:34:45.099 --> 00:34:48.139
surely they did not hear what they just said.

00:34:48.139 --> 00:34:50.339
Have you thought that way too?

00:34:50.339 --> 00:34:59.619
There's no way their ears just heard what came out of their mouth.

00:34:59.619 --> 00:35:05.179
God's turned them over to a reprobate mind, according to Romans 1.

00:35:05.179 --> 00:35:11.499
But they're giving that false teaching, and they're giving it with boldness.

00:35:11.499 --> 00:35:15.259
They're corrupting a future generation.

00:35:15.259 --> 00:35:26.459
Some of the most basic things of life, of biology, right?

00:35:26.459 --> 00:35:27.979
Simple stuff.

00:35:27.979 --> 00:35:35.339
We're not going to call a mother a mother anymore, it's going to be a birthing parent?

00:35:35.339 --> 00:35:38.899
What?

00:35:38.899 --> 00:35:41.939
I'm not going to keep going down the path, but you understand what we're dealing with

00:35:41.939 --> 00:35:42.939
today.

00:35:42.939 --> 00:35:45.659
And they are corrupting the minds of young people.

00:35:45.659 --> 00:35:48.979
But I want you to understand what their objective is.

00:35:48.979 --> 00:35:55.139
Their endgame objective is that they can deny the existence of God.

00:35:55.139 --> 00:35:58.099
That's where it ends.

00:35:58.099 --> 00:36:01.379
This is not just, well, you know, we're going to agree to disagree and let them just kind

00:36:01.379 --> 00:36:02.379
of...

00:36:02.379 --> 00:36:03.379
No.

00:36:03.379 --> 00:36:05.059
They have an endgame.

00:36:05.059 --> 00:36:09.979
And their endgame is denying the existence of God, and if they can be successful in that,

00:36:09.979 --> 00:36:14.619
if they can teach these young people that there's no God, there's no authority, then

00:36:14.619 --> 00:36:15.619
guess what?

00:36:15.619 --> 00:36:17.759
First of all, people aren't going to get saved, and it's just going to get worse and worse

00:36:17.759 --> 00:36:18.759
and worse.

00:36:18.759 --> 00:36:19.759
Right?

00:36:19.759 --> 00:36:21.819
Denying the existence of God.

00:36:21.819 --> 00:36:26.179
If there's no God, then I become my own authority, right?

00:36:26.179 --> 00:36:29.899
There's no God, I don't need a Savior, God didn't create...

00:36:29.899 --> 00:36:34.019
Why do you think evolution has such a primary place in our society today?

00:36:34.019 --> 00:36:37.059
They want to deny the existence of God.

00:36:37.059 --> 00:36:42.779
God didn't create, so we take away the truth of Genesis, and then it undermines the entirety

00:36:42.779 --> 00:36:44.499
of God's Word.

00:36:44.499 --> 00:36:49.539
If God is not the Creator, if God did not create you, if Adam did not sin, if we are

00:36:49.539 --> 00:36:53.419
not born with a sin nature, you don't need a Redeemer.

00:36:53.419 --> 00:36:55.359
That's the endgame.

00:36:55.359 --> 00:36:57.939
But my Bible tells me that God is the Creator.

00:36:57.939 --> 00:37:01.099
My Bible tells me that He created everything out of nothing.

00:37:01.099 --> 00:37:02.239
Amen?

00:37:02.239 --> 00:37:08.119
My God tells me that Adam was put into a perfect place, a perfect environment, and

00:37:08.119 --> 00:37:16.199
he was given the instruction from God, and he and Eve, of course, they broke the commandment

00:37:16.199 --> 00:37:21.639
that God had given, and we find that sin entered into the world.

00:37:21.639 --> 00:37:27.519
But God knew it, because before the foundation of the world, Jesus is the Lamb of God that

00:37:27.519 --> 00:37:29.719
is slain before the foundation of the world.

00:37:30.199 --> 00:37:33.639
Thus, John the Baptist is able to see as Jesus comes on the scene, and he says,

00:37:33.639 --> 00:37:38.039
Behold, the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.

00:37:38.039 --> 00:37:43.359
The one that's been prophesied of, the one that the prophets speak of, He has now come.

00:37:43.359 --> 00:37:48.679
This morning, we must rejoice in knowing the truth, and we must not think that we have

00:37:48.679 --> 00:37:51.159
to hide in a corner.

00:37:51.159 --> 00:37:57.159
That we have to, it's kind of interesting, we live in a society today that preaches tolerance,

00:37:57.159 --> 00:38:03.599
but they're the most intolerant group of people.

00:38:03.599 --> 00:38:06.639
I would say as Bible-believing Christians that we're tolerant people.

00:38:06.639 --> 00:38:07.639
Why?

00:38:07.639 --> 00:38:11.519
You can believe whatever you want to believe, but you're accountable for it.

00:38:11.519 --> 00:38:13.359
You believe there's no God?

00:38:13.359 --> 00:38:15.439
That's between you and God.

00:38:15.439 --> 00:38:18.079
I'd like to tell you the truth, but you're free to believe it.

00:38:18.079 --> 00:38:22.399
We're not going to make you convert to our belief, but you know what they're trying to

00:38:22.399 --> 00:38:23.399
do?

00:38:23.399 --> 00:38:28.059
They're trying to force their beliefs on you.

00:38:28.059 --> 00:38:29.759
I don't force my belief on anybody.

00:38:29.759 --> 00:38:34.599
If I go and knock on somebody's door, and they say, I'm not interested, I don't stick

00:38:34.599 --> 00:38:40.679
my foot in the door, I don't insist on them listening to me, I say, have a nice day.

00:38:40.679 --> 00:38:43.119
Would you take some time to read this?

00:38:43.119 --> 00:38:49.359
I'm not forcing my belief on anybody, but they want to force their belief on you.

00:38:49.359 --> 00:38:50.359
Think about this.

00:38:50.519 --> 00:38:52.519
Acts, if you will.

00:38:52.519 --> 00:38:53.519
Acts 4.

00:38:53.519 --> 00:39:00.479
I'll close with this this morning.

00:39:00.479 --> 00:39:04.919
We see what John recognized, that they had overcome them.

00:39:04.919 --> 00:39:12.159
We see how John reminded them that their victory was the result of greater is He that is in

00:39:12.159 --> 00:39:15.879
you than he which is in the world.

00:39:15.879 --> 00:39:22.039
They should rejoice, and we should rejoice, and the existence of false teachers does not

00:39:22.039 --> 00:39:23.639
guarantee their triumph.

00:39:23.639 --> 00:39:26.879
In fact, we are more than conquerors.

00:39:26.879 --> 00:39:29.279
We are on the winning side.

00:39:29.279 --> 00:39:33.739
As I mentioned a moment ago, we as the people of God should not fret because of their existence.

00:39:33.739 --> 00:39:36.439
We should not live in discouragement.

00:39:36.439 --> 00:39:41.019
We find that we are to be filled with the Holy Spirit of God, that we are to pray as

00:39:41.019 --> 00:39:42.019
they did.

00:39:42.019 --> 00:39:44.439
I asked you to turn to Acts 4, and I'll be there in just a moment, but we're to pray

00:39:44.759 --> 00:39:50.759
as they prayed that God would give us boldness, and they would speak the Word of God with

00:39:50.759 --> 00:39:51.759
boldness.

00:39:51.759 --> 00:39:55.839
We find it at the end of Acts 4, but I want you to see specifically with what we're dealing

00:39:55.839 --> 00:39:59.839
with as these religious leaders in Acts 4 would call people.

00:39:59.839 --> 00:40:02.159
Peter onto the carpet, so to speak,

00:40:02.159 --> 00:40:04.419
to give answer as to what had taken place

00:40:04.419 --> 00:40:06.399
with the miracle of chapter 3.

00:40:06.399 --> 00:40:08.619
And the Bible says this in v. 7,

00:40:08.619 --> 00:40:11.599
and when they had set them in the midst,

00:40:11.599 --> 00:40:14.559
they asked, by what power or by what name

00:40:14.559 --> 00:40:15.959
have you done this?

00:40:15.959 --> 00:40:18.839
Then Peter, and I want you to notice this statement,

00:40:18.839 --> 00:40:22.899
filled with the Holy Ghost.

00:40:22.899 --> 00:40:24.759
It is absolutely key.

00:40:24.759 --> 00:40:26.759
It is absolutely imperative.

00:40:26.759 --> 00:40:29.039
We read it in Acts 7.

00:40:29.159 --> 00:40:31.359
When you think about Stephen and him preaching

00:40:31.359 --> 00:40:33.199
and before he was martyred,

00:40:33.199 --> 00:40:35.679
it says in v. 55 of Acts 7,

00:40:35.679 --> 00:40:39.159
but he being full of the Holy Ghost.

00:40:39.159 --> 00:40:42.079
Listen, if we're not filled with the Spirit of God,

00:40:42.079 --> 00:40:42.999
we're in trouble.

00:40:44.319 --> 00:40:47.359
But he, Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost,

00:40:47.359 --> 00:40:50.399
said unto them, ye rulers of the people

00:40:50.399 --> 00:40:52.199
and elders of Israel,

00:40:53.159 --> 00:40:56.239
if we this day be examined of the good deed

00:40:56.239 --> 00:40:57.659
done to the impotent man,

00:40:57.659 --> 00:40:59.619
by what means he is made whole,

00:40:59.619 --> 00:41:00.939
be it known unto you all,

00:41:00.939 --> 00:41:02.819
and to all the people of Israel,

00:41:02.819 --> 00:41:06.019
that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth,

00:41:06.019 --> 00:41:07.579
whom ye crucified,

00:41:07.579 --> 00:41:09.419
whom God raised from the dead,

00:41:09.419 --> 00:41:14.059
even by Him doth this man stand here before you whole.

00:41:14.059 --> 00:41:16.419
This is the stone which was set at naught

00:41:16.419 --> 00:41:17.259
of you builders,

00:41:17.259 --> 00:41:20.019
which has become the head of the corner.

00:41:20.019 --> 00:41:22.859
Neither is there salvation in any other.

00:41:22.859 --> 00:41:24.699
For there's none other name under heaven

00:41:24.699 --> 00:41:27.639
given among men whereby we must be saved.

00:41:28.479 --> 00:41:30.719
Now that's a great, great sermon.

00:41:30.719 --> 00:41:33.599
Call it a sermonette, just a few verses, amen?

00:41:33.599 --> 00:41:35.979
He preaches longer sermons later,

00:41:35.979 --> 00:41:38.219
and before, because Acts 2 is a little bit longer too.

00:41:38.219 --> 00:41:39.879
But I want you to notice

00:41:39.879 --> 00:41:42.779
that when he gets done answering their question,

00:41:45.279 --> 00:41:46.759
it says in verse number 13,

00:41:46.759 --> 00:41:51.759
now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John

00:41:52.759 --> 00:41:57.759
and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men,

00:42:00.759 --> 00:42:01.799
they marveled.

00:42:03.759 --> 00:42:05.179
And they took knowledge of them

00:42:05.179 --> 00:42:07.479
and noticed the last statement

00:42:07.479 --> 00:42:11.499
that they had been with Jesus.

00:42:12.759 --> 00:42:16.159
Listen, we don't need to be so worried

00:42:16.159 --> 00:42:19.119
about how am I gonna answer the PhD?

00:42:20.279 --> 00:42:21.359
I don't have a PhD.

00:42:21.919 --> 00:42:22.759
How am I gonna answer them?

00:42:22.759 --> 00:42:26.679
I just need to spend time with Jesus, amen?

00:42:26.679 --> 00:42:28.319
I just need to get in the book.

00:42:29.679 --> 00:42:31.279
We had lunch last week with,

00:42:31.279 --> 00:42:33.379
I'm gonna pick on you just for a minute, Michael.

00:42:33.379 --> 00:42:34.879
We had lunch, is it okay?

00:42:34.879 --> 00:42:36.359
Okay, he said sure.

00:42:36.359 --> 00:42:37.239
No, I'm just kidding.

00:42:37.239 --> 00:42:39.139
So we had lunch with them last Sunday.

00:42:40.119 --> 00:42:41.259
And Michael says,

00:42:43.659 --> 00:42:46.199
now, he asks this question first.

00:42:46.199 --> 00:42:48.399
You guys been reading the Constitution lately?

00:42:48.679 --> 00:42:52.079
Huh, no, not been reading the Constitution lately, sorry.

00:42:52.079 --> 00:42:53.119
He's a lawyer, right?

00:42:53.119 --> 00:42:54.599
So he says, have you read the Constitution lately?

00:42:54.599 --> 00:42:56.039
Nope, haven't read it lately.

00:42:57.239 --> 00:43:00.239
He says, so here's for some Constitution trivia.

00:43:00.239 --> 00:43:01.999
I'm like, are you kidding me, man?

00:43:02.979 --> 00:43:04.879
I lose, can I call a friend?

00:43:04.879 --> 00:43:07.519
Like, what am I gonna do, right?

00:43:07.519 --> 00:43:11.159
And he asks some obscure question

00:43:11.159 --> 00:43:13.439
and then admitted that he had just figured it out

00:43:13.439 --> 00:43:14.839
just recently.

00:43:14.839 --> 00:43:16.559
I'm like, you've been in law school and all this stuff?

00:43:16.559 --> 00:43:20.999
Listen, I'm not gonna try to debate Michael on law.

00:43:22.159 --> 00:43:23.399
I'm never gonna win.

00:43:25.799 --> 00:43:26.779
But as his pastor,

00:43:26.779 --> 00:43:28.879
I better be able to teach him the Word of God.

00:43:30.359 --> 00:43:31.399
Amen?

00:43:31.399 --> 00:43:34.239
Listen, I don't have to go out and fight toe to toe

00:43:34.239 --> 00:43:37.159
with somebody of some false whatever

00:43:37.159 --> 00:43:39.779
and what their level of biology

00:43:39.779 --> 00:43:41.719
and this learning and so on and so forth.

00:43:41.719 --> 00:43:43.519
No, no, I just need to spend time with Jesus

00:43:43.519 --> 00:43:44.419
and with His Word.

00:43:46.599 --> 00:43:47.679
Amen?

00:43:47.679 --> 00:43:50.999
And sometimes we get intimidated.

00:43:50.999 --> 00:43:54.159
If I have to debate Michael in law, I'm intimidated.

00:43:55.119 --> 00:43:56.679
I'm just being honest with you.

00:43:58.879 --> 00:44:00.879
But if we're gonna talk about the Word of God,

00:44:02.439 --> 00:44:05.239
we spend time with Jesus, we search the Scriptures,

00:44:05.239 --> 00:44:07.539
we study to show ourselves approved unto God.

00:44:08.419 --> 00:44:11.479
I don't have all the answers, but I know God does.

00:44:11.479 --> 00:44:12.559
And I'm gonna go to His book

00:44:12.559 --> 00:44:15.359
and I'm gonna be filled with the Spirit of God.

00:44:17.239 --> 00:44:19.479
These guys in Acts 4, they said,

00:44:20.679 --> 00:44:23.559
we perceive that these are unlearned and ignorant men,

00:44:25.999 --> 00:44:27.759
but they've been with Jesus.

00:44:28.799 --> 00:44:32.439
I wonder how many people would be able to say

00:44:33.719 --> 00:44:37.999
when they encounter you, they've been with Jesus.

00:44:38.999 --> 00:44:41.239
They've been with Jesus.

00:44:41.239 --> 00:44:43.879
Oh, that God would help us.

00:44:43.879 --> 00:44:44.999
Listen, this morning,

00:44:45.879 --> 00:44:49.279
the existence of false teachers shouldn't discourage us.

00:44:49.279 --> 00:44:50.979
God told us they're gonna be here.

00:44:51.879 --> 00:44:55.159
He told us how we can expose them and overcome them.

00:44:55.159 --> 00:44:57.939
And we need to simply abide in Him.

00:44:57.939 --> 00:45:01.179
Let this book abide in us.

00:45:01.179 --> 00:45:05.099
Walk in the Spirit, be filled with the Spirit of God,

00:45:05.099 --> 00:45:08.319
and understand and always remember,

00:45:08.319 --> 00:45:13.319
greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world.

00:45:13.799 --> 00:45:15.479
God, I need wisdom.

00:45:15.479 --> 00:45:19.159
He said, yes, child, I will give it to you.

00:45:20.319 --> 00:45:22.959
And I'll give it to you liberally.

00:45:22.959 --> 00:45:23.799
Let's pray.

00:45:23.799 --> 00:45:24.619
Father, we love you.

00:45:25.519 --> 00:45:27.399
Thank you for loving us.

00:45:27.399 --> 00:45:29.799
Thank you for the Word of God.

00:45:29.799 --> 00:45:32.159
I pray this morning that you would help us

00:45:35.679 --> 00:45:39.279
to engage our society, our culture,

00:45:40.399 --> 00:45:42.119
with the truth of thy Word.

00:45:42.879 --> 00:45:45.439
God, we've kept silent for too long.

00:45:45.439 --> 00:45:46.619
Forgive us.

00:45:49.919 --> 00:45:52.359
Though we often quote and refer to the truth

00:45:52.359 --> 00:45:56.279
of 1 John 4, 4, at times, if we'd be honest,

00:45:56.279 --> 00:46:01.279
we don't live like greater is He that is in us

00:46:01.559 --> 00:46:03.059
than he that is in the world.

00:46:04.199 --> 00:46:05.439
God, I pray that you'd help us

00:46:05.439 --> 00:46:07.399
to be filled with the Spirit of God,

00:46:07.399 --> 00:46:11.119
to walk in boldness, to preach thy Word with boldness.

00:46:12.839 --> 00:46:16.759
Help us to engage our culture with the truth of thy Word.

00:46:16.759 --> 00:46:18.499
Give us wisdom, oh God.

00:46:20.759 --> 00:46:23.159
I pray this morning that you'd move and work in hearts

00:46:23.159 --> 00:46:24.239
as only you can.

00:46:25.279 --> 00:46:27.499
Help us to rejoice for the truth.

00:46:29.419 --> 00:46:33.039
Help us to never forget, always remember

00:46:37.479 --> 00:46:40.579
that any victory that we may have is all because of you.

00:46:41.579 --> 00:46:44.059
For greater is he that is in you

00:46:44.059 --> 00:46:45.499
than he that is in the world.

00:46:46.379 --> 00:46:48.539
I pray that you'd move and work, seal every decision,

00:46:48.539 --> 00:46:49.739
and we'll thank you for it.
