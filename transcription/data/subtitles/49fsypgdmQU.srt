1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,679
11 and I'll be looking at verses 23 through 31. I mentioned this morning at the end of the service that we would

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:11,840
be observing the Lord's Supper this evening and it's been a long time since we've observed the Lord's Supper and

3
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:13,439
we

4
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:16,280
Are now going to look at this passage of scripture

5
00:00:16,639 --> 00:00:22,719
Typically as we observe the Lord's Supper, I'll preach a message and then we'll read this passage before we distribute the elements

6
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:28,920
But with it being as long as it has been I thought it appropriate for us to revisit the passage and spend a little bit

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,819
More time just going systematically through the passage of scripture

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,900
We understand as New Testament believers as even as I said this morning

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,400
That the Word of God is the sole authority for our faith in our practice

10
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:47,959
And we believe biblically that the Lord Jesus Christ has given two ordinances to the local church

11
00:00:47,959 --> 00:00:53,000
one is believers baptism by immersion and number two is the Lord's Supper as

12
00:00:53,400 --> 00:01:00,360
You study the scriptures you will find that God has provided us with the instruction for purpose of and

13
00:01:00,959 --> 00:01:08,940
Practice of these two ordinances. I'm thankful that he's given us the truth that we have in his Word with regard to these

14
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:12,339
instructions and the purpose of these

15
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:18,540
Practices if you will and we find it's here in 1st Corinthians chapter 11 that we really have the most detailed

16
00:01:18,699 --> 00:01:20,459
Instruction regarding the Lord's Supper

17
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:26,900
We understand some things about the church in Corinth and they weren't always doing things the way that they were supposed to be doing things

18
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:30,580
We find at the church in Corinth was a church. That was a carnal church

19
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:34,500
It was a divided church and all sorts of things going on

20
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,779
In fact leading up to the text of scripture that we're going to look at this evening

21
00:01:39,779 --> 00:01:42,980
Paul says on two occasions I praise you not and

22
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,660
There were they were doing some things

23
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,099
Not

24
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:51,139
Appropriately and so Paul says I praise you not the way that you're doing it isn't right

25
00:01:51,139 --> 00:01:55,940
So I'm gonna give you instruction and really to me that's a blessing. I'm so thankful for it

26
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,940
You know, it's one thing for someone to come and tell you you're doing something wrong

27
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:03,180
It's another thing for them to give you the instruction on how to get the wrong thing, right?

28
00:02:03,699 --> 00:02:09,419
Amen, you're doing this wrong and then they just walk away and you're like, well, that's wonderful. I'm doing it wrong

29
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:11,419
I don't know how else to do it, right?

30
00:02:11,419 --> 00:02:15,860
But God is faithful to give us the word to give us instruction

31
00:02:16,259 --> 00:02:23,179
And we find here this detailed instruction with regard to observing the Lord's Supper in verse number 23

32
00:02:23,179 --> 00:02:28,139
Notice what the Bible says 1st Corinthians 11 and verse 23 for I have received of the Lord

33
00:02:28,699 --> 00:02:31,460
That which also I delivered unto you

34
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:38,300
and so again as we would be mindful of the truth even that we're dealing with this morning and we'll continue as we look at

35
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,699
the book of Colossians

36
00:02:39,699 --> 00:02:44,820
With this this truth and the source of truth and Paul is saying listen, this isn't just my opinion

37
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:50,300
This didn't originate with me. I've received this from the Lord and I'm delivering it unto you

38
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:57,220
He says this that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks

39
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,220
He break it and said take eat

40
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:05,559
This is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me

41
00:03:06,559 --> 00:03:12,600
After the same manner also he took the cup when he had sup saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do

42
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:18,639
Ye as oft as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup

43
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:21,080
You do show the Lord's death till he come

44
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,759
Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord

45
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:34,759
unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord, but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread

46
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:41,360
And drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not

47
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:47,399
Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep

48
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:54,279
For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged if you're taking notes and you've seen in the bulletin as well

49
00:03:54,279 --> 00:04:00,559
We got the sermon titles in the bulletins as we're using bulletins again this do in remembrance of me

50
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:06,800
This do in remembrance of me as we first kind of by way of introduction speak about the elements and what they represent

51
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
We understand that in verse 25

52
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:09,639
Excuse me

53
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:17,320
Verse 24 and then in verse number 25 God gives us the Apostle Paul is sharing with the believers in Corinth here the elements the bread

54
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,799
of course representing the body of Christ and

55
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:25,660
We of course would use unleavened bread because he the Lord Jesus Christ is without sin

56
00:04:25,739 --> 00:04:32,459
We find that leaven throughout the scriptures is a type or picture of sin and therefore we would use an unleavened bread

57
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,019
The cup as mentioned in verse number 25

58
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:43,220
Represents the precious blood of the Lord Jesus Christ. I'm so thankful for the blood of Christ that was shed the price of our redemption

59
00:04:44,059 --> 00:04:51,619
We understand again that we would use unfermented grape juice again because our Lord is without sin and

60
00:04:52,299 --> 00:04:58,299
You would find that the process or fermentation is a process biblically when you look at those things and the type

61
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:02,820
of sin and what-have-you and so our Lord is sinless and

62
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:07,540
He is he was tempted in all points such as we are yet

63
00:05:08,059 --> 00:05:13,820
Without sin and what a wonderful blessing as we think about the elements that will be

64
00:05:14,739 --> 00:05:17,459
Partaken this evening as we observe the Lord's Supper

65
00:05:17,459 --> 00:05:21,739
It's important for us to understand that these elements do not mysteriously

66
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:26,019
Magically turn into anything other than what they are

67
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:31,579
it's an unleavened cracker and it's unfermented grape juice and it is a

68
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:38,940
Representation of the body and blood of the Lord Jesus Christ. It's we understand that biblically

69
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:42,739
there are some groups of people that would teach that the

70
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:48,059
Substances the elements that they change into something other than what they are

71
00:05:48,059 --> 00:05:53,980
And we need to be careful that we understand that the Lord is giving us this as a table of remembrance

72
00:05:54,179 --> 00:05:56,739
And we'll look at these things in just a moment

73
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:01,859
As we go through the text of Scripture, but he was crucified once

74
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:09,579
Amen this man after he'd offered himself one sacrifice for sins forever and

75
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,380
He said on the cross of Calvary it is

76
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:15,779
Finished these elements cannot save you

77
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:22,299
Amen, you can take as many unleavened crackers and unfermented grape juice as you want

78
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:25,459
It's not going to cause you to be saved. It's not going to redeem you and

79
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,140
the reality is that

80
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:35,660
These elements that we've purchased and that we use there is absolutely zero saving power in those elements

81
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:42,380
We're saved through the blood of Christ the precious blood of Christ again, it's a representation

82
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:46,940
and so it's an important that we would understand that truth this evening a

83
00:06:47,459 --> 00:06:49,459
picture if you will a

84
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:56,700
Memorial making known to us and being mindful of what the Lord Jesus Christ did on the cross of Calvary

85
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:00,220
We could ask ourselves this question again by way of introduction

86
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,660
Not only would do what are the elements and what do they represent?

87
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:07,540
But who is it that should participate we find that this ordinance is to the local church

88
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:11,660
We mentioned that just a few moments ago that I believe and as you study the scriptures

89
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:15,540
You'll find there are two ordinances for the local church and there's some Bible truth

90
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:20,619
That God gives us with regard to the local church who can be a member of a local church

91
00:07:20,619 --> 00:07:25,339
Well, we believe that saved people are members of a local church. Amen

92
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:32,019
You come to me and say pastor. I want to join your church and I want to be a part of this local assembly

93
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:34,019
I want to have my membership here

94
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:39,420
Well, it's not a club that you pay some dues and you kind of just join up and be part of the club

95
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:44,140
No membership in a local church is an important thing. No doubt

96
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:50,480
It's a biblical thing, but we find that membership in a local church. There's proper candidates for membership

97
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,459
Are you saved have you been scripturally baptized?

98
00:07:53,459 --> 00:08:00,940
and if you have been saved and you've been scripturally baptized then you are eligible to be a member of a local church and

99
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:08,700
Those are the conversations that I have with individuals as they would come and speak to me about membership here and we'd have those conversations

100
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,380
It's a great opportunity to speak about

101
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:18,500
Just our our testimony and sharing what Christ has done in our lives and what a blessing that is

102
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:24,579
And so we know that this is for the local church and the Bible speaks about this truth in verse 27 where it says wherefore

103
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:28,459
Whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord

104
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:33,460
Unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord and then it talks about examination again

105
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:38,059
We'll deal with that as we get into the message this evening, but we find that again. It's for the

106
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:45,979
The believers it's for those that are born again saved baptized members of a local church. There are some and I don't know

107
00:08:46,619 --> 00:08:51,780
You perhaps you've been exposed to some that have this idea of a close or a closed

108
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:57,219
communion as they would call it or maybe they would use the terminology of an open communion and

109
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:01,260
Someone that would have an idea of an open communion

110
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:06,500
they would carry with it the idea that man anyone can partake of it and really they would not give any type of

111
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,780
instruction as to who it's really for and

112
00:09:09,539 --> 00:09:14,700
Someone that would believe and I would fall in this category of a close communion

113
00:09:14,979 --> 00:09:20,140
If you're saved baptized member of a church, maybe you're not a member at this moment

114
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:26,820
But you're actively looking for membership and praying and asking the Lord to provide direction with regard to membership

115
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,820
You're a member of another local

116
00:09:29,539 --> 00:09:33,140
Independent church that stands for the truth of the Bible then there's close fellowship

117
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:38,979
I visited churches in the past and you show up if we had visitors here from out of town that were members of a good

118
00:09:39,099 --> 00:09:44,820
Solid Bible believing church and we're observing the Lord's Supper. I would not tell them. No, you cannot partake

119
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:50,140
I believe in close fellowship if you will or a close communion. And so as we look at these

120
00:09:51,099 --> 00:09:53,099
truths and we look at these

121
00:09:53,099 --> 00:09:59,940
Introductory kind of comments a final question that could be asked is this how often should we observe the Lord's Supper?

122
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:03,380
Well, the Bible doesn't give us any specified timeline.

123
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:08,320
In fact, in verse number 26 of the text of Scripture, the Bible says for as often as

124
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,660
ye eat this bread and drink this cup.

125
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:15,560
And so it does not tell us specifically that you're to observe the Lord's Supper every

126
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,280
week, every month, every quarter.

127
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,480
It just doesn't tell us.

128
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,060
It says as often as you do.

129
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:26,600
And so I believe that it's important that we observe the Lord's Supper with regularity.

130
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:33,040
Of course, with this situation that's gone on in the last calendar year, we've had difficulties

131
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:39,520
with regard to some of the things that have been said to us with regard to transmission

132
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,720
and so on and so forth.

133
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:49,120
And so we have sought to take certain precautions and we have been able to secure these particular

134
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,760
items that we can distribute and not have individuals passing them and everyone touching

135
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,600
them and so on and so forth.

136
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,400
And I am thankful for the opportunity to be able to have that.

137
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:03,000
And I appreciate the opportunity to observe the Lord's Supper.

138
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,360
I think it's an important thing.

139
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,240
It's a God-mandated ordinance for the local church and it's important.

140
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:16,080
And we understand as we approach the Lord's Supper, as we approach the table, there's

141
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:22,160
a level of sobriety that comes with it and a sobering understanding of what these elements

142
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:27,520
represent and what our salvation really cost the Lord Jesus Christ.

143
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,440
And so as we think about this passage of Scripture and we think about these specifics that are

144
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,680
given and some of the truth that is revealed to us, I want to just three quick thoughts

145
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,720
this evening with regard to the purpose.

146
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:45,720
Why is it that the Lord gave us this ordinance to be observed by the local church?

147
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:50,480
In verses 24 and 25, I believe that we could look at and refer to the Lord's Supper as

148
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,240
being a table of remembrance.

149
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,000
A table of remembrance.

150
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,880
You know that as human beings we are prone to forget.

151
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:01,480
We really are.

152
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,959
And sometimes we forget entirely.

153
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:07,800
We just cannot remember.

154
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:12,520
Other times it's not so much that we've completely forgotten something, it's just not at the

155
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,800
forefront of our memory.

156
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:22,839
We're not living with a daily awareness of that particular truth or that particular thing.

157
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:26,919
And I believe that as we look at this passage of Scripture and we see these words at the

158
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:33,199
end of verse 24 and 25 where it says, in remembrance of me, in remembrance of me, you'll be mindful

159
00:12:33,199 --> 00:12:34,440
of the nation of Israel.

160
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,000
They, of course, had been given instruction.

161
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,360
In fact, God instructed Moses to give the children of Israel this instruction in Deuteronomy

162
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,800
chapter number six, after you come into a land and you are in a land and you're living

163
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:52,119
in a place and there's vineyards that you did not plant, there's houses that you did

164
00:12:52,119 --> 00:12:57,160
not build, beware lest thou forget the Lord.

165
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:01,839
You can ask yourself the question as you look at the history of Israel, you can say, how

166
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:02,839
could they forget?

167
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:06,440
But you know what Jeremiah said?

168
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:11,199
God's indictment against the children of Israel, against Judah in particular, my people have

169
00:13:11,199 --> 00:13:14,479
forgotten me days without number.

170
00:13:14,479 --> 00:13:15,479
Wow.

171
00:13:15,479 --> 00:13:22,880
They're not living with the daily awareness of who God is and what God has done for them.

172
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:28,960
And there are times in our lives that if someone were to stop us and say, hey, are you saved?

173
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,960
Are you redeemed?

174
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,880
Man, you, yeah, absolutely.

175
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:36,360
But sometimes in the rut of life and you're dealing with all sorts of things, maybe you're

176
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:40,400
not just as aware of it as you should be.

177
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,040
I have, I don't know, maybe I'm just weird.

178
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,479
I try to do things creative.

179
00:13:46,479 --> 00:13:50,639
Now I'm not a very creative person, but I try to do things creative.

180
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,160
And so, you know, they tell you I'm going to wear a mask, I'm going to wear a mask that

181
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,279
has a message on it that I'm going to try to share something about the Lord.

182
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:01,800
And Jesus loves you, Jesus saves, I have them, I try to use them.

183
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:06,600
In fact, most always when I put a mask on, it's one of those two.

184
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,479
I have a, how many of you have like, you know, your online banking and they want to

185
00:14:10,479 --> 00:14:15,080
give you a password, but then sometimes they give you a catchphrase, give me a phrase.

186
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:18,480
And so when you call in, they want to know, okay, tell me what your phrase is.

187
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:25,320
It's some manner, some way in which they're identifying your identity, secure.

188
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,559
So I had to call the bank the other day.

189
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:32,040
My code word is, I'm going to tell like you guys, listen, if you steal my identity, it

190
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,920
is the Lord bless you, amen.

191
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,959
All those people watching online, they're getting all excited, you know, my code word

192
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:39,959
is saved.

193
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:44,000
I'm trying to be creative on picking that word.

194
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Why?

195
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,119
Because it means something.

196
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:48,119
Saved from what?

197
00:14:48,119 --> 00:14:52,920
So I called the bank on Friday and that guy gets on the phone and he's going to help me

198
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,920
out.

199
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,279
And of course he knows the answer and he gets excited on the other end of the phone.

200
00:14:58,279 --> 00:14:59,600
He says, oh man, this is good.

201
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,000
He's like, I want you to shout this answer.

202
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,200
That's what he said to me.

203
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,880
He said, I just want you to shout it.

204
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,559
He said, what's your code word?

205
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:09,559
I said, saved.

206
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:11,279
He said, man, that's good.

207
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:16,959
I don't know who the guy is, but I can tell you something that may be in your occupation

208
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:22,239
and the monotony of life, something like that could happen in your life.

209
00:15:22,239 --> 00:15:25,080
And as a believer, you could be encouraged.

210
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:31,360
I think on Friday afternoon, when I spoke to that man, I think I encouraged him.

211
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,760
I don't even know who he is just by using that word.

212
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:43,320
But all I'm saying about that is that, listen, this doing remembrance of me in understanding

213
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:51,000
what the Lord Jesus Christ did for us, remembering the cost of our redemption, remembering that

214
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,320
I'm a child of the King.

215
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:58,279
I mean, the fact that my citizenship is in heaven.

216
00:15:58,279 --> 00:16:04,799
We sing with the kids, I'm going to heaven, can't wait.

217
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:10,399
There's some of God's people, they can't sing that honestly, because they got some tent

218
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,519
stakes driven into this earth.

219
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:18,080
They're not anxious to go to heaven, honestly.

220
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:26,799
We sing with the kids, gonna see Jesus, can't wait, amen, right?

221
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:31,679
You know, when you think about the reality of it, and you think about this pause, this

222
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:37,040
doing remembrance of me, that's why it's so important to walk with God every day.

223
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:43,119
Because every day when we walk with God, I hope that you thank God for your salvation.

224
00:16:43,119 --> 00:16:47,720
And you can spend a few moments just rejoicing in what he did for you.

225
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:54,119
He did for you what no one else could ever do for you, what you could not do for yourself.

226
00:16:54,119 --> 00:16:57,480
As I was speaking with a man this week, and I talked to him about what Jesus did for us,

227
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:01,760
I said, listen man, I'm a sinner, I can't die for you and save you.

228
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,679
Me dying for you does nothing for you.

229
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:06,600
And you can't die for me.

230
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:11,559
But God in flesh, the Lord Jesus Christ, he died for me.

231
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:12,559
What are we remembering?

232
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:18,920
Well, notice in verse 24, when he had given thanks, he break it and said, take, eat.

233
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:25,720
This is my body which is broken for you, this doing remembrance of me.

234
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:32,040
I'm not sure how often you read the gospel accounts, especially the latter chapters that

235
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:41,880
deal with the crucifixion, and how that Jesus suffered for your redemption, for my redemption.

236
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:49,720
The way in which they smoked him, the things that they did, the torment that they tried

237
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,959
to inflict upon him.

238
00:17:51,959 --> 00:17:56,920
He said, this is my body, take, eat, this is my body which is broken for you, this doing

239
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,839
remembrance of me.

240
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:04,200
After the same manner also, he took the cup when he had supped, saying, this cup is the

241
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:10,959
New Testament in my blood, this do you as often as you drink it in remembrance of me.

242
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:16,200
The plan of redemption required a price to be paid.

243
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:21,000
The Bible tells us in 1 Peter that Jesus is the lamb that was slain before the foundation

244
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,160
of the world, that you're redeemed not with corruptible things, but were redeemed with

245
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:29,279
the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish.

246
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:33,159
Oh, I'm so thankful for the blood of Christ.

247
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:36,760
There's no other way to be saved, amen?

248
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:41,400
And so this do in remembrance of me, we're being mindful of those hours in which the

249
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:46,039
Lord Jesus Christ hung upon the cross of Calvary.

250
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:48,840
And what was it that kept him there?

251
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,400
Love.

252
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,239
Understanding that he was paying a price to redeem mankind.

253
00:18:55,239 --> 00:18:56,840
This do in remembrance of me.

254
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:01,440
Not only is it a table of remembrance, but I believe as we look at the passage of Scripture,

255
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,679
that it's a table of expectation.

256
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:09,239
In verse 26, we touched on the first portion of this verse a moment ago when we spoke about

257
00:19:09,239 --> 00:19:13,599
how often we observe the Lord's Supper, but the Bible says for as often as you eat this

258
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:23,200
bread and drink this cup, notice what it says, you do show the Lord's death till he come.

259
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,440
Aren't you thankful that he's coming again?

260
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,440
Hallelujah.

261
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,520
I mean, what great truth.

262
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:34,679
I mean, the reality of the truth that is before us of the soon return of our Lord and

263
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:39,919
Savior Jesus Christ, the blessed hope, as it would be referred to as Paul is writing

264
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:45,640
to Titus, and we find that for us as we would look to the Scriptures and we'd understand

265
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:52,559
the promise that Jesus himself gave, I will come again and receive you unto myself that

266
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,599
where I am, there ye may be also.

267
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:56,599
Isn't that precious?

268
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:59,960
See, I wonder how often, listen, I believe.

269
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:05,060
today that if I were to contact you at any point during the week and I were to

270
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:07,560
stop you in the middle of whatever you're doing and say, hey listen, do you

271
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:12,280
think Jesus could come today? I think every single one of you would say yes,

272
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:16,960
myself included. But you know there's some times in life that we just get so

273
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:22,040
bogged down with the things of the world and the things that are going on that

274
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:29,720
we're not living with that expectation that Jesus could come at any moment.

275
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:33,600
When we observe the Lord's Supper, not only are we remembering a table of

276
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,920
remembrance of what the Lord Jesus Christ did for us and the price that was

277
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:42,800
paid for our redemption, but it's this table of expectation that my Savior's

278
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:49,480
coming back for me. I mean hallelujah, what a blessing. We don't know when, but

279
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:53,360
we can rest assured that he's coming back. There's not one promise of God

280
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:58,000
that will not be fulfilled. We understand that God is

281
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:06,040
not a man that he should lie, amen, and what God says he will fulfill. We spent

282
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:10,800
time last Sunday evening, the entirety of our time in fact, looking at that truth

283
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:15,720
from Genesis 17 and verse number 1 when God appeared to Abram and said, I am the

284
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:22,000
Lord God Almighty, El Shaddai. We spent the entirety of our time last Sunday

285
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,840
evening looking at that truth so that we could lay a foundation for the remaining

286
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:31,600
verses in Genesis 17 and really set a foundation not only for Abraham and the

287
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:36,240
truth that would be revealed there in Genesis 17, but even for our own lives.

288
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:42,520
Because on about a dozen occasions, God is going to tell Abraham, I will do this.

289
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:48,440
He's the Lord God Almighty. He's able and he promised that he's going to come back

290
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:52,560
for us. And so we find this evening that as we observe the Lord's Supper and what

291
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:56,760
a privilege and blessing it is to be reminded, remember as human beings we're

292
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:02,880
prone to forget and we're reminded of what Christ has done for us. We have this

293
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:09,880
expectation that we're showing the Lord's death till he come. Wouldn't it be

294
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:15,800
wonderful if he came tonight? I mean honestly, man what a wonderful truth of

295
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:21,880
the Word of God, the imminent return of Christ to table not only of remembrance

296
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,240
and expectation, but as we look forward into the passage of the table of

297
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:29,360
examination. I'll say this, self-examination is not practiced as

298
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:37,040
often as it should be. Sometimes in our lives we look to perhaps look at

299
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:42,560
ourselves in a better light than what the reality really is. We mentioned last

300
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:47,360
week in Colossians 2 how that Paul had a great conflict not only for the

301
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,800
believers in Colossae, but those in Laodicea. We went to Revelation and

302
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,440
looked at the passage of Scripture with the Laodiceans and they had quite a

303
00:22:54,560 --> 00:23:01,240
different perspective with regard to their standing than God did. I mean it

304
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:06,840
was greatly contrasted what they believed and what God said was the

305
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:13,480
reality. You didn't know that you were poor, naked, and blind. You thought you're

306
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:18,480
filled with all these things, you have need of nothing. And so this evening we

307
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,000
think about this truth of this table of examination. The Bible says in verse 28,

308
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:29,160
but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of

309
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:33,000
that cup. For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh

310
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,920
damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. He says in verse number 30,

311
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:40,960
for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep. And we'd

312
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,200
understand that even as Jesus said to the disciples in John 11 that Lazarus

313
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:50,320
was asleep, he said he was dead. And here the idea of this passage, if you look at

314
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:56,240
the truth here, is that there are some that would die. He says for if we would

315
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:02,760
judge ourselves we should not be judged. This truth of self-examination, let a man

316
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:08,680
examine himself. You understand the standard is Christ and his Word. Paul

317
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:13,920
warned the believers in Corinth about comparing themselves among themselves.

318
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:20,280
He said it's not wise. The standard is Christ. You know that Christ is the

319
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:25,320
cornerstone. The standard is his Word. The Prophet said that his Word is like a

320
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:29,280
plumb line. You have a cornerstone and a plumb line, you can build any kind of

321
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:35,240
building. And the reality is that we have the standard, the Lord Jesus Christ and

322
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:40,720
his Word. He's given us in his Word the truth with regard to those things that

323
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,920
please him and how we're to live our lives. And we examine ourselves as

324
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:50,200
individuals based upon the truth of God's Word. But let a man examine

325
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:55,040
himself. I know that often as we would think about this passage of Scripture

326
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,960
and think about this process of self-examination, perhaps it's a process

327
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:05,960
in which we're not eager to enter into. But it's a good process for us. It's a

328
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:12,800
vital process for the child of God to have this this self-examination. But

329
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,760
there's some important aspects to self-examination. Number one, we need to

330
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:22,760
be honest with ourselves. Truly say, I think Mark you prayed it this morning

331
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:29,240
from Psalm 139, search us. Show us if there be any wicked way. Right? And we

332
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:36,040
find that this truth of this self-examination that we would truly ask

333
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:42,440
the Lord and take his Word and let it search us out. What are some things that

334
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:46,160
I'm not doing that I need to be doing? What are some things that I'm doing that

335
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:51,840
I need to stop doing? And we have this process of self-examination. And so as we

336
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,760
look at the passage of Scripture, we rejoice in the instruction that God has

337
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:01,160
given us, and we rejoice in the process that we have as a local church that

338
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:07,320
we can observe the Lord's Supper. And as we do, it's not just a tack-on kind of a

339
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:12,920
thing that we just, you know, have the Lord's Supper. Man, it's a time in which

340
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:20,640
we're really reflecting, taking some time to really remember what was done to pay

341
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:26,360
for my salvation. You know, I think if we would have a greater appreciation for

342
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:33,960
our salvation, it would really impact how we live for God. It really would. See, our

343
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:40,920
salvation didn't really cost us anything. It cost Christ everything. I'm thankful for

344
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:47,720
my salvation, and I'm thankful for the table of remembrance, this dew and

345
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:54,520
remembrance of me. I'm so excited about the return of Christ, and I'm listening

346
00:26:54,520 --> 00:27:02,280
for the trumpet, amen? I mean, honestly, I'm looking for the coming of the Lord. As

347
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:07,240
we find in the book of James, the coming of the Lord, it draweth nigh. It draweth

348
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:11,960
nigh. We don't know the hour or the day, but oh, that God would help us to be

349
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:16,760
motivated in how we live our lives. And as we take this evening, partake of these

350
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:20,040
elements that we would not only remember what He did for us and what it

351
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:25,160
cost Him, but we would be mindful of His soon return, and we'd live in accordance

352
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:30,640
to that truth. This evening, we're going to have a time of examination. I think

353
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,240
it's important before we observe the Lord's Supper that we take a few

354
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:41,160
moments in the quietness of the moment to just really seek the face of God and

355
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:47,200
allow God to deal with us. In a moment, Holly will play quietly on the piano.

356
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:52,680
This idea of drinking and eating unworthily. I was in a church many, many

357
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:56,840
years ago where someone said, well, I'm not worthy. They just kind of let it pass

358
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:01,840
by them. Now, if you're not saved, you should not take these elements this

359
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:06,480
evening. If you've not been born again, it's not for you. And I don't say that

360
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,240
with not being kind. I'm just telling you, it's not for you if you're not

361
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:15,680
saved. But if we have sin in our lives, it's not that we say, well, I'm not worthy,

362
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:20,760
I can't partake. Because if we have sin in our lives, we have a forgiving God, as

363
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:26,440
Holly mentioned in her testimony earlier this evening. I'm so thankful that the

364
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:30,120
Bible tells in the Old Testament that with thee there is forgiveness. He's a

365
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:34,960
God ready to pardon, ready to forgive, if we confess our sins. He is faithful and

366
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:40,000
just to forgive us and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. The idea is not

367
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,320
to hold on to our sin. As we go through the process of self-examination and God

368
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,880
points something out, it's that we'd confess it and forsake it and have

369
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:54,559
forgiveness so that we can partake. So, Holly, if you'd come and play quietly on

370
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:57,559
the piano in just a moment, I'm gonna pray and then we'll have this time of

371
00:28:57,559 --> 00:29:02,320
examination. We'll pray again and then we will partake of the elements. Let's pray.

372
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,720
Father, we love you. We thank you for your Word, the instruction that's contained

373
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:11,240
therein. We pray, God, that you would help us tonight as we partake of these

374
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:17,679
elements to be mindful of the price of our redemption. This due and remembrance

375
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:22,960
of me, the body that was broken for us, the blood that was shed to pay for our

376
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,960
sin, how thankful we are for redemption through Christ. I pray that you'd help us

377
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:36,200
to have a level of excitement as we have the expectation of your soon return in

378
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:41,480
these few moments as we have a time of self-examination. I pray, God, that you'd

379
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:46,520
help us to be transparent and honest before you. God, that we truly allow you

380
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:52,080
to have your way in our lives. We truly allow you to search us and know us and

381
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:57,720
show us. And Lord, that we would confess and forsake and receive forgiveness. I

382
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:02,000
pray, God, that you'd bless the time

383
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,719
I pray that you alone would be honored and glorified for it's in Christ's name. We pray

384
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,460
Amen
