1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,639
times throughout this psalm, Psalm 119, that the psalmist actually cries out,

2
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:11,119
teach me. And one of the things that he asked the Lord to teach him

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,920
over and over is to teach him his statutes. And we started with verse number 12,

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:24,559
blessed art thou, O Lord, teach me thy statutes. What a great plea, what a great desire,

5
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:29,200
a desire that each of us ought to have and adopt. And we've dealt with all of that groundwork,

6
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:34,639
and we've gone through several things with regard to having a teachable spirit and promoting

7
00:00:34,639 --> 00:00:38,240
learning in our lives and so on and so forth, the purpose for learning.

8
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:43,040
And last week, we looked at lessons from history. We looked at the portion of Scripture there in

9
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,919
1 Corinthians 10 and the way in which the Apostle Paul, as he was ministering to the church in

10
00:00:47,919 --> 00:00:55,360
Corinth, used historical events to teach them lessons. And of course, we find not only there

11
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,279
in the book of 1 Corinthians, but also in the book of Romans, that we are taught that the word

12
00:00:59,279 --> 00:01:04,239
of God, those things that were written aforetime, speaking of the Old Testament, were written for

13
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:09,599
our admonition for our learning. And of course, as they're writing to New Testament believers there,

14
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:14,559
we now have the entire complete canon of Scripture for which we're very thankful.

15
00:01:14,559 --> 00:01:20,160
This evening, we'll begin, as we look last week, lessons from history. This evening, we'll begin

16
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:25,680
looking at a number of classrooms. I'll refer to them as classrooms as we go through the next

17
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,120
several weeks of lessons. And as I mentioned several weeks ago, the reality is that God will

18
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:37,120
use a variety of methods to teach His children. He doesn't always use the same method. He doesn't

19
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:41,919
always use the same classroom. That's how I'll use that phraseology. And so, we must come to

20
00:01:41,919 --> 00:01:46,400
the place. I believe this is important and foundational for us to understand. And it's

21
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:54,800
this truth. We must come to the place in our lives that we trust Him to utilize the right method

22
00:01:54,800 --> 00:02:02,000
at the right time. Amen? We come to the place in our lives where we recognize, where we trust Him

23
00:02:02,559 --> 00:02:11,600
fully to utilize the right method at the right time. God knows what we need more than we do.

24
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:18,160
Amen? He knows what I need. He knows what you need. He knows better than we do. Sometimes we

25
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,039
might think, well, I'm signing up to go into the classroom of, and you'll be able to fill in the

26
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:27,679
blank as we go through a number of these over the next several Wednesdays. But this evening,

27
00:02:27,679 --> 00:02:33,839
the classroom that I'm going to deal with, I believe, is a classroom that is rarely desired,

28
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:45,039
but often necessary. There are some lessons, some principles, some truths, some realities

29
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:50,320
about our God that can only be learned in this classroom that we're going to deal with tonight,

30
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:56,960
and I've titled the message, The Classroom of Affliction. The classroom of affliction.

31
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:02,639
It's not a desired classroom. It really isn't. But I'm telling you this evening,

32
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:08,000
from personal experience, from looking at the truth of God's Word, that at times in our lives,

33
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,360
and God knows when those times are, it is a necessary classroom. And when we learn to accept

34
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,360
that, I'll make some statements at the end of the lesson tonight that I hope will be a help to each

35
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:25,520
of us and to have that right perspective with regard to understanding that God knows best,

36
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:30,240
and He knows what we need when we need it. Some virtues are only seen in affliction.

37
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:35,520
To be afflicted, well, the definition of affliction is the state of being afflicted,

38
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:41,440
a state of pain, distress, or grief. To be afflicted is to be affected with continued or

39
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:47,440
often repeated pain, either of body or mind, suffering, grief, or distress of any kind,

40
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,960
according to the 1828 Noah Webster's Dictionary. And so as we think about these definitions of

41
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:57,199
affliction and we think about this classroom of affliction that at times God will use,

42
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:03,119
I want you to consider first of all this evening the testimony of the psalmist. Here in Psalm 119,

43
00:04:03,119 --> 00:04:07,279
we mention that the verse that we started out with to begin our study on Wednesday evening,

44
00:04:07,279 --> 00:04:13,440
seven weeks ago, with this mini-series of teach me was verse number 12, when he said,

45
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:19,440
Blessed art thou, O Lord, teach me thy statutes. But I want to draw your attention this evening

46
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:26,000
to this classroom of affliction in verse number 71. In verse number 71 of Psalm 119, I want you

47
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,679
to notice what the psalmist says. He says, It is good for me that I have been afflicted,

48
00:04:33,119 --> 00:04:41,519
that I might learn thy statutes. What was his prayer specifically? His prayer specifically was

49
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:47,359
teach me thy statutes, right? It's repeated throughout Psalm 119. I won't take the time

50
00:04:47,359 --> 00:04:51,920
this evening to look at every reference in Psalm 119 that says teach me thy statutes,

51
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:56,799
but there's a number of them. And as we consider how that specifically he's praying and he's

52
00:04:56,799 --> 00:05:04,480
desiring, he's saying, Lord, teach me thy statutes. He then reveals to us in verse number 71, that it

53
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:12,399
is good for me that I have been afflicted. Why? That I might learn thy statutes. So his desire,

54
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:20,720
his plea to God is, Lord, teach me thy statutes. And at times the psalmist recognizes it's preserved

55
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:27,519
for us to help us recognize as well, that at times God will use the classroom of affliction

56
00:05:28,239 --> 00:05:35,440
so that we too might learn his statutes. And as we think about the testimony of the psalmist,

57
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:41,600
we see, we know his perspective here in verse number 71. Notice he says, It is good for me

58
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,359
that I have been afflicted. Oftentimes when we're in the classroom of affliction, if we're not

59
00:05:47,359 --> 00:05:52,720
careful, we'll despise that classroom. We'll look for every opportunity to get out of that

60
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:58,320
classroom. I don't like this classroom, and we may miss the lesson that God has for us.

61
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:06,320
But we know the perspective here of the psalmist when he says, It is good for me,

62
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:13,760
it is good for me that I have been afflicted. That's a perspective that we need to adopt in

63
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:20,320
our lives. As we note the perspective, we also note the result. He says that he learns the

64
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:27,040
statutes. He says that I may learn, that I might, excuse me, learn thy statutes. And so God uses the

65
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:31,519
classroom of affliction. We see it in the life of the psalmist here, and we know in verse 71.

66
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:36,720
I want you to back up just a few verses, and I want you to see what he says in verse number 67,

67
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,000
how he speaks about the past and the present. He says this, Before I was afflicted,

68
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:51,679
notice what he says, I went astray. But then notice the end of verse 67, But now have I kept

69
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:59,760
thy word. What changed? The classroom of affliction, right? Because he says in verse 67,

70
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:06,640
he says, I went astray, but now I've kept thy word. And the difference, the change was the

71
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:12,160
affliction, because he says, Before I was afflicted, I went astray. And what a blessing

72
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:18,720
to think about the way in which God will help us to learn in the classroom of affliction.

73
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:24,160
Again, it's a classroom that often we don't desire to go to, but again, as we understand,

74
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:30,559
and I made the point of stressing it by way of introduction, that we must learn that God knows

75
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:37,279
best, and that God knows when we need to experience, that we need to learn a lesson

76
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:45,279
that will be best taught in the classroom of affliction. It may not be that we'll learn that

77
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:51,839
lesson in any other classroom. It may not be that we'll learn of that attribute and of the nature

78
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:57,279
of our God in any other classroom. And so God wants us to grow, He wants us to learn, and the

79
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:02,720
psalmist has this plea, the psalmist has this desire, and God is answering his prayer through

80
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:09,440
affliction. And you say, Really? Yeah. And he recognized that it was an answer to prayer,

81
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:16,640
because he says, It is good for me that I have been afflicted, that I might learn thy statutes.

82
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:23,839
God, you answered my prayer, you answered my plea, you answered my desire to teach me thy statutes

83
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:30,320
by taking me through the classroom of affliction. What a great perspective, what a great testimony.

84
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:34,479
We see the testimony of the psalmist, I want you to consider the testimony of the Apostle Paul. Turn

85
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,880
to the book of 2 Corinthians, if you will, and I want to note a couple of passages here in the book

86
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:46,479
of 2 Corinthians as we note the testimony of Paul with regard to this classroom of affliction.

87
00:08:46,479 --> 00:08:52,159
In 2 Corinthians chapter number 4, we note that Paul is going to rehearse some things with regard

88
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:58,559
to some of his experiences and some of the things in which he dealt with, and he's going to make

89
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:05,280
this list a whole lot longer. In chapter number 11, he goes through all of the things that he

90
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:11,119
suffered. But here in chapter number 4, he's speaking, and he says this in verse number 8,

91
00:09:11,119 --> 00:09:18,479
we are troubled on every side, yet not distressed. We are perplexed, but not in despair. Verse 9,

92
00:09:18,479 --> 00:09:26,479
persecuted but not forsaken, cast down but not destroyed. Notice what he says in verse number 10

93
00:09:26,479 --> 00:09:32,320
of 2 Corinthians 4, always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus,

94
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:39,520
that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body. And I want you to skip down and look

95
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:45,280
at verse number 16. It says, for which cause we faint not, but though our outward man perish,

96
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:51,200
yet the inward man is renewed day by day. And so, he's described for us a little bit here of

97
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,559
some of what he's dealt with and some of the circumstances in which he faces. And then I want

98
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:04,400
you to, again, note the perspective in verse number 17. Notice what Paul says, for our light

99
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:12,400
affliction, which is but for a moment. Now, just pause there. We'll read the rest of the

100
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:17,760
verse in just a moment, but I want you to really get a hold of the perspective of the Apostle Paul,

101
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:25,119
because he says, as he's describing the affliction, he describes it as being a light affliction,

102
00:10:25,119 --> 00:10:30,559
and he describes it as being but for a moment. And no doubt, when we're in the classroom of

103
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:35,760
affliction, there are times in which we would not describe it as being light or being brief,

104
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:42,799
right? And yet, the Apostle Paul, and we know, and I mentioned already that in 2 Corinthians 11,

105
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:46,640
and we don't have time to read all of it, but in 2 Corinthians chapter number 11,

106
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:52,080
really beginning in verse number 21 and going down through verse number 28, he really lists all the

107
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:57,359
things that he dealt with and all of the things that he suffered, but yet the Apostle Paul, because

108
00:10:57,359 --> 00:11:03,440
of this perspective, he can look at the affliction that he dealt with and he can refer to it as being

109
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:09,200
a light affliction that is but for a moment. Why is it that he would say it's for a moment? Well,

110
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:16,559
because in light of eternity, it truly is but a moment. Peter ends, as he's writing to the

111
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:22,080
believers that are suffering and they're dealing with great adversity, and as he's writing to these

112
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:29,200
people that have been suffering and they've been dealing with these things and so on and so forth,

113
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,960
and he says this in 1 Peter 5 and verse number 10, he says,

114
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:37,200
But the God of all grace, who hath caught us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus,

115
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:43,520
after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, establish, strengthen, settle you.

116
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:48,799
To him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen. It's interesting because he says that he

117
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:55,599
hath caught us unto his eternal glory, and then he says, after that you have suffered a while.

118
00:11:55,599 --> 00:12:02,239
We don't know how long a while is, but we know this one thing, it's not forever. Amen. It's a

119
00:12:02,239 --> 00:12:08,880
lot shorter than eternity. And so when we think about the perspective, and he says it's a light

120
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:15,280
affliction and it's just for a moment, which is but for a moment, notice what he says. Notice

121
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:19,840
what the affliction produces. Notice what the perspective is here. He says at the end of verse

122
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:33,280
number 17 here in 2 Corinthians 4, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.

123
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:38,559
Isn't that good? When you think about this classroom of affliction, you think about the

124
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:44,479
psalmist, and he says, it is good for me that I've been afflicted, that I might learn thy statutes.

125
00:12:44,479 --> 00:12:49,119
And here the apostle Paul, he says that our light affliction, which is but for a moment,

126
00:12:49,119 --> 00:12:58,320
notice it worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. Notice, turn over

127
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,239
to chapter number 12, if you will, here, 2 Corinthians, and I want you to notice we're

128
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:06,799
familiar with the passage of Scripture, and often we quote part of verse number 9 when it says,

129
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:12,000
my grace is sufficient for thee. But I want you to look at the entirety here very briefly. In verse

130
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,039
number 7, the Bible says that Paul is sharing his testimony and says, lest I should be exalted

131
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:22,960
above measure through the abundance of the revelations. Notice, there was given to me a

132
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:31,039
thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.

133
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:36,640
Notice what Paul says about this thing. He says, for this thing I besought the Lord thrice,

134
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:44,719
that it might depart from me. What's Paul saying? I wasn't enjoying this, right? So I asked the Lord

135
00:13:44,719 --> 00:13:49,440
on three separate occasions. Remember, we used the example on Sunday morning of Paul being a man

136
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:56,000
of prayer. Paul, right after his conversion, God says to Ananias, you're going to go into the city,

137
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,760
you're going to go on the street, you're going to find one by the name of Saul, and he's praying.

138
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:05,599
And that was the start of his prayer life, and we see it throughout his life. He is a man of prayer.

139
00:14:05,599 --> 00:14:11,520
He constantly encouraged others by telling them that he's praying for them. He constantly asked

140
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:16,719
others to pray for him, and here he speaks specifically about praying, and he begged,

141
00:14:16,719 --> 00:14:22,239
he besought the Lord on three separate occasions that it might depart from me. But notice what God

142
00:14:22,239 --> 00:14:31,359
says. He, God, said unto me, my grace is sufficient for thee, for my strength is made perfect

143
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:38,000
in weakness. Can I tell you, let me finish reading. It says, most gladly therefore

144
00:14:38,719 --> 00:14:47,599
will I rather glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ may rest upon me. Therefore,

145
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:56,479
I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions,

146
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:04,640
in distresses for Christ's sake. For when I am weak, then am I strong. Let me ask you,

147
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:12,000
do you think Paul learned something through this time of affliction in his life? Sure he did.

148
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:20,320
He learned that God's grace is sufficient. He learned that God's response to him seeking the

149
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:27,119
face of God on these three occasions and saying, Lord, let this thing depart from me. And God says,

150
00:15:27,119 --> 00:15:34,640
my grace is sufficient. And he tells them that my strength is made perfect in weakness.

151
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:43,599
Sometimes we don't like the feeling, the position of being weak, or feeling weak. We feel vulnerable.

152
00:15:43,599 --> 00:15:50,640
But the reality is that Paul responds to this lesson that he learned. He responds to this truth

153
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:57,119
that he's given because of this affliction. He says, most gladly therefore will I rather

154
00:15:57,119 --> 00:16:06,400
glory in my infirmities. Why? That the power of Christ may rest upon me. Christ in me,

155
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:14,400
the hope of glory. Amen? We're to be strong in the power of His might. We find here that

156
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:19,200
he then concludes, and quite honestly, as you read verse number 10 of 2 Corinthians 12,

157
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:25,280
your mind just seeking to wrap around this perspective and asking the Lord to help us to

158
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:31,280
get to this place in our lives where we too could echo the words and say, therefore I take pleasure

159
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:40,159
in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecution, in distresses for Christ's sake. Why?

160
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:48,960
Because when I am weak, then am I strong. It's the strength of Christ. And Paul learned this

161
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:56,880
lesson, and what valuable lesson it is for him. It was for him, but it is for us as well as we

162
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:03,200
consider tonight this classroom of affliction. I want to draw your attention to Psalm 34. I

163
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:08,479
mentioned this a couple of Sundays ago in our Sunday school class when we looked at that truth

164
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:15,359
from Psalm 62 and verse number 8, but I want you to notice in Psalm 34 in closing this evening,

165
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:24,640
in Psalm 34, of course, David is rejoicing, he's blessing the Lord, he's speaking of his

166
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:30,400
personal experiences and deliverances, and then he speaks about the righteous as he goes through

167
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:36,319
the passage. But I want you to notice in verse number 19 that he says, many are the afflictions

168
00:17:36,479 --> 00:17:42,000
are the afflictions of the righteous. He says this, but the Lord delivers him out of them all.

169
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:47,199
And we can carry that truth and that promise, and we can rejoice in that.

170
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:52,239
And we can understand that many are the afflictions of the righteous, and that when those

171
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:59,199
afflictions come in your life and in my life, that God has a purpose in them, that God has a purpose

172
00:17:59,199 --> 00:18:06,959
for them. Listen, our God is in control of all things, and our God is a good God. He's a gracious

173
00:18:06,959 --> 00:18:12,959
God. He's a loving God. And when we understand that He loves us and He cares about us and

174
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:18,239
He's invited us to enter into His presence, He said to us, cast your care upon me, for I care

175
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:23,439
for you. And you say, well, then why would He let me deal with afflictions? Because He wants to teach

176
00:18:23,439 --> 00:18:31,920
us some lessons. And some lessons are only going to be learned in the classroom of affliction.

177
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:38,319
I'm going to read to you two quotes in closing this evening. One, I don't agree with either

178
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:43,359
one of these guys on everything theologically, but I think that the quotes that they made in

179
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:51,199
reference to this subject are powerful. Martin Luther said this, I never knew the meaning of

180
00:18:51,199 --> 00:19:00,880
God's Word until I came into affliction. I have always found it, affliction, one of my best

181
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:12,880
schoolmasters. Wow, that's powerful. Spurgeon said this, very little is to be learned without affliction.

182
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:25,760
If we would be scholars, we must be sufferers. God's commands are best read with eyes wet with

183
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:33,520
tears. That's powerful. These two men, again, I don't agree with everything theologically,

184
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:40,079
but those are powerful statements from their walk with Christ and their experience in the

185
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:45,760
classroom of affliction and saying that, I've learned just as the psalmist said that it was

186
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:51,359
good for me to be afflicted because then I learned thy statutes, that I've learned that

187
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:59,040
this classroom of affliction, this is one of my best schoolmasters. I realize that this classroom

188
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:08,800
may not be our favorite. However, I hope we learn to trust our loving Lord and appreciate His use

189
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:18,079
of this classroom in our lives. For then, we will learn the lessons that He desires to teach us.

190
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:24,959
I'm glad that it's not the only classroom that the Lord has. Amen? There are other classrooms,

191
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:29,040
but there are seasons in our life that God says,

192
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:37,520
for this season, this is the classroom, the classroom of affliction. And when we learn to

193
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:46,719
trust our loving Lord and learn to understand that He has a plan and a purpose for that classroom

194
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:55,520
in our lives, then we can learn the lessons that He has for us in that classroom. By the way,

195
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,560
as a side note, it's a classroom that I desire to learn in quickly.

196
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:07,599
I don't say that just to be facetious. I'm being honest. It's a classroom that I desire. If God has

197
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:12,560
that classroom for me, I want to learn the lesson as quickly as possible. But here's what I've

198
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:19,439
learned. When I despise the classroom of affliction, I spend more time in the classroom

199
00:21:19,439 --> 00:21:28,079
of affliction. Right? What happens in school when you fail a class? You get to repeat the class.

200
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:35,280
You get to repeat the class. I know nowadays they have some policies and whatever that change some

201
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:40,079
of that, but I remember when I was going through school, you failed a class, you'd repeat the class.

202
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:46,000
Why? Because there were some lessons, there were some principles that you had to learn before you

203
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,599
went on. Right? And by the way, just by pushing somebody to the next class doesn't really do any

204
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:58,800
favors for them because they're always behind. Right? It's always a challenge for them. And so,

205
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:04,640
until those principles are learned, you do not get to go to the next grade, to the next class,

206
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:10,400
to the next... Right? And God has this classroom of affliction. He says, these are some lessons

207
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:15,599
that I want you to learn. And I want to come to the place in my life, and I hope tonight as we've

208
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:20,160
spent just a few minutes looking at this classroom of affliction, that you too would want to come to

209
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:26,000
the place in your life where we learn to appreciate the classroom of affliction, just as the psalmist

210
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,599
did, just as Paul did. And we say, Lord, teach me thy statutes. And I understand sometimes in praying

211
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:38,479
that prayer, you may use the classroom of affliction. Help me not to despise it. Help me to know

212
00:22:39,199 --> 00:22:47,280
and to trust that you know best, and you know what classroom I need to learn what lesson.

213
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:54,640
Amen? Let's pray. Father, we love you. We thank you so much for loving us. And we know that

214
00:22:58,959 --> 00:23:02,079
you're in control of everything, and you have a purpose for everything.

215
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:09,359
Perhaps tonight there's one that's in the classroom of affliction. They know it.

216
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,079
Maybe they know the lesson that you're teaching them.

217
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,599
Maybe they're so uncertain as to the lesson that you're teaching them.

218
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:27,119
Perhaps even someone has despised the classroom of affliction. God, I pray that you'd help us.

219
00:23:28,239 --> 00:23:31,119
I'm thankful this isn't the only classroom that you have for us.

220
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:37,119
But we do recognize as we study your Word that this is a classroom that you have for us.

221
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:45,359
At times that you know best, you'll send us to this classroom of affliction.

222
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:50,719
And I pray that in those times that we would trust you fully and wholly,

223
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:55,920
and know that you have a purpose, and help us to learn those lessons.

224
00:23:57,439 --> 00:24:05,280
Help us to draw closer to thee. Help us to trust you more. I pray that you'd bless our time of

225
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:11,280
prayer. We thank you for the privilege of corporate prayer. I pray that you'd bless

226
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:16,560
the remainder of our service. For it's in Christ's name we pray. Amen.
