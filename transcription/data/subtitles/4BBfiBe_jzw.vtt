WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.639
times throughout this psalm, Psalm 119, that the psalmist actually cries out,

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:11.119
teach me. And one of the things that he asked the Lord to teach him

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.920
over and over is to teach him his statutes. And we started with verse number 12,

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:24.559
blessed art thou, O Lord, teach me thy statutes. What a great plea, what a great desire,

00:00:24.559 --> 00:00:29.200
a desire that each of us ought to have and adopt. And we've dealt with all of that groundwork,

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.639
and we've gone through several things with regard to having a teachable spirit and promoting

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:38.240
learning in our lives and so on and so forth, the purpose for learning.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:43.040
And last week, we looked at lessons from history. We looked at the portion of Scripture there in

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.919
1 Corinthians 10 and the way in which the Apostle Paul, as he was ministering to the church in

00:00:47.919 --> 00:00:55.360
Corinth, used historical events to teach them lessons. And of course, we find not only there

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.279
in the book of 1 Corinthians, but also in the book of Romans, that we are taught that the word

00:00:59.279 --> 00:01:04.239
of God, those things that were written aforetime, speaking of the Old Testament, were written for

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.599
our admonition for our learning. And of course, as they're writing to New Testament believers there,

00:01:09.599 --> 00:01:14.559
we now have the entire complete canon of Scripture for which we're very thankful.

00:01:14.559 --> 00:01:20.160
This evening, we'll begin, as we look last week, lessons from history. This evening, we'll begin

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.680
looking at a number of classrooms. I'll refer to them as classrooms as we go through the next

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.120
several weeks of lessons. And as I mentioned several weeks ago, the reality is that God will

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:37.120
use a variety of methods to teach His children. He doesn't always use the same method. He doesn't

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.919
always use the same classroom. That's how I'll use that phraseology. And so, we must come to

00:01:41.919 --> 00:01:46.400
the place. I believe this is important and foundational for us to understand. And it's

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:54.800
this truth. We must come to the place in our lives that we trust Him to utilize the right method

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:02.000
at the right time. Amen? We come to the place in our lives where we recognize, where we trust Him

00:02:02.559 --> 00:02:11.600
fully to utilize the right method at the right time. God knows what we need more than we do.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:18.160
Amen? He knows what I need. He knows what you need. He knows better than we do. Sometimes we

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.039
might think, well, I'm signing up to go into the classroom of, and you'll be able to fill in the

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:27.679
blank as we go through a number of these over the next several Wednesdays. But this evening,

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:33.839
the classroom that I'm going to deal with, I believe, is a classroom that is rarely desired,

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:45.039
but often necessary. There are some lessons, some principles, some truths, some realities

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:50.320
about our God that can only be learned in this classroom that we're going to deal with tonight,

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:56.960
and I've titled the message, The Classroom of Affliction. The classroom of affliction.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:02.639
It's not a desired classroom. It really isn't. But I'm telling you this evening,

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:08.000
from personal experience, from looking at the truth of God's Word, that at times in our lives,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.360
and God knows when those times are, it is a necessary classroom. And when we learn to accept

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.360
that, I'll make some statements at the end of the lesson tonight that I hope will be a help to each

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:25.520
of us and to have that right perspective with regard to understanding that God knows best,

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.240
and He knows what we need when we need it. Some virtues are only seen in affliction.

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:35.520
To be afflicted, well, the definition of affliction is the state of being afflicted,

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:41.440
a state of pain, distress, or grief. To be afflicted is to be affected with continued or

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:47.440
often repeated pain, either of body or mind, suffering, grief, or distress of any kind,

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.960
according to the 1828 Noah Webster's Dictionary. And so as we think about these definitions of

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.199
affliction and we think about this classroom of affliction that at times God will use,

00:03:57.199 --> 00:04:03.119
I want you to consider first of all this evening the testimony of the psalmist. Here in Psalm 119,

00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:07.279
we mention that the verse that we started out with to begin our study on Wednesday evening,

00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:13.440
seven weeks ago, with this mini-series of teach me was verse number 12, when he said,

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:19.440
Blessed art thou, O Lord, teach me thy statutes. But I want to draw your attention this evening

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:26.000
to this classroom of affliction in verse number 71. In verse number 71 of Psalm 119, I want you

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.679
to notice what the psalmist says. He says, It is good for me that I have been afflicted,

00:04:33.119 --> 00:04:41.519
that I might learn thy statutes. What was his prayer specifically? His prayer specifically was

00:04:41.519 --> 00:04:47.359
teach me thy statutes, right? It's repeated throughout Psalm 119. I won't take the time

00:04:47.359 --> 00:04:51.920
this evening to look at every reference in Psalm 119 that says teach me thy statutes,

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.799
but there's a number of them. And as we consider how that specifically he's praying and he's

00:04:56.799 --> 00:05:04.480
desiring, he's saying, Lord, teach me thy statutes. He then reveals to us in verse number 71, that it

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:12.399
is good for me that I have been afflicted. Why? That I might learn thy statutes. So his desire,

00:05:12.399 --> 00:05:20.720
his plea to God is, Lord, teach me thy statutes. And at times the psalmist recognizes it's preserved

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:27.519
for us to help us recognize as well, that at times God will use the classroom of affliction

00:05:28.239 --> 00:05:35.440
so that we too might learn his statutes. And as we think about the testimony of the psalmist,

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:41.600
we see, we know his perspective here in verse number 71. Notice he says, It is good for me

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:47.359
that I have been afflicted. Oftentimes when we're in the classroom of affliction, if we're not

00:05:47.359 --> 00:05:52.720
careful, we'll despise that classroom. We'll look for every opportunity to get out of that

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:58.320
classroom. I don't like this classroom, and we may miss the lesson that God has for us.

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:06.320
But we know the perspective here of the psalmist when he says, It is good for me,

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:13.760
it is good for me that I have been afflicted. That's a perspective that we need to adopt in

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:20.320
our lives. As we note the perspective, we also note the result. He says that he learns the

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:27.040
statutes. He says that I may learn, that I might, excuse me, learn thy statutes. And so God uses the

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:31.519
classroom of affliction. We see it in the life of the psalmist here, and we know in verse 71.

00:06:31.519 --> 00:06:36.720
I want you to back up just a few verses, and I want you to see what he says in verse number 67,

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:42.000
how he speaks about the past and the present. He says this, Before I was afflicted,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:51.679
notice what he says, I went astray. But then notice the end of verse 67, But now have I kept

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:59.760
thy word. What changed? The classroom of affliction, right? Because he says in verse 67,

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:06.640
he says, I went astray, but now I've kept thy word. And the difference, the change was the

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:12.160
affliction, because he says, Before I was afflicted, I went astray. And what a blessing

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:18.720
to think about the way in which God will help us to learn in the classroom of affliction.

00:07:19.279 --> 00:07:24.160
Again, it's a classroom that often we don't desire to go to, but again, as we understand,

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:30.559
and I made the point of stressing it by way of introduction, that we must learn that God knows

00:07:30.559 --> 00:07:37.279
best, and that God knows when we need to experience, that we need to learn a lesson

00:07:37.279 --> 00:07:45.279
that will be best taught in the classroom of affliction. It may not be that we'll learn that

00:07:45.279 --> 00:07:51.839
lesson in any other classroom. It may not be that we'll learn of that attribute and of the nature

00:07:51.839 --> 00:07:57.279
of our God in any other classroom. And so God wants us to grow, He wants us to learn, and the

00:07:57.279 --> 00:08:02.720
psalmist has this plea, the psalmist has this desire, and God is answering his prayer through

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:09.440
affliction. And you say, Really? Yeah. And he recognized that it was an answer to prayer,

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:16.640
because he says, It is good for me that I have been afflicted, that I might learn thy statutes.

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:23.839
God, you answered my prayer, you answered my plea, you answered my desire to teach me thy statutes

00:08:23.839 --> 00:08:30.320
by taking me through the classroom of affliction. What a great perspective, what a great testimony.

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:34.479
We see the testimony of the psalmist, I want you to consider the testimony of the Apostle Paul. Turn

00:08:34.479 --> 00:08:38.880
to the book of 2 Corinthians, if you will, and I want to note a couple of passages here in the book

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:46.479
of 2 Corinthians as we note the testimony of Paul with regard to this classroom of affliction.

00:08:46.479 --> 00:08:52.159
In 2 Corinthians chapter number 4, we note that Paul is going to rehearse some things with regard

00:08:52.159 --> 00:08:58.559
to some of his experiences and some of the things in which he dealt with, and he's going to make

00:08:58.559 --> 00:09:05.280
this list a whole lot longer. In chapter number 11, he goes through all of the things that he

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:11.119
suffered. But here in chapter number 4, he's speaking, and he says this in verse number 8,

00:09:11.119 --> 00:09:18.479
we are troubled on every side, yet not distressed. We are perplexed, but not in despair. Verse 9,

00:09:18.479 --> 00:09:26.479
persecuted but not forsaken, cast down but not destroyed. Notice what he says in verse number 10

00:09:26.479 --> 00:09:32.320
of 2 Corinthians 4, always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus,

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:39.520
that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body. And I want you to skip down and look

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:45.280
at verse number 16. It says, for which cause we faint not, but though our outward man perish,

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:51.200
yet the inward man is renewed day by day. And so, he's described for us a little bit here of

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:56.559
some of what he's dealt with and some of the circumstances in which he faces. And then I want

00:09:56.559 --> 00:10:04.400
you to, again, note the perspective in verse number 17. Notice what Paul says, for our light

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:12.400
affliction, which is but for a moment. Now, just pause there. We'll read the rest of the

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:17.760
verse in just a moment, but I want you to really get a hold of the perspective of the Apostle Paul,

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:25.119
because he says, as he's describing the affliction, he describes it as being a light affliction,

00:10:25.119 --> 00:10:30.559
and he describes it as being but for a moment. And no doubt, when we're in the classroom of

00:10:30.559 --> 00:10:35.760
affliction, there are times in which we would not describe it as being light or being brief,

00:10:36.719 --> 00:10:42.799
right? And yet, the Apostle Paul, and we know, and I mentioned already that in 2 Corinthians 11,

00:10:42.799 --> 00:10:46.640
and we don't have time to read all of it, but in 2 Corinthians chapter number 11,

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:52.080
really beginning in verse number 21 and going down through verse number 28, he really lists all the

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:57.359
things that he dealt with and all of the things that he suffered, but yet the Apostle Paul, because

00:10:57.359 --> 00:11:03.440
of this perspective, he can look at the affliction that he dealt with and he can refer to it as being

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:09.200
a light affliction that is but for a moment. Why is it that he would say it's for a moment? Well,

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:16.559
because in light of eternity, it truly is but a moment. Peter ends, as he's writing to the

00:11:16.559 --> 00:11:22.080
believers that are suffering and they're dealing with great adversity, and as he's writing to these

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:29.200
people that have been suffering and they've been dealing with these things and so on and so forth,

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:32.960
and he says this in 1 Peter 5 and verse number 10, he says,

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:37.200
But the God of all grace, who hath caught us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus,

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:43.520
after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, establish, strengthen, settle you.

00:11:44.159 --> 00:11:48.799
To him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen. It's interesting because he says that he

00:11:48.799 --> 00:11:55.599
hath caught us unto his eternal glory, and then he says, after that you have suffered a while.

00:11:55.599 --> 00:12:02.239
We don't know how long a while is, but we know this one thing, it's not forever. Amen. It's a

00:12:02.239 --> 00:12:08.880
lot shorter than eternity. And so when we think about the perspective, and he says it's a light

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:15.280
affliction and it's just for a moment, which is but for a moment, notice what he says. Notice

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:19.840
what the affliction produces. Notice what the perspective is here. He says at the end of verse

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:33.280
number 17 here in 2 Corinthians 4, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.

00:12:34.159 --> 00:12:38.559
Isn't that good? When you think about this classroom of affliction, you think about the

00:12:38.559 --> 00:12:44.479
psalmist, and he says, it is good for me that I've been afflicted, that I might learn thy statutes.

00:12:44.479 --> 00:12:49.119
And here the apostle Paul, he says that our light affliction, which is but for a moment,

00:12:49.119 --> 00:12:58.320
notice it worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. Notice, turn over

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:02.239
to chapter number 12, if you will, here, 2 Corinthians, and I want you to notice we're

00:13:02.239 --> 00:13:06.799
familiar with the passage of Scripture, and often we quote part of verse number 9 when it says,

00:13:06.799 --> 00:13:12.000
my grace is sufficient for thee. But I want you to look at the entirety here very briefly. In verse

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.039
number 7, the Bible says that Paul is sharing his testimony and says, lest I should be exalted

00:13:17.039 --> 00:13:22.960
above measure through the abundance of the revelations. Notice, there was given to me a

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:31.039
thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.

00:13:31.039 --> 00:13:36.640
Notice what Paul says about this thing. He says, for this thing I besought the Lord thrice,

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:44.719
that it might depart from me. What's Paul saying? I wasn't enjoying this, right? So I asked the Lord

00:13:44.719 --> 00:13:49.440
on three separate occasions. Remember, we used the example on Sunday morning of Paul being a man

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:56.000
of prayer. Paul, right after his conversion, God says to Ananias, you're going to go into the city,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.760
you're going to go on the street, you're going to find one by the name of Saul, and he's praying.

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:05.599
And that was the start of his prayer life, and we see it throughout his life. He is a man of prayer.

00:14:05.599 --> 00:14:11.520
He constantly encouraged others by telling them that he's praying for them. He constantly asked

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:16.719
others to pray for him, and here he speaks specifically about praying, and he begged,

00:14:16.719 --> 00:14:22.239
he besought the Lord on three separate occasions that it might depart from me. But notice what God

00:14:22.239 --> 00:14:31.359
says. He, God, said unto me, my grace is sufficient for thee, for my strength is made perfect

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:38.000
in weakness. Can I tell you, let me finish reading. It says, most gladly therefore

00:14:38.719 --> 00:14:47.599
will I rather glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ may rest upon me. Therefore,

00:14:49.039 --> 00:14:56.479
I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions,

00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:04.640
in distresses for Christ's sake. For when I am weak, then am I strong. Let me ask you,

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:12.000
do you think Paul learned something through this time of affliction in his life? Sure he did.

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:20.320
He learned that God's grace is sufficient. He learned that God's response to him seeking the

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:27.119
face of God on these three occasions and saying, Lord, let this thing depart from me. And God says,

00:15:27.119 --> 00:15:34.640
my grace is sufficient. And he tells them that my strength is made perfect in weakness.

00:15:36.159 --> 00:15:43.599
Sometimes we don't like the feeling, the position of being weak, or feeling weak. We feel vulnerable.

00:15:43.599 --> 00:15:50.640
But the reality is that Paul responds to this lesson that he learned. He responds to this truth

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:57.119
that he's given because of this affliction. He says, most gladly therefore will I rather

00:15:57.119 --> 00:16:06.400
glory in my infirmities. Why? That the power of Christ may rest upon me. Christ in me,

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:14.400
the hope of glory. Amen? We're to be strong in the power of His might. We find here that

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:19.200
he then concludes, and quite honestly, as you read verse number 10 of 2 Corinthians 12,

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:25.280
your mind just seeking to wrap around this perspective and asking the Lord to help us to

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:31.280
get to this place in our lives where we too could echo the words and say, therefore I take pleasure

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:40.159
in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecution, in distresses for Christ's sake. Why?

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:48.960
Because when I am weak, then am I strong. It's the strength of Christ. And Paul learned this

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:56.880
lesson, and what valuable lesson it is for him. It was for him, but it is for us as well as we

00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:03.200
consider tonight this classroom of affliction. I want to draw your attention to Psalm 34. I

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:08.479
mentioned this a couple of Sundays ago in our Sunday school class when we looked at that truth

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:15.359
from Psalm 62 and verse number 8, but I want you to notice in Psalm 34 in closing this evening,

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:24.640
in Psalm 34, of course, David is rejoicing, he's blessing the Lord, he's speaking of his

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:30.400
personal experiences and deliverances, and then he speaks about the righteous as he goes through

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:36.319
the passage. But I want you to notice in verse number 19 that he says, many are the afflictions

00:17:36.479 --> 00:17:42.000
are the afflictions of the righteous. He says this, but the Lord delivers him out of them all.

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:47.199
And we can carry that truth and that promise, and we can rejoice in that.

00:17:47.199 --> 00:17:52.239
And we can understand that many are the afflictions of the righteous, and that when those

00:17:52.239 --> 00:17:59.199
afflictions come in your life and in my life, that God has a purpose in them, that God has a purpose

00:17:59.199 --> 00:18:06.959
for them. Listen, our God is in control of all things, and our God is a good God. He's a gracious

00:18:06.959 --> 00:18:12.959
God. He's a loving God. And when we understand that He loves us and He cares about us and

00:18:12.959 --> 00:18:18.239
He's invited us to enter into His presence, He said to us, cast your care upon me, for I care

00:18:18.239 --> 00:18:23.439
for you. And you say, well, then why would He let me deal with afflictions? Because He wants to teach

00:18:23.439 --> 00:18:31.920
us some lessons. And some lessons are only going to be learned in the classroom of affliction.

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:38.319
I'm going to read to you two quotes in closing this evening. One, I don't agree with either

00:18:38.319 --> 00:18:43.359
one of these guys on everything theologically, but I think that the quotes that they made in

00:18:43.359 --> 00:18:51.199
reference to this subject are powerful. Martin Luther said this, I never knew the meaning of

00:18:51.199 --> 00:19:00.880
God's Word until I came into affliction. I have always found it, affliction, one of my best

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:12.880
schoolmasters. Wow, that's powerful. Spurgeon said this, very little is to be learned without affliction.

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:25.760
If we would be scholars, we must be sufferers. God's commands are best read with eyes wet with

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:33.520
tears. That's powerful. These two men, again, I don't agree with everything theologically,

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:40.079
but those are powerful statements from their walk with Christ and their experience in the

00:19:40.079 --> 00:19:45.760
classroom of affliction and saying that, I've learned just as the psalmist said that it was

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:51.359
good for me to be afflicted because then I learned thy statutes, that I've learned that

00:19:51.359 --> 00:19:59.040
this classroom of affliction, this is one of my best schoolmasters. I realize that this classroom

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:08.800
may not be our favorite. However, I hope we learn to trust our loving Lord and appreciate His use

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:18.079
of this classroom in our lives. For then, we will learn the lessons that He desires to teach us.

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:24.959
I'm glad that it's not the only classroom that the Lord has. Amen? There are other classrooms,

00:20:25.839 --> 00:20:29.040
but there are seasons in our life that God says,

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:37.520
for this season, this is the classroom, the classroom of affliction. And when we learn to

00:20:37.599 --> 00:20:46.719
trust our loving Lord and learn to understand that He has a plan and a purpose for that classroom

00:20:46.719 --> 00:20:55.520
in our lives, then we can learn the lessons that He has for us in that classroom. By the way,

00:20:56.400 --> 00:21:00.560
as a side note, it's a classroom that I desire to learn in quickly.

00:21:00.719 --> 00:21:07.599
I don't say that just to be facetious. I'm being honest. It's a classroom that I desire. If God has

00:21:07.599 --> 00:21:12.560
that classroom for me, I want to learn the lesson as quickly as possible. But here's what I've

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:19.439
learned. When I despise the classroom of affliction, I spend more time in the classroom

00:21:19.439 --> 00:21:28.079
of affliction. Right? What happens in school when you fail a class? You get to repeat the class.

00:21:28.319 --> 00:21:35.280
You get to repeat the class. I know nowadays they have some policies and whatever that change some

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:40.079
of that, but I remember when I was going through school, you failed a class, you'd repeat the class.

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:46.000
Why? Because there were some lessons, there were some principles that you had to learn before you

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:51.599
went on. Right? And by the way, just by pushing somebody to the next class doesn't really do any

00:21:51.599 --> 00:21:58.800
favors for them because they're always behind. Right? It's always a challenge for them. And so,

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:04.640
until those principles are learned, you do not get to go to the next grade, to the next class,

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:10.400
to the next... Right? And God has this classroom of affliction. He says, these are some lessons

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:15.599
that I want you to learn. And I want to come to the place in my life, and I hope tonight as we've

00:22:15.599 --> 00:22:20.160
spent just a few minutes looking at this classroom of affliction, that you too would want to come to

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:26.000
the place in your life where we learn to appreciate the classroom of affliction, just as the psalmist

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:31.599
did, just as Paul did. And we say, Lord, teach me thy statutes. And I understand sometimes in praying

00:22:31.599 --> 00:22:38.479
that prayer, you may use the classroom of affliction. Help me not to despise it. Help me to know

00:22:39.199 --> 00:22:47.280
and to trust that you know best, and you know what classroom I need to learn what lesson.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:54.640
Amen? Let's pray. Father, we love you. We thank you so much for loving us. And we know that

00:22:58.959 --> 00:23:02.079
you're in control of everything, and you have a purpose for everything.

00:23:03.839 --> 00:23:09.359
Perhaps tonight there's one that's in the classroom of affliction. They know it.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.079
Maybe they know the lesson that you're teaching them.

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:17.599
Maybe they're so uncertain as to the lesson that you're teaching them.

00:23:20.079 --> 00:23:27.119
Perhaps even someone has despised the classroom of affliction. God, I pray that you'd help us.

00:23:28.239 --> 00:23:31.119
I'm thankful this isn't the only classroom that you have for us.

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:37.119
But we do recognize as we study your Word that this is a classroom that you have for us.

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:45.359
At times that you know best, you'll send us to this classroom of affliction.

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:50.719
And I pray that in those times that we would trust you fully and wholly,

00:23:51.839 --> 00:23:55.920
and know that you have a purpose, and help us to learn those lessons.

00:23:57.439 --> 00:24:05.280
Help us to draw closer to thee. Help us to trust you more. I pray that you'd bless our time of

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:11.280
prayer. We thank you for the privilege of corporate prayer. I pray that you'd bless

00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:16.560
the remainder of our service. For it's in Christ's name we pray. Amen.
