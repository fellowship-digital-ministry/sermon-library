1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,420
This is a springboard verse into our Bible study this evening, and for the last several

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:07,860
weeks we've been dealing with the subject matter of teach me.

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:13,439
And throughout the book of Psalms in particular, you find the plea of the psalmist when he

4
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:15,500
says teach me.

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:22,239
And what a great desire I find in that plea, a stated desire to learn, and what a blessing

6
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:24,959
it is to learn of him, amen?

7
00:00:24,959 --> 00:00:29,200
He's extended to us an invitation that we can come and learn of him.

8
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,319
We understand that he has given us the Holy Spirit of God.

9
00:00:33,319 --> 00:00:37,560
One of the ministries of the Holy Spirit is our divine teacher, and I am so thankful that

10
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,319
we serve the Lord God.

11
00:00:39,319 --> 00:00:43,000
He's given us a precious book, and he teaches us his word.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,040
When you think about that plea, teach me, we discussed, we considered the subject matter

13
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:54,479
of the purpose for learning, and really we looked at two purposes for learning.

14
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:58,680
And we said this, that one of the purposes for learning is application.

15
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,080
I learn so that I can apply the truth that I've been taught.

16
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:06,800
And we find that that is a biblical truth all throughout the Scriptures.

17
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,160
We see the importance of hearing and learning for the purpose of doing.

18
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:16,400
We understand, we quote often James 1 and verse 22, that we're to be doers of the word

19
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,120
and not hearers only.

20
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,379
And that is a principle that is taught throughout the word of God.

21
00:01:21,379 --> 00:01:27,940
We found that one of the purposes, the second purpose that we studied was that of dissemination

22
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:28,940
of truth.

23
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:33,379
I apply truth, but then I have the responsibility of giving truth.

24
00:01:33,379 --> 00:01:37,379
And we really looked at Ezra, we looked at the statement the Lord Jesus Christ made during

25
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:42,919
his Sermon on the Mount, but Ezra, the Bible tells us, was a ready scribe, and he prepared

26
00:01:42,919 --> 00:01:49,900
his heart to seek the law of the Lord, and to do it, and to teach in Israel statutes

27
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,900
and judgments.

28
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,139
We find that in Ezra 7 and verse number 10.

29
00:01:53,139 --> 00:01:59,099
And we find that Ezra had a desire to learn the truth of God's word so that he could do

30
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:04,980
it, the application of truth, and so that he could teach in Israel statutes and judgments,

31
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,480
the dissemination of truth.

32
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:10,779
And what a blessing to understand those two purposes for learning.

33
00:02:10,779 --> 00:02:15,300
Of course, I mentioned it was not an exhaustive list, but two thoughts for us with regard

34
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:20,940
to why we should take and say, as the psalmist did, teach me.

35
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:25,860
Last week, we studied the importance of having a teachable spirit.

36
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:30,059
And we looked at Acts 8, we looked at that passage of Scripture, and we said, what does

37
00:02:30,059 --> 00:02:31,860
a teachable spirit look like?

38
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,080
It begins with humility.

39
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,179
And if I want to be taught, if I'm going to be a good student and learn the truth, I must

40
00:02:40,179 --> 00:02:41,940
have humility.

41
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,820
How many people have failed to learn because of pride?

42
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:51,820
And the reality is that pride hinders learning, but humility promotes learning.

43
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,940
It allows for that teaching to take place.

44
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:58,339
And if we're going to have a teachable spirit, it's seen through humility.

45
00:02:58,339 --> 00:03:00,460
We also mentioned the desire.

46
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,300
Remember the eunuch there in Acts 8?

47
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:08,740
He responded to Philip, how can I, except some man should guide me?

48
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:09,740
That's the humility.

49
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:13,539
But then he desired Philip to come up and to teach him.

50
00:03:13,539 --> 00:03:14,539
And what a blessing.

51
00:03:14,539 --> 00:03:18,380
When we think about that teachable spirit, we asked ourselves this question as we would

52
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:23,339
evaluate our own lives, do I have a teachable spirit?

53
00:03:23,339 --> 00:03:25,699
Am I teachable?

54
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:30,720
Sometimes in life, we no doubt have had periods of time where we've sought to teach somebody

55
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,100
that wasn't teachable, or someone sought to teach us and we weren't teachable, and we

56
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,699
know how frustrating that can be.

57
00:03:37,699 --> 00:03:42,779
And what a blessing and what a great opportunity for us to be in a place where we have a teachable

58
00:03:42,779 --> 00:03:44,240
spirit.

59
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:50,000
This evening, as we continue to consider this subject matter of teach me, really, I've thought

60
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,919
about it from this perspective.

61
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:57,119
When the psalmist says, teach me, when you and I adopt that desire and we make that same

62
00:03:57,119 --> 00:04:01,320
plea to God, what is it that we desire to learn?

63
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,699
Lord, teach me, but teach me what?

64
00:04:04,699 --> 00:04:07,919
What is it that we should desire to learn?

65
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:12,080
And as we think about this, if you're taking notes, I've simply titled the lesson that

66
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,759
what should I desire to learn?

67
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:15,960
And you think about this.

68
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,640
Someone came to me recently, and it's kind of an interesting conversation, and it really

69
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:24,220
kind of was something that God brought back to my mind as I was preparing for the lesson

70
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,519
this evening.

71
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:30,359
Someone came to me recently and said, would you teach me how to be a pastor?

72
00:04:30,359 --> 00:04:33,760
Okay, what do you mean by that?

73
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:38,440
What aspect of pastoring are you interested in learning?

74
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,200
Are you interested in the public aspect of pastoring?

75
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,359
Are you interested in the private aspect of pastoring?

76
00:04:44,359 --> 00:04:47,279
You're interested in knowing how to interact with people?

77
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:49,160
Are you interested in knowing how to develop sermons?

78
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,320
Are you interested in knowing how to deal with the administration part of being a pastor?

79
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:58,760
There's so many different aspects, and so in order for me to understand the request,

80
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:04,720
I had to have a little bit more of information to understand what they meant by that question,

81
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,799
by that inquiry.

82
00:05:06,799 --> 00:05:10,880
When I say, Lord, teach me, what is it that I want them to teach me?

83
00:05:11,359 --> 00:05:15,160
Notice in Psalm 27 and in verse number 11, and really this evening we're using this as

84
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,160
a springboard.

85
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,239
I mentioned that already.

86
00:05:17,239 --> 00:05:20,880
If you are taking notes, I want you to consider some recorded requests.

87
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,880
God gives us in His Word some recorded requests, some things that the psalmist specifically

88
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,799
says, Lord, teach me this.

89
00:05:28,799 --> 00:05:32,119
We'll look at a couple of other examples within the scriptures.

90
00:05:32,119 --> 00:05:35,959
So look at this one in Psalm 27 and verse number 11.

91
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:44,720
Teach me Thy way, O Lord, and lead me in a plain path because of mine enemies.

92
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,799
Oh, man, I need to know the way that God has for me, amen?

93
00:05:48,799 --> 00:05:54,480
And the plan, the path that God has laid before us, in fact, in Psalm 25 and verse number

94
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:59,640
4, he uses that phraseology that God would teach him, Thy paths.

95
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:07,239
He says in Psalm 25 and verse number 4, show me Thy ways, O Lord, teach me Thy paths.

96
00:06:07,239 --> 00:06:12,239
I'm so thankful that God provides leadership and direction in the lives of His children.

97
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:15,720
We understand in the Old Testament, you think about the wilderness wanderings.

98
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,679
They had the pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night, and how it provided

99
00:06:20,679 --> 00:06:26,000
direction for the people of God as they wandered, and when the pillar of cloud or the pillar

100
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,980
of fire stopped, they stopped, and that's where they set up camp.

101
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:34,140
And then, as the pillar moved, indicating the presence of God moving, they would follow.

102
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:39,140
And today, we have the Word of God, we have the Spirit of God, and we say to God, teach

103
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:45,079
me Thy way, teach me Thy paths, show me the ways in which I ought to go.

104
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:50,739
We find that this is one of these recorded requests that we find within the Word of God.

105
00:06:50,739 --> 00:06:56,179
The psalmist says in Psalm 119 a number of times, we'll just look at one of the references,

106
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:01,820
but there's a number of times in Psalm 119, six times actually, that the psalmist says,

107
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,540
teach me Thy statutes.

108
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:09,339
We know that Psalm 119 is a psalm that is dedicated to the Word of God, and much information

109
00:07:09,339 --> 00:07:14,940
given with regard to the love that the psalmist has for the Word of God, the place that the

110
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:19,579
Word of God has in the life of the psalmist, what the Word of God does for the psalmist.

111
00:07:19,579 --> 00:07:23,619
And we could study through the portion of Scripture and be helped immensely, but we

112
00:07:23,619 --> 00:07:28,059
find that in verse number 26, the Bible says this, it says in verse number 12 as well,

113
00:07:28,059 --> 00:07:33,859
but look in verse number 26, I have declared my ways and thou heardest me, teach me thy

114
00:07:33,859 --> 00:07:34,859
statutes.

115
00:07:34,859 --> 00:07:40,380
As we look through Psalm 119, we find that the psalmist uses the word thy statutes, or

116
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:49,779
the phrase, thy statutes, thy word, thy judgments, he uses these phraseologies, thy law, to refer

117
00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:51,980
to the Word of God.

118
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:56,140
What a great request, Lord, teach me this book, teach me thy word.

119
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,779
I want to have an understanding.

120
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:04,000
He says this in verse number 18, open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things

121
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
out of thy law.

122
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,700
What a great prayer, what a great request to learn the Word of God.

123
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:15,140
In Psalm 119, in verse number 66, notice the psalmist makes this request as we consider

124
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:21,660
these recorded requests, he says, teach me good judgment and knowledge, for I have believed

125
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,500
thy commandments.

126
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:28,220
Good judgment and knowledge is the request that is mentioned by the psalmist here in

127
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,500
verse number 66.

128
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:36,780
I think about the situation there with Solomon, when God appeared to Solomon, and He said

129
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:40,780
to Solomon, ask what I shall give thee, and what did Solomon request?

130
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:41,780
Wisdom.

131
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:42,780
Wisdom.

132
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:47,659
God, give me wisdom to lead this great people, your people.

133
00:08:47,659 --> 00:08:49,299
Give me wisdom.

134
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:52,419
The Word of God tells us that God granted that request.

135
00:08:52,419 --> 00:08:57,659
God gave Solomon wisdom, in fact, he's the wisest man according to the Scriptures, and

136
00:08:57,659 --> 00:09:00,500
we find that that request was granted.

137
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:07,820
In Psalm 143, notice if you turn over several chapters, in Psalm 143, the Word of God tells

138
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:13,099
us in verse number 10 that there's another recorded request here, and what a blessing

139
00:09:13,099 --> 00:09:17,859
as we think about this truth, as we would ask the Lord to teach us His ways and His

140
00:09:17,859 --> 00:09:22,900
path, His statutes, we find here that the Bible says this in Psalm 143 in verse number

141
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:27,780
10, teach me to do thy will.

142
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:32,500
For thou art my God, thy spirit is good, lead me into the land of uprightness.

143
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,859
Think about that, teach me to do thy will.

144
00:09:34,859 --> 00:09:39,159
You know, the reality is that we can know something but not do it.

145
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:42,780
We can have an understanding of something but not apply it.

146
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:49,780
And here, the psalmist, the request of David in Psalm 143 is teach me to do thy will.

147
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:55,020
Yes, God, reveal Your will to me, reveal Your plan to me, but teach me to do it.

148
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,340
Not just to know it.

149
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:59,900
What a sad thing to know what God wants us to do but then sit on the sidelines and not

150
00:09:59,900 --> 00:09:59,900


151
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:07,660
it, right? We're to do what He's given us to do. Think about this. We'll kind of, Psalm 90, if you

152
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:10,780
turn back, I know we're kind of going back and forth here, but I just want to share some of these

153
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:17,580
recorded requests, and perhaps we could adopt some of these for ourselves this evening. In Psalm 90

154
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:25,020
and verse number 12, this is a psalm that is attributed to Moses, and the Bible tells us this.

155
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:29,020
It's a verse that we're familiar with, actually, Psalm 90 and verse number 12. Notice this,

156
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:36,940
so teach us what? Teach us to number our days. Teach us to number our days that we may apply our

157
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:45,420
hearts unto wisdom. Lord, teach us to number our days. Are we not keenly aware of the brevity of

158
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:50,700
life? As we study the Word of God, as we study the Scriptures, we understand the Bible tells us

159
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:55,020
that our life is but a vapor that appears for a little time and then vanisheth away.

160
00:10:55,020 --> 00:11:00,620
And the reality is that we ought to pray and ask God to teach us, as the psalm tells us in Psalm 90

161
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:06,540
and verse number 12, teach us, Lord, to number our days. Help us that we may apply our hearts

162
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:13,500
unto wisdom. The New Testament tells us that we're to redeem the time and that we are stewards of

163
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:20,700
that which God has blessed us with. I think about the request that is made in Judges chapter number

164
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:30,220
13, and this is a request that is made, and a request that every parent ought to make. And

165
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:37,500
here in this passage of Scripture, we find that the angel of God had appeared and had let the

166
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:43,180
couple know that they were going to have a child, and Manoah wasn't there, but then he's

167
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:49,900
there. And the Bible tells us in Judges 13 and verse number 8, notice the request at the end of

168
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:55,900
the verse, it says, then Manoah entreated the Lord and said, O my Lord, let the man of God,

169
00:11:55,900 --> 00:12:02,300
which thou didst send, come again unto us, notice this, and teach us what we shall do unto the child

170
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:10,300
that shall be born. I remember when Holly told me that she was expecting Juliana, and I remember

171
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:18,060
that thought that overcame me of, am I ready to be a father? Am I ready for this role that now

172
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:25,740
I have to fulfill? And I was very much aware of the fact that I needed God to help me to understand

173
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:31,580
how to parent and what to do, and Manoah makes this great request. We're familiar with the

174
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:37,100
request of the disciples in Luke chapter number 11. We won't turn there for sake of time,

175
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:43,020
but in Luke chapter number 11, the disciples come to the Lord Jesus Christ, and they say, Lord,

176
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:51,180
teach us to pray. Teach us to pray. That's a good request, is it not? Teach us to pray.

177
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:57,820
I did a series on that on Wednesday evenings last year, and I said this when we had that series,

178
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:01,580
that of all the things the disciples could have asked the Lord to teach them,

179
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:06,380
the only thing that we have recorded within the Word of God that they requested was teach us

180
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:13,980
to pray. Teach us to pray. And oh, that God would teach us to pray. Teach us to pray.

181
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:18,380
So, we think about some of these recorded requests, and I would encourage you to do

182
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:24,220
some Bible study and to consider some other portions of Scripture that we see where the

183
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:30,140
people of God prayed and asked God specifically, teach me this. It's important that we would have

184
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:35,020
that teachable spirit. It's important that we desire to be taught, that we might learn the

185
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:42,540
Word of God, learn the truths of God, but the reality is that when we put some specific nature

186
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:47,580
to that request, it helps us to go into a particular area. So, we think about these

187
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:52,140
recorded requests, perhaps this evening, if you're taking notes number two, I want you to consider

188
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:56,300
some relevant recommendations. I'm going to give you some recommendations this evening

189
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:02,540
as to what it is that we should say, Lord, teach me. Teach me. Teach me what? What is it that you

190
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:07,740
want me to teach you? Someone comes to you and says, they've observed you and say, would you teach me?

191
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:11,660
What are you going to say? What do you want me to teach you, right? What is it that you would like

192
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:15,820
to learn? What is it that you'd like for me to teach you? Now, someone comes to me and asks me

193
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:20,300
to teach them certain things. I'm not capable of teaching certain things because I don't know how

194
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:25,660
to do them, but we know that we serve the Lord God Almighty. He's given us this precious book,

195
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:31,340
and He's able to teach us. Let me give you this recommendation. Number one, we should desire that

196
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:38,220
God would teach us who He is, who He is. You know, today we live in a society in which many people

197
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:44,060
have a misunderstanding of who God is. They do not understand the God of the Bible. They do not know

198
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:48,940
His nature nor His character. There are people that sit within churches all across this land

199
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:55,820
that do not know the God of the Bible. They've allowed for the culture. They've allowed for

200
00:14:55,820 --> 00:15:01,820
Hollywood. They've allowed for politics. They've allowed for all sorts of people to influence them

201
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:07,660
with regard to who God is. But God's given us this precious book, and He has revealed to us His

202
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:13,820
nature, and He's revealed to us who He is. Paul said this, probably from our perspective, one of

203
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:18,860
the greatest Christians that ever walked upon the face of the earth. He said that I may know Him.

204
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:23,740
Now, think about that. In Philippians 3 and verse number 10, he's in prison awaiting his execution,

205
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:29,980
and he says that I may know Him. He wants to know God in a greater way. He wants to know God in a

206
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:36,140
more intimate way. And when we understand this tonight, what an important aspect that we'd say,

207
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:43,340
Lord, teach me who You are. Teach me Your attributes. Teach me Your nature. Because the reality is that

208
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:50,860
when we understand in a greater way who our God is, it increases our faith. It helps us to trust Him.

209
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:57,260
It helps us to walk in obedience to Him. Why? Because we know who He is. When we begin to go to

210
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:02,780
the Word of God, and we begin to seek the Word of God with regard to some of these other areas in

211
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:09,260
which I'll mention this evening, the reality is if we don't first know who God is, it can trouble

212
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:16,060
the findings that we discover with regard to other areas of our lives, with regard to pleasing Him,

213
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:22,140
because we do not understand how much He loves us and how He has our best interest in mind. See,

214
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:28,700
God knows us. God formed us. Let me say this. He knows what's best for us. Amen? You believe that

215
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:34,220
tonight? I believe that with all my heart. I sat across the table from someone a few years ago,

216
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:38,860
and they said, well, preacher, let me just tell you this. God wants me to be happy.

217
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:50,860
And then they said this, and this makes me happy. Well, I got a whole bucket load of verses that

218
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:58,140
teach us that we're not supposed to do this, and so this can't be in connection with what you

219
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:02,620
understand. Here's the problem with that individual. They didn't understand the love of God.

220
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:09,660
They didn't understand who God was. They had this misconception that God loves me and God wants me

221
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:16,220
to be happy, and so therefore, if this behavior or this activity makes me happy, then by default,

222
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:25,260
God must be okay with it. It's not the truth of God's Word. Amen? And when we understand who God

223
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:32,380
is and we understand that God as the Creator has given us truth that will help us know how we're

224
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:37,900
to live our lives and how we can please Him, and when we come to those portions and passages of

225
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:43,900
Scripture that God is giving us that instruction, when we have that understanding of who He is and

226
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:50,300
how much He loves us, it helps us to submit to it and to learn what He's trying to teach us.

227
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:55,260
And so first, we ought to pray that God would teach us who He is. As I've mentioned before,

228
00:17:55,900 --> 00:18:00,540
many of us have some understanding of who God is, but can I tell you this? His greatness is

229
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:06,380
unsearchable, according to Psalm 145. I'll stand with anyone and say, I know that the Lord is great.

230
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:11,260
He is. He's a great God. He's revealed His greatness to me. I stand in awe of who He is,

231
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:15,980
but I'd say this, I only scratch the surface of understanding the infinite God.

232
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:24,300
My finite mind cannot fully comprehend the infinite God, and neither can yours. Amen? So,

233
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:30,460
we ought to daily say, Lord, teach me who You are. Help me to understand in a greater way

234
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:37,500
Your attributes and Your nature. Let me say this, when I ask God to teach us His plan,

235
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:43,260
what is God's plan? We mentioned about the recorded request of Thy paths and Thy way,

236
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:49,580
but I think about this, when we, as the people of God living in 2022, that we say, what is Your plan,

237
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:56,860
God? What is Your plan for today? We know that He has established the church. It is His

238
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:04,619
establishment. It is the organism that God has chosen to use in this period of history,

239
00:19:04,619 --> 00:19:11,100
and the church is not man's idea. It's not the result of Constantine or anyone else. It is

240
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:19,100
God's plan. It is God's idea. And God is the head of the church, and He has a plan for His church.

241
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:24,220
And so, we understand, we say, God, what is Your plan for today? What is Your plan for today with

242
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:32,059
the church? What is Your plan? God has given us in His Word His plan for reaching this world with

243
00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:39,180
the gospel of Jesus Christ. So often, we neglect to just simply go to the Word of God and say,

244
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:44,860
okay, what is God's plan? Okay, here's what God's plan is. Let's do it, right? Remember the truth

245
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:50,300
of Psalm 143 and verse number 10, teach me to do Thy will. Sometimes we like to just sit around

246
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:54,460
and have seminars talking about what we already know needs to be done instead of just doing it.

247
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:59,740
And I want to know what God's plan is for today.

248
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,820
How about God's plan for the future?

249
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:05,460
What's God's plan for the future?

250
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,300
He's given us prophecy.

251
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:10,340
I'm thankful for the prophecy that He's given us.

252
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:16,540
We cannot neglect today for the purpose of studying prophecy, but there should be a balance.

253
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:22,740
But as we study prophecy, it helps us to understand God's plan and what God's timeline is and

254
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:27,020
what His timetable is and what are the next events and what is it that's going to happen.

255
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:31,900
And we think about that truth of prophecy, and I'm thankful that our God is Alpha and

256
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:38,260
Omega, that He knows the end from the beginning, and that He can give us in this recorded book

257
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:41,100
His plan for the ages.

258
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,340
Amen?

259
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,980
And what a blessing that is.

260
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,580
I say, God, I want to know your plan.

261
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,980
Let me say this.

262
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:52,740
If I think about this relevant request or recommendation, a relevant recommendation,

263
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:56,460
I would say not only knowing who God is and knowing what God's plan is, but let me say

264
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,460
this.

265
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,900
What is my place within God's plan?

266
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:03,580
God, what is my place within your plan?

267
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,900
I understand, God, that you have a plan.

268
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:10,820
I understand that your plan is to use the local church, and God, I understand that I

269
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,380
am part of the local church.

270
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,460
What's your plan for me?

271
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:17,860
What is my place within your plan?

272
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:21,500
I believe tonight that we all have a place within God's plan.

273
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,500
Amen?

274
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:26,380
If God didn't have a place for you within His plan, you wouldn't be here still.

275
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,380
Amen?

276
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:32,460
But if you're living and you're breathing, and you are, because you're here tonight,

277
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:37,500
the reality is that God has a place for you within His plan.

278
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,300
You say, well, I don't know what my place is.

279
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:45,540
That's why we say, Lord, teach me your place, my place within your plan, and we ask God

280
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,540
to show us.

281
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:52,620
Listen, the Word of God teaches us in 1 Peter chapter number 4 that every man has received

282
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,460
a spiritual gift.

283
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,340
The Bible teaches us the book of 1 Corinthians.

284
00:21:56,340 --> 00:22:00,800
If you look through chapters really 12 through 15 and look at those portions of Scripture,

285
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:06,900
you find that the Word of God teaches us that the Spirit equips and gifts every believer

286
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,480
as He will.

287
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:15,160
And the Bible tells us that He equips us spiritually for the purpose of edification, for the purpose

288
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,660
of the church.

289
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:23,120
The Word of God likens the church to a body, and every member is of importance.

290
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,480
I'm thankful that I have a left hand and a right hand.

291
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,480
I'm thankful that I have a thumb on each of my hands.

292
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,520
I'm thankful that I got ears and eyes.

293
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,920
It'd be a terrible thing if we had four eyes or four ears and none of the other, right?

294
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:40,560
I mean, you think about the truth, and here's the reality when you look at what Paul says

295
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,000
to the believers in Corinth.

296
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,040
He says, listen, the eye can't say to the...and you understand what he's saying, listen, I'm

297
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,560
of more importance than you are.

298
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:52,760
No, every member has its purpose and its place.

299
00:22:52,760 --> 00:23:00,720
And God has uniquely designed the human body, but He's also uniquely designed the church,

300
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,720
and He builds His church.

301
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,440
You remember Bezalel in the Old Testament?

302
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:11,920
Bezalel was the man that God particularly, specifically equipped, not only to perform

303
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:17,280
the work of getting things ready for the tabernacle, but also to teach others.

304
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:21,960
It was Moses that received all of the instruction, the pattern that was to be followed, but it

305
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:28,060
was Bezalel that God had specifically equipped for doing that work, Bezalel and Aholiab.

306
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:31,520
And you look at that, and you see what God did and how God blessed.

307
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,900
You say, God, what is my place within your plan?

308
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,760
What is my involvement within the church?

309
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:43,360
The Bible tells us in Philippians 1, in verse number 27, that we are to strive together

310
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,960
for the faith of the gospel.

311
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,960
Striving together.

312
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:53,480
We understand that we are laborers, co-laborers, one with another, we're co-laborers with God.

313
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,800
Remember what Paul said?

314
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,060
He said, who then is Paul?

315
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,520
Who is Apollos?

316
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,120
Some plant, some water, but God gives the increase.

317
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,720
What is my place within the church?

318
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,760
What is my involvement in the local church?

319
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,280
What is my involvement within the Great Commission?

320
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:17,040
If the Great Commission has been given, and God's Great Commission, His last words to

321
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:23,160
the church remain our marching orders today, what part of fulfilling the Great Commission

322
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,460
am I fulfilling?

323
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:28,960
What involvement do I have in fulfilling the Great Commission?

324
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:34,520
If this is God's program, if this is God's plan, and God is teaching me what His plan

325
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:38,040
is for today, I say, God, what's my place in that plan?

326
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:41,800
I want to be involved in what God's doing in the world, amen?

327
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,320
And God chose that He uses people.

328
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,200
Aren't you thankful for that?

329
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,520
He said, I'm going to use people, human beings, my children.

330
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,260
I'm going to equip them.

331
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:58,280
They are my workmanship created in Christ Jesus.

332
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:03,340
I'm going to equip them, I'm going to enable them, and then I'm going to bless them for

333
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:06,000
doing what I've told them to do.

334
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,720
That's a good deal, amen?

335
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,640
He equips us, He enables us, and then He blesses us.

336
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,960
It's amazing.

337
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,600
God, what's my place within Your plan?

338
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,880
Let me say this in closing this evening.

339
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:26,280
I would say that we could pray and ask God to teach me, teach me how I can please Him.

340
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:31,000
You know, 1 Corinthians chapter number 10 tells us of some Old Testament biblical accounts

341
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,260
where the Bible says that with many of them, God was not well-pleased.

342
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:39,760
I do not desire that it would be said of my life, and I do not desire that it would be

343
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:44,080
said of your life, that God is not well-pleased, amen?

344
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,360
I want to please Him, I want to please Him.

345
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:54,760
The first part of Proverbs 16 and verse number 7 says, when a man's ways please the Lord,

346
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:58,760
when a man's ways please the Lord.

347
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:04,760
I want my ways to please God, but how am I going to know?

348
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:10,120
In the book of Ephesians in chapter 5 and verse number 10, God says this, as Paul is

349
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:15,960
writing to those believers in Ephesus, he says, proving what is acceptable unto the

350
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,960
Lord.

351
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,960
Lord, teach me how to please You.

352
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:26,160
Teach me how to live my life in such a way that it is pleasing in Your sight.

353
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:31,600
That's a great prayer request, that's a great teach-me request, that's a, I believe, a relevant

354
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:36,280
recommendation that we take in our lives today, and we say, Lord, teach me how I can please

355
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,280
You.

356
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,520
Can I say this, and I'm not going to look at any verses of Scripture, I'm just going

357
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:44,640
to go quickly through it this evening in closing, but the reality is that if you want to know

358
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:50,400
how to be a husband, go to this book, amen?

359
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,680
You want to know how to be a wife?

360
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,600
Go to this book.

361
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,160
You want to know how to be a parent?

362
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,080
Go to this book.

363
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,080
You want to know how to be a child?

364
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,540
I know we don't have any children in here, but for our children, one of the first verses

365
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:08,040
we taught our children to memorize, children, obey your parents in the Lord, amen?

366
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,040
It's Bible.

367
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,800
I'm trying to teach them, why?

368
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:15,560
Because when they please their parents, they're pleasing God, amen?

369
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,320
Honor thy father and mother.

370
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:20,960
Teach the first commandment with promise, amen?

371
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,320
So you want to know how to be a good child?

372
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,320
You better get in the book.

373
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,720
You better get in the Word of God.

374
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,720
Think about this.

375
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:30,960
Personally, if I want to be a good pastor, the Word of God teaches me how to be a pastor.

376
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,520
The Word of God teaches and talks about being a good minister, and it qualifies it.

377
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,640
If you do this, then you're a good minister, all right?

378
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,680
I want to be a good pastor.

379
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,100
I want to please God as a pastor.

380
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:46,920
The place that He's called me within His plan, I want to be a good pastor.

381
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,520
How do I do that?

382
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,520
Well, He says, feed the flock of God.

383
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:53,000
Yes, sir, I'm going to do my best to feed the flock of God.

384
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,920
I'm going to study and prepare and pray and seek to deliver to the best of my ability

385
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,640
and with God's help, the Word of God.

386
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,640
Why?

387
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,640
Because that's my responsibility.

388
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,440
You want to be a good church member?

389
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:11,600
The Word of God teaches us how to be a good church member.

390
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,760
Titus chapter number 2, go through it.

391
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,520
The aged men, they're supposed to do this.

392
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,600
The aged women, they're supposed to do this.

393
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,640
You look at God's Word teaches us.

394
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,880
You want to be a good church member?

395
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,880
Go to the book.

396
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,960
Go to the Word of God.

397
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,360
God teach me to be a good church member.

398
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,400
God teach me to be a good pastor.

399
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,080
Teach me to be a good neighbor.

400
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,400
Teach me to be a good friend, a co-worker, an employee, an employer.

401
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,280
All of these things are found within the Word of God.

402
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:40,600
God, I'm having a hard time at work.

403
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,920
Teach me how to, right?

404
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,000
It works.

405
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,520
And when we add some qualifiers, if you will, to this desire of teach me, and really that's

406
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:56,280
my desire this evening, to help us just think of what is it that we're saying, Lord, teach

407
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,560
me.

408
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:01,920
We're going to look at over the next several weeks of how God teaches His children.

409
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:05,280
God uses a variety of classrooms.

410
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:09,980
And sometimes those classrooms aren't always easy, but God uses a variety of classrooms

411
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,740
to teach His children.

412
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:16,340
And as He teaches us, that's why I've often said over the years that the reality is that

413
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:21,900
we need to be careful that we understand that God can always deliver us from everything

414
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:24,480
that we face.

415
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:32,100
At times, however, God is more interested in developing us than in delivering us.

416
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,860
It doesn't mean He can't deliver us.

417
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:37,380
It just means He wants to develop us.

418
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:41,460
And sometimes when we go through a trial and we go through a circumstance, an adversity,

419
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:46,820
a problem in our lives, instead of us praying, God, deliver me from this, perhaps we should

420
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:51,820
pray, God, teach me what You want to teach me through this.

421
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:57,300
Help me, Lord, to learn that even in this difficulty that You're real and that You have

422
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,660
a plan.

423
00:29:58,660 --> 00:29:59,660
Teach me.

424
00:29:59,660 --> 00:29:59,660


425
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:05,980
teaching us that His grace is sufficient, right? Is that what Paul said? He besought

426
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:11,980
the Lord thrice, and God said, Paul, my grace is sufficient for thee. Amen? God's grace

427
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:20,360
is sufficient. We find this evening we could speak about a whole host of things, areas

428
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:26,700
of our lives, but tonight I hope that as we would consider this thought, teach me, that

429
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:32,380
we would say, what are some things, what should I desire to learn? Teach me. Teach me what?

430
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:38,380
Lord, teach me who you are. I want to know you in a more intimate way. I want to know

431
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:45,300
you in a greater way. I want to stand in awe of who you are. God, teach me what your plan

432
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:55,340
is. Why did you leave us here? What's your plan for today? How do I fit within your plan?

433
00:30:55,340 --> 00:31:02,220
What is my place within your plan, God? And then, God, how can I please you with my life?

434
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:07,420
Because I want to hear, well done, thou good and faithful servant. Don't you? I want to

435
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:14,880
hear that. I want to be pleasing in God's sight. I want God to be pleased with me. Think

436
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:21,320
about these words, and I'll close with this. Paul says this in 2 Timothy 2, as he's writing

437
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:27,560
to Timothy, his son in the faith. In 2 Timothy 2, in verse 4, he says,

438
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:32,440
No man that werth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life, that he may please

439
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:39,580
him who hath chosen him to be a soldier. You know who chose us to be a soldier? The Lord.

440
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:45,240
Amen? He talks about being a good soldier in verse 3, but the reality is that we want

441
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:49,880
to please him. I want to please him. Some of you have been in the military. I grew up

442
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:57,280
around the military, and there's an aspect of desiring to please, humanly speaking, a

443
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:04,120
superior ranking official. When you have inspection, I remember my dad spending hours preparing

444
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:08,520
for inspections, and I remember as a kid thinking, Dad, why can't you do this? Why can't you

445
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:11,760
do that? Why can't we go play? Why can't we what? Why do you have to get ready for this

446
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:17,000
inspection? Because some commanding officer somewhere was going to come and inspect them,

447
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,880
and they wanted to be pleasing, right? They didn't want to have problems and difficulties.

448
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:27,020
He didn't want to. So he put in the time to make sure that he could stand in that formation

449
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:32,320
and go through that inspection. Oh, think about it from a heavenly perspective. We have

450
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:40,520
a great God. We have a great God. He saved us, changed our lives. Oh, I want to please

451
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:46,000
him with my life. If you want to please him, this book will tell you how you can please

452
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:52,840
him, and it will provide you with warnings of things not to do that will displease him.

453
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:57,680
Those are of equal importance. Amen? Paul says, I warn you. I warn you why? Because

454
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:05,360
I love you. God's warnings are for our benefits. Amen? And what a great God we serve. Teach

455
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:09,760
me. Teach me what? What is it that I should desire to learn? I hope this evening that

456
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:17,800
we have a host of things that we can add to our prayer list of, God, teach me. Teach

457
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:23,160
me these things. Let's pray together. Father, we love you. We thank you for loving us. We

458
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:30,280
thank you that you are the divine teacher, and I pray that you'd help us, God, to be

459
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:39,400
desirous of learning, that we'd have that teachable spirit, that, God, we'd pray specifically

460
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:44,480
of things that we desire that you'd teach us. Help us to please you with our lives.

461
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:48,960
Bless our time of prayer. Thank you for the privilege. Pray that you would bless, and
