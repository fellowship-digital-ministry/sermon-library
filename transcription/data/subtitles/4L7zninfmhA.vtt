00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.420
This is a springboard verse into our Bible study this evening, and for the last several

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.860
weeks we've been dealing with the subject matter of teach me.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:13.439
And throughout the book of Psalms in particular, you find the plea of the psalmist when he

00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:15.500
says teach me.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:22.239
And what a great desire I find in that plea, a stated desire to learn, and what a blessing

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:24.959
it is to learn of him, amen?

00:00:24.959 --> 00:00:29.200
He's extended to us an invitation that we can come and learn of him.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.319
We understand that he has given us the Holy Spirit of God.

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:37.560
One of the ministries of the Holy Spirit is our divine teacher, and I am so thankful that

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.319
we serve the Lord God.

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:43.000
He's given us a precious book, and he teaches us his word.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.040
When you think about that plea, teach me, we discussed, we considered the subject matter

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.479
of the purpose for learning, and really we looked at two purposes for learning.

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:58.680
And we said this, that one of the purposes for learning is application.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.080
I learn so that I can apply the truth that I've been taught.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.800
And we find that that is a biblical truth all throughout the Scriptures.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.160
We see the importance of hearing and learning for the purpose of doing.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.400
We understand, we quote often James 1 and verse 22, that we're to be doers of the word

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.120
and not hearers only.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.379
And that is a principle that is taught throughout the word of God.

00:01:21.379 --> 00:01:27.940
We found that one of the purposes, the second purpose that we studied was that of dissemination

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:28.940
of truth.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.379
I apply truth, but then I have the responsibility of giving truth.

00:01:33.379 --> 00:01:37.379
And we really looked at Ezra, we looked at the statement the Lord Jesus Christ made during

00:01:37.379 --> 00:01:42.919
his Sermon on the Mount, but Ezra, the Bible tells us, was a ready scribe, and he prepared

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:49.900
his heart to seek the law of the Lord, and to do it, and to teach in Israel statutes

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:50.900
and judgments.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.139
We find that in Ezra 7 and verse number 10.

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:59.099
And we find that Ezra had a desire to learn the truth of God's word so that he could do

00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:04.980
it, the application of truth, and so that he could teach in Israel statutes and judgments,

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.480
the dissemination of truth.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.779
And what a blessing to understand those two purposes for learning.

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:15.300
Of course, I mentioned it was not an exhaustive list, but two thoughts for us with regard

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.940
to why we should take and say, as the psalmist did, teach me.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.860
Last week, we studied the importance of having a teachable spirit.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.059
And we looked at Acts 8, we looked at that passage of Scripture, and we said, what does

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:31.860
a teachable spirit look like?

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.080
It begins with humility.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:40.179
And if I want to be taught, if I'm going to be a good student and learn the truth, I must

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:41.940
have humility.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.820
How many people have failed to learn because of pride?

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:51.820
And the reality is that pride hinders learning, but humility promotes learning.

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.940
It allows for that teaching to take place.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.339
And if we're going to have a teachable spirit, it's seen through humility.

00:02:58.339 --> 00:03:00.460
We also mentioned the desire.

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.300
Remember the eunuch there in Acts 8?

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.740
He responded to Philip, how can I, except some man should guide me?

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:09.740
That's the humility.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.539
But then he desired Philip to come up and to teach him.

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:14.539
And what a blessing.

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:18.380
When we think about that teachable spirit, we asked ourselves this question as we would

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.339
evaluate our own lives, do I have a teachable spirit?

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:25.699
Am I teachable?

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:30.720
Sometimes in life, we no doubt have had periods of time where we've sought to teach somebody

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.100
that wasn't teachable, or someone sought to teach us and we weren't teachable, and we

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.699
know how frustrating that can be.

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:42.779
And what a blessing and what a great opportunity for us to be in a place where we have a teachable

00:03:42.779 --> 00:03:44.240
spirit.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:50.000
This evening, as we continue to consider this subject matter of teach me, really, I've thought

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.919
about it from this perspective.

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:57.119
When the psalmist says, teach me, when you and I adopt that desire and we make that same

00:03:57.119 --> 00:04:01.320
plea to God, what is it that we desire to learn?

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.699
Lord, teach me, but teach me what?

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:07.919
What is it that we should desire to learn?

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:12.080
And as we think about this, if you're taking notes, I've simply titled the lesson that

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.759
what should I desire to learn?

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:15.960
And you think about this.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.640
Someone came to me recently, and it's kind of an interesting conversation, and it really

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:24.220
kind of was something that God brought back to my mind as I was preparing for the lesson

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.519
this evening.

00:04:25.519 --> 00:04:30.359
Someone came to me recently and said, would you teach me how to be a pastor?

00:04:30.359 --> 00:04:33.760
Okay, what do you mean by that?

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.440
What aspect of pastoring are you interested in learning?

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.200
Are you interested in the public aspect of pastoring?

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.359
Are you interested in the private aspect of pastoring?

00:04:44.359 --> 00:04:47.279
You're interested in knowing how to interact with people?

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:49.160
Are you interested in knowing how to develop sermons?

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.320
Are you interested in knowing how to deal with the administration part of being a pastor?

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.760
There's so many different aspects, and so in order for me to understand the request,

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:04.720
I had to have a little bit more of information to understand what they meant by that question,

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.799
by that inquiry.

00:05:06.799 --> 00:05:10.880
When I say, Lord, teach me, what is it that I want them to teach me?

00:05:11.359 --> 00:05:15.160
Notice in Psalm 27 and in verse number 11, and really this evening we're using this as

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.160
a springboard.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.239
I mentioned that already.

00:05:17.239 --> 00:05:20.880
If you are taking notes, I want you to consider some recorded requests.

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:26.880
God gives us in His Word some recorded requests, some things that the psalmist specifically

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.799
says, Lord, teach me this.

00:05:28.799 --> 00:05:32.119
We'll look at a couple of other examples within the scriptures.

00:05:32.119 --> 00:05:35.959
So look at this one in Psalm 27 and verse number 11.

00:05:35.959 --> 00:05:44.720
Teach me Thy way, O Lord, and lead me in a plain path because of mine enemies.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.799
Oh, man, I need to know the way that God has for me, amen?

00:05:48.799 --> 00:05:54.480
And the plan, the path that God has laid before us, in fact, in Psalm 25 and verse number

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:59.640
4, he uses that phraseology that God would teach him, Thy paths.

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:07.239
He says in Psalm 25 and verse number 4, show me Thy ways, O Lord, teach me Thy paths.

00:06:07.239 --> 00:06:12.239
I'm so thankful that God provides leadership and direction in the lives of His children.

00:06:12.239 --> 00:06:15.720
We understand in the Old Testament, you think about the wilderness wanderings.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:20.679
They had the pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night, and how it provided

00:06:20.679 --> 00:06:26.000
direction for the people of God as they wandered, and when the pillar of cloud or the pillar

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.980
of fire stopped, they stopped, and that's where they set up camp.

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:34.140
And then, as the pillar moved, indicating the presence of God moving, they would follow.

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:39.140
And today, we have the Word of God, we have the Spirit of God, and we say to God, teach

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:45.079
me Thy way, teach me Thy paths, show me the ways in which I ought to go.

00:06:45.079 --> 00:06:50.739
We find that this is one of these recorded requests that we find within the Word of God.

00:06:50.739 --> 00:06:56.179
The psalmist says in Psalm 119 a number of times, we'll just look at one of the references,

00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:01.820
but there's a number of times in Psalm 119, six times actually, that the psalmist says,

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:03.540
teach me Thy statutes.

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:09.339
We know that Psalm 119 is a psalm that is dedicated to the Word of God, and much information

00:07:09.339 --> 00:07:14.940
given with regard to the love that the psalmist has for the Word of God, the place that the

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:19.579
Word of God has in the life of the psalmist, what the Word of God does for the psalmist.

00:07:19.579 --> 00:07:23.619
And we could study through the portion of Scripture and be helped immensely, but we

00:07:23.619 --> 00:07:28.059
find that in verse number 26, the Bible says this, it says in verse number 12 as well,

00:07:28.059 --> 00:07:33.859
but look in verse number 26, I have declared my ways and thou heardest me, teach me thy

00:07:33.859 --> 00:07:34.859
statutes.

00:07:34.859 --> 00:07:40.380
As we look through Psalm 119, we find that the psalmist uses the word thy statutes, or

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:49.779
the phrase, thy statutes, thy word, thy judgments, he uses these phraseologies, thy law, to refer

00:07:49.779 --> 00:07:51.980
to the Word of God.

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:56.140
What a great request, Lord, teach me this book, teach me thy word.

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:58.779
I want to have an understanding.

00:07:58.779 --> 00:08:04.000
He says this in verse number 18, open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000
out of thy law.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.700
What a great prayer, what a great request to learn the Word of God.

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:15.140
In Psalm 119, in verse number 66, notice the psalmist makes this request as we consider

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:21.660
these recorded requests, he says, teach me good judgment and knowledge, for I have believed

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:23.500
thy commandments.

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:28.220
Good judgment and knowledge is the request that is mentioned by the psalmist here in

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:29.500
verse number 66.

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:36.780
I think about the situation there with Solomon, when God appeared to Solomon, and He said

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:40.780
to Solomon, ask what I shall give thee, and what did Solomon request?

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:41.780
Wisdom.

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:42.780
Wisdom.

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:47.659
God, give me wisdom to lead this great people, your people.

00:08:47.659 --> 00:08:49.299
Give me wisdom.

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:52.419
The Word of God tells us that God granted that request.

00:08:52.419 --> 00:08:57.659
God gave Solomon wisdom, in fact, he's the wisest man according to the Scriptures, and

00:08:57.659 --> 00:09:00.500
we find that that request was granted.

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:07.820
In Psalm 143, notice if you turn over several chapters, in Psalm 143, the Word of God tells

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:13.099
us in verse number 10 that there's another recorded request here, and what a blessing

00:09:13.099 --> 00:09:17.859
as we think about this truth, as we would ask the Lord to teach us His ways and His

00:09:17.859 --> 00:09:22.900
path, His statutes, we find here that the Bible says this in Psalm 143 in verse number

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:27.780
10, teach me to do thy will.

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:32.500
For thou art my God, thy spirit is good, lead me into the land of uprightness.

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:34.859
Think about that, teach me to do thy will.

00:09:34.859 --> 00:09:39.159
You know, the reality is that we can know something but not do it.

00:09:39.159 --> 00:09:42.780
We can have an understanding of something but not apply it.

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:49.780
And here, the psalmist, the request of David in Psalm 143 is teach me to do thy will.

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:55.020
Yes, God, reveal Your will to me, reveal Your plan to me, but teach me to do it.

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:56.340
Not just to know it.

00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:59.900
What a sad thing to know what God wants us to do but then sit on the sidelines and not

00:09:59.900 --> 00:09:59.900


00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:07.660
it, right? We're to do what He's given us to do. Think about this. We'll kind of, Psalm 90, if you

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:10.780
turn back, I know we're kind of going back and forth here, but I just want to share some of these

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:17.580
recorded requests, and perhaps we could adopt some of these for ourselves this evening. In Psalm 90

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:25.020
and verse number 12, this is a psalm that is attributed to Moses, and the Bible tells us this.

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:29.020
It's a verse that we're familiar with, actually, Psalm 90 and verse number 12. Notice this,

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:36.940
so teach us what? Teach us to number our days. Teach us to number our days that we may apply our

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:45.420
hearts unto wisdom. Lord, teach us to number our days. Are we not keenly aware of the brevity of

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:50.700
life? As we study the Word of God, as we study the Scriptures, we understand the Bible tells us

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:55.020
that our life is but a vapor that appears for a little time and then vanisheth away.

00:10:55.020 --> 00:11:00.620
And the reality is that we ought to pray and ask God to teach us, as the psalm tells us in Psalm 90

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:06.540
and verse number 12, teach us, Lord, to number our days. Help us that we may apply our hearts

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:13.500
unto wisdom. The New Testament tells us that we're to redeem the time and that we are stewards of

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:20.700
that which God has blessed us with. I think about the request that is made in Judges chapter number

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:30.220
13, and this is a request that is made, and a request that every parent ought to make. And

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:37.500
here in this passage of Scripture, we find that the angel of God had appeared and had let the

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:43.180
couple know that they were going to have a child, and Manoah wasn't there, but then he's

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:49.900
there. And the Bible tells us in Judges 13 and verse number 8, notice the request at the end of

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:55.900
the verse, it says, then Manoah entreated the Lord and said, O my Lord, let the man of God,

00:11:55.900 --> 00:12:02.300
which thou didst send, come again unto us, notice this, and teach us what we shall do unto the child

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:10.300
that shall be born. I remember when Holly told me that she was expecting Juliana, and I remember

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:18.060
that thought that overcame me of, am I ready to be a father? Am I ready for this role that now

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:25.740
I have to fulfill? And I was very much aware of the fact that I needed God to help me to understand

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:31.580
how to parent and what to do, and Manoah makes this great request. We're familiar with the

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:37.100
request of the disciples in Luke chapter number 11. We won't turn there for sake of time,

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:43.020
but in Luke chapter number 11, the disciples come to the Lord Jesus Christ, and they say, Lord,

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:51.180
teach us to pray. Teach us to pray. That's a good request, is it not? Teach us to pray.

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:57.820
I did a series on that on Wednesday evenings last year, and I said this when we had that series,

00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:01.580
that of all the things the disciples could have asked the Lord to teach them,

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:06.380
the only thing that we have recorded within the Word of God that they requested was teach us

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:13.980
to pray. Teach us to pray. And oh, that God would teach us to pray. Teach us to pray.

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:18.380
So, we think about some of these recorded requests, and I would encourage you to do

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:24.220
some Bible study and to consider some other portions of Scripture that we see where the

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:30.140
people of God prayed and asked God specifically, teach me this. It's important that we would have

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:35.020
that teachable spirit. It's important that we desire to be taught, that we might learn the

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:42.540
Word of God, learn the truths of God, but the reality is that when we put some specific nature

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:47.580
to that request, it helps us to go into a particular area. So, we think about these

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:52.140
recorded requests, perhaps this evening, if you're taking notes number two, I want you to consider

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:56.300
some relevant recommendations. I'm going to give you some recommendations this evening

00:13:56.300 --> 00:14:02.540
as to what it is that we should say, Lord, teach me. Teach me. Teach me what? What is it that you

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:07.740
want me to teach you? Someone comes to you and says, they've observed you and say, would you teach me?

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:11.660
What are you going to say? What do you want me to teach you, right? What is it that you would like

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:15.820
to learn? What is it that you'd like for me to teach you? Now, someone comes to me and asks me

00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:20.300
to teach them certain things. I'm not capable of teaching certain things because I don't know how

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:25.660
to do them, but we know that we serve the Lord God Almighty. He's given us this precious book,

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:31.340
and He's able to teach us. Let me give you this recommendation. Number one, we should desire that

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:38.220
God would teach us who He is, who He is. You know, today we live in a society in which many people

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:44.060
have a misunderstanding of who God is. They do not understand the God of the Bible. They do not know

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:48.940
His nature nor His character. There are people that sit within churches all across this land

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:55.820
that do not know the God of the Bible. They've allowed for the culture. They've allowed for

00:14:55.820 --> 00:15:01.820
Hollywood. They've allowed for politics. They've allowed for all sorts of people to influence them

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:07.660
with regard to who God is. But God's given us this precious book, and He has revealed to us His

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:13.820
nature, and He's revealed to us who He is. Paul said this, probably from our perspective, one of

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:18.860
the greatest Christians that ever walked upon the face of the earth. He said that I may know Him.

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:23.740
Now, think about that. In Philippians 3 and verse number 10, he's in prison awaiting his execution,

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:29.980
and he says that I may know Him. He wants to know God in a greater way. He wants to know God in a

00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:36.140
more intimate way. And when we understand this tonight, what an important aspect that we'd say,

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:43.340
Lord, teach me who You are. Teach me Your attributes. Teach me Your nature. Because the reality is that

00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:50.860
when we understand in a greater way who our God is, it increases our faith. It helps us to trust Him.

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:57.260
It helps us to walk in obedience to Him. Why? Because we know who He is. When we begin to go to

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:02.780
the Word of God, and we begin to seek the Word of God with regard to some of these other areas in

00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:09.260
which I'll mention this evening, the reality is if we don't first know who God is, it can trouble

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:16.060
the findings that we discover with regard to other areas of our lives, with regard to pleasing Him,

00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:22.140
because we do not understand how much He loves us and how He has our best interest in mind. See,

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:28.700
God knows us. God formed us. Let me say this. He knows what's best for us. Amen? You believe that

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:34.220
tonight? I believe that with all my heart. I sat across the table from someone a few years ago,

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:38.860
and they said, well, preacher, let me just tell you this. God wants me to be happy.

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:50.860
And then they said this, and this makes me happy. Well, I got a whole bucket load of verses that

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:58.140
teach us that we're not supposed to do this, and so this can't be in connection with what you

00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:02.620
understand. Here's the problem with that individual. They didn't understand the love of God.

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:09.660
They didn't understand who God was. They had this misconception that God loves me and God wants me

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:16.220
to be happy, and so therefore, if this behavior or this activity makes me happy, then by default,

00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:25.260
God must be okay with it. It's not the truth of God's Word. Amen? And when we understand who God

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:32.380
is and we understand that God as the Creator has given us truth that will help us know how we're

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:37.900
to live our lives and how we can please Him, and when we come to those portions and passages of

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:43.900
Scripture that God is giving us that instruction, when we have that understanding of who He is and

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:50.300
how much He loves us, it helps us to submit to it and to learn what He's trying to teach us.

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:55.260
And so first, we ought to pray that God would teach us who He is. As I've mentioned before,

00:17:55.900 --> 00:18:00.540
many of us have some understanding of who God is, but can I tell you this? His greatness is

00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:06.380
unsearchable, according to Psalm 145. I'll stand with anyone and say, I know that the Lord is great.

00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:11.260
He is. He's a great God. He's revealed His greatness to me. I stand in awe of who He is,

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:15.980
but I'd say this, I only scratch the surface of understanding the infinite God.

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:24.300
My finite mind cannot fully comprehend the infinite God, and neither can yours. Amen? So,

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:30.460
we ought to daily say, Lord, teach me who You are. Help me to understand in a greater way

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:37.500
Your attributes and Your nature. Let me say this, when I ask God to teach us His plan,

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:43.260
what is God's plan? We mentioned about the recorded request of Thy paths and Thy way,

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:49.580
but I think about this, when we, as the people of God living in 2022, that we say, what is Your plan,

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:56.860
God? What is Your plan for today? We know that He has established the church. It is His

00:18:56.860 --> 00:19:04.619
establishment. It is the organism that God has chosen to use in this period of history,

00:19:04.619 --> 00:19:11.100
and the church is not man's idea. It's not the result of Constantine or anyone else. It is

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:19.100
God's plan. It is God's idea. And God is the head of the church, and He has a plan for His church.

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:24.220
And so, we understand, we say, God, what is Your plan for today? What is Your plan for today with

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:32.059
the church? What is Your plan? God has given us in His Word His plan for reaching this world with

00:19:32.059 --> 00:19:39.180
the gospel of Jesus Christ. So often, we neglect to just simply go to the Word of God and say,

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:44.860
okay, what is God's plan? Okay, here's what God's plan is. Let's do it, right? Remember the truth

00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:50.300
of Psalm 143 and verse number 10, teach me to do Thy will. Sometimes we like to just sit around

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:54.460
and have seminars talking about what we already know needs to be done instead of just doing it.

00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:59.740
And I want to know what God's plan is for today.

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:02.820
How about God's plan for the future?

00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:05.460
What's God's plan for the future?

00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:07.300
He's given us prophecy.

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:10.340
I'm thankful for the prophecy that He's given us.

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:16.540
We cannot neglect today for the purpose of studying prophecy, but there should be a balance.

00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:22.740
But as we study prophecy, it helps us to understand God's plan and what God's timeline is and

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:27.020
what His timetable is and what are the next events and what is it that's going to happen.

00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:31.900
And we think about that truth of prophecy, and I'm thankful that our God is Alpha and

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:38.260
Omega, that He knows the end from the beginning, and that He can give us in this recorded book

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:41.100
His plan for the ages.

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:42.340
Amen?

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:43.980
And what a blessing that is.

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:45.580
I say, God, I want to know your plan.

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:47.980
Let me say this.

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:52.740
If I think about this relevant request or recommendation, a relevant recommendation,

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:56.460
I would say not only knowing who God is and knowing what God's plan is, but let me say

00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:57.460
this.

00:20:57.460 --> 00:20:59.900
What is my place within God's plan?

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:03.580
God, what is my place within your plan?

00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:05.900
I understand, God, that you have a plan.

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:10.820
I understand that your plan is to use the local church, and God, I understand that I

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:12.380
am part of the local church.

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:14.460
What's your plan for me?

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:17.860
What is my place within your plan?

00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:21.500
I believe tonight that we all have a place within God's plan.

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:22.500
Amen?

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:26.380
If God didn't have a place for you within His plan, you wouldn't be here still.

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:27.380
Amen?

00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:32.460
But if you're living and you're breathing, and you are, because you're here tonight,

00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:37.500
the reality is that God has a place for you within His plan.

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:39.300
You say, well, I don't know what my place is.

00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:45.540
That's why we say, Lord, teach me your place, my place within your plan, and we ask God

00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:46.540
to show us.

00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:52.620
Listen, the Word of God teaches us in 1 Peter chapter number 4 that every man has received

00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:54.460
a spiritual gift.

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:56.340
The Bible teaches us the book of 1 Corinthians.

00:21:56.340 --> 00:22:00.800
If you look through chapters really 12 through 15 and look at those portions of Scripture,

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:06.900
you find that the Word of God teaches us that the Spirit equips and gifts every believer

00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:08.480
as He will.

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:15.160
And the Bible tells us that He equips us spiritually for the purpose of edification, for the purpose

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:16.660
of the church.

00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:23.120
The Word of God likens the church to a body, and every member is of importance.

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:26.480
I'm thankful that I have a left hand and a right hand.

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:29.480
I'm thankful that I have a thumb on each of my hands.

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:31.520
I'm thankful that I got ears and eyes.

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:35.920
It'd be a terrible thing if we had four eyes or four ears and none of the other, right?

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:40.560
I mean, you think about the truth, and here's the reality when you look at what Paul says

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:42.000
to the believers in Corinth.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:47.040
He says, listen, the eye can't say to the...and you understand what he's saying, listen, I'm

00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:48.560
of more importance than you are.

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:52.760
No, every member has its purpose and its place.

00:22:52.760 --> 00:23:00.720
And God has uniquely designed the human body, but He's also uniquely designed the church,

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:02.720
and He builds His church.

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:05.440
You remember Bezalel in the Old Testament?

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:11.920
Bezalel was the man that God particularly, specifically equipped, not only to perform

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:17.280
the work of getting things ready for the tabernacle, but also to teach others.

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:21.960
It was Moses that received all of the instruction, the pattern that was to be followed, but it

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:28.060
was Bezalel that God had specifically equipped for doing that work, Bezalel and Aholiab.

00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:31.520
And you look at that, and you see what God did and how God blessed.

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:34.900
You say, God, what is my place within your plan?

00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:36.760
What is my involvement within the church?

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:43.360
The Bible tells us in Philippians 1, in verse number 27, that we are to strive together

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:45.960
for the faith of the gospel.

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:46.960
Striving together.

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:53.480
We understand that we are laborers, co-laborers, one with another, we're co-laborers with God.

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:55.800
Remember what Paul said?

00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:57.060
He said, who then is Paul?

00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:59.520
Who is Apollos?

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:03.120
Some plant, some water, but God gives the increase.

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:05.720
What is my place within the church?

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:08.760
What is my involvement in the local church?

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:12.280
What is my involvement within the Great Commission?

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:17.040
If the Great Commission has been given, and God's Great Commission, His last words to

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:23.160
the church remain our marching orders today, what part of fulfilling the Great Commission

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:25.460
am I fulfilling?

00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:28.960
What involvement do I have in fulfilling the Great Commission?

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:34.520
If this is God's program, if this is God's plan, and God is teaching me what His plan

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:38.040
is for today, I say, God, what's my place in that plan?

00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:41.800
I want to be involved in what God's doing in the world, amen?

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:44.320
And God chose that He uses people.

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:47.200
Aren't you thankful for that?

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:52.520
He said, I'm going to use people, human beings, my children.

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:54.260
I'm going to equip them.

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:58.280
They are my workmanship created in Christ Jesus.

00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:03.340
I'm going to equip them, I'm going to enable them, and then I'm going to bless them for

00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:06.000
doing what I've told them to do.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.720
That's a good deal, amen?

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:11.640
He equips us, He enables us, and then He blesses us.

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:12.960
It's amazing.

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:16.600
God, what's my place within Your plan?

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:19.880
Let me say this in closing this evening.

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:26.280
I would say that we could pray and ask God to teach me, teach me how I can please Him.

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:31.000
You know, 1 Corinthians chapter number 10 tells us of some Old Testament biblical accounts

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:36.260
where the Bible says that with many of them, God was not well-pleased.

00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:39.760
I do not desire that it would be said of my life, and I do not desire that it would be

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:44.080
said of your life, that God is not well-pleased, amen?

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:47.360
I want to please Him, I want to please Him.

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:54.760
The first part of Proverbs 16 and verse number 7 says, when a man's ways please the Lord,

00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:58.760
when a man's ways please the Lord.

00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:04.760
I want my ways to please God, but how am I going to know?

00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:10.120
In the book of Ephesians in chapter 5 and verse number 10, God says this, as Paul is

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:15.960
writing to those believers in Ephesus, he says, proving what is acceptable unto the

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:16.960
Lord.

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:20.960
Lord, teach me how to please You.

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:26.160
Teach me how to live my life in such a way that it is pleasing in Your sight.

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:31.600
That's a great prayer request, that's a great teach-me request, that's a, I believe, a relevant

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:36.280
recommendation that we take in our lives today, and we say, Lord, teach me how I can please

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:37.280
You.

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:39.520
Can I say this, and I'm not going to look at any verses of Scripture, I'm just going

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:44.640
to go quickly through it this evening in closing, but the reality is that if you want to know

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:50.400
how to be a husband, go to this book, amen?

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:51.680
You want to know how to be a wife?

00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:53.600
Go to this book.

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:55.160
You want to know how to be a parent?

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:57.080
Go to this book.

00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:58.080
You want to know how to be a child?

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:01.540
I know we don't have any children in here, but for our children, one of the first verses

00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:08.040
we taught our children to memorize, children, obey your parents in the Lord, amen?

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:09.040
It's Bible.

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:10.800
I'm trying to teach them, why?

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:15.560
Because when they please their parents, they're pleasing God, amen?

00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:17.320
Honor thy father and mother.

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:20.960
Teach the first commandment with promise, amen?

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:22.320
So you want to know how to be a good child?

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:23.320
You better get in the book.

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:24.720
You better get in the Word of God.

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:25.720
Think about this.

00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:30.960
Personally, if I want to be a good pastor, the Word of God teaches me how to be a pastor.

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:35.520
The Word of God teaches and talks about being a good minister, and it qualifies it.

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:38.640
If you do this, then you're a good minister, all right?

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:39.680
I want to be a good pastor.

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:42.100
I want to please God as a pastor.

00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:46.920
The place that He's called me within His plan, I want to be a good pastor.

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:48.520
How do I do that?

00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:49.520
Well, He says, feed the flock of God.

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:53.000
Yes, sir, I'm going to do my best to feed the flock of God.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.920
I'm going to study and prepare and pray and seek to deliver to the best of my ability

00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:00.640
and with God's help, the Word of God.

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:01.640
Why?

00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:02.640
Because that's my responsibility.

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:06.440
You want to be a good church member?

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:11.600
The Word of God teaches us how to be a good church member.

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:13.760
Titus chapter number 2, go through it.

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:15.520
The aged men, they're supposed to do this.

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:17.600
The aged women, they're supposed to do this.

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:19.640
You look at God's Word teaches us.

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:21.880
You want to be a good church member?

00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:22.880
Go to the book.

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:23.960
Go to the Word of God.

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:26.360
God teach me to be a good church member.

00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:28.400
God teach me to be a good pastor.

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:30.080
Teach me to be a good neighbor.

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:34.400
Teach me to be a good friend, a co-worker, an employee, an employer.

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:37.280
All of these things are found within the Word of God.

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:40.600
God, I'm having a hard time at work.

00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:43.920
Teach me how to, right?

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:46.000
It works.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:51.520
And when we add some qualifiers, if you will, to this desire of teach me, and really that's

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:56.280
my desire this evening, to help us just think of what is it that we're saying, Lord, teach

00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:57.560
me.

00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:01.920
We're going to look at over the next several weeks of how God teaches His children.

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:05.280
God uses a variety of classrooms.

00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:09.980
And sometimes those classrooms aren't always easy, but God uses a variety of classrooms

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:11.740
to teach His children.

00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:16.340
And as He teaches us, that's why I've often said over the years that the reality is that

00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:21.900
we need to be careful that we understand that God can always deliver us from everything

00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:24.480
that we face.

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:32.100
At times, however, God is more interested in developing us than in delivering us.

00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:34.860
It doesn't mean He can't deliver us.

00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:37.380
It just means He wants to develop us.

00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:41.460
And sometimes when we go through a trial and we go through a circumstance, an adversity,

00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:46.820
a problem in our lives, instead of us praying, God, deliver me from this, perhaps we should

00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:51.820
pray, God, teach me what You want to teach me through this.

00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:57.300
Help me, Lord, to learn that even in this difficulty that You're real and that You have

00:29:57.300 --> 00:29:58.660
a plan.

00:29:58.660 --> 00:29:59.660
Teach me.

00:29:59.660 --> 00:29:59.660


00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:05.980
teaching us that His grace is sufficient, right? Is that what Paul said? He besought

00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:11.980
the Lord thrice, and God said, Paul, my grace is sufficient for thee. Amen? God's grace

00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:20.360
is sufficient. We find this evening we could speak about a whole host of things, areas

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:26.700
of our lives, but tonight I hope that as we would consider this thought, teach me, that

00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:32.380
we would say, what are some things, what should I desire to learn? Teach me. Teach me what?

00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:38.380
Lord, teach me who you are. I want to know you in a more intimate way. I want to know

00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:45.300
you in a greater way. I want to stand in awe of who you are. God, teach me what your plan

00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:55.340
is. Why did you leave us here? What's your plan for today? How do I fit within your plan?

00:30:55.340 --> 00:31:02.220
What is my place within your plan, God? And then, God, how can I please you with my life?

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:07.420
Because I want to hear, well done, thou good and faithful servant. Don't you? I want to

00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:14.880
hear that. I want to be pleasing in God's sight. I want God to be pleased with me. Think

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:21.320
about these words, and I'll close with this. Paul says this in 2 Timothy 2, as he's writing

00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:27.560
to Timothy, his son in the faith. In 2 Timothy 2, in verse 4, he says,

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:32.440
No man that werth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life, that he may please

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:39.580
him who hath chosen him to be a soldier. You know who chose us to be a soldier? The Lord.

00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:45.240
Amen? He talks about being a good soldier in verse 3, but the reality is that we want

00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:49.880
to please him. I want to please him. Some of you have been in the military. I grew up

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:57.280
around the military, and there's an aspect of desiring to please, humanly speaking, a

00:31:57.280 --> 00:32:04.120
superior ranking official. When you have inspection, I remember my dad spending hours preparing

00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:08.520
for inspections, and I remember as a kid thinking, Dad, why can't you do this? Why can't you

00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:11.760
do that? Why can't we go play? Why can't we what? Why do you have to get ready for this

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:17.000
inspection? Because some commanding officer somewhere was going to come and inspect them,

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.880
and they wanted to be pleasing, right? They didn't want to have problems and difficulties.

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:27.020
He didn't want to. So he put in the time to make sure that he could stand in that formation

00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:32.320
and go through that inspection. Oh, think about it from a heavenly perspective. We have

00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:40.520
a great God. We have a great God. He saved us, changed our lives. Oh, I want to please

00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:46.000
him with my life. If you want to please him, this book will tell you how you can please

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:52.840
him, and it will provide you with warnings of things not to do that will displease him.

00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:57.680
Those are of equal importance. Amen? Paul says, I warn you. I warn you why? Because

00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:05.360
I love you. God's warnings are for our benefits. Amen? And what a great God we serve. Teach

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:09.760
me. Teach me what? What is it that I should desire to learn? I hope this evening that

00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:17.800
we have a host of things that we can add to our prayer list of, God, teach me. Teach

00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:23.160
me these things. Let's pray together. Father, we love you. We thank you for loving us. We

00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:30.280
thank you that you are the divine teacher, and I pray that you'd help us, God, to be

00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:39.400
desirous of learning, that we'd have that teachable spirit, that, God, we'd pray specifically

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:44.480
of things that we desire that you'd teach us. Help us to please you with our lives.

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:48.960
Bless our time of prayer. Thank you for the privilege. Pray that you would bless, and

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:52.720
we'll thank you for it. In Christ's name we pray. Amen.

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:55.600
Draw your attention to the back of our prayer bulletin, as we do each and every week.
