1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
of the year that Brianna, along with one of her classmates

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,159
there at college, helped us in writing that song

3
00:00:07,159 --> 00:00:10,159
and the words along with the music.

4
00:00:10,159 --> 00:00:12,359
And so I hope that you'll catch that tune

5
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:15,260
and be singing it, and certainly a great truth

6
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:17,680
and great blessing of the importance of continuing

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,139
and very thankful for that song.

8
00:00:21,139 --> 00:00:23,139
I hope you're working on the memory verse

9
00:00:23,139 --> 00:00:26,940
for the month of January, 1 Timothy 1, 17,

10
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,559
and that's the memory verse for the month of January,

11
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:31,940
1 Timothy 1, 17, I hope you're working on that,

12
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:32,979
commit it to memory.

13
00:00:32,979 --> 00:00:36,500
If you do it all year long, you'll have 12 verses memorized

14
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,979
by the end of the year from 1 and 2 Timothy.

15
00:00:38,979 --> 00:00:40,900
All the verses will be from those two books

16
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,959
as we preach through those books

17
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:44,200
on Sunday morning this year.

18
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,540
1 Thessalonians chapter five, last week we looked

19
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:50,659
at verses 12 and 13 and dealt with the subject matter

20
00:00:50,659 --> 00:00:54,139
of a pastor, or excuse me, a church and its pastor.

21
00:00:54,139 --> 00:00:56,580
A church and its pastor, we talked about the responsibility

22
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,659
of the pastor, the responsibility of the church,

23
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:01,939
and we mentioned this last week that the last statement

24
00:01:01,939 --> 00:01:04,940
of verse number 13 would be the focus

25
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,860
of our attention this evening,

26
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,419
and as we continue studying through this instruction

27
00:01:09,419 --> 00:01:11,459
that is given to the church at Thessalonica,

28
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:13,779
we see the subject matter of unity

29
00:01:13,779 --> 00:01:15,260
being addressed this evening.

30
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,779
Notice the end of verse number 13,

31
00:01:17,779 --> 00:01:21,540
the Bible says, and be at peace among yourselves,

32
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,080
and be at peace among yourselves.

33
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,580
It is necessary that we understand the importance

34
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,459
of unity in the church.

35
00:01:28,459 --> 00:01:31,220
The enemy, we have an enemy, and we understand

36
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:32,419
that we have an enemy personally,

37
00:01:32,419 --> 00:01:34,739
but we corporately, collectively have an enemy,

38
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:38,620
and the enemy desires, his desire is to destroy

39
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,319
the unity of the church.

40
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:41,980
I believe as you study through the book of Acts

41
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:45,300
that you find that initially the attack of Satan

42
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,940
on the church was from without.

43
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,339
Through persecution and all that the church endured

44
00:01:50,339 --> 00:01:52,059
in those early days of the book of Acts,

45
00:01:52,059 --> 00:01:56,459
we find that the enemy was seeking to stifle,

46
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,300
to stop the advancement of the church,

47
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,580
the preaching of the gospel,

48
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,059
and he used that persecution,

49
00:02:01,059 --> 00:02:03,180
but we know this as we come to Acts chapter number eight,

50
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,459
and verse number four, the Bible says,

51
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:06,260
they that were scattered abroad went everywhere

52
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,539
preaching the word, hallelujah,

53
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:10,339
that they went everywhere preaching the word,

54
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:13,419
but Satan recognized that his tactic did not work,

55
00:02:13,419 --> 00:02:15,119
and some have said it this way,

56
00:02:15,119 --> 00:02:18,660
that the fires of persecution that burned in Jerusalem,

57
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:22,139
that when they tried to stamp them out at the gospel,

58
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:25,740
excuse me, the fire of the embers of the gospel,

59
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,820
when they tried to stamp it out through persecution,

60
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,779
spread the embers around the world,

61
00:02:29,779 --> 00:02:32,699
and certainly there's great truth to that,

62
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:35,059
and so we find that as we continue to study

63
00:02:35,059 --> 00:02:35,899
through the book of Acts,

64
00:02:35,899 --> 00:02:39,539
and even into the history throughout the New Testament,

65
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:44,460
that Satan, he really begins to change his approach,

66
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,960
and he learned the ineffectiveness of that tactic

67
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,740
of persecution he saw to attack the church from within.

68
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,259
What is it that he uses within?

69
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:56,339
Well, of course, we know false doctrine, false teaching,

70
00:02:56,339 --> 00:02:57,899
no doubt that that's part of it,

71
00:02:57,899 --> 00:02:59,779
but specifically with regard to the subject

72
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:02,100
that we'll deal with tonight of unity,

73
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,100
we find that he uses divisions and schisms

74
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,940
to render the church ineffective.

75
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:12,759
Now think about this, if a church has turmoil within,

76
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:15,860
resulting in the focus and attention being inward

77
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:18,960
and not outward, so often we think about churches

78
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,300
that do not have unity,

79
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,619
there's that lack of unity within a church,

80
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,339
and you find that there's so much focus,

81
00:03:24,339 --> 00:03:27,100
so much resource that's given to all that's taking place,

82
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,660
the fighting, the tension, the division,

83
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:32,059
all those things inside, all of a sudden,

84
00:03:32,059 --> 00:03:35,300
we've lost focus of what our real purpose is,

85
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,600
and that is to reach the world

86
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,740
with the gospel of Jesus Christ,

87
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,559
and so we find that the enemy has been seeking

88
00:03:41,559 --> 00:03:45,199
to provide disunity, to cause disunity

89
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:49,500
within the household of faith, within the church of God.

90
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,660
The Lord, however, is our peace,

91
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:56,339
and I believe that he places an emphasis in his word

92
00:03:56,339 --> 00:03:57,619
on the subject of unity.

93
00:03:57,619 --> 00:03:59,179
If you are taking notes this evening,

94
00:03:59,179 --> 00:04:01,919
I've titled the message from this last phrase

95
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:05,839
of 1 Thessalonians 5, 13, unity in the church,

96
00:04:05,839 --> 00:04:07,539
unity in the church.

97
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:10,380
Number one this evening, God's plan for unity.

98
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,940
We're gonna look at a number of verses tonight,

99
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,940
because we see that the text of scripture

100
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:17,100
simply says, and be at peace among yourselves,

101
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,440
but we begin to look at God's plan for unity,

102
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,480
and I would argue this evening, biblically,

103
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,519
as we'll look at a number of scriptures tonight,

104
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:28,600
that it is God's plan for his people to be in unity,

105
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,880
and we find all the way back in Psalm 138,

106
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,320
it's a familiar verse of scripture,

107
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,760
but I'll read it this evening,

108
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,239
as we consider this thought tonight of unity

109
00:04:36,239 --> 00:04:38,119
and God's plan for unity,

110
00:04:38,119 --> 00:04:40,820
and we find that in Psalm 138, in verse number,

111
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,660
it's not Psalm 138, I got a typo here,

112
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,640
but it's when, behold, chapter 133,

113
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,359
I can't read my own writing,

114
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,040
Psalm 133, in verse number one,

115
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:56,040
behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren

116
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,920
to dwell together in unity.

117
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,239
Psalm 133, in verse number one.

118
00:05:03,239 --> 00:05:05,959
I don't know about you, but just personally,

119
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:10,500
I am not a big fan or advocate of fighting, division.

120
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,920
I know, sometimes you meet people that just like to fight,

121
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,459
you ever meet somebody like that?

122
00:05:16,459 --> 00:05:17,920
Yeah, I mean, it's like their calling in life,

123
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,160
they just gotta be divisive,

124
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:20,959
and that's just the way they are,

125
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:23,000
you say it's blue and they know it's green,

126
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,239
you say, I mean, that's just the way it is, right?

127
00:05:25,239 --> 00:05:27,079
And there's some people that like fighting,

128
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:29,000
it just seems like they're bent toward that.

129
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,100
I personally, I don't like it, I don't care for it,

130
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,459
I don't like disagreement, I don't like arguments,

131
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:35,019
I don't like that type of thing,

132
00:05:35,019 --> 00:05:38,119
but we see here that God says, behold, how good

133
00:05:38,119 --> 00:05:41,440
and how pleasant it is for brethren

134
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,440
to dwell together in unity, in unity.

135
00:05:47,239 --> 00:05:49,679
Now, we look at this verse of scripture

136
00:05:49,679 --> 00:05:52,239
and we see really the beginning of this thought

137
00:05:52,239 --> 00:05:54,679
of God's plan for unity, I want you to go

138
00:05:54,679 --> 00:05:56,640
to the New Testament as we think specifically

139
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,119
about the church this evening,

140
00:05:58,119 --> 00:05:59,799
go to the book of Romans, if you will,

141
00:05:59,799 --> 00:06:02,399
and we'll look at a number of verses of scripture tonight,

142
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:05,140
and go to Romans chapter number 12,

143
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,720
and I want you to see what God's plan is

144
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,380
for unity within his church, within his people.

145
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,720
We find that here in Romans, and again in 1 Corinthians,

146
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,000
we won't take the time to look

147
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,040
in the 1 Corinthians chapter 12 and following there

148
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,320
with regard to the same analogy that's used,

149
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,320
but here in Romans chapter 12, in verse number five,

150
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:28,760
notice what the Bible says, so we, being many,

151
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:33,760
are one body in Christ, and every one member

152
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,720
is one of another, and then he talks about

153
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,959
the different gifts and how he's given gifts

154
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:39,920
to the church and so on and so forth,

155
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,200
but we see that statement in Romans 12, five,

156
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,559
where it says, so we, being many, are one body in Christ.

157
00:06:46,559 --> 00:06:48,399
You think about the unity.

158
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:50,320
Listen, I'm thankful this evening,

159
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,079
and I'm sure that you are as well,

160
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:54,100
that when your brain tells your right hand

161
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,160
to do something, it does it, right?

162
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,119
Your body works in agreement, and there's certain aspect.

163
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:03,440
You wanna walk over there, and you just kinda,

164
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,500
you walk over there, right?

165
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,359
Your body functions as one.

166
00:07:07,359 --> 00:07:10,320
If my foot says to my hand, I'm not gonna do this,

167
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,399
Paul deals with that in the book of 1 Corinthians,

168
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:17,320
and so we find that we're many members, but we're one body.

169
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,079
God is giving us this insight with regard

170
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:21,440
to his plan for unity.

171
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,359
Look at 1 Corinthians, if you will,

172
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:24,920
and as we look at 1 Corinthians,

173
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,040
we're obviously familiar with the church in Corinth,

174
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,480
and understanding that this church in Corinth

175
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,399
was a church that dealt with a number

176
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:37,619
of divisions and contentions, but I want you to notice

177
00:07:37,619 --> 00:07:40,779
how Paul begins to issue this call

178
00:07:40,779 --> 00:07:43,299
to this church in Corinth in chapter one,

179
00:07:43,299 --> 00:07:45,940
in verse number 10, and really revealing

180
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:48,739
to us God's plan for unity.

181
00:07:48,739 --> 00:07:50,640
Notice what the Bible says in 1 Corinthians one,

182
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:54,739
in verse number 10, now I beseech you, brethren,

183
00:07:54,739 --> 00:07:57,179
by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

184
00:07:57,179 --> 00:08:00,480
So Paul is not begging the believers in Corinth

185
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,260
based on his own desire, based on his own goal

186
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,440
or ambition for the church.

187
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,119
No, he says, I beseech you, brethren,

188
00:08:08,119 --> 00:08:11,320
by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,

189
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,440
that ye all speak the same thing,

190
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:18,000
and that there be no divisions among you.

191
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,320
He didn't say that there be fewer divisions among you.

192
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,279
He said that there be no divisions among you.

193
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:25,880
That's unity.

194
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,760
Notice he continues and says this,

195
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:31,320
but that ye be perfectly joined together

196
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,640
in the same mind and in the same judgment,

197
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:40,559
for it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren,

198
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,559
by them which are the house of Chloe,

199
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:47,080
that there are contentions among you.

200
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,080
So we know of the contentions, we know of the divisions.

201
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,659
He immediately enters into the situation

202
00:08:52,659 --> 00:08:55,359
where they were saying, I am of Paul,

203
00:08:55,359 --> 00:08:57,679
I'm of Apollos, I'm of Cephas, I'm of Christ,

204
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:59,679
and what have you, and these schisms

205
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:03,479
that were just brewing in the church at Corinth,

206
00:09:03,479 --> 00:09:07,320
and we find that Paul says that he's beseeching them

207
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,520
by the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.

208
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,320
Notice that you speak the same thing,

209
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,280
and that there be no divisions among you,

210
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,659
but that ye be perfectly joined together,

211
00:09:17,659 --> 00:09:20,880
notice, in the same mind, in the same judgment.

212
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,159
What is that same mind that he's speaking of?

213
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:25,780
Well, I believe, and we'll get to it later this evening,

214
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:28,020
it's the mind of Christ.

215
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:32,359
And we find that Paul is helping us to understand here

216
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,159
that it's been reported, Paul believes,

217
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:39,000
he understands what's taking place there in the church,

218
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,239
and he says that there are contentions among you,

219
00:09:42,239 --> 00:09:45,520
there are divisions among you.

220
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:50,719
Now, remember what Jesus said about a house being divided.

221
00:09:50,719 --> 00:09:52,840
In Matthew chapter 12, you don't need to turn there,

222
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,719
but in verse 25, the Bible says that Jesus knew

223
00:09:55,719 --> 00:09:57,479
their thoughts and said unto them,

224
00:09:57,479 --> 00:10:00,039
every kingdom divided against itself

225
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:07,539
brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand."

226
00:10:07,539 --> 00:10:13,099
I believe that we could obviously make the application for Matthew 12, 25 to even a church,

227
00:10:13,099 --> 00:10:17,819
a church that is divided, is losing its effectiveness for Christ.

228
00:10:17,819 --> 00:10:24,839
And so we find that the enemy desires to cause division and to disrupt the unity, but God's

229
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:31,039
plan for the church is that they would be in unity, that they would have unity.

230
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,199
We're not going to take the time.

231
00:10:32,199 --> 00:10:35,759
It's almost like a homework assignment this evening, but the fact of the matter is that

232
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:37,839
I'm not going to check it to know if you did it or not.

233
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,599
It's just going to be an honor system.

234
00:10:39,599 --> 00:10:40,599
But I want to give you this challenge.

235
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:44,519
I want you to look in the book of Acts, and I want you to go through the book of Acts,

236
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:47,479
the beginning chapter of the book of Acts, and I want you to see how often the Bible

237
00:10:47,479 --> 00:10:51,679
says that they were of one accord.

238
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:53,119
One accord.

239
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:54,119
One accord.

240
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,719
Really, with one mind is the idea of that statement.

241
00:10:58,719 --> 00:11:03,439
And we find that the Bible says repeatedly throughout the opening chapter of the book

242
00:11:03,439 --> 00:11:06,279
of Acts how that they were in one accord.

243
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:07,279
That's God's plan.

244
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,799
God's plan for the church is that they would be in unity.

245
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:17,939
He says here to the church at Thessalonica, and be at peace among yourselves.

246
00:11:17,939 --> 00:11:22,279
No fighting, no division, no turmoil, but be at peace.

247
00:11:22,439 --> 00:11:26,639
Now, we think about this truth, God's plan for unity, but I want you to consider this

248
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:29,479
evening the path to unity.

249
00:11:29,479 --> 00:11:30,959
The path to unity.

250
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:34,839
If we acknowledge tonight that it's God's plan for unity, for his church, for his people

251
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:39,959
to be in unity, he says how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity.

252
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:44,759
We find that he says Paul is beseeching the church at Corinth that they be of the same

253
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:49,679
mind, that there be no divisions, that this is God's plan, that his church is a church

254
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:51,919
that's unified, that has unity.

255
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:55,959
What is the path by which we can achieve unity?

256
00:11:55,959 --> 00:12:00,559
Let me say this, it is not by ignoring doctrine.

257
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:07,319
There are some today that would seek to have and really try to give this idea within Christendom

258
00:12:07,319 --> 00:12:12,959
and ecumenical movements that we just kind of want to have this unity and so set aside

259
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:18,239
those things that would divide us and just simply embrace so we can have unity.

260
00:12:18,239 --> 00:12:21,079
That's not true unity.

261
00:12:21,239 --> 00:12:26,239
The only way to truly achieve unity as we'll look at this evening is to follow the path

262
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:28,959
that God outlines for us in his word.

263
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:33,999
And as we follow the path that God outlines for us in his word, we can achieve unity.

264
00:12:33,999 --> 00:12:39,039
We can have a church that is unified, that has that unity, and we could say how good

265
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:43,119
and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity.

266
00:12:43,119 --> 00:12:44,599
Look back at Romans chapter 12.

267
00:12:44,599 --> 00:12:47,999
We were there just a moment ago in verse number five.

268
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:51,159
We talked about we're many, but we're to be one body in Christ.

269
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:57,079
Then notice in verses nine and 10 as God gives us some insight here with the path to unity.

270
00:12:57,079 --> 00:13:01,639
How is it that we can have this unity, that we can have this understanding that we're

271
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:03,479
one body in Christ?

272
00:13:03,479 --> 00:13:10,479
Notice in verse nine, let love be without dissimulation, abhor that which is evil, cleave

273
00:13:10,479 --> 00:13:12,079
to that which is good.

274
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:18,839
Be kindly affectionate one to another with brotherly love and honor, preferring one another.

275
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,999
He goes through a number of other things that he lists here, but verses nine and 10 are

276
00:13:21,999 --> 00:13:28,639
quite insightful as we begin to think about this path to unity and really having the mind

277
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:29,639
of Christ.

278
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:34,439
And we say that because we couple this passage with Philippians chapter number two.

279
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:40,159
Turn over there if you will and look in Philippians two and notice what the Bible tells us.

280
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:43,039
Again here, Paul is writing to a local church.

281
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,999
He's writing to the church at Philippi.

282
00:13:44,999 --> 00:13:49,679
It's a church that God allowed him personally to be able to see established and we find

283
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:52,999
that he's writing back to this church and he's giving them instruction.

284
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:57,779
And notice in verse number one of Philippians two, he says, if there be therefore any consolation

285
00:13:57,779 --> 00:14:02,639
in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the spirit, if any bowels and

286
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:10,139
mercies fulfill my joy, notice that ye be like minded, having the same love, being of

287
00:14:10,319 --> 00:14:13,319
one accord, of one mind.

288
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:14,319
Do you see that?

289
00:14:14,319 --> 00:14:18,859
I mean obviously the idea of unity is screaming from this verse of scripture where he says

290
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:24,279
that we're like minded, that we're of one accord, that we're of one mind.

291
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:31,399
But notice as he continues, let nothing be done through strife or vainglory.

292
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:35,919
But in lowliness of mind, let each esteem other better than themselves, looking not

293
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:39,039
every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.

294
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:46,419
You know, so often the way that unity gets disrupted is by pride, is by pride.

295
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:50,719
I want my way, I want this done and so on and so forth and it can disrupt unity.

296
00:14:50,719 --> 00:14:56,519
And so the path to unity, the key verse number five of Philippians two, let this mind be

297
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:59,639
in you which was also in Christ Jesus.

298
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:05,179
And so we have the mind of Christ and we find that as God would give us the instruction

299
00:15:05,179 --> 00:15:12,379
on the path to unity, that it must be that we take and we accept the truth of God's

300
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:16,419
Word and we agree that we're going to agree with God.

301
00:15:16,419 --> 00:15:18,419
Here's a thought tonight.

302
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:23,559
I don't have to agree with you and you don't have to agree with me.

303
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:28,459
But we must agree with God, amen?

304
00:15:28,459 --> 00:15:30,299
And here's what brings unity.

305
00:15:30,299 --> 00:15:34,619
When you agree with God and I agree with God, guess what the byproduct is?

306
00:15:34,619 --> 00:15:35,979
Unity.

307
00:15:35,979 --> 00:15:38,819
We agree with each other because we're agreeing with God.

308
00:15:38,819 --> 00:15:41,259
Does that make sense tonight?

309
00:15:41,259 --> 00:15:46,819
So the reality is that what happens so often when those people in Corinth, I'm of Paul,

310
00:15:46,819 --> 00:15:52,979
I'm of Cephas, I'm of, there's these divisions that are brewing out of I'm better than you

311
00:15:52,979 --> 00:15:54,619
because I'm of.

312
00:15:54,619 --> 00:16:00,939
The divisions that were brewing in Corinth based on the gifts of the Holy Spirit of God,

313
00:16:00,939 --> 00:16:04,279
the spiritual gifts and they said, well I have this spiritual gift and therefore I'm

314
00:16:04,319 --> 00:16:05,319
better than you.

315
00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:06,319
And what does Paul say?

316
00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:07,959
Who gave you the gift?

317
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:10,479
The Holy Spirit of God gave you the gift.

318
00:16:10,479 --> 00:16:13,959
And so if he's the one that gave you the gift, why are you boasting in the gift?

319
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:17,559
Why is it resulting in this division?

320
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:21,739
We find that he says here, let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus.

321
00:16:21,739 --> 00:16:26,919
And so we must get self out of the equation and we must determine that we're going to

322
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:30,039
agree with the Lord.

323
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:33,559
Look in the book of Ephesians, if you will, again another church that's being written

324
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:38,459
to here in Ephesians chapter number four, and I want you to notice what Paul says to

325
00:16:38,459 --> 00:16:45,359
this church in Ephesus as we consider the fact that God's plan is for unity but there's

326
00:16:45,359 --> 00:16:47,059
a path for unity.

327
00:16:47,059 --> 00:16:50,919
And here in Ephesians chapter number four in verse number one, notice what Paul says,

328
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:57,159
I therefore the prisoner of the Lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation wherewith

329
00:16:57,159 --> 00:16:58,999
you are called.

330
00:16:58,999 --> 00:17:03,679
Notice what he says, with all lowliness and meekness with longsuffering forbearing one

331
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:04,679
another in love.

332
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:12,199
And so again, we see the humility, right, not having the sin of the flesh and the pride

333
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:13,199
that would enter.

334
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:17,759
And he says, no, with all lowliness and meekness with longsuffering forbearing one another

335
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:19,359
in love.

336
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:28,599
Look at verse three, endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.

337
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:33,519
What did he say in 1 Thessalonians 5 verse 13, the last statement, and be at peace among

338
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:34,519
yourselves.

339
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:39,839
And here Paul says endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.

340
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:44,839
The word endeavoring is a great word, it's really the idea of laboring for something,

341
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:46,719
to labor for something.

342
00:17:46,719 --> 00:17:52,719
It has the idea of desiring whatever that something is here in the context that unity,

343
00:17:52,719 --> 00:17:57,819
we desire unity and therefore we are diligent to get unity.

344
00:17:58,039 --> 00:18:01,439
But how do we get the unity, what is the path to unity?

345
00:18:01,439 --> 00:18:05,599
It must be that we determine that we're going to agree with God, that we're going to agree

346
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:06,599
with God.

347
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:09,639
And if we're going to agree with God, then we can have unity.

348
00:18:09,639 --> 00:18:15,199
But if the standard is me or if the standard is you and it's that you must come to my position

349
00:18:15,199 --> 00:18:20,279
or I must come to your position, that's never going to result in unity.

350
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:21,279
Why?

351
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:25,319
Because I might say it for a little while, but deep down I really don't agree with you.

352
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:26,939
And deep down you don't really agree with me.

353
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:31,539
But if you say I want to agree with God, what does God say?

354
00:18:31,539 --> 00:18:35,739
That's why we're to be students of the Scripture, we're to study the word, we're to study to

355
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:40,959
show ourselves approved unto God, we're to understand that as we're going to have this

356
00:18:40,959 --> 00:18:45,779
unity, if we're going to endeavor to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace

357
00:18:45,779 --> 00:18:47,459
that we must labor for it.

358
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:48,459
Why?

359
00:18:48,459 --> 00:18:50,739
Because there's an enemy that wants to disrupt it.

360
00:18:50,739 --> 00:18:54,739
There's an enemy that wants to cause division and to cause turmoil.

361
00:18:55,159 --> 00:18:58,279
And you find that there's times in which there are some people that want to come in that

362
00:18:58,279 --> 00:19:00,079
cause division.

363
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:02,559
It happens.

364
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:07,219
I've been asked in the past, why do you have to have a doctrinal statement that's so detailed?

365
00:19:07,219 --> 00:19:10,759
Because we believe what the Bible says.

366
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:14,440
You know, you could have made it really simple, pastor, if you just said we believe God, we

367
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,519
believe the Bible, we believe in heaven.

368
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:21,239
That's just too generic.

369
00:19:21,239 --> 00:19:23,519
Amen?

370
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:27,500
Because the reality is that if we're going to have unity, we have to agree with God and

371
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,779
His word.

372
00:19:28,779 --> 00:19:35,139
And so when we come to this thought this evening that Paul gives to the church at Thessalonica,

373
00:19:35,139 --> 00:19:40,059
this church that's under intense hardship and persecution and all that they're dealing

374
00:19:40,059 --> 00:19:44,979
with, and Paul says, listen, I want you to be aware, as I give you this instruction,

375
00:19:44,979 --> 00:19:49,619
I want you to be aware of the relationship between a church and its pastor.

376
00:19:49,619 --> 00:19:53,179
But I also want you to understand the importance of unity.

377
00:19:53,179 --> 00:20:00,039
And I want you to, as he uses the terminology, to be at peace among yourselves.

378
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:01,399
to be at peace among yourselves.

379
00:20:01,399 --> 00:20:04,959
Well, how is it, if we acknowledge that that's God's plan,

380
00:20:04,959 --> 00:20:07,879
how is it that we can accomplish that?

381
00:20:07,879 --> 00:20:11,719
What is the path by which we can obtain that unity?

382
00:20:11,719 --> 00:20:13,479
Notice in 1 Timothy 3,

383
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:15,839
and we're gonna look at this final verse this evening,

384
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:18,759
and really just look at what God tells Timothy.

385
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:21,719
Now, Timothy is not a church, but he's a leader of a church,

386
00:20:21,719 --> 00:20:23,679
and he's giving Timothy this truth,

387
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,479
and I think it's very insightful for us

388
00:20:25,479 --> 00:20:28,479
with regard to the path to unity,

389
00:20:28,479 --> 00:20:30,319
as we desire this evening,

390
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:35,239
to have a church that is unified, a church that has unity.

391
00:20:35,239 --> 00:20:40,159
In 1 Timothy 3, notice in verse 15,

392
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:44,839
the Bible says, but if I tarry long,

393
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:47,119
that thou mayest know how thou oughtest

394
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:50,039
to behave thyself in the house of God.

395
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:51,319
Now, notice what he refers to

396
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:53,879
and how he refers to the house of God.

397
00:20:53,879 --> 00:20:56,119
He says, which is the church of the living God,

398
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:58,879
the pillar and ground of what?

399
00:20:58,879 --> 00:21:00,479
Of the truth.

400
00:21:00,479 --> 00:21:01,759
Now, we know what truth is.

401
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:02,999
Truth is God's word.

402
00:21:02,999 --> 00:21:04,319
Sanctify them by thy word.

403
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:07,679
Thy word is truth, John 17 in verse 17.

404
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,479
And so, the church is to be the pillar.

405
00:21:09,479 --> 00:21:11,079
It's the church of the living God.

406
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:14,479
It's the pillar and ground of the truth.

407
00:21:14,479 --> 00:21:17,599
And so, if a church is going to have unity,

408
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:20,479
that unity is only going to be achieved

409
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:23,519
as we have the mind of Christ,

410
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:26,839
as we take the truth and the teaching of God's word

411
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:30,239
and say, okay, here's what we're gonna agree to.

412
00:21:30,239 --> 00:21:33,479
Often, as I have opportunities to have counsel

413
00:21:33,479 --> 00:21:36,079
with people over the years,

414
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:37,639
I've often said this sort of thing

415
00:21:37,639 --> 00:21:40,359
as we'd sit in my office and I'd say something like this.

416
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:41,959
Before we begin this discussion,

417
00:21:41,959 --> 00:21:45,239
can we agree that we're gonna agree with God's word?

418
00:21:47,719 --> 00:21:49,719
Can we agree that we're gonna agree

419
00:21:49,719 --> 00:21:51,479
with what God's word says?

420
00:21:51,479 --> 00:21:52,679
I'm gonna open the scriptures.

421
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:54,519
I'm gonna show you what the scriptures say.

422
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:57,399
And I'm gonna take you to the Bible verses.

423
00:21:57,399 --> 00:22:01,959
And this is the truth that God has left us with.

424
00:22:01,959 --> 00:22:05,239
And if we're truly going to achieve and have that unity,

425
00:22:05,239 --> 00:22:08,279
there's a path by which we must take.

426
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:11,279
And it's that we elevate the Lord Jesus Christ,

427
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:14,519
that we humble ourselves and that we elevate his word

428
00:22:14,519 --> 00:22:15,639
and say, it's not about me.

429
00:22:15,639 --> 00:22:17,039
It's not about you.

430
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,759
It's about the Lord Jesus Christ.

431
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:21,599
It's about the work of his kingdom

432
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:23,879
about the work of his church.

433
00:22:23,879 --> 00:22:25,399
And we're going to determine

434
00:22:25,399 --> 00:22:28,039
that we're going to be Bible-based.

435
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:30,879
We're gonna do what God says in his word.

436
00:22:30,879 --> 00:22:33,039
Now, when we start throwing the Bible out

437
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:36,799
and every man does that, which is right in his own sight,

438
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,599
and say, well, this is how I was raised.

439
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:39,879
This is what my background is.

440
00:22:39,879 --> 00:22:41,799
This is my this, this is my that.

441
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:44,879
Then all of a sudden you get all kinds of different

442
00:22:44,879 --> 00:22:47,119
and all of a sudden there's no unity.

443
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:48,119
There's no unity.

444
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:50,599
The thing that's awesome about the Bible

445
00:22:50,599 --> 00:22:52,559
is that the Bible is cross-cultural.

446
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:56,199
The Bible is true.

447
00:22:56,199 --> 00:22:57,919
No matter where you go,

448
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,719
you can preach the truth of this Bible.

449
00:23:00,719 --> 00:23:02,399
And that's awesome.

450
00:23:02,399 --> 00:23:04,279
You don't have to change the Bible

451
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:07,879
because of the group of people that you're speaking to,

452
00:23:07,879 --> 00:23:09,759
the culture in which you find yourself.

453
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:11,919
No, the Bible is cross-cultural.

454
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:12,759
Why?

455
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:15,319
Because God is the author of the Bible.

456
00:23:15,319 --> 00:23:16,839
And so because he's the author of the Bible,

457
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:18,879
the Bible is cross-cultural.

458
00:23:18,879 --> 00:23:23,879
It's supposed to be used in every area of this world.

459
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,359
And as we think about the globe and all that's therein,

460
00:23:26,359 --> 00:23:27,479
and we think about churches

461
00:23:27,479 --> 00:23:28,799
and how churches can have unity

462
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,399
as they agree with God and his word.

463
00:23:31,399 --> 00:23:33,079
Somebody said this, and I'll finish with this.

464
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:36,239
Some of you've heard this illustration before, no doubt,

465
00:23:36,239 --> 00:23:40,319
but they're speaking about a tuning fork on a piano.

466
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:41,159
Now, I don't even know

467
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:43,319
that they really use tuning forks anymore,

468
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:45,479
but they used to, that's how they would tune a piano.

469
00:23:45,479 --> 00:23:48,639
They use some other very sophisticated material,

470
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:50,319
different things when they come in now,

471
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:52,899
but a tuning fork would be used to tune a piano.

472
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:55,759
Now, something that's interesting about a tuning fork

473
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:57,599
is that when you bring that tuning fork in,

474
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:00,159
you are setting the piano to that tuning fork.

475
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:01,439
That is the standard.

476
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:02,759
The tuning fork is the standard.

477
00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:03,919
Does that make sense tonight?

478
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:06,359
And I'm not a musician, not a piano player,

479
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:07,999
but I understand enough

480
00:24:07,999 --> 00:24:09,439
that if we're gonna tune this piano,

481
00:24:09,439 --> 00:24:12,519
if we have a tuning fork, even if the tuning fork is off,

482
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:15,319
that piano is going to be tuned to the tuning fork.

483
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:17,199
Does that make sense tonight?

484
00:24:17,199 --> 00:24:18,939
So, if someone comes here with a tuning fork

485
00:24:18,939 --> 00:24:20,319
and they tune this piano,

486
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:22,379
and they tune it to this tuning fork,

487
00:24:22,379 --> 00:24:23,899
and then they go down to my house,

488
00:24:23,899 --> 00:24:25,119
I have a piano in my house,

489
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:26,839
and they use that same tuning fork

490
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:29,479
and they tune the piano in my house to that tuning fork,

491
00:24:29,479 --> 00:24:31,359
and then they drive over to the Fezdekian's house

492
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:32,519
because they have a piano in their house

493
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:34,139
and they use that same tuning fork

494
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,759
and they use that tuning fork to tune their piano,

495
00:24:36,759 --> 00:24:37,799
then they drive over to the Mills

496
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:39,159
because they have a piano in their house.

497
00:24:39,159 --> 00:24:41,319
And then to the Trejo's, all these pianos,

498
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:42,479
and they use the same tuning fork.

499
00:24:42,479 --> 00:24:44,479
You know what's gonna be the byproduct?

500
00:24:44,479 --> 00:24:47,919
This piano, and that piano, and their piano,

501
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,839
and their piano, and their piano

502
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:52,659
are all going to be in tune with one another.

503
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:53,499
Why?

504
00:24:53,499 --> 00:24:55,199
Because they use the same tuning fork.

505
00:24:56,239 --> 00:24:57,679
Use the same tuning fork.

506
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:59,479
The same standard.

507
00:24:59,479 --> 00:25:01,079
So, guess what our standard is?

508
00:25:02,219 --> 00:25:04,479
Right here, the Bible.

509
00:25:04,479 --> 00:25:09,359
And if this is the standard, then we can have unity,

510
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:12,079
even with diverse backgrounds,

511
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:14,399
with diverse upbringings,

512
00:25:14,399 --> 00:25:17,639
with all sorts of things that we have

513
00:25:17,639 --> 00:25:21,599
of who we are as individuals.

514
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:23,479
We come before the Lord and we say,

515
00:25:23,479 --> 00:25:26,039
nope, this is the standard,

516
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:28,859
and if we abide by this, we can have unity.

517
00:25:28,859 --> 00:25:30,219
It's amazing.

518
00:25:30,219 --> 00:25:31,519
It's absolutely amazing.

519
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:33,319
That's why you've often heard me say

520
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:36,679
that my identity, first and foremost,

521
00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:37,879
is that I'm a Christian.

522
00:25:38,879 --> 00:25:41,359
And if that's our identity, that I'm a Christian,

523
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:43,999
I'm a follower of Jesus Christ,

524
00:25:43,999 --> 00:25:46,079
and that's the approach that each one

525
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:49,559
in a local assembly takes, we can have that unity.

526
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,839
And we find here this evening that Paul,

527
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:55,199
as he's writing to this church in Thessalonica,

528
00:25:55,199 --> 00:25:57,519
he says, and be at peace among yourselves.

529
00:25:57,519 --> 00:25:59,319
You know, it's very insightful to me

530
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:00,719
that he would say to this church,

531
00:26:00,719 --> 00:26:02,159
a good church, a model church,

532
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,359
we laid the groundwork for that two weeks ago,

533
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:06,039
and how the church at Thessalonica,

534
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:08,999
five reasons that they're a model church,

535
00:26:08,999 --> 00:26:10,239
and we look now, we say,

536
00:26:10,239 --> 00:26:12,439
man, he's talking to them about the relationship

537
00:26:12,439 --> 00:26:14,099
between a church and its pastor,

538
00:26:14,099 --> 00:26:15,999
and he's talking about unity.

539
00:26:15,999 --> 00:26:18,239
Why is he dealing with these subjects?

540
00:26:18,239 --> 00:26:20,639
Why is he giving this instruction

541
00:26:20,639 --> 00:26:22,599
to a church that's a model church?

542
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:24,759
Well, because, you know, it's amazing

543
00:26:24,759 --> 00:26:27,939
how quickly the unity can be disrupted.

544
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:33,199
And almost always, it's when someone or someones

545
00:26:33,199 --> 00:26:36,739
get a little sideways, and they get a little bit prideful,

546
00:26:36,739 --> 00:26:38,959
and they get a little bit all about them,

547
00:26:38,959 --> 00:26:42,839
and they forsake this, they wanna go over here,

548
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:45,879
and all of a sudden, they can disrupt the unity

549
00:26:45,879 --> 00:26:50,279
that God's plan for a local church is to have unity.

550
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:51,839
And what's the path?

551
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:53,999
The path is that we agree with God.

552
00:26:55,019 --> 00:26:56,239
Again, you don't have to agree with me,

553
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:57,879
I don't have to agree with you,

554
00:26:57,879 --> 00:26:59,719
but we must agree with God.

555
00:26:59,719 --> 00:27:02,179
And if I agree with God, and you agree with God,

556
00:27:02,179 --> 00:27:05,659
then we agree, amen?

557
00:27:05,659 --> 00:27:07,439
I say, that's oversimplified.

558
00:27:07,439 --> 00:27:10,619
I know, but that's the way it works.

559
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:15,199
A church, God's plan for a church

560
00:27:15,199 --> 00:27:18,199
is that they would have unity, unity in the church.

561
00:27:18,199 --> 00:27:19,859
Be at peace among yourselves.

562
00:27:19,859 --> 00:27:21,839
Let's pray, Father, how we love you,

563
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:24,119
and how we thank you for loving us.

564
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:25,679
I pray, Lord, that you would help us

565
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,599
in our church to have unity.

566
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:29,039
I pray that you'd help us, Lord,

567
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:32,219
to be students of your word, that we would know you,

568
00:27:32,219 --> 00:27:35,239
and Lord, that we would seek you, that we would serve you.

569
00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:37,759
I pray that you'd help us to be humble, Lord,

570
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:40,599
that we would have the mind of Christ.

571
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:44,539
I pray, Lord, that if or when divisions and schisms

572
00:27:44,539 --> 00:27:47,799
would rise up, that you'd help us to deal with them quickly,

573
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:50,159
Lord, so that we could have, that we would endeavor

574
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:53,679
to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace.

575
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:56,019
I pray, Lord, that you would use us

576
00:27:56,019 --> 00:27:56,979
for your honor and for your glory.

577
00:27:56,979 --> 00:27:59,279
Help us not to get distracted, Lord.

578
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,639
Help us to have that unity, and we'll thank you for it.

579
00:28:01,639 --> 00:28:02,639
Bless our time of prayer.

580
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:03,879
We thank you for the privilege.

581
00:28:03,879 --> 00:28:06,399
Thank you that you hear us, and you answer,

582
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:07,719
that you're able to do exceeding abundantly

583
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:08,999
above all that we ask or think.

584
00:28:08,999 --> 00:28:10,999
I pray that you'd bless now, for it's in Christ's name

585
00:28:10,999 --> 00:28:12,639
we pray, amen.

586
00:28:12,639 --> 00:28:13,639
Does anyone need a?
