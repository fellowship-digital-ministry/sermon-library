WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
of the year that Brianna, along with one of her classmates

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.159
there at college, helped us in writing that song

00:00:07.159 --> 00:00:10.159
and the words along with the music.

00:00:10.159 --> 00:00:12.359
And so I hope that you'll catch that tune

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:15.260
and be singing it, and certainly a great truth

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.680
and great blessing of the importance of continuing

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.139
and very thankful for that song.

00:00:21.139 --> 00:00:23.139
I hope you're working on the memory verse

00:00:23.139 --> 00:00:26.940
for the month of January, 1 Timothy 1, 17,

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.559
and that's the memory verse for the month of January,

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:31.940
1 Timothy 1, 17, I hope you're working on that,

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:32.979
commit it to memory.

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:36.500
If you do it all year long, you'll have 12 verses memorized

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.979
by the end of the year from 1 and 2 Timothy.

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:40.900
All the verses will be from those two books

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.959
as we preach through those books

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:44.200
on Sunday morning this year.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.540
1 Thessalonians chapter five, last week we looked

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.659
at verses 12 and 13 and dealt with the subject matter

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:54.139
of a pastor, or excuse me, a church and its pastor.

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:56.580
A church and its pastor, we talked about the responsibility

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.659
of the pastor, the responsibility of the church,

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:01.939
and we mentioned this last week that the last statement

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:04.940
of verse number 13 would be the focus

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.860
of our attention this evening,

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.419
and as we continue studying through this instruction

00:01:09.419 --> 00:01:11.459
that is given to the church at Thessalonica,

00:01:11.459 --> 00:01:13.779
we see the subject matter of unity

00:01:13.779 --> 00:01:15.260
being addressed this evening.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.779
Notice the end of verse number 13,

00:01:17.779 --> 00:01:21.540
the Bible says, and be at peace among yourselves,

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.080
and be at peace among yourselves.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.580
It is necessary that we understand the importance

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.459
of unity in the church.

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:31.220
The enemy, we have an enemy, and we understand

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.419
that we have an enemy personally,

00:01:32.419 --> 00:01:34.739
but we corporately, collectively have an enemy,

00:01:34.739 --> 00:01:38.620
and the enemy desires, his desire is to destroy

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.319
the unity of the church.

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:41.980
I believe as you study through the book of Acts

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.300
that you find that initially the attack of Satan

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.940
on the church was from without.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.339
Through persecution and all that the church endured

00:01:50.339 --> 00:01:52.059
in those early days of the book of Acts,

00:01:52.059 --> 00:01:56.459
we find that the enemy was seeking to stifle,

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.300
to stop the advancement of the church,

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.580
the preaching of the gospel,

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.059
and he used that persecution,

00:02:01.059 --> 00:02:03.180
but we know this as we come to Acts chapter number eight,

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.459
and verse number four, the Bible says,

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:06.260
they that were scattered abroad went everywhere

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.539
preaching the word, hallelujah,

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.339
that they went everywhere preaching the word,

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:13.419
but Satan recognized that his tactic did not work,

00:02:13.419 --> 00:02:15.119
and some have said it this way,

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:18.660
that the fires of persecution that burned in Jerusalem,

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.139
that when they tried to stamp them out at the gospel,

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:25.740
excuse me, the fire of the embers of the gospel,

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.820
when they tried to stamp it out through persecution,

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.779
spread the embers around the world,

00:02:29.779 --> 00:02:32.699
and certainly there's great truth to that,

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:35.059
and so we find that as we continue to study

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.899
through the book of Acts,

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:39.539
and even into the history throughout the New Testament,

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:44.460
that Satan, he really begins to change his approach,

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.960
and he learned the ineffectiveness of that tactic

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.740
of persecution he saw to attack the church from within.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.259
What is it that he uses within?

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.339
Well, of course, we know false doctrine, false teaching,

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:57.899
no doubt that that's part of it,

00:02:57.899 --> 00:02:59.779
but specifically with regard to the subject

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:02.100
that we'll deal with tonight of unity,

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.100
we find that he uses divisions and schisms

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.940
to render the church ineffective.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.759
Now think about this, if a church has turmoil within,

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:15.860
resulting in the focus and attention being inward

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.960
and not outward, so often we think about churches

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.300
that do not have unity,

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.619
there's that lack of unity within a church,

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:24.339
and you find that there's so much focus,

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:27.100
so much resource that's given to all that's taking place,

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.660
the fighting, the tension, the division,

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.059
all those things inside, all of a sudden,

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:35.300
we've lost focus of what our real purpose is,

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.600
and that is to reach the world

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.740
with the gospel of Jesus Christ,

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.559
and so we find that the enemy has been seeking

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:45.199
to provide disunity, to cause disunity

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:49.500
within the household of faith, within the church of God.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.660
The Lord, however, is our peace,

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.339
and I believe that he places an emphasis in his word

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:57.619
on the subject of unity.

00:03:57.619 --> 00:03:59.179
If you are taking notes this evening,

00:03:59.179 --> 00:04:01.919
I've titled the message from this last phrase

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:05.839
of 1 Thessalonians 5, 13, unity in the church,

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:07.539
unity in the church.

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:10.380
Number one this evening, God's plan for unity.

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:11.940
We're gonna look at a number of verses tonight,

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.940
because we see that the text of scripture

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.100
simply says, and be at peace among yourselves,

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.440
but we begin to look at God's plan for unity,

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:22.480
and I would argue this evening, biblically,

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.519
as we'll look at a number of scriptures tonight,

00:04:24.519 --> 00:04:28.600
that it is God's plan for his people to be in unity,

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.880
and we find all the way back in Psalm 138,

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.320
it's a familiar verse of scripture,

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.760
but I'll read it this evening,

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.239
as we consider this thought tonight of unity

00:04:36.239 --> 00:04:38.119
and God's plan for unity,

00:04:38.119 --> 00:04:40.820
and we find that in Psalm 138, in verse number,

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.660
it's not Psalm 138, I got a typo here,

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.640
but it's when, behold, chapter 133,

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.359
I can't read my own writing,

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.040
Psalm 133, in verse number one,

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:56.040
behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.920
to dwell together in unity.

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.239
Psalm 133, in verse number one.

00:05:03.239 --> 00:05:05.959
I don't know about you, but just personally,

00:05:05.959 --> 00:05:10.500
I am not a big fan or advocate of fighting, division.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.920
I know, sometimes you meet people that just like to fight,

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.459
you ever meet somebody like that?

00:05:16.459 --> 00:05:17.920
Yeah, I mean, it's like their calling in life,

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.160
they just gotta be divisive,

00:05:19.959 --> 00:05:20.959
and that's just the way they are,

00:05:20.959 --> 00:05:23.000
you say it's blue and they know it's green,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.239
you say, I mean, that's just the way it is, right?

00:05:25.239 --> 00:05:27.079
And there's some people that like fighting,

00:05:27.079 --> 00:05:29.000
it just seems like they're bent toward that.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.100
I personally, I don't like it, I don't care for it,

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.459
I don't like disagreement, I don't like arguments,

00:05:33.459 --> 00:05:35.019
I don't like that type of thing,

00:05:35.019 --> 00:05:38.119
but we see here that God says, behold, how good

00:05:38.119 --> 00:05:41.440
and how pleasant it is for brethren

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.440
to dwell together in unity, in unity.

00:05:47.239 --> 00:05:49.679
Now, we look at this verse of scripture

00:05:49.679 --> 00:05:52.239
and we see really the beginning of this thought

00:05:52.239 --> 00:05:54.679
of God's plan for unity, I want you to go

00:05:54.679 --> 00:05:56.640
to the New Testament as we think specifically

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.119
about the church this evening,

00:05:58.119 --> 00:05:59.799
go to the book of Romans, if you will,

00:05:59.799 --> 00:06:02.399
and we'll look at a number of verses of scripture tonight,

00:06:02.399 --> 00:06:05.140
and go to Romans chapter number 12,

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.720
and I want you to see what God's plan is

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.380
for unity within his church, within his people.

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:13.720
We find that here in Romans, and again in 1 Corinthians,

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.000
we won't take the time to look

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.040
in the 1 Corinthians chapter 12 and following there

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.320
with regard to the same analogy that's used,

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.320
but here in Romans chapter 12, in verse number five,

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:28.760
notice what the Bible says, so we, being many,

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:33.760
are one body in Christ, and every one member

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.720
is one of another, and then he talks about

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.959
the different gifts and how he's given gifts

00:06:37.959 --> 00:06:39.920
to the church and so on and so forth,

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.200
but we see that statement in Romans 12, five,

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:46.559
where it says, so we, being many, are one body in Christ.

00:06:46.559 --> 00:06:48.399
You think about the unity.

00:06:48.399 --> 00:06:50.320
Listen, I'm thankful this evening,

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.079
and I'm sure that you are as well,

00:06:52.079 --> 00:06:54.100
that when your brain tells your right hand

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:56.160
to do something, it does it, right?

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:00.119
Your body works in agreement, and there's certain aspect.

00:07:00.119 --> 00:07:03.440
You wanna walk over there, and you just kinda,

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.500
you walk over there, right?

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.359
Your body functions as one.

00:07:07.359 --> 00:07:10.320
If my foot says to my hand, I'm not gonna do this,

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.399
Paul deals with that in the book of 1 Corinthians,

00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:17.320
and so we find that we're many members, but we're one body.

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:20.079
God is giving us this insight with regard

00:07:20.079 --> 00:07:21.440
to his plan for unity.

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.359
Look at 1 Corinthians, if you will,

00:07:23.359 --> 00:07:24.920
and as we look at 1 Corinthians,

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:28.040
we're obviously familiar with the church in Corinth,

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:31.480
and understanding that this church in Corinth

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:34.399
was a church that dealt with a number

00:07:34.399 --> 00:07:37.619
of divisions and contentions, but I want you to notice

00:07:37.619 --> 00:07:40.779
how Paul begins to issue this call

00:07:40.779 --> 00:07:43.299
to this church in Corinth in chapter one,

00:07:43.299 --> 00:07:45.940
in verse number 10, and really revealing

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:48.739
to us God's plan for unity.

00:07:48.739 --> 00:07:50.640
Notice what the Bible says in 1 Corinthians one,

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:54.739
in verse number 10, now I beseech you, brethren,

00:07:54.739 --> 00:07:57.179
by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:07:57.179 --> 00:08:00.480
So Paul is not begging the believers in Corinth

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:04.260
based on his own desire, based on his own goal

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.440
or ambition for the church.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:08.119
No, he says, I beseech you, brethren,

00:08:08.119 --> 00:08:11.320
by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:14.440
that ye all speak the same thing,

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:18.000
and that there be no divisions among you.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.320
He didn't say that there be fewer divisions among you.

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:24.279
He said that there be no divisions among you.

00:08:24.279 --> 00:08:25.880
That's unity.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.760
Notice he continues and says this,

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:31.320
but that ye be perfectly joined together

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:34.640
in the same mind and in the same judgment,

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:40.559
for it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren,

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:42.559
by them which are the house of Chloe,

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:47.080
that there are contentions among you.

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:50.080
So we know of the contentions, we know of the divisions.

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.659
He immediately enters into the situation

00:08:52.659 --> 00:08:55.359
where they were saying, I am of Paul,

00:08:55.359 --> 00:08:57.679
I'm of Apollos, I'm of Cephas, I'm of Christ,

00:08:57.679 --> 00:08:59.679
and what have you, and these schisms

00:08:59.679 --> 00:09:03.479
that were just brewing in the church at Corinth,

00:09:03.479 --> 00:09:07.320
and we find that Paul says that he's beseeching them

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.520
by the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:12.320
Notice that you speak the same thing,

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:15.280
and that there be no divisions among you,

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:17.659
but that ye be perfectly joined together,

00:09:17.659 --> 00:09:20.880
notice, in the same mind, in the same judgment.

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:23.159
What is that same mind that he's speaking of?

00:09:23.159 --> 00:09:25.780
Well, I believe, and we'll get to it later this evening,

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:28.020
it's the mind of Christ.

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:32.359
And we find that Paul is helping us to understand here

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:35.159
that it's been reported, Paul believes,

00:09:35.159 --> 00:09:39.000
he understands what's taking place there in the church,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.239
and he says that there are contentions among you,

00:09:42.239 --> 00:09:45.520
there are divisions among you.

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:50.719
Now, remember what Jesus said about a house being divided.

00:09:50.719 --> 00:09:52.840
In Matthew chapter 12, you don't need to turn there,

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:55.719
but in verse 25, the Bible says that Jesus knew

00:09:55.719 --> 00:09:57.479
their thoughts and said unto them,

00:09:57.479 --> 00:10:00.039
every kingdom divided against itself

00:10:00.039 --> 00:10:07.539
brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand."

00:10:07.539 --> 00:10:13.099
I believe that we could obviously make the application for Matthew 12, 25 to even a church,

00:10:13.099 --> 00:10:17.819
a church that is divided, is losing its effectiveness for Christ.

00:10:17.819 --> 00:10:24.839
And so we find that the enemy desires to cause division and to disrupt the unity, but God's

00:10:24.839 --> 00:10:31.039
plan for the church is that they would be in unity, that they would have unity.

00:10:31.039 --> 00:10:32.199
We're not going to take the time.

00:10:32.199 --> 00:10:35.759
It's almost like a homework assignment this evening, but the fact of the matter is that

00:10:35.759 --> 00:10:37.839
I'm not going to check it to know if you did it or not.

00:10:37.839 --> 00:10:39.599
It's just going to be an honor system.

00:10:39.599 --> 00:10:40.599
But I want to give you this challenge.

00:10:40.599 --> 00:10:44.519
I want you to look in the book of Acts, and I want you to go through the book of Acts,

00:10:44.519 --> 00:10:47.479
the beginning chapter of the book of Acts, and I want you to see how often the Bible

00:10:47.479 --> 00:10:51.679
says that they were of one accord.

00:10:51.679 --> 00:10:53.119
One accord.

00:10:53.119 --> 00:10:54.119
One accord.

00:10:54.399 --> 00:10:58.719
Really, with one mind is the idea of that statement.

00:10:58.719 --> 00:11:03.439
And we find that the Bible says repeatedly throughout the opening chapter of the book

00:11:03.439 --> 00:11:06.279
of Acts how that they were in one accord.

00:11:06.279 --> 00:11:07.279
That's God's plan.

00:11:07.279 --> 00:11:09.799
God's plan for the church is that they would be in unity.

00:11:09.799 --> 00:11:17.939
He says here to the church at Thessalonica, and be at peace among yourselves.

00:11:17.939 --> 00:11:22.279
No fighting, no division, no turmoil, but be at peace.

00:11:22.439 --> 00:11:26.639
Now, we think about this truth, God's plan for unity, but I want you to consider this

00:11:26.639 --> 00:11:29.479
evening the path to unity.

00:11:29.479 --> 00:11:30.959
The path to unity.

00:11:30.959 --> 00:11:34.839
If we acknowledge tonight that it's God's plan for unity, for his church, for his people

00:11:34.839 --> 00:11:39.959
to be in unity, he says how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity.

00:11:39.959 --> 00:11:44.759
We find that he says Paul is beseeching the church at Corinth that they be of the same

00:11:44.759 --> 00:11:49.679
mind, that there be no divisions, that this is God's plan, that his church is a church

00:11:49.679 --> 00:11:51.919
that's unified, that has unity.

00:11:51.919 --> 00:11:55.959
What is the path by which we can achieve unity?

00:11:55.959 --> 00:12:00.559
Let me say this, it is not by ignoring doctrine.

00:12:00.559 --> 00:12:07.319
There are some today that would seek to have and really try to give this idea within Christendom

00:12:07.319 --> 00:12:12.959
and ecumenical movements that we just kind of want to have this unity and so set aside

00:12:12.959 --> 00:12:18.239
those things that would divide us and just simply embrace so we can have unity.

00:12:18.239 --> 00:12:21.079
That's not true unity.

00:12:21.239 --> 00:12:26.239
The only way to truly achieve unity as we'll look at this evening is to follow the path

00:12:26.239 --> 00:12:28.959
that God outlines for us in his word.

00:12:28.959 --> 00:12:33.999
And as we follow the path that God outlines for us in his word, we can achieve unity.

00:12:33.999 --> 00:12:39.039
We can have a church that is unified, that has that unity, and we could say how good

00:12:39.039 --> 00:12:43.119
and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity.

00:12:43.119 --> 00:12:44.599
Look back at Romans chapter 12.

00:12:44.599 --> 00:12:47.999
We were there just a moment ago in verse number five.

00:12:47.999 --> 00:12:51.159
We talked about we're many, but we're to be one body in Christ.

00:12:51.159 --> 00:12:57.079
Then notice in verses nine and 10 as God gives us some insight here with the path to unity.

00:12:57.079 --> 00:13:01.639
How is it that we can have this unity, that we can have this understanding that we're

00:13:01.639 --> 00:13:03.479
one body in Christ?

00:13:03.479 --> 00:13:10.479
Notice in verse nine, let love be without dissimulation, abhor that which is evil, cleave

00:13:10.479 --> 00:13:12.079
to that which is good.

00:13:12.079 --> 00:13:18.839
Be kindly affectionate one to another with brotherly love and honor, preferring one another.

00:13:18.839 --> 00:13:21.999
He goes through a number of other things that he lists here, but verses nine and 10 are

00:13:21.999 --> 00:13:28.639
quite insightful as we begin to think about this path to unity and really having the mind

00:13:28.639 --> 00:13:29.639
of Christ.

00:13:29.639 --> 00:13:34.439
And we say that because we couple this passage with Philippians chapter number two.

00:13:34.439 --> 00:13:40.159
Turn over there if you will and look in Philippians two and notice what the Bible tells us.

00:13:40.159 --> 00:13:43.039
Again here, Paul is writing to a local church.

00:13:43.039 --> 00:13:44.999
He's writing to the church at Philippi.

00:13:44.999 --> 00:13:49.679
It's a church that God allowed him personally to be able to see established and we find

00:13:49.679 --> 00:13:52.999
that he's writing back to this church and he's giving them instruction.

00:13:52.999 --> 00:13:57.779
And notice in verse number one of Philippians two, he says, if there be therefore any consolation

00:13:57.779 --> 00:14:02.639
in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the spirit, if any bowels and

00:14:02.639 --> 00:14:10.139
mercies fulfill my joy, notice that ye be like minded, having the same love, being of

00:14:10.319 --> 00:14:13.319
one accord, of one mind.

00:14:13.319 --> 00:14:14.319
Do you see that?

00:14:14.319 --> 00:14:18.859
I mean obviously the idea of unity is screaming from this verse of scripture where he says

00:14:18.859 --> 00:14:24.279
that we're like minded, that we're of one accord, that we're of one mind.

00:14:24.279 --> 00:14:31.399
But notice as he continues, let nothing be done through strife or vainglory.

00:14:31.399 --> 00:14:35.919
But in lowliness of mind, let each esteem other better than themselves, looking not

00:14:35.919 --> 00:14:39.039
every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.

00:14:39.039 --> 00:14:46.419
You know, so often the way that unity gets disrupted is by pride, is by pride.

00:14:46.419 --> 00:14:50.719
I want my way, I want this done and so on and so forth and it can disrupt unity.

00:14:50.719 --> 00:14:56.519
And so the path to unity, the key verse number five of Philippians two, let this mind be

00:14:56.519 --> 00:14:59.639
in you which was also in Christ Jesus.

00:14:59.639 --> 00:15:05.179
And so we have the mind of Christ and we find that as God would give us the instruction

00:15:05.179 --> 00:15:12.379
on the path to unity, that it must be that we take and we accept the truth of God's

00:15:12.379 --> 00:15:16.419
Word and we agree that we're going to agree with God.

00:15:16.419 --> 00:15:18.419
Here's a thought tonight.

00:15:18.419 --> 00:15:23.559
I don't have to agree with you and you don't have to agree with me.

00:15:23.559 --> 00:15:28.459
But we must agree with God, amen?

00:15:28.459 --> 00:15:30.299
And here's what brings unity.

00:15:30.299 --> 00:15:34.619
When you agree with God and I agree with God, guess what the byproduct is?

00:15:34.619 --> 00:15:35.979
Unity.

00:15:35.979 --> 00:15:38.819
We agree with each other because we're agreeing with God.

00:15:38.819 --> 00:15:41.259
Does that make sense tonight?

00:15:41.259 --> 00:15:46.819
So the reality is that what happens so often when those people in Corinth, I'm of Paul,

00:15:46.819 --> 00:15:52.979
I'm of Cephas, I'm of, there's these divisions that are brewing out of I'm better than you

00:15:52.979 --> 00:15:54.619
because I'm of.

00:15:54.619 --> 00:16:00.939
The divisions that were brewing in Corinth based on the gifts of the Holy Spirit of God,

00:16:00.939 --> 00:16:04.279
the spiritual gifts and they said, well I have this spiritual gift and therefore I'm

00:16:04.319 --> 00:16:05.319
better than you.

00:16:05.319 --> 00:16:06.319
And what does Paul say?

00:16:06.319 --> 00:16:07.959
Who gave you the gift?

00:16:07.959 --> 00:16:10.479
The Holy Spirit of God gave you the gift.

00:16:10.479 --> 00:16:13.959
And so if he's the one that gave you the gift, why are you boasting in the gift?

00:16:13.959 --> 00:16:17.559
Why is it resulting in this division?

00:16:17.559 --> 00:16:21.739
We find that he says here, let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus.

00:16:21.739 --> 00:16:26.919
And so we must get self out of the equation and we must determine that we're going to

00:16:26.919 --> 00:16:30.039
agree with the Lord.

00:16:30.039 --> 00:16:33.559
Look in the book of Ephesians, if you will, again another church that's being written

00:16:33.559 --> 00:16:38.459
to here in Ephesians chapter number four, and I want you to notice what Paul says to

00:16:38.459 --> 00:16:45.359
this church in Ephesus as we consider the fact that God's plan is for unity but there's

00:16:45.359 --> 00:16:47.059
a path for unity.

00:16:47.059 --> 00:16:50.919
And here in Ephesians chapter number four in verse number one, notice what Paul says,

00:16:50.919 --> 00:16:57.159
I therefore the prisoner of the Lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation wherewith

00:16:57.159 --> 00:16:58.999
you are called.

00:16:58.999 --> 00:17:03.679
Notice what he says, with all lowliness and meekness with longsuffering forbearing one

00:17:03.679 --> 00:17:04.679
another in love.

00:17:04.679 --> 00:17:12.199
And so again, we see the humility, right, not having the sin of the flesh and the pride

00:17:12.199 --> 00:17:13.199
that would enter.

00:17:13.199 --> 00:17:17.759
And he says, no, with all lowliness and meekness with longsuffering forbearing one another

00:17:17.759 --> 00:17:19.359
in love.

00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:28.599
Look at verse three, endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.

00:17:28.599 --> 00:17:33.519
What did he say in 1 Thessalonians 5 verse 13, the last statement, and be at peace among

00:17:33.519 --> 00:17:34.519
yourselves.

00:17:34.519 --> 00:17:39.839
And here Paul says endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.

00:17:39.839 --> 00:17:44.839
The word endeavoring is a great word, it's really the idea of laboring for something,

00:17:44.839 --> 00:17:46.719
to labor for something.

00:17:46.719 --> 00:17:52.719
It has the idea of desiring whatever that something is here in the context that unity,

00:17:52.719 --> 00:17:57.819
we desire unity and therefore we are diligent to get unity.

00:17:58.039 --> 00:18:01.439
But how do we get the unity, what is the path to unity?

00:18:01.439 --> 00:18:05.599
It must be that we determine that we're going to agree with God, that we're going to agree

00:18:05.599 --> 00:18:06.599
with God.

00:18:06.599 --> 00:18:09.639
And if we're going to agree with God, then we can have unity.

00:18:09.639 --> 00:18:15.199
But if the standard is me or if the standard is you and it's that you must come to my position

00:18:15.199 --> 00:18:20.279
or I must come to your position, that's never going to result in unity.

00:18:20.279 --> 00:18:21.279
Why?

00:18:21.279 --> 00:18:25.319
Because I might say it for a little while, but deep down I really don't agree with you.

00:18:25.319 --> 00:18:26.939
And deep down you don't really agree with me.

00:18:26.939 --> 00:18:31.539
But if you say I want to agree with God, what does God say?

00:18:31.539 --> 00:18:35.739
That's why we're to be students of the Scripture, we're to study the word, we're to study to

00:18:35.739 --> 00:18:40.959
show ourselves approved unto God, we're to understand that as we're going to have this

00:18:40.959 --> 00:18:45.779
unity, if we're going to endeavor to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace

00:18:45.779 --> 00:18:47.459
that we must labor for it.

00:18:47.459 --> 00:18:48.459
Why?

00:18:48.459 --> 00:18:50.739
Because there's an enemy that wants to disrupt it.

00:18:50.739 --> 00:18:54.739
There's an enemy that wants to cause division and to cause turmoil.

00:18:55.159 --> 00:18:58.279
And you find that there's times in which there are some people that want to come in that

00:18:58.279 --> 00:19:00.079
cause division.

00:19:00.079 --> 00:19:02.559
It happens.

00:19:02.559 --> 00:19:07.219
I've been asked in the past, why do you have to have a doctrinal statement that's so detailed?

00:19:07.219 --> 00:19:10.759
Because we believe what the Bible says.

00:19:10.759 --> 00:19:14.440
You know, you could have made it really simple, pastor, if you just said we believe God, we

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:17.519
believe the Bible, we believe in heaven.

00:19:17.519 --> 00:19:21.239
That's just too generic.

00:19:21.239 --> 00:19:23.519
Amen?

00:19:23.519 --> 00:19:27.500
Because the reality is that if we're going to have unity, we have to agree with God and

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:28.779
His word.

00:19:28.779 --> 00:19:35.139
And so when we come to this thought this evening that Paul gives to the church at Thessalonica,

00:19:35.139 --> 00:19:40.059
this church that's under intense hardship and persecution and all that they're dealing

00:19:40.059 --> 00:19:44.979
with, and Paul says, listen, I want you to be aware, as I give you this instruction,

00:19:44.979 --> 00:19:49.619
I want you to be aware of the relationship between a church and its pastor.

00:19:49.619 --> 00:19:53.179
But I also want you to understand the importance of unity.

00:19:53.179 --> 00:20:00.039
And I want you to, as he uses the terminology, to be at peace among yourselves.

00:20:00.039 --> 00:20:01.399
to be at peace among yourselves.

00:20:01.399 --> 00:20:04.959
Well, how is it, if we acknowledge that that's God's plan,

00:20:04.959 --> 00:20:07.879
how is it that we can accomplish that?

00:20:07.879 --> 00:20:11.719
What is the path by which we can obtain that unity?

00:20:11.719 --> 00:20:13.479
Notice in 1 Timothy 3,

00:20:13.479 --> 00:20:15.839
and we're gonna look at this final verse this evening,

00:20:15.839 --> 00:20:18.759
and really just look at what God tells Timothy.

00:20:18.759 --> 00:20:21.719
Now, Timothy is not a church, but he's a leader of a church,

00:20:21.719 --> 00:20:23.679
and he's giving Timothy this truth,

00:20:23.679 --> 00:20:25.479
and I think it's very insightful for us

00:20:25.479 --> 00:20:28.479
with regard to the path to unity,

00:20:28.479 --> 00:20:30.319
as we desire this evening,

00:20:30.319 --> 00:20:35.239
to have a church that is unified, a church that has unity.

00:20:35.239 --> 00:20:40.159
In 1 Timothy 3, notice in verse 15,

00:20:42.039 --> 00:20:44.839
the Bible says, but if I tarry long,

00:20:44.839 --> 00:20:47.119
that thou mayest know how thou oughtest

00:20:47.119 --> 00:20:50.039
to behave thyself in the house of God.

00:20:50.039 --> 00:20:51.319
Now, notice what he refers to

00:20:51.319 --> 00:20:53.879
and how he refers to the house of God.

00:20:53.879 --> 00:20:56.119
He says, which is the church of the living God,

00:20:56.119 --> 00:20:58.879
the pillar and ground of what?

00:20:58.879 --> 00:21:00.479
Of the truth.

00:21:00.479 --> 00:21:01.759
Now, we know what truth is.

00:21:01.759 --> 00:21:02.999
Truth is God's word.

00:21:02.999 --> 00:21:04.319
Sanctify them by thy word.

00:21:04.319 --> 00:21:07.679
Thy word is truth, John 17 in verse 17.

00:21:07.679 --> 00:21:09.479
And so, the church is to be the pillar.

00:21:09.479 --> 00:21:11.079
It's the church of the living God.

00:21:11.079 --> 00:21:14.479
It's the pillar and ground of the truth.

00:21:14.479 --> 00:21:17.599
And so, if a church is going to have unity,

00:21:17.599 --> 00:21:20.479
that unity is only going to be achieved

00:21:20.479 --> 00:21:23.519
as we have the mind of Christ,

00:21:24.199 --> 00:21:26.839
as we take the truth and the teaching of God's word

00:21:26.839 --> 00:21:30.239
and say, okay, here's what we're gonna agree to.

00:21:30.239 --> 00:21:33.479
Often, as I have opportunities to have counsel

00:21:33.479 --> 00:21:36.079
with people over the years,

00:21:36.079 --> 00:21:37.639
I've often said this sort of thing

00:21:37.639 --> 00:21:40.359
as we'd sit in my office and I'd say something like this.

00:21:40.359 --> 00:21:41.959
Before we begin this discussion,

00:21:41.959 --> 00:21:45.239
can we agree that we're gonna agree with God's word?

00:21:47.719 --> 00:21:49.719
Can we agree that we're gonna agree

00:21:49.719 --> 00:21:51.479
with what God's word says?

00:21:51.479 --> 00:21:52.679
I'm gonna open the scriptures.

00:21:52.679 --> 00:21:54.519
I'm gonna show you what the scriptures say.

00:21:54.519 --> 00:21:57.399
And I'm gonna take you to the Bible verses.

00:21:57.399 --> 00:22:01.959
And this is the truth that God has left us with.

00:22:01.959 --> 00:22:05.239
And if we're truly going to achieve and have that unity,

00:22:05.239 --> 00:22:08.279
there's a path by which we must take.

00:22:08.279 --> 00:22:11.279
And it's that we elevate the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:22:11.279 --> 00:22:14.519
that we humble ourselves and that we elevate his word

00:22:14.519 --> 00:22:15.639
and say, it's not about me.

00:22:15.639 --> 00:22:17.039
It's not about you.

00:22:17.039 --> 00:22:18.759
It's about the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:22:18.759 --> 00:22:21.599
It's about the work of his kingdom

00:22:21.599 --> 00:22:23.879
about the work of his church.

00:22:23.879 --> 00:22:25.399
And we're going to determine

00:22:25.399 --> 00:22:28.039
that we're going to be Bible-based.

00:22:28.039 --> 00:22:30.879
We're gonna do what God says in his word.

00:22:30.879 --> 00:22:33.039
Now, when we start throwing the Bible out

00:22:34.319 --> 00:22:36.799
and every man does that, which is right in his own sight,

00:22:36.799 --> 00:22:38.599
and say, well, this is how I was raised.

00:22:38.599 --> 00:22:39.879
This is what my background is.

00:22:39.879 --> 00:22:41.799
This is my this, this is my that.

00:22:41.799 --> 00:22:44.879
Then all of a sudden you get all kinds of different

00:22:44.879 --> 00:22:47.119
and all of a sudden there's no unity.

00:22:47.119 --> 00:22:48.119
There's no unity.

00:22:49.119 --> 00:22:50.599
The thing that's awesome about the Bible

00:22:50.599 --> 00:22:52.559
is that the Bible is cross-cultural.

00:22:53.919 --> 00:22:56.199
The Bible is true.

00:22:56.199 --> 00:22:57.919
No matter where you go,

00:22:57.919 --> 00:23:00.719
you can preach the truth of this Bible.

00:23:00.719 --> 00:23:02.399
And that's awesome.

00:23:02.399 --> 00:23:04.279
You don't have to change the Bible

00:23:04.279 --> 00:23:07.879
because of the group of people that you're speaking to,

00:23:07.879 --> 00:23:09.759
the culture in which you find yourself.

00:23:09.759 --> 00:23:11.919
No, the Bible is cross-cultural.

00:23:11.919 --> 00:23:12.759
Why?

00:23:12.759 --> 00:23:15.319
Because God is the author of the Bible.

00:23:15.319 --> 00:23:16.839
And so because he's the author of the Bible,

00:23:16.839 --> 00:23:18.879
the Bible is cross-cultural.

00:23:18.879 --> 00:23:23.879
It's supposed to be used in every area of this world.

00:23:23.919 --> 00:23:26.359
And as we think about the globe and all that's therein,

00:23:26.359 --> 00:23:27.479
and we think about churches

00:23:27.479 --> 00:23:28.799
and how churches can have unity

00:23:28.799 --> 00:23:31.399
as they agree with God and his word.

00:23:31.399 --> 00:23:33.079
Somebody said this, and I'll finish with this.

00:23:33.079 --> 00:23:36.239
Some of you've heard this illustration before, no doubt,

00:23:36.239 --> 00:23:40.319
but they're speaking about a tuning fork on a piano.

00:23:40.319 --> 00:23:41.159
Now, I don't even know

00:23:41.159 --> 00:23:43.319
that they really use tuning forks anymore,

00:23:43.319 --> 00:23:45.479
but they used to, that's how they would tune a piano.

00:23:45.479 --> 00:23:48.639
They use some other very sophisticated material,

00:23:49.279 --> 00:23:50.319
different things when they come in now,

00:23:50.319 --> 00:23:52.899
but a tuning fork would be used to tune a piano.

00:23:53.839 --> 00:23:55.759
Now, something that's interesting about a tuning fork

00:23:55.759 --> 00:23:57.599
is that when you bring that tuning fork in,

00:23:57.599 --> 00:24:00.159
you are setting the piano to that tuning fork.

00:24:00.159 --> 00:24:01.439
That is the standard.

00:24:01.439 --> 00:24:02.759
The tuning fork is the standard.

00:24:02.759 --> 00:24:03.919
Does that make sense tonight?

00:24:03.919 --> 00:24:06.359
And I'm not a musician, not a piano player,

00:24:06.359 --> 00:24:07.999
but I understand enough

00:24:07.999 --> 00:24:09.439
that if we're gonna tune this piano,

00:24:09.439 --> 00:24:12.519
if we have a tuning fork, even if the tuning fork is off,

00:24:12.519 --> 00:24:15.319
that piano is going to be tuned to the tuning fork.

00:24:15.319 --> 00:24:17.199
Does that make sense tonight?

00:24:17.199 --> 00:24:18.939
So, if someone comes here with a tuning fork

00:24:18.939 --> 00:24:20.319
and they tune this piano,

00:24:20.319 --> 00:24:22.379
and they tune it to this tuning fork,

00:24:22.379 --> 00:24:23.899
and then they go down to my house,

00:24:23.899 --> 00:24:25.119
I have a piano in my house,

00:24:25.119 --> 00:24:26.839
and they use that same tuning fork

00:24:26.839 --> 00:24:29.479
and they tune the piano in my house to that tuning fork,

00:24:29.479 --> 00:24:31.359
and then they drive over to the Fezdekian's house

00:24:31.359 --> 00:24:32.519
because they have a piano in their house

00:24:32.519 --> 00:24:34.139
and they use that same tuning fork

00:24:34.139 --> 00:24:36.759
and they use that tuning fork to tune their piano,

00:24:36.759 --> 00:24:37.799
then they drive over to the Mills

00:24:37.799 --> 00:24:39.159
because they have a piano in their house.

00:24:39.159 --> 00:24:41.319
And then to the Trejo's, all these pianos,

00:24:41.319 --> 00:24:42.479
and they use the same tuning fork.

00:24:42.479 --> 00:24:44.479
You know what's gonna be the byproduct?

00:24:44.479 --> 00:24:47.919
This piano, and that piano, and their piano,

00:24:47.919 --> 00:24:49.839
and their piano, and their piano

00:24:49.839 --> 00:24:52.659
are all going to be in tune with one another.

00:24:52.659 --> 00:24:53.499
Why?

00:24:53.499 --> 00:24:55.199
Because they use the same tuning fork.

00:24:56.239 --> 00:24:57.679
Use the same tuning fork.

00:24:57.679 --> 00:24:59.479
The same standard.

00:24:59.479 --> 00:25:01.079
So, guess what our standard is?

00:25:02.219 --> 00:25:04.479
Right here, the Bible.

00:25:04.479 --> 00:25:09.359
And if this is the standard, then we can have unity,

00:25:09.359 --> 00:25:12.079
even with diverse backgrounds,

00:25:12.079 --> 00:25:14.399
with diverse upbringings,

00:25:14.399 --> 00:25:17.639
with all sorts of things that we have

00:25:17.639 --> 00:25:21.599
of who we are as individuals.

00:25:21.599 --> 00:25:23.479
We come before the Lord and we say,

00:25:23.479 --> 00:25:26.039
nope, this is the standard,

00:25:26.039 --> 00:25:28.859
and if we abide by this, we can have unity.

00:25:28.859 --> 00:25:30.219
It's amazing.

00:25:30.219 --> 00:25:31.519
It's absolutely amazing.

00:25:31.519 --> 00:25:33.319
That's why you've often heard me say

00:25:34.359 --> 00:25:36.679
that my identity, first and foremost,

00:25:36.679 --> 00:25:37.879
is that I'm a Christian.

00:25:38.879 --> 00:25:41.359
And if that's our identity, that I'm a Christian,

00:25:41.359 --> 00:25:43.999
I'm a follower of Jesus Christ,

00:25:43.999 --> 00:25:46.079
and that's the approach that each one

00:25:46.079 --> 00:25:49.559
in a local assembly takes, we can have that unity.

00:25:50.559 --> 00:25:52.839
And we find here this evening that Paul,

00:25:52.839 --> 00:25:55.199
as he's writing to this church in Thessalonica,

00:25:55.199 --> 00:25:57.519
he says, and be at peace among yourselves.

00:25:57.519 --> 00:25:59.319
You know, it's very insightful to me

00:25:59.319 --> 00:26:00.719
that he would say to this church,

00:26:00.719 --> 00:26:02.159
a good church, a model church,

00:26:02.159 --> 00:26:04.359
we laid the groundwork for that two weeks ago,

00:26:04.359 --> 00:26:06.039
and how the church at Thessalonica,

00:26:06.039 --> 00:26:08.999
five reasons that they're a model church,

00:26:08.999 --> 00:26:10.239
and we look now, we say,

00:26:10.239 --> 00:26:12.439
man, he's talking to them about the relationship

00:26:12.439 --> 00:26:14.099
between a church and its pastor,

00:26:14.099 --> 00:26:15.999
and he's talking about unity.

00:26:15.999 --> 00:26:18.239
Why is he dealing with these subjects?

00:26:18.239 --> 00:26:20.639
Why is he giving this instruction

00:26:20.639 --> 00:26:22.599
to a church that's a model church?

00:26:22.599 --> 00:26:24.759
Well, because, you know, it's amazing

00:26:24.759 --> 00:26:27.939
how quickly the unity can be disrupted.

00:26:30.119 --> 00:26:33.199
And almost always, it's when someone or someones

00:26:33.199 --> 00:26:36.739
get a little sideways, and they get a little bit prideful,

00:26:36.739 --> 00:26:38.959
and they get a little bit all about them,

00:26:38.959 --> 00:26:42.839
and they forsake this, they wanna go over here,

00:26:42.839 --> 00:26:45.879
and all of a sudden, they can disrupt the unity

00:26:45.879 --> 00:26:50.279
that God's plan for a local church is to have unity.

00:26:50.279 --> 00:26:51.839
And what's the path?

00:26:51.839 --> 00:26:53.999
The path is that we agree with God.

00:26:55.019 --> 00:26:56.239
Again, you don't have to agree with me,

00:26:56.239 --> 00:26:57.879
I don't have to agree with you,

00:26:57.879 --> 00:26:59.719
but we must agree with God.

00:26:59.719 --> 00:27:02.179
And if I agree with God, and you agree with God,

00:27:02.179 --> 00:27:05.659
then we agree, amen?

00:27:05.659 --> 00:27:07.439
I say, that's oversimplified.

00:27:07.439 --> 00:27:10.619
I know, but that's the way it works.

00:27:11.839 --> 00:27:15.199
A church, God's plan for a church

00:27:15.199 --> 00:27:18.199
is that they would have unity, unity in the church.

00:27:18.199 --> 00:27:19.859
Be at peace among yourselves.

00:27:19.859 --> 00:27:21.839
Let's pray, Father, how we love you,

00:27:21.839 --> 00:27:24.119
and how we thank you for loving us.

00:27:24.119 --> 00:27:25.679
I pray, Lord, that you would help us

00:27:25.679 --> 00:27:27.599
in our church to have unity.

00:27:27.599 --> 00:27:29.039
I pray that you'd help us, Lord,

00:27:29.039 --> 00:27:32.219
to be students of your word, that we would know you,

00:27:32.219 --> 00:27:35.239
and Lord, that we would seek you, that we would serve you.

00:27:35.239 --> 00:27:37.759
I pray that you'd help us to be humble, Lord,

00:27:37.759 --> 00:27:40.599
that we would have the mind of Christ.

00:27:40.599 --> 00:27:44.539
I pray, Lord, that if or when divisions and schisms

00:27:44.539 --> 00:27:47.799
would rise up, that you'd help us to deal with them quickly,

00:27:47.799 --> 00:27:50.159
Lord, so that we could have, that we would endeavor

00:27:50.159 --> 00:27:53.679
to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace.

00:27:53.679 --> 00:27:56.019
I pray, Lord, that you would use us

00:27:56.019 --> 00:27:56.979
for your honor and for your glory.

00:27:56.979 --> 00:27:59.279
Help us not to get distracted, Lord.

00:27:59.279 --> 00:28:01.639
Help us to have that unity, and we'll thank you for it.

00:28:01.639 --> 00:28:02.639
Bless our time of prayer.

00:28:02.639 --> 00:28:03.879
We thank you for the privilege.

00:28:03.879 --> 00:28:06.399
Thank you that you hear us, and you answer,

00:28:06.399 --> 00:28:07.719
that you're able to do exceeding abundantly

00:28:07.719 --> 00:28:08.999
above all that we ask or think.

00:28:08.999 --> 00:28:10.999
I pray that you'd bless now, for it's in Christ's name

00:28:10.999 --> 00:28:12.639
we pray, amen.

00:28:12.639 --> 00:28:13.639
Does anyone need a?
