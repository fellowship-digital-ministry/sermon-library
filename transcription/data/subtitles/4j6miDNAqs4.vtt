00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280
Of course, at the end of chapter number one is the announcement of the birth of Christ.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:11.039
In fact, on Tuesday evening for the Christmas Eve service, I'll be focusing on a portion

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:17.319
of that, finishing that last part of Matthew chapter number one on Tuesday evening.

00:00:17.319 --> 00:00:21.399
But this morning, I want to look at chapter number two and look at these first 12 verses

00:00:21.399 --> 00:00:26.639
of this passage of Scripture as we consider these wise men that are mentioned here in

00:00:26.639 --> 00:00:28.879
this portion of Scripture.

00:00:28.879 --> 00:00:34.040
And I want you to understand that as they arrived into Jerusalem, that these wise men,

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.720
of course many times in several different aspects of the Christmas season decorations

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.040
and things, they refer to it as being three wise men because there are three gifts, but

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.799
the true condition is that we really don't know how many.

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:50.959
We know that it's plural, that there are wise men, so we know it's more than one.

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:54.880
I personally believe it was probably a whole lot more than three.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.599
Just because they had three gifts to present, I believe it was more than three.

00:00:59.319 --> 00:01:03.040
I can't prove that biblically, but I believe that as you look at the portion of Scripture

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.680
that it's interesting that when they arrive in Jerusalem, that they ask a question and

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.440
then they make a declaration.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:17.480
The question that they ask, notice in verse number two, where is he that is born King

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.480
of the Jews?

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.720
That's a great question, isn't it?

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.599
And we understand as we dig in this morning, we'll get into the text and give you some

00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:26.959
thoughts and points and what have you, but I want you to just consider for a moment the

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:32.959
question that they ask, where is he that is born King of the Jews?

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:36.959
And I'm thankful that our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, God in flesh, that he is King

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:38.959
of kings and Lord of lords.

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:43.959
We find that even in his very birth that he is referred to by these wise men as they inquire,

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:49.099
they ask the question, where is he that is born King of the Jews?

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:51.839
He came to his own, but his own received him not.

00:01:51.839 --> 00:01:54.440
That's what the Bible teaches us, amen?

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.680
Salvation is of the Jews first, but also the Gentiles.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.000
I'm thankful if you read the book of Romans and you understand the principle of the Jews

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.319
rejecting Christ, but the Gentiles being grafted in.

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:06.319
Now understand that was always the plan of God.

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:09.839
You read through the Old Testament, you can understand that he was going to die for the

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:15.279
sins of all humanity, that all the Gentiles would even know, but of course he came to

00:02:15.279 --> 00:02:18.199
the Jews first, but the Jews received him not.

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:25.039
And what a blessing to understand I have been able to receive the gospel message because

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:30.039
of their rejection and what a blessing to know the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:33.600
But he asked the question, these wise men, they asked the question, where is he that

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.039
is born King of the Jews?

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:36.699
Again, what a great question.

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:42.839
But then I want you to find that immediately following the question, they make a declaration.

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:47.160
And really it's the declaration that they make that's going to be the focus of our message

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.520
this morning.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.600
Notice where it says, for we have seen his star in the east, and then notice this, and

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.279
we are come to worship him.

00:02:58.279 --> 00:03:02.399
We are come to worship him.

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:07.520
That's the title for the message this morning, we have come to worship him.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:13.559
I hope that you came to this place this day for the purpose of worshiping the Lord Jesus

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:14.559
Christ.

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:19.520
He alone is worthy of our worship, and we understand that as we look at this passage

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:26.860
of Scripture and we see the declaration that these wise men made with regard to their purpose

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.899
of their travels, they say we are come to worship him.

00:03:31.899 --> 00:03:35.179
We could go back, we won't take the time this morning to go back to the book of Numbers

00:03:35.179 --> 00:03:39.940
and to read in the 24th chapter about the star that's mentioned there, the prophetical

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:46.460
reference, and obviously these men that came from the east, these wise men, because of

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:52.339
the Babylonian captivity, they would have been exposed to the Hebrew truth and religion

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:57.960
and even the Pentateuch, and it's amazing how our God who is just in control of all

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:03.380
things allowed all those things to come together just as they did, but I want to focus this

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.179
morning at looking at these wise men.

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:10.419
Notice in verse number one, the Bible says, now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:16.940
in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem,

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.459
saying where is he that is born king of the Jews?

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:24.179
For we have seen a star in the east and are come to worship him.

00:04:24.179 --> 00:04:29.140
When Herod the king, and it's interesting, you see in verse number two the king is capitalized,

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:33.079
right, because he is king of kings, he is the Lord, it's deity, but then you see in

00:04:33.079 --> 00:04:37.899
verse number three, Herod the king, it's lowercase because he's just an earthly figure, he's

00:04:37.899 --> 00:04:40.019
just a temporal king.

00:04:40.019 --> 00:04:42.660
The Bible says that he was troubled.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:47.339
This man, Herod, he was troubled about a lot of things, he was kind of a messed up individual,

00:04:47.339 --> 00:04:51.540
if you read about his life, he had all kinds of problems, but he hears these wise men that

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.540
enter into Jerusalem and they ask the question, where is he that is born king of the Jews?

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.859
Well this was unnerving and unsettling for Herod, and they say we come to worship him,

00:04:59.859 --> 00:05:05.920
and Herod is now troubled, and the Bible says in all Jerusalem with him, and when he had

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.720
gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, now understand for

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:16.480
a moment what Herod does in verse number four, he really gathers the religious people together,

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:22.079
the religious leaders, the Bible says that he gathered the chief priests and the scribes

00:05:22.079 --> 00:05:27.239
of the people together, and then he made this demand of them, he demanded of them where

00:05:27.239 --> 00:05:29.880
Christ should be born.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.799
Now it's interesting, for we find that the Bible says in verse number two that the question

00:05:33.799 --> 00:05:38.239
is where is he that is born king of the Jews, and then it says that we have come to worship

00:05:38.239 --> 00:05:44.839
him, and he, Herod, after he gathers together these religious leaders, the chief priests

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:50.359
and the scribes, he demands of them, notice where Christ should be born, that's the Messiah.

00:05:50.359 --> 00:05:51.359
Amen?

00:05:51.359 --> 00:05:55.160
And you follow the track, remember Paul as he's preaching the book of Acts, that this

00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:01.399
Jesus, he is the Christ, he is the Messiah, the promised one, and they said unto him in

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:05.559
verse number five, these religious leaders, they respond, and they say in Bethlehem of

00:06:05.559 --> 00:06:11.040
Judea, for thus it is written by the prophet, they knew the prophecy, they knew Micah, that's

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.839
what they're going to reference in verse number six, Micah five and verse two, and they knew

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:19.000
the prophecy, but it's interesting, not only did they have the book of Micah, but they

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.880
would have had the book of Daniel as well, and you find in the book of Daniel, there's

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:29.040
great prophecy with regard to the timing of Christ's birth, Micah with the place of Christ's

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:37.440
birth, and we find that they, although they had the prophecies, they had those available

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.760
to them, they were not looking for Messiah.

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.799
They weren't looking for him.

00:06:42.799 --> 00:06:47.440
It says in verse number six, and thou Bethlehem, referencing Micah five two, and the land of

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:52.040
Judah art not the least among the princes of Judah, for out of these shall come a governor

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:55.320
that shall rule my people Israel.

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:58.839
We're going to continue reading through the end of verse number 12 as we get through the

00:06:58.839 --> 00:07:02.880
message this morning, but let's dive in this morning, if you're taking notes, number one,

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.760
I want you to note their desire.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:10.040
Note the desire of these wise men, it's really revealed to us in verse two, I've shared it

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:14.600
by way of introduction, their desire is to worship.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:15.600
That's their desire.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:21.559
I want you to think about this clearly stated reason that they give in verse number two,

00:07:21.559 --> 00:07:27.480
with regard to their traveling, with regard to their purpose, their desire is to worship

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:28.880
Jesus.

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:33.480
The Bible teaches us many things about worship, and we'll reference several of those things

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:37.279
in just a moment, but let me remind you what the word worship means.

00:07:37.279 --> 00:07:39.480
It means to adore.

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:43.160
It means to pay divine honors to.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:49.720
It means to reverence with supreme respect and veneration.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:55.799
The word worship really is a word that's derived from the idea of worth-ship, and somebody

00:07:55.799 --> 00:08:00.600
that's being worthy, and of course we understand that the Lord Jesus Christ, he alone, God

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.119
alone is the one to be worshiped.

00:08:03.119 --> 00:08:07.839
And so we see this word worship, and you find that how they would use the word, notice very

00:08:07.839 --> 00:08:13.920
specifically, they say we are come to worship him.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:18.239
Speaking specifically of where is he that is born King of the Jews, speaking of the

00:08:18.239 --> 00:08:21.320
Lord Jesus Christ, God in flesh.

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:25.559
We understand this morning that the only one who is worthy of our worship is God, that

00:08:25.559 --> 00:08:32.080
throughout the Old Testament the people of God are instructed to worship the Lord only.

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:34.159
Thou shalt have no other gods before me.

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:35.919
You should not bow down before any idols.

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:41.359
I mean, you think about all of the instruction in the Old Testament with regard to the importance

00:08:41.359 --> 00:08:49.280
of worshiping God, but also the teaching throughout the Old Testament of refraining from worshiping

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:52.320
anything or anyone else.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.760
God alone is to be worshiped.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:09:00.080
In fact, you find that during the Babylonian captivity when Nebuchadnezzar is in power

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:05.280
and he has the book of Daniels being written, and we have that account when he builds that

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:10.719
great idol structure, and we find that he says of those that we're going to play the

00:09:10.719 --> 00:09:14.799
music and when we do, bow down and worship.

00:09:14.799 --> 00:09:18.799
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, they refused to worship, why?

00:09:18.799 --> 00:09:20.960
Because they understood biblical principle.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:25.200
They understood that only God is to be worshiped.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:29.719
They understood that it was not appropriate for them to worship this false idol that had

00:09:29.719 --> 00:09:37.479
been constructed by Nebuchadnezzar, this image that he had demanded that all the people worship.

00:09:37.559 --> 00:09:44.200
So their refusal of worshiping this image was really in obedience to God's command.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:51.840
Furthermore, I want you to understand that Jesus made this plainly evident to us in Matthew

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:52.840
chapter 4.

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:56.239
If you hold your place in Matthew 2, look at Matthew 4 just for a moment, and in Matthew

00:09:56.239 --> 00:10:00.039
chapter number 4, we have the record of Christ being led.

00:10:00.039 --> 00:10:04.999
by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.

00:10:04.999 --> 00:10:08.999
And we find that in this passage of Scripture, there's many things that are revealed to us.

00:10:08.999 --> 00:10:14.519
Of course, a great takeaway from Matthew 4, verses 1 through 11, is the importance of

00:10:14.519 --> 00:10:20.039
understanding the use of the sword of the Spirit in order to go against the attack of

00:10:20.039 --> 00:10:23.379
the enemy and how we must know the Word of God.

00:10:23.379 --> 00:10:27.859
Because the enemy is going to come and he's going to tempt and he's going to try to cause

00:10:27.859 --> 00:10:32.719
us to sin, and oh, we need to know the truth of God's Word, and we need to be able to use

00:10:32.719 --> 00:10:36.419
the sword of the Spirit effectively and continuously.

00:10:36.419 --> 00:10:41.139
In each account, the Lord Jesus Christ says, it is written.

00:10:41.139 --> 00:10:42.459
It is written.

00:10:42.459 --> 00:10:43.459
It is written.

00:10:43.459 --> 00:10:46.079
And how important that is for us.

00:10:46.079 --> 00:10:49.819
But I want you to notice in the third account, in verse number 8, the Bible says, again,

00:10:49.819 --> 00:10:55.019
the devil taketh him, speaking of Jesus, up into an exceeding high mountain, and showeth

00:10:55.019 --> 00:10:57.779
him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them.

00:10:57.779 --> 00:11:03.379
And notice where he says, he saith unto him, all these things will I give thee, if thou

00:11:03.379 --> 00:11:07.219
wilt fall down and worship me.

00:11:07.219 --> 00:11:10.339
Now you understand, we don't have time this morning, but if you were to go back to the

00:11:10.339 --> 00:11:15.079
Old Testament, Isaiah and Ezekiel, you'll find that the reason that Lucifer fell is

00:11:15.079 --> 00:11:17.059
because he desired to be like God.

00:11:17.059 --> 00:11:18.739
He had a pride issue.

00:11:18.739 --> 00:11:21.139
I will be like the Most High.

00:11:21.139 --> 00:11:25.819
He wants, even still today, he wants worship.

00:11:25.819 --> 00:11:27.499
But he doesn't deserve worship.

00:11:27.499 --> 00:11:29.299
He's not worthy of worship.

00:11:29.299 --> 00:11:31.219
And we ought not worship him.

00:11:31.219 --> 00:11:37.499
And we find that he, Satan, Lucifer, the created being, the devil, as we refer to him today,

00:11:37.499 --> 00:11:41.259
that he says to Jesus while he's tempting him in the wilderness, that I'll give you

00:11:41.259 --> 00:11:47.299
all these things if you fall down and worship me.

00:11:47.299 --> 00:11:49.819
Notice what the Bible says in verse number 10.

00:11:49.819 --> 00:11:56.739
Then Jesus saith unto him, get thee hence, Satan, for it is written, what is written?

00:11:56.739 --> 00:12:05.379
Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.

00:12:05.379 --> 00:12:07.859
It's very plain, is it not?

00:12:07.859 --> 00:12:10.739
Jesus understood this truth.

00:12:10.739 --> 00:12:16.539
It's very clearly indicated to us in verse number 10 of Matthew chapter 4 that Jesus

00:12:16.539 --> 00:12:22.539
clearly understood that God alone is the one to be worshiped.

00:12:22.539 --> 00:12:27.699
Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.

00:12:27.699 --> 00:12:32.699
We find that throughout the earthly ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ, but starting here

00:12:32.699 --> 00:12:40.739
in Matthew chapter number 2, we find that many occasions Jesus receives worship.

00:12:40.739 --> 00:12:42.299
Why?

00:12:42.299 --> 00:12:44.019
Because he's God.

00:12:44.019 --> 00:12:45.179
Because he's God.

00:12:45.179 --> 00:12:49.819
If he knew and he stated plainly in Matthew chapter number 4, listen, the only one you're

00:12:49.819 --> 00:12:55.499
to worship is God, but then he allows people to worship him, that would be a problem if

00:12:55.499 --> 00:12:56.499
he's not God.

00:12:56.499 --> 00:13:00.899
Do you remember if you read the book of Revelation, there are times in which you see that John

00:13:00.899 --> 00:13:02.899
is ready to fall down and worship an angel.

00:13:02.899 --> 00:13:03.899
You know what an angel says?

00:13:03.899 --> 00:13:04.899
No, no, no.

00:13:04.899 --> 00:13:05.899
Get up.

00:13:05.899 --> 00:13:06.899
No.

00:13:06.899 --> 00:13:07.899
Worship God.

00:13:07.899 --> 00:13:09.839
God's the only one to be worshiped.

00:13:09.839 --> 00:13:13.939
We find this morning that as we look at this passage of Scripture and begin to understand

00:13:13.939 --> 00:13:21.579
what's unfolding before us, that these wise men, they have a desire to worship, to worship

00:13:21.579 --> 00:13:24.819
God, to worship the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:13:24.819 --> 00:13:28.259
We have come to worship.

00:13:28.259 --> 00:13:32.339
I wonder this morning that as we go through our lives and we think about the truth of

00:13:32.339 --> 00:13:38.139
worship and the desire of these wise men this morning, I wonder how often do we truly have

00:13:38.139 --> 00:13:40.579
the desire to worship the Lord.

00:13:40.739 --> 00:13:45.939
Again, as we come to church, when we gather, we're not gathering as some social event,

00:13:45.939 --> 00:13:47.499
as some club or whatever.

00:13:47.499 --> 00:13:53.819
No, we're coming with the express stated purpose that we're coming to worship the Lord.

00:13:53.819 --> 00:13:57.539
He is worthy of our worship and we come with hearts that are prepared.

00:13:57.539 --> 00:14:01.579
We come with spirits that are ready, that I'm ready to worship the Lord, that when I

00:14:01.579 --> 00:14:06.059
lift my voice and sing, listen, singing is part of worship.

00:14:06.059 --> 00:14:07.059
Amen?

00:14:07.059 --> 00:14:09.019
I love to sing.

00:14:09.019 --> 00:14:11.339
I've shared this before from the pulpit.

00:14:11.339 --> 00:14:12.339
It bothers me.

00:14:12.339 --> 00:14:16.659
I've seen it many times over my life of being in church.

00:14:16.659 --> 00:14:21.419
It bothers me when there's a guest speaker in the church, an evangelist or a missionary,

00:14:21.419 --> 00:14:26.099
and during the time in which we're singing, they're going over their sermon notes or they're

00:14:26.099 --> 00:14:30.819
talking to somebody else and it's like, no, we're worshiping the Lord.

00:14:30.819 --> 00:14:34.099
You had all week to prepare your sermon, amen?

00:14:34.099 --> 00:14:36.179
Like we're worshiping.

00:14:36.179 --> 00:14:39.979
Singing is part of worship.

00:14:39.979 --> 00:14:42.499
Giving is part of worship.

00:14:42.499 --> 00:14:46.459
What a joy it is to be able to worship the Lord with our first fruits that we can, why

00:14:46.459 --> 00:14:48.459
do we have to pass an offering plate?

00:14:48.459 --> 00:14:55.019
We get to, we get to worship God through our giving and what a blessing and what a privilege

00:14:55.019 --> 00:15:00.099
that we can worship, adore him in that fashion, in that manner.

00:15:00.099 --> 00:15:04.979
So therefore, during the time of offering, during the time of singing, all, listen, it's

00:15:04.979 --> 00:15:11.659
all geared up to worshiping the Lord and getting me in that place where I'm understanding

00:15:11.659 --> 00:15:16.299
I'm not here, I'm not singing for them or for whoever, I'm not giving so someone else

00:15:16.299 --> 00:15:17.299
can see.

00:15:17.299 --> 00:15:24.939
No, I'm worshiping the Lord and that's my heart's desire and these wise men, they desired

00:15:24.939 --> 00:15:25.939
to worship.

00:15:25.939 --> 00:15:31.739
I just wonder this morning as we consider the truth, the first thought with regard to

00:15:31.739 --> 00:15:38.819
these wise men, how is our desire, is our desire to worship the Lord?

00:15:38.819 --> 00:15:41.859
Number two, we see their determination.

00:15:41.859 --> 00:15:45.139
These thoughts all go hand in hand and together.

00:15:45.139 --> 00:15:49.339
We see that their desire is to worship, but then we see their determination and really

00:15:49.339 --> 00:15:53.739
their desire is revealed in verse two, but we must go back to verse number one to really

00:15:53.739 --> 00:15:57.019
grasp the depth of their determination.

00:15:57.019 --> 00:16:01.699
The Bible says, now, when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, in the days of Herod

00:16:01.699 --> 00:16:06.979
the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem.

00:16:06.979 --> 00:16:10.719
They mentioned in verse number two that we have seen his star in the east.

00:16:10.719 --> 00:16:15.339
We do not know exactly how long it was that these wise men traveled.

00:16:15.339 --> 00:16:20.339
We do not know exactly from the place in which they began their journey, but we understand

00:16:20.339 --> 00:16:22.899
that they traveled a long distance.

00:16:22.899 --> 00:16:27.019
In fact, that we find, we stop reading in verse number six, but if you find in verse

00:16:27.019 --> 00:16:31.859
seven that Herod calls those wise men, it says, when he had privily called the wise

00:16:31.859 --> 00:16:38.659
men, he inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared and he sent them to Bethlehem

00:16:38.659 --> 00:16:44.179
and said, go and search diligently for the young child and when you have found him, bring

00:16:44.179 --> 00:16:47.579
me word again that I may come and worship him also.

00:16:47.579 --> 00:16:49.599
Of course, Herod is lying in verse number eight.

00:16:49.599 --> 00:16:54.319
We understand that as you read the entirety of the passage in Matthew chapter two, but

00:16:54.319 --> 00:16:59.519
if you read the latter part and understand what Herod did after he understood that he

00:16:59.519 --> 00:17:02.519
was mocked and all that took place.

00:17:02.519 --> 00:17:08.119
In verse number 16 of Matthew two, the Bible says that Herod, when he saw that he was mocked

00:17:08.119 --> 00:17:13.519
of the wise men was exceeding wrath and sent forth and slew all the children that were

00:17:13.519 --> 00:17:18.719
born in Bethlehem and all the coast thereof from two years old and under, according to

00:17:18.719 --> 00:17:23.599
the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men.

00:17:23.599 --> 00:17:24.599
So we don't know exactly.

00:17:24.599 --> 00:17:30.359
I believe that there's some clue here with regard to how long of a travel of a journey

00:17:30.359 --> 00:17:36.599
it took these, these wise men to travel because they asked the question, Herod asked the question,

00:17:36.599 --> 00:17:38.159
when did the star appear?

00:17:38.159 --> 00:17:42.479
He diligently inquired of them according to verse number seven and then told them to go

00:17:42.479 --> 00:17:46.959
and search when he found out that he was mocked and again, there's a period of time between

00:17:46.959 --> 00:17:52.199
them not returning from Bethlehem back to Jerusalem to report of that, but he decides

00:17:52.199 --> 00:17:57.319
we're going to make sure we get him quote unquote, and we're going to kill every male

00:17:57.319 --> 00:18:00.799
child two and under.

00:18:00.799 --> 00:18:03.759
Now some people, and I'm going to share with you my thought here this morning.

00:18:03.759 --> 00:18:08.119
Some people take that to think that that means that the wise men didn't get there when Jesus

00:18:08.119 --> 00:18:11.239
was just born, that he was a toddler.

00:18:11.239 --> 00:18:15.459
The problem with that is that they're in Bethlehem still.

00:18:15.459 --> 00:18:17.419
And at eight days, guess what they did?

00:18:17.419 --> 00:18:21.379
They went to Jerusalem so that Jesus could be circumcised.

00:18:21.379 --> 00:18:22.979
And guess where they were not from?

00:18:22.979 --> 00:18:24.579
They were not from Bethlehem.

00:18:24.579 --> 00:18:25.579
Why were they in Bethlehem?

00:18:25.579 --> 00:18:28.019
Well, because of the taxing.

00:18:28.019 --> 00:18:29.019
That's why they were there.

00:18:29.019 --> 00:18:30.899
And so you read through the accounts.

00:18:30.899 --> 00:18:35.579
If you read all of the gospel accounts together and begin to piece things together, we do

00:18:35.579 --> 00:18:40.979
not know the exact timeline with regard to all of the details, but we find here that

00:18:40.979 --> 00:18:47.699
there had to be a lengthy journey of these wise men as they saw the star appear.

00:18:47.699 --> 00:18:53.059
And of course, as they travel, the traveling at that particular time, as they traveled

00:18:53.059 --> 00:18:58.899
from the east to Jerusalem, it would be met with many obstacles and hardships, many difficulties,

00:18:58.899 --> 00:19:02.459
but yet they were determined to continue to press on.

00:19:02.459 --> 00:19:05.179
They were determined to reach their destination.

00:19:05.179 --> 00:19:06.179
Why?

00:19:06.179 --> 00:19:07.979
Because of their desire.

00:19:07.979 --> 00:19:17.179
You know, your desire will impact your determination in so many arenas of life.

00:19:17.179 --> 00:19:24.059
You have a desire to succeed in some arena of life, whether it's athletics or academics

00:19:24.059 --> 00:19:32.139
or whatever it is, a career, a job, a promotion, you have that desire and you're desiring it,

00:19:32.139 --> 00:19:35.099
it's going to impact your determination.

00:19:35.219 --> 00:19:41.579
And I believe this morning that the determination of these wise men is given to us, we're understanding

00:19:41.579 --> 00:19:42.579
their determination.

00:19:42.579 --> 00:19:44.579
Why were they so determined?

00:19:44.579 --> 00:19:46.940
Why did they not just turn back?

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:48.859
Why did they continue to go on?

00:19:48.859 --> 00:19:53.219
Because their desire was to worship the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:19:53.219 --> 00:19:59.859
And that desire was so deep in their heart that they were determined no matter how

00:19:59.859 --> 00:20:02.719
complicated, difficult the journey might be,

00:20:02.719 --> 00:20:05.719
no matter how many hardships would come along the way,

00:20:05.719 --> 00:20:07.319
the obstacles mattered not.

00:20:07.319 --> 00:20:08.159
Why?

00:20:08.159 --> 00:20:11.159
Because they wanted to get to Jerusalem to worship.

00:20:11.159 --> 00:20:14.359
What a joy to think about that this morning,

00:20:14.359 --> 00:20:15.679
their determination.

00:20:16.759 --> 00:20:18.739
I asked this morning, how's our desire?

00:20:18.739 --> 00:20:20.559
But then we must also ask ourselves,

00:20:20.559 --> 00:20:24.599
how determined are we to get to worship the Lord?

00:20:24.599 --> 00:20:27.519
I was speaking with someone just a few weeks ago

00:20:27.519 --> 00:20:29.339
and having a conversation,

00:20:29.339 --> 00:20:31.299
actually it was with someone not even from our church,

00:20:31.299 --> 00:20:33.099
they go to another church here in Virginia,

00:20:33.099 --> 00:20:35.299
and a good church, solid church,

00:20:35.299 --> 00:20:36.439
and I was chatting with them

00:20:36.439 --> 00:20:38.139
and we were talking about various things

00:20:38.139 --> 00:20:39.539
with regard to church,

00:20:39.539 --> 00:20:43.739
and something came up about families with young children.

00:20:43.739 --> 00:20:46.399
And if you're in that situation this morning,

00:20:46.399 --> 00:20:49.359
or if you've been in that situation in the past,

00:20:49.359 --> 00:20:51.939
you understand how complicated sometimes it is

00:20:51.939 --> 00:20:53.659
to be able to get to church.

00:20:54.619 --> 00:20:56.299
And I mentioned this to the individual

00:20:56.299 --> 00:20:57.699
by way of conversation, I said,

00:20:57.699 --> 00:20:59.139
you know, when our children were little,

00:20:59.899 --> 00:21:00.739
it always kind of seemed like

00:21:00.739 --> 00:21:02.579
that Saturday nights were the hardest.

00:21:03.939 --> 00:21:06.179
I mean, they'd sleep real good on Monday night

00:21:06.179 --> 00:21:08.299
and Tuesday night and Thursday night, whatever,

00:21:08.299 --> 00:21:10.479
but man, Saturday night just seemed like

00:21:10.479 --> 00:21:13.179
there's always some kind of something going on,

00:21:13.179 --> 00:21:14.079
there's an obstacle,

00:21:14.079 --> 00:21:16.179
there's something that comes up in the way,

00:21:16.179 --> 00:21:18.059
and it just seemed that way.

00:21:18.059 --> 00:21:20.899
And I never charted it, I never kept a calendar

00:21:20.899 --> 00:21:23.859
to be able to prove how many of those nights or whatever,

00:21:23.859 --> 00:21:27.179
but the reality is that the enemy wants to keep us

00:21:27.219 --> 00:21:29.219
from coming and worshiping the Lord.

00:21:32.259 --> 00:21:33.219
There are people today that say,

00:21:33.219 --> 00:21:35.979
well, you can just worship God by yourself.

00:21:35.979 --> 00:21:37.179
The reality is that you can,

00:21:37.179 --> 00:21:40.019
but there's something special about corporate worship.

00:21:40.019 --> 00:21:41.619
There's something not only special,

00:21:41.619 --> 00:21:45.179
but there's something ordained by God

00:21:45.179 --> 00:21:47.299
about corporate worship.

00:21:47.299 --> 00:21:49.559
Well, I can pray by myself at home.

00:21:49.559 --> 00:21:54.399
You can, and you should, amen?

00:21:54.399 --> 00:21:56.219
But there's something about corporate worship.

00:21:56.219 --> 00:21:58.299
Many of you have said to me personally,

00:21:58.299 --> 00:21:59.979
you know, I'm thankful for live stream,

00:21:59.979 --> 00:22:02.099
but it's just not the same.

00:22:02.099 --> 00:22:03.079
Why?

00:22:03.079 --> 00:22:05.499
Because you're just sitting at home.

00:22:05.499 --> 00:22:06.619
Are you hearing the message?

00:22:06.619 --> 00:22:08.979
Sure you are, but it's not the same.

00:22:08.979 --> 00:22:10.819
I've watched live stream.

00:22:10.819 --> 00:22:12.979
When I was real sick back in March and couldn't be here

00:22:12.979 --> 00:22:15.219
the first time, the first Sunday in 13 years

00:22:15.219 --> 00:22:18.339
that I wasn't able to preach because I was sick.

00:22:18.339 --> 00:22:20.059
And I sat over there on live stream

00:22:20.059 --> 00:22:22.259
and I hated every single second of it.

00:22:23.219 --> 00:22:25.979
And it wasn't because of the preacher.

00:22:26.579 --> 00:22:28.179
It wasn't because of the preacher.

00:22:28.179 --> 00:22:30.259
It's because I couldn't be with the people of God

00:22:30.259 --> 00:22:33.179
and worshiping God corporately.

00:22:33.179 --> 00:22:35.699
There's something about corporate worship.

00:22:35.699 --> 00:22:37.059
And we ought to be determined.

00:22:37.059 --> 00:22:37.879
Why?

00:22:37.879 --> 00:22:39.619
Because our desire is that we want to get there

00:22:39.619 --> 00:22:40.939
to worship the Lord.

00:22:40.939 --> 00:22:44.219
And I have that determination.

00:22:44.219 --> 00:22:45.799
Oh, but this happened and that happened.

00:22:45.799 --> 00:22:46.899
I understand the enemy.

00:22:46.899 --> 00:22:48.219
Listen, the enemy is subtle.

00:22:48.219 --> 00:22:51.339
The enemy is relentless, but we got to be determined.

00:22:51.339 --> 00:22:55.459
You think these wise men just had an easy passage?

00:22:55.459 --> 00:22:57.339
No, there were obstacles.

00:22:57.339 --> 00:23:00.419
Travel in those days was extremely difficult,

00:23:01.379 --> 00:23:04.259
especially over such distance.

00:23:04.259 --> 00:23:05.419
Not only the distance,

00:23:05.419 --> 00:23:08.539
but I have seen personally the terrain.

00:23:08.539 --> 00:23:09.579
I've been there.

00:23:09.579 --> 00:23:14.139
I've seen the distance between Jerusalem and Bethlehem.

00:23:14.139 --> 00:23:17.499
I've seen between Jerusalem and the Dead Sea to the east.

00:23:17.499 --> 00:23:18.379
I've seen it.

00:23:18.379 --> 00:23:22.019
I've been on a bus and I've driven from that area.

00:23:22.019 --> 00:23:23.899
And we got out, we made some stops

00:23:23.899 --> 00:23:25.659
and we saw the hills,

00:23:25.659 --> 00:23:27.899
but then also the valleys and the mountains

00:23:27.899 --> 00:23:28.779
and all of these things.

00:23:28.779 --> 00:23:31.019
And listen, it's not easy travel,

00:23:32.659 --> 00:23:34.419
but they were determined.

00:23:34.419 --> 00:23:35.819
They were determined.

00:23:35.819 --> 00:23:37.499
I wonder this morning, how determined are we?

00:23:37.499 --> 00:23:38.339
I mean, you say, well, we're here.

00:23:38.339 --> 00:23:40.379
I know, praise the Lord, amen.

00:23:40.379 --> 00:23:41.579
We're determined to worship,

00:23:41.579 --> 00:23:45.739
but listen, don't let the enemy mess with your desire

00:23:45.739 --> 00:23:47.739
that then messes with your determination.

00:23:48.619 --> 00:23:51.119
Just determine, I'm going to worship the Lord.

00:23:51.119 --> 00:23:52.739
I got that desire.

00:23:52.739 --> 00:23:54.339
I just want to come and worship.

00:23:54.339 --> 00:23:56.379
I was reading through the last couple of days

00:23:56.379 --> 00:23:57.979
I've been reading in my personal Bible study

00:23:57.979 --> 00:24:01.019
or personal Bible reading through the book of Nehemiah.

00:24:01.019 --> 00:24:02.939
Read the Bible through a couple of times this year,

00:24:02.939 --> 00:24:04.859
then read the New Testament and finished up

00:24:04.859 --> 00:24:08.199
the New Testament a few days ago for the third time.

00:24:08.199 --> 00:24:10.019
And then decided that I'd go ahead

00:24:10.019 --> 00:24:12.579
and just read a couple of Old Testament books.

00:24:12.579 --> 00:24:14.979
And Nehemiah was the one that I started reading

00:24:14.979 --> 00:24:15.939
through a few days ago.

00:24:15.939 --> 00:24:18.299
And I read this morning in Nehemiah chapter 10.

00:24:18.299 --> 00:24:19.139
And it's kind of interesting

00:24:19.139 --> 00:24:21.579
if you understand some things about Nehemiah,

00:24:21.579 --> 00:24:25.259
you find that it's a post-exilic book.

00:24:25.259 --> 00:24:27.539
In other words, after the captivity,

00:24:27.539 --> 00:24:29.599
and there's a remnant that can return,

00:24:29.599 --> 00:24:31.000
of course, they're rebuilding the walls

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.179
and so on and so forth.

00:24:32.179 --> 00:24:35.919
But you find that in chapter nine, especially,

00:24:35.919 --> 00:24:38.099
you begin to read about various things

00:24:38.099 --> 00:24:40.679
with regard to understanding how gracious

00:24:40.679 --> 00:24:43.579
and merciful God is, and certainly He is,

00:24:43.579 --> 00:24:45.699
and how much they had failed the Lord,

00:24:45.699 --> 00:24:49.239
and certainly they did, and they were judged because of it.

00:24:49.239 --> 00:24:51.919
You come to chapter 10 and you start reading,

00:24:51.919 --> 00:24:53.119
and it's very interesting,

00:24:53.119 --> 00:24:56.419
because a people that experience such hardship,

00:24:56.419 --> 00:24:58.959
the Bible says of those people in Nehemiah 10,

00:24:58.959 --> 00:25:02.399
I was reminded of Hebrews 10 when I read it this morning,

00:25:02.399 --> 00:25:06.419
but in Nehemiah chapter 10, in verse number 39,

00:25:06.419 --> 00:25:07.519
the Bible says this,

00:25:07.519 --> 00:25:09.679
as they're making this covenant with the Lord,

00:25:09.679 --> 00:25:10.759
it says at the end,

00:25:10.759 --> 00:25:14.379
and we will not forsake the house of our God.

00:25:15.399 --> 00:25:17.119
We will not forsake the house of our God.

00:25:17.119 --> 00:25:17.959
You know, there was a time

00:25:17.959 --> 00:25:19.279
when they were in Babylonian captivity

00:25:19.279 --> 00:25:21.159
where they couldn't come and worship.

00:25:22.079 --> 00:25:24.639
It was taken away from them, that privilege.

00:25:25.879 --> 00:25:29.759
And when it was removed from them and they were not able to,

00:25:29.759 --> 00:25:31.379
and then after the exile,

00:25:31.379 --> 00:25:33.079
after all that takes place and they go back,

00:25:33.079 --> 00:25:38.079
they say, we will not forsake the house of our God.

00:25:38.519 --> 00:25:40.039
Remember Hebrews 10 in verse 25,

00:25:40.039 --> 00:25:42.159
not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together

00:25:42.159 --> 00:25:43.159
as the manner of some is,

00:25:43.159 --> 00:25:44.679
but exhorting one another and so much the more

00:25:44.679 --> 00:25:46.739
as you see the day approaching.

00:25:47.619 --> 00:25:50.459
And this morning, when we have the privilege

00:25:50.459 --> 00:25:52.639
of being able to gather together,

00:25:52.639 --> 00:25:56.699
we see in these wise men this morning,

00:25:56.699 --> 00:26:00.459
we see their desire, we see their determination.

00:26:00.459 --> 00:26:04.099
They were determined because of their desire.

00:26:04.099 --> 00:26:06.979
We have come to worship.

00:26:06.979 --> 00:26:09.779
Number three, as we continue back in Matthew chapter two,

00:26:09.779 --> 00:26:13.419
I want you to notice their delight, their delight.

00:26:13.419 --> 00:26:17.179
In verse eight, after having the conversation with Herod,

00:26:17.179 --> 00:26:18.979
they're sent on their way to Bethlehem.

00:26:18.979 --> 00:26:20.500
And the Bible tells us now,

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:22.779
understand they arrived in Jerusalem,

00:26:22.779 --> 00:26:25.359
but we know Jesus was born in Bethlehem.

00:26:25.359 --> 00:26:29.379
And there's a journey between the two places.

00:26:29.379 --> 00:26:32.379
It's about a five and a half, six mile journey, if you will.

00:26:32.379 --> 00:26:36.659
And we find that as they would then take out

00:26:36.659 --> 00:26:39.779
and set onto Bethlehem, according to verse number eight,

00:26:39.779 --> 00:26:41.059
notice the Bible says in verse nine,

00:26:41.059 --> 00:26:43.699
when they had heard the King, they departed.

00:26:43.699 --> 00:26:46.639
And notice what the Bible says, and lo the star.

00:26:46.639 --> 00:26:48.299
That was the star that brought them to Jerusalem

00:26:48.299 --> 00:26:50.579
in the first place, according to verse number two.

00:26:50.579 --> 00:26:52.619
And it says in verse number nine, behold the star,

00:26:52.619 --> 00:26:55.579
lo the star, which they saw in the east went before them

00:26:55.579 --> 00:26:59.799
till it came and stood over where the young child was.

00:26:59.799 --> 00:27:02.419
When they saw the star, notice the Bible says,

00:27:02.419 --> 00:27:07.419
they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.

00:27:08.339 --> 00:27:11.719
Verse number 10, we find that the star,

00:27:11.719 --> 00:27:15.699
and you find how God is working through this entire process

00:27:15.699 --> 00:27:17.739
because as they're following the star,

00:27:17.739 --> 00:27:18.899
according to verse number nine,

00:27:18.899 --> 00:27:21.219
and they departed from Jerusalem and they go,

00:27:21.219 --> 00:27:23.059
and the Bible tells us that the star came

00:27:23.059 --> 00:27:28.059
and it stood over where at the house where Jesus was.

00:27:28.899 --> 00:27:30.099
Where was Jesus born?

00:27:30.099 --> 00:27:33.500
Well, he was born in a manger, but now he's in a house.

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:36.259
And again, that makes sense logically, why?

00:27:36.259 --> 00:27:38.259
Why were there no rooms in the inn?

00:27:38.259 --> 00:27:39.899
Well, because of the taxation,

00:27:39.899 --> 00:27:41.219
but after people paid their taxes,

00:27:41.219 --> 00:27:43.500
they went back to their place of living.

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:45.219
They went back to their homes.

00:27:45.219 --> 00:27:48.079
And so now there's some occupancy available.

00:27:48.079 --> 00:27:50.379
She just had a child, they find a place,

00:27:50.379 --> 00:27:53.539
and the Bible tells us that they see the star

00:27:53.539 --> 00:27:55.099
and notice in verse 10,

00:27:55.099 --> 00:27:59.819
they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.

00:27:59.819 --> 00:28:01.879
I mean, isn't that an awesome statement?

00:28:01.879 --> 00:28:04.179
I mean, the rejoicing of these wise men

00:28:04.179 --> 00:28:06.259
when they see all that's unfolded

00:28:06.259 --> 00:28:08.459
and their desire was to worship

00:28:08.459 --> 00:28:11.739
and their determination led them on this lengthy journey

00:28:11.739 --> 00:28:13.099
and they get to the place.

00:28:13.099 --> 00:28:14.579
And even before they go in,

00:28:14.579 --> 00:28:18.179
see, because it wasn't completely satisfied at this point,

00:28:18.179 --> 00:28:21.059
they had not yet seen the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:28:21.059 --> 00:28:22.699
They'd not yet worshiped him,

00:28:22.699 --> 00:28:25.219
but they're already rejoicing.

00:28:25.219 --> 00:28:30.219
The Bible says that they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.

00:28:31.219 --> 00:28:36.019
This morning, when you woke up this morning,

00:28:36.019 --> 00:28:37.979
and often I'm praying here in the church

00:28:37.979 --> 00:28:40.339
and I prayed various time

00:28:40.339 --> 00:28:44.059
of whatever the particular morning is on Sunday morning.

00:28:44.059 --> 00:28:45.539
Sometimes it's a couple of hours,

00:28:45.539 --> 00:28:47.820
sometimes a few hours before the Sunday school hour

00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:48.979
will begin.

00:28:48.979 --> 00:28:50.219
And I'll pray this way, Lord,

00:28:50.219 --> 00:28:53.539
as our folks are getting up this morning,

00:28:53.539 --> 00:28:57.459
would you help them to have just a joy

00:28:57.459 --> 00:28:59.179
about the Lord's day?

00:28:59.179 --> 00:29:01.459
Would you help them to have an excitement,

00:29:01.459 --> 00:29:04.739
an anticipation about the privilege that we have

00:29:04.739 --> 00:29:09.200
to gather together on the Lord's day to worship?

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:11.700
Would you help us Lord to be in that right spirit,

00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:13.500
that right frame of mind?

00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:15.779
And I pray and in my mind,

00:29:15.779 --> 00:29:17.019
that's why when you move seats,

00:29:17.019 --> 00:29:18.659
it kind of messes with me a little bit

00:29:18.659 --> 00:29:19.859
because in my mind,

00:29:19.859 --> 00:29:21.779
I pray for each of you by name

00:29:21.779 --> 00:29:24.179
and I go through by where you sit.

00:29:24.179 --> 00:29:25.099
And that's how I pray.

00:29:25.099 --> 00:29:26.299
And then when you move on me,

00:29:26.299 --> 00:29:27.260
I'm like, hold on a minute,

00:29:27.859 --> 00:29:28.700
they're sitting over there

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:29.979
and they're supposed to be over there.

00:29:29.979 --> 00:29:32.779
And the reality is that I pray for you by name

00:29:32.779 --> 00:29:35.500
and I pray that God would help us to come

00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:40.500
with that joy that I get to worship God today

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:43.700
corporately with my brothers and sisters in Christ.

00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:46.859
And we have that as these wise men,

00:29:46.859 --> 00:29:48.739
they rejoice with exceeding great joy.

00:29:48.739 --> 00:29:49.579
Why?

00:29:49.579 --> 00:29:51.140
Because they're about to step over the threshold

00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:53.539
and they're gonna see God in flesh

00:29:53.539 --> 00:29:55.419
and they're gonna worship him.

00:29:55.419 --> 00:29:57.339
And this is their delight.

00:29:57.339 --> 00:29:59.979
We get to church, man, it's a delight.

00:29:59.979 --> 00:30:04.059
you say, you have no idea what it took me to get here this morning.

00:30:04.059 --> 00:30:07.319
Some of you, it took a lot more than others.

00:30:07.319 --> 00:30:09.439
I just had to walk across this morning.

00:30:09.439 --> 00:30:12.079
And actually, I walked down the driveway and then up the driveway

00:30:12.079 --> 00:30:14.079
because I don't like walking through the grass.

00:30:14.079 --> 00:30:18.039
But the reality is that sometimes it's a challenge,

00:30:18.039 --> 00:30:20.919
as we mentioned with the wise men.

00:30:20.919 --> 00:30:23.339
You say, man, it seemed like everything that could go wrong went wrong.

00:30:23.339 --> 00:30:27.419
Now, don't raise your hand and tell, but you know how that happens sometimes.

00:30:27.499 --> 00:30:29.919
Everything that could go wrong went wrong.

00:30:29.919 --> 00:30:31.799
And we just barely made it.

00:30:31.799 --> 00:30:33.419
But man, we made it.

00:30:33.419 --> 00:30:35.719
We get to worship the Lord.

00:30:35.719 --> 00:30:39.299
The Bible tells us that they rejoiced greatly.

00:30:39.299 --> 00:30:44.679
But then notice really the pinnacle, if you will, in verse number 11.

00:30:44.679 --> 00:30:50.059
The Bible says, and when they were come into the house,

00:30:50.059 --> 00:30:54.399
they saw the young child with Mary, his mother,

00:30:54.419 --> 00:30:59.019
and fell down and worshipped Him.

00:30:59.019 --> 00:31:03.399
I can't even begin to understand the emotions

00:31:03.399 --> 00:31:07.059
that these wise men must have had at this particular moment.

00:31:07.059 --> 00:31:11.779
The journey that they took, their determination to get there,

00:31:11.779 --> 00:31:15.119
their desire to worship the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:31:15.119 --> 00:31:17.539
where is He that is born King of the Jews?

00:31:17.539 --> 00:31:19.579
And they enter into the house,

00:31:19.599 --> 00:31:24.799
and the Bible says that they saw the young child with Mary, his mother,

00:31:24.799 --> 00:31:28.259
over in Luke chapter 2, in verse number 27.

00:31:28.259 --> 00:31:32.599
We find that here the Bible is giving us the truth

00:31:32.599 --> 00:31:36.599
with regard to the adoration of the Lord Jesus Christ

00:31:36.599 --> 00:31:38.199
when they were in Jerusalem.

00:31:38.199 --> 00:31:42.399
And so notice the Bible talks to us in verse number 21 of Luke 2

00:31:42.399 --> 00:31:45.659
about when eight days were accomplished for the circumcision of the child.

00:31:45.659 --> 00:31:47.439
His name was called Jesus,

00:31:47.459 --> 00:31:50.259
which was so named to the angel before he was conceived in the womb.

00:31:50.259 --> 00:31:53.499
And when the days of our purification, according to the law of Moses,

00:31:53.499 --> 00:31:56.099
were accomplished, they brought him where?

00:31:56.099 --> 00:31:58.659
To Jerusalem to present him to the Lord.

00:31:58.659 --> 00:32:01.459
Now that would have been, according to the book of Leviticus,

00:32:01.459 --> 00:32:05.579
verse number 22, would have been 40 days after the birth of Christ.

00:32:05.579 --> 00:32:07.019
That's fulfilling the law.

00:32:07.019 --> 00:32:07.859
That's what it would have been.

00:32:07.859 --> 00:32:11.419
You can go back to Leviticus 12 and look through that and see that,

00:32:11.419 --> 00:32:14.019
but that would have been the process.

00:32:14.019 --> 00:32:17.559
Again, the Bible plainly states that they were in Jerusalem,

00:32:17.559 --> 00:32:22.239
but skip down, as you find in verse number 24,

00:32:22.239 --> 00:32:24.359
the Bible says, "...and to offer a sacrifice according to that

00:32:24.359 --> 00:32:26.279
which is said in the law of the Lord,

00:32:26.279 --> 00:32:28.239
a pair of turtle doves or two young pigeons.

00:32:28.239 --> 00:32:32.559
And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon,

00:32:32.559 --> 00:32:34.759
and the same man was just and devout,

00:32:34.759 --> 00:32:38.439
waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Ghost was upon him."

00:32:38.439 --> 00:32:40.239
And notice the Bible says in verse 26,

00:32:40.239 --> 00:32:43.339
"...and it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost

00:32:43.339 --> 00:32:47.339
that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ."

00:32:47.339 --> 00:32:50.619
By the way, that's a great promise that he was given, this man Simeon.

00:32:50.619 --> 00:32:54.259
And in verse 27, it says, "...and he came by the Spirit into the temple,

00:32:54.259 --> 00:32:58.339
and when the parents brought in the child Jesus

00:32:58.339 --> 00:33:00.579
to do for him after the custom of the law,

00:33:00.579 --> 00:33:04.259
then took he him up in his arms and blessed God and said,

00:33:04.279 --> 00:33:07.959
Lord, now let us now thy servant depart in peace,

00:33:07.959 --> 00:33:13.039
according to thy word, for mine eyes have seen thy salvation."

00:33:13.039 --> 00:33:15.479
Now, I come here to Luke chapter number two,

00:33:15.479 --> 00:33:18.879
because it says, of course, if you follow the process,

00:33:18.879 --> 00:33:21.079
he was circumcised according to verse 21.

00:33:21.079 --> 00:33:25.799
Verse 22, they're there offering the days of repurification

00:33:25.799 --> 00:33:27.879
were accomplished according to the law of Moses.

00:33:27.879 --> 00:33:31.359
They bring in its 40 days after the birth of Christ.

00:33:31.379 --> 00:33:37.219
And in verse 27, the Bible says that they brought in the child Jesus.

00:33:37.219 --> 00:33:41.019
In Matthew chapter two, the Bible says when they saw the young child.

00:33:41.019 --> 00:33:43.899
I only bring that up because people get all kinds of confused

00:33:43.899 --> 00:33:46.739
where it's not the word baby or infant,

00:33:46.739 --> 00:33:50.459
but this word young child in the Greek can mean a variety,

00:33:50.459 --> 00:33:53.539
really anyone under about the age of five.

00:33:53.539 --> 00:33:55.219
And so it's absolutely appropriate.

00:33:55.239 --> 00:34:01.919
And we find that they come in and they see Jesus, God in flesh.

00:34:01.919 --> 00:34:07.719
He's just in a cradle at this point, just a few days old.

00:34:07.719 --> 00:34:11.039
We don't know exactly.

00:34:11.039 --> 00:34:15.999
We find that Mary was there.

00:34:15.999 --> 00:34:22.319
The Bible says that they fell down and worshipped him.

00:34:22.319 --> 00:34:24.759
They fell down and worshipped him.

00:34:24.779 --> 00:34:29.299
And we find that their delight is revealed to us in these verses of Scripture,

00:34:29.299 --> 00:34:32.219
for this was the very purpose of their journey.

00:34:32.219 --> 00:34:34.019
This was the whole intent.

00:34:34.019 --> 00:34:37.019
I mean, they get to the place where they've reached

00:34:37.019 --> 00:34:43.819
and been able to do exactly what they set out to do.

00:34:43.819 --> 00:34:45.739
They see Jesus.

00:34:45.739 --> 00:34:48.059
They fall down and worship him.

00:34:48.059 --> 00:34:51.339
Understand, they don't worship Mary.

00:34:51.339 --> 00:34:52.859
They don't worship anyone else.

00:34:52.859 --> 00:34:54.379
They worship Jesus.

00:34:54.399 --> 00:34:55.399
Why?

00:34:55.399 --> 00:34:57.479
Because he alone is worthy of our worship.

00:34:57.479 --> 00:34:59.359
He's God.

00:34:59.359 --> 00:35:03.079
And the Bible says that they fell down and worshipped him

00:35:03.079 --> 00:35:08.599
in the notice when they had opened their treasures.

00:35:08.599 --> 00:35:18.119
They presented unto him Jesus' gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh.

00:35:18.119 --> 00:35:20.879
The significance of the gifts is obvious.

00:35:20.899 --> 00:35:24.539
We won't take time this morning to focus on that as much.

00:35:24.539 --> 00:35:29.299
But we find here that they fell down and worshipped him, the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:35:29.299 --> 00:35:33.099
and they opened their treasures and they presented unto him gifts.

00:35:33.099 --> 00:35:37.979
These men, these wise men, they came prepared.

00:35:37.979 --> 00:35:40.459
They were prepared to worship.

00:35:40.459 --> 00:35:45.219
See, their purpose, their desire was that we're coming to worship.

00:35:45.219 --> 00:35:47.659
Where is he that is born, king of the Jews?

00:35:47.659 --> 00:35:52.319
We've seen his star in the east and we are come to worship him.

00:35:52.319 --> 00:35:54.039
That is their desire.

00:35:54.039 --> 00:35:55.079
They're determined.

00:35:55.079 --> 00:35:59.359
So they go and they take the journey and they face every obstacle and hardship

00:35:59.359 --> 00:36:01.959
and they overcome whatever needs to be overcame

00:36:01.959 --> 00:36:05.999
so that they can come to the place where Jesus is and they get there,

00:36:05.999 --> 00:36:08.879
but they're prepared to worship.

00:36:08.879 --> 00:36:13.199
You know, the preparation for worship is so important

00:36:13.199 --> 00:36:17.819
that our hearts are right with God.

00:36:17.819 --> 00:36:23.819
That we come to that place where we're prepared to worship the Lord.

00:36:23.819 --> 00:36:27.659
We worship him in his holiness and his beauty.

00:36:27.659 --> 00:36:29.059
We worship him for who he is.

00:36:29.059 --> 00:36:33.739
We truly stand in awe of who God is.

00:36:33.739 --> 00:36:39.539
The purpose of the service structure and the singing is to prepare our hearts

00:36:39.539 --> 00:36:42.939
as we're worshipping the Lord and we're worshipping him through song

00:36:42.959 --> 00:36:44.919
and you find so many times throughout the scripture,

00:36:44.919 --> 00:36:49.519
the place of music and how we're to use music to worship the Lord

00:36:49.519 --> 00:36:54.279
and it prepares our hearts to receive the truth from God's word.

00:36:54.279 --> 00:36:59.679
The goal of preaching is not only to give the truth of God's word

00:36:59.679 --> 00:37:03.759
and to open it up and just, you don't wanna come and just wax eloquent.

00:37:03.759 --> 00:37:06.319
No, you wanna come so that we can worship the Lord.

00:37:06.319 --> 00:37:10.759
So we speak about how great our God is and how worthy our God is

00:37:10.779 --> 00:37:14.619
and yes, throughout the preaching there are times in which we're convicted

00:37:14.619 --> 00:37:18.179
about various things in our lives that must be adjusted and changed

00:37:18.179 --> 00:37:20.299
and repented of and so on and so forth,

00:37:20.299 --> 00:37:24.819
but all of that is in focus of worshipping our God

00:37:24.819 --> 00:37:30.019
because he's worthy, he's worthy and it's a delight.

00:37:30.019 --> 00:37:34.459
You know, it's a privilege that God gives us the opportunity to worship him.

00:37:34.459 --> 00:37:36.259
We're gonna worship him if you're saved this morning,

00:37:36.259 --> 00:37:38.859
you'll worship him for all of eternity.

00:37:38.859 --> 00:37:42.439
You read the book of Revelation, you read through various passages of scripture

00:37:42.439 --> 00:37:45.839
in the book of Revelation, you find we're gonna worship him for all of eternity,

00:37:45.839 --> 00:37:50.199
but we get to worship him today, we get to worship him.

00:37:50.199 --> 00:37:53.239
And the Bible says that these men obviously they were prepared

00:37:53.239 --> 00:37:58.359
for they opened up their treasures and so they then present to him gifts,

00:37:58.359 --> 00:38:01.999
gold and frankincense and myrrh

00:38:01.999 --> 00:38:04.759
and they came prepared with those gifts

00:38:04.759 --> 00:38:11.459
and they presented those gifts to the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:38:11.459 --> 00:38:16.699
I don't know, you don't know how long they would have stayed here,

00:38:16.699 --> 00:38:20.939
but we find that the Bible says in verse number 12,

00:38:20.939 --> 00:38:24.939
and being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod,

00:38:24.939 --> 00:38:28.899
they departed into their own country another way.

00:38:28.899 --> 00:38:31.339
What do you think about verse number 12?

00:38:31.339 --> 00:38:37.880
The Bible says that they were warned of God in a dream.

00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:41.320
And God obviously now we have the whole canon of scripture,

00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:46.279
so there's no new revelation by visions and dreams and so on and so forth,

00:38:46.279 --> 00:38:48.880
but we find that until the canon of scripture was completed

00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:54.479
that God often would reveal things to people through dreams and visions.

00:38:54.479 --> 00:38:58.179
And we find here that these wise men they were being warned of God in a dream.

00:38:58.179 --> 00:39:03.519
And by the way, if Jesus was not God and He was not worthy of worship,

00:39:03.519 --> 00:39:06.119
God would not have warned them to depart some other way.

00:39:06.119 --> 00:39:11.519
God would have rebuked them for worshipping that which they were not to worship.

00:39:11.519 --> 00:39:12.919
Amen?

00:39:12.919 --> 00:39:15.719
But God warned them. See, they did what they were supposed to do.

00:39:15.719 --> 00:39:19.919
They worshipped the Lord and God warned them that they should not return to Herod.

00:39:19.919 --> 00:39:21.219
So why did God warn them?

00:39:21.219 --> 00:39:24.919
Well, because Herod was lying to them and Herod said,

00:39:24.919 --> 00:39:28.659
when you find him, come and let me know so that I can come and worship him also.

00:39:28.659 --> 00:39:35.459
You know, the enemy is cunning, deceitful, subtle.

00:39:35.459 --> 00:39:40.859
The Bible describes in Genesis 3, more subtle than any beast of the field.

00:39:40.859 --> 00:39:45.059
And here, listen, we need God's discernment, amen,

00:39:45.059 --> 00:39:49.359
because the enemy says, hey, let me know so I can come and worship him also.

00:39:49.359 --> 00:39:51.359
And God warns, no, that's not Herod's intent.

00:39:51.359 --> 00:39:53.959
Herod is a wicked man. He's not going to worship Jesus.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.500
And we find that they're warned, and so what do they do?

00:39:56.500 --> 00:40:00.000
They obey, they depart into their own country another way.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:06.340
This morning, just in closing, as we begin to think about this passage of Scripture from

00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:11.159
this perspective this morning, and seeing these wise men and their desire, their determination

00:40:11.159 --> 00:40:17.079
and their delight, I want you to understand that they left their home in verse number

00:40:17.079 --> 00:40:18.079
1.

00:40:18.079 --> 00:40:23.620
As we began this study this morning in Matthew chapter 2, the Bible says that there came

00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:26.600
wise men from the east to Jerusalem.

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:32.080
So they left their place that they knew, they left their home, and they travel, they're

00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:38.200
determined to get to where Jesus is because they desire to worship Him, and then at the

00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:43.560
end of the passage, after they worship the Lord, after they present the gifts, the Bible

00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:46.439
says that they then return where?

00:40:46.439 --> 00:40:49.439
To their own country another way.

00:40:49.439 --> 00:40:53.000
I want you to think about it in this manner this morning.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.599
We gather together for worship.

00:40:55.599 --> 00:40:58.040
We all came from a different place this morning.

00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:00.720
We all have a different story and a different journey.

00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:03.400
Some got saved when you were little, young.

00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:05.440
Some got saved when you were older.

00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:08.440
Maybe if there's someone here this morning not saved, I would say to you that today is

00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:10.559
the day of your salvation.

00:41:10.559 --> 00:41:13.279
Trust the Lord Jesus Christ today.

00:41:13.279 --> 00:41:17.480
But I want you to understand something, that we all came from our homes this morning.

00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:19.080
So I didn't come from home, I stayed somewhere else.

00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:22.199
You know what I mean, amen?

00:41:22.199 --> 00:41:24.160
You came from your location.

00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:27.680
You came here and we worship the Lord together.

00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:29.480
But then guess what?

00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:31.639
We go back.

00:41:31.639 --> 00:41:33.480
We go back.

00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:35.959
And what do we do when we go back?

00:41:35.959 --> 00:41:39.879
You know, I think these wise men, I think that there's not, we don't know anything,

00:41:39.879 --> 00:41:44.800
no other references, but I think their life was forever changed.

00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:48.559
And if you don't agree with that, don't talk to me about it, amen?

00:41:48.559 --> 00:41:52.239
Because I truly think their life was forever changed.

00:41:52.239 --> 00:41:53.720
Why?

00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:56.279
Because they got to worship God.

00:41:56.279 --> 00:42:03.000
They got to worship God and their life was changed.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:06.879
I think they went back to their own country different.

00:42:06.879 --> 00:42:09.440
I think when they got back to their own country, you know what I think they did?

00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:12.479
I think they talked about their experience.

00:42:12.479 --> 00:42:14.000
Why?

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.399
Because they had so much joy because of what they...

00:42:18.399 --> 00:42:23.639
They worshiped Jesus and they were so full of joy.

00:42:23.679 --> 00:42:28.279
You know, when you're full of joy, it's got to come out of you, amen?

00:42:28.279 --> 00:42:31.320
You ever feel like you're about to explode, you got so much joy?

00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:34.039
Maybe you're at work and the people that you work with, you just know they're not going

00:42:34.039 --> 00:42:35.039
to understand it.

00:42:35.039 --> 00:42:38.279
They're going to think you're crazy, you're off your rocker, you need to be institutionalized

00:42:38.279 --> 00:42:39.279
or whatever it might be.

00:42:39.279 --> 00:42:41.759
And you say, man, it's just so filled up in me.

00:42:41.759 --> 00:42:42.919
It's so welled up in me.

00:42:42.919 --> 00:42:44.880
I just got to talk to somebody.

00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:48.559
I got to let somebody know that's going to rejoice with me.

00:42:48.559 --> 00:42:51.679
I know some of you feel that way because sometimes some of you have called me and said, I just

00:42:51.679 --> 00:42:57.240
got to talk to somebody and he'll share with me something that happened at work.

00:42:57.240 --> 00:43:02.360
Some opportunity to share the gospel and you're just rejoicing and an answer to prayer and

00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:05.660
opportunity, whatever it might be.

00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:08.679
You know, the maniac of Gadara, you know what he wanted to do?

00:43:08.679 --> 00:43:09.679
He wanted to go home.

00:43:09.679 --> 00:43:11.759
He wanted to go with Jesus.

00:43:11.759 --> 00:43:12.759
You read the account.

00:43:12.759 --> 00:43:13.759
He wanted to go with Jesus.

00:43:13.759 --> 00:43:15.839
But what did Jesus say?

00:43:15.839 --> 00:43:23.800
Go home to thy friends and show them how great things the Lord hath done for thee.

00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:30.880
And so when we go back after we worship the Lord, I hope we leave different than we came.

00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:32.600
Amen?

00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:42.800
We leave different than we came and we leave with this revitalized level of joy and excitement

00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:49.360
to go serve the King and King of Kings and Lord of Lords that we just had the opportunity

00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:51.399
to worship Him.

00:43:51.399 --> 00:43:58.399
And we go out and we then minister, we serve in various capacities, we witness, we do the

00:43:58.399 --> 00:44:01.240
work of God.

00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:05.919
And then we have the privilege of coming back as a corporate body of believers and worshiping

00:44:05.919 --> 00:44:06.919
the Lord again.

00:44:06.919 --> 00:44:10.919
You ever feel like, listen, I know some of you feel this way because you tell me, man,

00:44:10.919 --> 00:44:14.800
I was sick and I missed church for X number of times, man, I just couldn't wait to get

00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:17.200
back to church.

00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:20.480
And it's not just about being in a club.

00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:25.799
It's about worshiping God corporately and getting what God has for us.

00:44:25.799 --> 00:44:28.519
And we get to bow down and worship Him.

00:44:28.519 --> 00:44:30.100
We get to adore Him.

00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:38.200
We get to exalt the Lord Jesus Christ that He alone might receive all honor and glory

00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:40.160
for it's due unto His name.

00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:46.480
And after we worship the Lord for a little while, we're different than when we came in.

00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:49.880
And we ought to want to go out and just tell somebody about it.

00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:51.880
You say, but they're not going to understand.

00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:52.880
You're right.

00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:53.880
They might not.

00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:57.839
But you know, can I tell you this morning, there was a day that you didn't understand.

00:44:57.839 --> 00:45:01.959
There was a day that if someone had come to you and said, let me tell you about how we

00:45:01.959 --> 00:45:05.760
worship the Lord today, you'd be like, I don't know what you're talking about.

00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:08.399
Because you weren't saved.

00:45:08.399 --> 00:45:10.140
Amen?

00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:14.779
But now, we sing that song, He's a Wonderful Savior to Me.

00:45:14.779 --> 00:45:15.779
And I love that song.

00:45:15.779 --> 00:45:19.299
But you know what, there was a time that I couldn't sing that song.

00:45:19.299 --> 00:45:20.299
Why?

00:45:20.299 --> 00:45:22.440
Because He wasn't my Savior.

00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:26.779
And I didn't know how wonderful of a Savior He was because He wasn't my Savior.

00:45:26.779 --> 00:45:29.019
Does that make sense?

00:45:29.019 --> 00:45:34.100
And so this morning when we worship God, every opportunity that God gives us to come and

00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:41.380
corporately worship Him, that we come with the desire, singular desire.

00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:42.380
Why did you come to church today?

00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:45.299
You came to worship God.

00:45:45.299 --> 00:45:47.579
That's the only right answer.

00:45:47.579 --> 00:45:49.380
Came to worship God.

00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:51.700
Well, I had to get my Christmas card.

00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:52.700
No, no, no.

00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:54.260
You came to worship God.

00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:55.700
Amen?

00:45:55.700 --> 00:45:58.899
We have come to worship.

00:45:58.899 --> 00:46:00.380
That's our desire.

00:46:00.380 --> 00:46:01.980
We're determined.

00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:03.420
Why?

00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:06.779
Because our desire drives that determination.

00:46:06.779 --> 00:46:08.619
I'm not just coming to a club.

00:46:08.619 --> 00:46:10.019
I'm not just going to see a game.

00:46:10.019 --> 00:46:11.260
I'm not just going to do...

00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:12.260
No, no, no.

00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:15.500
I'm coming to worship the King of Kings and Lord of Lords.

00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:20.519
And because I know what's happening in that place at that time, man, it gives me determination

00:46:20.519 --> 00:46:21.519
to get there.

00:46:21.519 --> 00:46:25.540
Because I want to worship together with my brothers and sisters in Christ.

00:46:25.540 --> 00:46:27.100
And then there's great delight.

00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:32.459
Oh, it's wonderful to worship the Lord together.

00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:34.579
Let us praise His name together.

00:46:34.579 --> 00:46:37.820
Let us exalt the Lord together.

00:46:37.820 --> 00:46:41.140
But then just as these wise men, they didn't stay there.

00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:44.820
They didn't walk with Christ the rest of His life and just stay with Him.

00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:47.619
No, they returned back to their own country.

00:46:47.619 --> 00:46:54.739
And each of us have a place, a sphere of influence that we have to go back to after we worship.

00:46:54.739 --> 00:46:56.299
We kind of could look at it this way.

00:46:56.299 --> 00:47:00.260
We get up on the mountain peak of worshiping the Lord and then you got to kind of go off

00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:09.540
the mountain and live where we live, minister to whom we minister.

00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:12.299
And then we come back up to the mountain and worship again.

00:47:12.299 --> 00:47:15.940
And then we go back and we minister.

00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:21.779
Let us, as these wise men, we have come to worship Him.

00:47:21.779 --> 00:47:25.299
He alone is worthy of our worship.

00:47:25.299 --> 00:47:26.299
Let's pray together.

00:47:26.299 --> 00:47:27.739
Father, we love You.

00:47:27.739 --> 00:47:29.859
We thank You for loving us.

00:47:29.859 --> 00:47:30.859
Thank You for Your Word.

00:47:30.859 --> 00:47:35.540
God, I pray that You'd help us to worship You in spirit and in truth.

00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:37.820
Help us to bow down before Thee.

00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:46.220
Lord, help us to exalt You, to give You all the glory that's due unto Your wonderful name.

00:47:46.220 --> 00:47:52.619
Father, I pray that if there's one present here this morning that's not sure of heaven,

00:47:52.619 --> 00:47:57.820
one that's tuned in via live stream that's not sure of heaven, God, You know the hearts

00:47:57.820 --> 00:48:00.459
of those that are present.

00:48:00.459 --> 00:48:01.459
I do not.

00:48:01.459 --> 00:48:05.859
But God, if there's one that needs to be saved this morning, I pray that today would be the

00:48:05.859 --> 00:48:08.100
day of their salvation.

00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:12.140
They'd recognize that You alone are the Savior of the world.

00:48:12.140 --> 00:48:18.779
And God, they would recognize their need to accept Christ as their Savior.

00:48:18.779 --> 00:48:20.540
I pray for Your people this morning.

00:48:20.540 --> 00:48:25.140
I pray, God, that You'd help each of us that know You as our personal Lord and Savior to

00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:30.140
have that desire and determination to worship You.

00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:31.140
Thank You for the privilege.

00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:34.659
I pray, God, that You'd use us for Your glory.

00:48:34.659 --> 00:48:38.419
Would You move and work in the time of invitation as only You can for it's in Christ's name

00:48:38.419 --> 00:48:39.419
we pray.

00:48:39.419 --> 00:48:39.859
Would You stand with me?
