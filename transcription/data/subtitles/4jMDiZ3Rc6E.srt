1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,800
But this week, just afresh and anew, God just really just opened some things to me from

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:14,199
this portion of Scripture, and I'm so thankful for the truth of God's Word.

3
00:00:14,199 --> 00:00:19,200
I'm so thankful that God told us in His Word that His Word is truth.

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,079
And I'm thankful for the freedom that we have in Christ.

5
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:28,159
And I'm thankful that we have the Old Testament and the New Testament, we have the whole canon

6
00:00:28,159 --> 00:00:29,159
of Scripture.

7
00:00:29,159 --> 00:00:32,279
Where would we be without a Bible?

8
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,279
And everything that you know to be true about God, everything that we know to be true about

9
00:00:36,279 --> 00:00:44,759
salvation we find in the pages of this precious book, and oh, how thankful I am for the Bible.

10
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:50,080
In this third chapter of the book of 2 Corinthians, we find, really, that throughout the chapter,

11
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:55,599
there's this contrast that is being given to us, and it's a contrast between law and

12
00:00:55,599 --> 00:00:56,599
grace.

13
00:00:56,599 --> 00:00:59,000
A contrast between law and grace.

14
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:04,279
The passage of Scripture takes us back to Moses and to the book of Exodus, and we understand

15
00:01:04,279 --> 00:01:09,919
that the Lord gave Moses the law, and the children of Israel lived under that system.

16
00:01:09,919 --> 00:01:16,339
But we find that we today are blessed as Paul is communicating to these believers in Corinth,

17
00:01:16,339 --> 00:01:21,360
we too are blessed to live in this era, as Romans 6 and verse 14 tells us, that we're

18
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,400
no longer under the law, but we're under grace.

19
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:30,339
And I'm so thankful for that wonderful truth, I'm reminded, we'll look at a number of verses

20
00:01:30,339 --> 00:01:34,680
this morning, the law had a shadow of good things to come.

21
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,739
And we see that in Hebrews chapter number 10, as we look through the portion of Scripture,

22
00:01:38,739 --> 00:01:42,839
we note that the law had a specific purpose.

23
00:01:42,839 --> 00:01:49,519
Indeed, the law, as is spoken of here in 2 Corinthians chapter number 3, was glorious.

24
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:54,919
There was an aspect of glory with regard to the law and how God gave the law.

25
00:01:54,919 --> 00:01:58,860
The problem is that the law was limited.

26
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,440
The law could not give life.

27
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:06,360
We find that there are some false teachers that were active during the time of Paul writing

28
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,119
the letter of 2 Corinthians, there were false teachers throughout the New Testament, the

29
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:15,880
entire book of Galatians that's written to those churches in the region of Galatia is

30
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:23,479
really written because of Judaizers and these false teachers that are trying to bring and

31
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:30,639
really mingle law and grace together and bring people back into bondage.

32
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:37,320
And we find this morning that the truth of God's word, that grace and the gospel, it

33
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:41,559
delivers and it delivers us from that bondage.

34
00:02:41,559 --> 00:02:46,000
And I'm thankful this morning that as we have this portion of Scripture, I've titled the

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,740
message the glorious gospel.

36
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:54,020
And I'm looking in verse number 1, do we begin again to commend ourselves or need we

37
00:02:54,020 --> 00:03:00,820
as some others epistles of commendation to you or letters of commendation from you?

38
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:08,979
Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men for as much as ye

39
00:03:08,979 --> 00:03:15,860
are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with

40
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:21,660
ink, but with the spirit of the living God, not in tables of stone, but in fleshly tables

41
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,139
of the heart.

42
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:27,020
In such trust have we through Christ to God word.

43
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:32,539
Verse number 5, it answered the question from our text last week in verse number 16 of chapter

44
00:03:32,539 --> 00:03:37,419
2, not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves, but our

45
00:03:37,419 --> 00:03:44,860
sufficiency is of God who also hath made us able ministers of the New Testament, not of

46
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,220
the letter, but of the spirit.

47
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,619
For the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.

48
00:03:50,619 --> 00:03:54,059
We'll make our way through verse number 18 as we get through the message this morning.

49
00:03:54,059 --> 00:03:57,860
But if you're taking notes, I want you to notice number 1, the law condemns.

50
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,339
The law condemns.

51
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:02,779
We find that as we begin reading this portion of Scripture, and we'll get back to verses

52
00:04:02,779 --> 00:04:06,259
1 through 3 in just a few moments as we get through it.

53
00:04:06,259 --> 00:04:11,179
But there were some people, of course, as we continue to trace the understanding of

54
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:15,899
really the setting as Paul is writing to the church in Corinth, and there were people that

55
00:04:15,899 --> 00:04:22,579
wanted some letters of commendation, and there were, you know, the credibility, if you will,

56
00:04:22,579 --> 00:04:23,579
of Paul's ministry.

57
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:25,779
Well, Paul had served in Corinth.

58
00:04:25,779 --> 00:04:30,100
God used Paul to see that church established, and people got saved.

59
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:35,700
And Paul says that ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ, ministered by

60
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,700
us.

61
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:43,299
And these letters of commendation or recommendation in your lives are the testimony that we need.

62
00:04:43,299 --> 00:04:49,820
But we get into the text, and we find that Paul begins to unfold for us and help us understand

63
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,079
that the law condemns.

64
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:56,339
We find that as the apostle Paul is writing again to these individuals that are being

65
00:04:56,339 --> 00:05:02,100
influenced and impacted by these false teachers, these Judaizers as they've come to be known,

66
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,019
where they're seeking to mingle law and grace.

67
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:08,940
Okay, fine, you can have that, but you've got to have this as well.

68
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:13,500
And you find that in Acts chapter number 15, there's much discourse that is given to us

69
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:18,100
in Acts 15 with regard to the council at Jerusalem.

70
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,459
And what were they saying?

71
00:05:19,459 --> 00:05:24,160
Well, unless you're circumcised after the manner of Moses, you cannot be saved.

72
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:30,660
This is mingling grace and law, and we find that after much deliberation that they concluded

73
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:35,179
in Acts chapter number 15 that everyone is saved the same way.

74
00:05:35,179 --> 00:05:36,179
What is that way?

75
00:05:36,179 --> 00:05:37,179
It's Jesus.

76
00:05:37,179 --> 00:05:39,140
I am the way, the truth, and the life.

77
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,779
No man cometh unto the Father but by me.

78
00:05:41,779 --> 00:05:44,480
We're all saved by grace through faith.

79
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,119
You can't be saved by your works.

80
00:05:46,119 --> 00:05:48,179
You can't be saved by keeping the law.

81
00:05:48,179 --> 00:05:52,779
You can't be saved by being baptized, taking some kind of communion.

82
00:05:52,779 --> 00:05:53,899
There's no other way.

83
00:05:53,899 --> 00:05:56,779
It's the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ.

84
00:05:56,779 --> 00:06:01,579
And what he did on the cross of Calvary, his substitutionary death and his glorious

85
00:06:01,579 --> 00:06:06,059
resurrection is the only way that mankind can get to heaven.

86
00:06:06,059 --> 00:06:10,339
And we find that it's declared this way in Acts 15 and verse number 11, but we believe

87
00:06:10,339 --> 00:06:17,880
that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, we shall be saved even as they.

88
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,779
What a great declaration.

89
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:21,299
What a great truth.

90
00:06:21,299 --> 00:06:26,299
We go forth and we seek to share the gospel with individuals because we understand that

91
00:06:26,299 --> 00:06:27,420
the law condemns.

92
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:31,519
We understand there's one way to get to heaven and Jesus is that way.

93
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:36,260
And we find that as we look at this portion of scripture and we see that the law condemns,

94
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:40,980
we read in verse number six already, he says, the letter killeth.

95
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:44,220
When he's speaking about the letter, he's referring to the law.

96
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:49,160
We see that contextually, we'll get through the verses and you'll find how that he specifically

97
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:54,660
goes back to Moses in the book of Exodus and receiving the law and all that takes place.

98
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:59,940
And we find that he says, the letter killeth, but notice, he says, the spirit giveth life.

99
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:04,299
But as we deal with the subject of the law condemning, we see in verse six, the letter

100
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:05,299
killeth.

101
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:10,980
Notice in verse number nine, the Bible says, for if the ministration of condemnation be

102
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:11,980
glory.

103
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:17,459
So notice what he refers to the law, how he refers to the law in verse number nine, the

104
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:21,420
ministration, notice, of condemnation.

105
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:24,119
The law condemns.

106
00:07:24,119 --> 00:07:25,119
The law condemns.

107
00:07:25,119 --> 00:07:29,559
I spoke to somebody last Saturday, not yesterday, a week ago yesterday, and William was his

108
00:07:29,559 --> 00:07:32,239
name and I began to talk to him and I asked him if he knew for sure that he was going

109
00:07:32,239 --> 00:07:33,239
to heaven.

110
00:07:33,239 --> 00:07:37,279
And he said, well, I hope so, and so on and so forth, and I asked him what he was trusting

111
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:41,239
and he's like, well, you know, I try to keep the Ten Commandments.

112
00:07:41,239 --> 00:07:42,760
Really?

113
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,720
You try to keep the Ten Commandments?

114
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,720
And the sad thing is most people that would say that don't even know the Ten Commandments.

115
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:55,399
Furthermore, they don't know that there's a whole lot more to the law than Ten Commandments.

116
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:58,839
The law is much broader than just the Ten Commandments.

117
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:02,959
It's a starting point, but the reality is that the law condemns.

118
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:05,000
You begin to go through the law.

119
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,640
I asked him some questions.

120
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,760
I said, well, you know, the law says thou shalt not kill.

121
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,760
Have you ever killed anyone?

122
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,760
No.

123
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:15,519
Well, you know, Jesus said that if you hate somebody, it's like killing them.

124
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:19,079
See, Jesus took it a step further, did he not?

125
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:20,559
I said, have you ever committed adultery?

126
00:08:20,559 --> 00:08:24,760
The Bible tells us that the law says thou shalt not commit adultery, right?

127
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,760
And he says, no.

128
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,000
And I said, well, if you looked at a woman to have lust after her, you've committed it

129
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,239
already in your heart.

130
00:08:31,239 --> 00:08:33,919
Have you ever lied?

131
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,599
And he kind of just froze.

132
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,599
Thou shalt not bear false witness.

133
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:39,640
You know what the Bible tells us?

134
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,320
All men are liars.

135
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,200
The Bible tells us that.

136
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,340
And we find that the law, it condemns.

137
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,340
We find that the letter killeth.

138
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:54,260
It's the ministration, as Paul refers to it, of condemnation.

139
00:08:54,260 --> 00:09:00,619
We're reminded that God, the Lord Jesus Christ, uses that terminology in John chapter number

140
00:09:00,619 --> 00:09:01,619
three.

141
00:09:01,619 --> 00:09:06,059
And he talks about God sent not a son into the world to condemn the world, but the world

142
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:07,700
through him might be saved.

143
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,700
Why?

144
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:12,140
Because through Jesus, he fulfilled the law and he brings grace.

145
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:18,179
But we find that the Bible tells us that we're condemned already if we don't believe.

146
00:09:18,179 --> 00:09:23,219
And so we understand that we look through, in verse 18 of John three, he that believeth

147
00:09:23,219 --> 00:09:27,979
on him is not condemned, but he that believeth not is condemned already.

148
00:09:27,979 --> 00:09:30,780
It's very plain.

149
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,219
The Old Testament, the law, it killeth.

150
00:09:33,219 --> 00:09:35,059
It's the ministration of condemnation.

151
00:09:35,059 --> 00:09:40,299
Notice, furthermore, not only does the law condemn, but we find that the law is temporary.

152
00:09:40,299 --> 00:09:44,260
We find that in verse number seven, the Bible says of the ministration of death.

153
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,739
Notice how he refers to it there.

154
00:09:45,739 --> 00:09:51,099
The ministration of death written and engraven in stones was glorious so that the children

155
00:09:51,099 --> 00:09:56,559
of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance.

156
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:00,020
Notice this, which glory was to be done away.

157
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:03,940
We see in verse seven that phrase to end the verse,

158
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,540
which glory was to be done away.

159
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,420
It was temporary.

160
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,980
The law was never intended to be permanent.

161
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:12,180
It was a shadow of good things to come.

162
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,100
As we see in Hebrews chapter number 10,

163
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,780
we find that it was temporary.

164
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:16,940
It was fading away.

165
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,260
It was to be done away.

166
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:20,420
We see in verse number 11, the Bible says,

167
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,460
for if that which is done away was glorious,

168
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,740
much more that which remaineth is glorious.

169
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,660
We find in verse number 13,

170
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:31,020
and not as Moses, which put a veil over his face,

171
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,620
that the children of Israel could not steadfastly look

172
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:36,980
to the end of that, which is abolished.

173
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,300
And so we see these three verses of scripture

174
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,940
in verse seven, in verse 11, in verse 13,

175
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,640
that make reference to the fact that the law,

176
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,620
yes, it condemns, but it was also temporary.

177
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:50,740
It had glory, but that glory was to be done away.

178
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:53,740
And we find that it would be abolished.

179
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:57,060
We find that here as Paul is writing again

180
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,540
to individuals that are being confronted

181
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:02,700
with this idea of the importance of keeping the law

182
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,580
and this mingling and all that was going on

183
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:08,540
that Paul very plainly is going to bring

184
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:11,600
to the attention of these believers and to us today

185
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,140
that, listen, the law had its purpose,

186
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:18,280
but the law condemns, and the law cannot bring life.

187
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,940
The law was temporary.

188
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,460
Notice it was a fading glory.

189
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,980
We noticed in verse number seven,

190
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:26,060
it says that the glory was to be done away,

191
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,860
and it refers to Moses, and I mentioned

192
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,180
that it takes us back to the book of Exodus,

193
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:34,860
but notice specifically in verses 13 through 16

194
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:39,560
how the apostle Paul begins to really give further insight

195
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,740
with regard to this historical event

196
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,100
from the book of Exodus.

197
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:46,540
Notice in verse 13, and not as Moses,

198
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,260
which put a veil over his face

199
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:50,660
that the children of Israel could not steadfastly look

200
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,880
to the end of that which is abolished,

201
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,400
but their minds were blinded for until this day

202
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,000
remaineth the same veil untaken away

203
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,800
in the reading of the Old Testament,

204
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,460
which veil is done away in Christ,

205
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:08,840
but even unto this day when Moses is read,

206
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,960
the veil is upon their heart.

207
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,940
Who's he talking about?

208
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,520
He's speaking about the children of Israel,

209
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,960
the nation of Israel specifically, and this blindness.

210
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,040
Remember in the Gospel of John

211
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,760
when Jesus healed the man that was born blind

212
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,120
and there's all kinds of stirring that takes place

213
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,440
and the religious leaders at the end of the text,

214
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,080
they say this in John nine, are we blind also?

215
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,320
And the sad reality is that they could see physically,

216
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,760
but they were blind spiritually.

217
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,240
In fact, as we come to 2 Corinthians chapter four

218
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,680
as we deal with it next week,

219
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,120
the Bible talks about how the God of this world

220
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:48,040
hath blinded the minds of them which believe not.

221
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,680
That's spiritual blindness.

222
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,120
What does the enemy use

223
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,480
to cause people to be blind spiritually?

224
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,580
Well, for the nation of Israel, it's the law,

225
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:00,400
and they're still stuck in this process

226
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,800
of looking at the law and they still have this veil.

227
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,800
He says unto this day.

228
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,400
This was written in the first century,

229
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,640
but can I share with you this morning

230
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:13,960
that it's true even unto this day in 2025

231
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,400
that there is spiritual blindness that has happened

232
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,400
on the part of the nation of Israel.

233
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,360
It does not mean that God is done with Israel.

234
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:26,600
It simply means that because of their rejection of Messiah,

235
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,320
that there's this spiritual blindness,

236
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,700
and we as the Gentiles have been grafted in.

237
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,960
What a blessing.

238
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,560
And we could get into so many portions of scripture

239
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,020
this morning and look at all of that truth,

240
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,060
the book of Hebrews, the book of Romans,

241
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:45,060
but we find that the spiritual blindness is still present.

242
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,460
It breaks my heart.

243
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,200
I had a conversation personally

244
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,800
with someone this past week

245
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,800
that would have this perspective

246
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,880
of Jewish tradition and what have you,

247
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,380
and they were talking about how they try so hard

248
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:02,400
to keep the law, and it just broke my heart.

249
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,240
Why?

250
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,680
Because they can't keep the law.

251
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,720
And the reality is that they,

252
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:11,360
even in telling me that they were trying to keep the law,

253
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,180
were actually breaking the law

254
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:17,040
while telling me they were keeping the law

255
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:21,760
and made justification for breaking the law.

256
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,600
It's sad.

257
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,200
It grieves my heart.

258
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,740
Because the law condemns.

259
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,820
The law condemns.

260
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,640
We find that in verse 16, it says,

261
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,400
"'Nevertheless, when it,'

262
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,500
that's referring to the heart back in verse 15,

263
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,320
"'that the veil is upon their heart,

264
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,360
"'nevertheless, when it shall turn to the Lord,

265
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,640
"'the veil shall be taken away.'"

266
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,640
You know, it's amazing.

267
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,600
There are Jewish people that are saved today,

268
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,560
that have been saved.

269
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,400
Listen, Paul was Jewish, amen?

270
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,600
There's no contradiction,

271
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,920
there's no argument over Paul being Jewish,

272
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,320
and there are many others

273
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,920
that we read throughout the scriptures.

274
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,000
Yes, there were many Jews that rejected

275
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,600
and he turned to the Gentiles,

276
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,400
but there are Jewish people today that still get saved.

277
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,720
They have to be saved the same way we have to be saved.

278
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,040
They're not saved because they're Jewish.

279
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,960
There's some false teaching out there.

280
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:20,040
In fact, there's some prominent TV preachers

281
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,880
that are prominent that say,

282
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,840
"'If you're Jewish, you're just going to heaven,'

283
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,680
that's wrong, that's a lie.

284
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,720
That is not what the Bible teaches.

285
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,360
No one is going to heaven because of their ancestry.

286
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,080
You only get to heaven by trusting Jesus Christ

287
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,760
as your personal savior,

288
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,560
and we find that that is true.

289
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,840
And here's the amazing thing,

290
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,080
when it says in verse 16,

291
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,360
and you can read testimonies of this today,

292
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,040
that it says, "'Nevertheless, when it,'

293
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,800
"'the heart shall turn to the Lord,'

294
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,280
"'the veil shall be taken away.'"

295
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:52,640
I have read testimonies after testimonies of Jewish people

296
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,840
that after they trust Christ as their savior,

297
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:58,440
it's like they say, it's like the scales came off.

298
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,120
It's like there was a veil taken away.

299
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,280
It's what the Bible says.

300
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:07,000
And there's no longer that blindness that takes place.

301
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,280
And so we find that Paul is referring back

302
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,400
to this account in Exodus.

303
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,320
Notice with me, if you will,

304
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,920
turn back to Exodus 34,

305
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,600
very quickly this morning,

306
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,400
and I want you to see what Paul is referring to,

307
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,280
and you're no doubt familiar with it.

308
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,000
He's not talking about the giving of the 10 Commandments

309
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,840
the first time in chapter 20.

310
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:28,480
He's looking at the covenant renewed really in chapter 34.

311
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,360
Now you remember that in between,

312
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,280
after Moses comes down after Exodus 20

313
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,200
and the receiving of the 10 Commandments,

314
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,280
what does he find?

315
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,240
Well, the people say we're gonna obey,

316
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,440
and then shortly thereafter, they disobey.

317
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,080
They break the law.

318
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:46,240
Exodus chapter 32 is a very terrible passage of Scripture

319
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,240
in which you read of the golden calf

320
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,680
and all that takes place.

321
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,840
And so God calls Moses back up.

322
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,320
Notice in chapter 34 in verse number one,

323
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,080
the Bible says, and the Lord said unto Moses,

324
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,760
hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first.

325
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,880
What happened to the first?

326
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,800
Well, they were broken.

327
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,640
Why?

328
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,960
Because he comes down off the mountain,

329
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,360
he sees all that's taking place,

330
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,400
and they're broken.

331
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,240
And we find that not only were they broken physically,

332
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,680
but it was representative of the fact

333
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,680
that they had broken the law through their sin.

334
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:19,160
And we find that he says, and I will write unto thee,

335
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,480
write upon these tables the words

336
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,960
that were in the first tables which thou breakest.

337
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:28,480
Now understand with me that God is able

338
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,680
to preserve his word.

339
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,200
This passage of Scripture, I'm not gonna go down

340
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,320
and deal with Bible preservation specifically from here,

341
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,200
but you can look here.

342
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,480
You can look at Jeremiah when they took the pen knife

343
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,800
and they threw it in the fire,

344
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,640
and guess what?

345
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,640
God is able to preserve his word.

346
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,640
Though man tries to destroy it,

347
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,280
God has promised to preserve it.

348
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,960
And we can rejoice in that.

349
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,840
And he says, and be ready in the morning,

350
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,640
and come up in the morning unto Mount Sinai,

351
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,720
and present thyself, singular,

352
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,120
there to me in the top of the mount.

353
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,200
And no man shall come up with thee,

354
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,880
neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount,

355
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,840
neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount.

356
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,920
And so we find that God gives very specific instruction.

357
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,840
Now remember these three verses.

358
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,600
We're not on time to read the entirety of chapter 34,

359
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,400
but we find that Moses goes up

360
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,600
as he had been instructed to do so.

361
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,920
In verse eight it says, and Moses made haste

362
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,800
and bowed his head toward the earth and worshiped.

363
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:32,320
We find that God is going to give him truth.

364
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,800
He's going to deal with that.

365
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,239
Notice in verse 29, let's pick it up at the end.

366
00:18:36,239 --> 00:18:38,800
In verse 29, the Bible says, and it came to pass

367
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,400
when Moses came down from Mount Sinai

368
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,760
with the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand,

369
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,280
when he came down from the mount,

370
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:52,280
that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone

371
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,679
while he talked with him.

372
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,840
Isn't that awesome?

373
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,440
I mean, his face was shining

374
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,239
because he had been in the presence of God.

375
00:19:04,239 --> 00:19:05,080
You know, there's something true

376
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,880
about this for us this morning.

377
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,119
When you're in the presence of God,

378
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,800
you can see what other people can tell.

379
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,119
You know what the Bible says?

380
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:13,960
Listen, it might not be that your face shines

381
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:17,559
the way that Moses' face shined here in Exodus chapter 34.

382
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:19,880
But do you remember what the religious leader said

383
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,160
in Acts chapter number four,

384
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,880
when they deal with Peter and John and they say,

385
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,800
these are ignorant and unlearned men?

386
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:32,119
But they had been with Jesus.

387
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:33,679
That's what the Bible tells us.

388
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,000
And listen, when you spend time with Jesus,

389
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,280
it's evident to other people.

390
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,119
You ever notice on somebody's countenance,

391
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:42,840
you can see, if you know someone well enough,

392
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,440
you can see on their countenance whether something's wrong

393
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,559
or whether something's good.

394
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:49,400
Amen?

395
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,220
You've been married long enough,

396
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,800
I can look at Holly, she can walk in a room

397
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,160
and I say, honey, are you okay?

398
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,200
What's wrong?

399
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,040
Nothing.

400
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,119
Hold on a minute.

401
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:57,800
You ever do this with your spouse?

402
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,800
Hold on a minute.

403
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,960
You're telling me nothing,

404
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,840
your face is telling me something different.

405
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,360
Our countenance.

406
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,360
And his face was shining.

407
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,200
Why?

408
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,280
Because he'd been in the presence of God.

409
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,480
Psalm 16, and his presence is fullness of joy.

410
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,320
Notice it was only Moses that could go to that mount.

411
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,240
Thyself, no man with thee.

412
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,520
Remember that, it's important.

413
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,000
Verse 29, verse 30,

414
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,720
and when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses,

415
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,920
behold, the skin of his face shone,

416
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,280
and they were afraid to come nigh him.

417
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,360
I guess so.

418
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,960
Notice in verse 31,

419
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,320
and Moses called unto them,

420
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,200
and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation

421
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,280
returned unto him, and Moses talked with them.

422
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,720
And afterward, all the children of Israel came nigh,

423
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,120
and he gave them in commandment

424
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,720
all that the Lord had spoken with him in Mount Sinai.

425
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,240
Until Moses had done speaking with them,

426
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,440
notice he put a veil on his face.

427
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,320
But when Moses went in before the Lord to speak with him,

428
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,000
he took the veil off until he came out,

429
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,440
and he came out and spake unto the children of Israel

430
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,200
that which he was commanded.

431
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,920
And so we find that verse 35,

432
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,840
and the children of Israel saw the face of Moses,

433
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,000
that the skin of Moses' face shone,

434
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,680
and Moses put the veil upon his face again

435
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,240
until he went in to speak with him.

436
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,080
It's important to recognize that Moses,

437
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:27,240
his face did not shine until the day of his death.

438
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,400
It was a fading glory.

439
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:33,080
He really, as you look at 2 Corinthians 3,

440
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,640
it seems as if Paul, again,

441
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,440
the idea and the teaching of progressive revelation,

442
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,280
that Paul is helping us understand

443
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,600
something about Exodus 34

444
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,440
that we may not find contextually,

445
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,560
specifically there at the first read,

446
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,480
but it seems as if Moses is putting this veil on

447
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,720
because this glory would fade.

448
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,760
And as the glory would fade,

449
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,480
it would not be visible to the other people,

450
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,680
the children of Israel, that the glory was fading,

451
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,960
but it was representative of the fact,

452
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,400
as we talk about the law specifically,

453
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,720
which glory was to be done away.

454
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,280
We find that, again, the law has purpose.

455
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,200
Look at Romans chapter number seven.

456
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,080
The law condemns, but understand this morning

457
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,360
that we cannot throw the law out

458
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,040
just because the law condemns,

459
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,480
because there is a purpose.

460
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,160
God, he doeth all things well.

461
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,120
He has a perfect plan.

462
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,720
He is the eternal God.

463
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,600
He is the one that knows the end from the beginning,

464
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,000
and he gave the law and he gave it with purpose.

465
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,880
In Romans chapter number seven,

466
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,880
we do not have time to read the entirety,

467
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,640
but look at verse number seven down through verse 14 with me

468
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,280
and notice what the Bible says.

469
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,520
What shall we say then?

470
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,240
Is the law sin?

471
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,440
God forbid, nay.

472
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,360
Notice what Paul says.

473
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,680
This is his testimony.

474
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:53,120
I had not known sin, but by the law.

475
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:57,480
For I had not known lust, except the law had said,

476
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,680
thou shalt not covet.

477
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,200
So do you understand what Paul's saying?

478
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,040
Because the law exists, it reveals,

479
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,920
it shows me that I'm a sinner.

480
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,360
It reveals that.

481
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,880
But sin, taking occasion by the commandment,

482
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,480
wrought in me all manner of concupiscence,

483
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,880
for without the law, sin was dead.

484
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,760
For I was alive without the law once,

485
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,600
but when the commandment came, sin revived and I died.

486
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,320
The commandment, which was ordained to life,

487
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,280
I found to be unto death.

488
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,600
For sin, taking occasion by the commandment,

489
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,640
deceived me and by it slew me.

490
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,760
Wherefore, the law is holy and the commandment holy

491
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,080
and just and good.

492
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,960
Verse 13, was then that which is good made death unto me?

493
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,760
God forbid, but sin, that it might appear sin,

494
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,800
working death in me by that which is good,

495
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,780
that sin by the commandment might become,

496
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:55,440
notice, exceeding sinful.

497
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,580
For we know that the law is spiritual,

498
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:00,700
but I am carnal, sold under sin.

499
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,960
What is Paul saying?

500
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:05,100
He's saying that the law has a purpose.

501
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:08,600
The law reveals that we are sinners.

502
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,540
No law, how do we know?

503
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:11,380
See, that's the problem.

504
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:13,620
When you remove law, you have anarchy,

505
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,980
but you have a situation where every man doeth that

506
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,820
which is right in his own sight.

507
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:20,100
How can you tell me that what I'm doing is wrong

508
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,740
if there's no standard, if there's no law?

509
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:27,740
God gave the law and by it, mankind is condemned.

510
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,140
Notice in Galatians chapter three,

511
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:32,060
Galatians chapter number three,

512
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,540
and it would be worth mentioning

513
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,020
as we look at the book of Galatians,

514
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,940
again, as I said by way of introduction,

515
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:40,340
that Paul is dealing with this situation

516
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:42,900
with the Judaizers throughout the entirety

517
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,580
of the book of Galatians.

518
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:48,020
But notice specifically in the third chapter in verse 21,

519
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:53,300
the Bible says this in Galatians three in verse 21,

520
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:56,380
is the law then against the promises of God?

521
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:58,060
God forbid.

522
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,700
For if there had been a law given

523
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,900
which could have given life,

524
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:05,620
verily righteousness should have been by the law.

525
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:06,460
But you know what?

526
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,300
There's no law that can give life

527
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:12,120
because the law condemns, the letter killeth.

528
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,280
Verse 22, but the scripture hath concluded,

529
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:19,080
all under sin, that the promise by faith

530
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:24,080
of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.

531
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,040
But before faith came, verse 23,

532
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,440
we were kept under the law,

533
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:32,800
shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed,

534
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:37,160
wherefore the law was our schoolmaster

535
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,160
to bring us unto Christ,

536
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:44,520
that we might be justified by faith.

537
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:47,200
This is a beautiful truth that God gives us here

538
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,660
in Galatians chapter number three.

539
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:53,160
The law, it cannot save me, it cannot give me life.

540
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,720
No matter how many people say,

541
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,480
I'm trying to keep the law, I'm trying to keep the law,

542
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,000
it can never give life because the law condemns.

543
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
But what the law does is it reveals that I'm a sinner

544
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,440
and it leads me, it points me to Christ,

545
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,720
the one who can give life.

546
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:15,320
The term is used, our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ.

547
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:19,640
Notice in chapter two of Galatians in verse 21,

548
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:23,000
Paul says, I do not frustrate the grace of God,

549
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,440
for if righteousness come by the law,

550
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,560
then Christ is dead in vain.

551
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,220
Jesus did not die in vain.

552
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,140
His death was prophesied.

553
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:42,820
His death was a substitutionary atonement.

554
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:46,300
His death, of course, followed by his glorious resurrection

555
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:49,800
is the only way by which mankind can be redeemed.

556
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,300
His death was not in vain.

557
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,740
And yet there are people today

558
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:58,540
that are still trying to do works to get to heaven.

559
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:02,620
There are still today denominations

560
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:06,220
and churches all across the land,

561
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,240
all across the world that are teaching

562
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,100
that you have to do and do and do in order to be saved.

563
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,180
And you know why that's so appealing?

564
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,320
Because our flesh is merit driven.

565
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,360
Our flesh is merit driven.

566
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:27,980
And so I wanna feel like I did something to earn something.

567
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,300
The reality is I come to Christ and say,

568
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:35,380
I'm nothing and I have nothing to bring, nothing to offer.

569
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:38,140
I am a sinner that is guilty,

570
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:41,380
that deserves the lake of fire.

571
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:45,580
But you loved me and you died for me.

572
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:49,620
And you offer to me the gift of God, which is eternal life.

573
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,740
I can't work for it, you can't work for it,

574
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,060
no one can work for it.

575
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:56,500
But the false teachers continue today

576
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:59,940
to teach a works-based salvation

577
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:03,140
because it's so appealing to the flesh.

578
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:07,100
But it rejects the truth of God's word.

579
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,100
And here's the reality, there are people

580
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,780
that take it another step and say,

581
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:13,920
okay, well you can't be saved by your works,

582
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,340
but you have to do works to stay saved.

583
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:19,340
I can't earn it and I can't keep it,

584
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:22,400
and I'm so thankful that I'm kept by the power of God.

585
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:26,280
And we find Hebrews 10, I referenced it a moment ago,

586
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,980
but look there with me quickly.

587
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:31,420
In Hebrews chapter 10, in verses one through four,

588
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:34,100
and we'll reference this passage again in just a moment,

589
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,980
but we find in Hebrews 10 in verses one through four,

590
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,640
the Bible says this.

591
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:43,860
Notice in verse number one,

592
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:48,460
for the law, having a shadow of good things to come,

593
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,580
and not the very image of the things,

594
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:53,280
can never, with those sacrifices

595
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:56,460
which they offered year by year continually,

596
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:59,340
make the comers thereunto perfect.

597
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:02,140
For then would they not have ceased to be offered?

598
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,500
I mean, that's a valid question, is it not?

599
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:08,220
I mean, if it could accomplish what they were teaching,

600
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:11,420
that it could accomplish, if it could do that,

601
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:14,240
then there'd be no reason to continue offering.

602
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,220
But he says this, because that the worshipers once purged

603
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,720
should have laid no more conscience of sins.

604
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,900
But the problem is that it could not.

605
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,980
Notice verse three, but in those sacrifices,

606
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:27,700
there's a remembrance again made of sin every year,

607
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:31,460
for it is not possible that the blood of bulls

608
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:35,420
and of goats should take away sins.

609
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,700
What did it do?

610
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,940
It pointed to Jesus, the Messiah.

611
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:43,700
All of that sacrificial system in the Old Testament,

612
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:46,460
all that was taking place from the garden

613
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:51,220
when Adam and Eve sinned and an animal had to be sacrificed,

614
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:53,400
I believe a lamb had to be sacrificed

615
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,660
in order to provide the covering of skin,

616
00:29:56,660 --> 00:30:00,179
blood was shed, you think about the situation.

617
00:30:00,179 --> 00:30:03,379
with Abraham and Isaac, and God said,

618
00:30:03,379 --> 00:30:07,119
I will provide myself a lamb, a substitute.

619
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:09,179
We find that you look at the Passover

620
00:30:09,179 --> 00:30:10,659
and you go over and over,

621
00:30:10,659 --> 00:30:13,159
and it's blood and it's blood and it's blood.

622
00:30:13,159 --> 00:30:13,999
Why?

623
00:30:13,999 --> 00:30:16,199
Because it pointed to Messiah,

624
00:30:16,199 --> 00:30:19,299
who would one day come and shed his precious blood

625
00:30:19,299 --> 00:30:21,899
for the sin of the world.

626
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:24,239
The law.

627
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:29,879
Paul says very plainly in 2 Corinthians 3,

628
00:30:30,139 --> 00:30:31,739
it condemns.

629
00:30:31,739 --> 00:30:35,719
It's temporary, has a fading glory.

630
00:30:35,719 --> 00:30:37,679
It had a purpose.

631
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:41,959
But we find this morning that the law condemns.

632
00:30:41,959 --> 00:30:43,459
The contrast, I told you,

633
00:30:43,459 --> 00:30:45,399
that's found in 2 Corinthians 3,

634
00:30:45,399 --> 00:30:47,759
as you turn back there throughout the chapters,

635
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:51,839
there's this contrast between law and grace.

636
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:53,039
Law and grace.

637
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:56,139
The letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.

638
00:30:56,139 --> 00:30:59,539
And we find that this chapter provides this contrast,

639
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:02,199
and if we were to look at the passage,

640
00:31:02,199 --> 00:31:03,779
we would say, number one, this morning,

641
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:06,639
that the law condemns, but number two this morning,

642
00:31:06,639 --> 00:31:09,019
the gospel converts.

643
00:31:09,019 --> 00:31:11,319
What is the gospel?

644
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:13,319
Well, Paul answers that question

645
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:15,819
in 1 Corinthians 15, verses three and four.

646
00:31:15,819 --> 00:31:17,679
It's the death, burial, and resurrection.

647
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:19,719
In that passage, he says repeatedly,

648
00:31:19,719 --> 00:31:22,159
according to the scriptures.

649
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,899
And I love that he uses that phraseology, why?

650
00:31:24,899 --> 00:31:28,259
Because he's referring to the Old Testament scriptures.

651
00:31:28,259 --> 00:31:31,359
He's saying he died according to the scriptures.

652
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:33,099
He was buried according to the scriptures.

653
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:35,259
He rose again according to the scriptures.

654
00:31:35,259 --> 00:31:37,159
And what a blessing to understand

655
00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:40,359
that God always does what he says he will do.

656
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:43,159
And we find this morning that the gospel converts.

657
00:31:43,159 --> 00:31:47,039
It's the good news of Jesus Christ,

658
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:50,199
that Jesus is the only Savior,

659
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:53,779
that he died and he was buried and he rose again.

660
00:31:53,779 --> 00:31:57,479
And this is the message in which we are called to deliver.

661
00:31:57,499 --> 00:32:00,819
I shared with you that I said to that Amazon driver

662
00:32:00,819 --> 00:32:03,759
the other day, I said, you're delivering the packages

663
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:05,299
and I'm delivering the gospel.

664
00:32:05,299 --> 00:32:07,059
And he said, man, I love the gospel.

665
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:08,659
And I got to chat with him just for a moment.

666
00:32:08,659 --> 00:32:11,219
But the reality is that we, Paul said,

667
00:32:11,219 --> 00:32:14,359
I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, why?

668
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:17,239
For it is the power of God unto salvation.

669
00:32:17,239 --> 00:32:19,539
The gospel converts this morning.

670
00:32:19,539 --> 00:32:22,259
The law condemns, but the gospel converts.

671
00:32:22,259 --> 00:32:25,779
In verse six, the Bible says the spirit giveth life.

672
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:27,839
Notice with me in verse number eight,

673
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:29,559
it's verse number nine, excuse me.

674
00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:32,399
It uses the ministration of condemnation,

675
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:35,519
speaking about the law, but notice what it says.

676
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:40,519
Much more doth the ministration, notice this,

677
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:45,439
of righteousness exceed in glory.

678
00:32:45,439 --> 00:32:48,219
The ministration, as he mentions in verse number nine,

679
00:32:48,219 --> 00:32:50,199
of condemnation be glory.

680
00:32:50,199 --> 00:32:51,379
Why is he saying that?

681
00:32:51,379 --> 00:32:54,679
Well, because of Exodus 34 and what we read a moment ago.

682
00:32:54,699 --> 00:32:56,219
But then the contrast,

683
00:32:56,219 --> 00:32:58,519
the ministration of condemnation be glory.

684
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:03,519
Much more doth the ministration of righteousness

685
00:33:03,859 --> 00:33:06,699
exceed in glory.

686
00:33:06,699 --> 00:33:09,379
Begin to think about this ministration of righteousness

687
00:33:09,379 --> 00:33:12,299
and understanding that in just a couple of chapters here

688
00:33:12,299 --> 00:33:13,779
in the book of 2 Corinthians,

689
00:33:13,779 --> 00:33:16,579
that Paul will write that great verse of scripture

690
00:33:16,579 --> 00:33:18,539
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

691
00:33:18,539 --> 00:33:21,399
that God hath made him Jesus to be sin for us

692
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:22,619
who knew no sin,

693
00:33:22,619 --> 00:33:27,619
that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.

694
00:33:28,179 --> 00:33:29,839
Oh, it's glorious.

695
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:31,299
It converts.

696
00:33:31,299 --> 00:33:34,799
We find that this new way, if you will,

697
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:36,439
this glorious gospel,

698
00:33:36,439 --> 00:33:38,819
as Paul was talking about this ministry,

699
00:33:38,819 --> 00:33:40,799
remember we mentioned last week

700
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:44,439
that as Paul mentions about Titus and his trip

701
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:47,479
and he was not able to find Titus when he came to Troas,

702
00:33:47,479 --> 00:33:51,000
that introducing in chapter number two

703
00:33:51,639 --> 00:33:54,119
and all the way really through chapter number six,

704
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:57,279
he talks about this ministry that we've been given.

705
00:33:58,359 --> 00:34:00,159
And here in chapter number three,

706
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:02,839
he's talking about the glorious gospel,

707
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:05,619
this new way and it excels in glory.

708
00:34:05,619 --> 00:34:08,079
Notice in verse number nine, it says this,

709
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:10,519
for the ministration of condemnation be glory,

710
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:12,959
much more doth the ministration of righteousness,

711
00:34:12,959 --> 00:34:15,659
notice, exceed in glory.

712
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:19,000
Verse 10, for even that which was made glorious

713
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,839
had no glory in this respect

714
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:25,160
by reason of the glory that exceleth.

715
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:29,639
Think about this illustration just for a moment.

716
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:33,919
I've been in this auditorium when it's extremely dark.

717
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:35,759
In fact, we have new shades

718
00:34:35,759 --> 00:34:37,559
and those shades make it dark in here

719
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:39,359
even in the middle of the day.

720
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:42,160
But I've walked through this auditorium

721
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,399
many times at night when it's dark

722
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:45,839
and the shades are pulled

723
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:49,119
and I need to get from that door to this door.

724
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:51,119
There are a lot of things in the way.

725
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:52,639
And I can tell you that the pews

726
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,299
don't feel good on your knees.

727
00:34:55,559 --> 00:34:58,399
All right, you knock into one of these pews and it hurts.

728
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:01,919
And so I use a little light,

729
00:35:01,919 --> 00:35:04,359
maybe a flashlight, one of those key chain flashlights

730
00:35:04,359 --> 00:35:06,940
that we give out, maybe the light on my phone,

731
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:10,239
but I use a light to be able to get through this auditorium

732
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:11,799
at nighttime because it's dark.

733
00:35:12,759 --> 00:35:14,579
But you know that light does nothing for me

734
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:16,699
during the day when the lights are on?

735
00:35:16,699 --> 00:35:19,199
You don't need your flashlight right now.

736
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:21,619
If you walk through this auditorium right now

737
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:23,419
with your little key chain flashlight

738
00:35:23,419 --> 00:35:26,660
to try to get through here, people think you're crazy.

739
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:27,500
Why?

740
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,299
Because there's so much more light.

741
00:35:30,459 --> 00:35:34,299
And so that light, that little flashlight,

742
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:37,179
is of no use in the fact that

743
00:35:37,179 --> 00:35:39,779
there's something that's greater.

744
00:35:39,779 --> 00:35:42,259
And so we find that as we think about this,

745
00:35:42,259 --> 00:35:44,820
it's not again that the law is of no use,

746
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:47,500
there is glory, but it points us to Christ.

747
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:51,179
And we find that here, this new way he talks about

748
00:35:51,179 --> 00:35:55,059
in verse number six, that who also hath made us.

749
00:35:55,059 --> 00:35:56,660
Remember, he's talking about the ministry

750
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,339
that God has given to him.

751
00:35:58,339 --> 00:36:01,660
Able ministers of the New Testament,

752
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:04,139
this new covenant that God spoke about

753
00:36:04,139 --> 00:36:06,419
in Jeremiah chapter 31.

754
00:36:06,419 --> 00:36:10,979
And we find that here now, the apostle Paul is talking

755
00:36:10,979 --> 00:36:14,339
and giving this contrast between the law condemning

756
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,459
and the gospel converting.

757
00:36:17,459 --> 00:36:19,220
He says in verse number 11,

758
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,500
for if that which was done away was glorious,

759
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:25,100
much more that which remaineth is glorious.

760
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:28,660
Do you see how he keeps talking in terms of excelling

761
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:31,779
and exceeding and being much more?

762
00:36:31,779 --> 00:36:36,779
Verse 12, seeing then that we have such hope.

763
00:36:37,899 --> 00:36:40,500
Oh, I'm so thankful for the hope that we have in Christ.

764
00:36:41,019 --> 00:36:41,859
He is our hope.

765
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:46,419
My hope is Jesus, the songwriter said.

766
00:36:46,419 --> 00:36:49,820
And we've sang that song here, what a great song it is.

767
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:52,779
And the reality this morning is that it says,

768
00:36:52,779 --> 00:36:55,139
seeing then that we have such hope,

769
00:36:55,139 --> 00:36:58,619
we use great plainness of speech.

770
00:36:58,619 --> 00:37:00,660
Why is Paul talking about this plainness of speech?

771
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:03,459
Because there's nothing for us to complicate here.

772
00:37:03,459 --> 00:37:04,779
The gospel's simple.

773
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,859
You know, it's so simple that sometimes

774
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:09,279
people stumble over it.

775
00:37:10,539 --> 00:37:14,579
Again, to talk about that fleshly tendency,

776
00:37:14,579 --> 00:37:18,019
that there must be something I have to do to get to heaven.

777
00:37:18,019 --> 00:37:19,459
There must be some good thing

778
00:37:19,459 --> 00:37:21,579
that I have to do to get to heaven.

779
00:37:21,579 --> 00:37:24,100
And you go to someone and you share the gospel with them

780
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,799
and you give them the plainness of the gospel,

781
00:37:26,799 --> 00:37:30,380
that Jesus paid it all, that he said it is finished,

782
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:31,899
that he said done.

783
00:37:31,899 --> 00:37:33,859
There's nothing more for us to do.

784
00:37:33,859 --> 00:37:36,859
There's nothing that we could possibly do.

785
00:37:36,859 --> 00:37:40,660
As Isaiah says, all of our good works are as filthy rags.

786
00:37:42,459 --> 00:37:47,459
So many people stumble over the simplicity of the gospel.

787
00:37:49,459 --> 00:37:51,779
The simplicity of the gospel.

788
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:57,479
People struggle with security because they wonder,

789
00:37:57,479 --> 00:37:59,399
did they really do this, that, or the other?

790
00:37:59,399 --> 00:38:00,779
Did they understand?

791
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:04,139
Jesus said, as it's recorded for us,

792
00:38:05,139 --> 00:38:07,019
by Paul writing in Romans chapter 10,

793
00:38:07,019 --> 00:38:09,779
for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord

794
00:38:09,779 --> 00:38:10,859
shall be saved.

795
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,859
When we recognize that we're sinners

796
00:38:15,859 --> 00:38:18,139
and that he's the only savior,

797
00:38:18,139 --> 00:38:20,779
we say I can't save myself, there's nothing I can do.

798
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:24,579
But you're the savior.

799
00:38:24,579 --> 00:38:26,600
You died for me, you took my place,

800
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,579
you paid what I could never pay.

801
00:38:29,419 --> 00:38:32,779
You rose, demonstrating your power,

802
00:38:32,779 --> 00:38:34,940
the completeness of the transaction,

803
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:38,219
and I accept you, I call upon you to be my savior,

804
00:38:38,219 --> 00:38:41,460
to give me that gift of eternal life.

805
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:43,339
Then guess what God does?

806
00:38:43,339 --> 00:38:44,979
He saves you.

807
00:38:44,979 --> 00:38:45,799
Why?

808
00:38:45,799 --> 00:38:46,880
Well, he cannot lie.

809
00:38:47,899 --> 00:38:50,719
We come to him by faith, trusting him.

810
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:54,020
Simply trusting, with childlike faith.

811
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:56,700
In the gospel, it converts.

812
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,859
The lives of these individuals

813
00:38:58,859 --> 00:39:01,140
had been transformed by the gospel.

814
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:03,859
Their lives were evidence to the power

815
00:39:03,859 --> 00:39:06,460
of the gospel to convert.

816
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:08,059
He said in the beginning verses

817
00:39:08,059 --> 00:39:09,899
of 2 Corinthians chapter number three,

818
00:39:09,899 --> 00:39:11,899
do we begin again to commend ourselves,

819
00:39:11,899 --> 00:39:15,460
or need we, as some others, epistles of commendation to you

820
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:17,460
or letters of commendation from you?

821
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:21,739
Ye are our epistle, written in our hearts,

822
00:39:21,739 --> 00:39:24,099
known and read of all men,

823
00:39:24,099 --> 00:39:26,940
for as much as ye are manifestly declared

824
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,580
to be the epistle of Christ,

825
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:30,599
ministered by us, written not with ink,

826
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,520
but with the spirit of the living God,

827
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,719
not in tables of stone,

828
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:36,159
but in fleshly tables of the heart.

829
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:38,239
What is Paul saying?

830
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:43,239
Your lives are the testimony of the power of the gospel.

831
00:39:44,359 --> 00:39:46,640
Let me remind you of what the Bible says

832
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,239
in 1 Corinthians chapter six,

833
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:49,839
turn back, hold your spot,

834
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:51,279
in 2 Corinthians chapter three,

835
00:39:51,279 --> 00:39:53,760
but let me remind you of what the Bible says here

836
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,599
in 1 Corinthians chapter number six.

837
00:39:56,599 --> 00:39:59,760
In verse number nine of 1 Corinthians chapter number six,

838
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,599
he's writing.

839
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:03,499
to the same group of people that had gone in to Corinth,

840
00:40:03,499 --> 00:40:05,499
he had preached the gospel, people got saved,

841
00:40:05,499 --> 00:40:06,799
and praised the Lord for it.

842
00:40:06,799 --> 00:40:09,839
In verse 9, it says this of 1 Corinthians 6 and verse 9,

843
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:11,879
know ye not that the unrighteousness

844
00:40:11,879 --> 00:40:14,119
shall not inherit the kingdom of God?

845
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:16,679
Be not deceived, neither fornicators, nor idolaters,

846
00:40:16,679 --> 00:40:18,119
nor adulterers, nor effeminate,

847
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:20,219
nor abusers of themselves with mankind,

848
00:40:20,219 --> 00:40:23,259
nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards,

849
00:40:23,259 --> 00:40:25,199
nor revilers, nor extortioners

850
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:28,299
shall inherit the kingdom of God.

851
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:30,099
But look at verse number 11.

852
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:36,079
And such were some of you, such were some of you,

853
00:40:37,019 --> 00:40:42,019
but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified,

854
00:40:42,199 --> 00:40:45,499
but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus

855
00:40:45,499 --> 00:40:48,619
and by the Spirit of our God.

856
00:40:48,619 --> 00:40:53,099
He said, listen, as he calls out in verse 9 and 10,

857
00:40:53,099 --> 00:40:55,499
all of these particular sins

858
00:40:55,819 --> 00:40:57,859
and how they would be labeled

859
00:40:57,859 --> 00:40:59,899
as being guilty of these sins,

860
00:40:59,899 --> 00:41:02,379
and he says, listen, such were some of you.

861
00:41:03,619 --> 00:41:06,779
Listen, we sang this morning, and Dean picks the songs.

862
00:41:06,779 --> 00:41:08,739
I don't pick the songs.

863
00:41:08,739 --> 00:41:10,779
You know what we sang this morning?

864
00:41:10,779 --> 00:41:13,599
I'm only a sinner saved by grace.

865
00:41:14,459 --> 00:41:16,659
Saved, saved.

866
00:41:16,659 --> 00:41:18,959
Those are the two songs we sang this morning.

867
00:41:18,959 --> 00:41:20,659
Praise the Lord.

868
00:41:20,659 --> 00:41:21,739
I'm only a sinner.

869
00:41:21,739 --> 00:41:23,079
But such were some of you.

870
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:26,199
Listen, it's the grace of God.

871
00:41:27,279 --> 00:41:31,419
It's the grace of God, because the gospel converts.

872
00:41:31,419 --> 00:41:34,119
The law condemns, but the gospel converts.

873
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:36,799
We find we don't have time to look at Jeremiah 31,

874
00:41:36,799 --> 00:41:39,479
jot it down perhaps, verses 27 through 34,

875
00:41:39,479 --> 00:41:41,719
and you find about the new covenant that is mentioned,

876
00:41:41,719 --> 00:41:44,079
but I wanna look at Romans 8 just for a moment.

877
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:46,319
We mentioned Romans chapter number 7,

878
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:47,919
and we looked at that passage

879
00:41:47,919 --> 00:41:49,879
dealing with the law condemning,

880
00:41:49,879 --> 00:41:51,799
but I want you to see Romans chapter number 8,

881
00:41:51,799 --> 00:41:54,879
because the gospel converts.

882
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:56,519
When we look at Romans chapter number 8,

883
00:41:56,519 --> 00:41:59,119
in these first few verses of Romans chapter number 8,

884
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:02,279
God gives to us this beautiful truth

885
00:42:02,279 --> 00:42:07,159
with regard to this new position that we have in Christ.

886
00:42:07,159 --> 00:42:08,879
Notice, if you've been saved

887
00:42:08,879 --> 00:42:10,679
by the grace of God this morning,

888
00:42:10,679 --> 00:42:12,479
you know for sure that heaven's your home.

889
00:42:12,479 --> 00:42:13,599
It's not of your works.

890
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:15,199
There's nothing that you could do,

891
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:18,839
but you went to that humbly to the Lord Jesus Christ

892
00:42:18,839 --> 00:42:20,479
and accept him as your personal savior.

893
00:42:20,479 --> 00:42:22,439
Notice what the Bible says in verse number 8,

894
00:42:22,439 --> 00:42:24,439
excuse me, verse number 1 of Romans 8.

895
00:42:24,439 --> 00:42:29,439
There is therefore now no condemnation

896
00:42:30,039 --> 00:42:34,799
to them which are in Christ Jesus.

897
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:38,839
He that believeth not is condemned already.

898
00:42:38,839 --> 00:42:41,959
The law condemns, but if you're in Jesus Christ,

899
00:42:41,959 --> 00:42:43,079
what does it mean to be in Jesus Christ?

900
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:43,999
You've been saved.

901
00:42:43,999 --> 00:42:47,159
You've been born again by the grace of God.

902
00:42:47,159 --> 00:42:51,519
The Bible says there is therefore now no condemnation

903
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:53,159
to them which are in Christ Jesus

904
00:42:53,159 --> 00:42:55,799
who walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit

905
00:42:55,799 --> 00:42:59,999
for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus.

906
00:42:59,999 --> 00:43:01,319
Now, do you see that phrase,

907
00:43:01,319 --> 00:43:06,319
the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus?

908
00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:11,559
The gospel hath made me free from the law of sin and death.

909
00:43:14,519 --> 00:43:15,719
There's a new law,

910
00:43:15,719 --> 00:43:19,919
and it's the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus.

911
00:43:19,919 --> 00:43:21,279
Hallelujah.

912
00:43:21,279 --> 00:43:22,799
You read the book of Esther,

913
00:43:22,799 --> 00:43:26,279
and there was a writing, a law that was given

914
00:43:26,279 --> 00:43:28,279
that all the Jewish people were gonna be killed

915
00:43:28,279 --> 00:43:31,559
on a certain day, and after Mordecai, excuse me,

916
00:43:31,559 --> 00:43:34,839
after Haman had been exposed through Mordecai and Esther

917
00:43:34,839 --> 00:43:36,399
and all that had taken place,

918
00:43:36,399 --> 00:43:39,199
there was a question that was raised by King Ahasuerus

919
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:40,559
as to what you wanna do,

920
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:42,919
and he said, I wanna write a counter decree.

921
00:43:42,919 --> 00:43:45,039
See, they could not overturn the law

922
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:46,239
of the Medes and Persians.

923
00:43:46,239 --> 00:43:47,959
It was settled, it was solid,

924
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:50,759
but they could write a counter decree,

925
00:43:50,759 --> 00:43:53,759
and that counter decree was to be published

926
00:43:53,759 --> 00:43:56,919
throughout all the land, and they did it with haste.

927
00:43:56,919 --> 00:43:57,759
Why?

928
00:43:57,759 --> 00:43:59,319
Because there was a new law.

929
00:43:59,319 --> 00:44:02,319
There was a counter decree that they had to be made aware of,

930
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:04,559
and we see here in Romans chapter number eight,

931
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:08,459
the law, as he says, of sin and death, it condemns,

932
00:44:08,459 --> 00:44:11,839
but the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus

933
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:14,359
hath made me free.

934
00:44:15,879 --> 00:44:20,519
Glorious, the glorious gospel, the gospel converts.

935
00:44:22,359 --> 00:44:25,199
Notice verse three, for what the law, what does it say?

936
00:44:25,199 --> 00:44:27,219
Could not do.

937
00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:30,559
For what the law could not do,

938
00:44:30,559 --> 00:44:32,439
and that it was weak through the flesh,

939
00:44:32,439 --> 00:44:36,599
God, sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh

940
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:41,359
for, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh,

941
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:44,559
that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us

942
00:44:44,959 --> 00:44:49,279
to walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit.

943
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:51,619
Hallelujah for the gospel.

944
00:44:52,479 --> 00:44:55,119
We could look at other verses, Galatians five,

945
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:58,919
and verse number one, the Bible says very plainly there,

946
00:44:58,919 --> 00:45:00,999
again, writing to these that are dealing

947
00:45:00,999 --> 00:45:02,519
with the same false teaching,

948
00:45:02,519 --> 00:45:05,779
stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ

949
00:45:05,779 --> 00:45:08,959
hath made us free, and be not entangled again

950
00:45:08,959 --> 00:45:10,659
with the yoke of bondage.

951
00:45:12,199 --> 00:45:14,319
We read Hebrews 10, verses one through four,

952
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:15,919
we don't have time this morning

953
00:45:15,919 --> 00:45:18,839
to look at verses 11 and 12, and 19 and 20,

954
00:45:18,839 --> 00:45:20,759
but he talks about how this man,

955
00:45:20,759 --> 00:45:25,159
after one sacrifice for sin forever, sat down.

956
00:45:25,159 --> 00:45:25,999
Why?

957
00:45:25,999 --> 00:45:26,979
It's finished.

958
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:30,439
The Bible talks about this truth,

959
00:45:30,439 --> 00:45:33,159
and I'll mention it, look, in Hebrews chapter 10,

960
00:45:33,159 --> 00:45:36,519
in verses 19 and 20, the Bible gives us this truth

961
00:45:36,519 --> 00:45:39,579
with regard to this new and living way.

962
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:43,439
And I'm gonna wrap it up with this this morning.

963
00:45:44,479 --> 00:45:47,159
And I want us to rejoice.

964
00:45:47,159 --> 00:45:48,999
In Hebrews chapter 10, in verse 19,

965
00:45:48,999 --> 00:45:52,199
the Bible says, having therefore, brethren,

966
00:45:52,199 --> 00:45:57,199
boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus.

967
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:00,759
Notice what he says in verse 20 of Hebrews 10,

968
00:46:00,759 --> 00:46:05,759
by a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us

969
00:46:05,879 --> 00:46:10,559
through the veil, that is to say, his flesh.

970
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:12,759
Now, if you understand much of the book of Hebrews,

971
00:46:12,759 --> 00:46:14,519
and I'll try to say it quickly,

972
00:46:14,519 --> 00:46:17,319
but we find that we're told that we're to come boldly

973
00:46:17,319 --> 00:46:19,479
under the throne of grace in chapter number four.

974
00:46:19,479 --> 00:46:21,119
We find that in chapter number nine,

975
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:23,799
he begins to illustrate for us and help us

976
00:46:23,799 --> 00:46:28,359
to be reminded of the Old Testament day of atonement.

977
00:46:28,359 --> 00:46:30,439
And on once a year, on the day of atonement,

978
00:46:30,439 --> 00:46:33,559
the high priest, and only the high priest on that day,

979
00:46:33,559 --> 00:46:38,259
and only with blood, could enter into the holy of holies.

980
00:46:38,259 --> 00:46:40,999
The tabernacle and the temple, there was an outer court,

981
00:46:40,999 --> 00:46:42,479
and then there was the holy place,

982
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:44,519
and then there was the holy of holies,

983
00:46:44,519 --> 00:46:46,679
where was the ark of the covenant on the mercy seat,

984
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:49,159
and we find, or the mercy seat on the ark of the covenant,

985
00:46:49,159 --> 00:46:51,439
and we find that Hebrews chapter number nine

986
00:46:51,439 --> 00:46:53,519
begins to paint for us that picture,

987
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:55,639
and understand that the high priest

988
00:46:55,639 --> 00:46:58,559
only on that day could enter in.

989
00:46:59,439 --> 00:47:01,679
But now look at what he says in verse number 19,

990
00:47:01,679 --> 00:47:04,879
having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter

991
00:47:04,879 --> 00:47:07,599
into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,

992
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:11,539
by a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us

993
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:13,539
through the veil that is to say his flesh.

994
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:17,259
Do you remember when Jesus gave up his life,

995
00:47:17,259 --> 00:47:21,259
when he died on Calvary, the veil was rented to,

996
00:47:21,259 --> 00:47:23,899
providing for us the truth of access

997
00:47:23,899 --> 00:47:25,979
that we have through Jesus Christ.

998
00:47:25,979 --> 00:47:28,459
And turn back to second Corinthians chapter three,

999
00:47:28,459 --> 00:47:31,979
and notice as we finish up here with verses 17 and 18,

1000
00:47:31,979 --> 00:47:35,379
the Bible reveals to us this powerful truth

1001
00:47:35,379 --> 00:47:39,899
with regard to our access to God.

1002
00:47:39,899 --> 00:47:44,379
In verse 17, talking about those that have been converted

1003
00:47:44,379 --> 00:47:46,579
because of the truth of the gospel,

1004
00:47:46,579 --> 00:47:50,059
the Bible says this, now the Lord is that spirit,

1005
00:47:50,059 --> 00:47:54,259
and where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.

1006
00:47:54,259 --> 00:47:58,819
Verse 18, watch it, but we all, how many?

1007
00:47:58,819 --> 00:48:01,699
Well, he's talking about all those that are saved,

1008
00:48:01,699 --> 00:48:03,499
that are being converted.

1009
00:48:03,499 --> 00:48:08,219
But we all, with open face, beholding as in a glass

1010
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:13,059
the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image

1011
00:48:13,059 --> 00:48:18,059
from glory to glory, even as by the spirit of the Lord.

1012
00:48:19,699 --> 00:48:23,299
Who was allowed on the Mount in Exodus chapter 34?

1013
00:48:23,299 --> 00:48:28,299
Moses alone, no other man, just Moses.

1014
00:48:32,619 --> 00:48:36,099
But here we find that we all,

1015
00:48:36,099 --> 00:48:40,339
if you're saved this morning, you have direct access to God.

1016
00:48:40,339 --> 00:48:42,179
If you're saved this morning,

1017
00:48:42,179 --> 00:48:44,979
you can spend as much time with God as you want.

1018
00:48:44,979 --> 00:48:47,979
And really, I believe that what is being revealed to us

1019
00:48:47,979 --> 00:48:51,779
in verse 18 is the truth of sanctification,

1020
00:48:51,779 --> 00:48:54,259
that we're to be conformed to the image of Christ,

1021
00:48:54,259 --> 00:48:57,699
to the Romans 8, 29 talks about being conformed

1022
00:48:57,699 --> 00:49:00,380
to the image of his dear son, of the Lord Jesus Christ,

1023
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:04,500
and we find that we're changed from glory to glory.

1024
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,579
As it says there in verse number 18,

1025
00:49:06,579 --> 00:49:08,979
and that's through spending time with the Lord,

1026
00:49:08,979 --> 00:49:12,659
being in his presence, as Moses was in his presence

1027
00:49:12,659 --> 00:49:14,459
and it was evidenced in his life,

1028
00:49:14,459 --> 00:49:18,380
so too as we are in the presence of our Savior,

1029
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:20,059
that it's evidenced in our lives,

1030
00:49:20,059 --> 00:49:22,500
that process of sanctification.

1031
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:24,500
And here's the truth this morning.

1032
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:28,219
As we look at this contrast between the law and grace

1033
00:49:28,219 --> 00:49:30,139
and looking at 2 Corinthians 3

1034
00:49:30,139 --> 00:49:32,179
and all that God gives us,

1035
00:49:32,179 --> 00:49:33,739
I want you to understand this morning

1036
00:49:33,779 --> 00:49:35,899
that according to Galatians 3 and verse 24,

1037
00:49:35,899 --> 00:49:40,299
we read it a moment ago, the law brings us to Christ.

1038
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:44,500
But according to 2 Corinthians 3 and verse 18,

1039
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:47,859
grace makes us like Christ.

1040
00:49:48,779 --> 00:49:50,299
I want you to think about that just for a moment

1041
00:49:50,299 --> 00:49:52,139
as we close this morning.

1042
00:49:52,139 --> 00:49:57,139
The law, the purpose of the law is to bring us to Christ.

1043
00:49:57,179 --> 00:49:59,019
It condemns.

1044
00:49:59,019 --> 00:50:00,339
Life cannot come.

1045
00:50:00,339 --> 00:50:07,179
cannot do, it is weak. But it points us, it's the schoolmaster to bring us to Christ. How

1046
00:50:07,179 --> 00:50:11,779
did you know you were a sinner? Well, Paul says in Romans 7, I had not known sin except

1047
00:50:11,779 --> 00:50:20,499
for the law said, thou shalt not covet. But as we trust Christ as our Savior, it is the

1048
00:50:20,499 --> 00:50:28,939
grace of God that makes us like Christ. And what a glorious truth that is. They were called

1049
00:50:28,939 --> 00:50:34,859
Christians first in Antioch. Why? Because they were like Christ. This morning, if you're

1050
00:50:34,859 --> 00:50:39,839
not saved, if you don't know for sure that heaven is your home, today is the day of salvation.

1051
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:45,379
Do not delay. Trust Christ today. He said that whosoever shall call upon the name of

1052
00:50:45,379 --> 00:50:50,179
the Lord shall be saved. The gospel converts. He said, I've been trying to keep the law.

1053
00:50:50,179 --> 00:50:53,399
I've been trying to do all this stuff. I've been trying to do all these works. And like

1054
00:50:53,399 --> 00:50:57,179
I asked William two weeks, a week and a half ago, I said, but how do you know if you've

1055
00:50:57,179 --> 00:51:07,079
ever done enough? How do you ever know? Works cannot save us. The law cannot save us. If

1056
00:51:07,079 --> 00:51:12,679
you're not saved this morning, would you trust Christ as your Savior? Because the gospel

1057
00:51:12,679 --> 00:51:18,079
converts. What Jesus did on that cruel cross 2,000 years ago was to pay for your salvation

1058
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:22,719
and for my salvation. And He's the only way. There's no other way. No other name under

1059
00:51:22,719 --> 00:51:28,819
heaven given among men whereby we must be saved. If you're saved this morning, how much

1060
00:51:28,819 --> 00:51:34,639
time do you spend with Christ? That process of sanctification, being changed from glory

1061
00:51:34,639 --> 00:51:41,699
to glory, that we would be like Him. That we'd be like Him. That when others see us

1062
00:51:41,699 --> 00:51:48,939
as they saw Peter and John in Acts 4, they'd say, they've been with Jesus. They've been

1063
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:55,119
with Jesus. Oh, I'm so thankful for the glorious gospel, for the grace of God. Let's pray.

1064
00:51:55,119 --> 00:52:00,479
Father, we love You. We thank You for loving us. Thank You for Your Word this morning.

1065
00:52:00,479 --> 00:52:08,359
God, I pray that You would help us today to have a burden for those who are lost or condemned

1066
00:52:08,359 --> 00:52:18,159
by the law. Many that have been blinded, trying to work their way to heaven, keep some law,

1067
00:52:18,879 --> 00:52:26,879
Lord, I pray that we'd be burdened, that we would be faithful to give the glorious

1068
00:52:26,879 --> 00:52:34,059
gospel because it's the glorious gospel that converts. Holy Spirit, if there's one that's

1069
00:52:34,059 --> 00:52:39,759
not saved, would You please convict them of their sin and of Christ's righteousness and

1070
00:52:39,759 --> 00:52:44,039
of judgment to come. They'd come this morning and we'd be able to take a Bible and show

1071
00:52:44,039 --> 00:52:49,179
them for sure how they could know that heaven is their home. For every child of God, would

1072
00:52:49,179 --> 00:52:57,419
You help us to rejoice in our salvation? Would You help us to be concerned about our sanctification,

1073
00:52:57,419 --> 00:53:04,259
that we'd spend time in Your presence, that we might be like Thee? We thank You for the,

1074
00:53:04,259 --> 00:53:08,979
for Your grace. We thank You for the gospel. I pray that You'd move and work in lives as

1075
00:53:08,979 --> 00:53:13,259
only You can in this moment of invitation. For it's in Christ's name we pray. Would You

1076
00:53:13,279 --> 00:53:17,479
stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed. Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano

1077
00:53:17,479 --> 00:53:21,139
as she does. The altar's open. If you're not sure of heaven, we'd love to take a Bible

1078
00:53:21,139 --> 00:53:24,239
and show you how you could know for sure that heaven's your home. Maybe you just want to

1079
00:53:24,239 --> 00:53:30,179
come and thank God for the gospel. Maybe you want to come and recognize your need to spend

1080
00:53:30,179 --> 00:53:36,159
more time with Christ that you might be sanctified glory to glory. As Kimberly plays, the altar

1081
00:53:36,159 --> 00:53:36,799
is open.
