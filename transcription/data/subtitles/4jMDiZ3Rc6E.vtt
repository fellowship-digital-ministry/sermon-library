00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.800
But this week, just afresh and anew, God just really just opened some things to me from

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:14.199
this portion of Scripture, and I'm so thankful for the truth of God's Word.

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:19.200
I'm so thankful that God told us in His Word that His Word is truth.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.079
And I'm thankful for the freedom that we have in Christ.

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:28.159
And I'm thankful that we have the Old Testament and the New Testament, we have the whole canon

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:29.159
of Scripture.

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:32.279
Where would we be without a Bible?

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.279
And everything that you know to be true about God, everything that we know to be true about

00:00:36.279 --> 00:00:44.759
salvation we find in the pages of this precious book, and oh, how thankful I am for the Bible.

00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:50.080
In this third chapter of the book of 2 Corinthians, we find, really, that throughout the chapter,

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:55.599
there's this contrast that is being given to us, and it's a contrast between law and

00:00:55.599 --> 00:00:56.599
grace.

00:00:56.599 --> 00:00:59.000
A contrast between law and grace.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.279
The passage of Scripture takes us back to Moses and to the book of Exodus, and we understand

00:01:04.279 --> 00:01:09.919
that the Lord gave Moses the law, and the children of Israel lived under that system.

00:01:09.919 --> 00:01:16.339
But we find that we today are blessed as Paul is communicating to these believers in Corinth,

00:01:16.339 --> 00:01:21.360
we too are blessed to live in this era, as Romans 6 and verse 14 tells us, that we're

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.400
no longer under the law, but we're under grace.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.339
And I'm so thankful for that wonderful truth, I'm reminded, we'll look at a number of verses

00:01:30.339 --> 00:01:34.680
this morning, the law had a shadow of good things to come.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.739
And we see that in Hebrews chapter number 10, as we look through the portion of Scripture,

00:01:38.739 --> 00:01:42.839
we note that the law had a specific purpose.

00:01:42.839 --> 00:01:49.519
Indeed, the law, as is spoken of here in 2 Corinthians chapter number 3, was glorious.

00:01:49.519 --> 00:01:54.919
There was an aspect of glory with regard to the law and how God gave the law.

00:01:54.919 --> 00:01:58.860
The problem is that the law was limited.

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.440
The law could not give life.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.360
We find that there are some false teachers that were active during the time of Paul writing

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.119
the letter of 2 Corinthians, there were false teachers throughout the New Testament, the

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.880
entire book of Galatians that's written to those churches in the region of Galatia is

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:23.479
really written because of Judaizers and these false teachers that are trying to bring and

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:30.639
really mingle law and grace together and bring people back into bondage.

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:37.320
And we find this morning that the truth of God's word, that grace and the gospel, it

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.559
delivers and it delivers us from that bondage.

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:46.000
And I'm thankful this morning that as we have this portion of Scripture, I've titled the

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.740
message the glorious gospel.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:54.020
And I'm looking in verse number 1, do we begin again to commend ourselves or need we

00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:00.820
as some others epistles of commendation to you or letters of commendation from you?

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:08.979
Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men for as much as ye

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:15.860
are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:21.660
ink, but with the spirit of the living God, not in tables of stone, but in fleshly tables

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.139
of the heart.

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:27.020
In such trust have we through Christ to God word.

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:32.539
Verse number 5, it answered the question from our text last week in verse number 16 of chapter

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:37.419
2, not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves, but our

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:44.860
sufficiency is of God who also hath made us able ministers of the New Testament, not of

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.220
the letter, but of the spirit.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.619
For the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.

00:03:50.619 --> 00:03:54.059
We'll make our way through verse number 18 as we get through the message this morning.

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:57.860
But if you're taking notes, I want you to notice number 1, the law condemns.

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.339
The law condemns.

00:03:59.339 --> 00:04:02.779
We find that as we begin reading this portion of Scripture, and we'll get back to verses

00:04:02.779 --> 00:04:06.259
1 through 3 in just a few moments as we get through it.

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:11.179
But there were some people, of course, as we continue to trace the understanding of

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:15.899
really the setting as Paul is writing to the church in Corinth, and there were people that

00:04:15.899 --> 00:04:22.579
wanted some letters of commendation, and there were, you know, the credibility, if you will,

00:04:22.579 --> 00:04:23.579
of Paul's ministry.

00:04:23.579 --> 00:04:25.779
Well, Paul had served in Corinth.

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:30.100
God used Paul to see that church established, and people got saved.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:35.700
And Paul says that ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ, ministered by

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:36.700
us.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:43.299
And these letters of commendation or recommendation in your lives are the testimony that we need.

00:04:43.299 --> 00:04:49.820
But we get into the text, and we find that Paul begins to unfold for us and help us understand

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.079
that the law condemns.

00:04:52.079 --> 00:04:56.339
We find that as the apostle Paul is writing again to these individuals that are being

00:04:56.339 --> 00:05:02.100
influenced and impacted by these false teachers, these Judaizers as they've come to be known,

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.019
where they're seeking to mingle law and grace.

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:08.940
Okay, fine, you can have that, but you've got to have this as well.

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.500
And you find that in Acts chapter number 15, there's much discourse that is given to us

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:18.100
in Acts 15 with regard to the council at Jerusalem.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.459
And what were they saying?

00:05:19.459 --> 00:05:24.160
Well, unless you're circumcised after the manner of Moses, you cannot be saved.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:30.660
This is mingling grace and law, and we find that after much deliberation that they concluded

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:35.179
in Acts chapter number 15 that everyone is saved the same way.

00:05:35.179 --> 00:05:36.179
What is that way?

00:05:36.179 --> 00:05:37.179
It's Jesus.

00:05:37.179 --> 00:05:39.140
I am the way, the truth, and the life.

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.779
No man cometh unto the Father but by me.

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:44.480
We're all saved by grace through faith.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.119
You can't be saved by your works.

00:05:46.119 --> 00:05:48.179
You can't be saved by keeping the law.

00:05:48.179 --> 00:05:52.779
You can't be saved by being baptized, taking some kind of communion.

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:53.899
There's no other way.

00:05:53.899 --> 00:05:56.779
It's the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:05:56.779 --> 00:06:01.579
And what he did on the cross of Calvary, his substitutionary death and his glorious

00:06:01.579 --> 00:06:06.059
resurrection is the only way that mankind can get to heaven.

00:06:06.059 --> 00:06:10.339
And we find that it's declared this way in Acts 15 and verse number 11, but we believe

00:06:10.339 --> 00:06:17.880
that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, we shall be saved even as they.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.779
What a great declaration.

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:21.299
What a great truth.

00:06:21.299 --> 00:06:26.299
We go forth and we seek to share the gospel with individuals because we understand that

00:06:26.299 --> 00:06:27.420
the law condemns.

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:31.519
We understand there's one way to get to heaven and Jesus is that way.

00:06:31.519 --> 00:06:36.260
And we find that as we look at this portion of scripture and we see that the law condemns,

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:40.980
we read in verse number six already, he says, the letter killeth.

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:44.220
When he's speaking about the letter, he's referring to the law.

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:49.160
We see that contextually, we'll get through the verses and you'll find how that he specifically

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:54.660
goes back to Moses in the book of Exodus and receiving the law and all that takes place.

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:59.940
And we find that he says, the letter killeth, but notice, he says, the spirit giveth life.

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:04.299
But as we deal with the subject of the law condemning, we see in verse six, the letter

00:07:04.299 --> 00:07:05.299
killeth.

00:07:05.299 --> 00:07:10.980
Notice in verse number nine, the Bible says, for if the ministration of condemnation be

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:11.980
glory.

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:17.459
So notice what he refers to the law, how he refers to the law in verse number nine, the

00:07:17.459 --> 00:07:21.420
ministration, notice, of condemnation.

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:24.119
The law condemns.

00:07:24.119 --> 00:07:25.119
The law condemns.

00:07:25.119 --> 00:07:29.559
I spoke to somebody last Saturday, not yesterday, a week ago yesterday, and William was his

00:07:29.559 --> 00:07:32.239
name and I began to talk to him and I asked him if he knew for sure that he was going

00:07:32.239 --> 00:07:33.239
to heaven.

00:07:33.239 --> 00:07:37.279
And he said, well, I hope so, and so on and so forth, and I asked him what he was trusting

00:07:37.279 --> 00:07:41.239
and he's like, well, you know, I try to keep the Ten Commandments.

00:07:41.239 --> 00:07:42.760
Really?

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.720
You try to keep the Ten Commandments?

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:49.720
And the sad thing is most people that would say that don't even know the Ten Commandments.

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:55.399
Furthermore, they don't know that there's a whole lot more to the law than Ten Commandments.

00:07:55.399 --> 00:07:58.839
The law is much broader than just the Ten Commandments.

00:07:58.839 --> 00:08:02.959
It's a starting point, but the reality is that the law condemns.

00:08:02.959 --> 00:08:05.000
You begin to go through the law.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.640
I asked him some questions.

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:08.760
I said, well, you know, the law says thou shalt not kill.

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:09.760
Have you ever killed anyone?

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:10.760
No.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:15.519
Well, you know, Jesus said that if you hate somebody, it's like killing them.

00:08:15.519 --> 00:08:19.079
See, Jesus took it a step further, did he not?

00:08:19.079 --> 00:08:20.559
I said, have you ever committed adultery?

00:08:20.559 --> 00:08:24.760
The Bible tells us that the law says thou shalt not commit adultery, right?

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:25.760
And he says, no.

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:29.000
And I said, well, if you looked at a woman to have lust after her, you've committed it

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.239
already in your heart.

00:08:31.239 --> 00:08:33.919
Have you ever lied?

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:36.599
And he kind of just froze.

00:08:36.599 --> 00:08:38.599
Thou shalt not bear false witness.

00:08:38.599 --> 00:08:39.640
You know what the Bible tells us?

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:41.320
All men are liars.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.200
The Bible tells us that.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:47.340
And we find that the law, it condemns.

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:49.340
We find that the letter killeth.

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:54.260
It's the ministration, as Paul refers to it, of condemnation.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:09:00.619
We're reminded that God, the Lord Jesus Christ, uses that terminology in John chapter number

00:09:00.619 --> 00:09:01.619
three.

00:09:01.619 --> 00:09:06.059
And he talks about God sent not a son into the world to condemn the world, but the world

00:09:06.059 --> 00:09:07.700
through him might be saved.

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:08.700
Why?

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:12.140
Because through Jesus, he fulfilled the law and he brings grace.

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:18.179
But we find that the Bible tells us that we're condemned already if we don't believe.

00:09:18.179 --> 00:09:23.219
And so we understand that we look through, in verse 18 of John three, he that believeth

00:09:23.219 --> 00:09:27.979
on him is not condemned, but he that believeth not is condemned already.

00:09:27.979 --> 00:09:30.780
It's very plain.

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:33.219
The Old Testament, the law, it killeth.

00:09:33.219 --> 00:09:35.059
It's the ministration of condemnation.

00:09:35.059 --> 00:09:40.299
Notice, furthermore, not only does the law condemn, but we find that the law is temporary.

00:09:40.299 --> 00:09:44.260
We find that in verse number seven, the Bible says of the ministration of death.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:45.739
Notice how he refers to it there.

00:09:45.739 --> 00:09:51.099
The ministration of death written and engraven in stones was glorious so that the children

00:09:51.099 --> 00:09:56.559
of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance.

00:09:56.559 --> 00:10:00.020
Notice this, which glory was to be done away.

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:03.940
We see in verse seven that phrase to end the verse,

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:05.540
which glory was to be done away.

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:06.420
It was temporary.

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:09.980
The law was never intended to be permanent.

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:12.180
It was a shadow of good things to come.

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:14.100
As we see in Hebrews chapter number 10,

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:15.780
we find that it was temporary.

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:16.940
It was fading away.

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:18.260
It was to be done away.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.420
We see in verse number 11, the Bible says,

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:23.460
for if that which is done away was glorious,

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:25.740
much more that which remaineth is glorious.

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:27.660
We find in verse number 13,

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:31.020
and not as Moses, which put a veil over his face,

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:33.620
that the children of Israel could not steadfastly look

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:36.980
to the end of that, which is abolished.

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:39.300
And so we see these three verses of scripture

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.940
in verse seven, in verse 11, in verse 13,

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:44.640
that make reference to the fact that the law,

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:47.620
yes, it condemns, but it was also temporary.

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:50.740
It had glory, but that glory was to be done away.

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:53.740
And we find that it would be abolished.

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:57.060
We find that here as Paul is writing again

00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:59.540
to individuals that are being confronted

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:02.700
with this idea of the importance of keeping the law

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:05.580
and this mingling and all that was going on

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:08.540
that Paul very plainly is going to bring

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:11.600
to the attention of these believers and to us today

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.140
that, listen, the law had its purpose,

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:18.280
but the law condemns, and the law cannot bring life.

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:19.940
The law was temporary.

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:22.460
Notice it was a fading glory.

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:23.980
We noticed in verse number seven,

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:26.060
it says that the glory was to be done away,

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:28.860
and it refers to Moses, and I mentioned

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:31.180
that it takes us back to the book of Exodus,

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:34.860
but notice specifically in verses 13 through 16

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:39.560
how the apostle Paul begins to really give further insight

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:41.740
with regard to this historical event

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:43.100
from the book of Exodus.

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:46.540
Notice in verse 13, and not as Moses,

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:48.260
which put a veil over his face

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.660
that the children of Israel could not steadfastly look

00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:52.880
to the end of that which is abolished,

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:57.400
but their minds were blinded for until this day

00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:00.000
remaineth the same veil untaken away

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.800
in the reading of the Old Testament,

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:05.460
which veil is done away in Christ,

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:08.840
but even unto this day when Moses is read,

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:11.960
the veil is upon their heart.

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:12.940
Who's he talking about?

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:14.520
He's speaking about the children of Israel,

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:17.960
the nation of Israel specifically, and this blindness.

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.040
Remember in the Gospel of John

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:22.760
when Jesus healed the man that was born blind

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:25.120
and there's all kinds of stirring that takes place

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.440
and the religious leaders at the end of the text,

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:32.080
they say this in John nine, are we blind also?

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:35.320
And the sad reality is that they could see physically,

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:37.760
but they were blind spiritually.

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:40.240
In fact, as we come to 2 Corinthians chapter four

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:41.680
as we deal with it next week,

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:44.120
the Bible talks about how the God of this world

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:48.040
hath blinded the minds of them which believe not.

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:50.680
That's spiritual blindness.

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:52.120
What does the enemy use

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:54.480
to cause people to be blind spiritually?

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:57.580
Well, for the nation of Israel, it's the law,

00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:00.400
and they're still stuck in this process

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:03.800
of looking at the law and they still have this veil.

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.800
He says unto this day.

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:07.400
This was written in the first century,

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:09.640
but can I share with you this morning

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:13.960
that it's true even unto this day in 2025

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:17.400
that there is spiritual blindness that has happened

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:19.400
on the part of the nation of Israel.

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:22.360
It does not mean that God is done with Israel.

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:26.600
It simply means that because of their rejection of Messiah,

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:29.320
that there's this spiritual blindness,

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:31.700
and we as the Gentiles have been grafted in.

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:32.960
What a blessing.

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:35.560
And we could get into so many portions of scripture

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:38.020
this morning and look at all of that truth,

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:40.060
the book of Hebrews, the book of Romans,

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:45.060
but we find that the spiritual blindness is still present.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:46.460
It breaks my heart.

00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:48.200
I had a conversation personally

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:49.800
with someone this past week

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:51.800
that would have this perspective

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:55.880
of Jewish tradition and what have you,

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:58.380
and they were talking about how they try so hard

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:02.400
to keep the law, and it just broke my heart.

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:03.240
Why?

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.680
Because they can't keep the law.

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:07.720
And the reality is that they,

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:11.360
even in telling me that they were trying to keep the law,

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:14.180
were actually breaking the law

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:17.040
while telling me they were keeping the law

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:21.760
and made justification for breaking the law.

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:22.600
It's sad.

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.200
It grieves my heart.

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:28.740
Because the law condemns.

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:31.820
The law condemns.

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:33.640
We find that in verse 16, it says,

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:35.400
"'Nevertheless, when it,'

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:38.500
that's referring to the heart back in verse 15,

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:40.320
"'that the veil is upon their heart,

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:43.360
"'nevertheless, when it shall turn to the Lord,

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:46.640
"'the veil shall be taken away.'"

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:47.640
You know, it's amazing.

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:50.600
There are Jewish people that are saved today,

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:51.560
that have been saved.

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:54.400
Listen, Paul was Jewish, amen?

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:55.600
There's no contradiction,

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.920
there's no argument over Paul being Jewish,

00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:59.320
and there are many others

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:00.920
that we read throughout the scriptures.

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:03.000
Yes, there were many Jews that rejected

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.600
and he turned to the Gentiles,

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:08.400
but there are Jewish people today that still get saved.

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:11.720
They have to be saved the same way we have to be saved.

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:14.040
They're not saved because they're Jewish.

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:15.960
There's some false teaching out there.

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:20.040
In fact, there's some prominent TV preachers

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:21.880
that are prominent that say,

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:23.840
"'If you're Jewish, you're just going to heaven,'

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.680
that's wrong, that's a lie.

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:28.720
That is not what the Bible teaches.

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:32.360
No one is going to heaven because of their ancestry.

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:35.080
You only get to heaven by trusting Jesus Christ

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:36.760
as your personal savior,

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:38.560
and we find that that is true.

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:39.840
And here's the amazing thing,

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:41.080
when it says in verse 16,

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:43.360
and you can read testimonies of this today,

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:45.040
that it says, "'Nevertheless, when it,'

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:46.800
"'the heart shall turn to the Lord,'

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:48.280
"'the veil shall be taken away.'"

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:52.640
I have read testimonies after testimonies of Jewish people

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:54.840
that after they trust Christ as their savior,

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:58.440
it's like they say, it's like the scales came off.

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:01.120
It's like there was a veil taken away.

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:03.280
It's what the Bible says.

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:07.000
And there's no longer that blindness that takes place.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.280
And so we find that Paul is referring back

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:11.400
to this account in Exodus.

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:12.320
Notice with me, if you will,

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:13.920
turn back to Exodus 34,

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:15.600
very quickly this morning,

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.400
and I want you to see what Paul is referring to,

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:20.280
and you're no doubt familiar with it.

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:23.000
He's not talking about the giving of the 10 Commandments

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.840
the first time in chapter 20.

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:28.480
He's looking at the covenant renewed really in chapter 34.

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:30.360
Now you remember that in between,

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:33.280
after Moses comes down after Exodus 20

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:35.200
and the receiving of the 10 Commandments,

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.280
what does he find?

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:38.240
Well, the people say we're gonna obey,

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:40.440
and then shortly thereafter, they disobey.

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:42.080
They break the law.

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:46.240
Exodus chapter 32 is a very terrible passage of Scripture

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:49.240
in which you read of the golden calf

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:50.680
and all that takes place.

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:52.840
And so God calls Moses back up.

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:55.320
Notice in chapter 34 in verse number one,

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:57.080
the Bible says, and the Lord said unto Moses,

00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:59.760
hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first.

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:00.880
What happened to the first?

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:01.800
Well, they were broken.

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:02.640
Why?

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:03.960
Because he comes down off the mountain,

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:05.360
he sees all that's taking place,

00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:07.400
and they're broken.

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:10.240
And we find that not only were they broken physically,

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:11.680
but it was representative of the fact

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:14.680
that they had broken the law through their sin.

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:19.160
And we find that he says, and I will write unto thee,

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:21.480
write upon these tables the words

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:24.960
that were in the first tables which thou breakest.

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:28.480
Now understand with me that God is able

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.680
to preserve his word.

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:33.200
This passage of Scripture, I'm not gonna go down

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:36.320
and deal with Bible preservation specifically from here,

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:37.200
but you can look here.

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:39.480
You can look at Jeremiah when they took the pen knife

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:40.800
and they threw it in the fire,

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:41.640
and guess what?

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:43.640
God is able to preserve his word.

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:45.640
Though man tries to destroy it,

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:48.280
God has promised to preserve it.

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:49.960
And we can rejoice in that.

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:51.840
And he says, and be ready in the morning,

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:54.640
and come up in the morning unto Mount Sinai,

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:58.720
and present thyself, singular,

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:01.120
there to me in the top of the mount.

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:03.200
And no man shall come up with thee,

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:05.880
neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount,

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:09.840
neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount.

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:12.920
And so we find that God gives very specific instruction.

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:14.840
Now remember these three verses.

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:17.600
We're not on time to read the entirety of chapter 34,

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:19.400
but we find that Moses goes up

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:21.600
as he had been instructed to do so.

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:24.920
In verse eight it says, and Moses made haste

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:27.800
and bowed his head toward the earth and worshiped.

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:32.320
We find that God is going to give him truth.

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:33.800
He's going to deal with that.

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:36.239
Notice in verse 29, let's pick it up at the end.

00:18:36.239 --> 00:18:38.800
In verse 29, the Bible says, and it came to pass

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:42.400
when Moses came down from Mount Sinai

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:45.760
with the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand,

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.280
when he came down from the mount,

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:52.280
that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:54.679
while he talked with him.

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:56.840
Isn't that awesome?

00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:00.440
I mean, his face was shining

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:04.239
because he had been in the presence of God.

00:19:04.239 --> 00:19:05.080
You know, there's something true

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:06.880
about this for us this morning.

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:08.119
When you're in the presence of God,

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:09.800
you can see what other people can tell.

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:12.119
You know what the Bible says?

00:19:12.119 --> 00:19:13.960
Listen, it might not be that your face shines

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:17.559
the way that Moses' face shined here in Exodus chapter 34.

00:19:17.559 --> 00:19:19.880
But do you remember what the religious leader said

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:21.160
in Acts chapter number four,

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:24.880
when they deal with Peter and John and they say,

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:27.800
these are ignorant and unlearned men?

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:32.119
But they had been with Jesus.

00:19:32.119 --> 00:19:33.679
That's what the Bible tells us.

00:19:33.679 --> 00:19:36.000
And listen, when you spend time with Jesus,

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.280
it's evident to other people.

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:40.119
You ever notice on somebody's countenance,

00:19:40.119 --> 00:19:42.840
you can see, if you know someone well enough,

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:46.440
you can see on their countenance whether something's wrong

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:48.559
or whether something's good.

00:19:48.559 --> 00:19:49.400
Amen?

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:50.220
You've been married long enough,

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:51.800
I can look at Holly, she can walk in a room

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:53.160
and I say, honey, are you okay?

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:54.200
What's wrong?

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:55.040
Nothing.

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:56.119
Hold on a minute.

00:19:56.119 --> 00:19:57.800
You ever do this with your spouse?

00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:58.800
Hold on a minute.

00:19:58.800 --> 00:19:59.960
You're telling me nothing,

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.840
your face is telling me something different.

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:04.360
Our countenance.

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:08.360
And his face was shining.

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:09.200
Why?

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:11.280
Because he'd been in the presence of God.

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:14.480
Psalm 16, and his presence is fullness of joy.

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:19.320
Notice it was only Moses that could go to that mount.

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:22.240
Thyself, no man with thee.

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:24.520
Remember that, it's important.

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:26.000
Verse 29, verse 30,

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.720
and when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses,

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:31.920
behold, the skin of his face shone,

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:34.280
and they were afraid to come nigh him.

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:35.360
I guess so.

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:37.960
Notice in verse 31,

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:39.320
and Moses called unto them,

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:41.200
and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:43.280
returned unto him, and Moses talked with them.

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:45.720
And afterward, all the children of Israel came nigh,

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:48.120
and he gave them in commandment

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:51.720
all that the Lord had spoken with him in Mount Sinai.

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:54.240
Until Moses had done speaking with them,

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:57.440
notice he put a veil on his face.

00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:00.320
But when Moses went in before the Lord to speak with him,

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:03.000
he took the veil off until he came out,

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.440
and he came out and spake unto the children of Israel

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:08.200
that which he was commanded.

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.920
And so we find that verse 35,

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:11.840
and the children of Israel saw the face of Moses,

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:14.000
that the skin of Moses' face shone,

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.680
and Moses put the veil upon his face again

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:19.240
until he went in to speak with him.

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:23.080
It's important to recognize that Moses,

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:27.240
his face did not shine until the day of his death.

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:29.400
It was a fading glory.

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:33.080
He really, as you look at 2 Corinthians 3,

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:34.640
it seems as if Paul, again,

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:37.440
the idea and the teaching of progressive revelation,

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:39.280
that Paul is helping us understand

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:41.600
something about Exodus 34

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:43.440
that we may not find contextually,

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:45.560
specifically there at the first read,

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:48.480
but it seems as if Moses is putting this veil on

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:50.720
because this glory would fade.

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:54.760
And as the glory would fade,

00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:57.480
it would not be visible to the other people,

00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:00.680
the children of Israel, that the glory was fading,

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:02.960
but it was representative of the fact,

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:05.400
as we talk about the law specifically,

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:07.720
which glory was to be done away.

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:10.280
We find that, again, the law has purpose.

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:12.200
Look at Romans chapter number seven.

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:15.080
The law condemns, but understand this morning

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:17.360
that we cannot throw the law out

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:19.040
just because the law condemns,

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:20.480
because there is a purpose.

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:23.160
God, he doeth all things well.

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:24.120
He has a perfect plan.

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:26.720
He is the eternal God.

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:29.600
He is the one that knows the end from the beginning,

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:32.000
and he gave the law and he gave it with purpose.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.880
In Romans chapter number seven,

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:35.880
we do not have time to read the entirety,

00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:38.640
but look at verse number seven down through verse 14 with me

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:40.280
and notice what the Bible says.

00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:42.520
What shall we say then?

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:44.240
Is the law sin?

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:46.440
God forbid, nay.

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:47.360
Notice what Paul says.

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:48.680
This is his testimony.

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:53.120
I had not known sin, but by the law.

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:57.480
For I had not known lust, except the law had said,

00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:00.680
thou shalt not covet.

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:02.200
So do you understand what Paul's saying?

00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:05.040
Because the law exists, it reveals,

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:07.920
it shows me that I'm a sinner.

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:10.360
It reveals that.

00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:12.880
But sin, taking occasion by the commandment,

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:15.480
wrought in me all manner of concupiscence,

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:17.880
for without the law, sin was dead.

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:19.760
For I was alive without the law once,

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:23.600
but when the commandment came, sin revived and I died.

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:26.320
The commandment, which was ordained to life,

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:28.280
I found to be unto death.

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:30.600
For sin, taking occasion by the commandment,

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:33.640
deceived me and by it slew me.

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:36.760
Wherefore, the law is holy and the commandment holy

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:38.080
and just and good.

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:41.960
Verse 13, was then that which is good made death unto me?

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:45.760
God forbid, but sin, that it might appear sin,

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:48.800
working death in me by that which is good,

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:51.780
that sin by the commandment might become,

00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:55.440
notice, exceeding sinful.

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:57.580
For we know that the law is spiritual,

00:23:57.580 --> 00:24:00.700
but I am carnal, sold under sin.

00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:01.960
What is Paul saying?

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:05.100
He's saying that the law has a purpose.

00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:08.600
The law reveals that we are sinners.

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:10.540
No law, how do we know?

00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:11.380
See, that's the problem.

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:13.620
When you remove law, you have anarchy,

00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:15.980
but you have a situation where every man doeth that

00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:17.820
which is right in his own sight.

00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:20.100
How can you tell me that what I'm doing is wrong

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:22.740
if there's no standard, if there's no law?

00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:27.740
God gave the law and by it, mankind is condemned.

00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:30.140
Notice in Galatians chapter three,

00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:32.060
Galatians chapter number three,

00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:34.540
and it would be worth mentioning

00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:36.020
as we look at the book of Galatians,

00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:37.940
again, as I said by way of introduction,

00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:40.340
that Paul is dealing with this situation

00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:42.900
with the Judaizers throughout the entirety

00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:44.580
of the book of Galatians.

00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:48.020
But notice specifically in the third chapter in verse 21,

00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:53.300
the Bible says this in Galatians three in verse 21,

00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:56.380
is the law then against the promises of God?

00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:58.060
God forbid.

00:24:58.060 --> 00:24:59.700
For if there had been a law given

00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:01.900
which could have given life,

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:05.620
verily righteousness should have been by the law.

00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:06.460
But you know what?

00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:08.300
There's no law that can give life

00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:12.120
because the law condemns, the letter killeth.

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:14.280
Verse 22, but the scripture hath concluded,

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:19.080
all under sin, that the promise by faith

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:24.080
of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:26.040
But before faith came, verse 23,

00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:28.440
we were kept under the law,

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:32.800
shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed,

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:37.160
wherefore the law was our schoolmaster

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:40.160
to bring us unto Christ,

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:44.520
that we might be justified by faith.

00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:47.200
This is a beautiful truth that God gives us here

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:48.660
in Galatians chapter number three.

00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:53.160
The law, it cannot save me, it cannot give me life.

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:54.720
No matter how many people say,

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:56.480
I'm trying to keep the law, I'm trying to keep the law,

00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:01.000
it can never give life because the law condemns.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000
But what the law does is it reveals that I'm a sinner

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.440
and it leads me, it points me to Christ,

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:09.720
the one who can give life.

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:15.320
The term is used, our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ.

00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:19.640
Notice in chapter two of Galatians in verse 21,

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:23.000
Paul says, I do not frustrate the grace of God,

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.440
for if righteousness come by the law,

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:28.560
then Christ is dead in vain.

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:33.220
Jesus did not die in vain.

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:38.140
His death was prophesied.

00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:42.820
His death was a substitutionary atonement.

00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:46.300
His death, of course, followed by his glorious resurrection

00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:49.800
is the only way by which mankind can be redeemed.

00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:52.300
His death was not in vain.

00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:54.740
And yet there are people today

00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:58.540
that are still trying to do works to get to heaven.

00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:02.620
There are still today denominations

00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:06.220
and churches all across the land,

00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:08.240
all across the world that are teaching

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:12.100
that you have to do and do and do in order to be saved.

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:14.180
And you know why that's so appealing?

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:18.320
Because our flesh is merit driven.

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:21.360
Our flesh is merit driven.

00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:27.980
And so I wanna feel like I did something to earn something.

00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:32.300
The reality is I come to Christ and say,

00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:35.380
I'm nothing and I have nothing to bring, nothing to offer.

00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:38.140
I am a sinner that is guilty,

00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:41.380
that deserves the lake of fire.

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:45.580
But you loved me and you died for me.

00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:49.620
And you offer to me the gift of God, which is eternal life.

00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:51.740
I can't work for it, you can't work for it,

00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:53.060
no one can work for it.

00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:56.500
But the false teachers continue today

00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:59.940
to teach a works-based salvation

00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:03.140
because it's so appealing to the flesh.

00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:07.100
But it rejects the truth of God's word.

00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:10.100
And here's the reality, there are people

00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:11.780
that take it another step and say,

00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:13.920
okay, well you can't be saved by your works,

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:16.340
but you have to do works to stay saved.

00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:19.340
I can't earn it and I can't keep it,

00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:22.400
and I'm so thankful that I'm kept by the power of God.

00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:26.280
And we find Hebrews 10, I referenced it a moment ago,

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:27.980
but look there with me quickly.

00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:31.420
In Hebrews chapter 10, in verses one through four,

00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:34.100
and we'll reference this passage again in just a moment,

00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:36.980
but we find in Hebrews 10 in verses one through four,

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:38.640
the Bible says this.

00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:43.860
Notice in verse number one,

00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:48.460
for the law, having a shadow of good things to come,

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:50.580
and not the very image of the things,

00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:53.280
can never, with those sacrifices

00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:56.460
which they offered year by year continually,

00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:59.340
make the comers thereunto perfect.

00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:02.140
For then would they not have ceased to be offered?

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:04.500
I mean, that's a valid question, is it not?

00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:08.220
I mean, if it could accomplish what they were teaching,

00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:11.420
that it could accomplish, if it could do that,

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:14.240
then there'd be no reason to continue offering.

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:17.220
But he says this, because that the worshipers once purged

00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:19.720
should have laid no more conscience of sins.

00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:22.900
But the problem is that it could not.

00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:24.980
Notice verse three, but in those sacrifices,

00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:27.700
there's a remembrance again made of sin every year,

00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:31.460
for it is not possible that the blood of bulls

00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:35.420
and of goats should take away sins.

00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:36.700
What did it do?

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:38.940
It pointed to Jesus, the Messiah.

00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:43.700
All of that sacrificial system in the Old Testament,

00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:46.460
all that was taking place from the garden

00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:51.220
when Adam and Eve sinned and an animal had to be sacrificed,

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:53.400
I believe a lamb had to be sacrificed

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:56.660
in order to provide the covering of skin,

00:29:56.660 --> 00:30:00.179
blood was shed, you think about the situation.

00:30:00.179 --> 00:30:03.379
with Abraham and Isaac, and God said,

00:30:03.379 --> 00:30:07.119
I will provide myself a lamb, a substitute.

00:30:07.119 --> 00:30:09.179
We find that you look at the Passover

00:30:09.179 --> 00:30:10.659
and you go over and over,

00:30:10.659 --> 00:30:13.159
and it's blood and it's blood and it's blood.

00:30:13.159 --> 00:30:13.999
Why?

00:30:13.999 --> 00:30:16.199
Because it pointed to Messiah,

00:30:16.199 --> 00:30:19.299
who would one day come and shed his precious blood

00:30:19.299 --> 00:30:21.899
for the sin of the world.

00:30:23.239 --> 00:30:24.239
The law.

00:30:26.199 --> 00:30:29.879
Paul says very plainly in 2 Corinthians 3,

00:30:30.139 --> 00:30:31.739
it condemns.

00:30:31.739 --> 00:30:35.719
It's temporary, has a fading glory.

00:30:35.719 --> 00:30:37.679
It had a purpose.

00:30:37.679 --> 00:30:41.959
But we find this morning that the law condemns.

00:30:41.959 --> 00:30:43.459
The contrast, I told you,

00:30:43.459 --> 00:30:45.399
that's found in 2 Corinthians 3,

00:30:45.399 --> 00:30:47.759
as you turn back there throughout the chapters,

00:30:47.759 --> 00:30:51.839
there's this contrast between law and grace.

00:30:51.839 --> 00:30:53.039
Law and grace.

00:30:53.039 --> 00:30:56.139
The letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.

00:30:56.139 --> 00:30:59.539
And we find that this chapter provides this contrast,

00:31:00.399 --> 00:31:02.199
and if we were to look at the passage,

00:31:02.199 --> 00:31:03.779
we would say, number one, this morning,

00:31:03.779 --> 00:31:06.639
that the law condemns, but number two this morning,

00:31:06.639 --> 00:31:09.019
the gospel converts.

00:31:09.019 --> 00:31:11.319
What is the gospel?

00:31:11.319 --> 00:31:13.319
Well, Paul answers that question

00:31:13.319 --> 00:31:15.819
in 1 Corinthians 15, verses three and four.

00:31:15.819 --> 00:31:17.679
It's the death, burial, and resurrection.

00:31:17.679 --> 00:31:19.719
In that passage, he says repeatedly,

00:31:19.719 --> 00:31:22.159
according to the scriptures.

00:31:22.159 --> 00:31:24.899
And I love that he uses that phraseology, why?

00:31:24.899 --> 00:31:28.259
Because he's referring to the Old Testament scriptures.

00:31:28.259 --> 00:31:31.359
He's saying he died according to the scriptures.

00:31:31.359 --> 00:31:33.099
He was buried according to the scriptures.

00:31:33.099 --> 00:31:35.259
He rose again according to the scriptures.

00:31:35.259 --> 00:31:37.159
And what a blessing to understand

00:31:37.159 --> 00:31:40.359
that God always does what he says he will do.

00:31:40.359 --> 00:31:43.159
And we find this morning that the gospel converts.

00:31:43.159 --> 00:31:47.039
It's the good news of Jesus Christ,

00:31:47.039 --> 00:31:50.199
that Jesus is the only Savior,

00:31:50.199 --> 00:31:53.779
that he died and he was buried and he rose again.

00:31:53.779 --> 00:31:57.479
And this is the message in which we are called to deliver.

00:31:57.499 --> 00:32:00.819
I shared with you that I said to that Amazon driver

00:32:00.819 --> 00:32:03.759
the other day, I said, you're delivering the packages

00:32:03.759 --> 00:32:05.299
and I'm delivering the gospel.

00:32:05.299 --> 00:32:07.059
And he said, man, I love the gospel.

00:32:07.059 --> 00:32:08.659
And I got to chat with him just for a moment.

00:32:08.659 --> 00:32:11.219
But the reality is that we, Paul said,

00:32:11.219 --> 00:32:14.359
I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, why?

00:32:14.359 --> 00:32:17.239
For it is the power of God unto salvation.

00:32:17.239 --> 00:32:19.539
The gospel converts this morning.

00:32:19.539 --> 00:32:22.259
The law condemns, but the gospel converts.

00:32:22.259 --> 00:32:25.779
In verse six, the Bible says the spirit giveth life.

00:32:25.779 --> 00:32:27.839
Notice with me in verse number eight,

00:32:27.839 --> 00:32:29.559
it's verse number nine, excuse me.

00:32:29.559 --> 00:32:32.399
It uses the ministration of condemnation,

00:32:32.399 --> 00:32:35.519
speaking about the law, but notice what it says.

00:32:35.519 --> 00:32:40.519
Much more doth the ministration, notice this,

00:32:40.559 --> 00:32:45.439
of righteousness exceed in glory.

00:32:45.439 --> 00:32:48.219
The ministration, as he mentions in verse number nine,

00:32:48.219 --> 00:32:50.199
of condemnation be glory.

00:32:50.199 --> 00:32:51.379
Why is he saying that?

00:32:51.379 --> 00:32:54.679
Well, because of Exodus 34 and what we read a moment ago.

00:32:54.699 --> 00:32:56.219
But then the contrast,

00:32:56.219 --> 00:32:58.519
the ministration of condemnation be glory.

00:32:58.519 --> 00:33:03.519
Much more doth the ministration of righteousness

00:33:03.859 --> 00:33:06.699
exceed in glory.

00:33:06.699 --> 00:33:09.379
Begin to think about this ministration of righteousness

00:33:09.379 --> 00:33:12.299
and understanding that in just a couple of chapters here

00:33:12.299 --> 00:33:13.779
in the book of 2 Corinthians,

00:33:13.779 --> 00:33:16.579
that Paul will write that great verse of scripture

00:33:16.579 --> 00:33:18.539
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

00:33:18.539 --> 00:33:21.399
that God hath made him Jesus to be sin for us

00:33:21.399 --> 00:33:22.619
who knew no sin,

00:33:22.619 --> 00:33:27.619
that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.

00:33:28.179 --> 00:33:29.839
Oh, it's glorious.

00:33:29.839 --> 00:33:31.299
It converts.

00:33:31.299 --> 00:33:34.799
We find that this new way, if you will,

00:33:34.799 --> 00:33:36.439
this glorious gospel,

00:33:36.439 --> 00:33:38.819
as Paul was talking about this ministry,

00:33:38.819 --> 00:33:40.799
remember we mentioned last week

00:33:40.799 --> 00:33:44.439
that as Paul mentions about Titus and his trip

00:33:44.439 --> 00:33:47.479
and he was not able to find Titus when he came to Troas,

00:33:47.479 --> 00:33:51.000
that introducing in chapter number two

00:33:51.639 --> 00:33:54.119
and all the way really through chapter number six,

00:33:54.119 --> 00:33:57.279
he talks about this ministry that we've been given.

00:33:58.359 --> 00:34:00.159
And here in chapter number three,

00:34:00.159 --> 00:34:02.839
he's talking about the glorious gospel,

00:34:02.839 --> 00:34:05.619
this new way and it excels in glory.

00:34:05.619 --> 00:34:08.079
Notice in verse number nine, it says this,

00:34:08.079 --> 00:34:10.519
for the ministration of condemnation be glory,

00:34:10.519 --> 00:34:12.959
much more doth the ministration of righteousness,

00:34:12.959 --> 00:34:15.659
notice, exceed in glory.

00:34:15.659 --> 00:34:19.000
Verse 10, for even that which was made glorious

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.839
had no glory in this respect

00:34:21.839 --> 00:34:25.160
by reason of the glory that exceleth.

00:34:27.239 --> 00:34:29.639
Think about this illustration just for a moment.

00:34:30.739 --> 00:34:33.919
I've been in this auditorium when it's extremely dark.

00:34:33.919 --> 00:34:35.759
In fact, we have new shades

00:34:35.759 --> 00:34:37.559
and those shades make it dark in here

00:34:37.559 --> 00:34:39.359
even in the middle of the day.

00:34:39.359 --> 00:34:42.160
But I've walked through this auditorium

00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:44.399
many times at night when it's dark

00:34:44.399 --> 00:34:45.839
and the shades are pulled

00:34:45.839 --> 00:34:49.119
and I need to get from that door to this door.

00:34:49.119 --> 00:34:51.119
There are a lot of things in the way.

00:34:51.119 --> 00:34:52.639
And I can tell you that the pews

00:34:52.639 --> 00:34:54.299
don't feel good on your knees.

00:34:55.559 --> 00:34:58.399
All right, you knock into one of these pews and it hurts.

00:34:59.679 --> 00:35:01.919
And so I use a little light,

00:35:01.919 --> 00:35:04.359
maybe a flashlight, one of those key chain flashlights

00:35:04.359 --> 00:35:06.940
that we give out, maybe the light on my phone,

00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:10.239
but I use a light to be able to get through this auditorium

00:35:10.239 --> 00:35:11.799
at nighttime because it's dark.

00:35:12.759 --> 00:35:14.579
But you know that light does nothing for me

00:35:14.579 --> 00:35:16.699
during the day when the lights are on?

00:35:16.699 --> 00:35:19.199
You don't need your flashlight right now.

00:35:19.199 --> 00:35:21.619
If you walk through this auditorium right now

00:35:21.619 --> 00:35:23.419
with your little key chain flashlight

00:35:23.419 --> 00:35:26.660
to try to get through here, people think you're crazy.

00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:27.500
Why?

00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:29.299
Because there's so much more light.

00:35:30.459 --> 00:35:34.299
And so that light, that little flashlight,

00:35:34.299 --> 00:35:37.179
is of no use in the fact that

00:35:37.179 --> 00:35:39.779
there's something that's greater.

00:35:39.779 --> 00:35:42.259
And so we find that as we think about this,

00:35:42.259 --> 00:35:44.820
it's not again that the law is of no use,

00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:47.500
there is glory, but it points us to Christ.

00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:51.179
And we find that here, this new way he talks about

00:35:51.179 --> 00:35:55.059
in verse number six, that who also hath made us.

00:35:55.059 --> 00:35:56.660
Remember, he's talking about the ministry

00:35:56.660 --> 00:35:58.339
that God has given to him.

00:35:58.339 --> 00:36:01.660
Able ministers of the New Testament,

00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:04.139
this new covenant that God spoke about

00:36:04.139 --> 00:36:06.419
in Jeremiah chapter 31.

00:36:06.419 --> 00:36:10.979
And we find that here now, the apostle Paul is talking

00:36:10.979 --> 00:36:14.339
and giving this contrast between the law condemning

00:36:14.339 --> 00:36:16.459
and the gospel converting.

00:36:17.459 --> 00:36:19.220
He says in verse number 11,

00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:21.500
for if that which was done away was glorious,

00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:25.100
much more that which remaineth is glorious.

00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:28.660
Do you see how he keeps talking in terms of excelling

00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:31.779
and exceeding and being much more?

00:36:31.779 --> 00:36:36.779
Verse 12, seeing then that we have such hope.

00:36:37.899 --> 00:36:40.500
Oh, I'm so thankful for the hope that we have in Christ.

00:36:41.019 --> 00:36:41.859
He is our hope.

00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:46.419
My hope is Jesus, the songwriter said.

00:36:46.419 --> 00:36:49.820
And we've sang that song here, what a great song it is.

00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:52.779
And the reality this morning is that it says,

00:36:52.779 --> 00:36:55.139
seeing then that we have such hope,

00:36:55.139 --> 00:36:58.619
we use great plainness of speech.

00:36:58.619 --> 00:37:00.660
Why is Paul talking about this plainness of speech?

00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:03.459
Because there's nothing for us to complicate here.

00:37:03.459 --> 00:37:04.779
The gospel's simple.

00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:07.859
You know, it's so simple that sometimes

00:37:07.859 --> 00:37:09.279
people stumble over it.

00:37:10.539 --> 00:37:14.579
Again, to talk about that fleshly tendency,

00:37:14.579 --> 00:37:18.019
that there must be something I have to do to get to heaven.

00:37:18.019 --> 00:37:19.459
There must be some good thing

00:37:19.459 --> 00:37:21.579
that I have to do to get to heaven.

00:37:21.579 --> 00:37:24.100
And you go to someone and you share the gospel with them

00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:26.799
and you give them the plainness of the gospel,

00:37:26.799 --> 00:37:30.380
that Jesus paid it all, that he said it is finished,

00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:31.899
that he said done.

00:37:31.899 --> 00:37:33.859
There's nothing more for us to do.

00:37:33.859 --> 00:37:36.859
There's nothing that we could possibly do.

00:37:36.859 --> 00:37:40.660
As Isaiah says, all of our good works are as filthy rags.

00:37:42.459 --> 00:37:47.459
So many people stumble over the simplicity of the gospel.

00:37:49.459 --> 00:37:51.779
The simplicity of the gospel.

00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:57.479
People struggle with security because they wonder,

00:37:57.479 --> 00:37:59.399
did they really do this, that, or the other?

00:37:59.399 --> 00:38:00.779
Did they understand?

00:38:00.779 --> 00:38:04.139
Jesus said, as it's recorded for us,

00:38:05.139 --> 00:38:07.019
by Paul writing in Romans chapter 10,

00:38:07.019 --> 00:38:09.779
for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord

00:38:09.779 --> 00:38:10.859
shall be saved.

00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:15.859
When we recognize that we're sinners

00:38:15.859 --> 00:38:18.139
and that he's the only savior,

00:38:18.139 --> 00:38:20.779
we say I can't save myself, there's nothing I can do.

00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:24.579
But you're the savior.

00:38:24.579 --> 00:38:26.600
You died for me, you took my place,

00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:28.579
you paid what I could never pay.

00:38:29.419 --> 00:38:32.779
You rose, demonstrating your power,

00:38:32.779 --> 00:38:34.940
the completeness of the transaction,

00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:38.219
and I accept you, I call upon you to be my savior,

00:38:38.219 --> 00:38:41.460
to give me that gift of eternal life.

00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:43.339
Then guess what God does?

00:38:43.339 --> 00:38:44.979
He saves you.

00:38:44.979 --> 00:38:45.799
Why?

00:38:45.799 --> 00:38:46.880
Well, he cannot lie.

00:38:47.899 --> 00:38:50.719
We come to him by faith, trusting him.

00:38:50.719 --> 00:38:54.020
Simply trusting, with childlike faith.

00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:56.700
In the gospel, it converts.

00:38:56.700 --> 00:38:58.859
The lives of these individuals

00:38:58.859 --> 00:39:01.140
had been transformed by the gospel.

00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:03.859
Their lives were evidence to the power

00:39:03.859 --> 00:39:06.460
of the gospel to convert.

00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:08.059
He said in the beginning verses

00:39:08.059 --> 00:39:09.899
of 2 Corinthians chapter number three,

00:39:09.899 --> 00:39:11.899
do we begin again to commend ourselves,

00:39:11.899 --> 00:39:15.460
or need we, as some others, epistles of commendation to you

00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:17.460
or letters of commendation from you?

00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:21.739
Ye are our epistle, written in our hearts,

00:39:21.739 --> 00:39:24.099
known and read of all men,

00:39:24.099 --> 00:39:26.940
for as much as ye are manifestly declared

00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:28.580
to be the epistle of Christ,

00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:30.599
ministered by us, written not with ink,

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:32.520
but with the spirit of the living God,

00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:33.719
not in tables of stone,

00:39:33.719 --> 00:39:36.159
but in fleshly tables of the heart.

00:39:36.159 --> 00:39:38.239
What is Paul saying?

00:39:38.239 --> 00:39:43.239
Your lives are the testimony of the power of the gospel.

00:39:44.359 --> 00:39:46.640
Let me remind you of what the Bible says

00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:48.239
in 1 Corinthians chapter six,

00:39:48.239 --> 00:39:49.839
turn back, hold your spot,

00:39:49.839 --> 00:39:51.279
in 2 Corinthians chapter three,

00:39:51.279 --> 00:39:53.760
but let me remind you of what the Bible says here

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:56.599
in 1 Corinthians chapter number six.

00:39:56.599 --> 00:39:59.760
In verse number nine of 1 Corinthians chapter number six,

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:00.599
he's writing.

00:40:00.599 --> 00:40:03.499
to the same group of people that had gone in to Corinth,

00:40:03.499 --> 00:40:05.499
he had preached the gospel, people got saved,

00:40:05.499 --> 00:40:06.799
and praised the Lord for it.

00:40:06.799 --> 00:40:09.839
In verse 9, it says this of 1 Corinthians 6 and verse 9,

00:40:09.839 --> 00:40:11.879
know ye not that the unrighteousness

00:40:11.879 --> 00:40:14.119
shall not inherit the kingdom of God?

00:40:14.119 --> 00:40:16.679
Be not deceived, neither fornicators, nor idolaters,

00:40:16.679 --> 00:40:18.119
nor adulterers, nor effeminate,

00:40:18.119 --> 00:40:20.219
nor abusers of themselves with mankind,

00:40:20.219 --> 00:40:23.259
nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards,

00:40:23.259 --> 00:40:25.199
nor revilers, nor extortioners

00:40:25.199 --> 00:40:28.299
shall inherit the kingdom of God.

00:40:28.599 --> 00:40:30.099
But look at verse number 11.

00:40:31.079 --> 00:40:36.079
And such were some of you, such were some of you,

00:40:37.019 --> 00:40:42.019
but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified,

00:40:42.199 --> 00:40:45.499
but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus

00:40:45.499 --> 00:40:48.619
and by the Spirit of our God.

00:40:48.619 --> 00:40:53.099
He said, listen, as he calls out in verse 9 and 10,

00:40:53.099 --> 00:40:55.499
all of these particular sins

00:40:55.819 --> 00:40:57.859
and how they would be labeled

00:40:57.859 --> 00:40:59.899
as being guilty of these sins,

00:40:59.899 --> 00:41:02.379
and he says, listen, such were some of you.

00:41:03.619 --> 00:41:06.779
Listen, we sang this morning, and Dean picks the songs.

00:41:06.779 --> 00:41:08.739
I don't pick the songs.

00:41:08.739 --> 00:41:10.779
You know what we sang this morning?

00:41:10.779 --> 00:41:13.599
I'm only a sinner saved by grace.

00:41:14.459 --> 00:41:16.659
Saved, saved.

00:41:16.659 --> 00:41:18.959
Those are the two songs we sang this morning.

00:41:18.959 --> 00:41:20.659
Praise the Lord.

00:41:20.659 --> 00:41:21.739
I'm only a sinner.

00:41:21.739 --> 00:41:23.079
But such were some of you.

00:41:23.079 --> 00:41:26.199
Listen, it's the grace of God.

00:41:27.279 --> 00:41:31.419
It's the grace of God, because the gospel converts.

00:41:31.419 --> 00:41:34.119
The law condemns, but the gospel converts.

00:41:34.119 --> 00:41:36.799
We find we don't have time to look at Jeremiah 31,

00:41:36.799 --> 00:41:39.479
jot it down perhaps, verses 27 through 34,

00:41:39.479 --> 00:41:41.719
and you find about the new covenant that is mentioned,

00:41:41.719 --> 00:41:44.079
but I wanna look at Romans 8 just for a moment.

00:41:44.079 --> 00:41:46.319
We mentioned Romans chapter number 7,

00:41:46.319 --> 00:41:47.919
and we looked at that passage

00:41:47.919 --> 00:41:49.879
dealing with the law condemning,

00:41:49.879 --> 00:41:51.799
but I want you to see Romans chapter number 8,

00:41:51.799 --> 00:41:54.879
because the gospel converts.

00:41:54.879 --> 00:41:56.519
When we look at Romans chapter number 8,

00:41:56.519 --> 00:41:59.119
in these first few verses of Romans chapter number 8,

00:41:59.119 --> 00:42:02.279
God gives to us this beautiful truth

00:42:02.279 --> 00:42:07.159
with regard to this new position that we have in Christ.

00:42:07.159 --> 00:42:08.879
Notice, if you've been saved

00:42:08.879 --> 00:42:10.679
by the grace of God this morning,

00:42:10.679 --> 00:42:12.479
you know for sure that heaven's your home.

00:42:12.479 --> 00:42:13.599
It's not of your works.

00:42:13.599 --> 00:42:15.199
There's nothing that you could do,

00:42:15.199 --> 00:42:18.839
but you went to that humbly to the Lord Jesus Christ

00:42:18.839 --> 00:42:20.479
and accept him as your personal savior.

00:42:20.479 --> 00:42:22.439
Notice what the Bible says in verse number 8,

00:42:22.439 --> 00:42:24.439
excuse me, verse number 1 of Romans 8.

00:42:24.439 --> 00:42:29.439
There is therefore now no condemnation

00:42:30.039 --> 00:42:34.799
to them which are in Christ Jesus.

00:42:35.679 --> 00:42:38.839
He that believeth not is condemned already.

00:42:38.839 --> 00:42:41.959
The law condemns, but if you're in Jesus Christ,

00:42:41.959 --> 00:42:43.079
what does it mean to be in Jesus Christ?

00:42:43.079 --> 00:42:43.999
You've been saved.

00:42:43.999 --> 00:42:47.159
You've been born again by the grace of God.

00:42:47.159 --> 00:42:51.519
The Bible says there is therefore now no condemnation

00:42:51.519 --> 00:42:53.159
to them which are in Christ Jesus

00:42:53.159 --> 00:42:55.799
who walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit

00:42:55.799 --> 00:42:59.999
for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus.

00:42:59.999 --> 00:43:01.319
Now, do you see that phrase,

00:43:01.319 --> 00:43:06.319
the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus?

00:43:06.559 --> 00:43:11.559
The gospel hath made me free from the law of sin and death.

00:43:14.519 --> 00:43:15.719
There's a new law,

00:43:15.719 --> 00:43:19.919
and it's the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus.

00:43:19.919 --> 00:43:21.279
Hallelujah.

00:43:21.279 --> 00:43:22.799
You read the book of Esther,

00:43:22.799 --> 00:43:26.279
and there was a writing, a law that was given

00:43:26.279 --> 00:43:28.279
that all the Jewish people were gonna be killed

00:43:28.279 --> 00:43:31.559
on a certain day, and after Mordecai, excuse me,

00:43:31.559 --> 00:43:34.839
after Haman had been exposed through Mordecai and Esther

00:43:34.839 --> 00:43:36.399
and all that had taken place,

00:43:36.399 --> 00:43:39.199
there was a question that was raised by King Ahasuerus

00:43:39.199 --> 00:43:40.559
as to what you wanna do,

00:43:40.559 --> 00:43:42.919
and he said, I wanna write a counter decree.

00:43:42.919 --> 00:43:45.039
See, they could not overturn the law

00:43:45.039 --> 00:43:46.239
of the Medes and Persians.

00:43:46.239 --> 00:43:47.959
It was settled, it was solid,

00:43:47.959 --> 00:43:50.759
but they could write a counter decree,

00:43:50.759 --> 00:43:53.759
and that counter decree was to be published

00:43:53.759 --> 00:43:56.919
throughout all the land, and they did it with haste.

00:43:56.919 --> 00:43:57.759
Why?

00:43:57.759 --> 00:43:59.319
Because there was a new law.

00:43:59.319 --> 00:44:02.319
There was a counter decree that they had to be made aware of,

00:44:02.319 --> 00:44:04.559
and we see here in Romans chapter number eight,

00:44:04.559 --> 00:44:08.459
the law, as he says, of sin and death, it condemns,

00:44:08.459 --> 00:44:11.839
but the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus

00:44:11.839 --> 00:44:14.359
hath made me free.

00:44:15.879 --> 00:44:20.519
Glorious, the glorious gospel, the gospel converts.

00:44:22.359 --> 00:44:25.199
Notice verse three, for what the law, what does it say?

00:44:25.199 --> 00:44:27.219
Could not do.

00:44:28.119 --> 00:44:30.559
For what the law could not do,

00:44:30.559 --> 00:44:32.439
and that it was weak through the flesh,

00:44:32.439 --> 00:44:36.599
God, sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh

00:44:36.599 --> 00:44:41.359
for, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh,

00:44:41.359 --> 00:44:44.559
that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us

00:44:44.959 --> 00:44:49.279
to walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit.

00:44:49.279 --> 00:44:51.619
Hallelujah for the gospel.

00:44:52.479 --> 00:44:55.119
We could look at other verses, Galatians five,

00:44:55.119 --> 00:44:58.919
and verse number one, the Bible says very plainly there,

00:44:58.919 --> 00:45:00.999
again, writing to these that are dealing

00:45:00.999 --> 00:45:02.519
with the same false teaching,

00:45:02.519 --> 00:45:05.779
stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ

00:45:05.779 --> 00:45:08.959
hath made us free, and be not entangled again

00:45:08.959 --> 00:45:10.659
with the yoke of bondage.

00:45:12.199 --> 00:45:14.319
We read Hebrews 10, verses one through four,

00:45:15.079 --> 00:45:15.919
we don't have time this morning

00:45:15.919 --> 00:45:18.839
to look at verses 11 and 12, and 19 and 20,

00:45:18.839 --> 00:45:20.759
but he talks about how this man,

00:45:20.759 --> 00:45:25.159
after one sacrifice for sin forever, sat down.

00:45:25.159 --> 00:45:25.999
Why?

00:45:25.999 --> 00:45:26.979
It's finished.

00:45:28.319 --> 00:45:30.439
The Bible talks about this truth,

00:45:30.439 --> 00:45:33.159
and I'll mention it, look, in Hebrews chapter 10,

00:45:33.159 --> 00:45:36.519
in verses 19 and 20, the Bible gives us this truth

00:45:36.519 --> 00:45:39.579
with regard to this new and living way.

00:45:41.039 --> 00:45:43.439
And I'm gonna wrap it up with this this morning.

00:45:44.479 --> 00:45:47.159
And I want us to rejoice.

00:45:47.159 --> 00:45:48.999
In Hebrews chapter 10, in verse 19,

00:45:48.999 --> 00:45:52.199
the Bible says, having therefore, brethren,

00:45:52.199 --> 00:45:57.199
boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus.

00:45:58.399 --> 00:46:00.759
Notice what he says in verse 20 of Hebrews 10,

00:46:00.759 --> 00:46:05.759
by a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us

00:46:05.879 --> 00:46:10.559
through the veil, that is to say, his flesh.

00:46:10.559 --> 00:46:12.759
Now, if you understand much of the book of Hebrews,

00:46:12.759 --> 00:46:14.519
and I'll try to say it quickly,

00:46:14.519 --> 00:46:17.319
but we find that we're told that we're to come boldly

00:46:17.319 --> 00:46:19.479
under the throne of grace in chapter number four.

00:46:19.479 --> 00:46:21.119
We find that in chapter number nine,

00:46:21.119 --> 00:46:23.799
he begins to illustrate for us and help us

00:46:23.799 --> 00:46:28.359
to be reminded of the Old Testament day of atonement.

00:46:28.359 --> 00:46:30.439
And on once a year, on the day of atonement,

00:46:30.439 --> 00:46:33.559
the high priest, and only the high priest on that day,

00:46:33.559 --> 00:46:38.259
and only with blood, could enter into the holy of holies.

00:46:38.259 --> 00:46:40.999
The tabernacle and the temple, there was an outer court,

00:46:40.999 --> 00:46:42.479
and then there was the holy place,

00:46:43.199 --> 00:46:44.519
and then there was the holy of holies,

00:46:44.519 --> 00:46:46.679
where was the ark of the covenant on the mercy seat,

00:46:46.679 --> 00:46:49.159
and we find, or the mercy seat on the ark of the covenant,

00:46:49.159 --> 00:46:51.439
and we find that Hebrews chapter number nine

00:46:51.439 --> 00:46:53.519
begins to paint for us that picture,

00:46:53.519 --> 00:46:55.639
and understand that the high priest

00:46:55.639 --> 00:46:58.559
only on that day could enter in.

00:46:59.439 --> 00:47:01.679
But now look at what he says in verse number 19,

00:47:01.679 --> 00:47:04.879
having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter

00:47:04.879 --> 00:47:07.599
into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,

00:47:07.599 --> 00:47:11.539
by a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us

00:47:11.579 --> 00:47:13.539
through the veil that is to say his flesh.

00:47:13.539 --> 00:47:17.259
Do you remember when Jesus gave up his life,

00:47:17.259 --> 00:47:21.259
when he died on Calvary, the veil was rented to,

00:47:21.259 --> 00:47:23.899
providing for us the truth of access

00:47:23.899 --> 00:47:25.979
that we have through Jesus Christ.

00:47:25.979 --> 00:47:28.459
And turn back to second Corinthians chapter three,

00:47:28.459 --> 00:47:31.979
and notice as we finish up here with verses 17 and 18,

00:47:31.979 --> 00:47:35.379
the Bible reveals to us this powerful truth

00:47:35.379 --> 00:47:39.899
with regard to our access to God.

00:47:39.899 --> 00:47:44.379
In verse 17, talking about those that have been converted

00:47:44.379 --> 00:47:46.579
because of the truth of the gospel,

00:47:46.579 --> 00:47:50.059
the Bible says this, now the Lord is that spirit,

00:47:50.059 --> 00:47:54.259
and where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.

00:47:54.259 --> 00:47:58.819
Verse 18, watch it, but we all, how many?

00:47:58.819 --> 00:48:01.699
Well, he's talking about all those that are saved,

00:48:01.699 --> 00:48:03.499
that are being converted.

00:48:03.499 --> 00:48:08.219
But we all, with open face, beholding as in a glass

00:48:08.219 --> 00:48:13.059
the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image

00:48:13.059 --> 00:48:18.059
from glory to glory, even as by the spirit of the Lord.

00:48:19.699 --> 00:48:23.299
Who was allowed on the Mount in Exodus chapter 34?

00:48:23.299 --> 00:48:28.299
Moses alone, no other man, just Moses.

00:48:32.619 --> 00:48:36.099
But here we find that we all,

00:48:36.099 --> 00:48:40.339
if you're saved this morning, you have direct access to God.

00:48:40.339 --> 00:48:42.179
If you're saved this morning,

00:48:42.179 --> 00:48:44.979
you can spend as much time with God as you want.

00:48:44.979 --> 00:48:47.979
And really, I believe that what is being revealed to us

00:48:47.979 --> 00:48:51.779
in verse 18 is the truth of sanctification,

00:48:51.779 --> 00:48:54.259
that we're to be conformed to the image of Christ,

00:48:54.259 --> 00:48:57.699
to the Romans 8, 29 talks about being conformed

00:48:57.699 --> 00:49:00.380
to the image of his dear son, of the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:04.500
and we find that we're changed from glory to glory.

00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:06.579
As it says there in verse number 18,

00:49:06.579 --> 00:49:08.979
and that's through spending time with the Lord,

00:49:08.979 --> 00:49:12.659
being in his presence, as Moses was in his presence

00:49:12.659 --> 00:49:14.459
and it was evidenced in his life,

00:49:14.459 --> 00:49:18.380
so too as we are in the presence of our Savior,

00:49:18.380 --> 00:49:20.059
that it's evidenced in our lives,

00:49:20.059 --> 00:49:22.500
that process of sanctification.

00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:24.500
And here's the truth this morning.

00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:28.219
As we look at this contrast between the law and grace

00:49:28.219 --> 00:49:30.139
and looking at 2 Corinthians 3

00:49:30.139 --> 00:49:32.179
and all that God gives us,

00:49:32.179 --> 00:49:33.739
I want you to understand this morning

00:49:33.779 --> 00:49:35.899
that according to Galatians 3 and verse 24,

00:49:35.899 --> 00:49:40.299
we read it a moment ago, the law brings us to Christ.

00:49:41.940 --> 00:49:44.500
But according to 2 Corinthians 3 and verse 18,

00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:47.859
grace makes us like Christ.

00:49:48.779 --> 00:49:50.299
I want you to think about that just for a moment

00:49:50.299 --> 00:49:52.139
as we close this morning.

00:49:52.139 --> 00:49:57.139
The law, the purpose of the law is to bring us to Christ.

00:49:57.179 --> 00:49:59.019
It condemns.

00:49:59.019 --> 00:50:00.339
Life cannot come.

00:50:00.339 --> 00:50:07.179
cannot do, it is weak. But it points us, it's the schoolmaster to bring us to Christ. How

00:50:07.179 --> 00:50:11.779
did you know you were a sinner? Well, Paul says in Romans 7, I had not known sin except

00:50:11.779 --> 00:50:20.499
for the law said, thou shalt not covet. But as we trust Christ as our Savior, it is the

00:50:20.499 --> 00:50:28.939
grace of God that makes us like Christ. And what a glorious truth that is. They were called

00:50:28.939 --> 00:50:34.859
Christians first in Antioch. Why? Because they were like Christ. This morning, if you're

00:50:34.859 --> 00:50:39.839
not saved, if you don't know for sure that heaven is your home, today is the day of salvation.

00:50:39.839 --> 00:50:45.379
Do not delay. Trust Christ today. He said that whosoever shall call upon the name of

00:50:45.379 --> 00:50:50.179
the Lord shall be saved. The gospel converts. He said, I've been trying to keep the law.

00:50:50.179 --> 00:50:53.399
I've been trying to do all this stuff. I've been trying to do all these works. And like

00:50:53.399 --> 00:50:57.179
I asked William two weeks, a week and a half ago, I said, but how do you know if you've

00:50:57.179 --> 00:51:07.079
ever done enough? How do you ever know? Works cannot save us. The law cannot save us. If

00:51:07.079 --> 00:51:12.679
you're not saved this morning, would you trust Christ as your Savior? Because the gospel

00:51:12.679 --> 00:51:18.079
converts. What Jesus did on that cruel cross 2,000 years ago was to pay for your salvation

00:51:18.079 --> 00:51:22.719
and for my salvation. And He's the only way. There's no other way. No other name under

00:51:22.719 --> 00:51:28.819
heaven given among men whereby we must be saved. If you're saved this morning, how much

00:51:28.819 --> 00:51:34.639
time do you spend with Christ? That process of sanctification, being changed from glory

00:51:34.639 --> 00:51:41.699
to glory, that we would be like Him. That we'd be like Him. That when others see us

00:51:41.699 --> 00:51:48.939
as they saw Peter and John in Acts 4, they'd say, they've been with Jesus. They've been

00:51:48.939 --> 00:51:55.119
with Jesus. Oh, I'm so thankful for the glorious gospel, for the grace of God. Let's pray.

00:51:55.119 --> 00:52:00.479
Father, we love You. We thank You for loving us. Thank You for Your Word this morning.

00:52:00.479 --> 00:52:08.359
God, I pray that You would help us today to have a burden for those who are lost or condemned

00:52:08.359 --> 00:52:18.159
by the law. Many that have been blinded, trying to work their way to heaven, keep some law,

00:52:18.879 --> 00:52:26.879
Lord, I pray that we'd be burdened, that we would be faithful to give the glorious

00:52:26.879 --> 00:52:34.059
gospel because it's the glorious gospel that converts. Holy Spirit, if there's one that's

00:52:34.059 --> 00:52:39.759
not saved, would You please convict them of their sin and of Christ's righteousness and

00:52:39.759 --> 00:52:44.039
of judgment to come. They'd come this morning and we'd be able to take a Bible and show

00:52:44.039 --> 00:52:49.179
them for sure how they could know that heaven is their home. For every child of God, would

00:52:49.179 --> 00:52:57.419
You help us to rejoice in our salvation? Would You help us to be concerned about our sanctification,

00:52:57.419 --> 00:53:04.259
that we'd spend time in Your presence, that we might be like Thee? We thank You for the,

00:53:04.259 --> 00:53:08.979
for Your grace. We thank You for the gospel. I pray that You'd move and work in lives as

00:53:08.979 --> 00:53:13.259
only You can in this moment of invitation. For it's in Christ's name we pray. Would You

00:53:13.279 --> 00:53:17.479
stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed. Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano

00:53:17.479 --> 00:53:21.139
as she does. The altar's open. If you're not sure of heaven, we'd love to take a Bible

00:53:21.139 --> 00:53:24.239
and show you how you could know for sure that heaven's your home. Maybe you just want to

00:53:24.239 --> 00:53:30.179
come and thank God for the gospel. Maybe you want to come and recognize your need to spend

00:53:30.179 --> 00:53:36.159
more time with Christ that you might be sanctified glory to glory. As Kimberly plays, the altar

00:53:36.159 --> 00:53:36.799
is open.
