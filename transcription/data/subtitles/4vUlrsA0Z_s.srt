1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
Chapter number nine, Genesis chapter number nine this evening, and we'll be finishing

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,520
up Genesis chapter nine, looking at verses 18 through 29 this evening will be our text

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,079
of scripture.

4
00:00:10,079 --> 00:00:17,239
And if you're taking notes, I've titled the message this evening, Noah's final days.

5
00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:21,719
And it's kind of interesting because I'll title the message Noah's final days, and it's

6
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:26,899
only a few verses of scripture, but it covers about 350 years.

7
00:00:26,899 --> 00:00:32,779
And so it's kind of ironic, but that is the passage that is before us here as we get back

8
00:00:32,779 --> 00:00:34,060
to the book of Genesis.

9
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:35,259
We've been studying the book of Genesis.

10
00:00:35,259 --> 00:00:40,020
Of course, we've taken off several weeks now with some other subjects that we've been dealing

11
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,020
with.

12
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:45,180
And this is our 32nd lesson, believe it or not, through the book of Genesis.

13
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,060
I've thoroughly enjoyed the study, and we've been going at it for a lengthy period of time.

14
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:54,979
We first met Noah back in Genesis chapter number six, in the midst of great wickedness.

15
00:00:54,979 --> 00:01:00,340
And the Bible tells us that Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations.

16
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:04,339
And then the Bible tells us this, that Noah walked with God.

17
00:01:04,339 --> 00:01:06,339
What a great testimony.

18
00:01:06,339 --> 00:01:10,019
We think about the testimony of Noah, and we think about all of the things that were

19
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:14,019
going on as God describes for us in Genesis chapter number six.

20
00:01:14,019 --> 00:01:18,900
We find that Noah walked with God, and we find that the Bible tells us that Noah found

21
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,980
grace in the eyes of the Lord.

22
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:28,019
We find that God begins to reveal to Noah the plan that God has to destroy the earth

23
00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:30,819
and to destroy the inhabitants of the earth.

24
00:01:30,819 --> 00:01:35,980
And we find that in verse number 13, in fact, of Genesis chapter number six, God speaks

25
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,059
directly to Noah and informs him.

26
00:01:38,059 --> 00:01:42,860
He says, the end of all flesh has come before me, for the earth is filled with violence

27
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:43,860
through them.

28
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,819
And behold, I will destroy them with the earth.

29
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:48,940
He then tells him this.

30
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:55,099
We see the grace of God in verse number 14, make thee an ark of gopher wood, room shalt

31
00:01:55,099 --> 00:02:00,459
thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.

32
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:02,500
And God gives him the instruction.

33
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:07,940
We find that we have noted on several occasions, and we've studied through these portions,

34
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:13,100
Genesis six through eight, and we've studied the great flood, and we've studied the life

35
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,899
of Noah, and we have noted the obedience of Noah.

36
00:02:16,899 --> 00:02:21,139
How he obeyed the Lord, how he did what God told him to do.

37
00:02:21,139 --> 00:02:22,139
And what a blessing.

38
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:26,820
In our last study from the book of Genesis, we actually studied the first half of chapter

39
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:27,820
number nine.

40
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:30,899
There's a net up here that's about to drive me crazy.

41
00:02:30,899 --> 00:02:35,100
And so I don't know where the fly went, but if the fly would get the net, I'd be happy.

42
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:39,779
And in any case, in Genesis chapter number nine, verses one through 17, we dealt with

43
00:02:39,779 --> 00:02:41,539
the Noahic covenant.

44
00:02:41,539 --> 00:02:45,360
And that was in our last study from the book of Genesis this evening.

45
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,639
As we complete the ninth chapter, we'll see the summary that is given to us with regard

46
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:52,360
to Noah's final days.

47
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,320
Notice in verse number 18 of Genesis nine, the Bible says, and the sons of Noah that

48
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,320
went forth of the ark were Shem and Ham and Japheth.

49
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,039
And Ham is the father of Canaan.

50
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:04,119
These are the three sons of Noah.

51
00:03:04,119 --> 00:03:09,279
Notice this, and of them was the whole earth overspread.

52
00:03:09,279 --> 00:03:13,960
We'll get through the entirety of the chapter this evening, but let's begin and take some

53
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,960
notes.

54
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,080
Notice number one, the replenishing of the earth.

55
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,800
In verses 18 and 19, as we break down this passage of scripture, we see an important

56
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,839
truth that is given to us.

57
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:29,800
The important truth that is given to us is with regard to the replenishing of the earth.

58
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:34,479
And we find that the Bible says at the end of verse number 19, and of them, who is them?

59
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:40,479
It's the three sons of Noah, Noah and his wife, his three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

60
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:47,800
And we see that the Bible says of them was the whole earth overspread.

61
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:53,440
Now we understand as we've studied here over the last several lessons from the book of

62
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:58,240
Genesis and studying in chapter six through eight, we understand that God has given us

63
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:02,440
the record of the Noah flood, the global flood.

64
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,000
We understand that it's global in nature.

65
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,080
It was not just a local flood, it was a global flood.

66
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:14,080
In fact, as we looked at the Noahic covenant and we discussed the various aspects of the

67
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:19,359
covenant that God gave in the first 17 verses here of Genesis chapter number nine, we understood

68
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,720
again the fact that it was a global flood.

69
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,799
Now understand with me, there are some that would seek to promote this idea that there

70
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:35,000
are other groups of people on the face of the earth that were somehow sheltered from

71
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,239
the flood and part of the replenishing of the earth, and there were pockets of population

72
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,059
in various parts of the earth.

73
00:04:43,059 --> 00:04:48,799
Can I tell you very firmly that that is not biblically based?

74
00:04:48,799 --> 00:04:52,640
And we must understand that we approach these things biblically.

75
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:59,799
The Bible must be our guide, and we understand that God gave us very specific things.

76
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:03,559
Let's go back to Genesis chapter number six, and I want to just walk through these three

77
00:05:03,559 --> 00:05:09,720
chapters and just point out a few verses of scripture along the way to help us understand.

78
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,959
It was in Genesis chapter number six, we read verse 13, let me read verse number seven to

79
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:14,959
you.

80
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:19,480
The Bible says in Genesis six and verse number seven, and the Lord said, I will destroy man

81
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:25,260
whom I have created from the face of the earth, both man and beast and the creeping thing

82
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:30,040
and the fowls of the air, for it repenteth me that I have made them.

83
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:34,799
And so we find that in Genesis chapter number six, verse number seven and verse number 13,

84
00:05:34,799 --> 00:05:39,040
both give us the announcement of this judgment that was impending.

85
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:44,600
We find that in Genesis chapter number seven, that the Bible tells us in verse number seven,

86
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,200
and Noah went in.

87
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,200
What did he go in?

88
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,760
He went in the ark.

89
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:54,959
Not only did Noah go in, but it says, and his sons and his wife and his son's wives

90
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:59,000
with him into the ark because of the waters of the flood.

91
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,200
Let's skip down and look at verse number 13.

92
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:06,200
The Bible says in the self same day entered Noah and Shem and Ham and Japheth and the

93
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:14,239
sons of Noah and Noah's wife and the three wives of his sons with them into the ark.

94
00:06:14,239 --> 00:06:18,640
God gives us a record of the human beings that entered the ark.

95
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,640
There were eight.

96
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:24,739
In fact, if you look at the new Testament, the Bible talks about the eight persons referring

97
00:06:24,739 --> 00:06:28,239
to Noah, his wife, his three sons, and their wives.

98
00:06:28,239 --> 00:06:30,299
These eight entered into the ark.

99
00:06:30,299 --> 00:06:35,200
We find that in, as you skip down to verse number 21 of Genesis chapter number seven,

100
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:42,399
the Bible says, and all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl and of cattle

101
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:45,760
of beast and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.

102
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,959
What's it say?

103
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:52,920
And every man, verse 23, notice the Bible says in every living substance was destroyed,

104
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:57,720
which was upon the face of the ground, both man and cattle and the creeping things and

105
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,959
the fowl of the heaven, and they were destroyed from the earth.

106
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:07,559
And Noah only remained alive in they that were with him in the ark.

107
00:07:07,559 --> 00:07:11,440
Aren't you glad that God gave us a record of who went into the ark?

108
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,500
He didn't leave it for our speculation.

109
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:18,320
He didn't leave it for some theologians or from some whoever group of people to sit around

110
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:22,279
and say, well, let's think about how big the ark was and let's think about how many could

111
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:23,279
have fit on it.

112
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:27,600
And this, no, the Bible tells us who went on the ark.

113
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:33,079
And so we find that as we look here in the passage of scripture in chapter six, seven,

114
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:38,040
eight, of course, is when the ark, when the waters were assuaged and when the ark rested

115
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:43,200
and when Noah came off the ark and you find that it was Noah and his wife and his sons

116
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:48,040
and their wives notice in verse number 18 of chapter number eight, actually back up

117
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,519
to verse number 15.

118
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:55,000
And God spake unto Noah saying, go forth of the ark, thou and thy wife and thy sons and

119
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,760
thy son's wives with thee.

120
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,619
So they all survived during the time on the ark.

121
00:08:00,619 --> 00:08:05,480
It tells us in verse number 18 and Noah went forth and his sons and his wife and his son's

122
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,380
wives with him.

123
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:11,799
And as we move into chapter number nine, we find the Bible says in verse number one, and

124
00:08:11,799 --> 00:08:15,920
God blessed Noah and his sons and said unto them, be fruitful and multiply and replenish

125
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,920
the earth.

126
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:21,679
And so as we look at this entrance or the beginning of this passage of scripture that

127
00:08:21,679 --> 00:08:26,279
we're studying this evening and looking at verses 18 and 19, the Bible repeats to us

128
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:30,519
again who the sons of Noah are that went forth of the ark.

129
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:37,640
And the Bible very clearly teaches us that of them was the whole earth over spread.

130
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:43,440
And so we find biblically speaking, the human race traces its lineage back to Noah, Shem,

131
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,640
Ham, and Japheth.

132
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,159
Of course, they go back to Adam, right?

133
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:49,820
The first man.

134
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:54,619
We read of that, of course, in Genesis one, when God said, let us make man in our own

135
00:08:54,619 --> 00:08:55,619
image.

136
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:58,859
And of course, we understand and we've studied that in the past.

137
00:08:58,859 --> 00:09:05,059
Notice what the Bible tells us in Acts chapter number 17, in verse number 26, Paul is here

138
00:09:05,059 --> 00:09:10,260
in this situation and he is going, of course, to Athens and he's preaching there.

139
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:15,299
And we find that he saw a city that was wholly given to idolatry.

140
00:09:15,299 --> 00:09:20,900
And these people that served idols, they had a whole grove of them, if you will.

141
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:25,280
And we find that Paul mentioned that as he went through, he noticed that there was one

142
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:29,140
with the inscription to the unknown God.

143
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:33,940
And Paul says that you worship him ignorantly.

144
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:37,700
And then he says this, him declare I unto you.

145
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:43,020
And then we begin noticing what Paul declares of this God, the Lord God, Jehovah, in verse

146
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:50,179
number 24 of Acts 17, it says, God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that

147
00:09:50,179 --> 00:09:55,460
he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands.

148
00:09:55,460 --> 00:10:00,020
Neither is worship with men's hands as though he needed anything, seeing he giveth to all

149
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:05,840
life and breath and all things. And hath made of one blood all nations of men, for

150
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:10,520
to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before

151
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:16,200
appointed, and the bounds of their habitation." And so we find that Paul is

152
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:22,680
preaching to these idol worshipers, these individuals in Athens that had

153
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:27,500
this plurality of gods, and he says you have this one altar that has this

154
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:32,380
inscription to the unknown God, Him declare I unto you, and he begins to

155
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:37,140
share with the fact that he's creator, and then he deals with the fact of course

156
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:43,140
of the human race being of one blood, and we see that very plainly in the Bible. We

157
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:49,340
find the Bible record is accurate, and it is to be of course giving, it provides

158
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:54,260
for us a biblical worldview. Notice as we continue back in Genesis chapter number

159
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:58,340
nine, not only the replenishing of the earth, but notice the drunkenness of Noah.

160
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:01,660
I'll be honest with you, it's a sad portion of Scripture when we read these

161
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:06,420
verses of Scripture. We find the the wonderful way in which we first were

162
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:11,140
introduced to Noah, as I've mentioned already by way of introduction back in

163
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:14,660
Genesis chapter number six, and now we come here to Genesis chapter number nine,

164
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:19,380
and the Bible tells us in verse number 20, and Noah began to be in husbandmen,

165
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:23,540
and he planted a vineyard. And so the Bible begins to share with us some

166
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:29,500
things with regard to the occupation of Noah, to the life of Noah. Again, there's

167
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:34,140
just a few verses of Scripture that capture a lengthy period of history. As

168
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:38,100
you get to the end of the text of Scripture, the Bible tells us in verse

169
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:44,060
28 that Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years. So obviously God

170
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:49,180
is not providing us with a diary of Noah's life, of all of the events and all

171
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:53,380
of the things that had transpired, but we find here that God is sharing this

172
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:58,220
singular event that took place in the life of Noah, and we find that as he

173
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:04,220
shares this event, he tells us that Noah had this occupation. He began to

174
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:08,220
be in husbandmen, he planted a vineyard. Notice in verse 21, and he drank of the

175
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:13,900
wine and was drunken. The Bible tells us this at the end of verse 21, and he was

176
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:21,020
uncovered within his tent. Really, we could note the shame of Noah in verse

177
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:27,660
number 21. I do not believe for a moment of time that Noah intended for this to

178
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:34,180
be the result of what he did. In fact, as we often would speak about alcohol and

179
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:39,100
we would deal with, you know, wine and alcoholic beverage and that sort of

180
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:43,380
thing, and we look at the biblical context, we can always find within the

181
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:49,980
context of whether the wine is an alcoholic wine or if it's the the fruit

182
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:54,820
of the vine, and we can always determine that contextually as to what takes

183
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:58,820
place. Here, very specifically, the Bible says that he was drunken. It's obviously

184
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:03,780
alcoholic wine in its nature, and then as we see the result, it says that he was

185
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:09,660
uncovered within his tent. There's shame that's associated with this activity

186
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:15,700
that God describes for us here in verse 21. Notice as we come to verse number 22

187
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:22,100
that God gives us the record of the actions of Ham. Of course, Noah has three

188
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:27,580
sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, and we notice here that the Bible tells us specifically

189
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:34,380
about Ham. It tells us this, that Ham—notice this again—the father of Canaan. Now, we

190
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,860
saw this back in verse number 18 when the Bible says the sons of Noah that went

191
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:43,180
forth of the ark were Shem and Ham and Japheth, and then it says this, and Ham is

192
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:49,420
the father of Canaan. We come to verse number 22, and it says, and Ham the father

193
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:53,700
of Canaan. Do you think God wants us to understand something about lineage? He

194
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:58,500
wants us to understand something about the genealogy here, and he mentions twice

195
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:03,040
within just a few verses of Scripture that Ham is the father of Canaan. We'll

196
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,380
get to that in just a few moments, but it is important to make that note. It then

197
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:11,980
continues to say this in verse number 22, that Ham saw the nakedness of his

198
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:17,500
father and told his two brethren without. I will be honest with you,

199
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:22,060
theologians have argued the point for generations as to what this means that

200
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:26,340
Ham did. The Bible doesn't tell specifically what Ham did. The Bible

201
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:31,720
simply reveals to us that he saw his father's nakedness and that he told his

202
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:37,300
two brethren. He did not seek to cover as Shem and Japheth will, and we'll notice

203
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:40,380
that in the next passage of Scripture and the next verse of Scripture, but we

204
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:47,020
find that he, Ham, went in and he saw it, and then he went and told his brethren.

205
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:53,180
Shem and Japheth. We find that upon hearing the news of what had taken place,

206
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:59,420
of the shame, if you will, of Noah as he's in the tent after he had drunk in this

207
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:04,220
wine, that the Bible tells us that Shem and Japheth, in verse number 23, that they

208
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:08,220
took a garment. Notice what the Bible says, and they laid it upon both their

209
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:14,660
shoulders and went backward and covered the nakedness of their father, and their

210
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:20,420
faces were backward and they saw not their father's nakedness. We find that

211
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:25,860
these two boys, they find the entrance to the tent, we'll pretend that it's

212
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:31,540
here, and they get here side by side and they put a, the Bible tells us here in

213
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:36,500
verse number 22, excuse me, 23, they put a garment upon their shoulders and they

214
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:41,420
walked backwards into the tent to cover the nakedness of their father so that

215
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:49,820
they did not see it. We find that there was a difference in action between what

216
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:54,420
the Bible records for us of Ham and what the Bible records for us with regard to

217
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:58,660
Shem and Japheth, and we find that the Bible then tells us that Noah awoke in

218
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:05,100
verse number 24. He woke from his wine, and the Bible says that he knew what his

219
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:11,460
younger son had done unto him. He was aware of that which had transpired, he

220
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:18,660
was aware of what had taken place when he was within his tent. We find that he

221
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:25,860
then, as he has this understanding of the events, God records for us in verses 25

222
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:31,660
through 27, if you're taking notes, number three, the prophecy of Noah. As we look at

223
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:35,460
the prophecy of Noah, we break down these verses of Scripture in verses 25

224
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:39,780
through 27, it actually becomes a little bit clearer as to what happens not only

225
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:45,820
here in Genesis 9, but you'll be familiar with this taking place later in the life

226
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:49,980
of Jacob. Remember when he calls all of his boys around in Genesis chapter

227
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:53,820
number 49, and he's going to give the blessings to all of his sons, and he goes

228
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:58,540
through and he lists each of the sons and he speaks about them and so on and so

229
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:03,900
forth, and we find here that as Noah, the prophecy of Noah is recorded for us in

230
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:10,340
verses 25 through 27. Now it begins in verse number 25 with dealing, and here's

231
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:19,900
what it says, and he said, Cursed be Canaan, a servant of servants shall he be

232
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:27,580
unto his brethren. We understand that as this prophecy of Noah is recorded for us

233
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:33,420
here in verses 25 through 27, that it begins with a curse. We'll find that

234
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:36,980
there's a blessing and an enlargement that is mentioned in verses 26 and 27,

235
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:41,540
but it begins with this curse. It says, Cursed be Canaan. Notice again, if we go

236
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:45,220
back into the text of Scripture, that we've made note that the Bible says that

237
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:50,820
Ham is the father of Canaan, that Ham is the one that went in and saw the

238
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:55,540
nakedness of his father. He saw the shame. Noah was aware of what had taken place.

239
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:59,860
He knew what his younger son had done unto him, and it says, Cursed be Canaan.

240
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:04,660
You understand that the curse that is mentioned here in chapter number 9

241
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:11,960
and verse number 25 is not on all of the descendants of Ham, rather upon the

242
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:16,700
descendants of Canaan. It's important for us to note that. There are some, by the

243
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:22,660
way, that have misapplied and misgiven the interpretation of this passage of

244
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:30,300
Scripture to say something that it does not say. Notice, he says, Cursed be Canaan,

245
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:34,500
and he says this, A servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren. It's

246
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:38,059
interesting, at the end of verse number 26 and at the end of verse number 27, it

247
00:18:38,059 --> 00:18:44,179
says, And Canaan shall be his servant. And Canaan shall be a servant. Can I tell

248
00:18:44,179 --> 00:18:47,660
you that the Canaanites were known for their wickedness and their

249
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:53,340
immorality. As you study the Scriptures and begin to see all that transpires, as

250
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,020
you begin to see the interactions between the children of Israel and the

251
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:59,940
Canaanites, in fact, even within the book of Genesis, you see references to the

252
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:04,900
Canaanites, you see they are known for their wickedness and their

253
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:09,179
immorality. We find that in Genesis chapter number 10, turn over there if you

254
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:13,140
will and look at verses 15 through 19, it's important for us to note this

255
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:17,900
because the Bible says, Cursed be Canaan, and we find that in Genesis 10 verses

256
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:23,619
15 through 19 that God provides us with a list of the descendants of Canaan.

257
00:19:23,619 --> 00:19:30,540
Again, this prophecy of Noah is not on all of the descendants of Ham, it's

258
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:37,140
simply on the Canaanites. Notice in verse number 15 of Genesis 10, And Canaan

259
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:43,700
begat Sidon his firstborn in Heth, and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the

260
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:49,980
Gergesite, and the Hivite, and the Archite, and the Sinite, and the Arvidite, and the

261
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:55,140
Zemurite, and the Hamathite, and afterward were the families of the Canaanites

262
00:19:55,140 --> 00:20:02,059
spread abroad. Verse 19, And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon

263
00:20:02,059 --> 00:20:07,859
as thou goest to Gerir, unto Gaza, as thou goest unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and

264
00:20:07,859 --> 00:20:13,939
Admah, and Zeboiim, even unto Lasha." In fact, as you read the book of Joshua, as

265
00:20:13,939 --> 00:20:18,379
we've been studying the book of Joshua, you'll note many of those places and

266
00:20:18,379 --> 00:20:24,619
many of those names are found within the context of the book of Joshua. We find

267
00:20:24,619 --> 00:20:28,639
here that, as we would think about this curse that's been placed upon Canaan,

268
00:20:28,639 --> 00:20:34,039
this prophecy more than a curse, and we think about it as a prophecy in the

269
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:39,919
sense of, yes, it says, curse it be Canaan, we understand that, but what we find that

270
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:44,519
is happening is Noah is giving this prophecy with regard to the descendants,

271
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:51,119
the wickedness that he saw in Ham, he would see it fully

272
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:57,199
gone in Canaan, his son. And we find that in Genesis chapter 15, let's take a

273
00:20:57,199 --> 00:21:00,839
walk through some scripture here and look at some things with regard to the

274
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:06,319
Canaanites. In Genesis chapter number 15, we often look at the passage of

275
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:10,639
scripture and we deal with this wonderful promise of the Abrahamic

276
00:21:10,639 --> 00:21:15,720
covenant, and what a great promise it is, what a great truth of God's Word, and we

277
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,139
think about the covenant, we've mentioned, even as we've studied through the book

278
00:21:19,139 --> 00:21:26,000
of Hebrews, that the promise is of a land and of a seed, right? Abraham never

279
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:32,479
actually possessed the land that was promised. We find that the seed that

280
00:21:32,479 --> 00:21:38,759
was promised, he did have that son from he and Sarah, Isaac, and we find here that

281
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:43,040
the Bible tells us in chapter number 15 and verse number 16, notice what God

282
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:48,379
says, let me back up to verse number 12, and when the sun was going down, a deep

283
00:21:48,379 --> 00:21:53,000
sleep fell upon Abram, and lo and horror of great darkness fell upon him. And he

284
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,559
said unto Abram, know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land

285
00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:00,759
that is not theirs, and shall serve them, and they shall afflict them four hundred

286
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:06,479
years. And also that nation whom they shall serve will I judge, and afterward

287
00:22:06,479 --> 00:22:11,160
shall they come out with great substance. Knowing the entirety of scripture, does

288
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:15,080
this not sound familiar to you, as to the time in which the children of Israel

289
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:20,720
would spend in Egypt, and they of course would be delivered after the tenth plague,

290
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:24,479
the death of the firstborn, the Passover, and they would come out with great

291
00:22:24,479 --> 00:22:28,399
substance. But notice in verse 15, and thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace,

292
00:22:28,399 --> 00:22:32,479
thou shalt be buried in a good old age, but in the fourth generation they shall

293
00:22:32,479 --> 00:22:38,080
come hither again, notice, for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.

294
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:44,959
And we find here in verse number 16, as God would use this phraseology of the

295
00:22:44,959 --> 00:22:50,000
iniquity of the Amorites, what he's meaning is all of the Canaanite tribes

296
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,160
that were in that region. And we'd understand as he's speaking about all of

297
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:57,639
the Canaanite tribes that are within that region, again, as you look at the

298
00:22:57,639 --> 00:23:01,880
sons of Canaan, and you look and you notate the names that are given there in

299
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:07,880
Genesis chapter number 10, you find that many of them occupied that land when the

300
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:12,239
children of Israel, led by Joshua, would come in to inhabit the land. Now what

301
00:23:12,239 --> 00:23:16,479
happened? We know that God gave the commandment that they were to go in and

302
00:23:16,479 --> 00:23:19,759
they were to conquer the land, right? That's what they were told to do. They

303
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:24,440
were to go in and they were to conquer the land and then inhabit the land. The

304
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:28,160
question that we'd ask is, did they destroy all the Canaanites? The answer is

305
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:34,399
no, they did not. Look over, if you will, at Joshua chapter number 16 and notice

306
00:23:34,399 --> 00:23:40,520
what God shows us here in the portion of Scripture. Now remember, this prophecy of

307
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:44,199
Noah back in Genesis chapter number 9, he says,

308
00:23:45,199 --> 00:23:52,839
Notice, a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren. In Joshua

309
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:58,959
chapter number 16, in verse number 10, notice what the Bible says. This is

310
00:23:58,959 --> 00:24:03,399
speaking of the lot for the inheritance of the children of Joseph, Ephraim,

311
00:24:03,399 --> 00:24:07,959
specifically dealing with the tribe of Ephraim, the Ephraimites. It says this in

312
00:24:07,959 --> 00:24:13,800
verse number 10, and they drave not out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer.

313
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:21,119
Notice, but the Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites unto this day, and what

314
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:28,119
does it say? And serve under tribute. And serve under tribute. What did he say? A

315
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:35,040
servant of servants. Chapter 17, notice in verse number 12, the Bible says here,

316
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:39,399
speaking of the half-tribe of Manasseh, yet the children of Manasseh could not

317
00:24:39,399 --> 00:24:43,959
drive out the inhabitants of those cities, but the Canaanites would dwell in

318
00:24:43,959 --> 00:24:48,239
that land. Yet it came to pass when the children of Israel were waxen strong

319
00:24:48,239 --> 00:24:56,679
that they put the Canaanites to tribute, but did not utterly drive them out. We

320
00:24:56,679 --> 00:25:04,320
find that the descendants of Ham, specifically being the father of Canaan

321
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:10,200
and dealing with this prophecy, he says, cursed be Canaan a servant of servants

322
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:16,000
shall he be unto his brethren, and we see exactly that coming to pass in the book

323
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,239
of Joshua. In fact, if you turn to the book of Judges in the first chapter,

324
00:25:20,239 --> 00:25:25,559
notice what God records for us here. Again, recording some of what we just

325
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:32,839
read in Joshua 16 and 17, notice how the writer notes it here in Judges 1. Judges

326
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:36,440
chapter number 1, beginning in verse number 27, it says, neither did Manasseh

327
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:41,160
drive out the inhabitants of Bethshean and her towns, nor Panach and her towns,

328
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:45,720
nor the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Iblim and her

329
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:50,359
towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns, but the Canaanites would dwell

330
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:54,720
in that land. Verse 28, and it came to pass when Israel was strong that they

331
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:59,480
put the Canaanites to tribute, but did not, and did not, excuse me, utterly drive

332
00:25:59,639 --> 00:26:03,320
them out. Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gizir, but

333
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:07,399
the Canaanites dwelt in Gizir among them. Neither did Zebulun drive out the

334
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:11,519
inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalal, but the Canaanites

335
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:16,320
dwell among them and became tributaries. Neither did Asher drive out the

336
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:22,519
inhabitants of Akot, nor the inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Elab, nor of Exib, nor of

337
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:28,600
Helba, nor of Aphic, nor of Reho, but the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the

338
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:33,079
inhabitants of the land, for they did not drive them out. Neither did Naphtali

339
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:36,880
drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth

340
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:41,720
Anath, but it says he dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the

341
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:45,959
land. Nevertheless, the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh and of Beth Anath became

342
00:26:45,959 --> 00:26:51,399
tributaries unto them. We find that the Bible tells us in verse number 34, and

343
00:26:51,399 --> 00:26:55,040
the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain, for they would not

344
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:58,440
suffer them to come down to the valley, but the Amorites would dwell in Mount

345
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:03,480
Heres and Ajalon, and then shelled them, and the hand of the house of Joseph

346
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:09,160
prevailed, so they became tributaries. And the coast of the Amorites was from the

347
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:14,480
going up to Acribim, from the rock and upward. You notice several times within

348
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,519
the passage in Judges chapter number 1, the Bible mentions the Canaanites

349
00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:23,959
dwelling there and being under tribute, being servants. They would have this

350
00:27:23,959 --> 00:27:28,320
thing of paying taxes and what have you, and really it became this idea, it's very

351
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:32,279
interesting, the Bible says that when Israel was strong, that they put the

352
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:37,040
Canaanites to tribute. In fact, you'll find various interactions throughout the

353
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:41,359
the Old Testament with regard to this people group, the Canaanites as they're

354
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:45,279
referred to as, but you find that when Israel was strong, they would put them

355
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:50,679
to tribute, they would be a servant of servants. In 1 Kings chapter number 9,

356
00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:55,119
we'll finish up with this particular passage of Scripture dealing with this

357
00:27:55,160 --> 00:28:01,480
first aspect of the prophecy of Noah. In 1 Kings chapter number 9, in verses 20

358
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:14,399
and 21. In 1 Kings 9, now think about this, the amount of time that has passed, we go

359
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:19,600
all the way now to the time of Solomon, and it tells us in the beginning of the

360
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,679
passage in verse number 1, and it came to pass when Solomon had finished the

361
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:27,279
building of the house of the Lord, and the king's house, and all Solomon's

362
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:31,679
desire, which he was pleased to do. Now, that's a long period of time from

363
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:37,520
Genesis chapter number 9, and this prophecy of Noah. We see the entrance

364
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,200
into the land, and the way in which the Canaanites became servants, and they were

365
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,400
under tribute, and we've read all of those things, and we now fast forward through

366
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:50,679
the period of the judges, and we get through the period of course of Saul

367
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:55,799
reigning as king, and David reigning as king, and now we find that Solomon is

368
00:28:55,799 --> 00:29:00,520
king, he's built the temple. The Bible tells us here in the passage of Scripture

369
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:04,799
some things about Tyre, and so on and so forth, but look in verse number 20, the

370
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:08,320
Bible says, and all the people that were left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites,

371
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:13,599
Hivites, and Jebusites, which were not of the children of Israel, their children

372
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:17,880
that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel also were

373
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:24,760
not able utterly to destroy, upon those did Solomon levy a tribute of bond

374
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:33,320
service unto this day. And so we find that this prophecy of Noah that is given

375
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:39,679
to us in Genesis chapter number 9, as we trace a course throughout this portion

376
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:45,479
of Old Testament biblical history, we see that it came to pass just as God said it

377
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:51,520
would, through this prophecy that Noah made here in Genesis chapter 9, verse 25,

378
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:57,719
with regard to the Canaanites. Again, it's important that we understand that he's

379
00:29:57,719 --> 00:30:01,960
not speaking about all of the descendants of Ham. In fact, as you get

380
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,460
into Genesis chapter 9, verse 25, we see that he's speaking about the descendants of Ham.

381
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:08,120
to chapter number 10 and you begin to read about the sons of Ham, you start

382
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:12,320
reading in chapter number six, excuse me, in verse number six about the sons of

383
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:18,160
Ham, Cush and Mithraim and Put and Canaan. Canaan wasn't his only son, it was his

384
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:22,520
youngest son and it was the one in which this curse would be upon that they would

385
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:28,760
be again a prophecy that they would be servants of servants unto his brethren.

386
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:32,800
Notice as we move forward through the prophecy we come back to Genesis chapter

387
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:38,440
9 and we look to verse number 26 and the Bible says this, and he said, Noah

388
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:43,480
again continuing to speak, he said, blessed be the Lord God of Shem and

389
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:50,400
Canaan shall be his servant. He says blessed be the Lord God of Shem. It's

390
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:55,000
interesting for we would mention the fact that of course the Jews are

391
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:00,440
Semitic and they come through the line of Shem and we would find that this

392
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:06,080
would be the Messianic line as we speak of. Now, we understand the blessing when

393
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,640
we would consider that truth, amen, and we would understand the blessing.

394
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:13,600
Remember, even as he would give that blessing to Abraham and he would talk

395
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:18,440
about the seed and we find the fulfillment in Galatians very plainly

396
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:24,000
that Paul speaks about the seed, singular, he didn't say seeds, he said seed, this is

397
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,480
Christ, and he mentions how that we are the descendants of Abraham, how? Through

398
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:36,400
faith. And we find the blessing that is here, blessed be the Lord God of Shem,

399
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:41,480
dealing with the fact that the Jews are Semitic, the Messianic line is no doubt

400
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:47,720
in view within the prophecy that is recorded here in verse number 26. We then

401
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:53,480
come to verse number 27 and we find the Bible continues and says, God shall

402
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:59,000
enlarge Japheth and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem and Canaan shall be

403
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,640
his servant. We've dealt with the subject of Canaan in each of these situations. It's

404
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:07,520
interesting that we find here when he speaks about Japheth, he says God shall

405
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:14,120
enlarge Japheth. And we can think about and consider the territorial ways in

406
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:18,200
which the descendants of Japheth went, so on and so forth, and it's kind of an

407
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,600
interesting study. In fact, if you wanted to study all of these lines and kind of

408
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:26,680
see where all of these groups of people went and so on and so forth, because we

409
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:32,640
do understand that of them was the whole earth overspread. And so that's a

410
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:37,520
lot of land, the whole earth, there's just eight people, and of course when we come

411
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:42,600
to Genesis chapter 11 in the Tower of Babel and we see the disbursement of the

412
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:47,520
people and all that that takes place, and we find that this prophecy with regard

413
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:51,960
to Japheth, that God shall enlarge Japheth, but notice this aspect, the Bible

414
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:57,720
says, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem. It's interesting because we really

415
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:03,360
know through this phraseology at the middle there of verse number 27 that the

416
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:08,600
spiritual blessings upon Japheth would come through the God of Shem. Why?

417
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:13,440
Because that's the Messianic line, that's the Lord God, that's our

418
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:20,640
Messiah, and of course we look at this prophecy in verses 25, 26, and 27, and in

419
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,080
fact, again, you could study various things and you could go through all

420
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:29,840
sorts of things to see the way in which throughout history these particular

421
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:35,040
descendants have gone to different places, but what a blessing to understand

422
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:41,340
the way in which God is using this prophecy of Noah and we can see the

423
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:45,900
fulfillment of it. Again, as we look at this passage of Scripture, we see not

424
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:49,980
only the replenishing of the earth, the drunkenness of Noah, the prophecy of Noah,

425
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:53,940
but then we see the death of Noah. Finally, this evening, number four, if

426
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:58,380
you're taking notes, verses 28 and 29, the Bible says this, and Noah lived after the

427
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:07,460
flood 350 years, and all the days of Noah were 950 years, and he died. That's pretty

428
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:14,300
good age, amen? 950. Man. Now, it's interesting as we know what's taking

429
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:19,260
place because really as we begin to understand the time frame, if you will,

430
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:25,180
that Noah and his wife and his boys and their wives, they came off the ark in

431
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:29,260
chapter number 8. Remember we said this, at the end of chapter number 8, the Bible

432
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:32,740
tells us that Noah built an altar unto the Lord. What did he do? He offered burnt

433
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:36,820
offerings on the altar. First things first, the first matter of business was

434
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:40,940
worship. They worship the Lord, they make these offerings, and then we find that

435
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:45,380
God comes and speaks to Noah, he blesses Noah and his kids, he gives them

436
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:49,260
direction with regard to the replenishing of the earth, and he gives

437
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:54,980
the Noahic covenant, and then we find in just these few verses of Scripture, the

438
00:34:54,980 --> 00:35:02,340
entirety of those 350 years wrapped up for us. Now, again, the Bible tells us

439
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:07,660
that Noah was 950 years old and he died. Now, it's interesting that we would

440
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:13,540
understand the age of Noah being mentioned here. It's approximate, and

441
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:18,700
there's some different Bible scholars of yesteryear, of what have you, that have

442
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:24,220
given chronological dates to events in the Scriptures, but roughly speaking, at

443
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:29,580
this particular time in history, the earth was just over 2,000 years old from

444
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:35,620
creation, and so you think about Noah being 950 years old and the earth only

445
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:39,900
being created for a little over 2,000 years. When I say a little over, like 2004,

446
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:44,300
2006, somewhere in that ballpark, number of years since the earth had been

447
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:50,180
created, but Noah was alive for 950 of them. That's almost half of the known

448
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:55,740
human history at that point that Noah was alive for, and we think about it

449
00:35:55,740 --> 00:36:00,500
being summarized for us here in just these few verses of Scripture, and God is

450
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:05,980
giving to us, helping us to see this prophecy of Noah, and again, as we've

451
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:09,980
mentioned throughout the book of Genesis, as we begin to study the

452
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:15,300
foundational nature of these really first 11 chapters of the book of

453
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:19,540
Genesis and how foundational they are for understanding the entirety of

454
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:25,380
Scripture. If you did not have these chapters and these verses and you did

455
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:29,700
not understand some of these things, it would be challenging to have proper

456
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:35,660
interpretation of the balance of Scripture. We find that it's these first

457
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:41,860
11 chapters that are so often under attack by those that do not have a

458
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:46,900
biblical worldview that would like to destroy those that have a biblical

459
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:52,260
worldview. They want to cast doubt as to the historical accuracy of these things.

460
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:56,420
They want to provide various interpretations as to what these things

461
00:36:56,420 --> 00:37:02,300
mean, but we find that God has given us the Word that He has given us. He, in His

462
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:08,700
wisdom, has given us exactly what He has given us, and as we study it and begin to

463
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:14,220
interpret the history from the foundation of God's Word, we are able to

464
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:18,700
come to proper conclusions. It is interesting to note this truth this

465
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:24,300
evening as we think about kind of coming to this end point, if you will, in the

466
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:29,020
book of Genesis. We find that in chapter number 10, of course, the genealogies are

467
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:34,580
provided. We see the sons of Japheth, of Ham, of Shem, and really the entirety of

468
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:38,620
the chapter is given to the genealogies. We then come to chapter number 11 with

469
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:43,380
the Tower of Babel, and at that point we're kind of then going to start

470
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:48,460
dealing with Abraham and going forward into the book of Genesis. And as we think

471
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:53,180
about the foundation, we come to the end of chapter number 10 and look at the

472
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:57,620
death of Noah, and we think about all of these things that have happened, all of

473
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:02,620
these things that we've studied, and we begin to have this biblical worldview, we

474
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:08,580
understand some of, or really all of, we have the understanding of what God is

475
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:16,780
giving us in the New Testament and with His plan as a whole. We have so many

476
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:21,820
people running around today that do not have a biblical worldview that are

477
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:27,460
trying to provide solutions for the world's problems. The solutions for the

478
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:34,060
world's problems are not going to come from something outside of God's Word, and

479
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:42,220
we've had such a move away from the Bible in our nation in the last several

480
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:47,460
generations, away from the Bible, away from God, away from the principles of God,

481
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:53,660
and we've introduced all sorts of other thoughts and mindsets and ideologies

482
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:59,059
that are out there that are permeating the minds of people today that

483
00:38:59,059 --> 00:39:03,380
are not going to adequately provide solutions to the problems that we deal

484
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:09,900
with. In fact, as you look at the way in which the account of these first

485
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:15,100
chapters of Genesis are being attacked, what is it, what is the the biggest way

486
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:21,580
in which they attack? There's no creator, right? This teaching of evolution,

487
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:29,140
this idea of humanism that really comes out of the teaching of Darwinianism and

488
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:35,020
understanding all of their ideologies with regard to undermining the authority

489
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:41,700
of God. Can I tell you that if there is no God, that there is no creator, that

490
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:51,220
there's no purpose? We're just some random chance. That's not true. God has

491
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:57,740
created us. God has given us a purpose. God has given us a plan, and God has

492
00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:02,780
recorded these things for us, and we find that as we look to the Scriptures and we

493
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:06,700
look to the Word of God that we...

494
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:11,820
We must ensure that our mindset is biblical, that our worldview is biblical.

495
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:12,820
There are people...

496
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:17,620
I had someone come to me a couple of years ago now, no one from our church, but someone

497
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:23,700
came to me that had a solid, what I thought, a solid Bible foundation.

498
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:27,920
And they came to me and they said, do you really think there only had to be one Adam

499
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,980
or could there have been many Adams?

500
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:39,140
And they began to ask about the replenishing of the earth after the flood, they began to

501
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:47,260
provide these ideas about various groups of people in various regions of the world.

502
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:52,900
And I simply said, sir, you got to look at the Bible, but how do you know it's true?

503
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:58,460
And what has happened is they began to get attacked and attacked and attacked, and the

504
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:05,180
attack upon the foundation of God's Word, began to mess with the thought process, begin

505
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:11,100
to introduce various ideas and thoughts with regard to human history.

506
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:16,740
But we find that God has given us the truth that He has given us for a purpose.

507
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:21,620
Why did God decide, and I'm not questioning Him, I'm not saying it in this way to question

508
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:28,260
Him, but we look at this and we say, in 350 years, to summarize the life of Noah in verses

509
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:33,820
18 through 29, why is this the content?

510
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:40,060
Why is it that God takes note to tell us, and of them was the whole earth overspread?

511
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:44,080
He wants us to understand the way in which the earth was replenished.

512
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:49,580
He wants us to understand that all mankind was killed during the flood, and all men and

513
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:55,000
every living being, they were all killed, they were destroyed.

514
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,760
He told us specifically who got on the ark.

515
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,780
He told us specifically who got off the ark.

516
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:05,300
Why did He tell us about this event?

517
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:08,180
Why did He tell us about the prophecy?

518
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:14,340
Begin to see the way in which God is unfolding the future events that would happen and how

519
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:21,620
we can look here and see this and begin to interpret properly future events that take

520
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:22,620
place.

521
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:24,820
And it's so important that we understand that.

522
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:30,240
I mean, think about it this morning when we mentioned about the order of Melchizedek.

523
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,360
I was chatting with someone after the service.

524
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:40,480
The reality is that the truth of coming to that messianic psalm in Psalm 110 and thinking

525
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:46,920
about this promise of this one that would come, Messiah, and as the prophecy would be

526
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:52,760
given there, and they would be very familiar with it as they would understand here in Psalm

527
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:58,940
110 in verse number 4, where the Bible tells us, the Lord hath sworn and will not repent.

528
00:42:58,940 --> 00:42:59,940
Notice that terminology.

529
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:05,180
The Lord hath sworn and will not repent, and then it says, thou art a priest forever after

530
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:07,520
the order of Melchizedek.

531
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:11,180
And then they think about Melchizedek, Melchizedek, where do we know that name from?

532
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:14,180
I'm not sure that they would say that, but maybe for us.

533
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:17,540
And they go back to Genesis 14 and they just look at a couple of verses of Scripture and

534
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:21,980
they just, man, how does this all come to pass?

535
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:28,320
We see now living in this day and living and looking back historically, we see how,

536
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:31,720
and Holly and I were talking this afternoon, like the peel of the onion kind of coming

537
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:37,280
off, the wrapping of the present coming off in the presentation.

538
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:43,660
We find this such is the case with this prophecy of Noah recorded in these few verses of Scripture.

539
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:48,480
It helps us to have a proper understanding of all that takes place.

540
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:52,700
You know, there are a lot of people that take the approach that Ham was cursed.

541
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:56,140
It doesn't say that Ham was cursed.

542
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:58,940
It says cursed be Canaan.

543
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:00,660
Amen?

544
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:06,020
They try to make application to certain ethnicities with regard to that curse that is mentioned

545
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:07,840
in Genesis chapter number nine.

546
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:14,320
They were Canaanites that dwell in the land of Canaan, okay?

547
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,740
They were servants of servants.

548
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:22,040
We looked at the passages of Scripture, and so we don't have to come up with some hypothesis

549
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:24,600
of what does this mean and how does this all work out.

550
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:30,080
No, we can go to the Scriptures and we can trace what the Scriptures tell us and we can

551
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,520
see the fulfillment of the prophecy.

552
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:39,660
And I'm thankful that God in His wisdom provided us with the record that He provided us with

553
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:42,160
because He knows exactly what we need.

554
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,680
And we need to be biblical.

555
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:44,680
Amen?

556
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:45,680
We really do.

557
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:48,540
We need to return to the Bible.

558
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:51,160
We need to be biblical people.

559
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:56,660
We need to be in the place where we think and act biblically.

560
00:44:56,660 --> 00:45:02,700
There's so many ideas that are being thrown out in our world today, and it's so dangerous

561
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:07,220
for our young people to kind of get caught up in some of these ideologies and some of

562
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:08,220
these...

563
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:11,740
I mean, listen, they package them neatly and they make it sound really good.

564
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:14,140
I say, hold on a minute.

565
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:16,180
Is it biblical?

566
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:21,820
Because first and foremost, we must have a biblical worldview, and everything will then

567
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:23,700
flow out of that.

568
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:26,980
Genesis chapter 9 records for us the final days of Noah.

569
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:27,980
Let's pray.

570
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:28,980
Father, we love You.

571
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:29,980
We thank You for loving us.

572
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:32,980
Thank You for the Word of God, the truth contained therein.

573
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:35,820
We thank You for the opportunity to study Thy Word.

574
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:44,140
Lord, we thank You for allowing us to have the Bible preserved in our language.

575
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:48,900
We thank You for Your wisdom that's been displayed throughout the book of Genesis.

576
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:53,180
We've seen Your power and Your wisdom on display.

577
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:57,820
God, I pray that You would help us to be biblical.

578
00:45:57,820 --> 00:46:09,540
Lord, to think and act biblically, to consider those things that would be presented to us

579
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:13,340
and take them through the filter of Your Word.

580
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:22,840
Lord, help us not to be deceived by those things that are going on in our society today.

581
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,420
We thank You for Your Word.

582
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:25,660
We thank You for loving us.

583
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:27,700
We pray that You'd give us a good week.

584
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:30,740
Lord, help us to honor You and glorify You.

585
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:33,900
We think of those that are traveling, pray that You'd keep them safe.

586
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:38,900
Lord, help us to be the salt of the earth and the light of the world.

587
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:39,900
We'll thank You for it.

588
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:40,900
In Christ's name we pray.

589
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:41,540
Would you stand with me?
