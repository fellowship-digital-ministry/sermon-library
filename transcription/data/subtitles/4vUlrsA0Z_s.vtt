WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320
Chapter number nine, Genesis chapter number nine this evening, and we'll be finishing

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.520
up Genesis chapter nine, looking at verses 18 through 29 this evening will be our text

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.079
of scripture.

00:00:10.079 --> 00:00:17.239
And if you're taking notes, I've titled the message this evening, Noah's final days.

00:00:17.239 --> 00:00:21.719
And it's kind of interesting because I'll title the message Noah's final days, and it's

00:00:21.719 --> 00:00:26.899
only a few verses of scripture, but it covers about 350 years.

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:32.779
And so it's kind of ironic, but that is the passage that is before us here as we get back

00:00:32.779 --> 00:00:34.060
to the book of Genesis.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.259
We've been studying the book of Genesis.

00:00:35.259 --> 00:00:40.020
Of course, we've taken off several weeks now with some other subjects that we've been dealing

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.020
with.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.180
And this is our 32nd lesson, believe it or not, through the book of Genesis.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.060
I've thoroughly enjoyed the study, and we've been going at it for a lengthy period of time.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.979
We first met Noah back in Genesis chapter number six, in the midst of great wickedness.

00:00:54.979 --> 00:01:00.340
And the Bible tells us that Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.339
And then the Bible tells us this, that Noah walked with God.

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.339
What a great testimony.

00:01:06.339 --> 00:01:10.019
We think about the testimony of Noah, and we think about all of the things that were

00:01:10.019 --> 00:01:14.019
going on as God describes for us in Genesis chapter number six.

00:01:14.019 --> 00:01:18.900
We find that Noah walked with God, and we find that the Bible tells us that Noah found

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.980
grace in the eyes of the Lord.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:28.019
We find that God begins to reveal to Noah the plan that God has to destroy the earth

00:01:28.019 --> 00:01:30.819
and to destroy the inhabitants of the earth.

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:35.980
And we find that in verse number 13, in fact, of Genesis chapter number six, God speaks

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.059
directly to Noah and informs him.

00:01:38.059 --> 00:01:42.860
He says, the end of all flesh has come before me, for the earth is filled with violence

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:43.860
through them.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.819
And behold, I will destroy them with the earth.

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:48.940
He then tells him this.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:55.099
We see the grace of God in verse number 14, make thee an ark of gopher wood, room shalt

00:01:55.099 --> 00:02:00.459
thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:02.500
And God gives him the instruction.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.940
We find that we have noted on several occasions, and we've studied through these portions,

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:13.100
Genesis six through eight, and we've studied the great flood, and we've studied the life

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.899
of Noah, and we have noted the obedience of Noah.

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:21.139
How he obeyed the Lord, how he did what God told him to do.

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:22.139
And what a blessing.

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:26.820
In our last study from the book of Genesis, we actually studied the first half of chapter

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:27.820
number nine.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.899
There's a net up here that's about to drive me crazy.

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:35.100
And so I don't know where the fly went, but if the fly would get the net, I'd be happy.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.779
And in any case, in Genesis chapter number nine, verses one through 17, we dealt with

00:02:39.779 --> 00:02:41.539
the Noahic covenant.

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:45.360
And that was in our last study from the book of Genesis this evening.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.639
As we complete the ninth chapter, we'll see the summary that is given to us with regard

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:52.360
to Noah's final days.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.320
Notice in verse number 18 of Genesis nine, the Bible says, and the sons of Noah that

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.320
went forth of the ark were Shem and Ham and Japheth.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.039
And Ham is the father of Canaan.

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:04.119
These are the three sons of Noah.

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:09.279
Notice this, and of them was the whole earth overspread.

00:03:09.279 --> 00:03:13.960
We'll get through the entirety of the chapter this evening, but let's begin and take some

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:14.960
notes.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.080
Notice number one, the replenishing of the earth.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.800
In verses 18 and 19, as we break down this passage of scripture, we see an important

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.839
truth that is given to us.

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:29.800
The important truth that is given to us is with regard to the replenishing of the earth.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.479
And we find that the Bible says at the end of verse number 19, and of them, who is them?

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:40.479
It's the three sons of Noah, Noah and his wife, his three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:47.800
And we see that the Bible says of them was the whole earth overspread.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:53.440
Now we understand as we've studied here over the last several lessons from the book of

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.240
Genesis and studying in chapter six through eight, we understand that God has given us

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.440
the record of the Noah flood, the global flood.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.000
We understand that it's global in nature.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.080
It was not just a local flood, it was a global flood.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:14.080
In fact, as we looked at the Noahic covenant and we discussed the various aspects of the

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:19.359
covenant that God gave in the first 17 verses here of Genesis chapter number nine, we understood

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.720
again the fact that it was a global flood.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:28.799
Now understand with me, there are some that would seek to promote this idea that there

00:04:28.799 --> 00:04:35.000
are other groups of people on the face of the earth that were somehow sheltered from

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.239
the flood and part of the replenishing of the earth, and there were pockets of population

00:04:41.239 --> 00:04:43.059
in various parts of the earth.

00:04:43.059 --> 00:04:48.799
Can I tell you very firmly that that is not biblically based?

00:04:48.799 --> 00:04:52.640
And we must understand that we approach these things biblically.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:59.799
The Bible must be our guide, and we understand that God gave us very specific things.

00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:03.559
Let's go back to Genesis chapter number six, and I want to just walk through these three

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:09.720
chapters and just point out a few verses of scripture along the way to help us understand.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.959
It was in Genesis chapter number six, we read verse 13, let me read verse number seven to

00:05:13.959 --> 00:05:14.959
you.

00:05:14.959 --> 00:05:19.480
The Bible says in Genesis six and verse number seven, and the Lord said, I will destroy man

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:25.260
whom I have created from the face of the earth, both man and beast and the creeping thing

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:30.040
and the fowls of the air, for it repenteth me that I have made them.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:34.799
And so we find that in Genesis chapter number six, verse number seven and verse number 13,

00:05:34.799 --> 00:05:39.040
both give us the announcement of this judgment that was impending.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:44.600
We find that in Genesis chapter number seven, that the Bible tells us in verse number seven,

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.200
and Noah went in.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.200
What did he go in?

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.760
He went in the ark.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:54.959
Not only did Noah go in, but it says, and his sons and his wife and his son's wives

00:05:54.959 --> 00:05:59.000
with him into the ark because of the waters of the flood.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.200
Let's skip down and look at verse number 13.

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:06.200
The Bible says in the self same day entered Noah and Shem and Ham and Japheth and the

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:14.239
sons of Noah and Noah's wife and the three wives of his sons with them into the ark.

00:06:14.239 --> 00:06:18.640
God gives us a record of the human beings that entered the ark.

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:19.640
There were eight.

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:24.739
In fact, if you look at the new Testament, the Bible talks about the eight persons referring

00:06:24.739 --> 00:06:28.239
to Noah, his wife, his three sons, and their wives.

00:06:28.239 --> 00:06:30.299
These eight entered into the ark.

00:06:30.299 --> 00:06:35.200
We find that in, as you skip down to verse number 21 of Genesis chapter number seven,

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:42.399
the Bible says, and all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl and of cattle

00:06:42.399 --> 00:06:45.760
of beast and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:46.959
What's it say?

00:06:46.959 --> 00:06:52.920
And every man, verse 23, notice the Bible says in every living substance was destroyed,

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:57.720
which was upon the face of the ground, both man and cattle and the creeping things and

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.959
the fowl of the heaven, and they were destroyed from the earth.

00:07:01.959 --> 00:07:07.559
And Noah only remained alive in they that were with him in the ark.

00:07:07.559 --> 00:07:11.440
Aren't you glad that God gave us a record of who went into the ark?

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:13.500
He didn't leave it for our speculation.

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:18.320
He didn't leave it for some theologians or from some whoever group of people to sit around

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:22.279
and say, well, let's think about how big the ark was and let's think about how many could

00:07:22.279 --> 00:07:23.279
have fit on it.

00:07:23.279 --> 00:07:27.600
And this, no, the Bible tells us who went on the ark.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:33.079
And so we find that as we look here in the passage of scripture in chapter six, seven,

00:07:33.079 --> 00:07:38.040
eight, of course, is when the ark, when the waters were assuaged and when the ark rested

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:43.200
and when Noah came off the ark and you find that it was Noah and his wife and his sons

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:48.040
and their wives notice in verse number 18 of chapter number eight, actually back up

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:49.519
to verse number 15.

00:07:49.519 --> 00:07:55.000
And God spake unto Noah saying, go forth of the ark, thou and thy wife and thy sons and

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.760
thy son's wives with thee.

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:00.619
So they all survived during the time on the ark.

00:08:00.619 --> 00:08:05.480
It tells us in verse number 18 and Noah went forth and his sons and his wife and his son's

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:07.380
wives with him.

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:11.799
And as we move into chapter number nine, we find the Bible says in verse number one, and

00:08:11.799 --> 00:08:15.920
God blessed Noah and his sons and said unto them, be fruitful and multiply and replenish

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:16.920
the earth.

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:21.679
And so as we look at this entrance or the beginning of this passage of scripture that

00:08:21.679 --> 00:08:26.279
we're studying this evening and looking at verses 18 and 19, the Bible repeats to us

00:08:26.279 --> 00:08:30.519
again who the sons of Noah are that went forth of the ark.

00:08:30.519 --> 00:08:37.640
And the Bible very clearly teaches us that of them was the whole earth over spread.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:43.440
And so we find biblically speaking, the human race traces its lineage back to Noah, Shem,

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:44.640
Ham, and Japheth.

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:48.159
Of course, they go back to Adam, right?

00:08:48.159 --> 00:08:49.820
The first man.

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:54.619
We read of that, of course, in Genesis one, when God said, let us make man in our own

00:08:54.619 --> 00:08:55.619
image.

00:08:55.619 --> 00:08:58.859
And of course, we understand and we've studied that in the past.

00:08:58.859 --> 00:09:05.059
Notice what the Bible tells us in Acts chapter number 17, in verse number 26, Paul is here

00:09:05.059 --> 00:09:10.260
in this situation and he is going, of course, to Athens and he's preaching there.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:15.299
And we find that he saw a city that was wholly given to idolatry.

00:09:15.299 --> 00:09:20.900
And these people that served idols, they had a whole grove of them, if you will.

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:25.280
And we find that Paul mentioned that as he went through, he noticed that there was one

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:29.140
with the inscription to the unknown God.

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:33.940
And Paul says that you worship him ignorantly.

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:37.700
And then he says this, him declare I unto you.

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:43.020
And then we begin noticing what Paul declares of this God, the Lord God, Jehovah, in verse

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:50.179
number 24 of Acts 17, it says, God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that

00:09:50.179 --> 00:09:55.460
he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands.

00:09:55.460 --> 00:10:00.020
Neither is worship with men's hands as though he needed anything, seeing he giveth to all

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:05.840
life and breath and all things. And hath made of one blood all nations of men, for

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:10.520
to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:16.200
appointed, and the bounds of their habitation." And so we find that Paul is

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:22.680
preaching to these idol worshipers, these individuals in Athens that had

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:27.500
this plurality of gods, and he says you have this one altar that has this

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:32.380
inscription to the unknown God, Him declare I unto you, and he begins to

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:37.140
share with the fact that he's creator, and then he deals with the fact of course

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:43.140
of the human race being of one blood, and we see that very plainly in the Bible. We

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:49.340
find the Bible record is accurate, and it is to be of course giving, it provides

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:54.260
for us a biblical worldview. Notice as we continue back in Genesis chapter number

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:58.340
nine, not only the replenishing of the earth, but notice the drunkenness of Noah.

00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:01.660
I'll be honest with you, it's a sad portion of Scripture when we read these

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:06.420
verses of Scripture. We find the the wonderful way in which we first were

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:11.140
introduced to Noah, as I've mentioned already by way of introduction back in

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:14.660
Genesis chapter number six, and now we come here to Genesis chapter number nine,

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:19.380
and the Bible tells us in verse number 20, and Noah began to be in husbandmen,

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:23.540
and he planted a vineyard. And so the Bible begins to share with us some

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:29.500
things with regard to the occupation of Noah, to the life of Noah. Again, there's

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:34.140
just a few verses of Scripture that capture a lengthy period of history. As

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:38.100
you get to the end of the text of Scripture, the Bible tells us in verse

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:44.060
28 that Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years. So obviously God

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:49.180
is not providing us with a diary of Noah's life, of all of the events and all

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:53.380
of the things that had transpired, but we find here that God is sharing this

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:58.220
singular event that took place in the life of Noah, and we find that as he

00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:04.220
shares this event, he tells us that Noah had this occupation. He began to

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:08.220
be in husbandmen, he planted a vineyard. Notice in verse 21, and he drank of the

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:13.900
wine and was drunken. The Bible tells us this at the end of verse 21, and he was

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:21.020
uncovered within his tent. Really, we could note the shame of Noah in verse

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:27.660
number 21. I do not believe for a moment of time that Noah intended for this to

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:34.180
be the result of what he did. In fact, as we often would speak about alcohol and

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:39.100
we would deal with, you know, wine and alcoholic beverage and that sort of

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:43.380
thing, and we look at the biblical context, we can always find within the

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:49.980
context of whether the wine is an alcoholic wine or if it's the the fruit

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:54.820
of the vine, and we can always determine that contextually as to what takes

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:58.820
place. Here, very specifically, the Bible says that he was drunken. It's obviously

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:03.780
alcoholic wine in its nature, and then as we see the result, it says that he was

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:09.660
uncovered within his tent. There's shame that's associated with this activity

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:15.700
that God describes for us here in verse 21. Notice as we come to verse number 22

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:22.100
that God gives us the record of the actions of Ham. Of course, Noah has three

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:27.580
sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, and we notice here that the Bible tells us specifically

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:34.380
about Ham. It tells us this, that Ham—notice this again—the father of Canaan. Now, we

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:37.860
saw this back in verse number 18 when the Bible says the sons of Noah that went

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:43.180
forth of the ark were Shem and Ham and Japheth, and then it says this, and Ham is

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:49.420
the father of Canaan. We come to verse number 22, and it says, and Ham the father

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:53.700
of Canaan. Do you think God wants us to understand something about lineage? He

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:58.500
wants us to understand something about the genealogy here, and he mentions twice

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:03.040
within just a few verses of Scripture that Ham is the father of Canaan. We'll

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:07.380
get to that in just a few moments, but it is important to make that note. It then

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:11.980
continues to say this in verse number 22, that Ham saw the nakedness of his

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:17.500
father and told his two brethren without. I will be honest with you,

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:22.060
theologians have argued the point for generations as to what this means that

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:26.340
Ham did. The Bible doesn't tell specifically what Ham did. The Bible

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:31.720
simply reveals to us that he saw his father's nakedness and that he told his

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:37.300
two brethren. He did not seek to cover as Shem and Japheth will, and we'll notice

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:40.380
that in the next passage of Scripture and the next verse of Scripture, but we

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:47.020
find that he, Ham, went in and he saw it, and then he went and told his brethren.

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:53.180
Shem and Japheth. We find that upon hearing the news of what had taken place,

00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:59.420
of the shame, if you will, of Noah as he's in the tent after he had drunk in this

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:04.220
wine, that the Bible tells us that Shem and Japheth, in verse number 23, that they

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:08.220
took a garment. Notice what the Bible says, and they laid it upon both their

00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:14.660
shoulders and went backward and covered the nakedness of their father, and their

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:20.420
faces were backward and they saw not their father's nakedness. We find that

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:25.860
these two boys, they find the entrance to the tent, we'll pretend that it's

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:31.540
here, and they get here side by side and they put a, the Bible tells us here in

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:36.500
verse number 22, excuse me, 23, they put a garment upon their shoulders and they

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:41.420
walked backwards into the tent to cover the nakedness of their father so that

00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:49.820
they did not see it. We find that there was a difference in action between what

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:54.420
the Bible records for us of Ham and what the Bible records for us with regard to

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:58.660
Shem and Japheth, and we find that the Bible then tells us that Noah awoke in

00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:05.100
verse number 24. He woke from his wine, and the Bible says that he knew what his

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:11.460
younger son had done unto him. He was aware of that which had transpired, he

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:18.660
was aware of what had taken place when he was within his tent. We find that he

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:25.860
then, as he has this understanding of the events, God records for us in verses 25

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:31.660
through 27, if you're taking notes, number three, the prophecy of Noah. As we look at

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:35.460
the prophecy of Noah, we break down these verses of Scripture in verses 25

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:39.780
through 27, it actually becomes a little bit clearer as to what happens not only

00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:45.820
here in Genesis 9, but you'll be familiar with this taking place later in the life

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:49.980
of Jacob. Remember when he calls all of his boys around in Genesis chapter

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:53.820
number 49, and he's going to give the blessings to all of his sons, and he goes

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:58.540
through and he lists each of the sons and he speaks about them and so on and so

00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:03.900
forth, and we find here that as Noah, the prophecy of Noah is recorded for us in

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:10.340
verses 25 through 27. Now it begins in verse number 25 with dealing, and here's

00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:19.900
what it says, and he said, Cursed be Canaan, a servant of servants shall he be

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:27.580
unto his brethren. We understand that as this prophecy of Noah is recorded for us

00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:33.420
here in verses 25 through 27, that it begins with a curse. We'll find that

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:36.980
there's a blessing and an enlargement that is mentioned in verses 26 and 27,

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:41.540
but it begins with this curse. It says, Cursed be Canaan. Notice again, if we go

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:45.220
back into the text of Scripture, that we've made note that the Bible says that

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:50.820
Ham is the father of Canaan, that Ham is the one that went in and saw the

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:55.540
nakedness of his father. He saw the shame. Noah was aware of what had taken place.

00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:59.860
He knew what his younger son had done unto him, and it says, Cursed be Canaan.

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:04.660
You understand that the curse that is mentioned here in chapter number 9

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:11.960
and verse number 25 is not on all of the descendants of Ham, rather upon the

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:16.700
descendants of Canaan. It's important for us to note that. There are some, by the

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:22.660
way, that have misapplied and misgiven the interpretation of this passage of

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:30.300
Scripture to say something that it does not say. Notice, he says, Cursed be Canaan,

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:34.500
and he says this, A servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren. It's

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:38.059
interesting, at the end of verse number 26 and at the end of verse number 27, it

00:18:38.059 --> 00:18:44.179
says, And Canaan shall be his servant. And Canaan shall be a servant. Can I tell

00:18:44.179 --> 00:18:47.660
you that the Canaanites were known for their wickedness and their

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:53.340
immorality. As you study the Scriptures and begin to see all that transpires, as

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:56.020
you begin to see the interactions between the children of Israel and the

00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:59.940
Canaanites, in fact, even within the book of Genesis, you see references to the

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:04.900
Canaanites, you see they are known for their wickedness and their

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:09.179
immorality. We find that in Genesis chapter number 10, turn over there if you

00:19:09.179 --> 00:19:13.140
will and look at verses 15 through 19, it's important for us to note this

00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:17.900
because the Bible says, Cursed be Canaan, and we find that in Genesis 10 verses

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:23.619
15 through 19 that God provides us with a list of the descendants of Canaan.

00:19:23.619 --> 00:19:30.540
Again, this prophecy of Noah is not on all of the descendants of Ham, it's

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:37.140
simply on the Canaanites. Notice in verse number 15 of Genesis 10, And Canaan

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:43.700
begat Sidon his firstborn in Heth, and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:49.980
Gergesite, and the Hivite, and the Archite, and the Sinite, and the Arvidite, and the

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:55.140
Zemurite, and the Hamathite, and afterward were the families of the Canaanites

00:19:55.140 --> 00:20:02.059
spread abroad. Verse 19, And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon

00:20:02.059 --> 00:20:07.859
as thou goest to Gerir, unto Gaza, as thou goest unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and

00:20:07.859 --> 00:20:13.939
Admah, and Zeboiim, even unto Lasha." In fact, as you read the book of Joshua, as

00:20:13.939 --> 00:20:18.379
we've been studying the book of Joshua, you'll note many of those places and

00:20:18.379 --> 00:20:24.619
many of those names are found within the context of the book of Joshua. We find

00:20:24.619 --> 00:20:28.639
here that, as we would think about this curse that's been placed upon Canaan,

00:20:28.639 --> 00:20:34.039
this prophecy more than a curse, and we think about it as a prophecy in the

00:20:34.039 --> 00:20:39.919
sense of, yes, it says, curse it be Canaan, we understand that, but what we find that

00:20:39.919 --> 00:20:44.519
is happening is Noah is giving this prophecy with regard to the descendants,

00:20:44.519 --> 00:20:51.119
the wickedness that he saw in Ham, he would see it fully

00:20:51.119 --> 00:20:57.199
gone in Canaan, his son. And we find that in Genesis chapter 15, let's take a

00:20:57.199 --> 00:21:00.839
walk through some scripture here and look at some things with regard to the

00:21:00.839 --> 00:21:06.319
Canaanites. In Genesis chapter number 15, we often look at the passage of

00:21:06.319 --> 00:21:10.639
scripture and we deal with this wonderful promise of the Abrahamic

00:21:10.639 --> 00:21:15.720
covenant, and what a great promise it is, what a great truth of God's Word, and we

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:19.139
think about the covenant, we've mentioned, even as we've studied through the book

00:21:19.139 --> 00:21:26.000
of Hebrews, that the promise is of a land and of a seed, right? Abraham never

00:21:26.079 --> 00:21:32.479
actually possessed the land that was promised. We find that the seed that

00:21:32.479 --> 00:21:38.759
was promised, he did have that son from he and Sarah, Isaac, and we find here that

00:21:38.759 --> 00:21:43.040
the Bible tells us in chapter number 15 and verse number 16, notice what God

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:48.379
says, let me back up to verse number 12, and when the sun was going down, a deep

00:21:48.379 --> 00:21:53.000
sleep fell upon Abram, and lo and horror of great darkness fell upon him. And he

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.559
said unto Abram, know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land

00:21:56.559 --> 00:22:00.759
that is not theirs, and shall serve them, and they shall afflict them four hundred

00:22:00.759 --> 00:22:06.479
years. And also that nation whom they shall serve will I judge, and afterward

00:22:06.479 --> 00:22:11.160
shall they come out with great substance. Knowing the entirety of scripture, does

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:15.080
this not sound familiar to you, as to the time in which the children of Israel

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:20.720
would spend in Egypt, and they of course would be delivered after the tenth plague,

00:22:20.759 --> 00:22:24.479
the death of the firstborn, the Passover, and they would come out with great

00:22:24.479 --> 00:22:28.399
substance. But notice in verse 15, and thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace,

00:22:28.399 --> 00:22:32.479
thou shalt be buried in a good old age, but in the fourth generation they shall

00:22:32.479 --> 00:22:38.080
come hither again, notice, for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:44.959
And we find here in verse number 16, as God would use this phraseology of the

00:22:44.959 --> 00:22:50.000
iniquity of the Amorites, what he's meaning is all of the Canaanite tribes

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.160
that were in that region. And we'd understand as he's speaking about all of

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:57.639
the Canaanite tribes that are within that region, again, as you look at the

00:22:57.639 --> 00:23:01.880
sons of Canaan, and you look and you notate the names that are given there in

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:07.880
Genesis chapter number 10, you find that many of them occupied that land when the

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:12.239
children of Israel, led by Joshua, would come in to inhabit the land. Now what

00:23:12.239 --> 00:23:16.479
happened? We know that God gave the commandment that they were to go in and

00:23:16.479 --> 00:23:19.759
they were to conquer the land, right? That's what they were told to do. They

00:23:19.759 --> 00:23:24.440
were to go in and they were to conquer the land and then inhabit the land. The

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:28.160
question that we'd ask is, did they destroy all the Canaanites? The answer is

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:34.399
no, they did not. Look over, if you will, at Joshua chapter number 16 and notice

00:23:34.399 --> 00:23:40.520
what God shows us here in the portion of Scripture. Now remember, this prophecy of

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:44.199
Noah back in Genesis chapter number 9, he says,

00:23:45.199 --> 00:23:52.839
Notice, a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren. In Joshua

00:23:52.839 --> 00:23:58.959
chapter number 16, in verse number 10, notice what the Bible says. This is

00:23:58.959 --> 00:24:03.399
speaking of the lot for the inheritance of the children of Joseph, Ephraim,

00:24:03.399 --> 00:24:07.959
specifically dealing with the tribe of Ephraim, the Ephraimites. It says this in

00:24:07.959 --> 00:24:13.800
verse number 10, and they drave not out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer.

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:21.119
Notice, but the Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites unto this day, and what

00:24:21.119 --> 00:24:28.119
does it say? And serve under tribute. And serve under tribute. What did he say? A

00:24:28.119 --> 00:24:35.040
servant of servants. Chapter 17, notice in verse number 12, the Bible says here,

00:24:35.119 --> 00:24:39.399
speaking of the half-tribe of Manasseh, yet the children of Manasseh could not

00:24:39.399 --> 00:24:43.959
drive out the inhabitants of those cities, but the Canaanites would dwell in

00:24:43.959 --> 00:24:48.239
that land. Yet it came to pass when the children of Israel were waxen strong

00:24:48.239 --> 00:24:56.679
that they put the Canaanites to tribute, but did not utterly drive them out. We

00:24:56.679 --> 00:25:04.320
find that the descendants of Ham, specifically being the father of Canaan

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:10.200
and dealing with this prophecy, he says, cursed be Canaan a servant of servants

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:16.000
shall he be unto his brethren, and we see exactly that coming to pass in the book

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.239
of Joshua. In fact, if you turn to the book of Judges in the first chapter,

00:25:20.239 --> 00:25:25.559
notice what God records for us here. Again, recording some of what we just

00:25:25.559 --> 00:25:32.839
read in Joshua 16 and 17, notice how the writer notes it here in Judges 1. Judges

00:25:32.839 --> 00:25:36.440
chapter number 1, beginning in verse number 27, it says, neither did Manasseh

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:41.160
drive out the inhabitants of Bethshean and her towns, nor Panach and her towns,

00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:45.720
nor the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Iblim and her

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:50.359
towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns, but the Canaanites would dwell

00:25:50.359 --> 00:25:54.720
in that land. Verse 28, and it came to pass when Israel was strong that they

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:59.480
put the Canaanites to tribute, but did not, and did not, excuse me, utterly drive

00:25:59.639 --> 00:26:03.320
them out. Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gizir, but

00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:07.399
the Canaanites dwelt in Gizir among them. Neither did Zebulun drive out the

00:26:07.399 --> 00:26:11.519
inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalal, but the Canaanites

00:26:11.519 --> 00:26:16.320
dwell among them and became tributaries. Neither did Asher drive out the

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:22.519
inhabitants of Akot, nor the inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Elab, nor of Exib, nor of

00:26:22.519 --> 00:26:28.600
Helba, nor of Aphic, nor of Reho, but the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:33.079
inhabitants of the land, for they did not drive them out. Neither did Naphtali

00:26:33.079 --> 00:26:36.880
drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:41.720
Anath, but it says he dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the

00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:45.959
land. Nevertheless, the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh and of Beth Anath became

00:26:45.959 --> 00:26:51.399
tributaries unto them. We find that the Bible tells us in verse number 34, and

00:26:51.399 --> 00:26:55.040
the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain, for they would not

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:58.440
suffer them to come down to the valley, but the Amorites would dwell in Mount

00:26:58.559 --> 00:27:03.480
Heres and Ajalon, and then shelled them, and the hand of the house of Joseph

00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:09.160
prevailed, so they became tributaries. And the coast of the Amorites was from the

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:14.480
going up to Acribim, from the rock and upward. You notice several times within

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:18.519
the passage in Judges chapter number 1, the Bible mentions the Canaanites

00:27:18.519 --> 00:27:23.959
dwelling there and being under tribute, being servants. They would have this

00:27:23.959 --> 00:27:28.320
thing of paying taxes and what have you, and really it became this idea, it's very

00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:32.279
interesting, the Bible says that when Israel was strong, that they put the

00:27:32.279 --> 00:27:37.040
Canaanites to tribute. In fact, you'll find various interactions throughout the

00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:41.359
the Old Testament with regard to this people group, the Canaanites as they're

00:27:41.359 --> 00:27:45.279
referred to as, but you find that when Israel was strong, they would put them

00:27:45.279 --> 00:27:50.679
to tribute, they would be a servant of servants. In 1 Kings chapter number 9,

00:27:50.679 --> 00:27:55.119
we'll finish up with this particular passage of Scripture dealing with this

00:27:55.160 --> 00:28:01.480
first aspect of the prophecy of Noah. In 1 Kings chapter number 9, in verses 20

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:14.399
and 21. In 1 Kings 9, now think about this, the amount of time that has passed, we go

00:28:14.399 --> 00:28:19.600
all the way now to the time of Solomon, and it tells us in the beginning of the

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:23.679
passage in verse number 1, and it came to pass when Solomon had finished the

00:28:23.679 --> 00:28:27.279
building of the house of the Lord, and the king's house, and all Solomon's

00:28:27.279 --> 00:28:31.679
desire, which he was pleased to do. Now, that's a long period of time from

00:28:31.679 --> 00:28:37.520
Genesis chapter number 9, and this prophecy of Noah. We see the entrance

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:41.200
into the land, and the way in which the Canaanites became servants, and they were

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:45.400
under tribute, and we've read all of those things, and we now fast forward through

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:50.679
the period of the judges, and we get through the period of course of Saul

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:55.799
reigning as king, and David reigning as king, and now we find that Solomon is

00:28:55.799 --> 00:29:00.520
king, he's built the temple. The Bible tells us here in the passage of Scripture

00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:04.799
some things about Tyre, and so on and so forth, but look in verse number 20, the

00:29:04.799 --> 00:29:08.320
Bible says, and all the people that were left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites,

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:13.599
Hivites, and Jebusites, which were not of the children of Israel, their children

00:29:13.599 --> 00:29:17.880
that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel also were

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:24.760
not able utterly to destroy, upon those did Solomon levy a tribute of bond

00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:33.320
service unto this day. And so we find that this prophecy of Noah that is given

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:39.679
to us in Genesis chapter number 9, as we trace a course throughout this portion

00:29:39.679 --> 00:29:45.479
of Old Testament biblical history, we see that it came to pass just as God said it

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:51.520
would, through this prophecy that Noah made here in Genesis chapter 9, verse 25,

00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:57.719
with regard to the Canaanites. Again, it's important that we understand that he's

00:29:57.719 --> 00:30:01.960
not speaking about all of the descendants of Ham. In fact, as you get

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:04.460
into Genesis chapter 9, verse 25, we see that he's speaking about the descendants of Ham.

00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:08.120
to chapter number 10 and you begin to read about the sons of Ham, you start

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:12.320
reading in chapter number six, excuse me, in verse number six about the sons of

00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:18.160
Ham, Cush and Mithraim and Put and Canaan. Canaan wasn't his only son, it was his

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:22.520
youngest son and it was the one in which this curse would be upon that they would

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:28.760
be again a prophecy that they would be servants of servants unto his brethren.

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:32.800
Notice as we move forward through the prophecy we come back to Genesis chapter

00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:38.440
9 and we look to verse number 26 and the Bible says this, and he said, Noah

00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:43.480
again continuing to speak, he said, blessed be the Lord God of Shem and

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:50.400
Canaan shall be his servant. He says blessed be the Lord God of Shem. It's

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:55.000
interesting for we would mention the fact that of course the Jews are

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:00.440
Semitic and they come through the line of Shem and we would find that this

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:06.080
would be the Messianic line as we speak of. Now, we understand the blessing when

00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:09.640
we would consider that truth, amen, and we would understand the blessing.

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:13.600
Remember, even as he would give that blessing to Abraham and he would talk

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:18.440
about the seed and we find the fulfillment in Galatians very plainly

00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:24.000
that Paul speaks about the seed, singular, he didn't say seeds, he said seed, this is

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:29.480
Christ, and he mentions how that we are the descendants of Abraham, how? Through

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:36.400
faith. And we find the blessing that is here, blessed be the Lord God of Shem,

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:41.480
dealing with the fact that the Jews are Semitic, the Messianic line is no doubt

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:47.720
in view within the prophecy that is recorded here in verse number 26. We then

00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:53.480
come to verse number 27 and we find the Bible continues and says, God shall

00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:59.000
enlarge Japheth and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem and Canaan shall be

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:03.640
his servant. We've dealt with the subject of Canaan in each of these situations. It's

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:07.520
interesting that we find here when he speaks about Japheth, he says God shall

00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:14.120
enlarge Japheth. And we can think about and consider the territorial ways in

00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:18.200
which the descendants of Japheth went, so on and so forth, and it's kind of an

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:21.600
interesting study. In fact, if you wanted to study all of these lines and kind of

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:26.680
see where all of these groups of people went and so on and so forth, because we

00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:32.640
do understand that of them was the whole earth overspread. And so that's a

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:37.520
lot of land, the whole earth, there's just eight people, and of course when we come

00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:42.600
to Genesis chapter 11 in the Tower of Babel and we see the disbursement of the

00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:47.520
people and all that that takes place, and we find that this prophecy with regard

00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:51.960
to Japheth, that God shall enlarge Japheth, but notice this aspect, the Bible

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:57.720
says, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem. It's interesting because we really

00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:03.360
know through this phraseology at the middle there of verse number 27 that the

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:08.600
spiritual blessings upon Japheth would come through the God of Shem. Why?

00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:13.440
Because that's the Messianic line, that's the Lord God, that's our

00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:20.640
Messiah, and of course we look at this prophecy in verses 25, 26, and 27, and in

00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:24.080
fact, again, you could study various things and you could go through all

00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:29.840
sorts of things to see the way in which throughout history these particular

00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:35.040
descendants have gone to different places, but what a blessing to understand

00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:41.340
the way in which God is using this prophecy of Noah and we can see the

00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:45.900
fulfillment of it. Again, as we look at this passage of Scripture, we see not

00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:49.980
only the replenishing of the earth, the drunkenness of Noah, the prophecy of Noah,

00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:53.940
but then we see the death of Noah. Finally, this evening, number four, if

00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:58.380
you're taking notes, verses 28 and 29, the Bible says this, and Noah lived after the

00:33:58.380 --> 00:34:07.460
flood 350 years, and all the days of Noah were 950 years, and he died. That's pretty

00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:14.300
good age, amen? 950. Man. Now, it's interesting as we know what's taking

00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:19.260
place because really as we begin to understand the time frame, if you will,

00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:25.180
that Noah and his wife and his boys and their wives, they came off the ark in

00:34:25.180 --> 00:34:29.260
chapter number 8. Remember we said this, at the end of chapter number 8, the Bible

00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:32.740
tells us that Noah built an altar unto the Lord. What did he do? He offered burnt

00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:36.820
offerings on the altar. First things first, the first matter of business was

00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:40.940
worship. They worship the Lord, they make these offerings, and then we find that

00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:45.380
God comes and speaks to Noah, he blesses Noah and his kids, he gives them

00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:49.260
direction with regard to the replenishing of the earth, and he gives

00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:54.980
the Noahic covenant, and then we find in just these few verses of Scripture, the

00:34:54.980 --> 00:35:02.340
entirety of those 350 years wrapped up for us. Now, again, the Bible tells us

00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:07.660
that Noah was 950 years old and he died. Now, it's interesting that we would

00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:13.540
understand the age of Noah being mentioned here. It's approximate, and

00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:18.700
there's some different Bible scholars of yesteryear, of what have you, that have

00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:24.220
given chronological dates to events in the Scriptures, but roughly speaking, at

00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:29.580
this particular time in history, the earth was just over 2,000 years old from

00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:35.620
creation, and so you think about Noah being 950 years old and the earth only

00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:39.900
being created for a little over 2,000 years. When I say a little over, like 2004,

00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:44.300
2006, somewhere in that ballpark, number of years since the earth had been

00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:50.180
created, but Noah was alive for 950 of them. That's almost half of the known

00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:55.740
human history at that point that Noah was alive for, and we think about it

00:35:55.740 --> 00:36:00.500
being summarized for us here in just these few verses of Scripture, and God is

00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:05.980
giving to us, helping us to see this prophecy of Noah, and again, as we've

00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:09.980
mentioned throughout the book of Genesis, as we begin to study the

00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:15.300
foundational nature of these really first 11 chapters of the book of

00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:19.540
Genesis and how foundational they are for understanding the entirety of

00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:25.380
Scripture. If you did not have these chapters and these verses and you did

00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:29.700
not understand some of these things, it would be challenging to have proper

00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:35.660
interpretation of the balance of Scripture. We find that it's these first

00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:41.860
11 chapters that are so often under attack by those that do not have a

00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:46.900
biblical worldview that would like to destroy those that have a biblical

00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:52.260
worldview. They want to cast doubt as to the historical accuracy of these things.

00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:56.420
They want to provide various interpretations as to what these things

00:36:56.420 --> 00:37:02.300
mean, but we find that God has given us the Word that He has given us. He, in His

00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:08.700
wisdom, has given us exactly what He has given us, and as we study it and begin to

00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:14.220
interpret the history from the foundation of God's Word, we are able to

00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:18.700
come to proper conclusions. It is interesting to note this truth this

00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:24.300
evening as we think about kind of coming to this end point, if you will, in the

00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:29.020
book of Genesis. We find that in chapter number 10, of course, the genealogies are

00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:34.580
provided. We see the sons of Japheth, of Ham, of Shem, and really the entirety of

00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:38.620
the chapter is given to the genealogies. We then come to chapter number 11 with

00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:43.380
the Tower of Babel, and at that point we're kind of then going to start

00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:48.460
dealing with Abraham and going forward into the book of Genesis. And as we think

00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:53.180
about the foundation, we come to the end of chapter number 10 and look at the

00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:57.620
death of Noah, and we think about all of these things that have happened, all of

00:37:57.620 --> 00:38:02.620
these things that we've studied, and we begin to have this biblical worldview, we

00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:08.580
understand some of, or really all of, we have the understanding of what God is

00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:16.780
giving us in the New Testament and with His plan as a whole. We have so many

00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:21.820
people running around today that do not have a biblical worldview that are

00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:27.460
trying to provide solutions for the world's problems. The solutions for the

00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:34.060
world's problems are not going to come from something outside of God's Word, and

00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:42.220
we've had such a move away from the Bible in our nation in the last several

00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:47.460
generations, away from the Bible, away from God, away from the principles of God,

00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:53.660
and we've introduced all sorts of other thoughts and mindsets and ideologies

00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:59.059
that are out there that are permeating the minds of people today that

00:38:59.059 --> 00:39:03.380
are not going to adequately provide solutions to the problems that we deal

00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:09.900
with. In fact, as you look at the way in which the account of these first

00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:15.100
chapters of Genesis are being attacked, what is it, what is the the biggest way

00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:21.580
in which they attack? There's no creator, right? This teaching of evolution,

00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:29.140
this idea of humanism that really comes out of the teaching of Darwinianism and

00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:35.020
understanding all of their ideologies with regard to undermining the authority

00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:41.700
of God. Can I tell you that if there is no God, that there is no creator, that

00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:51.220
there's no purpose? We're just some random chance. That's not true. God has

00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:57.740
created us. God has given us a purpose. God has given us a plan, and God has

00:39:57.740 --> 00:40:02.780
recorded these things for us, and we find that as we look to the Scriptures and we

00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:06.700
look to the Word of God that we...

00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:11.820
We must ensure that our mindset is biblical, that our worldview is biblical.

00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:12.820
There are people...

00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:17.620
I had someone come to me a couple of years ago now, no one from our church, but someone

00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:23.700
came to me that had a solid, what I thought, a solid Bible foundation.

00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:27.920
And they came to me and they said, do you really think there only had to be one Adam

00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:31.980
or could there have been many Adams?

00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:39.140
And they began to ask about the replenishing of the earth after the flood, they began to

00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:47.260
provide these ideas about various groups of people in various regions of the world.

00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:52.900
And I simply said, sir, you got to look at the Bible, but how do you know it's true?

00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:58.460
And what has happened is they began to get attacked and attacked and attacked, and the

00:40:58.460 --> 00:41:05.180
attack upon the foundation of God's Word, began to mess with the thought process, begin

00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:11.100
to introduce various ideas and thoughts with regard to human history.

00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:16.740
But we find that God has given us the truth that He has given us for a purpose.

00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:21.620
Why did God decide, and I'm not questioning Him, I'm not saying it in this way to question

00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:28.260
Him, but we look at this and we say, in 350 years, to summarize the life of Noah in verses

00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:33.820
18 through 29, why is this the content?

00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:40.060
Why is it that God takes note to tell us, and of them was the whole earth overspread?

00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:44.080
He wants us to understand the way in which the earth was replenished.

00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:49.580
He wants us to understand that all mankind was killed during the flood, and all men and

00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:55.000
every living being, they were all killed, they were destroyed.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.760
He told us specifically who got on the ark.

00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:01.780
He told us specifically who got off the ark.

00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:05.300
Why did He tell us about this event?

00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:08.180
Why did He tell us about the prophecy?

00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:14.340
Begin to see the way in which God is unfolding the future events that would happen and how

00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:21.620
we can look here and see this and begin to interpret properly future events that take

00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:22.620
place.

00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:24.820
And it's so important that we understand that.

00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:30.240
I mean, think about it this morning when we mentioned about the order of Melchizedek.

00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:33.360
I was chatting with someone after the service.

00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:40.480
The reality is that the truth of coming to that messianic psalm in Psalm 110 and thinking

00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:46.920
about this promise of this one that would come, Messiah, and as the prophecy would be

00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:52.760
given there, and they would be very familiar with it as they would understand here in Psalm

00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:58.940
110 in verse number 4, where the Bible tells us, the Lord hath sworn and will not repent.

00:42:58.940 --> 00:42:59.940
Notice that terminology.

00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:05.180
The Lord hath sworn and will not repent, and then it says, thou art a priest forever after

00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:07.520
the order of Melchizedek.

00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:11.180
And then they think about Melchizedek, Melchizedek, where do we know that name from?

00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:14.180
I'm not sure that they would say that, but maybe for us.

00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:17.540
And they go back to Genesis 14 and they just look at a couple of verses of Scripture and

00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:21.980
they just, man, how does this all come to pass?

00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:28.320
We see now living in this day and living and looking back historically, we see how,

00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:31.720
and Holly and I were talking this afternoon, like the peel of the onion kind of coming

00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:37.280
off, the wrapping of the present coming off in the presentation.

00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:43.660
We find this such is the case with this prophecy of Noah recorded in these few verses of Scripture.

00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:48.480
It helps us to have a proper understanding of all that takes place.

00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:52.700
You know, there are a lot of people that take the approach that Ham was cursed.

00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:56.140
It doesn't say that Ham was cursed.

00:43:56.140 --> 00:43:58.940
It says cursed be Canaan.

00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:00.660
Amen?

00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:06.020
They try to make application to certain ethnicities with regard to that curse that is mentioned

00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:07.840
in Genesis chapter number nine.

00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:14.320
They were Canaanites that dwell in the land of Canaan, okay?

00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:16.740
They were servants of servants.

00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:22.040
We looked at the passages of Scripture, and so we don't have to come up with some hypothesis

00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:24.600
of what does this mean and how does this all work out.

00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:30.080
No, we can go to the Scriptures and we can trace what the Scriptures tell us and we can

00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:32.520
see the fulfillment of the prophecy.

00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:39.660
And I'm thankful that God in His wisdom provided us with the record that He provided us with

00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:42.160
because He knows exactly what we need.

00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:43.680
And we need to be biblical.

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:44.680
Amen?

00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:45.680
We really do.

00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:48.540
We need to return to the Bible.

00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:51.160
We need to be biblical people.

00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:56.660
We need to be in the place where we think and act biblically.

00:44:56.660 --> 00:45:02.700
There's so many ideas that are being thrown out in our world today, and it's so dangerous

00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:07.220
for our young people to kind of get caught up in some of these ideologies and some of

00:45:07.220 --> 00:45:08.220
these...

00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:11.740
I mean, listen, they package them neatly and they make it sound really good.

00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:14.140
I say, hold on a minute.

00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:16.180
Is it biblical?

00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:21.820
Because first and foremost, we must have a biblical worldview, and everything will then

00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:23.700
flow out of that.

00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:26.980
Genesis chapter 9 records for us the final days of Noah.

00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:27.980
Let's pray.

00:45:27.980 --> 00:45:28.980
Father, we love You.

00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:29.980
We thank You for loving us.

00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:32.980
Thank You for the Word of God, the truth contained therein.

00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:35.820
We thank You for the opportunity to study Thy Word.

00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:44.140
Lord, we thank You for allowing us to have the Bible preserved in our language.

00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:48.900
We thank You for Your wisdom that's been displayed throughout the book of Genesis.

00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:53.180
We've seen Your power and Your wisdom on display.

00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:57.820
God, I pray that You would help us to be biblical.

00:45:57.820 --> 00:46:09.540
Lord, to think and act biblically, to consider those things that would be presented to us

00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:13.340
and take them through the filter of Your Word.

00:46:13.340 --> 00:46:22.840
Lord, help us not to be deceived by those things that are going on in our society today.

00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:24.420
We thank You for Your Word.

00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:25.660
We thank You for loving us.

00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:27.700
We pray that You'd give us a good week.

00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:30.740
Lord, help us to honor You and glorify You.

00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:33.900
We think of those that are traveling, pray that You'd keep them safe.

00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:38.900
Lord, help us to be the salt of the earth and the light of the world.

00:46:38.900 --> 00:46:39.900
We'll thank You for it.

00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:40.900
In Christ's name we pray.

00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:41.540
Would you stand with me?
