WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.400
As we continue with this study that we started a few weeks ago here on Wednesday evenings,

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.000
I've titled the series, The Danger of Deception.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.959
Of course, in that first message, we took the time to review a number of verses throughout

00:00:16.959 --> 00:00:22.159
the Word of God and understanding that we are living in an age of deception, and we

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:27.639
understand that God has given us the remedy for deception, and that is truth.

00:00:27.639 --> 00:00:33.040
I'm thankful that we have the Word of God, and he said, sanctify them through thy Word.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.479
Thy Word is truth.

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:44.319
And there's a whole, just a large group of people in our society, in our world, that

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:47.040
have been deceived, and they don't have truth.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.400
They've been lied to, and I'm thankful that God has given us truth.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.979
I'm thankful that we have the Word of God.

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:57.880
And this evening, as we look at this particular passage of Scripture, and really a single

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:04.959
verse of Scripture, as we'll use as a springboard into our message this evening, there's a phrase

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:11.519
that my understanding is that the phrase has been around for decades, however, it's just

00:01:11.519 --> 00:01:15.680
been in the last 18 months that I have become familiar with this phrase.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.860
It's a phrase that I was not really accustomed to hearing, and one in which we hear quite

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.419
frequently these days, and that is the phrase, social distancing.

00:01:27.419 --> 00:01:30.099
And we, of course, understand that phrase.

00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:34.580
In fact, we were driving yesterday, Joseph was with me, and there was a vehicle, and

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.260
on the back of the vehicle it said, social distancing, please keep your distance.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.559
And he said, why do they have that on their car?

00:01:42.559 --> 00:01:47.620
But it's a phrase that my understanding is it's been around for decades, but really,

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:53.419
I never had heard the phrase, at least not that, certainly not as often as I've heard

00:01:53.419 --> 00:01:55.540
it in the last 18 months.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.059
But I want to preach a message this evening from this thought in 1 Corinthians 15, and

00:02:00.059 --> 00:02:04.980
I have titled the message, spiritual distancing.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.979
You know, we get all caught up with this idea of social distancing, and we've heard it,

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.979
and we've heard it, and we've heard it, and the idea that those that have used this term

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:22.179
repeatedly is that you need to practice social distancing so that you are not infected by

00:02:22.179 --> 00:02:23.660
some virus.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.259
That's really the nutshell of what they're seeking to communicate through their phraseology

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:34.979
that has become so popular and so well-known in these days in which we live.

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:41.720
But I would submit to you that as the people of God, we need to be aware of the responsibility

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:48.479
and the importance of this idea of spiritual distancing, this idea of keeping ourselves

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:54.360
pure and keeping ourselves clean and keeping ourselves unspotted from the world.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.600
We find in 1 Corinthians 15 and verse number 33, the verse that we'll use as our study

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.279
this evening, the Bible says this, be not deceived.

00:03:03.279 --> 00:03:08.399
Again, we're dealing with the danger of deception, the age of deception in which we're living

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:11.020
in, and we understand that people are deceived.

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.380
We understand that there are folks that are seeking to deceive you.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:20.339
They lay in wait to deceive, and here the Bible says, be not deceived.

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:27.740
Notice what it says, evil communications corrupt good manners.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:32.779
The word evil carries with it the idea of being wicked or ungodly.

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:37.100
Communications here in this particular passage of Scripture, if you think about Old English,

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:42.100
it's carrying with it the idea of companionship or communion, relationships.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:47.179
It's not simply speaking about some level of verbal communication where we might think

00:03:47.179 --> 00:03:53.660
of this in this particular age today, but we understand he's speaking about these companionships,

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:59.699
communion, one with another, and it says this, be not deceived, evil communications, those

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:04.380
companionships with wicked or ungodly individuals.

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.679
Notice what it says, corrupt.

00:04:07.679 --> 00:04:14.259
To deprave or to destroy, they corrupt good manners.

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:20.059
That which is good according to the Word is that which is fit or appropriate or virtuous.

00:04:20.059 --> 00:04:25.059
The idea of manners is morals, or maybe we would use the word character.

00:04:25.059 --> 00:04:31.619
To begin to understand this verse of Scripture, and he says, be not deceived, evil communications

00:04:31.619 --> 00:04:34.500
corrupt good manners.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:40.579
How many people have been deceived in this very portion of Scripture?

00:04:40.579 --> 00:04:47.619
The warning that has been given, be not deceived, evil communications corrupt good manners.

00:04:47.619 --> 00:04:49.619
Nope, they're not going to influence me.

00:04:49.619 --> 00:04:51.220
Nope, they're not going to affect me.

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.899
I'm able to handle it.

00:04:52.899 --> 00:04:57.579
The Bible says, be not deceived.

00:04:57.579 --> 00:05:01.019
Evil communications corrupt good manners.

00:05:01.019 --> 00:05:05.980
I've said on a number of occasions over the years, as we've considered the context of

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:12.220
the church in Corinth, that they were living in a time in which the culture was influencing

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.019
the church.

00:05:14.019 --> 00:05:19.619
God has always designed that the church influence the culture, but yet we find in Corinth that

00:05:19.619 --> 00:05:24.540
it was the city of Corinth that was having a great impact and a great influence upon

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.380
the people of the church.

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:36.059
The reality is that even still today, far too often the culture is influencing the church.

00:05:36.059 --> 00:05:41.179
And we have a responsibility to understand this age of deception in which we're living

00:05:41.179 --> 00:05:46.980
in, and we understand that God has given us warnings, and he says evil communications

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.260
corrupt good manners.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.380
Do we believe God or do we not?

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:55.980
Will we take heed to what God has said or will we not?

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:00.299
As we think about this verse of Scripture as the backdrop for the study this evening

00:06:00.299 --> 00:06:03.980
with dealing with the subject of spiritual distancing, I want you to turn over to the

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:08.059
book of Psalms, if you will, and look at Psalm 106.

00:06:08.059 --> 00:06:14.660
I want to read a few verses of Scripture to you from Psalm 106 as we would take an account

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:21.339
that is given to us of a historical event, the people of God, and what the effect was

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:28.179
of really this verse of Scripture from 1 Corinthians 15 where they did not take heed to the warning

00:06:28.179 --> 00:06:34.579
that God had given them in the law, and this same thing can happen in our lives if we do

00:06:34.579 --> 00:06:39.980
not take heed to the warning that God provides us with, that evil communications corrupt

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:40.980
good manners.

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:44.739
Pick it up with me in Psalm 106, look at verse number 34.

00:06:44.739 --> 00:06:45.739
It says this,

00:06:45.739 --> 00:06:51.859
They did not destroy the nations concerning whom the Lord commanded them, but were mingled

00:06:51.859 --> 00:06:56.220
among the heathen, and learned their works, and they served their idols, which were a

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:57.739
snare unto them.

00:06:57.739 --> 00:07:02.579
Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils, and shed innocent blood,

00:07:02.579 --> 00:07:07.179
even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols

00:07:07.179 --> 00:07:08.500
of Canaan.

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.619
The land was polluted with blood.

00:07:10.619 --> 00:07:16.779
Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a-whoring with their own inventions.

00:07:16.779 --> 00:07:23.140
Therefore was the wrath of the Lord kindled against His people, insomuch that He abhorred

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:26.299
His own inheritance.

00:07:26.299 --> 00:07:28.380
Those are some sad verses of Scripture.

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:33.579
I want you to notice as we just kind of take these few verses, and I want you to focus

00:07:33.579 --> 00:07:36.140
on some phrases in each of the verses of Scripture.

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:39.459
We find ourselves beginning in verse number 35.

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:45.940
Notice the phrase, they were mingled among the heathen.

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:49.040
The word mingled means to have fellowship with.

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:53.619
It was not a situation where we would look at what God says in John that we're in the

00:07:53.619 --> 00:07:55.540
world but not of the world.

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:58.700
No doubt we come into contact with lost people.

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:03.579
In fact, we ought to desire to come into contact with lost people for the purpose of sharing

00:08:03.579 --> 00:08:05.140
the gospel with them.

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:06.980
They need the light of the gospel.

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:12.859
If our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost, 2 Corinthians chapter number 4.

00:08:12.859 --> 00:08:18.579
So we must have some level of interaction with the lost community in order to seek to

00:08:18.579 --> 00:08:21.059
reach them with the truth of the gospel.

00:08:21.059 --> 00:08:26.220
But we understand that we're not having this fellowship with them as what is being described

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:31.459
here where they were mingled among the heathen, the unbelievers.

00:08:31.459 --> 00:08:38.700
Notice in verse number 35 it says this, and learned their works.

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:40.659
How did they learn their works?

00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:42.219
Because they were fellowshipping with them.

00:08:42.219 --> 00:08:45.419
They were mingled with them, right?

00:08:45.419 --> 00:08:47.659
So they mingled with the heathen.

00:08:47.659 --> 00:08:49.380
They learned their works.

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:54.940
Notice verse 36, and they served their idols.

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:57.179
Wow.

00:08:57.179 --> 00:09:02.580
Now, I wish I could interview the people of God, and if you could just for a moment

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:07.619
in a sanctified imagination, consider sitting down with these individuals and saying, did

00:09:07.619 --> 00:09:10.299
you think that you would serve their idols?

00:09:10.299 --> 00:09:12.820
I don't think that was the intent.

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:17.859
I don't think that's what they thought was going to happen when they got on that path.

00:09:17.859 --> 00:09:21.500
But they mingled among the heathen.

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:23.419
They learned their works.

00:09:23.419 --> 00:09:24.820
They served their idols.

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:26.500
It gets worse.

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:33.659
The Bible tells us in verses 37 and 38 that they sacrificed their sons and their daughters.

00:09:33.659 --> 00:09:35.340
Can you imagine?

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:40.059
The Bible says, yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils and shed

00:09:40.059 --> 00:09:44.539
innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed

00:09:44.539 --> 00:09:50.580
unto the idols of Canaan, and the land was polluted with blood.

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:52.299
Wow.

00:09:52.299 --> 00:09:56.020
Is that not tragic?

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:59.059
That's absolutely horrible.

00:09:59.059 --> 00:10:00.059
It started in verse...

00:10:00.059 --> 00:10:02.599
in v. 34 when they didn't obey God

00:10:02.599 --> 00:10:04.279
in destroying the inhabitants,

00:10:04.279 --> 00:10:05.619
but we see in v. 35

00:10:05.619 --> 00:10:09.339
where they mingled among the heathen.

00:10:09.339 --> 00:10:14.979
Evil communications corrupt good manners.

00:10:14.979 --> 00:10:16.939
And we find that they're mingling,

00:10:16.939 --> 00:10:18.779
they're fellowshipping with the heathen

00:10:18.779 --> 00:10:20.359
and they're learning their works

00:10:20.359 --> 00:10:22.019
and they're serving their idols.

00:10:22.019 --> 00:10:24.739
You understand that the inhabitants of the land,

00:10:24.739 --> 00:10:26.739
it was very common that they would offer

00:10:26.739 --> 00:10:28.659
their children to Molech,

00:10:28.699 --> 00:10:30.099
a false god,

00:10:30.099 --> 00:10:31.979
and now we find that the Bible says

00:10:31.979 --> 00:10:34.259
that they sacrificed their sons and their daughters

00:10:34.259 --> 00:10:36.459
unto devils.

00:10:36.459 --> 00:10:38.659
False gods.

00:10:38.659 --> 00:10:40.899
The land was polluted.

00:10:40.899 --> 00:10:42.099
Notice v. 39,

00:10:42.099 --> 00:10:45.619
thus, were they defiled.

00:10:45.619 --> 00:10:47.419
They were defiled with their own works

00:10:47.419 --> 00:10:51.539
and went to whoring with their own inventions.

00:10:51.539 --> 00:10:53.499
And then we get to v. 40

00:10:53.499 --> 00:10:56.219
and the Bible says, therefore,

00:10:56.219 --> 00:10:58.019
as a result of those few verses

00:10:58.019 --> 00:10:59.459
that we've just looked at,

00:10:59.459 --> 00:11:01.299
and we find what has happened

00:11:01.299 --> 00:11:04.899
and what has transpired in this terrible path,

00:11:04.899 --> 00:11:07.459
this slippery slope, if you will,

00:11:07.459 --> 00:11:08.979
that it says, therefore,

00:11:08.979 --> 00:11:11.579
was the wrath of the Lord

00:11:11.579 --> 00:11:16.579
kindled against His people,

00:11:16.579 --> 00:11:22.619
insomuch that He abhorred His own inheritance.

00:11:22.619 --> 00:11:26.419
Is that the therefore that you'd like in your life?

00:11:26.419 --> 00:11:27.739
No way.

00:11:27.779 --> 00:11:32.299
I don't want that.

00:11:32.299 --> 00:11:35.860
I can avoid v. 40 and v. 39

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:39.220
and v. 38 and v. 37,

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:42.059
and I can avoid v. 36,

00:11:42.059 --> 00:11:45.419
and I can avoid the end of v. 35

00:11:45.419 --> 00:11:49.899
if I'm not mingling at the start of v. 35.

00:11:49.899 --> 00:11:51.220
Correct?

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:52.699
That's how I'm avoiding it.

00:11:52.699 --> 00:11:55.220
The way to avoid all of those consequences.

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:57.019
See, there are times in our lives

00:11:57.019 --> 00:11:59.379
in which we think that we can operate

00:11:59.379 --> 00:12:00.459
and we can behave

00:12:00.459 --> 00:12:03.540
and we can have these relationships

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:04.699
and what have you,

00:12:04.699 --> 00:12:08.339
and we think that we can have isolated situations

00:12:08.339 --> 00:12:10.860
and we can control the consequences

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:12.220
and the circumstances,

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:15.419
but the reality is that those truths

00:12:15.419 --> 00:12:17.819
that God has given us in His Word

00:12:17.819 --> 00:12:20.020
stand and they are true.

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:26.619
Evil communications corrupt good manners.

00:12:26.619 --> 00:12:29.099
He starts the verse of Scripture by saying,

00:12:29.099 --> 00:12:33.020
be not deceived.

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:34.739
So how can we be deceived in that?

00:12:34.739 --> 00:12:36.660
Well, because we get our place as situated.

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:38.500
Well, they seem nice.

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:41.099
I mean, they talk this way, they this.

00:12:41.099 --> 00:12:44.500
They're popular and I want to be popular.

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:46.059
And I understand that oftentimes

00:12:46.059 --> 00:12:48.020
when we think about 1 Corinthians 15, 33,

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:50.459
we think of it in the context of children

00:12:50.459 --> 00:12:54.539
or maybe even more specifically, teenagers.

00:12:54.539 --> 00:12:56.300
And it's a verse of Scripture

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:58.779
that man, you can preach it at teen camp

00:12:58.779 --> 00:13:01.179
and you can go to some Christian school chapel

00:13:01.179 --> 00:13:04.020
and man, you can just go after 1 Corinthians 15, 33

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:06.139
and just help those young people understand.

00:13:06.139 --> 00:13:08.940
But you understand that evil communications

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:12.660
corrupt good manners in adults as well,

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:16.099
in the workplace, in the neighborhood, right?

00:13:16.099 --> 00:13:20.099
Those evil communications, they corrupt good manners.

00:13:20.099 --> 00:13:21.979
This is a biblical truth.

00:13:21.979 --> 00:13:25.500
And the Bible says, be not deceived.

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:27.339
I mentioned last Wednesday evening.

00:13:27.339 --> 00:13:29.179
I think I said it was 1 Corinthians 11,

00:13:29.179 --> 00:13:31.539
it's 1 Corinthians 10 and verse number 12

00:13:31.539 --> 00:13:35.339
where the Bible says, let him that thinketh he stand

00:13:35.339 --> 00:13:38.699
take heed lest he fall.

00:13:38.699 --> 00:13:40.739
There are times no doubt in our lives

00:13:40.739 --> 00:13:42.619
where we may look in a situation and say,

00:13:42.619 --> 00:13:44.059
well, I can handle this.

00:13:44.059 --> 00:13:45.259
Can you?

00:13:45.259 --> 00:13:46.860
Can I?

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:50.059
We often tell our children and Holly probably more so

00:13:50.059 --> 00:13:51.539
than I will tell our children,

00:13:51.539 --> 00:13:53.860
it's not a situation where I don't trust you.

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:57.220
I don't trust the enemy, right?

00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:58.899
And I don't trust the enemy

00:13:58.899 --> 00:14:00.899
with this particular situation, why?

00:14:00.899 --> 00:14:02.220
Because I've lived long enough

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:05.940
to know how the enemy operates a little bit, right?

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:08.300
We're not ignorant of his devices

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:10.259
is what Paul says to the church in Corinth

00:14:10.259 --> 00:14:11.619
in 2 Corinthians.

00:14:11.619 --> 00:14:14.259
And so we find this biblical truth.

00:14:14.259 --> 00:14:16.899
They were warned in the Old Testament.

00:14:16.899 --> 00:14:18.540
They were warned when they would enter

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:21.139
into the land of Canaan with regard

00:14:21.139 --> 00:14:23.739
to how they were to behave and what they were to do

00:14:24.619 --> 00:14:26.139
and not to have any fellowship

00:14:26.139 --> 00:14:27.459
with the inhabitants of the land.

00:14:27.459 --> 00:14:29.660
But yet we read here that they were mingled

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:32.899
among the heathen and no doubt the truth

00:14:32.899 --> 00:14:35.739
that we're looking at in 1 Corinthians 15, 33

00:14:35.739 --> 00:14:38.459
is seen in these verses of scripture

00:14:38.459 --> 00:14:42.619
that evil communications corrupt good manners.

00:14:42.619 --> 00:14:43.739
So what do we do?

00:14:43.739 --> 00:14:46.619
How is it that we should respond to this warning?

00:14:46.619 --> 00:14:51.619
Well, I used as our title for the message this evening,

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:53.940
playing on those words that we've become

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:56.419
so familiar with of social distancing

00:14:56.419 --> 00:14:58.579
that we need to spiritually distance.

00:14:58.579 --> 00:15:00.260
Spiritual distancing,

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.059
turn to the book of 2 Corinthians if you will.

00:15:03.059 --> 00:15:05.739
We found ourselves in 1 Corinthians 15

00:15:05.739 --> 00:15:08.820
where we find there that God is giving the warning

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:10.739
to the believers in Corinth,

00:15:10.739 --> 00:15:14.179
be not deceived evil communications corrupt good manners.

00:15:14.179 --> 00:15:17.380
When the second letter is written to the church in Corinth,

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:19.139
we come to the sixth chapter

00:15:19.179 --> 00:15:22.059
and we find that the end of chapter number six

00:15:22.059 --> 00:15:23.899
and the beginning of chapter number seven,

00:15:23.899 --> 00:15:28.899
God gives a great discourse on the subject of separation

00:15:29.139 --> 00:15:31.820
and the importance of separation.

00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:33.899
The Bible says this in verse number 14

00:15:33.899 --> 00:15:35.380
of 2 Corinthians 6,

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:40.380
be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers

00:15:40.739 --> 00:15:45.179
for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness

00:15:45.179 --> 00:15:49.980
and what communion hath light with darkness

00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:52.700
and what concord hath Christ with Belial

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:56.139
or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel

00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:01.260
and what agreement hath the temple of God with idols

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.459
for ye are the temple of the living God.

00:16:04.459 --> 00:16:07.660
As God hath said, I will dwell in them and walk in them

00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:10.859
and I will be their God and they shall be my people.

00:16:10.859 --> 00:16:13.579
Wherefore come out from among them

00:16:13.579 --> 00:16:16.380
and be ye separate saith the Lord

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:19.419
and touch not the unclean thing

00:16:19.419 --> 00:16:22.459
and I will receive you and will be a father unto you

00:16:22.459 --> 00:16:24.179
and you shall be my sons and daughters

00:16:24.179 --> 00:16:25.339
saith the Lord Almighty.

00:16:25.339 --> 00:16:27.220
Verse one of chapter seven,

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:29.940
having therefore these promises

00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:31.820
and by the way, they're wonderful promises.

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:34.100
I will receive you, will be a father unto you,

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:37.019
you shall be my sons and daughters saith the Lord Almighty

00:16:37.019 --> 00:16:39.820
having therefore these promises dearly beloved,

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:43.619
let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh

00:16:43.619 --> 00:16:47.500
and spirit perfecting holiness in the fear of God.

00:16:48.579 --> 00:16:51.500
Verse 17, wherefore come out from among them

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:53.859
and be separate saith the Lord.

00:16:53.859 --> 00:16:56.139
This idea of spiritual distancing,

00:16:56.139 --> 00:16:59.820
this idea of I don't wanna be tainted by the world.

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:03.899
We do not desire to be influenced by

00:17:03.899 --> 00:17:07.139
and to have the world influencing us

00:17:07.139 --> 00:17:08.459
in our walk with God and saying,

00:17:08.459 --> 00:17:10.540
well, you know, it's different now

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:13.540
and things are different and so on and so forth.

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:14.660
No, be not deceived.

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:16.179
We don't wanna go down that path.

00:17:16.179 --> 00:17:19.380
We don't wanna end up where the children of Israel did

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:23.660
in verse 36 and 37 and 38 and 39 and 40 in Psalm 106.

00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:25.220
No, we wanna avoid that.

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:29.179
So therefore we do not wanna be mingled among the heathen.

00:17:29.179 --> 00:17:30.739
We find that the Bible tells us

00:17:30.739 --> 00:17:34.779
that we're to keep ourselves unspotted from the world.

00:17:35.779 --> 00:17:39.139
I'm thankful that the word of God cleanses

00:17:39.139 --> 00:17:41.540
and we understand that we live in the world

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:45.059
to mention what Jesus said once again in John 17

00:17:45.059 --> 00:17:48.299
that we're in the world, but we're not of the world.

00:17:48.299 --> 00:17:50.100
And that's a blessing and we're thankful.

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:52.260
Listen, he has us here for a purpose,

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:53.459
but we need to be careful

00:17:53.459 --> 00:17:55.619
that we're not being tainted by the world,

00:17:55.619 --> 00:17:57.700
that we're not being spotted by the world,

00:17:57.700 --> 00:17:59.700
that we're not being influenced by the world,

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:04.220
that the deceivers that lay in wait,

00:18:04.459 --> 00:18:06.700
the many deceivers that lay in wait,

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:09.779
that we're careful as to our associations,

00:18:09.779 --> 00:18:14.139
as to those with whom we're having these relationships,

00:18:14.139 --> 00:18:17.940
these companionships and this level of communion with, why?

00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:22.660
Because those evil communications will corrupt good manners.

00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:25.019
And so we must be careful.

00:18:25.019 --> 00:18:28.220
We must understand this principle of separation.

00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:30.419
We must understand, listen, again,

00:18:30.419 --> 00:18:34.619
as we would use the phraseology that we've heard

00:18:34.619 --> 00:18:36.940
and become accustomed with in the last 18 months

00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:39.260
with this idea of social distancing.

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:41.020
You know, people have taken that

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:42.500
and they've been serious about it.

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:44.299
A number of people have.

00:18:44.299 --> 00:18:46.940
I mean, someone shared a story with me

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:50.739
just in the last week where they were in a particular place

00:18:50.739 --> 00:18:53.739
and they were having a hard time hearing the individual.

00:18:53.739 --> 00:18:55.500
The individual's having a hard time hearing them

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:57.739
and they got a little closer and it was like,

00:18:57.739 --> 00:18:59.659
I mean, it was alarms going off.

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:02.580
It was, no, don't get close, you know, so on and so forth.

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:04.700
And they have believed

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:07.940
and they are practicing and serious about,

00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:10.659
but I just wonder if the people of God would be serious

00:19:10.659 --> 00:19:13.619
about this idea of spiritual distancing.

00:19:13.619 --> 00:19:17.340
I don't wanna have the influence of the world.

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:19.539
I don't wanna have the influence of the heathen,

00:19:19.539 --> 00:19:23.299
of ungodly individuals, of wicked, evil individuals.

00:19:23.299 --> 00:19:25.020
No, I don't want that influence.

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:26.099
I need to be careful.

00:19:26.099 --> 00:19:29.340
I need to practice this thing of separation.

00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:31.340
There are some times in the life of a believer

00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:33.659
that we have to say no.

00:19:33.659 --> 00:19:35.779
There's some things that we just can't do.

00:19:35.779 --> 00:19:36.700
Amen.

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:38.580
There's some places we shouldn't go.

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:39.619
Amen.

00:19:39.619 --> 00:19:40.700
We sing with the kids.

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:43.700
There's a great change since I've been born again, right?

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:45.940
The places I used to go, I don't go there anymore.

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:47.859
The things I used to say, I don't say them anymore.

00:19:47.859 --> 00:19:49.219
The so on and so forth.

00:19:49.219 --> 00:19:51.659
And we sing round after round after round with the kids.

00:19:51.659 --> 00:19:52.500
Why?

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:54.099
Because there's been a great change

00:19:54.099 --> 00:19:55.500
since I've been born again.

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:59.500
Come out from among them and be ye separate, saith the Lord.

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:02.779
What concord, what communion hath Christ with Belial?

00:20:02.779 --> 00:20:05.659
The reality of that passage of Scripture

00:20:05.659 --> 00:20:09.579
gives us the great contrast between light and darkness

00:20:09.579 --> 00:20:10.739
and so on and so forth,

00:20:10.739 --> 00:20:15.119
and we find that we are to be separate.

00:20:15.119 --> 00:20:16.819
That's how we respond to a warning

00:20:16.819 --> 00:20:18.700
when the Bible says be not deceived.

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:21.500
Evil communications corrupt good manners.

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:23.459
Look at Psalm 1, if you will.

00:20:23.459 --> 00:20:25.219
It's a familiar passage of Scripture.

00:20:25.219 --> 00:20:26.899
In fact, there are a number of people

00:20:26.899 --> 00:20:28.379
in our auditorium this evening,

00:20:28.379 --> 00:20:32.900
who quote the entirety of Psalm 1.

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:34.979
I want you to understand even as we think

00:20:34.979 --> 00:20:38.099
about this thought tonight of spiritual distancing

00:20:38.099 --> 00:20:41.860
and this truth of be not deceived,

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:44.099
evil communications corrupt good manners,

00:20:44.099 --> 00:20:47.779
notice what the psalmist says to begin Psalm 1.

00:20:47.779 --> 00:20:49.220
In verse number 1,

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:52.700
Blessed is the man that walketh not

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:55.139
in the counsel of the ungodly,

00:20:55.139 --> 00:20:56.979
nor standeth in the way of sinners,

00:20:57.299 --> 00:21:00.279
nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.

00:21:00.279 --> 00:21:02.900
You know how you avoid sitting in the seat of the scornful?

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:05.160
You don't stand in the way of sinners.

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.800
You know how you don't stand in the way of sinners?

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:10.519
You don't walk in the counsel of the ungodly.

00:21:10.519 --> 00:21:12.260
Amen.

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:13.339
And so he says,

00:21:13.339 --> 00:21:15.699
Blessed is the man that walketh not

00:21:15.699 --> 00:21:18.580
in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth

00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:19.500
in the way of sinners,

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:22.339
nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.

00:21:22.339 --> 00:21:25.279
And in order for me to avoid sitting in that seat,

00:21:25.319 --> 00:21:27.839
then I'm not going to stand with those individuals.

00:21:27.839 --> 00:21:31.199
I'm not going to walk in the counsel of the ungodly.

00:21:32.239 --> 00:21:34.239
The truth of separation.

00:21:34.239 --> 00:21:37.199
We also find that our response to the warning

00:21:37.199 --> 00:21:39.000
is not only one of separation,

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.599
but I believe also as we look here in Psalm 1,

00:21:41.599 --> 00:21:44.540
it is the truth of delighting in his word.

00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:46.300
Delighting in his word.

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:49.059
See, we must embrace the truth

00:21:49.059 --> 00:21:51.720
that God has given us in his word.

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:52.559
When he says,

00:21:52.559 --> 00:21:55.480
be not deceived, evil communications corrupt good manners,

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:56.860
he's giving us a warning.

00:21:57.919 --> 00:22:00.720
But you know, unfortunately there are times in our lives,

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:03.279
no doubt each and every one of us could say

00:22:03.279 --> 00:22:06.040
that I did not take heed to a warning that was given.

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:09.000
We understand that.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.399
We can read stories and share accounts

00:22:11.399 --> 00:22:13.559
of individuals that did not take heed to warning

00:22:13.559 --> 00:22:15.380
and it ended up tragic.

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:18.240
Tragic results and responses

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:22.380
because of their lack of taking heed to a warning.

00:22:23.199 --> 00:22:23.979
God has given us this warning

00:22:23.979 --> 00:22:25.699
and we must delight in his word.

00:22:25.699 --> 00:22:28.419
We must understand that his word has been given to us

00:22:28.419 --> 00:22:29.660
and it is profitable.

00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:32.380
It's interesting and I don't want you to turn back there,

00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:34.779
but in Psalm 106, when we read all of that

00:22:34.779 --> 00:22:36.660
in verses 34 through 40,

00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:38.539
how that they were mingled among the heathen,

00:22:38.539 --> 00:22:40.699
that they learned their work, served their idols,

00:22:40.699 --> 00:22:42.679
sacrificed their sons and their daughters.

00:22:42.679 --> 00:22:46.539
They were defiled and therefore the wrath of the Lord

00:22:46.539 --> 00:22:49.119
was kindled against his people.

00:22:49.119 --> 00:22:51.259
We find that in verse number 24,

00:22:51.259 --> 00:22:53.179
so just several verses before we read

00:22:53.179 --> 00:22:54.699
that portion of Scripture.

00:22:54.699 --> 00:22:57.419
You know what the Bible tells us in that verse of Scripture?

00:22:57.419 --> 00:23:01.000
They believed not his word.

00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:04.800
In Psalm 106 and verse number 24,

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:08.500
they believed not his word.

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:12.779
There are times in which we behave

00:23:12.779 --> 00:23:15.100
in a manner in which we're really saying

00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:17.899
we don't believe what God told us in his word.

00:23:17.899 --> 00:23:19.880
I don't believe that evil communications

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:20.960
are gonna corrupt good manners

00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:23.160
because I really wanna be accepted

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:26.160
and I wanna be part of the group at work

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:30.119
or whatever it might be and it's not gonna happen to me.

00:23:30.119 --> 00:23:32.679
How many people have said that over the years?

00:23:32.679 --> 00:23:34.720
And then they fall prey, they fall victim

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:38.240
to whatever that particular situation is.

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:40.960
And so the Bible tells us in Psalm 106 verse 24

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:42.759
before you ever even get to those things

00:23:42.759 --> 00:23:46.559
that they did not, they believed not his word.

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:49.360
We ought to delight in the word of God.

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:52.880
Notice what the psalmist says in Psalm 1 and verse 2.

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:56.919
But his delight is in the law of the Lord.

00:23:56.919 --> 00:24:00.800
And in his law doth he meditate day and night.

00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:04.119
As a result of his delight and his devotion,

00:24:04.119 --> 00:24:07.240
his meditation in the word of God day and night,

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:08.800
the Bible says the result of that

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:10.360
is that he shall be like a tree

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:12.679
that's planted by the rivers of waters

00:24:12.679 --> 00:24:14.660
that bringeth forth his fruit in the season.

00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:16.279
His leaf also shall not wither

00:24:16.279 --> 00:24:19.600
and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:21.359
That sounds really good.

00:24:21.359 --> 00:24:22.880
Amen?

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:25.480
Those are the kind of results that we want in our lives

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:26.640
in verse number two.

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:29.559
We don't want those results that we read of in Psalm 106

00:24:29.559 --> 00:24:31.920
nor do we want what the Bible says about the ungodly

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:34.239
or not so at the end of Psalm 1.

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:38.920
We must delight in his word, we must have that devotion.

00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:42.640
By the way, as we've studied this for now just a few weeks,

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:45.279
this subject matter of the danger of deception

00:24:45.279 --> 00:24:47.679
and understanding that we live in the age

00:24:47.679 --> 00:24:49.660
or an age of deception,

00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:51.799
that we understand that regularly

00:24:51.799 --> 00:24:53.720
we're coming back to this truth

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:55.720
that the remedy for the deception

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:57.799
is the knowledge of God's word.

00:24:59.079 --> 00:25:01.600
When I'm delighting in the law of the Lord,

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:04.279
when I'm taking and I'm meditating,

00:25:04.279 --> 00:25:07.880
I'm having that devotion life that I'm supposed to have

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:10.440
and I'm embracing the truth

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:12.260
that God has given me in his word,

00:25:12.299 --> 00:25:15.980
that is going to help me to combat the deception

00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:18.519
that is so prevalent in our society today.

00:25:19.579 --> 00:25:21.540
Nope, I'm not gonna be deceived by that, why?

00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:23.859
Because I have God's truth.

00:25:23.859 --> 00:25:26.619
And when I have truth and I know truth

00:25:26.619 --> 00:25:28.100
and I'm familiar with truth,

00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:31.420
then when those lies come and that deception comes,

00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:35.399
I'm able to stand upon the truth that God has given me.

00:25:36.859 --> 00:25:40.559
And the answer is delighting in the law of the Lord.

00:25:41.399 --> 00:25:43.440
It's a simple verse of Scripture

00:25:44.799 --> 00:25:47.019
in 1 Corinthians 15 and verse 33.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.519
Be not deceived.

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:56.880
Evil communications corrupt good manners.

00:25:59.959 --> 00:26:02.239
I don't wanna have fellowship with,

00:26:02.239 --> 00:26:07.239
companionship with those that are ungodly or wicked

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:14.279
that would cause me to have my character

00:26:14.279 --> 00:26:18.000
that is fit or appropriate or virtuous

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.600
to be destroyed or depraved.

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:23.279
So therefore, I better take heed to the warning.

00:26:23.279 --> 00:26:25.040
Be not deceived.

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:26.640
Be not deceived.

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:28.760
We read those verses of Scripture

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:32.239
or those words in Scripture

00:26:32.239 --> 00:26:35.200
and it's almost like God giving us

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:38.519
this big neon warning sign, right?

00:26:38.519 --> 00:26:41.959
When you preface something with be not deceived.

00:26:41.959 --> 00:26:43.720
It's actually kind of interesting in the Greek

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:46.399
and I'm not a Greek scholar by any stretch of the imagination

00:26:46.399 --> 00:26:49.320
I don't use Greek very often in messages

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:53.359
but it's interesting that the word for deceive

00:26:53.359 --> 00:26:56.839
in that verse of Scripture is the first and third word

00:26:56.839 --> 00:26:59.559
in 1 Corinthians 15, 33.

00:26:59.559 --> 00:27:03.519
And so it's really a just kind of smacking in the face

00:27:03.519 --> 00:27:06.480
on this subject of deception.

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:08.799
And so be not deceived.

00:27:08.799 --> 00:27:13.799
Maybe this evening there's some areas in our lives

00:27:14.239 --> 00:27:17.959
that we evaluate under the warning that God has given us

00:27:19.399 --> 00:27:21.500
and desire to take and practice

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:24.160
some spiritual distancing in our lives.

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:32.119
The term social distancing, again, unfamiliar to me

00:27:32.119 --> 00:27:33.799
though it had been around for decades

00:27:33.799 --> 00:27:36.279
is my understanding through a quick research.

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:40.119
I wonder if the term spiritual distancing

00:27:40.119 --> 00:27:43.279
could have as much of an impact in our lives

00:27:43.279 --> 00:27:46.440
as social distancing did several months ago.

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:47.920
You say, you know what?

00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:49.559
There's just some places I can't go

00:27:49.559 --> 00:27:51.959
as a person, as a child of God.

00:27:51.959 --> 00:27:55.040
There's just some associations I just can't have.

00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:57.480
Why?

00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:01.519
Because I don't wanna have my good manners corrupted

00:28:02.799 --> 00:28:04.720
and I'm going to take heed to the warning

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:06.399
that God has given.

00:28:06.399 --> 00:28:08.679
Be not deceived.

00:28:08.679 --> 00:28:11.720
Evil communications corrupt good manners.

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:12.559
Let's pray.

00:28:12.559 --> 00:28:14.679
Father, thank you for the warning

00:28:14.679 --> 00:28:16.200
that you give us in your word.

00:28:18.079 --> 00:28:21.399
As we look at the example of your people

00:28:21.399 --> 00:28:23.859
as it's recorded in Psalm 106,

00:28:25.399 --> 00:28:28.200
it's tragic, it's unfortunate.

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:32.479
I believe if they could stand before us this evening,

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:42.000
they never imagined that it would end the way that it did.

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:49.039
When they started to mingle amongst the heathen,

00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:52.400
the fellowship with them, the ungodly,

00:28:53.239 --> 00:28:55.840
they did not believe that it would result

00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:58.880
in learning their works and serving their idols

00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:01.239
and sacrificing their children

00:29:01.239 --> 00:29:06.239
and having your wrath against them.

00:29:08.799 --> 00:29:13.320
Lord, I pray tonight in this age of deception

00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:14.559
in which we're living in,

00:29:15.799 --> 00:29:17.840
you'd help us to take heed to the warning.

00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:19.799
We'd evaluate our lives individually

00:29:20.719 --> 00:29:25.719
and with your help, determine if there's some changes

00:29:26.719 --> 00:29:27.760
that need to be made,

00:29:29.919 --> 00:29:32.239
some spiritual distancing in our lives

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:36.440
as we desire to please you and honor you and glorify you.

00:29:37.359 --> 00:29:38.739
I pray that you'd bless our time of prayer.

00:29:38.739 --> 00:29:40.840
We thank you for the privilege of prayer.

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:44.239
We pray that you'd be glorified.

00:29:44.239 --> 00:29:46.919
For it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.

00:29:46.919 --> 00:29:49.659
Does anyone need a prayer bulletin this evening?

00:29:49.659 --> 00:29:51.359
You did not.
