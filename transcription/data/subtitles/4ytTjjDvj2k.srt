1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,400
John, we'll be in John chapter number 16,

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,199
John chapter number 16 this morning.

3
00:00:06,199 --> 00:00:07,880
I'll read the verse of scripture

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,800
that we'll be using for our message this morning.

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,359
We'll be referencing a number of different passages

6
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:16,319
of scripture as well, so have your fingers ready

7
00:00:16,319 --> 00:00:18,200
this morning, John chapter number 16.

8
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,079
I love the gospel of John,

9
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:22,520
and obviously I love the Bible.

10
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,360
All of it is good, it's profitable,

11
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,879
and we're thankful for it.

12
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:29,239
But there's something about the gospel of John

13
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,280
for me personally, specifically,

14
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:35,439
I thoroughly enjoy reading through the gospel of John.

15
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:37,439
I just read it again last week

16
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:40,840
and just thoroughly was blessed and encouraged.

17
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,639
John 16, in verse number 33,

18
00:00:43,639 --> 00:00:44,919
notice what the Bible says.

19
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:48,360
These things I have spoken unto you,

20
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,240
that in me you might have peace.

21
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,560
In the world you shall have tribulation,

22
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:00,560
but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,959
Jesus gives these words to the disciples

24
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,160
and what precious words they are.

25
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,599
I've titled the message from this verse of scripture,

26
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:11,000
be of good cheer.

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,120
John chapter number 12 records for us

28
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,839
the triumphal entry of the Lord Jesus Christ

29
00:01:15,839 --> 00:01:18,160
as he makes his way into Jerusalem.

30
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,919
And we understand that even as that event

31
00:01:20,919 --> 00:01:23,440
is given to us and the record is provided

32
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,760
in John chapter number 12,

33
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,599
that it was 500 years earlier

34
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:32,000
that Zachariah prophesied of this very event taking place.

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And as Jesus would make his triumphal entry into Jerusalem

36
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,199
and there were many that were crying out

37
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:41,279
and worshiping and all that was taking place.

38
00:01:41,279 --> 00:01:44,959
And of course, in just a short period of time,

39
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:48,000
those cries changed drastically

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,080
where as he's riding in and all that's taking place

41
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,000
and we look at that triumphal entry

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,559
and we look at how they were glorifying.

43
00:01:56,559 --> 00:02:00,040
And it says in verse 15, fear not daughter of Zion,

44
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,440
behold thy King cometh sitting on an ass's colt.

45
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,599
And he's coming in the fulfillment again

46
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:07,279
of what Zachariah would say.

47
00:02:07,279 --> 00:02:11,759
And by the time you get to the 18th and 19th chapter

48
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:12,800
of the book of John,

49
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,160
you find that the crowd is crying crucify him, crucify him.

50
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,399
And what changes have taken place

51
00:02:19,399 --> 00:02:21,679
in just a short period of time in Jerusalem.

52
00:02:22,279 --> 00:02:24,000
But we find that over the next few days

53
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,119
from John chapter 12 and the triumphal entry

54
00:02:27,119 --> 00:02:28,679
of the Lord Jesus Christ,

55
00:02:28,679 --> 00:02:30,240
over the next few days,

56
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,679
we find that several things occur.

57
00:02:33,679 --> 00:02:36,000
We find that in John chapter 13,

58
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,399
God provides us with the record

59
00:02:38,399 --> 00:02:42,399
of Jesus washing the feet of the disciples.

60
00:02:42,399 --> 00:02:44,399
And of course, there's a great truth

61
00:02:44,399 --> 00:02:46,559
in that passage of scripture

62
00:02:46,559 --> 00:02:50,399
that we can understand the truth of being a servant,

63
00:02:50,399 --> 00:02:52,440
the humility and what joy that is,

64
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,960
the great lesson that we learn of Peter

65
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,919
and his objection and the instruction that's given.

66
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:02,199
But after that portion of scripture in John 13,

67
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:06,639
we find that Jesus to conclude the 13th chapter,

68
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:09,720
chapter 14, 15 and 16,

69
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,759
we find that in these pages of God's word

70
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:16,960
that Jesus is spending these times,

71
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:21,320
this period of time alone with his disciples.

72
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,679
And as he's there alone with his disciples,

73
00:03:23,679 --> 00:03:26,520
we find that it is in this intimate setting

74
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,839
that Jesus is preparing his disciples

75
00:03:29,839 --> 00:03:33,880
for that which will transpire in the days ahead.

76
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,000
Not only immediately,

77
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,679
but we find that even in their life and ministry

78
00:03:38,679 --> 00:03:40,000
and for us today,

79
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,320
the truth of preparation is still found

80
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,440
within these words that Jesus spoke.

81
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,679
We find that really John 16 and verse 33,

82
00:03:48,679 --> 00:03:50,759
the verse that I read a moment ago

83
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:53,960
that is our text for our message this morning

84
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,800
is a concluding verse.

85
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:00,479
It closes out all that Jesus taught his disciples,

86
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:02,000
all of the instruction,

87
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,240
all that he had communicated to them

88
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,160
during that special time.

89
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,919
We find that Jesus in the gospel of John

90
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:12,320
regularly refers to his hour.

91
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,919
And he speaks about in John chapter number two

92
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:17,079
that his hour is not yet come,

93
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:19,959
but we find that as immediately following

94
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,839
our text of scripture this morning,

95
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,119
that when you come to John 17 and verse number one,

96
00:04:25,119 --> 00:04:29,640
that Jesus says, father, the hour is come.

97
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,799
What is he referring to?

98
00:04:30,799 --> 00:04:33,279
Well, he's going to the cross of Calvary.

99
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:37,239
He's going to pay for the sin of mankind.

100
00:04:37,239 --> 00:04:41,359
He's going to fulfill his singular purpose

101
00:04:41,359 --> 00:04:44,320
of coming to this earth and that's to save sinners.

102
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,320
He had to go to the cross of Calvary.

103
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,799
We understand that he was buried

104
00:04:47,799 --> 00:04:51,519
and he rose conquering sin, death and the grave.

105
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:55,440
The things that would transpire in these days ahead

106
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,880
were going to be events that were going

107
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,440
to cause the disciples to have many emotional responses.

108
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,399
There were several things that they were going

109
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:08,839
to have to deal with, not only during the crucifixion,

110
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:11,399
the arrest and the trial and the crucifixion,

111
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:14,480
the resurrection and then following thereafter.

112
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,000
We find that as they would begin their ministry,

113
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,399
as you study the book of Acts,

114
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:22,600
that they would face much adversity and much persecution.

115
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,480
And in these chapters of the gospel of John,

116
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:31,480
Jesus Christ is seeking to prepare his servants.

117
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,839
I'm so thankful that our God knows all things.

118
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:38,679
I'm so thankful that he is alpha and omega.

119
00:05:38,679 --> 00:05:40,880
He is the beginning and the end.

120
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,679
I am so thankful that he knows all things

121
00:05:43,679 --> 00:05:46,640
and he has communicated to us as his people

122
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,679
what we need to know.

123
00:05:48,679 --> 00:05:51,119
And he has given us all that we need to know

124
00:05:51,119 --> 00:05:55,880
so that we would be prepared for all that we will face.

125
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,079
The reality is that we're going to face some things.

126
00:05:58,079 --> 00:05:59,119
We're going to look at it in this text

127
00:05:59,119 --> 00:06:00,320
of scripture this morning.

128
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,160
We're going to face some things in life

129
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,399
and you are facing some things in life today,

130
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:10,119
but we can rejoice that God has given us his word

131
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:13,239
and in so doing, he has prepared us

132
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:15,480
for that which we will face.

133
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,720
You're in a situation where somebody tells you something

134
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,959
that you didn't know was that important

135
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:22,920
when they were saying it and afterwards you found out,

136
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,799
man, I wish I was paying more attention to what they said.

137
00:06:25,799 --> 00:06:28,000
Maybe they were giving you some piece of instruction

138
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,519
for something you were going to do.

139
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:32,399
Maybe they were providing you with some details

140
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:35,399
with regard to accessing a property,

141
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:39,279
whether it's through some means of disarming

142
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:43,320
or arming some device or a combination for a lock.

143
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,519
And you say, man, I wish I would pay more attention

144
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:47,600
to what was being said.

145
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,440
Why?

146
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,959
Because I don't remember I'm stuck at this step.

147
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:53,440
Ever happened to you?

148
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,079
Well, God's given us some instruction

149
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:57,839
that we need to be very, very attentive to.

150
00:06:57,839 --> 00:06:58,679
Why?

151
00:06:58,679 --> 00:07:01,839
Because we're going to face some things in life.

152
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:03,600
We're going to face some things in life

153
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,399
and God has provided us with the instruction that we need

154
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:10,160
so that when the hour comes, when the day comes,

155
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,320
when the difficulty comes, that we can be prepared.

156
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:17,679
The disciples heard these things audibly.

157
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,239
We have them written.

158
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:21,799
Isn't that a blessing?

159
00:07:21,799 --> 00:07:24,320
You ever forget something that somebody told you audibly?

160
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,040
You ever forget something that you've read?

161
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,320
Sure you have.

162
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,320
Well, we have the blessing of being able to go back

163
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,160
to the precious Bible and being able to read

164
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,200
these words that Jesus spoke.

165
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,880
If you're taking notes with me this morning,

166
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,640
notice number one, something to embrace.

167
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,679
As we look at John 16 and verse number 33,

168
00:07:40,679 --> 00:07:43,200
I find that there's something for us to embrace,

169
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,000
something for the disciples to embrace,

170
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,959
but this morning for each of us

171
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:49,440
as the people of God here in 2024,

172
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,399
there is something for us to embrace.

173
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:53,399
Notice the way that the verse begins.

174
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:58,399
These things I have spoken unto you.

175
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:01,880
These things I have spoken unto you.

176
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,119
What is it that we're to embrace?

177
00:08:03,119 --> 00:08:04,839
We're to embrace the word of God.

178
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:06,920
We're to embrace the scriptures.

179
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,720
We're to embrace that which God has given to us.

180
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,640
And we find contextually as Jesus is here,

181
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,079
literally with his disciples,

182
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:17,920
leading up to the time in which he would go

183
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:21,600
to the cruel cross and pay for the sin of mankind,

184
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,359
that he's literally speaking these words.

185
00:08:24,359 --> 00:08:28,119
It says, these things I have spoken unto you.

186
00:08:28,119 --> 00:08:30,500
They are to embrace these spoken words.

187
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,959
But I would say to you this morning

188
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:34,679
that as we have the written word of God

189
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,880
that we understand that all scripture is given

190
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:42,000
by inspiration of God, that's God breathe.

191
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,760
That's what the word means, inspiration.

192
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,840
And God has given to us his word.

193
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:52,039
He has providentially preserved his word for us this morning

194
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:55,919
so that we have the very word of God.

195
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:58,760
What a blessing this morning to have the confidence

196
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,479
that God has given to us exactly

197
00:09:01,479 --> 00:09:03,200
what it is that we need to know.

198
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,640
He has provided for us in this book

199
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,359
something that is to be embraced.

200
00:09:07,359 --> 00:09:10,460
It is precious, it is profitable.

201
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:14,359
We find this morning that as Jesus is speaking

202
00:09:14,359 --> 00:09:16,719
in these chapters to his disciples

203
00:09:16,719 --> 00:09:20,280
that he's very deliberate in what he says.

204
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:24,520
He's purposed in what he's going to communicate.

205
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,679
I want you to think about you having some measure

206
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:29,840
of communication with someone

207
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,679
and you're providing them with instruction

208
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:33,599
because of your departure,

209
00:09:33,599 --> 00:09:34,880
because of something you're doing.

210
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,719
And you say, I wanna give you some words of instruction.

211
00:09:37,719 --> 00:09:40,559
You would be deliberate, you would be pointed,

212
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:42,719
you would be purposed, you would seek

213
00:09:42,719 --> 00:09:45,760
to communicate with clarity

214
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,400
the message that you need to deliver.

215
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,159
Well, that's exactly what Jesus did.

216
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:52,960
And Jesus gave this message with great clarity.

217
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,919
I want you to back up to chapter 14

218
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:56,880
and I want you to notice, we're gonna look at

219
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,080
several places here in which Jesus reiterates

220
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,460
this thought that he's spoken these things to his disciples.

221
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:07,960
In John chapter 14, we understand that at the end of chapter 13,

222
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:12,140
he speaks about this new commandment that they love one another.

223
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:15,260
He begins chapter 14 with that wonderful promise

224
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:19,560
that he's going to prepare a place for us and he's going to come again and what joy that is.

225
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,480
But if you look in chapter 14 and verse 25, notice what Jesus says.

226
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:27,020
He says, these things have I spoken unto you,

227
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:30,140
being yet present with you.

228
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:37,860
So Jesus, in between and repeatedly throughout this period of time with his disciples,

229
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:42,700
he's going to reiterate this truth that he's speaking these things to them,

230
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,000
that he's giving them this truth.

231
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
And he says in chapter 14 and verse number 25,

232
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I'm speaking these things to you, being yet present with you.

233
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,740
Jesus was not going to be present with them for much longer, physically speaking.

234
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,080
We understand that he says in the very next verse,

235
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:04,160
but the comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name,

236
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,260
he shall teach you all things and bring all things to remembrance,

237
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:12,960
whatsoever notice I have said unto you.

238
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,460
I'm thankful for the ministry of the Holy Spirit of God.

239
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:19,260
You know, if you saturate your mind with the word of God,

240
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:26,000
the Holy Spirit of God will regularly bring up, remind you of biblical truth.

241
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,880
The reality is that if you don't saturate your mind with the scriptures,

242
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,180
that God is not going to just, bam, bring some scripture principle in your mind

243
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:38,180
that you never heard or never read or do not know.

244
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:42,640
But no, as we saturate our minds, as we read regularly,

245
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:48,020
as we hear the truth of God's word, the Holy Spirit of God uses that.

246
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:51,260
It's amazing to me, those of you that have taught, that have preached,

247
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,620
you can understand this.

248
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:58,020
It's amazing to me how often, even in the midst of teaching and preaching,

249
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:02,380
that the Holy Spirit of God will bring up a verse of scripture that's not in my notes,

250
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:05,380
it's not something that I prepared to say or to go to,

251
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,780
but the Holy Spirit brings it to mind.

252
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:11,900
Why? Because I've saturated my mind with his word.

253
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:15,380
And can I tell you that in your life, that when you deal with a trial,

254
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:21,380
when you deal with a difficulty, when you're going through that daily routine of life,

255
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:24,180
as you've saturated your mind with the scripture,

256
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:27,820
the Holy Spirit of God will remind you.

257
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,740
He'll bring it to your remembrance.

258
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:34,620
In the text, he's speaking in chapter 14 and verse 15, he says this,

259
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,660
If ye love me, keep my commandments, and I will pray the Father,

260
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:42,500
and he shall give you another comforter, that he may abide with you forever.

261
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,340
And we find that he's talking about this comforter,

262
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:50,180
the Holy Spirit that he was going to give, what joy that this is.

263
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:53,020
And Jesus is speaking these things to them.

264
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:58,140
Why? To encourage them, to prepare them, to help them to have the joy.

265
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:01,540
He says, I will not, verse 18, leave you comfortless.

266
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,260
I will come to you.

267
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,020
Isn't that a precious truth?

268
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:07,500
He says, I'm speaking these things to you.

269
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,860
Listen, these are things to embrace.

270
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,020
There's something to embrace.

271
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:14,260
Notice in chapter 15 and verse number 11, he says again,

272
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:19,380
These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you,

273
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:22,340
and that your joy might be full.

274
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:25,220
We understand that as God's people, as Christians,

275
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:29,620
we ought to be the most joyful people on the face of the earth.

276
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:33,660
The joy of the Lord is my strength.

277
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,780
Rejoice in the Lord always.

278
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:38,620
And again, I say rejoice.

279
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:41,620
Joy unspeakable and full of glory.

280
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,180
In 1 Peter, he's speaking about having joy.

281
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,620
And in the midst of speaking about joy, he says,

282
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:50,180
if need be, you're in manifold temptations.

283
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:56,820
The trying of our faith, it bears forth, it brings forth that which is precious,

284
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,740
the work that God is doing.

285
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:02,940
And even in the midst of those difficulties, we can have joy.

286
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,620
Why? Because it's his joy.

287
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:10,140
You know, there's so many people that are trying to manufacture joy today.

288
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:14,540
They use and they try to speak of joy in the terms of happiness,

289
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:16,340
and they try to manufacture it.

290
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:19,620
There's a place in Florida that some of us have visited.

291
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:22,220
They say it's the happiest place on earth.

292
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:25,020
And the reality is that if you've ever been there,

293
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:29,900
you find some of the most miserable people you'll ever find on the face of the earth.

294
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,420
It's 105 degrees.

295
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:34,220
You've been standing in a line for three hours to go on one ride.

296
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,140
Your kids are crying.

297
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,500
You've got to use the bathroom, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

298
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:41,220
And it's the happiest place on earth.

299
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,020
Isn't that what they say?

300
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,660
Listen, people are trying to manufacture joy.

301
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:49,220
If you get this, if you have this, it'll bring you happiness.

302
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:49,980
It'll bring you joy.

303
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:54,820
Can I tell you that joy is found in the person of Jesus Christ?

304
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:57,380
And he says, I'm giving you these things.

305
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:01,180
I'm speaking these things unto you that your joy, that my joy might remain in you,

306
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,300
and that your joy might be full.

307
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,380
Look at verse 17 here in John 15.

308
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:11,180
He says, these things I command you that you love one another.

309
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:14,300
You know, I want you to think about what would happen in the days ahead

310
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:17,940
and all that would take place with the religious leaders of the day

311
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:22,540
and then with the persecution that would rise from the Jewish leaders

312
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:25,860
there in the book of Acts and all that would transpire.

313
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:31,540
Listen, they would have to understand this love one for another

314
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,900
as they would be scattered, as they would face persecution.

315
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:39,060
Listen, I'm thankful for the bond that we have as brothers and sisters in Christ.

316
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,700
I'm thankful for the family of God.

317
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:45,820
I'm thankful that when we deal with opposition and adversity and difficulty

318
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:49,020
that we have brothers and sisters in Christ, that we love one another.

319
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:51,180
He says, listen, I'm commanding you this.

320
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:51,860
Why?

321
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,780
Because I know what's going to happen.

322
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:54,740
I know what's going to.

323
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:57,780
Listen, none of us can be on an island to ourselves.

324
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:01,420
We cannot have this perspective of I'm just independent.

325
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:05,380
I don't need anybody.

326
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,340
We need each other.

327
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:13,700
Why are there so many commands in God's word of one another in the New Testament?

328
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,820
It was one of my biggest issues.

329
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,700
I shouldn't say biggest because I had so many of them,

330
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:21,540
but one of my issues with 2020 and COVID and all the lockdowns

331
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,620
and all the things they try to do.

332
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:26,700
Listen, as God's people, we have the responsibility

333
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,780
of fulfilling the one another commands.

334
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:32,620
And how can we do that if we're not together?

335
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:35,660
A church is a called out assembly.

336
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,340
It's what it is.

337
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:40,940
We find here this morning that Jesus, knowing what would take place,

338
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:44,380
he says, I'm commanding you that you love one another.

339
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,460
You're going to need each other.

340
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:50,460
John 16 and verse number 1, these things have I spoken unto you

341
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:53,620
that you should not be offended.

342
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:57,900
Notice where he says in verse 2, they shall put you out of the synagogues.

343
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,900
And then he says, if you are of the world,

344
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,900
the world will hate you, but because you're not of the world,

345
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,900
I have chosen you out of the world.

346
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,900
Therefore, the world hateth you.

347
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,900
Listen, sometimes we walk around as Christians and say,

348
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:09,900
why does the world hate me?

349
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:13,900
Listen, if the world hates you, it's a good thing.

350
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:17,900
If the world loves you, I'd be concerned.

351
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,900
I'm being honest.

352
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,900
If the world loves you, I'd be concerned.

353
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,900
If the world hates you, I'd be concerned.

354
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,900
I'm being honest.

355
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:30,900
If the world loves you, I would be concerned.

356
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,900
We often talk about separation, come out from among them and be separate,

357
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,900
but can I tell you this morning that if we live godly lives,

358
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,900
they're going to separate from us.

359
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,900
We don't even really have to separate from them.

360
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,900
They're going to just separate from us.

361
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:43,900
Why?

362
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:47,900
Because men love darkness rather than light.

363
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,900
And so we find that Jesus says, listen, I'm speaking these,

364
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,900
there are some things that are going to happen,

365
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,900
and I'm speaking these things unto you.

366
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,900
I'm trying to give you the instruction that you need.

367
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,900
Look in verse number four of John 16,

368
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:03,900
but these things have I told you that when the time shall come,

369
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,900
you may remember that I told you of them.

370
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:09,900
And these things I said not unto you at the beginning because I was with you.

371
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,900
And so we find that Jesus says, I'm telling you these things

372
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,900
because I know what's going to happen.

373
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,900
And I'm preparing you.

374
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:22,900
I'm providing for you that which you need.

375
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:27,900
And when the time comes, you're going to remember that I told you of them.

376
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,900
What a joy to know that our God loves us so much

377
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,900
that he's given us the truth that we need.

378
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,900
There's something to embrace.

379
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,900
We find in verse seven of John 16, Jesus says,

380
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,900
nevertheless, I tell you the truth.

381
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,900
I tell you, he's speaking to them.

382
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:46,900
It is expedient for you that I go away.

383
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,900
See, they really didn't want him to go away.

384
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,900
And I understand why.

385
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,900
But Jesus says it's necessary.

386
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,900
It's appropriate.

387
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,900
It's expedient for you that I go away.

388
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,900
It's absolutely necessary for if I go not away,

389
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,900
the comforter will not come unto you.

390
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:05,900
But if I depart, I will send him unto you.

391
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:09,900
And Jesus concludes once again in chapter 16 and verse number 33,

392
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,900
these things I have spoken unto you.

393
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:18,900
Listen, Jesus was deliberate with what he said to his disciples.

394
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,900
It is imperative this morning that these disciples

395
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:25,900
would have understood the importance of the message that was being given.

396
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,900
But I would say for each of us this morning,

397
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,900
it's imperative that we understand that God's Word is profitable.

398
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,900
That God has given us exactly what we need,

399
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,900
and there is something to embrace.

400
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,900
That we embrace the truth of God's Word.

401
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,900
That we hold it dear.

402
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:48,900
That we seek the face of God through his precious Word.

403
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:53,900
Not only do I find in John 16 and verse 33 that there's something to embrace,

404
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:57,900
but number two, there's something to expect.

405
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,900
The Bible says this in John 16 and verse 33.

406
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,740
these things I have spoken unto you."

407
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,940
Notice, number one, when we think about this expectation

408
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:09,880
that in me, you might have peace.

409
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,140
I'm so thankful that he is the prince of peace.

410
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,380
I'm so thankful that he is a peace,

411
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,580
according to what Paul said,

412
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:19,060
that passeth all understanding.

413
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:23,260
I'm thankful that even in the text of this dialogue

414
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,340
that Jesus has with his disciples,

415
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:28,660
and of course we have the division of chapters and verses,

416
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,780
but really he's just giving in this intimate setting

417
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:35,260
all of this instruction that we have divided into chapters.

418
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,820
He's providing this instruction to his disciples.

419
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:41,860
And notice back in John 14 and verse 27,

420
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:45,580
notice what Jesus says with regard to peace.

421
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:48,160
He says, listen, there's something to embrace.

422
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,420
I've spoken these things I have spoken unto you,

423
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,100
but there's something to expect.

424
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:57,760
He says, listen, in me, you might have peace.

425
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,280
Notice in John 14 and verse number 27,

426
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:03,680
Jesus says this, peace I leave with you.

427
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,320
Do you notice the next word?

428
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:11,060
My peace I give unto you.

429
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:15,120
Not as the world giveth, give I unto you.

430
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,380
Let not your heart be troubled,

431
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:20,380
neither let it be afraid.

432
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,860
We understand as we study the scriptures,

433
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:26,000
the importance of this truth of peace.

434
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,160
And we find that God has promised to give us this peace.

435
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,120
And he says that it's his peace.

436
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,260
He said, my peace give I unto thee,

437
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,720
not as the world giveth.

438
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:39,440
Listen, I'm thankful that Jesus gives us a peace

439
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,240
that passeth all understanding,

440
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,700
that he will keep us in perfect peace.

441
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,520
The Bible says to who?

442
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:51,360
To those who have their minds stayed upon him.

443
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,340
And you think about this truth this morning

444
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,880
as we look at the scriptures and we understand,

445
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:59,500
listen, we live in a world today that's seeking for peace.

446
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,960
They're longing for peace,

447
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,760
but they're looking for it in all the wrong places

448
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,800
for Jesus is the prince of peace.

449
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,740
And he offers peace.

450
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:12,680
He says, my peace give I unto thee.

451
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:16,180
Listen, I'm so thankful this morning

452
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:20,880
that God's peace can rule in our hearts.

453
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,520
That's what Paul says to the believers in Colossae.

454
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:28,400
Let the peace of God rule in your hearts.

455
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,160
There's all kinds of things that are going to try

456
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,200
to take place of that peace of God.

457
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,280
The turmoil, the trouble, the tribulation, the difficulties,

458
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:41,240
but he says that we're to let the peace of God

459
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,600
rule in our hearts.

460
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,680
That we understand that Jesus,

461
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,640
as he's instructing these disciples

462
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,080
and he tells them these important truths,

463
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,920
he says, listen, not only is there something to embrace,

464
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,640
not only am I speaking these things to you,

465
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,240
but there's something to expect.

466
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:59,480
And number one, you have to understand that in me,

467
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,360
you might have peace.

468
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,640
In me, in the Lord Jesus Christ.

469
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,440
But notice what he says in John 16.

470
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,320
He says, in me, you might have peace,

471
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,800
but he follows it up and says this,

472
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:14,800
in the world, you shall have tribulation.

473
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,480
We know a little bit about that, don't we?

474
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,440
He says, in me, what a great contrast.

475
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:28,320
In me, you might have peace.

476
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:33,320
In the world, you shall have tribulation.

477
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:40,280
We have a world full of tribulation, trouble, trial.

478
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,640
The disciples were going to face tribulation.

479
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,000
The disciples were gonna face persecution.

480
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,640
They were gonna deal with difficulties and adversity.

481
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:51,380
And Jesus lets them know that even though

482
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,300
in the world they're gonna have tribulation,

483
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:57,060
that in him, they can have peace.

484
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,940
This is a great truth that is given to us in John 16

485
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:03,060
in verse number 33, that yes, we understand

486
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:05,700
that in that world, there's going to be tribulation

487
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,580
and we see it, we experience it,

488
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:12,100
we understand this morning the way that the world operates.

489
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,580
But I understand this morning that though

490
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,860
all of the enemy is raging and all the wickedness

491
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,980
that is taking place and all the tribulation

492
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:24,260
that is around me, that we can still have peace.

493
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,340
Why?

494
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:29,620
Because Jesus said, in me, you might have peace.

495
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:33,420
He said in Hebrews 13, I will never leave thee

496
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,900
nor forsake thee.

497
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,580
We find that in Acts chapter 12,

498
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:38,460
it's an interesting passage of scripture

499
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:42,020
in which God provides for us an account

500
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:45,180
of what's taking place with the persecution

501
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:48,380
and Herod and all that he's doing

502
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,660
and killing James and intending to kill Peter

503
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:53,740
and putting him in prison and the church is praying

504
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:55,460
and all that is taking place.

505
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:59,900
And Peter, listen, Peter saw what happened to James.

506
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,500
He was aware of what happened to James.

507
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,140
Peter understood the plan of Herod, if you will.

508
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:09,340
The church understood the seriousness of the situation.

509
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:11,620
They had an all-night church prayer meeting.

510
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,620
You know what Peter's doing while they're praying?

511
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,500
He's sleeping.

512
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:21,340
If that's not a great picture of peace,

513
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,860
I don't know what else would be.

514
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:29,100
Then in the midst of all that was taking place,

515
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:32,580
in the midst of the understanding that I'm next,

516
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:35,740
I mean, he has me in prison and he's intending to kill me.

517
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,060
He already killed James.

518
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,700
He's gonna do it.

519
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:42,180
The church is praying fervently.

520
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,540
Peter's asleep.

521
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:47,900
He's asleep.

522
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,700
He has peace.

523
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:52,980
In the world, you shall have tribulation.

524
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:56,340
But in me, you might have peace.

525
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:03,140
How is it that we view the circumstances of life?

526
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,620
Have you ever heard somebody say this

527
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:06,740
when you ask them how they're doing?

528
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,540
Well, under the circumstances.

529
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:11,540
Whoever told us that we're to live under the circumstances?

530
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,420
Amen?

531
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:15,420
We're not to live under the circumstances.

532
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:18,780
But so often what happens is we get our focus

533
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,900
so much on our circumstances

534
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:24,060
and we're not focused upon our God.

535
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,780
And it's in him that we have peace.

536
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,740
It's in the world that there's tribulation.

537
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:31,340
And we fill up our minds with all that's going on

538
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,700
in the world and all the trial and all the tribulation.

539
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,460
And we have no rest.

540
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,020
We have no peace.

541
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:39,980
I think about Peter.

542
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,420
We mentioned in Acts chapter 12.

543
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:44,660
But you think about Peter when he walked on the water.

544
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,940
Jesus comes walking on the water.

545
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,100
And I mean, what a scene it must have been

546
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:53,660
in the midst of a storm and all this taking place

547
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:56,540
and they see him and it's Jesus.

548
00:26:56,540 --> 00:27:00,180
He's walking on the water and Peter's the only one.

549
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:01,580
He gets criticized.

550
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,780
But I'm telling you what, he's the only one

551
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,980
that said, if it be thee, bid thee come to thee.

552
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,820
Bid me come to thee.

553
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:10,420
He's the only one that took a step out of the boat.

554
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,460
So we can criticize him for sinking in the water,

555
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:15,420
but he's the only one that got out of the boat.

556
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,580
Amen?

557
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:18,820
And that means that most of us, if we were there,

558
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,660
we would have stayed in the boat too.

559
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,100
All right?

560
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:27,100
And Peter said, if it be thee, bid me come to thee.

561
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,580
And Jesus says, come, and he steps out of the water.

562
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,820
What's he doing when he's walking?

563
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,980
I don't know how many steps he took.

564
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:33,980
And neither do you.

565
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,700
But he had to take a certain number of steps.

566
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,380
He gets to wherever he gets to.

567
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:39,740
And what is he focused on?

568
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,580
Well, he's focused on Jesus.

569
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:45,700
Did he know that the storm was raging?

570
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:49,780
Did he know that there was a storm before he saw Jesus?

571
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:50,620
Sure he did.

572
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,340
They were in the midst of the storm.

573
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:55,140
He knew that the storm was raging,

574
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,740
but his focus was on Jesus.

575
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,420
But when he took his eyes off Jesus,

576
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:01,140
what happened?

577
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:01,980
Began to sink.

578
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,340
Now, he had enough sense to say, Lord, save me.

579
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,900
The Bible says that they got back.

580
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:12,300
I believe they walked back on water to the boat.

581
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,260
When Peter took his eyes off Jesus,

582
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,420
listen, the storm didn't cease

583
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,900
until they got back on the boat.

584
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,740
And we find that as you look at the passage of Scripture,

585
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:27,740
that Peter, as his focus, his gaze is upon Jesus,

586
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,740
and he's not focused on his circumstances,

587
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,900
he's walking on the water.

588
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:35,900
But when his gaze gets fixed on the circumstances,

589
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,619
the waves being boisterous and all that's taking place,

590
00:28:38,619 --> 00:28:40,900
he begins to sink.

591
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:41,740
Listen, this morning,

592
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:44,100
sometimes we have our focus in the wrong place.

593
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,780
We're gazing at our problems

594
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:50,900
and just simply glancing at our Savior,

595
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:55,180
when in reality, we must be gazing at our Savior

596
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:58,320
and simply glancing at our circumstances.

597
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,500
The Bible says in Hebrews chapter 12,

598
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:06,500
looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith.

599
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:10,140
We keep our eyes on Jesus.

600
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,220
We find that there's something to expect.

601
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,619
Jesus says, I've spoken these things,

602
00:29:15,619 --> 00:29:17,300
these things I have spoken unto you

603
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:21,059
that in me, you might have peace.

604
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:24,220
In the world, you shall have tribulation.

605
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,380
So we know that this is to be expected.

606
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:29,500
In fact, we'll be studying it here in just a few weeks

607
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:33,660
as we continue studying through the book of 2 Timothy.

608
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:37,500
We find that in chapter number three,

609
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,100
Paul is giving Timothy truth

610
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:43,860
with regard to the end times, the last days.

611
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:46,860
And he says in verse number 10 of 2 Timothy three,

612
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:49,619
but thou has fully known my doctrine,

613
00:29:49,619 --> 00:29:51,580
matter of life, purpose, faith,

614
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:54,059
long-suffering, charity, patience,

615
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:55,700
persecutions, afflictions,

616
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:58,980
which come unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra.

617
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:04,180
I endured, but then he says this, but out of them all the Lord delivered me, yea, and

618
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:09,380
all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution."

619
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,220
There's going to be tribulation.

620
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:17,540
In fact, as you look in 2 Timothy chapter number 2, as we'll be dealing with it next

621
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:24,700
week, verse number 3, thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.

622
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:31,540
There's going to be hardships, but the soldier endures because he's got his eyes on Jesus

623
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:36,140
and he's understanding that in him we can have peace.

624
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:40,940
You have no peace, you're lacking peace, you're troubled.

625
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:43,860
Jesus says let not your heart be troubled.

626
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,740
Jesus says in me you can have peace.

627
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:47,820
Pastor, did you see what happened?

628
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:48,820
Did you see the news?

629
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:49,820
Did you see this?

630
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:50,820
Did you see that?

631
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:53,100
What's going on with this and what's going to happen there?

632
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:57,180
In me, Jesus said.

633
00:30:57,180 --> 00:31:01,820
In me, Jesus said, you might have peace.

634
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:05,260
In the world, there's going to be tribulation.

635
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,260
Do we not see it?

636
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:09,660
It's all around us.

637
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:16,860
I just mentioned this to somebody last week, two weeks ago, and it was not any real scientific

638
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:23,980
calculation that I used to come up with it, but during the days of COVID, so many were

639
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:31,540
glued to their TV and watching all of the news because of, well, you couldn't go anywhere.

640
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:37,180
And I would say regularly to people that if you, you should have a ratio of four to one.

641
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:42,740
If you watch the news for an hour, you better read the Bible for four.

642
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:45,860
There was nothing scientific about it, I just kind of pulled it out of my hat and just kind

643
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:46,860
of four to one.

644
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,900
I thought it sounded good.

645
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:53,180
But I would tell you that that stands true, not just during a COVID year, but during any

646
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:59,860
time because we need to have these things that God has given to us.

647
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:05,900
We need to embrace them because in Him, we have peace.

648
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,340
We know these things.

649
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:13,300
Listen, Jesus has revealed to us just as He did to His disciples here in this portion

650
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:18,300
of Scripture, in these pages of Scripture, He revealed to them the things that were

651
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:24,340
going to happen, and He's preparing them, and He's given to us truth that as we embrace

652
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:27,900
it, that we can expect, look, there's going to be tribulation, but He said in Him there's

653
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:28,900
peace.

654
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:32,940
And what joy that is to every child of God.

655
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:42,140
I find in John 16 and verse 33, there's something to embrace, there's something to expect, but

656
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:46,980
I find there's someone to exalt.

657
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:50,940
In John 16 and verse 33, there's someone to exalt.

658
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:56,060
He says, in the world you shall have tribulation, but be of good cheer.

659
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,060
Why?

660
00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:00,940
I have overcome the world.

661
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,940
Isn't that exciting?

662
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,700
Listen, there's someone to exalt.

663
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:07,340
We serve the King of kings and Lord of lords.

664
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:12,780
We understand this morning that because of who He is, because of the fact that He says

665
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:18,900
I have overcome the world, because of His victory, that we can be of good cheer, that

666
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:23,860
we do not need to walk through this life, we don't have to say, woe is me, and dragging

667
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:28,420
our lip on the ground and saying I'm so overwhelmed and I have all these problems and all these

668
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,420
difficulties.

669
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:32,620
No, Jesus said you're going to have persecution.

670
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,780
You're going to deal with tribulation.

671
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:37,340
But in Him there's peace and be of good cheer.

672
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,340
Why?

673
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:40,380
I have overcome the world.

674
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:44,300
We are on the winning side.

675
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,780
You say it doesn't seem like it, it doesn't look like it.

676
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:53,100
Get your eyes off of that stuff and get your eyes on Jesus because there's someone to exalt.

677
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,360
There's someone that is victorious.

678
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,360
He's our Savior.

679
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,420
He's my God.

680
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:58,420
He's my shield.

681
00:33:58,420 --> 00:33:59,620
He's my buckler.

682
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,880
He's my strong tower.

683
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,020
He's my everything.

684
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:07,820
This morning as we get our focus on God, as we get our focus on our Lord and understand

685
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:14,220
that He's overcome the world, that we too are overcomers.

686
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:18,420
That He's victorious and we too are victorious.

687
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,740
What a joy.

688
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:26,380
Too many Christians today are living under the circumstances.

689
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:33,240
Too many Christians today are not embracing the Word that God has given to us.

690
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:37,780
Too many Christians today are acting like they didn't know that we should expect these

691
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:44,840
things even though God's told us these things.

692
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:51,100
Too many Christians are failing to exalt the Lord Jesus Christ.

693
00:34:51,100 --> 00:35:00,260
As we live, we act, we talk as if our Savior's been defeated.

694
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:03,140
How sad that is.

695
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:05,620
Victory is ours.

696
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:07,540
Victory is sure.

697
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,260
We're not defeated.

698
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:11,900
We have an enemy but He is a defeated foe.

699
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,740
Greater is He that is in you than He that is in the world.

700
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:19,180
Is that not what the Bible says in 1 John 4?

701
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:25,100
We find that He tells us that we are more than conquerors in Christ.

702
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:27,740
We find it in 1 Corinthians in chapter 15.

703
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:31,380
He tells us, but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory.

704
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,380
How?

705
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:35,180
Through our Lord Jesus Christ.

706
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:39,680
Listen this morning, we need to exalt the Lord Jesus Christ and see Him in His rightful

707
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:43,620
place and understand that He has overcome the world.

708
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:46,820
Listen Satan tried to do everything he could.

709
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:49,860
He understood the spiritual war and the spiritual battle.

710
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:54,420
He did everything that he could to prevent the Lord Jesus Christ from going to the cross

711
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:58,660
of Calvary in the first place and then after He goes to the cross He does everything that

712
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:03,780
He can to prevent the resurrection but there's nothing He can do.

713
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:11,280
He's defeated because God is greater and we have to see Him in that rightful place.

714
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,780
Great is the Lord and greatly to be praised.

715
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:17,700
We need to see Him high, holy and lifted up.

716
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,260
We need to see Him exalted.

717
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:24,360
We find in John 17 that as Jesus says the hour has come glorify thy son that thy son

718
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,980
also may glorify thee.

719
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:30,680
We find that in verse number 2 the Bible says as thou hast given Him power over all flesh

720
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:35,760
that He should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given Him and this is life eternal

721
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:40,220
that they might know thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.

722
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:42,580
I have glorified thee on the earth.

723
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:48,120
I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.

724
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:53,780
You know at that point Jesus had not yet gone to the cross but He was able to say that He

725
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:59,460
had finished the work because it was so absolutely certain that He would go to the cross.

726
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:04,380
He would bury and He would rise again that He would speak in absolute terms of an event

727
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:10,340
that had not yet taken place because we can't talk that way because I don't know what's

728
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:15,580
going to happen tomorrow but He can and He did.

729
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:18,820
And as He hung upon that cross He said it is finished.

730
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:23,700
He was buried in that borrowed tomb in the grave.

731
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:30,400
We sing the song often times on resurrection Sunday the grave that could not hold Him.

732
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,380
He tore the bars away up from the grave He arose.

733
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,680
He conquered sin, death and the grave.

734
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,300
He lives forevermore.

735
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,820
Hallelujah.

736
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:41,700
What a Savior.

737
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:46,300
Notice with me if you will Revelation chapter 5 when we consider that there's someone to

738
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:53,160
exalt understand this morning that we are to exalt and magnify the Lord Jesus Christ

739
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,820
every day of our lives.

740
00:37:55,820 --> 00:38:00,220
We're to keep our eyes upon Him fixated upon Him exalting Him seeing Him in His rightful

741
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,620
place lifting Him up.

742
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:06,180
We come to Revelation chapter number 5 and I'm going to take the time to read the portion

743
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:11,780
of Scripture because it's so encouraging and so helpful for me as a believer, as a

744
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:17,560
Christian to enter into the throne room of heaven as God gives us this glimpse in Revelation

745
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:25,020
chapter 5 and what truth is here for us and how helpful it is as we see our exalted Savior

746
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,020
this morning.

747
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:28,460
He says I have overcome the world.

748
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:35,380
Notice in Revelation chapter 5 in verse number 1 the Bible says and I saw in the right hand

749
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:40,100
of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven

750
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:50,220
seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the

751
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:57,820
book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the

752
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:02,100
earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and what is John doing verse

753
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:07,940
4 and I wept much why because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book

754
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:17,180
neither to look therein and one of the elders said unto me weep not behold the lion of the

755
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:26,080
tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals

756
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:30,900
thereof and I beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the

757
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:39,040
midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes

758
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:43,840
which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth and he came and took the

759
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:49,180
book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the

760
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:54,560
book the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one

761
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,980
of them harps and golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of saints.

762
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:02,820
In verse 9, it says, they sung a new song, saying,

763
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:09,060
Thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof, why?

764
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:15,100
For Thou wast slain and hast redeemed us to God by Thy blood out of every kindred and

765
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:21,140
tongue and people and nation, and hast made us unto our God kings and priests, and we

766
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:25,020
shall reign on the earth.

767
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:30,100
And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne, and the beasts

768
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:35,220
and the elders, and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands

769
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:43,380
of thousands, saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power

770
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:52,820
and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing, and every creature

771
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:59,420
which is in heaven, and on the earth and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and

772
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:06,420
all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him

773
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:12,140
that sitteth upon the throne and upon the Lamb forever and ever.

774
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:16,660
The four beasts said, Amen, and the four and twenty elders fell down and worshipped him

775
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:20,540
that liveth forever and ever.

776
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:22,260
That's our God.

777
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:24,180
He rules and he reigns.

778
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:28,180
The heathen rage.

779
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:32,340
God shall laugh, has them in derision.

780
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:34,820
They hold their fist at God.

781
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:39,220
They think they're victorious.

782
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:46,420
But Jesus says, Be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.

783
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:52,860
When we take in context the entirety of what Jesus says in these few chapters of the Gospel

784
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:57,820
of John, we find that Jesus, there's something to embrace, why?

785
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:02,220
Because Jesus says, I want to prepare you, I'm being deliberate in what I'm speaking

786
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:06,060
to you, I want you to understand that the persecutions are going to come, I want you

787
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:09,700
to understand that the world's going to hate you, I want you to understand that they're

788
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:15,060
going to think, they're going to put you out of the synagogues and the time's going to

789
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:19,180
come when they, the one that thinks that they're killing you is doing God's service

790
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:24,300
and all of these things, and I'm telling you, I want you to have peace and I want you to

791
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:28,260
have joy and I want you to be able to remember these things.

792
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:30,940
There's something to embrace.

793
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:38,820
Listen, this morning, we need to be in the Bible, we need to be in the Bible.

794
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:43,580
There's a lot going on in our world.

795
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:46,220
A lot going on in our world.

796
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:51,180
But I submit to you this morning that our God's still on His throne.

797
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:57,340
He's never going to be overthrown, He's never going to be defeated, He's never going to,

798
00:42:57,340 --> 00:43:00,100
He's on His throne and He forever will be.

799
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:04,820
The Bible says, the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.

800
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:07,700
He rules and He reigns.

801
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:10,580
Everything's happening in His time.

802
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:18,340
Everything's falling into place, just as He said it would, because He knows all things.

803
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:23,820
And He has revealed to us in His Word these truths and He's providentially preserved for

804
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:27,940
us the Bible so that we could know them and we must embrace them.

805
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:34,940
How often we have people today, I mean people that profess to be believers, followers of

806
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:41,500
Christ that do not have a biblical worldview.

807
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:48,780
Their worldview is shaped by whatever news group that they listen to, that they watch,

808
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:51,740
that they read.

809
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:57,980
I shared with you weeks ago the statistics of worldview, biblical worldview.

810
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:03,020
Listen, that's a serious situation in our society today.

811
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:05,820
Of those that profess Christ, they don't have a biblical worldview, why?

812
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:10,180
Because they're not embracing the Word.

813
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:17,700
But Jesus says, these things I have spoken unto you.

814
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:20,860
This morning, we need to embrace His Word.

815
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:24,660
We need to expect that there's going to be tribulation.

816
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:29,460
In the world, you shall have tribulation, but we need to understand that in Him, we

817
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:31,420
can have peace.

818
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:34,500
And He says, be of good cheer.

819
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,420
Isn't that amazing?

820
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:42,620
In the midst of all that's taking place, I mean some of the message that Jesus is giving

821
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:47,700
to His disciples with regard to the hatred that they would face and the persecution that

822
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:53,420
they would face and the tribulation that they would endure, He says, be of good cheer.

823
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:55,140
Be of good cheer.

824
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:56,380
Why?

825
00:44:56,380 --> 00:45:01,100
Because I have overcome the world.

826
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:04,020
I have overcome the world.

827
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:06,940
There's someone to exalt.

828
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:14,220
This morning, this week, in our lives, we need to be diligent and purposed in exalting

829
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:20,380
the Lord Jesus Christ, lifting Him up, seeing Him in His rightful place, high, holy and

830
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:22,100
lifted up.

831
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:24,220
Because we serve a great God.

832
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:28,460
We serve the victorious Savior.

833
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:34,700
And thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory.

834
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:38,700
John would say this in 1 John chapter number 5.

835
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:41,980
We sing the song, faith is the victory.

836
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:42,980
You familiar with the song?

837
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:51,740
Well, 1 John 5 and verse 4 says, for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world, and this

838
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:56,860
is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.

839
00:45:56,860 --> 00:45:59,540
Who is He that overcometh the world?

840
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:04,180
But He that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God.

841
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:05,180
Faith is the victory.

842
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:08,020
We sing the song, victory in Jesus.

843
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:10,380
Isn't it wonderful?

844
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:13,860
But sometimes we live like we've been conquered.

845
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:16,740
No, Jesus says, be of good cheer.

846
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:19,700
I have overcome the world.

847
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:20,700
Let's pray together.

848
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:21,840
Lord, we love You.

849
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:23,020
We thank You for loving us.

850
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:29,580
We thank You for Your Word, the truth contained therein.

851
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:39,380
The message that was delivered to the disciples in this intimate setting was so valuable.

852
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:43,620
You've chosen to give us a recorded, written Word.

853
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:48,540
It's inspired and preserved.

854
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:54,500
I pray that You'd help us as Your people to embrace Your Word.

855
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:58,860
Help us to go through life with our eyes wide open, knowing that You've revealed to us the

856
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:01,900
things that we should expect.

857
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:09,460
Help us to abide in You that we might have Your peace, a peace that passeth understanding,

858
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:12,740
that Your peace would truly rule in our hearts.

859
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:20,620
And God, I thank You that You overcome the world, that You're victorious.

860
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:28,980
I pray that You would help us to exalt You in our lives daily, in our church corporately,

861
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:34,020
that we'd see You in Your rightful place, high, holy, and lifted up.

862
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:39,940
God, we'd be found faithful until that day that we meet You face to face.

863
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:46,340
In the midst of all that's taking place, would You help us to be of good cheer?

864
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:50,940
Would You help us to keep our eyes on Thee?

865
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:56,620
Lord, in this moment of invitation, maybe there's someone that's not sure of heaven.

866
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:59,140
They need to be saved this morning.

867
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:03,940
I pray that the Holy Spirit of God would convict them of their sin, of Christ's righteousness

868
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:05,860
and of judgment to come.

869
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:11,500
Father, maybe there's someone here this morning, maybe several, Lord, that are Your children

870
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:16,300
that are troubled, that don't have that peace that we spoke of this morning.

871
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:19,700
They're not of good cheer.

872
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:21,460
They're troubled by all that's going on.

873
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:26,820
God, would You help them this morning to refocus?

874
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:35,180
Would You help them, Lord, to fix their gaze upon Thee, to embrace the truth of Your Word,

875
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:42,260
to know that You have revealed to us those things that would transpire in the days ahead?

876
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:44,860
I pray that You'd move and work as only You can.

877
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:47,820
We'll give You the honor and glory for all that You'll do.

878
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:49,180
For it's in Christ's name we pray.
