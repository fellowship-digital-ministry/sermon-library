00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400
John, we'll be in John chapter number 16,

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.199
John chapter number 16 this morning.

00:00:06.199 --> 00:00:07.880
I'll read the verse of scripture

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.800
that we'll be using for our message this morning.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.359
We'll be referencing a number of different passages

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:16.319
of scripture as well, so have your fingers ready

00:00:16.319 --> 00:00:18.200
this morning, John chapter number 16.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.079
I love the gospel of John,

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:22.520
and obviously I love the Bible.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.360
All of it is good, it's profitable,

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.879
and we're thankful for it.

00:00:26.879 --> 00:00:29.239
But there's something about the gospel of John

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.280
for me personally, specifically,

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.439
I thoroughly enjoy reading through the gospel of John.

00:00:35.439 --> 00:00:37.439
I just read it again last week

00:00:37.439 --> 00:00:40.840
and just thoroughly was blessed and encouraged.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.639
John 16, in verse number 33,

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:44.919
notice what the Bible says.

00:00:44.919 --> 00:00:48.360
These things I have spoken unto you,

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.240
that in me you might have peace.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.560
In the world you shall have tribulation,

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.560
but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.959
Jesus gives these words to the disciples

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:07.160
and what precious words they are.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.599
I've titled the message from this verse of scripture,

00:01:09.599 --> 00:01:11.000
be of good cheer.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.120
John chapter number 12 records for us

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.839
the triumphal entry of the Lord Jesus Christ

00:01:15.839 --> 00:01:18.160
as he makes his way into Jerusalem.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.919
And we understand that even as that event

00:01:20.919 --> 00:01:23.440
is given to us and the record is provided

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.760
in John chapter number 12,

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.599
that it was 500 years earlier

00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:32.000
that Zachariah prophesied of this very event taking place.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
And as Jesus would make his triumphal entry into Jerusalem

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.199
and there were many that were crying out

00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:41.279
and worshiping and all that was taking place.

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:44.959
And of course, in just a short period of time,

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:48.000
those cries changed drastically

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.080
where as he's riding in and all that's taking place

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.000
and we look at that triumphal entry

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.559
and we look at how they were glorifying.

00:01:56.559 --> 00:02:00.040
And it says in verse 15, fear not daughter of Zion,

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.440
behold thy King cometh sitting on an ass's colt.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.599
And he's coming in the fulfillment again

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:07.279
of what Zachariah would say.

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:11.759
And by the time you get to the 18th and 19th chapter

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:12.800
of the book of John,

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.160
you find that the crowd is crying crucify him, crucify him.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.399
And what changes have taken place

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:21.679
in just a short period of time in Jerusalem.

00:02:22.279 --> 00:02:24.000
But we find that over the next few days

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.119
from John chapter 12 and the triumphal entry

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:28.679
of the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:02:28.679 --> 00:02:30.240
over the next few days,

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.679
we find that several things occur.

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:36.000
We find that in John chapter 13,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.399
God provides us with the record

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:42.399
of Jesus washing the feet of the disciples.

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:44.399
And of course, there's a great truth

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:46.559
in that passage of scripture

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:50.399
that we can understand the truth of being a servant,

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:52.440
the humility and what joy that is,

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.960
the great lesson that we learn of Peter

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.919
and his objection and the instruction that's given.

00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:02.199
But after that portion of scripture in John 13,

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:06.639
we find that Jesus to conclude the 13th chapter,

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:09.720
chapter 14, 15 and 16,

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.759
we find that in these pages of God's word

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:16.960
that Jesus is spending these times,

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.320
this period of time alone with his disciples.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.679
And as he's there alone with his disciples,

00:03:23.679 --> 00:03:26.520
we find that it is in this intimate setting

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.839
that Jesus is preparing his disciples

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:33.880
for that which will transpire in the days ahead.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.000
Not only immediately,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.679
but we find that even in their life and ministry

00:03:38.679 --> 00:03:40.000
and for us today,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.320
the truth of preparation is still found

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.440
within these words that Jesus spoke.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.679
We find that really John 16 and verse 33,

00:03:48.679 --> 00:03:50.759
the verse that I read a moment ago

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:53.960
that is our text for our message this morning

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.800
is a concluding verse.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.479
It closes out all that Jesus taught his disciples,

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:02.000
all of the instruction,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.240
all that he had communicated to them

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.160
during that special time.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.919
We find that Jesus in the gospel of John

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:12.320
regularly refers to his hour.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.919
And he speaks about in John chapter number two

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:17.079
that his hour is not yet come,

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:19.959
but we find that as immediately following

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.839
our text of scripture this morning,

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:25.119
that when you come to John 17 and verse number one,

00:04:25.119 --> 00:04:29.640
that Jesus says, father, the hour is come.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:30.799
What is he referring to?

00:04:30.799 --> 00:04:33.279
Well, he's going to the cross of Calvary.

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:37.239
He's going to pay for the sin of mankind.

00:04:37.239 --> 00:04:41.359
He's going to fulfill his singular purpose

00:04:41.359 --> 00:04:44.320
of coming to this earth and that's to save sinners.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.320
He had to go to the cross of Calvary.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.799
We understand that he was buried

00:04:47.799 --> 00:04:51.519
and he rose conquering sin, death and the grave.

00:04:51.519 --> 00:04:55.440
The things that would transpire in these days ahead

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.880
were going to be events that were going

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:03.440
to cause the disciples to have many emotional responses.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.399
There were several things that they were going

00:05:05.399 --> 00:05:08.839
to have to deal with, not only during the crucifixion,

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:11.399
the arrest and the trial and the crucifixion,

00:05:11.399 --> 00:05:14.480
the resurrection and then following thereafter.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.000
We find that as they would begin their ministry,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.399
as you study the book of Acts,

00:05:18.399 --> 00:05:22.600
that they would face much adversity and much persecution.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.480
And in these chapters of the gospel of John,

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:31.480
Jesus Christ is seeking to prepare his servants.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.839
I'm so thankful that our God knows all things.

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:38.679
I'm so thankful that he is alpha and omega.

00:05:38.679 --> 00:05:40.880
He is the beginning and the end.

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.679
I am so thankful that he knows all things

00:05:43.679 --> 00:05:46.640
and he has communicated to us as his people

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.679
what we need to know.

00:05:48.679 --> 00:05:51.119
And he has given us all that we need to know

00:05:51.119 --> 00:05:55.880
so that we would be prepared for all that we will face.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.079
The reality is that we're going to face some things.

00:05:58.079 --> 00:05:59.119
We're going to look at it in this text

00:05:59.119 --> 00:06:00.320
of scripture this morning.

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.160
We're going to face some things in life

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.399
and you are facing some things in life today,

00:06:05.399 --> 00:06:10.119
but we can rejoice that God has given us his word

00:06:10.119 --> 00:06:13.239
and in so doing, he has prepared us

00:06:13.239 --> 00:06:15.480
for that which we will face.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.720
You're in a situation where somebody tells you something

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.959
that you didn't know was that important

00:06:19.959 --> 00:06:22.920
when they were saying it and afterwards you found out,

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.799
man, I wish I was paying more attention to what they said.

00:06:25.799 --> 00:06:28.000
Maybe they were giving you some piece of instruction

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.519
for something you were going to do.

00:06:29.519 --> 00:06:32.399
Maybe they were providing you with some details

00:06:32.399 --> 00:06:35.399
with regard to accessing a property,

00:06:35.399 --> 00:06:39.279
whether it's through some means of disarming

00:06:39.279 --> 00:06:43.320
or arming some device or a combination for a lock.

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.519
And you say, man, I wish I would pay more attention

00:06:46.519 --> 00:06:47.600
to what was being said.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:48.440
Why?

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.959
Because I don't remember I'm stuck at this step.

00:06:51.959 --> 00:06:53.440
Ever happened to you?

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.079
Well, God's given us some instruction

00:06:55.079 --> 00:06:57.839
that we need to be very, very attentive to.

00:06:57.839 --> 00:06:58.679
Why?

00:06:58.679 --> 00:07:01.839
Because we're going to face some things in life.

00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:03.600
We're going to face some things in life

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:07.399
and God has provided us with the instruction that we need

00:07:07.399 --> 00:07:10.160
so that when the hour comes, when the day comes,

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:14.320
when the difficulty comes, that we can be prepared.

00:07:15.399 --> 00:07:17.679
The disciples heard these things audibly.

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.239
We have them written.

00:07:20.239 --> 00:07:21.799
Isn't that a blessing?

00:07:21.799 --> 00:07:24.320
You ever forget something that somebody told you audibly?

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.040
You ever forget something that you've read?

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.320
Sure you have.

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.320
Well, we have the blessing of being able to go back

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:32.160
to the precious Bible and being able to read

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.200
these words that Jesus spoke.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:35.880
If you're taking notes with me this morning,

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.640
notice number one, something to embrace.

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.679
As we look at John 16 and verse number 33,

00:07:40.679 --> 00:07:43.200
I find that there's something for us to embrace,

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:45.000
something for the disciples to embrace,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.959
but this morning for each of us

00:07:46.959 --> 00:07:49.440
as the people of God here in 2024,

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:51.399
there is something for us to embrace.

00:07:51.399 --> 00:07:53.399
Notice the way that the verse begins.

00:07:53.399 --> 00:07:58.399
These things I have spoken unto you.

00:07:59.519 --> 00:08:01.880
These things I have spoken unto you.

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.119
What is it that we're to embrace?

00:08:03.119 --> 00:08:04.839
We're to embrace the word of God.

00:08:04.839 --> 00:08:06.920
We're to embrace the scriptures.

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.720
We're to embrace that which God has given to us.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:12.640
And we find contextually as Jesus is here,

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:15.079
literally with his disciples,

00:08:15.079 --> 00:08:17.920
leading up to the time in which he would go

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:21.600
to the cruel cross and pay for the sin of mankind,

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:24.359
that he's literally speaking these words.

00:08:24.359 --> 00:08:28.119
It says, these things I have spoken unto you.

00:08:28.119 --> 00:08:30.500
They are to embrace these spoken words.

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:31.959
But I would say to you this morning

00:08:31.959 --> 00:08:34.679
that as we have the written word of God

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:37.880
that we understand that all scripture is given

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:42.000
by inspiration of God, that's God breathe.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.760
That's what the word means, inspiration.

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:47.840
And God has given to us his word.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:52.039
He has providentially preserved his word for us this morning

00:08:52.039 --> 00:08:55.919
so that we have the very word of God.

00:08:55.919 --> 00:08:58.760
What a blessing this morning to have the confidence

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:01.479
that God has given to us exactly

00:09:01.479 --> 00:09:03.200
what it is that we need to know.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.640
He has provided for us in this book

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:07.359
something that is to be embraced.

00:09:07.359 --> 00:09:10.460
It is precious, it is profitable.

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:14.359
We find this morning that as Jesus is speaking

00:09:14.359 --> 00:09:16.719
in these chapters to his disciples

00:09:16.719 --> 00:09:20.280
that he's very deliberate in what he says.

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:24.520
He's purposed in what he's going to communicate.

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:27.679
I want you to think about you having some measure

00:09:27.679 --> 00:09:29.840
of communication with someone

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.679
and you're providing them with instruction

00:09:31.679 --> 00:09:33.599
because of your departure,

00:09:33.599 --> 00:09:34.880
because of something you're doing.

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.719
And you say, I wanna give you some words of instruction.

00:09:37.719 --> 00:09:40.559
You would be deliberate, you would be pointed,

00:09:40.559 --> 00:09:42.719
you would be purposed, you would seek

00:09:42.719 --> 00:09:45.760
to communicate with clarity

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:47.400
the message that you need to deliver.

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:50.159
Well, that's exactly what Jesus did.

00:09:50.159 --> 00:09:52.960
And Jesus gave this message with great clarity.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.919
I want you to back up to chapter 14

00:09:54.919 --> 00:09:56.880
and I want you to notice, we're gonna look at

00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:00.080
several places here in which Jesus reiterates

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:04.460
this thought that he's spoken these things to his disciples.

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:07.960
In John chapter 14, we understand that at the end of chapter 13,

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:12.140
he speaks about this new commandment that they love one another.

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:15.260
He begins chapter 14 with that wonderful promise

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:19.560
that he's going to prepare a place for us and he's going to come again and what joy that is.

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:23.480
But if you look in chapter 14 and verse 25, notice what Jesus says.

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:27.020
He says, these things have I spoken unto you,

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:30.140
being yet present with you.

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:37.860
So Jesus, in between and repeatedly throughout this period of time with his disciples,

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:42.700
he's going to reiterate this truth that he's speaking these things to them,

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:45.000
that he's giving them this truth.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
And he says in chapter 14 and verse number 25,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
I'm speaking these things to you, being yet present with you.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.740
Jesus was not going to be present with them for much longer, physically speaking.

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:00.080
We understand that he says in the very next verse,

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:04.160
but the comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name,

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:08.260
he shall teach you all things and bring all things to remembrance,

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:12.960
whatsoever notice I have said unto you.

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:15.460
I'm thankful for the ministry of the Holy Spirit of God.

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:19.260
You know, if you saturate your mind with the word of God,

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:26.000
the Holy Spirit of God will regularly bring up, remind you of biblical truth.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.880
The reality is that if you don't saturate your mind with the scriptures,

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:35.180
that God is not going to just, bam, bring some scripture principle in your mind

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:38.180
that you never heard or never read or do not know.

00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:42.640
But no, as we saturate our minds, as we read regularly,

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:48.020
as we hear the truth of God's word, the Holy Spirit of God uses that.

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:51.260
It's amazing to me, those of you that have taught, that have preached,

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:52.620
you can understand this.

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:58.020
It's amazing to me how often, even in the midst of teaching and preaching,

00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:02.380
that the Holy Spirit of God will bring up a verse of scripture that's not in my notes,

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:05.380
it's not something that I prepared to say or to go to,

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:07.780
but the Holy Spirit brings it to mind.

00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:11.900
Why? Because I've saturated my mind with his word.

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:15.380
And can I tell you that in your life, that when you deal with a trial,

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:21.380
when you deal with a difficulty, when you're going through that daily routine of life,

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:24.180
as you've saturated your mind with the scripture,

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:27.820
the Holy Spirit of God will remind you.

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:29.740
He'll bring it to your remembrance.

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:34.620
In the text, he's speaking in chapter 14 and verse 15, he says this,

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:37.660
If ye love me, keep my commandments, and I will pray the Father,

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:42.500
and he shall give you another comforter, that he may abide with you forever.

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:45.340
And we find that he's talking about this comforter,

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:50.180
the Holy Spirit that he was going to give, what joy that this is.

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:53.020
And Jesus is speaking these things to them.

00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:58.140
Why? To encourage them, to prepare them, to help them to have the joy.

00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:01.540
He says, I will not, verse 18, leave you comfortless.

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:03.260
I will come to you.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.020
Isn't that a precious truth?

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:07.500
He says, I'm speaking these things to you.

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:09.860
Listen, these are things to embrace.

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:11.020
There's something to embrace.

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:14.260
Notice in chapter 15 and verse number 11, he says again,

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:19.380
These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you,

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:22.340
and that your joy might be full.

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:25.220
We understand that as God's people, as Christians,

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:29.620
we ought to be the most joyful people on the face of the earth.

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:33.660
The joy of the Lord is my strength.

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:35.780
Rejoice in the Lord always.

00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:38.620
And again, I say rejoice.

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:41.620
Joy unspeakable and full of glory.

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:44.180
In 1 Peter, he's speaking about having joy.

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:46.620
And in the midst of speaking about joy, he says,

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:50.180
if need be, you're in manifold temptations.

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:56.820
The trying of our faith, it bears forth, it brings forth that which is precious,

00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:58.740
the work that God is doing.

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:02.940
And even in the midst of those difficulties, we can have joy.

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:05.620
Why? Because it's his joy.

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:10.140
You know, there's so many people that are trying to manufacture joy today.

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:14.540
They use and they try to speak of joy in the terms of happiness,

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:16.340
and they try to manufacture it.

00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:19.620
There's a place in Florida that some of us have visited.

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:22.220
They say it's the happiest place on earth.

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:25.020
And the reality is that if you've ever been there,

00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:29.900
you find some of the most miserable people you'll ever find on the face of the earth.

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:31.420
It's 105 degrees.

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:34.220
You've been standing in a line for three hours to go on one ride.

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:35.140
Your kids are crying.

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:37.500
You've got to use the bathroom, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:41.220
And it's the happiest place on earth.

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:44.020
Isn't that what they say?

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:45.660
Listen, people are trying to manufacture joy.

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:49.220
If you get this, if you have this, it'll bring you happiness.

00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:49.980
It'll bring you joy.

00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:54.820
Can I tell you that joy is found in the person of Jesus Christ?

00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:57.380
And he says, I'm giving you these things.

00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:01.180
I'm speaking these things unto you that your joy, that my joy might remain in you,

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:03.300
and that your joy might be full.

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:06.380
Look at verse 17 here in John 15.

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:11.180
He says, these things I command you that you love one another.

00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:14.300
You know, I want you to think about what would happen in the days ahead

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:17.940
and all that would take place with the religious leaders of the day

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:22.540
and then with the persecution that would rise from the Jewish leaders

00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:25.860
there in the book of Acts and all that would transpire.

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:31.540
Listen, they would have to understand this love one for another

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:33.900
as they would be scattered, as they would face persecution.

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:39.060
Listen, I'm thankful for the bond that we have as brothers and sisters in Christ.

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:41.700
I'm thankful for the family of God.

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:45.820
I'm thankful that when we deal with opposition and adversity and difficulty

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:49.020
that we have brothers and sisters in Christ, that we love one another.

00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:51.180
He says, listen, I'm commanding you this.

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:51.860
Why?

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:53.780
Because I know what's going to happen.

00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:54.740
I know what's going to.

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:57.780
Listen, none of us can be on an island to ourselves.

00:15:57.780 --> 00:16:01.420
We cannot have this perspective of I'm just independent.

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:05.380
I don't need anybody.

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:07.340
We need each other.

00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:13.700
Why are there so many commands in God's word of one another in the New Testament?

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:15.820
It was one of my biggest issues.

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:17.700
I shouldn't say biggest because I had so many of them,

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:21.540
but one of my issues with 2020 and COVID and all the lockdowns

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:22.620
and all the things they try to do.

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:26.700
Listen, as God's people, we have the responsibility

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:28.780
of fulfilling the one another commands.

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:32.620
And how can we do that if we're not together?

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:35.660
A church is a called out assembly.

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:37.340
It's what it is.

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:40.940
We find here this morning that Jesus, knowing what would take place,

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:44.380
he says, I'm commanding you that you love one another.

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:46.460
You're going to need each other.

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:50.460
John 16 and verse number 1, these things have I spoken unto you

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:53.620
that you should not be offended.

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:57.900
Notice where he says in verse 2, they shall put you out of the synagogues.

00:16:57.900 --> 00:16:59.900
And then he says, if you are of the world,

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:02.900
the world will hate you, but because you're not of the world,

00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:04.900
I have chosen you out of the world.

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:06.900
Therefore, the world hateth you.

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:08.900
Listen, sometimes we walk around as Christians and say,

00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:09.900
why does the world hate me?

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:13.900
Listen, if the world hates you, it's a good thing.

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:17.900
If the world loves you, I'd be concerned.

00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:18.900
I'm being honest.

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:21.900
If the world loves you, I'd be concerned.

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:24.900
If the world hates you, I'd be concerned.

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:25.900
I'm being honest.

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:30.900
If the world loves you, I would be concerned.

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:33.900
We often talk about separation, come out from among them and be separate,

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:36.900
but can I tell you this morning that if we live godly lives,

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:38.900
they're going to separate from us.

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:40.900
We don't even really have to separate from them.

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:42.900
They're going to just separate from us.

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:43.900
Why?

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:47.900
Because men love darkness rather than light.

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.900
And so we find that Jesus says, listen, I'm speaking these,

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:52.900
there are some things that are going to happen,

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:54.900
and I'm speaking these things unto you.

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:57.900
I'm trying to give you the instruction that you need.

00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:59.900
Look in verse number four of John 16,

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:03.900
but these things have I told you that when the time shall come,

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:05.900
you may remember that I told you of them.

00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:09.900
And these things I said not unto you at the beginning because I was with you.

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:12.900
And so we find that Jesus says, I'm telling you these things

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:15.900
because I know what's going to happen.

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:18.900
And I'm preparing you.

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:22.900
I'm providing for you that which you need.

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:27.900
And when the time comes, you're going to remember that I told you of them.

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:30.900
What a joy to know that our God loves us so much

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:33.900
that he's given us the truth that we need.

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:35.900
There's something to embrace.

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:38.900
We find in verse seven of John 16, Jesus says,

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:40.900
nevertheless, I tell you the truth.

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:42.900
I tell you, he's speaking to them.

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:46.900
It is expedient for you that I go away.

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:49.900
See, they really didn't want him to go away.

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:51.900
And I understand why.

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:53.900
But Jesus says it's necessary.

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:55.900
It's appropriate.

00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:57.900
It's expedient for you that I go away.

00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:59.900
It's absolutely necessary for if I go not away,

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:01.900
the comforter will not come unto you.

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:05.900
But if I depart, I will send him unto you.

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:09.900
And Jesus concludes once again in chapter 16 and verse number 33,

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:13.900
these things I have spoken unto you.

00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:18.900
Listen, Jesus was deliberate with what he said to his disciples.

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:21.900
It is imperative this morning that these disciples

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:25.900
would have understood the importance of the message that was being given.

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:27.900
But I would say for each of us this morning,

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:31.900
it's imperative that we understand that God's Word is profitable.

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:34.900
That God has given us exactly what we need,

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:37.900
and there is something to embrace.

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:40.900
That we embrace the truth of God's Word.

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:42.900
That we hold it dear.

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:48.900
That we seek the face of God through his precious Word.

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:53.900
Not only do I find in John 16 and verse 33 that there's something to embrace,

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:57.900
but number two, there's something to expect.

00:19:57.900 --> 00:19:59.900
The Bible says this in John 16 and verse 33.

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:02.740
these things I have spoken unto you."

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:05.940
Notice, number one, when we think about this expectation

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:09.880
that in me, you might have peace.

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:13.140
I'm so thankful that he is the prince of peace.

00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:15.380
I'm so thankful that he is a peace,

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:16.580
according to what Paul said,

00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:19.060
that passeth all understanding.

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:23.260
I'm thankful that even in the text of this dialogue

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:25.340
that Jesus has with his disciples,

00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:28.660
and of course we have the division of chapters and verses,

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:31.780
but really he's just giving in this intimate setting

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:35.260
all of this instruction that we have divided into chapters.

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:37.820
He's providing this instruction to his disciples.

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:41.860
And notice back in John 14 and verse 27,

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:45.580
notice what Jesus says with regard to peace.

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:48.160
He says, listen, there's something to embrace.

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:51.420
I've spoken these things I have spoken unto you,

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:53.100
but there's something to expect.

00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:57.760
He says, listen, in me, you might have peace.

00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:00.280
Notice in John 14 and verse number 27,

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:03.680
Jesus says this, peace I leave with you.

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:06.320
Do you notice the next word?

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:11.060
My peace I give unto you.

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:15.120
Not as the world giveth, give I unto you.

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:17.380
Let not your heart be troubled,

00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:20.380
neither let it be afraid.

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:22.860
We understand as we study the scriptures,

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:26.000
the importance of this truth of peace.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.160
And we find that God has promised to give us this peace.

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:32.120
And he says that it's his peace.

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:34.260
He said, my peace give I unto thee,

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:35.720
not as the world giveth.

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:39.440
Listen, I'm thankful that Jesus gives us a peace

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:41.240
that passeth all understanding,

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:44.700
that he will keep us in perfect peace.

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:46.520
The Bible says to who?

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:51.360
To those who have their minds stayed upon him.

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:53.340
And you think about this truth this morning

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:55.880
as we look at the scriptures and we understand,

00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:59.500
listen, we live in a world today that's seeking for peace.

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:00.960
They're longing for peace,

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:03.760
but they're looking for it in all the wrong places

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:06.800
for Jesus is the prince of peace.

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:08.740
And he offers peace.

00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:12.680
He says, my peace give I unto thee.

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:16.180
Listen, I'm so thankful this morning

00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:20.880
that God's peace can rule in our hearts.

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:23.520
That's what Paul says to the believers in Colossae.

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:28.400
Let the peace of God rule in your hearts.

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:32.160
There's all kinds of things that are going to try

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:35.200
to take place of that peace of God.

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:38.280
The turmoil, the trouble, the tribulation, the difficulties,

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:41.240
but he says that we're to let the peace of God

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:42.600
rule in our hearts.

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:44.680
That we understand that Jesus,

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:46.640
as he's instructing these disciples

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:49.080
and he tells them these important truths,

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:51.920
he says, listen, not only is there something to embrace,

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:53.640
not only am I speaking these things to you,

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:55.240
but there's something to expect.

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:59.480
And number one, you have to understand that in me,

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:01.360
you might have peace.

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:03.640
In me, in the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:06.440
But notice what he says in John 16.

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:08.320
He says, in me, you might have peace,

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:09.800
but he follows it up and says this,

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:14.800
in the world, you shall have tribulation.

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:21.480
We know a little bit about that, don't we?

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.440
He says, in me, what a great contrast.

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:28.320
In me, you might have peace.

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:33.320
In the world, you shall have tribulation.

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:40.280
We have a world full of tribulation, trouble, trial.

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:42.640
The disciples were going to face tribulation.

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:45.000
The disciples were gonna face persecution.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.640
They were gonna deal with difficulties and adversity.

00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:51.380
And Jesus lets them know that even though

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:53.300
in the world they're gonna have tribulation,

00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:57.060
that in him, they can have peace.

00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:59.940
This is a great truth that is given to us in John 16

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:03.060
in verse number 33, that yes, we understand

00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:05.700
that in that world, there's going to be tribulation

00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:07.580
and we see it, we experience it,

00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:12.100
we understand this morning the way that the world operates.

00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:14.580
But I understand this morning that though

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:17.860
all of the enemy is raging and all the wickedness

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:19.980
that is taking place and all the tribulation

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:24.260
that is around me, that we can still have peace.

00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:25.340
Why?

00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:29.620
Because Jesus said, in me, you might have peace.

00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:33.420
He said in Hebrews 13, I will never leave thee

00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:34.900
nor forsake thee.

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:36.580
We find that in Acts chapter 12,

00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:38.460
it's an interesting passage of scripture

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:42.020
in which God provides for us an account

00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:45.180
of what's taking place with the persecution

00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:48.380
and Herod and all that he's doing

00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:50.660
and killing James and intending to kill Peter

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:53.740
and putting him in prison and the church is praying

00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:55.460
and all that is taking place.

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:59.900
And Peter, listen, Peter saw what happened to James.

00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:01.500
He was aware of what happened to James.

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:05.140
Peter understood the plan of Herod, if you will.

00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:09.340
The church understood the seriousness of the situation.

00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:11.620
They had an all-night church prayer meeting.

00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:15.620
You know what Peter's doing while they're praying?

00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:16.500
He's sleeping.

00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:21.340
If that's not a great picture of peace,

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:23.860
I don't know what else would be.

00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:29.100
Then in the midst of all that was taking place,

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:32.580
in the midst of the understanding that I'm next,

00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:35.740
I mean, he has me in prison and he's intending to kill me.

00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:37.060
He already killed James.

00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:38.700
He's gonna do it.

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:42.180
The church is praying fervently.

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:44.540
Peter's asleep.

00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:47.900
He's asleep.

00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:49.700
He has peace.

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:52.980
In the world, you shall have tribulation.

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:56.340
But in me, you might have peace.

00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:03.140
How is it that we view the circumstances of life?

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:05.620
Have you ever heard somebody say this

00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:06.740
when you ask them how they're doing?

00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:08.540
Well, under the circumstances.

00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:11.540
Whoever told us that we're to live under the circumstances?

00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:13.420
Amen?

00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:15.420
We're not to live under the circumstances.

00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:18.780
But so often what happens is we get our focus

00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:20.900
so much on our circumstances

00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:24.060
and we're not focused upon our God.

00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:26.780
And it's in him that we have peace.

00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:28.740
It's in the world that there's tribulation.

00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:31.340
And we fill up our minds with all that's going on

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:33.700
in the world and all the trial and all the tribulation.

00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:36.460
And we have no rest.

00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:38.020
We have no peace.

00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:39.980
I think about Peter.

00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:41.420
We mentioned in Acts chapter 12.

00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:44.660
But you think about Peter when he walked on the water.

00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:47.940
Jesus comes walking on the water.

00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:50.100
And I mean, what a scene it must have been

00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:53.660
in the midst of a storm and all this taking place

00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:56.540
and they see him and it's Jesus.

00:26:56.540 --> 00:27:00.180
He's walking on the water and Peter's the only one.

00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:01.580
He gets criticized.

00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:03.780
But I'm telling you what, he's the only one

00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:05.980
that said, if it be thee, bid thee come to thee.

00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:07.820
Bid me come to thee.

00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:10.420
He's the only one that took a step out of the boat.

00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:13.460
So we can criticize him for sinking in the water,

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:15.420
but he's the only one that got out of the boat.

00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:16.580
Amen?

00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:18.820
And that means that most of us, if we were there,

00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:20.660
we would have stayed in the boat too.

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:23.100
All right?

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:27.100
And Peter said, if it be thee, bid me come to thee.

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:29.580
And Jesus says, come, and he steps out of the water.

00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:30.820
What's he doing when he's walking?

00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:32.980
I don't know how many steps he took.

00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:33.980
And neither do you.

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:36.700
But he had to take a certain number of steps.

00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:38.380
He gets to wherever he gets to.

00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:39.740
And what is he focused on?

00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:41.580
Well, he's focused on Jesus.

00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:45.700
Did he know that the storm was raging?

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:49.780
Did he know that there was a storm before he saw Jesus?

00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:50.620
Sure he did.

00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:52.340
They were in the midst of the storm.

00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:55.140
He knew that the storm was raging,

00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:57.740
but his focus was on Jesus.

00:27:57.740 --> 00:27:59.420
But when he took his eyes off Jesus,

00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:01.140
what happened?

00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:01.980
Began to sink.

00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:04.340
Now, he had enough sense to say, Lord, save me.

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:07.900
The Bible says that they got back.

00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:12.300
I believe they walked back on water to the boat.

00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:16.260
When Peter took his eyes off Jesus,

00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:18.420
listen, the storm didn't cease

00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:19.900
until they got back on the boat.

00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:22.740
And we find that as you look at the passage of Scripture,

00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:27.740
that Peter, as his focus, his gaze is upon Jesus,

00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:30.740
and he's not focused on his circumstances,

00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:32.900
he's walking on the water.

00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:35.900
But when his gaze gets fixed on the circumstances,

00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:38.619
the waves being boisterous and all that's taking place,

00:28:38.619 --> 00:28:40.900
he begins to sink.

00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:41.740
Listen, this morning,

00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:44.100
sometimes we have our focus in the wrong place.

00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:47.780
We're gazing at our problems

00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:50.900
and just simply glancing at our Savior,

00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:55.180
when in reality, we must be gazing at our Savior

00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:58.320
and simply glancing at our circumstances.

00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:01.500
The Bible says in Hebrews chapter 12,

00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:06.500
looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith.

00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:10.140
We keep our eyes on Jesus.

00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:13.220
We find that there's something to expect.

00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:15.619
Jesus says, I've spoken these things,

00:29:15.619 --> 00:29:17.300
these things I have spoken unto you

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:21.059
that in me, you might have peace.

00:29:21.059 --> 00:29:24.220
In the world, you shall have tribulation.

00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:26.380
So we know that this is to be expected.

00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:29.500
In fact, we'll be studying it here in just a few weeks

00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:33.660
as we continue studying through the book of 2 Timothy.

00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:37.500
We find that in chapter number three,

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:39.100
Paul is giving Timothy truth

00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:43.860
with regard to the end times, the last days.

00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:46.860
And he says in verse number 10 of 2 Timothy three,

00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:49.619
but thou has fully known my doctrine,

00:29:49.619 --> 00:29:51.580
matter of life, purpose, faith,

00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:54.059
long-suffering, charity, patience,

00:29:54.059 --> 00:29:55.700
persecutions, afflictions,

00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:58.980
which come unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra.

00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:04.180
I endured, but then he says this, but out of them all the Lord delivered me, yea, and

00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:09.380
all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution."

00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:11.220
There's going to be tribulation.

00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:17.540
In fact, as you look in 2 Timothy chapter number 2, as we'll be dealing with it next

00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:24.700
week, verse number 3, thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:31.540
There's going to be hardships, but the soldier endures because he's got his eyes on Jesus

00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:36.140
and he's understanding that in him we can have peace.

00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:40.940
You have no peace, you're lacking peace, you're troubled.

00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:43.860
Jesus says let not your heart be troubled.

00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:45.740
Jesus says in me you can have peace.

00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:47.820
Pastor, did you see what happened?

00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:48.820
Did you see the news?

00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:49.820
Did you see this?

00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:50.820
Did you see that?

00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:53.100
What's going on with this and what's going to happen there?

00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:57.180
In me, Jesus said.

00:30:57.180 --> 00:31:01.820
In me, Jesus said, you might have peace.

00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:05.260
In the world, there's going to be tribulation.

00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:06.260
Do we not see it?

00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:09.660
It's all around us.

00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:16.860
I just mentioned this to somebody last week, two weeks ago, and it was not any real scientific

00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:23.980
calculation that I used to come up with it, but during the days of COVID, so many were

00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:31.540
glued to their TV and watching all of the news because of, well, you couldn't go anywhere.

00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:37.180
And I would say regularly to people that if you, you should have a ratio of four to one.

00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:42.740
If you watch the news for an hour, you better read the Bible for four.

00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:45.860
There was nothing scientific about it, I just kind of pulled it out of my hat and just kind

00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:46.860
of four to one.

00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:48.900
I thought it sounded good.

00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:53.180
But I would tell you that that stands true, not just during a COVID year, but during any

00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:59.860
time because we need to have these things that God has given to us.

00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:05.900
We need to embrace them because in Him, we have peace.

00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:07.340
We know these things.

00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:13.300
Listen, Jesus has revealed to us just as He did to His disciples here in this portion

00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:18.300
of Scripture, in these pages of Scripture, He revealed to them the things that were

00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:24.340
going to happen, and He's preparing them, and He's given to us truth that as we embrace

00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:27.900
it, that we can expect, look, there's going to be tribulation, but He said in Him there's

00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:28.900
peace.

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:32.940
And what joy that is to every child of God.

00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:42.140
I find in John 16 and verse 33, there's something to embrace, there's something to expect, but

00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:46.980
I find there's someone to exalt.

00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:50.940
In John 16 and verse 33, there's someone to exalt.

00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:56.060
He says, in the world you shall have tribulation, but be of good cheer.

00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:57.060
Why?

00:32:57.060 --> 00:33:00.940
I have overcome the world.

00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:02.940
Isn't that exciting?

00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:04.700
Listen, there's someone to exalt.

00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:07.340
We serve the King of kings and Lord of lords.

00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:12.780
We understand this morning that because of who He is, because of the fact that He says

00:33:12.780 --> 00:33:18.900
I have overcome the world, because of His victory, that we can be of good cheer, that

00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:23.860
we do not need to walk through this life, we don't have to say, woe is me, and dragging

00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:28.420
our lip on the ground and saying I'm so overwhelmed and I have all these problems and all these

00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:29.420
difficulties.

00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:32.620
No, Jesus said you're going to have persecution.

00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:34.780
You're going to deal with tribulation.

00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:37.340
But in Him there's peace and be of good cheer.

00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:38.340
Why?

00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:40.380
I have overcome the world.

00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:44.300
We are on the winning side.

00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:46.780
You say it doesn't seem like it, it doesn't look like it.

00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:53.100
Get your eyes off of that stuff and get your eyes on Jesus because there's someone to exalt.

00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:55.360
There's someone that is victorious.

00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:56.360
He's our Savior.

00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:57.420
He's my God.

00:33:57.420 --> 00:33:58.420
He's my shield.

00:33:58.420 --> 00:33:59.620
He's my buckler.

00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:00.880
He's my strong tower.

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:03.020
He's my everything.

00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:07.820
This morning as we get our focus on God, as we get our focus on our Lord and understand

00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:14.220
that He's overcome the world, that we too are overcomers.

00:34:14.220 --> 00:34:18.420
That He's victorious and we too are victorious.

00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:20.740
What a joy.

00:34:20.740 --> 00:34:26.380
Too many Christians today are living under the circumstances.

00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:33.240
Too many Christians today are not embracing the Word that God has given to us.

00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:37.780
Too many Christians today are acting like they didn't know that we should expect these

00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:44.840
things even though God's told us these things.

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:51.100
Too many Christians are failing to exalt the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:34:51.100 --> 00:35:00.260
As we live, we act, we talk as if our Savior's been defeated.

00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:03.140
How sad that is.

00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:05.620
Victory is ours.

00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:07.540
Victory is sure.

00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:09.260
We're not defeated.

00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:11.900
We have an enemy but He is a defeated foe.

00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:14.740
Greater is He that is in you than He that is in the world.

00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:19.180
Is that not what the Bible says in 1 John 4?

00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:25.100
We find that He tells us that we are more than conquerors in Christ.

00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:27.740
We find it in 1 Corinthians in chapter 15.

00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:31.380
He tells us, but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory.

00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:32.380
How?

00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:35.180
Through our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:39.680
Listen this morning, we need to exalt the Lord Jesus Christ and see Him in His rightful

00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:43.620
place and understand that He has overcome the world.

00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:46.820
Listen Satan tried to do everything he could.

00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:49.860
He understood the spiritual war and the spiritual battle.

00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:54.420
He did everything that he could to prevent the Lord Jesus Christ from going to the cross

00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:58.660
of Calvary in the first place and then after He goes to the cross He does everything that

00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:03.780
He can to prevent the resurrection but there's nothing He can do.

00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:11.280
He's defeated because God is greater and we have to see Him in that rightful place.

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:14.780
Great is the Lord and greatly to be praised.

00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:17.700
We need to see Him high, holy and lifted up.

00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:19.260
We need to see Him exalted.

00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:24.360
We find in John 17 that as Jesus says the hour has come glorify thy son that thy son

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:25.980
also may glorify thee.

00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:30.680
We find that in verse number 2 the Bible says as thou hast given Him power over all flesh

00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:35.760
that He should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given Him and this is life eternal

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:40.220
that they might know thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.

00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:42.580
I have glorified thee on the earth.

00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:48.120
I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.

00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:53.780
You know at that point Jesus had not yet gone to the cross but He was able to say that He

00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:59.460
had finished the work because it was so absolutely certain that He would go to the cross.

00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:04.380
He would bury and He would rise again that He would speak in absolute terms of an event

00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:10.340
that had not yet taken place because we can't talk that way because I don't know what's

00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:15.580
going to happen tomorrow but He can and He did.

00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:18.820
And as He hung upon that cross He said it is finished.

00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:23.700
He was buried in that borrowed tomb in the grave.

00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:30.400
We sing the song often times on resurrection Sunday the grave that could not hold Him.

00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:34.380
He tore the bars away up from the grave He arose.

00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:36.680
He conquered sin, death and the grave.

00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:38.300
He lives forevermore.

00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:39.820
Hallelujah.

00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:41.700
What a Savior.

00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:46.300
Notice with me if you will Revelation chapter 5 when we consider that there's someone to

00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:53.160
exalt understand this morning that we are to exalt and magnify the Lord Jesus Christ

00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:55.820
every day of our lives.

00:37:55.820 --> 00:38:00.220
We're to keep our eyes upon Him fixated upon Him exalting Him seeing Him in His rightful

00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:01.620
place lifting Him up.

00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:06.180
We come to Revelation chapter number 5 and I'm going to take the time to read the portion

00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:11.780
of Scripture because it's so encouraging and so helpful for me as a believer, as a

00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:17.560
Christian to enter into the throne room of heaven as God gives us this glimpse in Revelation

00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:25.020
chapter 5 and what truth is here for us and how helpful it is as we see our exalted Savior

00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:26.020
this morning.

00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:28.460
He says I have overcome the world.

00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:35.380
Notice in Revelation chapter 5 in verse number 1 the Bible says and I saw in the right hand

00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:40.100
of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven

00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:50.220
seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the

00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:57.820
book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the

00:38:57.820 --> 00:39:02.100
earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and what is John doing verse

00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:07.940
4 and I wept much why because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book

00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:17.180
neither to look therein and one of the elders said unto me weep not behold the lion of the

00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:26.080
tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals

00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:30.900
thereof and I beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the

00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:39.040
midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes

00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:43.840
which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth and he came and took the

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:49.180
book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the

00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:54.560
book the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one

00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:58.980
of them harps and golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of saints.

00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:02.820
In verse 9, it says, they sung a new song, saying,

00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:09.060
Thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof, why?

00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:15.100
For Thou wast slain and hast redeemed us to God by Thy blood out of every kindred and

00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:21.140
tongue and people and nation, and hast made us unto our God kings and priests, and we

00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:25.020
shall reign on the earth.

00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:30.100
And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne, and the beasts

00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:35.220
and the elders, and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands

00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:43.380
of thousands, saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power

00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:52.820
and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing, and every creature

00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:59.420
which is in heaven, and on the earth and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and

00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:06.420
all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him

00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:12.140
that sitteth upon the throne and upon the Lamb forever and ever.

00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:16.660
The four beasts said, Amen, and the four and twenty elders fell down and worshipped him

00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:20.540
that liveth forever and ever.

00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:22.260
That's our God.

00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:24.180
He rules and he reigns.

00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:28.180
The heathen rage.

00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:32.340
God shall laugh, has them in derision.

00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:34.820
They hold their fist at God.

00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:39.220
They think they're victorious.

00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:46.420
But Jesus says, Be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.

00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:52.860
When we take in context the entirety of what Jesus says in these few chapters of the Gospel

00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:57.820
of John, we find that Jesus, there's something to embrace, why?

00:41:57.820 --> 00:42:02.220
Because Jesus says, I want to prepare you, I'm being deliberate in what I'm speaking

00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:06.060
to you, I want you to understand that the persecutions are going to come, I want you

00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:09.700
to understand that the world's going to hate you, I want you to understand that they're

00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:15.060
going to think, they're going to put you out of the synagogues and the time's going to

00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:19.180
come when they, the one that thinks that they're killing you is doing God's service

00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:24.300
and all of these things, and I'm telling you, I want you to have peace and I want you to

00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:28.260
have joy and I want you to be able to remember these things.

00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:30.940
There's something to embrace.

00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:38.820
Listen, this morning, we need to be in the Bible, we need to be in the Bible.

00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:43.580
There's a lot going on in our world.

00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:46.220
A lot going on in our world.

00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:51.180
But I submit to you this morning that our God's still on His throne.

00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:57.340
He's never going to be overthrown, He's never going to be defeated, He's never going to,

00:42:57.340 --> 00:43:00.100
He's on His throne and He forever will be.

00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:04.820
The Bible says, the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.

00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:07.700
He rules and He reigns.

00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:10.580
Everything's happening in His time.

00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:18.340
Everything's falling into place, just as He said it would, because He knows all things.

00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:23.820
And He has revealed to us in His Word these truths and He's providentially preserved for

00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:27.940
us the Bible so that we could know them and we must embrace them.

00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:34.940
How often we have people today, I mean people that profess to be believers, followers of

00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:41.500
Christ that do not have a biblical worldview.

00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:48.780
Their worldview is shaped by whatever news group that they listen to, that they watch,

00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:51.740
that they read.

00:43:51.740 --> 00:43:57.980
I shared with you weeks ago the statistics of worldview, biblical worldview.

00:43:57.980 --> 00:44:03.020
Listen, that's a serious situation in our society today.

00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:05.820
Of those that profess Christ, they don't have a biblical worldview, why?

00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:10.180
Because they're not embracing the Word.

00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:17.700
But Jesus says, these things I have spoken unto you.

00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:20.860
This morning, we need to embrace His Word.

00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:24.660
We need to expect that there's going to be tribulation.

00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:29.460
In the world, you shall have tribulation, but we need to understand that in Him, we

00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:31.420
can have peace.

00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:34.500
And He says, be of good cheer.

00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:36.420
Isn't that amazing?

00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:42.620
In the midst of all that's taking place, I mean some of the message that Jesus is giving

00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:47.700
to His disciples with regard to the hatred that they would face and the persecution that

00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:53.420
they would face and the tribulation that they would endure, He says, be of good cheer.

00:44:53.420 --> 00:44:55.140
Be of good cheer.

00:44:55.140 --> 00:44:56.380
Why?

00:44:56.380 --> 00:45:01.100
Because I have overcome the world.

00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:04.020
I have overcome the world.

00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:06.940
There's someone to exalt.

00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:14.220
This morning, this week, in our lives, we need to be diligent and purposed in exalting

00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:20.380
the Lord Jesus Christ, lifting Him up, seeing Him in His rightful place, high, holy and

00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:22.100
lifted up.

00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:24.220
Because we serve a great God.

00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:28.460
We serve the victorious Savior.

00:45:28.460 --> 00:45:34.700
And thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory.

00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:38.700
John would say this in 1 John chapter number 5.

00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:41.980
We sing the song, faith is the victory.

00:45:41.980 --> 00:45:42.980
You familiar with the song?

00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:51.740
Well, 1 John 5 and verse 4 says, for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world, and this

00:45:51.740 --> 00:45:56.860
is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.

00:45:56.860 --> 00:45:59.540
Who is He that overcometh the world?

00:45:59.540 --> 00:46:04.180
But He that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God.

00:46:04.180 --> 00:46:05.180
Faith is the victory.

00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:08.020
We sing the song, victory in Jesus.

00:46:08.020 --> 00:46:10.380
Isn't it wonderful?

00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:13.860
But sometimes we live like we've been conquered.

00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:16.740
No, Jesus says, be of good cheer.

00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:19.700
I have overcome the world.

00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:20.700
Let's pray together.

00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:21.840
Lord, we love You.

00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:23.020
We thank You for loving us.

00:46:23.020 --> 00:46:29.580
We thank You for Your Word, the truth contained therein.

00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:39.380
The message that was delivered to the disciples in this intimate setting was so valuable.

00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:43.620
You've chosen to give us a recorded, written Word.

00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:48.540
It's inspired and preserved.

00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:54.500
I pray that You'd help us as Your people to embrace Your Word.

00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:58.860
Help us to go through life with our eyes wide open, knowing that You've revealed to us the

00:46:58.860 --> 00:47:01.900
things that we should expect.

00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:09.460
Help us to abide in You that we might have Your peace, a peace that passeth understanding,

00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:12.740
that Your peace would truly rule in our hearts.

00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:20.620
And God, I thank You that You overcome the world, that You're victorious.

00:47:20.620 --> 00:47:28.980
I pray that You would help us to exalt You in our lives daily, in our church corporately,

00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:34.020
that we'd see You in Your rightful place, high, holy, and lifted up.

00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:39.940
God, we'd be found faithful until that day that we meet You face to face.

00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:46.340
In the midst of all that's taking place, would You help us to be of good cheer?

00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:50.940
Would You help us to keep our eyes on Thee?

00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:56.620
Lord, in this moment of invitation, maybe there's someone that's not sure of heaven.

00:47:56.620 --> 00:47:59.140
They need to be saved this morning.

00:47:59.140 --> 00:48:03.940
I pray that the Holy Spirit of God would convict them of their sin, of Christ's righteousness

00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:05.860
and of judgment to come.

00:48:05.860 --> 00:48:11.500
Father, maybe there's someone here this morning, maybe several, Lord, that are Your children

00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:16.300
that are troubled, that don't have that peace that we spoke of this morning.

00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:19.700
They're not of good cheer.

00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:21.460
They're troubled by all that's going on.

00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:26.820
God, would You help them this morning to refocus?

00:48:26.820 --> 00:48:35.180
Would You help them, Lord, to fix their gaze upon Thee, to embrace the truth of Your Word,

00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:42.260
to know that You have revealed to us those things that would transpire in the days ahead?

00:48:42.260 --> 00:48:44.860
I pray that You'd move and work as only You can.

00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:47.820
We'll give You the honor and glory for all that You'll do.

00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:49.180
For it's in Christ's name we pray.
