1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,920
Number two, as we continue our study here

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,719
on Sunday mornings through 1st and 2nd Timothy,

3
00:00:05,719 --> 00:00:07,539
and we've spent a few weeks here

4
00:00:07,539 --> 00:00:09,119
in 2nd Timothy chapter number two

5
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:12,399
dealing with the subject matter of a good soldier.

6
00:00:12,399 --> 00:00:13,479
And several weeks ago,

7
00:00:13,479 --> 00:00:16,100
when we first entered into the second chapter,

8
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,559
I mentioned that the entirety of 2nd Timothy chapter two

9
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:21,340
really deals with the subject matter,

10
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:25,120
the thought of what it means to be a good soldier.

11
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,479
I've said this repeatedly,

12
00:00:26,479 --> 00:00:29,079
this is the fourth lesson from 2nd Timothy chapter two,

13
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:32,200
the fourth message, and I've said this repeatedly,

14
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,880
I do not want to, I hope that you do not want to

15
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,639
simply be content with being a soldier.

16
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:41,799
I wanna be a good soldier.

17
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:44,000
The Bible says here in our text of Scripture

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,119
in verse number three of 2nd Timothy two,

19
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:48,779
thou therefore endure hardness

20
00:00:48,779 --> 00:00:51,520
as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.

21
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,880
No man that woreth and tangleth himself

22
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,040
with the affairs of this life,

23
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:01,080
that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.

24
00:01:01,319 --> 00:01:03,919
If a man also strive for masteries,

25
00:01:03,919 --> 00:01:07,580
yet is he not crowned except he strive lawfully.

26
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:08,720
Over the last three weeks,

27
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,800
we've looked at verses three and four,

28
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,500
and we've dealt with the subject matter

29
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,800
of these characteristics, these attributes, if you will,

30
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,959
of what it is to be a good soldier.

31
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:20,800
What makes a soldier a good soldier?

32
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,639
We could ask the question this morning,

33
00:01:22,639 --> 00:01:26,160
what is the purpose of examining these characteristics?

34
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,480
Why is it that God has provided to us

35
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,760
in 2nd Timothy two, these five characteristics

36
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,339
or attributes of a good soldier?

37
00:01:35,339 --> 00:01:36,239
Why do we study it?

38
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:37,800
Why are we spending so much time on it?

39
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,839
Well, I believe that as we study

40
00:01:39,839 --> 00:01:42,699
these particular characteristics and attributes

41
00:01:42,699 --> 00:01:45,319
of a good soldier, that it should lead us

42
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:49,120
to an honest examination of our own lives.

43
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,080
In other words, we should examine our lives

44
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,959
with honesty and humility, and we must determine,

45
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:57,959
are these attributes present in my life?

46
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:00,300
In other words, if God were to look at your life,

47
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,599
if he were to look at my life,

48
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:04,559
would he say they're a soldier,

49
00:02:04,559 --> 00:02:07,279
or would he say they're a good soldier?

50
00:02:07,279 --> 00:02:08,880
We said this from verse number three,

51
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,559
that a good soldier endures hardness.

52
00:02:11,559 --> 00:02:12,880
There's going to be opposition.

53
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,479
There's going to be difficulty.

54
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:16,520
You attempt to do anything for God,

55
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,039
and you can find that, yes, there might be an open door,

56
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:22,240
as Paul said, but there are many adversaries.

57
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,759
We find it in the Old Testament.

58
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:24,759
We find it in the New Testament.

59
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:27,960
We find through the pages of church history

60
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,860
that any individual that ever attempted to do anything

61
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:34,240
for the cause of Christ has faced opposition.

62
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,160
But Jesus said this, if they hate you,

63
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,320
remember they hated me first, amen?

64
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,960
And the reality is that we serve a God

65
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:45,960
who is worthy of our service, and not just when it's easy.

66
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,320
He endures hardness.

67
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,960
I said this a couple of weeks ago.

68
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:54,500
Some want to be a soldier, but they don't want the combat.

69
00:02:55,839 --> 00:03:00,339
The reality is that a soldier is trained for the combat,

70
00:03:01,559 --> 00:03:03,360
and we're to endure hardness.

71
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,000
Listen, if you don't think we're living in the last days,

72
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,160
your head is in the sand.

73
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,259
I'm being honest with you.

74
00:03:09,259 --> 00:03:10,679
We're going to get to it in a couple of weeks

75
00:03:10,679 --> 00:03:12,240
in 2 Timothy chapter three,

76
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,839
and we're going to see all of the truth

77
00:03:14,839 --> 00:03:17,479
that God gives us the characteristics of the last days.

78
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:19,800
I'm telling you, we're living in the last of the last days.

79
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,160
Jesus is coming soon,

80
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,000
and we need to endure hardness as a good soldier.

81
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,720
We find that the second attribute that we discussed

82
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,800
in verse number four

83
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,199
was that a good soldier avoids distractions.

84
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:33,660
You understand that there are many distractions in life.

85
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:36,399
There are things that the enemy will bring in your life

86
00:03:36,399 --> 00:03:39,000
and in my life and in our lives corporately as a church

87
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
to distract us from doing what God has instructed us to do.

88
00:03:44,399 --> 00:03:46,440
It's so easy to become distracted.

89
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,600
I've used illustrations on distraction,

90
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,800
and we've understood.

91
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,220
Listen, if we just let somebody open that back door

92
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,479
and walk in this morning,

93
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:56,320
half of you will be distracted

94
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,080
as soon as they walk through the door.

95
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,279
Let somebody near you open a piece of candy,

96
00:04:00,279 --> 00:04:01,520
and you're going to be distracted.

97
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,000
I used that illustration,

98
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,240
and someone came to me and said,

99
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,759
you know, we were at a funeral,

100
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:07,080
and as we're at the funeral,

101
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,080
my wife tried to open a piece of candy,

102
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,339
and they tried to, and my wife reminded me.

103
00:04:12,339 --> 00:04:14,160
Don't you remember what pastor said?

104
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,059
And the reality is that, listen,

105
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:21,019
we're so easily distracted, so easily distracted.

106
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:24,339
I said this, no longer can God's people

107
00:04:24,339 --> 00:04:25,859
be asleep at the wheel.

108
00:04:25,859 --> 00:04:28,299
No longer can fathers and husbands,

109
00:04:28,299 --> 00:04:31,739
can mothers and wives, can God's people

110
00:04:31,739 --> 00:04:35,160
be distracted by the things of this world.

111
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,940
We said this from verse number four,

112
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,660
the third attribute that we see of a good soldier

113
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,600
is that a good soldier seeks to please his master.

114
00:04:43,459 --> 00:04:45,799
I concluded that message by encouraging

115
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,119
each and every one of us to seek,

116
00:04:48,119 --> 00:04:51,480
to truly examine our lives, to understand,

117
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,760
am I doing that which is pleasing in the sight of my God?

118
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,440
The Bible says in Ephesians five

119
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,880
that we're to prove what is acceptable unto the Lord,

120
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,799
not what is acceptable to society,

121
00:05:02,799 --> 00:05:05,220
not what is acceptable to your spouse or to someone else,

122
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,480
but what is acceptable unto the Lord.

123
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,320
You know why?

124
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,119
You're not going to stand before society.

125
00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:11,959
You're not going to stand before your employer.

126
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:13,440
You're not going to stand before your spouse.

127
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,119
You're not going to stand before your pastor.

128
00:05:15,119 --> 00:05:17,500
You're going to stand before your savior.

129
00:05:18,799 --> 00:05:22,359
And we must prove what is acceptable unto the Lord.

130
00:05:22,359 --> 00:05:25,200
This morning as we move into verse number five,

131
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,500
we find that the Bible says, I've read it a moment ago,

132
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,339
but I'll read it again,

133
00:05:28,339 --> 00:05:30,700
if a man also strive for masteries,

134
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:34,200
is he not crowned except he strive lawfully?

135
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,920
If I could boil this down to an attribute

136
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,920
or a characteristic that I've identified

137
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,660
as a good soldier from this text of scripture,

138
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:46,140
I would say it this way, a good soldier is disciplined.

139
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,940
A good soldier is disciplined.

140
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,500
I think about a soldier,

141
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,660
I think about someone in the armed forces,

142
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:54,820
and I know that not every branch of our US military

143
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:59,420
refers to their members of that branch as being soldiers,

144
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:03,299
but if we use the word very generically this morning,

145
00:06:03,299 --> 00:06:07,359
I think that soldiers typically have in our minds,

146
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:09,980
we think about a soldier being disciplined.

147
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:12,579
If we're gonna be a good soldier of the Lord Jesus Christ,

148
00:06:12,579 --> 00:06:14,619
we need to have some discipline in our lives,

149
00:06:14,619 --> 00:06:17,540
some temperance, if you will, some self-control,

150
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,700
and we need to be disciplined.

151
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,940
We find that here in 2 Timothy chapter two

152
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,260
in verse number five, the apostle Paul,

153
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,000
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

154
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,940
will use an illustration that is quite similar

155
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,739
to the one used in 1 Corinthians nine.

156
00:06:29,739 --> 00:06:31,899
In fact, in just a moment, we'll turn there

157
00:06:31,899 --> 00:06:33,820
and look at that portion of scripture.

158
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,220
But we find in verse number five,

159
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:38,739
notice he says, if a man also strive for masteries,

160
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,980
that word or that phrase that is used there,

161
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:44,140
there's a connection, an illustration,

162
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:47,260
an example, if you will, that the apostle Paul is using

163
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,579
that these original readers,

164
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:52,380
Timothy, of course, the book being written to him,

165
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,619
but obviously as those in Ephesus

166
00:06:54,619 --> 00:06:58,140
and throughout the ages of the church history

167
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,420
having this book of 2 Timothy,

168
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,260
we find that immediately they would understand

169
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:07,380
and easily be able to make the connection of this phrase,

170
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,059
also strive for masteries.

171
00:07:09,059 --> 00:07:12,540
It was those that would participate in the Isthmian games.

172
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,500
They're striving for masteries.

173
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,140
They would be familiar with that.

174
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,619
We often think about our Olympic games

175
00:07:18,619 --> 00:07:21,700
that we have here in our society today.

176
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,660
And of course, they're held all over the world.

177
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:26,299
And we just had Summer Olympics this past summer.

178
00:07:26,299 --> 00:07:28,980
And you find that he uses that phrase,

179
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,140
strive for masteries.

180
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:32,959
Understand that those that are participating

181
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:34,100
in the Isthmian games,

182
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,380
those that are striving for masteries,

183
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,980
they do so with a desire.

184
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,260
What's the desire?

185
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,100
To be crowned.

186
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,540
Is it not true?

187
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:46,339
I mean, the discipline that an athlete has,

188
00:07:46,339 --> 00:07:49,140
the discipline that they have to train

189
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:51,299
and to change their diet

190
00:07:51,299 --> 00:07:52,880
and to do all the things that they do,

191
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,940
they do all of that.

192
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,500
They have all of that discipline.

193
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,140
They cannot take a day off.

194
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,100
They do not get distracted.

195
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,519
They have that discipline.

196
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:01,359
Why?

197
00:08:01,359 --> 00:08:03,720
Because they desire to be crowned.

198
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,859
But you understand that those

199
00:08:06,859 --> 00:08:09,079
that would have the desire to be crowned,

200
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:10,959
they could only be crowned

201
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:13,119
if they competed lawfully.

202
00:08:13,119 --> 00:08:15,660
In other words, if they followed the rules

203
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:19,179
that were established by those in charge.

204
00:08:21,119 --> 00:08:22,720
The Bible says in verse number five,

205
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,679
and a man also strive for masteries,

206
00:08:24,679 --> 00:08:29,679
yet is he not crowned except he strive lawfully.

207
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,459
I would say to you this morning

208
00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:32,440
that in like manner,

209
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,559
a good soldier,

210
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:35,840
as we see the introduction in verse number three

211
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,960
of being a good soldier of Jesus Christ,

212
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,280
that a good soldier must adhere to,

213
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:44,200
must abide by the guidelines provided

214
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,919
within the word of God.

215
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:48,159
I said of those competing in the Isthmian games

216
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:50,080
that they had to follow the rules

217
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,719
established by those in charge.

218
00:08:51,719 --> 00:08:53,440
Listen, it's important for God's people

219
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,599
to understand that God is in charge.

220
00:08:56,599 --> 00:08:58,320
It's important that once again,

221
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,440
we have a vision of God like Isaiah had

222
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,359
in Isaiah six,

223
00:09:02,359 --> 00:09:04,479
that we see God in his rightful place,

224
00:09:04,479 --> 00:09:06,239
high, holy, and lifted up,

225
00:09:06,239 --> 00:09:08,200
and we understand that I'm not in charge,

226
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,320
that you're not in charge,

227
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,280
but that God is in charge.

228
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,719
Too often, God's people are trying to run around

229
00:09:14,719 --> 00:09:17,340
and live their life as if they're the ones in charge,

230
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,599
as if they're the ones that make the rules,

231
00:09:19,599 --> 00:09:22,960
but the reality is that God is the one that created you.

232
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,659
God is the one that gave you breath,

233
00:09:24,659 --> 00:09:25,820
that gives you life,

234
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:30,039
and God is the one that establishes the guidelines,

235
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:35,039
the rules of living life that's pleasing to him.

236
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,320
Sometimes people have a problem with that

237
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,760
in our society today.

238
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,000
They say, no, I want to be my own man.

239
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,679
I want to be my own ruler.

240
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,979
I want to, listen,

241
00:09:44,979 --> 00:09:47,760
we're going to stand before Christ one day.

242
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,200
I'm so thankful that God gave us a Bible

243
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,320
where he revealed to us in the pages of this precious book

244
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,559
the things that please him

245
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:56,559
and the things that displease him.

246
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:57,559
What a joy.

247
00:09:57,559 --> 00:10:00,359
So we think about the subject of.

248
00:10:00,359 --> 00:10:03,659
discipline, the reality is that there's a temptation

249
00:10:03,659 --> 00:10:05,679
that every person faces.

250
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:08,139
There's a temptation to cut corners.

251
00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:10,379
There's a temptation to take a shortcut,

252
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:14,599
to take a path of least resistance, if you will,

253
00:10:14,599 --> 00:10:16,979
to take the easy way.

254
00:10:16,979 --> 00:10:18,459
Can I tell you?

255
00:10:18,459 --> 00:10:20,739
The good soldier is disciplined.

256
00:10:20,739 --> 00:10:22,859
The good soldier's not looking for the easy way.

257
00:10:22,859 --> 00:10:25,019
The good soldier's not looking to take a shortcut.

258
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:28,699
The good soldier's not looking to cut corners.

259
00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:33,719
The good soldier is disciplined to follow the instruction

260
00:10:33,719 --> 00:10:37,739
that the master has given us in his word.

261
00:10:37,739 --> 00:10:40,199
Notice in 1 Corinthians 9, and then we'll come back

262
00:10:40,199 --> 00:10:43,219
to 2 Timothy, because we're gonna see in 2 Timothy

263
00:10:43,219 --> 00:10:46,139
later on how this is illustrated, and we'll deal with that.

264
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:50,179
But turn over just briefly to 1 Corinthians 9, if you will.

265
00:10:50,179 --> 00:10:51,819
I mentioned a moment ago that Paul,

266
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:55,459
here in 1 Corinthians 9, uses this similar illustration

267
00:10:55,459 --> 00:10:59,059
of what we just read in 2 Timothy 2 in verse five.

268
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:00,699
In 1 Corinthians chapter number nine,

269
00:11:00,699 --> 00:11:04,539
we find that the apostle Paul is speaking about his own life

270
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:06,879
and what he does for the gospel's sake,

271
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,779
and I see a man that is surrendered,

272
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:11,379
that is yielded to the Lord.

273
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,899
I see a man that God used in a great way.

274
00:11:13,899 --> 00:11:16,699
And he says in verse 23, and this I do for the gospel's sake

275
00:11:16,699 --> 00:11:19,279
that I might be partaker thereof with you.

276
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,939
Know ye not that they which run in a race run all,

277
00:11:21,939 --> 00:11:24,139
but one receiveth the prize.

278
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:24,979
So what does he tell them?

279
00:11:25,499 --> 00:11:26,779
So run that ye may obtain.

280
00:11:29,059 --> 00:11:32,219
Notice in verse 25, and every man that striveth

281
00:11:32,219 --> 00:11:36,619
for the mastery, remember we saw in 2 Timothy 2 five

282
00:11:36,619 --> 00:11:38,459
that they that strive for masteries,

283
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:41,219
we see it here in verse 25, and every man that striveth

284
00:11:41,219 --> 00:11:42,699
for the mastery, notice what it says,

285
00:11:42,699 --> 00:11:46,079
is temperate in all things.

286
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,059
Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown.

287
00:11:49,059 --> 00:11:51,179
Do you know what the crown was that they received today

288
00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:52,299
in our Olympic games?

289
00:11:52,299 --> 00:11:54,839
They received gold, silver, or bronze.

290
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:59,119
But here it was really just a wreath that they would receive

291
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:03,359
and that wreath would obviously very quickly dry up,

292
00:12:03,359 --> 00:12:07,859
but they worked to receive, they were striving,

293
00:12:07,859 --> 00:12:11,179
they were competing so that they could receive a crown,

294
00:12:11,179 --> 00:12:14,039
but they would receive one that was corruptible.

295
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:19,039
But notice what the Bible says, but we an incorruptible.

296
00:12:19,319 --> 00:12:21,199
We an incorruptible.

297
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:24,359
Notice in verse 26, therefore so run.

298
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:27,199
Not as uncertainly, so fight I, not as one that beat

299
00:12:27,199 --> 00:12:29,119
at the air, but I keep under my body and bring it

300
00:12:29,119 --> 00:12:32,639
into subjection, lest that by any means when I have preached

301
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,439
to others, I myself should be a castaway.

302
00:12:35,439 --> 00:12:39,519
That word means to be rejected, useless, or of no value.

303
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:44,519
No, the Apostle Paul says I understand that as a runner,

304
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,639
as an athlete, he's using that illustration,

305
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,479
but then here in 2 Timothy, even applying that

306
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:56,519
to the good soldier, that we must strive lawfully.

307
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:58,879
We must follow the truth that God has given to us

308
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:00,279
within his word.

309
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:04,479
We must do God's work God's way.

310
00:13:04,479 --> 00:13:05,879
Does that make sense this morning?

311
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:10,879
Listen, there's no substitute for how we approach God,

312
00:13:11,719 --> 00:13:15,379
for how we serve God, he's given us truth in his word.

313
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:17,719
We do not employ the methods of the world,

314
00:13:17,719 --> 00:13:21,559
we seek to use the methods that God has given to us

315
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:22,599
in his word.

316
00:13:22,599 --> 00:13:24,839
We find that today, in fact, I had a conversation

317
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:27,439
not long ago with an evangelist, actually,

318
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:29,799
Kimberly's dad, Brother Sommerdorf, and he's been here

319
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:31,959
and he's preached before, and we had this conversation

320
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:34,039
several months ago, and he said, unfortunately,

321
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:36,639
some of our churches seem to have followed

322
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,599
a corporate mentality of a CEO perspective.

323
00:13:40,599 --> 00:13:43,699
And the reality is that the church is not a corporation,

324
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:48,219
the church is not a business to be run by the worldly ideas

325
00:13:48,219 --> 00:13:51,099
that they have for running their businesses,

326
00:13:51,099 --> 00:13:54,699
for their organizations, no, the church is the house

327
00:13:54,699 --> 00:13:58,899
of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.

328
00:13:58,899 --> 00:14:01,619
And we find that God has given us in his word

329
00:14:01,619 --> 00:14:04,579
how we are to function, how we are to operate

330
00:14:04,579 --> 00:14:07,499
as the people of God, as the church of God.

331
00:14:07,499 --> 00:14:10,699
I said this in Sunday school, the church is not the building

332
00:14:10,699 --> 00:14:12,379
the church is the people.

333
00:14:12,379 --> 00:14:14,899
The church is the people, and so how do we as a church,

334
00:14:14,899 --> 00:14:16,859
how do we function, how do we operate?

335
00:14:16,859 --> 00:14:20,059
We must do God's work God's way.

336
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:22,379
There is a way to approach God,

337
00:14:22,379 --> 00:14:24,259
and he's laid it out in his word.

338
00:14:24,259 --> 00:14:26,000
You know, we don't just come to God on our terms,

339
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,039
we come to God on his terms, amen.

340
00:14:30,299 --> 00:14:32,779
Contrary to what people say, contrary to what you've seen

341
00:14:32,779 --> 00:14:35,939
in the news in recent days, in recent weeks,

342
00:14:35,939 --> 00:14:40,659
of those that are in high positions of various denominations,

343
00:14:40,659 --> 00:14:43,259
listen, all roads don't lead to God.

344
00:14:44,739 --> 00:14:49,739
Jesus Christ said, I am the way, the truth, and the life.

345
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:53,500
No man cometh unto the father but by me.

346
00:14:54,819 --> 00:14:59,819
Let God be true, and every man a liar, amen.

347
00:15:00,339 --> 00:15:02,219
Peter stood up and said as he preached

348
00:15:02,219 --> 00:15:04,219
on the day of Pentecost, neither is there salvation

349
00:15:04,219 --> 00:15:06,319
to any other, there is no other name under heaven

350
00:15:06,319 --> 00:15:10,139
given among men whereby we must be saved.

351
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:13,979
The devil's a liar.

352
00:15:15,979 --> 00:15:18,699
I believe that many of the religions and world religions

353
00:15:18,699 --> 00:15:23,379
that are out there today are from the lies of the devil,

354
00:15:23,379 --> 00:15:26,739
to deceive mankind to think that they can come to God

355
00:15:26,739 --> 00:15:29,339
on their own way, their own approach.

356
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:30,779
No, God said that there's one way.

357
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:33,239
What happened with Cain and Abel?

358
00:15:33,239 --> 00:15:34,819
Do you remember?

359
00:15:34,819 --> 00:15:36,059
There was an offering that was brought

360
00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:37,859
that was a blood offering, and God accepted it,

361
00:15:37,859 --> 00:15:39,500
but then there was an offering that was brought by Cain

362
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,979
that was not a blood offering, and you know what God said?

363
00:15:41,979 --> 00:15:43,619
He said, why is thy countenance fallen?

364
00:15:43,619 --> 00:15:44,839
Why was his countenance fallen?

365
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:47,000
Because God didn't accept his offering.

366
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,539
Why, because it wasn't the right kind of offering.

367
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:53,179
You had to approach God on his terms.

368
00:15:53,179 --> 00:15:54,539
Blood was necessary.

369
00:15:56,299 --> 00:16:00,299
But then God said this, if thou doest well,

370
00:16:00,299 --> 00:16:02,459
shalt thou not be accepted.

371
00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:04,979
But if not, then sin lieth at the door.

372
00:16:04,979 --> 00:16:05,979
You know what God's telling us there?

373
00:16:05,979 --> 00:16:08,019
Listen, you can try to come your own way,

374
00:16:08,019 --> 00:16:11,939
but you must, as you come, you must come my way.

375
00:16:11,939 --> 00:16:14,779
And if you come my way, you'll be accepted.

376
00:16:14,779 --> 00:16:17,259
But if not, sin lieth at the door.

377
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:20,459
We serve a great God.

378
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:25,859
David learned that God's work must be done God's way.

379
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:28,339
He tried to move the ark.

380
00:16:29,219 --> 00:16:33,139
God had given prescription even in the book of Exodus

381
00:16:33,139 --> 00:16:36,139
and throughout the Pentateuch with regard to how the ark

382
00:16:36,139 --> 00:16:37,459
was not only to be constructed,

383
00:16:37,459 --> 00:16:39,219
but how the ark was to be moved

384
00:16:39,219 --> 00:16:41,419
and what the ark signified

385
00:16:41,419 --> 00:16:43,939
and what a precious truth and study.

386
00:16:43,939 --> 00:16:47,539
And we find that the ark was taken during battle.

387
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:48,459
Why, what happened?

388
00:16:48,459 --> 00:16:49,779
Well, the children of Israel

389
00:16:49,779 --> 00:16:52,459
were fighting against the Philistines and they were losing.

390
00:16:52,459 --> 00:16:55,059
And they thought, oh, well, if we just take the ark with us,

391
00:16:55,059 --> 00:16:57,139
then all of a sudden we'll win.

392
00:16:57,139 --> 00:16:58,619
That's not how it works.

393
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:02,459
They were defeated and the ark was taken.

394
00:17:03,979 --> 00:17:05,539
What a wake up call, amen?

395
00:17:06,379 --> 00:17:08,539
They thought, oh, we can just bring this,

396
00:17:08,539 --> 00:17:10,339
lucky charm with us, so to speak,

397
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:11,579
and we'll be able to have victory

398
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:12,899
because we have the ark with us.

399
00:17:12,899 --> 00:17:15,259
No, that's not how it works.

400
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:17,779
We find that the ark was taken.

401
00:17:17,779 --> 00:17:20,019
And those people, the Philistines, they suffered greatly.

402
00:17:20,019 --> 00:17:20,859
Did they not?

403
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:23,619
Dagon, their God was falling over

404
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:25,419
and they had all sorts of trouble

405
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,339
and they wanted to get rid of the ark.

406
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:30,739
And they devised a plan on how they would get the ark out

407
00:17:30,739 --> 00:17:33,539
and God worked miraculously and the ark was delivered.

408
00:17:33,539 --> 00:17:35,419
But then we find that after some time,

409
00:17:35,419 --> 00:17:36,979
David decided that the ark needed

410
00:17:36,979 --> 00:17:37,979
to come back to Jerusalem.

411
00:17:37,979 --> 00:17:39,779
By the way, it was a good plan, it was a good thought.

412
00:17:39,779 --> 00:17:42,739
It was a good thing that David wanted to do.

413
00:17:42,739 --> 00:17:44,939
The people were on board, it was supported.

414
00:17:45,819 --> 00:17:49,419
But you know, they tried to bring it on a cart.

415
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:53,619
And that's not how God said that the ark was to be moved.

416
00:17:55,059 --> 00:17:58,939
And as the ark going over that threshold

417
00:17:58,939 --> 00:18:03,500
was about to fall over, a man touched it.

418
00:18:04,339 --> 00:18:06,539
And Uzzah lost his life.

419
00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:07,899
Why?

420
00:18:07,899 --> 00:18:10,059
Because God's work must be done God's way.

421
00:18:11,099 --> 00:18:12,819
You say, well, that's kind of drastic.

422
00:18:12,819 --> 00:18:15,019
I agree, David was fearful.

423
00:18:16,259 --> 00:18:18,339
But you know what David did?

424
00:18:18,339 --> 00:18:21,859
He sought the Lord and he found out

425
00:18:21,859 --> 00:18:23,579
there's a prescribed way.

426
00:18:24,659 --> 00:18:26,699
And if we do it God's way, and guess what they did?

427
00:18:26,699 --> 00:18:28,500
They did it God's way and guess what happened?

428
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,899
The ark was brought back.

429
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:32,899
God's work must be done God's way.

430
00:18:32,899 --> 00:18:35,940
We cannot employ the methods of the world.

431
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:39,500
We cannot employ the methods of whatever it might be.

432
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,820
No, we have to get into the Bible.

433
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,179
As a Baptist, we say the Bible is a sole authority

434
00:18:44,179 --> 00:18:47,419
not only for faith, but for practice.

435
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:49,260
Why do we do the things that we do?

436
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,140
Why do we worship?

437
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,739
Why do we do what we do?

438
00:18:51,739 --> 00:18:55,539
Well, God has prescribed the way to approach him,

439
00:18:55,539 --> 00:18:57,539
the way to worship him.

440
00:18:57,539 --> 00:19:00,339
And here we find that this good soldier,

441
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:01,619
in 2 Timothy chapter two,

442
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,380
he's going to have discipline in his life.

443
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,179
We find that we live in a society today

444
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:08,500
where there's such a lack of discipline.

445
00:19:09,779 --> 00:19:11,059
Is it not true?

446
00:19:11,059 --> 00:19:12,380
We see it all around us.

447
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,140
There's a lack of discipline

448
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,500
on the part of our citizens of our nation.

449
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,140
And we find even in our churches,

450
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:20,059
and we find this morning that as we come

451
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:22,700
to verse number five of 2 Timothy two,

452
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,260
that as I summarize the thought of this verse,

453
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:28,979
that we find that this one that's striving for masteries,

454
00:19:28,979 --> 00:19:31,339
he's not crowned except he strive lawfully.

455
00:19:32,019 --> 00:19:33,419
There's discipline.

456
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:35,219
And as we look at this passage of scripture

457
00:19:35,219 --> 00:19:37,099
in 2 Timothy two, I want to draw your attention

458
00:19:37,099 --> 00:19:38,859
to verses 22 and 23.

459
00:19:38,859 --> 00:19:41,099
And I give you some thoughts this morning.

460
00:19:41,099 --> 00:19:42,779
The Bible says this in verse 22

461
00:19:42,779 --> 00:19:44,820
of 2 Timothy chapter two.

462
00:19:46,219 --> 00:19:48,659
Flee also youthful lust,

463
00:19:48,659 --> 00:19:52,339
but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace,

464
00:19:52,339 --> 00:19:55,700
with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.

465
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:59,179
Verse 23, but foolish and unlearned questions avoid,

466
00:19:59,179 --> 00:20:00,459
knowing that they.

467
00:20:00,459 --> 00:20:03,659
they do gender strifes.

468
00:20:03,659 --> 00:20:05,259
If you're taking notes this morning,

469
00:20:05,259 --> 00:20:06,699
I want you to, number one,

470
00:20:06,699 --> 00:20:10,379
consider what the disciplined soldier flees.

471
00:20:10,379 --> 00:20:12,039
There's some things that they flee from.

472
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:13,859
According to verse number 22,

473
00:20:13,859 --> 00:20:18,859
the Bible says, flee also youthful lust.

474
00:20:18,979 --> 00:20:21,419
We find that there's an obvious reference

475
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:23,619
in this phrase that is given to us

476
00:20:23,619 --> 00:20:25,979
in 2 Timothy 2 and verse 22.

477
00:20:25,979 --> 00:20:29,339
There's an obvious reference to immoral behavior.

478
00:20:29,379 --> 00:20:33,139
And oh, how we see the immorality in our world today.

479
00:20:33,139 --> 00:20:36,639
We see the immorality, not only in the world today,

480
00:20:36,639 --> 00:20:38,299
but I'm saying to you this morning

481
00:20:38,299 --> 00:20:41,619
that we see immorality in the church today.

482
00:20:41,619 --> 00:20:44,699
It's a sad thing, but it's a true thing.

483
00:20:44,699 --> 00:20:47,299
It brings a reproach against the name of Christ.

484
00:20:48,459 --> 00:20:50,459
There's some that say, well, you know,

485
00:20:50,459 --> 00:20:52,699
I don't think you have to go to that extent.

486
00:20:52,699 --> 00:20:54,579
I don't think you have to go to that extreme.

487
00:20:54,579 --> 00:20:56,599
I beg to differ.

488
00:20:56,599 --> 00:20:57,979
There are things that we must do.

489
00:20:57,979 --> 00:21:00,259
There are guards that we must put in place.

490
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,079
Why?

491
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:03,699
Because the devil is a roaring lion

492
00:21:03,699 --> 00:21:06,339
and he's seeking whom he may devour.

493
00:21:06,339 --> 00:21:07,779
There's some things that we need to flee from.

494
00:21:07,779 --> 00:21:09,539
Listen, I thank the Lord for Joseph

495
00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:10,939
that he put on his running shoes.

496
00:21:10,939 --> 00:21:13,939
I know that's a little past the pirate song

497
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,979
that they sing and put on the running shoes.

498
00:21:16,979 --> 00:21:17,999
And guess what?

499
00:21:17,999 --> 00:21:21,299
When Potiphar's wife took that opportunity

500
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:23,779
after days of saying lie with me

501
00:21:23,779 --> 00:21:26,399
and Joseph resisting and resisting,

502
00:21:26,399 --> 00:21:29,039
she finally had that moment that she thought,

503
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,759
now I have him cornered,

504
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:33,999
but Joseph put on his running shoes and he fled.

505
00:21:33,999 --> 00:21:35,459
He got out of that place.

506
00:21:35,459 --> 00:21:36,299
Why?

507
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:38,439
Because he said, how can I do this great wickedness

508
00:21:38,439 --> 00:21:41,039
and sin against God?

509
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,159
He had a right view of God.

510
00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:44,959
He said, there's some things I need to flee.

511
00:21:44,959 --> 00:21:48,239
He lost his coat, but he retained his character.

512
00:21:48,239 --> 00:21:49,439
Hallelujah.

513
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:52,119
I have a policy.

514
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:53,999
I don't meet with women by myself.

515
00:21:53,999 --> 00:21:56,039
I don't go anywhere with women by myself

516
00:21:56,679 --> 00:21:58,599
other than my wife or my daughters.

517
00:21:58,599 --> 00:21:59,559
Amen?

518
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:01,879
Or my mom, a family member, what have you.

519
00:22:01,879 --> 00:22:04,559
But the reality, I had a lady call one time

520
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,039
several years ago and say, I need to meet with you.

521
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:07,079
And I said, okay, that's wonderful.

522
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:07,919
I don't know who you are.

523
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,359
I don't know why you want to meet,

524
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:10,379
but I'm glad to schedule it.

525
00:22:10,379 --> 00:22:11,799
She said, what are your office hours?

526
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:13,379
I don't have office hours.

527
00:22:14,439 --> 00:22:15,279
Amen?

528
00:22:16,239 --> 00:22:17,679
You say, I can't believe you don't have office hours.

529
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,219
I'm here all the time, okay?

530
00:22:20,219 --> 00:22:22,359
But I don't have office hours for some lady

531
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:24,799
that calls me on the phone that wants to meet with me.

532
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,239
Do you understand what I'm saying?

533
00:22:26,239 --> 00:22:27,919
And I said this, I'd be glad to set up

534
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,219
an appointment with you, and my wife will be present.

535
00:22:30,219 --> 00:22:31,439
She said, I don't want to meet with your wife.

536
00:22:31,439 --> 00:22:32,279
I want to meet with you.

537
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:35,199
And I said, I'm sorry, I'm not going to meet with you.

538
00:22:35,199 --> 00:22:36,039
You say, well, that's rude.

539
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:38,239
No, it's just good sense.

540
00:22:41,239 --> 00:22:42,599
Amen?

541
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:44,719
She said, fine, I'll just come to church.

542
00:22:44,719 --> 00:22:45,599
I said, that's wonderful.

543
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:46,559
Come in church.

544
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:47,399
Praise the Lord.

545
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:49,199
My wife will be here, amen?

546
00:22:49,199 --> 00:22:50,939
And she came to church.

547
00:22:50,939 --> 00:22:51,779
You know what she wanted?

548
00:22:51,779 --> 00:22:53,039
She wanted us to pay her rent bill.

549
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,879
She walked in and she handed me a folder

550
00:22:54,879 --> 00:22:55,719
and wanted us to pay her rent bill.

551
00:22:55,719 --> 00:22:57,639
It was a silly situation, but I said, listen,

552
00:22:57,639 --> 00:22:59,759
I don't meet with women by myself.

553
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:02,319
Some member of our church asked to meet with me

554
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:04,279
not long ago, and I said, that's not a problem.

555
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:05,299
I'll be glad to meet with you,

556
00:23:05,299 --> 00:23:06,799
but either my wife is going to be there

557
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,439
or your husband will be there.

558
00:23:09,399 --> 00:23:10,979
You pick, I don't care which,

559
00:23:10,979 --> 00:23:14,039
but I'm not going to meet with you by myself.

560
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:15,679
Amen?

561
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:16,879
Flee also youthful lusts.

562
00:23:16,879 --> 00:23:21,239
Let him that thinketh he stand, take he lest he fall.

563
00:23:21,239 --> 00:23:23,799
That's what your Bible says, what my Bible says.

564
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:26,519
There's an obvious reference to immoral behavior.

565
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:28,939
It said, I don't agree with everything,

566
00:23:28,939 --> 00:23:30,319
and I try to make that disclaimer

567
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:33,159
because I don't want people to get a wrong idea,

568
00:23:33,159 --> 00:23:36,839
but it said that Billy Graham had a policy

569
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:38,639
that he never met with women by himself.

570
00:23:38,639 --> 00:23:40,679
He never went anywhere with a woman by himself,

571
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:43,039
and in fact, when he traveled, as much as he traveled,

572
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:45,519
he always had members of his team

573
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:49,419
that went into the hotel room with him

574
00:23:49,459 --> 00:23:52,899
just in case a lady was in there waiting for him.

575
00:23:54,419 --> 00:23:57,619
You say, do we really need to do that?

576
00:23:57,619 --> 00:24:00,339
Listen, it's a good practice.

577
00:24:00,339 --> 00:24:02,619
You know, men, you know the reality

578
00:24:02,619 --> 00:24:04,379
is that you don't have to do anything.

579
00:24:04,379 --> 00:24:06,719
You just have to be accused of doing something.

580
00:24:11,019 --> 00:24:12,159
Just be accused.

581
00:24:14,259 --> 00:24:18,579
We see people in our society,

582
00:24:18,579 --> 00:24:23,059
preachers falling due to immoral behavior.

583
00:24:23,059 --> 00:24:24,099
Do you not see it in the news?

584
00:24:24,099 --> 00:24:25,579
I see it in the news.

585
00:24:25,579 --> 00:24:28,179
I don't know these men personally, but I see it.

586
00:24:29,379 --> 00:24:30,959
Listen, there's an obvious reference here

587
00:24:30,959 --> 00:24:33,099
that a good soldier, a disciplined soldier

588
00:24:33,099 --> 00:24:35,579
is gonna flee from some things,

589
00:24:35,579 --> 00:24:37,139
and it says flee also youthful lust.

590
00:24:37,139 --> 00:24:39,539
I believe there's an obvious reference to immoral behavior,

591
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:40,939
but we also think about that subject,

592
00:24:40,939 --> 00:24:42,259
that thought of youthful lust.

593
00:24:42,259 --> 00:24:44,679
It can refer to those foolish actions

594
00:24:44,679 --> 00:24:47,599
that can allure us, especially in our youth.

595
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:50,279
Remember, Paul is writing to Timothy as a young man.

596
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:52,719
Now, he's probably my age when he's being written to,

597
00:24:52,719 --> 00:24:54,479
but I'm still a young man, amen,

598
00:24:54,479 --> 00:24:55,919
and praise the Lord for that.

599
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,319
Timothy's not a teenager when he's being written to,

600
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:01,119
and we often use the verse of Scripture,

601
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:03,679
let no man despise thy youth.

602
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,959
The reality is that he wasn't a teenager,

603
00:25:05,959 --> 00:25:09,319
and we use that verse of Scripture with teenagers sometimes.

604
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:11,999
It's actually a verse that we've used often there

605
00:25:11,999 --> 00:25:14,499
in 1 Timothy 4 and verse 12,

606
00:25:14,499 --> 00:25:17,499
but the reality is that Timothy is probably 40-ish

607
00:25:18,379 --> 00:25:22,059
in his early 40s, but there's still these youthful lusts,

608
00:25:22,059 --> 00:25:25,059
and Paul says flee these things.

609
00:25:25,059 --> 00:25:26,979
Let me remind you what Proverbs says.

610
00:25:26,979 --> 00:25:29,799
In Proverbs chapter one, you don't need to turn there.

611
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:30,639
I'll read it to you,

612
00:25:30,639 --> 00:25:31,459
because we're gonna go right back

613
00:25:31,459 --> 00:25:33,579
to 2 Timothy chapter two,

614
00:25:33,579 --> 00:25:35,579
but in Proverbs chapter one in verse number 10,

615
00:25:35,579 --> 00:25:39,219
the Bible says, my son, if sinners entice thee,

616
00:25:39,219 --> 00:25:42,539
consent thou not.

617
00:25:42,539 --> 00:25:45,339
You know, there's some times that we just need to say no.

618
00:25:45,339 --> 00:25:46,439
I'm not gonna go there.

619
00:25:46,439 --> 00:25:47,279
I'm not gonna do that.

620
00:25:48,099 --> 00:25:48,919
I'm not gonna participate in that.

621
00:25:48,919 --> 00:25:49,759
Why?

622
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:50,799
Because there's nothing good that's gonna come about

623
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:51,759
from that thing.

624
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:54,439
There's no way that that thing is going to bring honor

625
00:25:54,439 --> 00:25:55,539
and glory to my God.

626
00:25:55,539 --> 00:25:59,279
It's going to tarnish my testimony for God.

627
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:02,759
There's some things, when we think about being disciplined

628
00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:04,259
and being a disciplined soldier,

629
00:26:04,259 --> 00:26:07,719
there's some things that we must flee from.

630
00:26:07,719 --> 00:26:09,639
We must flee from, but notice with me

631
00:26:09,639 --> 00:26:11,979
back in 2 Timothy chapter two,

632
00:26:11,979 --> 00:26:14,159
we see in verse 22 that the Bible says,

633
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:15,479
flee also youthful lusts,

634
00:26:15,479 --> 00:26:16,979
but then notice the Bible says,

635
00:26:17,719 --> 00:26:18,559
but follow righteousness.

636
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:20,519
Number two, not only do we consider

637
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:22,059
what the disciplined soldier flees,

638
00:26:22,059 --> 00:26:25,359
but we consider what the disciplined soldier follows.

639
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:30,359
He says, follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace.

640
00:26:31,399 --> 00:26:33,899
Now, think about these phrases that are used,

641
00:26:33,899 --> 00:26:36,759
these words that God uses here in verse 22,

642
00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:38,839
and thinking about following righteousness,

643
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:40,359
that's doing that which is right,

644
00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:41,519
doing that which is pleasing.

645
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:45,599
We talked about the good soldier seeking to please his God.

646
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:46,479
What is right?

647
00:26:46,979 --> 00:26:48,579
Listen, we live in a society today

648
00:26:48,579 --> 00:26:52,379
that has tried to move the needle, if you will,

649
00:26:52,379 --> 00:26:54,779
with regard to what is right and what is wrong.

650
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,779
We find that we live in a culture today,

651
00:26:56,779 --> 00:26:59,699
just like Jeremiah and Isaiah ministered in a culture

652
00:26:59,699 --> 00:27:02,419
where they called right, evil, good.

653
00:27:02,419 --> 00:27:04,459
They called good, evil, and evil, good.

654
00:27:04,459 --> 00:27:07,139
We live in a society today where they're trying

655
00:27:07,139 --> 00:27:09,919
to change the moral compass.

656
00:27:12,039 --> 00:27:13,459
It's not really that bad.

657
00:27:13,459 --> 00:27:14,919
Everyone else is doing it.

658
00:27:15,179 --> 00:27:19,539
When you compare it to this, that's not how it works.

659
00:27:19,539 --> 00:27:23,019
That's not what God's people should use as our standard.

660
00:27:23,019 --> 00:27:25,939
No, the moral compass of our society

661
00:27:25,939 --> 00:27:28,419
is not what we determine for what is right

662
00:27:28,419 --> 00:27:29,259
and what is wrong.

663
00:27:29,259 --> 00:27:31,499
It is this book that determines what is right

664
00:27:31,499 --> 00:27:33,279
and what is wrong.

665
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:35,739
And we follow after righteousness.

666
00:27:35,739 --> 00:27:37,259
It requires discipline.

667
00:27:37,259 --> 00:27:39,299
You say, but everybody else is going that way,

668
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:40,739
but I wanna be a good soldier,

669
00:27:40,739 --> 00:27:43,199
and I wanna follow righteousness.

670
00:27:45,219 --> 00:27:47,179
It's not always easy swimming upstream.

671
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:51,019
We're called to make a difference.

672
00:27:51,019 --> 00:27:53,259
We're called to live for God,

673
00:27:53,259 --> 00:27:57,799
to do that which is right, to take the high road.

674
00:27:59,439 --> 00:28:00,279
Why?

675
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:02,939
Again, because I'm gonna stand before my Savior one day,

676
00:28:02,939 --> 00:28:04,699
and so are you.

677
00:28:04,699 --> 00:28:08,939
So we follow, notice, after righteousness.

678
00:28:08,939 --> 00:28:11,619
He then says this, not only follow righteousness,

679
00:28:11,619 --> 00:28:12,619
but faith.

680
00:28:12,639 --> 00:28:15,679
Now think about faith, and we consider this idea of faith.

681
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:17,559
Without faith, it's impossible to please him,

682
00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:19,679
for he that cometh to God must believe that he is,

683
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:22,419
and then he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.

684
00:28:22,419 --> 00:28:25,879
Will the Son of Man find faith on the earth?

685
00:28:25,879 --> 00:28:27,999
I was reading this morning, actually yesterday,

686
00:28:27,999 --> 00:28:29,639
I was reading the book of Matthew,

687
00:28:29,639 --> 00:28:31,279
and I was reading it this morning as well,

688
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:32,439
but yesterday I was reading it,

689
00:28:32,439 --> 00:28:33,959
and I came to Matthew chapter number eight,

690
00:28:33,959 --> 00:28:36,319
and I read about that centurion,

691
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:38,559
and I read about his great faith.

692
00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:42,559
He said, I got a servant that's back home

693
00:28:43,379 --> 00:28:44,219
that's sick of the palsy,

694
00:28:44,219 --> 00:28:46,299
and Jesus said, I'll come to your house,

695
00:28:46,299 --> 00:28:47,619
and I'll heal him, and he said,

696
00:28:47,619 --> 00:28:50,779
no, I'm not worthy for you to come to my house.

697
00:28:50,779 --> 00:28:53,019
Just speak the word.

698
00:28:53,019 --> 00:28:55,659
Think about the faith of the centurion.

699
00:28:57,379 --> 00:29:00,219
And the Bible says that the man used the illustration

700
00:29:00,219 --> 00:29:02,899
that he was a man that had authority,

701
00:29:02,899 --> 00:29:04,919
and he said, come, and they come,

702
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:06,379
and he said, go, and they go,

703
00:29:06,379 --> 00:29:07,839
and he said, do, and they do,

704
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:11,379
and he recognized that Jesus is God.

705
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:16,159
And he said, all you have to do is speak the word,

706
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:18,319
and Jesus said, what great faith.

707
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:21,359
He marveled at his faith.

708
00:29:22,239 --> 00:29:24,199
Where do we get faith?

709
00:29:24,199 --> 00:29:27,199
So then faith cometh by hearing,

710
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:28,999
hearing by the word.

711
00:29:28,999 --> 00:29:32,039
So thankful that God would increase our faith,

712
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:34,959
that God would help us to have faith in who he is,

713
00:29:34,959 --> 00:29:36,879
taking him at his word,

714
00:29:36,879 --> 00:29:39,679
believing that he is able,

715
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:40,819
he is God.

716
00:29:42,059 --> 00:29:45,659
I said this last week when I talked about pleasing God,

717
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:48,939
and that one way that we please God is living by faith.

718
00:29:48,939 --> 00:29:51,779
I said this, that every time we share the gospel,

719
00:29:51,779 --> 00:29:53,619
we're exercising faith.

720
00:29:53,619 --> 00:29:54,439
Why?

721
00:29:54,439 --> 00:29:56,219
Because we're believing the truth of Romans

722
00:29:56,219 --> 00:29:58,299
when the Bible says the gospel is the power of God

723
00:29:58,299 --> 00:29:59,359
unto salvation.

724
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:02,299
I met a man in Florida when I was down there.

725
00:30:02,299 --> 00:30:05,179
I went to Walmart like 47 times when I was in Florida.

726
00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:07,459
It really wasn't that many times, but it felt like it.

727
00:30:07,459 --> 00:30:08,939
But I met a man, Tim, I walked in,

728
00:30:08,939 --> 00:30:11,379
and they had, our Walmart here doesn't have this,

729
00:30:11,379 --> 00:30:12,979
but I know the one in Manassas does.

730
00:30:12,979 --> 00:30:15,259
They have gates, like you can't even get into Walmart

731
00:30:15,259 --> 00:30:17,259
unless you trip that thing and it opens up for you.

732
00:30:17,259 --> 00:30:18,699
I don't know what the deal is.

733
00:30:18,699 --> 00:30:21,059
I understand leaving, right?

734
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:22,499
Like you don't want people stealing stuff,

735
00:30:22,499 --> 00:30:24,339
but they had this gate there and there was a man

736
00:30:24,339 --> 00:30:26,699
standing there, and his name was Ephraim.

737
00:30:27,699 --> 00:30:30,779
I have never met somebody named Ephraim before.

738
00:30:30,779 --> 00:30:33,299
Personally, never met anyone named Ephraim.

739
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:34,579
I thought, well, that's interesting.

740
00:30:34,579 --> 00:30:37,839
Listen, I like talking to people when they have Bible names.

741
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:39,699
To me, it's an open door.

742
00:30:39,699 --> 00:30:40,739
It's an open door.

743
00:30:40,739 --> 00:30:43,459
I said, man, Ephraim, I said, man, that's a great name.

744
00:30:44,299 --> 00:30:48,099
I said, do you know about Ephraim in the Bible?

745
00:30:48,099 --> 00:30:48,939
He's like, oh yeah.

746
00:30:48,939 --> 00:30:52,439
I said, your mom must have been pretty serious

747
00:30:52,439 --> 00:30:55,539
about the Lord and the Bible to name you Ephraim.

748
00:30:55,619 --> 00:30:57,879
He said, my name's Ephraim Obadiah.

749
00:31:00,579 --> 00:31:03,379
How many of you have met an Ephraim Obadiah?

750
00:31:03,379 --> 00:31:05,099
I mean, Aaron and Elizabeth, they're saying,

751
00:31:05,099 --> 00:31:08,819
hey, maybe we're gonna name our sons Ephraim Obadiah.

752
00:31:08,819 --> 00:31:11,099
I've never met an Ephraim Obadiah.

753
00:31:12,099 --> 00:31:13,499
So I started talking to him.

754
00:31:14,819 --> 00:31:17,419
He told me his mom still lives in Atlanta,

755
00:31:17,419 --> 00:31:20,579
goes to church faithfully, wonderful.

756
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:22,459
And I said, Ephraim, what about you?

757
00:31:22,459 --> 00:31:24,899
If you're to die today, are you gonna go to heaven?

758
00:31:24,899 --> 00:31:27,439
Are you sure that your sins have been forgiven?

759
00:31:27,439 --> 00:31:29,139
He said, no, I'm not sure of that.

760
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:33,579
He's probably 60 years old.

761
00:31:33,579 --> 00:31:37,539
His name was Ephraim Obadiah, and he was going to hell.

762
00:31:39,099 --> 00:31:40,019
He didn't know the gospel.

763
00:31:40,019 --> 00:31:41,419
He didn't know the truth of salvation.

764
00:31:41,419 --> 00:31:42,259
What a shame.

765
00:31:43,179 --> 00:31:45,579
Does anybody believe the gospel tract?

766
00:31:45,579 --> 00:31:46,419
He was working.

767
00:31:46,419 --> 00:31:48,179
I wasn't able to get into a whole gospel presentation.

768
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:51,179
I told him he could know for sure that heaven is his home.

769
00:31:51,179 --> 00:31:52,679
It's exercising faith.

770
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,519
When I went back to try to follow up with Ephraim,

771
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:57,579
I found a man by the name of Micah.

772
00:31:58,679 --> 00:31:59,999
I mean, he was standing at the same place.

773
00:31:59,999 --> 00:32:03,319
I said, man, I must be in the place of God, amen?

774
00:32:03,319 --> 00:32:06,119
Felt like Jacob, like what is going on here, right?

775
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:08,759
This man, his name is Micah, and I'm like, here we go, right?

776
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:09,599
I mean, what an opportunity.

777
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:12,039
I said, here, I want you to read this.

778
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:16,999
Listen, we exercise faith by taking God at his word.

779
00:32:16,999 --> 00:32:18,879
You know, when we give an offering,

780
00:32:18,879 --> 00:32:19,719
you know what you're doing?

781
00:32:19,719 --> 00:32:21,839
You're exercising faith.

782
00:32:21,879 --> 00:32:23,319
You know what God said in the book of Malachi?

783
00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:25,079
Prove me.

784
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:25,979
Prove me.

785
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:29,679
You say, I can't afford to give.

786
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,039
You're deceived.

787
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:32,619
You're not living by faith.

788
00:32:32,619 --> 00:32:34,519
You're not trusting God.

789
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:38,879
Because God said, prove me, and God will bless.

790
00:32:38,879 --> 00:32:39,899
God will bless.

791
00:32:39,899 --> 00:32:44,899
We find that he says, follow righteousness, faith, charity.

792
00:32:45,259 --> 00:32:46,479
We use the word love.

793
00:32:46,479 --> 00:32:50,839
I love the truth of God's word with regard to charity

794
00:32:50,839 --> 00:32:54,439
and love and how all things are to be done

795
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:58,559
with fervent charity, according to 1 Peter chapter four.

796
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:02,119
We find that we're to love, as Jesus said in John 13,

797
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:05,499
I give you a new commandment, that you love one another,

798
00:33:05,499 --> 00:33:09,039
but how, as Christ loved, as I have loved you.

799
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:11,559
It's amazing to me at the beginning of John 13

800
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:15,139
that Jesus says that I loved him to the end.

801
00:33:15,139 --> 00:33:18,399
I'm thankful that we serve a God who is a loving God.

802
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:20,639
I'm thankful that we serve a God who loves me

803
00:33:21,439 --> 00:33:22,999
with an unconditional love, with an everlasting love.

804
00:33:22,999 --> 00:33:25,059
I'm thankful for the truth that God said

805
00:33:25,059 --> 00:33:27,139
that there's nothing that can separate me

806
00:33:27,139 --> 00:33:28,819
from the love of God.

807
00:33:28,819 --> 00:33:30,979
But you understand that we are to walk in love.

808
00:33:30,979 --> 00:33:32,779
We are to love one another.

809
00:33:32,779 --> 00:33:36,939
We are to follow, he says, listen, if you're disciplined,

810
00:33:36,939 --> 00:33:38,579
if you're a disciplined soldier,

811
00:33:38,579 --> 00:33:39,979
if you're gonna be a good soldier,

812
00:33:39,979 --> 00:33:41,739
there's gonna be discipline in your life.

813
00:33:41,739 --> 00:33:44,739
You need to flee some things, but you need to follow things.

814
00:33:44,739 --> 00:33:49,699
Righteousness, faith, charity, notice number four, peace.

815
00:33:49,699 --> 00:33:52,039
Our world knows no peace.

816
00:33:52,039 --> 00:33:53,519
Our world is in turmoil.

817
00:33:54,959 --> 00:33:58,079
Our world, listen, I'm telling you,

818
00:33:58,079 --> 00:33:59,839
I've read the Bible, I've read it through,

819
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:02,119
I don't know how many times, I've never kept track

820
00:34:02,119 --> 00:34:05,439
of a combined number of times I've read the Bible,

821
00:34:05,439 --> 00:34:08,199
but I've read the Bible through twice this year already,

822
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,799
and I've read the Bible through many times.

823
00:34:09,799 --> 00:34:13,459
Can I tell you, the world is longing for a peace treaty.

824
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,279
And you know who's gonna bring it?

825
00:34:16,279 --> 00:34:17,719
The Antichrist.

826
00:34:19,879 --> 00:34:21,279
Listen, if you don't believe that,

827
00:34:21,279 --> 00:34:23,039
you need to read the Bible,

828
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:25,699
because I'm telling you, that's what the Bible teaches us,

829
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:27,199
that the Antichrist is gonna come on the scene,

830
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,519
he's gonna bring a peace treaty,

831
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:30,299
and you see all these things going on in the world,

832
00:34:30,299 --> 00:34:31,599
and you say, it's all out of control.

833
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:33,000
No, it's all falling in place.

834
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,279
God is in control.

835
00:34:34,279 --> 00:34:36,439
The Lord God omnipotent reigneth.

836
00:34:36,439 --> 00:34:41,359
And the reality is that if there's no turmoil,

837
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:44,039
there's no agreement on a peace treaty.

838
00:34:44,039 --> 00:34:49,039
But in great turmoil, as we see in our world today,

839
00:34:50,439 --> 00:34:53,299
oh, it's ripe for a peace treaty.

840
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:54,939
It's ripe for a peace treaty.

841
00:34:55,919 --> 00:34:57,919
The Antichrist is gonna come on the scene.

842
00:34:57,919 --> 00:34:59,519
He's gonna offer a peace treaty.

843
00:35:00,399 --> 00:35:01,419
It's gonna happen.

844
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:05,239
But we understand that we know the Prince of Peace.

845
00:35:06,279 --> 00:35:07,679
Aren't you thankful?

846
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:10,639
He says, follow peace.

847
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:12,399
I'm thankful that the Bible tells us

848
00:35:12,399 --> 00:35:15,579
that we have the peace of God.

849
00:35:16,479 --> 00:35:18,399
I'm thankful that the Bible tells us

850
00:35:18,579 --> 00:35:20,179
that he is the Prince of Peace,

851
00:35:20,179 --> 00:35:25,179
and that he said, my peace give I unto thee, in John 14.

852
00:35:26,379 --> 00:35:27,779
Oh, hallelujah.

853
00:35:27,779 --> 00:35:29,899
It's not as the world giveth.

854
00:35:29,899 --> 00:35:32,819
Great peace have they which love thy law,

855
00:35:32,819 --> 00:35:35,259
and nothing shall offend them.

856
00:35:35,259 --> 00:35:37,979
Oh, he'll keep us in perfect peace.

857
00:35:37,979 --> 00:35:39,699
The Bible says that he'll give us a peace

858
00:35:39,699 --> 00:35:42,559
that passeth all understanding.

859
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:44,339
The Bible says this in Colossians,

860
00:35:44,339 --> 00:35:47,439
that we're to let the peace of God rule in our hearts.

861
00:35:47,459 --> 00:35:48,819
That means when all the turmoil

862
00:35:48,819 --> 00:35:50,899
and all the difficulties all around us,

863
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:52,859
no, we're keeping our eyes on Jesus,

864
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:55,019
and we're allowing the peace of God

865
00:35:55,019 --> 00:35:56,779
to rule in our hearts.

866
00:35:56,779 --> 00:35:59,539
Though the chaos and the turmoil and all that's going on,

867
00:35:59,539 --> 00:36:03,059
no, I know the Prince of Peace,

868
00:36:03,059 --> 00:36:04,939
and I'm following after peace.

869
00:36:08,139 --> 00:36:11,059
Notice he says this at the end of verse 22.

870
00:36:11,059 --> 00:36:14,619
With them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.

871
00:36:14,619 --> 00:36:16,539
You see that little phrase with them?

872
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:18,000
I like that.

873
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,039
You know why I would say it this way?

874
00:36:20,039 --> 00:36:23,639
The soldier that's a good soldier that's disciplined,

875
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:25,519
he's running with the right crowd.

876
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:32,399
Follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace,

877
00:36:32,399 --> 00:36:36,519
with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.

878
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:40,639
I'm thankful for my brothers and sisters in Christ

879
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:44,779
that are following righteousness, faith,

880
00:36:45,639 --> 00:36:48,959
charity, and peace.

881
00:36:48,959 --> 00:36:50,919
You know, we can encourage one another

882
00:36:50,919 --> 00:36:55,099
as we're following the Lord together with them.

883
00:36:55,099 --> 00:36:56,859
You know, we need to be careful.

884
00:36:56,859 --> 00:36:59,079
The Bible tells us that we're not to be deceived,

885
00:36:59,079 --> 00:37:02,719
that evil communications corrupt good manners.

886
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:04,339
It's a Bible truth.

887
00:37:04,339 --> 00:37:06,039
My parents didn't know anything about the Bible

888
00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:08,959
when I was a little kid, my grandparents,

889
00:37:08,959 --> 00:37:10,919
but I remember them talking about the truth

890
00:37:10,919 --> 00:37:14,279
of a bad apple's gonna spoil the other apples.

891
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:16,839
And then I found out as I read the Bible

892
00:37:16,839 --> 00:37:18,559
and as obviously my parents got saved,

893
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:19,839
they read the Bible that man,

894
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:21,399
that little phrase that they use,

895
00:37:21,399 --> 00:37:24,319
there's really some Bible truth to that.

896
00:37:24,319 --> 00:37:28,759
Be not deceived, evil communications corrupt good manners.

897
00:37:30,959 --> 00:37:31,919
Who are we running with?

898
00:37:31,919 --> 00:37:33,319
Who do we spend our time with?

899
00:37:33,319 --> 00:37:36,919
Are we going with those that are following

900
00:37:36,919 --> 00:37:38,919
after the same things that we're following after?

901
00:37:38,919 --> 00:37:41,559
Are we, listen, iron sharpeneth iron.

902
00:37:42,339 --> 00:37:45,659
Are we going, running with the right crowd,

903
00:37:45,659 --> 00:37:47,199
the people that are gonna encourage us,

904
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:49,339
that are gonna challenge us to live godly

905
00:37:49,339 --> 00:37:51,539
and to live righteously in this present world

906
00:37:51,539 --> 00:37:53,419
to seek to please God?

907
00:37:53,419 --> 00:37:57,759
Who do we, who are those that we allow to influence us?

908
00:37:57,759 --> 00:37:59,419
You say, I don't let anybody influence me.

909
00:37:59,419 --> 00:38:00,500
You're crazy.

910
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:02,939
Because the people that you run with

911
00:38:02,939 --> 00:38:05,939
in the books that you read, they're influencing you.

912
00:38:07,419 --> 00:38:08,859
It's the way it works.

913
00:38:09,639 --> 00:38:13,839
We find that he says that you're to flee some things,

914
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:15,679
you're to follow some things,

915
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:17,139
and you're to follow with them.

916
00:38:17,139 --> 00:38:19,799
Listen, I think I'm gonna preach about Elijah tonight.

917
00:38:19,799 --> 00:38:21,839
I said this in Sunday school this morning

918
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:22,759
at the end of the lesson,

919
00:38:22,759 --> 00:38:26,599
but God got my attention in 1 Kings 19 this past week

920
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:28,079
on a question that he asked Elijah

921
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:29,919
and I just couldn't get away from it.

922
00:38:30,879 --> 00:38:32,119
I'm gonna preach about Elijah tonight,

923
00:38:32,119 --> 00:38:33,359
but you know what Elijah said?

924
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:34,599
I'm the only one.

925
00:38:35,719 --> 00:38:37,119
God said there are 7,000.

926
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:38,559
Now that's not part of my message tonight,

927
00:38:39,299 --> 00:38:40,140
so I can say it,

928
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:41,979
because I'll save everything else for tonight.

929
00:38:41,979 --> 00:38:44,899
But the reality is that he had that perspective.

930
00:38:44,899 --> 00:38:46,820
I'm the only one.

931
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:47,700
Can I tell you this morning,

932
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,179
you're not the only one that's following Christ.

933
00:38:50,179 --> 00:38:51,619
And you need to find some other people

934
00:38:51,619 --> 00:38:52,459
that are following Christ

935
00:38:52,459 --> 00:38:54,779
that are gonna build you up spiritually.

936
00:38:54,779 --> 00:38:56,500
They're gonna edify you.

937
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,579
The Bible says that we're to edify one another.

938
00:38:58,579 --> 00:38:59,659
Yes, we're to love one another,

939
00:38:59,659 --> 00:39:01,299
but we're to edify, we're to build up.

940
00:39:01,299 --> 00:39:04,299
Listen, it is good for us to have some friends,

941
00:39:04,299 --> 00:39:08,179
some, listen, understand with me this morning

942
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:11,640
that a true godly friend will call you out

943
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,140
when you're not walking right.

944
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,399
And you ought to thank God for that person.

945
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:21,200
You ought to thank God for that person

946
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,719
that's gonna keep you accountable,

947
00:39:24,919 --> 00:39:28,279
that's gonna challenge you to walk with Christ,

948
00:39:28,279 --> 00:39:31,079
that's gonna challenge you to grow in your faith.

949
00:39:32,279 --> 00:39:34,359
You ought to thank God for that person

950
00:39:34,359 --> 00:39:35,919
that will keep you accountable.

951
00:39:36,739 --> 00:39:39,779
You know, I've learned something over the years

952
00:39:39,779 --> 00:39:41,679
about working out.

953
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:43,279
Number one, I don't do it a lot.

954
00:39:45,099 --> 00:39:46,579
I enjoy working out.

955
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:50,380
And I've really enjoyed it in recent years

956
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:52,659
as I've been able to work out with Joseph.

957
00:39:53,779 --> 00:39:56,359
Not only is he my son,

958
00:39:56,359 --> 00:39:58,539
and we get to spend some of that time together,

959
00:39:58,539 --> 00:39:59,539
but there's something.

960
00:39:59,539 --> 00:40:02,139
Something about working out that I've learned, Bart, over the years is that when you have

961
00:40:02,139 --> 00:40:08,219
a partner to work out with, it's so much easier to work out.

962
00:40:08,219 --> 00:40:09,219
Is it not?

963
00:40:09,219 --> 00:40:13,159
Listen, you try to work out by yourself, and there's like 105 other things that come up

964
00:40:13,159 --> 00:40:16,499
that you could do instead of working out.

965
00:40:16,499 --> 00:40:18,499
Come on.

966
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:29,179
But when you have an accountability partner, somebody that's waiting for you at the location

967
00:40:29,179 --> 00:40:31,419
where you're going to work out.

968
00:40:31,419 --> 00:40:32,419
They keep you accountable.

969
00:40:32,419 --> 00:40:37,339
Listen, we understand that in the physical workout, but I'm saying this morning that

970
00:40:37,339 --> 00:40:41,139
we've got to keep each other accountable spiritually.

971
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:43,219
Who are we running with?

972
00:40:43,219 --> 00:40:45,499
With them, the Bible says.

973
00:40:45,499 --> 00:40:49,259
There's some other people that are seeking to please God with their lives that want to,

974
00:40:49,259 --> 00:40:54,299
as I've been preaching here for weeks now, they want to be a good soldier.

975
00:40:54,299 --> 00:40:57,119
They don't want to be content with simply being a soldier.

976
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:02,559
They want to be a good soldier of Jesus Christ, and as we get ourselves into a position where

977
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:06,839
we are running with them and we're building them up and they're building us up and we're

978
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:13,039
keeping each other accountable, we're going forward for the cause of Christ.

979
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:18,079
Notice with me, not only what the disciplined soldier flees and follows, but number three,

980
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:22,919
if you're taking notes this morning, consider what the disciplined soldier avoids.

981
00:41:22,959 --> 00:41:27,959
In verse 23, the Bible says, but foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they

982
00:41:27,959 --> 00:41:29,559
do gender strifes.

983
00:41:29,559 --> 00:41:34,839
Now, it's kind of interesting, he specifically mentions about foolish and unlearned questions

984
00:41:34,839 --> 00:41:39,519
avoiding and that's the context and that's what we'll focus on, but understand there's

985
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:42,679
some things that we just need to avoid that become distractions.

986
00:41:42,679 --> 00:41:47,319
These foolish and unlearned questions that the instruction is given here with regard

987
00:41:47,319 --> 00:41:53,239
to avoiding these foolish and unlearned questions, you understand that the Bible says, why to

988
00:41:53,239 --> 00:41:54,239
do that?

989
00:41:54,239 --> 00:41:55,239
Because they do gender strifes.

990
00:41:55,239 --> 00:42:01,239
Here's the danger, as a pastor, I say this very transparently this morning, here's the

991
00:42:01,239 --> 00:42:06,399
danger sometimes with this idea of these foolish and unlearned questions is that if I don't

992
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:12,519
answer the question, then somebody thinks that I just don't know the answer.

993
00:42:12,519 --> 00:42:15,439
It's not always about knowing the answer.

994
00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:19,519
Sometimes it's just about having wisdom on what needs to be answered and what doesn't

995
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:22,159
need to be answered.

996
00:42:22,159 --> 00:42:23,999
By the way, we don't know everything.

997
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:28,679
You don't know everything, I don't know everything, only God knows everything, but the reality

998
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:33,719
is that there are times in which people will ask you questions that are foolish and unlearned

999
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:35,719
questions and you need to avoid them.

1000
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:36,719
Why?

1001
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:39,639
It's going to take you down a rabbit trail, it's going to take you down a distracted path

1002
00:42:39,639 --> 00:42:43,359
that you don't need to go down, plus it genders strife.

1003
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:44,359
What does it mean?

1004
00:42:44,359 --> 00:42:45,359
It's reed contention.

1005
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:50,559
That's what it means, it's the idea of the word or the phrase.

1006
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:55,279
So I think about this thought this morning of what the disciplined soldier avoids.

1007
00:42:55,279 --> 00:42:58,959
Someone asked me years ago, is God able to do all things?

1008
00:42:58,959 --> 00:43:00,999
Yes, he is.

1009
00:43:00,999 --> 00:43:01,999
Does he know all things?

1010
00:43:01,999 --> 00:43:02,999
Yes, he does.

1011
00:43:02,999 --> 00:43:03,999
Can he make all things?

1012
00:43:03,999 --> 00:43:07,799
And I just went through this series of questions and yes, and so does he have all power?

1013
00:43:07,799 --> 00:43:08,799
Yes, he has all power.

1014
00:43:08,799 --> 00:43:11,879
Okay, so can God make something so big that he can't?

1015
00:43:11,879 --> 00:43:14,339
Come on, that's just nonsense.

1016
00:43:14,339 --> 00:43:21,699
It's foolish, it's unlearned, it genders strife.

1017
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:24,859
Do you know this morning there's some things that God just doesn't want us to know?

1018
00:43:24,859 --> 00:43:29,899
You say, well, I don't like that, I want to know.

1019
00:43:29,899 --> 00:43:37,479
Some things God just didn't tell us and that's okay, he's God.

1020
00:43:37,479 --> 00:43:42,139
Notice in 1 Timothy, I'm going to read a few verses quickly, this is a thought that recurs

1021
00:43:42,139 --> 00:43:46,539
throughout 1 and 2 Timothy with regard to avoiding these foolish and unlearned questions.

1022
00:43:46,539 --> 00:43:51,459
Turn back to 1 Timothy 1, in verse number four, I mean, he hits it right from the beginning.

1023
00:43:51,459 --> 00:43:55,139
Remember, he's in Ephesus, Timothy is there in Ephesus as the pastor, he's dealing with

1024
00:43:55,139 --> 00:43:59,459
some false teachers and various things that are going on and so Paul is encouraging him

1025
00:43:59,459 --> 00:44:00,459
to do what?

1026
00:44:00,459 --> 00:44:01,459
To continue.

1027
00:44:01,459 --> 00:44:02,459
That's our theme for this year.

1028
00:44:02,459 --> 00:44:06,179
Listen, though you're dealing with all of these things in Ephesus, continue, God has

1029
00:44:06,179 --> 00:44:07,179
you there.

1030
00:44:07,179 --> 00:44:10,579
He has you there for a purpose and for a reason, you need to fight the good fight.

1031
00:44:10,579 --> 00:44:14,699
Notice in verse number four of chapter one of 1 Timothy, neither give heed to fables

1032
00:44:14,699 --> 00:44:20,459
and endless genealogies which minister questions rather than godly edifying which is in faith,

1033
00:44:20,459 --> 00:44:21,459
so do.

1034
00:44:21,459 --> 00:44:23,619
So don't give heed to these things.

1035
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:28,419
He talks about in verse number six how that they have turned aside, they've swerved and

1036
00:44:28,419 --> 00:44:34,099
have turned aside into vain jangling, useless talk is literally what the phrase means and

1037
00:44:34,099 --> 00:44:39,219
so we find that he tells them there in chapter number one, notice in chapter four of 1 Timothy

1038
00:44:39,379 --> 00:44:42,499
in verse number seven he says, but refuse.

1039
00:44:42,499 --> 00:44:48,299
We've said in chapter two of 2 Timothy he says to avoid, here in 1 Timothy four and

1040
00:44:48,299 --> 00:44:55,179
seven it says, but refuse profane and old wives' fables and exercise thyself rather

1041
00:44:55,179 --> 00:44:57,419
unto godliness.

1042
00:44:57,419 --> 00:45:01,739
There's some things that people would bring up and he says, listen, refuse that, chapter

1043
00:45:01,739 --> 00:45:05,019
six in verses three through five.

1044
00:45:05,019 --> 00:45:09,179
Notice what he says, if any man teach otherwise and consent not to wholesome words, even the

1045
00:45:09,179 --> 00:45:13,019
words of our Lord Jesus Christ and to the doctrine which is according to godliness,

1046
00:45:13,019 --> 00:45:17,939
he is proud knowing nothing but doting about questions and strifes of words whereof cometh

1047
00:45:17,939 --> 00:45:24,059
envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings, perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds and destitute

1048
00:45:24,059 --> 00:45:31,179
of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness, notice what he says, from such withdraw thyself.

1049
00:45:31,179 --> 00:45:36,899
Chapter six in verse 20, O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding

1050
00:45:36,899 --> 00:45:42,019
profane and vain babblings and oppositions of science, falsely so called, which some

1051
00:45:42,019 --> 00:45:47,599
professing have erred concerning the faith, grace be with thee, amen.

1052
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:52,219
We live in a time in which we need to have great wisdom.

1053
00:45:52,219 --> 00:45:57,139
We have people that are extremely educated, that have PhDs in all sorts of disciplines

1054
00:45:57,139 --> 00:46:01,899
and they sometimes try to carry around their accolades and make you feel like you don't

1055
00:46:01,899 --> 00:46:02,899
know.

1056
00:46:02,899 --> 00:46:07,019
You know God's word, professing themselves to be wise.

1057
00:46:07,019 --> 00:46:12,619
They became fools of this in 2 Peter chapter number three, they were willingly ignorant

1058
00:46:12,619 --> 00:46:13,619
of.

1059
00:46:13,619 --> 00:46:19,299
Listen, they want to deny the truth of who God is because they don't want to be accountable

1060
00:46:19,299 --> 00:46:21,299
to God.

1061
00:46:21,299 --> 00:46:26,259
So there's some things that we need to avoid, some things we need to avoid.

1062
00:46:26,259 --> 00:46:30,059
We notice about a good soldier, he's disciplined.

1063
00:46:30,059 --> 00:46:33,099
Because he has discipline, he flees.

1064
00:46:33,099 --> 00:46:35,939
Because he has discipline, he follows.

1065
00:46:35,939 --> 00:46:38,539
Because he has discipline, he avoids.

1066
00:46:38,539 --> 00:46:46,419
So why is it that a soldier desiring to be a good soldier would live a disciplined life?

1067
00:46:46,419 --> 00:46:50,979
Well, we said in the beginning in 2 Timothy 2 and verse number five, it says, if any man

1068
00:46:50,979 --> 00:46:56,259
also strives for masteries, yet is he not crowned except he strive lawfully.

1069
00:46:56,259 --> 00:47:00,539
Those in the Ishmaelian games, they would stand before the judges, if you will, and

1070
00:47:00,539 --> 00:47:04,139
as they would stand there, in fact, even call a behemoth seat.

1071
00:47:04,139 --> 00:47:09,179
They would stand there and they would receive a reward based on how they ran their race,

1072
00:47:09,179 --> 00:47:14,099
how they competed in their particular discipline, and they would receive a crown that was corruptible,

1073
00:47:14,099 --> 00:47:19,539
but we, as we found in 1 Corinthians 9, an incorruptible, and so why is it that we would

1074
00:47:19,539 --> 00:47:25,259
be challenged this morning to live a disciplined life so that we would be known as being a

1075
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:26,579
good soldier?

1076
00:47:26,579 --> 00:47:28,899
Because the Lord is coming back.

1077
00:47:28,899 --> 00:47:33,579
And because one day, each and every one of us are going to stand before God Almighty.

1078
00:47:33,579 --> 00:47:38,979
Listen, I'm thankful this morning that I will not stand at the great white throne judgment.

1079
00:47:38,979 --> 00:47:42,619
In Revelation chapter 20, God paints the picture of that great white throne judgment.

1080
00:47:42,619 --> 00:47:43,739
That's for lost people.

1081
00:47:43,739 --> 00:47:48,339
I will not be there because I've trusted Jesus Christ as my personal Savior, and if you've

1082
00:47:48,339 --> 00:47:52,059
been saved this morning by the grace of God, you will not be at the great white throne

1083
00:47:52,059 --> 00:47:55,419
judgment either as a subject of that judgment.

1084
00:47:55,419 --> 00:47:57,699
I actually believe that we'll be there.

1085
00:47:57,699 --> 00:48:00,099
We'll see it.

1086
00:48:00,099 --> 00:48:03,459
That's why right after, in chapter 21, it says He's going to wipe away all tears.

1087
00:48:03,459 --> 00:48:08,699
There's a great connection there.

1088
00:48:08,699 --> 00:48:11,779
If that doesn't motivate you to tell your loved ones about Jesus, I don't know what

1089
00:48:11,779 --> 00:48:16,499
would, to tell your neighbors, your coworkers, even your enemies.

1090
00:48:16,499 --> 00:48:22,899
I don't want the greatest enemy to have to stand at the great white throne judgment and

1091
00:48:22,899 --> 00:48:25,839
be sent to the lake of fire forever.

1092
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:31,059
But as Christians, we're going to stand at the bema seat, the judgment seat of Christ.

1093
00:48:31,059 --> 00:48:38,299
Our works, what we did for Christ, wood, hay stubble, gold, silver, precious stone.

1094
00:48:38,299 --> 00:48:41,579
Burned up or not.

1095
00:48:41,579 --> 00:48:43,259
Receive a crown.

1096
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:47,739
Paul mentions in 2 Timothy 4 and verse 9 that he knew there was a crown of righteousness

1097
00:48:47,739 --> 00:48:48,739
that was waiting for him.

1098
00:48:48,739 --> 00:48:51,419
Listen, we're going to stand before Christ one day.

1099
00:48:51,419 --> 00:48:53,979
We're going to have some discipline.

1100
00:48:53,979 --> 00:48:57,099
You say, but those things that, those are enjoyable things.

1101
00:48:57,099 --> 00:48:59,859
Listen, if they're not pleasing God, we ought to flee them.

1102
00:48:59,859 --> 00:49:06,979
We ought to follow after righteousness, faith, charity, peace.

1103
00:49:06,979 --> 00:49:07,979
Why?

1104
00:49:07,979 --> 00:49:10,500
Because there's got to be discipline in our lives.

1105
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:14,859
If we're going to be a good soldier, we've got to be disciplined.

1106
00:49:14,859 --> 00:49:19,099
Because one day I'm going to stand before him and so are you.

1107
00:49:19,099 --> 00:49:24,899
And I want to hear, well done, thou good and faithful servant.

1108
00:49:24,899 --> 00:49:29,380
I heard somebody say this recently, you're only going to hear well done if you have done

1109
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:33,099
well.

1110
00:49:33,099 --> 00:49:36,820
So deep, but so true.

1111
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:39,659
This morning, a good soldier is disciplined.

1112
00:49:39,659 --> 00:49:40,659
Let's pray.

1113
00:49:40,659 --> 00:49:41,659
Father, we love you.

1114
00:49:41,659 --> 00:49:42,659
We thank you for loving us.

1115
00:49:42,659 --> 00:49:43,659
Thank you for your word.

1116
00:49:43,659 --> 00:49:53,820
I pray, God, that you would help us to truly have that goal to be a good soldier.

1117
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:59,380
Not to be content with simply being a soldier, but to be a good soldier of Jesus Christ.

1118
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:07,280
I pray, God, that you would help us to live lives that are marked by discipline.

1119
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:11,020
Help us to understand there are some things that we need to flee, some things we need

1120
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:14,780
to follow, some things we need to avoid.

1121
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:19,140
I pray that you'd move and work in hearts and lives, that you'd help us to be doers

1122
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:23,540
of the Word and not hearers only.

1123
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:26,140
Well thank you for what you'll do, for it's in Christ's name we pray.

1124
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:27,700
Would you stand with me?

1125
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:30,900
Eyes are bowed, eyes are closed.

1126
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:33,780
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano this morning and as she does, the altar is

1127
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:35,140
open.

1128
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:38,940
Perhaps God used His Word this morning to speak to you in a specific way.

1129
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:44,060
Maybe there's some things that you need to flee, you need to follow, you need to avoid,

1130
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:47,620
you need to have some discipline.

1131
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:50,260
This morning, as Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
