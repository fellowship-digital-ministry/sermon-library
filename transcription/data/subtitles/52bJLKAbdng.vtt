WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.920
Number two, as we continue our study here

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.719
on Sunday mornings through 1st and 2nd Timothy,

00:00:05.719 --> 00:00:07.539
and we've spent a few weeks here

00:00:07.539 --> 00:00:09.119
in 2nd Timothy chapter number two

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:12.399
dealing with the subject matter of a good soldier.

00:00:12.399 --> 00:00:13.479
And several weeks ago,

00:00:13.479 --> 00:00:16.100
when we first entered into the second chapter,

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.559
I mentioned that the entirety of 2nd Timothy chapter two

00:00:19.559 --> 00:00:21.340
really deals with the subject matter,

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.120
the thought of what it means to be a good soldier.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.479
I've said this repeatedly,

00:00:26.479 --> 00:00:29.079
this is the fourth lesson from 2nd Timothy chapter two,

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:32.200
the fourth message, and I've said this repeatedly,

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.880
I do not want to, I hope that you do not want to

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.639
simply be content with being a soldier.

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:41.799
I wanna be a good soldier.

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:44.000
The Bible says here in our text of Scripture

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.119
in verse number three of 2nd Timothy two,

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:48.779
thou therefore endure hardness

00:00:48.779 --> 00:00:51.520
as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.880
No man that woreth and tangleth himself

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.040
with the affairs of this life,

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:01.080
that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:03.919
If a man also strive for masteries,

00:01:03.919 --> 00:01:07.580
yet is he not crowned except he strive lawfully.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:08.720
Over the last three weeks,

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.800
we've looked at verses three and four,

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.500
and we've dealt with the subject matter

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.800
of these characteristics, these attributes, if you will,

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.959
of what it is to be a good soldier.

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:20.800
What makes a soldier a good soldier?

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.639
We could ask the question this morning,

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:26.160
what is the purpose of examining these characteristics?

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.480
Why is it that God has provided to us

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.760
in 2nd Timothy two, these five characteristics

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.339
or attributes of a good soldier?

00:01:35.339 --> 00:01:36.239
Why do we study it?

00:01:36.239 --> 00:01:37.800
Why are we spending so much time on it?

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.839
Well, I believe that as we study

00:01:39.839 --> 00:01:42.699
these particular characteristics and attributes

00:01:42.699 --> 00:01:45.319
of a good soldier, that it should lead us

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:49.120
to an honest examination of our own lives.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.080
In other words, we should examine our lives

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.959
with honesty and humility, and we must determine,

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:57.959
are these attributes present in my life?

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:00.300
In other words, if God were to look at your life,

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.599
if he were to look at my life,

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:04.559
would he say they're a soldier,

00:02:04.559 --> 00:02:07.279
or would he say they're a good soldier?

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:08.880
We said this from verse number three,

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.559
that a good soldier endures hardness.

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:12.880
There's going to be opposition.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.479
There's going to be difficulty.

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:16.520
You attempt to do anything for God,

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.039
and you can find that, yes, there might be an open door,

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:22.240
as Paul said, but there are many adversaries.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.759
We find it in the Old Testament.

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:24.759
We find it in the New Testament.

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:27.960
We find through the pages of church history

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.860
that any individual that ever attempted to do anything

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.240
for the cause of Christ has faced opposition.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.160
But Jesus said this, if they hate you,

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.320
remember they hated me first, amen?

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.960
And the reality is that we serve a God

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.960
who is worthy of our service, and not just when it's easy.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.320
He endures hardness.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.960
I said this a couple of weeks ago.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.500
Some want to be a soldier, but they don't want the combat.

00:02:55.839 --> 00:03:00.339
The reality is that a soldier is trained for the combat,

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:03.360
and we're to endure hardness.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.000
Listen, if you don't think we're living in the last days,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.160
your head is in the sand.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.259
I'm being honest with you.

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:10.679
We're going to get to it in a couple of weeks

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:12.240
in 2 Timothy chapter three,

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.839
and we're going to see all of the truth

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:17.479
that God gives us the characteristics of the last days.

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:19.800
I'm telling you, we're living in the last of the last days.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.160
Jesus is coming soon,

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.000
and we need to endure hardness as a good soldier.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.720
We find that the second attribute that we discussed

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:27.800
in verse number four

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.199
was that a good soldier avoids distractions.

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:33.660
You understand that there are many distractions in life.

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.399
There are things that the enemy will bring in your life

00:03:36.399 --> 00:03:39.000
and in my life and in our lives corporately as a church

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
to distract us from doing what God has instructed us to do.

00:03:44.399 --> 00:03:46.440
It's so easy to become distracted.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.600
I've used illustrations on distraction,

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.800
and we've understood.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.220
Listen, if we just let somebody open that back door

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.479
and walk in this morning,

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:56.320
half of you will be distracted

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.080
as soon as they walk through the door.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.279
Let somebody near you open a piece of candy,

00:04:00.279 --> 00:04:01.520
and you're going to be distracted.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.000
I used that illustration,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.240
and someone came to me and said,

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.759
you know, we were at a funeral,

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:07.080
and as we're at the funeral,

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.080
my wife tried to open a piece of candy,

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.339
and they tried to, and my wife reminded me.

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:14.160
Don't you remember what pastor said?

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.059
And the reality is that, listen,

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.019
we're so easily distracted, so easily distracted.

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.339
I said this, no longer can God's people

00:04:24.339 --> 00:04:25.859
be asleep at the wheel.

00:04:25.859 --> 00:04:28.299
No longer can fathers and husbands,

00:04:28.299 --> 00:04:31.739
can mothers and wives, can God's people

00:04:31.739 --> 00:04:35.160
be distracted by the things of this world.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.940
We said this from verse number four,

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.660
the third attribute that we see of a good soldier

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.600
is that a good soldier seeks to please his master.

00:04:43.459 --> 00:04:45.799
I concluded that message by encouraging

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.119
each and every one of us to seek,

00:04:48.119 --> 00:04:51.480
to truly examine our lives, to understand,

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.760
am I doing that which is pleasing in the sight of my God?

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.440
The Bible says in Ephesians five

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.880
that we're to prove what is acceptable unto the Lord,

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.799
not what is acceptable to society,

00:05:02.799 --> 00:05:05.220
not what is acceptable to your spouse or to someone else,

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.480
but what is acceptable unto the Lord.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.320
You know why?

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.119
You're not going to stand before society.

00:05:10.119 --> 00:05:11.959
You're not going to stand before your employer.

00:05:11.959 --> 00:05:13.440
You're not going to stand before your spouse.

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.119
You're not going to stand before your pastor.

00:05:15.119 --> 00:05:17.500
You're going to stand before your savior.

00:05:18.799 --> 00:05:22.359
And we must prove what is acceptable unto the Lord.

00:05:22.359 --> 00:05:25.200
This morning as we move into verse number five,

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.500
we find that the Bible says, I've read it a moment ago,

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:28.339
but I'll read it again,

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:30.700
if a man also strive for masteries,

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:34.200
is he not crowned except he strive lawfully?

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.920
If I could boil this down to an attribute

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.920
or a characteristic that I've identified

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.660
as a good soldier from this text of scripture,

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:46.140
I would say it this way, a good soldier is disciplined.

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:47.940
A good soldier is disciplined.

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:49.500
I think about a soldier,

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.660
I think about someone in the armed forces,

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.820
and I know that not every branch of our US military

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:59.420
refers to their members of that branch as being soldiers,

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:03.299
but if we use the word very generically this morning,

00:06:03.299 --> 00:06:07.359
I think that soldiers typically have in our minds,

00:06:07.359 --> 00:06:09.980
we think about a soldier being disciplined.

00:06:10.019 --> 00:06:12.579
If we're gonna be a good soldier of the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:06:12.579 --> 00:06:14.619
we need to have some discipline in our lives,

00:06:14.619 --> 00:06:17.540
some temperance, if you will, some self-control,

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:18.700
and we need to be disciplined.

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:20.940
We find that here in 2 Timothy chapter two

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.260
in verse number five, the apostle Paul,

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.000
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.940
will use an illustration that is quite similar

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.739
to the one used in 1 Corinthians nine.

00:06:29.739 --> 00:06:31.899
In fact, in just a moment, we'll turn there

00:06:31.899 --> 00:06:33.820
and look at that portion of scripture.

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:35.220
But we find in verse number five,

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:38.739
notice he says, if a man also strive for masteries,

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:41.980
that word or that phrase that is used there,

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:44.140
there's a connection, an illustration,

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:47.260
an example, if you will, that the apostle Paul is using

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.579
that these original readers,

00:06:49.579 --> 00:06:52.380
Timothy, of course, the book being written to him,

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:54.619
but obviously as those in Ephesus

00:06:54.619 --> 00:06:58.140
and throughout the ages of the church history

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:00.420
having this book of 2 Timothy,

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.260
we find that immediately they would understand

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:07.380
and easily be able to make the connection of this phrase,

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:09.059
also strive for masteries.

00:07:09.059 --> 00:07:12.540
It was those that would participate in the Isthmian games.

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:14.500
They're striving for masteries.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.140
They would be familiar with that.

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:18.619
We often think about our Olympic games

00:07:18.619 --> 00:07:21.700
that we have here in our society today.

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:23.660
And of course, they're held all over the world.

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:26.299
And we just had Summer Olympics this past summer.

00:07:26.299 --> 00:07:28.980
And you find that he uses that phrase,

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:30.140
strive for masteries.

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:32.959
Understand that those that are participating

00:07:32.959 --> 00:07:34.100
in the Isthmian games,

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:36.380
those that are striving for masteries,

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:38.980
they do so with a desire.

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:40.260
What's the desire?

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:41.100
To be crowned.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.540
Is it not true?

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:46.339
I mean, the discipline that an athlete has,

00:07:46.339 --> 00:07:49.140
the discipline that they have to train

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:51.299
and to change their diet

00:07:51.299 --> 00:07:52.880
and to do all the things that they do,

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:53.940
they do all of that.

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:55.500
They have all of that discipline.

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:57.140
They cannot take a day off.

00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:59.100
They do not get distracted.

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:00.519
They have that discipline.

00:08:00.519 --> 00:08:01.359
Why?

00:08:01.359 --> 00:08:03.720
Because they desire to be crowned.

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.859
But you understand that those

00:08:06.859 --> 00:08:09.079
that would have the desire to be crowned,

00:08:09.079 --> 00:08:10.959
they could only be crowned

00:08:10.959 --> 00:08:13.119
if they competed lawfully.

00:08:13.119 --> 00:08:15.660
In other words, if they followed the rules

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:19.179
that were established by those in charge.

00:08:21.119 --> 00:08:22.720
The Bible says in verse number five,

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.679
and a man also strive for masteries,

00:08:24.679 --> 00:08:29.679
yet is he not crowned except he strive lawfully.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.459
I would say to you this morning

00:08:31.459 --> 00:08:32.440
that in like manner,

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:33.559
a good soldier,

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:35.840
as we see the introduction in verse number three

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:37.960
of being a good soldier of Jesus Christ,

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:40.280
that a good soldier must adhere to,

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:44.200
must abide by the guidelines provided

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.919
within the word of God.

00:08:45.919 --> 00:08:48.159
I said of those competing in the Isthmian games

00:08:48.159 --> 00:08:50.080
that they had to follow the rules

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.719
established by those in charge.

00:08:51.719 --> 00:08:53.440
Listen, it's important for God's people

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:56.599
to understand that God is in charge.

00:08:56.599 --> 00:08:58.320
It's important that once again,

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:01.440
we have a vision of God like Isaiah had

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:02.359
in Isaiah six,

00:09:02.359 --> 00:09:04.479
that we see God in his rightful place,

00:09:04.479 --> 00:09:06.239
high, holy, and lifted up,

00:09:06.239 --> 00:09:08.200
and we understand that I'm not in charge,

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.320
that you're not in charge,

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:12.280
but that God is in charge.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.719
Too often, God's people are trying to run around

00:09:14.719 --> 00:09:17.340
and live their life as if they're the ones in charge,

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:19.599
as if they're the ones that make the rules,

00:09:19.599 --> 00:09:22.960
but the reality is that God is the one that created you.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.659
God is the one that gave you breath,

00:09:24.659 --> 00:09:25.820
that gives you life,

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:30.039
and God is the one that establishes the guidelines,

00:09:30.039 --> 00:09:35.039
the rules of living life that's pleasing to him.

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:39.320
Sometimes people have a problem with that

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.760
in our society today.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:42.000
They say, no, I want to be my own man.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.679
I want to be my own ruler.

00:09:43.679 --> 00:09:44.979
I want to, listen,

00:09:44.979 --> 00:09:47.760
we're going to stand before Christ one day.

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:50.200
I'm so thankful that God gave us a Bible

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:53.320
where he revealed to us in the pages of this precious book

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:54.559
the things that please him

00:09:54.559 --> 00:09:56.559
and the things that displease him.

00:09:56.559 --> 00:09:57.559
What a joy.

00:09:57.559 --> 00:10:00.359
So we think about the subject of.

00:10:00.359 --> 00:10:03.659
discipline, the reality is that there's a temptation

00:10:03.659 --> 00:10:05.679
that every person faces.

00:10:05.679 --> 00:10:08.139
There's a temptation to cut corners.

00:10:08.139 --> 00:10:10.379
There's a temptation to take a shortcut,

00:10:10.379 --> 00:10:14.599
to take a path of least resistance, if you will,

00:10:14.599 --> 00:10:16.979
to take the easy way.

00:10:16.979 --> 00:10:18.459
Can I tell you?

00:10:18.459 --> 00:10:20.739
The good soldier is disciplined.

00:10:20.739 --> 00:10:22.859
The good soldier's not looking for the easy way.

00:10:22.859 --> 00:10:25.019
The good soldier's not looking to take a shortcut.

00:10:25.019 --> 00:10:28.699
The good soldier's not looking to cut corners.

00:10:29.139 --> 00:10:33.719
The good soldier is disciplined to follow the instruction

00:10:33.719 --> 00:10:37.739
that the master has given us in his word.

00:10:37.739 --> 00:10:40.199
Notice in 1 Corinthians 9, and then we'll come back

00:10:40.199 --> 00:10:43.219
to 2 Timothy, because we're gonna see in 2 Timothy

00:10:43.219 --> 00:10:46.139
later on how this is illustrated, and we'll deal with that.

00:10:46.139 --> 00:10:50.179
But turn over just briefly to 1 Corinthians 9, if you will.

00:10:50.179 --> 00:10:51.819
I mentioned a moment ago that Paul,

00:10:51.819 --> 00:10:55.459
here in 1 Corinthians 9, uses this similar illustration

00:10:55.459 --> 00:10:59.059
of what we just read in 2 Timothy 2 in verse five.

00:10:59.059 --> 00:11:00.699
In 1 Corinthians chapter number nine,

00:11:00.699 --> 00:11:04.539
we find that the apostle Paul is speaking about his own life

00:11:04.539 --> 00:11:06.879
and what he does for the gospel's sake,

00:11:06.879 --> 00:11:09.779
and I see a man that is surrendered,

00:11:09.779 --> 00:11:11.379
that is yielded to the Lord.

00:11:11.379 --> 00:11:13.899
I see a man that God used in a great way.

00:11:13.899 --> 00:11:16.699
And he says in verse 23, and this I do for the gospel's sake

00:11:16.699 --> 00:11:19.279
that I might be partaker thereof with you.

00:11:19.279 --> 00:11:21.939
Know ye not that they which run in a race run all,

00:11:21.939 --> 00:11:24.139
but one receiveth the prize.

00:11:24.139 --> 00:11:24.979
So what does he tell them?

00:11:25.499 --> 00:11:26.779
So run that ye may obtain.

00:11:29.059 --> 00:11:32.219
Notice in verse 25, and every man that striveth

00:11:32.219 --> 00:11:36.619
for the mastery, remember we saw in 2 Timothy 2 five

00:11:36.619 --> 00:11:38.459
that they that strive for masteries,

00:11:38.459 --> 00:11:41.219
we see it here in verse 25, and every man that striveth

00:11:41.219 --> 00:11:42.699
for the mastery, notice what it says,

00:11:42.699 --> 00:11:46.079
is temperate in all things.

00:11:46.079 --> 00:11:49.059
Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown.

00:11:49.059 --> 00:11:51.179
Do you know what the crown was that they received today

00:11:51.179 --> 00:11:52.299
in our Olympic games?

00:11:52.299 --> 00:11:54.839
They received gold, silver, or bronze.

00:11:55.679 --> 00:11:59.119
But here it was really just a wreath that they would receive

00:11:59.119 --> 00:12:03.359
and that wreath would obviously very quickly dry up,

00:12:03.359 --> 00:12:07.859
but they worked to receive, they were striving,

00:12:07.859 --> 00:12:11.179
they were competing so that they could receive a crown,

00:12:11.179 --> 00:12:14.039
but they would receive one that was corruptible.

00:12:14.039 --> 00:12:19.039
But notice what the Bible says, but we an incorruptible.

00:12:19.319 --> 00:12:21.199
We an incorruptible.

00:12:21.199 --> 00:12:24.359
Notice in verse 26, therefore so run.

00:12:24.879 --> 00:12:27.199
Not as uncertainly, so fight I, not as one that beat

00:12:27.199 --> 00:12:29.119
at the air, but I keep under my body and bring it

00:12:29.119 --> 00:12:32.639
into subjection, lest that by any means when I have preached

00:12:32.639 --> 00:12:35.439
to others, I myself should be a castaway.

00:12:35.439 --> 00:12:39.519
That word means to be rejected, useless, or of no value.

00:12:39.519 --> 00:12:44.519
No, the Apostle Paul says I understand that as a runner,

00:12:44.639 --> 00:12:48.639
as an athlete, he's using that illustration,

00:12:48.639 --> 00:12:51.479
but then here in 2 Timothy, even applying that

00:12:51.519 --> 00:12:56.519
to the good soldier, that we must strive lawfully.

00:12:56.519 --> 00:12:58.879
We must follow the truth that God has given to us

00:12:58.879 --> 00:13:00.279
within his word.

00:13:00.279 --> 00:13:04.479
We must do God's work God's way.

00:13:04.479 --> 00:13:05.879
Does that make sense this morning?

00:13:05.879 --> 00:13:10.879
Listen, there's no substitute for how we approach God,

00:13:11.719 --> 00:13:15.379
for how we serve God, he's given us truth in his word.

00:13:15.379 --> 00:13:17.719
We do not employ the methods of the world,

00:13:17.719 --> 00:13:21.559
we seek to use the methods that God has given to us

00:13:21.559 --> 00:13:22.599
in his word.

00:13:22.599 --> 00:13:24.839
We find that today, in fact, I had a conversation

00:13:24.839 --> 00:13:27.439
not long ago with an evangelist, actually,

00:13:27.439 --> 00:13:29.799
Kimberly's dad, Brother Sommerdorf, and he's been here

00:13:29.799 --> 00:13:31.959
and he's preached before, and we had this conversation

00:13:31.959 --> 00:13:34.039
several months ago, and he said, unfortunately,

00:13:34.039 --> 00:13:36.639
some of our churches seem to have followed

00:13:36.639 --> 00:13:40.599
a corporate mentality of a CEO perspective.

00:13:40.599 --> 00:13:43.699
And the reality is that the church is not a corporation,

00:13:43.699 --> 00:13:48.219
the church is not a business to be run by the worldly ideas

00:13:48.219 --> 00:13:51.099
that they have for running their businesses,

00:13:51.099 --> 00:13:54.699
for their organizations, no, the church is the house

00:13:54.699 --> 00:13:58.899
of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.

00:13:58.899 --> 00:14:01.619
And we find that God has given us in his word

00:14:01.619 --> 00:14:04.579
how we are to function, how we are to operate

00:14:04.579 --> 00:14:07.499
as the people of God, as the church of God.

00:14:07.499 --> 00:14:10.699
I said this in Sunday school, the church is not the building

00:14:10.699 --> 00:14:12.379
the church is the people.

00:14:12.379 --> 00:14:14.899
The church is the people, and so how do we as a church,

00:14:14.899 --> 00:14:16.859
how do we function, how do we operate?

00:14:16.859 --> 00:14:20.059
We must do God's work God's way.

00:14:20.059 --> 00:14:22.379
There is a way to approach God,

00:14:22.379 --> 00:14:24.259
and he's laid it out in his word.

00:14:24.259 --> 00:14:26.000
You know, we don't just come to God on our terms,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.039
we come to God on his terms, amen.

00:14:30.299 --> 00:14:32.779
Contrary to what people say, contrary to what you've seen

00:14:32.779 --> 00:14:35.939
in the news in recent days, in recent weeks,

00:14:35.939 --> 00:14:40.659
of those that are in high positions of various denominations,

00:14:40.659 --> 00:14:43.259
listen, all roads don't lead to God.

00:14:44.739 --> 00:14:49.739
Jesus Christ said, I am the way, the truth, and the life.

00:14:50.459 --> 00:14:53.500
No man cometh unto the father but by me.

00:14:54.819 --> 00:14:59.819
Let God be true, and every man a liar, amen.

00:15:00.339 --> 00:15:02.219
Peter stood up and said as he preached

00:15:02.219 --> 00:15:04.219
on the day of Pentecost, neither is there salvation

00:15:04.219 --> 00:15:06.319
to any other, there is no other name under heaven

00:15:06.319 --> 00:15:10.139
given among men whereby we must be saved.

00:15:11.579 --> 00:15:13.979
The devil's a liar.

00:15:15.979 --> 00:15:18.699
I believe that many of the religions and world religions

00:15:18.699 --> 00:15:23.379
that are out there today are from the lies of the devil,

00:15:23.379 --> 00:15:26.739
to deceive mankind to think that they can come to God

00:15:26.739 --> 00:15:29.339
on their own way, their own approach.

00:15:29.339 --> 00:15:30.779
No, God said that there's one way.

00:15:30.779 --> 00:15:33.239
What happened with Cain and Abel?

00:15:33.239 --> 00:15:34.819
Do you remember?

00:15:34.819 --> 00:15:36.059
There was an offering that was brought

00:15:36.059 --> 00:15:37.859
that was a blood offering, and God accepted it,

00:15:37.859 --> 00:15:39.500
but then there was an offering that was brought by Cain

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:41.979
that was not a blood offering, and you know what God said?

00:15:41.979 --> 00:15:43.619
He said, why is thy countenance fallen?

00:15:43.619 --> 00:15:44.839
Why was his countenance fallen?

00:15:44.839 --> 00:15:47.000
Because God didn't accept his offering.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.539
Why, because it wasn't the right kind of offering.

00:15:50.679 --> 00:15:53.179
You had to approach God on his terms.

00:15:53.179 --> 00:15:54.539
Blood was necessary.

00:15:56.299 --> 00:16:00.299
But then God said this, if thou doest well,

00:16:00.299 --> 00:16:02.459
shalt thou not be accepted.

00:16:02.459 --> 00:16:04.979
But if not, then sin lieth at the door.

00:16:04.979 --> 00:16:05.979
You know what God's telling us there?

00:16:05.979 --> 00:16:08.019
Listen, you can try to come your own way,

00:16:08.019 --> 00:16:11.939
but you must, as you come, you must come my way.

00:16:11.939 --> 00:16:14.779
And if you come my way, you'll be accepted.

00:16:14.779 --> 00:16:17.259
But if not, sin lieth at the door.

00:16:19.139 --> 00:16:20.459
We serve a great God.

00:16:21.779 --> 00:16:25.859
David learned that God's work must be done God's way.

00:16:25.859 --> 00:16:28.339
He tried to move the ark.

00:16:29.219 --> 00:16:33.139
God had given prescription even in the book of Exodus

00:16:33.139 --> 00:16:36.139
and throughout the Pentateuch with regard to how the ark

00:16:36.139 --> 00:16:37.459
was not only to be constructed,

00:16:37.459 --> 00:16:39.219
but how the ark was to be moved

00:16:39.219 --> 00:16:41.419
and what the ark signified

00:16:41.419 --> 00:16:43.939
and what a precious truth and study.

00:16:43.939 --> 00:16:47.539
And we find that the ark was taken during battle.

00:16:47.539 --> 00:16:48.459
Why, what happened?

00:16:48.459 --> 00:16:49.779
Well, the children of Israel

00:16:49.779 --> 00:16:52.459
were fighting against the Philistines and they were losing.

00:16:52.459 --> 00:16:55.059
And they thought, oh, well, if we just take the ark with us,

00:16:55.059 --> 00:16:57.139
then all of a sudden we'll win.

00:16:57.139 --> 00:16:58.619
That's not how it works.

00:17:00.419 --> 00:17:02.459
They were defeated and the ark was taken.

00:17:03.979 --> 00:17:05.539
What a wake up call, amen?

00:17:06.379 --> 00:17:08.539
They thought, oh, we can just bring this,

00:17:08.539 --> 00:17:10.339
lucky charm with us, so to speak,

00:17:10.339 --> 00:17:11.579
and we'll be able to have victory

00:17:11.579 --> 00:17:12.899
because we have the ark with us.

00:17:12.899 --> 00:17:15.259
No, that's not how it works.

00:17:16.099 --> 00:17:17.779
We find that the ark was taken.

00:17:17.779 --> 00:17:20.019
And those people, the Philistines, they suffered greatly.

00:17:20.019 --> 00:17:20.859
Did they not?

00:17:20.859 --> 00:17:23.619
Dagon, their God was falling over

00:17:23.619 --> 00:17:25.419
and they had all sorts of trouble

00:17:25.419 --> 00:17:27.339
and they wanted to get rid of the ark.

00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:30.739
And they devised a plan on how they would get the ark out

00:17:30.739 --> 00:17:33.539
and God worked miraculously and the ark was delivered.

00:17:33.539 --> 00:17:35.419
But then we find that after some time,

00:17:35.419 --> 00:17:36.979
David decided that the ark needed

00:17:36.979 --> 00:17:37.979
to come back to Jerusalem.

00:17:37.979 --> 00:17:39.779
By the way, it was a good plan, it was a good thought.

00:17:39.779 --> 00:17:42.739
It was a good thing that David wanted to do.

00:17:42.739 --> 00:17:44.939
The people were on board, it was supported.

00:17:45.819 --> 00:17:49.419
But you know, they tried to bring it on a cart.

00:17:50.779 --> 00:17:53.619
And that's not how God said that the ark was to be moved.

00:17:55.059 --> 00:17:58.939
And as the ark going over that threshold

00:17:58.939 --> 00:18:03.500
was about to fall over, a man touched it.

00:18:04.339 --> 00:18:06.539
And Uzzah lost his life.

00:18:06.539 --> 00:18:07.899
Why?

00:18:07.899 --> 00:18:10.059
Because God's work must be done God's way.

00:18:11.099 --> 00:18:12.819
You say, well, that's kind of drastic.

00:18:12.819 --> 00:18:15.019
I agree, David was fearful.

00:18:16.259 --> 00:18:18.339
But you know what David did?

00:18:18.339 --> 00:18:21.859
He sought the Lord and he found out

00:18:21.859 --> 00:18:23.579
there's a prescribed way.

00:18:24.659 --> 00:18:26.699
And if we do it God's way, and guess what they did?

00:18:26.699 --> 00:18:28.500
They did it God's way and guess what happened?

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:29.899
The ark was brought back.

00:18:30.819 --> 00:18:32.899
God's work must be done God's way.

00:18:32.899 --> 00:18:35.940
We cannot employ the methods of the world.

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:39.500
We cannot employ the methods of whatever it might be.

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:41.820
No, we have to get into the Bible.

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:44.179
As a Baptist, we say the Bible is a sole authority

00:18:44.179 --> 00:18:47.419
not only for faith, but for practice.

00:18:47.419 --> 00:18:49.260
Why do we do the things that we do?

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:50.140
Why do we worship?

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:51.739
Why do we do what we do?

00:18:51.739 --> 00:18:55.539
Well, God has prescribed the way to approach him,

00:18:55.539 --> 00:18:57.539
the way to worship him.

00:18:57.539 --> 00:19:00.339
And here we find that this good soldier,

00:19:00.339 --> 00:19:01.619
in 2 Timothy chapter two,

00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:04.380
he's going to have discipline in his life.

00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:06.179
We find that we live in a society today

00:19:06.179 --> 00:19:08.500
where there's such a lack of discipline.

00:19:09.779 --> 00:19:11.059
Is it not true?

00:19:11.059 --> 00:19:12.380
We see it all around us.

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:14.140
There's a lack of discipline

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:16.500
on the part of our citizens of our nation.

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:18.140
And we find even in our churches,

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:20.059
and we find this morning that as we come

00:19:20.059 --> 00:19:22.700
to verse number five of 2 Timothy two,

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:25.260
that as I summarize the thought of this verse,

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:28.979
that we find that this one that's striving for masteries,

00:19:28.979 --> 00:19:31.339
he's not crowned except he strive lawfully.

00:19:32.019 --> 00:19:33.419
There's discipline.

00:19:33.419 --> 00:19:35.219
And as we look at this passage of scripture

00:19:35.219 --> 00:19:37.099
in 2 Timothy two, I want to draw your attention

00:19:37.099 --> 00:19:38.859
to verses 22 and 23.

00:19:38.859 --> 00:19:41.099
And I give you some thoughts this morning.

00:19:41.099 --> 00:19:42.779
The Bible says this in verse 22

00:19:42.779 --> 00:19:44.820
of 2 Timothy chapter two.

00:19:46.219 --> 00:19:48.659
Flee also youthful lust,

00:19:48.659 --> 00:19:52.339
but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace,

00:19:52.339 --> 00:19:55.700
with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.

00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:59.179
Verse 23, but foolish and unlearned questions avoid,

00:19:59.179 --> 00:20:00.459
knowing that they.

00:20:00.459 --> 00:20:03.659
they do gender strifes.

00:20:03.659 --> 00:20:05.259
If you're taking notes this morning,

00:20:05.259 --> 00:20:06.699
I want you to, number one,

00:20:06.699 --> 00:20:10.379
consider what the disciplined soldier flees.

00:20:10.379 --> 00:20:12.039
There's some things that they flee from.

00:20:12.039 --> 00:20:13.859
According to verse number 22,

00:20:13.859 --> 00:20:18.859
the Bible says, flee also youthful lust.

00:20:18.979 --> 00:20:21.419
We find that there's an obvious reference

00:20:21.419 --> 00:20:23.619
in this phrase that is given to us

00:20:23.619 --> 00:20:25.979
in 2 Timothy 2 and verse 22.

00:20:25.979 --> 00:20:29.339
There's an obvious reference to immoral behavior.

00:20:29.379 --> 00:20:33.139
And oh, how we see the immorality in our world today.

00:20:33.139 --> 00:20:36.639
We see the immorality, not only in the world today,

00:20:36.639 --> 00:20:38.299
but I'm saying to you this morning

00:20:38.299 --> 00:20:41.619
that we see immorality in the church today.

00:20:41.619 --> 00:20:44.699
It's a sad thing, but it's a true thing.

00:20:44.699 --> 00:20:47.299
It brings a reproach against the name of Christ.

00:20:48.459 --> 00:20:50.459
There's some that say, well, you know,

00:20:50.459 --> 00:20:52.699
I don't think you have to go to that extent.

00:20:52.699 --> 00:20:54.579
I don't think you have to go to that extreme.

00:20:54.579 --> 00:20:56.599
I beg to differ.

00:20:56.599 --> 00:20:57.979
There are things that we must do.

00:20:57.979 --> 00:21:00.259
There are guards that we must put in place.

00:21:00.259 --> 00:21:01.079
Why?

00:21:01.079 --> 00:21:03.699
Because the devil is a roaring lion

00:21:03.699 --> 00:21:06.339
and he's seeking whom he may devour.

00:21:06.339 --> 00:21:07.779
There's some things that we need to flee from.

00:21:07.779 --> 00:21:09.539
Listen, I thank the Lord for Joseph

00:21:09.539 --> 00:21:10.939
that he put on his running shoes.

00:21:10.939 --> 00:21:13.939
I know that's a little past the pirate song

00:21:13.939 --> 00:21:16.979
that they sing and put on the running shoes.

00:21:16.979 --> 00:21:17.999
And guess what?

00:21:17.999 --> 00:21:21.299
When Potiphar's wife took that opportunity

00:21:21.299 --> 00:21:23.779
after days of saying lie with me

00:21:23.779 --> 00:21:26.399
and Joseph resisting and resisting,

00:21:26.399 --> 00:21:29.039
she finally had that moment that she thought,

00:21:29.039 --> 00:21:30.759
now I have him cornered,

00:21:30.759 --> 00:21:33.999
but Joseph put on his running shoes and he fled.

00:21:33.999 --> 00:21:35.459
He got out of that place.

00:21:35.459 --> 00:21:36.299
Why?

00:21:36.299 --> 00:21:38.439
Because he said, how can I do this great wickedness

00:21:38.439 --> 00:21:41.039
and sin against God?

00:21:41.039 --> 00:21:43.159
He had a right view of God.

00:21:43.159 --> 00:21:44.959
He said, there's some things I need to flee.

00:21:44.959 --> 00:21:48.239
He lost his coat, but he retained his character.

00:21:48.239 --> 00:21:49.439
Hallelujah.

00:21:51.079 --> 00:21:52.119
I have a policy.

00:21:52.119 --> 00:21:53.999
I don't meet with women by myself.

00:21:53.999 --> 00:21:56.039
I don't go anywhere with women by myself

00:21:56.679 --> 00:21:58.599
other than my wife or my daughters.

00:21:58.599 --> 00:21:59.559
Amen?

00:21:59.559 --> 00:22:01.879
Or my mom, a family member, what have you.

00:22:01.879 --> 00:22:04.559
But the reality, I had a lady call one time

00:22:04.559 --> 00:22:06.039
several years ago and say, I need to meet with you.

00:22:06.039 --> 00:22:07.079
And I said, okay, that's wonderful.

00:22:07.079 --> 00:22:07.919
I don't know who you are.

00:22:07.919 --> 00:22:09.359
I don't know why you want to meet,

00:22:09.359 --> 00:22:10.379
but I'm glad to schedule it.

00:22:10.379 --> 00:22:11.799
She said, what are your office hours?

00:22:11.799 --> 00:22:13.379
I don't have office hours.

00:22:14.439 --> 00:22:15.279
Amen?

00:22:16.239 --> 00:22:17.679
You say, I can't believe you don't have office hours.

00:22:17.679 --> 00:22:20.219
I'm here all the time, okay?

00:22:20.219 --> 00:22:22.359
But I don't have office hours for some lady

00:22:22.359 --> 00:22:24.799
that calls me on the phone that wants to meet with me.

00:22:24.799 --> 00:22:26.239
Do you understand what I'm saying?

00:22:26.239 --> 00:22:27.919
And I said this, I'd be glad to set up

00:22:27.919 --> 00:22:30.219
an appointment with you, and my wife will be present.

00:22:30.219 --> 00:22:31.439
She said, I don't want to meet with your wife.

00:22:31.439 --> 00:22:32.279
I want to meet with you.

00:22:32.279 --> 00:22:35.199
And I said, I'm sorry, I'm not going to meet with you.

00:22:35.199 --> 00:22:36.039
You say, well, that's rude.

00:22:36.039 --> 00:22:38.239
No, it's just good sense.

00:22:41.239 --> 00:22:42.599
Amen?

00:22:42.599 --> 00:22:44.719
She said, fine, I'll just come to church.

00:22:44.719 --> 00:22:45.599
I said, that's wonderful.

00:22:45.599 --> 00:22:46.559
Come in church.

00:22:46.559 --> 00:22:47.399
Praise the Lord.

00:22:47.399 --> 00:22:49.199
My wife will be here, amen?

00:22:49.199 --> 00:22:50.939
And she came to church.

00:22:50.939 --> 00:22:51.779
You know what she wanted?

00:22:51.779 --> 00:22:53.039
She wanted us to pay her rent bill.

00:22:53.039 --> 00:22:54.879
She walked in and she handed me a folder

00:22:54.879 --> 00:22:55.719
and wanted us to pay her rent bill.

00:22:55.719 --> 00:22:57.639
It was a silly situation, but I said, listen,

00:22:57.639 --> 00:22:59.759
I don't meet with women by myself.

00:22:59.759 --> 00:23:02.319
Some member of our church asked to meet with me

00:23:02.319 --> 00:23:04.279
not long ago, and I said, that's not a problem.

00:23:04.279 --> 00:23:05.299
I'll be glad to meet with you,

00:23:05.299 --> 00:23:06.799
but either my wife is going to be there

00:23:06.799 --> 00:23:08.439
or your husband will be there.

00:23:09.399 --> 00:23:10.979
You pick, I don't care which,

00:23:10.979 --> 00:23:14.039
but I'm not going to meet with you by myself.

00:23:14.039 --> 00:23:15.679
Amen?

00:23:15.679 --> 00:23:16.879
Flee also youthful lusts.

00:23:16.879 --> 00:23:21.239
Let him that thinketh he stand, take he lest he fall.

00:23:21.239 --> 00:23:23.799
That's what your Bible says, what my Bible says.

00:23:23.799 --> 00:23:26.519
There's an obvious reference to immoral behavior.

00:23:26.519 --> 00:23:28.939
It said, I don't agree with everything,

00:23:28.939 --> 00:23:30.319
and I try to make that disclaimer

00:23:30.319 --> 00:23:33.159
because I don't want people to get a wrong idea,

00:23:33.159 --> 00:23:36.839
but it said that Billy Graham had a policy

00:23:36.839 --> 00:23:38.639
that he never met with women by himself.

00:23:38.639 --> 00:23:40.679
He never went anywhere with a woman by himself,

00:23:40.679 --> 00:23:43.039
and in fact, when he traveled, as much as he traveled,

00:23:43.039 --> 00:23:45.519
he always had members of his team

00:23:45.519 --> 00:23:49.419
that went into the hotel room with him

00:23:49.459 --> 00:23:52.899
just in case a lady was in there waiting for him.

00:23:54.419 --> 00:23:57.619
You say, do we really need to do that?

00:23:57.619 --> 00:24:00.339
Listen, it's a good practice.

00:24:00.339 --> 00:24:02.619
You know, men, you know the reality

00:24:02.619 --> 00:24:04.379
is that you don't have to do anything.

00:24:04.379 --> 00:24:06.719
You just have to be accused of doing something.

00:24:11.019 --> 00:24:12.159
Just be accused.

00:24:14.259 --> 00:24:18.579
We see people in our society,

00:24:18.579 --> 00:24:23.059
preachers falling due to immoral behavior.

00:24:23.059 --> 00:24:24.099
Do you not see it in the news?

00:24:24.099 --> 00:24:25.579
I see it in the news.

00:24:25.579 --> 00:24:28.179
I don't know these men personally, but I see it.

00:24:29.379 --> 00:24:30.959
Listen, there's an obvious reference here

00:24:30.959 --> 00:24:33.099
that a good soldier, a disciplined soldier

00:24:33.099 --> 00:24:35.579
is gonna flee from some things,

00:24:35.579 --> 00:24:37.139
and it says flee also youthful lust.

00:24:37.139 --> 00:24:39.539
I believe there's an obvious reference to immoral behavior,

00:24:39.539 --> 00:24:40.939
but we also think about that subject,

00:24:40.939 --> 00:24:42.259
that thought of youthful lust.

00:24:42.259 --> 00:24:44.679
It can refer to those foolish actions

00:24:44.679 --> 00:24:47.599
that can allure us, especially in our youth.

00:24:47.599 --> 00:24:50.279
Remember, Paul is writing to Timothy as a young man.

00:24:50.279 --> 00:24:52.719
Now, he's probably my age when he's being written to,

00:24:52.719 --> 00:24:54.479
but I'm still a young man, amen,

00:24:54.479 --> 00:24:55.919
and praise the Lord for that.

00:24:55.919 --> 00:24:58.319
Timothy's not a teenager when he's being written to,

00:24:58.319 --> 00:25:01.119
and we often use the verse of Scripture,

00:25:01.119 --> 00:25:03.679
let no man despise thy youth.

00:25:03.679 --> 00:25:05.959
The reality is that he wasn't a teenager,

00:25:05.959 --> 00:25:09.319
and we use that verse of Scripture with teenagers sometimes.

00:25:09.319 --> 00:25:11.999
It's actually a verse that we've used often there

00:25:11.999 --> 00:25:14.499
in 1 Timothy 4 and verse 12,

00:25:14.499 --> 00:25:17.499
but the reality is that Timothy is probably 40-ish

00:25:18.379 --> 00:25:22.059
in his early 40s, but there's still these youthful lusts,

00:25:22.059 --> 00:25:25.059
and Paul says flee these things.

00:25:25.059 --> 00:25:26.979
Let me remind you what Proverbs says.

00:25:26.979 --> 00:25:29.799
In Proverbs chapter one, you don't need to turn there.

00:25:29.799 --> 00:25:30.639
I'll read it to you,

00:25:30.639 --> 00:25:31.459
because we're gonna go right back

00:25:31.459 --> 00:25:33.579
to 2 Timothy chapter two,

00:25:33.579 --> 00:25:35.579
but in Proverbs chapter one in verse number 10,

00:25:35.579 --> 00:25:39.219
the Bible says, my son, if sinners entice thee,

00:25:39.219 --> 00:25:42.539
consent thou not.

00:25:42.539 --> 00:25:45.339
You know, there's some times that we just need to say no.

00:25:45.339 --> 00:25:46.439
I'm not gonna go there.

00:25:46.439 --> 00:25:47.279
I'm not gonna do that.

00:25:48.099 --> 00:25:48.919
I'm not gonna participate in that.

00:25:48.919 --> 00:25:49.759
Why?

00:25:49.759 --> 00:25:50.799
Because there's nothing good that's gonna come about

00:25:50.799 --> 00:25:51.759
from that thing.

00:25:51.759 --> 00:25:54.439
There's no way that that thing is going to bring honor

00:25:54.439 --> 00:25:55.539
and glory to my God.

00:25:55.539 --> 00:25:59.279
It's going to tarnish my testimony for God.

00:25:59.279 --> 00:26:02.759
There's some things, when we think about being disciplined

00:26:02.759 --> 00:26:04.259
and being a disciplined soldier,

00:26:04.259 --> 00:26:07.719
there's some things that we must flee from.

00:26:07.719 --> 00:26:09.639
We must flee from, but notice with me

00:26:09.639 --> 00:26:11.979
back in 2 Timothy chapter two,

00:26:11.979 --> 00:26:14.159
we see in verse 22 that the Bible says,

00:26:14.159 --> 00:26:15.479
flee also youthful lusts,

00:26:15.479 --> 00:26:16.979
but then notice the Bible says,

00:26:17.719 --> 00:26:18.559
but follow righteousness.

00:26:18.559 --> 00:26:20.519
Number two, not only do we consider

00:26:20.519 --> 00:26:22.059
what the disciplined soldier flees,

00:26:22.059 --> 00:26:25.359
but we consider what the disciplined soldier follows.

00:26:25.359 --> 00:26:30.359
He says, follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace.

00:26:31.399 --> 00:26:33.899
Now, think about these phrases that are used,

00:26:33.899 --> 00:26:36.759
these words that God uses here in verse 22,

00:26:36.759 --> 00:26:38.839
and thinking about following righteousness,

00:26:38.839 --> 00:26:40.359
that's doing that which is right,

00:26:40.359 --> 00:26:41.519
doing that which is pleasing.

00:26:41.519 --> 00:26:45.599
We talked about the good soldier seeking to please his God.

00:26:45.599 --> 00:26:46.479
What is right?

00:26:46.979 --> 00:26:48.579
Listen, we live in a society today

00:26:48.579 --> 00:26:52.379
that has tried to move the needle, if you will,

00:26:52.379 --> 00:26:54.779
with regard to what is right and what is wrong.

00:26:54.779 --> 00:26:56.779
We find that we live in a culture today,

00:26:56.779 --> 00:26:59.699
just like Jeremiah and Isaiah ministered in a culture

00:26:59.699 --> 00:27:02.419
where they called right, evil, good.

00:27:02.419 --> 00:27:04.459
They called good, evil, and evil, good.

00:27:04.459 --> 00:27:07.139
We live in a society today where they're trying

00:27:07.139 --> 00:27:09.919
to change the moral compass.

00:27:12.039 --> 00:27:13.459
It's not really that bad.

00:27:13.459 --> 00:27:14.919
Everyone else is doing it.

00:27:15.179 --> 00:27:19.539
When you compare it to this, that's not how it works.

00:27:19.539 --> 00:27:23.019
That's not what God's people should use as our standard.

00:27:23.019 --> 00:27:25.939
No, the moral compass of our society

00:27:25.939 --> 00:27:28.419
is not what we determine for what is right

00:27:28.419 --> 00:27:29.259
and what is wrong.

00:27:29.259 --> 00:27:31.499
It is this book that determines what is right

00:27:31.499 --> 00:27:33.279
and what is wrong.

00:27:33.279 --> 00:27:35.739
And we follow after righteousness.

00:27:35.739 --> 00:27:37.259
It requires discipline.

00:27:37.259 --> 00:27:39.299
You say, but everybody else is going that way,

00:27:39.299 --> 00:27:40.739
but I wanna be a good soldier,

00:27:40.739 --> 00:27:43.199
and I wanna follow righteousness.

00:27:45.219 --> 00:27:47.179
It's not always easy swimming upstream.

00:27:48.659 --> 00:27:51.019
We're called to make a difference.

00:27:51.019 --> 00:27:53.259
We're called to live for God,

00:27:53.259 --> 00:27:57.799
to do that which is right, to take the high road.

00:27:59.439 --> 00:28:00.279
Why?

00:28:00.279 --> 00:28:02.939
Again, because I'm gonna stand before my Savior one day,

00:28:02.939 --> 00:28:04.699
and so are you.

00:28:04.699 --> 00:28:08.939
So we follow, notice, after righteousness.

00:28:08.939 --> 00:28:11.619
He then says this, not only follow righteousness,

00:28:11.619 --> 00:28:12.619
but faith.

00:28:12.639 --> 00:28:15.679
Now think about faith, and we consider this idea of faith.

00:28:15.679 --> 00:28:17.559
Without faith, it's impossible to please him,

00:28:17.559 --> 00:28:19.679
for he that cometh to God must believe that he is,

00:28:19.679 --> 00:28:22.419
and then he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.

00:28:22.419 --> 00:28:25.879
Will the Son of Man find faith on the earth?

00:28:25.879 --> 00:28:27.999
I was reading this morning, actually yesterday,

00:28:27.999 --> 00:28:29.639
I was reading the book of Matthew,

00:28:29.639 --> 00:28:31.279
and I was reading it this morning as well,

00:28:31.279 --> 00:28:32.439
but yesterday I was reading it,

00:28:32.439 --> 00:28:33.959
and I came to Matthew chapter number eight,

00:28:33.959 --> 00:28:36.319
and I read about that centurion,

00:28:36.319 --> 00:28:38.559
and I read about his great faith.

00:28:39.799 --> 00:28:42.559
He said, I got a servant that's back home

00:28:43.379 --> 00:28:44.219
that's sick of the palsy,

00:28:44.219 --> 00:28:46.299
and Jesus said, I'll come to your house,

00:28:46.299 --> 00:28:47.619
and I'll heal him, and he said,

00:28:47.619 --> 00:28:50.779
no, I'm not worthy for you to come to my house.

00:28:50.779 --> 00:28:53.019
Just speak the word.

00:28:53.019 --> 00:28:55.659
Think about the faith of the centurion.

00:28:57.379 --> 00:29:00.219
And the Bible says that the man used the illustration

00:29:00.219 --> 00:29:02.899
that he was a man that had authority,

00:29:02.899 --> 00:29:04.919
and he said, come, and they come,

00:29:04.919 --> 00:29:06.379
and he said, go, and they go,

00:29:06.379 --> 00:29:07.839
and he said, do, and they do,

00:29:07.839 --> 00:29:11.379
and he recognized that Jesus is God.

00:29:12.359 --> 00:29:16.159
And he said, all you have to do is speak the word,

00:29:16.159 --> 00:29:18.319
and Jesus said, what great faith.

00:29:18.319 --> 00:29:21.359
He marveled at his faith.

00:29:22.239 --> 00:29:24.199
Where do we get faith?

00:29:24.199 --> 00:29:27.199
So then faith cometh by hearing,

00:29:27.199 --> 00:29:28.999
hearing by the word.

00:29:28.999 --> 00:29:32.039
So thankful that God would increase our faith,

00:29:32.039 --> 00:29:34.959
that God would help us to have faith in who he is,

00:29:34.959 --> 00:29:36.879
taking him at his word,

00:29:36.879 --> 00:29:39.679
believing that he is able,

00:29:39.679 --> 00:29:40.819
he is God.

00:29:42.059 --> 00:29:45.659
I said this last week when I talked about pleasing God,

00:29:45.659 --> 00:29:48.939
and that one way that we please God is living by faith.

00:29:48.939 --> 00:29:51.779
I said this, that every time we share the gospel,

00:29:51.779 --> 00:29:53.619
we're exercising faith.

00:29:53.619 --> 00:29:54.439
Why?

00:29:54.439 --> 00:29:56.219
Because we're believing the truth of Romans

00:29:56.219 --> 00:29:58.299
when the Bible says the gospel is the power of God

00:29:58.299 --> 00:29:59.359
unto salvation.

00:29:59.359 --> 00:30:02.299
I met a man in Florida when I was down there.

00:30:02.299 --> 00:30:05.179
I went to Walmart like 47 times when I was in Florida.

00:30:05.179 --> 00:30:07.459
It really wasn't that many times, but it felt like it.

00:30:07.459 --> 00:30:08.939
But I met a man, Tim, I walked in,

00:30:08.939 --> 00:30:11.379
and they had, our Walmart here doesn't have this,

00:30:11.379 --> 00:30:12.979
but I know the one in Manassas does.

00:30:12.979 --> 00:30:15.259
They have gates, like you can't even get into Walmart

00:30:15.259 --> 00:30:17.259
unless you trip that thing and it opens up for you.

00:30:17.259 --> 00:30:18.699
I don't know what the deal is.

00:30:18.699 --> 00:30:21.059
I understand leaving, right?

00:30:21.059 --> 00:30:22.499
Like you don't want people stealing stuff,

00:30:22.499 --> 00:30:24.339
but they had this gate there and there was a man

00:30:24.339 --> 00:30:26.699
standing there, and his name was Ephraim.

00:30:27.699 --> 00:30:30.779
I have never met somebody named Ephraim before.

00:30:30.779 --> 00:30:33.299
Personally, never met anyone named Ephraim.

00:30:33.299 --> 00:30:34.579
I thought, well, that's interesting.

00:30:34.579 --> 00:30:37.839
Listen, I like talking to people when they have Bible names.

00:30:37.839 --> 00:30:39.699
To me, it's an open door.

00:30:39.699 --> 00:30:40.739
It's an open door.

00:30:40.739 --> 00:30:43.459
I said, man, Ephraim, I said, man, that's a great name.

00:30:44.299 --> 00:30:48.099
I said, do you know about Ephraim in the Bible?

00:30:48.099 --> 00:30:48.939
He's like, oh yeah.

00:30:48.939 --> 00:30:52.439
I said, your mom must have been pretty serious

00:30:52.439 --> 00:30:55.539
about the Lord and the Bible to name you Ephraim.

00:30:55.619 --> 00:30:57.879
He said, my name's Ephraim Obadiah.

00:31:00.579 --> 00:31:03.379
How many of you have met an Ephraim Obadiah?

00:31:03.379 --> 00:31:05.099
I mean, Aaron and Elizabeth, they're saying,

00:31:05.099 --> 00:31:08.819
hey, maybe we're gonna name our sons Ephraim Obadiah.

00:31:08.819 --> 00:31:11.099
I've never met an Ephraim Obadiah.

00:31:12.099 --> 00:31:13.499
So I started talking to him.

00:31:14.819 --> 00:31:17.419
He told me his mom still lives in Atlanta,

00:31:17.419 --> 00:31:20.579
goes to church faithfully, wonderful.

00:31:20.579 --> 00:31:22.459
And I said, Ephraim, what about you?

00:31:22.459 --> 00:31:24.899
If you're to die today, are you gonna go to heaven?

00:31:24.899 --> 00:31:27.439
Are you sure that your sins have been forgiven?

00:31:27.439 --> 00:31:29.139
He said, no, I'm not sure of that.

00:31:31.599 --> 00:31:33.579
He's probably 60 years old.

00:31:33.579 --> 00:31:37.539
His name was Ephraim Obadiah, and he was going to hell.

00:31:39.099 --> 00:31:40.019
He didn't know the gospel.

00:31:40.019 --> 00:31:41.419
He didn't know the truth of salvation.

00:31:41.419 --> 00:31:42.259
What a shame.

00:31:43.179 --> 00:31:45.579
Does anybody believe the gospel tract?

00:31:45.579 --> 00:31:46.419
He was working.

00:31:46.419 --> 00:31:48.179
I wasn't able to get into a whole gospel presentation.

00:31:48.179 --> 00:31:51.179
I told him he could know for sure that heaven is his home.

00:31:51.179 --> 00:31:52.679
It's exercising faith.

00:31:53.679 --> 00:31:55.519
When I went back to try to follow up with Ephraim,

00:31:55.519 --> 00:31:57.579
I found a man by the name of Micah.

00:31:58.679 --> 00:31:59.999
I mean, he was standing at the same place.

00:31:59.999 --> 00:32:03.319
I said, man, I must be in the place of God, amen?

00:32:03.319 --> 00:32:06.119
Felt like Jacob, like what is going on here, right?

00:32:06.119 --> 00:32:08.759
This man, his name is Micah, and I'm like, here we go, right?

00:32:08.759 --> 00:32:09.599
I mean, what an opportunity.

00:32:09.599 --> 00:32:12.039
I said, here, I want you to read this.

00:32:13.119 --> 00:32:16.999
Listen, we exercise faith by taking God at his word.

00:32:16.999 --> 00:32:18.879
You know, when we give an offering,

00:32:18.879 --> 00:32:19.719
you know what you're doing?

00:32:19.719 --> 00:32:21.839
You're exercising faith.

00:32:21.879 --> 00:32:23.319
You know what God said in the book of Malachi?

00:32:23.319 --> 00:32:25.079
Prove me.

00:32:25.079 --> 00:32:25.979
Prove me.

00:32:27.759 --> 00:32:29.679
You say, I can't afford to give.

00:32:29.679 --> 00:32:31.039
You're deceived.

00:32:31.039 --> 00:32:32.619
You're not living by faith.

00:32:32.619 --> 00:32:34.519
You're not trusting God.

00:32:34.519 --> 00:32:38.879
Because God said, prove me, and God will bless.

00:32:38.879 --> 00:32:39.899
God will bless.

00:32:39.899 --> 00:32:44.899
We find that he says, follow righteousness, faith, charity.

00:32:45.259 --> 00:32:46.479
We use the word love.

00:32:46.479 --> 00:32:50.839
I love the truth of God's word with regard to charity

00:32:50.839 --> 00:32:54.439
and love and how all things are to be done

00:32:54.439 --> 00:32:58.559
with fervent charity, according to 1 Peter chapter four.

00:32:58.559 --> 00:33:02.119
We find that we're to love, as Jesus said in John 13,

00:33:02.119 --> 00:33:05.499
I give you a new commandment, that you love one another,

00:33:05.499 --> 00:33:09.039
but how, as Christ loved, as I have loved you.

00:33:09.039 --> 00:33:11.559
It's amazing to me at the beginning of John 13

00:33:11.559 --> 00:33:15.139
that Jesus says that I loved him to the end.

00:33:15.139 --> 00:33:18.399
I'm thankful that we serve a God who is a loving God.

00:33:18.399 --> 00:33:20.639
I'm thankful that we serve a God who loves me

00:33:21.439 --> 00:33:22.999
with an unconditional love, with an everlasting love.

00:33:22.999 --> 00:33:25.059
I'm thankful for the truth that God said

00:33:25.059 --> 00:33:27.139
that there's nothing that can separate me

00:33:27.139 --> 00:33:28.819
from the love of God.

00:33:28.819 --> 00:33:30.979
But you understand that we are to walk in love.

00:33:30.979 --> 00:33:32.779
We are to love one another.

00:33:32.779 --> 00:33:36.939
We are to follow, he says, listen, if you're disciplined,

00:33:36.939 --> 00:33:38.579
if you're a disciplined soldier,

00:33:38.579 --> 00:33:39.979
if you're gonna be a good soldier,

00:33:39.979 --> 00:33:41.739
there's gonna be discipline in your life.

00:33:41.739 --> 00:33:44.739
You need to flee some things, but you need to follow things.

00:33:44.739 --> 00:33:49.699
Righteousness, faith, charity, notice number four, peace.

00:33:49.699 --> 00:33:52.039
Our world knows no peace.

00:33:52.039 --> 00:33:53.519
Our world is in turmoil.

00:33:54.959 --> 00:33:58.079
Our world, listen, I'm telling you,

00:33:58.079 --> 00:33:59.839
I've read the Bible, I've read it through,

00:33:59.839 --> 00:34:02.119
I don't know how many times, I've never kept track

00:34:02.119 --> 00:34:05.439
of a combined number of times I've read the Bible,

00:34:05.439 --> 00:34:08.199
but I've read the Bible through twice this year already,

00:34:08.199 --> 00:34:09.799
and I've read the Bible through many times.

00:34:09.799 --> 00:34:13.459
Can I tell you, the world is longing for a peace treaty.

00:34:14.639 --> 00:34:16.279
And you know who's gonna bring it?

00:34:16.279 --> 00:34:17.719
The Antichrist.

00:34:19.879 --> 00:34:21.279
Listen, if you don't believe that,

00:34:21.279 --> 00:34:23.039
you need to read the Bible,

00:34:23.039 --> 00:34:25.699
because I'm telling you, that's what the Bible teaches us,

00:34:25.699 --> 00:34:27.199
that the Antichrist is gonna come on the scene,

00:34:27.199 --> 00:34:28.519
he's gonna bring a peace treaty,

00:34:28.519 --> 00:34:30.299
and you see all these things going on in the world,

00:34:30.299 --> 00:34:31.599
and you say, it's all out of control.

00:34:31.599 --> 00:34:33.000
No, it's all falling in place.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.279
God is in control.

00:34:34.279 --> 00:34:36.439
The Lord God omnipotent reigneth.

00:34:36.439 --> 00:34:41.359
And the reality is that if there's no turmoil,

00:34:41.359 --> 00:34:44.039
there's no agreement on a peace treaty.

00:34:44.039 --> 00:34:49.039
But in great turmoil, as we see in our world today,

00:34:50.439 --> 00:34:53.299
oh, it's ripe for a peace treaty.

00:34:53.299 --> 00:34:54.939
It's ripe for a peace treaty.

00:34:55.919 --> 00:34:57.919
The Antichrist is gonna come on the scene.

00:34:57.919 --> 00:34:59.519
He's gonna offer a peace treaty.

00:35:00.399 --> 00:35:01.419
It's gonna happen.

00:35:02.519 --> 00:35:05.239
But we understand that we know the Prince of Peace.

00:35:06.279 --> 00:35:07.679
Aren't you thankful?

00:35:07.679 --> 00:35:10.639
He says, follow peace.

00:35:10.639 --> 00:35:12.399
I'm thankful that the Bible tells us

00:35:12.399 --> 00:35:15.579
that we have the peace of God.

00:35:16.479 --> 00:35:18.399
I'm thankful that the Bible tells us

00:35:18.579 --> 00:35:20.179
that he is the Prince of Peace,

00:35:20.179 --> 00:35:25.179
and that he said, my peace give I unto thee, in John 14.

00:35:26.379 --> 00:35:27.779
Oh, hallelujah.

00:35:27.779 --> 00:35:29.899
It's not as the world giveth.

00:35:29.899 --> 00:35:32.819
Great peace have they which love thy law,

00:35:32.819 --> 00:35:35.259
and nothing shall offend them.

00:35:35.259 --> 00:35:37.979
Oh, he'll keep us in perfect peace.

00:35:37.979 --> 00:35:39.699
The Bible says that he'll give us a peace

00:35:39.699 --> 00:35:42.559
that passeth all understanding.

00:35:42.559 --> 00:35:44.339
The Bible says this in Colossians,

00:35:44.339 --> 00:35:47.439
that we're to let the peace of God rule in our hearts.

00:35:47.459 --> 00:35:48.819
That means when all the turmoil

00:35:48.819 --> 00:35:50.899
and all the difficulties all around us,

00:35:50.899 --> 00:35:52.859
no, we're keeping our eyes on Jesus,

00:35:52.859 --> 00:35:55.019
and we're allowing the peace of God

00:35:55.019 --> 00:35:56.779
to rule in our hearts.

00:35:56.779 --> 00:35:59.539
Though the chaos and the turmoil and all that's going on,

00:35:59.539 --> 00:36:03.059
no, I know the Prince of Peace,

00:36:03.059 --> 00:36:04.939
and I'm following after peace.

00:36:08.139 --> 00:36:11.059
Notice he says this at the end of verse 22.

00:36:11.059 --> 00:36:14.619
With them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.

00:36:14.619 --> 00:36:16.539
You see that little phrase with them?

00:36:16.559 --> 00:36:18.000
I like that.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.039
You know why I would say it this way?

00:36:20.039 --> 00:36:23.639
The soldier that's a good soldier that's disciplined,

00:36:23.639 --> 00:36:25.519
he's running with the right crowd.

00:36:27.679 --> 00:36:32.399
Follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace,

00:36:32.399 --> 00:36:36.519
with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.

00:36:37.839 --> 00:36:40.639
I'm thankful for my brothers and sisters in Christ

00:36:40.639 --> 00:36:44.779
that are following righteousness, faith,

00:36:45.639 --> 00:36:48.959
charity, and peace.

00:36:48.959 --> 00:36:50.919
You know, we can encourage one another

00:36:50.919 --> 00:36:55.099
as we're following the Lord together with them.

00:36:55.099 --> 00:36:56.859
You know, we need to be careful.

00:36:56.859 --> 00:36:59.079
The Bible tells us that we're not to be deceived,

00:36:59.079 --> 00:37:02.719
that evil communications corrupt good manners.

00:37:02.719 --> 00:37:04.339
It's a Bible truth.

00:37:04.339 --> 00:37:06.039
My parents didn't know anything about the Bible

00:37:06.039 --> 00:37:08.959
when I was a little kid, my grandparents,

00:37:08.959 --> 00:37:10.919
but I remember them talking about the truth

00:37:10.919 --> 00:37:14.279
of a bad apple's gonna spoil the other apples.

00:37:15.239 --> 00:37:16.839
And then I found out as I read the Bible

00:37:16.839 --> 00:37:18.559
and as obviously my parents got saved,

00:37:18.559 --> 00:37:19.839
they read the Bible that man,

00:37:19.839 --> 00:37:21.399
that little phrase that they use,

00:37:21.399 --> 00:37:24.319
there's really some Bible truth to that.

00:37:24.319 --> 00:37:28.759
Be not deceived, evil communications corrupt good manners.

00:37:30.959 --> 00:37:31.919
Who are we running with?

00:37:31.919 --> 00:37:33.319
Who do we spend our time with?

00:37:33.319 --> 00:37:36.919
Are we going with those that are following

00:37:36.919 --> 00:37:38.919
after the same things that we're following after?

00:37:38.919 --> 00:37:41.559
Are we, listen, iron sharpeneth iron.

00:37:42.339 --> 00:37:45.659
Are we going, running with the right crowd,

00:37:45.659 --> 00:37:47.199
the people that are gonna encourage us,

00:37:47.199 --> 00:37:49.339
that are gonna challenge us to live godly

00:37:49.339 --> 00:37:51.539
and to live righteously in this present world

00:37:51.539 --> 00:37:53.419
to seek to please God?

00:37:53.419 --> 00:37:57.759
Who do we, who are those that we allow to influence us?

00:37:57.759 --> 00:37:59.419
You say, I don't let anybody influence me.

00:37:59.419 --> 00:38:00.500
You're crazy.

00:38:01.379 --> 00:38:02.939
Because the people that you run with

00:38:02.939 --> 00:38:05.939
in the books that you read, they're influencing you.

00:38:07.419 --> 00:38:08.859
It's the way it works.

00:38:09.639 --> 00:38:13.839
We find that he says that you're to flee some things,

00:38:13.839 --> 00:38:15.679
you're to follow some things,

00:38:15.679 --> 00:38:17.139
and you're to follow with them.

00:38:17.139 --> 00:38:19.799
Listen, I think I'm gonna preach about Elijah tonight.

00:38:19.799 --> 00:38:21.839
I said this in Sunday school this morning

00:38:21.839 --> 00:38:22.759
at the end of the lesson,

00:38:22.759 --> 00:38:26.599
but God got my attention in 1 Kings 19 this past week

00:38:26.599 --> 00:38:28.079
on a question that he asked Elijah

00:38:28.079 --> 00:38:29.919
and I just couldn't get away from it.

00:38:30.879 --> 00:38:32.119
I'm gonna preach about Elijah tonight,

00:38:32.119 --> 00:38:33.359
but you know what Elijah said?

00:38:33.359 --> 00:38:34.599
I'm the only one.

00:38:35.719 --> 00:38:37.119
God said there are 7,000.

00:38:37.119 --> 00:38:38.559
Now that's not part of my message tonight,

00:38:39.299 --> 00:38:40.140
so I can say it,

00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:41.979
because I'll save everything else for tonight.

00:38:41.979 --> 00:38:44.899
But the reality is that he had that perspective.

00:38:44.899 --> 00:38:46.820
I'm the only one.

00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:47.700
Can I tell you this morning,

00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:50.179
you're not the only one that's following Christ.

00:38:50.179 --> 00:38:51.619
And you need to find some other people

00:38:51.619 --> 00:38:52.459
that are following Christ

00:38:52.459 --> 00:38:54.779
that are gonna build you up spiritually.

00:38:54.779 --> 00:38:56.500
They're gonna edify you.

00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:58.579
The Bible says that we're to edify one another.

00:38:58.579 --> 00:38:59.659
Yes, we're to love one another,

00:38:59.659 --> 00:39:01.299
but we're to edify, we're to build up.

00:39:01.299 --> 00:39:04.299
Listen, it is good for us to have some friends,

00:39:04.299 --> 00:39:08.179
some, listen, understand with me this morning

00:39:08.239 --> 00:39:11.640
that a true godly friend will call you out

00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:13.140
when you're not walking right.

00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:16.399
And you ought to thank God for that person.

00:39:18.599 --> 00:39:21.200
You ought to thank God for that person

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:23.719
that's gonna keep you accountable,

00:39:24.919 --> 00:39:28.279
that's gonna challenge you to walk with Christ,

00:39:28.279 --> 00:39:31.079
that's gonna challenge you to grow in your faith.

00:39:32.279 --> 00:39:34.359
You ought to thank God for that person

00:39:34.359 --> 00:39:35.919
that will keep you accountable.

00:39:36.739 --> 00:39:39.779
You know, I've learned something over the years

00:39:39.779 --> 00:39:41.679
about working out.

00:39:41.679 --> 00:39:43.279
Number one, I don't do it a lot.

00:39:45.099 --> 00:39:46.579
I enjoy working out.

00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:50.380
And I've really enjoyed it in recent years

00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:52.659
as I've been able to work out with Joseph.

00:39:53.779 --> 00:39:56.359
Not only is he my son,

00:39:56.359 --> 00:39:58.539
and we get to spend some of that time together,

00:39:58.539 --> 00:39:59.539
but there's something.

00:39:59.539 --> 00:40:02.139
Something about working out that I've learned, Bart, over the years is that when you have

00:40:02.139 --> 00:40:08.219
a partner to work out with, it's so much easier to work out.

00:40:08.219 --> 00:40:09.219
Is it not?

00:40:09.219 --> 00:40:13.159
Listen, you try to work out by yourself, and there's like 105 other things that come up

00:40:13.159 --> 00:40:16.499
that you could do instead of working out.

00:40:16.499 --> 00:40:18.499
Come on.

00:40:18.499 --> 00:40:29.179
But when you have an accountability partner, somebody that's waiting for you at the location

00:40:29.179 --> 00:40:31.419
where you're going to work out.

00:40:31.419 --> 00:40:32.419
They keep you accountable.

00:40:32.419 --> 00:40:37.339
Listen, we understand that in the physical workout, but I'm saying this morning that

00:40:37.339 --> 00:40:41.139
we've got to keep each other accountable spiritually.

00:40:41.139 --> 00:40:43.219
Who are we running with?

00:40:43.219 --> 00:40:45.499
With them, the Bible says.

00:40:45.499 --> 00:40:49.259
There's some other people that are seeking to please God with their lives that want to,

00:40:49.259 --> 00:40:54.299
as I've been preaching here for weeks now, they want to be a good soldier.

00:40:54.299 --> 00:40:57.119
They don't want to be content with simply being a soldier.

00:40:57.119 --> 00:41:02.559
They want to be a good soldier of Jesus Christ, and as we get ourselves into a position where

00:41:02.559 --> 00:41:06.839
we are running with them and we're building them up and they're building us up and we're

00:41:06.839 --> 00:41:13.039
keeping each other accountable, we're going forward for the cause of Christ.

00:41:13.039 --> 00:41:18.079
Notice with me, not only what the disciplined soldier flees and follows, but number three,

00:41:18.079 --> 00:41:22.919
if you're taking notes this morning, consider what the disciplined soldier avoids.

00:41:22.959 --> 00:41:27.959
In verse 23, the Bible says, but foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they

00:41:27.959 --> 00:41:29.559
do gender strifes.

00:41:29.559 --> 00:41:34.839
Now, it's kind of interesting, he specifically mentions about foolish and unlearned questions

00:41:34.839 --> 00:41:39.519
avoiding and that's the context and that's what we'll focus on, but understand there's

00:41:39.519 --> 00:41:42.679
some things that we just need to avoid that become distractions.

00:41:42.679 --> 00:41:47.319
These foolish and unlearned questions that the instruction is given here with regard

00:41:47.319 --> 00:41:53.239
to avoiding these foolish and unlearned questions, you understand that the Bible says, why to

00:41:53.239 --> 00:41:54.239
do that?

00:41:54.239 --> 00:41:55.239
Because they do gender strifes.

00:41:55.239 --> 00:42:01.239
Here's the danger, as a pastor, I say this very transparently this morning, here's the

00:42:01.239 --> 00:42:06.399
danger sometimes with this idea of these foolish and unlearned questions is that if I don't

00:42:06.399 --> 00:42:12.519
answer the question, then somebody thinks that I just don't know the answer.

00:42:12.519 --> 00:42:15.439
It's not always about knowing the answer.

00:42:15.799 --> 00:42:19.519
Sometimes it's just about having wisdom on what needs to be answered and what doesn't

00:42:19.519 --> 00:42:22.159
need to be answered.

00:42:22.159 --> 00:42:23.999
By the way, we don't know everything.

00:42:23.999 --> 00:42:28.679
You don't know everything, I don't know everything, only God knows everything, but the reality

00:42:28.679 --> 00:42:33.719
is that there are times in which people will ask you questions that are foolish and unlearned

00:42:33.719 --> 00:42:35.719
questions and you need to avoid them.

00:42:35.719 --> 00:42:36.719
Why?

00:42:36.719 --> 00:42:39.639
It's going to take you down a rabbit trail, it's going to take you down a distracted path

00:42:39.639 --> 00:42:43.359
that you don't need to go down, plus it genders strife.

00:42:43.359 --> 00:42:44.359
What does it mean?

00:42:44.359 --> 00:42:45.359
It's reed contention.

00:42:45.359 --> 00:42:50.559
That's what it means, it's the idea of the word or the phrase.

00:42:50.559 --> 00:42:55.279
So I think about this thought this morning of what the disciplined soldier avoids.

00:42:55.279 --> 00:42:58.959
Someone asked me years ago, is God able to do all things?

00:42:58.959 --> 00:43:00.999
Yes, he is.

00:43:00.999 --> 00:43:01.999
Does he know all things?

00:43:01.999 --> 00:43:02.999
Yes, he does.

00:43:02.999 --> 00:43:03.999
Can he make all things?

00:43:03.999 --> 00:43:07.799
And I just went through this series of questions and yes, and so does he have all power?

00:43:07.799 --> 00:43:08.799
Yes, he has all power.

00:43:08.799 --> 00:43:11.879
Okay, so can God make something so big that he can't?

00:43:11.879 --> 00:43:14.339
Come on, that's just nonsense.

00:43:14.339 --> 00:43:21.699
It's foolish, it's unlearned, it genders strife.

00:43:21.699 --> 00:43:24.859
Do you know this morning there's some things that God just doesn't want us to know?

00:43:24.859 --> 00:43:29.899
You say, well, I don't like that, I want to know.

00:43:29.899 --> 00:43:37.479
Some things God just didn't tell us and that's okay, he's God.

00:43:37.479 --> 00:43:42.139
Notice in 1 Timothy, I'm going to read a few verses quickly, this is a thought that recurs

00:43:42.139 --> 00:43:46.539
throughout 1 and 2 Timothy with regard to avoiding these foolish and unlearned questions.

00:43:46.539 --> 00:43:51.459
Turn back to 1 Timothy 1, in verse number four, I mean, he hits it right from the beginning.

00:43:51.459 --> 00:43:55.139
Remember, he's in Ephesus, Timothy is there in Ephesus as the pastor, he's dealing with

00:43:55.139 --> 00:43:59.459
some false teachers and various things that are going on and so Paul is encouraging him

00:43:59.459 --> 00:44:00.459
to do what?

00:44:00.459 --> 00:44:01.459
To continue.

00:44:01.459 --> 00:44:02.459
That's our theme for this year.

00:44:02.459 --> 00:44:06.179
Listen, though you're dealing with all of these things in Ephesus, continue, God has

00:44:06.179 --> 00:44:07.179
you there.

00:44:07.179 --> 00:44:10.579
He has you there for a purpose and for a reason, you need to fight the good fight.

00:44:10.579 --> 00:44:14.699
Notice in verse number four of chapter one of 1 Timothy, neither give heed to fables

00:44:14.699 --> 00:44:20.459
and endless genealogies which minister questions rather than godly edifying which is in faith,

00:44:20.459 --> 00:44:21.459
so do.

00:44:21.459 --> 00:44:23.619
So don't give heed to these things.

00:44:23.619 --> 00:44:28.419
He talks about in verse number six how that they have turned aside, they've swerved and

00:44:28.419 --> 00:44:34.099
have turned aside into vain jangling, useless talk is literally what the phrase means and

00:44:34.099 --> 00:44:39.219
so we find that he tells them there in chapter number one, notice in chapter four of 1 Timothy

00:44:39.379 --> 00:44:42.499
in verse number seven he says, but refuse.

00:44:42.499 --> 00:44:48.299
We've said in chapter two of 2 Timothy he says to avoid, here in 1 Timothy four and

00:44:48.299 --> 00:44:55.179
seven it says, but refuse profane and old wives' fables and exercise thyself rather

00:44:55.179 --> 00:44:57.419
unto godliness.

00:44:57.419 --> 00:45:01.739
There's some things that people would bring up and he says, listen, refuse that, chapter

00:45:01.739 --> 00:45:05.019
six in verses three through five.

00:45:05.019 --> 00:45:09.179
Notice what he says, if any man teach otherwise and consent not to wholesome words, even the

00:45:09.179 --> 00:45:13.019
words of our Lord Jesus Christ and to the doctrine which is according to godliness,

00:45:13.019 --> 00:45:17.939
he is proud knowing nothing but doting about questions and strifes of words whereof cometh

00:45:17.939 --> 00:45:24.059
envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings, perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds and destitute

00:45:24.059 --> 00:45:31.179
of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness, notice what he says, from such withdraw thyself.

00:45:31.179 --> 00:45:36.899
Chapter six in verse 20, O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding

00:45:36.899 --> 00:45:42.019
profane and vain babblings and oppositions of science, falsely so called, which some

00:45:42.019 --> 00:45:47.599
professing have erred concerning the faith, grace be with thee, amen.

00:45:47.599 --> 00:45:52.219
We live in a time in which we need to have great wisdom.

00:45:52.219 --> 00:45:57.139
We have people that are extremely educated, that have PhDs in all sorts of disciplines

00:45:57.139 --> 00:46:01.899
and they sometimes try to carry around their accolades and make you feel like you don't

00:46:01.899 --> 00:46:02.899
know.

00:46:02.899 --> 00:46:07.019
You know God's word, professing themselves to be wise.

00:46:07.019 --> 00:46:12.619
They became fools of this in 2 Peter chapter number three, they were willingly ignorant

00:46:12.619 --> 00:46:13.619
of.

00:46:13.619 --> 00:46:19.299
Listen, they want to deny the truth of who God is because they don't want to be accountable

00:46:19.299 --> 00:46:21.299
to God.

00:46:21.299 --> 00:46:26.259
So there's some things that we need to avoid, some things we need to avoid.

00:46:26.259 --> 00:46:30.059
We notice about a good soldier, he's disciplined.

00:46:30.059 --> 00:46:33.099
Because he has discipline, he flees.

00:46:33.099 --> 00:46:35.939
Because he has discipline, he follows.

00:46:35.939 --> 00:46:38.539
Because he has discipline, he avoids.

00:46:38.539 --> 00:46:46.419
So why is it that a soldier desiring to be a good soldier would live a disciplined life?

00:46:46.419 --> 00:46:50.979
Well, we said in the beginning in 2 Timothy 2 and verse number five, it says, if any man

00:46:50.979 --> 00:46:56.259
also strives for masteries, yet is he not crowned except he strive lawfully.

00:46:56.259 --> 00:47:00.539
Those in the Ishmaelian games, they would stand before the judges, if you will, and

00:47:00.539 --> 00:47:04.139
as they would stand there, in fact, even call a behemoth seat.

00:47:04.139 --> 00:47:09.179
They would stand there and they would receive a reward based on how they ran their race,

00:47:09.179 --> 00:47:14.099
how they competed in their particular discipline, and they would receive a crown that was corruptible,

00:47:14.099 --> 00:47:19.539
but we, as we found in 1 Corinthians 9, an incorruptible, and so why is it that we would

00:47:19.539 --> 00:47:25.259
be challenged this morning to live a disciplined life so that we would be known as being a

00:47:25.259 --> 00:47:26.579
good soldier?

00:47:26.579 --> 00:47:28.899
Because the Lord is coming back.

00:47:28.899 --> 00:47:33.579
And because one day, each and every one of us are going to stand before God Almighty.

00:47:33.579 --> 00:47:38.979
Listen, I'm thankful this morning that I will not stand at the great white throne judgment.

00:47:38.979 --> 00:47:42.619
In Revelation chapter 20, God paints the picture of that great white throne judgment.

00:47:42.619 --> 00:47:43.739
That's for lost people.

00:47:43.739 --> 00:47:48.339
I will not be there because I've trusted Jesus Christ as my personal Savior, and if you've

00:47:48.339 --> 00:47:52.059
been saved this morning by the grace of God, you will not be at the great white throne

00:47:52.059 --> 00:47:55.419
judgment either as a subject of that judgment.

00:47:55.419 --> 00:47:57.699
I actually believe that we'll be there.

00:47:57.699 --> 00:48:00.099
We'll see it.

00:48:00.099 --> 00:48:03.459
That's why right after, in chapter 21, it says He's going to wipe away all tears.

00:48:03.459 --> 00:48:08.699
There's a great connection there.

00:48:08.699 --> 00:48:11.779
If that doesn't motivate you to tell your loved ones about Jesus, I don't know what

00:48:11.779 --> 00:48:16.499
would, to tell your neighbors, your coworkers, even your enemies.

00:48:16.499 --> 00:48:22.899
I don't want the greatest enemy to have to stand at the great white throne judgment and

00:48:22.899 --> 00:48:25.839
be sent to the lake of fire forever.

00:48:25.839 --> 00:48:31.059
But as Christians, we're going to stand at the bema seat, the judgment seat of Christ.

00:48:31.059 --> 00:48:38.299
Our works, what we did for Christ, wood, hay stubble, gold, silver, precious stone.

00:48:38.299 --> 00:48:41.579
Burned up or not.

00:48:41.579 --> 00:48:43.259
Receive a crown.

00:48:43.380 --> 00:48:47.739
Paul mentions in 2 Timothy 4 and verse 9 that he knew there was a crown of righteousness

00:48:47.739 --> 00:48:48.739
that was waiting for him.

00:48:48.739 --> 00:48:51.419
Listen, we're going to stand before Christ one day.

00:48:51.419 --> 00:48:53.979
We're going to have some discipline.

00:48:53.979 --> 00:48:57.099
You say, but those things that, those are enjoyable things.

00:48:57.099 --> 00:48:59.859
Listen, if they're not pleasing God, we ought to flee them.

00:48:59.859 --> 00:49:06.979
We ought to follow after righteousness, faith, charity, peace.

00:49:06.979 --> 00:49:07.979
Why?

00:49:07.979 --> 00:49:10.500
Because there's got to be discipline in our lives.

00:49:10.739 --> 00:49:14.859
If we're going to be a good soldier, we've got to be disciplined.

00:49:14.859 --> 00:49:19.099
Because one day I'm going to stand before him and so are you.

00:49:19.099 --> 00:49:24.899
And I want to hear, well done, thou good and faithful servant.

00:49:24.899 --> 00:49:29.380
I heard somebody say this recently, you're only going to hear well done if you have done

00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:33.099
well.

00:49:33.099 --> 00:49:36.820
So deep, but so true.

00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:39.659
This morning, a good soldier is disciplined.

00:49:39.659 --> 00:49:40.659
Let's pray.

00:49:40.659 --> 00:49:41.659
Father, we love you.

00:49:41.659 --> 00:49:42.659
We thank you for loving us.

00:49:42.659 --> 00:49:43.659
Thank you for your word.

00:49:43.659 --> 00:49:53.820
I pray, God, that you would help us to truly have that goal to be a good soldier.

00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:59.380
Not to be content with simply being a soldier, but to be a good soldier of Jesus Christ.

00:49:59.380 --> 00:50:07.280
I pray, God, that you would help us to live lives that are marked by discipline.

00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:11.020
Help us to understand there are some things that we need to flee, some things we need

00:50:11.020 --> 00:50:14.780
to follow, some things we need to avoid.

00:50:14.780 --> 00:50:19.140
I pray that you'd move and work in hearts and lives, that you'd help us to be doers

00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:23.540
of the Word and not hearers only.

00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:26.140
Well thank you for what you'll do, for it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:50:26.140 --> 00:50:27.700
Would you stand with me?

00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:30.900
Eyes are bowed, eyes are closed.

00:50:30.900 --> 00:50:33.780
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano this morning and as she does, the altar is

00:50:33.780 --> 00:50:35.140
open.

00:50:35.140 --> 00:50:38.940
Perhaps God used His Word this morning to speak to you in a specific way.

00:50:38.940 --> 00:50:44.060
Maybe there's some things that you need to flee, you need to follow, you need to avoid,

00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:47.620
you need to have some discipline.

00:50:47.620 --> 00:50:50.260
This morning, as Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
