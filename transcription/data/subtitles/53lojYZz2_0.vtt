WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.839
is gonna fit perfect with the message on Sunday morning.

00:00:03.839 --> 00:00:06.239
And I am so thankful for God's word

00:00:06.239 --> 00:00:08.479
and to God be the glory.

00:00:08.479 --> 00:00:11.760
The Bible is a precious treasure, amen.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:12.680
It truly is.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.239
It is a prized possession.

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:17.760
I am so thankful to have God's word.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.100
It is God's word to humanity.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.959
And what a blessing to think that the omnipotent,

00:00:23.959 --> 00:00:28.200
all-knowing, all-wise, all-powerful God

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.219
chose to give us his word.

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:32.060
It's amazing.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.240
We believe this morning that the Bible

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.919
was given by inspiration.

00:00:35.919 --> 00:00:37.639
We believe this morning that God

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:41.119
has providentially preserved his word.

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:46.119
We can and we should have confidence in this precious book.

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:48.119
I'm so thankful.

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:50.580
In that song, I guess, the bridge,

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.540
if you're using the right terminology for the music.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.159
So church of God, stand and proclaim, why?

00:00:57.159 --> 00:00:59.759
Because God's word changes lives.

00:00:59.759 --> 00:01:02.119
That's why at the end of 2 Timothy chapter four,

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:05.760
the charge is given to Timothy, preach the word.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.160
Don't go and meddle on all these other non-essential things

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.800
and stuff that's, no, preach God's word.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.199
Because the reality is God's word touches

00:01:16.199 --> 00:01:19.379
on every aspect of life.

00:01:19.379 --> 00:01:22.959
And so often people will use terminologies of,

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:25.120
well, that's a social issue,

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.040
or that's a political issue,

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.879
or that's a personal issue,

00:01:28.879 --> 00:01:30.319
or that's a, you fill in the blank,

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:32.680
whatever word they wanna use.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.480
It's a cultural thing.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.839
No, understand with me this morning

00:01:36.839 --> 00:01:39.000
that as we preach the Bible,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.379
and as we preach Bible truth,

00:01:41.379 --> 00:01:43.940
all of those things find themselves

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.239
within the pages of the Bible,

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:48.440
and it is a spiritual matter.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.599
It's not a cultural war.

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:52.239
It's a spiritual war.

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:54.120
It's not a social situation.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.319
No, it's a Bible situation.

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:57.760
It's not a political thing.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.839
No, it's a Bible thing, amen?

00:02:00.839 --> 00:02:05.839
And listen, I'm excited that God has given us his word.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.440
I'm excited this morning that God's word changes lives.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.279
And what a blessing.

00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:17.240
There are many reasons that God has given us the Bible.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.279
I would argue that primarily God gave us the Bible

00:02:21.279 --> 00:02:24.479
so that he could make himself known to humanity.

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:28.279
That, I believe, I would argue would be the primary reason

00:02:28.279 --> 00:02:30.800
God has recorded for us history,

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.520
historical truth in his word.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.320
I do not believe that's the primary reason

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.160
that God gave us the Bible.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.119
I believe the primary reason that God gave us the Bible

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:44.199
is so that man would understand who God is,

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:47.740
and that man would understand who he is.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.720
See, God's word reveals that.

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.320
There are many people around the globe today

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.660
that have an idea that there is a God that exists,

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.279
but if they do not have the written word of God,

00:03:00.279 --> 00:03:04.440
they do not understand who that God is

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.800
and what his attributes are.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.059
And we find that God has given to us

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:14.000
this precious book, the Bible.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.080
We find that another reason,

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.619
and not necessarily the second reason,

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:20.580
just another reason,

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.080
and the focus of our study this morning

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.979
in 1 Timothy chapter number six,

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:27.899
I believe that God gave us his word

00:03:27.899 --> 00:03:31.940
in order to shape our worldview,

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.179
in order to shape our worldview.

00:03:34.179 --> 00:03:37.660
I'm going to kind of word it, express it this way

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.820
this morning as we deal with the subject matter,

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.860
and I've used for our text or our title this morning,

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.699
developing biblical perspective,

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:49.779
developing biblical perspective.

00:03:49.779 --> 00:03:51.940
Before we get into the text this morning,

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.220
I want to read to you two studies

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.139
that have taken place with regard to worldview

00:03:57.139 --> 00:03:58.460
and just kind of summarize.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:01.979
One of them was done in 2003,

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:03.139
and it was titled this,

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:06.820
a biblical worldview has a radical effect

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.460
on a person's life.

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.339
I agree, because the Bible changes everything.

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:16.179
Your opinion or your perspective on life

00:04:16.179 --> 00:04:18.459
cannot just come from culture,

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.660
it must come from the Bible, amen.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.579
Your perspective on morals, which is a huge category,

00:04:26.579 --> 00:04:28.739
but your perspective on morals

00:04:28.739 --> 00:04:32.100
does not come from culture or society,

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.220
it must come from the Bible.

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.420
And so a worldview, a biblical worldview

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.220
has a radical effect on a person's life.

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.660
On December 3rd, 2003, this study was done,

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.179
and here's what they said,

00:04:42.179 --> 00:04:45.500
only 4% of the adults that were surveyed

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.579
have a biblical worldview

00:04:47.579 --> 00:04:52.579
as the basis of their decision-making, 4% in 2003.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.540
Now, how many of you can remember 2003?

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.500
The morals in 2003 were a little bit better

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.339
than they are today?

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:03.779
In our society, in our culture, okay?

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:07.500
21 years ago, there's a lot that has changed in 21 years.

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.459
Now, here are the, a biblical worldview,

00:05:11.459 --> 00:05:12.779
here's how a biblical worldview,

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:13.899
according to this study,

00:05:13.899 --> 00:05:18.899
was defined as believing that absolute moral truths exist,

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.579
that such truth is defined by the Bible.

00:05:24.579 --> 00:05:26.940
Here were the six things that they said

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.579
that would define whether or not

00:05:28.579 --> 00:05:30.500
somebody had a biblical worldview.

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.980
Number one, that Jesus Christ lived a sinless life.

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.220
Number two, that God is the all-powerful

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.619
and all-knowing creator of the universe,

00:05:41.619 --> 00:05:45.059
and he still rules today.

00:05:45.059 --> 00:05:48.019
Number three, God is the, excuse me, number three,

00:05:48.019 --> 00:05:53.019
salvation is a free gift from God and cannot be earned.

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:55.500
Number four, Satan is real.

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:59.619
Number five, a Christian has a responsibility

00:05:59.619 --> 00:06:03.420
to share their faith in Christ with other people.

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:06.260
And number six, the Bible is accurate

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.459
in all of its teachings.

00:06:09.459 --> 00:06:11.299
Now, none of that that I just read to you

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:15.820
seems extreme, but those are the six points of criteria,

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:19.619
if you will, that were used in this particular study

00:06:19.619 --> 00:06:22.739
to determine if an individual has a biblical worldview,

00:06:22.739 --> 00:06:25.660
and they said only 4% of adults have a biblical worldview

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.140
based on that criteria.

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:29.899
What in the world?

00:06:29.899 --> 00:06:32.059
Here's some more statistics.

00:06:32.059 --> 00:06:33.779
Here's what the person said.

00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:36.100
Everyone has a worldview.

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.179
Everyone has a worldview.

00:06:38.179 --> 00:06:42.019
Relatively few people have a biblical worldview,

00:06:42.019 --> 00:06:45.619
even among devoutly religious people.

00:06:45.619 --> 00:06:50.059
The survey discovered that only 9% of born-again Christians

00:06:50.059 --> 00:06:52.579
have such a perspective in life.

00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:55.619
Only nine, but they said they were born-again Christians,

00:06:55.619 --> 00:07:00.619
and only 9% would say yes to those six questions

00:07:01.299 --> 00:07:03.940
among some quote-unquote denominations.

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:07.179
They said Protestants were the highest at 7%.

00:07:07.179 --> 00:07:09.940
Mainline Protestant churches, I'm not sure the distinction

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:12.380
on how they mentioned that, was at 2%.

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:16.820
Catholics were at less than 1.5% of 1%.

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:18.980
Baptists, 8%.

00:07:20.339 --> 00:07:21.179
That's terrible.

00:07:22.059 --> 00:07:22.980
It's terrible.

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:26.739
Here's another study, May 12th, 2022.

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:29.579
That was just a couple of years ago,

00:07:29.579 --> 00:07:32.299
and here's what the title of this particular study was.

00:07:32.299 --> 00:07:35.619
It says a new study shows shocking lack

00:07:35.619 --> 00:07:40.619
of biblical worldview among American pastors.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.019
Among American pastors.

00:07:46.019 --> 00:07:49.980
The pastor's supposed to preach the word.

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:52.660
He better believe the word if he's gonna preach the word,

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:56.500
but the study in May of 2022 says that it's a shocking lack

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:58.299
of biblical worldview among American pastors.

00:07:58.299 --> 00:08:03.100
In fact, slightly more than a third, 37% of pastors

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:08.100
that were surveyed had a biblical worldview, 37%.

00:08:08.459 --> 00:08:10.660
That means 63% of those surveyed

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:13.899
do not have a biblical worldview.

00:08:13.899 --> 00:08:15.140
This is a problem.

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:18.100
Biblical worldview varies by pastoral position.

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:22.540
Senior pastors had a 41% of those that were surveyed.

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:25.500
41% of the senior pastors had a biblical worldview,

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.619
but here's the concern.

00:08:27.619 --> 00:08:30.899
Those that work with young people, youth pastors,

00:08:30.899 --> 00:08:35.900
children's pastors, 12% had a biblical worldview.

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:37.700
Now here's the problem.

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:40.340
They're teaching young people,

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:43.539
and 12% of them have a biblical worldview,

00:08:43.539 --> 00:08:46.580
according to the survey that's before me this morning.

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:49.739
So 41% of the senior pastors, but you look at,

00:08:49.739 --> 00:08:51.539
listen, the senior pastor in the churches

00:08:51.539 --> 00:08:55.059
that would have multiple pastors such as that situation,

00:08:55.059 --> 00:08:57.700
the youth pastor, the children's church pastor,

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:00.020
they have much more influence in the lives

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:02.460
of those children than the senior pastor does,

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:04.059
and the senior pastor only has,

00:09:04.059 --> 00:09:06.580
only 41% of them have a biblical worldview,

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:08.979
and then 12, 13% of the,

00:09:08.979 --> 00:09:11.340
one of them was 12% for the youth pastor

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:14.140
and 13% for the children's pastors,

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:15.659
but listen, they're teaching the kids,

00:09:15.659 --> 00:09:16.500
and here's what they said.

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:20.099
A person's worldview primarily develops

00:09:20.099 --> 00:09:21.460
before the age of 13.

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:24.659
Think about that for a moment.

00:09:24.659 --> 00:09:27.580
An individual, they estimate that their worldview

00:09:27.619 --> 00:09:30.340
will be developed before they're 13,

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:32.419
and then it goes through a period of refinement

00:09:32.419 --> 00:09:34.580
during their teens and 20s, so on and so forth,

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:35.780
but think about this.

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:39.619
If the children's pastors and the youth pastors in churches

00:09:39.619 --> 00:09:42.380
don't have a biblical worldview,

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:44.419
and they're teaching young people,

00:09:44.419 --> 00:09:47.340
how are they gonna have a biblical worldview?

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:48.419
It's a huge problem.

00:09:51.099 --> 00:09:52.419
I'm gonna, there's several.

00:09:52.419 --> 00:09:53.380
Well, let me deal with this.

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:57.059
Syncretism, which is the blending of ideas and applications

00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:59.539
from a variety of holistic worldviews

00:09:59.539 --> 00:10:00.580
into a unique but.

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:08.500
inconsistent combination represents the preference among most of those that were surveyed.

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:11.980
So they say, well, we like this idea and we like that idea and we like this one, we're

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:16.620
going to kind of blend it all together and we're going to, no, we've got to come to

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:22.740
the Bible and we've got to develop our worldview based upon the truth of God's Word.

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:30.340
And so syncretism becomes that idea, the primary, in fact, 62% of those that were surveyed said

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:34.140
that they would hold a syncretistic worldview.

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:38.720
The American culture, so not just the pastors that were surveyed, but then others that were

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:46.240
surveyed, they said 88% of those that were surveyed would say that syncretism would be

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:50.700
a good way of defining their worldview.

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:56.980
The author of this particular study contacted another group that does a lot of studies and

00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:00.380
asked some questions about what they had discovered, because quite honestly, they were

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:03.860
shocked by the results of their survey.

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:09.940
And here's what one person said, you cannot fix something that you do not know is broken.

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:12.000
And I think that's a good perspective.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.900
You can't fix it if you don't know it's broken.

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:18.140
Listen, we have a problem in our churches in America today.

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:22.140
There's a problem in our churches in America today, and it ends this way.

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:27.300
It certainly seems that if America is going to experience a spiritual revival, that awakening

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:31.940
is not just needed amongst the masses, but it's needed in the pulpits as well.

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:35.700
Oh, how true, oh, how true.

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:40.980
This morning as we come to 1 Timothy chapter number 6, we find this thought of developing

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:42.340
biblical perspective.

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:46.540
Notice the Bible says this in verse number 1, let as many servants as are under the yoke

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:51.540
count their own masters worthy of all honor, that the name of God and His doctrine be not

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:52.540
blasphemed.

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:57.340
And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them because they are brethren,

00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:03.460
but rather do them service because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:05.980
these things teach and exhort.

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:09.500
My God's grace, we'll get through verse number 10 this morning, but let's dig right into

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:10.700
the message this morning.

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:16.260
Number one, if you're taking notes, a biblical perspective on conversion.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:17.780
We see that in verses 1 and 2.

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:21.340
I believe that as you look at the passage of scripture, obviously the context of verses

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:25.340
1 and 2 are dealing with the relationship between masters and servants.

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:29.500
There's a huge issue at this particular time within the Roman Empire of slavery.

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:32.660
We can look at it historically and see it and understand it.

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:35.420
And we see it across the globe, by the way.

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:39.700
It's not something that was just there within the Roman Empire or within America or any

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:41.020
other nation.

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:45.220
We find that the children of Israel, they were slaves, they were bondmen in Egypt, so

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:46.220
on and so forth.

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:51.140
And so many times today as we look at a passage of scripture like this, we deal with it more

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:55.740
as trying to make application between employees and employers.

00:12:55.740 --> 00:13:00.540
And I think that there is reason to make application, but we ought to be honest with the original

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:06.620
context and content of what is being described, and it was absolutely with regard to that

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:11.100
relationship between the servants and the masters.

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:16.260
Now remember in our message last week, we talked about the conduct of the elder, and

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:20.020
we talked about several things with regard to his conduct, but one thing that we spoke

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:26.740
about specifically is that they are to not only, they're not only to seek for and to

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:32.980
follow after and to pursue purity, but they are to reject partiality.

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:37.700
And we find that in verse number 21 of chapter 5, doing nothing by partiality.

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:41.540
And so we come to this text of scripture, and we find that there's instruction that's

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:46.380
given with regard to servants and masters and how they interact with one another.

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:50.700
And notice in verse number 1, it says, let as many servants as are under the yoke count

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:56.700
their own masters worthy of all honor, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed.

00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:01.240
Now I begin to look at this text of scripture in verses 1 and 2, and I begin to try to analyze

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:06.620
and figure out what God is communicating to us with regard to this perspective that we

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:08.460
ought to have.

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:13.940
And the reality is that the masters are human beings that are in need of Christ.

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:15.260
Amen?

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:21.860
Listen, every single person that walks upon this face of this earth, every person that

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:29.220
you come in contact with is a person, an individual that Christ loves and died for.

00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:31.240
Every single person.

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:33.100
God loves them and God died for them.

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:35.260
Aren't you thankful for that?

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:39.420
And this morning, as we look at this text of scripture, he says to the servants, no

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:44.860
doubt, he's writing to those that would be saved, and he says there that they're to count

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:49.500
their own masters worthy of all honor, and then he says this, that the name of God and

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:54.020
his doctrine be not blasphemed.

00:14:54.020 --> 00:15:01.660
So how we interact one with another is going to go a long way to those individuals understanding

00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:07.260
who God is and what we believe, the doctrine in his name.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:12.240
And it says that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed.

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:18.680
How does our behavior, how does our interaction one with another communicate to someone else

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:23.160
who God is and the truth that we believe?

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:25.640
See, it cannot be inconsistent.

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:31.680
I've said many times over the years from this pulpit that your behavior will impact your,

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:34.320
your belief will impact your behavior.

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:37.920
What you believe will impact how you behave.

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:46.800
But let me say this, how you behave reveals what you believe.

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:52.280
How you behave reveals what you believe.

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:58.280
So how these individuals were going to behave in this situation, in the circumstance where

00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:02.800
they found themselves, was going to go a long way to being able to communicate what they

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:08.520
truly believe, not necessarily verbally, but through their actions.

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:12.960
We find that in verse number two, it says, and they that have believing masters, that's

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:17.400
why we have the understanding that in verse number one, there were some that had masters

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:18.400
that were not saved.

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:22.080
They weren't Christians, but yet there were some that had believing masters, and notice

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:27.040
what it says, let them not despise them because they are brethren, but rather do them service

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:31.860
because they are faithful and beloved partakers of the benefit.

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:34.780
These things teach and exhort.

00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:36.580
We're talking about a biblical perspective on conversion.

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:39.520
Let me give you a few thoughts this morning.

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:44.500
Number one, as a sub-point, the necessity of conversion.

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:48.140
You understand this morning that all men must be born again.

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:55.940
When Jesus was speaking to Nicodemus, he said, marvel not that I say unto thee, by the way,

00:16:55.940 --> 00:17:00.500
I like the old, I like the these and the yees, amen.

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:03.420
If you weren't in the Sunday school class that I taught back in the beginning of the

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:09.220
year, you might not understand all of that subject or that comment, but praise God for

00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:14.980
those third-person personal pronouns and the understanding, the use of them, whether they're

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:18.860
singular or plural, those singular, plural pronouns.

00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:19.860
Praise the Lord.

00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:28.900
He says, I say unto thee, singular, Nicodemus, ye, plural, must be born again.

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:29.900
Why?

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:31.920
Because all men must be born again.

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:33.500
You must be born again.

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:34.940
You must be born again.

00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:41.700
See, when we develop a biblical perspective on conversion, it must start with the necessity

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:43.380
of conversion.

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:45.540
All people must be born again.

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:51.740
Listen, Jesus Christ said, the second point, if you're taking notes, the means of conversion.

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:53.460
There's only one way to be saved.

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:56.660
Jesus Christ said, I am the way, the truth, and the life.

00:17:56.660 --> 00:18:00.300
No man cometh unto the Father but by me.

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:05.140
Peter, who walked with the Lord Jesus Christ during his earthly ministry and learned and

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:09.300
heard so many things, when he stands up on the day of Pentecost, excuse me, after the

00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:13.540
day of Pentecost, he preaches there, but then there's the miracle in chapter number four,

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:18.580
and he's standing before the religious leaders of that miracle that was brought into question

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:22.980
in chapter four that took place in chapter three, and we find that he says, there is

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:27.660
no other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved.

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:28.660
What is that name?

00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:32.140
What's the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth?

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:33.340
Praise the Lord.

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:38.420
Listen, we have to understand when we develop this perspective, a biblical perspective on

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:41.540
conversion that the necessity of conversion, it's all men.

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:45.920
The means of conversion, there's only one way, it's Jesus alone.

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:49.580
And then the miracle of conversion, they're a new man.

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:51.940
If any man be in Christ, he's a new creature.

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:52.940
All things are passed away.

00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:54.500
Behold, all things are become new.

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:58.940
Listen, this is developing a biblical perspective on conversion.

00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:06.299
The reality this morning is that we must reject the idea that some have on, well, you know,

00:19:06.299 --> 00:19:08.299
as long as you're sincere, everyone's going to make it.

00:19:08.299 --> 00:19:10.940
I mean, just do the best you can do and just be sincere.

00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:16.100
I'm sorry, as much as that might sound pleasant and acceptable to someone, the problem is

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:19.460
that it doesn't align with this book.

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:25.820
And so the problem I'm not trying to take and to contend with someone on basis which

00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:31.380
are lines that might somebody draw that would be denominational or something else, but really

00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:34.619
the reality is it comes down to the Bible.

00:19:34.619 --> 00:19:38.299
Here's what God said in His Word.

00:19:38.299 --> 00:19:45.619
The problem in society, in this society, in any society, the problems in society will

00:19:45.619 --> 00:19:54.900
only truly be corrected as the society receives and responds to the truth of the gospel.

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:57.100
It's the only way.

00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:00.140
Its residents are converted, born again.

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:06.420
That's the only way that you're going to solve the problems in a society.

00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:08.500
Do we have problems in our society today?

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:12.740
Oh my, the list could go on and on of the problems in America.

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:16.340
I said at the very start of the service this morning, I'm thankful, listen, America is

00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:17.340
not perfect.

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:23.880
We have plenty of problems in our nation and we could talk about them for hours and days.

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:28.860
But those problems are not going to be resolved politically.

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:32.040
They're not going to be resolved economically.

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:36.520
They're not going to be, no, no, they're resolved biblically.

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:42.900
It is absolutely imperative that God's people have a biblical perspective on conversion

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:51.100
and understand how that as a society receives the gospel of Jesus Christ, responds in faith,

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:58.600
those people are converted, then we can have resolution to so many of our problems.

00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:04.400
Remember the truth, that salvation brings transformation and not reformation, I quoted

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:09.060
already from 2 Corinthians 5 and verse 17, but I want you to look over at 1 Corinthians

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:11.380
chapter number 2.

00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:14.700
And I want you to look at this, maybe you need to underline it in your Bible, maybe

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:19.000
you need to work on memorizing it, I could quote it to you this morning, but I want you

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.300
to see it.

00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:26.600
Because the reality is the truth of this verse of scripture will help us in understanding

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:29.480
how we interact one with another.

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:36.400
Sometimes, and I've said this from the pulpit in recent years, we expect, believers expect,

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:40.060
that non-believers will live and act biblically.

00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:42.960
I don't know why we think that.

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:44.560
I don't know why we think that.

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:50.320
I've said at the follow-up statement to that, it's hard enough to get God's people to live

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:53.780
and act biblically, amen?

00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:56.260
But notice the truth of 1 Corinthians 2 and verse 14.

00:21:56.260 --> 00:22:00.420
The Bible says that the natural man, do you understand what God means when He says the

00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:01.420
natural man?

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:04.860
That's the man that's not been born again, the man that's not converted, the man that's

00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:05.860
lost.

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:11.780
It says, but the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God.

00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:17.840
For they are, notice what it says, foolishness unto him, neither can he know them, why?

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:22.740
Because they are spiritually discerned.

00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:28.380
The natural man is spiritually dead, amen?

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:31.180
That's where I was before I trusted Christ as my Savior.

00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:36.940
I was dead spiritually, and that's where you were before you trusted Christ as your Savior.

00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:41.600
And let me remind you this morning that if you can think back however long it was before

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:47.160
you trusted Christ as your Savior, you did not think and act biblically.

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:51.200
The truth of this book was not something that you understood, why?

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:58.040
Because the truth is spiritually discerned, and a spiritually dead person, a natural man,

00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:02.240
cannot discern the spiritual truth.

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:06.600
And we run around sometimes as believers, and we want to know, why don't these lost

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:09.960
people think and act biblically?

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:14.000
Because the truth of God's Word is foreign to them.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.000
They cannot.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.980
I don't think any of us would get upset this morning if there was someone that came into

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:26.860
our building that was blind, that could not see, they were blind.

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:29.500
It wasn't just that they had bad sight, they were blind.

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:34.660
I don't think one of us would be upset if they bumped into you.

00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:36.540
We would understand that they can't see.

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:40.780
Do you understand that people are blind spiritually?

00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:45.580
After the great miracle in John, when Jesus healed the man that was born blind, after

00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:49.100
all of the dialogue that takes place, and remember those religious leaders, they came

00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:53.020
back and forth and back and forth, and finally that man got upset because he said, look,

00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:56.020
all I know is that I was blind and now I see.

00:23:56.020 --> 00:24:00.540
Like I can't explain to you everything that happened, but I know I was, and I know I am.

00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:06.020
And so we think about the song that Newton wrote about the truth of amazing grace, I

00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:08.300
was blind but now I see.

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:09.300
Praise the Lord.

00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:13.380
But those religious leaders at the end of the text, they said this to Jesus, are we

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:15.780
blind also?

00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:22.780
And the answer was yes, you're not blind physically, but you're blind spiritually.

00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:28.920
This morning, we must develop a biblical perspective on conversion, we must understand this morning

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:33.740
the necessity of conversion, all men must be born again, we must understand this morning

00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:38.380
the means of conversion, it's only through Jesus Christ, and we must understand the miracle

00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:39.380
of conversion.

00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:40.380
They're a new man.

00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:45.700
Listen, there was a Baptist church, I listened to the audio clip of a Baptist church in New

00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:51.620
York City, this is probably eight, nine years ago, where a pastor in a Baptist church in

00:24:51.620 --> 00:25:00.860
New York City stood up and said in his church, this idea that Jesus Christ is the only way

00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:06.100
to salvation is false, and Jesus never made the claim.

00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:14.540
Now when he made that statement, you could hear the applause of the people in the audience.

00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:20.300
And I sit there and I listen, how in the world, listen, I hope this morning that if

00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:27.100
me or any other person stands behind this pulpit and makes a heretical statement like

00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:29.900
that, you would kick them out.

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:36.340
Because Jesus said I am the way, the truth, and the life, no man cometh unto the Father

00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:37.340
but by me.

00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:42.900
You say, oh, you're so narrow-minded, no, we just want to be biblical, just want to

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:44.260
be biblical.

00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:49.700
Verse number two this morning, a biblical perspective on contending.

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:54.580
You know, God gave us a responsibility to contend for the faith, and Jude, there's only

00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:59.940
one chapter, verse number three, it says that you would earnestly contend for the faith.

00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:04.420
That faith that was once delivered, by the way, I'm thankful for our spiritual forefathers

00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:10.940
that were faithful to contend for the faith and allow us to have the truth that we have

00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:17.500
this morning, many that died, that gave up all that they had so that we could have a

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:18.500
Bible.

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:24.380
It's amazing when you read their stories and understand their commitment to Christ.

00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:29.180
We've been given this opportunity, and we've been given this responsibility to contend

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:33.200
for the faith, and we must have a biblical perspective when it comes to contending.

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:37.860
We find in our text back in First Timothy, notice the Bible says in chapter six and verse

00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:45.580
number two, the end of that verse, it says this, these things teach and exhort.

00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:50.620
So when we begin to understand a perspective, a biblical perspective on contending, we understand

00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:53.000
that there must be a teaching aspect.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:58.180
It must be that we are giving the truth of God's word, that we are contending.

00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:03.860
But notice how verse number three begins, if any man teach otherwise.

00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:08.780
Now in this passage of Scripture, or in this book in First Timothy, we've already dealt

00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:15.000
with the fact that God has revealed to Paul and then to Timothy that there were false

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.100
teachers in Ephesus.

00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:22.340
There were people that were not teaching the truth, and then Timothy had the responsibility

00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:29.780
to stand up and to contend, to ensure that sound doctrine was being taught, was there,

00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:30.980
and it was prevalent in the church.

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:35.700
And so we find that throughout the church age, throughout the history of the church,

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:38.420
there have been false teachers.

00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:40.460
There continue to be false teachers.

00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:42.580
They're abundant online.

00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:47.780
You can find them with just a click away of all of the false teachers that are available

00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:52.840
for you to be exposed to, and we dealt with in First Timothy, chapter four, the importance

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:54.880
of our diet.

00:27:54.880 --> 00:28:00.260
We must be selective in what we read and what we listen to because we must get that which

00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:04.460
is going to be biblical, that's going to promote sound doctrine.

00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:08.480
We understand that we must be scriptural in what we're listening to.

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:12.700
You say, well, this guy doesn't believe in creation, he doesn't believe in the virgin

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:17.220
birth of Christ, he doesn't believe in the, then don't listen to him, amen?

00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:21.060
You say, well, there was this one thing that he said that was good.

00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:25.420
I guarantee you that you can find somebody that believes that God's the creator and that

00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:31.140
believes that Jesus was virgin born that also said that really good thing, but it's

00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:34.859
not going to mess you up in other areas, amen?

00:28:34.859 --> 00:28:38.460
And so we find this truth, he says, if any man teach otherwise, there are going to be

00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:43.540
those that are going to teach otherwise, and he says, if any man teach otherwise and consent

00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:46.739
not, notice what he says, to wholesome words.

00:28:46.739 --> 00:28:51.820
It's interesting that he says, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ and to the doctrine

00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:54.739
which is according to godliness.

00:28:54.739 --> 00:29:00.780
He mentioned in chapter number four, in verse number six, that if thou put the breath and

00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:05.340
remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished

00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:12.100
up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained.

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:15.580
So these false teachers, these that would teach otherwise, they're consenting not to

00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:19.859
those wholesome words, they're consenting not to those words of the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:29:19.859 --> 00:29:22.460
to the doctrine which is according to godliness.

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:27.220
Notice in verses four and five, he says, he is proud knowing nothing, but doting about

00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:33.420
questions and strifes of words whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings, perverse

00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:41.140
disputings of men of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness

00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:44.260
from such withdraw thyself.

00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:49.500
Look over at verses 20 and 21, the end of the chapter, the end of this first book.

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:56.900
First Paul says, O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane

00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:59.739
and vain babblings and oppositions of science.

00:29:59.739 --> 00:30:03.619
falsely so called, which some professing have erred,

00:30:03.619 --> 00:30:07.619
concerning the faith, grace be with thee, amen.

00:30:07.619 --> 00:30:09.779
So God gives us in these few verses,

00:30:09.779 --> 00:30:12.299
obviously you can look at a whole other,

00:30:12.299 --> 00:30:13.999
several other portions of scripture

00:30:13.999 --> 00:30:17.419
to develop a robust biblical perspective on contending,

00:30:17.419 --> 00:30:19.619
but I see it given to us here

00:30:19.619 --> 00:30:21.819
in 1 Timothy chapter number six.

00:30:21.819 --> 00:30:23.459
Begin to think about this subject matter

00:30:23.459 --> 00:30:26.819
of developing a biblical perspective on contending.

00:30:26.819 --> 00:30:28.619
And the reality is that you look here

00:30:28.619 --> 00:30:30.479
and it says in verse two, the end of the verse,

00:30:30.479 --> 00:30:33.339
teach these things, excuse me,

00:30:33.339 --> 00:30:35.579
these things teach and exhort.

00:30:35.579 --> 00:30:36.879
But then at the end of verse number five,

00:30:36.879 --> 00:30:39.379
it says from such withdraw thyself.

00:30:39.379 --> 00:30:40.219
You see that?

00:30:41.499 --> 00:30:42.619
You say, is there a contradiction?

00:30:42.619 --> 00:30:45.499
No, there's wisdom.

00:30:45.499 --> 00:30:46.999
There's wisdom.

00:30:46.999 --> 00:30:50.059
See, where is it that Timothy is to teach

00:30:50.059 --> 00:30:51.599
these things teach and exhort?

00:30:51.599 --> 00:30:52.439
Where is it?

00:30:52.439 --> 00:30:54.939
Well, in the house of God, right?

00:30:54.939 --> 00:30:57.739
The house of God is the pillar and ground of the truth.

00:30:59.379 --> 00:31:01.259
But then those that are false teachers

00:31:01.259 --> 00:31:03.179
that are teaching according to what we see here,

00:31:03.179 --> 00:31:06.539
he says from such withdraw thyself.

00:31:06.539 --> 00:31:07.539
You understand this morning,

00:31:07.539 --> 00:31:10.719
I'm not trying to win arguments with lost people.

00:31:10.719 --> 00:31:13.579
And if you try to, you're gonna find yourself frustrated.

00:31:15.179 --> 00:31:17.139
Frustrated, God never called you

00:31:17.139 --> 00:31:19.659
to win an argument with a lost person.

00:31:19.659 --> 00:31:22.659
He didn't call you to win an argument with a lost person.

00:31:22.659 --> 00:31:23.579
You know, the amazing thing,

00:31:23.579 --> 00:31:24.979
there've been times that I've engaged

00:31:24.979 --> 00:31:26.179
in conversation with people,

00:31:26.179 --> 00:31:29.059
they had no answer for the biblical truth

00:31:29.059 --> 00:31:30.259
that was before them,

00:31:30.259 --> 00:31:32.979
but they still would not bend the knee.

00:31:32.979 --> 00:31:34.619
Happens all the time.

00:31:34.619 --> 00:31:37.219
Listen, I'm not gonna go ride my bike or do whatever,

00:31:37.219 --> 00:31:39.019
try to go find people to argue with

00:31:39.019 --> 00:31:41.159
and try to have debates with and so on and so forth.

00:31:41.159 --> 00:31:42.139
No, from such withdraw,

00:31:42.139 --> 00:31:46.239
avoiding these profane questions, vain babblings.

00:31:47.059 --> 00:31:49.979
They gender according to what we find in chapter number one,

00:31:49.979 --> 00:31:52.539
questions instead of answers.

00:31:52.539 --> 00:31:54.499
They, according to chapter number one,

00:31:54.499 --> 00:31:56.019
as we looked at it earlier,

00:31:56.859 --> 00:31:57.699
it says that they've swerved,

00:31:57.699 --> 00:31:59.459
but it says that they, as they're teaching,

00:31:59.459 --> 00:32:03.579
as those that are teaching things that are not biblical,

00:32:03.579 --> 00:32:05.419
that are foreign to God's word,

00:32:05.419 --> 00:32:09.379
he says that they use vain jangling, useless talk.

00:32:10.859 --> 00:32:11.859
Now listen, this morning,

00:32:11.859 --> 00:32:14.879
when we develop a biblical perspective on contending,

00:32:14.879 --> 00:32:17.419
listen, it is not my job,

00:32:17.419 --> 00:32:18.699
and I'm never gonna do it,

00:32:18.699 --> 00:32:22.619
to go to some other place of worship, quote unquote,

00:32:22.619 --> 00:32:25.659
and go into that place and try to contend with those people

00:32:25.659 --> 00:32:28.339
about what they supposedly believe.

00:32:28.339 --> 00:32:29.759
It's not my job.

00:32:29.759 --> 00:32:32.739
In fact, I'll give you a real life illustration.

00:32:32.739 --> 00:32:35.099
At Ronnie, there was a situation

00:32:35.099 --> 00:32:37.619
when Ronnie's mom passed away,

00:32:37.619 --> 00:32:39.899
that someone said to me, would you like to speak here?

00:32:39.899 --> 00:32:42.139
No, I don't, I'm not interested.

00:32:42.139 --> 00:32:43.819
Said, pastor, what a great opportunity.

00:32:43.819 --> 00:32:46.419
No, it's not a great opportunity, it's foolishness.

00:32:47.899 --> 00:32:51.459
So I had an opportunity to speak at the graveside,

00:32:51.459 --> 00:32:54.339
and man, I was sick, it was crazy,

00:32:54.339 --> 00:32:55.179
I thought it was just allergies,

00:32:55.699 --> 00:32:56.539
I didn't know what was going on with me,

00:32:56.539 --> 00:32:57.579
I could barely talk,

00:32:57.579 --> 00:33:00.379
and I gave the gospel as I prayed.

00:33:00.379 --> 00:33:01.939
Some of our folks were there.

00:33:02.819 --> 00:33:03.979
It was a very interesting situation.

00:33:03.979 --> 00:33:07.739
Listen, I'm not there to win an argument with that person.

00:33:07.739 --> 00:33:12.099
I'm there to understand that we're to contend for the faith.

00:33:12.099 --> 00:33:13.979
Listen, if that false teaching comes in here,

00:33:13.979 --> 00:33:16.539
then I have a responsibility as the pastor of this church,

00:33:16.539 --> 00:33:18.859
the under-shepherd of this church, to deal with it,

00:33:18.859 --> 00:33:20.779
and in the walls of this church,

00:33:20.779 --> 00:33:22.939
the area of ministry that God has given me

00:33:22.939 --> 00:33:24.619
the responsibility over,

00:33:24.619 --> 00:33:25.859
then I have a responsibility,

00:33:25.859 --> 00:33:28.859
these things teach and exhort.

00:33:28.859 --> 00:33:31.099
We have to develop a perspective on contending,

00:33:31.099 --> 00:33:34.339
a biblical perspective on contending.

00:33:34.339 --> 00:33:35.259
You know, there's a passage,

00:33:35.259 --> 00:33:36.339
a scripture in the book of Proverbs,

00:33:36.339 --> 00:33:37.619
so many people like to look at it

00:33:37.619 --> 00:33:40.059
and say that it's a contradiction.

00:33:40.059 --> 00:33:41.579
When it says answer a fool,

00:33:41.579 --> 00:33:43.539
then it says don't answer a fool.

00:33:43.539 --> 00:33:45.299
People are like, see, there's a contradiction.

00:33:45.299 --> 00:33:47.699
That's not a contradiction, it's wisdom.

00:33:48.619 --> 00:33:51.739
There is a time to answer a fool,

00:33:51.739 --> 00:33:53.779
and there's a time not to answer a fool, why?

00:33:53.779 --> 00:33:57.019
Because he's a fool, and you don't need to answer him.

00:33:58.179 --> 00:34:01.099
You know, this is my belief, if you differ, that's fine.

00:34:01.099 --> 00:34:03.699
You know what my belief is on when I answer a fool?

00:34:03.699 --> 00:34:06.379
Is if a fool comes in here and says something

00:34:06.379 --> 00:34:09.339
that's contrary to God's word and influences other people,

00:34:09.339 --> 00:34:11.459
then I'm gonna answer that fool.

00:34:11.459 --> 00:34:12.299
Why?

00:34:12.299 --> 00:34:16.119
Because I need to make sure that his foolishness is not,

00:34:16.119 --> 00:34:18.880
or her foolishness is not influencing

00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:20.500
the members of our church.

00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:23.299
But you know what, if some person comes

00:34:23.299 --> 00:34:25.339
and tells me some foolish thing,

00:34:25.339 --> 00:34:26.979
and there's no one other than me there,

00:34:26.979 --> 00:34:30.519
like, I don't need to answer all of their foolish questions.

00:34:30.519 --> 00:34:32.339
Well, do you just not know the answer?

00:34:32.339 --> 00:34:34.019
It's not about that.

00:34:34.019 --> 00:34:35.699
It's not about that at all.

00:34:38.179 --> 00:34:43.179
I have, at times in my life, failed in that area

00:34:44.539 --> 00:34:46.979
of answering a fool when I shouldn't have,

00:34:47.979 --> 00:34:52.419
and getting into a debate with a fool.

00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:55.380
And I could walk away and say,

00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:57.819
they didn't have an answer for those Bible truths,

00:34:57.819 --> 00:35:00.459
but they didn't get converted either.

00:35:00.459 --> 00:35:02.940
They didn't get converted either.

00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:04.380
Just because I have the answer

00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:06.339
doesn't mean I need to give the answer.

00:35:07.399 --> 00:35:09.259
Does that make sense this morning?

00:35:09.259 --> 00:35:10.139
See, here's the thing.

00:35:10.139 --> 00:35:12.699
You know what I do sometimes in counseling sessions?

00:35:12.699 --> 00:35:14.279
Is I say, hey, here's some verses of scripture,

00:35:14.279 --> 00:35:15.220
go look it up.

00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:18.299
Sometimes people come and ask me a question.

00:35:18.299 --> 00:35:20.019
I'm like, hey, why don't you go read here, here, and here,

00:35:20.019 --> 00:35:21.500
and get the answer?

00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:22.339
Why?

00:35:22.339 --> 00:35:24.579
Because I'm not supposed to spoon feed everybody.

00:35:25.979 --> 00:35:28.199
Well, pastor must not have knew the answer to that question.

00:35:28.199 --> 00:35:29.419
It's not about whether,

00:35:29.419 --> 00:35:32.019
by the way, I don't know everything, all right?

00:35:32.019 --> 00:35:34.019
And if you find a pastor that does,

00:35:34.019 --> 00:35:37.899
they're probably just, well, I don't know who they are.

00:35:37.899 --> 00:35:39.819
All right, I won't say anything other than that.

00:35:39.819 --> 00:35:41.339
Listen, I'm a human being.

00:35:41.339 --> 00:35:43.160
I don't know everything.

00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:45.819
But sometimes, even if I know the answer,

00:35:45.819 --> 00:35:47.559
it's for you to go and do the study.

00:35:47.559 --> 00:35:49.559
You know why that's the case?

00:35:49.559 --> 00:35:53.039
Because if you go and do the study and you find the answer,

00:35:53.039 --> 00:35:55.679
it's gonna be in your heart and your soul

00:35:55.679 --> 00:35:58.239
more than if I just give you an answer.

00:35:58.239 --> 00:35:59.559
It's amazing how that works.

00:35:59.559 --> 00:36:02.919
So we have to develop a biblical perspective on conversion,

00:36:02.919 --> 00:36:05.979
on contending, number three in our text of scripture,

00:36:05.979 --> 00:36:10.979
a biblical perspective on contentment, on contentment.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.039
Verses six and seven of 1 Timothy chapter six

00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:16.199
have been the memory verse for the month of June.

00:36:16.199 --> 00:36:18.799
But godliness with contentment is great gain,

00:36:18.799 --> 00:36:20.519
for we brought nothing into this world.

00:36:20.519 --> 00:36:22.759
It is certain we can carry nothing out.

00:36:22.759 --> 00:36:25.559
Verse number eight, and having food and raiment,

00:36:25.559 --> 00:36:27.799
let us therewith be content,

00:36:27.799 --> 00:36:29.720
or let us be there with content.

00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:32.160
Verse nine, but they that will be rich

00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:33.959
fall into temptation and a snare

00:36:33.959 --> 00:36:36.179
and into many foolish and hurtful lusts,

00:36:36.179 --> 00:36:38.759
which drown men in destruction and perdition.

00:36:38.759 --> 00:36:42.459
Verse 10, for the love of money is the root of all evil,

00:36:42.459 --> 00:36:44.419
which while some coveted after,

00:36:44.419 --> 00:36:45.979
they have erred from the faith

00:36:45.979 --> 00:36:50.419
and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.

00:36:50.419 --> 00:36:52.179
We find here how we can develop

00:36:52.179 --> 00:36:54.859
a biblical perspective on contentment.

00:36:54.859 --> 00:36:55.899
This is a known truth.

00:36:55.899 --> 00:36:58.399
There was a mid-19th century quote

00:36:58.399 --> 00:37:01.579
that was very prevalent in the mid-19th century,

00:37:01.579 --> 00:37:05.239
and it was this, shrouds have no pockets.

00:37:05.239 --> 00:37:07.199
And that was a very known truth

00:37:07.199 --> 00:37:09.099
all the way back then in the mid-19th century.

00:37:09.099 --> 00:37:11.399
Listen, you're not taking anything with you.

00:37:13.419 --> 00:37:17.459
I said this, I think, last week in our Sunday school class.

00:37:17.459 --> 00:37:20.059
There have been times that I've been asked over the years,

00:37:20.059 --> 00:37:22.479
not only from a perspective of being a pastor,

00:37:22.479 --> 00:37:24.419
but in family situations.

00:37:24.419 --> 00:37:27.139
I've preached a number of my relatives' funerals

00:37:27.139 --> 00:37:29.380
because I'm a pastor and they've asked me to do it,

00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:31.099
and obviously I'm a relative.

00:37:31.099 --> 00:37:34.739
And many times, you know, should we put this in the coffin?

00:37:34.739 --> 00:37:37.019
It ain't gonna do any good to put it in the coffin.

00:37:37.019 --> 00:37:38.319
I'm not trying to be cold.

00:37:38.319 --> 00:37:39.660
I'm not trying to be unkind.

00:37:40.299 --> 00:37:42.299
Listen, you can't take anything with you.

00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:45.739
It's a known truth.

00:37:45.739 --> 00:37:49.139
But the subject of contentment is an important subject.

00:37:49.139 --> 00:37:53.500
He says godliness with contentment is great gain.

00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:56.059
He says at the end of verse number eight,

00:37:56.059 --> 00:38:00.539
having food and raiment let us be there with content.

00:38:00.539 --> 00:38:02.220
You know, there's a lot of people in our world today

00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:03.299
that are not content.

00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:05.579
They're not content.

00:38:06.539 --> 00:38:08.779
The marketing industry has been so successful

00:38:08.779 --> 00:38:11.859
in our world today because they prey

00:38:11.859 --> 00:38:14.220
on people that are not content.

00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:16.299
They make you think that you need everything

00:38:16.299 --> 00:38:17.339
that they're selling.

00:38:18.619 --> 00:38:20.899
And the reality is that contentment

00:38:20.899 --> 00:38:22.539
is something that we must learn.

00:38:22.539 --> 00:38:24.419
In fact, in Philippians chapter number four,

00:38:24.419 --> 00:38:27.099
notice what Paul says to the believers in Philippi.

00:38:27.099 --> 00:38:31.059
He's speaking to them and he gives them this great truth

00:38:31.059 --> 00:38:33.179
in verse number 11 of Philippians four.

00:38:33.179 --> 00:38:36.179
He says this, not that I speak in respect of want,

00:38:36.179 --> 00:38:38.500
for I have learned in whatsoever state I am,

00:38:39.219 --> 00:38:42.020
therewith to be content.

00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:45.020
I've said this often as I've read this verse of scripture.

00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:48.380
I cannot, I don't know if you can or not,

00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:51.140
but I cannot say I have learned.

00:38:52.099 --> 00:38:56.580
I'm striving to say I am learning to be content.

00:38:56.580 --> 00:38:58.219
I am learning.

00:38:58.219 --> 00:39:00.979
But I can't say like Paul said, I have learned

00:39:00.979 --> 00:39:03.700
in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content.

00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:07.099
But the reality is that we ought to be learning

00:39:07.099 --> 00:39:07.940
to be content.

00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:11.020
We must understand and develop this biblical perspective

00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:12.020
on contentment.

00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:14.859
And we live in a society, we live in a culture

00:39:14.859 --> 00:39:17.419
that would preach to us, that would say to our kids,

00:39:17.419 --> 00:39:18.820
you need more, you need this,

00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:20.140
and this is gonna bring happiness,

00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:21.779
and this is gonna bring satisfaction.

00:39:21.779 --> 00:39:24.659
And if you can just have this, then you will be content,

00:39:24.659 --> 00:39:25.859
only for a little while.

00:39:27.059 --> 00:39:29.059
And then you're not content anymore.

00:39:29.059 --> 00:39:33.580
It loses its value, it loses its shine,

00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:35.539
whatever you wanna say.

00:39:35.539 --> 00:39:39.299
The reality this morning is that we must learn

00:39:39.299 --> 00:39:41.179
this truth of contentment.

00:39:41.179 --> 00:39:45.539
The Bible teaches us about the truth of covetousness.

00:39:45.539 --> 00:39:48.739
In fact, in Exodus chapter 20, we find the truth

00:39:48.739 --> 00:39:51.539
that's given with regard to not coveting.

00:39:52.459 --> 00:39:54.739
Paul says in Romans chapter number seven,

00:39:54.739 --> 00:39:58.099
if it had not been for this truth that the Bible says,

00:39:58.099 --> 00:40:00.099
thou shalt not covet, I would not have.

00:40:00.099 --> 00:40:07.099
known sin. Right? And so we find, look at the truth in Hebrews, chapter number 13, the

00:40:07.099 --> 00:40:13.319
Bible tells us in Hebrews 13 and verse number 5, so often we like to quote part of this

00:40:13.319 --> 00:40:19.399
portion of scripture where the Bible tells us that God will never leave us nor forsake

00:40:19.399 --> 00:40:23.859
us and what a great truth that is. He says, I will never leave thee nor forsake thee.

00:40:23.859 --> 00:40:30.419
But that's the end of the verse. The Bible says in Hebrews 13 and verse number 5, let

00:40:30.419 --> 00:40:39.899
your conversation be without covetousness and be content with such things as you have,

00:40:39.899 --> 00:40:48.279
for he hath said, I will never leave thee nor forsake thee. A biblical perspective on

00:40:48.279 --> 00:40:54.599
contentment. Oh, how important this is in our society today. Where so many have been

00:40:54.599 --> 00:41:01.439
influenced and impacted by this marketing world and by the society that years ago, I

00:41:01.439 --> 00:41:05.959
don't even know how many decades ago now, there was the term that came out of keeping

00:41:05.959 --> 00:41:12.199
up with the Joneses. I'm sure that every one of us have heard that at some point in reference.

00:41:12.919 --> 00:41:21.039
And the reality is that God has given us, and listen, he gives us what we need. He gives

00:41:21.039 --> 00:41:24.999
us what we need. We develop this biblical perspective on contentment. It's interesting,

00:41:24.999 --> 00:41:28.959
turn back to 1 Timothy chapter 6, because there's two powerful truths that we need

00:41:28.959 --> 00:41:36.919
to look at quickly in verse 9 and 10. In verse 9 and 10, God gives us some powerful truth

00:41:36.919 --> 00:41:42.679
that will help us as we develop a biblical perspective on contentment. In verse number

00:41:42.679 --> 00:41:48.279
9, it says, but they that will be rich fall into temptation. I'm not going to read the

00:41:48.279 --> 00:41:52.319
entirety of the verse. I read it just a moment ago, but understand that it does not say they

00:41:52.319 --> 00:42:00.679
that are rich. It doesn't say they that are rich. It says they that will be rich. Do you

00:42:00.679 --> 00:42:06.919
know what that reveals to us? That is the pursuit of that individual, is wealth, is

00:42:06.919 --> 00:42:11.999
riches, is to have more, more, more. That is their pursuit. And God says that those

00:42:11.999 --> 00:42:16.879
people will fall into temptation, a snare, many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown

00:42:16.879 --> 00:42:21.119
men in destruction and perdition. And by the way, if you just study humanity for a little

00:42:21.119 --> 00:42:27.799
while, those that will be, that is their goal. That is their objective. That is their pursuit.

00:42:27.799 --> 00:42:32.759
How can I get more and more and more and wealth and wealth and wealth? They fall into

00:42:32.759 --> 00:42:38.359
all sorts of difficulties. It doesn't say they that are rich. It says they that will

00:42:38.359 --> 00:42:44.039
be rich. Some people have the misunderstanding that if we have any measure of money that

00:42:44.039 --> 00:42:52.519
there must be some level of wickedness. Money is not wicked. He says they that will be rich.

00:42:52.519 --> 00:42:57.319
Notice in verse number 10, it says, for the love of money is the root of all evil. So

00:42:57.319 --> 00:43:03.559
we see in verse number 9, the phrase will be is the key in us understanding that individual's

00:43:03.559 --> 00:43:08.959
pursuit of wealth and of money. We find in verse number 10 that it says the love of money.

00:43:08.959 --> 00:43:13.219
It doesn't say money. Now, if you go down to the little pizza shop down here that's

00:43:13.219 --> 00:43:19.279
next to the Navy Federal across the street from the Lowe's over there, you'll find that

00:43:19.279 --> 00:43:22.279
they have a little tip container. I haven't been there in actually a long time, so I'm

00:43:22.279 --> 00:43:25.659
not sure if it's still there. But they used to have a little tip container on their counter.

00:43:25.899 --> 00:43:29.739
Everyone wants tips and what have you, right? And they had their little tip container out.

00:43:29.739 --> 00:43:33.339
And in their tip container there, it's King's Pizza, right? I'm not trying to throw one

00:43:33.339 --> 00:43:36.539
of the bus. I'm just letting you know what the perspective is. Here's what it says on

00:43:36.539 --> 00:43:43.459
that thing. It says, money is the root of all evil. Therefore, give it to us. I promise

00:43:43.459 --> 00:43:47.419
you. Now, it might not still be there, but I'm telling you it was there. And so I was

00:43:47.419 --> 00:43:51.019
standing there and as a good preacher, hey man, I'm standing there waiting for my pizza

00:43:51.019 --> 00:43:53.699
bar and I'm just standing there and I see that thing and I'm like, you've got to be

00:43:53.699 --> 00:43:58.019
kidding me, man. You've got to absolutely be kidding me. So, I'm thinking about what

00:43:58.019 --> 00:44:02.539
am I going to say, Mark? What am I going to say? What am I going to say? So, I stood there

00:44:02.539 --> 00:44:06.899
and I waited for the pizza, they gave me the pizza. Just so you know, that's really not

00:44:06.899 --> 00:44:15.699
what the Bible says. The Bible says the love of money is the root of all evil. Now, I wanted

00:44:15.699 --> 00:44:19.339
to say, and obviously you love it because you want mine, but I didn't say that, right?

00:44:19.339 --> 00:44:28.459
I just kind of kept it close. But the reality is that they were misusing a biblical truth

00:44:28.459 --> 00:44:34.979
for their own profit or gain and they say money is evil. Money is not evil. The love

00:44:34.979 --> 00:44:42.359
of money is the root of all evil. They that will be rich, not that those that are rich,

00:44:42.359 --> 00:44:47.859
they that will be, it's their pursuit. The love of how much can I get? So, how do we

00:44:47.939 --> 00:44:54.939
develop the biblical perspective of contentment? Well, we're not seeking riches. If God were

00:44:54.939 --> 00:45:01.059
to bless you, by the way, there are many people in God's Word that were wealthy. Wealth is

00:45:01.059 --> 00:45:08.179
not a problem. It's how you use it. It's like what Brother Cottle said, it's not the problem

00:45:08.179 --> 00:45:14.619
if you have wealth, it's the problem if wealth has you. That's the problem. Money is not

00:45:14.619 --> 00:45:21.019
the problem, but if money has you, it becomes the problem. God uses those, listen, I have

00:45:21.019 --> 00:45:26.619
found in my life that many times the people that God chooses to bless with monetary blessings

00:45:26.619 --> 00:45:33.659
are the people that are givers. That's just the way it works. And so, we find here that

00:45:33.659 --> 00:45:38.379
he says they that will be rich, the love of money is the root of all evil. So, we understand

00:45:38.379 --> 00:45:42.059
that godliness with contentment is great gain. We understand that we brought nothing into

00:45:42.099 --> 00:45:47.619
this world. It is certain we can carry nothing out. Having food and raiment let us be there

00:45:47.619 --> 00:45:54.059
with content. So, we have to develop this biblical perspective on contentment. The Bible

00:45:54.059 --> 00:45:59.779
tells us a few verses I'm going to reference for you quickly. Job 1 and verse number 21,

00:45:59.779 --> 00:46:05.939
and many of us are familiar with the life of Job. All of the destruction that came place

00:46:05.939 --> 00:46:12.059
in chapter number 1, by the way, Job was a wealthy man. He was a wealthy man. He lost

00:46:12.059 --> 00:46:18.939
everything and at the end of the book, he's a wealthy man again. God gave him. God restored,

00:46:18.939 --> 00:46:26.019
actually more. Notice in Job chapter 1 and verse 21, notice what Job says. Verse 20 is

00:46:26.019 --> 00:46:31.379
important to read along with it. It says this in Job 1 and verse 20, then Job arose, rent

00:46:31.379 --> 00:46:35.699
his mantle and shaved his head and fell down upon the ground and worshipped. Here's what

00:46:35.699 --> 00:46:42.679
he said, naked came I out of my mother's womb and naked shall I return thither. The Lord

00:46:42.679 --> 00:46:50.579
gave. The Lord gave. That's the right perspective. The Lord gave. I got a job. You know who gave

00:46:50.579 --> 00:46:54.219
you the ability to earn wealth? Go back to Deuteronomy and read it. It says that God

00:46:54.219 --> 00:46:59.399
gives you the power to get wealth. God gave you the power to work. No, I have a, whatever

00:46:59.399 --> 00:47:05.519
job you have, whatever mind you have, whatever ability you have, God gave that to you. And

00:47:05.519 --> 00:47:14.079
so it says, the Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away. Blessed be the name of the Lord.

00:47:14.079 --> 00:47:20.939
In all this, Job sinned not nor charged God foolishly. The book of Psalms in Psalm 62

00:47:20.939 --> 00:47:29.639
and verse number 10 tells us this. In Psalm 62 and verse number 10, trust not in oppression

00:47:29.639 --> 00:47:39.339
and become not vain in robbery. If riches increase, set not your heart upon them. If

00:47:39.339 --> 00:47:47.539
riches increase, set not your heart upon them. Your riches may increase. God may choose to

00:47:47.539 --> 00:47:55.459
bless monetarily. And that's okay. But set not your heart upon them. Why? Well, I think

00:47:55.459 --> 00:48:00.679
in verse, in Proverbs chapter 23, God gives us a good reason. Obviously, we're, our hearts

00:48:00.679 --> 00:48:05.699
are to be kept with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life in Proverbs chapter

00:48:05.699 --> 00:48:13.939
4. But in Proverbs chapter 23, we're to have a heart for the Lord. Amen? A heart for God.

00:48:13.939 --> 00:48:22.779
In Proverbs 23 and verse 4, it says, labor not to be rich. Cease from thine own wisdom.

00:48:22.779 --> 00:48:27.339
You know, the, the truth of verse number 4, labor not to be rich, is really coupled with

00:48:27.339 --> 00:48:34.399
what we see in 1 Timothy 6 and verse number 9, they that will be rich. He says, listen,

00:48:34.399 --> 00:48:40.500
labor not to be rich. Cease from thine own wisdom. Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that

00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:47.979
which is not? For certainly, for riches certainly make themselves wings, they fly away as an

00:48:47.979 --> 00:48:56.739
eagle toward heaven. It's amazing, the truth of that verse of Scripture. In a moment, it

00:48:56.739 --> 00:49:05.859
could just all be gone. Some in our congregation, none that I believe are here this morning,

00:49:05.859 --> 00:49:11.380
literally experienced all that took place in the Great Depression, but their parents

00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:18.459
did and they're familiar with the impacts of that. But you know, it's just amazing how

00:49:18.459 --> 00:49:24.219
an economy can collapse. Can I tell you this morning, I'm not, I'm not an economist. It

00:49:24.219 --> 00:49:31.059
is not my arena of expertise. I readily admit that. Okay. But in everything that I see in

00:49:31.059 --> 00:49:40.899
our society today, our economy is fake. Our economy is fake right now. And it's just going

00:49:40.899 --> 00:49:48.979
to be a matter of just a few things that could happen. Bam. Just, but listen, that's why

00:49:48.979 --> 00:49:54.579
we don't set our heart upon riches. Godliness with contentment is great gain. You have food

00:49:54.579 --> 00:50:00.099
and raiment, be content. God takes care of us. Amen? And I'm thinking, listen, and I'm

00:50:00.099 --> 00:50:05.979
In America, God has abundantly blessed us and I would say this, that we're in danger,

00:50:05.979 --> 00:50:13.179
in America, we're in danger of the church of the Laodiceans, increased with goods and

00:50:13.179 --> 00:50:16.659
have need of nothing, including God.

00:50:16.659 --> 00:50:22.919
If we're not careful, we can be in that position in America where we've been so abundantly

00:50:22.919 --> 00:50:23.919
blessed.

00:50:23.919 --> 00:50:33.279
How do we develop biblical perspective in these three areas, conversion, contending,

00:50:33.279 --> 00:50:34.279
and contentment?

00:50:34.279 --> 00:50:41.679
I wonder this morning, have we allowed God's Word to shape our biblical perspective in

00:50:41.679 --> 00:50:43.239
these areas?

00:50:43.239 --> 00:50:48.079
And then broader speaking this morning, do we have a biblical worldview?

00:50:48.079 --> 00:50:53.399
Do we take God and His Word, say, this is God's Word, this is the truth, it doesn't

00:50:53.399 --> 00:50:57.799
matter what culture says, what society says, it doesn't matter what any, no, it is God's

00:50:57.799 --> 00:51:00.239
Word that matters.

00:51:00.239 --> 00:51:07.159
When we take and embrace the truth of God's Word, it will have a profound impact in every

00:51:07.159 --> 00:51:09.919
area of your life.

00:51:09.919 --> 00:51:11.719
God's Word changes lives.

00:51:11.719 --> 00:51:12.719
Let's pray.

00:51:12.719 --> 00:51:13.719
Father, we love you.

00:51:13.719 --> 00:51:14.719
We thank you for loving us.

00:51:14.719 --> 00:51:16.439
Thank you for your Word this morning.

00:51:16.439 --> 00:51:21.239
I pray God that you would use the truth that we've looked at to help someone this morning,

00:51:21.239 --> 00:51:23.439
to help many, to help your people, Lord.

00:51:23.439 --> 00:51:28.159
Thank you that your Word, not my Word, your Word changes lives.

00:51:28.159 --> 00:51:40.679
And I pray God that you'd help us as we've been so blessed to have a biblical perspective

00:51:40.679 --> 00:51:45.719
and a biblical worldview in these three areas of our lives.

00:51:45.719 --> 00:51:46.919
We've listened so well.

00:51:46.919 --> 00:51:48.199
We've received the message.

00:51:48.199 --> 00:51:50.879
Help us now to respond appropriately.

00:51:50.879 --> 00:51:53.799
And thank you for the work that you'll do in our hearts and lives, for it's in Christ's

00:51:53.799 --> 00:51:54.799
name we pray.

00:51:54.799 --> 00:51:55.799
Would you stand with me?

00:51:55.799 --> 00:51:56.799
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

00:51:56.799 --> 00:51:59.799
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano this morning.

00:51:59.799 --> 00:52:03.319
If you're not saved, we'd love to have the opportunity to take a Bible and show you how

00:52:03.319 --> 00:52:05.799
you can know for sure that heaven's your home.

00:52:05.799 --> 00:52:09.319
If you're saved this morning, but maybe God just spoke to you in some area of one of these

00:52:09.319 --> 00:52:15.679
points that we've looked at on how to develop a biblical perspective, a biblical worldview.

00:52:15.679 --> 00:52:17.439
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
