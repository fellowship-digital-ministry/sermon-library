00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.659
It's good to know you're saved, and it's a blessing to know that one day you're going

00:00:04.659 --> 00:00:05.659
to have a home in heaven.

00:00:05.659 --> 00:00:07.659
Boy, what a joy that is.

00:00:07.659 --> 00:00:09.539
So it's good to have a good group back here tonight.

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:13.579
We had a great day yesterday just being in the house of God, one with the other and fellowshipping

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:18.700
together around the Word of God, and we just enjoyed the day immensely yesterday, and it

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.500
was a blessing to spend time with God's people.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.940
You know, when we're away from our home church, it's such a joy for us to be able to come

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.200
in churches like this and just feel like we're at home.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.439
You know, you folks are precious to us.

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:38.080
This is a church of life, faith, walk, order, doctrine, and discipline, and so we have fellowship

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.599
one with the other because of what Jesus Christ has done for us on the cross of Calvary.

00:00:42.599 --> 00:00:43.599
Amen?

00:00:43.599 --> 00:00:44.599
It's all about Jesus.

00:00:44.599 --> 00:00:45.599
It's not about us.

00:00:45.599 --> 00:00:49.400
It's all about Him, and so we can thank God for that.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.000
Psalm 139, turn there, and just stop my message while I probably use one of these verses,

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:59.099
but the 139th Psalm, if you turn there in your Bible tonight, please, I just want to

00:00:59.099 --> 00:01:03.860
start there, and this psalm, of course, prompted me just a little bit to consider this.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.339
I was actually going to preach through this, I thought, maybe this week, but the Lord has

00:01:07.339 --> 00:01:11.580
not given me permission to do that, but I do want to share something with you out of

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.139
the 139th Psalm, and of course, this is a Davidic psalm.

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:22.139
It's one of the great psalms in the book of Psalms, and I have preached through this many

00:01:22.199 --> 00:01:27.800
a time, and generally, I start a revival meeting off with going through this psalm very quickly,

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.760
but I want you to look at Psalm 139 with me, just beginning in verse 1.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.559
I'm going to read a few verses, and then we're going to get into our message tonight, but

00:01:35.559 --> 00:01:40.199
it just, I was prompted to think about this, but David here, inspired by the Holy Spirit

00:01:40.199 --> 00:01:41.199
of God, says this.

00:01:41.199 --> 00:01:44.800
He said, O Lord, Thou hast searched me and known me.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.120
Thou hast searched me and known me.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.400
Thou knowest my down-sitting and mine uprising.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.760
Look at this.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.019
Thou understandest my thought afar off.

00:01:56.019 --> 00:02:00.300
Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.099
I want you to stop and think about that for a minute.

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:06.459
God is acquainted with all my ways.

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:09.020
He knows everything about me.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.699
He's acquainted with all my ways.

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:16.419
No matter what I do, no matter where I go, no matter what I'm involved in, engaged in,

00:02:16.419 --> 00:02:18.860
God knows everything about me.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:19.860
Amen?

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.160
Now, someone said recently, you really can't know everything about everybody.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.839
You can't know everything there is about a person.

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:28.139
You think you do.

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:31.759
Even after you've been married for a long period of time, they say you don't even really

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:33.000
know everything about your spouse.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.800
Well, I'm not sure that's true, but I'm certain that there probably are some things that we

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.160
don't know about one another.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.320
Might be some secrets that we've kept or some things that we've not shared because it wouldn't

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.720
do any good to share those things.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:52.300
I have no idea sometimes how you would approach that kind of a statement, but God knows.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.779
He knows everything about me.

00:02:53.779 --> 00:02:59.339
In fact, one time I came home from work when I was still working in the Worker's Day world

00:02:59.339 --> 00:03:02.139
as a bivocational pastor for several years.

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:06.899
I worked a job, and when I first went into evangelism, I worked for a while.

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:11.820
I had a situation at work that was very troubling to me.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.759
My routine was I'd come home, and I'd get a shower, and we'd sit down and eat, and I'd

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:20.320
ask my wife, we don't want to talk about anything until I've been home for at least an hour.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.199
I came home one night so troubled that I just went into the bedroom and shut the door and

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:27.559
threw myself face down on the bed.

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:30.679
I said, God, I can't do anything about this.

00:03:30.679 --> 00:03:36.520
God, you can see how overloaded I am tonight, and Lord, nobody knows me like you know me,

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.639
and I need your help.

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:41.979
In fact, I actually said to the Lord, listen, this is not my problem, it's your problem

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:44.419
because I can't do anything about this.

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:48.940
I mean, it was one of those situations where I had no control over what was going on at

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:49.940
all.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.660
I said, God, you're acquainted with all my ways.

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.419
You know everything there is to know about me, and you know exactly what it is that I'm

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:57.820
dealing with here.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.820
At verse 4, he says, for there is not a word in my tongue, but lo, O Lord, thou knowest

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.059
it altogether.

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:09.199
Verse 5 says, thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me.

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:14.039
Such knowledge is too wonderful for me, it is too high, I cannot attain unto it.

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:16.600
Well, whither shall I go from thy spirit?

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.880
Or whither shall I flee from thy presence?

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.920
I'm going to be preaching on that topic tonight.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.160
If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.119
If I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there.

00:04:29.119 --> 00:04:33.920
If I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, even there

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:38.339
shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.

00:04:38.339 --> 00:04:43.299
If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me, even the night shall be light about me,

00:04:43.299 --> 00:04:48.980
yea, the darkness hideth not from thee, but the night shineth as the day, the darkness

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.579
as the light are both alike to thee.

00:04:51.579 --> 00:04:56.459
For thou hast possessed my reins, thou hast covered me in my mother's womb.

00:04:56.459 --> 00:05:01.660
Well, I will praise thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.959
Precious are thy works, and that my soul knoweth right well.

00:05:04.959 --> 00:05:07.359
My substance was not hid from thee.

00:05:07.359 --> 00:05:12.200
When I was made in secret, and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth, thine eyes

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:17.799
did see my substance yet being unperfect, and in thy book all my members were written,

00:05:17.799 --> 00:05:22.000
which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.279
Verse 17 says, How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God!

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:28.519
How great is the sum of them!

00:05:28.519 --> 00:05:31.899
If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand.

00:05:31.899 --> 00:05:34.579
When I awake, I am still with thee.

00:05:34.579 --> 00:05:36.660
Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God!

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.100
Depart from me therefore, ye bloody men!

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:44.260
For they speak against thee wickedly, and thine enemies take thy name in vain.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.420
Do not I hate them, O Lord, that hate thee?

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.880
And am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.459
I hate them with a perfect hatred.

00:05:51.459 --> 00:05:54.420
I count them mine enemies.

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:57.540
But then there's a transition in verse 23.

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:02.799
He said, Now, Lord, search me.

00:06:02.799 --> 00:06:07.920
Search me, O God, and know my heart.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:16.320
Try me and know my thoughts, and see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.359
way everlasting.

00:06:17.359 --> 00:06:20.940
He said, Listen, I see all the problems with men, the men that are around me, all the evil

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:27.220
deeds they do, all those that hate me, all those that are in adversity against me.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:32.380
But he said, Really, what it boils down to is this, but what about me?

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:38.940
He said, Search me, O God, and know my heart.

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:44.220
Try me and know my thoughts, and see if there be any wicked way in me.

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:49.279
So he's saying, Listen, Lord, I'm relinquishing full control over to you, and I'm giving you

00:06:49.279 --> 00:06:51.239
permission to deal with my heart.

00:06:51.239 --> 00:06:58.000
I surrender myself completely to you, and I literally am giving you permission to deal

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.200
with me in a way which will point out to me and reveal what's really going on in my heart.

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.480
And God, if there's anything there that's wicked, I want to know it.

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:11.119
If it's something that I've missed that I've not confessed or repented of nor forsaken,

00:07:11.119 --> 00:07:12.679
O God, I want to know it.

00:07:12.679 --> 00:07:14.920
I want it to be revealed, O Lord.

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.880
Please do that for me.

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.399
Well, what an honest statement of Scripture this is.

00:07:19.399 --> 00:07:21.200
What an honest man David was.

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:26.760
See, many times, most men will never allow God the latitude, this kind of latitude, as

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:30.440
they fear what will be revealed.

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:36.679
Some people just don't want to know, amen?

00:07:36.679 --> 00:07:41.160
Sometimes get into a preaching meeting, and the Holy Spirit of God convicts you.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.160
Well, then what are you going to do?

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.079
Are you going to tell God, No?

00:07:45.079 --> 00:07:46.519
I don't want to get right with you.

00:07:47.519 --> 00:07:49.200
I don't want to have my heart straightened out.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:52.160
Don't want my life back on track the way it ought to be.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.000
Some people just stiff-arm God.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.279
Well, they don't want to know.

00:07:57.279 --> 00:07:59.920
They're just satisfied with where they're at.

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:04.000
They're kind of in their comfort zone.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.600
And so as I read this and as I listen to this precious song that was sung, and it really

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.799
touched my heart.

00:08:12.799 --> 00:08:14.480
So I want God to search me.

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.200
I want God to know my heart.

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.200
I want Him to try me.

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.320
I want Him to know my thoughts.

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:22.760
And if there's anything there that I need to see that I'm missing, I want God to reveal

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:25.040
that to me.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:28.640
God's always faithful to do that, amen?

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:29.640
Always faithful.

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:30.640
All right.

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:34.479
Let's take Psalm 139, verse 7, would you stand with me, please?

00:08:34.479 --> 00:08:38.880
I respect and reverence the reading of God's infallible and spirit-inspired, inerrant Word

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:39.880
of God.

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:43.400
We are going to look at this one verse, verse 7 in Psalm 139, then we're going to get over

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:49.960
to the book of Jonah, but Psalm 139, verse 7, the Bible says this, David speaking here

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:53.520
is inspired by the spirit of God, says, Whither shall I go from thy spirit?

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:56.520
Or whither shall I flee from thy presence?

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:57.520
Indeed.

00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:58.880
You can't hide from God.

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.440
He knows where you're at.

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:01.919
He knows what you're doing.

00:09:01.919 --> 00:09:04.239
You can never flee from His presence.

00:09:04.239 --> 00:09:07.760
Too many people running from God today.

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:11.760
Running in all sorts of directions and running in outside the will of God, and we're going

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:15.679
to take a look at that tonight just a little bit as we get into the message of Lord's impressed

00:09:15.679 --> 00:09:17.280
upon my heart for this evening.

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:20.760
Father, we thank You, God, tonight for already speaking to our hearts through song.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.159
We thank You, Lord, for the congregational singing.

00:09:23.159 --> 00:09:27.640
I thank You, God, tonight that the Holy Spirit has already touched my heart tonight, and

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:29.039
I'm thankful for that.

00:09:29.039 --> 00:09:33.159
And I pray that, Lord, tonight as we look into Your Word, that You'd speak to us afresh

00:09:33.159 --> 00:09:34.919
and move in our midst tonight.

00:09:34.919 --> 00:09:38.599
Lord, please help me to rightly divide the Word of truth tonight, to share what's on

00:09:38.599 --> 00:09:39.960
my heart tonight.

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:45.119
I pray, God, that You would fall fresh upon us tonight and breathe fresh upon us tonight.

00:09:45.119 --> 00:09:48.359
We want to leave this place differently than the way we came in.

00:09:48.359 --> 00:09:50.640
So God, I pray You'd do business with us tonight.

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.799
I pray, God, You'd convict us where we need to be convicted.

00:09:53.799 --> 00:09:56.799
And Lord, we just don't want to be stirred, God, but we want to be changed, want to be

00:09:56.799 --> 00:09:57.799
different, Lord.

00:09:57.799 --> 00:09:58.799
So speak to us through Thy Word.

00:09:58.799 --> 00:09:59.799
Thy Word is truth.

00:09:59.799 --> 00:09:59.799


00:09:59.799 --> 00:10:02.119
and it liveth and it abideth forever.

00:10:02.119 --> 00:10:03.999
We'll thank you now for it in Jesus' precious

00:10:03.999 --> 00:10:06.039
and holy and wonderful name, amen.

00:10:06.039 --> 00:10:07.479
Thank you, may you be seated.

00:10:08.999 --> 00:10:13.479
Turn with me to the book of Jonah, the book of Jonah.

00:10:13.479 --> 00:10:15.399
It's a little book, just four chapters,

00:10:15.399 --> 00:10:17.159
and usually when I preach through Jonah,

00:10:17.159 --> 00:10:18.299
I go through the entire book,

00:10:18.299 --> 00:10:19.419
and I may even do that tonight,

00:10:19.419 --> 00:10:20.719
but there's just something practical

00:10:20.719 --> 00:10:23.299
I wanna get out of the book of Jonah tonight

00:10:23.299 --> 00:10:26.119
as we spend some time in this precious book.

00:10:26.119 --> 00:10:28.919
I wonder, many times when I get into a revival meeting

00:10:28.919 --> 00:10:31.039
or maybe just preaching of a home church,

00:10:31.039 --> 00:10:32.519
I look around at my congregation,

00:10:32.519 --> 00:10:35.879
and I wonder, how many people are running from God?

00:10:35.879 --> 00:10:37.359
How many people that I'm preaching to

00:10:37.359 --> 00:10:39.759
are out of the will of God, amen?

00:10:39.759 --> 00:10:41.479
Now, stop and think about that for a minute.

00:10:41.479 --> 00:10:42.639
Now, you say, now, Brother Mashon,

00:10:42.639 --> 00:10:44.799
I heard you talk about that last night just a little bit

00:10:44.799 --> 00:10:47.799
when we were dealing with the evening message,

00:10:47.799 --> 00:10:50.119
and I talked about this thing of running from God.

00:10:50.119 --> 00:10:51.939
I wanna tell you something right now.

00:10:51.939 --> 00:10:53.479
Personally, in my own personal life,

00:10:53.479 --> 00:10:55.039
one of the things that I fear more than anything else

00:10:55.039 --> 00:10:56.939
is getting out of the will of the Lord.

00:10:57.939 --> 00:11:00.539
Getting out of the will of God's a miserable thing.

00:11:00.539 --> 00:11:05.019
Now, if you're here tonight and you look at your own life,

00:11:05.019 --> 00:11:06.579
you could probably say, you know what, preacher,

00:11:06.579 --> 00:11:07.979
if you've been saved in any period of time,

00:11:07.979 --> 00:11:09.179
there's been some times in my life

00:11:09.179 --> 00:11:11.099
when I've been out of the will of God.

00:11:12.659 --> 00:11:14.679
And it's an amazing thing how people,

00:11:14.679 --> 00:11:16.179
sometimes they realize, they know,

00:11:16.179 --> 00:11:17.499
and they understand they're out of the will of God,

00:11:17.499 --> 00:11:18.399
but they don't wanna do anything about it.

00:11:18.399 --> 00:11:20.259
They're just happy where they're at.

00:11:20.259 --> 00:11:22.219
I don't ever wanna get out of the will of God.

00:11:22.219 --> 00:11:23.499
Amen.

00:11:23.499 --> 00:11:26.099
A lot of people just flat out disobedient.

00:11:27.579 --> 00:11:28.919
I've said this, I don't know how many times,

00:11:28.919 --> 00:11:30.219
I don't know how many missions conferences

00:11:30.219 --> 00:11:31.139
I've preached over the years,

00:11:31.139 --> 00:11:33.519
but it's interesting, in missions conferences,

00:11:33.519 --> 00:11:35.999
if especially in a large church,

00:11:35.999 --> 00:11:37.539
in missions conferences many times,

00:11:37.539 --> 00:11:38.859
I'm almost always pretty sure

00:11:38.859 --> 00:11:40.539
there's somebody in that congregation

00:11:40.539 --> 00:11:41.579
that God's worked in their hearts

00:11:41.579 --> 00:11:43.139
about going to the mission field,

00:11:43.139 --> 00:11:44.739
and they've said no to the Lord.

00:11:45.959 --> 00:11:47.059
Or perhaps there's somebody there

00:11:47.059 --> 00:11:48.379
that God's been working on their heart

00:11:48.379 --> 00:11:49.439
and calling in to preach,

00:11:49.439 --> 00:11:52.819
and yet they refuse to yield themselves to the ministry.

00:11:53.899 --> 00:11:55.459
Or maybe there's some sin in their life,

00:11:55.459 --> 00:11:56.579
as I mentioned last night,

00:11:57.219 --> 00:11:58.059
that they refuse to get right with God

00:11:58.059 --> 00:12:01.019
and they just run as hard and as fast as they can

00:12:01.019 --> 00:12:04.299
away from the convicting power of the Holy Spirit of God.

00:12:04.299 --> 00:12:06.019
It's a terrible thing.

00:12:06.019 --> 00:12:07.539
I think one of the most miserable creatures

00:12:07.539 --> 00:12:10.859
on the face of the earth is a disobedient Christian,

00:12:10.859 --> 00:12:12.339
a Christian not living in the center

00:12:12.339 --> 00:12:14.499
of God's perfect will for them.

00:12:14.499 --> 00:12:15.339
Well, I don't know about you,

00:12:15.339 --> 00:12:17.179
but I wanna be in God's perfect will.

00:12:19.379 --> 00:12:22.939
I don't ever wanna run from the will of God for my life.

00:12:22.939 --> 00:12:23.779
Now, I'm gonna share something with you,

00:12:23.779 --> 00:12:26.479
and I'm gonna get into the message here pretty quick.

00:12:27.239 --> 00:12:28.239
We were talking about this a little bit earlier tonight,

00:12:28.239 --> 00:12:30.119
talked to somebody in the auditorium

00:12:30.119 --> 00:12:31.939
as we came in tonight.

00:12:31.939 --> 00:12:34.419
My wife and I hate to travel.

00:12:34.419 --> 00:12:35.259
We hate it.

00:12:37.459 --> 00:12:38.759
And let me say this.

00:12:38.759 --> 00:12:39.599
We wanna be home.

00:12:39.599 --> 00:12:40.419
We're homebodies.

00:12:40.419 --> 00:12:42.039
We like to be at home.

00:12:42.039 --> 00:12:42.919
Let me say this.

00:12:42.919 --> 00:12:45.139
To take it one step further, we hate RVs.

00:12:46.359 --> 00:12:48.799
And we used an RV in our ministry for years.

00:12:48.799 --> 00:12:49.639
We lived in an RV.

00:12:49.639 --> 00:12:52.079
It was our only home, and that's what we lived in.

00:12:52.079 --> 00:12:54.759
I just absolutely, positively do not like RVs.

00:12:54.759 --> 00:12:56.799
I don't like the RV lifestyle.

00:12:58.439 --> 00:12:59.399
And someone said to me,

00:12:59.399 --> 00:13:01.759
well, why don't you just get out of it?

00:13:01.759 --> 00:13:03.399
Why don't you just leave evangelism?

00:13:03.399 --> 00:13:04.479
You don't need to be an evangelist.

00:13:04.479 --> 00:13:05.319
Just get out of it.

00:13:05.319 --> 00:13:07.199
Go pastor church somewhere.

00:13:07.199 --> 00:13:09.559
I said, but this is what God has called me to.

00:13:11.719 --> 00:13:13.119
You know, friends, let me tell you this.

00:13:13.119 --> 00:13:14.919
I don't have to like traveling.

00:13:16.379 --> 00:13:17.959
I don't have to like RVs.

00:13:18.879 --> 00:13:19.799
Amen?

00:13:19.799 --> 00:13:22.599
I just need to be obedient to what God has called me to do.

00:13:22.599 --> 00:13:24.259
Like has nothing to do with it.

00:13:25.239 --> 00:13:27.279
Do you hear what I just said?

00:13:27.279 --> 00:13:28.759
There are gonna be some times in your life

00:13:28.759 --> 00:13:31.359
when God is going to impress upon you to do something

00:13:31.359 --> 00:13:34.199
in your Christian life that perhaps you would not like.

00:13:35.919 --> 00:13:37.599
But like has nothing to do with it.

00:13:37.599 --> 00:13:39.599
Obedience is what it's all about.

00:13:40.759 --> 00:13:43.159
Obedience is what it's all about.

00:13:43.159 --> 00:13:45.319
And being in the center of God's perfect will

00:13:45.319 --> 00:13:46.719
is what it's all about.

00:13:46.719 --> 00:13:49.399
I would much rather be in the center of God's perfect will

00:13:49.399 --> 00:13:50.919
than be living outside the will of God

00:13:50.919 --> 00:13:53.279
and be miserable the rest of my Christian life.

00:13:54.119 --> 00:13:56.039
So now, you say, now, Brother Rashaun,

00:13:56.039 --> 00:13:57.679
do you like what you're doing?

00:13:57.679 --> 00:13:59.079
Well, I love what I'm doing.

00:14:00.999 --> 00:14:02.959
God gave us a love for it.

00:14:02.959 --> 00:14:06.119
God impressed upon my heart that in 1976

00:14:06.119 --> 00:14:07.999
during the Bicentennial,

00:14:07.999 --> 00:14:09.719
through the preaching of the word of God,

00:14:09.719 --> 00:14:11.839
God gave me a burden for revival.

00:14:12.719 --> 00:14:14.079
And that, listen, I'm gonna tell you,

00:14:14.079 --> 00:14:16.479
the flame has never burned out.

00:14:16.479 --> 00:14:18.440
It burns as brightly as it did

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:22.959
when God called me to the ministry of revival in 1976.

00:14:23.679 --> 00:14:25.879
Now, I pastored for 14 years,

00:14:25.879 --> 00:14:27.359
and I'm glad I had that experience

00:14:27.359 --> 00:14:29.720
because it prepared me for revival work.

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:31.399
I personally believe the best evangelists

00:14:31.399 --> 00:14:32.839
are men who have pastored

00:14:33.799 --> 00:14:36.159
because they understand the heart of a pastor.

00:14:36.159 --> 00:14:37.319
So when they come into a church

00:14:37.319 --> 00:14:39.239
to lead a meeting like this one here,

00:14:39.239 --> 00:14:41.279
they know what a pastor's burdens and concerns

00:14:41.279 --> 00:14:42.879
and battles and struggles are,

00:14:42.879 --> 00:14:45.119
so it allows him to come alongside of that pastor

00:14:45.119 --> 00:14:46.720
and minister to him because he's been there,

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.199
done that, worn a T-shirt.

00:14:49.679 --> 00:14:51.319
Amen?

00:14:51.319 --> 00:14:52.519
He's been there.

00:14:52.519 --> 00:14:54.119
And so he understands that.

00:14:54.119 --> 00:14:57.000
So I'm saying that just as a way of personal testimony

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.799
that even though I don't like some things

00:14:58.799 --> 00:15:00.599
about the ministry that God has put us in,

00:15:00.599 --> 00:15:01.919
I love what I'm doing,

00:15:01.919 --> 00:15:04.239
and I wanna be in the center of God's perfect will

00:15:04.239 --> 00:15:05.759
whether I like it or not.

00:15:05.759 --> 00:15:07.519
Does everybody understand what I'm saying?

00:15:07.519 --> 00:15:09.519
It's not fun to live out of a suitcase.

00:15:10.799 --> 00:15:12.759
It isn't fun to drive mile after mile

00:15:12.759 --> 00:15:14.119
after mile after mile after mile,

00:15:14.119 --> 00:15:15.359
especially at our age right now

00:15:15.359 --> 00:15:18.279
because it gets more and more difficult as time goes on.

00:15:18.279 --> 00:15:20.799
And it isn't a lot of fun to be itinerant,

00:15:20.799 --> 00:15:22.440
but the bottom line is is it doesn't matter

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:23.279
whether it's fun or not.

00:15:23.279 --> 00:15:24.239
It doesn't matter if we like it or not.

00:15:24.239 --> 00:15:25.479
We're doing what God wants us to do

00:15:25.479 --> 00:15:27.359
and praise the Lord, it's a joy.

00:15:30.159 --> 00:15:31.559
It's a joy.

00:15:31.559 --> 00:15:33.559
It's just a blessing to be in the center

00:15:33.559 --> 00:15:34.919
of God's perfect will.

00:15:36.799 --> 00:15:40.959
When I walk into a sanctuary like this one here,

00:15:40.959 --> 00:15:42.159
I'm in my element.

00:15:43.599 --> 00:15:44.440
Amen?

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:45.959
Now listen, I did a career in the Navy

00:15:45.959 --> 00:15:48.000
and I worked flight decks and aircraft carriers

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.759
all my career, worked with explosives every day.

00:15:50.799 --> 00:15:52.319
And when I stepped up on the flight deck

00:15:52.319 --> 00:15:55.319
of an aircraft carrier, I was in my element.

00:15:55.319 --> 00:15:57.359
That's where I belonged.

00:15:57.359 --> 00:15:58.959
That's what I trained for.

00:15:58.959 --> 00:16:00.679
That's what I wanted to be doing.

00:16:00.679 --> 00:16:01.720
I didn't want to be anywhere else.

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:02.839
If I was gonna have to be at sea,

00:16:02.839 --> 00:16:03.879
I wanted to be on the flight deck.

00:16:03.879 --> 00:16:05.559
I wanted to be up there during flight operations.

00:16:05.559 --> 00:16:07.279
I wanted to be around airplanes.

00:16:07.279 --> 00:16:09.239
I wanted to smell jet exhaust.

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:12.279
You know?

00:16:13.159 --> 00:16:15.679
But God called me away from that

00:16:15.679 --> 00:16:17.079
and put me into ministry.

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:19.519
And I rejoice in that.

00:16:19.519 --> 00:16:21.440
So when I walk in the door of a church like this,

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:22.479
I'm in my element.

00:16:23.479 --> 00:16:25.479
And I just smile.

00:16:25.479 --> 00:16:26.319
If you ever watch me,

00:16:26.319 --> 00:16:29.079
when I come in the back door of a church house, I smile.

00:16:29.079 --> 00:16:30.279
I'm happy.

00:16:30.279 --> 00:16:33.079
I'm bright-eyed, bushy-tailed and ready to go.

00:16:34.039 --> 00:16:35.799
And you know, as long as God lets me do it,

00:16:35.799 --> 00:16:37.239
I'm glad that I'm able to do it.

00:16:37.239 --> 00:16:39.239
I'm just sharing my testimony here.

00:16:39.239 --> 00:16:40.799
If I were tomorrow morning, say,

00:16:40.799 --> 00:16:41.959
well, you know what?

00:16:41.959 --> 00:16:43.479
I think I just don't like this anymore.

00:16:43.479 --> 00:16:44.759
Think I'll go do something else.

00:16:44.759 --> 00:16:46.479
Well, at the age of 77, what am I gonna do?

00:16:46.479 --> 00:16:47.720
Be a Walmart greeter?

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:51.479
Amen.

00:16:51.479 --> 00:16:53.359
I don't even know if I could do that.

00:16:55.239 --> 00:16:57.639
It's hard enough to stand up a couple hours

00:16:57.639 --> 00:16:59.399
on a Sunday anymore.

00:16:59.399 --> 00:17:02.079
But I mean, what would I do?

00:17:02.079 --> 00:17:04.479
God's given me enough stamina and health

00:17:04.479 --> 00:17:05.559
to be able to do this.

00:17:05.559 --> 00:17:08.039
And not only that, but the burden is still there.

00:17:09.279 --> 00:17:12.199
So why would I want to walk away from this?

00:17:12.199 --> 00:17:14.000
You know, God put me in it

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.479
and God knows when to take me out of it.

00:17:17.479 --> 00:17:18.919
Someone said, oh, well, you know what, preacher?

00:17:18.919 --> 00:17:20.519
I don't see any retirement.

00:17:20.519 --> 00:17:22.879
There's no doctrine in the Bible about preachers retiring.

00:17:22.879 --> 00:17:24.039
I agree with that.

00:17:24.039 --> 00:17:25.759
We don't retire, we just kind of re-fire

00:17:25.759 --> 00:17:27.519
and just keep on going, I guess.

00:17:28.919 --> 00:17:30.720
You know, here in Virginia, there was a guy,

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:31.559
I gotta move on,

00:17:31.559 --> 00:17:33.479
because I'm gonna preach another message here.

00:17:33.479 --> 00:17:36.319
There used to be a guy here in Virginia

00:17:36.319 --> 00:17:39.759
that was an evangelist over here in Western Virginia.

00:17:39.759 --> 00:17:42.119
He was booked for four years.

00:17:42.119 --> 00:17:44.399
He had four years worth of meetings.

00:17:44.599 --> 00:17:46.799
And the guy was 107 years old.

00:17:48.839 --> 00:17:53.559
107, preaching revival meetings at 107.

00:17:53.559 --> 00:17:55.000
And I'm thinking, man, I'm a young man

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000
when you think about a guy 107 years old, amen?

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.319
And I never forget, Vance Habner said that,

00:18:01.319 --> 00:18:03.000
if anybody knows who old Vance Habner was,

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.159
Vance Habner said that he went over to meet this guy

00:18:06.159 --> 00:18:07.479
and fellowship with him.

00:18:07.479 --> 00:18:09.720
And Vance at that time was in his early 80s

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:11.599
and he was getting ready to retire.

00:18:11.599 --> 00:18:13.399
And he went over there and met with his dear brother

00:18:13.399 --> 00:18:14.720
and he said, hey, he said,

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:17.000
I spent about three or four days with him

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.199
and came away from that thinking I was a young man

00:18:20.199 --> 00:18:22.039
and went back to work.

00:18:22.039 --> 00:18:24.079
107 years old.

00:18:24.079 --> 00:18:26.639
This dear brother didn't have a tooth in his head.

00:18:26.639 --> 00:18:28.479
Amen?

00:18:28.479 --> 00:18:30.919
And sometimes he's wheelchair born.

00:18:30.919 --> 00:18:32.320
Or they roll him up on the platform,

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:33.519
he'd sleep through the preliminaries,

00:18:33.519 --> 00:18:34.839
come time to preach, stand him up,

00:18:34.839 --> 00:18:36.839
the pulpit, he let it rip for 90 minutes.

00:18:38.839 --> 00:18:42.599
And they said he did not have to have amplifiers

00:18:42.599 --> 00:18:43.959
and he did not have to have amplification.

00:18:43.959 --> 00:18:46.239
You could hear him two miles away.

00:18:46.239 --> 00:18:47.959
Billy Sonny used to say that

00:18:47.959 --> 00:18:49.640
if you couldn't be heard two miles away,

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:52.159
God probably didn't call you to preach.

00:18:52.159 --> 00:18:55.039
Your pastor definitely got the call of God on him, amen?

00:18:55.919 --> 00:18:57.679
Yeah, he could stand out here in the back porch

00:18:57.679 --> 00:18:59.760
and they could hear him all over the neighborhood for sure.

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:02.320
He's got that booming voice, amen?

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:05.320
But I mean, it's being in the center of God's perfect will.

00:19:07.039 --> 00:19:08.799
So I get asked, do you enjoy your ministry?

00:19:08.799 --> 00:19:09.640
Immensely.

00:19:09.839 --> 00:19:10.679
I just do.

00:19:11.599 --> 00:19:14.640
I mean, just being here tonight's just a joy for me.

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:17.159
Now I'm gonna take a look at Jonah.

00:19:17.159 --> 00:19:19.559
W.A. Criswell used to call him Jonah.

00:19:19.559 --> 00:19:21.799
I'm gonna take a look at Jonah tonight

00:19:21.799 --> 00:19:24.039
and I'm gonna share some thoughts with you about Jonah.

00:19:24.039 --> 00:19:29.039
Now Jonah was a disobedient prophet.

00:19:29.039 --> 00:19:29.959
By the way, he was a prophet.

00:19:29.959 --> 00:19:31.519
This is one of the minor prophets here tonight,

00:19:31.519 --> 00:19:34.440
the book of Jonah, he was a prophet.

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:38.039
By the way, his name, Jonah means dove.

00:19:38.039 --> 00:19:40.320
He was the tribe of Zebulun.

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:42.359
Interesting man, this man, the tribe of Zebulun.

00:19:42.359 --> 00:19:43.919
You can find out everything you need to know about him.

00:19:43.919 --> 00:19:45.320
There's not much about him in the Bible.

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:46.719
In fact, I just marked my Bible today.

00:19:46.719 --> 00:19:47.679
You can find something about him

00:19:47.679 --> 00:19:50.320
back in 1 Kings chapter 14.

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:52.320
We see here, he restored the coast of Israel

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:54.399
from the entering into Hamath into the sea of the plain,

00:19:54.399 --> 00:19:56.000
according to the word of the Lord of Israel,

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.799
which he spake by the hand of his servant Jonah.

00:19:58.799 --> 00:20:00.479
He restored the coast of Israel

00:20:00.479 --> 00:20:02.799
from the entering into Hamath into the sea of the plain,

00:20:02.799 --> 00:20:04.599
according to the word of the Lord of Israel,

00:20:04.599 --> 00:20:07.200
which he spake by the hand of his servant Jonah.

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:10.480
Jonah, the son of Amittai, the prophet which was of

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:14.340
Gathhefer." So we know that he was a prophet, the Word of

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:18.880
God declared him to be a prophet. And so Jonah, as we

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:21.560
take a look at the Bible tonight we realize Jonah was a

00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:27.860
disobedient servant of God. He wasn't doing what God had

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:30.800
called him to do. He was being totally disobedient. He was

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:33.340
running from the Lord. And I submit unto you tonight he's

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:35.600
not the only one that's running from God. There are

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:37.900
many others that are running from God today and that's a

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:42.140
shame, ought not to be so. We ought not to run from Him,

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:46.380
we ought to run to Him. So look at chapter 1, look at

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:48.380
Jonah chapter 1, I'm going to start there. It says,

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:50.580
The Word of the Lord came unto Jonah the son of Amittai.

00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:52.720
Now I want you to notice what it says, The Word of the

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:56.380
Lord came unto him. So God spoke to him, God called him

00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:59.720
and God commissioned him. So basically He was sending him

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:02.260
as a missionary evangelist and we're going to see here in a

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:06.460
minute the city of Nineveh. Now it's interesting the city

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:08.760
of Nineveh was an interesting place. It was a huge city, it

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:10.960
was a large city, it took three days to walk across that

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.280
city. And I notice this that the city had walls that were

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:21.280
100 feet high. They were 50 feet thick. There were 1,500

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:25.480
towers around that city that were 60 foot apart. The wall

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:27.780
was so broad that three chariots could go around that

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:31.120
wall abreast. The adult population of Nineveh was

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:36.260
120,000. The city was 60 miles across. It was the Assyrian

00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:41.000
capital from 5,000 B.C. to 612 B.C. and it was located in

00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:43.600
the country today that we would know as Iraq on the

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:46.760
Tigris River and in actuality it's located where the city

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:51.740
of Mosul would be. So this was an ancient city. Now let me

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:56.740
say something about Nineveh. Nineveh was a wicked place. It

00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:00.540
was an ungodly, wicked city. It was pantheistic. It was

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:04.400
evil in every way, shape and form. There was nothing good

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:07.680
about what was going on in Nineveh. They were at war all

00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:10.140
the time. They were just an ungodly people. They were

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:15.520
bloodthirsty people. They were just a vile group of people.

00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:18.480
Now the Lord came unto Jonah the son of Amittai saying,

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:21.480
Arise and go to Nineveh that great city. Now notice what he

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:24.900
says and cry against it. So I'll tell you what I want you

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:26.960
to do, Jonah. I want you to go into the city and I want you

00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:30.620
to preach their sin. I want you to go into that city and

00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:32.860
I want you to tell them they better get right with me. And

00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:37.100
I want you to cry against it for their wickedness has come

00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:41.200
up before me. But look what Jonah did. But Jonah rose up to

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:45.540
flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the Lord, from the

00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:48.480
presence of the Lord. And he went down to Joppa and he

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:50.780
found the ship going to Tarshish. So he paid the

00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:54.180
fair grub and he went down into it to go with them unto

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:58.740
Tarshish from the presence of the Lord. So Jonah said, No,

00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:02.480
I'm not going. He said, I don't care. Listen, I don't

00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:05.040
care if you call me. I don't care if you commission me. I

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:08.740
don't care if you told me to go. I'm going to disobey. I'm

00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:11.780
not going. And you know why he wouldn't go? Because he hated

00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:19.220
the Ninevites. But God loved them. For God so loved the

00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:21.160
world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:22.800
believeth in Him should not perish but have everlasting

00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:25.520
life. But God commended His love toward us. And while we

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:29.320
were yet sinners Christ died for us, amen. Praise the Lord

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:32.860
for that. He hated the Ninevites but God loved them.

00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:36.060
And God wanted to demonstrate and extend mercy to them. They

00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:38.360
might have an opportunity to turn from their sin, repent

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:43.500
and be saved. And Jonah said, I'm not going. Now don't you

00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:48.340
think that God already knew it was in Jonah's heart? Don't

00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:50.920
you think that God already knew that Jonah was already

00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:53.400
disobedient? Let me tell you this, Jonah was disobedient

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:57.440
before God ever called him to go to Nineveh. His heart was

00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:59.880
not right with God before God called him to go to Nineveh.

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:03.140
So you would ask yourself the question, why would God call

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:06.320
someone like that? Because He, because God wanted to use

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:13.980
Him. God wanted to use Jonah in spite of Himself. Now

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:17.320
sometimes, He's done that in your life and my life. God

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:21.660
sometimes uses us in spite of ourselves. And God didn't say

00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:24.600
no ifs, ands, or buts. He said, Jonah I want you to go to

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:28.300
Nineveh and I want you to cry against their sin. That's what

00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:31.000
He commanded to do. Now what did Jonah do? I want you to

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:33.640
get this because this is an important point. He fled from

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:40.180
the presence of the Lord. He got out of God's presence. He

00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:42.980
didn't even want to be in the presence of the Lord. He fled

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:45.559
the presence of the Lord. He ran as hard and as fast as he

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:48.400
could away from God and away from God's will for his life.

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:51.940
And I would spit unto you tonight that that's not an

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:54.680
uncommon thing amongst God's people sometimes. And it's

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:58.000
really to me discouraging as I watch people that God wants to

00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:01.080
use that they refuse to be used to the Lord because they have

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:07.520
their own agenda. Certainly Jonah had his own agenda. He

00:25:07.559 --> 00:25:11.860
just said to the Lord, I'm not going. What if God were to

00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:16.660
call you to the mission field tonight? You know? Sometimes we

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:19.140
try to make these deals with God. You can't make a deal with

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:21.300
God. If God calls you to go do something you've just got to go

00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:25.900
do it. You know? And so now Jonah you would have thought

00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:29.080
that this man being a prophet, a man of God, a preacher of the

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:31.440
Gospel of Jesus Christ, you would think this man would be

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:34.340
excited about the fact that God is sending me a people to

00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:36.580
preach the Word of God to them and there is an opportunity for

00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:39.460
them to be saved. And what a joy it would be to see revival

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:42.020
break out amongst those people. Man, I'm excited about going

00:25:42.059 --> 00:25:47.260
down there. Not him. Now, God could have set him aside and

00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:52.540
called somebody else. God has a replacement program. If you

00:25:52.559 --> 00:25:55.500
won't go and you won't do then God has somebody else that He

00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:57.580
can send and then you'll lose the blessing. You'll not get

00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:01.040
the blessing. You can apply this in so many different ways in

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:04.440
your life, in so many different things in your life, so many

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:07.380
different facets of your life. So Jonah said, no I'm not

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:10.180
going. I mean can you imagine him telling, I mean who does he

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:17.420
think he is to tell God no? You know? But he did. He said,

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:22.080
nope I'm not going. And he fled from the presence of the Lord.

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:26.420
He got out of His presence. So verse 3, But Jonah rose up to

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:31.960
flee, to run unto Tarshish from the presence of the Lord. And

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.460
he went down to Joppa, and he found a ship going to Tarshish,

00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:37.520
so he paid the fare thereof, and he went down into it to go

00:26:37.559 --> 00:26:40.820
with him into Tarshish from the presence of the Lord. That's the

00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:44.020
second time I've said it. But the Lord sent out a great wind

00:26:44.059 --> 00:26:48.460
into the sea. And there was a mighty tempest in the sea, so

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:52.740
that the ship was like to be broken. Then the mariners, and

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:56.400
these were ungodly pagan men, then the mariners were afraid.

00:26:56.440 --> 00:27:00.279
Well I guess so. I'll tell you what you've not lived till you

00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:04.600
seen a full-blown storm at sea. I've been in 40 foot seas, and

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:07.740
even 50 foot seas, and I can tell you it's a pretty

00:27:07.779 --> 00:27:11.340
frightening thing. Then the mariners were afraid, and cried

00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:14.680
every man unto his God, and cast forth the wares that were in

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:17.760
the ship unto the sea, and delighted of them. But Jonah

00:27:17.779 --> 00:27:21.120
was gone down into the sides of the ship, and lay and was fast

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:24.860
asleep. So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him,

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:29.360
What meanest thou, O sleeper? Now there in the midst of the

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:33.680
storm this guy is sleeping. That's how indifferent and

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:37.320
apathetic he was. By the way this storm is all because of

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:43.360
him. Arise, call upon thy God. It's interesting to me that

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:45.300
these pagan men who were praying to their gods

00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:50.200
inevitably, that these ungodly men recognized His God, big G

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:53.279
God, amen. And so be that God will think upon us, and we

00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:55.980
perish not. And they said, Everyone to his fellow come,

00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:59.340
let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil

00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:04.140
is upon us. So they cast lots, and a lot fell upon Jonah. Then

00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:06.880
said they unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:10.980
this evil is upon us. Now look at this, they said, What is

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:16.320
thine occupation? Who are you? Where did you come from? And

00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:19.200
what are you all about? And by the way, what is thine

00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:23.559
occupation? And whence comest thou? What is thy country, and

00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:27.020
of what people art thou? Verse 9, And he said unto them, I

00:28:27.059 --> 00:28:32.520
am an Hebrew, and I fear the Lord, the God of heaven, which

00:28:32.559 --> 00:28:35.320
hath made the sea and the dry land. Well, you know what,

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:39.760
that's a flat out lie. That's exactly what that is, that's a

00:28:39.799 --> 00:28:44.799
flat out lie. He didn't fear God, not one whit. I mean he

00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:47.600
ran from God, he fled from the presence of God, he disobeyed

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:50.640
God, he said no to God. And so I'm just going to do what I

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:53.960
want to do. I'm just going to run my own agenda. And he's

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.859
telling these people, listen, I'm a Hebrew, I'm a Baptist

00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:58.940
preacher. God has sent me to go preach to these people down

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:00.900
here, and I'm not going, don't want to go, don't want nothing

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:02.739
to do with that. And he says, oh, by the way, and I fear

00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:05.239
God. No, he didn't, or he wouldn't have done what he did.

00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:09.940
Verse 10, Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:12.580
unto him, Now look at this, this is really to me an amazing

00:29:12.619 --> 00:29:18.820
thing. Why hast thou done this? Why have you done this? Why

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:21.440
have you done this thing that you're doing? Because they

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:23.640
obviously began to put things together and connecting the

00:29:23.679 --> 00:29:26.080
dots, and they were beginning to come up with, you know what,

00:29:26.119 --> 00:29:28.580
two and two does equal four. They figured something wasn't

00:29:28.619 --> 00:29:30.419
right about this whole thing, and they realized everything

00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:32.660
that was going on that they were experiencing right here was

00:29:32.679 --> 00:29:36.559
because of him. Now, let me say this, if you don't get

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:38.660
anything else out of the message get this, your

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:43.859
disobedience, my disobedience, your sin, and my sin doesn't

00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:47.200
just affect you individually, or me individually, it affects

00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:54.859
many others. It affects many others. Even if you come into

00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:57.299
this church building with sin in your heart and your life,

00:29:57.320 --> 00:30:00.299
and you're living in a sinful situation, you're actually

00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:04.400
polluting this church, because your sin is going to affect

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:07.179
others. It will affect your home, your family, your

00:30:07.179 --> 00:30:11.359
or marriage or children, it affects others as well.

00:30:11.359 --> 00:30:14.119
And listen, what his sin and his disobedience

00:30:14.119 --> 00:30:16.059
and his running from God and fleeing from his presence

00:30:16.059 --> 00:30:16.959
and being out of the will of the Lord

00:30:16.959 --> 00:30:18.559
was affecting these other men.

00:30:18.559 --> 00:30:21.959
And these men had nothing to do with it.

00:30:21.959 --> 00:30:24.159
They had nothing to do with it at all.

00:30:24.159 --> 00:30:26.699
But they're being affected by it.

00:30:26.699 --> 00:30:28.499
And so they make this statement,

00:30:28.499 --> 00:30:29.939
they say, why have you done this?

00:30:29.939 --> 00:30:31.079
Why hast thou done this?

00:30:31.079 --> 00:30:33.199
For the men knew that he fled

00:30:33.199 --> 00:30:35.279
from the presence of the Lord because he told them.

00:30:35.419 --> 00:30:37.779
All right, let's stop and think about that for a minute.

00:30:37.779 --> 00:30:42.359
The men knew he was fleeing from the presence of the Lord.

00:30:45.419 --> 00:30:47.319
You know what that affects?

00:30:47.319 --> 00:30:48.619
It affects your testimony.

00:30:51.099 --> 00:30:56.099
Jonah's testimony was being deleteriously affected

00:30:57.999 --> 00:31:01.179
by these men recognizing that he was running from God.

00:31:01.179 --> 00:31:02.019
Why?

00:31:04.839 --> 00:31:06.319
They figured that out.

00:31:07.759 --> 00:31:10.719
There's no question in their minds what he's doing.

00:31:10.719 --> 00:31:13.359
And he lied when he said, well, I fear God.

00:31:13.359 --> 00:31:14.919
There's no question, no, no.

00:31:14.919 --> 00:31:17.099
Listen, if he feared God, he wouldn't have disobeyed God

00:31:17.099 --> 00:31:18.299
to begin with and he would have done

00:31:18.299 --> 00:31:19.799
what God had called him to do.

00:31:21.999 --> 00:31:23.699
But he's fleeing from the presence of the Lord.

00:31:23.699 --> 00:31:27.639
And these men said, listen, why have you done this?

00:31:27.639 --> 00:31:29.079
Why are you fleeing from your God?

00:31:29.079 --> 00:31:30.339
Why are you not doing?

00:31:30.339 --> 00:31:31.739
And so it's affecting them.

00:31:31.739 --> 00:31:34.199
And so his testimony is completely and totally

00:31:34.199 --> 00:31:37.279
and absolutely affected by what he's done.

00:31:38.639 --> 00:31:40.339
Obviously, these men can see this.

00:31:41.539 --> 00:31:44.119
So there's a lot of dynamic involved

00:31:44.119 --> 00:31:45.619
in what's happening here.

00:31:45.619 --> 00:31:47.059
He's disobedient to God.

00:31:47.059 --> 00:31:49.359
He's disobedient to his call and his commission.

00:31:49.359 --> 00:31:50.859
He's out of the will of God.

00:31:50.859 --> 00:31:52.059
He's running from God.

00:31:52.059 --> 00:31:53.299
He's fleeing from the presence of God.

00:31:53.299 --> 00:31:54.859
He said no to God.

00:31:56.259 --> 00:31:58.799
And he's just basically acting out his own agenda.

00:31:59.559 --> 00:32:03.159
He's involved in exercising his own self-will.

00:32:04.699 --> 00:32:07.799
That can only end in tragedy and disaster.

00:32:07.799 --> 00:32:09.699
It always does.

00:32:09.699 --> 00:32:12.739
And like I said, you take people with you

00:32:12.739 --> 00:32:14.699
when you do these kinds of things.

00:32:14.699 --> 00:32:16.439
So these men are being affected by this.

00:32:16.439 --> 00:32:19.939
These are men that really had no part in this at all.

00:32:19.939 --> 00:32:21.419
These are, if you want to say they're innocent,

00:32:21.419 --> 00:32:22.839
these are innocent men.

00:32:22.839 --> 00:32:25.659
Their collateral damage is what they are.

00:32:25.719 --> 00:32:27.719
So in verse 12 or verse 11,

00:32:28.919 --> 00:32:30.579
he had told them this, he said, I'm running from God.

00:32:30.579 --> 00:32:32.019
You mentioned that, let me read that again.

00:32:32.019 --> 00:32:35.259
Verse 10, then were the men exceedingly afraid

00:32:35.259 --> 00:32:36.899
and said unto him, why hast thou done this?

00:32:36.899 --> 00:32:39.299
For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the Lord

00:32:39.299 --> 00:32:40.799
because he told them.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.699
He told them.

00:32:45.699 --> 00:32:47.079
He said, hey, you know what?

00:32:47.079 --> 00:32:49.679
He said, this whole thing is going on right here.

00:32:49.679 --> 00:32:52.279
It's, I'm running from God.

00:32:53.199 --> 00:32:58.199
At least he admitted that, I'm running from God.

00:32:59.339 --> 00:33:01.919
Verse 11, they said, then they said unto him,

00:33:01.919 --> 00:33:03.579
what shall we do unto thee?

00:33:03.579 --> 00:33:07.019
That the sea may come unto us, be calm unto us.

00:33:07.019 --> 00:33:09.379
For the sea water was tempestuous.

00:33:09.379 --> 00:33:10.879
And he said unto them, take me up

00:33:10.879 --> 00:33:12.319
and cast me forth into the sea,

00:33:12.319 --> 00:33:14.899
so shall the sea be calm unto you.

00:33:14.899 --> 00:33:16.819
Now look, for I know that for my sake,

00:33:16.819 --> 00:33:18.559
this great tempest is upon you.

00:33:19.539 --> 00:33:22.919
Nevertheless, the men rode hard to bring it to land,

00:33:22.919 --> 00:33:24.419
but they could not for the sea water

00:33:24.419 --> 00:33:25.759
was tempestuous against them.

00:33:25.759 --> 00:33:27.519
So they were afraid to throw him over the side

00:33:27.519 --> 00:33:29.919
because they're now becoming afraid of his God.

00:33:31.459 --> 00:33:34.759
Verse 14, wherefore they cried unto the Lord

00:33:34.759 --> 00:33:37.699
and said, we beseech thee, O Lord, we beseech thee,

00:33:37.699 --> 00:33:40.539
let us not perish for this man's life

00:33:40.539 --> 00:33:42.379
and lay not upon us innocent blood

00:33:42.379 --> 00:33:46.839
for thou, O Lord, hast done as it please thee.

00:33:47.459 --> 00:33:48.799
Now, can you imagine that?

00:33:48.799 --> 00:33:51.099
Now they're not praying to these false gods of theirs,

00:33:51.099 --> 00:33:55.259
now they're praying to God of heaven, to Jonah's God.

00:33:55.259 --> 00:33:58.699
So they took up Jonah and cast him forth into the sea

00:33:58.699 --> 00:34:01.339
and the sea ceased from a raging.

00:34:01.339 --> 00:34:04.279
Then the men feared the Lord exceedingly

00:34:04.279 --> 00:34:07.319
and offered a sacrifice unto the Lord and made vows.

00:34:08.719 --> 00:34:09.979
Now I don't know about you,

00:34:09.979 --> 00:34:11.659
but I see something wonderful in verse 16.

00:34:12.719 --> 00:34:14.819
They offered sacrifice unto the Lord.

00:34:15.799 --> 00:34:18.500
Well, listen, when I see they did that,

00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:21.279
it causes me to be reminded of the fact

00:34:21.279 --> 00:34:23.339
that there's only one sacrifice that's saved from sin

00:34:23.339 --> 00:34:25.940
and that's the blood sacrifice of Jesus Christ

00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:27.139
and the cross of Calvary.

00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:30.179
So they made sacrifice to the Lord and made vows.

00:34:30.179 --> 00:34:31.019
You know what I think?

00:34:31.019 --> 00:34:33.779
I think these men got saved right here.

00:34:33.779 --> 00:34:36.899
I think they put their faith and trust in Jonah's God

00:34:36.899 --> 00:34:38.660
in spite of him.

00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:41.600
And to me, that's an amazing thing.

00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:43.699
And so they made vows.

00:34:44.179 --> 00:34:45.779
Verse 17.

00:34:45.779 --> 00:34:48.299
Now the Lord had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah.

00:34:48.299 --> 00:34:50.619
And of course, the New Testament says whale.

00:34:50.619 --> 00:34:53.380
And the Lord had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah.

00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:55.059
And Jonah was in the belly of the fish

00:34:55.059 --> 00:34:56.039
three days and three nights.

00:34:56.039 --> 00:34:57.859
We know that's a messianic statement.

00:34:57.859 --> 00:34:59.979
Matthew 12, 40 says this.

00:34:59.979 --> 00:35:02.179
As Jonah was in the belly of the fish or the whale

00:35:02.179 --> 00:35:03.139
three days and three nights,

00:35:03.139 --> 00:35:04.419
so is the son of man the heart of the earth.

00:35:04.419 --> 00:35:06.639
We know that's a messianic statement in scripture there,

00:35:06.639 --> 00:35:09.380
but nonetheless, there's something practically seen to this.

00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:12.419
He's in the belly of this fish for three days

00:35:12.419 --> 00:35:13.639
and three nights.

00:35:14.679 --> 00:35:16.179
Now, you know, you stop and think about that

00:35:16.179 --> 00:35:17.579
and you say, well, that's just absolutely

00:35:17.579 --> 00:35:19.820
a biological impossibility for anybody to survive

00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:22.539
in the belly of a fish or a whale.

00:35:22.539 --> 00:35:25.179
But the hand of God was upon him in spite of himself.

00:35:26.179 --> 00:35:28.139
I mean, that's an interesting thing

00:35:28.139 --> 00:35:30.820
that he was able to survive three days and three nights

00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:31.820
in the belly of this fish.

00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:33.820
First chapter two, verse one.

00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:36.660
Then Jonah prayed unto the Lord his God

00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:37.979
out of the fish's belly.

00:35:38.739 --> 00:35:41.019
And he said, I cried by reason of mine affliction

00:35:41.019 --> 00:35:43.500
unto the Lord and he heard me out of the belly of hell,

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:46.660
Sheol, and of course that can reference the grave as well,

00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:49.820
cried I and thou heardest my voice.

00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:51.179
For thou hast cast me into the deep

00:35:51.179 --> 00:35:52.259
and the midst of the seas

00:35:52.259 --> 00:35:54.259
and the floods come past me about

00:35:54.259 --> 00:35:57.500
and all the billows and thy waves passed over me.

00:35:57.500 --> 00:35:59.220
Then I said, I'm cast out of thy sight

00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:02.059
yet I will look again toward the holy temple.

00:36:02.059 --> 00:36:04.299
Verse five says, the waters can pass me about

00:36:04.299 --> 00:36:05.579
even to the soul.

00:36:06.019 --> 00:36:07.660
The depth closed me round about,

00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:09.699
the weeds were wrapped about my head.

00:36:09.699 --> 00:36:11.459
I went down to the bottoms of the mountains,

00:36:11.459 --> 00:36:14.539
the earth with her bars was about me forever

00:36:14.539 --> 00:36:17.380
yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption,

00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:18.699
O Lord my God.

00:36:18.699 --> 00:36:20.100
When my soul fainted within me,

00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:22.339
I remembered the Lord and my prayer

00:36:22.339 --> 00:36:25.699
came in unto thee into thy holy temple.

00:36:25.699 --> 00:36:28.459
They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy

00:36:28.459 --> 00:36:29.979
but I will sacrifice unto thee

00:36:29.979 --> 00:36:31.220
with the voice of thanksgiving,

00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:34.539
I will pay that thy vowed salvations of the Lord.

00:36:34.619 --> 00:36:36.660
And the Lord spake unto the fish

00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:40.380
and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.

00:36:41.859 --> 00:36:43.339
Huh?

00:36:43.339 --> 00:36:44.859
Think about that.

00:36:44.859 --> 00:36:46.500
What do you think he'd look like?

00:36:47.579 --> 00:36:48.779
I mean, think about the fact

00:36:48.779 --> 00:36:51.500
that he'd been in the belly of this fish for three days.

00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:53.139
What do you think he'd look like?

00:36:54.579 --> 00:36:57.259
He probably looked like he was probably a mess, amen?

00:36:58.539 --> 00:37:00.419
God got him where he wanted him to be

00:37:00.419 --> 00:37:01.619
but he got him there the hard way.

00:37:01.619 --> 00:37:02.660
He didn't have to go the hard way,

00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:04.259
he could have gone God's way.

00:37:06.739 --> 00:37:08.059
Could have gone God's way.

00:37:08.979 --> 00:37:10.699
Chapter three, I see this, stick with me,

00:37:10.699 --> 00:37:12.299
I'm getting pretty close to the end here

00:37:12.299 --> 00:37:14.899
but it says, and the word of the Lord came unto Jonah

00:37:14.899 --> 00:37:17.779
the second time saying,

00:37:17.779 --> 00:37:19.500
Arise and go to Nineveh, that great city

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:21.940
and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee.

00:37:23.139 --> 00:37:24.979
So Jonah rose and went into Nineveh

00:37:24.979 --> 00:37:26.220
according to the word of the Lord.

00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:27.059
Now, I'll tell you what,

00:37:27.059 --> 00:37:29.859
he went in there reluctantly, I'm sure.

00:37:29.859 --> 00:37:33.139
Because his attitude towards Nineveh had not changed.

00:37:33.139 --> 00:37:34.859
Now, Nineveh was an exceeding great city

00:37:34.859 --> 00:37:35.699
of three days journey.

00:37:35.699 --> 00:37:38.139
He took that long walk across that city

00:37:38.139 --> 00:37:40.619
and Jonah began to enter that city a day's journey

00:37:40.619 --> 00:37:41.459
and he cried.

00:37:41.459 --> 00:37:44.539
That word in the Hebrew means to loudly proclaim.

00:37:44.539 --> 00:37:45.779
And he cried and he said,

00:37:45.779 --> 00:37:48.539
yet 40 days and Nineveh shall be overthrown.

00:37:50.979 --> 00:37:53.100
Friends, that's a eight word message.

00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:56.660
That's an eight word sermon.

00:37:56.660 --> 00:37:58.259
That's it.

00:37:58.259 --> 00:38:00.739
He delivered the message God wanted him to deliver.

00:38:00.739 --> 00:38:01.579
That was it.

00:38:03.139 --> 00:38:04.059
Wouldn't it have been a whole lot better

00:38:04.059 --> 00:38:05.739
if Jonah had just gone ahead and done what God told him

00:38:05.739 --> 00:38:08.739
to go deliver the eight word message

00:38:08.739 --> 00:38:10.139
and get it over with and get it done,

00:38:10.139 --> 00:38:11.179
do what God called him to do

00:38:11.179 --> 00:38:12.380
and then he could have just rejoiced

00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:13.699
and seen what the Lord was gonna do.

00:38:13.699 --> 00:38:15.660
The great, I'm telling you,

00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:17.940
the great moving the spirit of God that took place here,

00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:18.899
we'll see in a minute.

00:38:18.899 --> 00:38:20.299
Wouldn't it have been a whole lot better

00:38:20.299 --> 00:38:21.619
if he just stayed in the will of God,

00:38:21.619 --> 00:38:22.820
not fled from the presence of God,

00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:25.019
just going and done what God told him to do?

00:38:26.019 --> 00:38:29.100
Sometimes God will call us to do things

00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:32.660
we may not in the human sense want to do.

00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:34.619
Sometimes God will impress upon our hearts

00:38:34.619 --> 00:38:37.100
some things that perhaps are difficult to do.

00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:40.059
Sometimes the Lord will tell us to do things

00:38:40.059 --> 00:38:41.419
that we would not ordinarily do,

00:38:41.419 --> 00:38:43.580
that are outside of the boundaries

00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:45.260
of what we would want to do.

00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:46.979
Sometimes God will do that.

00:38:48.339 --> 00:38:51.219
But he should have just gone ahead and done it.

00:38:51.219 --> 00:38:53.899
He wouldn't have had to get there the way he got there.

00:38:53.899 --> 00:38:55.299
Can you imagine what the Ninevites thought of him

00:38:55.299 --> 00:38:57.380
when he walked into the city?

00:38:57.380 --> 00:38:58.779
What is up with this guy?

00:39:00.539 --> 00:39:03.779
I mean, he obviously must not have looked very good.

00:39:03.779 --> 00:39:06.260
So he cried, he cried out against this city,

00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:09.219
yet 40 days and Nineveh shall be overthrown.

00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:12.739
So the people of Nineveh believed God.

00:39:13.739 --> 00:39:17.099
They believed him and they proclaimed it fast.

00:39:17.099 --> 00:39:20.580
They put on sackcloth from the greatest of them

00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:22.580
even to the least of them.

00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:24.140
For the word came unto the king of Nineveh

00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:26.380
and he rose from his throne and he laid his robe from him

00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:28.580
and he covered him with sackcloth and sat in ashes

00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:30.339
and he caused it to be proclaimed

00:39:30.339 --> 00:39:31.979
and published through Nineveh

00:39:31.979 --> 00:39:34.020
by the decree of the king and his nobles saying,

00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:37.859
let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock taste anything.

00:39:37.859 --> 00:39:40.219
Let them not feed nor drink water,

00:39:40.219 --> 00:39:42.339
but let man and beast be covered with sackcloth

00:39:42.339 --> 00:39:43.659
and cry mightily unto God.

00:39:43.659 --> 00:39:46.580
Yea, let them turn, everyone from his evil way

00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:48.899
and from the violence that is in their hands.

00:39:48.899 --> 00:39:50.859
Who can tell if God will turn and repent

00:39:50.859 --> 00:39:52.559
and turn away from his fierce anger

00:39:53.399 --> 00:39:54.239
that we perish not?

00:39:54.239 --> 00:39:56.320
And God saw their works.

00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:58.080
He saw their obedience.

00:39:58.080 --> 00:39:59.820
He saw they've been changed

00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:01.880
and they turned from their evil way

00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:03.559
and God repented of the evil that he had said

00:40:03.559 --> 00:40:05.520
that he would do unto them and he did it not.

00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:06.919
Of course, we know that in.

00:40:06.919 --> 00:40:09.059
Zephaniah foretold the destruction of Zephaniah 2,

00:40:09.099 --> 00:40:11.699
13 later on down the road. It was rather an interesting

00:40:11.739 --> 00:40:15.639
situation upon which God brought that destruction. But

00:40:15.659 --> 00:40:20.899
nonetheless here they repented. They repented. God

00:40:20.939 --> 00:40:25.219
took His unwilling servant and got him there in spite of

00:40:25.239 --> 00:40:27.319
Himself and got him there through some very difficult

00:40:27.339 --> 00:40:29.979
circumstances and put him in a position where he had to

00:40:30.019 --> 00:40:32.419
deliver the message that God had called him and

00:40:32.459 --> 00:40:35.019
commissioned him to do and impressed upon him. And he

00:40:35.019 --> 00:40:37.419
preached an eight word message and these people

00:40:37.459 --> 00:40:40.159
repented of their sin and revival broke out of the

00:40:40.199 --> 00:40:44.759
city. See, God loved them and God wanted to give them an

00:40:44.799 --> 00:40:49.899
opportunity to repent. And it's amazing to me that for

00:40:49.939 --> 00:40:54.399
whatever reason Jonah just didn't get it. He didn't have

00:40:54.439 --> 00:41:00.079
a merciful spirit. He was an extremely angry man. In fact,

00:41:00.119 --> 00:41:03.279
let's look at one more thing here before we start to wrap

00:41:03.279 --> 00:41:05.839
this up. But if you go into the next chapter, and I don't

00:41:05.879 --> 00:41:07.679
have time to finish it all, but if you look in the next

00:41:07.719 --> 00:41:11.319
chapter, chapter 4 and verse 1, look at this. But after

00:41:11.359 --> 00:41:13.859
this revival breaks out these people get right with God

00:41:13.879 --> 00:41:17.019
and repent of their sin. But it displeased Jonah exceedingly

00:41:17.059 --> 00:41:21.859
and he was very angry. He didn't want them to repent.

00:41:21.899 --> 00:41:27.539
And he prayed unto the Lord and he said, I pray thee O

00:41:27.559 --> 00:41:30.599
Lord was not this my saying when I was yet of my country

00:41:30.599 --> 00:41:33.499
therefore I fled before in a tarshish. For I knew, look at

00:41:33.539 --> 00:41:36.459
this, for I knew that thou art a gracious God, a merciful,

00:41:36.499 --> 00:41:39.199
slow to anger, and a great kindness, and repentancy of

00:41:39.239 --> 00:41:41.839
the evil. Therefore now O Lord take I beseech thee my life

00:41:41.879 --> 00:41:46.039
from me for it is better for me to die than to live. What

00:41:46.079 --> 00:41:50.339
kind of attitude is this? He said, I knew you were a

00:41:50.379 --> 00:41:52.579
merciful God. I knew you were a gracious God. I knew that I

00:41:52.619 --> 00:41:54.779
went in there and preached this message, they'd get right.

00:41:54.819 --> 00:41:58.019
He said, I knew that, but he said, I'm angry. I didn't want

00:41:58.239 --> 00:42:04.379
them to repent. Wow. Well, I'll tell you what, that's some

00:42:04.419 --> 00:42:12.219
kind of a horrible attitude. You know? Well, he should have

00:42:12.259 --> 00:42:16.159
been rejoicing. He should have been having a hallelujah fit.

00:42:16.199 --> 00:42:19.139
He should have been praising the Lord up and down the

00:42:19.159 --> 00:42:22.499
streets of Nineveh. He should have been excited about that.

00:42:22.919 --> 00:42:32.159
But instead he's angry. He's angry. Well, I guess he was

00:42:32.199 --> 00:42:35.439
still out of the will of God, then wasn't he? By the way,

00:42:35.459 --> 00:42:39.999
you don't see anything said about Jonah after this except

00:42:40.039 --> 00:42:42.979
for that one verse of Scripture which deals with the

00:42:42.999 --> 00:42:46.079
three days and three nights and the belly of the fish

00:42:46.119 --> 00:42:49.119
speaking messianically of the three days and three nights of

00:42:49.139 --> 00:42:51.179
Jesus being in the heart of the earth and then gloriously

00:42:51.399 --> 00:42:55.199
bodily resurrected from the dead, amen. By the way, no

00:42:55.239 --> 00:43:00.239
resurrection, no gospel. I mean, so really Jonah really

00:43:00.279 --> 00:43:04.879
kind of got set aside, didn't he? That's what I think. We

00:43:04.919 --> 00:43:10.719
don't hear anything from him or about him again. Whereas the

00:43:10.759 --> 00:43:14.519
other prophets you hear about them again and you see the

00:43:14.559 --> 00:43:16.919
kind of life and ministry they had. I think of Isaiah,

00:43:16.959 --> 00:43:19.659
Jeremiah, Ezekiel. I think of some of these major prophets,

00:43:19.679 --> 00:43:22.379
Daniel. You look at those books and you see these men were

00:43:22.419 --> 00:43:24.679
mighty used of God and you see a totally different spirit.

00:43:24.719 --> 00:43:30.219
But of Jonah you don't see him really ever mentioned again. So

00:43:30.259 --> 00:43:32.759
he did not many mighty works, although God used him in a

00:43:32.799 --> 00:43:37.399
mighty way here. So God has a way of getting His servants,

00:43:37.439 --> 00:43:40.599
even when they are disobedient and out of His will, He still

00:43:40.639 --> 00:43:42.599
has a way of getting them where He wants them to be and uses

00:43:42.639 --> 00:43:46.879
them in spite of themselves. Why do people say no to the

00:43:46.939 --> 00:43:51.539
call of God in their life? How many are just disobedient in

00:43:51.579 --> 00:43:55.739
the basic stuff? I remember one time when I was pastoring I

00:43:55.779 --> 00:43:59.019
said, we had a family in our church that for whatever reason

00:43:59.039 --> 00:44:01.119
they just decided they weren't going to come to church on

00:44:01.139 --> 00:44:02.879
Sunday. We would have used it as a family day and go ride

00:44:02.919 --> 00:44:07.219
roller coasters. I said, what are you teaching your kids?

00:44:07.259 --> 00:44:11.459
Pass up the church. Pass up the house of God. Not be faithful

00:44:11.499 --> 00:44:14.959
to church. What is going on with your thinking here? And I

00:44:14.979 --> 00:44:17.039
was broken hearted over this because these were people that

00:44:17.079 --> 00:44:20.579
had been faithful at one time. I said, listen, I said, did you

00:44:20.619 --> 00:44:23.419
not know that church attendance is really Christianity 101?

00:44:23.459 --> 00:44:30.059
He had every excuse in the book. So I said to him, I said,

00:44:30.099 --> 00:44:32.959
well quite frankly my brother you really are just out of the

00:44:32.999 --> 00:44:35.739
will of God here. Because if you were in the will of God and

00:44:35.759 --> 00:44:37.799
you were walking in God's will then you'd be in church and

00:44:37.839 --> 00:44:39.699
you'd have your family here every time the doors are open.

00:44:39.739 --> 00:44:44.739
I can't understand why you wouldn't want to do that. And I

00:44:44.759 --> 00:44:47.459
said, every excuse in the book. Remember the other day I

00:44:47.499 --> 00:44:51.939
mentioned, yesterday I mentioned tithing? Amen. That's

00:44:51.959 --> 00:44:58.139
Christianity 101. God says that the tenth part is His. And by

00:44:58.179 --> 00:45:00.099
the way, someone said, well it's under the law. No, it's

00:45:00.139 --> 00:45:02.479
not. It was given before the law was given. Remember in

00:45:02.499 --> 00:45:05.979
Melchizedek? And then Jesus upholds the tithe in the New

00:45:06.019 --> 00:45:08.579
Testament. I said, that's Christianity 101. I said, if

00:45:08.619 --> 00:45:10.579
you're not tithing and you're not doing what God has called

00:45:10.619 --> 00:45:12.159
you to do when it comes to giving your tithes and

00:45:12.179 --> 00:45:14.219
offerings at a local New Testament church you're out of

00:45:14.239 --> 00:45:18.799
the will of God. Some people don't like that. Oh, you bet

00:45:18.839 --> 00:45:24.279
these preachers always preach no money. I said, no sir, no

00:45:24.319 --> 00:45:27.379
ma'am. Oh, and by the way, let me say this as an aside,

00:45:27.419 --> 00:45:29.979
there's more scriptural money in the Bible than anything

00:45:30.019 --> 00:45:35.619
else, 2,150 verses because God knows we can't handle it. So,

00:45:35.659 --> 00:45:39.659
He has to teach us how to handle money, or money will

00:45:39.699 --> 00:45:43.759
handle us. So, Jonah is out of God's will. And Jonah was an

00:45:43.839 --> 00:45:46.099
angry man. And Jonah was a bitter man. He didn't have

00:45:46.139 --> 00:45:48.339
mercy in his heart for these Ninevites. And he didn't want

00:45:48.379 --> 00:45:51.039
to go and preach the Word of God to them. And when God

00:45:51.079 --> 00:45:53.979
finally got them there they repented, got right with God.

00:45:54.019 --> 00:45:58.479
God, that which He was planning to do with Ninevites, they

00:45:58.519 --> 00:46:00.879
hadn't repented. He repented of that. It says that He turned

00:46:00.919 --> 00:46:03.619
away from that and spared the city at least for the time

00:46:03.659 --> 00:46:05.819
being. And you should have thought that He would have

00:46:05.859 --> 00:46:07.919
rejoiced and been happy in the Lord. And again He was angry.

00:46:07.959 --> 00:46:13.239
But the key is that from the very beginning He was out of

00:46:13.239 --> 00:46:15.039
God's will and running from the Lord, running from the

00:46:15.079 --> 00:46:19.779
presence of God. And we can apply that in so many

00:46:19.819 --> 00:46:25.219
different ways. People are running from the presence of

00:46:25.259 --> 00:46:33.939
God all the time, you know. God calls them to preach, they

00:46:33.959 --> 00:46:35.939
won't do it. God calls them to mission field, they won't do

00:46:35.959 --> 00:46:39.039
it. God calls them to do some area of service in the Church,

00:46:39.079 --> 00:46:41.479
they won't do it. God impressed upon their heart that they

00:46:41.539 --> 00:46:43.479
should use their abilities and their talents to sing in a

00:46:43.519 --> 00:46:45.879
choir, they won't do it. God wants them to teach a Sunday

00:46:45.919 --> 00:46:47.959
school class, they won't do it. I mean you can go right on

00:46:47.979 --> 00:46:50.519
down the list, they won't do it. God wants them to go out

00:46:50.559 --> 00:46:52.419
soul winning, they won't do it. God wants them to be

00:46:52.459 --> 00:46:54.219
involved in this ministry, that ministry, they won't do

00:46:54.259 --> 00:46:56.099
it. Youth ministry, you need somebody to work with the

00:46:56.119 --> 00:46:58.059
youth, they won't do it. Why? Because they have their own

00:46:58.099 --> 00:47:00.639
agenda just like He did. And it's because they are out of

00:47:00.659 --> 00:47:04.399
the will of God. If God calls you to do something, you do

00:47:04.439 --> 00:47:09.199
it. Some things you don't even have to be called of God to

00:47:09.359 --> 00:47:13.039
do. The Word of God gives ample instruction about things that

00:47:13.059 --> 00:47:15.739
we ought to be doing. And so you do that in obedience to God

00:47:15.759 --> 00:47:18.179
to His Word. And if you're not doing what God has called you

00:47:18.199 --> 00:47:21.099
to do and shown you to do and instructed you to do in His

00:47:21.139 --> 00:47:25.119
Word, then you're out of God's will. Not a happy way to live

00:47:25.139 --> 00:47:28.919
your life. Not a happy way to live your life. Jonah is just

00:47:28.939 --> 00:47:33.359
an extreme example. Yet in all the years that I've been

00:47:33.379 --> 00:47:36.899
preaching the Word of God I've seen a lot of it, seen a lot

00:47:36.919 --> 00:47:42.859
of it, you know. And it's sad. It's not a good way to live.

00:47:42.899 --> 00:47:47.799
And God wants us to be in the center of His perfect will, not

00:47:47.839 --> 00:47:51.579
running from His presence but running into His presence.

00:47:51.599 --> 00:47:55.979
Isaiah chapter 6 gives a perfect example of that. Isaiah

00:47:56.019 --> 00:47:58.619
got into the presence of God, got into God's presence and

00:47:58.639 --> 00:48:01.779
saw Him high and lifted up. Saw the angels of God worshipping

00:48:01.819 --> 00:48:05.279
Him and praising Him and honoring Him. And he came to

00:48:05.339 --> 00:48:08.439
the conclusion, woe is me for I'm undone. I'm a man of

00:48:08.479 --> 00:48:10.739
unclean lips and I live in the midst of a people of unclean

00:48:10.779 --> 00:48:13.879
lips. And somewhere along the line in the process of that he

00:48:13.919 --> 00:48:16.919
said this, when he got right with God and everything in his

00:48:16.939 --> 00:48:19.579
life was back in order the way it should have been and God

00:48:19.619 --> 00:48:21.979
said, whom shall we send? Who will go for us? That's a triune

00:48:22.019 --> 00:48:25.999
Godhead speaking there. Who shall go for us? He said, here

00:48:26.019 --> 00:48:30.559
my Lord send me. He made Himself available and He

00:48:30.599 --> 00:48:33.759
definitely was not running from the Lord. He was running to

00:48:33.779 --> 00:48:37.919
Him. God, whatever you want me to do I'm willing to do it.

00:48:37.959 --> 00:48:39.760
Don't want to run from You, don't want to be out of Your

00:48:39.779 --> 00:48:41.919
will, don't want to run from Your presence. I don't want to

00:48:41.959 --> 00:48:51.799
be a Jonah. Quick story then I'm going to pray. My pastor,

00:48:51.839 --> 00:48:59.000
one of the dearest men I've ever known in my life, never

00:48:59.059 --> 00:49:04.919
known a more precious man than Pastor Willie Dell. God called

00:49:04.959 --> 00:49:09.359
him to pastor Mira Mesa Bible Baptist Church. God called him

00:49:09.399 --> 00:49:12.099
to preach, called him to pastor. He was teaching Sunday

00:49:12.139 --> 00:49:14.299
school, he was working with the teens, he was doing all kinds

00:49:14.339 --> 00:49:16.639
of things in the church in National City in San Diego

00:49:16.679 --> 00:49:22.339
area. But he would not heed God's call upon his life to do

00:49:22.380 --> 00:49:26.579
what he knew the Lord was impressing upon his heart. He

00:49:26.659 --> 00:49:29.899
wouldn't surrender to it. He skirted the issue, made

00:49:29.940 --> 00:49:35.239
excuses. And finally Mrs. Dell said to him, Brother Willie

00:49:35.279 --> 00:49:45.919
you're a Jonah, you're a Jonah. That's a good wife that would

00:49:45.959 --> 00:49:49.119
do something like that for her husband, amen, you're a Jonah.

00:49:49.159 --> 00:49:53.799
Now in the midst of all this he had started, he came down and

00:49:54.019 --> 00:49:57.219
started working with our church because at that time it was a

00:49:57.260 --> 00:49:59.719
mission work out of Bible Baptist Church in National City,

00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:01.899
it used to be Filipino and American Bible Baptist Church.

00:50:01.919 --> 00:50:05.559
And he came down there and started working with the church

00:50:05.599 --> 00:50:06.940
and pastoring it.

00:50:06.940 --> 00:50:13.540
the mission work. And I was preaching a fellowship meeting. Our dear sister here was in this

00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:18.260
church, Lighthouse Baptist Church Laverne. She was there recently, a Los Angeles area.

00:50:18.260 --> 00:50:23.400
Great church. And I was preaching a fellowship meeting there, and I was the closing preacher.

00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:28.460
And I had no idea. I didn't even know who Willie Dell was. And we had a big crowd that

00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:32.260
day. We had a lot of Bible college students. We had some high school kids there. We had

00:50:32.260 --> 00:50:37.340
preachers there, missionaries, evangelists there. And I preached the message that God

00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:41.420
had impressed upon my heart in the last couple of minutes before I preached. The message

00:50:41.420 --> 00:50:49.100
was entitled, Don't Quit. Don't Quit. And I did not know that Pastor Willie was there

00:50:49.100 --> 00:50:55.460
that day with Pastor Larry Obero. And when I gave the invitation at the end of that message,

00:50:55.460 --> 00:51:01.100
men began to come to the altar. He came to the altar weeping. And his testimony is, that

00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:08.620
day I already had written my letter of resignation, and I was going to leave that ministry until

00:51:08.620 --> 00:51:15.779
Brother Meshon preached, Don't Quit. I had no idea who he was, and I had no idea that

00:51:15.779 --> 00:51:25.340
just a few years later he would be my pastor. I'm glad I preached that message, Don't Quit.

00:51:25.340 --> 00:51:35.220
Well, Jonah quit before he even got started, because he was disobedient. Out of the will

00:51:35.220 --> 00:51:42.100
of God and out of God's presence. You get in the presence of God, when God impresses

00:51:42.100 --> 00:51:46.900
will upon your heart, you'll say, Yes, Lord, yes. Here am I. Send me whatever you'd have

00:51:46.900 --> 00:51:50.740
me do, Lord. I want to do it. I want to be obedient to you. I don't want to be disobedient

00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:57.459
in any way, shape, or form. Let us not be a Jonah. Amen. Let's all stand. Would you

00:51:57.459 --> 00:52:02.220
stand with me, please? With our heads bowed and eyes closed. Father, we thank you, Lord,

00:52:02.220 --> 00:52:06.540
tonight for the privilege we've had to be here in your house. Lord, just a very simple

00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:10.860
message, nothing profound here. But God, we pray that as our sister comes to play the

00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:14.700
instrument, that you'd speak to the hearts of your people, accomplish whatever it is

00:52:14.700 --> 00:52:18.940
you'd want accomplished. Lord, help us to be mindful tonight that it's a terrible thing

00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:23.020
to be out of your will. Lord, we ought to, every one of us tonight, have that desire

00:52:23.020 --> 00:52:27.660
to be in your presence. And when you impress things upon our hearts, there should be no

00:52:27.660 --> 00:52:32.180
resistance there. We should just have a desire to surrender ourselves to your will, whatever

00:52:32.180 --> 00:52:36.500
it may be. God, help us not to be a Jonah and run for your purpose in our lives, we

00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:41.660
pray. So as we have the invitation, God, move as you will. We'll thank you for it in Jesus'

00:52:41.660 --> 00:52:44.979
name. Would you now, with your heads bowed and eyes closed as the instrument plays, would

00:52:44.979 --> 00:52:48.900
you now step out and come? The altar's open tonight. If God spoke in your heart about

00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:54.300
anything in the message, the altar's open. Would you come? How about you, if you're out

00:52:54.300 --> 00:53:00.740
of the will of God tonight, get back into his will again. Surrender yourself to him.

00:53:00.740 --> 00:53:07.020
Let him have his way with you. Lord, I want to be in the center of your perfect will.

00:53:07.020 --> 00:53:10.180
I don't want to be a Jonah. I don't want to run from whatever it is you have for me in

00:53:10.180 --> 00:53:16.540
my life. Perhaps you're here tonight, you're not saved. You need to put your faith and

00:53:16.540 --> 00:53:21.020
trust in Christ. Would you come tonight and let us take the Bible and show you from the

00:53:21.020 --> 00:53:27.419
Word of God how you can be saved, biblically, through repentance and faith. But Christian,

00:53:27.419 --> 00:53:31.260
the message tonight's for us. I never want to be out of God's will. I want to be in the

00:53:31.260 --> 00:53:37.500
center of his perfect will. That's the place of joy. That's the place of happiness. That's

00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:46.940
the place of blessing. That's the place of abundance. And when God just used me, you

00:53:46.940 --> 00:53:50.660
should want the same thing. We ought to be used to the Lord. We especially live in these

00:53:50.660 --> 00:53:56.979
last days. We haven't much time yet to serve him. The night cometh when no man can work.

00:53:56.979 --> 00:54:01.220
We need to be obedient to God's call upon our lives. Let the Holy Spirit of God lead,

00:54:01.220 --> 00:54:05.300
God direct us. Lord, I'm available to you for whatever you want in my life, whatever

00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:09.619
you would have me do. I don't want to run from you or from your presence.
