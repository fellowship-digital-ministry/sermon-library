WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.880
Looking at the names of God, the title of the message, Thy Name is Great, and that was

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:06.880
part one.

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.560
And now this evening, Thy Name is Great, part two.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:15.199
And Brother Jim, sorry I did not give you a note card with that, but it is Thy Name

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:16.600
is Great, part two.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.319
We'll be looking here at Proverbs 18 and verse number 10 as a springboard again this evening.

00:00:21.319 --> 00:00:26.639
You'll remember that as we started this study of theology that we began in Jeremiah chapter

00:00:26.639 --> 00:00:32.919
number 10, and we've used verse number 6 in Jeremiah 10 as really an outline type of

00:00:32.919 --> 00:00:38.319
a verse for this passage of scripture where the Bible says, For as much as there is none

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:45.599
like unto thee, O Lord, thou art great, and thy name is great in might.

00:00:45.599 --> 00:00:49.759
And so we've had the opportunity as we've studied theology to look at a number of God's

00:00:49.759 --> 00:00:57.040
attributes and to rejoice in His moral attributes and His natural attributes, and what a joy

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:03.319
to have the privilege of knowing the God of the universe and that He has given us His

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:06.080
word to reveal Himself to us.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:12.440
As we began looking at the names of God, we've made the note of understanding that God would

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:18.879
use a number of names in the Old Testament to call Himself, and as He would use those

00:01:18.879 --> 00:01:25.319
names, He would be communicating with His people various aspects of His character.

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:32.120
And He would, of course, through the use of these names, He would highlight certain aspects

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:38.360
of His character, of His attributes, and what a blessing it was for the people of God in

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.440
the Old Testament as they would receive the truth as God would reveal Himself to them

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.760
by these names and how it encouraged them and impacted them.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:52.839
And I said this last week, that as we today study the names of God, and we're looking

00:01:52.839 --> 00:01:56.559
at ten of them, we did five last week and we'll do five this evening, but as we look

00:01:56.559 --> 00:02:02.839
at these names of God that we have the opportunity just in like manner as those Old Testament

00:02:02.839 --> 00:02:10.759
saints to be encouraged as we are reminded of who our God is and how He has revealed

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.559
Himself in Proverbs 18 and verse number 10, the Bible says, the name of the Lord is a

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:21.440
strong tower, the righteous runneth into it and is safe.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.300
The psalmist said in Psalm 148 and verse number 13, let them praise the name of the Lord,

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:33.559
for His name alone is excellent, His glory is above the earth and heaven.

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:38.160
In our first study dealing with Thy name is great, we looked at the name of God, Elohim.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.119
It's the first name of God that's used in all of the Bible.

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:46.839
In Genesis chapter number 1, we find in the beginning God and we find that Elohim, meaning

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:51.160
the strong one, and dealing with the fact that He is the Creator and how that is so

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:57.119
foundational to understand the whole of Scripture, that He is the Creator.

00:02:57.119 --> 00:03:02.880
We dealt with the proper name of God, Yahweh or Jehovah, and understanding that He is the

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.800
self-existent One.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.639
In Him is life.

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:10.800
People ask that question when you speak about God being the Creator, well, who created God?

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.919
No one, He is.

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:17.119
And He is the self-existent One, Jehovah Yahweh.

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:23.240
Adonai, dealing with the fact that He is Lord or Master, He is our strength, and we said

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:31.000
this last week, that as our Lord or as our Master, that He rightly deserves our worship

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.919
and our obedience.

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:40.000
El Shaddai, the Lord God Almighty, and how we rejoice in God revealing Himself to Abram

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.639
as being El Shaddai, the Lord God Almighty.

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:49.880
And I said this, after God had revealed Himself in that manner, He then says to Abraham in

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.399
the next chapter, is anything too hard for the Lord?

00:03:54.399 --> 00:03:59.139
And what a blessing as we understand that He is the Lord God Almighty, obviously the

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:04.039
answer to that question is no, there's nothing too hard for you, you've just revealed yourself

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:08.839
to me as being the Lord God Almighty, the Almighty One.

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:15.360
And then we looked and finished up with Jehovah Ra, and that means the Lord is my shepherd,

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.519
we see that in Psalm 23.

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:24.480
And of course we noted last week that David, as the sweet psalmist of Israel, is the one

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.700
that God used to pen Psalm 23, that of course he was a shepherd, but really if you think

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:35.839
about it, a lot of the Old Testament saints, they were, or whether they were shepherds

00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:42.559
or very closely associated with shepherding, they would have had a great understanding

00:04:42.559 --> 00:04:49.480
of that truth when God says, I am your shepherd, and all that that means, and all that carries

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.480
with it.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.359
This evening, as we continue our study, I want you to turn to the book of Exodus, Exodus

00:04:53.359 --> 00:04:58.679
chapter number 15, and the sixth name that we'll look at this evening, name of God, is

00:04:58.679 --> 00:05:02.480
Jehovah Rapha, Jehovah Rapha.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:07.059
And this is given to us here in Exodus chapter number 15.

00:05:07.059 --> 00:05:11.880
We sang the song this evening, how appropriate, the first song that we sang this evening,

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.859
When I See the Blood, and of course a reminder of the Passover, and so contextually to find

00:05:16.859 --> 00:05:21.200
out exactly all that's going on here in the book of Exodus, we find that the plagues have

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:26.679
been, all ten of them have been given, and we find that of course the tenth being that

00:05:26.679 --> 00:05:31.160
of the Passover and the importance of applying the blood, and then of course the children

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.239
of Israel leave Egypt, and then the 14th chapter records for us the drying up of the

00:05:36.239 --> 00:05:37.239
Red Sea.

00:05:37.239 --> 00:05:44.359
They get into chapter 15, and you hear about all of the song of praise for what God did,

00:05:44.359 --> 00:05:49.399
and not long after their singing praise, they're complaining about the fact that they found

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:54.880
no water, and that's contained for us at the end of the 15th chapter of the book of Exodus.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.880
And notice with me, as they would complain about finding no water, remember they're at

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:04.119
Marah, and they're exactly where God had led them to in verse number 23, it says,

00:06:04.119 --> 00:06:08.640
When they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter.

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:12.440
And so they come to this place, they had no water, then they come to a place where there's

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.640
water, but they cannot drink the water.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.480
The people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:21.239
And the Lord showed them a tree, in verse number 25, and told them that he would make

00:06:21.239 --> 00:06:24.880
the water sweet, and of course that's what he did.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:30.600
It says at the end of verse number 25 that there he proved them, and of course they had

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:38.720
already seen God do amazing things, eyewitnesses of his power, and now we see this once again

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:43.239
where God is giving them, revealing to them his power.

00:06:43.239 --> 00:06:48.760
We find in verse number 26, notice what God says, And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:53.440
to the voice of the Lord thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:59.200
give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.880
upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:07.600
Notice what he says, For I am the Lord that healeth thee.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:12.679
And of course you see again, as I've mentioned last week, that Lord there at the end of verse

00:07:12.679 --> 00:07:17.959
number 26, and your Bible should be in all caps, it's Jehovah or Yahweh, and so that's

00:07:17.959 --> 00:07:23.640
where we see Jehovah Rapha, the Lord that heals, and he says, I am the Lord that healeth

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:24.640
thee.

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:28.380
Now think about the context they're going into, of course we know that they don't enter

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:32.200
immediately into the land of promise because of their doubt and their unbelief, and they

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:37.279
wander in the wilderness, but God is saying to them, I will put none of these diseases

00:07:37.279 --> 00:07:43.160
upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians, for I am the Lord that healeth thee.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:48.000
And I want you to think about the impact that that truth, of God revealing himself

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.640
to his people in this manner by using the name Jehovah Rapha, how that would encourage

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:59.679
them when they were aware of diseases, when they were aware of those things, that we serve

00:07:59.679 --> 00:08:02.320
the Lord God who is able to heal.

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:08.880
And we understand that the scriptures would record for us of those that had inquired and

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:14.839
asked for God to provide healing, and we find many examples of God doing just that.

00:08:14.839 --> 00:08:15.839
Why?

00:08:15.839 --> 00:08:19.880
Because he's the Lord that heals, and he has power over sickness and disease.

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:24.239
We see that in the person of Jesus Christ, as you study the gospel records, how that

00:08:24.239 --> 00:08:29.079
he would, through the miracles, perform many miracles in which he demonstrated this power

00:08:29.079 --> 00:08:30.519
over sickness and disease.

00:08:30.519 --> 00:08:34.880
And we as New Testament believers, we have the truth of James 5 when he says, if any

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:39.119
are sick, let them pray, knowing that our God is able.

00:08:39.119 --> 00:08:41.599
He is the Lord that heals.

00:08:41.599 --> 00:08:44.359
Number seven, Jehovah Jireh.

00:08:44.359 --> 00:08:49.440
You have to turn back to the book of Genesis in chapter number 22, Jehovah Jireh, it means

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:53.119
the Lord will provide.

00:08:53.119 --> 00:08:56.760
And aren't you thankful for the provision of God?

00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:03.200
And as we begin to look at our lives and look at how good God has been to us, we would understand

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:08.080
that he has provided for us more than we really deserve.

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:13.700
And of course, we understand here, contextually, in Genesis chapter number 22, it's the offering

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:15.239
of Isaac.

00:09:15.239 --> 00:09:19.919
And when you think about the offering of Isaac, of course, Abraham and Sarah had been promised

00:09:19.919 --> 00:09:25.159
a son, and now Abraham has been instructed to get up into a mountain to there offer his

00:09:25.159 --> 00:09:26.320
son.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.080
And Abraham was obedient.

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:29.239
Abraham had faith.

00:09:29.239 --> 00:09:34.500
Abraham said to his son, when Isaac said, where is the lamb for a burnt offering?

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:40.919
We find that Abraham replied and said, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering.

00:09:40.919 --> 00:09:45.359
And he goes through the process and he lays his son upon the altar and he lifts his hand

00:09:45.359 --> 00:09:47.280
ready to slay his son.

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:51.179
And the Bible says in verse number 11, that the angel of the Lord called unto him out

00:09:51.179 --> 00:09:53.559
of heaven and said, Abraham, Abraham.

00:09:53.559 --> 00:09:55.479
And he said, hear my.

00:09:55.479 --> 00:09:59.640
And he said, lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou anything unto him.

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:00.359
For now I know.

00:10:00.359 --> 00:10:05.239
that thou fears God seeing thou has not withheld thy son thine only son for me

00:10:05.239 --> 00:10:08.759
and Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and notice what it says and

00:10:08.759 --> 00:10:13.599
behold behind him a ram caught a thicket by his horns and Abraham went and took

00:10:13.599 --> 00:10:17.759
the ram and offered him for a burnt offering in the stead of his son and

00:10:17.759 --> 00:10:22.839
Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah Jireh as it is said to this day

00:10:22.839 --> 00:10:28.639
in the Mount of the Lord it shall be seen the Lord will provide Abraham

00:10:28.639 --> 00:10:32.799
experienced this and we sometimes we look at the scriptures and we study the

00:10:32.799 --> 00:10:37.119
Word of God and we're aware of some of the accounts and we know what happens we

00:10:37.119 --> 00:10:41.839
sometimes can fail to remember the fact that they were living this moment by

00:10:41.839 --> 00:10:46.839
moment step by step and Abraham had faith and the book of Hebrews tells us

00:10:46.839 --> 00:10:50.919
in the 11th chapter that he believed that even if his son were to die there

00:10:50.919 --> 00:10:55.959
upon the altar that God could raise him up and what faith Abraham had but we

00:10:55.959 --> 00:11:00.159
find that the Lord provided of course we would understand as we look at

00:11:00.159 --> 00:11:06.639
Genesis 22 and think about the the type of Messiah who would come of course the

00:11:06.639 --> 00:11:12.279
Lamb of God that would go of course and go to the cross of Calvary shed his

00:11:12.279 --> 00:11:18.119
precious blood so that we could have redemption and have of course be

00:11:18.119 --> 00:11:23.679
reconciled to God and what a blessing that is God the the greatest need of

00:11:23.679 --> 00:11:30.279
mankind is a Savior the greatest need our greatest need is not an educator our

00:11:30.279 --> 00:11:34.599
greatest need is not a philosopher our greatest need is not a you to fill in

00:11:34.599 --> 00:11:39.279
the blank and we don't need someone to come and do these things know where the

00:11:39.279 --> 00:11:46.519
greatest need for mankind is a Savior and God provided his own son of course

00:11:46.519 --> 00:11:51.519
God and flesh the Lord Jesus Christ came and went to the cross of Calvary to pay

00:11:51.519 --> 00:11:55.999
for the sin of mankind and what a blessing that is for us to understand

00:11:55.999 --> 00:12:01.159
this evening and of course as we think about this passage again understanding

00:12:01.159 --> 00:12:05.319
the impact that these names would have upon the patriarchs and the people of

00:12:05.319 --> 00:12:10.559
God as they would read the accounts and they would read the names and they would

00:12:10.559 --> 00:12:17.719
be aware of the fact that our God provides and how that was to give them a

00:12:17.719 --> 00:12:23.759
greater level of faith number eight if you're taking notes Jehovah Shalom and

00:12:23.759 --> 00:12:27.519
of course many of you would know already just from that name that that is the

00:12:27.519 --> 00:12:33.519
Lord is peace the Lord is peace and look over the book of judges if you will in

00:12:33.519 --> 00:12:38.879
chapter number six and judges chapter number six and verse number 24 is where

00:12:38.879 --> 00:12:44.999
we see the use of Jehovah Shalom and of course this is the text of scripture in

00:12:44.999 --> 00:12:50.439
judges 6 over through judges 8 dealing with the life and and really the

00:12:50.439 --> 00:12:55.519
ministry of Gideon and Gideon we know several things about Gideon and he was

00:12:55.519 --> 00:13:00.239
in a position where he needed to have his faith increased he had a task that

00:13:00.239 --> 00:13:05.759
was assigned to him and as we look at the passage of scripture the the angel

00:13:05.759 --> 00:13:08.519
had appeared to him and then the angel departed out of his sight in verse

00:13:08.519 --> 00:13:12.159
number 22 if you pick it up there with me the Bible says when Gideon perceived

00:13:12.159 --> 00:13:16.039
that he was an angel of the Lord Gideon said alas O Lord God for because I have

00:13:16.039 --> 00:13:20.479
seen an angel of the face of the Lord excuse me face to face and the Lord said

00:13:20.479 --> 00:13:26.439
unto him peace be unto thee fear not thou shalt not die and so we understand

00:13:26.439 --> 00:13:31.679
that there's a level of fear and of course the need for peace and God says

00:13:31.679 --> 00:13:36.519
the Lord you notice again in verse number 23 of judges 6 that it's all

00:13:36.519 --> 00:13:43.239
caps Jehovah Yahweh the Bible says the Lord said unto him peace be unto thee

00:13:43.239 --> 00:13:48.839
and he tells him to fear not thou shalt not die then notice in verse number 24

00:13:48.839 --> 00:13:52.999
then Gideon built an altar there unto the Lord and called it Jehovah Shalom

00:13:52.999 --> 00:13:59.719
unto this day is yet it or for it and is of the Abba's rights and so we find here

00:13:59.719 --> 00:14:07.239
that as God would say to to Gideon peace be unto thee then Gideon would

00:14:07.239 --> 00:14:11.799
build an altar which is an appropriate response of worship and he would there

00:14:11.799 --> 00:14:19.559
call the name of the Lord Jehovah Shalom the God the Lord of peace and I'm so

00:14:19.559 --> 00:14:24.479
thankful that he is the Lord of peace and we understand the Bible says great

00:14:24.479 --> 00:14:29.319
peace have they which love thy law and nothing shall offend them in Psalm 119

00:14:29.319 --> 00:14:35.399
we find that the Bible speaks in this manner think about this and Isaiah when

00:14:35.399 --> 00:14:40.399
we think about the the truth of the peace of God and Isaiah 26 and verse

00:14:40.399 --> 00:14:46.359
number 23 thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee

00:14:46.359 --> 00:14:51.799
because he trusted in thee trust you in the Lord forever for in the Lord Jehovah

00:14:51.799 --> 00:14:57.879
is everlasting strength not only that strength but that peace and Jehovah

00:14:57.879 --> 00:15:01.559
Shalom think about all of the Old Testament really if you think about all

00:15:01.559 --> 00:15:05.119
of the trials and troubles and difficulties and all of the various

00:15:05.119 --> 00:15:11.359
things that the people of God dealt with to know God is the God of peace the Lord

00:15:11.359 --> 00:15:18.279
is peace see this evening there are times in which we may have the idea that

00:15:18.279 --> 00:15:23.919
peace equals the absence of trouble and a lot of times we're kind of programmed

00:15:23.919 --> 00:15:28.199
to think that way that peace means there's no trouble but the reality is

00:15:28.199 --> 00:15:34.519
that we can have the peace of God in the midst of great turmoil and trouble

00:15:34.519 --> 00:15:39.399
because peace is not found in the absence of trouble peace is found in the

00:15:39.399 --> 00:15:44.719
presence of God and you can find yourself in the midst of all sorts of

00:15:44.719 --> 00:15:49.439
difficulties I mean do you believe this evening that Daniel had peace when he

00:15:49.439 --> 00:15:54.199
was in the den of lions sure he did it was the king that had a sleepless night

00:15:54.199 --> 00:16:00.039
it was not Daniel for the Lord sent his angel to shut the mouths of the lions

00:16:00.039 --> 00:16:04.239
and he had peace I think about of course it's the New Testament but I think about

00:16:04.239 --> 00:16:09.119
Peter when he's there in prison and he slept like a baby I mean he slept right

00:16:09.119 --> 00:16:14.159
between a couple of soldiers and why because he had peace and the Bible tells

00:16:14.159 --> 00:16:18.479
us again as New Testament believers that he gives us a peace and he

00:16:18.479 --> 00:16:24.039
describes it as a peace that passeth all understanding let the peace of God rule

00:16:24.039 --> 00:16:28.439
in your hearts the Bible tells us in the book of Colossians and so we find this

00:16:28.439 --> 00:16:35.159
evening how that the people of God in dealing with many various opposition

00:16:35.159 --> 00:16:40.599
adversity all sorts of things going on for them to have the knowledge that God

00:16:40.599 --> 00:16:46.719
one of his names has been given as Jehovah Shalom that he is the that the

00:16:46.719 --> 00:16:54.439
Lord is peace remember that again as we kind of look at some of the the truth

00:16:54.439 --> 00:16:59.279
with regard to the Old Testament into the New Testament and the prophecy of

00:16:59.279 --> 00:17:04.879
Isaiah with regard to Messiah and the the Lord Jesus Christ and that the Bible

00:17:04.879 --> 00:17:11.359
tells us about the names of our God the Bible says about the Lord Jesus Christ

00:17:11.359 --> 00:17:15.359
that his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting

00:17:15.359 --> 00:17:22.839
Father the Prince of Peace and what a joy to know the peace of God Jehovah

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:28.879
Shalom number nine if you're taking notes l alone l Olam excuse me I think I

00:17:28.879 --> 00:17:34.719
pronounce it wrong the first time l Olam and that is the Everlasting God now we

00:17:34.719 --> 00:17:38.679
think about l Olam and of course we've already mentioned about some of the

00:17:38.679 --> 00:17:43.319
attributes the natural attributes of God not only that he's omnipotent and

00:17:43.319 --> 00:17:48.159
omniscient and omnipresent but the fact that he's immutable and eternal that he

00:17:48.159 --> 00:17:54.000
has no beginning and no end he is Alpha and Omega that he is he was and he is to

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.559
come and we understand this evening when we look at this name of God the

00:17:58.559 --> 00:18:04.119
Everlasting God that we understand that he rules for all of eternity he is the

00:18:04.119 --> 00:18:10.959
God of eternity in Genesis chapter 21 in verse number 33 it is good for us to

00:18:10.959 --> 00:18:18.719
know that our God is eternal that that he has no beginning and no end and this

00:18:18.719 --> 00:18:23.159
text of Scripture here in Genesis chapter 21 the Bible tells us in verse

00:18:23.159 --> 00:18:28.519
number 33 that it says in Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba and called

00:18:28.519 --> 00:18:34.119
there on the name of the Lord notice what it says the Everlasting God and

00:18:34.119 --> 00:18:39.959
what a joy to know this truth of our God notice what it said in Isaiah chapter

00:18:39.959 --> 00:18:45.000
number 40 and verse number 28 I'll give you a moment to turn there Isaiah

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.919
chapter number 40 and verse number 28 and as you're turning there I will make

00:18:49.919 --> 00:18:55.719
mention of truth from the the book of Psalms when the Bible says this in Psalm

00:18:55.719 --> 00:18:59.640
90 and verse number 2 before the mountains were brought forth or ever

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:03.880
thou has formed the earth and the world even from everlasting to everlasting

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:10.640
thou art God here in Isaiah chapter number 40 and really you could read the

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:14.839
entire passage of Scripture and be greatly encouraged this evening but I

00:19:14.839 --> 00:19:19.079
want to pick it up in verse number 28 the Bible says this hast thou not known

00:19:19.079 --> 00:19:25.760
hast thou not heard that the everlasting God the Lord the creator of

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:30.599
the ends of the earth fainteth not neither is weary there is no searching

00:19:30.599 --> 00:19:34.760
of his understanding he giveth power to the faint to them that have no might he

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:39.640
increaseth strength I mean you imagine in two verses of Scripture how encouraged

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:45.039
you could be and understanding who our God is that he is everlasting that he is

00:19:45.039 --> 00:19:51.000
the Lord Jehovah the self-existent one that he is the creator that he doesn't

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.839
faint he doesn't grow weary aren't you thankful for that this evening and he is

00:19:55.839 --> 00:20:02.320
the everlasting God and we understand this evening that

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:08.900
such, he could make these promises to his people, and his people could have faith

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:14.380
in what he was promising. Why? Because he's eternal, he's everlasting. And we

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:20.300
understand on this side of Calvary, and looking back at the prophecies of the

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:23.860
Old Testament, and seeing the fulfillment of those prophecies, and rejoicing in

00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:29.100
the fact that our God is eternal, we've often said that the Word of God is

00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:33.780
relevant today. Why? Because it's written by the God of eternity. It's written by

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:39.380
the God who transcends time. It's never going to be outdated, and it doesn't

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:45.300
need to be updated. Amen? It's written by the God of the universe, who is eternal.

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:52.080
He is the everlasting God. Number 10, El Elyon. El Elyon. We'll go back to

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:57.020
Genesis chapter number 14 for this one, and this is one that I preached on a

00:20:57.060 --> 00:21:00.820
Sunday evening not long ago as we were studying through the book of Genesis, and

00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:07.940
you'll remember that Abram has a meeting after the defeat of the coalition of

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:13.020
forces, and he rescues Lot from being captured, and all that takes place. We

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:19.400
find that there were two meetings that Abram has in Genesis 14, and we made the

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:24.020
statement as we studied the latter part of this chapter, that it was the king of

00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:29.900
Sodom that first came out to meet with Abram, but God so orchestrated it so

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:34.820
that the God of the universe so orchestrated it so

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:40.260
the king of Salem, the king of righteousness, Melchizedek, would come and

00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:47.220
meet first with Abram, and he meets with Abram before the king of Sodom has an

00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:52.060
opportunity to meet with Abram, and it's so important that we see in the text of

00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:57.820
Scripture how that God allowed for the meeting between Abram and the king of

00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:03.300
Salem, Melchizedek, to take place prior to the meeting with the king of Sodom. Why?

00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:08.560
Because God was preparing Abram for that meeting that he would have with the king

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:12.900
of Sodom, and of course the king of Sodom was offering some things and what have

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:18.860
you, and God was going to teach him important lesson through this meeting

00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:24.300
with Melchizedek. In verse number 18 of Genesis 14, the Bible says that Melchizedek,

00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:29.940
king of Salem, brought forth bread and wine, notice what it says, and he was the

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:36.740
priest of the Most High God. That's El Elyon, and this is the first mention of

00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:42.580
God in this manner as being the Most High God. The Bible says in verse 19 that

00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:47.340
he blessed him and said, Blessed be Abram, notice again, of the Most High God,

00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:53.340
possessor of heaven and earth. Now think about Abram receiving this information,

00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:58.700
he's understanding this El Elyon, the Most High God, and Melchizedek

00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:03.620
comes, he's the priest of the Most High God, he gives this

00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:09.260
blessing, he says, Blessed be Abram, of the Most High God, possessor of heaven and

00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:16.620
earth. And you begin to see how that God wants us to understand who he is, and as

00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:21.060
we understand who he is, it prepares us for those things that we'll face on

00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:26.220
the earth as we live our lives. The Bible says that he blessed, in verse number 20,

00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:32.420
it says, and blessed be the Most High God, which hath delivered thine enemies

00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:38.380
into thy hand, and he gave him tithes of all. And then notice in verse 21, now it's

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:41.100
the meeting with the king of Sodom, it says, and the king of Sodom said unto

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:47.500
Abram, give me the persons and take the goods to thyself. Abram said to the king

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:56.060
of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the LORD. LORD is caps in your Bible,

00:23:56.060 --> 00:24:04.060
correct? It's Jehovah, Yahweh. And then notice what it says, the Most High God,

00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:10.820
El Elyon. Notice, the possessor of heaven and earth. I understand I said this just

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:14.580
a few weeks ago when we studied Genesis chapter number 14, but when you notice the

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:20.020
response of Abram to the king of Sodom, in verse number 22, where did he get that

00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:24.580
from? He got it from his meeting with Melchizedek, the king of Salem. He knew

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:30.860
God was, of course he knew many things about God, but as he meets with

00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:35.860
Melchizedek, and Melchizedek reveals that he is the Most High God, he's the

00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:40.580
possessor of heaven and earth, and now when Sodom comes and wants to give him

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:46.660
some things, wants to enrich him in a certain sense, that Abram is saying, no,

00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:53.380
no, I've lift up mine hand unto Jehovah God, El Elyon, the Most High God, the one

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:57.100
who is the possessor of heaven and earth. I don't need anything from you, king of

00:24:57.100 --> 00:25:03.220
Sodom, because my God is able. And verse 23, it literally says, that I will

00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:07.500
not take from a thread even to a shoelatch, and that I will not take

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:15.480
anything that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich. What

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:21.820
a blessing to see how that immediately in the life of Abram, in this particular

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:28.220
text of Scripture, the revelation of God through this name, El Elyon, the Most

00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:33.380
High God, the possessor of heaven and earth, that it had an immediate impact in

00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:38.059
the life of Abram. And see, that's the the reality this evening for us, the

00:25:38.059 --> 00:25:42.619
application. We can study the names of God, and it's important for us to know

00:25:42.619 --> 00:25:46.660
the names of God as we would be students of the Word of God, but it's important

00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:51.220
that we don't just look at it from a scholarly perspective, that we look at it

00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:55.580
from a level of intellect and what-have-you of knowing these names and

00:25:55.580 --> 00:26:00.220
knowing the Hebrew names of God, but that we would truly allow it to impact our

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:06.020
living, that we would allow it to have an influence upon our day-by-day

00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:12.260
activities as we face various trials and difficulties and oppositions and

00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:18.460
temptations that we face in life, that we are mindful of who we serve and who He

00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:25.140
is. And what a joy to know that as we study the Word of God, that God, see, God

00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:33.020
can't be described with just one name. I mean, He transcends us. I've often said to

00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:36.700
people over the years, and I've said to myself, even as I look at the Word of God

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:41.779
and try to study God and have a desire to know Him, and it should lead us to a

00:26:41.779 --> 00:26:47.100
place that we stand in awe of who He is, but the reality this evening is that as

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:52.220
high and as mighty and as powerful as I think God is, as I can comprehend God to

00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:58.700
be, He's far superior to the what I can even begin to comprehend. His greatness

00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:03.220
is unsearchable. That's what the Word of God says. Now David declares, I know the

00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:07.980
Lord is great. And then he also says, but the Lord's greatness is unsearchable.

00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:13.059
There's no contradiction there. It's just that our finite minds cannot fully

00:27:13.059 --> 00:27:19.460
comprehend the infinite God. And so what He has done is He has revealed Himself

00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:26.300
to us, and one of the means by which He is used is the names. And as He has given

00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:31.700
Himself these names, He's revealing to His people various aspects of His

00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:36.500
character and His ability, His attributes. Why? So that we'd be encouraged, so that

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:43.220
it would help us in this journey of life as we are mindful of who our God is.

00:27:44.179 --> 00:27:50.500
There's none like Him. As we go back and kind of finish up this study with the

00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:55.460
truth of Jeremiah 10, I want to remind you again, and we started here, we've used the

00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:59.339
verse often throughout the study, but I want to remind you of this verse as we

00:27:59.339 --> 00:28:04.460
close in Jeremiah 10 and verse number 6, when Jeremiah declares,

00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:15.700
For as much as there is none like unto Thee, O Lord. There's no one like Him. No one

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:21.619
like Him. All the false religions of the world, all that they try to serve, there's

00:28:21.619 --> 00:28:29.940
no one like the Lord God Almighty, Jehovah God. It says, Thou art great, and

00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:35.619
He is. Oh, He's a good God, and we often speak about the Lord is good, and we

00:28:35.619 --> 00:28:40.419
should, for the Bible says that He is good. But He's great. His greatness, as I

00:28:40.419 --> 00:28:44.340
mentioned a moment ago, is unsearchable. The Bible says in Psalm 48, Great is the

00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:47.780
Lord, and greatly to be praised. And then we have here at the end of verse number

00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:54.380
6, And thy name is great in might. Let me remind you, as I said in one of our

00:28:54.380 --> 00:29:01.780
previous lessons, we think about how great our God is. We study theology. We

00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:08.179
want to have as our textbook, if you will, for theology, the Word of God, the Bible,

00:29:08.179 --> 00:29:15.940
the revelation of God to man. We find that as we begin to study theology and

00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:20.500
understand who God is, as He's revealed Himself, that yes, we stand in awe of Him,

00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:24.780
and yes, we say that He is great, but we must be mindful of the fact that the

00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:33.580
Bible says, For this God is our God forever and ever. He will be our guide

00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:40.580
even unto death. Psalm 48 and verse number 14. I would submit to you this

00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:47.340
evening that when you know Him as He's revealed Himself to you in His Word, you

00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:54.020
will agree with the psalmist and you will say that yes, He is great. And you

00:29:54.020 --> 00:30:00.660
will acknowledge that you want Him to be your guide even unto death. Why? I don't

00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:03.859
want anyone else being my guide.

00:30:03.859 --> 00:30:04.859
Right?

00:30:04.859 --> 00:30:09.179
When I understand who He is, why would I settle for someone else to be my guide?

00:30:09.179 --> 00:30:11.699
Does that make sense?

00:30:11.699 --> 00:30:17.139
And the psalmist says, He will be our guide even unto death.

00:30:17.139 --> 00:30:25.279
We serve a great God, and we are so blessed and so privileged to know the God of heaven.

00:30:25.279 --> 00:30:29.899
We ought to stand in awe of Him, and we ought to declare His greatness.

00:30:29.899 --> 00:30:30.899
Let's pray.

00:30:30.899 --> 00:30:31.899
Father, we love You.

00:30:31.899 --> 00:30:33.459
We thank You for loving us.

00:30:33.459 --> 00:30:40.379
We thank You that You have revealed to us in Your Word these names.

00:30:40.379 --> 00:30:47.499
For just a few moments to be able to study, to reference the names of God, I've been encouraged.

00:30:47.499 --> 00:30:52.859
And I hope, Lord, that each one that is present, each one that's tuned in via livestream tonight

00:30:52.859 --> 00:30:55.139
has been encouraged.

00:30:55.139 --> 00:31:00.499
And I pray that with that encouragement comes some application in our lives, that we would

00:31:00.499 --> 00:31:06.179
be impacted in our daily lives as to how we face the difficulties and the adversities

00:31:06.179 --> 00:31:10.659
of life, that we would understand who You are and that You're our God.

00:31:10.659 --> 00:31:16.539
I pray that You'd help us to be challenged, to stand in awe of who You are, and to declare

00:31:16.539 --> 00:31:18.779
Thy greatness.

00:31:18.779 --> 00:31:22.099
There's a world that does not know who You are.

00:31:22.099 --> 00:31:25.979
It is our responsibility to declare Thy greatness.

00:31:25.979 --> 00:31:28.719
Lord, I pray that You'd bless our time of prayer.

00:31:28.719 --> 00:31:31.079
We do thank You for the privilege of prayer.

00:31:31.079 --> 00:31:33.679
We pray that You'd be honored and glorified through the remainder of our service.

00:31:33.679 --> 00:31:39.759
For it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
