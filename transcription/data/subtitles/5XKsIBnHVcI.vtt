WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.159
number 37 and look at this passage of Scripture. We are going to observe the

00:00:04.159 --> 00:00:08.760
Lord's Supper this evening and so my plan is to preach a little bit shorter

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.000
from this portion of Scripture and close out this aspect of the service and then

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.600
we'll transition into 1 Corinthians 11 and observe the Lord's Supper this

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.520
evening. Last week as we looked at this portion of Genesis chapter 37 we

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.040
addressed the obedience of Joseph to the mission that was given to him by Jacob.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:33.400
We understand that Jacob calls Joseph and says that he wanted him to go and

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.680
Joseph was completely surrendered and submissive to the plan that his father

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:44.159
gave him and we find that that mission that was given to Joseph was a mission

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:50.000
that resulted in him being put into the pit and eventually sold for 20 pieces of

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.919
silver to be a slave. And as I mentioned last week on Sunday evening I do not

00:00:55.919 --> 00:01:00.560
believe that Joseph understood that that would be the result of this trip of

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.839
fulfilling that which he was given orders from his father to do. I do not

00:01:05.839 --> 00:01:10.360
believe that Jacob thought that Joseph wouldn't come home. I think that Jacob's

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:16.360
expectation was that Joseph would return after he sent him on this mission and we

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.959
find that while this all was unfolding and as Joseph is being carried away

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:28.239
after being sold into slavery the brothers realize that they need to give

00:01:28.239 --> 00:01:34.120
some type of an answer and I believe that they now are seeking to execute the

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.959
plan that they simply made mention of in verse number 20. We'll be looking

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:43.559
specifically at verses 31 through 35 but notice in verse number 20 when they're

00:01:43.559 --> 00:01:48.760
there in Dothan and they see Joseph coming, remember before he was there they

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.440
conspired against him to slay him. They said behold this dreamer cometh and in

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.559
verse number 20 it says come now therefore and let us slay him and cast

00:01:58.559 --> 00:02:05.360
him into some pit and we will say some evil beast hath devoured him and we

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:11.960
shall see what will become of his dreams. We find that they did not slay Joseph. We

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.679
find that they decided to put him in the pit and figure out what they were going

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:22.160
to do and then as those merchantmen came by they decided to sell him instead of

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.440
killing him and they do not tell Jacob specifically that an evil beast hath

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.240
devoured him as they make mention in verse number 20 but we do see the

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.279
execution of the plan and we find that the Bible tells us, I want you to notice

00:02:35.279 --> 00:02:39.759
in verse 35, we'll read the verse and get into the message, it says and all his son

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:46.639
speaking of Jacob and his daughters rose up to comfort him but he refused to

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:52.479
be comforted and he said for I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning

00:02:52.479 --> 00:03:00.440
thus his father wept for him. I've titled the message this evening Jacob wept for

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.919
Joseph. Notice with me if you're taking notes this evening the behavior of the

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:09.440
brothers. We begin reading in verse number 31 the brothers sell Joseph into

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.679
slavery and notice in verse number 31 the Bible says that they took Joseph's

00:03:14.679 --> 00:03:20.800
coat and killed a kid of the goats and dipped the coat in the blood and they sent the

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.839
coat of many colors and they brought it to their father and said this have we

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:32.320
found. Know now whether it be thy son's coat or no. In verses 31 and 32 God gives

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.320
us insight with regard to the behavior of these brothers and we find that there

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.440
was an elaborate attempt that they make in order to cover their sin, to cover

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.279
what it was that they did and we find that as we look at this portion of

00:03:44.279 --> 00:03:48.479
scripture they take and they they kill a kid of the goats and they take that

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:53.800
coat of many colors that coat that was the distinguishing characteristic for

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.720
Joseph I understand as we look and we mentioned last week that even as they

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.639
saw him coming from afar how is it what was it that identified that that's

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:08.720
Joseph that comes no doubt that coat of many colors and they take that coat

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:15.399
which was a clear indication of Joseph's identity and they take that coat and they

00:04:15.399 --> 00:04:20.239
dip it in the blood and then they take and they send they bring that coat to

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:29.119
their father and notice what they say in verse 32 this have we found. Really? You

00:04:29.119 --> 00:04:34.640
found it? What did the Bible tell us that happened when he got there the Bible

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:40.640
tells us when Joseph arrived in Dothan in verse 18 when they saw him far off

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:45.760
even before he came near unto them they conspired against him to slay him right

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:51.480
and they have this idea as to what they're going to do and the Bible tells

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:56.480
us that they stripped him of his coat in verse number 23 it says and it came to

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.679
pass when Joseph was come unto his brethren so they had this plan as he was

00:05:00.679 --> 00:05:04.119
approaching but when they when he arrives in their presence it says in

00:05:04.119 --> 00:05:09.399
verse 23 that they stripped Joseph out of his coat his coat of many colors that

00:05:09.399 --> 00:05:15.320
was on him they did not send him to Egypt with that coat they kept the coat

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:21.720
and they say to Jacob this have we found and notice the question no now whether

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:28.480
it be thy son's coat or no. Now they obviously understood what Jacob would

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:35.079
believe at the sight of this coat it was Jacob that gave Joseph the coat and

00:05:35.079 --> 00:05:38.480
there was an understanding as to what would take place but I want you to think

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:44.399
about this elaborate attempt on the part of these brothers to cover their sin and

00:05:44.399 --> 00:05:49.480
we find that this is in line with other examples that we find in the Bible it's

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:55.040
Adam and Eve in Genesis chapter 3 that make an attempt to cover their sin we

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:59.679
find that when sin enters into the world as we read the record in Genesis

00:05:59.679 --> 00:06:05.000
chapter 3 that their eyes were opened and immediately they take and they take

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.160
these fig leaves and they try to cover their nakedness but the Bible also tells

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:16.559
us that they hid from God. God knew where they were when God comes into the garden

00:06:16.559 --> 00:06:21.679
and he says and he calls unto them it's not that he doesn't know where they are

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:27.359
that he's calling for them it's that he is letting them know of his presence and

00:06:27.359 --> 00:06:32.959
that he's seeking them and we find that God provides for them there in that

00:06:32.959 --> 00:06:39.200
passage of scripture a coat of skin an animal sacrifice had to be made thus

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:44.000
giving us the first of those pictures throughout the Old Testament of Messiah

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.760
who would one day come and shed his precious blood. I think about Rachel and

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:52.880
we read of this several weeks ago as we've been studying probably several

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.640
months ago at this point as we're studying through the book of Genesis and

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:01.119
we read in chapter number 31 remember that she stole those images from her

00:07:01.119 --> 00:07:06.559
father when they left and she hid those images and she was trying to cover her

00:07:06.559 --> 00:07:10.839
sin. We're familiar of course with Achan the

00:07:10.839 --> 00:07:14.399
troubler of Israel is how he is described in the book of 1st Chronicles

00:07:14.399 --> 00:07:20.239
and we find that Achan he took of the accursed thing he took that which was

00:07:20.239 --> 00:07:25.160
forbidden we know that God gave specific instruction to Joshua and to the

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:29.119
children of Israel as they entered in for the conquest of the land and we find

00:07:29.119 --> 00:07:33.519
that Achan thought that he could take of the spoils it's a picture of the first

00:07:33.519 --> 00:07:40.880
fruits that belong to the Lord and Achan took it and he hid it. What about David?

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:46.920
David thought he could cover his sin. David concocted a quite elaborate plan

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:52.440
even as we see here with the brothers of Joseph he developed this plan that he

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:57.480
thought no doubt his mind was foolproof that no one would understand what was

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:05.399
taking place but obviously God did. See man from the garden through these

00:08:05.399 --> 00:08:11.279
examples that I've referenced briefly we could go on and on all the way

00:08:11.279 --> 00:08:16.399
through human history until this very present day man has a tendency to try to

00:08:16.399 --> 00:08:23.640
cover his sin to cover his sin. Can I tell you this evening there's no point

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:29.880
in trying to cover your sin because God Almighty who knows all things knows

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:36.799
about your sin about my sin he knew about Adam and Eve he knew about Rachel

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:41.559
he knew about Achan he knew about David and we can just go right down the line

00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:48.400
God knows God knows and there's no point in trying to cover our sin we find that

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:54.280
God in his omniscience he knows all things but God in his mercy he's offered

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:58.599
forgiveness. Notice what the Bible says over in Psalm 69 and we'll reference a

00:08:58.599 --> 00:09:02.599
couple of verses that you're familiar with no doubt these verses of Scripture

00:09:02.599 --> 00:09:07.479
but but here's what I find in life is we can be familiar with something we can

00:09:07.479 --> 00:09:13.159
understand a principle a concept a truth and yet never actually apply it in our

00:09:13.159 --> 00:09:20.119
lives. We can be familiar with a biblical teaching we can have the truth given to

00:09:20.119 --> 00:09:25.520
us and we can agree with the truth but then when the practice of life comes we

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:32.080
go back to the normal tendency of humankind to say I'm gonna cover my sin

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:38.039
I'm gonna cover my transgression. In Psalm 69 in verse number 5 notice what

00:09:38.039 --> 00:09:48.479
the Bible says it says O God thou knowest my foolishness and my sins are

00:09:48.479 --> 00:10:00.000
not hid from thee. That's a true biblical declaration is it not? Your sins my sins

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.400
It's David's, this Psalm 69 is ascribed to David.

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:06.800
David, do you think David understood in a very real way

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:09.279
that his sins were not hid from God?

00:10:10.399 --> 00:10:11.359
I mean, think about David.

00:10:11.359 --> 00:10:14.960
He thought he had this elaborate plan to cover his sin.

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:17.040
He thought no one's gonna find out

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.459
about this situation with Bathsheba.

00:10:19.459 --> 00:10:22.559
And he went through this process of bringing Uriah home

00:10:22.559 --> 00:10:24.079
and we're gonna take care

00:10:24.079 --> 00:10:25.799
and everyone's gonna think that the child

00:10:25.799 --> 00:10:28.920
is the result of husband and wife,

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:31.760
but Uriah, he had great character

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.279
and he did not go in unto his wife.

00:10:34.279 --> 00:10:36.119
And we find that David then said,

00:10:36.119 --> 00:10:38.040
I'm gonna have to have this man killed.

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:41.099
And he writes the letter that he would carry

00:10:41.099 --> 00:10:45.119
to his commanding officer that would result in his death.

00:10:45.119 --> 00:10:48.080
And we find that David then marries Bathsheba

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:51.380
all in an attempt to cover his sin.

00:10:52.959 --> 00:10:54.520
But just a prophet of God

00:10:55.520 --> 00:11:00.520
that God revealed what happened to,

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:06.400
stands in David's presence and says, thou art the man.

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.239
David, you may have hid your sin from

00:11:10.239 --> 00:11:14.400
and you could lay out the list, but God knows.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.879
And here as David under the inspiration

00:11:16.879 --> 00:11:19.599
of the Holy Spirit of God would write this Psalm,

00:11:19.639 --> 00:11:24.639
he says, oh God, thou knowest my foolishness

00:11:25.199 --> 00:11:30.199
and my sins are not hid from thee.

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.599
Those are the Bible says over in Proverbs 28.

00:11:34.599 --> 00:11:37.319
In Proverbs 28, we all agree this evening,

00:11:37.319 --> 00:11:38.519
the Bible is true.

00:11:38.519 --> 00:11:40.239
We believe that that verse of scripture,

00:11:40.239 --> 00:11:42.239
David's testimony under the inspiration

00:11:42.239 --> 00:11:44.879
of Holy Spirit of God in Psalm 69 is a true thing.

00:11:44.879 --> 00:11:46.879
Your sins, just as David's sins,

00:11:46.879 --> 00:11:50.599
my sins, our sins are not hid from God.

00:11:50.599 --> 00:11:52.199
Do you agree with that tonight?

00:11:52.199 --> 00:11:54.599
They're not hid from God, he knows about it.

00:11:56.519 --> 00:12:00.879
Proverbs 28, the Bible says this in verse 13.

00:12:00.879 --> 00:12:05.879
He that covereth his sins shall not prosper.

00:12:09.039 --> 00:12:11.360
Is that hard to understand?

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:12.199
It really isn't.

00:12:12.199 --> 00:12:15.279
So many people say, oh, the Bible is so hard to understand.

00:12:15.279 --> 00:12:17.080
I understand there's a few passages of scriptures

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:19.119
that are a little bit more complicated than others,

00:12:19.119 --> 00:12:20.699
but I'm so thankful the Holy Spirit of God

00:12:20.699 --> 00:12:23.000
who is the divine teacher and author of God's word

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
indwells us and he teaches us.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.720
But most of the Bible is really not that hard to understand.

00:12:31.759 --> 00:12:32.880
You know where the hard part comes?

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:35.500
Applying it, being a doer of the word.

00:12:36.399 --> 00:12:40.800
The Bible says he that covereth his sins shall not prosper.

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.039
Now we like the Bible word shall.

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:47.479
When it comes to a verse like Romans 10 and verse 13,

00:12:47.479 --> 00:12:50.520
for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:53.399
shall be saved.

00:12:53.399 --> 00:12:55.419
And when we quote that verse of scripture,

00:12:55.419 --> 00:12:57.279
we like that word shall.

00:12:57.279 --> 00:12:59.520
And we say, listen, it doesn't mean that you might be saved.

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:00.919
It doesn't mean that you could be saved.

00:13:00.919 --> 00:13:04.600
It's certain you shall be saved.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:07.979
Well, here the Bible says that you shall not prosper.

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:13.500
But whoso, look at the contrast.

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:18.979
The one who covers his sins shall not prosper.

00:13:18.979 --> 00:13:21.539
But it says this in verse 13, what a great contrast.

00:13:21.539 --> 00:13:26.539
But whoso confesseth and forsaketh them,

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:32.580
the sins, shall have mercy.

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:36.080
Isn't that a wonderful truth of God's word?

00:13:37.039 --> 00:13:41.919
So basically, the option that is before us

00:13:41.919 --> 00:13:45.160
when you sin, when I sin, when anybody sins,

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:49.360
the option that is before us is to cover our sin

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:51.080
or to confess our sin.

00:13:52.279 --> 00:13:54.639
And if we cover our sin, the Bible says

00:13:54.639 --> 00:13:56.979
you shall not prosper.

00:13:56.979 --> 00:14:00.199
If we confess and forsake, the Bible says

00:14:00.199 --> 00:14:03.279
ye shall have mercy.

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:06.520
Now, if we look at the result, which one do you want?

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:09.820
Do you want mercy or do you want shall not prosper?

00:14:11.119 --> 00:14:12.679
I don't think any one of us would say

00:14:12.679 --> 00:14:15.720
I'm gonna line up on the side that says shall not prosper.

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:20.040
Right, no one wants to be in that line.

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:23.040
Everyone wants to be in the line that says shall have mercy.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:25.600
So why do we cover our sin?

00:14:27.119 --> 00:14:28.339
It's a human tendency.

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:30.440
It's not just Adam and Eve.

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:31.459
It's not just Rachel.

00:14:31.459 --> 00:14:35.179
It's not just the sons of Jacob here,

00:14:35.179 --> 00:14:36.260
the brothers of Joseph.

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:39.220
It's not just Achan and David.

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:41.940
No, no, no, it's a human tendency

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:44.980
to try to cover our sins.

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:46.299
You know why I know it's a human tendency?

00:14:46.299 --> 00:14:48.859
You ever observed the behavior of children?

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:55.600
Most children, you don't have to teach them to lie.

00:14:56.899 --> 00:14:59.700
You don't have to teach them to cover their sin.

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:01.779
You don't.

00:15:03.779 --> 00:15:05.339
It's in them.

00:15:05.339 --> 00:15:06.579
It's in you.

00:15:06.579 --> 00:15:08.899
And this evening, when we look at this passage of scripture

00:15:08.899 --> 00:15:11.100
in Genesis 37, the very first thing,

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:12.820
we understand the historical context

00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:14.540
of what God is telling us,

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:16.619
but as we make the spiritual application,

00:15:16.619 --> 00:15:19.579
we see that here, and we look at some,

00:15:19.579 --> 00:15:22.420
excuse me, at Genesis 37, verses 31 and 32,

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:25.579
and we say I can't believe they would do that.

00:15:26.579 --> 00:15:30.459
But then we sin, and we try to cover our sin.

00:15:30.459 --> 00:15:33.739
We may not do the same thing that the sons of Joseph did,

00:15:33.739 --> 00:15:35.420
excuse me, the brothers of Joseph did.

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:37.220
We may not go through the same process,

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:38.700
but we try to cover our sin,

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:41.579
and we find that they go through this elaborate process

00:15:41.579 --> 00:15:43.100
to try to cover their sin,

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:46.179
but I want you to know, even as I made mention last week,

00:15:46.179 --> 00:15:50.859
that though they had received those pieces of silver,

00:15:50.859 --> 00:15:53.760
20 pieces for 10 brothers, two pieces each,

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:55.920
and though they went through this process

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:57.920
of trying to cover their sin,

00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:59.480
they tried to cover their tracks,

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:02.559
and they tried to appease their conscience,

00:16:02.559 --> 00:16:05.160
we know that the Bible would reveal to us,

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:07.720
as you read in chapter 42 and verse number 21,

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:09.480
that it haunted them.

00:16:10.799 --> 00:16:14.440
I'm thankful this evening that my Bible

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:17.500
and your Bible tells us about God,

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:21.679
that he is a God who is ready to pardon.

00:16:21.679 --> 00:16:25.440
He is a God who is ready to forgive.

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:28.720
And this evening, as we look at the historical account,

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:31.519
and we see what's happening here

00:16:31.519 --> 00:16:33.480
with the brothers of Joseph,

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:35.799
we find that they go through this process

00:16:35.799 --> 00:16:37.440
of trying to cover their sin.

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:41.000
Their behavior is not exemplary.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.540
We find that their behavior is problematic,

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:46.720
but yet we, in our own lives, if we're not careful,

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:49.559
we sin and try to cover our sin.

00:16:49.559 --> 00:16:50.959
We try to cover our sin.

00:16:52.119 --> 00:16:53.600
But we understand, the Bible says,

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:55.880
that we shall not prosper.

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:58.760
Notice, as we continue back in Genesis chapter 37,

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:00.880
we see the behavior of the brothers,

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:02.519
but I want you to note, number two,

00:17:02.519 --> 00:17:04.119
the belief of Jacob.

00:17:04.119 --> 00:17:06.160
Note carefully, as we look at this text,

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:07.760
and I've made mention of it already,

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:11.559
that they do not tell Jacob that this is Joseph's coat.

00:17:11.559 --> 00:17:15.799
No, they do not tell Jacob that Joseph has been killed.

00:17:15.799 --> 00:17:17.760
They know that Joseph wasn't killed.

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:19.959
They sold him into slavery.

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:24.200
They simply ask questions,

00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:30.320
knowing how Jacob is going to respond to what he sees.

00:17:32.839 --> 00:17:33.799
I've already made mention,

00:17:33.799 --> 00:17:35.980
as we looked at this portion of Scripture last week,

00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:40.420
with regard to the journey that Joseph was sent on,

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:41.600
and we think about that mission

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:43.040
that he was given from his father,

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:47.380
and to go from where he was there with his father

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:50.600
to go to Shechem was a 60-mile journey,

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:53.760
and he would take from Hebron to Shechem that 60 miles,

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:56.320
and then he would have to travel an additional 12 miles

00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:57.839
to go down to Dothan,

00:17:57.839 --> 00:18:00.480
and no doubt, there was some difficult terrain.

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:04.140
There was some potential danger

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:07.320
that Joseph would face along the way.

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:09.420
So now, all of a sudden, the brothers return.

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:11.600
Now, remember, the brothers were gone,

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:13.839
evidently for an extended period of time,

00:18:13.839 --> 00:18:16.600
such that Jacob said, I need to send you, Joseph,

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:19.839
to find out, to see what's going on.

00:18:19.839 --> 00:18:21.799
Now, all of a sudden, the brothers return,

00:18:21.799 --> 00:18:25.239
and they bring this coat, and they say, we found this.

00:18:25.239 --> 00:18:26.799
Do you know whose coat this is?

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:31.519
Now, if you have something that's very recognizable,

00:18:31.519 --> 00:18:32.679
and someone brings it to you and says,

00:18:32.679 --> 00:18:34.359
hey, do you know whose this is?

00:18:34.359 --> 00:18:37.320
Ah, I mean, you're gonna easily identify it.

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:40.359
Jacob had given this coat to his son.

00:18:40.359 --> 00:18:41.840
We know that it was the coat,

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:44.520
according to verse number three of Genesis 37,

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:46.159
the Bible says, now Israel loved Joseph

00:18:46.159 --> 00:18:47.000
more than all his children

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.520
because he was the son of his old age,

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:51.640
and he made him a coat of many colors.

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:54.559
And so, you understand that he was intimately

00:18:55.479 --> 00:18:57.760
understanding what this coat was

00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:59.719
and who this coat belonged to,

00:18:59.719 --> 00:19:02.440
and they asked this question

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:05.000
as they give this coat of many colors

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.840
that's saturated in blood, the blood of a goat,

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:11.559
and they simply allowed Jacob to reach a conclusion.

00:19:13.119 --> 00:19:15.919
The conclusion that Jacob reaches

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:19.840
is a conclusion that's given to us in verse number 33,

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:24.719
and he knew it, they knew that he would recognize the coat,

00:19:24.719 --> 00:19:29.039
and he said, it is my son's coat.

00:19:29.039 --> 00:19:33.520
Notice what he says, an evil beast hath devoured him.

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:38.520
Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.

00:19:40.679 --> 00:19:43.320
Now, do these 10 brothers know that that wasn't true?

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:46.119
They knew that wasn't true,

00:19:47.359 --> 00:19:48.760
but you know what they did?

00:19:49.799 --> 00:19:51.559
They allowed Jacob to believe that.

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:56.479
In my estimation, this is one of the greatest examples

00:19:56.479 --> 00:19:59.960
in the Bible of deception, of deception.

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:04.300
So many people say, well, lying and deceiving isn't really lying.

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:05.300
It is.

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:08.980
If you want to split hairs and draw lines, that's up to you.

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:16.740
But the reality is that they allowed this man Jacob, their father, to believe this lie.

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:18.780
They knew the truth.

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:22.860
And yet they allowed him through this process of deception.

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:28.420
Now notice as we look at the text, they could excuse their behavior.

00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:33.740
Well, we didn't tell him that it was Jacob's, or excuse me, Joseph's.

00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:38.120
We didn't tell him that he was dead.

00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:41.100
We don't read that that happens in the text of Scripture.

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:45.400
But I want you to understand that we so often excuse.

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:49.900
We look at this text and look at the covering and the elaborate plan to try to cover their

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:51.500
deeds and what they did.

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:55.620
But then as we would think about our own lives, there are times in which we excuse our behavior.

00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:57.300
Well, I didn't really say that.

00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:59.820
I didn't really do that.

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:05.180
We find here in the text of Scripture that Jacob believes, I mean, he's confident in

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:09.920
what he believes as the evidence is there before him and he knows the coat.

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:13.080
This is my son's coat.

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:19.500
And there's no doubt, he says, an evil beast hath devoured him.

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:24.340
Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.

00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:27.780
That's what he believed.

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:31.180
We see the behavior of the brothers.

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:35.980
We see the belief of Jacob as we continue and finish through the text of Scripture.

00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:38.940
We see the brokenness of Jacob.

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:40.660
The brokenness of Jacob.

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:47.900
This news of receiving this coat and reaching the conclusion that he reaches in verse number

00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:52.300
33 led Jacob to a place of complete brokenness.

00:21:52.300 --> 00:22:00.560
As we read in verses 34 and 35, and the Bible says in verse 35, and Jacob rent his clothes

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:09.140
and put on sackcloth upon his loins and mourned for his son many days.

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:13.680
Now it's interesting to me as I look at this portion of Scripture to consider the sons

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:19.900
of Jacob standing before him and observing his response.

00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:26.100
A man who has rent his clothes, who has put on the sackcloth upon his loins, who is mourning

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:31.300
for his son, and they know the truth.

00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:34.500
They're happy to just let him sit there and be broken.

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:37.500
It's unbelievable.

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:42.500
The cold heart of these brothers.

00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:48.180
The Bible says, it's very interesting as you look in verse 35, that all his sons and all

00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:51.020
his daughters rose up to comfort him.

00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:59.460
How in the world could these boys try to comfort him when they knew the truth?

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:04.380
And they're trying to comfort their father.

00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:10.820
Now the Bible tells us that he refused to be comforted.

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:14.660
But as I begin to think about the behavior of the boys and looking at what's happening

00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:20.620
there, how could they actually, you know Job said miserable comforters are ye all, right?

00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:24.660
And you look here, I don't think that the sons of Jacob, the brothers of Joseph would

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:26.420
be very good comforters.

00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:31.220
They knew the truth.

00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:33.660
And yet they rise up and they try to comfort him.

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:40.480
Do you see how they continue to go through the lengths of trying to cover and to try

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:45.240
to appease their conscience?

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:51.160
We find that the Bible says that he, Jacob, refused to be comforted.

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:54.080
And notice what the Bible says.

00:23:54.080 --> 00:24:05.000
Here's what he concludes, for I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:10.240
Jacob did not know how many more days, years he had to live.

00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:17.360
The conclusion that he reaches is that until I take my final breath, I'm going to be mourning

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:20.480
for my son.

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:29.000
Why do you think, as the Bible concludes in verse 35, thus his father wept for him?

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.360
Jacob wept for Joseph.

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:33.680
Why is it that Jacob is weeping for his son?

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:37.400
Why is it that he says I'll go to my grave mourning for my son?

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:42.440
No doubt there's the love and the concern that a parent has for their children, but

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:46.920
I wonder this evening that as you look at the text of Scripture, perhaps there was some

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:52.780
level in which Jacob was blaming himself for what has transpired.

00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:57.760
For Jacob was the one that sent Joseph on the mission.

00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:02.640
And he's reached the conclusion his sons allow him to reach falsely.

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:08.680
The conclusion that a wild beast hath devoured him, an evil beast hath devoured him, and

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:13.040
he's wondering maybe if I would have sent him with more people, maybe if I…

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:17.920
You understand how our minds play games.

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:24.560
And as we look at this man that's weeping, that's mourning, all the while Joseph's actually

00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:28.800
alive.

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:31.320
And the brothers know it.

00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:33.080
They're aware of it.

00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:39.480
We'll deal with it in more detail as we continue to study through the book of Genesis and as

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:46.720
we continue to deal with all that takes place with regard to the behavior of Joseph and

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:49.680
where he ends up and all that's taking place.

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:54.880
But we find that as we've referenced already in chapter 42 and verse number 21, that the

00:25:54.880 --> 00:26:01.280
brothers on that first encounter with Joseph there in Egypt, notice what they say.

00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:05.680
It says that they said one to another, we are verily guilty concerning our brother and

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:11.360
that we saw the anguish of his soul when he besought us and we would not hear.

00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:14.840
Therefore is this distress come upon us.

00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:20.600
We find that as we continue and begin to see what's taking place that the brothers continue

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:24.320
to be fearful and they continue to have concern.

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:31.240
And they ask the question, they remember Jacob sends the boys to go again, but what was the

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:37.200
Joseph gave this one condition by which he would see his brothers again.

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:39.400
Who remembers what it was?

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:42.000
Yeah, Benjamin had to come, right?

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.040
And then what happens?

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:45.040
Benjamin is apprehended.

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:49.840
All of a sudden you start to see more brokenness on the part of these brothers.

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:55.920
They say how can we tell our father that Benjamin, and we'll deal with all of this as we continue

00:26:55.920 --> 00:27:03.360
to go through the portion of scripture through the book of Genesis before Joseph will eventually

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:07.160
reveal himself to his brothers.

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:11.520
It's interesting in verse number 31 of chapter 44, notice what the Bible says.

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:19.680
We'll actually back up just a little bit into verse number 25, verse 24 of chapter number

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:23.920
44, verse 24, it says, and it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant, my father,

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:25.120
we told him the words of my Lord.

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:28.040
And our father said, go again and buy us a little food.

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:29.040
Verse 26.

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:30.040
And we said, we cannot go down.

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:34.040
If our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down for we may not see the man's face

00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:35.920
except our youngest brother be with us.

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:38.040
Now did Jacob want to send Benjamin?

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:42.380
No, he was resistant to the idea of sending Benjamin.

00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:46.920
No doubt the thought of Joseph was on his mind and he was resistant to that.

00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:53.160
And we find that it says in verse number 27, and my servant, my father said unto us, you

00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:57.760
know that my wife bear me two sons and the one went out from me and I said, surely he

00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:00.080
is torn in pieces and I saw him not since.

00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:02.640
Who is that?

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:05.380
Joseph's the one that's hearing these words.

00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:07.880
The brothers are rehearsing this to him.

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:17.680
They don't know that it's Joseph yet, but Joseph knows that it's them.

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:23.580
And if you take this also, verse 29, from me and mischief befall him, you shall bring

00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:27.440
down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:31.720
Now therefore, when I am come to thy servant, my father, and the lad be not with us, seeing

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:36.760
that his life is bound up in the lad's life, it shall come to pass when he seeth that the

00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:40.040
lad is not with us, that he will die.

00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:44.800
And thy servant shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant, our father, with sorrow

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:45.800
to the grave.

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:51.600
You know what God's doing over these next several chapters in the book of Genesis?

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:58.880
He's breaking the sons of Jacob because of their sin.

00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:01.200
The Bible says the way of transgressors is hard.

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:04.880
That's what the Bible says.

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:09.760
This evening, when we look at Genesis 37, and again, I've just kind of spotted through

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:16.280
some of the chapters and looking at how God would work to break the sons of Jacob because

00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:18.460
they covered their sins.

00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:24.559
They had a guilty conscience, and God is working to break them over those next several chapters

00:29:24.559 --> 00:29:25.800
and years.

00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:30.960
This isn't just a few weeks, I mean, these are years that transpire that they're dealing

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:31.960
with this.

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:38.040
But what I'd say this evening, you cover your sin, you shall not prosper.

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:45.600
Wouldn't it be so much better to just have mercy, to have forgiveness?

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:50.640
You know, I wonder this evening, it's as if, I heard somebody say this once years and years

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:51.640
ago, no one that's here.

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:56.160
They said, well, I don't want to go to the altar during a service because somebody might

00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:58.559
think I'm a sinner.

00:29:58.559 --> 00:29:59.080
Really?

00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:06.360
really, somebody might think, we all know that we're sinners. Amen? And you know all

00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:13.840
that that is is pride. It's just pride. It's just pride. And by the way, the Bible says

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:23.480
God resisteth the proud, but He giveth grace to the humble.

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:28.460
This evening, we look at a historical account here in the book of Genesis, the 37th chapter.

00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:34.140
We can scratch our head and say, how could they do that? When we make spiritual application

00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:41.360
to their behavior, and then we examine our own lives, we're saying, why is it at times

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:47.000
that we try to cover our own sin? Why do we try to make excuses for our behavior, excuse

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:56.860
our sin? We have a God who knows everything. Our sins are not hid from God. And He says

00:30:56.860 --> 00:31:02.400
that if we confess our sins, He's faithful and just to forgive us, to cleanse us from

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:09.800
all unrighteousness. What a blessing to know that He that confesseth and forsaketh shall

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:18.240
have mercy. See, we don't have to live for days. We don't have to live for hours, days,

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:25.640
weeks, months, or years with a guilty conscience. We don't have to go through all sorts of things

00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:34.980
where God is breaking us. We can simply confess it to a God who loves us and promises to forgive

00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:41.700
us. And as you evaluate it, it just makes so much sense that we would go to our loving

00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:56.840
heavenly Father. Yep, it's me again. I sinned. I sinned. It's wicked. It's ungodly. We don't

00:31:56.840 --> 00:32:04.680
sugar coat it. It's a transgression against the law. And I know that you love me, and

00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:10.880
I'm asking that you forgive me. Restore the fellowship. See, you know one of the things

00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:17.020
that's interesting to me, and I feel like sometimes as 21st century Christians it's

00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:24.620
almost like we don't fully grasp it. You know what's really terrible about sin in the life

00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:34.340
of a believer? It hinders our fellowship with our Father. Do you think for a moment that

00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:42.660
these 10 sons of Jacob had proper fellowship with Jacob, with all those going on? No. They

00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:49.320
can't have that proper communion and fellowship with their Father. And our heavenly Father,

00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:54.700
I don't want to jeopardize that fellowship. I'm thankful that the relationship is constant.

00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:59.100
I'm always going to be his son. He's always going to be my Father, because he gave me

00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:06.340
eternal life. But I want the fellowship to be sweet. We sing the song, and how appropriate

00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:16.220
it is, there's nothing between my soul and my Savior. Why? I don't want anything to hinder

00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:23.760
my fellowship with God. And when we sin, we know this. We dealt with this on a Wednesday

00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:31.120
night just a few weeks ago in 1 John chapter 2. We have an advocate with the Father, Jesus

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:37.520
Christ the righteous, and what a wonderful blessing that God gives us. This evening we

00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:43.200
see that Jacob wept for Joseph. We see the circumstances surrounding it, but I hope that

00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:49.360
we'd grab that spiritual application, and as we look at the behavior of those boys,

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:56.040
we say, I don't, that's not behavior that's exemplary. I don't want to follow that type

00:33:56.040 --> 00:34:02.920
of behavior. I don't want to cover sin in my life. I want to confess it and forsake

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:07.560
it and have forgiveness. Let's pray together. Father, we love you this evening. We thank

00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:13.080
you for loving us. We thank you for the Bible and for the truth of your Word. We thank you

00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:18.520
for the historical account that we receive in this portion of Scripture, but as we think

00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:25.620
of the spiritual application, how we're challenged in our lives. Lord, I thank you for how this

00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:36.160
passage in Genesis 37 leads so easily tonight into our observance of the Lord's Supper.

00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:42.480
As we understand that this table that is before us is not only a table of remembrance, though

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:50.440
it is, it's also a table of examination. And God, I pray that there'd be, even as the

00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:58.780
songwriter said, nothing between my soul and my Savior. God, I pray that as we examine

00:34:58.780 --> 00:35:05.840
ourselves that, God, you'd help us to be honest, humble, help us to confess and forsake, help

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:12.680
us to have the mercy and the forgiveness that you promise. I pray, Lord, that you would

00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:19.880
help us to refuse to cover and excuse sin in our lives. We would not follow the pattern

00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:28.800
that was established by Adam and Eve and Rachel and these sons of Jacob and Achan and David

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:38.360
and so many others. God, we'd come to you and find mercy. Bless now as we observe the

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:43.300
Lord's Supper. I pray, Lord, that you would move and work as only you can, and we'll thank

00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:46.320
you for it. In Christ's name we pray. Amen.
