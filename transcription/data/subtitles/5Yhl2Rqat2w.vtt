00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.940
You can find biblical foundation as we sing the wonderful, great hymns of the faith.

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:12.319
And that's certainly helpful as we are reminded of the truth of the word of God.

00:00:12.319 --> 00:00:16.520
Genesis chapter number 11 this evening, Genesis chapter number 11.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.959
And we'll begin looking in chapter, verse number 10 of chapter 11 and going down through

00:00:20.959 --> 00:00:23.520
the end of the chapter this evening.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.260
And as we look at this passage of scripture, of course on Sunday evenings for a while now

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.360
we have studied through the book of Genesis.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.119
We've not done it consistently every single Sunday evening.

00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:40.639
But this is our 35th lesson through the book of Genesis and lesson number 35.

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:43.840
And we'll be finishing up the 11th chapter this evening.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.959
As you're aware through our study, we have understood that the book of Genesis is under

00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:49.959
attack regularly.

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:57.040
In fact, these first 11 chapters of the book of Genesis provide not only instruction for

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.419
us with regard to these things of the beginnings and of course creation and what have you.

00:01:01.419 --> 00:01:07.419
But we find that these truths that are provided to us, we look at the fact of creation, but

00:01:07.419 --> 00:01:10.019
we also look at the truth of civilization.

00:01:10.019 --> 00:01:16.940
We understand that the book is of great foundational significance and importance for us as the

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:17.980
people of God.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.739
As I've mentioned often throughout the study of the book of Genesis that we have found

00:01:22.739 --> 00:01:28.440
that the truth of the book of Genesis and creation is not exclusive to just the book

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.440
of Genesis.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.760
We find it throughout the whole of scripture.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.239
And as we interpret scripture with scripture and we go through and we begin to see how

00:01:36.239 --> 00:01:40.239
foundational this book is for our faith.

00:01:40.239 --> 00:01:46.480
Of course, we understand there are great mountaintop truths that are provided to us in Genesis

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.040
1 through 11.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.180
As we think about the track of civilization and we'll be looking at some of that this

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.180
evening.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.139
And so we are reminded that in Genesis chapter number four, we read about the descendants

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:01.300
of Cain.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.180
We came to Genesis chapter number five and we had the opportunity as the beginning of

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.419
the chapter starts about this is the book of the generations of Adam.

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:15.979
And we find that the lineage is given to us from Adam through Noah, of course through

00:02:16.279 --> 00:02:18.479
his child, Adam's son, Seth.

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:22.619
And we trace that in Genesis chapter number five and we deal with the great flood in chapter

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:27.839
number six and seven and eight and then of course after the flood and the Noahic covenant

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:30.839
as it is described to us in Genesis chapter number nine.

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:35.119
And we come to Genesis chapter number 10 and in Genesis chapter number 10 we are given

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:40.919
the generations of the son of Noah, the sons of Japheth, the sons of Ham, the sons of Shem.

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:45.639
And we read of that in Genesis chapter number 10 and then we enter into the 11th chapter

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.820
and as we studied in our previous message, we see in verses one through nine the record

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:56.139
of the Tower of Babel and how that God confounded their languages and they were dispersed around

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:57.139
the world.

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:01.779
And we found that it was of note and we began entering into the portion of scripture that

00:03:01.779 --> 00:03:06.660
we'll begin, that we'll study this evening, that once again in chapter number 11 in verses

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:12.979
10 and following, we have the opportunity once again to read of these are the generations

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:13.979
of Shem.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.399
And remember, this is given to us back in chapter number 10 in verses 21 through 32

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:21.380
and yet we find that it's given to us again.

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.899
We could ask this question, why?

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:28.380
I believe that as we look at the whole of scripture and we see how that God is giving

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:36.699
us the truth with regard to civilization and the way in which the civilization would move

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:43.619
forward and all that's taking place, we find that God is narrowing in and the focus becomes

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:44.619
Abraham.

00:03:44.619 --> 00:03:49.779
Of course, Abram as we begin to be introduced to him, of course his name will later be changed

00:03:49.779 --> 00:03:50.779
to Abraham.

00:03:50.779 --> 00:03:56.699
But we find that tracing the ancestry to Abram, why is that so significant?

00:03:56.699 --> 00:04:02.979
You remember that Shem, according to Genesis 9 in verse number 26, one of the things that

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:07.779
was said when Noah gave this message with regard to Shem, he said, it blessed be the

00:04:07.779 --> 00:04:12.059
Lord God of Shem and Canaan shall be his servant.

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:18.420
He spoke about the fact that through Shem, the Semitics, the truth of the messianic

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:26.700
line and that the lineage of Jesus Christ, our Messiah, would now come in full focus.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:32.140
And as we come again to chapter number 11 and begin to read this record of the generations

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:39.220
of the son of Shem, we find that it's in order to trace the ancestry to Abraham and we find

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:44.899
that of course he is the father of the nation of the Hebrews and you look at all of that

00:04:44.899 --> 00:04:49.019
with the nation of Israel and we'll mention several things this evening, even as we look

00:04:49.019 --> 00:04:50.980
at some of the New Testament truth.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.140
And so as we dig in this evening and we see that the lens is zooming, the lens of scripture

00:04:55.140 --> 00:05:01.579
is zooming in and we'll primarily focus upon the life and descendants of Abraham, of course

00:05:01.579 --> 00:05:05.619
the ancestors of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

00:05:05.619 --> 00:05:10.579
It's important to note, and I've said this in many different passages of scripture, we

00:05:10.579 --> 00:05:18.459
see this truth revealed to us that often when you see the attacks and the constant warfare

00:05:18.459 --> 00:05:23.779
that takes place against the nation of Israel throughout its history, you find that it's

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:27.700
that war, that spiritual warfare that we deal with, right?

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:32.500
We wrestle not against flesh and blood and as we study the Old Testament, we see what's

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:37.420
happening, we see these many various groups of people that would attack the people of

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:43.220
God, we find that it was the enemy, Satan himself, that's trying to destroy the line

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:44.859
of Messiah.

00:05:44.859 --> 00:05:46.619
That's the ultimate goal.

00:05:46.619 --> 00:05:51.140
The ultimate goal of Satan was to destroy the line of Messiah.

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:55.059
He was not successful, of course, because we know that God is greater.

00:05:55.059 --> 00:06:01.500
In Jesus Christ, the Messiah came as was promised and he lived a perfect and sinless life.

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.500
He went to the cross of Calvary, by the way, Satan would do everything within his power

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:10.100
to prevent that from happening, and we find that, of course, Christ went to the cross,

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:16.179
he was buried, he rose in victory, and we find that he will come again.

00:06:16.179 --> 00:06:21.559
And so the lens of scripture, beginning here at the latter part of chapter 11, begins to

00:06:21.559 --> 00:06:28.339
zoom in upon Abraham and his descendants, and really from this point throughout the

00:06:28.339 --> 00:06:31.220
remainder of the scriptures.

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:36.980
Notice with me, if you're taking notes, number one, very simply, the generations of Shem.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:41.779
In verses 10 through 26, the Bible gives us the record of the generations of Shem.

00:06:41.779 --> 00:06:46.579
Now I want you to take some notes, maybe jot them in your Bible or you have a notepad there.

00:06:46.579 --> 00:06:53.380
I want to help us create, if we can, a timeline of how long these things happened after the

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:54.820
flood.

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:59.959
Notice with me that as we read of the generations of Shem, that it will specifically give us

00:06:59.959 --> 00:07:06.279
noted dates as to how long after the flood these things happened, and it helps us to

00:07:06.279 --> 00:07:10.640
create that timeline and understand these things that are taking place.

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:15.279
In verse number 10, these are the generations of Shem.

00:07:15.279 --> 00:07:22.760
Shem wasn't 100 years old, and you notice it says in our facts ad, two years after the

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:23.760
flood.

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:27.799
Now we understand, the scriptures have been clear, we've mentioned it many times throughout

00:07:27.799 --> 00:07:32.760
our study, that there were only eight human beings that got off of the ark.

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:33.760
Amen?

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:38.559
Noah, Mrs. Noah, his three sons, and his three daughter-in-laws.

00:07:38.559 --> 00:07:39.559
Eight human beings.

00:07:39.559 --> 00:07:46.640
That's all that came off of the ark, and we find that by them was the whole earth overspread.

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:52.480
Again, this is mentioned a couple of times in chapter 9, again in chapter number 10,

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:59.000
and we see here that the first of the children of Shem to be mentioned is Arphaxad, and he's

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.760
born two years after the flood.

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:09.720
The Bible says in Shem, verse 11, lived after Arphaxad 500 years, and begat sons and daughters.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:14.760
Though the details of all of those 500 years are not given to us, in like manner, as the

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:20.320
scriptures tell us at the end of chapter 9, that Noah lived another 350 years, but there's

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:26.320
really no reference and no information given to us with regard to those 350 years of his

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:27.320
life.

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:32.340
We come to verse 12, and Arphaxad lived five and 30 years, and begat Selah.

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:38.119
And so this, verse number 12, is 37 years after the flood.

00:08:38.119 --> 00:08:44.239
We come to verse 13, and Arphaxad lived after he begat Selah 403 years, begat sons and daughters,

00:08:44.239 --> 00:08:47.039
and Selah lived 30 years, and begat Eber.

00:08:47.119 --> 00:08:53.960
So in verse 14, we now are 67 years after the flood.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:57.840
67 years have passed, and we find that Eber is born.

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:03.119
Verse 15, Selah lived after he begat Eber 403 years, and begat sons and daughters, and

00:09:03.119 --> 00:09:07.000
Eber lived four and 30 years, and begat Peleg.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.359
So this is 101 years after the flood.

00:09:09.359 --> 00:09:14.320
I mentioned this last time in our previous study, the Tower of Babel, that back in chapter

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:20.320
number 10, in verse number 25, when it speaks about Peleg, it says, in his days was the

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.919
earth divided.

00:09:21.919 --> 00:09:26.000
And so it would appear, as we look at that division that is mentioned in chapter number

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.840
11, with regard to the Tower of Babel, that the Tower of Babel incident happened just

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:34.000
about 100 years after the flood.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.719
101 years is when Peleg was born, 101 years after the flood.

00:09:38.719 --> 00:09:43.880
Verse 17, and Eber lived after he begat Peleg 430 years, and begat sons and daughters, and

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.760
Peleg lived 30 years, and begat Rehu.

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:51.760
And so here we're at now, in verse 18, we're at 131 years after the flood.

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:57.359
I know this is kind of classroom-ish, bear with me, we're going to get through it, amen?

00:09:57.359 --> 00:09:59.960
And it's good for, listen, God's got a detail.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:04.360
So it's good for us to see how he provides this to us and we understand what's taking

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:05.360
place.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:10.400
Verse 19, and Peleg lived after he begat Rehu 209 years and begat sons and daughters.

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:15.160
Rehu, according to verse 20, lived two and 30 years and begat Sarug.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:19.520
This is now 163 years after the flood.

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:24.160
Rehu lived after he begat Sarug 207 years and begat sons and daughters.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:28.560
And Sarug lived 30 years and begat Nahor.

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:31.920
According to verse number 22, if you add it all up and you do the math and you do it

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:37.160
properly, you're at 193 years after the flood.

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:42.820
Verse 23, Sarug lived after he begat Nahor 200 years and begat sons and daughters.

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:47.000
And Nahor lived nine and 20 years and begat Terah.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.480
We are now at 222 years after the flood.

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:58.600
222 years have passed since Noah and his wife, his three sons, and three daughter-in-laws

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:02.560
came off of that arc, 222 years.

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:05.920
We find that the Bible says that Nahor lived nine and 20 years, begat Terah.

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:11.600
In verse 24, he lived after he begat Terah 119 years and begat sons and daughters.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:15.920
Now it's interesting to note that in verse number 25, it says that Nahor lived after

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:20.720
he begat Terah 119 years, begat sons and daughters.

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:25.320
And so as we think about this, if you look back in verse number 11, it says, and Shem

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:28.760
lived after he begat Arphaxad, how many years?

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:31.040
500 years.

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:38.640
But now by the time you get down to Nahor and you see what's happening is he lived 119

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:43.360
years after he begat his son, Terah.

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:47.040
And it's interesting for you find that he was, according to verse number 24, he was

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:54.200
nine and 20 years when he begat Terah, and you understand that Shem was 100 years old.

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:59.200
And so you think about, as we find here, really an interesting note with regard to the longevity

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:03.520
of mankind pre-flood and post-flood.

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:09.120
And you understand that all of those events that took place during the flood, we mentioned

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:14.600
about the catastrophic events that took place in Genesis chapter number 6 and 7 and 8 as

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:19.000
we studied about the flood and we understood those things that were taking place and we

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:27.280
see that there is a direct impact on all of the earth and we see that impact even upon

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:30.320
the longevity of mankind.

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:36.520
Of course, as we mentioned, that you look in some of the beginnings of these great patriarchs

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:42.600
and you see how many years they lived and you eventually get to, you know, from 950

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:49.640
years living to be that age to Joseph at the end of Genesis, 110, and Joshua, 110,

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:54.800
and of course Moses, speaking of the fact that three score and ten, if by reason of

00:12:54.800 --> 00:13:00.800
strength, four score, 70 or 80 years, you look, you see that in Psalm 90.

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:05.680
And so we find here that there is an interesting note with regard to, yes, we're seeing the

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:11.760
generations of Shem and we're following the line, we get to Terah in verse number 24,

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:16.360
and of course he's the father of Abram, we'll continue there in just a moment, but we do

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:23.880
see an obvious decrease in the life expectancy of these individuals.

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:29.360
We come to now looking at not only the generations of Shem, but notice the generations of Terah.

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:34.360
Really beginning in verse number 26, the Bible says, and Terah lived 70 years and began Abram,

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:37.480
Nahor, and Haran.

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:42.640
Now, this is 292 years after the flood.

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:47.920
When it's mentioned here in verse number 26, again, if you add all of the years up and

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:54.720
all of this that is provided to us, we come to 292 years after the flood.

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:58.600
It says in verse number 27, now these are the generations of Terah.

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:02.440
Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran, and Haran begat Lot.

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:06.760
I'm going to pause there just for a moment, and I want to deal with just something here

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:10.600
to look at what's taking place as we kind of add up some numbers and look at what's

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:11.720
going on.

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:15.640
Of course there are some, and I'll be completely transparent with you, I'm going to give you

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:24.520
a position that is not 100%, I guess, consistent across the board, maybe that's a good way

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:25.520
to put it.

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:28.820
But I believe when you compare Scripture with Scripture, you kind of look at what's taking

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:32.200
place with regard to the ages of these individuals.

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:38.240
I understand where some come with the date that they come to with regard to these things,

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:42.960
but we find that it says that Terah lived 70 years and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:48.400
Some, I'm not going to take this approach this evening, some would give the idea that

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:54.480
Abram, Nahor, and Haran were triplets, and they were all born when Terah was 70.

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:59.560
However, again, when we compare Scripture with Scripture, remember, even as we looked

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:06.240
at the sons of Noah, they're not always listed based on their birth order, right?

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:11.200
Again, the focus of Scripture here in Genesis chapter 11 and going forward is going to zoom

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.660
in upon who?

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:13.660
Upon Abram.

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:18.760
And so Abram is listed first, it does not necessarily mean he is the oldest, however,

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:22.080
and as you look at the Scripture, skip down to verse number 32, we're going to get back

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:26.280
to verses 27 through 31 in just a moment, but look at verse number 32, the Bible says

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:33.560
in the days of Terah were 205 years, and notice this, Terah died where?

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:34.560
In Haran.

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:38.840
Now we know, and we'll study in just a moment, how they were to go from the Ur of the Chaldees

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:43.960
to Canaan, but they went the route that they would go, or that they traveled, they found

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:45.760
themselves in Haran.

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:49.760
And it says that Terah was 205 years old.

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:53.920
Now hold your thought, there is 205, right?

00:15:53.920 --> 00:16:00.600
So in chapter number 12, this will be the focus of our study next week in our next lesson,

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:06.640
but if you look in verse number 4, the Bible says, so Abram departed as the Lord had spoken

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:12.560
unto him, and Lot went with him, and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:15.300
out of Haran.

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:23.880
So therefore, if Abram was 75 when he left Haran, and Terah was 70 when Abram was born,

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:28.240
then how old was Terah when Abram left?

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:32.160
It would be 145, right, does that add up?

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:39.720
75 when he left to go to Haran, and his dad was 70 when he was born, 70 and 75, 145, amen,

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:41.000
I do the math right?

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000
They say you should never do math publicly, you can embarrass yourself.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:50.440
So I did it privately in my office before I said it publicly in this setting.

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:58.600
However, you notice that Terah died in Haran, he wasn't 145, he was 205.

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:01.360
So that's a difference of 60 years.

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:09.280
So it is possible, from the perspective of some that would take the position, that Abram

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:15.560
and Nahor in Haran were triplets, that Abram left and his dad Terah was alive in Haran

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:17.480
when he left to go to Canaan.

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:20.560
However, go over to Acts chapter number 7.

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:25.280
Notice what is said here in Acts chapter number 7, and I'm really sharing this with you not

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:31.080
to say that my position or my interpretation is right, versus what somebody else might

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:32.080
say.

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:37.160
Really, the idea of why I'm trying to share this with you is because we need to study

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:39.600
the Bible, amen?

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:43.960
And we dig into the Word of God, and we don't just take what some commentary says or what

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:46.640
some scholar says.

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:49.440
Let's dig into the Word of God and let's see what God's Word says.

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:54.320
In Acts chapter number 7, Stephen is going to preach a message.

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:58.080
And at the end of Acts chapter number 7, Stephen is going to be stoned because of the message

00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:59.080
he preached.

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:03.720
I'm happy I've not been stoned yet for any messages that I've preached, amen?

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:09.880
But we find that here as he begins the message, notice in verse number 2, and he said,

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:14.160
Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken.

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:18.120
The God of glory appeared unto who?

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:20.420
Our father Abraham.

00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:25.160
So now we're going to once again see why the significance of the Scriptures in Genesis

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:32.800
11 zoom in on Abram, who will become Abraham because of the lineage of Christ, the Messianic

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:33.800
line.

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:40.760
So we find that it says, When he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran, Mesopotamia, that

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:45.040
would be the Ur of the Chaldeans, that's where he was, before he would go to Haran, follow

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:50.600
verse 3, and said unto him, Get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred, and come

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:53.760
into the land which I shall show thee.

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:59.960
Then came he out of the land of the Chaldeans and dwelt in Haran.

00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:02.700
And from thence, what does it say?

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:13.780
When his father was dead, he removed him into this land wherein ye now dwell.

00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:21.140
So it says in Acts 7, as Stephen is preaching this message, that Abraham didn't go to the

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:27.860
land in which you now dwell, speaking of Canaan, that would be what he's speaking of, until

00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:31.100
the death of his father.

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:33.179
So when did his dad die?

00:19:33.179 --> 00:19:39.220
According to Genesis 11, he died when he was 205 years old, right?

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:44.360
Genesis 11, in verse number 32, if that's the right verse, let me just get there quickly,

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:48.860
in verse number 32, In the days of Terah were 205 years, and Terah died, where?

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:50.619
In Haran.

00:19:50.619 --> 00:19:57.300
And so if he was 205 years old when he died in Haran, and Abraham is 75, according to

00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:00.100
Genesis 12, in verse number 4, when he left...

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:01.800
from Haran to go to Canaan,

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:03.300
then that would mean that Terah

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:07.140
was 130 years old when Abraham was born.

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:10.640
Now, I'm not trying to cause any confusion.

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:12.440
I'm just trying to help us understand

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:14.900
how awesome this book is.

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:16.680
And how you dig into the Word of God

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:18.760
and you study it and you see the references

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:20.020
and you go back and forth.

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:21.560
Some scholar might come and say,

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:23.480
well, we did this, that, and the other,

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:25.560
and this is the deal, and so on and so forth.

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:28.120
But we find here that the Scriptures

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:31.960
are quite clear as Stephen is preaching.

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:34.680
And by the way, it was not that Stephen was preaching

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:36.360
and it was just his thoughts.

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:38.460
He's preaching and it's recorded in Scripture

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:41.960
and all Scripture is given by inspiration of God.

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:44.760
And so we find here that if that,

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:47.020
as we look at this passage and we see

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:49.200
as we compare Scripture with Scripture,

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.440
then we would not have the approach

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:54.160
or the interpretation that Abraham, Nahor, and Haran

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:57.580
were triplets, but rather that Abraham was born

00:20:57.620 --> 00:20:59.820
when Terah was 130 years old,

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:01.860
and that would make Abram's birth

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:05.580
at 352 years after the flood.

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:08.020
Now, I say all of that to say this.

00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:11.660
At the end of Genesis 9, the Bible tells us

00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:15.060
that Noah lived after the flood 350 years

00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:17.260
in verse number 28.

00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:20.820
And so we find that the proximity in time

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:24.520
between the death of Noah and the birth of Abraham

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:27.100
is super close, just a couple of years.

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:29.660
As you take and you add all of those years up,

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:33.460
and we find that, again, the focus of Scripture,

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:37.840
we read nothing of the last 350 years of Noah's life.

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:41.260
But we'll begin to zoom in here in Genesis chapter 11

00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:45.140
and focus upon Abraham and his descendants

00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:49.100
and we see how that eventually we will get to the place

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:52.140
in which we are dealing with the truth

00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:56.780
of the Messianic line and its prominence in Scripture.

00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:57.620
Why?

00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:02.100
Because Jesus is the main theme of the Bible, right?

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:04.420
It's about the Messiah.

00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:07.940
Someone said this, William Scroggie wrote a book

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:10.620
many years ago, a scholar of yesteryear,

00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:14.100
and he titled his book The Unfolding Drama of Redemption.

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:17.020
And it is a very lengthy book, but it is a very good book

00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:20.540
and very insightful into his approach

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:22.280
as he would look at the Scriptures

00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:25.380
and how the Old Testament is leading to

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:28.620
and prophesying with regard to the coming of the Messiah

00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:31.220
and looking at all of those wonderful prophecies.

00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:34.860
And indeed, Jesus is the theme

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:38.420
and we find that redemption is the story.

00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:40.920
Now, as we focus in, we're going to get here,

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:42.820
we looked at the generations of Shem,

00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:44.100
the generations of Terah.

00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:48.460
Let's dig in and look here at an introduction to Abram.

00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:49.820
In verses 27 through 32,

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:51.980
we learn a lot of things about Abraham.

00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:53.740
I'm probably gonna use the word Abraham

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:55.900
more than I'll use Abram, bear with me.

00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:58.000
I know that his name hasn't changed yet,

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.440
but we so often refer to him as Abraham.

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:03.760
The Bible says this, notice several things that we learn.

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:05.260
Of course, number one, we learned

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:06.860
that he is the son of Terah.

00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:08.420
In verse number 27, the Bible says,

00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:10.300
now these are the generations of Terah.

00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:12.740
Terah begat Abram, Nahor and Haran.

00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:15.380
And notice it says that Haran begat Lot.

00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:19.680
So God gives us some insight here in Genesis chapter 11

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:22.860
to the fact that Abram would be the uncle to Lot.

00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:24.780
Now remember, that's gonna come back later, right?

00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:26.580
We're going to begin to read later on

00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:28.600
in the book of Genesis.

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:31.820
We'll read of the introductions and the interactions

00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:34.980
between Abraham and Lot, and of course, Sodom and Gomorrah,

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:36.900
and all of those things that unfold.

00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:39.660
And we're given the truth here

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:42.120
as we have this introduction to Abram,

00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:44.180
that he is the uncle to Lot.

00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:47.380
We notice, as we continue to read in verse number 28,

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:50.140
the Bible says that Haran died before his father, Terah,

00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:55.020
in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:59.740
And so before they left Ur of the Chaldees, Haran died.

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:06.060
It's interesting as we find here in verse number 28,

00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:10.180
as we begin to get, again, more introduction to Abram

00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:12.080
and learn more about his life,

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:14.780
that he is from the Ur of the Chaldees.

00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:17.540
Of course, we found that Stephen

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:19.620
would reference about Mesopotamia.

00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:21.780
It's interesting as you think about the Ur of the Chaldees

00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:25.620
and really just some of the things about this place.

00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:28.700
It was a very interesting location,

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:31.340
very important place within the Babylonian kingdom,

00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:35.260
if you will, not quite as the Babylonian kingdom yet,

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:38.700
but we find that it was really

00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:41.460
at the mouth of the Euphrates River.

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:43.780
And so obviously, in a strategic location,

00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:46.220
they would gather there for that reason

00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:49.960
because of the life that would be able to be produced

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:53.100
and kept alive because of water and so on and so forth.

00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:54.780
And so you find that they're at the mouth

00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:56.700
of the Euphrates River.

00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:58.020
The Ur of the Chaldees, Ur,

00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:01.560
it was known as being a very wealthy place.

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:06.560
It was known as being a very sophisticated society.

00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:09.800
In fact, there have been excavations

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:12.740
that have taken place over the years

00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:15.540
and have revealed a great library

00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:18.580
with thousands of clay tablets.

00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:23.580
And so you can see about how advanced this society was

00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:26.540
in the Ur of the Chaldees that they were sophisticated.

00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:27.580
It was a large city.

00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:29.300
There were a lot of people there.

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:31.140
And there are many that would attack the Bible,

00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:33.260
of course, again, to deal with the attacks

00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:34.760
I mentioned by way of introduction

00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:37.780
that really the first 11 chapters of the book of Genesis

00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:39.620
are under regular attack.

00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:43.780
And there are many that would attack the genealogies

00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:46.100
and the birth rates and the fact

00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:48.740
that they couldn't have many people.

00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:52.540
But the reality is that God blessed them and God multiplied.

00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:56.700
God told them be fruitful and multiply and God blessed.

00:25:56.700 --> 00:26:01.500
And we see that the society was a populated society.

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:03.580
And even there in the Ur of the Chaldees,

00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:05.900
I mean, you think if they were able to do excavation

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:08.720
and reveal thousands of clay tablets,

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:11.360
I mean, this was a sophisticated place.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.280
We find that it was a place

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:17.960
in which they worshiped the moon God.

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:19.400
It was a place of idolatry.

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:22.560
Notice, hold your place here in Genesis

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:24.680
in front of the book of Joshua in chapter number 24,

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:27.560
if you will, I want you to notice what Joshua says

00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:31.880
to the people in his closing challenge.

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:36.480
During this pandemic, we spent 52 lessons,

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:38.600
I think it was, studying through the book of Genesis.

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:41.280
Through the book of Joshua, is that what it was?

00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:43.800
52 lessons, I think is what it was.

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:46.920
We had Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday lessons

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:48.400
through the book of Joshua.

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:50.360
And I believe we ended at 52 lessons.

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:52.840
And one of those last couple of lessons dealt

00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:56.380
with the message that Joshua delivered to the people.

00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:59.160
Notice in Joshua 24 in verse one, it says,

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:01.600
"'Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:04.060
"'and called for the elders of Israel and for their heads

00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:06.100
"'and for their judges and for their officers.

00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:08.980
"'And they presented themselves before God.'"

00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:10.400
Notice verse two.

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:12.640
"'And Joshua said unto all the people,

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:14.280
"'Thus saith the Lord God of Israel,

00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:16.240
"'your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:19.220
"'in old time, even Terah, the father of Abraham

00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:24.220
"'and the father of Nacor, and they served other gods.'"

00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:28.060
We see that as we look in Genesis chapter 11,

00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:31.140
that reference specifically isn't given to us

00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:33.900
as we study history and other folks,

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:37.140
Josephus and others that have given us historical records

00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:39.880
of these folks here in the Ur of the Chaldees,

00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:43.460
we would understand that one of their highest deities,

00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:45.740
if you will, their greatest idols was the fact

00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:47.380
that they worshiped the moon god.

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:52.440
Notice as we continue learning more about Abraham,

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:54.140
the Bible tells us in verse number 29,

00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:57.260
"'And Abram and Nahor took them wives.

00:27:57.260 --> 00:28:00.060
"'The name of Abram's wife was Sarai.'"

00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:02.420
Of course, her name will become Sarah.

00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:04.780
The Bible says, "'The name of Nahor's wife, Milcah,

00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:06.700
"'the daughter of Haram, the father of Milcah,

00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:08.460
"'and the father of Iscah.'"

00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:11.460
And there's given insight to us there in verse number 29.

00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:14.000
It's interesting, not much information

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.380
immediately is given here.

00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:19.220
Again, the main emphasis is a trace that of Abram,

00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:22.860
but we will see how that this will come back

00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:26.300
in later chapters over in chapter 20 and 22

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:30.200
with regard to the descendants of these relatives as well.

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:32.200
Notice an important truth that is given.

00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:34.880
We say we know this truth because we're familiar

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:36.560
with what takes place through the book of Genesis,

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:38.160
but you notice in verse 30, the Bible says,

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:42.720
"'But Sarai was barren, she had no child.'"

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:44.480
That will become a significant truth

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:47.160
throughout the next several chapters

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:49.800
of the book of Genesis, will it not?

00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:52.700
We find that here, again, by way of introduction

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:56.000
into this man, Abram's life, we are told

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.280
that he has a wife named Sarai, but she is barren,

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:00.960
she has no children.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:05.680
Of course, we know that God miraculously provides, amen,

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:09.500
after a period of not having children

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:11.920
and of course, hearing the promise,

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:14.880
Sarah decides that Abram should go,

00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:18.520
Abraham should go with Hagar and Ishmael is born,

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:20.040
but that was not God's plan.

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:25.060
God said, I'm gonna give you a son, Abraham and Sarah.

00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:27.980
And of course, we read in future chapters

00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:30.000
about the wonderful birth of Isaac.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:35.000
What a blessing, what a great truth of the Word of God.

00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:38.720
And we find that as we study through the pages of Scripture

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:41.760
and we find these truths and we understand

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:46.240
that Sarah in chapter 19, excuse me, chapter 18,

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:48.520
as she would laugh at what she heard

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:52.280
and we find that we eventually get to that place

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:54.800
where Isaac is born and then of course,

00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:57.920
God would tell him to offer Isaac

00:29:57.920 --> 00:29:59.480
and you go through all of those things

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:00.800
and you see how.

00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:05.280
that here in chapter number 12, again, the focus, chapter 11, excuse me,

00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:07.760
the focus is coming in on to Abram

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:12.280
and how these simple truths that are given quickly,

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:15.440
how that they're so impactful to the next events

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:18.760
that we that we will study through the book of Genesis.

00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:20.040
Verse number 31.

00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:24.320
And Tara took Abram, his son, and Lot, the son of Haran, his son's son.

00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:26.440
So his grandson.

00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:29.840
And Sarai, his daughter in law and his son, Abram's wife.

00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:32.120
Notice this in verse 31.

00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:36.240
And they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:38.120
to go into the land of Canaan.

00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:41.880
And they came to Haran and dwelt there.

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:46.080
It's interesting if you were to take and understand

00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:49.760
the geography of what's taking place on this journey.

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:54.840
The truth of the matter is that from the Ur of the Chaldees to get to Canaan,

00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:57.920
it would simply be a message such as this.

00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:00.320
Go west, young man, go west.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.240
I mean, simply. Right.

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:04.240
It's almost due west.

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:06.040
But there is a problem.

00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:08.480
What's due west is the Arabian desert.

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:12.520
Not a very easy trek to travel.

00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:15.880
And of course, with the animals and all that they would do,

00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:19.320
all they would take with them, it become extremely difficult.

00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:21.040
And so we find that what they did.

00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:25.720
Remember, we mentioned that Ur of the Chaldees is at the mouth of the Euphrates

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:29.840
River, and so primarily their track on their travels

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:34.280
took them northwesterly as they would go towards

00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:37.880
and follow really trace the Euphrates River.

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:39.600
And of course, we know this.

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:44.080
And of course, as you study geography historically now with,

00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:46.960
you know, irrigation and so many things that have happened

00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:50.600
throughout the centuries and of course, irrigation is not necessarily new,

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:53.840
but we find so many things that have happened over the centuries.

00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:56.920
But in this particular time period, you need to be close to water.

00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:01.480
Water is is is certainly necessary for life.

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:04.440
And we understand that God designed things that way.

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:07.280
And so we find that they would trace, if you will,

00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:11.280
that route and travel northwesterly

00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:15.440
along the Euphrates River and they would come to Iran.

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:17.360
You see that in verse number thirty one.

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:19.480
It says that they were to go from the Ur of the Chaldees

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:24.000
to go into the land of Canaan, and they came onto Iran and dwelt there.

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:28.240
Many people have questions with regard to why it was that they dwelt there.

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:32.360
There is a potential reason given to us in verse thirty two,

00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:34.880
and it says that the days of Tara were two hundred and five years

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:36.960
and Tara died in Iran.

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:40.800
It would seem that perhaps his health was not good enough

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:44.680
to continue on the journey because now they have

00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:47.680
essentially they've made a triangle, right?

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:49.560
They've left Ur of the Chaldees.

00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:52.600
They've traveled northwesterly and they're up here in Iran.

00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:55.800
But then they got to travel southwesterly to get down to Canaan.

00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:59.880
And so instead of being able to travel across the Arabian Desert,

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:04.280
which would have proven to be very difficult, we find they take that path

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:08.920
and they come to Iran and we find that Tara, Abram's father

00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:11.880
would die in Iran.

00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:13.280
We come into chapter number twelve.

00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:16.840
We'll study it next week and we'll deal with how God then speaks to him again,

00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:20.480
to Abraham again with regard to leaving and so on and so forth.

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:24.560
And we find that as we come to the close of chapter eleven,

00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:26.800
I want you to think about the significant events

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:29.280
that God has covered in eleven chapters.

00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:32.120
I want you to think about the fact that he covered

00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:34.520
all of the truth with regard to creation.

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:40.760
Right. We find that not only did he provide for us the the truth of creation

00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:45.560
without how he made all that he made and how he spoke it into existence.

00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:51.160
And one of my favorite statements throughout studying the truth of creation

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:56.040
is how that we look at the stars and their vast numbers

00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:58.440
and we stand in amazement.

00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:03.560
And yet the scriptures simply say he made the stars also.

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:06.800
It's amazing.

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:10.400
We stand in awe of his creation.

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:14.800
Of course, the crowning moment of his creation is in day six

00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:16.160
when he created man.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.800
We read the latter part of Genesis one and we read Genesis chapter number two

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:23.720
and we see about his interactions with man

00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:25.920
and where he put man in the garden,

00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:28.960
the responsibility that was given and so on and so forth.

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:31.280
And we come to the end of chapter number two

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:36.440
and we read specifically how God said that it wasn't good for man to be alone.

00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:41.360
And he speaks about the way in which he brought Eve to him, Adam.

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:45.840
And then we read of the tragedy in chapter number three.

00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:49.040
Sin entered into the world.

00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:53.920
The serpent comes in great subtlety.

00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:59.480
Yea, hath God said, you shall not surely die.

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:02.920
We see that sin entered into the world.

00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:09.280
Of course, the judgment is announced as God goes into the into the garden

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:12.360
and Adam and Eve are hiding themselves.

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:15.360
He calls for them.

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:21.160
We find that he provides that covering of skin.

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:25.200
The sacrifice that would be made.

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:30.960
We see the passage continue and begin to read about the beginning of civilization

00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:33.960
in chapter four, and we read of that first murder

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:37.920
and the situation with Cain and Abel and all that takes place.

00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:41.320
And you go through and eventually you get to chapter number six

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:44.560
and you see how that civilization has marched forward

00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:47.360
and the population has grown immensely.

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:51.240
And you come to the place where God says that he sees the wickedness

00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:57.200
of his creation of mankind and that he's going to destroy him.

00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:02.280
And it's amazing in chapter number six, how that you read the last statement

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:06.840
of verse number 13, where God says to Noah, I will destroy them with the earth.

00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:10.320
And you read the first statement in verse number 14, where he says,

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:15.480
make me an ark of gopher wood, how that God would provide refuge

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:18.600
even through that judgment.

00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:24.680
But safety was only in one place, was in the ark, was in the ark.

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:28.880
Noah faithfully followed the direction of God.

00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:30.760
Noah faithfully preached.

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:33.440
He was a preacher of righteousness, according to the New Testament.

00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:36.760
And we find that he faithfully preached the word of God.

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:40.560
No one listened.

00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:44.480
Noah, his wife, his three sons and their wives

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.960
were the only human beings to enter that ark.

00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:52.160
The Bible tells us that God shut them in.

00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:54.320
And they were safe in the ark.

00:36:55.520 --> 00:37:01.680
We made the connection, the New Testament truth that we are in Christ.

00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:06.640
And what a blessing to know that as people that have been born again,

00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:09.200
save that we are in Christ saints.

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:15.080
What a joy, what a blessing to understand that he is our refuge.

00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:21.560
We read of the flood and we read of how God caused the great wind to pass

00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:25.720
and the waters to assuage, and we read how that God gave the instruction

00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:29.160
for them to come off of the ark.

00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:34.360
And they did and they worshiped, they gave offerings and sacrificed.

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:38.240
He built an altar unto the Lord and offered burnt offerings on the altar,

00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:40.640
according to chapter eight and verse 20.

00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:43.000
We read of the Noahic covenant.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:47.120
We read of these descendants and generations,

00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:52.520
and we read of the Tower of Babel, and now we come to the life of Abraham.

00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:57.960
And it's amazing that in 11 chapters, all of that information could be given.

00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:02.080
And we know, as I mentioned often, as we studied those chapters

00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:06.360
and studied about creation, that God knows exactly how he created everything.

00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:11.160
And he could have given us volumes upon volumes of great detail

00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:13.320
with every single thing that he did.

00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:17.920
In the beginning, God created, right?

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:20.280
I mean, it just he made the stars also.

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:22.240
Well, I want to dig into that. How did he do that?

00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:25.280
What did he do? How did he just he made the stars also?

00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:31.520
And we find that as we are mindful of the truth of God's Word,

00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:36.480
that the crowning moment of creation, as I mentioned in Genesis,

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:39.680
is the creation of mankind.

00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:43.920
And from that point forward, especially as you look at the truth of Genesis 3

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:49.040
with the fall of man, the theme of the Bible becomes redemption of his creation.

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:54.800
And we find that as God would send forth his Son, the Messiah,

00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:57.200
he would come through a promised line.

00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:01.640
And therefore, we focus in upon Abram, Abraham.

00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:04.320
What was it that Stephen said in that message?

00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:08.120
As he begins to speak to those Jewish leaders

00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:12.600
that had questioned all that was going on, he says to them in the very beginning,

00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:16.480
men, he says, men, brethren and fathers, hearken.

00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:20.800
The God of glory appeared unto our father, Abraham.

00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:23.520
We mentioned even as we've studied the book of Hebrews,

00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:26.320
how that Christ is better than Abraham, right?

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:27.840
He's superior to than Abraham.

00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:33.840
In fact, he said in John, before Abraham was, I am.

00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:36.600
Amen. In John 8 and 58.

00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:39.720
And we find that as you look in the book of Hebrews

00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:44.160
and we've mentioned Christ is better, he's superior than the angels,

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:46.640
the prophets, than Moses, than Abraham.

00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:51.040
The Jewish people held Abraham, continue to hold Abraham in very high regard.

00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:52.280
And rightly so.

00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:57.360
And so we find that the scriptures take these 11 chapters

00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:00.080
to give us exactly what God wants us to have.

00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:02.380
to go through all of these things that are taking place,

00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:03.820
all of these other descendants,

00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:05.140
all of these other people groups,

00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:08.340
and focus specifically upon Abram

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:10.340
and upon his descendants.

00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:11.260
Why?

00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:12.460
Because of the lineage,

00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:17.460
because of the truth of the Messiah that would come.

00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:20.500
And I'm so thankful that from this point forward,

00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:23.980
as we begin to, or continue to study

00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:25.120
through the book of Genesis

00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:27.020
and really get the whole of scripture

00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:29.180
and see how the descendants of Abraham

00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:30.660
come in full focus

00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:34.880
and how that it leads us to the wonderful truths

00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:37.620
that God has given us with regard

00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:41.780
to the seed of Abraham, Galatians.

00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:45.800
He didn't say seeds, as in many,

00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:47.460
he said seed, right?

00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:49.100
Speaking of Christ.

00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:50.340
And what a wonderful blessing.

00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:53.100
The book of Genesis is so important.

00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:55.520
It's under continued scrutiny.

00:40:56.460 --> 00:40:58.980
In fact, I read an article on Friday

00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:00.460
where they've decided again

00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:02.340
that they've recalculated and determined

00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:04.780
the actual age of the earth.

00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:09.060
The problem was there are two groups of people

00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:10.020
that were doing the study

00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:11.300
and they came up with numbers

00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:16.300
that were about almost a full billion years apart.

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:19.620
I said a billion years is kind of a long time.

00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:21.860
But I guess when you're talking about 15 billion

00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:25.380
or 14 billion, it really kind of, you know, whatever.

00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:28.220
But the reality is that we have a record

00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:30.140
that is trustworthy.

00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:31.580
And God has given us His word

00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:34.540
and His word is powerful, it's helpful,

00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:35.500
it's profitable, right?

00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:37.580
That's what the word of God says of itself.

00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:38.740
And so as we study the word of God

00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:40.540
and we see here this evening,

00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:45.380
yes, the generations of Shem, the generations of Terah,

00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:47.660
we get this introduction to Abram

00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:52.660
and we find in full focus this Father Abraham

00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:55.560
as he's often referred to as,

00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:58.240
where Messiah will come from that line.

00:41:58.240 --> 00:41:59.080
Let's pray.

00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:01.580
Father, we love You, we thank You for loving us.

00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:04.540
Thank You for the opportunity tonight to study Thy word.

00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:08.120
Certainly a little different type of a passage

00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:12.280
and different type of message tonight.

00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:16.680
I pray that it's been helpful to strengthen our faith,

00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:20.440
to help us to understand that Your word is trustworthy,

00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:22.320
to help us to understand this evening

00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:24.400
that as we go through the Scriptures

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:26.280
and we compare Scripture with Scripture

00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:28.080
and we study Thy word,

00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:33.080
that we can be able to stand upon the truth of Your word,

00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:38.400
that we do not have to be easily persuaded

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:40.960
by those within our society

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:44.840
that would constantly seek to attack Thy word

00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:48.700
and especially these first 11 chapters of Genesis

00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:50.920
which are so foundational.

00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:52.300
I pray, God, that You'd help us

00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:56.660
to have our faith strengthened.

00:42:56.660 --> 00:42:59.260
I pray that as we watch this video here

00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:00.940
in just a few moments,

00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:02.780
help us to be challenged by the work

00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:05.060
that's taking place in Greenland

00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:08.460
and the opportunity to participate

00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:11.860
in what You're doing on that field.

00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:13.640
As we have a time of invitation,

00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:15.460
we pray that You'd work in hearts and lives

00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:16.420
and we'll thank You for it.

00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:17.860
In Christ's name we pray.

00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:18.940
Would You stand with me?

00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:20.180
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:21.980
We will have a moment of invitation.
