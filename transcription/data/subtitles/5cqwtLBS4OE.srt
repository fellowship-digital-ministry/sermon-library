1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
verse of Scripture this morning, 2 Corinthians 5 and verse number 9, and I'll give you a moment

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:11,119
to turn there, 2 Corinthians 5 and verse number 9 this morning. Notice the Bible says this,

3
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:22,079
Wherefore we labor, that whether present or absent we may be accepted of him. Paul just concluded,

4
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:28,319
as we studied last week, these first eight verses of chapter number 5, he concluded the section

5
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:34,000
dealing with the certainty of heaven and the reality that all the redeemed will be with our

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,040
wonderful Savior for all of eternity. What a glorious truth. Amen. What a glorious truth

7
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:47,759
that God has given to us in his word so that we could have the confidence and the certainty

8
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:55,119
that when this life is over, when I take my final breath here, that I can be, I can know that I'll

9
00:00:55,119 --> 00:01:01,599
be in his presence and I will forever be with him. We talked about last week the expectation

10
00:01:01,599 --> 00:01:07,519
of every believer. If you've been saved by the grace of God this morning, your expectation is

11
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:13,360
heaven. You have that confidence. As he says in verse number 8, we are confident, I say,

12
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,800
and willing rather to be absent from the body than to be present with the Lord. And we have

13
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:25,519
that expectation. But I said this as we concluded the message last week, that not only do we have

14
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:31,760
the expectation, but we think about the excitement that should cause, that the expectation should

15
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:37,680
cause us to have great excitement. Why? Because I'm going to be with Jesus. And so many people,

16
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,319
as I mentioned last week, they want to talk about heaven and what is heaven like and so on and so

17
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:47,519
forth. And there are many things that God tells us in his word with regard to describing heaven.

18
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:53,279
But I want you to understand this morning that heaven is only heaven because our Savior is there.

19
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:59,519
If you take all of the descriptive terms, all of the wonderful things, but if Jesus is not there,

20
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:06,000
then it's not really heaven. And the amazing truth is that we find in this section of 2 Corinthians

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,839
5, verses 1 through 8, that Paul, he ended the fourth chapter talking about having that

22
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:19,600
eternal perspective and immediately goes to heaven and thinking about what our future is.

23
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:25,039
I said this last week, on our worst day, in our worst circumstance, we're still going to heaven.

24
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:30,880
If you're saved this morning, if you've been saved by the blood of Christ and you

25
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:36,399
have placed your faith and trust in the finished work of Christ at Calvary, His death,

26
00:02:36,399 --> 00:02:42,000
burial, and glorious resurrection on your worst day, on my worst day, no matter what happens,

27
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,679
no matter who says or does whatever it is, I'm going to heaven. I'm going to heaven.

28
00:02:48,399 --> 00:02:54,160
And what a blessed truth that is. Verse 9 begins in our text this morning,

29
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,199
wherefore, for which cause, on account of, that's what it means, wherefore,

30
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:06,160
based upon what has just been revealed, this is the response of the apostle Paul when he talks

31
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:12,000
about heaven, when he talks about the certainty and the confidence that he has that when he

32
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,520
finishes his life, when he takes that final breath that he'll forever be with his Lord,

33
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:26,399
he says, wherefore, wherefore, I'm saved. I'm saved. I have a secure future.

34
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,880
But notice he says, wherefore, we labor. We labor. What are we laboring for? Notice that whether

35
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:45,360
present or absent, we may be accepted of him. He says, my future is certain. My future is secure.

36
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:51,119
It got settled a long time ago when I was on the road to Damascus for the apostle Paul. His name

37
00:03:51,119 --> 00:03:55,520
was Saul at the time, but it was settled. We sing the song. It's not in our songbook. And well,

38
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,839
I think we had a group of guys sing at one time, and it's a song that I remember singing when I

39
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:05,520
was younger. The old account was settled long ago. And if you get a good base in there, they say,

40
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:12,639
down on my knees, long ago, it was settled long ago. And certainly I remember that song as we

41
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:20,079
were singing it at an old mission, a rescue mission in downtown Los Angeles. I mean, a place where

42
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:26,000
some of these people, I mean, just terrible sets of circumstances, and they'd been saved by the

43
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,119
grace of God, and they came. And I'm telling you what, you had a worship service with those folks,

44
00:04:31,119 --> 00:04:35,760
and you got up in there, and you're preaching, and they're worshiping the Lord. And I remember

45
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:41,359
listening to those old group of guys sing, the old account was settled. Listen, it was settled for

46
00:04:41,359 --> 00:04:47,760
Paul. He knew where he was going. He knew that heaven was his home. It's secure. It's certain.

47
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:56,079
But he says this, I'm striving to please Him. I'm laboring. I'm striving to please Him. I'm not

48
00:04:56,079 --> 00:05:02,559
striving to please Him so that I can be saved. I'm not striving to please Him so that I can stay

49
00:05:02,559 --> 00:05:12,959
saved. No, I'm striving to please Him because I'm saved. The scriptures are clear. Your behavior and

50
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:21,679
my behavior matters to God. How we live matters to God. The matter of salvation is settled at the

51
00:05:21,679 --> 00:05:28,000
cross, and I'm so thankful for that. But then how we behave, listen, our beliefs should impact our

52
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,440
behavior. And what Paul believed to be true as he writes to these believers in Corinth in this

53
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:41,760
fifth chapter, those eight verses about heaven, he then says, wherefore we labor, that

54
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:46,640
whether present or absent, we may be accepted of Him. I've simply titled the message this morning,

55
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:52,880
striving to please my Savior, striving to please my Savior. Let me share with you the first

56
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,720
thought this morning. Point number one, if you're taking notes, the desire of Paul. We're going to

57
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,519
look at this verse really in reverse order this morning because we see the desire at the end of

58
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:09,359
the verse. Notice what it says, we may be accepted of Him. Now, it's important that we understand

59
00:06:09,359 --> 00:06:14,559
this word accepted. It means to be well-pleasing. It means that God would look at your life and look

60
00:06:14,559 --> 00:06:22,640
at my life and it would be well-pleasing in the sight of God. And Paul says that his desire

61
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:28,399
is that he, that we, because he's speaking to this church at Corinth, to these believers, that he's

62
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:34,959
already said to them, for we know, we have this expectation, we have this certainty of heaven, but

63
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:40,799
then he says we. He's including these believers. And for us this morning, that we would say

64
00:06:40,799 --> 00:06:47,200
collectively as Fellowship Baptist Church, that we should have the desire that we would be accepted

65
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:53,760
of Him, that we would be well-pleasing in the sight of God. We find that as you look at the life of

66
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:59,279
the Apostle Paul, I believe that his desire was a sincere one. I believe that as you look through

67
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:05,760
his life and you trace his steps, that he earnestly desired that his life would please

68
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:11,040
his Lord. He knew that he was going to heaven, that was settled, that was certain, but he wanted to

69
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:16,480
live in such a way that he would please God. I believe that Paul understood and faithfully

70
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:22,079
communicated with those that he ministered to that there was behavior that was pleasing to God,

71
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:28,720
and there's behavior that's not pleasing to God. In fact, Paul wrote to this same group of believers

72
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:34,399
in Corinth back in 1 Corinthians chapter number 10, and as he spoke of those of old, referring to

73
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:40,480
those in the Old Testament, he mentions to the church in Corinth that with many of them,

74
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:51,279
God was not well-pleased. He goes forth and he provides several examples as to why their behavior

75
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:58,480
did not please their God, and we find this morning that the Apostle Paul, he had this personal desire,

76
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:03,760
but not only did he have a personal desire, he desired that those to whom God allowed him to

77
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:10,160
minister, that they too would please God, that they too would have that desire, that they would be

78
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:16,079
accepted of him. We find that next week as we move forward into the text of Scripture, beginning in

79
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:21,279
verse number 10, what does Paul begin to talk about? He talks about the judgment seat of Christ, that we

80
00:08:21,359 --> 00:08:28,799
must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, and so understanding the certainty of heaven,

81
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:33,359
understanding the certainty of the judgment seat of Christ, tucked in between those two

82
00:08:33,359 --> 00:08:43,119
realities, he says, here's what I do. I labor to please God. I am striving to please my Savior.

83
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:50,080
This desire that he has to be accepted of the Lord. Notice with me, if you will, over in Philippians

84
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:55,919
chapter number three, we'll look at a number of verses this morning in order to lay down and to

85
00:08:55,919 --> 00:09:02,400
prove the truth of what we see in Paul sharing with these believers in Corinth and with us this

86
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:08,479
morning, this desire to please the Lord. In Philippians chapter number three, we find that Paul

87
00:09:08,479 --> 00:09:14,239
begins, and we'll just pick it up in verse number 10 and go down through verse number 14, and notice

88
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:20,960
what he says in beginning in verse number 10, that I may know Him, that I may know Him. How well do

89
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:28,320
you know God? How well do you know Him? Think about that. Paul is right in this church in Philippi.

90
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:35,119
Paul had been walking with God for a long time, but he says that I may know Him. I don't want to

91
00:09:35,119 --> 00:09:43,280
just know about God. I want to know Him personally and intimately. I want to know Him.

92
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:52,159
And he says that I may know Him, and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His

93
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:59,760
sufferings being made conformable unto His death, if by any means, notice what he says, I might

94
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,300
not as though I had already attained,

95
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,560
either were already perfect,

96
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,300
but I follow after,

97
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:10,260
if that I may apprehend that

98
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:14,940
for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus."

99
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,740
This is Paul's desire.

100
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,740
What is he trying?

101
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,400
What is he seeking to apprehend?

102
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,240
What is he seeking?

103
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,080
What's the goal of his life?

104
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,240
He says in verse 13,

105
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:27,080
brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended

106
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:30,420
brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended,

107
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,880
but this one thing I do,

108
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,000
forgetting those things which are behind,

109
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,720
and notice, reaching forth unto those things

110
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,800
which are before.

111
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,600
I press, I press toward the mark

112
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,980
for the prize of the high calling of God

113
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,200
in Christ Jesus.

114
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,180
Well, this morning we see this language

115
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,360
that Paul uses as he's writing to the church

116
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,340
in Philippi and he's expressing his own personal desire.

117
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:02,040
I'm desiring to know Him

118
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,220
and I'm desiring to please Him

119
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,380
and I'm pressing toward the mark

120
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,880
for the prize of the high calling of God

121
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,020
in Christ Jesus,

122
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:13,620
ultimately so that Christ alone would receive the glory,

123
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,140
but we find that Paul recognized

124
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,600
that this is his desire,

125
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,900
through all that he would do through his life,

126
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,400
that he would please God.

127
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:30,260
The book of 1 Thessalonians in chapter number four,

128
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:33,340
Paul, this is where we read of Paul

129
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,300
having this desire for others,

130
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,400
yes, for himself,

131
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,060
but we find in 1 Thessalonians chapter number four,

132
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,420
he's writing to this church in Thessalonica

133
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,300
and notice what he says to them

134
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,160
as he's commending them and encouraging them

135
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,280
and he's instructing them throughout this letter,

136
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,020
but he says in verse number one

137
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,140
of 1 Thessalonians chapter four,

138
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,520
furthermore then we beseech you,

139
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,320
I mean the language of this I beseech you,

140
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,200
this begging, this earnest pleading

141
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,580
with these believers in Thessalonica,

142
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,280
not only does he say we beseech you,

143
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:09,440
but then he says and exhort you by the Lord Jesus,

144
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,880
notice that as ye have received of us

145
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:17,880
how ye ought to walk and to please God,

146
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:23,280
so you would abound more and more.

147
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:29,060
Paul knew he was gonna stand before God personally,

148
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:32,180
but Paul knew that every person

149
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,180
that trusted Christ as their savior,

150
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:38,900
that they too would stand before God personally.

151
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,020
He says in the book of Colossians in the first chapter

152
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,340
that he's warning them,

153
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,820
that he might present them perfect

154
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,740
before the Lord being complete

155
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,360
and here as he's writing to these believers in Thessalonica,

156
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,800
he says that you would walk in a such a way

157
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,860
that you would please God,

158
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,920
so you would abound more and more.

159
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,720
Notice he says for we know, for ye know

160
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:06,720
what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.

161
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,100
He says in verse three, for this is the will of God,

162
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:15,280
even your sanctification that you should abstain

163
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,300
from fornication, why?

164
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,660
Well, because fornication would not please God

165
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:24,500
and it's specifically laid out here in verse number three,

166
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,220
that every one of you in verse number four

167
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,000
should know how to possess his vessel

168
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,700
in sanctification and honor

169
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,660
and he begins to go through and he says in verse number seven

170
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,100
to kind of summarize all that he's saying here,

171
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:40,260
for God hath not caught us unto uncleanness,

172
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,180
but unto holiness.

173
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,880
Remember what God said in the book of Leviticus

174
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,360
and it's repeated by Peter in first Peter

175
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,160
that be holy, for I am holy.

176
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:57,000
God is holy and we as his people are to walk in holiness,

177
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,300
that we are not, God has not caught us unto uncleanness,

178
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,560
but unto holiness.

179
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,200
I'm reminded of what the truth of God's word is

180
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,360
with regard to the grace of God,

181
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,240
which bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,

182
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,820
teaching us that denying ungodliness,

183
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,860
not only that, but worldly lusts,

184
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:18,200
we should live soberly, righteously and godly

185
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,100
in this present world.

186
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:24,619
That's today, that's how I'm living my life today

187
00:14:24,619 --> 00:14:28,779
and what a blessing to know that God is concerned

188
00:14:28,779 --> 00:14:32,779
about my behavior and your behavior and we can please God

189
00:14:32,779 --> 00:14:35,339
and we ought to be striving to please God.

190
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,320
In 2 Timothy chapter two, Paul is writing,

191
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,080
we studied this book last year,

192
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,279
1 and 2 Timothy and he's writing in this second chapter

193
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:46,680
about a good soldier and what does it mean

194
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,680
to be a good soldier of Jesus Christ?

195
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,760
And I preached, I think for five weeks

196
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,920
from 2 Timothy chapter two last year

197
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,800
and we looked at various aspects

198
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,540
of what does it mean to be a good soldier?

199
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:00,540
I don't wanna just be a soldier, I wanna be a good soldier.

200
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,720
I don't wanna be content with just,

201
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,000
well, it's good enough, it's status quo,

202
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:09,580
no, I wanna be a good soldier of Jesus Christ.

203
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:12,619
He says in 2 Timothy one, thou therefore my son endure,

204
00:15:12,619 --> 00:15:15,140
be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus

205
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:17,960
and the things that thou hast heard of me.

206
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,700
Among many witnesses the same,

207
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,779
commit thou to faithful men who shall be able

208
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:23,040
to teach others also.

209
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,820
Thou therefore endure hardness

210
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:29,360
as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.

211
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,460
No man that woreth and tangleth himself

212
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,660
with the affairs of this life,

213
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:35,059
notice that he may please him

214
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:38,240
who hath chosen him to be a soldier.

215
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:44,420
One of this morning, where's our desire?

216
00:15:45,619 --> 00:15:50,420
Do we truly have a desire like Paul had,

217
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,839
that I wanna be accepted of him,

218
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:56,119
that I wanna please my savior?

219
00:15:56,119 --> 00:15:59,440
We find that there are several verses of scripture

220
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,480
that we could look to to understand this word,

221
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,500
accept it again, well pleasing in the sight of God.

222
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,240
Look at a few with me, Romans chapter number 12.

223
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,440
We're familiar with this text of scripture

224
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,300
and we find in Romans chapter 12

225
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,720
as Paul has given all such wonderful truth

226
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,000
throughout the book of Romans

227
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,760
and he comes to this 12th chapter and he says,

228
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:22,279
therefore I beseech you, therefore,

229
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:25,279
based on all of that which I've already shared with you,

230
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,360
all of the truth that has been revealed,

231
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,360
I beseech you, therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God.

232
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,000
Notice what he says, that you present your bodies

233
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,080
a living sacrifice, holy.

234
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:41,480
Notice what it says, acceptable unto God,

235
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:46,200
which is your reasonable service.

236
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,680
It's your reasonable service.

237
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,820
It is reasonable for God to have the expectation

238
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,600
that we would live our lives for his glory,

239
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,400
that we'd understand that as we have been saved

240
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,240
by the grace of God, we can't earn our salvation,

241
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,800
we can't keep our salvation, but now that I belong to Jesus,

242
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,960
that I would, as the songwriter said, live for Jesus.

243
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,559
Be not conformed to this world,

244
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:20,279
but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind

245
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:23,800
that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable

246
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,600
and perfect will of God.

247
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,839
We see in verse one, and again in verse number two

248
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:34,080
of Romans chapter 12, that word acceptable.

249
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,400
And Paul said there in 2 Corinthians 5 and verse number nine

250
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:43,400
that I might be accepted, that we may be accepted of him.

251
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:45,600
Well-pleasing in his sight.

252
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,820
Ephesians 5 and verse number 10 says it this way,

253
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,559
and it's a great verse of scripture.

254
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,640
In fact, I think it's a verse of scripture

255
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,000
that really should be a verse that is a filter

256
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,839
that we use for our daily activities,

257
00:17:57,839 --> 00:17:59,640
for the things that we do.

258
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:04,240
We should use Ephesians 5 and verse number 10 as a filter.

259
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,160
Why do I say that?

260
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,760
Well, notice what the Bible says

261
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,640
in Ephesians 5 and verse number 10.

262
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:14,640
Proving, proving what is acceptable unto who?

263
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,440
What's it say?

264
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,960
The Lord.

265
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,200
Not proving what's acceptable to my neighbor,

266
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,720
to my spouse, to my parent, to my children,

267
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,600
to my church, to my pastor, to my, no, no, no.

268
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,760
Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.

269
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,799
Why does that matter?

270
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,640
Because that's who you're gonna stand before.

271
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,559
That's who you're gonna stand before.

272
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:40,400
And so we ought to prove.

273
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,160
What does it mean to prove?

274
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,359
Well, that's work, that's labor.

275
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:46,119
It's labor.

276
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:48,400
Many times the word proving was used

277
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,799
within the context of metalworking,

278
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,559
where you would prove a metal,

279
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,960
where you would refine that process

280
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,080
of adding the heat and the fire

281
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:00,880
to take out all of that which is to be removed

282
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,520
so that you would have the purity of that metal.

283
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,720
And you find that here the Bible says

284
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,080
proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.

285
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,559
It's a simple verse of scripture.

286
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:11,679
I believe that every one of us here this morning

287
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,940
could memorize this week this verse.

288
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,040
Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.

289
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,080
It's not a hard verse.

290
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:22,679
But oh, implementing the truth of this verse

291
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:26,720
into our lives is so much more challenging

292
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,000
than simply memorizing the verse.

293
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,040
But could I tell you this morning,

294
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,479
it's worth it to implement the truth.

295
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:34,479
Proving, how do I prove?

296
00:19:34,479 --> 00:19:36,239
When I look at this truth this morning

297
00:19:36,239 --> 00:19:38,320
in Ephesians five and verse 10,

298
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,540
how do I prove what is acceptable unto the Lord?

299
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,380
You know what it means?

300
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,400
It means we gotta dig into God's word.

301
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,160
We gotta dig in and find how.

302
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,479
Is this activity, this behavior,

303
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:49,320
this whatever I'm looking at doing,

304
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,640
is this acceptable unto the Lord?

305
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:55,119
Is he going to be pleased with it?

306
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:56,840
So important.

307
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,840
And can I tell you this morning,

308
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,799
that if you honestly.

309
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:05,519
search the Scriptures, and you're not just trying to twist the Scriptures, but

310
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:10,399
if you honestly search the Scriptures, I believe that God and His Spirit will

311
00:20:10,399 --> 00:20:16,279
reveal to us what is acceptable to Him. And we can prove what is acceptable unto

312
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:25,119
the Lord. It takes work. It takes diligence. And you'll only do it if you have the

313
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:32,799
desire to be accepted of Him. Notice we find in Philippians chapter 4 and verse

314
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:37,239
number 18, the Bible says this in Philippians 4 and verse number 18, as

315
00:20:37,239 --> 00:20:40,759
Paul is writing, and really what he's doing in this section of Philippians 4

316
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:47,159
is he's commending the believers in Philippi for their gift, a financial

317
00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:51,719
gift that they gave to help him, and they gave once and again. And really the

318
00:20:51,719 --> 00:20:56,079
context of Philippians 4 has nothing to do with tithing. It has everything to do

319
00:20:56,079 --> 00:21:00,679
with giving above and beyond tithing, specifically with regard to really what

320
00:21:00,679 --> 00:21:06,279
we would call today missions giving. And we find that here they had given, they

321
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:11,159
had communicated once and again, they had given of their own resources so that

322
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:16,559
Paul could fulfill the ministry that God had called him to fulfill, and he says to

323
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:21,839
them in verse 18, but I have all and abound, I am full, having received of

324
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:26,679
Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you. That's the offering that I just

325
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:34,839
alluded to. But notice how he describes it, an odor of a sweet smell, a sacrifice

326
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:41,679
acceptable, well-pleasing to God. You know what Paul's saying to these believers in

327
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:46,359
Philippi? What you did there in following the will of God, following God's

328
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:50,479
leadership in your life, and you communicating with me and enabling the

329
00:21:50,479 --> 00:21:55,639
ministry to go forward, enabling the gospel to be spread forth, that that

330
00:21:55,639 --> 00:22:01,639
sacrifice was acceptable and well-pleasing to God. I want my life to

331
00:22:01,639 --> 00:22:06,959
be acceptable and well-pleasing to God. I want God to be pleased with those

332
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:11,279
things that we do, that we say, I want it for myself personally, I want it for our

333
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:17,039
church corporately, that God would be pleased with us. We find in Hebrews, you

334
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:21,039
don't need to turn there, but Hebrews 13 and verse number 21, the Bible says, I'll

335
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:24,959
read verse 20, now the God of peace that brought again from the dead our Lord

336
00:22:24,959 --> 00:22:29,039
Jesus, that great Shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting

337
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:36,119
covenant, make you perfect in every good work to do His will, working in you that

338
00:22:36,199 --> 00:22:41,079
which is well-pleasing in His sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory

339
00:22:41,079 --> 00:22:47,279
forever and ever. Amen. I like that little phrase in verse 21 that says

340
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:52,639
well-pleasing in His sight. You know the amazing thing? The Bible says in verse 21

341
00:22:52,639 --> 00:22:58,319
that He is working in us, that it says this, working in you that which is

342
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:02,519
well-pleasing in His sight. But you know what you have to do? You have to let Him

343
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:08,079
work in you. You have to let Him work in you. He desires to work in you, He desires

344
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:13,399
to work through you, He wants to work in you that which is well-pleasing, and He's

345
00:23:13,399 --> 00:23:20,119
ready and He's able, but we have a will, and we have to allow Him. So often we

346
00:23:20,119 --> 00:23:24,559
look at the life of the Apostle Paul and we may be tempted to put Paul on some

347
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:29,519
type of pedestal, if you will, and we may look at Paul at some level of this great

348
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:34,759
Christian, and oh, that we might be used of God like Paul was, but you know

349
00:23:34,759 --> 00:23:40,639
why God used Paul? Because Paul surrendered. Because Paul made himself

350
00:23:40,639 --> 00:23:45,759
available. Because Paul had that desire that he would be accepted of Him, and

351
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:51,039
Paul made himself available. He said, I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I

352
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:55,959
live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me. In the life that I now live in the flesh,

353
00:23:55,959 --> 00:24:00,359
I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave Himself for me. And

354
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:04,359
just a few verses in 2 Corinthians chapter 5 and verse number 15, a verse

355
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:08,679
that's really my favorite Bible verse, and that He died for all that they which

356
00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:15,239
live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto Him which died for

357
00:24:15,239 --> 00:24:21,879
them and rose again. Paul was used of the Lord because Paul was surrendered to the

358
00:24:21,879 --> 00:24:29,799
Lord. Paul desired to be that vessel that was meat for the Master's work. This

359
00:24:29,799 --> 00:24:33,559
morning we see this desire in 2 Corinthians 5, in the end of verse

360
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:42,559
number 9, we may be accepted of Him daily as we live our lives. Do we have that

361
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:50,279
desire? Do we think through the daily things that we do, do we examine them

362
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:56,479
through that filter of Ephesians 5 and verse number 10, will this please my

363
00:24:56,479 --> 00:25:02,799
Savior? Will this please my Savior? The desire of Paul, number two this morning,

364
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:09,079
the dedication of Paul. His desire to please the Lord resulted in his

365
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:13,440
dedication. Can I tell you, most times in life when we think about people that have

366
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:18,799
a desire for something, if they truly have a desire to achieve something, to

367
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:23,440
accomplish something, to attain something, they are dedicated to whatever

368
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:30,000
that thing is. If it's a true, deep-rooted desire that they have, then there's some

369
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:36,679
dedication that is going to be evident in their life. You find somebody that

370
00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:39,799
says, well I want to do this, and they share with you the desire, but you see

371
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:45,839
absolutely no evidence that would have any, give any kind of thought to your

372
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:52,399
mind that they truly desire that. You say, I'm not really sure you desire that, but

373
00:25:52,399 --> 00:25:57,399
Paul is dedicated. Notice what he says here in verse number nine as we look at

374
00:25:57,399 --> 00:26:04,199
this verse of Scripture. He says, wherefore, notice these words, we labor. We

375
00:26:04,199 --> 00:26:10,919
labor. That whether present or absent, notice we may be accepted of Him. Why

376
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:15,759
does he use this word labor? We mentioned earlier in Ephesians 5 and verse number

377
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:20,519
10, proving what is acceptable in the Lord, the work that's required in that proving

378
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:26,679
process. And here in 2 Corinthians 5 and verse number 9, he says we labor. Paul, I

379
00:26:26,679 --> 00:26:31,879
believe, regularly examined his life. I believe that Paul, as he writes to the

380
00:26:31,879 --> 00:26:37,279
church in 1 Corinthians and chapter number 11 about examining ourselves with

381
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:42,039
regard to the Lord's Supper, I think that regularly in Paul's life he examined

382
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:50,319
himself. He desired to know on a regular basis was he living in such a way that

383
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:59,759
was pleasing to God. Turn over here to the book of Acts, in Acts chapter 24, and I want you to see what Paul says here in Acts chapter 24, and in this text of

384
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:05,279
Scripture, he is giving his defense before Felix. We find that Paul, in this

385
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:09,440
section of the book of Acts, he's had the opportunity to stand and to share his

386
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:23,839
testimony and stood before the religious leaders of the community there, the Sanhedrin, if you will. We find that many of those religious leaders were there, and then he's going to be before Felix. We find that he will have

387
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:29,000
opportunity to stand before Festus and Agrippa as well in the next several

388
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,679
chapters, and so Paul is having this unique opportunity in this section of the

389
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:41,720
book of Acts to be able to share what Christ did for him with these people. We

390
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:47,479
find that in Acts 24, as Paul is going through the process here of giving his

391
00:27:47,479 --> 00:27:52,079
defense, if you will, before Felix, notice, if you will, in verse number 13,

392
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:57,039
neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me. Paul had been

393
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:02,039
accused of some things, and in verse 8 it talks about how they accused him, and he

394
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:06,479
says, in verse 10, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself, and he says

395
00:28:06,479 --> 00:28:10,399
they can't prove those things, but then notice what he says. He begins in verse

396
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:16,479
14, he gives this, he says, I confess. He gives this testimony, if you will, unto

397
00:28:16,479 --> 00:28:20,759
Felix and those that would be there, and he says, but this I

398
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:27,559
confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the

399
00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:33,679
God of my fathers. Notice what he says at the end of verse number 14. Believing,

400
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:43,799
what's it say? All things. Not some things, not most things, not the things that I

401
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:49,039
like or the things that I can kind of fit in, but he says, believing all things

402
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:54,479
which are written in the law and in the prophets. Now what does that refer to?

403
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:59,080
That refers to the Old Testament, the law and the prophets, and so we could talk

404
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:03,000
about Bible preservation right here from this verse of Scripture, and how Paul

405
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,279
believed that God's Word had been preserved, and he says, I believe all of

406
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:11,799
it. He wasn't coming with a textual critic mindset of let's criticize and

407
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:15,399
let's try to critique and change and so on and so forth. No, he says, I believe

408
00:29:15,399 --> 00:29:21,919
all things which are written in the law and in the prophets and have hope toward

409
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:28,039
God. That word hope is an interesting word. It's so unlike the word that is

410
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:33,880
used in our vernacular today. People talk about hope today with all sorts of

411
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:37,839
ideas of really the best way I could describe the most common usage that I

412
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:42,959
hear is kind of a wishful thinking idea. I hope this is gonna happen. No, no, that's

413
00:29:42,959 --> 00:29:48,279
not, when you see the word hope in the Bible, that is not the definition. It is a

414
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:54,399
confident expectation. It is having this confidence, he says, and have hope toward

415
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:59,279
God, which they themselves also allow that there shall be a resurrection of

416
00:29:59,279 --> 00:29:59,799
the dead.

417
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:05,079
Both of the just and unjust and why is he saying this? Why is he talking about this resurrection?

418
00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:07,279
Well, because this motivates his living

419
00:30:08,679 --> 00:30:12,799
This is what plays into that desire which leads to that

420
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:17,679
dedication that Paul has and we come to verse number 16 and notice what he says and

421
00:30:19,239 --> 00:30:20,559
Herein

422
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,559
Do I exercise?

423
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,239
myself

424
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:27,679
You know what that word exercise means it means to labor

425
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:30,879
It means to just drive

426
00:30:31,999 --> 00:30:36,599
What did we see over in 2nd Corinthians 5 and verse number 9? He says wherefore

427
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:39,639
Wherefore we labor

428
00:30:39,639 --> 00:30:42,759
Right. So we find here. He says that I I

429
00:30:43,399 --> 00:30:48,439
Exercise myself. What is he exercising himself for in Acts 24 in verse 16?

430
00:30:48,439 --> 00:30:53,639
What is he laboring and striving for in this verse of Scripture notice to have always?

431
00:30:54,839 --> 00:30:56,839
to have always

432
00:30:57,079 --> 00:30:58,079
a

433
00:30:58,079 --> 00:31:00,079
conscience void of

434
00:31:00,439 --> 00:31:01,839
offense

435
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:03,839
toward God and

436
00:31:04,719 --> 00:31:08,319
Toward men. I want you to think about this just for a moment

437
00:31:09,639 --> 00:31:14,079
Paul says I'm exercising myself. I'm laboring. I'm striving

438
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:22,159
For what purpose Paul? Why are you exercising Paul? What is this this this effort that is going forth?

439
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:25,159
Why are you dedicated to this because I want to have

440
00:31:25,959 --> 00:31:27,759
Always

441
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:31,279
not most times but always a

442
00:31:32,679 --> 00:31:36,279
Conscience that is void of offense

443
00:31:37,999 --> 00:31:39,999
Toward God

444
00:31:40,199 --> 00:31:44,639
We sing the song nothing between my soul and my Savior

445
00:31:45,999 --> 00:31:47,199
Paul

446
00:31:47,199 --> 00:31:51,199
Communicates to Felix. Why why is he doing the things that he's doing?

447
00:31:51,199 --> 00:31:53,479
Why is he being accused of what he's being accused of?

448
00:31:53,479 --> 00:32:00,679
why did Paul go and preach in all of these places and and give the gospel and and tell people that

449
00:32:00,999 --> 00:32:03,999
Jesus is the only way why did Paul do all of this?

450
00:32:03,999 --> 00:32:09,959
Well, he desired to live his life in such a way that he would please his Savior

451
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:17,279
He desired he exercised himself to have always listen if he's going to have always a conscience

452
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:20,919
That's void of offense toward God. This exercise was regular

453
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:24,959
He didn't let things just kind of build up and just kind of well

454
00:32:24,959 --> 00:32:29,879
We'll do this once a month once every whatever. No, this was a regular occurrence in his life. I

455
00:32:30,879 --> 00:32:35,839
Want to have nothing between my soul and my Savior, but then notice he ends with these words and

456
00:32:36,919 --> 00:32:38,919
toward men and

457
00:32:39,079 --> 00:32:41,079
toward men

458
00:32:41,439 --> 00:32:44,279
Someone has said if you're not right with your neighbor, you're not right with God

459
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:48,599
If you're not right with one another you're not right with God

460
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:52,119
There's some people that have this idea I'm right with God

461
00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:56,279
I'm concerned about my relationship with God, but I really don't care about any other relationship

462
00:32:56,839 --> 00:33:03,239
Paul says I desire I exercise myself to have a conscience. That's void of offense. That's always

463
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:05,959
void of offense toward God and

464
00:33:06,719 --> 00:33:08,519
toward men

465
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:10,159
Paul desired

466
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:14,519
To live his life in such a way that God would be pleased with him

467
00:33:14,719 --> 00:33:19,159
That that he would not bring a reproach against the name of the Savior

468
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:22,679
we find that earlier if you turn back just a

469
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:26,559
Book or a chapter or so in your Bibles there in chapter 23

470
00:33:26,599 --> 00:33:28,359
Maybe it's on the same page for you

471
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:32,399
But in verse 1 of chapter 23 notice the Bible says this and Paul

472
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:40,359
Earnestly beholding the council said men and brethren. I have lived in all good conscience before God

473
00:33:41,199 --> 00:33:43,199
until this day

474
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:47,039
How could Paul make that statement

475
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:54,479
Well, because then he later reveals to us. Listen, he didn't start exercising himself when he stood before Felix

476
00:33:54,479 --> 00:33:58,559
He had already been exercising himself to have always a conscience

477
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:00,519
That's void of offense toward God and toward men

478
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:04,599
And so when he stood before these religious leaders in Acts chapter 23

479
00:34:04,599 --> 00:34:10,679
He says I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day

480
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:17,639
Now I want you to think about the context of 2nd Corinthians and we talked about this several weeks ago as we've been studying through

481
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:25,199
This chat or through this book and we found that in chapter number one. I preached a message when you're misunderstood

482
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:31,519
When you're misunderstood and I said this when I preached that message. There's been a time in your life

483
00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:36,399
I guarantee there's been a time in your life that you have been misunderstood

484
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:42,039
There's been a time in your life where you misunderstood someone else we can all relate to this

485
00:34:43,319 --> 00:34:49,319
And as we look at that passage of Scripture at the end of 2nd Corinthians chapter number one, we noticed how Paul

486
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:53,839
Approached that situation of being misunderstood. What was the misunderstanding?

487
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:59,959
Well, they were accusing Paul that hey, you said you were gonna come visit us and you didn't and so therefore you're not trustworthy

488
00:34:59,959 --> 00:35:04,279
and you're kind of your yay means nay and your name means yay and Paul just he's

489
00:35:04,279 --> 00:35:08,399
He's double-minded and so on and so forth. And that was not true

490
00:35:09,799 --> 00:35:16,539
But I said this when I preached that message that before Paul ever tried to explain himself. He first examined himself

491
00:35:18,039 --> 00:35:20,039
And how that be a good rule for us

492
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:25,199
To examine ourselves before we ever try to explain ourselves. And what does he say?

493
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:33,159
Well in verse number 12 of 2nd Corinthians 1 he says for our rejoicing is this the testimony of our conscience that in simplicity and godly

494
00:35:33,399 --> 00:35:36,479
Sincerity not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God

495
00:35:36,479 --> 00:35:41,159
We have had our conversation in the world and more abundantly to you word

496
00:35:41,399 --> 00:35:43,839
You know what Paul was saying in that verse of Scripture

497
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:48,359
He was saying that he had examined himself and that before the Lord he was right

498
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:55,179
He was right before the Lord. There was nothing that he had done. That was offensive. That was inappropriate. That was sin

499
00:35:55,539 --> 00:36:01,599
That was not pleasing to his God. And so he went through that process. And so why do I bring that up?

500
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:08,399
Well, because he says that in verse 9 of our text this morning in 2nd Corinthians chapter 5 we therefore we labor

501
00:36:09,079 --> 00:36:15,039
We labor this was something that was ongoing. This was something that was regular. This was a regular occurrence

502
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:22,559
This was something that Paul was dedicated to whether absent or present or absent. We may be accepted of him

503
00:36:23,799 --> 00:36:29,079
Can I tell you this morning? There's not one of us that knows when we're gonna leave this earth

504
00:36:29,919 --> 00:36:31,919
None of us know

505
00:36:34,479 --> 00:36:36,479
The rapture could happen at any moment

506
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,519
But death could happen in any moment

507
00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:45,639
David said this as he's being sought by Saul

508
00:36:45,759 --> 00:36:50,419
There's but a step between me and death and as I've often thought about that passage of Scripture

509
00:36:50,419 --> 00:36:54,479
The reality in David's life is that yes Saul was hunting him

510
00:36:54,479 --> 00:36:57,720
I mean Saul had made David his enemy continually and he had his

511
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:02,399
Choices men and he was seeking after and he sought to kill David and yes

512
00:37:02,399 --> 00:37:08,759
There was but a step between him and death, but you know for each of us. There's about a step between us and death. I

513
00:37:09,879 --> 00:37:13,759
Shared some with some of the folks that were here for visitation yesterday morning

514
00:37:13,759 --> 00:37:18,359
we're driving home late on Friday evening and we're driving home and

515
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:25,799
We're on 95 and we come around this corner and you could see not much more than maybe a quarter mile ahead of us

516
00:37:25,799 --> 00:37:27,559
It was coming in the opposite direction

517
00:37:27,559 --> 00:37:33,639
But you could see a car that was on fire that I'm telling you the flames had to be 15 20 feet out of that car

518
00:37:34,359 --> 00:37:36,359
Just an inferno

519
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:40,839
There was no accident. I have no idea what happened. We're going on our way

520
00:37:40,839 --> 00:37:42,839
So you can't really you know, you're not stopping and checking it out

521
00:37:42,839 --> 00:37:46,879
But the reality is that that thing was just up in flames, but there was no accident

522
00:37:46,879 --> 00:37:50,359
It's not like there was a crash that reason I have no idea what happened

523
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,039
but what I know is or what I

524
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:56,079
assume is

525
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:02,319
That that person didn't get in their car that evening to travel down 95 south and think that their car was gonna catch on fire

526
00:38:02,319 --> 00:38:05,079
In that manner. I don't think they thought that was gonna happen

527
00:38:06,399 --> 00:38:12,119
How many people we read? I mean look think about recent things that have been in our backyard a

528
00:38:12,879 --> 00:38:17,519
Plane going to land at Reagan National. How many of you have flown into Reagan National before?

529
00:38:19,479 --> 00:38:21,479
How many of you been on an airplane before

530
00:38:22,799 --> 00:38:27,899
How many of you bought a ticket after you or you said maybe I'm not gonna buy a ticket right

531
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:35,839
135 or whatever the number was people in that plane

532
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,119
if you've flown into Reagan before and I have many times

533
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:46,239
When you're flying into Reagan, what do I do? I see the Potomac

534
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,279
We're getting close

535
00:38:48,279 --> 00:38:55,479
Am I am I telling the truth if you've landed in Reagan you're flying in there. You can see it. You know, the approach is there. I

536
00:38:58,679 --> 00:39:00,679
Can't even hardly imagine that

537
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:04,320
But that's how frail our lives are

538
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:07,599
That's the frailty of life

539
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,799
And

540
00:39:08,799 --> 00:39:13,239
So why does Paul say I'm laboring? Why does he say I'm striving?

541
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:19,000
Why does he say that that I'm exercising myself because in any moment you can meet the Lord

542
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:22,839
And

543
00:39:22,839 --> 00:39:24,839
Is your life well pleasing?

544
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:27,679
to God is

545
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,200
my life

546
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,799
well pleasing

547
00:39:30,799 --> 00:39:32,279
to God

548
00:39:32,279 --> 00:39:35,279
Speaking with regard to the the rapture and again

549
00:39:35,279 --> 00:39:38,839
We know that that could happen at any time if you read the book of 1st

550
00:39:38,839 --> 00:39:44,679
John and you end the second chapter and you enter into the third chapter and in those few verses of Scripture

551
00:39:44,679 --> 00:39:51,279
It's very clear that he's speaking about the the Lord Jesus Christ coming back and he says at the end of chapter number two

552
00:39:51,279 --> 00:39:55,279
That we would not be ashamed of him at his appearing

553
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:00,000
But the reality is that you don't know when he's going

554
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,280
going to appear, because it says, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye.

555
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,840
Is that not what the Bible says?

556
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:13,119
As a thief in the night, listen, the reality is that Jesus is not going to send you a two-minute

557
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,000
warning, a two-week warning.

558
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,319
He's not going to say, hey, listen, get your life straightened up because I'm coming back

559
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:19,319
next Tuesday.

560
00:40:19,319 --> 00:40:22,399
No, no, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye.

561
00:40:22,399 --> 00:40:24,899
Is that not what the Bible teaches?

562
00:40:24,899 --> 00:40:28,440
So why is Paul so concerned about this thing?

563
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:34,520
Why is Paul living his life in the manner in which he is, this desire of being accepted

564
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:40,919
of him has just led to a dedication in his life that I'm laboring, I'm striving, I'm

565
00:40:40,919 --> 00:40:41,919
exercising.

566
00:40:41,919 --> 00:40:42,919
Why?

567
00:40:42,919 --> 00:40:45,599
Because I want God to be pleased with my life.

568
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:51,400
And this morning, every believer in Corinth and every believer throughout the church age

569
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:57,439
that has read this portion of Scripture should have the same desire, should have the same

570
00:40:57,439 --> 00:41:01,279
desire, I want to please my Savior.

571
00:41:01,279 --> 00:41:13,760
How often do we examine our lives to truly determine if God is pleased?

572
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,080
My thoughts.

573
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,680
God knows your thoughts.

574
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:22,319
You can hide your thoughts for a period of time.

575
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:25,160
You can hide your thoughts from other people.

576
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,440
Why do I say for a period of time?

577
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:29,959
Because your thoughts eventually are going to become your actions.

578
00:41:29,959 --> 00:41:34,599
But for a period of time, your thoughts can be hidden from other people, but God knows

579
00:41:34,599 --> 00:41:35,959
them.

580
00:41:35,959 --> 00:41:36,959
God knows what you're thinking.

581
00:41:36,959 --> 00:41:42,180
Do you remember when Jesus stood there and as He's ministering and those people are reasoning

582
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:46,360
amongst themselves and He says, why do you think this in your heart?

583
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:49,000
Can you imagine how they must have thought at that moment?

584
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,199
How do you know what I'm thinking?

585
00:41:52,199 --> 00:41:54,839
You ever look at your spouse and you kind of can just see and you say, I know what you're

586
00:41:54,839 --> 00:41:57,720
thinking.

587
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:00,419
You might be wrong when you say, I know what you're thinking.

588
00:42:00,419 --> 00:42:04,000
But God knows exactly what we're thinking.

589
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:12,259
We think about my thoughts being pleasing to God, my words being pleasing to God.

590
00:42:12,259 --> 00:42:15,600
My actions.

591
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:18,960
Thoughts lead to words, lead to actions.

592
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:25,000
In this age in which we live, I wonder this morning if my electronic communication is

593
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,240
pleasing to God.

594
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:33,199
The text that I send, the emails that I send, the whatever social media posts.

595
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:37,880
Listen, sometimes people just throw stuff out there and they think that it doesn't really

596
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:38,880
matter.

597
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,399
Listen, is it pleasing to God?

598
00:42:40,399 --> 00:42:44,119
Is God pleased with it?

599
00:42:44,119 --> 00:42:46,639
My online activity.

600
00:42:46,639 --> 00:42:48,600
No one's ever going to know.

601
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,279
Can I give you a newsflash?

602
00:42:50,279 --> 00:42:53,259
So many people know.

603
00:42:53,259 --> 00:42:58,479
They can get your device, they can track your IP, they know what you're doing.

604
00:42:58,479 --> 00:43:00,320
You think you're hiding something.

605
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:04,080
It's like Rachel when she hid those images in the tent.

606
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,399
You know who didn't know?

607
00:43:06,399 --> 00:43:08,160
Jacob.

608
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,679
You know why I think he didn't know?

609
00:43:09,679 --> 00:43:14,779
Because he said to Laban, whoever you find them with, let them die.

610
00:43:14,779 --> 00:43:19,339
Do you think he would have said that if he…no.

611
00:43:19,339 --> 00:43:26,639
But God knew what was in the tent because years later Moses wrote about it.

612
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:28,639
God knew.

613
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:31,479
I've hidden this, I've…no, no.

614
00:43:31,479 --> 00:43:34,279
God knows.

615
00:43:34,279 --> 00:43:41,399
And the question this morning, is it well-pleasing to God?

616
00:43:41,399 --> 00:43:45,520
Not is it well-pleasing to my parents and I'm sure that if it were your parents they

617
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,240
wouldn't be well-pleased.

618
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:50,039
Not is it well-pleasing to my spouse, I'm sure if they knew they wouldn't be pleased.

619
00:43:50,039 --> 00:43:52,759
I'm saying God knows.

620
00:43:52,759 --> 00:43:56,440
And is it well-pleasing to God?

621
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:00,720
The places that I go, the entertainment that I choose, the…listen, the list could go

622
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:06,199
on and on and on this morning.

623
00:44:06,199 --> 00:44:11,880
Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.

624
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:18,000
Paul says, wherefore we labor.

625
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,119
Paul knew he was going to heaven.

626
00:44:20,119 --> 00:44:22,720
There's no doubt about that whatsoever.

627
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:27,000
Paul knew that as he's writing to these believers in Corinth that they too had trusted Christ

628
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,079
as their Savior because he speaks in the plural sense.

629
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:33,920
We know, we have this confidence.

630
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:38,160
It's not a matter of whether I'm going to go to heaven.

631
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,880
It's not a matter of whether I'm going to lose my salvation.

632
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:42,880
You can't.

633
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,959
You're secure in the hand of God.

634
00:44:45,959 --> 00:44:50,660
We talked about this very truth even from the text last Sunday morning that he's given

635
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:55,359
to us the earnest of the Spirit in verse number 5.

636
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,040
I have an inheritance.

637
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:00,160
I'm secure in the hand of God.

638
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:08,200
But he says, wherefore we labor that whether present or absent we may be accepted of him.

639
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:14,799
And I hope this morning that from a single verse of Scripture that we can have that same

640
00:45:14,799 --> 00:45:19,359
level of desire that Paul communicates.

641
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:21,160
I want to be accepted of him.

642
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:24,739
I want to be well-pleasing in his sight.

643
00:45:24,739 --> 00:45:28,500
How can I please him?

644
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:31,779
He's given us a Bible and he's told us how we can please him.

645
00:45:31,779 --> 00:45:34,380
Have you ever felt like I don't know how to please somebody?

646
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:35,380
Maybe it's a boss.

647
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:36,380
Yeah, you've been there.

648
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:37,380
I don't know.

649
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:39,540
There's nothing I can do to please him.

650
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:43,700
God tells us exactly what we can do to please him.

651
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:49,540
And he also tells us the things that do not please him.

652
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:55,779
And so Paul says that I want to be accepted of him and therefore I'm dedicated to this.

653
00:45:55,779 --> 00:45:58,859
I am laboring.

654
00:45:58,859 --> 00:46:00,179
I am exercising.

655
00:46:00,179 --> 00:46:02,260
I am striving.

656
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:08,420
This morning, are you striving to please your Savior?

657
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:09,420
Let's pray together.

658
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:10,540
Father, we love you.

659
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:13,260
We thank you for loving us.

660
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:16,500
We thank you for your Word.

661
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:22,260
We thank you for this truth in the testimony of the Apostle Paul.

662
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:31,660
God, I pray that you would help us this morning to have the same desire and the same level

663
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:39,140
of commitment, dedication, that we would labor, that we would strive, that we'd exercise,

664
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:43,779
that we might be accepted, well-pleasing in your sight.

665
00:46:43,779 --> 00:46:46,220
Thank you for saving us.

666
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:52,059
Lord, we know that one day we'll see you face-to-face.

667
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:57,739
And as we'll examine next week, we'll stand before you to give an account at that judgment

668
00:46:57,739 --> 00:46:59,179
seat of Christ.

669
00:46:59,179 --> 00:47:05,820
God, it's our heart's desire this morning, my heart's desire this morning to be pleasing

670
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:07,500
in your sight.

671
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:10,700
Help us to live every day for your glory.

672
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:17,299
I pray that in these moments of invitation that you'd have your will in way, that we

673
00:47:17,299 --> 00:47:22,899
would be responsive, that we'd be doers of your Word.

674
00:47:22,899 --> 00:47:26,260
Well thank you for every decision that's made, for it's in Christ's name we pray.

675
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,260
Would you stand with me?

676
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:29,019
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

677
00:47:29,019 --> 00:47:31,179
Kimberly's gonna play quietly on the piano.

678
00:47:31,179 --> 00:47:32,820
And as she does, the altar is open.
