WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.599
I read a report one time, I believe it was Spurgeon, it might have been someone else,

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:08.920
but I think it was Spurgeon, if I remember correctly, he got to where he was going to

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.960
preach and he realized when he got there that he left all of his notes behind.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.520
And so he turned around and walked back home so he could get all of his notes and then

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.479
return to the church house so that he could preach.

00:00:20.479 --> 00:00:25.159
And I, if I walked home, I don't know that it would do anything anyway, because home

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:26.920
is right there.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:32.479
And but we'll get through it this evening, Revelation chapter 3, verses 1 through 6,

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:35.959
the church in Sardis, and notice the Bible says this beginning in verse number 1,

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:41.720
And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write, These things saith he, that hath the

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:49.520
seven spirits of God, and the seven stars, I know thy works, that thou hast a name that

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.939
thou livest, and are dead.

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:58.540
Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die, for I have

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.380
not found thy works perfect before God.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:09.580
Remember therefore how thou hast received, and heard, and hold fast, and repent, if therefore

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:18.139
thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour

00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:19.860
I will come upon thee.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.699
Thou hast a few names, even in Sardis, which have not defiled their garments, and they

00:01:24.699 --> 00:01:29.220
shall walk with me in white, for they are worthy.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.819
He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment, and I will not blot out

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:38.540
his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father and before

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:39.540
his angels.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.980
He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.099
This is the fifth church that is going to be addressed in the book of Revelation as

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:54.059
we've been studying through these letters to these local churches.

00:01:54.059 --> 00:01:59.059
Now remember, as we've looked, starting in chapter two, at the church in Ephesus, and

00:01:59.059 --> 00:02:04.559
then we moved to the church in Smyrna, Pergamos, Thyatira, we looked at that for two weeks,

00:02:04.559 --> 00:02:09.899
and now looking at the message to the church in Sardis, we find that each of these churches

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.539
are local churches that were in existence in the first century, at the time of the writing,

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:18.860
and the church is to be the pillar and ground of the truth.

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:22.059
We understand that the church is the bride of Christ.

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:27.259
It's important that we recognize this evening what a local church is and the purpose that

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:30.380
God has given for a local church.

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.940
The local church is ordained by God.

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.679
It is God's idea.

00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:36.300
It is not man's idea.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.539
It did not start with Constantine or anyone else.

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:45.500
The reality is that the Lord Jesus Christ said, I will build my church, and the gates

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.619
of hell shall not prevail against it.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:54.259
The Bible says that Christ loved the church and gave Himself for it.

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:57.860
The Bible tells us in the book of Acts, in the twentieth chapter, that the Lord Jesus

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:03.660
Christ, as Paul is giving the instruction to the leaders, the church leaders of the

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.779
church at Ephesus, he speaks about how Christ hath bought the church with His own blood.

00:03:09.779 --> 00:03:11.520
The church is precious.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.059
The church is the bride of Christ.

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:17.979
The church is to be the pillar and ground of the truth.

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:23.539
And we find this evening that God intends for there to be local churches.

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:27.979
I believe this evening that every community needs a local church.

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:33.940
I believe this evening that, yes, we live in a time in which transportation is much

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:40.300
more advanced than it was 50, 100 years ago, and therefore people can drive further distances

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.220
to get to church.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.820
And I also understand living in places where local churches are just not available.

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:52.500
We lived for two and a half years in the state of Nevada, and there was not a church like

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.059
our church for about 75 miles from where we lived.

00:03:57.059 --> 00:04:02.580
And we had to go to the best church that we could possibly find when we lived there.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.500
And it was unfortunate, but that was just the situation.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.860
And then I remember hearing about a man that was up in the northwest part of the nation

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:16.540
of America, and he was living up in that part, and an evangelist was traveling through,

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.420
and as he went into a little store, he listened as he went in, and there was a familiar voice

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:26.420
over the speakers, and the man that was running the little convenience store gas station was

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.700
listening to some preaching.

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.380
And the man had recognized the voice of the individual that was preaching, and he began

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:38.380
to inquire, and he said, there's not a place that preaches like this guy is preaching within

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.579
three hours of where we're standing right now.

00:04:42.579 --> 00:04:45.859
That's the truth in a lot of places in America.

00:04:45.859 --> 00:04:51.940
And God intends for a local church, He intends for His church to reach a community, to make

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.459
a difference.

00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:57.859
We've often spoken and we've talked about the church in Corinth and how there in Corinth

00:04:57.859 --> 00:05:04.140
that the responsibility of the believers in Corinth were to influence a community with

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:09.100
the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, and yet so often as you read through the book

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.739
of 1st and 2nd Corinthians, especially in 1st Corinthians, you find that the culture

00:05:13.739 --> 00:05:18.820
in the community was having a greater impact on the church than the church was having on

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.019
the community.

00:05:21.019 --> 00:05:29.140
Sardis is located about 30 miles away from Thyatira to the south, and we find that it

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:37.679
was a capital of ancient Lydia, and it was known for some real pagan idolatrous worship.

00:05:37.679 --> 00:05:41.600
And we find that, hey look at that, it updated, praise the Lord, and it was known for some

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:48.500
real idolatrous worship and extremely pagan, and this was a place, they said the pagan

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:53.739
worship there was extremely vile, and it was a place that needed a local church.

00:05:53.739 --> 00:05:59.059
But I would argue this evening that every community needs a local church.

00:05:59.059 --> 00:06:02.739
Every community needs a local church, and as we think about the local church and we

00:06:02.739 --> 00:06:07.299
think about the impact that the church has to have on the community, we come to this

00:06:07.299 --> 00:06:13.299
local church in Sardis, and the sad thing is that God really has nothing good to say

00:06:13.299 --> 00:06:15.339
to the church in Sardis.

00:06:15.339 --> 00:06:19.700
He'll make a mention as we get through the text this evening that there were, in verse

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:25.420
number 4, thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments.

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:32.420
But for the most part, there's not much commending for the church here in Sardis, and that's

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:39.980
a sad situation because this community suffered because the church was not shining their light

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:41.299
like they should have.

00:06:41.299 --> 00:06:46.220
We begin to look at this passage of Scripture and thinking about the church in Sardis, and

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:49.980
we note their condition as God tells us in verse number 1.

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:54.260
Notice what he says, and unto the angel of the church in Sardis, write, These things

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:59.220
saith he that hath the seven spirits of God and the seven stars, and he says, I know thy

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:00.220
works.

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:02.899
That's familiar to each of the letters, to each of the churches.

00:07:02.899 --> 00:07:11.260
And notice this phrase, that thou hast a name that thou livest and are dead.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:12.820
Wow.

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:15.019
Wow.

00:07:15.019 --> 00:07:23.420
What a statement that the all-knowing God makes about this church.

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:28.700
Now as we look at the name that thou livest and are dead, I would say that the evidence

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:30.700
did not support the claim.

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:35.500
I would say that as you look at this church and these individuals and they say that thou

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:40.859
hast a name that thou livest and are dead, remember as we looked at the church at Ephesus

00:07:40.859 --> 00:07:46.100
in chapter number 2 that the Lord Jesus Christ said in verse number 4 of chapter 2, Nevertheless

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:47.779
I have somewhat against thee, what?

00:07:47.779 --> 00:07:50.100
Because thou hast left thy first love.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:54.700
And we said this when we looked at that portion of Scripture that God knows all things and

00:07:54.700 --> 00:08:00.700
He reveals all things and it was not possible for the believers in Ephesus to say, oh no,

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:02.519
that's not true.

00:08:02.519 --> 00:08:05.420
Because God was the one that was exposing it.

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:11.779
And here in Sardis he says thou hast a name that thou livest and are dead.

00:08:11.779 --> 00:08:16.660
What we are should impact how we behave.

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:20.859
What we are should impact how we behave.

00:08:20.859 --> 00:08:26.739
Furthermore, how we behave should support what we claim to be.

00:08:26.739 --> 00:08:27.739
Think about that.

00:08:27.739 --> 00:08:33.659
We've often mentioned that belief impacts behavior and it's true but behavior reveals

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:34.739
belief.

00:08:34.739 --> 00:08:39.000
How you behave reveals truly what you believe.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.299
This evening as we look at this church in Sardis and we look at their condition and

00:08:43.299 --> 00:08:48.020
we note this first statement that is made in verse number 1 that these individuals as

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:54.260
we would look at this claim that thou hast a name that thou livest and are dead.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:59.179
The reality this evening is that the book of 1 John speaks much about some evidences.

00:08:59.179 --> 00:09:04.580
You say that you and now show me this and let's see this and if you love, you say that

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:10.500
you love God but you hate your brethren, you're lying.

00:09:10.539 --> 00:09:14.820
So the reality this evening is that we could ask the question as we have in other messages

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:18.739
is what would the evidence against us support?

00:09:18.739 --> 00:09:21.020
Would it support our claim?

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:24.340
They have a name that thou livest and are dead.

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:27.539
It's kind of interesting I believe that as you look at this truth and we understand the

00:09:27.539 --> 00:09:32.219
local church is made up of individual saved people.

00:09:32.219 --> 00:09:33.500
The church is not the building.

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:38.419
The church is made up of saved individuals that have been baptized that voluntarily joined

00:09:38.419 --> 00:09:42.059
themselves together for the purpose of fulfilling the great commission.

00:09:42.059 --> 00:09:46.020
That's how you think about membership in a local church, what a church is.

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:47.500
That's why a church is an organism.

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:48.559
It's living.

00:09:48.559 --> 00:09:55.380
It is the body of believers and if this building burned down, if this building was destroyed

00:09:55.380 --> 00:10:00.020
in some kind of a natural disaster, Fellowship Baptist Church does not cease to exist.

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:06.500
to exist, we simply do not have the same building that we once had, because the church is the

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:11.620
people. But I want you to understand that we see it even still to this day, like some

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:18.160
modern churches, that they allow people to be within the church that haven't had genuine

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:28.940
conversion. They're a professor, but not a possessor. A professor, but not a possessor.

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:32.900
In fact, I find that we see that a lot in our society today. You hear a lot of people

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:38.200
talking about God and various things that they'll say, but you begin to really look

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:43.220
at their life. You begin to look for those evidences, those fruits of salvation, the

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:47.740
fruit of being born again. And you find many times it's missing.

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:53.620
As we begin to think about this phraseology, and there's two thoughts with regard to what

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:59.900
the Lord Jesus Christ is saying to this church with regard to its membership and to regard

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:04.500
to its people. And again, in verse 4, it talks about thou hast a few names, even in Sardis,

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:09.260
which have not defiled their garments. And you begin to look at this. And Ephesians 2,

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:17.260
in verse number 1, makes it very plain that prior to salvation, we were dead. We're dead.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:22.500
We're alive physically, but we're dead spiritually. Ephesians 2, in verse 1, and you, hath he

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:29.460
quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins. The Bible goes on to talk about the

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:33.900
fact in this text of Scripture that we all had our conversation in times past in the

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:38.220
lust of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and the mind, and were by nature

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:45.940
the children of wrath, even as others, but God, who is rich in mercy. For his great love,

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:50.460
wherewith he loved us. And then it goes on to talk about salvation, for by grace are

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:56.300
you saved through faith. Aren't you thankful? It's not of works, lest any man should boast.

00:11:56.300 --> 00:12:02.340
It's a gift. And we find here that in this text of Scripture in Revelation 3, in verse

00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:06.260
number 1, that the Lord Jesus Christ says, thou hast a name that thou livest and are

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:13.380
dead. Listen, it's easy for people to say, I'm a Christian today. It's easy for people

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:17.700
to say, I'm a Christian. And then you ask them, oh, that's wonderful. Can you tell me

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:24.460
what that means? How did you become a Christian? Well, I go to church. Go to church doesn't

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:32.820
make anybody a Christian. I was baptized. Being baptized doesn't make anybody a Christian.

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:40.060
I took communion. Doesn't make you a Christian. Is that biblical? Doesn't make you a Christian.

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:47.500
And the reality is that we know that there's only one way to become a Christian. Only one

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:52.560
way. And it's through Jesus Christ. Recognizing that we're sinners and that He is the only

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:58.140
Savior and we're turning from our sin and we're turning to Christ. Repentance. And we

00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:05.620
accept that free gift of eternal life and at that moment we are made alive and we become

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:14.060
Christians. And today there's a number of people that will profess, but the question

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:22.340
is are they true possessors of eternal life? No doubt we see it again in our society today

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:27.700
and it could very well be that the Lord Jesus Christ is saying that even within those that

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:35.900
are there, there are some that are not saved. Some that are not saved. Another thought is

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:40.620
that it would be that they're void of power, that they're living in sin and they've been

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:45.780
influenced by their community and by their culture and therefore they have no power.

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:49.420
They're not filled with the power of the Holy Spirit of God as we see in Acts 1 and verse

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:58.100
number 8. They're just carnal and just void of any real spiritual impact or influence

00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:05.420
in their society, their destitute of force and of life that recognizes and is devoted

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:14.940
to God. We find this evening that the indictment against the church in Sardis is serious. And

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:20.420
it's one in which when you begin reading and you look at verse number 1, you kind of stop

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:30.140
in your tracks. You say, wow, this is real serious what the Lord Jesus Christ is saying

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:36.100
to this church. Notice, he says in verse number 2 as we continue to think about their

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:42.660
condition, we'll also see that verse 2 deals with some of the instruction with regard to

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:47.440
what they should do, but notice it says, be watchful and strengthen the things which remain

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:53.260
that are ready to die. Notice what he says, for I have not found thy works perfect before

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:58.620
God. He says in verse number 1, I know thy works and in verse number 2 he says, I have

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:05.660
not found thy works perfect before God. Can I tell you this evening that God knows our

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:13.900
works but he also knows our motives. He knows why we do the things that we do. I believe

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:19.980
it was Paul Chappell wrote a book, I read it years ago, that was titled Motives Matter.

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:25.220
And what great truth and the reality is that we could ask ourselves the question this evening,

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:31.380
why do we do the things that we do and what we do is important, no doubt. It's important

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:37.780
what we do, but why we do it is more important. Why are we doing it? Are we doing it? Think

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:41.660
about the instruction of the Lord Jesus Christ when he's speaking to his disciples and he's

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:46.860
giving truth and he talks to them about praying and about giving and he says, when you pray,

00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:51.380
don't pray like, and he talks about those Pharisees that would pray and they'd try to

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:56.980
make these real elaborate prayers and try to make everybody think about how spiritual

00:15:56.980 --> 00:16:02.700
and how wise they are and God would say this, the Lord Jesus Christ says, they have their

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:09.820
reward. What was their reward? It was the applause of man, the praise of man. He says,

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:15.100
but when you pray, enter into your closet and your father would see it in secret, he'll

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:20.820
reward thee openly. We find that he talks about when you fast, don't walk around, oh,

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:26.140
I'm fasting, I don't know, I've been fasting for seven days, I've been fasting, and by

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:30.580
the way, that's something I'm going to preach on soon about fasting and something that God

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:36.780
just kind of put on my heart and it's a needful thing, but the reality is that Jesus in the

00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:43.420
same text of scripture says, don't fast like they fast. They have their reward. What is

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:49.980
it? The applause of man, the praise of man. When you give, don't give so everyone else

00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:57.020
can see what you gave so that people can recognize and, oh, if that's what you do, then that's

00:16:57.020 --> 00:17:04.620
your reward, the applause of man. And see, God knows our hearts. Remember, he talks about

00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:11.620
the widow that puts in just two mites and he says she gave more than everyone else.

00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:18.620
Why? Well, everyone else gave out of their abundance, but she gave everything she had.

00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:25.820
See, God's way is different than our way, and he says to this church in Sardis, I have

00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:33.580
not found thy works perfect before God. This evening, God knows our works, but he knows

00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:39.940
our motives. Why are we doing the things that we're doing? Are we doing it simply to have

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:45.860
the recognition of man? Are we doing it simply to have the applause of man? Or are we doing

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:52.900
it for the glory of Jesus alone? Are we doing it if no one else even knows that we're doing

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:59.940
it, if no one else even recognizes, if no one ever gives you a thank you? Are you doing

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:06.420
it for God? And it's so important, and he says, I know thy works. And then he says,

00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:12.260
I have found, I have not found thy works perfect before God. Notice the condition, but then

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:17.620
I want you to note the counsel. In verses 2 and 3, there are several things, really

00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:22.580
five different things that the Lord gives by way of counsel to this local church. By

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:29.580
the way, let me say this, counsel is good when it's heated. How often we receive counsel

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:38.340
from the word of God. We go to God's word and we seek for answers and for counsel and

00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:42.820
for direction, but if we walk away and we lean on our own understanding, if we walk

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:48.739
away and do our own thing anyway, then it really was kind of pointless. How often people

00:18:48.739 --> 00:18:55.700
will say, can I counsel with you? And I'm glad to point people in the way of which the

00:18:55.700 --> 00:19:02.700
Lord says in his word. But counsel is only good if you take heed. It's only good if you

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:10.460
take heed. It's only good if you take heed. Dean has a little thing on his, on the finance

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:15.660
office wall downstairs that says, really people don't want counsel, they just want their opinion

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:21.820
coming out of your mouth. And sometimes you find that to be true, don't you? People just

00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:28.380
want to hear what they want to hear. And sometimes people will seek counsel from multiple sources

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:35.380
until they find what they really want to hear. But here it's the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:42.020
the God of the universe that's giving counsel to this local church. I'm thankful that the

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:48.980
Bible tells us that, speaking of God's word in Psalm 19, that by these, by God's precepts

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:55.980
that thy servant is warned and in keeping of them there is great reward. You know, warnings

00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:59.980
like counsel are only good if you take heed.

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:06.060
beneficial when they're heated. We can put up warning labels, we can put up all court signs,

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:12.780
and all sorts of things, but if those warnings are not taken heed to, it does nothing for us.

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:19.820
And notice he says, first of all, in verse number two, be watchful, to give strict attention to,

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:25.420
to be active. He says, listen, it's almost like kind of a wake up kind of a situation. Be watchful.

00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:28.940
If you're in the, if you've ever served in the military, you know that they have,

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:33.580
in the Navy, at least as far as Evan is concerned, they refer to it as he has watch. And

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:37.820
in the Marine Corps, my dad and those that were in the Marines, they would refer to it as having

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:41.900
duty, but really it's the same exact thing, having watch. And what is the deal? Well,

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:47.180
they're to watch and to be aware of what's taking place and to be alert. And here,

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:54.460
the Lord Jesus Christ says, be watchful. Don't be asleep at the wheel. Don't, don't, don't,

00:20:54.460 --> 00:21:02.700
don't be distracted. Be watchful. He says, number two, strengthen the things that remain

00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:09.340
to fix, to set fast these things that he spends. He does not specify specifically

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:13.180
what those things are, but notice he says, strengthen the things which remain.

00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:16.380
And then notice the, the added statement that are ready to die.

00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:25.420
Strengthen the things that remain, that are ready to die. This church was in bad shape.

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:36.940
This local church in Sardis was, was not doing what God intended for a local church to do and to be.

00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:42.620
And he tells them, be watchful. He tells them to strengthen the things which remain.

00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:46.620
Strengthen the things which remain. He tells them in verse number three, notice he says,

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:52.940
remember, remember what? Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard.

00:21:54.620 --> 00:22:01.980
I love the book of 1 and 2 Peter, the books of 1 and 2 Peter. And specifically, as you begin to,

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:08.220
to look at 2 Peter, Peter makes these statements a couple of times in the book where he talks about,

00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:11.980
he's going to stir the people up by putting them in remembrance.

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:17.740
If you begin to think about Peter in 2 Peter making this reference to putting people in

00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:23.900
remembrance and you couple that with Psalm 119 where the psalmist talks about, I will not forget

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:29.260
thy precepts. And you couple that with what Moses tells the children of Israel in the book of

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:33.740
Deuteronomy as they're preparing to enter into the land of promise. He says, listen, you're going to

00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:37.980
come to a land and you're going to have vineyards and you're going to have fields and you're going

00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:42.540
to have houses and you've not built these and you've not planted these and you're going to

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:50.060
benefit from all of this, but beware lest thou forget the Lord. We find that you come to the

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:55.500
book of Jeremiah and throughout the book, you find these references, how that the people of God

00:22:55.500 --> 00:23:03.820
had forgotten their God days without number. We're prone to forget. And God says, remember,

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:13.100
remember what? Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard. Every local church

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:21.820
that is started, that's a biblical local church, is started on the foundation of Jesus Christ.

00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:28.460
And we find that a local church, as we could think about Sardis and they're starting there

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:33.820
and all that took place. And you can find that a local church has that, again, a biblical,

00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:41.020
I'm speaking about a proper godly New Testament Bible church. It started on the principles of

00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:46.540
God's word with Jesus Christ being the foundation, the cornerstone. And you find that that church,

00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:54.380
if we're not careful, can drift over time, being influenced by the culture, the city,

00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:59.100
the customs, and so on and so forth. And we find that a church can begin to shift,

00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:03.500
and you can look at a church and say, that's not how that church started.

00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:10.620
What went wrong? Sometimes a new pastor comes in, and sometimes a new pastor will come in and

00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:14.860
take a church in a completely different direction than what the church had been.

00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:22.140
There are churches today that are, in fact, pastors today that are having these seminars,

00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:27.900
and I believe it lacks integrity. It's a terrible situation where they're having these seminars on

00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:34.940
how to take and take a congregation and lead them away from the King James Bible to some other

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:43.180
modern version, and how to transition your church from the King James Bible. They have seminars

00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:49.740
that they're holding. How about you go start your own church that uses a different version

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:52.540
of the Bible instead of hijacking the one that uses the right Bible?

00:24:56.780 --> 00:25:05.020
But the reality is that churches can drift. We can drift, lose our focus,

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:13.020
forget our purpose. Why are we here? What did He leave us here to do? What's our purpose?

00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:20.380
And we find that He says, remember. Remember, therefore, how thou hast received and heard.

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:26.460
I think about the Apostle Paul when he's writing to Timothy in 2 Timothy chapter 2,

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:30.060
and he's giving him that wonderful instruction that we're so familiar with that really is a

00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:34.060
model for discipleship, when he says, but the things that thou hast heard of me among many

00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:39.820
witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men who shall be able to teach others also.

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:45.660
And we find that he's saying the same, not something new, not something different,

00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:51.980
but the same thing. And it's taking the truth of God's Word from one generation

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:57.980
to a next generation and giving them the truth of God's Word so that they can continue and reach

00:25:57.980 --> 00:26:03.340
their generation with the cause of Christ. And here, the church in Sardis, they had to

00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:08.060
remember their starting place. They had to remember the truth that they had started upon.

00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:15.420
And then he says this, and hold fast, and hold fast, take care of, attend to carefully. He said

00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:20.940
this to the church in Thyatira in verse number 25 of chapter 2. He says, but that which ye have

00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:31.100
already, hold fast till I come. And then he says this in verse number 3, repent and repent.

00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:38.060
I want you to think about that truth that Jesus gives here with regard to repent,

00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:42.780
and we speak about repentance with regard to salvation and the necessity thereof,

00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:49.260
but you understand that as the people of God, if we fall in this place, if we get off course,

00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:53.260
if we lose our direction, if we get involved in sin, there's a need for repentance.

00:26:54.620 --> 00:27:00.700
And we find here that he says to this church, repent. I believe this evening that God exposes

00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:07.900
the error, and He expects a response. And by the way, I think that's reasonable.

00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:17.260
It's reasonable that God would expose and then expect a response, that He exposes to the church

00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:23.260
in Sardis. By the way, it reveals to us His love. It reveals to us His care. It reveals to us His

00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:29.500
concern for this church that they, He's not just leaving it alone. He's coming, and we look in

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:35.180
chapter 2 about Thyatira. Remember, He said, and I gave her space in verse 21 to repent, and she

00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:42.300
repented not. And God is long-suffering, and I'm so thankful for that this evening. God is gracious,

00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:49.820
and He's merciful, but He exposes error and expects a response. Look over in the book of

00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:54.540
Joshua, if you will, and I love the book of Joshua. The book of Joshua gives us, turn to the

00:27:54.540 --> 00:28:00.060
seventh chapter, if you will, and the book of Joshua gives us really a picture of the victorious

00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:07.500
Christian life. Yes, the book of Joshua provides for us historical account and record of the children

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:13.260
of Israel entering into, conquering, dividing, and inhabiting the land that God had promised to

00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:18.540
Abraham. And we read through all of the book of Joshua, and we see how God worked miraculously

00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:23.260
and what God did. But we come to Joshua chapter number seven, and we're told in chapter seven,

00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:29.340
verse number one, that Israel had sinned. We're told of the truth of what took place, that they

00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:35.260
trespassed, they committed a trespass in the accursed thing. And what was it that Achan took

00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:41.660
of the accursed thing? And we find that it was not revealed to Joshua in verse one, as it is to us as

00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:47.980
the readers of the book of Joshua. We find that after the defeat, that Joshua is all kinds of

00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:54.060
sideways as to what was going on. And then God reveals to Joshua, notice if you will, in verse

00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:58.540
number eight, O Lord, what shall I say when Israel turneth their backs before their enemies? For the

00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:03.100
Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it and shall environ us, surround

00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:08.460
us, and cut off our name from the earth. And what wilt thou do unto thy great name? And the Lord

00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:17.980
said unto Joshua, Get thee up. Wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face? Israel hath sinned. And

00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:26.380
this is where God is exposing to Joshua, the leader, the sin. And notice what he says, They have

00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:31.980
also transgressed my covenant, which I commanded them, for they have even taken of the accursed

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:37.820
thing and have also stolen and dissembled also, and they have put it even among their own stuff.

00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:44.060
Therefore, verse number 12, therefore, this is the consequence. Therefore, the children of Israel

00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:50.380
could not stand before their enemies. At Ai, 36 men lost their lives a few verses earlier. And he

00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:53.900
said they could not stand against their enemies. Why? Because they were accursed. And then notice

00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:59.820
what God says at the end of verse number 12. Neither will I be with you anymore.

00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:09.280
Lord, except ye destroy the accursed from among you."

00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:17.820
That truth of Joshua 7 and verse number 12 is powerful, and it ought to be impactful.

00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:22.780
God says, I'm exposing this sin, and you better deal with it.

00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:27.780
And if you don't, I'm not going to be with you anymore.

00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:30.220
So what do they do?

00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:31.900
Joshua takes heed.

00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:33.300
Does he not?

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:37.540
Joshua recognizes the importance of what God reveals, and Joshua says, we're going to deal

00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:43.100
with this thing, and all the people come together, and they come by tribe and by family, and

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:47.500
we find that eventually Achan is found out, and Achan is destroyed.

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:51.300
You say, well, that's harsh.

00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:54.020
That's what God commanded.

00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:55.860
And then they had victory.

00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:57.540
Then they had victory.

00:30:57.540 --> 00:31:04.060
We find in Revelation chapter 3 that God exposes to this church their true condition.

00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:09.300
We'll look in a few weeks at the church of the Laodiceans, as it's called in chapter

00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:16.220
3 and verse 14, the church of the people, and we'll read how they say what they think

00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:20.540
they are, but then God says what they really are.

00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:27.060
Here for the church in Sardis, God says, here's your real condition, and here's the counsel.

00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:29.900
Here's your repent.

00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:36.340
He exposed it, and he expected that there would be a response.

00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:40.820
We find the condition, the counsel, note the consequences, often we think about consequences,

00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:45.020
we think about them strictly in a negative sense, but I want to look at it both from

00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:51.020
a positive and a negative sense this evening, and we find that negative, speaking from the

00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:55.540
negative perspective, in verse number 3, he says this, remember therefore how thou hast

00:31:55.540 --> 00:32:02.260
received and heard and hold fast and repent, if therefore thou shalt not watch.

00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:03.300
So what does he say?

00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:07.580
If you're not going to take heed to my counsel, because I said be watchful, if you're not

00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:14.220
going to do what I said to do, if therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee

00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:20.100
as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee.

00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:21.100
You know what Jesus is saying?

00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:24.500
He's saying there's going to be judgment.

00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:28.780
God judges, he's the righteous judge.

00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:31.780
God corrects, he chastens.

00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:37.060
The truth of Hebrews and the truth of Proverbs is whom the Lord loveth, he chasteneth.

00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:41.580
This evening we find that he says, if you're not going to take heed to my counsel, there

00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:43.420
will be judgment.

00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:49.500
He says that it will be sudden, he says that it will be certain.

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:59.700
Too often today, I fear that people think that they're getting away with something.

00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:03.580
They're hiding something that no one else knows about.

00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:08.860
They think they're getting away with it because, well, everything's just kind of going normal

00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:18.340
and they fail to recognize that God is never okay with sin.

00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:24.740
God is holy, holy, holy, holy.

00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:30.020
And I'm thankful that I'm clothed in the righteousness of God, but the reality this evening is that

00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:34.780
we are to walk and we are to be holy as he is holy.

00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:38.020
We're to walk in the spirit so that we do not fulfill the lust of the flesh.

00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:46.980
But I tell you this evening, I'm concerned that people think, oh, I heard what the preacher

00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:50.020
said, I read what the Bible said, I heard what the Sunday school teacher said, but

00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:55.060
eh, I'm not going to worry about that.

00:33:55.060 --> 00:34:00.820
God says there's going to be judgment, it's certain, it'll be sudden.

00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:05.020
It may not be when you think it's going to be and you take that step and you look around

00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:08.340
and say, well, nothing happened, so I guess I'm okay.

00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:11.340
No, don't be deceived.

00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:16.220
The book of Hebrews talks about sin, it talks about the deceitfulness of sin.

00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:21.580
Sin is deceitful, it's deceitful.

00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:26.900
We find that there's the positive aspect in verse number four, thou hast a few names even

00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:32.540
in Sardis which have not defiled their garments, thankful for a remnant, amen.

00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:36.060
There's some people there in the midst of all that was going on, now the reality is

00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:41.900
that they didn't stand up and they weren't making a huge difference, but there were some

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:47.260
that had not been defiled by the community, by the corruption, by all that was going on,

00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:53.020
by all that Christ said about this church, and there were some, we don't know how many,

00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:56.980
but he says thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments,

00:34:56.980 --> 00:35:01.460
and notice what he says, and they shall walk with me in white, for they are worthy.

00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:06.500
I'm thankful that God keeps a good record, I'm thankful that God knows, and that, listen,

00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:09.980
I think about Noah, he found grace in the eyes of the Lord.

00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:14.180
You know if you read Genesis chapter number six and you look and you understand all that's

00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:18.900
going on in Genesis chapter number six, you find that it was Noah that found grace in

00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:20.180
the eyes of the Lord.

00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:24.980
You find that there was great wickedness, God looked and he talked about the depravity

00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:30.340
of man and the thoughts of their heart were only evil and wicked continually, but Noah

00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:32.140
found grace in the eyes of the Lord.

00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:37.980
The reality is that even though we're living in a wicked and perverse generation, we can

00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:44.100
walk worthy, we can walk right, we can live in such a way that God is pleased, honored,

00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:45.100
and glorified.

00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:49.540
I think about the book of Titus in chapter number two and verse number 11 where the Bible

00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:55.340
says that the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, teaching us, listen,

00:35:55.340 --> 00:36:02.020
God's grace teaches us that denying ungodliness and worldly lust, we should live soberly,

00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:05.820
righteously, and godly in this present world.

00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:06.980
Why?

00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:11.740
We're looking for that blessed hope and glorious appearing of our great God and Savior, the

00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:18.900
Lord Jesus Christ, and we find that we do not have to be influenced by the wickedness

00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:23.300
and God knows and God is aware of what's taking place.

00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:29.100
We see in verse number five, he that overcometh, a phrase that's used repeatedly to these churches

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:33.620
in the book of Revelation, the same shall be clothed in white raiment and I will not

00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:38.560
blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father

00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:40.140
and before his angels.

00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:45.300
I find this evening that from a positive perspective, when we look at verse number five, I do not

00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:49.720
read this as being a threat, but an assurance.

00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:53.820
It's not a threat when he says that I will not blot out his name out of the book of life,

00:36:53.820 --> 00:37:00.620
this is an assurance to these individuals that were not defiled, that were walking worthy,

00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:06.140
that had this promise and this understanding of what they would receive and it's this assurance.

00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:10.940
Listen, today when we live in a wicked and perverse generation, sometimes we can become

00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:18.220
all so overwhelmed with all the things that are around us and we lose sight of glory.

00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:23.620
We lose sight that one day we will walk with him and we will be with him and we will rule

00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:29.260
and reign with him and so we find that the Lord Jesus Christ, he's giving this assurance

00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:32.620
to these that had not yet defiled.

00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:37.740
They had these few names in Sardis, the reference with regard to the book of life, there's several

00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:42.500
references here in the book of Revelation as well as other parts of Scripture that speak

00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:44.380
about the book.

00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:51.020
Some that refer to the book of life, the Lamb's book of life, the book written in heaven in

00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:56.660
Luke chapter number 10 that have their names written in heaven, Philippians chapter number

00:37:57.100 --> 00:38:03.260
And so there's several references to the book of life and to the book in heaven and we find

00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:10.500
this evening that I'm so thankful that my name is written in the book of life.

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:14.940
And it's never going to be removed because it's all because of what Jesus did for me

00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:20.900
and his righteousness, not my own righteousness and I have this assurance and I need to keep

00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:25.340
my focus upon the Lord Jesus Christ in eternity.

00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:29.300
And so this week on Sunday morning as we continue looking through the book of 2 Corinthians

00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:34.900
in chapter number 4, it ends with Paul speaking about this perspective of not looking at the

00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:40.700
things which are temporal but at the things which are eternal, how important that is for

00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:41.700
us.

00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:51.900
And notice what he says in verse 6, he says it to every church, he that hath an ear, let

00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:56.780
him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.

00:38:56.780 --> 00:39:03.860
This evening, Revelation 3, 1 through 6 is written to the church in Sardis but it's been

00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:11.140
preserved in God's word for every local church and it's important that every local church

00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:19.260
as we read this letter to the church in Sardis that we have ears to hear, that we take heed

00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:26.940
to the warning, that we recognize this evening the importance of why we exist.

00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:29.780
First and foremost to bring glory to God.

00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:36.420
Can I tell you this evening the church in Sardis as a whole, not bringing glory to God.

00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:41.220
They're not bringing glory to God.

00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:49.020
Can I tell you, they weren't impacting their community, they just weren't.

00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:53.980
And this evening when we think about our church, oh that God would help us to bring

00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:59.900
honor and glory to His name alone and that we would impact our community.

00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:07.960
unity, that we would recognize the purpose that God has placed us here. Why are we here?

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:12.760
Sometimes you might ask yourself that question as in, I should be moving, why am I here?

00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:20.760
But the reality is God's put us here. And just like every other local church, God has

00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:26.960
them there for a purpose. God's given to us a purpose. The church in Sardis had failed

00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:32.960
their Lord. In a real sense, they failed their community. This evening, I don't want to fail

00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:38.260
my Lord and I don't want to fail my community. There are people in our community that need

00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:46.280
to hear the truth of the gospel. I shared with you in our annual business meeting a

00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:55.200
map of our county and listed out for you by zip code the number of residents in our community

00:40:55.280 --> 00:41:02.480
and our county. Last night we're sitting around the table or in our kitchen and one of the

00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:07.480
young ladies started singing a part of a song that is Holly's dad's favorite song. Some

00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:14.800
of you might know it, People Need the Lord. It's true. People need the Lord. And this

00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:21.400
church in Sardis, they weren't impacting their community. And he that hath an ear, let him

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:28.360
hear. Oh that God would use us to make a difference that would bring glory to God.

00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:34.400
Let's pray. Father we love you. We thank you for loving us. Thank you for your word. God,

00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:45.280
it's a hard message to the church in Sardis, very direct. But I believe it's a loving message.

00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:55.640
You correct because you love. You counsel because you love. You expose and expect response.

00:41:55.640 --> 00:42:03.280
God I pray that this evening you would help us to be obedient, to be good hearers, to

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:10.320
be doers. Help us to examine individually and corporately what you've given for us to

00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:14.880
do. And help us to be faithful. Well thank you for it in Christ's name we pray. Would

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:16.920
you stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.
