1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,660
Chapter 43 and 44, you say, pastor,

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:05,579
you're gonna deal with 68 verses tonight.

3
00:00:05,579 --> 00:00:07,260
Yes, I am.

4
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:11,500
And last Sunday night, we were here until 12.30 a.m.

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,739
And so we are in good shape.

6
00:00:13,739 --> 00:00:15,920
It is 6.18, amen.

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,040
And I got plenty of time to get through 68 verses.

8
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,020
And some of you say, I am leaving.

9
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,440
I am not going to endure that.

10
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,620
In all seriousness, with God's help,

11
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:29,159
we will make it through these verses

12
00:00:29,159 --> 00:00:31,719
in a timely manner this evening.

13
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:33,959
And in Genesis chapter number 42,

14
00:00:33,959 --> 00:00:35,500
we studied several weeks ago.

15
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,560
There's been a number of Sunday evenings

16
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,880
between our last study in the book of Genesis

17
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,220
and this evening.

18
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,360
And we had Christmas Eve service

19
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,520
and we had our Christmas lunch with an afternoon service.

20
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,840
And then we had New Year's Eve service.

21
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,360
So it's been almost a month

22
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,560
since we've been in the book of Genesis on Sunday evening.

23
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,580
But very quickly to remind us

24
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:58,180
of what happened in Genesis 42,

25
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:00,380
it was in that portion of scripture

26
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:05,379
where Joseph's brothers went to Egypt the first time.

27
00:01:05,419 --> 00:01:08,260
And as we studied through Genesis chapter number 42,

28
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:11,180
we talked about how God is at work.

29
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:13,900
And we talked about God working locally

30
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,940
and God working globally.

31
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:17,839
But we really, we spent just a few minutes

32
00:01:17,839 --> 00:01:18,940
on each of those thoughts,

33
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,660
really combined just a few minutes.

34
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,760
And we focused on the entirety

35
00:01:22,779 --> 00:01:26,379
of really the message how God was working personally.

36
00:01:26,379 --> 00:01:28,180
And I'm thankful that we serve a God

37
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,379
who is the God of the universe.

38
00:01:30,379 --> 00:01:33,400
I'm thankful that he is the creator

39
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,959
and sustainer of all things,

40
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:37,779
but he is a personal God.

41
00:01:37,779 --> 00:01:41,099
And he deals with individuals and he knows us.

42
00:01:41,099 --> 00:01:42,519
He knows all about us.

43
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:43,660
He knows your thoughts.

44
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:46,940
He knows everything about you.

45
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:51,639
And he loves you and he pursues you and he's working.

46
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:55,379
And we focused on how God was working personally.

47
00:01:55,379 --> 00:01:57,459
We really focused on God's work

48
00:01:57,459 --> 00:01:59,980
in the lives of Joseph's brothers.

49
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:02,779
We had understood as you look at Genesis 42

50
00:02:02,779 --> 00:02:05,180
and look at the next several chapters

51
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:08,300
that really it had been at least 20 years

52
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,380
since Joseph had last seen his brothers.

53
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,979
In that period of time, of course,

54
00:02:12,979 --> 00:02:15,539
there were a lot of changes in Joseph's life.

55
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:17,699
And no doubt there were a number of changes there

56
00:02:17,699 --> 00:02:20,179
in the lives of his brothers as well.

57
00:02:20,179 --> 00:02:23,720
But they were holding on to something that they knew

58
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,839
that they really didn't share with anyone.

59
00:02:25,839 --> 00:02:28,119
They knew what they did to Joseph.

60
00:02:28,119 --> 00:02:31,220
They knew all that had transpired,

61
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,740
but of course they allowed dad to believe

62
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:36,360
that some evil beast hath devoured him.

63
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,679
And for all those years,

64
00:02:37,679 --> 00:02:41,479
Jacob lived thinking that Joseph was dead.

65
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:43,960
And really the brothers almost were able

66
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:48,139
to try to console themselves in a certain way

67
00:02:48,139 --> 00:02:49,600
by saying one is not.

68
00:02:49,619 --> 00:02:52,380
That's how they continually referred to Joseph

69
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,979
as one is not.

70
00:02:53,979 --> 00:02:55,399
And we find they come to Egypt.

71
00:02:55,399 --> 00:02:57,619
They have no idea that Joseph

72
00:02:57,619 --> 00:02:59,240
is the prime minister of Egypt,

73
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,539
that he's the one before whom they stand.

74
00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:04,119
But Joseph knows their identity.

75
00:03:04,119 --> 00:03:05,619
He knows who they are.

76
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:08,380
And we find that as God is working personally

77
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:11,619
in the lives of these boys, of these brethren,

78
00:03:11,619 --> 00:03:14,320
I say boys, but really they're men.

79
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,160
We find that God is working

80
00:03:17,179 --> 00:03:21,419
and their experience in Egypt reminded them

81
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:24,580
of the last encounter that they had with their brother

82
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,419
and God was convicting them.

83
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:29,419
God was pursuing them.

84
00:03:29,419 --> 00:03:33,160
We find if you would quickly look at Genesis 42 in verse 21,

85
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,539
notice what they say in this verse of scripture.

86
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:37,860
They say one to another,

87
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,779
we are verily guilty concerning our brother

88
00:03:41,779 --> 00:03:45,020
in that we saw the anguish of his soul

89
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:48,080
when he besought us and we would not hear.

90
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,080
Notice therefore is this distress come upon us.

91
00:03:53,779 --> 00:03:54,759
God was working.

92
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:57,880
I mean, God was zeroing directly in

93
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,759
and the lives of these men, of these brothers of Joseph,

94
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:05,720
that event that had taken place over 20 years earlier,

95
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,940
they were convicted.

96
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,820
They had guilt and they say,

97
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:12,380
this is the reason that we're dealing with this situation.

98
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,559
In verse 28 of Genesis 42,

99
00:04:15,059 --> 00:04:16,500
the Bible says that he said unto his brethren,

100
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,179
my money is restored and lo it is even in my sack

101
00:04:20,179 --> 00:04:23,220
and their heart failed them and they were afraid.

102
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,880
Notice they said one to another,

103
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,339
what is this that God hath done unto us?

104
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:32,619
They get home and they begin to recurse all

105
00:04:32,619 --> 00:04:35,059
that had transpired on this first trip

106
00:04:35,059 --> 00:04:36,700
to Jacob their father

107
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,980
and they let Jacob know what's going on.

108
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,000
The Bible says that they had fear,

109
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,940
even as they mentioned in verse 28

110
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:45,760
and they recognized that God was working.

111
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,239
Now, I do not know, I cannot tell you definitively

112
00:04:49,239 --> 00:04:52,760
how much time passed between the first trip to Egypt

113
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,540
and the second trip to Egypt

114
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,760
that we're gonna study this evening.

115
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,720
In chapters 43 and 44,

116
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,519
we have the opportunity to read of the second trip

117
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:05,279
that these brothers take to Egypt.

118
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:06,839
We do not know the period of time.

119
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:10,040
However, what we know is we try to consolidate

120
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,059
and figure out exactly what's taking place

121
00:05:13,059 --> 00:05:16,480
that the Bible tells us at the end of chapter 41

122
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,959
that the seven years of dearth began to come.

123
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:22,079
So there were seven years of great plenty,

124
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:25,920
the seven years of great dearth or great famine started.

125
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:30,519
And we said this last time that the famine was so intense

126
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:33,920
and so severe that it had an immediate impact.

127
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,720
I mean, all the world, the known world comes to Egypt

128
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,839
to buy food because there's no food.

129
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,399
This is a sore famine.

130
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:41,820
It is a great famine.

131
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:45,880
We know that in chapter number 45 of the book of Genesis

132
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,480
that Joseph reveals his identity to his brothers.

133
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,720
Now that's gonna be saved for next Sunday night.

134
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,640
We'll deal with that in chapter 45 next week.

135
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:58,119
But I do want to know that in the time,

136
00:05:58,119 --> 00:06:02,559
in that circumstance when Joseph is revealing his identity,

137
00:06:02,559 --> 00:06:05,200
he says in Genesis 45 in verse number six,

138
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:10,119
for these two years hath the famine been in the land.

139
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:13,899
So we know that the famine started at the end of chapter 41.

140
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:17,480
We know that in chapter 45 when Joseph reveals his identity

141
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,600
that there's two years into the famine,

142
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,839
which is going to be seven years long.

143
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:25,519
And so these two trips happen

144
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:28,760
within those first couple of years of the famine.

145
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,559
And we find that as they return back,

146
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:33,600
the brothers, all but Simeon,

147
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,399
remember Simeon was apprehended and he stays in Egypt.

148
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:38,760
He's imprisoned there.

149
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,760
And we find that all the boys return home

150
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,839
with provision for the family.

151
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,179
But soon, because of the great famine,

152
00:06:47,179 --> 00:06:49,440
that provision would be gone.

153
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,540
And there would be need to go back to Egypt.

154
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,299
But the brothers understood.

155
00:06:55,299 --> 00:06:58,119
I think that in the time that transpired

156
00:06:58,119 --> 00:07:00,600
between their return from Egypt

157
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,399
and then going back to Egypt,

158
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:04,720
they didn't forget what happened in Egypt.

159
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,600
They didn't forget what was going on

160
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,720
and how God was convicting them.

161
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,160
And they were aware of that.

162
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,279
So we come to chapter 43,

163
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:14,880
and the Bible says in verse number one,

164
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,720
and the famine was sore in the land.

165
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,119
And it came to pass, verse two,

166
00:07:19,119 --> 00:07:20,839
when they had eaten up the corn,

167
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:22,339
which they had brought out of Egypt,

168
00:07:22,339 --> 00:07:23,440
their father said unto them,

169
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,760
go again, buy us a little food.

170
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,559
As we look at this portion of scripture

171
00:07:29,559 --> 00:07:33,559
and we continue to see how God is continuing to work

172
00:07:33,559 --> 00:07:37,559
in the hearts and lives of these brethren of Joseph,

173
00:07:37,559 --> 00:07:39,799
we find tonight really three thoughts.

174
00:07:39,799 --> 00:07:43,519
And we're gonna focus mainly on chapter 44 this evening.

175
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:47,239
We'll get through chapter 43 and get to chapter 44

176
00:07:47,239 --> 00:07:50,679
to look at how God is dealing with these boys.

177
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:52,480
Let me say this, in chapter 44,

178
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,880
at the end of verse number 12,

179
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,200
the Bible says in the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.

180
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,260
That's what I've titled the message this evening.

181
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:01,700
You've probably seen it on the back of the bulletin already,

182
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:05,739
but the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.

183
00:08:05,739 --> 00:08:07,760
Notice in chapter 43, if you're taking notes,

184
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,779
number one, we notice the famine.

185
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:10,619
We notice the famine.

186
00:08:10,619 --> 00:08:11,459
The famine continues.

187
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:14,140
We know, as we've studied through the life of Joseph,

188
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:17,140
that Joseph was aware after the dream of Pharaoh

189
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,980
that there would be seven years of great plenty,

190
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,320
and then there would be seven years of great famine.

191
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:25,339
And so we understand as we enter into the text of scripture

192
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:27,619
how God is working and what God is doing

193
00:08:27,619 --> 00:08:30,260
and how God was working there in Egypt

194
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,340
and God had given Pharaoh that dream

195
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,780
and allowed Joseph to interpret the dream,

196
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,340
not only to interpret the dream,

197
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:40,000
but to have the wisdom to put a plan in place

198
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,700
that would enable not only the Egyptians to be sustained,

199
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,820
but really all the world to be sustained.

200
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,539
And we find that God was working

201
00:08:47,539 --> 00:08:49,539
and God had given much wisdom.

202
00:08:49,539 --> 00:08:52,780
And by the way, I'm thankful that that God is my God,

203
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:56,260
that he's my savior, and that he gives us wisdom.

204
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:59,380
He said, if any man lack, let him ask of God,

205
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,580
who giveth all men liberally and upbraideth not.

206
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,580
Listen, that's a wonderful promise of God's word

207
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,059
from James chapter number one,

208
00:09:05,059 --> 00:09:07,380
because the reality is that in each of our lives,

209
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,679
we lack wisdom.

210
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,739
Sometimes we continue to lack wisdom

211
00:09:11,739 --> 00:09:13,700
because we don't acknowledge that we lack wisdom

212
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,299
and we never ask God.

213
00:09:17,179 --> 00:09:19,380
But God, he's the all-wise God.

214
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,500
And he gives Joseph great wisdom.

215
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,020
And we find that as we enter into the 43rd chapter,

216
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,979
we know that the famine's gonna continue.

217
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,099
We know that it's gonna be great, grave consequences.

218
00:09:30,099 --> 00:09:32,340
And we understand that the sustenance,

219
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,940
the provision that was brought back in chapter 42,

220
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,940
it's not gonna last the entire time of the famine.

221
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,340
What are they gonna do with the provision?

222
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,580
They're gonna eat it.

223
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,119
How many times you go to the grocery store?

224
00:09:43,119 --> 00:09:46,219
We asked Ms. Deanna, she goes every other day, amen.

225
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:48,140
But just joking, and you find, listen,

226
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,580
the provision, you only have enough

227
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,780
to sustain you for a period of time.

228
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,219
And the Bible says in verse number two,

229
00:09:56,219 --> 00:09:59,419
that they had eaten up the corn,

230
00:09:59,419 --> 00:10:00,820
which they had brought back.

231
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:08,540
out of Egypt. So what does Jacob say? Go again, buy us a little food. It just makes

232
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:13,260
sense, does it not? I mean, there's one place that they're gonna get food, and

233
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:18,540
they need food to survive, and so the instruction is given, understand that as

234
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,860
we look here at this text of Scripture and we note the famine, that it was sore

235
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:26,260
in the land. They needed food, but the expectation was known. The brothers knew.

236
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:33,820
In fact, Jacob knew that the only way, the prime minister, they don't know that

237
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:38,220
it's Joseph, the only way that Joseph will entertain them again is if Benjamin

238
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:44,540
comes. Now Jacob is completely opposed to the idea of Benjamin going. Why? Joseph, in

239
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:50,580
his mind, is dead, and now I'm gonna lose Benjamin as well. And so we find that in

240
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:54,380
verse number 3, Judah speaks up. In fact, over the next two chapters as we study

241
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:57,940
through these chapters this evening, we'll see that Judah seemingly is the

242
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:01,740
spokesman for the group of brothers. He's speaking to him saying, here's what he

243
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:06,940
says to his dad, the man did solemnly protest unto us saying, ye shall not see

244
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:11,380
my face except your brother be with you. Now we won't take time to read all of it,

245
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:15,700
but really Jacob has this thought of, why did you tell him you had a brother? And

246
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:21,540
the reality is that the brothers, they had no idea that when Joseph was asking

247
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:25,140
the questions, when he says you're spies and you've come to spy out the land, and

248
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:29,220
he asked about the welfare and the father and so on and so forth, they have

249
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:35,020
no idea the reasoning of the questions and what it's going to lead to. They

250
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:39,700
could not know that Joseph, the prime minister of Egypt, would say Benjamin

251
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:44,260
must come or I will not see you. And so there's this dialogue that takes place

252
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:49,420
and we find that it's pretty clear that the boys say to Jacob, listen, the only

253
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:54,140
way we're going is if Benjamin comes with us. Because it's a waste of a trip

254
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:59,820
for us to go if Benjamin is not with us. He made it abundantly clear, the

255
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:05,620
expectation was known and therefore we must go, but if we must go, we must

256
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:10,100
take Benjamin with us. We find that Jacob gives instruction with regard to

257
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:14,940
preparing a gift to take to the man. Again, they don't know who the man is, but

258
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,620
they're gonna take, and you think about the gift that it's mentioned here in

259
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:21,900
verse number 11, the Bible says, and their father Israel said unto them, if it

260
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:26,660
must be so, now do this. Take the best fruits in the land in your vessels. It is

261
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:32,460
a famine. There's like nothing. They're gonna take the very little that they can

262
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:37,060
possibly put together so that they might be able to find grace or in favor in the

263
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:43,020
in the eyes of this man that is in charge and carry down the man a present,

264
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:47,460
a little balm and a little honey, spices and myrrh, nuts and almonds, and take

265
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:51,700
notice, double money. Why double money? Well, when they got home, the first time

266
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:56,540
the money was in their sacks, and so they're trying to do everything they can.

267
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:01,260
Jacob is trying to do everything he can to ensure that they can get food, but I

268
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:06,940
believe most importantly that Benjamin will return. That's his objective. We find

269
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:11,060
that in verse number 13, the Bible says, well let's back to verse 12 and take

270
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:14,060
double money in your hand and the money that was brought again in the mouth of

271
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:19,100
your sacks, carry it again in your hand. Peradventure, it was an oversight. Notice

272
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:24,140
verse 13, Jacob gives in. Take also your brother and arise, go again unto the man.

273
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:30,180
And God Almighty give you mercy before the man. By the way, Jacob knew the Lord.

274
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:36,340
He knew the the God of the universe, and he knew that God could give mercy. And he

275
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:41,900
says, God Almighty give mercy before the man that he may send you, send away your

276
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:47,780
other brother, that's Simeon and Benjamin. If I be bereaved of my children, I am

277
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:54,500
bereaved. Notice they're in a tough spot. I mean, if they don't send Benjamin,

278
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:59,740
they're just gonna die in Canaan. There's no food. There's a great famine. It's

279
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:06,860
soaring the land. They've eaten up all the food. And so they send a present, these

280
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:13,220
few things, and Benjamin. And we find that these ten brothers, they travel to

281
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:19,619
Egypt. Simeon and Joseph are in Egypt, one incarcerated, one the prime minister. And

282
00:14:19,619 --> 00:14:24,220
the ten brothers travel. And so we see the famine. We see really the events or

283
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:28,059
circumstances that lead to the second trip. As we notice and continue through

284
00:14:28,059 --> 00:14:34,899
chapter 43, in verses 16 through 34, notice with me the feast. The feast. It's

285
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:38,460
very interesting circumstances that take place. The Bible says in verse 15

286
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:42,700
that the men took that present. They took double money in their hand and Benjamin

287
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:46,339
and rose up and went down to Egypt and stood before Joseph. So they go. They know

288
00:14:46,339 --> 00:14:51,779
the process. They've been there once before. They know what they're to do and

289
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:56,380
they stand before Joseph. And notice the Bible says in verse 16 that Joseph saw

290
00:14:56,380 --> 00:15:00,940
Benjamin with them. He said to the ruler of the house, of his house, bring these

291
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:07,100
men home and slay and make ready for these men shall dine with me at noon.

292
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:12,220
And the man, it says in verse 17, did as Joseph bade. Joseph had great power. And

293
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:16,380
the man brought the men into Joseph's house. And then notice the phrase in

294
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:20,980
verse 18, and the men were afraid. I don't know all that's going through their

295
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:25,500
mind at this particular time, but I don't think they expect it to be invited to

296
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:29,860
this man's house. And there's a great feast. We won't take the time to read all

297
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:34,059
that is taking place here in chapter 43. You can read it on your own, but

298
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:39,500
understand that as they gather together, that these men that are afraid, they

299
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:43,460
begin to speak. They came near to the steward of Joseph's house in verse

300
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:47,380
number 19 and they communed with him at the door of the house and said, oh sir, we

301
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:51,179
came indeed down at the first time to buy food. Verse 21, it came to pass when

302
00:15:51,179 --> 00:15:55,460
we came to the inn that we opened our sacks and behold, every man's money was in

303
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:59,100
the mouth of a sack, our money in full weight. Notice what they say, and we have

304
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:03,899
brought it again in our hand. Just in case we're here because of the money

305
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:07,899
situation, we've already brought it back. I mean, they're concerned. They're

306
00:16:07,899 --> 00:16:12,300
afraid. They don't know why they're there. The Bible tells us that they

307
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:16,779
mentioned that they have other money in order to buy the provision. And notice in

308
00:16:16,779 --> 00:16:21,540
verse 23, this man that is mentioned the steward of Joseph's house in verse 19, he

309
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:27,220
says to the brothers, peace be to you. Fear not. Your God and the God of your

310
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:32,779
father have given you treasure in your sacks. I had your money and he brought

311
00:16:32,779 --> 00:16:37,179
Simeon out unto them. Now the reality is that they did have the money, but they

312
00:16:37,179 --> 00:16:42,740
returned the money. Joseph instructed them to do that and we find that they

313
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:48,899
bring Simeon. And then in verse 24, the man brought the men into Joseph's house

314
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:52,460
and they gave them water and they washed their feet and he gave their asses

315
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:57,339
And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon, for they heard that

316
00:16:57,339 --> 00:17:02,660
they should eat bread there. When Joseph came home, they brought him the present

317
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,899
which was in their hand into the house. And notice it says, and bowed themselves

318
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:10,059
to him to the earth. Remember the dreams that Joseph had? Begin to see the

319
00:17:10,059 --> 00:17:14,300
fulfillment of those dreams in this interaction here. In verse 27, he asked

320
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:18,020
them of their welfare and said, is your father well? The old man of whom you

321
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:23,260
spake, is he yet alive? You know why Joseph's inquiring, it's his dad. He's

322
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:26,500
concerned about the welfare of his father and he inquires and the Bible

323
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:30,580
says in verse 28 that they respond and they say, thy servant our father is in

324
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:33,940
good health, he is yet alive. And they bowed down their heads and made

325
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:38,420
obeisance. Again, the fulfillment of the dreams that we spoke about many weeks

326
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:43,339
ago in Genesis 37. And we find here that that they they bowed down their heads

327
00:17:43,339 --> 00:17:47,020
and they made obeisance. In verse 29, he lifted up his eyes and saw his brother

328
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:54,260
Benjamin, his mother's son. This is his only full brother. Remember the the house

329
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:59,220
of Jacob is a is a messed up house. We dealt with all the the children and what

330
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:03,860
have you and all of the the two wives and handmaids and so on and so forth

331
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:09,339
many months ago. And we see that his brother Benjamin is there and he says, is

332
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:13,660
this your younger brother of whom you spake unto me? And notice it's almost as

333
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:19,260
if Joseph could not contain himself. It's as if he shouts out, he says,

334
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:24,380
God be gracious unto thee my son. And then he made haste for his bowels did

335
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:27,779
yearn upon his brother and he saw it were to weep and he entered into his

336
00:18:27,779 --> 00:18:32,580
chamber and he wept there. As you look at this account and you see what's

337
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:37,739
happening, you see this feast and and you find how God is continuing to work and

338
00:18:37,739 --> 00:18:43,020
as God is using Joseph and orchestrating these circumstances, we find that God is

339
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:49,020
continuing to pursue these brothers and we find that the Bible tells us that

340
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:53,580
that Joseph then comes out after he had wept in his chamber and it says in verse

341
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:57,559
33 and they sat before him the firstborn according to his birthright and the

342
00:18:57,559 --> 00:19:01,140
youngest according to his youth and the men marveled one at another. Can you

343
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:06,340
imagine? I mean put yourself in the situation. There are ten of you and

344
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:12,940
you're seated around the table and you're seated in birth order. I mean God

345
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:17,940
is working. What is going on? How do they? Yeah, it's right. I mean

346
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:23,619
it's perfectly aligned and I begin to think as I study through these

347
00:19:23,619 --> 00:19:28,580
portions of Scripture and read these verses and see how God is working. He

348
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:32,940
took and sent messes. Joseph sends them food it says unto them from before him

349
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:38,059
but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of theirs. All the youngest

350
00:19:38,059 --> 00:19:42,059
brothers and siblings said praise the Lord, amen, because normally they just get

351
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:46,619
the scraps. They don't get very much but here Benjamin, I mean he gets a full

352
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:53,419
portion and it was a time the Bible says that they were merry with him. Now

353
00:19:53,419 --> 00:19:56,380
they still don't know who they're dining with. They don't know who they're

354
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:02,780
enjoying this feast with but it's not

355
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,460
as bad as they thought it might be.

356
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,680
When they were first invited to his house, they're afraid.

357
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:10,920
They don't know what's going on, and they're concerned, and they say, hey, we know that

358
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:17,080
when we left, our money was found in our sack, but we've brought it back.

359
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:24,080
Things kind of progress and kind of enjoying, but it's going to end at some point, and there's

360
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:30,120
got to be a measure of uncertainty and maybe assumption as to what's going to take place,

361
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:36,420
and we find that in verse, as we enter into the 44th chapter, that as we look at what's

362
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:42,500
taking place, it says that he commanded the steward of his house, so this is Joseph making

363
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:46,200
this commandment, and here's what he says.

364
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:54,900
In verse 1 of chapter 44, fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry.

365
00:20:54,900 --> 00:21:00,220
Put every man's money in his sack's mouth.

366
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,860
Doesn't end there.

367
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:06,160
And put my cup, verse 2, the silver cup.

368
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,160
You see the specific?

369
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:10,500
I mean, Joseph's making sure he knows what he's talking about.

370
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:17,240
He says, and put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his

371
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,620
corn money.

372
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:22,880
And he did, according to the word that Joseph had spoken, the steward obeyed the commandment

373
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,600
of Joseph, without any question, by the way.

374
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,140
It's a good lesson all in itself, the importance of obedience.

375
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:32,040
We find that the steward, he obeyed his master.

376
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:38,720
Joseph is the master, and Joseph gave the command, and the servant, this man, he did

377
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,040
what he was instructed to do.

378
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:46,800
The Bible says in verse 3, as soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away,

379
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,280
they and their asses.

380
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:52,280
Now, at this particular moment, they probably think we're in the clear.

381
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,840
I mean, we're leaving.

382
00:21:54,840 --> 00:22:01,760
They came, and they were able to succeed, and what their objective was, and they had

383
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:06,720
this meal, there's a famine that's going on, but they had this great feast, and now the

384
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,560
morning light comes, and they're going to depart.

385
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:12,880
And the Bible says when they were gone out of the city, in verse number 4, and not yet

386
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:18,440
far off, I mean, they didn't get very far, that Joseph said unto his steward, up, follow

387
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,440
after the men.

388
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:26,000
When thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?

389
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:32,800
Is not this it, in which my Lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth, ye have done

390
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,160
evil in so doing?

391
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:40,920
And he, that servant, overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.

392
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:48,400
Again, we see the obedience of this servant, as we find here in this portion of Scripture,

393
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:53,080
the steward of his house, and we find that as we enter into this 44th chapter, we've

394
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:58,920
spoken about the famine, and we see about the feast, but I want you to see the plea.

395
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,920
The plea.

396
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,840
And really, it's the plea of Judah.

397
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:07,800
He's the spokesman for the brothers, but we find that as the steward of the house, he

398
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:14,240
overtakes the brothers as they departed from the house of Joseph, and we find that they

399
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:20,040
say unto him, in verse number 7, Wherefore saith my Lord these words, God forbid that

400
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,080
thy servant should do according to this thing.

401
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:26,320
Behold the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto thee out of

402
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,740
the land of Canaan.

403
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:32,720
How then should we steal out of thy Lord's house silver or gold?

404
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,080
I mean, we're being accused of stealing, no, we didn't do this.

405
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:42,080
In verse number 9, notice what they say, they really, in verse number 9, they were so confident

406
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:47,480
that they suggest what the penalty should be, what the punishment should be, if it's

407
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:51,320
found that they're guilty.

408
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:58,320
With whomsoever thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my Lord's

409
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,520
bondmen.

410
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,960
That's pretty serious, is it not?

411
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:13,880
And he said, No, also let it be according unto your words.

412
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:20,040
He with whom it is found shall be my servant, and ye shall be blameless.

413
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:25,680
They said, The one in whom it's found, let him die, and all of us will be your servants.

414
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:29,500
And we find that the steward of the house, he says, No, here's how it's going to work.

415
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:36,080
With whomsoever it's found, that individual will be the servant, everyone else is blameless.

416
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:40,000
And they speedily took down every man of sack to the ground and opened every man of sack.

417
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,880
I mean, they're confident.

418
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,560
And he searched and began at the eldest and left at the youngest, and the last part of

419
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:53,560
verse 12, we use it as our title, and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.

420
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,280
The cup was found in Benjamin's sack.

421
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:05,280
The Bible says in verse 13 that they rent their clothes, I guess so, I guess so.

422
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:11,440
They rent their clothes and laid at every man his ass and returned to the city.

423
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:16,720
Jude and his brethren came to Joseph's house, for he was yet there, and they fell before

424
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,640
him on the ground.

425
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,480
Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done?

426
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,280
Wilt ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?

427
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:29,560
And Judah said, again, Judah, again, as I mentioned earlier, he's the spokesman.

428
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:34,520
We see that he's speaking to Jacob in chapter 43, and he's the one that's speaking on the

429
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,080
behalf of the brethren.

430
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,480
And it says that he says, What shall we say unto my Lord?

431
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,480
What shall we speak?

432
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,240
Or how shall we clear ourselves?

433
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:48,000
Notice what he says, God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants.

434
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,440
Listen, God always knew.

435
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:55,480
It's not as God found out in the fact that he discovered it, but really that he's making

436
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,120
it known.

437
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:02,240
He's exposing their wickedness.

438
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:09,600
We find that God is working, and God is continuing to pursue and to break Judah and the brethren.

439
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:14,480
And we find that as they evaluate, again, the circumstances, even as they did in that

440
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:21,360
first trip, as we studied in chapter 42, they reached the conclusion that God is doing this.

441
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,080
God is working.

442
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:32,000
God is dealing with us according to what happened 20 years earlier, at least 20 years earlier.

443
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:39,080
Notice, they say in verse 16, Behold, we are my Lord's servants, both we and he also

444
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,800
with whom the cup is found.

445
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,200
All of a sudden, they don't want Benjamin to die.

446
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,600
And of course, we know that that would be the case with regard to the commitment that

447
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:52,200
was made to Jacob with regard to returning Benjamin safely.

448
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:58,200
And we find that Judah says to Joseph, again, he doesn't know that it's Joseph, but he says

449
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:03,480
that God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants, behold, we are my Lord's servants,

450
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:08,520
both we and he also with whom the cup is found.

451
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:12,920
And he, Joseph, says, God forbid that I should do so.

452
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:18,320
But the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant.

453
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:23,800
And as for you, get you up in peace unto your father.

454
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:34,560
In verse number 17, Joseph offers to release everyone but Benjamin, but Judah protests.

455
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:40,360
Judah comes and speaks again to Joseph in protest to this offer that is made as Joseph

456
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,040
says that all of you are free to go.

457
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:47,320
Benjamin, he's the one that the cup was found in his sack.

458
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:50,080
He's the one that will remain here as my servant.

459
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:54,000
And Judah, in verse number 18, speaks up once again.

460
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,240
The Bible says that he came near unto him and he said, Oh, my Lord, let thy servant,

461
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:04,400
I pray thee, speak a word in my Lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant,

462
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,960
for thou art even as Pharaoh.

463
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:11,520
Begins to rehearse even from the very first trip.

464
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:15,960
My Lord asked his servants saying, have you a father or a brother?

465
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:20,600
He said unto my Lord, we have a father, an old man, a child of his old age, a little

466
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,600
one.

467
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:27,560
His brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.

468
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:32,440
And thou saidst unto thy servants, bring him down unto me that I may set mine eyes upon

469
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,960
him.

470
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:38,240
And we said unto my Lord, the lad cannot leave his father, for if he should leave his father,

471
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,440
his father would die.

472
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:44,840
Thou saidst unto thy servants, except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall

473
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,560
see my face no more.

474
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:51,840
It came to pass when we came up unto thy servant, my father, we told him the words of my Lord,

475
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,360
and our father said, go again and buy a little food.

476
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,160
Verse 26, we said, we cannot go down.

477
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:02,800
If our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down, for we may not see the man's face

478
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,120
except our youngest brother be with us.

479
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:10,680
And thy servant, my father, said unto us, ye know that my wife bear me two sons.

480
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:15,680
And the one went out for me, and I said, surely he is torn in pieces, and I saw him

481
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,240
not since."

482
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:20,280
Judah doesn't know that he's speaking to this one.

483
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:23,280
He doesn't know that he's speaking to Joseph.

484
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:29,920
It might be that, I mean, Joseph is hearing firsthand really what was communicated to

485
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:35,600
Jacob about Joseph's presumed death.

486
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:40,680
It says in verse number 29, and if you take this also from me, and mischief befall him,

487
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:46,520
ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.

488
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:51,120
Now therefore, when I come to thy servant, my father, and the lad be not with us, seeing

489
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:55,880
that his life is bound up in the lad's life, it shall come to pass when he seeth that the

490
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,520
lad is not with us, that he will die.

491
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,840
And thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs.

492
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:06,720
of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.

493
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,680
For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father,

494
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,900
saying, if I bring him not unto thee,

495
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:14,780
then I shall bear the blame to my father forever.

496
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,560
Notice verse 33.

497
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,320
Notice what Judah says.

498
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,320
Now, therefore, I pray thee,

499
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,320
let thy servant abide instead of the lad,

500
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,540
a bondman to my Lord,

501
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:28,460
and let the lad go up with his brethren.

502
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,160
And then he says this in verse 34,

503
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,240
for how shall I go to my father?

504
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,200
And the lad be not with me,

505
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,920
lest peradventure I see the evil

506
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:41,000
that shall come on my father.

507
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,100
Do you see a difference in Judah in chapter 44

508
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:48,860
versus what you find in previous interaction

509
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:53,860
as they came back to Jacob in chapter number 37,

510
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:57,020
when they began to share with Jacob

511
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:59,120
the fact that they found this coat.

512
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,480
They say in verse 32 of Genesis 37,

513
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,560
this have we found,

514
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:06,200
know now whether it be thy son's coat or no.

515
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,560
And it says in verse 33 of chapter 37 that he knew it.

516
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:12,360
Jacob knew it was the coat that he gave his son

517
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,220
and he knew it.

518
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:15,200
And he said, it is my son's coat.

519
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,000
An evil beast hath devoured him.

520
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,360
Joseph without doubt is rent in pieces.

521
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:23,200
And Jacob run his clothes and put sackcloth upon his loins.

522
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,060
He mourned for his son many days.

523
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:27,240
All his sons and his daughters rose up to comfort him,

524
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,080
but he refused to be comforted.

525
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,040
For he said, for I will go down into the grave

526
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:34,320
into my son mourning thus his father wept for him.

527
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:39,320
But we find in chapter 44, Judah's, there's a change.

528
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,440
God's been working.

529
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,800
20 years has passed.

530
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,200
Two trips to Egypt.

531
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,440
He's in Egypt.

532
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,680
He started to leave after a second trip,

533
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,520
but then all of these things came.

534
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:54,920
And we find that as Judah is standing there before Joseph

535
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,960
and he's really pleading with Joseph

536
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,200
and he's pouring out his heart

537
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,880
and he's sharing his concern for his father.

538
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,400
He's putting himself in a position where he says,

539
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,400
how shall I go up to my father in verse 34

540
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,040
and the lad be not with me?

541
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,000
Lest peradventure I see the evil

542
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,360
that should come on my father.

543
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,160
He didn't care about that in chapter 37.

544
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,840
He didn't care for a moment in chapter 37,

545
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,120
how Jacob would respond to the news,

546
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,880
to the belief that Joseph was dead.

547
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,280
God was working.

548
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,960
God was working.

549
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,760
They said, as we looked in chapter 44 in verse 16,

550
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:37,440
God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants.

551
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,840
And I believe that in verse 33, it reveals to us

552
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,800
as Judah is speaking there, true brokenness.

553
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,640
Notice what Judah says in verse 33.

554
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:54,640
Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide

555
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:58,200
instead of the lad a bondman to my Lord

556
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:01,480
and let the lad go up with his brethren.

557
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,000
You know what Judah's saying?

558
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,240
I'll take the punishment.

559
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,160
Let Benjamin go free.

560
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,440
I'll take the punishment.

561
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,920
The cup was not found in my sack.

562
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,480
It was found in his sack.

563
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:22,280
But pour the punishment, the wrath on me,

564
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,640
not on him, let him go.

565
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,920
I believe that's a great picture of brokenness.

566
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,920
I believe that as we look at this portion of Scripture

567
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,920
and we begin to understand how God is working

568
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,280
and what God is doing, and again, next week

569
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,480
on Sunday evening, we'll deal with chapter 45

570
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,080
and we'll understand how Joseph will reveal

571
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,880
his identity as brothers.

572
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,400
And I believe that Joseph was a man

573
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,800
that was sensitive to God's leading in his life.

574
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:52,720
And after this plea of Judah, after this interaction,

575
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,280
we find that Joseph realizes that,

576
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,120
and God gave direction that they're broken

577
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,760
and now is the time to reveal your identity.

578
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:07,040
But until that time, we find that God was working.

579
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:10,160
I wonder tonight, I ended the last message

580
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,920
about a month ago on, I believe it was December 10th,

581
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,560
that Sunday evening, and I talked about the fact

582
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,440
that God is at work, God is working.

583
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,000
He's pursuing, and I asked this question,

584
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,920
how is God working in your life?

585
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,480
Listen, the reality is that we can't hide anything from God.

586
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,360
You know, a lot of people try to hide things from God,

587
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,760
but you can't.

588
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:39,080
For 20 years, 20 years, that's a long time.

589
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,280
20 years is a long time.

590
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,640
For 20 years, they tried to live life,

591
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:48,600
suppressing what happened with Joseph.

592
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,000
They lived for 20 years.

593
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
They don't wanna talk about it.

594
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,120
They don't wanna deal with it.

595
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,520
They just wanna suppress it.

596
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,520
But God was working.

597
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,120
There's so many reasons that God was working

598
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,920
with regard to the famine in the land,

599
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,160
but one of them, no doubt,

600
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,080
is the brokenness of these brothers.

601
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,520
And we find that through the events that transpire

602
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,800
that these men, they stand there and they recognize

603
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,400
because of the events and the circumstances

604
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:21,480
that God is exposing their wickedness.

605
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,960
This evening, I'm thankful that heaven is my home.

606
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,960
I'm thankful that I'm heaven-bound,

607
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,920
but I want you to understand that you and I

608
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,560
can live our lives in such a way that displeases God.

609
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,200
God is not pleased with wickedness.

610
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,680
God is not pleased with sin.

611
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:46,720
God, listen, tonight, we understand our God is a holy God.

612
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,920
He is a thrice holy God.

613
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,840
And our God, who is a holy God,

614
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:57,440
said to us as his children that we're to be holy,

615
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,520
for he is holy.

616
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:03,600
That we're to be holy in all manner of conversation.

617
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,880
And we understand that we have a God,

618
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,480
we're not gonna ever be perfect.

619
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,800
We have a God who promises to forgive when we sin,

620
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,360
to be gracious and merciful.

621
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,040
We have an advocate with the Father,

622
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,520
Jesus Christ the righteous.

623
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,800
It's a wonderful Bible truth.

624
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,840
I've said this many times in this pulpit

625
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,000
that the truth of 1 John 2,

626
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,880
that we have an advocate with the Father

627
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,720
should cause each of us to rejoice,

628
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:31,560
that he never argues your innocence because you're guilty.

629
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,800
He simply says, I paid for it.

630
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:39,680
And if we confess, according to 1 John 1 and verse number 9,

631
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:44,040
he promises to cleanse us and to forgive us.

632
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,640
And we find that this evening,

633
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:49,840
there are some that live in this era

634
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,160
in which we're living in of Christianity

635
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,320
that have this idea that within Christendom,

636
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,320
that you can just live however you wanna live

637
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,040
and you can do whatever you wanna do.

638
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,480
And you're just going to heaven one day

639
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,920
and all's going to be fine.

640
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:06,080
Listen, understand that we're to walk worthy.

641
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,720
We're to please God.

642
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:11,000
Understand this evening that God knows

643
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,440
about sin in your life and in my life.

644
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:18,440
He knew what happened to Joseph.

645
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:21,440
Though they tried to devise a plan and cover it

646
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,560
and all that they tried to do,

647
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:27,400
all of the extent that they went through, God knew.

648
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,840
And in due time, God exposed.

649
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:38,640
I think as you consider back several messages,

650
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:43,840
when Rachel steals the idols of her father,

651
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,280
Jacob says, let them die.

652
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,120
He didn't even know that Rachel had them.

653
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,120
He had no idea.

654
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,520
Her father didn't find the idols because she lied,

655
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:03,600
but God knew that she had the idols.

656
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,480
I preached the message that particular text of scripture

657
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,480
is what's in your tent.

658
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,280
Because you know what's in your tent

659
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,960
and God knows what's in your tent.

660
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,640
Your spouse might not know what's in your tent.

661
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,400
Your parents might not know what's in your tent.

662
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,360
Your kids might not know what's in your tent,

663
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,560
but God knows and you know.

664
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,560
Amen.

665
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,040
Notice in Proverbs chapter 30, we'll finish,

666
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,400
or chapter 28, we'll finish with this tonight.

667
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,960
Our God pursues and our God works

668
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,800
because our God is a forgiving God.

669
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,240
You understand this evening

670
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,600
that as we enter into a relationship with God,

671
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,080
he's our father and we're his children,

672
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,400
that he wants our fellowship to be right.

673
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,080
The reality this evening is that for any one of us

674
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,680
that would say, I long to be close to God,

675
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:01,320
he desires more for your closeness

676
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,640
than we could ever desire for that closeness.

677
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,760
He desires for that fellowship.

678
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,400
And he wants, and we sing the song,

679
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,520
nothing between my soul and my savior.

680
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:16,200
And the reality is that our God, he's ready to pardon.

681
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,320
He's ready to forgive.

682
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:21,040
He's ready to forgive.

683
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,559
I hope that you can see in your mind's eye

684
00:39:25,559 --> 00:39:28,280
as you consider those truths of our,

685
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,600
the character of our God,

686
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,600
being ready to pardon and ready to forgive.

687
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:35,000
God is not standing and standing back and saying,

688
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,480
nope, I'm not gonna forgive him this time.

689
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,520
I'm not gonna do it this time.

690
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,000
God is ready to pardon.

691
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,680
He's a God that is full of compassion.

692
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,440
He's a God who is full of mercy.

693
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,080
But the reality is that if we try to cover our sin,

694
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,600
we're not gonna prosper.

695
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,559
The Bible says here in Proverbs 28 and verse number 13,

696
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:03,120
he that covereth his sins shall prosper.

697
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:11,660
not prosper." Can I tell you this evening, you're not going to be the first one to prove

698
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:23,980
that verse wrong. You're just not. Amen? God said, He that covereth his sins shall

699
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:33,540
not prosper. Did you ever study the life of David? Did David try to cover his sin?

700
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:40,520
He went through great length to try to cover his sin. Did he not? I mean, he did really

701
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:48,300
everything within his power to cover his sin. But God knew about his sin. God sent a prophet

702
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:54,340
by the name of Nathan. Nathan tells him a little story. You know what David's response

703
00:40:54,340 --> 00:41:02,600
is to that story? Let that man die. Yeah. And Nathan stands there and I can see in my

704
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:11,660
mind's eye the boldness of the prophet of God who said, Thou art the man. But the beautiful

705
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:18,700
thing about David is you look in Psalm 51, he didn't continue to try to cover his sin.

706
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:26,060
He sought the forgiveness of God. In the beginning, he tried to cover his sin. But after the prophet

707
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:31,780
of God comes and exposes it, he gets it right. We see here the Bible says, He that covereth

708
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:40,260
his sins shall not prosper. But notice, whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have

709
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:48,560
mercy. I'm thankful for God's mercy. The reality this evening is that all of us have been recipients

710
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:54,620
of God's mercy. Our God is rich in mercy. And we find this evening that we could be

711
00:41:54,620 --> 00:42:00,340
on one side or the other of this verse of Scripture. The reality tonight is that every

712
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:08,500
single one of us has sin. Amen? None of us are sinless. Sometimes we might like to think

713
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:17,160
we are. But you're not. And neither am I. So what do we do with our sin? How do we handle

714
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:23,540
our sin? Do we cover it or do we confess it? Because really those are the only two options.

715
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:26,660
And if we cover it, we know that the Bible says we're not going to prosper. But if we

716
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:32,900
confess it, we know that the Bible says that we shall have mercy. Which side of the equation

717
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:41,940
would you like to be on? I'd like to be on the one of receiving mercy. Amen? In Psalm

718
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:47,820
51, I know that I said that we'd end in Proverbs 28, but in Psalm 51, I won't read the entirety

719
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:54,520
of this Psalm. It's 19 verses. But I want you to see in this portion of Scripture that

720
00:42:54,520 --> 00:43:01,560
David, after his sin is exposed and after Nathan stands and says, Thou art the man,

721
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:06,520
he did everything he could to cover it, but God knew. Listen, you're going to drive yourself

722
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:12,320
crazy trying to cover your sin. And you could never do it. You just can't. You say, well,

723
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:19,920
I got the wool pulled over their eyes. My parents don't know. God knows. God knows.

724
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:32,400
My spouse has no idea. God knows. These ten boys, nine of them, well, yeah, ten of them,

725
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:39,160
for twenty years thought nobody knows what we did with Joseph. No one knows. Dad thinks

726
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:48,040
he's dead. He has no idea what happened. God knows. In Psalm 51, the Bible says that David,

727
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:54,440
this is his prayer of repentance, have mercy upon me, O God. What a sweet way to start

728
00:43:54,440 --> 00:44:01,720
the prayer. Whoso confesseth shall have mercy. We just read it in Proverbs 28. According

729
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:08,800
to thy lovingkindness, aren't you thankful that our God is merciful, his lovingkindness?

730
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:15,520
According unto the multitude of thy tender mercies, blot out my transgressions. Wash

731
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:23,200
me, notice what he says, throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. For

732
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:30,040
I acknowledge my transgressions and my sin is ever before me. Against thee, thee only,

733
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:36,280
have I sinned and done this evil in thy sight, that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest

734
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:43,040
and be clear when thou judgest. I don't have time to read the entirety of the psalm. But

735
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:47,880
I want you to understand this evening, as we look at an account in Genesis 43 and 44,

736
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:52,080
you can look at what Joseph did and how he instructed his steward and what have you.

737
00:44:52,080 --> 00:45:01,320
God was working. God was pursuing those brothers, those men. And God brought Judah to a place

738
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:10,120
of brokenness. That Judah, he came to the place and said, let Benjamin go, I'll take

739
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:18,520
the punishment. And I just wonder tonight, as we think about that picture of brokenness

740
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:23,960
and we understand that in this same psalm, in Psalm 51, in verse 17, it says, the sacrifices

741
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:35,080
of God are a broken spirit, a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.

742
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:41,880
Then in verse 19, shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness with burnt

743
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:48,560
offering and whole burnt offerings, then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar. You

744
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:55,760
can try to do all kinds of outward things, but if your heart's not right, God's not pleased.

745
00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:00,120
You can read it of the nation of Israel, you can read it of Judah. You know what God says

746
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:07,720
to Israel and Judah about their sacrifices? Stop bringing them. Just stop bringing them.

747
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:12,000
You say, but God's the one that instructed them to bring them. Sure He is, with a right

748
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:19,000
heart. He said, you draw nigh to me with your lips, but your heart's far from me. And God

749
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,480
said, stop bringing those sacrifices, get your heart right. It's not about going through

750
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:31,160
the motions, it's not about doing outward things. God said, a broken spirit, a broken

751
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:36,760
and a contrite heart. God worked in the lives of those brethren.

752
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:45,000
That second trip to Egypt, it was an important trip. They don't make it back home until after

753
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,560
Joseph reveals his identity in chapter 45. We'll look at that next week. But I want you

754
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:53,920
to just think about it tonight. Is there anything between my soul and my Savior? Is

755
00:46:53,920 --> 00:47:01,960
there sin in my life? We're all sinners. Are we covering? Are we confessing? Do we understand

756
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:07,200
the equation as Proverbs 28, as I reference it that way tonight? If we're covering, we're

757
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:15,200
not going to prosper. You say, nobody knows. God knows. That ought to convict you. And

758
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:19,960
when you understand His mercy and His loving kindness, it ought to cause you to throw yourself

759
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:27,240
on the altar of God and say, God, have mercy. Against thee and thee only have I sinned and

760
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:32,120
done this wickedness in thy sight. And God said, He'll forgive you and He'll cleanse

761
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:37,240
you. That's a wonderful promise of God's Word. You try to dance around and say, I'm not really

762
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:44,320
the guilty one, I'm innocent, I'm this, I'm that. No, no, no. Just acknowledge your guilt.

763
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:49,320
God already paid for it and He'll forgive. Let's pray. Father, we love You. Thank You

764
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:59,280
for loving us. God, thank You for this passage of Scripture, two chapters, and we see the

765
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:09,480
events and we can look at the account historically. God, I pray for each of us tonight to make

766
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:15,480
some application in our lives. God, I'm not sure tonight how You're working in the hearts

767
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:23,560
of Your people, but God, I pray that You'd have Your will and way. I pray that we'd be

768
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:31,440
humble. Lord, I pray that if there's sin in our lives, that we'd confess it and forsake

769
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:39,200
it. God, if someone's trying to cover, hide their sin, I pray, God, that You would help

770
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:50,120
them to understand the futility of that endeavor. They just wave the white flag of surrender

771
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:57,840
and get their heart right with You. I pray that in these moments of invitation that You'd

772
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:02,120
have Your will and way. We'll thank You for it. Would You stand with me?
