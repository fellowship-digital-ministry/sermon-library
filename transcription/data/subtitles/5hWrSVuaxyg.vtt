WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.639
number 15, 1 Samuel chapter number 15 this evening, and we'll be looking specifically

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:11.279
at a statement from verse number 22. I'll give some background introduction to the

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:18.079
entirety here of 1 Samuel 15 and get into the message this evening. Many of us are familiar

00:00:18.079 --> 00:00:24.159
with 1 Samuel 15. It's in verse number 22 that Samuel said, half the Lord is great delight in

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:30.879
burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord. And then it says this,

00:00:30.879 --> 00:00:40.639
behold, to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of rams. I've titled the

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:48.159
message this evening there from verse number 22, to obey is better. To obey is better. Again,

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:52.799
this is a familiar passage of scripture, that account that is recorded for us here in 1 Samuel

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:58.880
15. Of course, we know that Saul had been given some specific instructions from the Lord. As I

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:04.720
begin to look at 1 Samuel 15 and look at the instructions that God provides, I find that

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.480
there's really nothing complicated nor confusing about the instructions. It's very straightforward.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.519
It's very clear. And by the way, I'm thankful for the clarity that God provides. I'm thankful

00:01:15.519 --> 00:01:22.480
that God has given us, in His Word, truth. He's provided us with instruction. He's given us

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.199
warning. And I'm thankful for the clarity that He gives us. Not only were these instructions

00:01:27.199 --> 00:01:32.800
not complicated, they were not confusing. And then I would say this, Samuel was very clear

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:40.239
in communicating to Saul that these instructions were from the Lord. This was not Samuel just

00:01:40.239 --> 00:01:45.199
coming up with some idea that I'm going to tell Saul what to do and I'm going to give Saul some

00:01:45.199 --> 00:01:50.800
direction as the prophet of the Lord. No, Samuel makes it abundantly clear in the first

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:59.040
opening verses of 1 Samuel 15 that this instruction is from God Almighty. And I'm

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.639
thankful that as we look at the Word of God, as we study the scriptures, the Bible says that all

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:10.960
scripture is given by inspiration of God. And then it tells us that it's profitable for us.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.199
And we begin to think about the fact that all scripture is given by inspiration of God.

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:21.119
The reality is that when you go to the Word of God, there are portions, even as we see here,

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:27.119
where the Bible will say, thus saith the Lord, and how we ought to take heed when we see that

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:32.880
terminology. But the truth of the matter is that all of this book is God-breathed.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:39.440
And so there are some people that would look at various aspects of Christian living, of Bible

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:46.240
living, and they say, well, it doesn't say, thus saith the Lord. Just stop that. Just take it as

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:53.520
this is God's Word and we must take God at His Word. But Samuel makes it abundantly clear. Notice

00:02:53.520 --> 00:03:00.800
in verse number one, Samuel also said unto Saul, the Lord sent me to anoint thee to be king over

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:08.000
his people, over Israel. So he's talking about past experience. He's talking about the way that

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.119
God had sent him, Samuel, to anoint Saul to be the next king or to be the first king of Israel.

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:19.919
And we find that he references that past experience. If you would go back several

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:25.360
chapters of the book of 1 Samuel, you'll read of all of that and how God brought that to pass.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:33.759
And we find that he continues and says this, now therefore hearken thou unto the voice

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:42.720
of the words of the Lord. Now the same God that sent me to anoint you Saul to be king of Israel,

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:49.600
that same God has a message for you. That same God is giving you some instruction.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:55.119
Notice he says again in verse number two, thus saith the Lord. He already said in verse number

00:03:55.119 --> 00:04:01.279
one, hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the Lord. And now he says in verse number two,

00:04:01.279 --> 00:04:07.119
thus saith the Lord of hosts. I remember that which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid weight

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:14.320
for him in the way when he came up from Egypt. Now go and smite Amalek and utterly destroy all

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:19.119
that they have and spare them not, but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep,

00:04:19.119 --> 00:04:24.320
camel and ass. And so it says that Saul gathered the people together in verse number four,

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:31.200
numbered them in Telam, 200,000 foot men and 10,000 men of Judah. And Saul then comes to the

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:36.959
city of Amalek and laid weight in the valley there in verse number five. But we find the clarity of

00:04:36.959 --> 00:04:44.160
the instruction that is provided. And we find that God is giving Saul very clear instruction.

00:04:45.359 --> 00:04:52.079
And this instruction that he gives him is clear. It is concise. Again, it's not complicated.

00:04:52.079 --> 00:04:59.600
And we find that Saul receives the instruction. He receives the commandment of the Lord by the

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:06.959
prophet of God, Samuel. But as you study 1 Samuel 15, you'll find that he failed to obey.

00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:15.519
You find that Saul, he did not obey the Lord. Notice in verse number seven, it says that Saul

00:05:15.519 --> 00:05:20.959
smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest to Shur. That is over against Egypt. And

00:05:20.959 --> 00:05:26.160
he took Agag, the king of the Amalekites, alive and utterly destroyed all the people at the edge

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:33.440
of the sword. But Saul and the people spared Agag and the best of the sheep and of the oxen and of

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:39.839
the fatlings and the lambs and all that was good and would not utterly destroy them. But everything

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:47.279
that was vile and refuse that they destroyed utterly. Now, Saul isn't going to get away with

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:53.519
it, is he? Samuel's not there, but the word of the Lord came unto Samuel in verse number 10.

00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:57.679
And notice what God says, it repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king,

00:05:58.239 --> 00:06:06.160
for he has turned back from following me and hath not performed my commandments.

00:06:07.839 --> 00:06:14.079
Hath not performed my commandments. He failed to obey. I want you to notice as a side note this

00:06:14.079 --> 00:06:21.119
evening, at the end of verse number 11, it says, and it grieved Samuel and he cried unto the Lord

00:06:21.119 --> 00:06:26.799
all night. I could really preach a message from the last statement of verse number 11.

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:34.239
And here's the truth of what I see in Samuel's life. Samuel was a spiritual leader. Samuel was

00:06:34.239 --> 00:06:40.559
a prophet of the Lord that God had called and God had commissioned. God had given him clear

00:06:40.559 --> 00:06:47.519
instruction with regard to his role in Israel's history and his influence in the lives of those

00:06:47.519 --> 00:06:54.559
that he was called to minister to. You find that Samuel took his service very seriously.

00:06:54.559 --> 00:07:00.239
You find that as he was serving God, that when the people asked for a king, it grieved Samuel's heart.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:06.720
You find that Samuel says, God forbid that I should sin against the Lord and failing, ceasing

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:13.519
to pray for you. Samuel was a man of God and Samuel was a spiritual leader and the spiritual

00:07:13.519 --> 00:07:22.959
leader is devastated at the disobedience of the king. His heart is broken because of the disobedience.

00:07:23.839 --> 00:07:31.920
It grieved his heart. The Bible says that it grieved Samuel and notice he cried unto the Lord

00:07:32.799 --> 00:07:43.200
all night. I love the sensitivity of Samuel. I love the heart of Samuel. He was concerned for

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:50.079
Saul. He was concerned that the people of God would obey the word of God. By the way,

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:58.959
a spiritual leader ought to have that kind of heart. Amen? And we see here in Samuel that he

00:07:58.959 --> 00:08:05.200
cries all night. He then rises early to go meet Saul in the morning. Notice it says in verse 13

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:10.079
that Samuel came to Saul and Saul said unto him, blessed be thou of the Lord.

00:08:10.079 --> 00:08:18.959
And then notice what he says, I have performed the commandment of the Lord. And Samuel said,

00:08:18.959 --> 00:08:23.679
what meaneth then this bleeding of the sheep in mine ears and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:29.839
We find that Saul really in verse number 13 as he makes the statement that I have performed the

00:08:29.839 --> 00:08:34.640
commandment of the Lord, that really there's a measure of self-deception that's taking place

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:42.000
here. We find that Saul has justified his disobedience. We've often said this over the

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.640
years that partial obedience is disobedience. We cannot pick and choose what part of God's

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:53.119
word or commandment we want to obey. We don't go to the word of God and say, well, I like

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:57.359
this one over here and that kind of fits with what I want to do and so I'm going to obey it.

00:08:57.359 --> 00:09:04.080
But over here, no, I'm not really interested in that. And no, no, no, it's God's word and we obey.

00:09:05.359 --> 00:09:10.239
As you continue to move through the text of scripture, Samuel says to Saul in verse 16,

00:09:10.239 --> 00:09:14.400
stay and I will tell thee what the Lord hath said to me this night. And he said unto him,

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:18.400
say on. And Samuel said, when thou wast little in thine own sight, I dealt with that this morning

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:23.200
briefly, whilst thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel and the Lord anointed the king

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:28.400
over Israel. And the Lord sent me on a journey and said, go and utterly destroy the sinners,

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:34.400
the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed. Wherefore then didst thou not obey the

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:39.760
voice of the Lord, but didst fly upon the spoil and didst evil in the sight of the Lord. See,

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:43.840
sometimes what happens in our lives is we don't look at disobedience as being evil.

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:54.479
And he says, you did evil in the sight of the Lord. And Saul said unto Samuel, yea, I have

00:09:54.479 --> 00:09:59.919
obeyed the voice of the Lord and have gone the way which the Lord sent me and have brought Agath.

00:09:59.919 --> 00:10:03.599
the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites."

00:10:03.599 --> 00:10:07.899
Well, no, no, that's not what God told you to do.

00:10:07.899 --> 00:10:11.059
He's deceived Himself.

00:10:11.059 --> 00:10:14.679
And we find that He then blames.

00:10:14.679 --> 00:10:16.859
It says, but the people, in verse number 21,

00:10:16.859 --> 00:10:20.279
took of the spoil sheep and oxen, the chief of the things,

00:10:20.279 --> 00:10:22.779
which should have been utterly destroyed,

00:10:22.779 --> 00:10:28.279
to sacrifice unto the Lord thy God in Gilgal.

00:10:28.599 --> 00:10:31.499
There's excuse and there's justification.

00:10:31.499 --> 00:10:34.159
We find that there's a shift of blame.

00:10:34.159 --> 00:10:35.939
It's their fault.

00:10:35.939 --> 00:10:37.779
The reason that I disobeyed is because

00:10:37.779 --> 00:10:39.119
they want it to keep...

00:10:39.119 --> 00:10:40.379
You see what's happening.

00:10:40.379 --> 00:10:43.279
We're familiar with the passage of Scripture.

00:10:43.279 --> 00:10:47.339
And we find that as this event unfolds,

00:10:47.339 --> 00:10:49.839
that Samuel, we read it by way of introduction

00:10:49.839 --> 00:10:51.159
in verse number 22,

00:10:51.159 --> 00:10:53.559
Samuel speaks to Saul

00:10:53.559 --> 00:10:55.959
and he gives him this principle,

00:10:56.439 --> 00:11:00.879
this statement, this truth that continues to this very day

00:11:00.879 --> 00:11:03.959
to be impactful for the people of God.

00:11:03.959 --> 00:11:06.559
Notice again what he says in verse number 22.

00:11:06.559 --> 00:11:10.019
Samuel said, after hearing all that Saul said,

00:11:10.019 --> 00:11:12.439
all of the excuse and the justification

00:11:12.439 --> 00:11:16.639
and why they kept these things,

00:11:16.639 --> 00:11:20.379
that they were going to keep the spoil,

00:11:20.379 --> 00:11:22.379
the sheep, the oxen, the chief of the things,

00:11:22.379 --> 00:11:24.579
that they should have been destroyed,

00:11:24.599 --> 00:11:26.359
but we've saved them, we've spared them

00:11:26.359 --> 00:11:29.659
so that we could sacrifice unto the Lord thy God in Gilgal.

00:11:29.659 --> 00:11:32.619
Samuel says, half the Lord

00:11:34.019 --> 00:11:39.019
as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices

00:11:39.679 --> 00:11:44.679
as in obeying the voice of the Lord.

00:11:47.779 --> 00:11:51.499
God is the one that implemented and ordained

00:11:51.499 --> 00:11:54.199
burnt offerings and sacrifices.

00:11:54.199 --> 00:11:55.759
Correct?

00:11:55.759 --> 00:11:57.959
That was not the idea of man.

00:11:57.959 --> 00:12:00.619
That was not Moses that just was sitting around one day

00:12:00.619 --> 00:12:04.759
and decided that he'd provide this elaborate instruction

00:12:04.759 --> 00:12:05.719
for offerings.

00:12:05.719 --> 00:12:09.959
No, this was God that had given the truth to his people

00:12:09.959 --> 00:12:12.919
with regard to offerings and sacrifices,

00:12:12.919 --> 00:12:15.839
but we find that God is using Samuel

00:12:15.839 --> 00:12:18.719
to give this revelation to Saul

00:12:18.719 --> 00:12:20.959
and it's been preserved for us this evening

00:12:20.959 --> 00:12:25.639
that God has greater delight in obedience,

00:12:25.639 --> 00:12:27.819
in obeying the voice of the Lord

00:12:27.819 --> 00:12:30.619
than in burnt offerings and sacrifices.

00:12:30.619 --> 00:12:34.219
We cannot disobey the voice of God and say,

00:12:34.219 --> 00:12:37.739
well, we're disobeying in order to do this.

00:12:39.299 --> 00:12:42.139
And he concludes in verse number 22 by saying this,

00:12:42.139 --> 00:12:46.979
behold, to obey is better than sacrifice

00:12:46.979 --> 00:12:50.599
and to hearken than the fat of rams.

00:12:50.599 --> 00:12:53.439
To obey is better, is better.

00:12:54.339 --> 00:12:58.499
We're familiar with the word of God

00:12:58.499 --> 00:13:00.039
and we're familiar with the examples

00:13:00.039 --> 00:13:03.019
throughout the scriptures of those who obeyed

00:13:03.019 --> 00:13:04.459
and those who did not obey.

00:13:05.519 --> 00:13:07.379
We could go around the room this evening

00:13:07.379 --> 00:13:09.459
and we could take testimony and example

00:13:09.459 --> 00:13:14.159
of those that we've read of that disobeyed the Lord

00:13:14.159 --> 00:13:16.719
and the consequences of their disobedience.

00:13:16.719 --> 00:13:18.939
We could read of those and testify of those

00:13:18.939 --> 00:13:21.499
that obeyed the Lord and the consequences

00:13:21.499 --> 00:13:23.759
of their obedience, the blessing of God

00:13:23.759 --> 00:13:26.979
in their life because of obedience.

00:13:26.979 --> 00:13:29.799
We understand what it is to obey humanly

00:13:29.799 --> 00:13:32.519
when we think about living in this temporal world

00:13:32.519 --> 00:13:34.559
and we understand that we are faced

00:13:34.559 --> 00:13:37.159
with laws and regulations

00:13:37.159 --> 00:13:38.919
and we understand what it is to obey

00:13:38.919 --> 00:13:43.519
and we understand the consequences of disobedience.

00:13:43.519 --> 00:13:47.439
And we understand what it is to teach our children to obey

00:13:47.459 --> 00:13:51.019
and we understand as we would even use the terminology

00:13:51.019 --> 00:13:53.779
and have them quote, children obey your parents

00:13:53.779 --> 00:13:55.819
and the Lord for this is right.

00:13:57.059 --> 00:14:00.059
And we understand this concept of obedience.

00:14:00.059 --> 00:14:02.859
We understand the concept of authority

00:14:02.859 --> 00:14:06.659
and structure and rules if you will.

00:14:06.659 --> 00:14:08.979
And God gives commandment.

00:14:08.979 --> 00:14:10.579
And by the way, let me say this,

00:14:10.579 --> 00:14:13.379
I am so thankful that God's given us his word.

00:14:14.359 --> 00:14:18.519
I am so thankful that when we go to the word of God

00:14:18.519 --> 00:14:23.239
that God has provided us with instruction for our living.

00:14:23.239 --> 00:14:25.919
He's provided us with instruction that helps us

00:14:25.919 --> 00:14:29.279
to understand what it is that we can do

00:14:29.279 --> 00:14:31.259
in our lives that will please him.

00:14:32.159 --> 00:14:35.039
He's also given us instruction and warning

00:14:35.039 --> 00:14:36.839
with regard to those things that we would do

00:14:36.839 --> 00:14:38.879
that displease him.

00:14:38.879 --> 00:14:40.679
I'm thankful for the word of God.

00:14:41.659 --> 00:14:44.939
And we find that as we consider the subject

00:14:44.939 --> 00:14:47.559
of obedience this evening, I would say this,

00:14:47.559 --> 00:14:50.519
aren't you thankful that God's creation obeys him?

00:14:51.419 --> 00:14:52.919
God's creation obeys him.

00:14:54.659 --> 00:14:57.819
And God's people should obey him as well.

00:14:57.819 --> 00:15:00.579
I understand that God made us with a free will.

00:15:00.579 --> 00:15:01.579
I understand that.

00:15:02.679 --> 00:15:06.479
But just as creation obeys the creator,

00:15:06.479 --> 00:15:10.439
we as the redeemed people of God, we ought to obey him.

00:15:11.499 --> 00:15:12.459
I want you to think about this,

00:15:12.459 --> 00:15:14.419
and we're not gonna turn to each of these passages,

00:15:14.419 --> 00:15:16.659
but I want you to think about the raven

00:15:18.119 --> 00:15:20.499
in 1 Kings chapter number 17.

00:15:20.499 --> 00:15:22.919
Elijah was sent to a brook.

00:15:24.179 --> 00:15:25.819
And God says this to Elijah,

00:15:25.819 --> 00:15:30.599
I have commanded there a raven to feed thee.

00:15:31.619 --> 00:15:34.019
You think Elijah was thankful that raven obeyed?

00:15:35.759 --> 00:15:36.599
Right?

00:15:38.139 --> 00:15:39.279
That raven came.

00:15:40.819 --> 00:15:41.719
Brought him food.

00:15:42.739 --> 00:15:43.779
That raven came.

00:15:43.779 --> 00:15:44.619
A raven.

00:15:46.459 --> 00:15:48.419
Close to a crow.

00:15:48.419 --> 00:15:50.499
Not exactly, but close enough.

00:15:50.499 --> 00:15:53.299
And we got a bunch of crows around here, drive me crazy.

00:15:55.459 --> 00:15:56.299
But a raven.

00:15:58.219 --> 00:15:59.519
It's God's creation.

00:16:00.919 --> 00:16:04.379
And God says to Elijah, I've commanded him.

00:16:04.379 --> 00:16:06.059
I've commanded that raven.

00:16:06.959 --> 00:16:11.039
I think about the great fish, or the whale,

00:16:11.039 --> 00:16:12.079
in the book of Jonah.

00:16:14.079 --> 00:16:17.159
God says in the first chapter, in verse number 17,

00:16:17.159 --> 00:16:20.319
that he prepared a great fish to swallow Jonah

00:16:20.319 --> 00:16:22.199
after Jonah was cast overboard.

00:16:22.199 --> 00:16:23.719
Remember the mariners, they at first

00:16:23.719 --> 00:16:25.799
didn't wanna cast Jonah overboard, right?

00:16:25.799 --> 00:16:29.559
They were reluctant to follow what Jonah said,

00:16:29.559 --> 00:16:31.659
and they finally cast him overboard,

00:16:31.659 --> 00:16:34.719
and God had prepared a great fish.

00:16:34.739 --> 00:16:35.819
And then in chapter number two,

00:16:35.819 --> 00:16:38.099
after God got his attention, all that takes place there

00:16:38.099 --> 00:16:39.859
in chapter number two, you come to verse number 10,

00:16:39.859 --> 00:16:42.579
and the Bible says that God told the great fish,

00:16:42.579 --> 00:16:45.579
the whale, to spew him out.

00:16:45.579 --> 00:16:46.419
And guess what?

00:16:46.419 --> 00:16:49.199
You think Jonah was glad that that whale obeyed?

00:16:49.199 --> 00:16:50.819
Can you imagine if the whale disobeyed

00:16:50.819 --> 00:16:52.619
the same way Jonah did?

00:16:52.619 --> 00:16:54.139
And instead of, I mean, think about it.

00:16:54.139 --> 00:16:54.979
What did Jonah do?

00:16:54.979 --> 00:16:56.819
He went in the opposite direction

00:16:56.819 --> 00:16:58.739
of what God commanded him to do.

00:16:58.739 --> 00:17:01.099
What if that whale had gone out to sea

00:17:01.099 --> 00:17:02.459
instead of up to the shore?

00:17:03.459 --> 00:17:05.759
Right?

00:17:05.759 --> 00:17:10.139
No Jonah getting to Nineveh and preaching, right?

00:17:10.139 --> 00:17:12.039
But no, the great fish obeyed.

00:17:12.999 --> 00:17:14.319
It obeyed.

00:17:14.319 --> 00:17:15.959
Think about this, when the disciples,

00:17:15.959 --> 00:17:18.159
as you study the Gospel accounts,

00:17:18.159 --> 00:17:20.899
and you read of the great storm.

00:17:22.479 --> 00:17:26.759
Master, carest thou not that we perish?

00:17:26.759 --> 00:17:30.839
And Jesus comes and says, peace, be still.

00:17:30.839 --> 00:17:32.499
And what happens?

00:17:32.499 --> 00:17:37.499
The wind and the waves, they obey him.

00:17:38.959 --> 00:17:42.499
And they say this, what matter of man is this,

00:17:42.499 --> 00:17:45.699
that even the winds and the waves obey him?

00:17:45.699 --> 00:17:50.699
He's God, he's the creator, he is the sustainer.

00:17:51.939 --> 00:17:55.779
Everything is held in the power of his hand,

00:17:55.779 --> 00:17:58.099
and the winds and the waves obey him.

00:17:58.099 --> 00:17:59.919
You know, the demons obeyed him.

00:18:00.819 --> 00:18:02.019
The demons obeyed.

00:18:02.019 --> 00:18:05.099
You read Mark chapter one and verse number 27,

00:18:05.099 --> 00:18:07.939
and you read how the demons obeyed God, why?

00:18:07.939 --> 00:18:11.299
Because he is the one with all authority and all power,

00:18:11.299 --> 00:18:12.859
and they are subject unto him.

00:18:13.779 --> 00:18:16.699
And begin to think about these examples this evening,

00:18:16.699 --> 00:18:19.179
and I begin to think about this text of Scripture

00:18:19.179 --> 00:18:23.039
in 1 Samuel 15, when God uses Samuel

00:18:23.039 --> 00:18:26.619
to confront Saul about his disobedience,

00:18:26.619 --> 00:18:31.619
and he says to obey is better.

00:18:31.799 --> 00:18:33.239
I'll give you a couple of thoughts this evening.

00:18:33.239 --> 00:18:37.000
Number one, if you're taking notes, obedience is critical.

00:18:37.959 --> 00:18:39.559
Obedience is critical.

00:18:39.559 --> 00:18:43.320
This evening, we think about the walk

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:44.719
that we have with the Lord,

00:18:44.719 --> 00:18:48.479
and we think about this truth of walking in obedience,

00:18:48.479 --> 00:18:50.979
and the critical aspect of that.

00:18:50.979 --> 00:18:54.179
We sing the song, trust and obey.

00:18:55.019 --> 00:18:56.200
He is trustworthy.

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:57.279
He's never failed.

00:18:57.279 --> 00:18:58.880
Aren't you thankful for that?

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:00.959
He's never failed you one time,

00:19:00.959 --> 00:19:03.320
and he's never going to fail you,

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:05.119
and because he is trustworthy,

00:19:05.119 --> 00:19:07.159
we ought to respond in obedience.

00:19:07.159 --> 00:19:11.599
We understand this evening that God blesses obedience.

00:19:11.599 --> 00:19:13.200
That is a principle that's found

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:15.760
throughout the entirety of the Word of God.

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:19.519
He blesses obedience, and when I think about the fact

00:19:19.519 --> 00:19:21.119
that obedience is critical,

00:19:21.119 --> 00:19:22.880
and we begin to think about the Word of God,

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:24.099
turn to the book of Deuteronomy.

00:19:24.099 --> 00:19:27.299
Maybe you want to jot it down to read Leviticus 26 later.

00:19:27.299 --> 00:19:28.899
I won't take the time this evening

00:19:28.899 --> 00:19:30.599
to look at Leviticus 26,

00:19:30.599 --> 00:19:32.739
but you go through the entirety of that passage,

00:19:32.739 --> 00:19:35.779
and it's quite interesting to see how God makes it

00:19:35.779 --> 00:19:39.619
so abundantly clear to his people

00:19:39.619 --> 00:19:42.539
on the critical aspect of obedience,

00:19:42.539 --> 00:19:44.419
and here's what I'll do if you obey,

00:19:44.419 --> 00:19:45.940
and here's what the consequences

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:47.200
are going to be of disobedience,

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:48.899
but look here in Deuteronomy 11.

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:51.779
A familiar passage of Scripture.

00:19:51.799 --> 00:19:53.679
I want you to begin in verse 26.

00:19:55.159 --> 00:19:56.679
Of course, the people of God

00:19:56.679 --> 00:19:59.679
have seen God work miraculously.

00:19:59.679 --> 00:20:02.679
are now ready to enter into the land of promise,

00:20:02.679 --> 00:20:05.559
and God has given them once again

00:20:05.559 --> 00:20:08.079
the opportunity to be instructed

00:20:08.079 --> 00:20:10.279
as they would just prepare

00:20:10.279 --> 00:20:12.239
for entering into the land of promise.

00:20:12.239 --> 00:20:16.479
And Moses says this in v. 26 of Deuteronomy 11,

00:20:16.479 --> 00:20:18.439
"'Behold, I set before you this day

00:20:18.439 --> 00:20:23.839
a blessing and a curse.

00:20:23.839 --> 00:20:27.199
A blessing, if ye obey the commandments

00:20:27.199 --> 00:20:28.559
of the Lord your God,

00:20:28.559 --> 00:20:31.239
which I command you this day.

00:20:31.239 --> 00:20:33.879
And a curse, if ye will not obey

00:20:33.879 --> 00:20:36.159
the commandments of the Lord your God,

00:20:36.159 --> 00:20:37.519
but turn aside out of the way

00:20:37.519 --> 00:20:38.919
which I command you this day

00:20:38.919 --> 00:20:40.439
to go after other gods

00:20:40.439 --> 00:20:43.959
which ye have not known.'"

00:20:43.959 --> 00:20:46.159
Now, when you read these verses of Scripture,

00:20:46.159 --> 00:20:48.239
and I know that they're familiar,

00:20:48.239 --> 00:20:50.879
but when you read these verses of Scripture,

00:20:50.879 --> 00:20:55.119
you find it seems to be so simple to me

00:20:55.119 --> 00:20:57.759
that God so graciously says,

00:20:57.759 --> 00:21:01.399
I've set before you a blessing and a curse.

00:21:01.399 --> 00:21:02.919
You want the blessing?

00:21:02.919 --> 00:21:07.559
V. 27, it comes by way of obedience.

00:21:07.559 --> 00:21:11.799
The curse, however, comes by way of disobedience.

00:21:11.799 --> 00:21:13.679
Now, anyone in their right mind

00:21:13.679 --> 00:21:16.159
is going to want v. 27,

00:21:16.159 --> 00:21:18.559
not v. 28.

00:21:18.559 --> 00:21:20.879
But how many times when we read

00:21:20.879 --> 00:21:23.759
the Old Testament do we read of a people

00:21:23.759 --> 00:21:27.039
that are stiff-necked and disobedient?

00:21:27.079 --> 00:21:29.639
It was not that they did not know.

00:21:29.639 --> 00:21:32.999
It was not that they did not have the instruction.

00:21:32.999 --> 00:21:35.639
It was not that God did not send

00:21:35.639 --> 00:21:38.399
prophet and witness to them.

00:21:38.399 --> 00:21:40.959
It was that they had a heart bent

00:21:40.959 --> 00:21:43.039
on disobedience and rebellion.

00:21:44.559 --> 00:21:45.559
You don't need to turn there,

00:21:45.559 --> 00:21:48.679
but listen to this verse of Scripture in Nehemiah 9,

00:21:48.679 --> 00:21:50.279
and verse number 17, it says,

00:21:50.279 --> 00:21:53.799
and refused to obey.

00:21:53.799 --> 00:21:55.679
I want you to think about that just for a moment.

00:21:55.719 --> 00:21:59.239
The people of God who had been given the Word of God,

00:21:59.239 --> 00:22:03.159
who God had sent prophet after prophet after prophet,

00:22:03.159 --> 00:22:06.359
that they do not hearken unto the Lord.

00:22:06.359 --> 00:22:09.079
It talks about what he's speaking of in context.

00:22:09.079 --> 00:22:10.319
He says, but they and our fathers

00:22:10.319 --> 00:22:12.519
dealt proudly and hardened their necks

00:22:12.519 --> 00:22:14.199
and hearkened not to thy commandments

00:22:14.199 --> 00:22:16.799
and refused to obey.

00:22:18.079 --> 00:22:19.359
Refused to obey.

00:22:19.359 --> 00:22:22.399
You ever have a situation where someone refuses to obey?

00:22:23.759 --> 00:22:25.319
I hope we've never been in a situation

00:22:25.959 --> 00:22:27.799
where we've refused to obey the Lord.

00:22:28.879 --> 00:22:30.639
But the people of God, you say,

00:22:30.639 --> 00:22:31.879
Pastor, this is a simple message.

00:22:31.879 --> 00:22:34.000
I know, and it's so often that the simple things

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.359
in the Christian life is what really hinders us,

00:22:37.359 --> 00:22:38.799
what really trips us up.

00:22:40.039 --> 00:22:41.439
They're getting ready.

00:22:41.439 --> 00:22:44.519
I'm nowhere near a sports fan like I used to be

00:22:44.519 --> 00:22:46.799
for a whole host of reasons.

00:22:46.799 --> 00:22:48.199
One of them is time.

00:22:48.199 --> 00:22:49.679
Another one is their agenda

00:22:49.679 --> 00:22:51.679
and everything else that goes on with it.

00:22:51.679 --> 00:22:53.559
But I do understand that here,

00:22:53.559 --> 00:22:55.879
maybe just in the next week or two,

00:22:55.879 --> 00:22:57.079
maybe it's actually already started,

00:22:57.079 --> 00:23:00.359
but some training camps for football.

00:23:00.359 --> 00:23:05.279
I remember going to practice after the season was over

00:23:05.279 --> 00:23:09.359
and you'd get back to starting the next season.

00:23:09.359 --> 00:23:10.879
And it didn't matter.

00:23:10.879 --> 00:23:15.319
I was a senior and I had played varsity football for years,

00:23:15.319 --> 00:23:17.239
but we get to the football field to start

00:23:17.239 --> 00:23:19.079
and guess what you start with?

00:23:19.079 --> 00:23:20.839
Basics.

00:23:20.839 --> 00:23:21.759
Basics.

00:23:22.639 --> 00:23:24.479
And when we think about the Christian life,

00:23:24.479 --> 00:23:29.479
it's sometimes the simplicity of something like obedience

00:23:30.079 --> 00:23:33.839
that really is a problem that we deal with.

00:23:33.839 --> 00:23:38.359
We see it in Israel over and over and over.

00:23:39.599 --> 00:23:41.000
They refuse to obey.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.639
In Deuteronomy chapter 30, you're there in chapter 11.

00:23:44.639 --> 00:23:46.759
Turn to chapter number 30, if you will.

00:23:46.759 --> 00:23:48.319
In chapter number 30,

00:23:50.359 --> 00:23:55.359
after Moses has faithfully given a charge

00:23:55.679 --> 00:23:57.359
really to the people of God

00:23:57.359 --> 00:24:00.119
with regard to their entrance into the land,

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.439
he says in Deuteronomy 30 in verse number 19,

00:24:03.439 --> 00:24:07.199
I call heaven and earth to record this day against you

00:24:07.199 --> 00:24:10.879
that I have set before you life and death,

00:24:10.879 --> 00:24:13.959
blessing and cursing.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.119
Therefore, choose life

00:24:17.119 --> 00:24:21.320
that both thou and thy seed may live.

00:24:24.479 --> 00:24:27.880
See, the choice to obey is ours.

00:24:30.119 --> 00:24:32.959
Saul had a choice in 1 Samuel 15.

00:24:32.959 --> 00:24:33.839
Did he not?

00:24:33.839 --> 00:24:35.519
He had a choice.

00:24:35.519 --> 00:24:37.919
It was not that the instruction wasn't clear.

00:24:37.919 --> 00:24:40.720
It was not that there was something complicated about it.

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:45.000
It was simply this, he chose to disobey.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.160
He chose to go a different path.

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:50.000
He thought that we could save these things.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.239
He listened to the people

00:24:51.239 --> 00:24:53.279
and he thought we can make a sacrifice

00:24:53.279 --> 00:24:54.919
and take burnt offerings,

00:24:54.919 --> 00:24:57.279
but God says, that's not what I told you to do.

00:24:59.679 --> 00:25:01.759
A verse of Scripture, really two verses of Scripture

00:25:01.759 --> 00:25:03.119
that many of us have memorized,

00:25:03.119 --> 00:25:06.279
Proverbs 3, verses five and six.

00:25:06.279 --> 00:25:08.320
Trust in the Lord, how?

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:09.600
All thine heart.

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:10.440
And this is what?

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:14.079
Lean not on an own understanding.

00:25:14.079 --> 00:25:15.519
In all thy ways, acknowledge him

00:25:15.519 --> 00:25:18.720
and he shall direct thy paths, right?

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:19.880
And sometimes what happens,

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:21.039
we lean on our understanding,

00:25:21.039 --> 00:25:22.639
we begin to try to justify something,

00:25:22.639 --> 00:25:25.799
we begin to try to evaluate a situation

00:25:25.799 --> 00:25:28.119
and begin to look at the culture

00:25:28.119 --> 00:25:30.239
and look at society and look at what's popular

00:25:30.239 --> 00:25:33.160
and then determine what it is that we're going to do.

00:25:34.919 --> 00:25:37.559
Listen, Saul was not instructed to go find out

00:25:37.559 --> 00:25:39.039
what the people wanted to do.

00:25:39.959 --> 00:25:44.959
Samuel told Saul, here's what God said, amen?

00:25:45.239 --> 00:25:46.639
It wasn't open for discussion,

00:25:46.639 --> 00:25:48.000
it wasn't open for debate.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.679
I don't know how he is the king,

00:25:50.679 --> 00:25:53.639
just I don't know if they had some kind of a situation

00:25:53.639 --> 00:25:56.320
where, hey, what do you guys want to do about this?

00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:58.039
No, no, if we have the mind of the Lord,

00:25:58.039 --> 00:26:00.039
if we know what God said,

00:26:00.039 --> 00:26:03.479
it's really not open for discussion, amen?

00:26:03.479 --> 00:26:05.839
It's not open for debate.

00:26:05.839 --> 00:26:08.239
It's like I've said many times over the years,

00:26:08.279 --> 00:26:10.199
God said it, that settles it.

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:13.199
I know that it's been popular

00:26:13.199 --> 00:26:16.679
to insert that center statement, I believe it,

00:26:16.679 --> 00:26:18.919
but the reality is that whether you believe it

00:26:18.919 --> 00:26:20.839
or I believe it doesn't change the fact

00:26:20.839 --> 00:26:22.600
that God said it and it settles it.

00:26:24.039 --> 00:26:26.320
And we have here this evening this truth

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:28.479
that obedience is critical.

00:26:28.479 --> 00:26:32.399
To obey is better.

00:26:32.399 --> 00:26:34.000
To obey is better.

00:26:35.039 --> 00:26:38.160
And so here we find this evening that obedience is critical.

00:26:38.959 --> 00:26:42.079
Let me say this, number two, obedience requires commitment.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.720
Obedience requires commitment.

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:47.399
You know, when we make a commitment or a determination

00:26:47.399 --> 00:26:50.679
that we're going to obey God, you can just count on

00:26:50.679 --> 00:26:52.519
there's gonna be some stuff that comes up

00:26:52.519 --> 00:26:55.039
that's gonna try to get you to disobey.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.639
There's gonna be something that happens.

00:26:59.639 --> 00:27:04.039
And we find that if we're going to live a life of obedience

00:27:04.039 --> 00:27:06.519
that requires commitment, it requires us to come

00:27:06.519 --> 00:27:08.160
to the place where we say, listen,

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:11.119
I am going to obey God, period.

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:13.839
I'm just gonna obey God.

00:27:13.839 --> 00:27:15.160
Turn to the book of Joshua, if you will,

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:16.279
in the 24th chapter.

00:27:16.279 --> 00:27:18.559
I referenced this morning a little bit about

00:27:18.559 --> 00:27:21.279
the difference there in Joshua and judges

00:27:21.279 --> 00:27:24.199
and just the charge that Joshua's given

00:27:24.199 --> 00:27:26.119
at the end of the book of Joshua.

00:27:26.119 --> 00:27:28.519
And here, as we come to the 24th chapter,

00:27:28.519 --> 00:27:31.679
we find that he's giving this charge to the people.

00:27:31.679 --> 00:27:33.720
And if you read the entirety of the charge,

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:37.239
I mean, what a charge he issues to the people of God.

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:42.479
And he brings them really to a place of decision.

00:27:42.479 --> 00:27:44.079
He tells them in verse number 15,

00:27:44.079 --> 00:27:47.799
choose you this day whom you will serve.

00:27:47.799 --> 00:27:50.279
He tells them, as for me and my house,

00:27:50.279 --> 00:27:51.479
we will serve the Lord.

00:27:51.479 --> 00:27:54.039
We're familiar with verse number 15.

00:27:54.039 --> 00:27:55.880
He says, listen, you have a choice to make.

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:58.519
I've already made my choice.

00:27:58.519 --> 00:28:01.479
Me and my house, we are going to serve the Lord,

00:28:01.479 --> 00:28:03.559
but you have a choice to make.

00:28:04.399 --> 00:28:05.839
Notice as you go through the text of Scripture,

00:28:05.839 --> 00:28:09.119
look, if you will, the people said in verse number 21,

00:28:09.119 --> 00:28:10.160
the people said unto Joshua,

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:12.679
nay, but we will serve the Lord.

00:28:12.679 --> 00:28:13.799
And Joshua said unto the people,

00:28:13.799 --> 00:28:15.440
you are witnesses against yourselves

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:17.600
that you have chosen you, the Lord, to serve him.

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:20.440
And they said, we are witnesses.

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:22.919
Now therefore put away, said he, the strange gods,

00:28:22.919 --> 00:28:24.559
which are among you, and incline your heart

00:28:24.559 --> 00:28:26.079
unto the Lord God of Israel.

00:28:26.079 --> 00:28:28.199
Notice what the Bible says in verse number 24.

00:28:28.199 --> 00:28:30.399
And the people said unto Joshua,

00:28:31.399 --> 00:28:34.119
the Lord our God will we serve,

00:28:34.119 --> 00:28:38.839
and his voice will we obey.

00:28:38.839 --> 00:28:40.799
That's a good statement.

00:28:40.799 --> 00:28:42.320
That's a good commitment.

00:28:43.239 --> 00:28:45.000
I believe that as you look, of course,

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000
and you study the history of Israel,

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.359
and you look at the next generation,

00:28:49.359 --> 00:28:51.279
obviously there's some issues

00:28:51.279 --> 00:28:52.799
with regard to their obedience.

00:28:52.799 --> 00:28:55.080
There's some issues with regard to their commitment.

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:57.839
But I want you to see they make this commitment.

00:28:58.839 --> 00:29:01.960
This evening, we need to just draw a line in the sand.

00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:03.520
Say, I'm gonna obey God.

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:05.559
You know there are a lot of pressures in our society

00:29:05.559 --> 00:29:07.640
to cause you and I to disobey God?

00:29:08.919 --> 00:29:10.359
Seriously.

00:29:10.359 --> 00:29:13.599
There are pressures today in our society.

00:29:13.599 --> 00:29:14.440
Why?

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:15.960
Because our culture and our society

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:18.039
is anti-God and anti-Bible.

00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:21.599
And being anti-God and anti-Bible,

00:29:21.599 --> 00:29:24.479
they are going to pressure us,

00:29:24.479 --> 00:29:26.119
are you gonna obey God or not?

00:29:26.719 --> 00:29:28.159
Listen, I don't obey God,

00:29:28.159 --> 00:29:30.679
and you should not obey God out of convenience.

00:29:31.799 --> 00:29:36.599
Obedience is not a matter of convenience.

00:29:36.599 --> 00:29:39.239
Obedience is a matter of commitment.

00:29:39.239 --> 00:29:41.200
See, because if we obey out of convenience,

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:44.000
then when it becomes inconvenient to obey,

00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:49.000
we just fold and go along with whatever the situation is.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:49.839
Right?

00:29:49.839 --> 00:29:52.479
What is it that caused Daniel to pray?

00:29:52.479 --> 00:29:54.839
What is it that caused Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego

00:29:55.839 --> 00:29:57.760
not to bow?

00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:59.919
And there was some commitment to obedience.

00:29:59.919 --> 00:30:08.919
God had given some instruction with regard to bowing down before no other gods.

00:30:08.919 --> 00:30:10.919
And they say, hey, you're going to bow.

00:30:10.919 --> 00:30:11.919
No, we're not.

00:30:11.919 --> 00:30:12.919
We made a commitment to obey.

00:30:12.919 --> 00:30:14.919
That means you're going to go in the furnace.

00:30:14.919 --> 00:30:16.919
So be it.

00:30:16.919 --> 00:30:18.919
We made a commitment to obey, right?

00:30:18.919 --> 00:30:21.919
We read it in Daniel 3, Daniel 6.

00:30:21.919 --> 00:30:23.919
Daniel, he's praying.

00:30:23.919 --> 00:30:27.919
If anyone makes any petition to anyone other than the king,

00:30:27.919 --> 00:30:30.919
den of lions, my God said to pray.

00:30:30.919 --> 00:30:35.919
So I'm going to pray, just as I did before.

00:30:35.919 --> 00:30:37.919
See, obedience requires commitment.

00:30:37.919 --> 00:30:40.919
Turn to the book of Acts, if you will.

00:30:40.919 --> 00:30:46.919
Acts chapter number 5.

00:30:46.919 --> 00:30:50.919
In Acts chapter number 5, I see a measure of commitment

00:30:50.919 --> 00:30:55.919
that is so vital for us this evening to really grasp

00:30:55.919 --> 00:30:59.919
and get a hold of in our hearts.

00:30:59.919 --> 00:31:03.919
The people of God have already begun facing some persecution

00:31:03.919 --> 00:31:05.919
and some difficulty.

00:31:05.919 --> 00:31:11.919
We've read in previous messages about some of that persecution that begins.

00:31:11.919 --> 00:31:14.919
In chapter number 4, you enter into the fifth chapter

00:31:14.919 --> 00:31:20.919
and you continue to see the persecution and the purging, if you will.

00:31:20.919 --> 00:31:25.919
We find that they were put in prison.

00:31:25.919 --> 00:31:28.919
It says in verse number 18 that they laid their hands on the apostles

00:31:28.919 --> 00:31:31.919
and put them in the common prison.

00:31:31.919 --> 00:31:33.919
I love verse number 19,

00:31:33.919 --> 00:31:37.919
but the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors and brought them forth.

00:31:37.919 --> 00:31:39.919
Isn't that wonderful?

00:31:39.919 --> 00:31:43.919
God intervened. God worked.

00:31:43.919 --> 00:31:45.919
The angel of the Lord said to them in verse 20,

00:31:45.919 --> 00:31:49.919
Go stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life.

00:31:49.919 --> 00:31:53.919
They'd already been commanded not to speak any longer in His name.

00:31:53.919 --> 00:31:56.919
We find that here they've been delivered.

00:31:56.919 --> 00:31:58.919
The officers came.

00:31:58.919 --> 00:32:00.919
They were told to go get the prisoners.

00:32:00.919 --> 00:32:03.919
In verse number 22, when the officers came and found them not in the prison,

00:32:03.919 --> 00:32:04.919
they returned and told, saying,

00:32:04.919 --> 00:32:06.919
The prison truly found we shut with all safety,

00:32:06.919 --> 00:32:08.919
and the keepers standing without before the doors.

00:32:08.919 --> 00:32:11.919
But when we had opened, we found no man within.

00:32:11.919 --> 00:32:16.919
Now can you imagine these officers telling this to the commanding officer?

00:32:16.919 --> 00:32:19.919
Hold on a minute. What happened here?

00:32:19.919 --> 00:32:22.919
I'm telling you, we got there and it was closed, it was sealed,

00:32:22.919 --> 00:32:25.919
and the guards were outside.

00:32:25.919 --> 00:32:31.919
And we opened the door and there's no one in there.

00:32:31.919 --> 00:32:34.919
God.

00:32:34.919 --> 00:32:35.919
Notice what it says.

00:32:35.919 --> 00:32:38.919
Now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priest heard these things,

00:32:38.919 --> 00:32:41.919
they doubted of them whereunto this would grow.

00:32:41.919 --> 00:32:42.919
Then came one and told them, saying,

00:32:42.919 --> 00:32:45.919
Behold, we found them.

00:32:45.919 --> 00:32:46.919
Notice what it says.

00:32:46.919 --> 00:32:51.919
The men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people.

00:32:51.919 --> 00:32:53.919
Isn't that awesome?

00:32:53.919 --> 00:32:56.919
They're doing what God told them to do.

00:32:56.919 --> 00:32:59.919
God said, You're to be my witnesses.

00:32:59.919 --> 00:33:01.919
God said, You're to proclaim my truth.

00:33:01.919 --> 00:33:03.919
And that's what they're doing.

00:33:03.919 --> 00:33:04.919
It says in verse 26,

00:33:04.919 --> 00:33:07.919
Then went the captain with the officers and brought them without violence,

00:33:07.919 --> 00:33:10.919
for they feared the people, lest they should have been stoned.

00:33:10.919 --> 00:33:12.919
And when they had brought them, they set them before the council,

00:33:12.919 --> 00:33:14.919
and the high priest asked them.

00:33:14.919 --> 00:33:16.919
Notice what the high priest asks in verse 28.

00:33:16.919 --> 00:33:25.919
Did not we straightly command you that you should not teach in this name?

00:33:25.919 --> 00:33:31.919
I can almost hear the tone of the high priest.

00:33:31.919 --> 00:33:33.919
Were we not clear?

00:33:33.919 --> 00:33:34.919
Did you not understand?

00:33:34.919 --> 00:33:38.919
Was there something that was ambiguous about what we told you to do?

00:33:38.919 --> 00:33:39.919
You see the high priest.

00:33:39.919 --> 00:33:42.919
Didn't we command you?

00:33:42.919 --> 00:33:45.919
Behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine.

00:33:45.919 --> 00:33:48.919
Isn't that awesome?

00:33:48.919 --> 00:33:49.919
And look at what it says.

00:33:49.919 --> 00:33:53.919
And intend to bring this man's blood upon us.

00:33:53.919 --> 00:34:00.919
Now, I'm speaking this evening about the fact that obedience requires commitment.

00:34:00.919 --> 00:34:07.919
In this situation, Peter and the disciples, they knew what God had commanded.

00:34:07.919 --> 00:34:10.919
But now there's another command.

00:34:10.919 --> 00:34:11.919
He says in verse number 28,

00:34:11.919 --> 00:34:15.919
Did not we straightly command you?

00:34:15.919 --> 00:34:19.919
What happens when we are faced with two commands?

00:34:19.919 --> 00:34:22.919
We must take heed to the greater command.

00:34:22.919 --> 00:34:23.919
What's the greater command?

00:34:23.919 --> 00:34:25.919
The one with the greater authority.

00:34:25.919 --> 00:34:26.919
Who's the one with all authority?

00:34:26.919 --> 00:34:28.919
Our Savior.

00:34:28.919 --> 00:34:31.919
All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.

00:34:31.919 --> 00:34:34.919
He has all authority and all power.

00:34:34.919 --> 00:34:35.919
He is God.

00:34:35.919 --> 00:34:37.919
He is the creator and sustainer.

00:34:37.919 --> 00:34:43.919
And so we find that this high priest who has some earthly, some temporal power,

00:34:43.919 --> 00:34:47.919
he says, hey, don't you know that we've commanded you?

00:34:47.919 --> 00:34:50.919
And Peter says,

00:34:50.919 --> 00:34:53.919
Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said,

00:34:53.919 --> 00:35:00.919
We ought to obey God rather than men.

00:35:00.919 --> 00:35:03.919
How many times have we read that verse of Scripture?

00:35:03.919 --> 00:35:08.919
How many times have we said those words of Acts 5 in verse number 29?

00:35:08.919 --> 00:35:10.919
We ought to obey God rather than men.

00:35:10.919 --> 00:35:14.919
Listen, that's not a card that we pull out in convenience

00:35:14.919 --> 00:35:18.919
when we just don't want to obey some other authority.

00:35:18.919 --> 00:35:19.919
Right?

00:35:19.919 --> 00:35:21.919
That's not how that's to be used.

00:35:21.919 --> 00:35:23.919
It's not a situation where some authority,

00:35:23.919 --> 00:35:26.919
we've been living in all kinds of disobedience,

00:35:26.919 --> 00:35:28.919
and then some authority comes and wants to tell us to do something and say,

00:35:28.919 --> 00:35:31.919
We ought to obey God rather than men.

00:35:31.919 --> 00:35:33.919
No, no, no, y'all ain't been obeying God anyway, right?

00:35:33.919 --> 00:35:37.919
That's really what they could say to us.

00:35:37.919 --> 00:35:39.919
But as we look at the Word of God,

00:35:39.919 --> 00:35:43.919
we see that no, they were not using it in that manner.

00:35:43.919 --> 00:35:45.919
And I also would say this.

00:35:45.919 --> 00:35:48.919
When we say that we ought to obey God rather than men,

00:35:48.919 --> 00:35:53.919
it doesn't mean that we should expect it to be a road of ease.

00:35:53.919 --> 00:35:57.919
Rather, we should expect that there's going to be some pressures put on

00:35:57.919 --> 00:36:02.919
to find out how committed we really are to obedience.

00:36:02.919 --> 00:36:05.919
How committed are you to obeying God?

00:36:05.919 --> 00:36:07.919
How committed am I to obeying God?

00:36:07.919 --> 00:36:09.919
Can I say this evening,

00:36:09.919 --> 00:36:11.919
in the United States of America,

00:36:11.919 --> 00:36:15.919
it's actually been really easy to obey God.

00:36:15.919 --> 00:36:20.919
It has been abundantly easy to obey God.

00:36:20.919 --> 00:36:22.919
And if we'd be honest,

00:36:22.919 --> 00:36:26.919
there's a lot of areas where we have fallen short of obeying God.

00:36:26.919 --> 00:36:28.919
But it's been easy.

00:36:28.919 --> 00:36:30.919
We're not going to start obeying God

00:36:30.919 --> 00:36:33.919
when they start telling us we're going to go to jail.

00:36:33.919 --> 00:36:37.919
It doesn't really make sense that we would do that.

00:36:37.919 --> 00:36:41.919
But we find here in Acts chapter 5

00:36:41.919 --> 00:36:44.919
that he not only says we ought to obey God rather than men,

00:36:44.919 --> 00:36:46.919
but he says the God of our fathers raised up Jesus,

00:36:46.919 --> 00:36:48.919
whom He slew and hanged on a tree.

00:36:48.919 --> 00:36:50.919
Listen, we serve a risen Savior.

00:36:50.919 --> 00:36:51.919
Amen?

00:36:51.919 --> 00:36:53.919
We sang this morning, because He lives.

00:36:53.919 --> 00:36:55.919
Him hath God exalted with His right hand

00:36:55.919 --> 00:36:57.919
to be a prince and a Savior,

00:36:57.919 --> 00:37:00.919
for to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins.

00:37:00.919 --> 00:37:02.919
And we are His witnesses of these things.

00:37:02.919 --> 00:37:04.919
And so is also the Holy Ghost,

00:37:04.919 --> 00:37:06.919
whom God hath given to them that obey Him.

00:37:06.919 --> 00:37:08.919
When they heard that, they were cut to the heart

00:37:08.919 --> 00:37:11.919
and took counsel to slay them.

00:37:11.919 --> 00:37:14.919
Listen, just because we say we're ought to obey God rather than men,

00:37:14.919 --> 00:37:16.919
don't expect that the authorities are going to say,

00:37:16.919 --> 00:37:18.919
oh, okay, we didn't understand that.

00:37:18.919 --> 00:37:20.919
Go ahead, carry on.

00:37:20.919 --> 00:37:22.919
It's not going to work that way.

00:37:22.919 --> 00:37:25.919
Right?

00:37:25.919 --> 00:37:29.919
They're ready to kill them.

00:37:29.919 --> 00:37:34.919
Gamaliel steps in and he gives some counsel

00:37:34.919 --> 00:37:37.919
with regard to what they should do.

00:37:37.919 --> 00:37:39.919
We don't have time to develop all of it,

00:37:39.919 --> 00:37:45.919
but he speaks about Theudas in verse number 36.

00:37:45.919 --> 00:37:48.919
He speaks about Judas in verse number 37.

00:37:48.919 --> 00:37:51.919
When he speaks about Theudas in verse 36,

00:37:51.919 --> 00:37:56.919
he spoke about a man that was boasting himself to be somebody.

00:37:56.919 --> 00:38:01.919
See, that's the great difference between the disciples and Theudas.

00:38:01.919 --> 00:38:05.919
We're nobodies serving the King of Kings.

00:38:05.919 --> 00:38:07.919
We're not boasting ourselves to be somebody.

00:38:07.919 --> 00:38:09.919
But we ought not be anyway, right?

00:38:09.919 --> 00:38:11.919
This morning's message.

00:38:11.919 --> 00:38:13.919
It's all about Jesus.

00:38:13.919 --> 00:38:16.919
We're exalting and magnifying Him.

00:38:16.919 --> 00:38:20.919
He speaks of Judas of Galilee in verse number 37.

00:38:20.919 --> 00:38:23.919
And then notice what he says in verse 38.

00:38:23.919 --> 00:38:26.919
And now I say unto you, refrain from these men,

00:38:26.919 --> 00:38:29.919
speaking of the disciples,

00:38:29.919 --> 00:38:33.919
refrain from these men and let them alone,

00:38:33.919 --> 00:38:38.919
for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to naught.

00:38:38.919 --> 00:38:40.919
That's true.

00:38:40.919 --> 00:38:42.919
That's what happened with Theudas.

00:38:42.919 --> 00:38:44.919
That's what happened with Judas.

00:38:44.919 --> 00:38:47.919
It came to naught because it was a movement of men.

00:38:47.919 --> 00:38:50.919
But notice what he says in verse 39.

00:38:50.919 --> 00:38:56.919
But if it be of God, he cannot overthrow it,

00:38:56.919 --> 00:39:00.919
lest happily ye be found even to fight against God.

00:39:00.919 --> 00:39:03.919
But then notice what happens in verse number 40.

00:39:03.919 --> 00:39:06.919
It says, and to him they agreed.

00:39:06.919 --> 00:39:09.919
These religious leaders, the high priest giving charge here

00:39:09.919 --> 00:39:12.919
with all that's taking place, they agree with Gamaliel.

00:39:12.919 --> 00:39:16.919
And it says this, that they called the apostles,

00:39:16.919 --> 00:39:18.919
and then notice right in the middle of verse number 40,

00:39:18.919 --> 00:39:21.919
and beaten them.

00:39:21.919 --> 00:39:24.919
I have it underlined in my Bible.

00:39:24.919 --> 00:39:26.919
And beaten them.

00:39:26.919 --> 00:39:31.919
Demanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus

00:39:31.919 --> 00:39:34.919
and let them go.

00:39:34.919 --> 00:39:37.919
We're speaking tonight about obedience requires commitment.

00:39:37.919 --> 00:39:39.919
They've already been in prison,

00:39:39.919 --> 00:39:41.919
but they're committed to obey.

00:39:41.919 --> 00:39:44.919
They get supernaturally delivered from prison,

00:39:44.919 --> 00:39:47.919
and they're teaching and preaching in His name.

00:39:47.919 --> 00:39:49.919
And then they're called before the council,

00:39:49.919 --> 00:39:52.919
and the council's ready to slay them,

00:39:52.919 --> 00:39:55.919
and Gamaliel intercedes, but they're beating them.

00:39:55.919 --> 00:39:57.919
And so the apostles are beaten,

00:39:57.919 --> 00:39:59.919
and then they're commanded again.

00:39:59.919 --> 00:40:03.679
And again, that they should not speak in the name of Jesus.

00:40:03.679 --> 00:40:05.299
And it says in v. 41,

00:40:05.299 --> 00:40:08.299
and they departed from the presence of the council,

00:40:08.299 --> 00:40:13.679
rejoicing that they were counted worthy

00:40:13.679 --> 00:40:16.559
to suffer shame for His name.

00:40:16.559 --> 00:40:18.559
And then read v. 42.

00:40:18.559 --> 00:40:23.859
And daily, in the temple and in every house,

00:40:23.859 --> 00:40:32.159
they ceased not to preach, to teach, and preach Jesus Christ.

00:40:32.159 --> 00:40:35.419
That is a commitment to obedience.

00:40:35.419 --> 00:40:36.659
Amen?

00:40:36.659 --> 00:40:38.959
Obedience is critical.

00:40:38.959 --> 00:40:42.299
Obedience requires commitment.

00:40:42.299 --> 00:40:44.959
See, when we truly understand who God is

00:40:44.959 --> 00:40:47.799
and we understand His authority in our lives,

00:40:47.799 --> 00:40:50.299
we say, I'm going to obey God.

00:40:50.299 --> 00:40:54.799
There's really no other option for me but to obey God.

00:40:54.799 --> 00:40:56.119
I understand I can disobey,

00:40:56.119 --> 00:40:59.579
but as I'm considering it spiritually,

00:40:59.579 --> 00:41:02.299
as I'm looking at the truth of God's Word,

00:41:02.299 --> 00:41:07.099
why would I want to disobey?

00:41:07.099 --> 00:41:11.599
I understand this evening that we're humans and we struggle,

00:41:11.599 --> 00:41:15.399
but the reality is that in the power of God and with His help,

00:41:15.399 --> 00:41:20.019
we ought to say, I'm going to obey God.

00:41:20.019 --> 00:41:21.659
I'm going to obey God.

00:41:21.659 --> 00:41:24.579
And the commitment to obedience

00:41:24.579 --> 00:41:29.419
that we see in Acts 5 is convicting to me.

00:41:29.419 --> 00:41:31.419
It's convicting to me.

00:41:31.419 --> 00:41:33.619
And I look at this passage of Scripture

00:41:33.619 --> 00:41:38.719
and I wonder tonight how committed am I to obeying God?

00:41:38.719 --> 00:41:40.639
I've already said it,

00:41:40.639 --> 00:41:44.339
it's been easy in our nation to obey God.

00:41:44.339 --> 00:41:47.339
I made this statement a few Sundays ago.

00:41:47.339 --> 00:41:50.659
I believe it was July 3rd, so a month ago.

00:41:50.659 --> 00:41:53.019
I made the statement that we could go out after church

00:41:53.019 --> 00:41:56.919
and we can preach and we can give Gospel tracts

00:41:56.919 --> 00:41:59.059
and we don't have to have any fear.

00:41:59.059 --> 00:42:01.619
No one's going to do anything to us.

00:42:01.619 --> 00:42:04.219
I made that statement on July 3rd, Sunday morning,

00:42:04.219 --> 00:42:05.819
preaching from this pulpit,

00:42:05.819 --> 00:42:08.299
and that afternoon I read of a preacher

00:42:08.299 --> 00:42:09.659
in the state of Washington

00:42:09.659 --> 00:42:12.939
that was arrested for preaching on the corner.

00:42:12.939 --> 00:42:14.979
And I thought, oh my.

00:42:14.979 --> 00:42:16.699
I just said a couple hours ago

00:42:16.739 --> 00:42:19.099
that we live in a nation where we can do that.

00:42:20.539 --> 00:42:23.059
It's changing, it's changing.

00:42:25.179 --> 00:42:27.219
But God has not changed.

00:42:27.219 --> 00:42:31.859
He's the same yesterday and today and forever.

00:42:31.859 --> 00:42:34.019
Listen, your circumstances might change,

00:42:34.019 --> 00:42:35.499
but God doesn't change.

00:42:35.499 --> 00:42:37.199
You make a commitment to obey God

00:42:37.199 --> 00:42:39.779
in the area of your finances.

00:42:39.779 --> 00:42:42.819
You expect that there's going to be some unexpected bills.

00:42:43.899 --> 00:42:44.919
Right?

00:42:44.919 --> 00:42:45.759
Why?

00:42:45.759 --> 00:42:48.159
Because Satan wants to find out if you're serious.

00:42:49.639 --> 00:42:50.679
Oh, you're going to obey God?

00:42:50.679 --> 00:42:52.359
I read a story about a man that said,

00:42:52.359 --> 00:42:54.739
man, I want God's blessing on my finances

00:42:54.739 --> 00:42:57.999
and I'm going to tithe and I'm going to give to God's work

00:42:57.999 --> 00:43:00.859
and I'm going to make this commitment.

00:43:02.279 --> 00:43:05.119
And all of a sudden, he didn't have an abundance anymore.

00:43:06.319 --> 00:43:08.159
Well, I just don't think I can afford to do it.

00:43:08.159 --> 00:43:09.279
Did God change?

00:43:10.639 --> 00:43:11.959
I'm going to make a commitment

00:43:11.959 --> 00:43:14.119
that I'm going to be a bold witness.

00:43:14.119 --> 00:43:17.599
I'm going to share the gospel of Jesus Christ with people.

00:43:17.599 --> 00:43:20.399
All of a sudden, you make that commitment

00:43:20.399 --> 00:43:23.199
and someone's going, hey, you can't talk about that here.

00:43:24.699 --> 00:43:25.859
Somebody's going to slam a door.

00:43:25.859 --> 00:43:27.759
Somebody's going to, I'm going to call the police.

00:43:27.759 --> 00:43:32.419
They're going to, why are we committed to obeying God?

00:43:33.759 --> 00:43:38.259
Listen, this evening, when we think about the word of God,

00:43:39.259 --> 00:43:43.139
this book is more authoritative

00:43:43.139 --> 00:43:46.639
than any other document on the face of the earth.

00:43:49.059 --> 00:43:52.979
Any other document, this book is superior.

00:43:52.979 --> 00:43:55.019
And so I ought to obey God.

00:43:55.019 --> 00:43:57.899
If I want God's blessing, and I do,

00:43:57.899 --> 00:44:00.359
I believe that we want God's blessing,

00:44:00.359 --> 00:44:02.199
we better get back to obedience.

00:44:03.179 --> 00:44:07.559
Not taking the approach of Saul in 1 Samuel 15,

00:44:08.379 --> 00:44:11.739
and excusing our disobedience,

00:44:11.739 --> 00:44:15.579
justifying our partial obedience.

00:44:15.579 --> 00:44:18.819
Well, we were going to do this, and I was going to do that.

00:44:18.819 --> 00:44:20.859
God says, no, no, no, what did I say?

00:44:22.219 --> 00:44:24.019
That's not what I told you to do, Saul.

00:44:24.019 --> 00:44:25.379
I was clear.

00:44:25.379 --> 00:44:26.219
When we go to the word of God,

00:44:26.219 --> 00:44:29.499
listen, if we really want to know what God wants us to do,

00:44:29.499 --> 00:44:30.399
we can find it.

00:44:32.239 --> 00:44:34.519
If we want to justify our disobedience,

00:44:35.939 --> 00:44:37.499
you know what I found in life?

00:44:37.499 --> 00:44:40.679
We can figure out a way to do it, just like Saul did.

00:44:42.619 --> 00:44:44.419
And this evening, we just make a commitment.

00:44:44.419 --> 00:44:45.259
Why?

00:44:46.099 --> 00:44:48.099
Because to obey is better.

00:44:48.099 --> 00:44:50.319
To obey is better.

00:44:51.299 --> 00:44:54.259
It is critical, obedience is critical.

00:44:54.259 --> 00:44:57.179
But obedience requires commitment.

00:44:57.179 --> 00:44:59.779
I wonder tonight, how committed am I

00:44:59.779 --> 00:45:01.499
to obeying the word of God?

00:45:01.499 --> 00:45:04.819
I mean, I'm not talking about when it's easy to obey,

00:45:04.819 --> 00:45:06.819
when it's convenient to obey.

00:45:06.819 --> 00:45:08.899
When everyone else is obeying.

00:45:08.899 --> 00:45:11.379
I'm talking about when the pressure comes.

00:45:12.499 --> 00:45:16.899
When it no longer is easy, when it no longer is convenient.

00:45:18.099 --> 00:45:19.499
Am I still going to obey God?

00:45:20.619 --> 00:45:23.739
When they say, hey, listen, you keep preaching that way,

00:45:23.739 --> 00:45:25.699
and here's what's going to happen.

00:45:25.699 --> 00:45:27.219
What do you do?

00:45:27.219 --> 00:45:28.059
Where do you go?

00:45:29.119 --> 00:45:30.899
God is able.

00:45:30.899 --> 00:45:34.199
I just got to trust and obey.

00:45:34.199 --> 00:45:35.039
Let's pray.

00:45:35.039 --> 00:45:36.579
Father, we love you.

00:45:37.339 --> 00:45:39.059
Thank you for loving us.

00:45:39.059 --> 00:45:41.219
Thank you for the precious word of God.

00:45:43.659 --> 00:45:46.059
I thank you for the subject matter this evening.

00:45:46.999 --> 00:45:48.659
I thank you for how you've used your word

00:45:48.659 --> 00:45:50.759
to convict me in my life.

00:45:53.819 --> 00:45:56.979
God, I pray that we'd take a few moments this evening

00:45:57.939 --> 00:46:00.819
to really evaluate our lives.

00:46:02.259 --> 00:46:06.339
I think about what Mary said to those servants

00:46:07.099 --> 00:46:07.939
in John 2.

00:46:10.379 --> 00:46:12.499
Speaking of Jesus, she said to those servants,

00:46:12.499 --> 00:46:14.439
whatsoever he saith unto you, do.

00:46:16.299 --> 00:46:20.279
God, I pray that we'd have that type of obedient heart.

00:46:21.919 --> 00:46:24.619
That, Lord, I will obey.

00:46:26.659 --> 00:46:29.419
You've given us your word, and we're so thankful for it.

00:46:30.419 --> 00:46:35.419
I pray that we'd get back to the matter of obedience,

00:46:36.659 --> 00:46:41.659
that we'd live, walk in obedience, that you would bless.

00:46:44.579 --> 00:46:47.259
I pray that if there's some specific area,

00:46:48.099 --> 00:46:49.539
I've only mentioned a few,

00:46:49.539 --> 00:46:53.179
but perhaps there's some specific area in our lives

00:46:53.179 --> 00:46:57.739
that the Holy Spirit of God would just prick our hearts.

00:46:57.739 --> 00:46:59.379
We ask you to do that, Lord,

00:47:02.139 --> 00:47:03.739
that we'd get it right with you,

00:47:04.699 --> 00:47:07.399
that we'd renew that commitment to obedience,

00:47:08.299 --> 00:47:09.859
and see your hand of blessing.

00:47:10.739 --> 00:47:12.259
We pray that in the next few moments,

00:47:12.259 --> 00:47:15.339
as we have opportunity to respond,

00:47:15.339 --> 00:47:16.899
I pray that you'd bless, that you'd move.

00:47:16.899 --> 00:47:19.259
We pray that you'd be glorified.

00:47:19.259 --> 00:47:21.499
For it's in Christ's name we pray, would you.
