1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,719
chapter number nine as we continue our series on Sunday evenings through the book of Genesis.

2
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:12,600
And last week, as you'll recall, we were in the first seven verses of Genesis 9.

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:18,079
Tonight we'll be in verses 8 through 17, Genesis 9, verses 8 through 17.

4
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:23,799
And let me just bring you up to speed with those events that have transpired in leading

5
00:00:23,799 --> 00:00:27,280
up to the text of Scripture that we'll study this evening.

6
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,879
Of course, at the end of chapter number 8, the Bible gives us the information that Noah

7
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:37,959
and his family, they departed the ark, the animals, they came off of the ark, and God

8
00:00:37,959 --> 00:00:43,720
had given them the direction to do so, and God gave them that direction and they obeyed.

9
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:49,919
We find the first matter of business after leaving the ark was that Noah built an altar

10
00:00:49,919 --> 00:00:52,639
and he made offerings unto the Lord.

11
00:00:52,639 --> 00:00:57,439
The Bible tells us in verse number 20 of Genesis 8 that he offered burnt offerings

12
00:00:57,439 --> 00:00:58,479
on the altar.

13
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:03,119
We understand that God was pleased with these offerings, for it tells us in verse number

14
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:09,239
21 that the Lord smelled a sweet savor, and notice what the Bible says, and the Lord said

15
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:10,800
in his heart.

16
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,639
And what God said in his heart in verses 21 and 22, as it's recorded there at the end

17
00:01:15,639 --> 00:01:20,680
of Genesis chapter number 8, will really be further expounded on in the text of Scripture

18
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:25,080
that we're studying this evening in verses 8 through 17.

19
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,599
We find that the Bible says that what God said, the Lord said in his heart, I will not

20
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:36,040
again curse the ground anymore for man's sake, for the imagination of man's heart is evil

21
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:42,279
from his youth, neither will I against my anymore everything living as I have done.

22
00:01:42,279 --> 00:01:47,040
While the earth remaineth, seed time and harvest and cold and heat and summer and winter and

23
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,559
day and night shall not cease.

24
00:01:50,559 --> 00:01:56,360
As we studied last week on Sunday evening, the first seven verses, God begins to provide

25
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:02,720
Noah and his family with direction, instruction, if you will, for life after the flood.

26
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:07,839
As they come off the ark and they make those offerings, those sacrifices unto the Lord,

27
00:02:07,839 --> 00:02:12,119
we find that the Lord speaks to them, God blessed Noah and his sons and said unto them,

28
00:02:12,119 --> 00:02:16,639
beginning in verse number 1 of chapter number 9, and gave them instruction with regard to

29
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:18,880
living life after the flood.

30
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:24,679
I'm thankful, as I've mentioned last week, that God has given us instruction in his word

31
00:02:24,679 --> 00:02:28,160
and he's given us direction for how to live our lives.

32
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:34,440
It was important for Noah and his family to understand how they were to live that behavior

33
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,520
which would please the Lord.

34
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:41,679
I'm often reminded of the great truth of Ephesians 5 in verse number 10, where Paul says to the

35
00:02:41,679 --> 00:02:47,119
believers of Ephesus that we're to prove what is acceptable in the sight of the Lord.

36
00:02:47,119 --> 00:02:51,839
That's a process of studying the word of God and digging into God's word, examining

37
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:58,759
the instruction that God has given us within his word to determine that which is well-pleasing,

38
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:01,960
that which is acceptable in the sight of the Lord.

39
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:07,800
I'm thankful that God has been faithful to give us instruction, to give us direction.

40
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:12,800
Can you imagine if we had no Bible?

41
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,960
It's a hard thought for us to even comprehend.

42
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:23,759
Many that are within our congregation, and we think about, of course, even my children

43
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:30,440
and young people that have been here for years, just how they've always had a Bible.

44
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:36,279
They never were in a place where maybe they didn't have a Bible, they didn't have instruction,

45
00:03:36,279 --> 00:03:41,199
they didn't have the direction that God's given us in his word, but I'm so thankful

46
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,919
that we've been blessed, that we have the Bible, we have the instruction, that God has

47
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:50,360
been faithful to give us his word.

48
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:56,199
I know I've mentioned in the past in various settings that it's not as if God is sitting

49
00:03:56,199 --> 00:04:00,080
back and allowing us to live life and saying, nope, that's not going to work, that's not

50
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,440
going to cut it, that doesn't please me, no, try again.

51
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:11,160
We just were aimlessly, helplessly, hopelessly trying in vain to find out what might please

52
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,160
God.

53
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:17,079
No, he's given us his word, and he tells us, these are the things that please me.

54
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:22,320
You find that on many occasions, we find that the Bible tells us, even as we look at 1 Corinthians

55
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,079
chapter 10, and use the example that Paul would give to the believers of the church

56
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:30,839
in Corinth, he says, with many of them, God was not well pleased.

57
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:33,000
Okay, we'll take note of that.

58
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,440
That behavior that is mentioned did not please God, and therefore, I ought not behave in

59
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,880
like manner.

60
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:47,679
We find that God gave instruction to Noah and to his family, and what a blessing that

61
00:04:47,679 --> 00:04:48,679
is.

62
00:04:48,679 --> 00:04:53,399
We come to verse number 8, and this evening we'll look at verses 8 through 17, and if

63
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:58,000
you're taking notes, this is actually lesson number 31 through the book of Genesis, believe

64
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,079
it or not.

65
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:05,359
Lesson number 31, the Noahic Covenant, the Noahic Covenant, and often we talk about the

66
00:05:05,359 --> 00:05:11,600
Abrahamic Covenant, and the Davidic Covenant, and those things, and this is the Noahic Covenant,

67
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,600
and really it's captured for us in verses 8 through 17.

68
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,799
We'll read the text of Scripture, and then get into the lesson this evening.

69
00:05:18,799 --> 00:05:25,880
The Bible says this in verse number 8 of Genesis 9, and God spake unto Noah and to his sons

70
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,839
with him, saying,

71
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:35,399
And I, behold, I establish My covenant with you, and with your seed after you, and with

72
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:40,559
every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast

73
00:05:40,559 --> 00:05:46,279
of the earth with you, from all that go out of the ark to every beast of the earth.

74
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:51,359
And I will establish My covenant with you, neither shall all flesh be cut off any more

75
00:05:51,359 --> 00:05:53,799
by the waters of a flood.

76
00:05:53,799 --> 00:05:57,440
Neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.

77
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,720
And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between Me and you, and every

78
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,760
living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations.

79
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:14,000
I do set My bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between Me and

80
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
the earth.

81
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,220
And it shall come to pass when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen

82
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,619
in the cloud.

83
00:06:21,619 --> 00:06:25,140
And I will remember My covenant, which is between Me and you, and every living creature

84
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,140
of all flesh.

85
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:30,059
And the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.

86
00:06:30,059 --> 00:06:35,899
And the bow shall be in the cloud, and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting

87
00:06:35,899 --> 00:06:41,260
covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.

88
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:45,459
And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant which I have established between

89
00:06:45,459 --> 00:06:50,420
Me and all flesh that is upon the earth.

90
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,500
And we speak about the rainbow.

91
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:59,700
What a joy, as you would think about the beauty after a storm, and maybe those storm clouds

92
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:03,380
are moving out, and you see a beautiful rainbow.

93
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:09,660
There are times in which the sight is so spectacular that you want to capture it on camera, and

94
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:16,500
just be able to have that image reminding you of the beauty of that rainbow.

95
00:07:16,579 --> 00:07:21,339
Not long ago, there was just a terrible storm that had come through our neighborhood, and

96
00:07:21,339 --> 00:07:25,899
Joseph and I, just shortly after, were walking through the neighborhood, and we saw a double

97
00:07:25,899 --> 00:07:32,179
rainbow, and it was just so vivid and so beautiful, and we took some pictures, and it was just

98
00:07:32,179 --> 00:07:33,179
beautiful.

99
00:07:33,179 --> 00:07:37,859
But when we think about the rainbow, we ought to be reminded of the Noahic covenant and

100
00:07:37,859 --> 00:07:45,059
understanding that this is the token that God gave to Noah and to his sons with regard

101
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,700
to this covenant that we'll study this evening.

102
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:52,660
We'll get into that token in just a little while, but it is interesting that we find

103
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:55,859
that God gave that sign to Noah.

104
00:07:55,859 --> 00:07:59,700
As we look at the text of Scripture and we deal with this subject, I want you to see

105
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,220
the details of the covenant.

106
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,540
Notice the details of the covenant.

107
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:07,200
It's interesting to me that it is God that initiated this covenant.

108
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:13,359
It is God that is the initiator, and He is the one that gives the terms of the covenant.

109
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:18,239
You notice in verse number 8 that the Bible says that God spake unto Noah, and He says

110
00:08:18,239 --> 00:08:25,720
in verse number 9, and I, behold, I establish my covenant with you and with your seed after

111
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,720
you.

112
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,480
Remember, as we mentioned at the end of verse number 8, after Noah built that altar and

113
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:37,840
he offered those burnt offerings on the altar, that God smelled that sweet savor and the

114
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:42,919
Lord said in his heart, and we looked at those verses already, but now God is speaking to

115
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:49,359
Noah and to his sons, and He's providing Noah and his sons with the details of this covenant.

116
00:08:49,359 --> 00:08:51,280
He is the initiator.

117
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:55,760
He is the one that will give the terms of the covenant.

118
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,239
We know the details as they're given to us there in verse number 9, that He says that

119
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:06,400
it's a covenant that He establishes, notice what He says, with you and with your seed

120
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,320
after you.

121
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:14,200
We'll look at the impact of some of these statements here in just a few moments, but

122
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:21,159
we notice that God is providing the details with regard to this covenant, the Noahic covenant

123
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:24,520
that He's making in this portion of Scripture.

124
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:29,059
It's interesting that God's speaking to Noah and to his sons, and He says to you and then

125
00:09:29,059 --> 00:09:32,359
with your seed after you, but notice what He says in verse number 10.

126
00:09:32,359 --> 00:09:37,239
Again, He will make this reference throughout the portion of Scripture, but we find that

127
00:09:37,239 --> 00:09:44,479
He says here that He, with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle,

128
00:09:44,479 --> 00:09:49,679
of every beast of the earth with you, from all that go out of the ark to every beast

129
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:55,880
of the earth, and we find that this covenant, we understand that God is the creator, that

130
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,880
He's created all of the plant life, animal life, and of course, all of the animals.

131
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,280
of course, human beings.

132
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,240
He is the Lord God Omnipotent.

133
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,360
He is the Creator of the universe.

134
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,980
And He's making this covenant.

135
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,400
You'll recall with me

136
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,200
the death that was the result of the flood.

137
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,320
And not only did every living creature,

138
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,720
speaking of man, that died,

139
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,960
but all of those that were not on the ark,

140
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,840
they died.

141
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,960
We see today, even as we've studied

142
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,680
throughout the portions of Scripture

143
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,440
in Genesis 6, 7, and 8,

144
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,360
as we think about the fossil records

145
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,840
and we see so much of the evidence

146
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,480
of the flood of Noah's day

147
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,240
through the fossil record

148
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,280
and all that is given.

149
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,520
And so God is establishing this covenant

150
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,920
with His creation.

151
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,240
Of course, with mankind being

152
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,920
the crown of His creation, if you will.

153
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,240
And we mentioned that as we studied

154
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,800
Genesis chapter number one.

155
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,080
And we find that He's giving this instruction.

156
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,040
And notice what He says

157
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,920
when He provides the details.

158
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,360
As we look in verse number 11,

159
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,720
He says, I will establish my covenant with you.

160
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,480
Again, we notice throughout this covenant

161
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,040
that this is a covenant that God is making.

162
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,160
He's the initiator.

163
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,720
He's the one making the details,

164
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,000
giving the details.

165
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,680
This is not a covenant

166
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,360
that is conditional or dependent

167
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,080
on anything that Noah

168
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,520
or any of His descendants will do.

169
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,240
This is a promise, a covenant,

170
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,960
that God is making

171
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,000
to His creation.

172
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,440
Of course, Noah being the direct recipient

173
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,960
in His children, His adult sons,

174
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,880
as they came off of the ark.

175
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,960
He says this,

176
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:39,800
neither shall all flesh be cut off any more

177
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,600
by the waters of a flood.

178
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,320
Neither shall there any more

179
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:47,080
be a flood to destroy the earth.

180
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:51,120
Now, as we'd see the details of this

181
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,840
and we'd notice here in verse number 11,

182
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,920
the Bible tells us

183
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,760
that He will not destroy the earth.

184
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,720
He says that all flesh

185
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,280
should not be cut off any more

186
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,320
by the waters of a flood.

187
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,200
He will not destroy the earth by a flood.

188
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,480
And we'd understand the detail here

189
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,320
that is given,

190
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,200
but also we'd understand

191
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,480
by looking at this detail

192
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,320
that there was a global flood.

193
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,919
Why would God have to promise Noah

194
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:21,639
and generations to come

195
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:24,200
that He would never destroy the earth again

196
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,600
with a global flood

197
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,200
if there were not a global flood?

198
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,440
You remember as we studied

199
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,960
Genesis 6, 7, and 8

200
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,240
and we dealt with the subject

201
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,520
of the global flood

202
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,760
and we dealt with that passage of Scripture

203
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,559
and we spoke about the truth

204
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:38,400
and there are those

205
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,440
that of course will be the scoffers

206
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,279
that will say,

207
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:44,559
no, it was just a regional flood.

208
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:46,600
It was not a global flood.

209
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,639
No, we understand the earth was destroyed.

210
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,360
It was a global flood

211
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,760
and therefore we find that in the details

212
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,240
of the Noahic covenant,

213
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,559
it gives evidence to the fact

214
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:58,240
that it was a global flood.

215
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,480
Notice what he says,

216
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,600
neither shall there anymore be a flood

217
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,279
to destroy the earth.

218
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,960
Even in our lives, in our lifetime,

219
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,840
we have seen local floods.

220
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,800
We have read about the catastrophes

221
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,000
that have been suffered by many

222
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,200
that have experienced these localized floods.

223
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,680
In fact, while my in-laws

224
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,800
were missionaries in Thailand,

225
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,160
they suffered a terrible flood in Thailand.

226
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,919
I don't remember the exact year

227
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:29,960
that they were there

228
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,160
when they had that flood,

229
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,240
but I remember seeing pictures

230
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,040
and we as a family being deeply concerned

231
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,919
for their welfare and their well-being

232
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,600
and where would they be able to go?

233
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,760
Where would they find refuge and safety

234
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,160
and would they be able to get out of the city

235
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,160
and all of those things?

236
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,080
And it was a destructive flood,

237
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,120
but it was a local flood.

238
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,639
And if it was only a local flood,

239
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:56,680
then this covenant that is made here

240
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,240
would be null and void

241
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,840
because there have been local floods

242
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,559
for generations.

243
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:04,200
But there's never been another global flood.

244
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,480
There's only been one global flood.

245
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,279
There only will ever be one global flood.

246
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:10,960
And that was the flood of Noah's day.

247
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,400
That's when God said,

248
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,440
as we read and studied in Genesis 6,

249
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,800
when He saw the wickedness of mankind

250
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,600
and all that was going on,

251
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,119
the violence that filled the earth,

252
00:14:22,119 --> 00:14:26,559
He said to Noah in v. 13 of Genesis 6,

253
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,800
the end of all flesh has come before Me,

254
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,040
for the earth is filled with violence through them,

255
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,720
and behold, I will destroy them

256
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,360
with the earth.

257
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,959
And He did.

258
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,800
Then He makes a covenant.

259
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,480
When we think about the details of the covenant,

260
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,880
we see that God is the initiator.

261
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,239
He's the one that gives the terms

262
00:14:45,239 --> 00:14:47,839
that it's to Noah and to future generations.

263
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,000
It's a covenant that is not conditional.

264
00:14:50,119 --> 00:14:53,360
It is a covenant that is unconditional.

265
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,800
It's not based upon the actions of Noah

266
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,080
or his descendants.

267
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,399
This is God saying,

268
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,480
I am establishing this covenant with you

269
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,800
and with future generations.

270
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,640
And He tells them that not only would it be for them,

271
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,559
of course, all of His creation is included.

272
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:09,880
And we look in v. 10,

273
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,040
and then He says that there would never be a flood

274
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,200
that would destroy the entire earth.

275
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,200
What a great promise.

276
00:15:17,239 --> 00:15:21,920
We think about the details of this covenant.

277
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,520
Yes, it's mindful the destruction of the flood.

278
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,600
And think about Noah.

279
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,559
See, God didn't have to convince Noah

280
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:31,160
that there was a global flood.

281
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,279
Noah had spent all that time in the ark.

282
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,360
He knew there was a global flood, right?

283
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,440
And he was well aware of the destruction.

284
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,600
He was well aware of that which happened.

285
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,760
He had just stepped off the ark

286
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,399
there at the end of chapter number eight,

287
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:51,399
and he, of course, was there at life right after the flood.

288
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,360
He saw what was going on before the flood.

289
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,679
He then, of course, had safety refuge in the ark.

290
00:15:57,679 --> 00:15:59,640
And then he comes off of the ark,

291
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:03,880
and God tells him this truth with regard to this covenant.

292
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,279
He did not need to be convinced of a global flood.

293
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:08,760
But for some reason in our society today,

294
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,520
there are many that seek to undermine

295
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,360
the authority of the word of God.

296
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,679
And they seek to, of course,

297
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:17,640
as they would attack the first 11 chapters

298
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,160
of the book of Genesis and destroy the foundation,

299
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,559
if you will, they're seeking to cause people

300
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:26,200
to have doubt in what God has said.

301
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,239
There was a global flood, but God's made a promise

302
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:32,160
that there would never be such a flood again.

303
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,320
Notice, as we would continue to look

304
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,520
through the text of Scripture

305
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,600
and consider the details of the covenant,

306
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,880
that there's a sign that is given.

307
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,959
I mentioned it by way of introduction.

308
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,720
The token of the covenant there was a rainbow.

309
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,160
Notice in verse number 12,

310
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,640
and God said, this is the token of the covenant

311
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,959
which I make between me and you

312
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,839
and every living creature that is with you

313
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,119
for perpetual generations.

314
00:16:58,119 --> 00:16:59,399
He says, this is what it is.

315
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:02,000
I do set my bow in the cloud,

316
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,640
and it shall be for a token of a covenant

317
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,480
between me and the earth.

318
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,959
This is very interesting to me.

319
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,040
I had not really thought of it in this manner

320
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,920
until I began preparation.

321
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,720
Of course, I've studied through

322
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,880
and I've read through Genesis countless times,

323
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:23,000
but I never really considered this thought

324
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,839
as we look here at the token, the bow.

325
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,040
He says in verse number 14,

326
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,520
it shall come to pass when I bring a cloud over the earth

327
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,119
that the bow shall be in the cloud.

328
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:35,440
Notice what he says, and I will remember my covenant,

329
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,760
which is between me and you

330
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,800
and every living creature of all flesh.

331
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,160
But notice what it says as we look in verse number 16,

332
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,320
and the bow shall be in the cloud.

333
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,760
Notice this, and I will look upon it.

334
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:52,040
So often I think about me looking at the rainbow.

335
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:55,399
So often I think about me being here on earth

336
00:17:55,399 --> 00:17:56,880
and you being here on earth,

337
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,200
and we endure a storm and we see the rainbow

338
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,559
as God's people and having a level of understanding

339
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,839
of Genesis 9 and the Noahic covenant.

340
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:08,279
And we say, that's the token,

341
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:11,559
that's the sign that God did destroy the earth

342
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:14,640
once with a flood, but He will not do it again.

343
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,600
But the Bible tells us that God looks upon it.

344
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,279
And when He looks upon it, it says that I may remember.

345
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:26,399
It's not that God would forget, God is omniscient, right?

346
00:18:26,399 --> 00:18:29,880
But it's that God remembers the everlasting covenant

347
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,840
between God and every living creature of all flesh

348
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,599
that is upon the earth.

349
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:36,039
Isn't that precious?

350
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:37,720
To think from our vantage point,

351
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,919
we look and we see the rainbow and we are reminded

352
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:45,359
and we're encouraged by the truth

353
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:47,799
of what that would communicate to us

354
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:49,760
with regard to the Noahic covenant,

355
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,760
but God from heaven, He looks down and He sees the rainbow.

356
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:58,039
And He remembers the covenant that was made with Noah

357
00:18:58,039 --> 00:18:59,960
here in Genesis chapter number nine.

358
00:19:01,239 --> 00:19:04,640
The details are given to us in this portion of Scripture.

359
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,479
And I want you to consider

360
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:07,479
not only the details of the covenant,

361
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,679
but I want you to consider number two,

362
00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:10,960
the duration of the covenant.

363
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,320
The duration of the covenant.

364
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,119
Notice in verse number nine,

365
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:17,039
and we've mentioned these things already,

366
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:17,880
but at the end of verse,

367
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,599
or we've read them as we've read the passage,

368
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:21,440
but notice at the end of verse number nine,

369
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,720
and with your seed after you.

370
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,559
We find again in verse number 11,

371
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:32,280
that it says that neither shall there any more

372
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,720
be a flood to destroy the earth.

373
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,720
That would give, those terms would reveal

374
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,679
that it would never again happen.

375
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,840
We find at the end of verse number 12,

376
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,080
it says that this covenant that He made

377
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,359
between me and you and every living creature

378
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:48,200
that is with you.

379
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:53,200
Notice the phrase, for perpetual generations.

380
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,960
We find that He says to them in verse number 16,

381
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,799
He says, and the bow shall be in the cloud

382
00:19:58,799 --> 00:19:59,960
and I will look upon it.

383
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,220
that I may remember," what does he say?

384
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:05,020
The everlasting covenant

385
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,040
between God and every living creature

386
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,180
of all flesh that is upon the earth.

387
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,400
God said unto Noah,

388
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,020
this is the token of the covenant

389
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,860
which I have established between me

390
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:17,800
and all flesh that is upon the earth.

391
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,400
We see the details of the covenant,

392
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,640
but we are mindful of the duration of the covenant.

393
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,440
That this is an everlasting covenant

394
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,800
as God calls it in v. 16.

395
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,240
That it's for perpetual generations.

396
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,680
That we still today in 2020,

397
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:38,000
many thousands of years after the global flood

398
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,920
of Noah's day, after the terms

399
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:44,120
of the Noahic covenant were initially given,

400
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,480
we still today can find hope

401
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,440
in the truth of the Noahic covenant.

402
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,680
When we see that rainbow,

403
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:54,200
we can be mindful of what our God has said.

404
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,480
When we think about this covenant,

405
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,680
we think about the details and the duration,

406
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,800
and we must be mindful of the fact

407
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,240
that it's the God that made the covenant

408
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,400
that is of significant importance.

409
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:09,960
I'm thankful that we serve a God who is eternal.

410
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,080
How could He make an everlasting covenant

411
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,560
if He Himself were not eternal?

412
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,600
Amen?

413
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,800
We think about the fact that He has all power,

414
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,440
that He controls all things.

415
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:26,200
He is in control of His creation.

416
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,600
We find that our God rules over all,

417
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,920
that by Him all things consist,

418
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:36,120
and He holds the power of the universe in His hands.

419
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,520
Remember, we looked this morning at Matthew 28,

420
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,600
in verse 18, all power is given unto me

421
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,040
in heaven and in earth.

422
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,440
And I'm mindful as I think about the details

423
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,520
of the covenant and the duration of the covenant,

424
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,960
and we study that which God gives us here

425
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,760
in Genesis chapter nine, what Noah received,

426
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,480
but how we rejoice in understanding

427
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,360
the God of the covenant,

428
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,440
the God that was able to make this covenant,

429
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,200
to give these details,

430
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,800
to establish the duration being eternal or everlasting,

431
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:11,040
and we find that this God is our God.

432
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,880
And that's encouraging.

433
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,480
I'm mindful of Psalm 48,

434
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,440
where the Bible speaks about the greatness of God.

435
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:23,440
In fact, we often sing as a Bible psalm,

436
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,640
the Psalm 48 verses one and two,

437
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,120
a Bible song, great is the Lord

438
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,080
and greatly to be praised.

439
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:32,160
And we know that song, verses one and two of Psalm 48,

440
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,800
and you skip down to the end of the psalm,

441
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,960
I believe it's in verse number 10,

442
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,840
it says that this God is our God forever.

443
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:43,200
And what a joy to know the God of the universe,

444
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,920
to know that the God that made this covenant with Noah

445
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,840
is our God.

446
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,400
It's interesting that this truth is mentioned in Isaiah 54,

447
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,560
turn over if you will,

448
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,680
and we'll close with this passage of scripture

449
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,920
and we'll get to our video,

450
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,400
our update video from the Davastus family.

451
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,440
But in Isaiah chapter 54,

452
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,800
it's interesting reference that is given here

453
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,960
with regard to Noah and the Noahic covenant.

454
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,360
And it's interesting for this purpose,

455
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:15,640
I've often said that throughout the word of God,

456
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,200
there are many that would attack

457
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,720
the first 11 chapters of the book of Genesis.

458
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,440
There are many, of course,

459
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,000
that would attack creation and all of those things.

460
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,440
But we've made the case throughout our study

461
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,920
of the book of Genesis,

462
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,760
that the truth that is given in the book of Genesis

463
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:34,720
is not only found in the book of Genesis.

464
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,800
The truth is found throughout the word of God.

465
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,760
We find that Jesus, in fact,

466
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,840
mentioned back to the days of Noah,

467
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,160
and he speaks about that which was happening

468
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,080
and dealing with the second coming of Christ.

469
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,560
And we find that Peter spoke about

470
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,120
the ignorance of the people,

471
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,200
that they were willingly ignorant

472
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,440
of the fact that the earth that once was

473
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,960
was destroyed by the waters.

474
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,560
We find here in Isaiah 54 in verse number nine,

475
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:06,320
it says, for this is as the waters of Noah unto me,

476
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,680
for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah

477
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,920
should no more go over the earth,

478
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:14,120
so have I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee

479
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,440
nor rebuke thee.

480
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,880
And it's just an interesting reference

481
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,360
to Noah and to the waters of Noah

482
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,840
and dealing back with that which we find

483
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,680
in Genesis chapter nine with the Noahic covenant.

484
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,800
See, God said that he would never destroy the earth again

485
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,000
with a flood, with waters.

486
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
But we do find that in 2 Peter chapter number three,

487
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
the reference that I made just a moment ago

488
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,080
of those that were willingly ignorant

489
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,840
of the fact that the earth was destroyed

490
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,320
was overflowed with water and perished.

491
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:49,840
We see that in 2 Peter chapter three, verses five and six.

492
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,200
But we find this truth with regard to the day of the Lord.

493
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,400
In verse number 10, it says,

494
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,040
but the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night

495
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:00,200
in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise

496
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,320
and the elements shall melt with fervent heat.

497
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,320
The earth also and the works that are therein

498
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,480
shall be burned up,

499
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,400
seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved,

500
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,880
what manner of persons ought ye to be

501
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,520
in all holy conversation and godliness,

502
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:20,520
looking for and hasting under the coming of the day of God,

503
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:24,440
wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved

504
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,360
and the elements shall melt with fervent heat.

505
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,120
Nevertheless, we, according to his promise,

506
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,000
look for new heavens and a new earth

507
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,720
wherein dwelleth righteousness.

508
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:40,720
And we find that rate prior to the passage

509
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,200
that I just read in verses 10 through 13,

510
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,280
we read that verse about the promise of God.

511
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,280
Jesus is coming again.

512
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,840
We believe that he's coming soon.

513
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,120
And we believe that as we look at even the things

514
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,640
that are taking place in our society today,

515
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:59,280
that they're giving us that confidence and that hope

516
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:02,520
that Jesus is coming again and he's coming soon.

517
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,360
The Bible says,

518
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,800
the Lord is not slack concerning his promise

519
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,160
as some men count slackness.

520
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,320
But his long suffering to us,

521
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,480
we're not willing that any should perish,

522
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,720
but that all should come to repentance.

523
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,480
No, the earth will not be destroyed

524
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,880
by a flood of waters ever again,

525
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,480
based upon the truth of the Noahic covenant.

526
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,680
The details are given in Genesis 9.

527
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,480
The duration is revealed to us

528
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,600
that it will be with you in your seat after you,

529
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,440
that it will never happen again,

530
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,440
that it's for perpetual generations.

531
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,640
It's an everlasting covenant.

532
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:37,400
But the earth will one day be dissolved with a fervent heat,

533
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,680
according to what we see in 2 Peter 3,

534
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,880
verses 10 through 13.

535
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,280
We understand that to be the case.

536
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,360
Jesus is coming again.

537
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,920
And when we understand the truth of his second return,

538
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:52,080
yes, we as God's people are looking for the rapture.

539
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,520
We're looking for the day in which

540
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,280
the trumpet of the Lord shall sound

541
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,480
and the dead in Christ shall be raised.

542
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,080
And then we, which are alive and remain

543
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,800
shall be caught up together with the Lord

544
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,880
to meet him in the clouds.

545
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,120
And so shall we ever be with the Lord.

546
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,960
1 Thessalonians chapter number four.

547
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,320
What a fabulous passage of scripture.

548
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,480
I mean, great truth that is given.

549
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,120
Jesus is coming again.

550
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,480
But that begins, the rapture begins

551
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,640
that seven-year tribulation

552
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,920
after which Jesus will come back

553
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,920
as King of kings and Lord of lords.

554
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,240
He will come as the conquering king.

555
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,680
We find that, of course, the battle of Armageddon

556
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,280
and various things will take place

557
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,760
followed by the millennial reign of Christ.

558
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:36,920
As we think about the terms of the Noahic covenant

559
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,920
and the encouragement that we receive,

560
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,440
there's a warning for one that might not know

561
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,480
the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal Savior.

562
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,680
Jesus is coming again.

563
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:51,360
And He has given us the opportunity to hear the Gospel.

564
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,680
For you that perhaps have listened to our services,

565
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,760
you've heard the truth of the Gospel.

566
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,800
The death, the burial, the glorious resurrection

567
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,000
of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

568
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,760
Neither is there salvation in any other

569
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,240
for there's none other name under heaven

570
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,080
given among men whereby we must be saved.

571
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,320
That name is Jesus.

572
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:13,400
And the only way to avoid the destruction that will come,

573
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,920
not through a flood, but of course,

574
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:19,200
we think about the terms of the tribulation

575
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,320
and then followed by the destruction

576
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:24,600
that we dealt with there in 2 Peter 3,

577
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,800
is to trust the Lord Jesus Christ, your personal Savior.

578
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,360
And I'm so thankful that Jesus saves.

579
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,360
We sing the song, we rejoice in the truth,

580
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,040
Hebrews 7 and verse number 25,

581
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,720
that He is able to save to the uttermost

582
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,200
of all men that come to God.

583
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:41,160
And what a joy to know that our Lord,

584
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,920
that He offers forgiveness and salvation.

585
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,400
The Noahic covenant, we see the details

586
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,920
and we see the duration.

587
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:53,480
I'm so thankful that our God, my Savior,

588
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:57,119
that He is able to provide such a covenant

589
00:28:57,119 --> 00:28:59,360
thousands of years ago.

590
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,440
And still today, when we see the rainbow,

591
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,960
we can be reminded of the promise that God gave to Noah

592
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,720
so many years ago.

593
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,119
And what a great God that we serve.

594
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:11,559
He always does what He says He will do.

595
00:29:11,559 --> 00:29:14,280
He keeps His word and we can thank God for that.

596
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,880
We'll close with a word of prayer

597
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,600
and then we're gonna watch this update video

598
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,760
from the Damascus family.

599
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,000
We do trust it'll be a blessing to you

600
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,600
to see and hear what God has done

601
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,280
in and through their ministry over the last 18 months or so.

602
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,800
And so let's have a word of prayer

603
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,119
and then we'll get right into the video.

604
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:30,480
Father, we love you and we thank you for loving us.

605
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,600
Thank you for the opportunity to study

606
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,280
this passage of scripture here in Genesis chapter number nine

607
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,360
and I pray, Father, that you would help us

608
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,000
to be encouraged and strengthened

609
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,200
as we are mindful of the details and the duration

610
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,960
and to rejoice in the fact that you as the initiator,

611
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,320
that you set the terms and, Lord,

612
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,960
that you've given this truth

613
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,440
and how we can be reminded each time

614
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,760
we see a rainbow of this promise

615
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,300
that you gave to Noah on this day.

616
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:00,200
Lord, I pray that if there's one that's not sure of heaven.

617
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:09,660
And they would be, Lord, that Your Holy Spirit would just convict them, Lord, convict them

618
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:13,100
of their sin, convince them of their need for Christ.

619
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:17,460
I pray, Lord, that they would trust the Lord Jesus Christ before it's eternally too late.

620
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:20,380
We thank You for the opportunity to participate in world missions.

621
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:24,500
We thank You for the Damascus family there in Scotland and for the work that You're doing

622
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,500
in and through their ministry.

623
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:30,060
And I pray that as we watch this video that You would help us to be encouraged and strengthen

624
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:36,300
that You would help us to have a renewed vision and passion for Thee and to pray more specifically

625
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,900
for the ministry there in Scotland.

626
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,260
We pray that You'd bless and we'll thank You for it.

627
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:43,460
In Christ's name we pray, amen.
