1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,519
if you're taking notes, I would say this, that the response of the eunuch, his response

2
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:12,039
to Philip reveals humility. His response reveals humility. The question in verse number 30

3
00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:18,280
is a very important question. It is a question in which opens the door for this conversation.

4
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:23,680
And the question is very simple. The Bible tells us that Philip ran to this chariot,

5
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:29,639
the Spirit of God told him to go there, and he heard this eunuch reading. Obviously, he's

6
00:00:29,639 --> 00:00:33,479
reading out loud, he's reading audibly, he's reading the prophet Isaiah. As we go through

7
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:38,919
the passage, we see that he's reading Isaiah 53. What a great passage of Scripture. And

8
00:00:38,919 --> 00:00:44,840
he's reading this portion of Scripture, and Philip says to this eunuch, do you understand?

9
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:52,520
Understandest thou what thou readest? Now, I've said that his response reveals humility,

10
00:00:52,520 --> 00:01:00,680
because what he says is, how can I except some man should guide me? That is a response

11
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:05,959
of humility, is it not? Certainly, it would be easy for a man of his position, we've mentioned

12
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:11,760
already that verse 27 gives us some insight to his position, that he could have brushed

13
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:18,480
it off and said, I'm good, I understand, even though he didn't. Right? We've been in situations

14
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:23,720
like that. We have encountered experiences in our lives where people will say that they

15
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:28,400
understand something, and they really don't. They just don't want to be embarrassed. They

16
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,860
feel like it would be an embarrassment if they reveal that they don't understand something.

17
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:40,839
But the reality is that that's pride, and it hinders our ability to be taught. And so

18
00:01:40,839 --> 00:01:47,599
his response to the question that is asked reveals humility, and we find that this man,

19
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:52,480
this Ethiopian eunuch, can you imagine how things would have been so different in his

20
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:58,059
life if he said to Philip, if his response in verse number 31, instead of being one of

21
00:01:58,059 --> 00:02:02,480
humility, was one of pride, and he said, I'm good, carry on, there's no need for you to

22
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:10,479
be here. He would have continued on being ignorant of the truth that he was reading.

23
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:18,080
Right? It would have been tragic. And so his response of humility leads to the opportunity

24
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,520
for teaching. We find that as we think about this idea of having a teachable spirit, I

25
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,559
would say that it's of utmost importance that we are humble, that we have humility in our

26
00:02:28,559 --> 00:02:33,399
lives. The Bible speaks much about humility. The Bible tells us that God resisteth the

27
00:02:33,399 --> 00:02:38,880
proud, but He gives grace to the humble. James and Peter both tell us that. We find that

28
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:43,880
the Bible tells us in 1 Peter, right in that same section when he talks about God resisting

29
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:48,000
the proud and giving grace to the humble, in the 5th chapter, he mentions this, that

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,199
we are to be clothed in humility. And the reality is that the Bible tells us, if you

31
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:58,740
read the book of Proverbs, there are many references with regard to pride in the book

32
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:06,880
of Proverbs, and God hates pride. He hates pride. And we find that this response reveals

33
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:12,440
humility and how important it is that we, as we consider the subject matter of having

34
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:19,320
a teachable spirit, that it begins with humility. It begins with a recognition of, I don't understand

35
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:26,000
and I need to be taught. Right? None of us have arrived. None of us are at a place where

36
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,600
we have all knowledge. No, God has all knowledge, and we need to continue to have that teachable

37
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:37,479
spirit, and humility is so necessary. Notice the response. It continues in verse number

38
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:42,720
31. He says, how can I except some man should guide me? I would say this, as you look at

39
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,320
the remainder of verse number 31, it says, and he desired, Philip, that he would come

40
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:54,119
up and sit with him. So, his response reveals humility, but I would say that his invitation

41
00:03:54,119 --> 00:04:00,880
reveals desire. His invitation reveals desire. So, it's one thing to have the humility and

42
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:05,520
say, no, I don't understand what I'm reading. He says, how can I except some man should

43
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:12,000
guide me? But the remainder of the 31st verse here in Acts 8 says, he desired, Philip, that

44
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,880
he would come up and sit with him. I like that desire. And it reveals, this invitation

45
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:24,119
reveals that desire we mentioned as we looked in our very first lesson of the subject matter

46
00:04:24,119 --> 00:04:31,279
of teach me, how the plea of the psalmist when he cries out, teach me, that plea reveals

47
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:39,779
desire. It reveals that I want to learn. I want to be taught. You don't say, teach me

48
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:46,799
to someone if you don't want to learn, right? It reveals a desire to learn something. Again,

49
00:04:46,799 --> 00:04:53,839
it's not a use of flattery where the psalmist is just using some cliche of teach me and

50
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:58,959
using flattery. No, I believe as you look through the references in the book of Psalms

51
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:04,679
that the psalmist is earnestly desiring, he's longing to be taught.

52
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:12,119
I want you to think about this when you think about the invitation of this eunuch, the response

53
00:05:12,119 --> 00:05:17,200
revealing the humility, his invitation to have him come up into the chariot reveals

54
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:23,640
that desire. I want you to think about this truth this evening that the Lord Jesus Christ

55
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:28,399
in the book of Matthew, we looked at this last week, he says he offers an invitation

56
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:34,940
to come unto me, and he tells them, and learn of me. Now, think about this. If Jesus offers

57
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:41,480
an invitation that we would come and learn of him, but then we also have that teachable

58
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:47,239
spirit that we're saying, Lord, teach me, man, we're in a really good spot to learn.

59
00:05:47,239 --> 00:05:53,279
Wouldn't you agree? Because Jesus wants to teach us. The Holy Spirit of God who indwells

60
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:58,000
us is the teacher, one of his ministries, and so we're there in that place. I want

61
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,399
you to notice that if you look down to verse number 34, and we'll catch it back up in

62
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:06,320
verse 32, but I just want to jump down here for a moment, look in verse number 34, it

63
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:12,119
says, and the eunuch answered Philip and said, I pray thee. You see that phrase? He says,

64
00:06:12,119 --> 00:06:18,880
I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this of himself? Excuse me, let me read it.

65
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:25,720
It says, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this, of himself or of some other

66
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:34,640
man? I would say this, that this phrase, when he says, I pray thee, it gives us more insight

67
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:40,040
to his desire to be taught, correct? And you notice when he makes the statement in verse

68
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:46,079
number 34, when he says, of whom speaketh the prophet this, of himself or of some other

69
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:54,559
man, he's acknowledging his ignorance. He's acknowledging his confusion. He doesn't know,

70
00:06:54,559 --> 00:07:01,420
but he wants to be taught. He has humility. He has desire. I don't know how many days

71
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:05,320
ago it was, but in the devotional book that we've distributed for this week, there was

72
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:13,079
an illustration about a car that was broken down, and the man that had his car broken

73
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:17,760
down is on the side of the road there, and a man comes by and offers help, and he says,

74
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:23,880
no, I'm okay, I got it. And the one that offered the help was Henry Ford. And who better to

75
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:30,880
have provided assistance to the individual than Henry Ford himself, right? But the reality

76
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:36,559
is that the man that had been broken down, he didn't have humility and desire like we

77
00:07:36,559 --> 00:07:42,359
see here with the eunuch. He was like, no, I'm okay. I don't need your help. Okay. Henry

78
00:07:42,359 --> 00:07:46,320
Ford went on his way. It's interesting when you look at the illustration that was used

79
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:53,119
in that book. Henry Ford didn't insist on helping. Let me say this. God doesn'tâ€¦

80
00:07:53,119 --> 00:07:58,160
I believe that He teaches us some things. He takes us through some various schools of

81
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,260
learning, and we'll look at that as we go through this series over the next several

82
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:05,480
weeks and months. But the reality is that if we're going to learn, we have to have

83
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:13,119
a teachable spirit. And how do we develop that teachable spirit? I would say that humility

84
00:08:13,119 --> 00:08:20,320
and desire are keys to being teachable. If you have no desire to learn, you don't have

85
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:26,239
a teachable spirit, right? Have you ever met someone that has no desire to learn? And theyâ€¦

86
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:31,119
I remember when I was coaching Little League Baseball with Joseph when he was a little

87
00:08:31,119 --> 00:08:35,280
younger, and we're out there in coaching. And some of those kids, you're trying to teach

88
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:39,000
them how to play baseball, and they don't want to learn. They're there because their

89
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
parents want them to play baseball. And you're trying to teach them, and they're doing,

90
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,580
you know, it looks like they're doing ballet moves out in the outfield instead of paying

91
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:50,159
attention to what's going on in the field. And you're saying, this kid's going to get

92
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:56,599
hurt, you know? And just no desire. We can look at that in a whole host of avenues or

93
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:01,520
arenas this evening and speak about it. We're looking, as we think about this subject matter

94
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:06,479
in this series of Teach Me, looking at it from a spiritual perspective. I want to learn

95
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:12,080
the Word of God. I want to learn who God is. I want to know Him in a more intimate way.

96
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:18,479
I want to have that teachable spirit. It begins with humility. Desire is essential. And let

97
00:09:18,479 --> 00:09:22,840
me say this, as we continue looking through this passage of Scripture, I would say that

98
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:31,080
His profession and His baptism reveal understanding or reveal learning has taken place. Now, look

99
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:36,840
at it, if you will, in verse number 32. The Bible says this, the place of the Scripture

100
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:43,280
which He read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter, and like a lamb done before

101
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:51,280
His shearer, so opened He not His mouth. In His humiliation, His judgment was taken away,

102
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:57,320
and who shall declare His generation, for His life is taken from the earth? This is

103
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,159
Isaiah 53, and the eunuch answers,

104
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:04,459
Philip as they're looking at this place where he was reading in the Old Testament,

105
00:10:04,459 --> 00:10:07,659
and he says, as we made note of a moment ago,

106
00:10:07,659 --> 00:10:15,659
I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this, of himself or of some other man?

107
00:10:15,659 --> 00:10:18,159
I love verse number 35.

108
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:25,159
The Bible says, then Philip opened his mouth and began at the same Scripture

109
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:29,159
and preached unto him Jesus.

110
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:31,159
Amen?

111
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:35,659
So as we think about the reading and we think about the confusion and the ignorance

112
00:10:35,659 --> 00:10:40,659
that is evidenced through the questions that are given in verse number 34,

113
00:10:40,659 --> 00:10:44,659
the eunuch offers up these questions because there's confusion, there's ignorance.

114
00:10:44,659 --> 00:10:48,659
He doesn't know, but he wants to know.

115
00:10:48,659 --> 00:10:50,159
He says, I pray thee.

116
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:52,659
He's already demonstrated the humility.

117
00:10:52,659 --> 00:10:55,159
How can I except some man should guide me?

118
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:57,159
He's demonstrated his desire.

119
00:10:57,159 --> 00:11:02,159
And so now with that humility and that desire, with that teachable spirit,

120
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:05,159
now Philip is able to go up into the chariot,

121
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:08,159
he's able to see the passage of Scripture that he's reading,

122
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:12,159
and he's able to start in that same passage, in that same Scripture,

123
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:15,159
and preach unto him Jesus.

124
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:19,659
I think that it would be fair to say that preaching is not always teaching,

125
00:11:19,659 --> 00:11:22,659
and teaching is not always preaching,

126
00:11:22,659 --> 00:11:25,659
but oftentimes preaching includes teaching.

127
00:11:25,659 --> 00:11:27,659
Amen? Is that fair?

128
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:32,659
The Bible in the book of Ezra teaches us, it provides really an outline of preaching,

129
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:37,659
that you read the Word of God distinctly, you give the sense of it,

130
00:11:37,659 --> 00:11:40,659
and enable the people to understand it.

131
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:46,659
So we understand here that as he's preaching unto him Jesus,

132
00:11:46,659 --> 00:11:49,659
that we could say that he's teaching him.

133
00:11:49,659 --> 00:11:51,159
He's teaching him the truth.

134
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:55,159
He's teaching him what it is that he's reading in Isaiah 53,

135
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:57,659
and the Bible tells us in verse number 36,

136
00:11:57,659 --> 00:12:01,659
I want you to notice that the Bible says they went on their way.

137
00:12:01,659 --> 00:12:06,159
I'm not sure how long the preaching was in verse number 35.

138
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:13,659
I don't know how long Philip took to explain these biblical truths to this Ethiopian eunuch,

139
00:12:13,659 --> 00:12:17,659
but for however long it took, they were there, and it says they went on their way,

140
00:12:17,659 --> 00:12:19,659
and they came unto a certain water.

141
00:12:19,659 --> 00:12:22,659
I want you to notice again the question that is asked of the eunuch.

142
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:24,659
The eunuch says to Philip,

143
00:12:24,659 --> 00:12:31,159
See, here is water. What doth hinder me to be baptized?

144
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:36,659
Is that not, again, a revelation of humility and desire?

145
00:12:36,659 --> 00:12:38,659
He's asking a question.

146
00:12:38,659 --> 00:12:41,659
You know, when we ask questions, sometimes we sit in places,

147
00:12:41,659 --> 00:12:45,659
we're sitting in a classroom having some type of interaction.

148
00:12:45,659 --> 00:12:48,659
Maybe it's not even in a group setting,

149
00:12:48,659 --> 00:12:51,659
but sometimes we're embarrassed to ask questions,

150
00:12:51,659 --> 00:12:55,659
and the reality is that there are times in which we're embarrassed to ask questions,

151
00:12:55,659 --> 00:13:01,659
especially in a group setting because we don't want somebody else to think we don't know something.

152
00:13:01,659 --> 00:13:03,159
You know what I've learned over the years?

153
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:08,659
Many times there are other people in the room that have the same question that you have,

154
00:13:08,659 --> 00:13:12,659
and many times they don't want to ask it, and neither do you.

155
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:17,659
So the question never gets asked, and the teaching never can take place,

156
00:13:17,659 --> 00:13:21,659
and the reality is that asking questions is important.

157
00:13:21,659 --> 00:13:24,659
We should ask ourselves questions as we read the Word of God.

158
00:13:24,659 --> 00:13:26,659
We should go through the Scriptures,

159
00:13:26,659 --> 00:13:29,659
and as we go through and evaluate and study the Word of God,

160
00:13:29,659 --> 00:13:31,659
we're asking ourselves, What does this mean to me?

161
00:13:31,659 --> 00:13:33,659
What is it that God's trying to show me?

162
00:13:33,659 --> 00:13:35,659
What is He trying to teach me?

163
00:13:35,659 --> 00:13:37,659
Why did God include this in the Word of God?

164
00:13:37,659 --> 00:13:39,659
Have you ever asked yourself that question?

165
00:13:39,659 --> 00:13:41,659
There'll be times I'm reading the Scriptures and I'm saying,

166
00:13:41,659 --> 00:13:45,659
God, I understand that this is Your Word and You've included this,

167
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:48,659
but help me to understand why You've included this.

168
00:13:48,659 --> 00:13:52,659
Why is it that this piece of information, this portion of Scripture,

169
00:13:52,659 --> 00:13:55,659
why did You deem it necessary to be in the Word of God?

170
00:13:55,659 --> 00:13:59,659
Not that I'm questioning God or His authority for doing so,

171
00:13:59,659 --> 00:14:02,659
but I want to learn why it's there.

172
00:14:02,659 --> 00:14:04,659
I want to have a better understanding.

173
00:14:04,659 --> 00:14:07,659
And so, evidently, as His time in Jerusalem,

174
00:14:07,659 --> 00:14:09,659
the Bible tells us in verse number 27,

175
00:14:09,659 --> 00:14:11,659
they had come to Jerusalem for the worship.

176
00:14:11,659 --> 00:14:15,659
And so, obviously, there was some level of exposure

177
00:14:15,659 --> 00:14:21,659
that this man had to baptism in order for him to ask the question.

178
00:14:21,659 --> 00:14:24,659
And he says, Here is water.

179
00:14:24,659 --> 00:14:27,659
What doth hinder me to be baptized?

180
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:31,659
And great truth that Philip reveals.

181
00:14:31,659 --> 00:14:34,659
Again, we've used this many times over the years.

182
00:14:34,659 --> 00:14:38,659
You look at the truth of not only the mode of baptism,

183
00:14:38,659 --> 00:14:40,659
but who it is.

184
00:14:40,659 --> 00:14:42,659
Who is the candidate for baptism?

185
00:14:42,659 --> 00:14:45,659
We don't just baptize anyone because they want to get baptized.

186
00:14:45,659 --> 00:14:47,659
We don't baptize infants.

187
00:14:47,659 --> 00:14:52,659
We don't baptize people just to baptize them.

188
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:57,659
We understand that it's believers' baptism by immersion.

189
00:14:57,659 --> 00:14:59,659
We understand that.

190
00:14:59,659 --> 00:15:01,659
That's why baptism is so important.

191
00:15:01,659 --> 00:15:04,659
That's why, for many generations,

192
00:15:04,659 --> 00:15:09,659
Baptist people were referred to as Anabaptists, re-baptizers.

193
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:13,659
Why? Because we would reject the baptism of the state church

194
00:15:13,659 --> 00:15:16,659
because we don't believe in infant or paedo-baptism.

195
00:15:16,659 --> 00:15:18,659
And you see that here in this portion of Scripture.

196
00:15:18,659 --> 00:15:20,659
He says, What doth hinder me to be baptized?

197
00:15:20,659 --> 00:15:23,659
Philip doesn't just say, Oh, if you want to, let's go.

198
00:15:23,659 --> 00:15:26,659
No, he answers, he says in verse number 37,

199
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:28,659
Philip said,

200
00:15:34,659 --> 00:15:36,659
And notice what this eunuch says.

201
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:38,659
He answered and said,

202
00:15:44,659 --> 00:15:46,659
Isn't that a great profession?

203
00:15:46,659 --> 00:15:48,659
A great declaration?

204
00:15:48,659 --> 00:15:53,659
I would say to you that he didn't have the same opinion

205
00:15:53,659 --> 00:15:55,659
in verse number 30.

206
00:15:55,659 --> 00:15:57,659
He didn't know.

207
00:15:57,659 --> 00:15:58,659
Right?

208
00:15:58,659 --> 00:16:02,659
Of whom speaketh the prophet this?

209
00:16:02,659 --> 00:16:05,659
Of himself or of some other man?

210
00:16:05,659 --> 00:16:08,659
And Philip preaches unto him Jesus

211
00:16:08,659 --> 00:16:12,659
and he shows him how that he is the Messiah

212
00:16:12,659 --> 00:16:15,659
and that he came and he bled and he died

213
00:16:15,659 --> 00:16:17,659
and he was buried and he rose in victory

214
00:16:17,659 --> 00:16:20,659
and he is the Lamb that was slain

215
00:16:20,659 --> 00:16:22,659
before the foundation of the world.

216
00:16:22,659 --> 00:16:24,659
And you think about the preaching.

217
00:16:24,659 --> 00:16:26,659
Again, I don't know all that is contained

218
00:16:26,659 --> 00:16:28,659
within the preaching because the Bible simply says

219
00:16:28,659 --> 00:16:30,659
that he preached unto him Jesus,

220
00:16:30,659 --> 00:16:32,659
but obviously because of that humility

221
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,659
and because of that desire,

222
00:16:34,659 --> 00:16:37,659
there was some learning that took place.

223
00:16:37,659 --> 00:16:38,659
Amen?

224
00:16:38,659 --> 00:16:42,659
A teachable spirit leads to learning.

225
00:16:42,659 --> 00:16:43,659
Right?

226
00:16:43,659 --> 00:16:45,659
If we have a teachable spirit,

227
00:16:45,659 --> 00:16:47,659
it's going to lead to learning.

228
00:16:47,659 --> 00:16:50,659
It's going to result in learning.

229
00:16:50,659 --> 00:16:52,659
So we find that he says,

230
00:16:52,659 --> 00:16:58,659
I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.

231
00:16:58,659 --> 00:17:00,659
The Bible says that he commanded

232
00:17:00,659 --> 00:17:02,659
for the chariot to stand still

233
00:17:02,659 --> 00:17:05,659
and they went down both into the water,

234
00:17:05,659 --> 00:17:07,659
both Philip and the eunuch,

235
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:09,659
and he baptized him.

236
00:17:09,659 --> 00:17:11,659
Isn't that exciting?

237
00:17:11,659 --> 00:17:15,659
A man that was confused.

238
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:19,659
A man that was ignorant of the truth.

239
00:17:19,659 --> 00:17:20,659
He was reading.

240
00:17:20,659 --> 00:17:22,659
He had been in Jerusalem.

241
00:17:22,659 --> 00:17:26,659
He was reading the Old Testament.

242
00:17:26,659 --> 00:17:28,659
But God in His grace and His mercy,

243
00:17:28,659 --> 00:17:30,659
He takes Philip and He says,

244
00:17:30,659 --> 00:17:32,659
here's where you need to go.

245
00:17:32,659 --> 00:17:34,659
There's the chariot where you need to go.

246
00:17:34,659 --> 00:17:36,659
And Philip obeyed.

247
00:17:36,659 --> 00:17:38,659
And he's reading.

248
00:17:38,659 --> 00:17:40,659
He says, do you understand what you're reading?

249
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:42,659
Understandest thou what thou readest?

250
00:17:42,659 --> 00:17:45,659
How can I except some man should guide me?

251
00:17:45,659 --> 00:17:47,659
And by the end of the interaction,

252
00:17:47,659 --> 00:17:51,659
the man is saved and the man is baptized.

253
00:17:51,659 --> 00:17:53,659
It's precious.

254
00:17:53,659 --> 00:17:55,659
It says in verse number 39,

255
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:57,659
and when they were come up out of the water,

256
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:59,659
the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip

257
00:17:59,659 --> 00:18:01,659
that the eunuch saw him no more.

258
00:18:01,659 --> 00:18:04,659
But notice the last phrase of verse number 39,

259
00:18:04,659 --> 00:18:09,659
and he went on his way rejoicing.

260
00:18:09,659 --> 00:18:12,659
That's a blessed ending to this portion of Scripture

261
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:15,659
that he went on his way rejoicing.

262
00:18:15,659 --> 00:18:17,659
The Bible tells us in verse number 40

263
00:18:17,659 --> 00:18:19,659
about Philip and we see where he is

264
00:18:19,659 --> 00:18:21,659
and what's going on there.

265
00:18:21,659 --> 00:18:23,659
But when you think about the subject matter

266
00:18:23,659 --> 00:18:25,659
in which we're dealing with this evening

267
00:18:25,659 --> 00:18:27,659
of a teachable spirit,

268
00:18:27,659 --> 00:18:29,659
and understanding how is it that I can

269
00:18:29,659 --> 00:18:31,659
develop a teachable spirit.

270
00:18:31,659 --> 00:18:33,659
As I evaluate my life, are there some things

271
00:18:33,659 --> 00:18:35,659
that would hinder me from being teachable?

272
00:18:35,659 --> 00:18:37,659
Are there times in my life

273
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:39,659
where I'm not teachable?

274
00:18:39,659 --> 00:18:41,659
Are there times in my life

275
00:18:41,659 --> 00:18:44,659
where I have that response of pride

276
00:18:44,659 --> 00:18:46,659
instead of that response of humility?

277
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:48,659
Are there times in which

278
00:18:48,659 --> 00:18:52,659
I do not demonstrate the desire to learn?

279
00:18:52,659 --> 00:18:55,659
I'm not eager to learn.

280
00:18:55,659 --> 00:18:59,659
We find here that as this Ethiopian eunuch

281
00:18:59,659 --> 00:19:01,659
illustrates in my mind

282
00:19:01,659 --> 00:19:04,659
an example of someone that has a teachable spirit,

283
00:19:04,659 --> 00:19:06,659
and I hope as we've looked at the passage this evening

284
00:19:06,659 --> 00:19:09,659
that you too would agree that he demonstrates,

285
00:19:09,659 --> 00:19:11,659
he illustrates for us someone

286
00:19:11,659 --> 00:19:13,659
that has a teachable spirit,

287
00:19:13,659 --> 00:19:16,659
we'd say, I need to have a teachable spirit.

288
00:19:16,659 --> 00:19:19,659
And the result of having the teachable spirit

289
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:22,659
is that learning has taken place.

290
00:19:22,659 --> 00:19:25,659
We've mentioned that part of our series

291
00:19:25,659 --> 00:19:28,659
will conclude at the end of several weeks,

292
00:19:28,659 --> 00:19:30,659
months of studying this subject matter,

293
00:19:30,659 --> 00:19:33,659
will conclude with a lesson

294
00:19:33,659 --> 00:19:35,659
on evaluating our growth,

295
00:19:35,659 --> 00:19:37,659
evaluating our learning.

296
00:19:37,659 --> 00:19:39,659
How can we evaluate?

297
00:19:39,659 --> 00:19:41,659
Have we learned?

298
00:19:41,659 --> 00:19:44,659
The reality is that if we looked at this passage of Scripture,

299
00:19:44,659 --> 00:19:46,659
we could evaluate by his own life

300
00:19:46,659 --> 00:19:49,659
that yes, there was learning that took place.

301
00:19:49,659 --> 00:19:53,659
And he responded properly to truth.

302
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:56,659
And he responded, he accepted that truth,

303
00:19:56,659 --> 00:19:58,659
and he made his profession,

304
00:19:58,659 --> 00:20:00,659
he followed the Lord entirely.

305
00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:08,499
baptism, and we find that he went on his way rejoicing. The Scriptures are mute to anything

306
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:16,219
else about this man. You can read a variety of historical accounts of the influence and

307
00:20:16,219 --> 00:20:21,259
impact that this man had, and the region is a return back, and there's some good information

308
00:20:21,259 --> 00:20:27,219
out there. The Scriptures, however, are silent as to the man. But I'd like to think that

309
00:20:27,219 --> 00:20:33,059
this man's like a missionary, amen? And he went on his way rejoicing. Why do you think

310
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:39,099
he was rejoicing? Because he had learned, right? He went for the purpose of worship.

311
00:20:39,099 --> 00:20:44,499
You can see there's a desire there, no doubt, as he's going to Jerusalem, and you find that

312
00:20:44,499 --> 00:20:51,379
even as they're leaving that he's still reading the Word of God. He had not yet found out

313
00:20:51,379 --> 00:20:59,419
the truth while he was there in Jerusalem, and he's reading, he's desiring to know. And

314
00:20:59,419 --> 00:21:06,099
God graciously and mercifully gives Philip the direction to go and to be with this man,

315
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:13,299
and he learns, and he goes on his way rejoicing. Listen, when we learn, we ought to rejoice,

316
00:21:13,299 --> 00:21:16,879
because we understand that God is teaching us His Word, and we speak about it from the

317
00:21:16,879 --> 00:21:23,999
perspective of spiritual learning and spiritual growth. The reality is that we are to grow

318
00:21:23,999 --> 00:21:30,199
in grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. When we use that phraseology

319
00:21:30,199 --> 00:21:35,399
of grow in grace and knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ, that's, we're learning. We're

320
00:21:35,399 --> 00:21:43,359
growing. We know more about Him, about the Lord, now than we did when we first got saved,

321
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:49,319
and as we walk with Him, as we've had our theme this year, walking in the light, the more that

322
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:56,519
we walk with Him and the closer we draw to Him, the more we learn, and the more we apply that

323
00:21:56,519 --> 00:22:01,039
truth that we're learning, and then we have the opportunity, as we looked at our lesson from last

324
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:06,279
week, we think about two purposes for learning, the application of truth, but then the dissemination

325
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:11,479
of truth, and that's why I say that this man is like a missionary. He went on his way rejoicing.

326
00:22:11,479 --> 00:22:18,359
I think he wanted to tell some other people. Again, as we would look at some historical

327
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:22,399
records that are provided, we see that there are many accounts that would give testimony

328
00:22:22,399 --> 00:22:26,439
to that end. Again, the Scriptures are mute to it, but we find that he went on his way

329
00:22:26,439 --> 00:22:36,259
rejoicing. It's a wonderful thing to be informed. Amen? I mentioned, as we study the Book of

330
00:22:36,259 --> 00:22:42,339
1 John on Sunday mornings, that God wants us to know some things. The word know, in some form,

331
00:22:42,339 --> 00:22:50,299
is used repeatedly in the Book of 1 John, but here's something interesting, and maybe for you

332
00:22:50,299 --> 00:22:56,419
it will happen as well, but sometimes as we kind of focus on something, all of a sudden you start

333
00:22:56,419 --> 00:23:00,979
seeing it in other places. Whatever happened to you, you focus on one thing, and then you kind of

334
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:06,859
see it in other places, right? And so, I've been speaking and preaching in 1 John, and I've been

335
00:23:06,859 --> 00:23:11,739
studying and preparing and talking about, no, no, no, God doesn't want us to be ignorant. He wants

336
00:23:11,739 --> 00:23:16,579
us to be informed. He wants us to know. I've mentioned several other passages of Scripture

337
00:23:16,579 --> 00:23:21,259
in the New Testament where God wants us to be informed. Paul says on more than one occasion,

338
00:23:21,259 --> 00:23:26,619
I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren. He wants us to know. I've been reading through

339
00:23:26,619 --> 00:23:32,339
the books of 1 and 2 Kings the last couple of days. You know how many times the Bible talks

340
00:23:32,339 --> 00:23:38,859
about that you would know, and God gives a truth that He wants the people to know? How many times

341
00:23:38,859 --> 00:23:45,219
it was that you would know that there's a God in Israel? Why? Because how often the children of

342
00:23:45,219 --> 00:23:52,659
Israel were guilty of idolatry. Sure, I've read those books, I don't know how many times, but as

343
00:23:52,659 --> 00:23:58,859
I focused on this study of 1 John, all of a sudden that word, know, K-N-O-W, just keeps popping off

344
00:23:58,859 --> 00:24:06,979
of the pages of Scripture. God's always desired for people to know Him. You go all the way back

345
00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:13,699
to the Scriptures, you look at all sorts of accounts of the Scriptures and all of the interactions of

346
00:24:13,699 --> 00:24:20,459
the Lord with His people and how that He would demonstrate to others that they would know who

347
00:24:20,579 --> 00:24:28,099
He is. I think about Pharaoh tonight. Did God not make Himself known to Pharaoh? Sure He did.

348
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:35,939
Pharaoh begins by saying to Moses, who is that God? I should let you go. Right? That's how he

349
00:24:35,939 --> 00:24:46,739
begins. Through a series of events, God graciously and very distinctly reveals Himself to Pharaoh.

350
00:24:46,979 --> 00:24:57,739
His magicians say this is the finger of God. Right? I think about Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon,

351
00:24:57,739 --> 00:25:08,539
mighty man, great power, world empire. Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, they're not going to bow.

352
00:25:09,539 --> 00:25:17,339
We know the story, we know the account. And what does he say? Who is that God? That shall

353
00:25:17,339 --> 00:25:23,059
deliver you out of my hand. Right? Is that what he says? Goes in the fiery furnace,

354
00:25:23,059 --> 00:25:27,819
heats it up way higher than it's supposed to be. The guys that put Him in there die because of the

355
00:25:27,819 --> 00:25:37,699
heat. And then the Bible uses the word, He's astonied, astonished, we would use. Why? Because

356
00:25:37,699 --> 00:25:47,299
He says, didn't we throw three of them in there? Yes, sir. And they were bound. Yes, sir. But

357
00:25:47,299 --> 00:25:53,779
there are four and they're walking around and the fourth is like unto the Son of God. At the end of

358
00:25:53,779 --> 00:26:00,059
that event, did Nebuchadnezzar have an understanding of who God is? He made a great declaration that

359
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:06,219
no one could speak amiss about their God. And so this evening, as we think about this truth of

360
00:26:06,219 --> 00:26:11,059
having a teachable spirit, God wants us to know Him. He wants us to know this book, and He is the

361
00:26:11,059 --> 00:26:17,259
divine teacher and He's offered to us an invitation, come and learn of me. And He wants us to learn,

362
00:26:17,259 --> 00:26:24,819
He wants us to grow. The people that are being written to in the book of Hebrews, the Bible

363
00:26:24,819 --> 00:26:30,099
tells us at the end of the fifth chapter, for in the time that you ought to be teachers, you have

364
00:26:30,099 --> 00:26:36,099
a need that one teach you. And He goes on to explain to them that what they needed to be

365
00:26:36,099 --> 00:26:44,179
taught were the basics of the Word of God, the first principles. He was not speaking that to

366
00:26:44,179 --> 00:26:49,979
honor them. It was spoken to their shame because they were supposed to be learning at the time

367
00:26:49,979 --> 00:26:54,859
you're now supposed to be teaching, but you have need that one teach you. And so as we think about

368
00:26:54,859 --> 00:26:59,659
our Christian lives, when we think about our walk with Christ, it is God's design and God's plan

369
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:06,339
that we grow, that we learn. But what hinders learning is not having a teachable spirit. So

370
00:27:06,339 --> 00:27:12,019
this evening, when we think about all of the ways that God's going to teach us, and we'll look at

371
00:27:12,019 --> 00:27:18,819
several examples over the next several weeks, the thought of this lesson, I hope, will be impactful.

372
00:27:18,819 --> 00:27:28,459
Because if I do not develop a teachable spirit in my life, learning is not going to take place. If I

373
00:27:28,459 --> 00:27:34,659
constantly say, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, if I have no desire, and we see the humility

374
00:27:34,659 --> 00:27:43,659
and the desire of the Ethiopian eunuch, how can I except some man should guide me? He desired

375
00:27:43,659 --> 00:27:52,219
Philip to come up into his chariot with him. They read the passage, and then Philip preached Jesus

376
00:27:52,219 --> 00:27:57,899
unto him. What a great passage of Scripture. I believe a great illustration of someone who had

377
00:27:57,899 --> 00:28:03,499
a teachable spirit. I know that God would help us, that we, too, would have a teachable spirit.

378
00:28:03,499 --> 00:28:09,579
Let's pray. Father, we love you. We thank you for loving us. Thank you for this biblical example

379
00:28:09,579 --> 00:28:19,539
tonight, the life of this Ethiopian eunuch. It's a familiar passage of Scripture, perhaps looking

380
00:28:19,539 --> 00:28:25,979
at it afresh and from a slightly different perspective or angle. I pray tonight that we

381
00:28:25,979 --> 00:28:31,779
would acknowledge this teachable spirit of this man and that we would desire that we, too, would

382
00:28:31,779 --> 00:28:37,299
have a teachable spirit. God, you'd help us to develop a teachable spirit in our lives. Help us

383
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:43,699
to learn of you. Help us to grow in grace and knowledge for Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Help

384
00:28:43,699 --> 00:28:49,619
it to not be said of us that in the time that you ought to be teachers, you have need that one teach

385
00:28:49,619 --> 00:28:55,859
you. Help us, God, to grow and to learn. Bless our time of prayer. We do thank you for the privilege

386
00:28:56,219 --> 00:29:02,339
of prayer. Thank you that you hear and answer. You're able to do exceeding abundantly above all

387
00:29:02,339 --> 00:29:08,419
that we ask or think. Bless now and we'll thank you for it. In Christ's name we pray. Amen.
