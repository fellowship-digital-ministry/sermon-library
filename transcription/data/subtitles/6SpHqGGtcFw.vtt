00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.159
We'll be looking at the entire chapter this evening, Genesis chapter number 23.

00:00:10.159 --> 00:00:14.399
I'll read the first couple of verses and we'll get right into the message this evening.

00:00:14.399 --> 00:00:22.319
And Genesis 23 beginning in verse number 1, the Bible says this, and Sarah was 107 and

00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:24.639
20 years old.

00:00:24.639 --> 00:00:27.959
These were the years of the life of Sarah.

00:00:27.959 --> 00:00:35.119
Sarah died in Kirjath Arba, the same as Hebron in the land of Canaan, and Abraham came to

00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:38.119
mourn for Sarah and to weep for her.

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:45.000
I've titled the message there from that phrase in verse number 2, Abraham came to mourn for

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Sarah.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.400
As we come to this passage of Scripture, we've mentioned in recent weeks as we've studied

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:57.240
through the book of Genesis, of course, the mountain peak of Genesis chapter number 21

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:03.159
with the birth of Isaac and all that God had promised and the fulfillment of said promise

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:08.000
and what joy and what excitement in the life of Sarah and Abraham.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.639
And of course, we've gone through a number of these events.

00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:16.760
And we mentioned last week as we studied chapter number 22, that it says, and it came to pass

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:22.720
after these things, and the timeline is not exactly known, but we, understanding some

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:28.800
of the terminology that is used, we believe that Isaac there is at least a teenager, maybe

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.080
as old as 20 years old.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.480
And when you look at the passage and look at all that has taken place, we find that

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:42.440
God gives us, in chapter number 23, a marker, so to speak, a timing of us being able to

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.120
understand some things that have transpired.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:51.440
We come to this chapter and we find that Abraham is here mourning for his beloved wife, Sarah.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:58.360
But God tells us in verse number one that Sarah died at the age of 127 years old.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.480
Now, 127 years old is the age of Sarah, according to verse number one.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:09.600
And by understanding other portions of Scripture, we understand that at this particular time

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.320
that that would make Abraham 137 years old because he was 10 years her senior.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:21.080
And we also understand that at this time, Isaac would be 37 years old because he was,

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.160
she was 90 when he was born, according to Genesis 21.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:33.679
And so Isaac here, at this particular time, at the count in Genesis 23, Isaac is 37 years old.

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:39.600
Now, this revelation not only helps us to understand the age of Sarah and Abraham and

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.320
Isaac, but we also have the opportunity, as we look back to Genesis chapter number 11,

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:52.399
to understand that it's now been 62 years since Abraham and Sarah, at that time Abram

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:59.759
and Sarai, left the Ur of the Chaldees in response to the call and leadership of God.

00:02:59.759 --> 00:03:05.919
Sixty-two years that they've been on this journey, that we've studied the life of Abraham

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:10.360
in these passages of Scripture, these pages of the book of Genesis.

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:15.960
And remember, as we mentioned in Genesis chapter number 11, how God just zeroes the focus in

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.119
upon Abraham and upon the start of the Hebrew race.

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:25.360
And we find here that as we come to this chapter, it's one of those chapters that provides us

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.839
with a marker of time to be able to understand those things that have transpired.

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:36.240
In addition to that, however, we find that as we come to Genesis 23, that there's a chapter

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:43.600
in God's Word, a message tonight that I'll preach, that is given to the death and burial

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.320
of Sarah.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:50.320
And we think about this passage of Scripture and think about the subject matter in which

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:56.240
we'll deal with this evening, and we understand that generally speaking, mankind is aware

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.740
of their mortality.

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.800
Generally speaking, mankind is aware of their mortality.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:07.199
We understand that in recent, really, years at this point, in the last couple of years,

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:13.679
it seems as if there has been a greater awareness of the mortality of individuals because of

00:04:13.679 --> 00:04:17.119
some of the things that we've dealt with in the last couple of years.

00:04:17.119 --> 00:04:24.459
But the reality is that we as the people of God, if anyone is to understand the mortality

00:04:24.459 --> 00:04:28.700
of man, we are confronted with it on a regular basis.

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.839
When we go to the Word of God, we understand the wages of sin is death.

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:38.839
We understand, as it is appointed unto man once to die, after this the judgment.

00:04:38.839 --> 00:04:45.500
We understand that, as Paul said, that death really, to be absent from this body, means

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.260
to be present with the Lord.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:54.359
And so our perspective and our understanding on death is different than that of an unbeliever.

00:04:54.359 --> 00:04:57.059
And for that, I greatly rejoice, amen?

00:04:57.119 --> 00:05:02.720
And what a blessing to understand the truth of the Word of God with regard to mortality.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.739
When we think about the entirety of this passage of Scripture, and we think about the content

00:05:07.739 --> 00:05:13.399
and dealing with the death of Sarah and the burial of Sarah, I'm mindful of what we find

00:05:13.399 --> 00:05:15.019
in Ecclesiastes 7.

00:05:15.019 --> 00:05:18.880
Keep your hand here in Genesis, and I want you to turn to the book of Ecclesiastes in

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.940
chapter number 7, and I want you to see what we're told here in this passage of Scripture

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.119
with regard to the subject that's at hand this evening.

00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:35.799
In Ecclesiastes chapter number 7, we find that God gives us this interesting truth that

00:05:35.799 --> 00:05:40.519
is pertinent to our discussion this evening from this passage of Scripture.

00:05:40.519 --> 00:05:45.839
For the Bible says in Ecclesiastes 7 and verse number 2, it is better to go to the house

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:50.679
of mourning than to go to the house of feasting.

00:05:50.679 --> 00:05:56.380
Now at face value, I would submit to you this evening that many people would oppose

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.160
what that Scripture just says.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:04.559
They would much prefer to go to the house of feasting than to go to the house of mourning.

00:06:04.559 --> 00:06:06.359
Would you agree?

00:06:06.359 --> 00:06:13.920
But we find that as the Scripture is written, the Bible says, for that is the end of all

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:19.299
men, and the living will lay it to his heart.

00:06:19.299 --> 00:06:24.899
There's something sobering about going to a memorial service, a funeral service.

00:06:24.899 --> 00:06:30.619
There's something sobering about dealing with death, right?

00:06:30.619 --> 00:06:37.980
It's a time in which not only do we reflect upon the life of the individual that has passed

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:43.920
from this earth and we memorialize and we speak of and people eulogize and so on and

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:49.839
so forth, but the reality is for the individual that's sitting in the room, wherever that

00:06:49.839 --> 00:06:57.760
room may be, it is something that is profoundly sobering to think about and face the subject

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.760
of death.

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:07.239
And here, we find that Solomon says it is better to go to the house of mourning than

00:07:07.239 --> 00:07:08.880
to go to the house of feasting.

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:09.880
Why?

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:17.320
For that is the end of all men, and the living will lay it to his heart.

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:24.040
There are unique opportunities that you have at moments in which people lose loved ones.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:31.040
When people deal with the mourning process and the weeping process, when people are confronted

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:36.000
face to face with death, there are unique opportunities.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.920
Would you not agree?

00:07:37.959 --> 00:07:44.079
In fact, in some of our lives, there have been times in which we have been in that setting.

00:07:44.079 --> 00:07:46.000
We've been in a funeral.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.799
We've been in a memorial service, and we've heard and we've understood and we've observed

00:07:50.799 --> 00:07:59.040
and we've reflected on our own lives and said, that's going to be me one day, right?

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:01.799
So how does it impact me?

00:08:01.799 --> 00:08:10.320
Sometimes, as I have the opportunity to preach a funeral service or memorial service regularly,

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:18.160
I want to give time and deal with the deceased, but really my audience is the living.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.640
There's nothing that can be done for the deceased, right?

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:26.359
Biblically speaking, we understand there is absolutely nothing that can be done for the

00:08:26.359 --> 00:08:27.359
deceased.

00:08:27.359 --> 00:08:28.760
I don't say that to be insensitive.

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.679
I'm just being transparent.

00:08:30.679 --> 00:08:36.760
And so I seek, as I would conduct a funeral, as I would have the opportunity to preach

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:43.159
a memorial service, I seek to speak about the life of that individual that we're gathered

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:44.400
together for.

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:49.760
But my true audience is the living, the people that are sitting in the pew, the people that

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.159
are sitting in the funeral home.

00:08:52.159 --> 00:08:53.159
That is the audience.

00:08:53.159 --> 00:08:58.559
Those are the individuals that I'm seeking to give the truth of God's Word to.

00:08:58.559 --> 00:08:59.559
Why?

00:08:59.559 --> 00:09:01.280
Because it's the end of all man.

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:02.799
Man goes to his long home.

00:09:02.799 --> 00:09:04.200
Notice what the book of Hebrews says.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.599
Turner, if you will, we'll get back to Genesis in just a moment, I promise.

00:09:07.599 --> 00:09:11.640
But notice in Hebrews chapter number two.

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:18.479
As a child of God, understanding that we are regularly confronted with the truth of our

00:09:18.479 --> 00:09:25.520
own mortality, the reality is we need not be fearful.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:28.559
We need not be dismayed.

00:09:28.559 --> 00:09:29.559
Why?

00:09:29.559 --> 00:09:36.559
For our Savior has conquered sin, death, and the grave.

00:09:36.559 --> 00:09:37.719
Amen?

00:09:37.719 --> 00:09:43.359
And when we come to Hebrews chapter number two, we find that verses 14 and 15, the Bible

00:09:43.359 --> 00:09:50.280
says this, for as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:58.119
himself likewise took part of the same, that through death he might destroy him that had

00:09:58.119 --> 00:10:00.200
the power of death.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.440
That is the devil.

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:05.120
But look at the impact in v. 15

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:10.100
and deliver them who through fear of death

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:15.600
were all their lifetime subject to bondage.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:19.520
You know, there are many people today that fear death.

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:22.580
Many people that fear death.

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:26.020
They would do anything within their power

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:27.880
to prevent death.

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:33.380
We understand that we have this survival mechanism within us.

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:36.560
But as a child of God, we need not fear death.

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:37.600
Amen?

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:41.200
We approach death from a different perspective.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.920
And as we look at Genesis 23,

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:46.160
go back if you will to our text of Scripture,

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.080
I want to just look at this passage

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.920
and I hope that it will be an encouragement to us.

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:52.920
I hope that it will be a blessing to us

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.960
as we consider the death of Sarah

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.720
here in this passage of Scripture.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:00.160
Notice with me if you're taking notes this evening

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.320
how Abraham responds.

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.960
The Bible tells us, I've read v. 1 and 2 already,

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:08.080
but of note is the latter part of v. 2

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:08.960
when the Bible says,

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:11.960
and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:13.800
and to weep for her.

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:16.040
We find that here the Bible shows us

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.480
and reveals to us the humanity of a man

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:22.120
that we hold in high regard and high esteem.

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:24.640
We see a man, a patriarch, Abraham,

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.720
and we see him as being on the pages of Scripture

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:28.720
and the great faith,

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.720
and certainly he's a man of faith.

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:35.120
We find him in the book of Hebrews in the 11th chapter

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:36.840
repeatedly being referenced.

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:39.480
And he's a man of faith, but he's a man.

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:45.680
And the Bible tells us that Abraham came to mourn for Sarah

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:47.440
and to weep for her.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:50.320
The word mourn means to lament or wail.

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.880
I mean, it seems quite apparent,

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:54.320
but the idea of weeping literally means

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:55.800
to shed tears.

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.920
And I think about the response of Abraham,

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:04.320
and I consider as I look at Genesis chapter number 23,

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.120
and I consider the whole of Scripture,

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.080
and even as I get into some things here

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:11.160
in just a few moments as we unfold this chapter,

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:14.480
I am thankful that we have the truth of God's word.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:18.360
And God tells us in 1 Thessalonians 4 in verse number 13,

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:21.440
Paul says, I would not have you be ignorant, brethren,

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:23.240
concerning them which are asleep,

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:28.200
that you sorrow not as others which have no hope.

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:29.600
He says in verse number 18,

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:33.320
wherefore comfort one another with these words.

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:36.280
It does not mean as believers that we sorrow not.

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:38.160
It does not mean that as believers

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:40.920
at the death of a loved one that we do not mourn,

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:43.480
that we do not weep, that we do not shed tears.

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:44.680
It does not mean that.

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:48.400
It simply means that we sorrow not as others

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:52.040
which have no hope.

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:55.760
How many times I have been at a funeral,

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:59.400
whether I've attended the funeral as just an attendee,

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:02.320
or perhaps it's a funeral that I've overseen,

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.960
and I've officiated that particular funeral.

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:07.720
How many times I've been in that setting,

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:09.920
and I've witnessed and I've observed

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:12.560
the individuals that are gathered together

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:15.040
that have no hope.

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:17.040
And it's sad.

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:19.560
It's heartbreaking.

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:24.520
And what is it that I could say to someone in that moment

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:26.200
that could help them?

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:27.600
Not a whole lot.

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:31.040
Right?

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:36.040
Because the reality is that we understand

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:40.440
that there's but one of two destinations for mankind.

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:42.920
I cannot lie to individuals

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:45.280
and give them some sense of hope

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:48.600
and thought that their loved one is in heaven

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:50.600
if they've never professed Jesus Christ

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:52.080
as their personal savior.

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:53.720
I can't do that.

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:57.760
And I never have by the grace of God.

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:00.600
Nor have I ever told them something unkind

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.880
without any kind of sympathy

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:04.920
because you never know what could happen

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:07.360
in the moments before someone's death.

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:09.360
Just don't know.

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:12.720
But you know, it's a completely different experience

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:15.920
when you get to officiate a memorial service,

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:16.760
a funeral service.

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:19.200
When you get to attend a funeral service

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:22.080
for someone that knew Christ as their savior.

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:24.080
It's a celebration.

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:26.840
I mean, it's a time of rejoicing.

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:27.680
Why?

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:30.200
Because we know that they're in heaven.

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:31.880
That this mortal, we understand,

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:35.279
shall put on immortality dealing with the resurrection.

00:14:35.279 --> 00:14:38.240
But we know that Paul says that to be absent from the body

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:39.840
is to be present with the Lord.

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:41.960
He says, I'm in a straight betwixt two

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:45.200
having a desire to depart, to be with Christ,

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:46.640
which is far better.

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:48.840
And I've been at some funeral services.

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:51.200
I've had the privilege of officiating

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:54.200
some funeral services where it's a celebration.

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:58.920
There is absolute certainty that the individual

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:01.240
that we're celebrating the life of that person

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:03.400
is with their savior.

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:04.320
That's exciting.

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:11.920
And here we find that Hebrews speaks of Sarah.

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:14.720
And as soon as it finishes speaking of Sarah

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:17.760
in Hebrews 11, it says in verse number 13,

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:20.120
and these all died in faith.

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:24.120
You think about Sarah and you think about her

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:30.920
just testimony on the pages of Scripture.

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:35.080
Abraham mourns, he weeps, but I'm mindful this evening

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:38.200
that as I look at a passage of Scripture like this,

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:40.920
that we as God's people, we sorrow not as others

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:42.080
which have no hope.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.600
His response is noted.

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:47.520
I want you to see as we continue through the passage,

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:49.200
really through the remainder of the chapter,

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:52.360
I want you to notice what Abraham requests.

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:54.680
The request is made known in verses three and four.

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:57.840
The Bible says, and Abraham stood up from before his dead

00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:00.160
and spake unto the sons of Hath saying,

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:03.960
I'm a stranger and a sojourner with you.

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:07.400
Give me a possession of a burning place with you

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:11.520
that I may bury my dead out of my sight.

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:14.360
We see that as we note what Abraham requests,

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:16.520
that this request is made known in here,

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:18.920
it's simply a burying place.

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:22.320
Give me a possession of a burying place with you

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:26.360
that I may bury my dead out of my sight.

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:28.760
We find that the negotiation is recorded

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:30.400
beginning in verse number five.

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:33.040
The Bible says that the children of Hath answered

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:36.720
to Abraham saying unto him, hear us, my Lord.

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:41.320
Notice what they say, thou art a mighty prince

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:42.920
among us.

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:44.880
It's just a side note this evening

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:47.400
from the real content of what I wanna deal with,

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:51.480
but I want you to be mindful of the testimony of Abraham.

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:53.279
I mentioned already that he's been here

00:16:53.279 --> 00:16:56.320
in this part of the world for 62 years,

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:59.960
and as he's been there, he's developed a testimony.

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:03.200
There's an obvious understanding of God's blessing

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:05.720
and God's provision in the life of Abraham.

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:09.000
We were mindful as we looked at chapter number 21,

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.200
how that Abimelech comes to him and says,

00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:14.000
God is with thee in all that thou doest,

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.640
and here these that he speaks to the children of Hath,

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:21.120
they say, hear us, my Lord,

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:25.400
thou art a mighty prince among us.

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:27.000
It's an honorable term.

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:31.360
It's an understanding of the testimony of this man, Abraham,

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:34.920
and what a blessing to have a godly testimony.

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:39.120
Notice it says in the choice of our sepulchers,

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:42.160
bury thy dead, none of us shall withhold

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:43.920
from thee his sepulcher,

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:47.520
but that thou mayest bury thy dead.

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:49.480
And Abraham stood up and bowed himself

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:52.120
to the people of the land, even to the children of Hath.

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:55.080
This was a customary cultural thing that would be done.

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:57.400
It says in verse number eight, he communed with them,

00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:00.600
saying, if it be your mind that I should bury my dead

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:03.279
out of my sight, hear me, and entreat for me

00:18:03.279 --> 00:18:05.680
to Ephron, the son of Zohar,

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:08.640
that he may give me the cave of Machpelah,

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:11.760
which he hath, which is in the end of his field,

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.520
for as much money as it is worth,

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:16.040
he shall give it me for a possession

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:19.440
of a burying place amongst you.

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:21.440
And here's where you see these negotiations

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:22.440
that are recorded.

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:26.200
We find that Abraham specifies the place

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:28.000
that he desires to have.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.480
He says here that it's the entreat for me, Ephron,

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:35.440
the son of Zohar, and that he desired to have the cave

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:37.440
in verse number nine of Machpelah.

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:40.840
And we find that here, that Ephron is brought

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:43.280
into the conversation.

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:45.280
It says in verse number 10 that he dwelt among

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:47.320
the children of Hath, and Ephron the Hittite

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:50.640
answered Abraham, and the audience of the children of Hath,

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:54.760
even of all that went in at the gate of his city, sang.

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:57.760
And so this is a big deal that's going on right here.

00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:59.559
There's a lot of people involved,

00:18:59.559 --> 00:19:03.679
and it's a very official type of situation that's going on.

00:19:03.679 --> 00:19:06.760
And here in verse number 11, Ephron says,

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:10.760
Nay, my lord, hear me.

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:16.320
The field give I thee, and the cave that is therein,

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:17.840
I give it thee.

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:22.000
In the presence of the sons of my people, give I it thee.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.080
Bury thy dead.

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:29.119
That's a kind gesture, is it not?

00:19:29.119 --> 00:19:31.640
But Abraham responds in verse number 12,

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:33.840
and it says that Abraham bowed down on himself

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.559
before the people of the land.

00:19:35.559 --> 00:19:37.359
And he's speaking to Ephron and the audience

00:19:37.359 --> 00:19:39.559
of the people of the land, saying,

00:19:39.559 --> 00:19:42.799
but if thou will give it, I pray thee, hear me.

00:19:42.799 --> 00:19:45.200
I will give thee money for the field.

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:50.840
Take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:53.119
And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,

00:19:53.119 --> 00:19:54.480
my lord, hearken unto me.

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:58.040
The land is worth 400 shekels of silver.

00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:01.320
What is that betwixt me and thee?

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:05.320
"'Bury, therefore, thy dead.'"

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:07.000
The negotiations are ended here

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.160
in v. 15 as we find that the price of the land,

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:14.040
the value is declared and given here

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:18.560
in v. 15 that it's worth 400 shekels of silver.

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:20.600
We find that Abraham had insisted

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:22.200
on paying for this land,

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.400
not to just receive it as a gift,

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:27.760
and we find that he now knows the amount

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:30.760
and here the negotiation is completed

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:33.560
and then the transaction takes place.

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:37.560
In v. 16, the Bible says that Abraham hearkened unto Ephron

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:40.540
and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver,

00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:43.040
which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:48.040
400 shekels of silver, current money, with the merchant.

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:51.440
And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah,

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:54.160
which was before Mamre, the field and the cave,

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:56.600
which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field,

00:20:56.600 --> 00:21:01.600
that were in all the borders round about, were made sure.

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:03.760
Unto Abraham for a possession

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:05.960
in the presence of the children of Heth

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:09.720
before all that went in at the gate of his city.

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:13.800
And there we see the transaction is completed.

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:17.480
We see that Abraham gave in the presence of all

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:19.440
as it says there in v. 16,

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:21.400
he named in the audience of the sons of Heth

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:24.200
that he measured out that 400 shekels of silver

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:26.800
and we find that the transaction was completed

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:30.680
and thus Abraham was able to bury Sarah.

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:32.480
It says in v. 19, and after this,

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:34.940
after the request was made known,

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:36.760
after the negotiations took place,

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:41.200
after the price was settled, the transaction was completed,

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:44.360
the Bible says that Abraham buried Sarah his wife

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:47.880
in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre,

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:50.640
the same as Hebron in the land of Canaan.

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:52.720
And the field and the cave that is therein

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:55.840
were made sure unto Abraham for a possession

00:21:55.840 --> 00:22:00.080
of a burying place by the sons of Heth.

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:01.760
Now it's interesting that as we look here

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:05.000
at the transaction being completed and the burial of Sarah,

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.880
that we'd be mindful of understanding

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:09.240
that not only would Sarah be buried in this place,

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:12.380
but we find that Abraham also would be buried in this place.

00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:14.760
If you were to look at chapter 25 in v. 9,

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:17.400
we won't take the time to go to all of these verses,

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:19.560
but you'll find as we'll study in weeks to come

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:21.200
that Abraham is buried here.

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:24.060
You find that Isaac and Rebekah are also buried here,

00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:27.840
according to Genesis 49 in verse number 31.

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:32.840
And then you'll also find that Leah in chapter number 49

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:36.720
is buried there, and then Jacob in chapter number 50.

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:39.940
And all of these are buried here in this cave,

00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:43.120
in this place that Abraham purchased.

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:45.240
And as we look at this passage of Scripture

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:48.340
and as we begin to unfold and we note the response

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:51.540
and we note the request and we see the transaction

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:53.740
that's completed in the burial of Sarah,

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:56.460
I think this evening that as I look at this passage

00:22:56.460 --> 00:23:00.140
of Scripture, I say, what is it that is revealed to me here?

00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:01.460
What is it that I should learn?

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:03.380
What is it that I can take away

00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:04.860
from this passage of Scripture?

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:06.080
And so if you are taking notes,

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:09.380
number three, what Abraham reveals.

00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:12.420
What is it that is revealed through this transaction?

00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:16.540
God in his wisdom determined that he was going to record

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:19.420
these 20 verses in the Bible.

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:23.980
And he's recorded it for a reason, for a purpose.

00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:26.200
And first that I would say,

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:28.620
the first item that I would look to

00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:32.240
that is revealed to me through this passage of Scripture

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:35.740
is number one, the love that Abraham had for Sarah.

00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:39.200
I know his love.

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:41.260
The Bible tells us that Sarah died

00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:43.720
and the Bible tells us that Abraham came

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:46.900
to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her.

00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:48.440
We are told in the New Testament

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:51.600
that as husbands we are to love our wives.

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:53.480
And I believe that Abraham was a man,

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:56.800
though you will not read the words here

00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:58.640
that Abraham loved Sarah,

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:01.480
you won't see that in Genesis chapter number 23,

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:05.160
but I believe that action of love is noted

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:10.160
and demonstrated through his response to the situation.

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:11.080
He wept for her.

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:12.280
He mourned for her.

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:13.720
He loved her.

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:16.680
The reality is that you think about standing

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:18.119
at the grave of a loved one,

00:24:18.119 --> 00:24:22.520
you think about the process of dealing with this

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:24.360
that Abraham is dealing with here

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:26.559
in Genesis chapter number 23,

00:24:26.559 --> 00:24:29.160
the reality is that we still sorrow,

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:31.200
as I mentioned earlier,

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:33.839
we don't sorrow as those which have no hope,

00:24:33.839 --> 00:24:35.040
but we still sorrow, why?

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:40.040
Because life is gonna be different, right?

00:24:40.119 --> 00:24:44.800
That loved one that we've now come to the place

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:46.880
that yes, they're in a better place,

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:49.119
they're with the Lord and how wonderful

00:24:49.119 --> 00:24:50.800
and how glorious that is,

00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:53.040
the reality is that my life has changed

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:58.040
because of their presence no longer being here, right?

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:02.700
We find that that is amplified, if you will,

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:05.960
when you consider the love that you have for the deceased.

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:11.800
It's his wife, he loved her.

00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:16.360
I want you to think also, not only as we note,

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:18.679
as we go through Genesis 23, what is revealed,

00:25:18.679 --> 00:25:20.440
first of all, his love for Sarah,

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:24.040
I believe that his perspective is revealed.

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:25.960
His perspective, I want you to notice

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:27.279
and perhaps you picked up on it

00:25:27.279 --> 00:25:28.920
as I read through the passage,

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:31.200
but notice what he says in verse number four.

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:37.040
I am a stranger and a sojourner with you.

00:25:38.119 --> 00:25:40.559
I'm a stranger and a sojourner.

00:25:40.559 --> 00:25:42.160
I think about this perspective

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:44.580
and I think about the reality

00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:46.640
that we find in Hebrews chapter number 11.

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:49.600
Again, hold your place here, but look at Hebrews 11,

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:52.559
really even as it deals with the life of Sarah and Abraham

00:25:52.559 --> 00:25:56.420
within this section of the text of Hebrews 11,

00:25:56.420 --> 00:26:00.160
we find that there's interesting truth that is revealed.

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:03.119
And here, Abraham, as he begins to speak

00:26:03.119 --> 00:26:05.480
to the sons of Heth, he says,

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:08.360
I am a stranger and a sojourner.

00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:10.619
It reveals perspective.

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:14.360
This world is not my home.

00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:17.960
I'm just a passing through, the songwriter said, amen.

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:22.420
And we sing about, we understand the reality of heaven

00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:25.760
and what a blessing that is when we see Christ,

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:27.860
when we see him face to face.

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:31.980
In Hebrews 11 and verse 13,

00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:34.820
the Bible says these all died in faith,

00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:36.580
not having received the promises,

00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:39.899
but having seen them afar off and were persuaded of them

00:26:39.899 --> 00:26:43.339
and embrace them and confess that they were what?

00:26:43.339 --> 00:26:48.140
Strangers and pilgrims on the earth.

00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:49.100
What did he say?

00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:51.460
He said, I'm a stranger.

00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:53.580
I'm a sojourner among you.

00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:59.339
Verse 14, for they that say such things declare plainly

00:26:59.339 --> 00:27:02.540
that they seek a country.

00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:04.779
And truly, if they had been mindful of that country

00:27:04.779 --> 00:27:06.220
from whence they came out,

00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:08.140
they might have had opportunity to have returned.

00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:09.940
But now, notice what it says,

00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:11.059
they desire what?

00:27:11.059 --> 00:27:12.580
A better country.

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:15.440
That is in heavenly.

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:18.220
Wherefore, God is not ashamed to be called their God

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:22.460
for he hath prepared for them a city.

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:24.460
Isn't that wonderful?

00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:26.460
Listen, there's a day that's coming

00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:29.980
that we're gonna say goodbye to this old earth.

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:32.179
Amen?

00:27:32.179 --> 00:27:33.540
This world is not my home.

00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:37.779
Man goes to his long home, Ecclesiastes says.

00:27:37.779 --> 00:27:42.580
And the reality is that as we look at the response

00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:45.899
of Abraham, when we look at the request of Abraham,

00:27:45.899 --> 00:27:49.059
that there's some things that are being revealed to us

00:27:49.059 --> 00:27:51.580
about this man, Abraham.

00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:53.820
And number one, we see his love for Sarah,

00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:57.339
but number two, we see his perspective in life.

00:27:57.339 --> 00:28:00.020
Paul encourages the believers in Corinth.

00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:02.660
We understand that we've been encouraged

00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:05.100
in the book of Colossians in the third chapter

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:07.140
that we're to set our affection on things above,

00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:08.980
not on things of the earth.

00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:11.339
We find that Paul encourages those believers

00:28:11.339 --> 00:28:14.140
in 2 Corinthians 4 that we're to have

00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:19.059
an eternal perspective, not a temporal perspective.

00:28:20.059 --> 00:28:22.980
And so often, we get so wrapped up

00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:24.580
with the affairs of this world

00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:29.220
that it's really easy to become temporally focused.

00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:30.059
Right?

00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:34.340
Then we remember, this world is not my home.

00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:37.619
I'm just passing through.

00:28:37.619 --> 00:28:41.500
I mean, even if we're here for 80, 90, 100 years,

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:45.460
127 for Sarah, I hope I don't live to be 127.

00:28:46.419 --> 00:28:47.260
Good night.

00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:50.059
The 80s, they'll be thinking about 2080, amen?

00:28:50.059 --> 00:28:54.979
And the reality is that no matter what our time here

00:28:54.979 --> 00:28:59.340
on earth, it's just about that long compared to eternity.

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:01.539
Right?

00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:06.619
And here, we find that the perspective

00:29:06.619 --> 00:29:10.739
of Abraham is really revealed to us.

00:29:10.739 --> 00:29:14.380
I'm just a stranger, a sojourner with you.

00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:17.340
He'd been there for 62 years.

00:29:18.859 --> 00:29:20.500
God had promised him the land,

00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:23.859
but he was seeking a better country.

00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:29.660
Isn't that wonderful to think about that perspective

00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:31.979
in a time such as this?

00:29:31.979 --> 00:29:33.539
His perspective is right.

00:29:33.539 --> 00:29:36.859
I know not only that Abraham, through this text

00:29:36.859 --> 00:29:40.179
of Scripture, that his love for Sarah is revealed to us,

00:29:40.179 --> 00:29:43.059
that his perspective on life is revealed to us,

00:29:43.059 --> 00:29:48.020
but I find also that his character is revealed to us.

00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:50.460
I want you to think about this just for a moment,

00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:54.940
that as Abraham is dealing with the sons of Heth here

00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:56.419
in this portion of Scripture,

00:29:56.419 --> 00:29:59.140
and as all of these things are revealed to us,

00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:01.539
and as we go through the coming...

00:30:01.539 --> 00:30:04.879
and the conversation and the negotiation

00:30:04.879 --> 00:30:08.079
and all that I read during those verses of Scripture,

00:30:08.079 --> 00:30:09.759
really from verse number three

00:30:09.759 --> 00:30:12.359
down through verse number 18,

00:30:12.359 --> 00:30:14.719
and you see all that is taking place

00:30:14.719 --> 00:30:16.919
with the negotiation that is recorded,

00:30:16.919 --> 00:30:19.839
I believe that as you look at the interaction

00:30:19.839 --> 00:30:23.439
that Abraham has with the sons of Heth,

00:30:23.439 --> 00:30:27.079
that you will conclude that Abraham acted

00:30:27.079 --> 00:30:30.359
both appropriately and honorably.

00:30:31.359 --> 00:30:33.459
And I think that's important for us to understand

00:30:33.459 --> 00:30:37.799
because at a moment in time such as this,

00:30:37.799 --> 00:30:40.599
his character is being revealed.

00:30:40.599 --> 00:30:42.679
A crisis doesn't make the man,

00:30:42.679 --> 00:30:46.759
it simply reveals what is in the man, right?

00:30:46.759 --> 00:30:48.999
And we find here that as we look

00:30:48.999 --> 00:30:50.759
at this passage of Scripture

00:30:50.759 --> 00:30:52.399
and we think about the dealing,

00:30:52.399 --> 00:30:55.639
the interaction of Abraham with the sons of Heth

00:30:55.639 --> 00:30:57.639
and we understand what is taking place

00:30:57.719 --> 00:31:00.679
and you can only imagine the emotional things

00:31:00.679 --> 00:31:01.519
that he's dealing with.

00:31:01.519 --> 00:31:05.439
Listen, even as we would look at Abraham

00:31:05.439 --> 00:31:07.479
and understand that he sorrows not as others

00:31:07.479 --> 00:31:08.299
which have no hope,

00:31:08.299 --> 00:31:09.919
as we'd use that New Testament truth,

00:31:09.919 --> 00:31:13.919
as we understand that his perspective,

00:31:13.919 --> 00:31:17.359
he still lost his wife, physically speaking.

00:31:18.879 --> 00:31:20.359
It's an emotional time.

00:31:22.559 --> 00:31:26.799
There are times that we face crisis such as this

00:31:26.799 --> 00:31:29.859
that we don't always act appropriately and honorably.

00:31:32.799 --> 00:31:35.719
We find that Abraham, however,

00:31:35.719 --> 00:31:39.999
his interaction with these inhabitants of the land,

00:31:39.999 --> 00:31:43.839
his interaction with these individuals is appropriate.

00:31:43.839 --> 00:31:45.479
It's honorable.

00:31:45.479 --> 00:31:46.999
He doesn't come in there and say,

00:31:46.999 --> 00:31:50.039
hey, listen, give me a place to bury my dead.

00:31:50.039 --> 00:31:51.679
God promised me this land.

00:31:51.679 --> 00:31:54.199
This is my land anyway.

00:31:54.199 --> 00:31:56.019
He didn't respond that way.

00:31:56.019 --> 00:31:57.479
He didn't handle it that way.

00:31:58.379 --> 00:32:00.139
The emotions that he's dealing with

00:32:00.139 --> 00:32:02.659
certainly could have led him to behave

00:32:02.659 --> 00:32:06.059
in perhaps an inappropriate manner.

00:32:08.479 --> 00:32:11.059
But we find that Abraham comes and says,

00:32:11.919 --> 00:32:13.619
give me a place to bury my dead.

00:32:15.819 --> 00:32:17.339
And here's the place that I'd like

00:32:17.339 --> 00:32:18.699
and Ephron says, you can have it.

00:32:18.699 --> 00:32:21.359
And he says, no, I appreciate the gesture,

00:32:21.359 --> 00:32:23.459
but I'm gonna pay for it.

00:32:24.459 --> 00:32:27.419
I'm gonna pay fair market value for it.

00:32:27.419 --> 00:32:28.259
Why?

00:32:28.259 --> 00:32:29.819
Because it's the right thing.

00:32:29.819 --> 00:32:31.379
It's the appropriate thing.

00:32:31.379 --> 00:32:33.459
It's the honorable thing.

00:32:34.379 --> 00:32:36.179
And we find that as Abraham

00:32:36.179 --> 00:32:39.579
is dealing with this weighty matter,

00:32:39.579 --> 00:32:43.079
he's stood there and he's mourned for

00:32:43.079 --> 00:32:45.779
and he's wept for his wife, Sarah,

00:32:45.779 --> 00:32:47.979
and he's immediately gonna have to deal

00:32:47.979 --> 00:32:50.979
with this interaction and this discussion

00:32:51.059 --> 00:32:53.539
and this negotiation that he handles

00:32:53.539 --> 00:32:56.039
all of it in a godly fashion.

00:32:57.619 --> 00:32:59.259
And that's impactful to me.

00:33:00.579 --> 00:33:02.659
That's helpful for me.

00:33:02.659 --> 00:33:07.139
Because I find in life that we face

00:33:07.139 --> 00:33:09.699
similar types of circumstances, do we not?

00:33:11.559 --> 00:33:15.579
We face times in which we have a difficulty

00:33:15.579 --> 00:33:18.999
and our emotions are all over the place.

00:33:19.919 --> 00:33:22.279
You wanna meet some folks that are emotional,

00:33:22.279 --> 00:33:25.559
talk to some folks that have just lost a loved one.

00:33:25.559 --> 00:33:27.879
They're emotional people.

00:33:27.879 --> 00:33:28.959
I understand it.

00:33:28.959 --> 00:33:30.219
I get it.

00:33:32.039 --> 00:33:34.879
But Abraham, in the midst of all of that,

00:33:37.039 --> 00:33:40.639
he approaches the matter at hand

00:33:40.639 --> 00:33:45.439
in a very godly way, in an honorable way.

00:33:45.439 --> 00:33:48.919
And I believe that as I look at the behavior

00:33:49.799 --> 00:33:53.159
of Abraham in this moment of great difficulty,

00:33:53.159 --> 00:33:55.859
I would say that his behavior is exemplary.

00:33:58.059 --> 00:34:01.039
And as we look at this passage, we say,

00:34:01.039 --> 00:34:02.759
why did God give us all of this

00:34:02.759 --> 00:34:07.279
for the death and burial of Sarah?

00:34:08.499 --> 00:34:11.639
Perhaps it's that God wants to remind us of some things

00:34:11.639 --> 00:34:14.479
and reveal some things to us through the life of Abraham.

00:34:15.999 --> 00:34:17.439
Abraham loved his wife.

00:34:19.039 --> 00:34:21.759
Husbands, love your wives.

00:34:22.679 --> 00:34:26.759
As Christ loved the church and gave himself for it.

00:34:26.759 --> 00:34:28.959
That's what we're told in the New Testament.

00:34:30.439 --> 00:34:35.439
Believer, sorrow not as others which have no hope.

00:34:37.679 --> 00:34:39.439
Doesn't mean that you don't sorrow,

00:34:40.339 --> 00:34:43.299
but we sorrow not as others which have no hope.

00:34:43.299 --> 00:34:45.319
We can rejoice.

00:34:45.319 --> 00:34:48.619
Oftentimes we pray for healing for one another.

00:34:49.299 --> 00:34:51.579
You know where the ultimate healing comes?

00:34:51.579 --> 00:34:52.539
In death.

00:34:54.719 --> 00:34:56.359
That's ultimate healing.

00:34:57.499 --> 00:34:58.899
Amen?

00:34:58.899 --> 00:35:00.619
Because you know what we find in Revelation

00:35:00.619 --> 00:35:04.339
about in heaven, there's no more sickness,

00:35:04.339 --> 00:35:08.959
there's no more death, no more tears, right?

00:35:08.959 --> 00:35:11.239
What a joy, what a blessing.

00:35:12.939 --> 00:35:15.499
Oh, that God would help us through a passage like this

00:35:15.499 --> 00:35:18.059
to adjust our perspective

00:35:18.059 --> 00:35:21.959
to be more of a heavenly, eternal perspective,

00:35:21.959 --> 00:35:23.539
not a temporal perspective.

00:35:24.859 --> 00:35:29.739
Sons of Heth, I'm a stranger and a sojourner among you.

00:35:29.739 --> 00:35:33.339
How often do we have that perspective in life?

00:35:33.339 --> 00:35:35.139
This world is not my home.

00:35:35.139 --> 00:35:36.079
I'm just passing through.

00:35:36.079 --> 00:35:37.579
I'm here for a little while

00:35:37.579 --> 00:35:40.219
and I don't even know how long that little while is.

00:35:41.719 --> 00:35:45.379
But until God's ready for me, I'm here.

00:35:46.219 --> 00:35:48.299
But my citizenship is in heaven.

00:35:48.299 --> 00:35:51.379
We sing with the kids, I'm going to heaven,

00:35:51.379 --> 00:35:54.899
can't wait, gonna see Jesus, can't wait.

00:35:54.899 --> 00:35:56.099
In fact, Holly and Brianna

00:35:56.099 --> 00:35:58.179
were singing that at home yesterday.

00:35:58.179 --> 00:35:59.899
It's a great little song.

00:35:59.899 --> 00:36:01.059
I wish I knew all the words.

00:36:01.059 --> 00:36:02.619
You probably are happy I don't.

00:36:06.639 --> 00:36:07.859
Heaven is our home.

00:36:08.899 --> 00:36:11.939
What a perspective, what an understanding.

00:36:11.939 --> 00:36:14.099
If you've trust that Christ is your savior.

00:36:15.059 --> 00:36:19.959
I don't have to fear death, for my savior's conquered death.

00:36:19.959 --> 00:36:21.499
Oh, death, where is thy sting?

00:36:22.459 --> 00:36:24.079
Amen?

00:36:24.079 --> 00:36:26.859
We find not only revealed to us

00:36:26.859 --> 00:36:30.539
his love and his perspective, but his character.

00:36:30.539 --> 00:36:33.819
Oh, that God would help us in times of great difficulty,

00:36:34.899 --> 00:36:39.639
in times of emotional distress, in times of loss.

00:36:40.639 --> 00:36:45.639
That God, through us, enables us to live godly,

00:36:47.559 --> 00:36:49.739
honorably, and appropriately.

00:36:50.879 --> 00:36:53.779
Because that's what I see in Abraham here.

00:36:53.779 --> 00:36:56.559
I see that he dealt with these sons of Heth

00:36:56.559 --> 00:36:59.159
in a very appropriate manner.

00:36:59.159 --> 00:37:02.439
And that's encouraging to me, it's impactful to me.

00:37:02.439 --> 00:37:04.079
And I hope that it is to you as well.

00:37:04.079 --> 00:37:07.559
Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, let's pray.

00:37:07.559 --> 00:37:10.439
Father, we love you.

00:37:10.439 --> 00:37:12.259
We thank you for loving us.

00:37:13.319 --> 00:37:14.679
We thank you for the word of God,

00:37:14.679 --> 00:37:18.879
and we thank you for the truth of heaven.

00:37:18.879 --> 00:37:21.159
We thank you that you've given us

00:37:21.159 --> 00:37:24.019
in this precious book that we hold so dear,

00:37:25.899 --> 00:37:29.199
the truth regarding life and death.

00:37:31.919 --> 00:37:34.199
For many that are here this evening,

00:37:38.079 --> 00:37:41.159
we'd have the testimony that we've trusted Jesus Christ

00:37:41.159 --> 00:37:43.879
as our personal Savior and that heaven is our home.

00:37:47.919 --> 00:37:49.839
Perhaps, however, there's one here,

00:37:49.839 --> 00:37:51.759
there's one that's tuned in via livestream

00:37:51.759 --> 00:37:53.099
that's not sure of heaven.

00:37:55.599 --> 00:37:58.839
As we've, just for a few moments, observed

00:38:02.039 --> 00:38:05.919
the death and burial, the funeral, if you will, of Sarah.

00:38:07.679 --> 00:38:11.559
Solomon says it is better to go to the house of mourning

00:38:11.559 --> 00:38:13.039
than to the house of feasting,

00:38:13.039 --> 00:38:14.719
for this is the end of all men.

00:38:18.839 --> 00:38:20.399
God, through thy Holy Spirit,

00:38:20.399 --> 00:38:22.999
I pray that you would convict

00:38:22.999 --> 00:38:25.419
that individual of their need for Christ.

00:38:27.119 --> 00:38:32.119
They would understand that Jesus is the Savior.

00:38:35.079 --> 00:38:36.519
For those that have been saved,

00:38:36.519 --> 00:38:38.000
would you help us, Lord,

00:38:40.479 --> 00:38:43.159
to have that proper perspective in life?

00:38:45.739 --> 00:38:49.380
Just a stranger, just a pilgrim, just a sojourner,

00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:51.279
just passing through, be here for a little while,

00:38:51.279 --> 00:38:54.279
but my eyes are on heaven.

00:38:58.399 --> 00:39:02.599
Looking forward to seeing my Savior face to face,

00:39:02.599 --> 00:39:04.320
to be with Him forevermore.

00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:09.519
Help us, Lord, to have that perspective,

00:39:09.519 --> 00:39:14.239
and help us, God, as we deal with trials and adversities

00:39:14.239 --> 00:39:19.119
and emotional events such as this,

00:39:20.199 --> 00:39:22.519
that we would deal with these things appropriately

00:39:22.519 --> 00:39:25.159
and honorably, godly.

00:39:28.079 --> 00:39:32.919
I pray that you'd move and work, help us to respond,

00:39:32.919 --> 00:39:35.279
help us, God, to apply,

00:39:35.279 --> 00:39:37.599
to be doers of the Word and not hearers only.

00:39:38.559 --> 00:39:40.359
We'll give you the glory for all that you'll do,

00:39:40.359 --> 00:39:41.959
for it's in Christ's name we pray.
