00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760
Genesis chapter number 26 this evening, Genesis chapter number 26.

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:10.079
And with the help of God, we'll go through all 35 verses here of Genesis chapter number

00:00:10.079 --> 00:00:11.520
26.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.199
Begin reading in verse number 1.

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:18.639
The Bible says this, Genesis 26 and verse number 1, there was a famine in the land beside

00:00:18.639 --> 00:00:22.239
the first famine that was in the days of Abraham.

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:26.239
And Isaac went unto Abimelech, king of the Philistines, unto Gerar.

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:32.000
I want you to notice in verse number 6, the Bible says, and Isaac dwelt in Gerar.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.659
We're using that really as our title this evening.

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:37.560
You see on the bulletin, Isaac dwelt in Gerar.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.400
As we concluded Genesis chapter number 25, it was a couple of weeks ago, but as we concluded

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:48.159
that passage of Scripture, we were reminded about the dysfunction in the family, if you

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:54.639
will, and the discussion between Jacob and Esau, and of course, the selling of the birthright.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.599
And Esau despised his birthright.

00:00:56.599 --> 00:00:58.720
He sold his birthright unto Jacob.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:04.040
And we read about that, studied that portion of Scripture, and we do not know with certainty

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.839
the exact age of Jacob and Esau at that particular time and all that's going on.

00:01:09.839 --> 00:01:16.720
However, when we reach the end of Genesis chapter number 26, we read that Esau married,

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.639
he's got two wives at the end of the chapter, and the Bible tells us that he's 40 years

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:21.639
old.

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:25.879
So we have some timeline that's given to us with regard to these events.

00:01:25.879 --> 00:01:30.440
Remember, it was in Genesis chapter number 25, when you started reading the chapter,

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.720
you read about the death of Abraham, but we understood that as we looked at the timeline

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:41.559
that even though the birth of Jacob and Esau is mentioned after the death of Abraham, that

00:01:41.559 --> 00:01:45.919
Jacob and Esau would have been 15 years old at the time of Abraham's death.

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:51.319
And so again, we're not exactly sure as to the age of Jacob and Esau when this all begins

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:56.919
and at the end of chapter 25, but we do know at the end of chapter number 26 that Esau

00:01:56.919 --> 00:01:57.919
is 40.

00:01:57.919 --> 00:02:02.519
Now, let me put it in perspective because Jacob, he was 60 years old when the children

00:02:02.519 --> 00:02:03.519
were born.

00:02:03.519 --> 00:02:10.240
And so therefore, excuse me, Isaac would have been 60 when the children were born, and therefore

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.520
that makes Isaac 100 years old at the end of Genesis chapter number 26.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.520
And that just kind of gives us some perspective so that we can keep a timeline as to what's

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.580
going on.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.779
As we look at this passage of Scripture, there are several things that unfold, really a lot

00:02:23.779 --> 00:02:28.860
of events, fast-moving things that are taking place in Genesis chapter number 26.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.699
And so let's dig right into the passage of Scripture this evening.

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:37.139
And if you are taking notes, we have several points this evening.

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:38.899
And this morning I only had two.

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:42.839
If I said I had four tonight, then that would equal out to three, but I actually have six

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:47.979
tonight, and so we're a little bit above average for normal, but we'll kind of move right through

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.539
this evening, six points this evening.

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:56.220
And so you might need two pages in your sermon notebook or you need to write small, amen?

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.179
And number one, if you're taking notes, I want you to note the problem.

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:01.619
The problem is given to us in verse number one straight away.

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:08.100
As soon as you open the text of Scripture in Genesis chapter number 26, it begins by

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.660
giving us the situation.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.820
The problem is right there.

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.220
There was a famine in the land.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:19.940
Now, the Bible references that this is beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham.

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.979
Now, you remember that there was a famine that Abraham dealt with as well.

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:29.059
In fact, as soon as he got to Canaanland, the Bible tells us that there was a famine

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:30.740
and he went down to Egypt.

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.300
And we understand all that took place.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.100
We studied that many months ago.

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.100
But now as we look at this scenario and this situation, really think about the problem

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:44.860
that is being dealt with, we find that this problem is something that you read repeatedly

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.820
through the Scriptures.

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:52.139
There are many times in which the Word of God tells us that the people of God dealt

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:53.139
with a famine.

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:58.100
They dealt with a problem of this same magnitude, this famine.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:05.139
Now, the response to the difficulty, the response to the problem is varied as you look at these

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:09.860
biblical accounts of those that dealt with the same problem, being a famine.

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.899
And oftentimes you see that the response to that difficulty is varied.

00:04:13.899 --> 00:04:17.459
I want to remind you, without going to the passages of Scripture and dealing with them

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:26.339
in any depth whatsoever, simply stating them, Abraham dealt with a famine, as we mentioned

00:04:26.339 --> 00:04:27.339
a moment ago.

00:04:27.339 --> 00:04:31.700
Isaac, as we're looking in this passage of Scripture, he's going to deal with a famine.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.100
Jacob, he's going to deal with a famine, right?

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.899
There's a huge famine in Egypt, right?

00:04:35.899 --> 00:04:40.859
Joseph and the whole situation and all that takes place, and the famine was not just in

00:04:40.859 --> 00:04:44.100
Egypt that affected all lands, the Bible tells us.

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.059
Remember, there's no food in Canaan, and that's why the sons are sent to Egypt to get bread,

00:04:49.059 --> 00:04:50.059
to get corn.

00:04:50.059 --> 00:04:52.859
Elimelech faced a famine.

00:04:52.859 --> 00:04:57.000
The time of the judges, you read the book of Ruth, the book of Ruth opens by talking

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.440
to us about this famine.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.220
And then of course, if you want to think about David, he dealt with a famine.

00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:07.140
He dealt with a situation with the Gibeonites, and there were three years there was a famine.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:12.079
We could go on and on and mention many famines that the Word of God speaks of, but the reality

00:05:12.079 --> 00:05:13.380
is that there's a problem.

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:18.660
When we look at the Scriptures and we begin to identify with the people of God that have

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:25.380
gone on before us, we find that they dealt with problems the same way we deal with problems.

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:30.179
We have problems, we have difficulties, we have adversities, we have troubles in life,

00:05:30.179 --> 00:05:35.799
and we find here in the life of Isaac that the Bible begins as we unfold this passage

00:05:35.799 --> 00:05:39.579
of Scripture by telling us of this problem.

00:05:39.579 --> 00:05:43.619
Moving on quickly, I want you to notice in verses two through six that there's a promise

00:05:43.619 --> 00:05:45.019
that is given.

00:05:45.019 --> 00:05:51.380
And really, the promise has many aspects of it, but I'm so thankful for the promises of

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:52.899
God, aren't you?

00:05:52.899 --> 00:05:56.179
You go to the Word of God, and you find that there are many promises.

00:05:56.179 --> 00:06:02.459
Peter says of the promises of God that they're exceeding great and precious promises.

00:06:02.459 --> 00:06:08.579
And I love the way the Word of God, of course every word is pure, and we're thankful for

00:06:08.579 --> 00:06:15.339
every word that God has given us, but to think about exceeding great and precious promises,

00:06:15.339 --> 00:06:16.899
and truly they are.

00:06:16.899 --> 00:06:22.299
And there's a promise for every need that we as the people of God will face.

00:06:22.299 --> 00:06:26.220
And as we think about the promise that is here, and we think about the reality of how

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:31.059
we begin Genesis chapter number 26 with a problem, I believe this evening that it's

00:06:31.059 --> 00:06:37.859
so important for us when we face problems in life, and you will, when we face those

00:06:37.859 --> 00:06:42.859
times of difficulty, that we hold dear to the promises of God.

00:06:42.859 --> 00:06:48.339
That we find a promise, and we dig into the Word of God, and we grab hold of some promises,

00:06:48.339 --> 00:06:49.700
and we claim them.

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:50.700
Amen?

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:53.820
It's a good practice to pray the Word of God.

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:58.140
You pray back to God what He's promised us in His Word.

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:03.420
And you'll remember that great passage of Scripture at the dedication of the temple

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:08.100
when Solomon offers all of the offerings, and he prays, and God answers.

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:09.940
He says, I've heard your prayer.

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:16.220
And he says, it's a verse of Scripture that we often quote, 2 Chronicles 7 14, if my people

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:20.700
which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:22.859
from their wicked ways, so on and so forth.

00:07:22.859 --> 00:07:30.019
And you find that when you look further through the history of Israel that you have kings,

00:07:30.019 --> 00:07:37.739
and you have people of God that are praying that prayer because that's what God promised.

00:07:37.739 --> 00:07:43.380
And it's amazing when you begin to look at the Word of God and you find the promises

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:44.660
that God has given.

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:51.380
And He's given us so many promises that we claim them, and we pray them, and we find

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:55.500
here that Isaac is given this promise.

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:57.820
Notice what the Bible says.

00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:02.100
There's the problem is there in verse number one, Isaac, what does he do at the side of

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:03.100
the problem?

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:06.779
He goes unto Abimelech, the king of the Philistines, unto Gerar.

00:08:06.779 --> 00:08:09.980
The Bible says in verse number two, and the Lord appeared unto him.

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:12.380
Aren't you thankful for that?

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:20.500
The Lord appeared unto him and said, notice what the Lord said, go not down into Egypt.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.540
Dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of.

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:28.660
The promise given that we'll look at here in these next few verses, I would say it this

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:31.380
way, it was a conditional promise.

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:36.859
The promise that is given, not the entirety of it, a portion of the promise is conditional

00:08:36.859 --> 00:08:41.059
on Isaac being in the place where God told him to be.

00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:42.059
Right?

00:08:42.059 --> 00:08:46.900
Now, he speaks about a land and a seed, and we know that that promise was given to Abraham

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:47.900
as unconditional.

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:52.140
But we think about the blessings that are mentioned in this portion of Scripture with

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:58.820
regard to his time in Gerar, we find that these promises, this promise is given with

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:04.059
regard to the condition that Isaac go not down into Egypt.

00:09:04.059 --> 00:09:07.820
You know what's important for us as the people of God to be in the place where God wants

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:10.340
us to be?

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:16.140
It's important for us to understand that God's blessing flows out and is poured out as we

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:20.380
are obedient to him as we're in the place where he wants us to be.

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:25.020
A preacher of yesteryear said, don't expect God to bless you where you are if you're not

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:27.340
where you're supposed to be.

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:31.859
And the reality is that we find here in the text of Scripture that God makes it very clear

00:09:31.859 --> 00:09:37.299
and very plain, go not down into Egypt.

00:09:37.299 --> 00:09:40.299
He tells him to dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of.

00:09:40.299 --> 00:09:42.739
We find that he's going to be here in Gerar.

00:09:42.739 --> 00:09:47.539
It says sojourn in this land, verse number three, notice this, I will be with thee.

00:09:47.539 --> 00:09:49.859
Isn't that a great promise?

00:09:49.859 --> 00:09:52.299
We have that promise today, do we not?

00:09:52.299 --> 00:09:57.539
You think about the many people of God that had that promise and how God encouraged them.

00:09:57.539 --> 00:10:00.340
The reality is that many years from now...

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:04.620
contextually when you look at all that's taking place in Genesis, Jacob would

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:08.860
receive that promise. Remember when he's gonna go down into Egypt and God tells

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:13.380
him, don't be fearful to go down into Egypt, I will be with thee. You think

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:19.060
about the truth of Joshua. Joshua in chapter number one, he's told, I'm gonna

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:24.500
be with you. And you think about Jeremiah receives that same promise. We have that

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:30.020
promise. Remember Hebrews 13, when the Word of God tells us, I will never leave

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:38.940
thee nor forsake thee. What a great truth. I will be with thee. Notice this, and will

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:45.020
bless thee. Don't you want God's blessing? Man, I want God's blessing. I mentioned

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:50.300
this in a message, I don't know, several weeks ago, that God's blessing comes in

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:54.740
different ways and it's varied. You know, there are times in which perhaps at face

00:10:54.740 --> 00:11:00.260
value we may have a blessing from God that we may not initially acknowledge as

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:04.140
being a blessing. We may actually think it's an inconvenience, but God was

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:09.420
actually blessing us and keeping us from something other that could have

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:17.540
transpired. And the reality is that here God tells his man, he tells him that I'm

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:21.420
going to be with you, he tells him I'm gonna bless thee. Notice it says, for unto

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:25.980
thee and unto thy seed I will give all these countries, and I will perform the

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:30.980
oath which I swear unto Abraham thy father, and I will make thy seed to

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:35.900
multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these countries,

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:40.820
and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed. Because that

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:46.060
Abraham obeyed my voice and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:51.020
my laws. And the Bible says, and Isaac dwelt in Gerar. Aren't you thankful the

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:55.540
Word of God doesn't tell us that he went down to Egypt? It would have been a grave mistake,

00:11:55.540 --> 00:12:00.100
would it not? After God had appeared to him and spoken to him and said, here's

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:04.580
what my plan is, here's what my promise is. And as we think

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:09.300
about the promises, and we think about the the situation in which Isaac finds

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:14.020
himself, yes, dealing with a real problem. A famine is a real problem. But I'm

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:18.060
thankful that God appears to him, and God speaks to him, and God gives him this

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:22.940
promise. You know, this evening, when we face difficulties in life, when we have

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:27.700
problems, and maybe you say, I'm in the midst of a problem right now, maybe

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:32.220
you've just dealt with some problems, and you could stand and testify and speak

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:37.260
about how God's Word ministered to your heart, and how his promises helped you

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:43.260
through that season of difficulty, and how we need the promises of God. We need

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:49.060
the Word of God. And what a blessing to know that God's Word ministers to our

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:55.980
hearts. You know, every difficulty that we face, God knows about. He knows about it

00:12:55.980 --> 00:13:00.100
before we ever face it. I mention this as I preach through the passage of Scripture

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:05.780
with Abraham facing the famine. Isn't it amazing how that God called and led

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:11.140
Abraham to go to the place where God called him to go, and as he arrived, there

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:15.380
was a famine. God could have called him at a different time. God could have

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:19.420
prevented that famine from happening at the time in which it did, but God allowed

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:24.020
him to come to that place at that time. And here in Isaac's life, this famine was

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:29.740
no surprise to God. It may have surprised Isaac, but it was no surprise to God.

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:35.380
Your problem may surprise you, but it's no surprise to God. Amen? God sees it. He

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:41.940
knows. And let me say this, He's allowed it. Amen? Do we believe that God is sovereign?

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:45.900
Do we believe that He has all power? Do we believe that He can do all things? Absolutely.

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:53.020
And so we face those problems, those difficulties in life, then we find that God has allowed

00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:58.940
those things. I want you to notice as we continue moving through Genesis 26, there's a problem,

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:04.580
there's a promise. Now I want you to see God's protection. In verses 7-11, we find

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:11.620
here that Isaac repeats the sin of Abraham. Remember this happened in Egypt with Abraham.

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:17.700
It happened also with Abimelech with Abraham and Sarah. And here we find that Isaac is

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:23.820
going to repeat the same sin. And we said this a few messages ago, that living by faith

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:32.260
does not require scheming. It doesn't require that we scheme. And here we find that in Genesis

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:39.580
26, in verses 7-11, that once again we're going to see this repeated sin of saying,

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:44.500
she's my sister. Notice in verse number 7, the men of the place asked him of his wife,

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:50.420
and he said, she is my sister. Why do you say that? He's motivated by fear. Listen,

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:56.980
when we live in fear, we make bad decisions. Amen? Seriously, God's not given us a spirit

00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:03.260
of fear. Amen? And it says here that he's fearful. It says, she is my sister, for he

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:08.500
feared to say, she is my wife. Why? Lest, said he, the men of the place should kill

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:13.880
me for Rebekah, because she was fair to look upon. And it came to pass when he had been

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:18.300
there a long time, the Bible doesn't tell us the period of time exactly, it just tells

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:22.660
us he was there for a long time, that Abimelech, king of the Philistines, looked out of a window

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:28.100
and saw, and behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife. It means to caress. And

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:34.420
obviously, as Abimelech noticed this activity, it was quite clear in his mind that this is

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:38.940
not the behavior of a brother and sister, this would be the behavior of a husband and

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:44.620
wife. And he observes that and therefore he calls Isaac, according to verse number 9,

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:50.660
he says, behold, of a surety, she is thy wife. And how saidest thou, she is my sister? And

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:57.140
Isaac said unto him, because I said, lest I die for her. And Abimelech said, what is

00:15:57.140 --> 00:16:02.460
this thou hast done unto us? One of the people might likely have lined with thy wife, and

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:06.900
thou shouldst have brought guiltiness upon us. And Abimelech charged all his people saying,

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:11.900
he that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:16.980
Let me make a couple of observations as we look at God's protection. First of all, I

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:21.500
am thankful that God is able to protect His people. I mention this as we look at both

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:27.140
accounts of Abraham dealing with the same situation that I believe with all of my heart

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:31.500
that Isaac could have walked right into Gerard and said, yes, she is my wife, and that's

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:38.100
the end of the story, and God could have divinely protected both he and his wife. Amen? He didn't

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:44.260
have to scheme. And by the way, when we claim to live by faith, when we claim to be obedient

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:48.140
to the Lord and walking with the Lord, isn't it embarrassing when someone else has to point

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:54.540
out our inconsistencies? Right? I mean, think about this. Abimelech had to point out to

00:16:54.540 --> 00:17:06.140
Isaac that he lied to him. That's shameful, is it not? Did not Isaac know the God of heaven?

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:12.480
Would not Isaac have an opportunity to show to Abimelech what God is able to do in his

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:18.400
faith in God? But at times in our own lives, we can fail and falter under the pressure

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:24.640
even as Isaac does in this portion of Scripture, and here Abimelech has to call him out for

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:32.080
what has happened and what he told him, and we find that God protects. Now, God uses Abimelech

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:37.520
to give this charge in verse number 11, but I'm thankful for the protection of the Lord.

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:44.440
And let me say this. We must remember that safety is of the Lord. Amen? Safety is of

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:51.040
the Lord. The horse is prepared for the day of battle, but safety is of the Lord. That's

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:57.520
what the Word of God tells us. And this evening, when we think about the circumstances that

00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:03.240
Isaac is facing and we consider the problem and all that's taking place, and he receives

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:09.840
this promise from God, and it begins by God saying, I will be with thee, and I will bless

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:18.000
thee. And he gets in the place and he says, well, she's actually my sister. Man. Safety

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:24.280
is of the Lord. Sometimes we try to scheme and devise and provide some measure of safety

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:29.480
or protection for ourselves, but we must recognize that, yes, we can take certain steps and we

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:39.000
shall, but the reality is that safety is of the Lord. Amen? I've mentioned many times,

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:47.040
and it's true in so many areas of life, that we have grown as human beings to come to a

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:56.760
place where we look at a situation and we assess the risk, and we mitigate risk, and

00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:02.660
then at some point we assume risk. Right? When you drove here this evening, you took

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:10.760
a certain measure of risk. Amen? You get on the metro. You get in somebody else's car.

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:18.960
You get on an airplane. You're assuming a certain amount of risk. You've done your process

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:24.000
that you've gone through and you have assessed it and you've mitigated it as much as you

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.020
possibly could. Hopefully you wore a seatbelt when you came and you checked some things

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:32.840
on the vehicle to make sure they're in good working order and so on and so forth. But

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:39.600
we have to, at some point, take the risk. When I speak of it from a physical, natural

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:46.260
perspective, right? And here we find that it's so important that we would take these

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:52.920
lessons from Abraham and from Isaac here, and we'd say, listen, we don't have to scheme,

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:58.120
we don't have to come up with a story, we can just trust God because God is able. Did

00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:00.320
God protect Sarah from...

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:09.520
from Pharaoh? Yeah, absolutely. Did God protect Sarah from Abimelech? Absolutely.

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:17.360
Does God protect Rebecca from Abimelech? Yeah. In any of those three accounts, was

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:22.800
it because of the scheme and plan of Abraham or Isaac? Had nothing to do with

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:29.480
them. In fact, their scheme and their plan caused embarrassment, right? And shows a

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:36.040
lack of faith. So we see God's protection as we move on through the portion of Scripture

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:41.200
in verses 12 through 25. And then again in verses 32 and 33, we see number four, God's

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:45.760
provision. God's provision. You know, the Bible says there in verse number three, when

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:52.080
he gave them the promise, I will be with thee and will bless thee. In verses 12 and 13,

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:58.000
right out of the gate, we begin to see the blessing that God poured out upon Isaac. The

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:05.600
Bible says, then Isaac sowed in that land and received in the same year a hundredfold,

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:13.360
and the Lord blessed him. Isn't that phenomenal? His yield was significant. The Bible says

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:19.900
that he received in the same year a hundredfold, and that was the direct result of the blessing

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:25.320
of God. It says that the Lord blessed him. Notice in verse number 13, and the man, speaking

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:32.440
of Isaac, waxed great and went forward and grew until he became very great. For he had

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:38.580
possession of flocks and possession of herds and great store of servants, and the Philistines

00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:43.920
envied him. As you think about verses 12 through 14, and you think about the blessing that

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:51.000
is made here, the reference and how God records for us, how he made the name of Isaac great,

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:57.280
and you think about the truth that God always does what God says he will do. God told him,

00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:02.760
don't go to Egypt. Dwell in the land that I tell thee of. And it's here in Gerard that

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:08.160
God tells him to be, and we find that God says, I'll be with thee and I will bless thee,

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:17.400
and God blesses Isaac. He blesses him. And it's a blessing that is not only understood

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:22.960
as we read the Scripture and something that he enjoyed, but we see that it was a blessing

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:30.200
that others also observed. The Bible tells us that the Philistines envied him. Now he

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:35.800
is living in Gerard. He's in this place. He goes to Abimelech. Abimelech is the king of

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:39.840
the Philistines, according to verse number 1, and he's there in that place, and the Bible

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:46.360
tells us that they envied him. It's interesting in verse number 27, it tells them that Isaac

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:51.880
says unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:56.960
Notice what they say. They said, we say, in verse number 28, they said, We saw certainly

00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:05.600
that the Lord was with thee. It's interesting because we found that in the life of Abraham,

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:10.880
back in Genesis chapter number 21, this was said also. Abimelech makes this statement

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:18.000
to Abraham that God is with thee in all that thou doest, and we find that that's in Genesis

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:25.680
21 and verse number 22. It's a precious thing, not a reason to boast except for to boast

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:33.660
in our God when others see the blessing of God in our lives. Amen? It gives us opportunity

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:39.840
to testify of God's work in our lives. Listen, I'm nothing, but He's everything, and He's

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:46.920
done this, and He's working, and to God be the glory. Great things He hath done. Amen?

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:54.600
And we find here that they envied Him, and this turns into, as we look at the situation,

00:23:54.600 --> 00:24:00.080
there's now some contention that takes place, and God's provision is there, and though there's

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:05.680
some issues that He's going to face in these next several verses, the Bible tells us in

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:10.840
verse number 15, for all the wells which the Father's servant, which His Father's servants

00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:15.320
had digged in the days of Abraham His father, notice the Bible says the Philistines had

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:25.040
stopped them and filled them with earth. That's a problem, isn't it? It's kind of confusing

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:29.720
as to why the Philistines would do this because it's actually counterproductive. Not only

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:34.800
does it have an adverse impact on Isaac and all that's taking place for him, but no doubt

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:41.559
it would adversely affect them as well. Right? I mean, water is precious. It is a precious

00:24:41.559 --> 00:24:49.520
and needed commodity. Amen? Water, especially in a land like this, water is precious. And

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:54.320
we find that the Bible tells us that they stopped up these wells. It says in verse number

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:59.119
16, Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us, for thou art much mightier than we, and that's

00:24:59.119 --> 00:25:03.600
what Isaac references in verse 27 when he says, You sent me away from you. So the Bible

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:07.920
says that Isaac departed thence and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar and dwelt

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:13.360
there. And Isaac digged again the wells of water. Why? Because water is necessary. They

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:17.640
need water. Remember it tells us in verse number 14 that he had possession of flocks

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:22.760
and herds and great store of servants. And so we know that we need water as human beings

00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:26.899
and he needs water. His family needs water. All the servants need water. But you think

00:25:26.899 --> 00:25:31.600
about the flocks and the herds, they too need water. There's a need for water. And so he

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:35.440
goes and it says that he digged again the wells of water, which they digged in the days

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:40.559
of Abraham, his father, for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham.

00:25:40.559 --> 00:25:44.160
And he called their names after the names by which his father had called them. Verse

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:49.520
19, And Isaac's servants digged in the valley and found there a well of spring water. What

00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:53.480
a blessing that must have been. But it was a short-lived blessing, for we find that there's

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:58.440
some contention. The Bible says in verse 20, The herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's

00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:04.160
herdmen, saying, The water is ours. And he called the name of the well Isaac, because

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:10.520
they strove with him. This first well that is mentioned in verse number 20 that they

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:15.080
digged in verse number 19 and found the water, it's called Isaac. And the word literally

00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:20.220
means contention. And you see the contention that he's dealing with and he's facing this.

00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:26.160
And so the Bible tells us in verse 21, They dig another well. Why? They need water. They

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:30.839
need water. So they dig another well. And the Bible says they strove for that also.

00:26:30.839 --> 00:26:35.839
And he called the name of it Sitna. That word means strife. And you see that where it says

00:26:35.839 --> 00:26:44.119
they strove for that also. And he, Isaac, removed from fence, in verse 22, and digged

00:26:44.119 --> 00:26:51.520
another well. And for that they strove not. And he called the name of it Rehoboth. And

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:58.520
he said, For now the Lord hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.

00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:05.080
And he went up from fence to Beersheba. And so we find that here in verse number 22, Rehoboth,

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:09.240
it means a wide place, plenty of room. You see that he makes that statement, For now

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:13.600
the Lord hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land. Skip down, if you

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:17.100
will, to verse 32. It tells us at the end of verse number 23 that he went up from fence

00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:21.820
to Beersheba. It says in verse number 32, And it came to pass the same day that Isaac's

00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:25.860
servants came and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto

00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:30.899
him, We have found water. And he called it Sheba, before the name of the city is Beersheba

00:27:30.899 --> 00:27:37.100
unto this day. And you can read of this in Genesis 21, verses 31 through 34, as well

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:42.100
in the life of Abraham. And it's kind of interesting because the same, really, conversation that

00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:46.700
we're going to read of here in just a few moments between Abimelech and Isaac is very

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:52.020
similar to that which took place between Abraham and Abimelech back in Genesis chapter number

00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:58.660
21. But I want you to just focus for just a moment on God's provision. We think about

00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:03.420
the problem. We started in verse number 1 by acknowledging the problem. And the problem

00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:08.740
was a famine. There's a promise that comes from God. The Lord appears to him and gives

00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:13.020
him a promise. And that promise was that I'll be with you and I'll bless you. And

00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:18.660
it continues with regard to the land and the seed and so on and so forth. We find that

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:23.779
there's God's protection and there's God's provision. I'm thankful for the provision

00:28:23.779 --> 00:28:30.980
of God. Aren't you? And I'm thankful that God is able to provide. He is the provider.

00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:37.380
Amen? And when you consider this evening, when we think about the truth of who our God

00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:44.100
is, I'd say this. He is a good provider. Let me say it this way. He knows what we need.

00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:51.179
Right? Who knows better what they need, the sheep or the shepherd? The shepherd. But the

00:28:51.179 --> 00:28:56.739
sheep think they know what they need. Right? Amen? I mean, seriously. The sheep, we think

00:28:56.739 --> 00:29:03.380
we know what we need. But God knows what we need. He knows what our needs are. And He

00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:09.220
graciously provides for us. So often we think about provision, we think of it from a temporal

00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:15.220
perspective. And we think about the provision of sustenance and what have you. And certainly

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:20.380
you see that here in the portion of Scripture. But I'm thankful for His spiritual provision.

00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:24.700
I'm thankful that He's given me all things that pertain unto life and godliness. That

00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:30.179
He's blessed me with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places. I'm thankful for God's

00:29:30.179 --> 00:29:37.299
spiritual provision that He's given us. Listen, the church is not man's idea. The church is

00:29:37.299 --> 00:29:43.859
God's plan. Amen? And God ordained the church and God equipped the church and He gave the

00:29:43.859 --> 00:29:49.900
church its marching orders and He's given us the program that we're to follow and we

00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:57.020
find that God has provided for us. He's given us everything that we need. Amen? The Lord

00:29:57.020 --> 00:30:00.380
is my shepherd, I shall not want.

00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:08.260
not want." Right? I don't need anything. Why? Because He provides. A good shepherd

00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:13.420
provides for a sheep. Right? Nation of Israel, they had some bad shepherds. You

00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:17.740
look through the the the prophets and you read about the the bad shepherds and

00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:20.740
how they cared more of themselves than they did for the sheep and so on and so

00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:26.260
forth. The people and the truth is given there. The Lord Jesus Christ, He was moved

00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:30.020
with compassion in Matthew. Why? Because He saw that the people were scattered

00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:38.700
abroad as sheep not having a shepherd. He's moved with compassion. He knows what

00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:44.980
our needs are. In the midst of that problem, He's able to provide. In the

00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:48.820
midst of the problem, He's given a promise. In the midst of the problem, He

00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:53.860
provides protection. In the midst of the problem, His provision is always there.

00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:59.620
And we ought to rejoice in that. We ought to thank God for that. As we continue

00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:03.860
looking at the passage of Scripture, we've mentioned the problem, the promise,

00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:09.180
God's protection, and God's provision. In verses 26 through 31, we read of a pact.

00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:14.780
This pact or this treaty that is mentioned in verses 26 through 31. Look

00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:18.940
back, if you will, at verse 24. I think I stopped reading a little early. And the

00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:23.260
Lord appeared unto him the same night and said, verse number 24, I am the God of

00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:27.220
Abraham thy father. Fear not for I am with thee and will bless thee and

00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:30.820
multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake. And he built an altar

00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:34.540
there and called upon the name of the Lord and pitched his tent there. And

00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:39.340
there Isaac's servants digged they well. It says in verse number 26, as we read

00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:44.500
about this pact that is given here, it says here that Abimelech went to him

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:50.300
from Gerar and Ahuzeth, one of his friends, and Phicol, the chief captain of

00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:54.220
his army. Now it's interesting because Abimelech and Phicol were the ones

00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:58.540
that went to Abraham back in Genesis chapter 21, and you can read of that

00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:03.780
there. I preached that message several weeks, maybe months ago at this point, and

00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:09.419
we find that it was there that this same conversation really took place. Notice

00:32:09.419 --> 00:32:13.580
what is said as they come to him and Isaac said unto them, wherefore come ye

00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:17.620
to me, saying, ye hate me and have sent me away from you. Notice what they say in

00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:25.180
verse 28. We saw certainly that the Lord was with thee. We said, let there be now

00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:30.540
an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with

00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:36.500
thee, that thou wilt do us no hurt as we have not touched thee, and as we have

00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:41.779
done unto thee nothing but good and have sent thee away in peace, thou art now the

00:32:41.779 --> 00:32:47.500
blessed of the Lord. And so this pact that we look at here is they are

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:53.779
desiring to have a peace treaty. They're desiring to have a treaty with Isaac.

00:32:53.779 --> 00:32:57.460
They're concerned about seeing that the Lord is with them, that he's very great

00:32:57.460 --> 00:33:02.419
in all that takes place, and we find here, again, similar to what happened in

00:33:02.419 --> 00:33:07.620
Genesis chapter 21, the entrance of Abimelech in Genesis chapter 21 to

00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:12.820
Abraham was in verse 22 when he said, God is with thee in all that thou doest, and

00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:18.139
he goes through and again he asks him to make this pact or this agreement with

00:33:18.139 --> 00:33:25.059
him. We notice here that the Bible tells us in verse number 20, excuse me, verse

00:33:25.059 --> 00:33:30.460
number 30, that he, Isaac, made them a feast and they did eat and drink. They

00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:34.820
rose up betimes in the morning and swear one to another, and Isaac sent them away

00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:40.300
and they departed from him in peace. And so this pact is made, this treaty, if you

00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:45.580
will, is made. Let me say this. I think that it's important, and you'll find many

00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:50.540
times throughout the Scriptures, that the Word of God tells us that others observe

00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:56.860
that the Lord is with someone. Amen? We saw it with Abraham. We see it here with

00:33:56.860 --> 00:34:03.300
Isaac. We find that it's known of Joseph, right? And you could go through

00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:08.380
and you could look at a number of people of God, biblical characters, where it was

00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:14.300
obvious to others as they observed a life that God was with them. I mentioned

00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:18.860
this morning in 1 Samuel chapter number 16 and how that unnamed servant of

00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:23.940
Saul, at the end of his description of how he's a cunning player of the harp

00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:28.380
and all that he says about David, he doesn't even use his name in the passage

00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:33.380
of Scripture, but he says that the Lord is with him. And the reality this evening

00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:36.779
is that as we think about even the message that I preached this morning and

00:34:36.779 --> 00:34:40.459
we think about that external evidence, listen, it ought to be obvious to others

00:34:40.459 --> 00:34:46.820
that God is blessing us, that the Lord is with us. Amen? People should see

00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:52.860
there's something different about us, and they're not looking... Listen, the world

00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:59.779
is in a mess. Will you agree with that? They don't know it, or if they do, they

00:34:59.779 --> 00:35:05.339
deny it, right? Is that fair? A lot of people don't want to admit that their

00:35:05.339 --> 00:35:13.300
life is a mess, but reality tells us that our world is just... things are going nuts.

00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:18.380
They need to see there's something different about us. They need to see in

00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:27.619
you and in me, God. They need to see the Lord in us. Amen? And I think I mentioned

00:35:27.619 --> 00:35:34.779
about a song that Ron Hamilton had written, I Saw Jesus in You. Is that the

00:35:34.779 --> 00:35:43.380
the title of that song? And man, what a great song. I saw Jesus in you. And the

00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:48.179
reality is that why were they first called Christians in Antioch? Because

00:35:48.179 --> 00:35:53.020
they were like the Lord, right? Their behavior resembled that of the Lord

00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:57.300
Jesus Christ. You know that Christian is not the name, the term that we gave

00:35:57.300 --> 00:36:03.500
ourselves. That's what they referred to these followers of Christ. They referred

00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:08.940
to them as Christians. Jesus uses the term disciple, right? That's the word that He

00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:14.059
uses. You find it used repeatedly of disciple, but they first called them

00:36:14.059 --> 00:36:21.860
Christians. And this evening, others ought to see Christ in us. I do not agree with

00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:28.660
most of the philosophy of the individual, but many, many years ago someone said

00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:37.059
this, I like your Christ, but I don't like your Christians, because your Christians

00:36:37.059 --> 00:36:43.500
are nothing like your Christ. Isn't that sad? The philosophy of the individual that

00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:50.140
said that is not worth following. But what an observation that was made. The

00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:54.500
reality is that Christians ought to be like Christ. And when they make this

00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:59.860
observation, and again I said this when I mentioned in Genesis 21 with Abraham, I

00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:05.140
don't believe that it was simple flattery. There could be some aspect of

00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:09.380
that. There's some Bible scholars that would argue that Abimelech was just

00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:14.500
trying to flatter in order to provide peace for himself. But the reality is

00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:19.820
that God's already told us that He's blessed him, and how He's blessed him, and

00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:24.739
that the Philistines envied Him. Why? Because of what they saw. They saw that

00:37:24.739 --> 00:37:28.580
Lord was blessing them, and the Lord was with Him. And for that, we ought to

00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:33.619
rejoice, and we ought to desire that others would see Christ in us. As we

00:37:33.619 --> 00:37:41.980
close out the passage of Scripture, sadly we finish with a pain, a heartache. The

00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:48.500
Bible tells us in verse number 34 that Esau was now 40 years old. It's

00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:55.459
interesting for the Scriptures to go through all of these events, and then nothing

00:37:55.459 --> 00:38:00.420
from the end of chapter 25 deal with Jacob and Esau at all. And then now the

00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:05.860
attention goes back to Esau here. The Bible tells us that he was 40 years old.

00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:11.700
And it tells us that he took to wife Judith, the daughter of Berei, the Hittite,

00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:19.820
and Bashamath, the daughter of Elon, the Hittite. Esau took two wives, both of

00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:25.940
them being Hittites. And the Bible tells us in verse number 35, notice what it

00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:35.739
says, which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah. Or a grief of mind

00:38:35.739 --> 00:38:40.460
unto Isaac and to Rebekah. And it's sad when you think about those words there

00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:47.059
that are given, and you think about the grief, the pain that they dealt with. And

00:38:47.059 --> 00:38:51.859
as I begin to think about that within the context of the broader scope of Genesis

00:38:51.859 --> 00:38:55.380
chapter 26, and I begin to see everything that's taking place, the

00:38:55.380 --> 00:39:01.460
reality is that there will be continued times of heartache and disappointment.

00:39:01.859 --> 00:39:07.940
Sometimes the people that we love the most will hurt us, will pain us, will

00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:18.619
grieve us, right? But let me say this, God never fails us, and God never changes. He

00:39:18.619 --> 00:39:28.220
is the same yesterday, and today, and forever, right? And man may fail us. The

00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:34.380
folks that we invest in, the people that we love, Paul speaks of this when he

00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:37.780
speaks to the believers in the region of Galatians, the book of Galatians. He said

00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:42.140
that when I was there you would have plucked out your eyes for me. But now

00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:48.099
because I tell you the truth, I've become your enemy. The more I love, the less I

00:39:48.099 --> 00:39:53.340
be loved, is what Paul says. And the reality is that there will be times of

00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:58.179
pain in our lives. The problem that starts Genesis 26, it's interesting, all

00:39:58.179 --> 00:40:02.460
that takes place, and then you read of this

00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:07.680
pain at the end of the passage, but I would submit to you that though it ends on maybe

00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:14.080
this sad note of this pain in verses 34 and 35, the reality is that that cycle that we

00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:19.000
really looked at in Genesis chapter 26, though it doesn't continue in that same vein in

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:23.440
dealing with the same dialogue in which we're looking at, I would submit to you this evening

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:28.760
that the reality is that we still have promises from God.

00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:30.720
Amen?

00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:34.840
And we still have God's protection and God's provision.

00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:36.280
Amen?

00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:41.360
And I look at it kind of this way as I look at the whole of Genesis 26.

00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:46.200
The Bible says of Job that man is born a few days and full of troubles, right?

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:51.080
And you think about David and he speaks in Psalm 34 about how the Lord delivered him

00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:53.160
out of all of his troubles.

00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:56.120
Paul speaks about all of his adversities.

00:40:56.120 --> 00:41:02.280
And the reality is that someone said this, and I read it many, many years ago, that you're

00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:06.400
either in the midst of a storm, you've just come through a storm, or there's a storm

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:07.800
on the horizon, right?

00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:13.400
That's how they've defined or described the storms of life and the difficulties, the

00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:15.620
problems in which we face.

00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:19.000
And the reality is that sometimes it seems as if they kind of compound.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.240
We just get through one problem and there's another one that's coming, right?

00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:25.160
And it kind of can seem like it's back to back that way.

00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:32.600
But through it all, God is good and God is seeking to develop us and to help us know

00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:39.360
that He is who He said He was and He is able to do what only He can do.

00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:45.480
We deal with problems and we go through and see the faithfulness of God and see what God

00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:46.480
is able to do.

00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:50.600
It helps us for the next problem that we encounter, right?

00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:51.840
That's how it works.

00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:59.200
When you think about studies in our, you know, just school, and you think about academics,

00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:02.040
you begin to think about mathematics.

00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:06.560
They don't start combining letters and numbers until you have a good grasp on just dealing

00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:09.920
with letters or just numbers, right?

00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:13.440
In arithmetic, you start with 1 plus 1.

00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:17.920
Some of the youngest in our group tonight, they could tell us 1 plus 1 is 2, right?

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:19.120
We understand it.

00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:23.760
And then when you start with introducing algebra and having the numbers and the letters,

00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:25.840
it starts real simple, right?

00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:28.280
3 plus A equals 7.

00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:29.280
Find out what A is.

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:32.040
I mean, it's not hard, right?

00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:38.480
And then eventually you get to those expressions that have all of these letters and I loved

00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:43.920
it when I was in high school and now I don't even want to think about it.

00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:46.480
But there was a foundation that was established.

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:51.760
There was a growth process that enabled us to get to the point where we could handle

00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:53.760
the more complicated problems.

00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:55.960
Does that make sense?

00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:57.840
We experience that in life, right?

00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:02.520
The complicated problems come after the foundation is developed.

00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:08.080
And in life, when we deal with problems, we understand that God is allowing those things

00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:15.120
in our lives to develop us so that when those more complicated matters come, we're prepared

00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:16.960
for them.

00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:24.040
I don't want to do any disservice to Scripture whatsoever for we know that Esau was a grief

00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:25.040
to his parents.

00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:30.600
In fact, the reality is that he found out that this was a grief to his parents and he

00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:34.360
went and married others that would grieve their hearts as well.

00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:36.360
We understand that.

00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:40.440
But I would say to you as we think about the problems of life and the problems that we

00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:48.520
deal with is that there might be a problem that we face today that seems insurmountable,

00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:52.240
just overwhelming.

00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:57.720
But I promise you, as you look at the Word of God, it will prepare you for the next storm.

00:43:57.720 --> 00:44:02.760
And when my heart is overwhelmed, what did the psalmist say in Psalm 61, lead me to the

00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:07.360
rock that is higher than I, amen?

00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:13.000
And the reality this evening is that, yes, there are storms and problems, but God is

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.000
faithful.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.880
God is faithful.

00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:19.160
And we've got to look for the promises.

00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:22.680
Man, get into the Word of God.

00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:27.520
And as we read, and that's why it's so important to have a daily walk with God because you

00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:30.680
never know when the problem is going to come, right?

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:36.760
Listen, if you begin to prepare for the problem the day it comes, man, that's rough.

00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:40.880
It's a challenge.

00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:46.960
But when you daily walk with God, and God gives you the truth and the promises, and

00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:53.160
He's building your faith and He's equipping you, and that problem comes, that difficulty

00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:56.000
arises, you say, I have a promise for this.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.840
In fact, I have many promises for this.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:04.640
And I'm trusting God to do what only God can do, and we begin to see His blessing in the

00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:07.940
time of difficulty.

00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:10.240
We see how He's working and what He's doing.

00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:18.280
I think it was just a few nights ago in our devotional book for this year, talked about

00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:20.960
a pessimist and an optimist.

00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:28.200
A pessimist sees the problem or the obstacle in every problem, and the optimist sees the

00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:34.400
opportunity, or the opportunity in every obstacle, something like that.

00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:39.120
And the reality is that we're going to face difficulties, but man, we've got to keep our

00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:41.000
eyes on God.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:42.180
God is able.

00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:45.360
And I'm thankful that right in the midst of the famine, the problem being announced in

00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:51.320
verse number one, that verse number two says that the Lord appeared to Isaac and He spoke

00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:54.320
to him, He said to him.

00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:59.320
God's still speaking to His people today through His Word, amen?

00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:08.620
Be still and know that I am God, and He has promises, and He will never, ever fail on

00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:11.760
any promise that He's ever given us, amen?

00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:14.920
So we ought to rejoice in knowing who our God is.

00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:18.680
Yeah, there's problems, but man, the promises and the protection of God and the provision

00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:21.880
of God, we ought to rejoice greatly.

00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:26.760
Isaac made an altar there, the Bible tells us, and what a blessing.

00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:31.840
Take some time and pause and thank God for who He is and what He's done for us, amen?

00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:34.000
We serve a great God.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:39.040
Sometimes in the midst of problems, the enemy wants to get us down and defeat it, right?

00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:43.320
Woe is me, everything's falling apart, God doesn't love me, God doesn't know where I

00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:45.120
am, God doesn't…

00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:46.880
We can get that way.

00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:55.960
David, I mentioned this on Wednesday night, David said in Psalm 13, how long, O Lord,

00:46:55.960 --> 00:47:00.880
will Thou forget me, forever?

00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:06.280
You think about somebody that's dealing with a problem, feeling alone, right?

00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:11.080
God doesn't know, He doesn't forget you, He never forgets us, amen?

00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:16.480
He knows exactly where we are, and He knows exactly what we're dealing with, praise God.

00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:18.080
Let's pray.

00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:19.080
Father, we love You.

00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:20.080
Thank You for loving us.

00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:30.280
We went through a lot this evening, and I hope in just a moment or two as we close,

00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:36.880
that we would focus our attention on You.

00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:40.880
Rejoice in the fact that You are faithful.

00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:46.200
You've given us exceeding great and precious promises.

00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:53.000
The glory is of the Lord that You provide the protection that we need, that Your provision

00:47:53.000 --> 00:48:00.160
both temporally and spiritually is abundant, that You take good care of us.

00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:11.720
Lord, no doubt in any size group of people, problems are there.

00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:19.120
Lord, I pray that You'd help Your people tonight, as we deal with difficulties and

00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:24.120
adversities, that we'd keep our eyes on You.

00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:26.360
We'd see You work and bless as only You can.

00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:32.640
Help us to be in the place where we're supposed to be, as we saw with Isaac that that blessing

00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:37.880
was attached to that place.

00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:43.200
I pray that You'd help us to not live in fear, knowing that You've not given us a spirit

00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:45.960
of fear.

00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:50.119
Help us, Lord, to please You with our lives.

00:48:50.119 --> 00:48:52.360
Help us to walk in the light.

00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:55.400
Move and work as only You can, for it's in Christ's name we pray.
