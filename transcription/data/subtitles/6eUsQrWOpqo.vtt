00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.319
And I will admit at the beginning of this message

00:00:02.319 --> 00:00:05.199
that it will just be a springboard from Psalm 70,

00:00:05.199 --> 00:00:06.440
and we'll get into the message,

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.100
be in a number of different portions of scripture

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.239
this morning, and I trust it'll be a blessing to you.

00:00:12.239 --> 00:00:14.600
It's only five verses of scripture.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.399
Our thought for the message will come from verse number four,

00:00:17.399 --> 00:00:19.639
but let me read the entirety of the psalm

00:00:19.639 --> 00:00:22.040
and make a few comments by way of introduction.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.920
Notice the psalmist begins.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.520
It is a psalm of David.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.639
It's ascribed to David.

00:00:26.639 --> 00:00:28.719
And notice what he says in verse number one.

00:00:28.719 --> 00:00:32.639
Make haste, O God, to deliver me.

00:00:32.639 --> 00:00:36.860
Make haste to help me, O Lord.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.259
Aren't you thankful that he's able to deliver?

00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:41.759
Aren't you thankful that he's able to help?

00:00:41.759 --> 00:00:43.400
We find the psalmist said this.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.520
I will lift up mine eyes into the hills

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.200
from whence cometh my help.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.759
My help cometh from the Lord, which made heaven and earth.

00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:55.560
And I'm thankful that the creator God is my God.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.240
He is my helper.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.000
And here David begins.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.799
He uses the phrase make haste on two occasions.

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:04.160
Have you ever been in a difficulty

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.360
where you really need God to hurry up and get there?

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.199
Amen.

00:01:07.199 --> 00:01:09.239
And we think our timetable is different

00:01:09.239 --> 00:01:10.599
than God's timetable.

00:01:10.599 --> 00:01:15.279
And David is in such a situation that on two occasions,

00:01:15.279 --> 00:01:18.160
in one verse of scripture, as he's praying to God,

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.160
he says, make haste, O God, to deliver me.

00:01:23.199 --> 00:01:25.199
To deliver me.

00:01:25.199 --> 00:01:30.199
Make haste to help me, O Lord.

00:01:30.559 --> 00:01:33.160
Let them be ashamed and confounded

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.519
that seek after my soul.

00:01:35.519 --> 00:01:37.400
Let them be turned backward

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.040
and put to confusion that desire my hurt.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.239
We find that in verse number two,

00:01:43.239 --> 00:01:45.319
God gives us some additional insight

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:48.160
as to the prayer of David in verse number one

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.040
and why he is praying with such urgency.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.120
There are times in our lives where we pray with urgency

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.160
because of the situation in which we're facing.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.279
And we find that he mentions about those

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:02.599
that would seek his hurt,

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:06.959
those that would desire his soul.

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:09.399
Let them be turned back, verse number four,

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.199
for a reward of their shame that say, aha, aha.

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:14.839
Then he says this in verse number four,

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:19.839
let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.800
You know that we have the promise of the word of God

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.320
that if we seek him, that we'll find him.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.080
And we find that he says this,

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.559
let all those that seek thee,

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:32.960
that just got really kind of echoey there, Jim,

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.960
let them that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee.

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:41.479
Amen?

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:43.279
We're rejoicing in God.

00:02:43.279 --> 00:02:45.399
We're glad in the Lord.

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:46.240
Amen?

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.639
And we find that as we seek him,

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:49.800
by the way, we are told in the word of God

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:51.479
that we're to seek the Lord.

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:54.880
Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.119
and all these things shall be added unto you.

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:58.199
We are to seek the Lord,

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:59.720
set our affection on things above,

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.399
not on things of the earth.

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:02.960
And we find here that he says

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.039
that those that would seek the Lord,

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:06.720
that were to rejoice in the Lord,

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.000
that were to be glad in the Lord,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.720
then notice this,

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.759
and let such as love thy salvation,

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:18.160
say continually, not occasionally,

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.679
not every once in a while,

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.320
but let them say continually,

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.000
let God be magnified.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.119
Isn't that powerful truth?

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:32.000
Let those that love thy salvation

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.160
say continually, let God be magnified.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.000
Now we understand in verse number one

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.520
that the psalmist is praying for deliverance.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.440
And oftentimes in the Old Testament,

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.800
when you read the word salvation,

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.800
it's speaking of deliverance in this particular setting,

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.360
in this particular psalm.

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:51.039
It's deliverance from those

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:52.759
that are mentioned in verse number two,

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:54.759
that sought the soul of David,

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:56.880
that sought to hurt David,

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.759
and he's praying for deliverance,

00:03:58.759 --> 00:04:01.919
make haste, O God, to deliver me.

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:03.479
And as God would deliver,

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:05.759
and we find that David gives testimony

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:08.759
of God delivering him on a number of occasions,

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:11.039
he says, let them,

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:13.919
and let such as love thy salvation,

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:18.920
say continually, let God be magnified.

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.200
Notice what he says in verse five,

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.239
but I am poor and needy.

00:04:22.239 --> 00:04:24.440
Do you recognize that you're poor and needy?

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:26.480
Honestly.

00:04:27.399 --> 00:04:28.760
You know, sometimes if we're not careful,

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.480
we get that Laodicean attitude.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.720
I'm increased with goods and have need of nothing.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.119
Right, that's what it says in Revelation 3.

00:04:37.119 --> 00:04:38.160
But notice what the psalmist says,

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.880
I am poor and needy.

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.279
Without thee, I can do nothing.

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:47.720
Paul said, I know that in me that is in my flesh

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:48.920
is full of no good thing.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.679
He says this, I know that I am what I am

00:04:51.679 --> 00:04:53.480
by the grace of God.

00:04:54.519 --> 00:04:57.880
And here, the psalmist says, I am poor and needy.

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.279
Notice, he says again, this urgency

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:01.920
that we read in verse number one,

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.079
make haste unto me, O God.

00:05:05.079 --> 00:05:09.519
Thou art my help and my deliverer.

00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:13.760
O Lord, make no tarrying.

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:14.600
Wow.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:20.600
The psalmist understands how desperately he needs God.

00:05:23.079 --> 00:05:25.239
But he says in the middle of the text,

00:05:25.239 --> 00:05:30.239
in verse number four, that those that love thy salvation,

00:05:30.239 --> 00:05:35.239
that we are to say continually, let God be magnified.

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.880
Let God be magnified.

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.200
As a New Testament believer,

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.119
when I read the word salvation,

00:05:43.119 --> 00:05:46.399
I think more of my eternal salvation, don't you?

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:48.920
And we understand that he's delivered us

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.480
from the penalty of sin.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.959
He's delivered us from that death,

00:05:53.959 --> 00:05:56.079
that second death, the lake of fire,

00:05:56.079 --> 00:05:59.040
the separation from God for all of eternity.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.920
I am so thankful this morning.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.440
It is absolutely wonderful to be saved, isn't it?

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.559
I mean, we sang this morning,

00:06:06.559 --> 00:06:09.440
since Jesus came into my heart,

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.399
we sang this morning because he lives,

00:06:12.399 --> 00:06:15.559
we begin to think about our salvation in Jesus Christ.

00:06:15.559 --> 00:06:17.119
We understand this morning

00:06:17.119 --> 00:06:21.200
that when we consider our eternal security in Christ,

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.359
that we know that one day, one glorious day,

00:06:25.359 --> 00:06:29.359
we will put off this old tabernacle, as Peter says,

00:06:29.359 --> 00:06:32.839
and we will ever be with the Lord.

00:06:32.839 --> 00:06:34.559
Isn't that wonderful?

00:06:34.559 --> 00:06:36.679
We begin to think about our salvation,

00:06:36.679 --> 00:06:38.119
and we understand this morning

00:06:38.119 --> 00:06:40.320
that we have been saved by grace,

00:06:40.359 --> 00:06:44.200
and we are kept by the power of Almighty God.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.359
There is nothing that you did to get saved.

00:06:46.359 --> 00:06:48.480
There's nothing that you do to stay saved.

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:52.760
We are saved by grace, and we are kept by his power.

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.200
Jesus said this in John chapter number 10,

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.040
in verses 27 through 30.

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:00.160
He said, my sheep hear my voice, and I know them,

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.880
and I give unto them eternal life.

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.279
Then he says this, and they shall never perish.

00:07:06.279 --> 00:07:07.440
Isn't that wonderful?

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.920
He says, I give them eternal life,

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.440
and they shall never perish.

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:15.119
Neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.

00:07:15.119 --> 00:07:16.480
He then goes on to say this,

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:19.519
my Father which gave them me is greater than all,

00:07:19.519 --> 00:07:23.279
and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.

00:07:23.279 --> 00:07:26.440
I and my Father are one.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.119
Wow.

00:07:29.119 --> 00:07:31.119
Salvation is the work of God.

00:07:32.359 --> 00:07:34.519
I've said it already, but there's absolutely nothing

00:07:34.519 --> 00:07:38.440
that I did to assist God in my salvation.

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:39.279
Amen?

00:07:39.279 --> 00:07:41.239
He said, it is finished.

00:07:41.239 --> 00:07:45.600
We have spoken before how that biblical Christianity,

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:50.600
to say it this way, it's a done situation.

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:52.559
It's done, it's complete.

00:07:52.559 --> 00:07:54.519
It's paid in full.

00:07:54.519 --> 00:07:57.559
Many of the religions of the world are saying, do.

00:07:57.559 --> 00:07:59.600
What must you do?

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.559
No, no, the Philippian jailer said,

00:08:01.559 --> 00:08:03.200
what must I do to be saved?

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:06.079
And they simply said, believe on the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:08:06.079 --> 00:08:08.440
and thou shalt be saved.

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:11.920
Not only is there nothing that I did

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:13.359
to assist in my salvation,

00:08:13.359 --> 00:08:17.040
there's absolutely nothing I can do to keep my salvation.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.399
I am kept by the power of God.

00:08:19.399 --> 00:08:23.839
Therefore, as we would consider the statement of David

00:08:23.839 --> 00:08:26.440
in Psalm 70, and thinking about those that would love

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:30.320
the salvation, the deliverance, that temporal reference

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.039
that is being made in Psalm 70,

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:35.119
that they are to say continually, let God be magnified.

00:08:35.119 --> 00:08:38.239
How much greater for those of us that have been saved

00:08:38.239 --> 00:08:41.359
by the precious blood of Jesus Christ,

00:08:41.359 --> 00:08:46.359
that we ought to say of our lives, let God be magnified.

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.159
Let God be magnified.

00:08:49.159 --> 00:08:51.960
The truth of the Bible is that God is great.

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:53.559
Amen, aren't you thankful for that?

00:08:53.559 --> 00:08:56.159
God has declared His greatness in His word.

00:08:56.159 --> 00:08:58.239
He has demonstrated His greatness in His word.

00:08:58.239 --> 00:09:00.719
As you study the scriptures, you study,

00:09:00.719 --> 00:09:03.200
and God has revealed Himself to us,

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:07.080
and in so doing, He has revealed to us that He is great,

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:10.400
that He is the great God.

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.119
The psalmist says, great is the Lord,

00:09:12.119 --> 00:09:15.640
and greatly to be praised in Psalm 48 and verse number one.

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:18.159
The psalmist says this in Psalm 135,

00:09:18.159 --> 00:09:21.359
I know that the Lord is great.

00:09:21.359 --> 00:09:24.599
This morning, the idea of this thought,

00:09:24.599 --> 00:09:28.679
let God be magnified, the word magnify is to deem

00:09:28.679 --> 00:09:31.640
or declare great to exalt.

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:37.000
The reality this morning is that we that have been saved,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.159
those of us that know the Lord Jesus Christ

00:09:40.159 --> 00:09:44.760
as our personal Savior, we're to let His greatness be known.

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:48.719
And one way in which we do that is through the text

00:09:48.719 --> 00:09:50.919
that we have here in Psalm 70 this morning,

00:09:50.919 --> 00:09:53.080
that we're to let God be magnified,

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.559
that we love the salvation that is provided,

00:09:55.559 --> 00:09:58.280
that we're to say continually, let God be magnified,

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.080
that in my life that.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.980
that God would be magnified.

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:05.520
That in your life, God would be magnified.

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:06.520
Because why?

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:08.740
We live in the midst of a people,

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:11.100
we live in the midst of a generation

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:15.340
that they do not know the greatness of our God.

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:17.220
There are many people that have only heard

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:21.880
the name of our Savior used in an inappropriate way.

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:25.240
They don't know how great our God is.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:27.160
There are times in which no doubt you,

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.360
just as I have heard someone use

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:32.280
the name of the Lord in vain and it grieves my heart,

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:34.240
it grieves my spirit, why?

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:36.660
Because that's my Savior.

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:40.840
And do you know how great He is?

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:42.040
He's wonderful.

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:47.020
And as the people of God, we are to magnify our God.

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:51.840
We are to declare His greatness.

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.840
We are to exalt Him.

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:56.200
I want you to notice if you're taking notes this morning,

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.360
just a couple of thoughts.

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:01.880
Number one, a resolve to magnify the Lord.

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:04.800
I use the word resolve on purpose this morning

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:08.840
because this idea of being resolved to do something

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:12.400
is a fixed purpose of mind.

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.040
I like this definition.

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:17.720
It is settled determination.

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:18.860
I am resolved.

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:21.240
A resolve to magnify the Lord.

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:24.320
A settled determination that in my life,

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:25.640
that through my life,

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:29.040
I am going to declare the greatness of God.

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:32.200
I am going to magnify my God.

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:37.240
As we think about this truth of a resolve

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:40.120
to magnify the Lord, I see several examples

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:40.960
in the scripture.

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.940
The first is the resolve of the psalmist.

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:44.320
Notice you're in Psalm 70,

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:47.880
but look back in Psalm 69 in verse number 30.

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:49.720
Notice what the psalmist says here.

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:53.200
Again, another psalm that's attributed to David.

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.560
It says in Psalm 69 in verse number 30,

00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:01.560
I will praise the name of God with a song

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:06.680
and will magnify Him with thanksgiving.

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:10.080
I like the first two words, I will.

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.160
That's resolve.

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.720
That's determination.

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.900
That's settled determination.

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:17.600
That is a fixed purpose of mind.

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:18.880
I will do this.

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:20.600
What does the psalmist say he will do?

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:24.020
I will praise the name of God with a song.

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:27.480
Aren't you thankful that He is worthy of our praise?

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:29.080
And we're to lift up our voice

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.560
and sing praise unto the name of our God

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:32.840
because He is worthy.

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:33.720
And then the psalmist says,

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:37.080
I will magnify Him with thanksgiving.

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:40.200
You know, when you give thanks, you're magnifying God.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:41.040
Why?

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.400
Because you're declaring His greatness.

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:45.320
I'm thanking God for what He's done,

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:47.800
for who He is, and for how He's worked.

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:50.760
And I'm having that thankful spirit,

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:52.720
that thankful attitude,

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:56.200
and in so doing, in giving thanks,

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.780
we're magnifying our God.

00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:02.280
Because we're letting others know how great He is.

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:04.800
We're letting others know what He's done

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.460
and how He's worked.

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:10.280
As the people of God,

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:12.720
we understand that we have been given the command

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:15.680
of offering thanksgiving to our God.

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:17.560
He is worthy of our praise.

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:18.880
In everything, give thanks,

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:22.460
for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:27.320
So many people desire to know the will of God,

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:29.840
and they want to know some specific essence

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:32.280
or aspect of the will of God.

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:34.240
But for many of us this morning,

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:37.000
there is much revealed to us in His Word

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.500
about the universal, if you will,

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:41.640
will of God for His people.

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:44.800
It is God's will that we thank Him.

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:45.800
It's God's will.

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:46.780
Amen?

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:50.140
Notice in Psalm 34, turn back, if you will, in Psalm 34,

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:53.940
another psalm here that's attributed or ascribed to David.

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:56.340
And notice in Psalm 34,

00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:58.700
again, this idea of magnifying the Lord,

00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:02.900
this resolve to magnify the Lord

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:05.860
and how you and I should have this same level of resolve,

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:07.580
this settled determination.

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:11.500
We see again the start of verse number one of Psalm 34,

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:12.680
I will.

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:16.340
Again, this determination, I will bless the Lord.

00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:18.920
Notice when he says, at all times.

00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:22.780
Sometimes we have difficulty with that, don't we?

00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:24.260
At all times.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:25.340
Why has that got to be in there?

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:27.180
Because we're to bless the Lord at all times.

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:28.780
Because God is always good.

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:29.620
Amen?

00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:31.340
There's sometimes that we think that God is good

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:33.140
based on our circumstances.

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:36.280
You hear something happen and God works and God delivers

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:39.200
and God provides and someone says, man, isn't God good?

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:40.180
God's good all the time.

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:41.620
It's His nature.

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:42.460
Amen?

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:43.640
And we find here that He says,

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:45.380
I will bless the Lord at all times.

00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:46.700
And then it says this,

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:51.700
His praise shall continually be in my mouth.

00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:55.820
Continually.

00:14:55.820 --> 00:15:00.460
Not occasionally, but all the time.

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:05.000
We're so filled with who God is.

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:10.180
We've spent so much time in His presence

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:15.140
that His praise shall continually be in my mouth.

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:16.740
Notice what the psalmist says.

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:20.820
My soul shall make her boast in the Lord.

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:24.180
Now remember what he said in verse number five of Psalm 70?

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:26.700
I am poor and needy, right?

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:31.580
And so here he says, I'm gonna make my boast in the Lord.

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:32.420
Why?

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:33.580
Because it's the Lord that gives deliverance.

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:35.260
It's the Lord that works.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:39.500
It's the Lord that provides all that He provides for us.

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:41.740
It says, the humble shall hear thereof and be glad.

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:43.580
Then notice this in verse number three.

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:46.900
Oh, magnify the Lord with me

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:52.180
and let us exalt His name together.

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:57.980
David has a resolve to magnify the Lord in his life,

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:02.940
but then he has a desire to have others come with him

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:04.260
and join in.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:07.140
He says, oh, magnify the Lord with me

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:12.140
and let us exalt His name together,

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:14.940
individually we are to magnify the Lord,

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:18.540
but corporately we're to magnify the Lord.

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:22.140
We are given a responsibility to make Christ known,

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:24.100
to declare His greatness,

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:26.260
and we find that we do that individually

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:27.880
and we do that corporately.

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:33.940
There needs to be a clear sound from our lives individually

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:38.700
and from our church corporately that our God is great

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:42.540
and that we are seeking to magnify, to exalt Him

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:44.100
in all that we say and do.

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:46.980
Notice the resolve of the psalmist.

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:48.980
We notice also the resolve of Mary.

00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:51.740
Turn to the book of Luke, if you will.

00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:53.840
In the first chapter of the book of Luke,

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:56.140
I want you to notice,

00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:00.840
we will not take time to read the entirety

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:03.700
of what Mary says in verses 46

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:05.840
down through verse number 56.

00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:10.640
I want you to see beginning in verse number 46

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:12.220
what Mary says.

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:18.120
In Luke 1 in verse number 46, Mary said,

00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:22.680
my soul doth magnify the Lord

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:29.000
and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Savior.

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:35.120
Notice what she says in verse number 49.

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:40.160
For He that is mighty hath done to me great things

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:45.120
and holy is His name.

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:45.960
Wow.

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:48.800
See, she said in verse number 48

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:52.520
that He hath regarded the lowest state of His handmaiden,

00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:57.360
but He that is mighty hath done to me great things

00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:58.540
and holy is His name.

00:17:58.540 --> 00:17:59.840
You know our God is holy.

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:03.280
And you know He is great.

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:06.640
And He has done for us great things.

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:10.360
And we ought to say, as Mary said in Luke 1 in verse 46,

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:15.360
my soul doth magnify the Lord.

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:16.520
Amen.

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:20.320
Mary didn't, this was not her doing

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:23.140
in carrying the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:27.560
The one that she would carry, God's Son,

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:31.720
we find that it was, she's with child of the Holy Ghost.

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:32.920
Amen.

00:18:33.559 --> 00:18:36.960
And she understands how that He that is mighty

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:38.400
hath done great things.

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:42.559
He hath beheld and regarded the lowest state

00:18:42.559 --> 00:18:44.000
of His handmaiden.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.119
And I'm gonna magnify the Lord.

00:18:47.119 --> 00:18:48.380
Wow.

00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:50.520
He's done great things for us.

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:52.480
Notice what John the Baptist says.

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:56.239
We do not see necessarily the word magnify,

00:18:56.239 --> 00:18:58.020
but in John chapter number three,

00:18:58.020 --> 00:18:59.760
we're familiar with the verse of Scripture.

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:02.580
And it's very interesting because if you would take time

00:19:03.239 --> 00:19:05.100
to look at what's happening in the Gospel of John,

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:06.960
and of course in the first chapter,

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:10.360
you find that John the Baptist is there on the scene.

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:13.860
Of course, it begins by speaking about the deity

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:15.540
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:18.220
And you begin to read about John the Baptist

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:22.179
and the record and the following that John the Baptist had.

00:19:22.179 --> 00:19:25.900
But then you find that as John is there and he says,

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:27.860
as he sees the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:30.119
behold the Lamb of God,

00:19:30.119 --> 00:19:32.360
which taketh away the sin of the world.

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:35.320
And you go through, you begin to see how that Jesus

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:38.600
begins to manifest His glory in chapter number two,

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:40.520
through the first miracle.

00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:42.280
In John chapter number three,

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:45.540
the interaction between Jesus and Nicodemus.

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:47.840
And then you come to verse number 22,

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:52.160
and it says, after these things came Jesus and His disciples

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:53.760
into the land of Judea.

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:56.600
And there he tarried with them and baptized.

00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:58.239
Notice what it says in verse 23.

00:19:58.239 --> 00:20:00.239
And John, this is John the Baptist.

00:20:00.239 --> 00:20:04.079
also was baptizing in Anon near to Salem,

00:20:04.079 --> 00:20:05.719
because there was much water there,

00:20:05.719 --> 00:20:07.879
and they came and were baptized,

00:20:07.879 --> 00:20:10.459
for John was not yet cast into prison.

00:20:10.459 --> 00:20:11.839
But then there arose a question

00:20:11.839 --> 00:20:13.999
between some of John's disciples and the Jews

00:20:13.999 --> 00:20:16.679
about purifying, and they came unto John

00:20:16.679 --> 00:20:20.079
and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee

00:20:20.079 --> 00:20:23.199
beyond Jordan, to whom thou bearest witness,

00:20:23.199 --> 00:20:25.679
behold, the same baptizeth,"

00:20:25.679 --> 00:20:27.999
notice what it says at the end of verse number 26,

00:20:28.039 --> 00:20:31.499
and all men come to him.

00:20:34.319 --> 00:20:36.439
I believe that the enemy's trying to work there

00:20:36.439 --> 00:20:37.559
in John's heart, why?

00:20:37.559 --> 00:20:40.959
Because of a seed of pride, right?

00:20:40.959 --> 00:20:43.319
John had this following.

00:20:43.319 --> 00:20:46.339
He's the forerunner of Jesus Christ.

00:20:47.239 --> 00:20:51.959
He's prophesied of, and we find that they come

00:20:51.959 --> 00:20:55.259
and they say, all men come to him.

00:20:55.259 --> 00:20:57.719
John answered and said, a man can receive nothing

00:20:58.519 --> 00:21:00.619
except it be given him from heaven.

00:21:00.619 --> 00:21:02.999
Ye yourselves bear me witness that I said

00:21:02.999 --> 00:21:06.959
I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.

00:21:06.959 --> 00:21:08.679
John understood who he was,

00:21:08.679 --> 00:21:10.679
and he understood who Jesus was.

00:21:11.579 --> 00:21:14.359
He says in verse number 29, he that hath the bride

00:21:14.359 --> 00:21:16.499
is the bridegroom, but the friend of the bridegroom

00:21:16.499 --> 00:21:19.459
which standeth and heareth him rejoiceth greatly, why?

00:21:19.459 --> 00:21:21.019
Because of the bridegroom's voice,

00:21:21.019 --> 00:21:23.059
this my joy therefore is fulfilled,

00:21:23.059 --> 00:21:26.839
and then notice what he says, he must increase,

00:21:26.899 --> 00:21:29.659
but I must decrease.

00:21:29.659 --> 00:21:31.119
I don't see the word magnify,

00:21:31.119 --> 00:21:34.539
but I see the idea of magnifying the Lord, don't you?

00:21:34.539 --> 00:21:37.659
He must increase, I must decrease.

00:21:37.659 --> 00:21:40.219
It's not about John the Baptist having a following.

00:21:40.219 --> 00:21:43.219
It's not about John the Baptist being exalted

00:21:43.219 --> 00:21:48.219
and having this level of prestige, if you will.

00:21:48.259 --> 00:21:51.659
No, John understood that he's just a forerunner,

00:21:51.659 --> 00:21:56.419
that Jesus is God in flesh, and that he is the Lamb of God

00:21:56.999 --> 00:21:58.359
that would take away the sin of the world,

00:21:58.359 --> 00:22:03.219
and he says he must increase, I must decrease.

00:22:03.219 --> 00:22:04.719
We see the resolve of the psalmist.

00:22:04.719 --> 00:22:06.339
We see the resolve of Mary.

00:22:06.339 --> 00:22:08.199
We see the resolve of John the Baptist.

00:22:08.199 --> 00:22:11.799
Notice with me the resolve of the apostle Paul.

00:22:11.799 --> 00:22:13.299
In Philippians chapter number one,

00:22:13.299 --> 00:22:15.019
we often read verse number 21.

00:22:15.019 --> 00:22:18.159
In fact, many of us this morning could quote Philippians 1

00:22:18.159 --> 00:22:20.799
in verse number 21, for to me to live is Christ

00:22:20.799 --> 00:22:23.599
and to die is gain, but I want you to notice

00:22:23.619 --> 00:22:27.139
what Paul says in Philippians 1 in verse number 20.

00:22:27.139 --> 00:22:29.259
In Philippians 1 in verse number 20,

00:22:29.259 --> 00:22:32.299
I want you to see the desire of the apostle Paul,

00:22:32.299 --> 00:22:37.299
his desire to exalt, to magnify the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:22:38.139 --> 00:22:41.819
It's a resolve that he has, this settled determination,

00:22:41.819 --> 00:22:44.259
this fixed purpose of mind.

00:22:44.259 --> 00:22:47.019
He says this in Philippians 1 in verse number 20.

00:22:47.019 --> 00:22:51.319
According to my earnest expectation and my hope,

00:22:51.339 --> 00:22:53.499
that in nothing I shall be ashamed,

00:22:54.779 --> 00:22:57.939
but that with all boldness, as always,

00:22:57.939 --> 00:23:02.939
so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body,

00:23:04.179 --> 00:23:08.399
whether it be by life or by death,

00:23:08.399 --> 00:23:13.399
for to me to live is Christ and to die is gain.

00:23:13.859 --> 00:23:16.059
But notice the end of verse number 20.

00:23:16.059 --> 00:23:20.739
He says that this, that Christ shall be magnified

00:23:20.759 --> 00:23:25.479
in my body, whether it be by life or by death.

00:23:25.479 --> 00:23:26.599
What's Paul saying?

00:23:26.599 --> 00:23:29.439
I wanna declare the greatness of God.

00:23:29.439 --> 00:23:31.319
Let God be magnified.

00:23:31.319 --> 00:23:34.959
There's this resolve that we see of the psalmist

00:23:34.959 --> 00:23:38.079
and of Mary and of John the Baptist and here of Paul,

00:23:38.079 --> 00:23:40.839
where he says, I desire that God,

00:23:40.839 --> 00:23:45.159
that the Lord Jesus Christ is magnified in my body,

00:23:45.159 --> 00:23:50.119
whether it be by life or by death.

00:23:50.919 --> 00:23:53.959
It's all because of Jesus.

00:23:53.959 --> 00:23:57.239
And it's Christ that must be magnified in our lives.

00:23:57.239 --> 00:23:59.759
And we must have this resolve.

00:23:59.759 --> 00:24:02.479
We must have this settled determination

00:24:02.479 --> 00:24:05.159
that we are going to live our lives in such a way

00:24:05.159 --> 00:24:08.239
that He alone would be magnified.

00:24:08.239 --> 00:24:10.959
Paul, during his first missionary journey,

00:24:12.639 --> 00:24:15.159
they're wrapping it up near the end of the journey

00:24:15.159 --> 00:24:18.359
and they come and God used them to perform great miracles

00:24:18.359 --> 00:24:21.339
and the people of the city are ready to offer

00:24:21.339 --> 00:24:23.660
and really to worship Paul.

00:24:24.699 --> 00:24:26.019
Paul says, no, no, no, no.

00:24:27.099 --> 00:24:31.839
I've come so that you might know the right one to worship,

00:24:31.839 --> 00:24:34.819
so that you might know the true God.

00:24:34.819 --> 00:24:37.759
See, Paul wasn't interested in being worshiped, why?

00:24:37.759 --> 00:24:40.500
Because he was desirous that whether in his life

00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:44.220
or by death, that Christ be magnified.

00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:46.019
It's all about Christ.

00:24:46.019 --> 00:24:47.459
It's all about Christ.

00:24:48.619 --> 00:24:52.259
We see here a resolve to magnify the Lord.

00:24:52.259 --> 00:24:54.139
I think of some results, number two,

00:24:54.139 --> 00:24:57.859
if you're taking notes, some results of magnifying the Lord.

00:24:57.859 --> 00:24:59.419
It's interesting, it really kind of works

00:24:59.419 --> 00:25:01.739
as a cycle, if you will.

00:25:01.739 --> 00:25:04.819
The more I magnify the Lord, the more He's glorified.

00:25:04.819 --> 00:25:08.139
The more I magnify the Lord, the more He's praised

00:25:08.139 --> 00:25:10.459
and through my praise, He's magnified

00:25:10.459 --> 00:25:13.019
and it just kind of keeps ratcheting up and up and up.

00:25:13.019 --> 00:25:14.819
It's really interesting how it works.

00:25:14.819 --> 00:25:16.579
Why, because I'm magnifying Him

00:25:16.599 --> 00:25:20.039
and so His greatness is being made known,

00:25:20.039 --> 00:25:22.279
not only in my life, but for those in which

00:25:22.279 --> 00:25:24.839
would come into contact with me or with you

00:25:24.839 --> 00:25:26.639
and then we praise Him some more.

00:25:26.639 --> 00:25:29.319
Why, because He's worthy and as we're praising Him,

00:25:29.319 --> 00:25:31.720
we're magnifying Him and then we praise Him some more

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:32.919
and we're magnifying Him.

00:25:32.919 --> 00:25:34.799
It's wonderful.

00:25:34.799 --> 00:25:38.179
Listen, this morning, no matter how high of a view

00:25:38.179 --> 00:25:40.720
we have of God, it's not high enough.

00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:46.160
You say, oh, but pastor, I have reached this place

00:25:46.899 --> 00:25:47.739
in my life.

00:25:47.739 --> 00:25:48.699
No, you haven't.

00:25:52.859 --> 00:25:55.259
I've just never understood Him to be as great

00:25:55.259 --> 00:25:57.099
as I understand Him today.

00:25:57.099 --> 00:26:00.319
That's great, but if you keep walking with Him,

00:26:00.319 --> 00:26:02.139
you'll find out tomorrow and next week

00:26:02.139 --> 00:26:04.139
and next month and next year that He's greater

00:26:04.139 --> 00:26:06.259
than you think He is right now.

00:26:06.259 --> 00:26:11.259
Because He's greater, He's higher, He's better,

00:26:11.559 --> 00:26:15.399
He's more lovely, He's wonderful.

00:26:15.399 --> 00:26:19.079
Joy sang that song, Joy Clemon, He's more than wonderful.

00:26:19.079 --> 00:26:23.959
I love that song, because He is so much more.

00:26:23.959 --> 00:26:25.279
You say, well, wonderful's the greatest word

00:26:25.279 --> 00:26:26.119
I can think of.

00:26:26.119 --> 00:26:30.599
I know, because we're just finite and He's infinite.

00:26:31.759 --> 00:26:35.919
My mind cannot fully comprehend the fullness

00:26:36.619 --> 00:26:39.779
and the greatness of my God, and neither can yours.

00:26:39.779 --> 00:26:41.019
You say, well, I have a better mind than you.

00:26:41.019 --> 00:26:46.019
You may, but we cannot fully comprehend

00:26:46.139 --> 00:26:48.299
how great our God is.

00:26:48.299 --> 00:26:49.139
Here's why I know that.

00:26:49.139 --> 00:26:50.539
Here's what the psalmist says.

00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:54.639
He says, I know that the Lord is great.

00:26:55.899 --> 00:26:58.299
And then several chapters later, he says,

00:26:58.299 --> 00:27:01.259
His greatness is unsearchable.

00:27:02.799 --> 00:27:04.899
You say, oh, there's the contradiction in the Bible

00:27:04.899 --> 00:27:05.839
we've been looking for.

00:27:06.679 --> 00:27:08.000
It's not a contradiction at all.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.119
I absolutely know that God is great,

00:27:10.119 --> 00:27:13.160
but His greatness is not fully revealed to us.

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:14.160
It is unsearchable.

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:19.039
I cannot fully comprehend how great my God is.

00:27:19.039 --> 00:27:21.799
And the longer we walk with Him,

00:27:21.799 --> 00:27:26.699
the more we find how great He is.

00:27:26.699 --> 00:27:29.000
In your life, we sang that song this morning,

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.940
since Jesus came into my heart.

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:33.139
Do you remember when you first got saved?

00:27:34.059 --> 00:27:38.660
No doubt this morning, if there's been any length of time

00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:42.339
between your salvation and now where you sit this morning,

00:27:42.339 --> 00:27:45.380
He ought to be greater in your heart than He was then.

00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:48.979
You ought to have a greater understanding of who He is

00:27:48.979 --> 00:27:52.699
and His greatness in your life today than you did then.

00:27:52.699 --> 00:27:53.539
Amen?

00:27:56.099 --> 00:27:59.599
So we find that some of these results of magnifying the Lord

00:27:59.599 --> 00:28:02.500
is that as we magnify Him, He is glorified.

00:28:04.139 --> 00:28:09.139
Let me say this, as we magnify Him, He is made known.

00:28:09.179 --> 00:28:11.179
He is made known.

00:28:11.179 --> 00:28:14.139
See, I mentioned this by way of introduction this morning.

00:28:14.139 --> 00:28:19.139
It is the duty of God's people to make Christ known.

00:28:20.319 --> 00:28:23.139
Then others would know His greatness.

00:28:23.139 --> 00:28:25.339
Notice, if you will, turn over to the book of Psalms

00:28:25.339 --> 00:28:26.660
in Psalm 145.

00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:31.380
We read in Psalm 134 earlier in verse number two,

00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:32.459
when the psalmist said this,

00:28:32.459 --> 00:28:35.940
"'The humble shall hear thereof and be glad.'"

00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:37.539
But I want you to notice what the psalmist says

00:28:37.539 --> 00:28:40.700
in Psalm 145, and then I want you to think about it

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:42.940
in the context of what we read in the book of Joshua

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:45.219
and then into the book of Judges,

00:28:45.219 --> 00:28:48.000
and really as it's revealed to us even in Psalm 78.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.219
But notice here in Psalm 145,

00:28:50.219 --> 00:28:52.279
and I'll try to connect all of those dots here

00:28:52.279 --> 00:28:56.059
in just a few moments, but notice again the resolve,

00:28:56.059 --> 00:28:59.020
the determination of the psalmist in verse number one,

00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:04.020
"'I will extol thee, my God, exalt, to magnify.

00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:09.500
"'O King, and I will bless thy name forever and ever.'"

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:10.940
Notice what he says in verse two,

00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:14.859
"'Every day will I bless thee.'"

00:29:14.859 --> 00:29:15.839
You know why the psalmist could say,

00:29:15.839 --> 00:29:17.260
"'Every day will I bless thee?'

00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:19.659
Because the same psalmist said that he, God,

00:29:19.659 --> 00:29:21.859
daily loatheth us with benefits.

00:29:21.859 --> 00:29:23.659
He understood who God was.

00:29:23.659 --> 00:29:25.700
He said that the psalmist said this,

00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:28.080
that we are to give thanks at the remembrance

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:29.919
of God's holiness.

00:29:29.919 --> 00:29:32.039
And so every day I'm gonna praise God."

00:29:32.039 --> 00:29:32.880
Why?

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:35.640
Because there's always reason to praise him.

00:29:37.739 --> 00:29:39.260
He says, "'Every day will I bless thee,

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:41.399
"'and I will praise thy name forever and ever.

00:29:41.399 --> 00:29:44.119
"'Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised,

00:29:44.119 --> 00:29:47.359
"'and His greatness is unsearchable.'"

00:29:47.359 --> 00:29:49.260
But then notice this in verse number four,

00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:52.459
"'One generation shall praise thy works to another,

00:29:52.459 --> 00:29:54.760
"'and shall declare thy mighty acts.

00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:57.619
"'I will speak of the glorious honor of thy majesty

00:29:57.659 --> 00:29:59.159
"'and of thy wondrous works,

00:29:59.159 --> 00:30:00.459
"'and men shall speak.'"

00:30:00.459 --> 00:30:08.099
of the might of Thy terrible acts, and I will declare Thy greatness."

00:30:08.099 --> 00:30:13.319
The word magnify, it means to declare great, to exalt.

00:30:13.319 --> 00:30:18.299
And so when the psalmist says at the end of verse number six, I will declare Thy greatness,

00:30:18.299 --> 00:30:21.619
he's saying I'm going to magnify Thee, Lord.

00:30:21.619 --> 00:30:23.439
I'm going to declare Thy greatness.

00:30:23.439 --> 00:30:27.659
Notice he says, one generation shall praise Thy works to another.

00:30:27.659 --> 00:30:32.859
We read in the book of Joshua, and you end the book of Joshua where Joshua, under the

00:30:32.859 --> 00:30:38.219
leadership of God and under the instruction of God, he begins to charge, to give charge

00:30:38.219 --> 00:30:40.659
to those that he's leading.

00:30:40.659 --> 00:30:44.019
We read of the charge to the two and a half tribes, and then they depart, but you read

00:30:44.019 --> 00:30:48.079
of the charge not only to the leaders, but then to the people.

00:30:48.079 --> 00:30:54.019
And so often in Joshua 24, we quote where Joshua says, and as for me and my house, we

00:30:54.019 --> 00:30:56.219
will serve the Lord.

00:30:56.219 --> 00:30:59.559
What a great truth.

00:30:59.559 --> 00:31:06.479
But Joshua is calling those that he's led that have seen the mighty hand of God, he's

00:31:06.479 --> 00:31:12.899
calling them to follow the Lord, to make a commitment to serve God.

00:31:12.899 --> 00:31:18.159
You begin to read in the book of Judges, you read how that Joshua and all the elders that

00:31:18.159 --> 00:31:21.039
outlived Joshua, they died.

00:31:21.039 --> 00:31:23.519
And there arose another generation.

00:31:23.519 --> 00:31:29.819
As you read the book of Judges, that generation that rose up, they knew not God.

00:31:29.819 --> 00:31:32.159
They served idols.

00:31:32.159 --> 00:31:36.319
You say, how in the world?

00:31:36.319 --> 00:31:39.719
History just keeps repeating itself.

00:31:39.719 --> 00:31:44.579
Really, history just keeps repeating itself.

00:31:44.579 --> 00:31:52.939
You go back in our nation's history, a hundred years, compared to today, somewhere along

00:31:52.959 --> 00:31:57.959
the line, a generation failed to declare the greatness of God.

00:31:57.959 --> 00:32:01.379
Amen?

00:32:01.379 --> 00:32:06.899
And we find here that the psalmist is saying, I'm going to declare, see, the results or

00:32:06.899 --> 00:32:11.919
some of the results of magnifying the Lord is not only that He's then going to be glorified,

00:32:11.919 --> 00:32:14.199
but He's made known.

00:32:14.199 --> 00:32:17.399
You know, there are some people that we come into contact with that just simply don't know

00:32:17.399 --> 00:32:19.759
who God is.

00:32:19.759 --> 00:32:27.819
They have this preconceived idea, they have this figure in their mind that's been formed

00:32:27.819 --> 00:32:34.619
by who knows what, and some just deny the existence of God entirely, others have this

00:32:34.619 --> 00:32:41.419
idea of who God is by different influences and influencers in their lives.

00:32:41.419 --> 00:32:47.059
But we that know Him are the ones that get to make Him known.

00:32:47.919 --> 00:32:58.739
See, the psalmist said that, let them that love thy salvation say continually, let God

00:32:58.739 --> 00:33:01.739
be magnified.

00:33:01.739 --> 00:33:06.599
Not only as I think about some of the results of magnifying the Lord is it that He would

00:33:06.599 --> 00:33:10.939
be known and really fulfilling the ultimate purpose of our lives, but I want to say this,

00:33:10.939 --> 00:33:15.639
I believe that as we magnify the Lord that we will remain humble.

00:33:15.639 --> 00:33:18.359
That we will remain humble.

00:33:18.359 --> 00:33:24.039
Remember back in Psalm 70 in verse number 5, He said, I am poor and needy.

00:33:24.039 --> 00:33:31.199
And I said this at that point as I was giving the introduction that far too often, unfortunately,

00:33:31.199 --> 00:33:38.599
we face the danger of being prideful and having the attitude of the Laodiceans that we are

00:33:38.599 --> 00:33:43.439
increased with goods and have need of nothing.

00:33:43.439 --> 00:33:49.879
And we find that as we magnify the Lord that it will enable us to remain humble.

00:33:49.879 --> 00:33:54.359
If we would be honest this morning, pride is something that we all face.

00:33:54.359 --> 00:33:58.199
Pride is something that every single one of us face.

00:33:58.199 --> 00:34:04.759
And one way, I believe, one way that we can avoid the danger of pride is to magnify our

00:34:04.759 --> 00:34:05.759
God.

00:34:05.759 --> 00:34:06.759
Why?

00:34:06.759 --> 00:34:08.559
Because we keep lifting Him up.

00:34:08.559 --> 00:34:09.999
We keep exalting Him.

00:34:09.999 --> 00:34:11.479
We keep magnifying Him.

00:34:11.479 --> 00:34:12.759
It's nothing about me.

00:34:12.759 --> 00:34:13.939
It's all about Him.

00:34:13.939 --> 00:34:15.239
There's nothing good in me.

00:34:15.239 --> 00:34:16.799
It's all about Him, right?

00:34:16.799 --> 00:34:22.219
And all of a sudden there's humility because it's not about us.

00:34:22.219 --> 00:34:23.219
It's not about me.

00:34:23.219 --> 00:34:24.219
It's not about you.

00:34:24.219 --> 00:34:26.259
It's about God.

00:34:26.259 --> 00:34:30.439
When the Bible talks about, Jesus says this in Matthew 5, that we're to let our light

00:34:30.439 --> 00:34:33.679
so shine before men that they may see our good works and do what?

00:34:33.679 --> 00:34:38.979
They glorify our Father which is in heaven.

00:34:38.979 --> 00:34:42.799
If we'd be honest this morning, the reality is that sometimes we like the applause of

00:34:42.799 --> 00:34:44.719
man.

00:34:44.719 --> 00:34:48.839
Our pride likes that, right?

00:34:48.839 --> 00:34:51.999
But we have to understand it's all because of Jesus.

00:34:51.999 --> 00:34:53.919
It's all because of Jesus.

00:34:53.919 --> 00:34:54.919
There's nothing...

00:34:54.919 --> 00:34:57.699
I didn't do anything to get saved.

00:34:57.699 --> 00:35:00.519
I don't do anything to keep myself saved.

00:35:00.519 --> 00:35:02.319
I didn't do anything to be called in the ministry.

00:35:02.319 --> 00:35:06.439
And in fact, when He tried to call me in the ministry, I tried to refuse it.

00:35:06.439 --> 00:35:09.719
Just being honest, I can't do that, God.

00:35:09.719 --> 00:35:12.199
It's all about Jesus.

00:35:12.199 --> 00:35:19.679
And as we exalt Him, as we magnify Him, it enables us to remain humble because it's Christ

00:35:19.679 --> 00:35:25.659
in me, the hope of glory.

00:35:25.659 --> 00:35:32.099
We are His workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works, right?

00:35:32.879 --> 00:35:35.019
It's all about Christ.

00:35:35.019 --> 00:35:42.979
See the reality is that no one's going to see an exalted Chris man and say, I need that.

00:35:42.979 --> 00:35:53.399
But if they see an exalted Christ in my life, I want His God, amen?

00:35:53.399 --> 00:35:55.879
Because let me tell you what God has done in my life.

00:35:55.879 --> 00:35:58.299
Let me tell you how God has changed my life.

00:35:58.299 --> 00:35:59.299
Let me tell you...

00:35:59.299 --> 00:36:00.939
And we begin to just magnify God.

00:36:00.939 --> 00:36:03.179
We just begin to declare His greatness.

00:36:03.179 --> 00:36:07.419
We just keep lifting Him up and lifting Him up and exalting Him.

00:36:07.419 --> 00:36:14.179
And all of a sudden, it's not about us, it's all about Him.

00:36:14.179 --> 00:36:20.059
John said, He must increase, I must decrease.

00:36:20.059 --> 00:36:24.379
They said, John, He's baptizing and all men do follow Him.

00:36:24.379 --> 00:36:26.259
Glory to God.

00:36:26.259 --> 00:36:29.219
That's the point, amen?

00:36:29.219 --> 00:36:30.979
That people would follow Jesus.

00:36:30.979 --> 00:36:35.419
I want you to think about those that dealt with pride.

00:36:35.419 --> 00:36:39.419
They failed to exalt the Lord, to magnify Him in their lives.

00:36:39.419 --> 00:36:42.819
I'll use just a couple of examples.

00:36:42.819 --> 00:36:43.819
Think about Saul.

00:36:43.819 --> 00:36:47.859
Turn to 1 Samuel chapter 15.

00:36:47.859 --> 00:36:50.899
And I'm actually going to be preaching from 1 Samuel 15 this evening, but I just want

00:36:50.899 --> 00:36:59.899
to take one verse and be mindful of what is said by Samuel to Saul.

00:36:59.899 --> 00:37:04.739
In the midst of his disobedience here in 1 Samuel 15 and verse number 17, notice what

00:37:04.739 --> 00:37:06.339
Samuel says to him.

00:37:06.339 --> 00:37:09.979
If you're there, 1 Samuel 15 and verse number 17, Samuel said,

00:37:09.979 --> 00:37:16.779
When thou wast little in thine own sight,

00:37:16.779 --> 00:37:22.579
dost thou not make the head of the tribes of Israel, and the Lord anointed the king

00:37:22.579 --> 00:37:23.579
over Israel?

00:37:23.579 --> 00:37:25.459
You know what happened to Saul?

00:37:25.459 --> 00:37:30.899
He wasn't little in his own sight anymore.

00:37:30.899 --> 00:37:35.299
He thought he knew better than God.

00:37:35.299 --> 00:37:38.659
Samuel was very clear, I'll mention this this evening, he was very clear in verses 1 and

00:37:38.659 --> 00:37:41.179
2 that this was the commandment of the Lord.

00:37:41.179 --> 00:37:43.619
This was God's instruction to Saul.

00:37:43.619 --> 00:37:46.479
But Saul disobeyed it.

00:37:46.479 --> 00:37:52.799
And Samuel says, when you were little in your own sight, oh, that God would help us

00:37:52.799 --> 00:37:56.799
to remain little in our own sight, that we're nothing.

00:37:56.799 --> 00:38:02.799
You say, that's not good for my self-esteem, I know.

00:38:02.799 --> 00:38:06.199
But it's true, we're nothing.

00:38:06.199 --> 00:38:09.359
It's all because of God's amazing grace.

00:38:09.359 --> 00:38:12.399
It's all because of Jesus.

00:38:12.399 --> 00:38:16.879
Jesus, Uzziah, 2 Chronicles 26.

00:38:16.879 --> 00:38:24.799
You're familiar with these examples, but I want you to see what the Word of God says.

00:38:24.799 --> 00:38:32.079
It's amazing how God helped King Uzziah.

00:38:32.079 --> 00:38:40.999
The Bible tells us in verse number 5 that he sought God in the days of Zechariah.

00:38:40.999 --> 00:38:44.999
It tells us at the end of verse number 5 that as long as he sought the Lord, God made

00:38:44.999 --> 00:38:47.039
him to prosper.

00:38:47.039 --> 00:38:54.919
Man, verse number 5 is so important of a verse, principle of life.

00:38:54.919 --> 00:39:00.759
We'd seek God, and then as we keep seeking God, God will keep blessing.

00:39:00.759 --> 00:39:08.639
Listen, there's more danger in times of blessing than in times of want, times of distress and

00:39:08.639 --> 00:39:10.399
difficulty.

00:39:10.399 --> 00:39:16.919
Because in times of blessing, if we're not careful, we just get full of ourselves.

00:39:16.919 --> 00:39:23.919
We become like the church of the Laodiceans, increased with goods and have need of nothing.

00:39:23.919 --> 00:39:28.439
The Bible tells us in verse number 7, notice the first phrase, and God helped him.

00:39:28.439 --> 00:39:34.239
Notice in verse number 8, the last phrase, for he strengthened himself exceedingly.

00:39:34.239 --> 00:39:40.319
Verse number 15, it says, and he made in Jerusalem engines invented by cunning men to be on the

00:39:40.319 --> 00:39:44.519
towers and upon the bulwarks to shoot arrows and great stones withal.

00:39:44.519 --> 00:39:53.319
And his name spread far abroad, for he was marvelously helped, but it's a comma.

00:39:53.319 --> 00:40:00.039
I wish it was a period, but it's a comma, till he was.

00:40:00.039 --> 00:40:03.079
Strong.

00:40:03.079 --> 00:40:09.999
Verse 16, but when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to what?

00:40:09.999 --> 00:40:10.999
His destruction.

00:40:10.999 --> 00:40:13.879
Well, you know what happens to you, Zion?

00:40:13.879 --> 00:40:16.479
Becomes a leper.

00:40:16.479 --> 00:40:17.479
His heart was lifted up.

00:40:17.479 --> 00:40:18.479
What is that?

00:40:18.479 --> 00:40:19.479
That's pride.

00:40:19.479 --> 00:40:20.479
Right?

00:40:20.479 --> 00:40:23.279
How do we avoid pride?

00:40:23.279 --> 00:40:25.319
How do we avoid the danger of pride?

00:40:25.319 --> 00:40:29.519
I believe that one way is by magnifying the Lord.

00:40:29.519 --> 00:40:31.199
Look at what God has done.

00:40:31.199 --> 00:40:32.679
Look at how God is working.

00:40:32.679 --> 00:40:35.679
Look at how God is interceding.

00:40:35.679 --> 00:40:36.959
Look at God.

00:40:36.959 --> 00:40:38.559
Don't look at Uzziah.

00:40:38.559 --> 00:40:40.479
Don't look at what we've done.

00:40:40.479 --> 00:40:41.919
Don't look at what's been built.

00:40:41.919 --> 00:40:46.959
It's God that has enabled us.

00:40:46.959 --> 00:40:50.239
And maybe Uzziah would have never went in there and tried to offer the incense.

00:40:50.239 --> 00:40:54.799
Maybe Uzziah never would have become a leper.

00:40:54.799 --> 00:41:01.599
But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his destruction.

00:41:01.599 --> 00:41:06.119
In a positive sense, I want you to think about the Apostle Paul.

00:41:06.119 --> 00:41:10.559
In 2 Corinthians chapter number 12, we're familiar with the text of Scripture, and oftentimes

00:41:10.559 --> 00:41:14.239
we reference the ninth verse, my grace is sufficient for thee.

00:41:14.239 --> 00:41:18.959
But I want you to see some of what happens here in 2 Corinthians chapter number 12.

00:41:18.959 --> 00:41:24.179
Paul is speaking about, in 2 Corinthians chapter number 12, the visions and all that he had.

00:41:24.179 --> 00:41:29.459
He says of this in verse number 5, of such in one will I glory, yet of myself I will

00:41:29.459 --> 00:41:32.219
not glory, but in mine infirmities.

00:41:32.219 --> 00:41:35.539
Verse 6, for though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool, for I will say the

00:41:35.539 --> 00:41:36.579
truth.

00:41:36.579 --> 00:41:42.379
But now I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be,

00:41:42.379 --> 00:41:44.739
or that he heareth of me.

00:41:44.739 --> 00:41:51.459
He says this, unless I should be exalted above measure, notice this phrase, through the abundance

00:41:51.459 --> 00:41:53.419
of the revelations.

00:41:53.419 --> 00:41:57.579
You know, for many of us this morning, when we think about the Apostle Paul, when we reference

00:41:57.579 --> 00:42:01.379
the Apostle Paul, there are times in which we'll use this phraseology, he's the greatest

00:42:01.379 --> 00:42:03.379
Christian that ever lived.

00:42:03.379 --> 00:42:09.499
I've heard it many times, I've probably said it, but you know what Paul says of himself?

00:42:09.499 --> 00:42:14.619
I'm the chief of sinners.

00:42:14.619 --> 00:42:19.899
This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the

00:42:19.899 --> 00:42:25.339
world to save sinners, of whom I am chief.

00:42:25.339 --> 00:42:30.299
That's what Paul says.

00:42:30.299 --> 00:42:34.579
Paul understood that it was all about Jesus.

00:42:34.579 --> 00:42:45.299
He understood that he was on a road of religion, and he was going to die and spend eternity

00:42:45.299 --> 00:42:47.899
in a Christless eternity, separated from God.

00:42:47.899 --> 00:42:48.899
Why?

00:42:48.899 --> 00:42:51.659
Because he couldn't save them.

00:42:51.659 --> 00:42:53.379
He had zeal.

00:42:53.379 --> 00:42:57.459
He was lost.

00:42:57.459 --> 00:43:00.459
And God revealed Himself to him.

00:43:00.459 --> 00:43:03.819
And every time Paul had an opportunity to stand before people, you know what he did?

00:43:03.819 --> 00:43:05.939
He magnified the Lord.

00:43:05.939 --> 00:43:07.779
Let me tell you what Jesus did.

00:43:07.779 --> 00:43:09.939
Let me tell you how He changed my life.

00:43:09.939 --> 00:43:12.139
Let me tell you how I got saved.

00:43:12.139 --> 00:43:17.579
Remember that truth of Philippians 1 and verse number 20, that Christ would be magnified

00:43:17.579 --> 00:43:22.699
in my life, whether by life or by death.

00:43:22.699 --> 00:43:27.059
Paul says, lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations.

00:43:27.059 --> 00:43:33.339
Listen, we don't have the same kind of revelations that Paul is speaking of here today.

00:43:33.339 --> 00:43:39.819
But can I tell you, at times, sometimes we can be lifted up because of what we know.

00:43:39.819 --> 00:43:46.899
Sometimes we can think we're better than somebody else because of what we know.

00:43:46.899 --> 00:43:51.779
Being saved really doesn't make me better, it just makes me blessed.

00:43:51.779 --> 00:43:55.739
I mean, I'm going to a better place.

00:43:55.739 --> 00:43:57.879
I am blessed.

00:43:57.879 --> 00:44:01.579
I didn't do anything to get saved.

00:44:01.579 --> 00:44:05.279
I heard the gospel and I believed it.

00:44:05.279 --> 00:44:09.199
But I had nothing to do with hearing the gospel.

00:44:09.199 --> 00:44:16.299
There was nothing I could do to orchestrate a man going by, sharing the gospel as my dad

00:44:16.699 --> 00:44:23.339
walked by, to overhear the gospel being presented, nothing I could do.

00:44:23.339 --> 00:44:26.139
And for many of you this morning, there's nothing you could do to have orchestrated

00:44:26.139 --> 00:44:27.139
you hearing the gospel.

00:44:27.139 --> 00:44:29.539
It is the grace of God.

00:44:29.539 --> 00:44:30.619
So I was born in a Christian home.

00:44:30.619 --> 00:44:36.379
Well, think about your parents and how somewhere, parents, grandparents, great-grandparents,

00:44:36.379 --> 00:44:41.739
somewhere along the line, the gospel came into your family and it was nothing to do

00:44:41.739 --> 00:44:43.059
with you.

00:44:43.059 --> 00:44:45.499
It's all because of God's grace.

00:44:45.499 --> 00:44:54.079
And Paul says, because of this, lest I should be exalted above measure, through the abundance

00:44:54.079 --> 00:44:59.459
of the revelations, notice what he says, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the

00:44:59.459 --> 00:45:05.939
messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.

00:45:05.939 --> 00:45:10.419
Paul acknowledged that it was this thing that God would use.

00:45:10.419 --> 00:45:14.059
Of course, he says that he prayed that God would deliver him, that it would depart from

00:45:14.059 --> 00:45:18.219
him, and God says, my grace is sufficient for thee, for my strength is made perfect

00:45:18.219 --> 00:45:19.459
in weakness.

00:45:19.459 --> 00:45:23.259
And then Paul then says, most gladly, therefore, will I rather glory in my infirmities that

00:45:23.259 --> 00:45:25.299
the power of Christ may rest upon me.

00:45:25.299 --> 00:45:26.299
Why?

00:45:26.299 --> 00:45:29.299
So that Christ would be magnified.

00:45:29.299 --> 00:45:33.059
He said, listen, I could have been, because of what's happened, I could have been exalted

00:45:33.059 --> 00:45:34.979
above measure.

00:45:34.979 --> 00:45:37.699
But isn't God so gracious on keeping us humble?

00:45:38.699 --> 00:45:43.619
And see, this morning, Paul says not only did he want to remain humble, we see that

00:45:43.619 --> 00:45:48.299
in Acts chapter number 20, but he says here in verse number 6, lest that any man should

00:45:48.299 --> 00:45:55.939
think of me above that which he seeth me to be, or that he heareth of me.

00:45:55.939 --> 00:45:59.699
Sometimes we might understand this thing of pride and humility, and we might work to be

00:45:59.699 --> 00:46:06.319
humble, but I'm perfectly okay with Armando thinking really highly of me.

00:46:06.319 --> 00:46:10.639
And I kind of take my pride that way, right?

00:46:10.639 --> 00:46:16.639
No, no, Armando, it's God's work in my life.

00:46:16.639 --> 00:46:19.299
It's all because of God's grace.

00:46:19.299 --> 00:46:21.839
It's all because of God's mercy.

00:46:21.839 --> 00:46:24.199
Let God be magnified.

00:46:24.199 --> 00:46:31.839
And as I continually magnify Him, as I continually exalt Him, yes, He's glorified.

00:46:31.839 --> 00:46:36.519
And the more He's glorified, the more He's magnified, and it's amazing how it ratchets

00:46:36.519 --> 00:46:37.519
up.

00:46:37.519 --> 00:46:41.679
And then we come to a place where Christ is being made known, because it's all about Christ

00:46:41.679 --> 00:46:44.919
in my life and your life, individually and corporately.

00:46:44.919 --> 00:46:49.879
It's about magnifying Christ, and it helps us to stay humble.

00:46:49.879 --> 00:46:52.159
My feet stay on the ground, why?

00:46:52.159 --> 00:46:54.279
Because it's all about Jesus.

00:46:54.279 --> 00:46:57.779
It's all about Jesus.

00:46:57.779 --> 00:47:02.939
This morning, I hope that we'd have a resolve to magnify the Lord.

00:47:02.939 --> 00:47:07.939
I hope that when we see the resolve of the psalmist and of Mary and of John the Baptist

00:47:07.939 --> 00:47:14.939
and of Paul, that we'd say, I want to have that settled determination that in my life,

00:47:14.939 --> 00:47:17.279
let God be magnified.

00:47:17.279 --> 00:47:21.779
I'm poor and needy, but He's wonderful.

00:47:21.779 --> 00:47:24.059
He's more than wonderful.

00:47:24.059 --> 00:47:25.419
He's my God.

00:47:25.419 --> 00:47:27.659
And let me tell you what He's done for me.

00:47:27.659 --> 00:47:29.699
Let God be magnified.

00:47:29.699 --> 00:47:31.579
Father, we love You.

00:47:31.579 --> 00:47:32.919
We thank You for loving us.

00:47:32.919 --> 00:47:35.819
We thank You for the Word of God.

00:47:35.819 --> 00:47:39.379
I thank You for the examples of Scripture.

00:47:39.379 --> 00:47:45.859
I pray this morning that You'd help us in our lives to magnify You, to declare Your

00:47:45.859 --> 00:47:46.859
greatness.

00:47:46.859 --> 00:48:00.779
Oh, that we'd have a resolve, a settled determination, this purpose of mind that whether by life

00:48:00.779 --> 00:48:06.819
or by death, that Christ would be magnified.

00:48:06.819 --> 00:48:12.339
Help us to deal with pride.

00:48:12.339 --> 00:48:20.139
Help us as we magnify Your name individually and corporately to make You known.

00:48:20.139 --> 00:48:32.019
I pray this morning that we'd make the determination that in my life, with Your help, I'm going

00:48:32.019 --> 00:48:34.419
to let God be magnified.

00:48:34.419 --> 00:48:41.380
And God, I pray that as we do so, that You would enable us and strengthen us.

00:48:41.380 --> 00:48:46.859
God, that Your name would be glorified.

00:48:46.859 --> 00:48:52.059
I pray that You'd move and work in this time of invitation as only You can.

00:48:52.059 --> 00:48:56.019
Help us to simply stand in awe of who You are.

00:48:56.019 --> 00:49:00.019
Well, thank You for the work that You'll do, for it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:49:00.019 --> 00:49:01.579
Would You stand with me?

00:49:01.579 --> 00:49:02.659
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

00:49:02.899 --> 00:49:05.339
Maybe Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano.

00:49:05.339 --> 00:49:08.820
Maybe you want to come this morning and make a commitment to the Lord.

00:49:08.820 --> 00:49:13.699
I am resolved to magnify the Lord.

00:49:13.699 --> 00:49:16.059
I'm poor and needy.

00:49:16.059 --> 00:49:22.940
God's so wonderful and I need to declare His greatness at every opportunity.

00:49:22.940 --> 00:49:26.139
I want to magnify the Lord in my life.

00:49:26.139 --> 00:49:29.859
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.

00:49:29.859 --> 00:49:32.059
Let God be magnified.
