1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,279
Genesis chapter number 15, and we have been studying

2
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:06,139
through the book of Genesis for quite a while.

3
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:08,960
I don't know exactly how long I could look in my notes

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,640
and tell you, this is lesson 43, I know that.

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,920
And the very first lesson that we had,

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,279
if I scroll through my notes here,

7
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:18,479
was back on March 10th, 2019.

8
00:00:18,479 --> 00:00:20,760
And so we've been going through the book of Genesis,

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,620
making progress as we've gone through.

10
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:26,440
Of course, we haven't been every single Sunday evening

11
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,440
in the book of Genesis.

12
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,100
We've taken a few off, but we'll finish up

13
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,540
chapter number 15 this evening.

14
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,400
And if you think about the 15th chapter

15
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,159
of the book of Genesis, you find that there's really

16
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:40,759
a continuation of a dialogue, a meeting,

17
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:45,240
that God gives us a record of between the Lord and Abram.

18
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,759
And we find that as we really focused upon the first verse

19
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:50,720
in our first study of Genesis 15,

20
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,400
and really the way in which Abram was greeted by the Lord

21
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,220
and God told him to fear not.

22
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:00,220
And he said, I am thy shield, thy exceeding great reward.

23
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:03,020
Last Sunday evening, we looked at verses two through six.

24
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:05,739
And in that text of scripture, we dealt with the fact

25
00:01:05,739 --> 00:01:08,660
that Abram comes to the Lord and says to me,

26
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:10,220
thou hast given no seed.

27
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:13,900
And of course, we find that God begins to provide

28
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:18,220
a record to Abram and Abram's perspective is revealed to us

29
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:19,620
as he says, here's the problem,

30
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,980
here's a potential solution, Eleazar,

31
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:23,660
one that's born in mine house.

32
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,139
And God says, no, and he gives him

33
00:01:25,139 --> 00:01:28,339
very specific instruction with regard to the promise.

34
00:01:28,339 --> 00:01:29,980
And that explanation is provided,

35
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,739
and of course, the promise is embraced.

36
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:34,860
As we continue to move through the 15th chapter

37
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,900
of the book of Genesis, really,

38
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,620
we are given further insight detail

39
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,739
with regard to the Abrahamic covenant

40
00:01:41,739 --> 00:01:43,559
as we'd often refer to it.

41
00:01:43,559 --> 00:01:48,260
And we find that here in this passage of scripture,

42
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,519
there's some time that lapsed, not much,

43
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:52,739
but we do see the days that go on.

44
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:54,519
You'll recall from our study last week

45
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:56,400
that it was in verse number five,

46
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,639
as the Lord is giving the promise to Abram,

47
00:01:59,639 --> 00:02:02,000
he brings him out and he says, look up toward heaven.

48
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,800
And he tells him to look at the stars.

49
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,239
And so we see it would be evening,

50
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:08,600
he's looking at the stars and we made note of those things.

51
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,139
And of course, God gives them the promise

52
00:02:11,139 --> 00:02:12,720
with regard to his seed.

53
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,639
And then we find in verse number 12,

54
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:16,600
the Bible says when the sun was going down.

55
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,919
And so there's another day that is unfolding here

56
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:22,279
throughout this process, this dialogue,

57
00:02:22,279 --> 00:02:23,960
this meeting, if you will.

58
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,440
And this conversation will continue.

59
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,839
And as we look at the passage,

60
00:02:27,839 --> 00:02:30,279
I want you to notice the statement in verse number 18,

61
00:02:30,279 --> 00:02:32,160
where the Bible says on the same day,

62
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,080
the Lord made a covenant with Abram.

63
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,020
And so I've titled the message this evening,

64
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,199
the Lord made a covenant with Abram.

65
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,479
We'll be looking at verses seven

66
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:42,160
down through verse number 21.

67
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,320
And as we dig into the passage this evening,

68
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,600
I want you to notice with me first of all,

69
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,080
what is requested.

70
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,600
Notice what is requested as we begin to look at this passage

71
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,440
and we see how that in verse number one,

72
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,899
God comes and this message is given to Abram in a vision.

73
00:02:57,899 --> 00:03:01,440
And then Abram speaks to God and God responds to Abram

74
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,940
and so on and so forth.

75
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,600
And we find that in verse number six,

76
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,880
that as we finished up last week,

77
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,160
it says he believed in the Lord

78
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,720
and he counted it to him for righteousness.

79
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,759
That was of utmost importance as we looked at that verse

80
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:18,759
and seeing the faith of Abram

81
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:21,360
and believing what God said would come to pass.

82
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:23,679
And we find in verse number seven, it says,

83
00:03:23,679 --> 00:03:26,000
and he said unto him,

84
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,759
I am the Lord that brought thee out of the Ur of the Chaldees

85
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:34,240
to give thee this land to inherit it.

86
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,240
And so we find that God is now speaking to Abram again

87
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,559
in verse number seven.

88
00:03:38,559 --> 00:03:39,960
And he tells him, it's interesting.

89
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,880
He says, I am the Lord that brought thee

90
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,199
out of the Ur of the Chaldees.

91
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:46,399
And so we'd go all the way back to chapter number 11 and 12

92
00:03:46,399 --> 00:03:50,119
and begin to see that call of Abram that God extends

93
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:53,000
and how Abram would leave the Ur of the Chaldees

94
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,679
and he would go on this journey, of course,

95
00:03:54,679 --> 00:03:56,839
eventually coming to the place

96
00:03:56,839 --> 00:03:59,240
where God had told him to travel to.

97
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,440
And we find that he's saying,

98
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,440
I am the Lord that brought thee out of the Ur of the Chaldees

99
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,160
to give thee this land to inherit it.

100
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,919
So as we look at the passage of scripture

101
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:11,479
and we've understood over the last several chapters

102
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:14,119
of studying the life of Abram,

103
00:04:14,119 --> 00:04:17,079
that the promise to Abram really is twofold.

104
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:19,399
There's the aspect of the seed

105
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,279
and there's the aspect of the land.

106
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:25,000
Last week, we really focused upon

107
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,519
the seed portion of the promise.

108
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:31,959
This evening, we'll see that the focus now will shift

109
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:35,000
and not so much be with regard to the seed

110
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,839
as much as it is with regard to the land.

111
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:39,399
We see that in verse number seven

112
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:41,799
where God ends that verse of scripture by saying,

113
00:04:41,799 --> 00:04:46,440
to give thee this land to inherit it.

114
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,559
And he said unto him, excuse me,

115
00:04:49,559 --> 00:04:50,600
go back to verse number eight.

116
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,119
And he said, this is now Abram talking to the Lord.

117
00:04:54,119 --> 00:04:57,839
He says, Lord God, whereby shall I know

118
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,799
that I shall inherit it?

119
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,359
And so this is what we find

120
00:05:01,359 --> 00:05:03,799
when we notice what is requested in verse number eight,

121
00:05:03,799 --> 00:05:06,200
Abram is requesting a sign.

122
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,519
He is requesting, he says,

123
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:10,320
he hears what God says to thee this land

124
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,679
or to give thee this land to inherit it.

125
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:16,000
And in verse number eight, Abram is saying to the Lord,

126
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,600
whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?

127
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,760
Now it's interesting because when we're speaking

128
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,320
about the seed in our previous message,

129
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,200
we find that Abram comes and he says,

130
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,720
you've not given me any seed.

131
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,880
I understand this promise that's been given.

132
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,279
I have no seed.

133
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:33,640
Lo, one born in my house is mine heir.

134
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,720
And what does God do?

135
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,480
God says, no, that's not the way it's going to work.

136
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,839
He tells him in verse number four,

137
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,799
this shall not be thine heir,

138
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:43,079
but he that shall come forth out of thine own bow

139
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:44,279
shall be thine heir.

140
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:45,440
And then what does God do?

141
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:49,880
He gives him a, it really goes and gives him this picture

142
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,880
of let's go out, look toward the heavens, see the stars.

143
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,320
And so as God would give him and tell him

144
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,760
to look to the stars, if thou be able to number them,

145
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:04,119
and he said unto him, so shall thy seed be.

146
00:06:04,119 --> 00:06:06,980
And so now the same God is saying to Abram,

147
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,399
by the way, I've brought you out of the earthy Caldes

148
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:10,959
to give you this land.

149
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:13,359
And Abram saying, okay, what is the sign

150
00:06:13,359 --> 00:06:16,359
with regard to the inheritance of the land?

151
00:06:16,359 --> 00:06:18,279
And so he's requesting this sign.

152
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:20,839
It is interesting as we find that Paul is writing

153
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,320
to the believers in Corinth.

154
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,279
And in first Corinthians one and verse 22,

155
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:26,920
he says that the Jews require a sign.

156
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,160
And that's interesting as it would go all the way back

157
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,920
even to Abram and asking the Lord

158
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,040
in this very passage of scripture, of course,

159
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,399
many times the Hebrews, Jewish folks,

160
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:39,880
Father Abraham, and they understand their ancestry

161
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,000
and so on and so forth.

162
00:06:41,119 --> 00:06:44,720
And we find that he's asking, he's requesting this sign.

163
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,239
He says, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?

164
00:06:48,239 --> 00:06:49,959
And so we notice what is requested.

165
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:52,320
I now want you to notice what is required.

166
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:56,519
In verses nine through 11, God is going to give

167
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:59,079
some specific requirements to Abram,

168
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:00,279
specifically in verse number nine.

169
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:02,839
And we see how Abram will respond

170
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,000
to that which is required.

171
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,799
In verse number nine, God said to Abram,

172
00:07:07,799 --> 00:07:09,519
it says, and he said unto him,

173
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:12,119
take me an heifer of three years old

174
00:07:12,119 --> 00:07:14,160
and a she goat of three years old

175
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,799
and a ram of three years old

176
00:07:15,799 --> 00:07:18,920
and a turtle dove and a young pigeon.

177
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,959
It is interesting as we look at verse number nine

178
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:23,559
and we begin to consider this evening what is required

179
00:07:23,559 --> 00:07:27,359
when this request is made by Abram

180
00:07:27,359 --> 00:07:29,359
with regard to this sign.

181
00:07:29,359 --> 00:07:30,839
What is it that you'll give me

182
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:33,839
that I know that I shall inherit the land?

183
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:37,519
God gives him some very detailed instruction.

184
00:07:37,559 --> 00:07:40,239
He tells him to get an heifer of three years,

185
00:07:40,239 --> 00:07:43,119
a she goat of three years, a ram of three years,

186
00:07:43,119 --> 00:07:45,679
a turtle dove and a young pigeon.

187
00:07:45,679 --> 00:07:47,959
And very detailed, very specific.

188
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:51,200
Our God is a God of order in detail.

189
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,760
And we find that throughout the whole of scripture.

190
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,720
And we find that the action of Abram

191
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,200
in verse number 10 is immediate obedience.

192
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,839
We see the detailed instruction

193
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:04,040
followed by the detailed action

194
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,000
where the Bible says this in verse number 10,

195
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,279
and he took unto him all these.

196
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:11,600
Aren't you thankful for the obedience

197
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,720
that we read of in the life of Abram?

198
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:18,440
Our God, we understand as we study the scriptures,

199
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:22,399
there is a principle of obedience throughout the word of God

200
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:24,760
in that our God blesses obedience.

201
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,839
And we find here that Abram did

202
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,679
as the Lord had commanded him.

203
00:08:28,679 --> 00:08:30,519
He took unto him all these.

204
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:32,719
Notice it was not partial obedience.

205
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,039
He did not say, well, this will work

206
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,359
or I could do it this way.

207
00:08:37,359 --> 00:08:40,320
No, Abram gets the detailed instruction.

208
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,400
And we find that there's detailed action

209
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,840
on the part of Abram, this immediate obedience.

210
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,039
It says this, that he divided them in the midst

211
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:51,239
and laid each piece one against another,

212
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:53,880
but the birds he divided he not.

213
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,000
And so in your mind's eye,

214
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,559
you can see there's some land here.

215
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:00,280
He takes these animals with the heifer,

216
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,359
the she goat and the ram.

217
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,880
He divides them in half.

218
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,760
He lays one over here aside from each other.

219
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,719
So as he divides the heifer half here, half here,

220
00:09:08,719 --> 00:09:11,159
so on and so forth with the she goat and the ram,

221
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:13,840
the turtle dove and the young pigeon, he did not divide.

222
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,400
Now, the significance of this

223
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,880
is that this was a common custom of the day

224
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,280
for those making a covenant.

225
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,640
It's not something that we're accustomed to

226
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,359
as believers living in 2020.

227
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:29,119
You've made some agreements with people

228
00:09:29,119 --> 00:09:31,919
and I'm guessing you probably never divided some animals

229
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:34,599
and put them apart from one another and so on and so forth.

230
00:09:34,599 --> 00:09:37,599
And so we have different means in which we make covenants

231
00:09:37,599 --> 00:09:39,640
or agreements one with another today,

232
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:44,159
but this was a very custom, common custom,

233
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:46,239
excuse me, during this particular era.

234
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:49,200
And we find what would happen is the parties

235
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,479
that are making this agreement or this covenant,

236
00:09:51,479 --> 00:09:55,000
the two parties, they would pass in between

237
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,919
those divided animals and as they would pass in between

238
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:01,119
what they were doing is.

239
00:10:01,119 --> 00:10:06,479
symbolically, they were saying this is the fate of either party that would

240
00:10:06,479 --> 00:10:10,439
break the covenant. In other words, if I make a covenant with you, we go through

241
00:10:10,439 --> 00:10:17,199
this common practice, this custom, we go through, we walk through these divided

242
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:22,999
animals. If I then break the covenant, I'm to be cut asunder. That's basically what

243
00:10:22,999 --> 00:10:28,119
is being communicated. And so we find that this was a common custom, and it's

244
00:10:28,119 --> 00:10:31,999
important that we understand that because as we look at the passage of

245
00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:37,279
Scripture and we understand the era in which this is happening, we understand

246
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:41,959
the custom, and then we understand actually what happens in just a few

247
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:46,559
verses in the significance of the covenant based upon the action that is

248
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:50,199
taken. And so it's very important that we understand that. Notice in verse number

249
00:10:50,199 --> 00:10:55,519
11, the Bible says this, and when the fowls came down upon the carcasses,

250
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:02,159
Abram drove them away. And so this was a long process. We find that the Bible says

251
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:06,799
in verse 12, when the sun was going down, and so from the time in which Abram would

252
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:12,159
cut asunder these animals and place them out, no doubt those

253
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:17,559
birds, the scavenger fowls, they would come down and try to eat upon that which

254
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:22,119
had been divided, and Abram would spend the majority of that day driving

255
00:11:22,119 --> 00:11:28,079
away those fowls, as the Bible tells us there in verse number 11. As we look here

256
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:32,679
at what's taking place, it's important that we, again, understand the detail in

257
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:38,079
which God is giving us. And we find that this man, Abram, makes this request and

258
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:42,839
then God gives this requirement. The significance of those two

259
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:47,399
things that are mentioned in the beginning of this passage really begin

260
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:53,959
to unfold in an amazing way as we look at the latter portion of Genesis 15. We look

261
00:11:53,959 --> 00:11:58,279
at verses 12 through 21, and I would say this, as we've noticed what's requested

262
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:02,679
and required, we now will notice what is revealed. And this is the bulk of the

263
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:07,279
message this evening, as we see the significance of that which God would

264
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:12,440
reveal to Abram during this particular time, and of course being recorded for us

265
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:17,119
in the Word of God, so that we'd understand this Abrahamic covenant.

266
00:12:17,119 --> 00:12:22,199
These details are provided to Abram. Notice it says in verse number 12,

267
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:25,879
"...and when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram, and lo and horror

268
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:31,199
of great darkness fell upon him. And he," God, of course, is the he that is being

269
00:12:31,199 --> 00:12:36,399
referred to, "...said unto Abram." Now, notice as we look at these verses of

270
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:41,720
Scripture, and we consider that which will be revealed to Abram, we see first

271
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:46,440
of all that God will reveal some truth with regard to the events that

272
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:52,159
would lead to the possession of the land. It goes back to what God said in verse

273
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:58,599
number 7, "...to give thee this land to inherit it." And right, so we find that the

274
00:12:58,599 --> 00:13:03,559
the context of what we're dealing with is God has said to Abram, I'm gonna give

275
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:07,360
you this land. Abram says, what is the sign that you're going to give me that I

276
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:13,039
know this? And God is going to lay out the details in these verses of Scripture

277
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:18,399
with regard to his plan. It reveals to us some amazing things with regard to our

278
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,799
God. He's omniscient. He knows all things. He's eternal. He knows the end from the

279
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:27,279
beginning. He's going to speak to Abram in these verses of Scripture, just a few

280
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:32,679
verses. He's gonna speak to him about events that would take place centuries

281
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:38,879
later, and he deals with them in detail. Why? Because our God is eternal. He is

282
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:43,879
Alpha and Omega, the the beginning and the end, the first and the last. And so we

283
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:48,720
find here that God begins, as he's gonna speak to Abram in verse number 13, notice

284
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:54,479
what he says, "...know of a surety." Now it's interesting, as we study the Word of

285
00:13:54,479 --> 00:13:58,039
God, we understand that God wants us to know some things. He wants us to be aware

286
00:13:58,199 --> 00:14:03,399
of what his plan is. He wants us to have confidence in what he has said. We looked

287
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:07,000
at it this morning as we were studying there in 2 Chronicles, in the life of

288
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,239
Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, and that great event that is recorded in chapter

289
00:14:11,239 --> 00:14:15,799
number 20 with regard to the coalition and all of those things, and how that

290
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:21,320
Jehoshaphat was aware of what God had promised, what God had said, and in simple

291
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:26,839
faith he believed God. See, God wanted Jehoshaphat and others to know what he

292
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:31,799
had told Solomon years earlier, and he's given us his Word this evening, and

293
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:36,119
throughout the Scriptures we understand that God has said that there are some

294
00:14:36,119 --> 00:14:40,479
things that we need to know, that we can have confidence in, that we can be sure

295
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:46,199
of. Notice what it says, "...know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a

296
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:50,160
land that is not theirs." Now it's interesting because now we begin to see

297
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:55,479
the reference to the seed and also to the land. Remember as we dealt with the

298
00:14:55,479 --> 00:15:00,160
seed last week, the first aspect of this promise that had been given to Abram,

299
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:05,279
that he gives them the details with regard to the seed, and we followed that

300
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,399
throughout the New Testament, the book of Galatians specifically, and now in

301
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:14,959
answering the question with regard to the land, God says to Abram that, "...thy seed

302
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:20,479
shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them, and they

303
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:25,199
shall afflict them four hundred years." And so here, as we begin to think about

304
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:30,079
the events that would lead to the possession of the land, God in Genesis

305
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:35,440
chapter number 15 is giving truth to Abram with regard to the Egyptian

306
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,399
bondage. Now we understand that's going to happen many years from this event

307
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:44,839
that we see. It's going to be 25 years before Isaac is even born, the promise

308
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:50,359
of the seed. And now we find that hundreds of years are now in view with

309
00:15:50,359 --> 00:15:54,880
regard to the possession of the land and some events that would lead to the

310
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,839
possession of the land. And so we see the the reference to the Egyptian bondage

311
00:15:58,839 --> 00:16:04,559
here in verse number 13. We see in verse number 14, it says this, "...and also that

312
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:11,799
nation whom they shall serve will I judge, and afterward shall they come out

313
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:16,839
with great substance." Now does that sound familiar to you as to what takes place

314
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:21,519
during the Passover, right? And we read about the Passover, the tenth plague. We

315
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:26,279
understand that as the children of Israel were serving there in Egypt, as

316
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:30,679
they were slaves, and there arose that Pharaoh that knew not Joseph, so on and

317
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:35,359
so forth, and we find that God would raise up Moses and Aaron, and they would

318
00:16:35,359 --> 00:16:39,160
stand before the Pharaoh, and there were great plagues to demonstrate the power

319
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:44,519
of God. And we find that after that tenth plague, the Passover, that the children

320
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:49,359
of Israel were delivered. Yes, the Egyptians were judged, and they left with

321
00:16:49,359 --> 00:16:53,440
great substance. Notice with me, hold your place here in Genesis, and turn to the

322
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,839
book of Exodus, if you will, in Exodus chapter number 12. So not only do we see

323
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,639
here in Genesis chapter number 15 a reference to the Egyptian bondage, but

324
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:08,279
also to the Exodus. We find in Exodus chapter number 12, excuse me,

325
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:13,919
in Exodus chapter number 12, notice in verse number 40. Let's look in verse

326
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,720
number 40. The Bible says this,

327
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:21,359
Now the sojourning of the children of Israel... I'll give you a moment, I hear

328
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:25,959
some pages turning. Verse number 40, Now the sojourning of the children of Israel

329
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:31,440
who dwelt in Egypt was four hundred and thirty years. And it came to pass at the

330
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,839
end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day, it came to pass

331
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:42,239
that all the hosts of the Lord went out from the land of Egypt. And we find here

332
00:17:42,239 --> 00:17:46,839
in Exodus chapter number 12, the reference with regard to the departure.

333
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:52,079
Now you will note, and I think it's of significant importance, because we find

334
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:57,399
in Genesis chapter number 15, in verse number 13, that the years, the number that

335
00:17:57,399 --> 00:18:02,079
is used is 400 years, and here in Exodus chapter number 12, the number that is

336
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:06,440
used is 430 years. In fact, if you look at the New Testament, you'll find the

337
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:10,440
book of Acts in chapter number 7, it references 400 years, and the book of

338
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:15,040
Galatians in chapter number 3, it references 430 years. You say, Pastor, why

339
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:19,000
are you telling us all of this? Because here's what happens.

340
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,160
Mockers and scoffers want to tell you that there's an error in the Bible. They

341
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,239
want to tell you that. And they'll look at something like this and say, is it 400

342
00:18:28,239 --> 00:18:35,760
or 430? Because your Bible says both. The answer is yes. It's both. How is it both?

343
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:41,760
Well, here's the importance, right? Here's what, so some Bible, if you

344
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,679
disagree with me, there's a lot of theologians that disagree with what I'm

345
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:49,080
gonna tell you, and I don't, I'm not trying to say that someone's right, wrong.

346
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:53,940
I'm trying to simply give you a Bible answer based upon my own study of the

347
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:58,580
scriptures of what I believe God is giving us in His Word with regard to

348
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:07,059
these years. Some simply just kind of skim over it by saying this, well, 400 is

349
00:19:07,059 --> 00:19:12,020
kind of a round number for 430. And they just try to explain it away real easy.

350
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:17,140
Well, if that's okay for you, then fine, but I don't like that answer. Because I

351
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:22,900
believe that every word of God is pure. Amen? And so if God is a God of detail,

352
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:28,820
and He is, then there's some significance between this 400 and this 430. We have a

353
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:34,260
difference of 30 years, and what could that be? I believe specifically that the

354
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:42,859
400 years is in reference to Isaac, okay? That's the seed, right? Abram has been

355
00:19:42,859 --> 00:19:46,779
given the promise with regard to the seed. There's the seed and the land, and

356
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:53,500
God is giving this promise with regard to Isaac, and the time of Isaac, from the

357
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:58,219
time in which he would be weaned until the time of the Exodus, would be 400

358
00:19:58,219 --> 00:20:02,619
years. And we find that...

359
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:08,299
that difference. Notice in verse number 13 again of chapter number 15 of the book of Genesis,

360
00:20:08,299 --> 00:20:12,699
he says, "...know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs,

361
00:20:12,699 --> 00:20:15,739
and shall serve them, and they shall afflict them four hundred years." Again,

362
00:20:15,739 --> 00:20:22,139
the reference of seed, I believe, dealing with Isaac. And so from Isaac, if you include

363
00:20:23,659 --> 00:20:28,939
from his time of weaning, if you will, to the time of the exodus, there would be that 400 years.

364
00:20:28,939 --> 00:20:34,699
And then you look at the 430 years, and you begin to think about Abram himself.

365
00:20:35,419 --> 00:20:39,739
And the reality is that Abram had left the Ur of the Chaldees, if you remember,

366
00:20:40,379 --> 00:20:45,579
here at this particular time in which Abram is dealing with these things. According to

367
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:53,019
chapter number 12, where the call and the promise was initially given, he was 75 years old. So 75,

368
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:58,299
and then when is Isaac going to be born? Well, Abram's going to be 100. So there's 25 years.

369
00:20:58,939 --> 00:21:05,979
The time of weaning obviously is different in our society culture than it was in biblical times,

370
00:21:05,979 --> 00:21:11,179
but it's very common for them to say that a time of a child being weaned was five years old.

371
00:21:11,179 --> 00:21:17,979
So if you take 25 years from the age of Abram at 75 to the time of 100 when Isaac was born,

372
00:21:17,979 --> 00:21:23,819
there's 25 years. The time of weaning being five years, there's your 30 years. The difference

373
00:21:23,819 --> 00:21:31,099
between 400 and 430, there's not a discrepancy in the Word of God. The question is, what timeline

374
00:21:31,099 --> 00:21:36,139
are we starting? What's the starting point? Is the starting point the time of Isaac, or is the

375
00:21:36,139 --> 00:21:42,459
starting point the time of Abram? If it's Abram, it's 430 years. If it's Isaac, it's 400 years.

376
00:21:42,459 --> 00:21:46,379
Does that make sense? And so we begin to study the Word of God, we begin to compare Scripture

377
00:21:46,379 --> 00:21:52,299
with Scripture, and you find that there is, I believe, an answer in the Word of God with regard

378
00:21:52,299 --> 00:21:57,339
to these things. It's interesting because, again, sometimes people just simply try to skim over it,

379
00:21:57,339 --> 00:22:02,379
excuse it, and say, well, it's just a round number, so on and so forth. There are other

380
00:22:03,259 --> 00:22:08,459
types of examples that we could look to this evening. We won't take the time to do so

381
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:14,779
for the sake of our study here in Genesis 15, but what I would say to you is that there are

382
00:22:14,779 --> 00:22:20,860
many scoffers out there that seek to attack the Word of God. This is nothing new. We understand

383
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:25,979
that from the very beginning, in Genesis chapter number 3, that the enemy, Satan, says,

384
00:22:25,979 --> 00:22:34,059
yea, hath God said. And he begins to question the authority of God's spoken Word, so no doubt the

385
00:22:34,059 --> 00:22:39,899
enemy is going to question the authority of God's written Word. And what does he do? Why do

386
00:22:39,899 --> 00:22:46,699
these scoffers attack and try to dig in and tell us that there are errors and discrepancies?

387
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:52,779
I believe that if they can be successful in doing so, that it puts doubt in the mind of

388
00:22:52,779 --> 00:22:59,019
the individual to say, how can I know if it's true or not? And ultimately, that's what Satan

389
00:22:59,019 --> 00:23:04,619
wants to do. Satan wants to have people come to a place where they say, I can't trust this book.

390
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:12,539
And there are people that you can come in contact with, no doubt, that will laugh at you, will mock

391
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:17,739
when you say that you're a Bible believer, when you say, well, the Bible says,

392
00:23:17,739 --> 00:23:23,259
because they have believed, they've been blinded by the enemy, and they believe the lie of the

393
00:23:23,259 --> 00:23:29,500
enemy. So I would say this evening, when someone asks me, is it 400 or 430 years? Yes, it depends

394
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:34,220
where the starting point is. And if we're starting with Abram, then it's 430. If we're starting with

395
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:39,659
Isaac, it's 400. And so that's just kind of a side note. It's for free. If you don't like it,

396
00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:43,659
you don't have to have it. They gave me some beans at lunch yesterday. I didn't want them.

397
00:23:43,659 --> 00:23:48,059
They just kind of took them away, you know. But that's for free this evening. I believe that it's

398
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:53,259
a valid explanation of the Word of God as you study and compare Scripture with Scripture.

399
00:23:53,259 --> 00:23:58,459
Notice, so we see these things that are revealed to Abram with regard to the events leading to

400
00:23:58,459 --> 00:24:02,619
the possession of the land. There's also events that are going to be revealed, as we're noticing

401
00:24:02,619 --> 00:24:08,619
what is revealed, with regard to the death of Abram. Notice what God says in verse number 15,

402
00:24:08,619 --> 00:24:14,059
and thou, now he's speaking directly to Abram. He's speaking in verse 13 and 14 about his seed

403
00:24:14,059 --> 00:24:18,379
and about the land that they would be a stranger in before they would possess the land, how they

404
00:24:18,379 --> 00:24:23,019
would leave during the exodus. In verse 15, he changes attention back to Abram and says,

405
00:24:23,019 --> 00:24:31,339
and thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace. Thou shalt be buried in a good old age.

406
00:24:31,979 --> 00:24:36,540
So now, Abram is getting, God is speaking directly to Abram with regard to

407
00:24:37,419 --> 00:24:43,260
revealing details about his death. If you look over, hold your place here, turn to the book of,

408
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:49,100
excuse me, to chapter 25 in Genesis, and look in chapter 25 in verse number 7, you'll notice

409
00:24:50,299 --> 00:24:59,339
that certainly Abram was buried at a good old age. The Bible says in Genesis 25 in verse number

410
00:24:59,339 --> 00:25:05,260
7, and these are the days of the years of Abraham's life, which he lived, and hundred,

411
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:13,339
threescore, and fifteen years. That's 175 years old. That's a good old age. And we understand

412
00:25:13,339 --> 00:25:18,619
that as we look here after the flood, and we've made note of this through our study of the book

413
00:25:18,619 --> 00:25:25,339
of Genesis, that the patriarchs, obviously, prior to the flood, they had very long lifespans.

414
00:25:25,979 --> 00:25:32,299
It begins to decrease, and it decreases pretty rapidly after the flood, and just all of the

415
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:39,979
catastrophic impact to not only the earth and all of the geological things that took place,

416
00:25:39,979 --> 00:25:45,739
but also just the environment itself. You get to the end of the book of Genesis, and you read about

417
00:25:45,739 --> 00:25:53,019
the death of Joseph, and he lived to be 110 years old. And then eventually you get to where God

418
00:25:53,019 --> 00:25:57,500
speaks to Moses about the threescore and ten and so on and so forth, if by reason of strength,

419
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:04,299
fourscore. And here, Abram is given this truth from God with regard to his departure, his death,

420
00:26:04,299 --> 00:26:12,779
that he would be buried in a good old age of 175 years. Again, in sight is the fact that our God

421
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:19,339
is eternal, that our God is omniscient, that he's able to give truth to Abram with regard to his own

422
00:26:19,339 --> 00:26:27,100
death. Notice with me also that God reveals information to Abram with regard to the judgment

423
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:31,100
upon the inhabitants of the land. We see that in verse number 16. It says,

424
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:37,899
but in the fourth generation they shall come hither again, for the iniquity of the Amorites

425
00:26:37,899 --> 00:26:43,019
is not yet full. It's an interesting reference. You begin to look in verses 19 through 21,

426
00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:47,339
and you begin to see the other groups of people that are mentioned, the Kenites, the Kenizzites,

427
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:52,139
the Kadmonites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaims, the Amorites, the Canaanites,

428
00:26:52,139 --> 00:26:56,779
the Gergesites, and the Jebusites. And you find here that the Amorites are mentioned

429
00:26:56,779 --> 00:27:02,619
specifically in verse number 16 about this fourth generation, again, this time period in which they

430
00:27:02,619 --> 00:27:07,979
would come again. And he says that the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full. It's interesting

431
00:27:07,979 --> 00:27:13,979
because the judgment would come upon the inhabitants of the land. This year, during the

432
00:27:13,979 --> 00:27:20,059
shutdown and all that was going on, I taught through the book of Joshua. We had those daily

433
00:27:20,059 --> 00:27:25,179
lessons that we sent out. And one reference that I made to you often throughout the book of Joshua

434
00:27:25,179 --> 00:27:30,779
is the fact that those inhabitants of the land were being judged because of their wickedness.

435
00:27:31,419 --> 00:27:36,139
And God had given warning to his people, to Joshua and the children of Israel,

436
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:43,979
to be careful about their walk with God and their obedience to the revealed Word of God,

437
00:27:43,979 --> 00:27:49,100
lest they also be judged. And so we find here that he says that the iniquity of the Amorites

438
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:54,940
is not yet full. In other words, God knew because he's omniscient and he's eternal,

439
00:27:54,940 --> 00:28:00,299
he knew the timing of what was going to happen. But really, I believe that as he says it's not

440
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:05,419
yet full, that God had given them some space, if you will, some time to repent.

441
00:28:06,139 --> 00:28:14,699
But the inhabitants of the land, they never repented. They continued to go and serve

442
00:28:14,699 --> 00:28:20,940
idols and live in their wicked behavior. And we find that they eventually would be judged. And our

443
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:27,660
God, of course, is the judge. And we understand that. He's gracious and he's merciful, but he is

444
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:32,940
the righteous judge. And we understand this evening that as we think about the end times,

445
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:37,500
and we think about the judgments, that as the people of God, if you've been born again,

446
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:41,739
you've trusted Christ as your Savior, that you'll stand at the bema seat of Christ,

447
00:28:41,739 --> 00:28:46,460
the judgment seat of Christ. But for those that have not trusted Christ as their Savior,

448
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:52,299
they will stand at the great white throne judgment, as is revealed to us in Revelation chapter number

449
00:28:52,299 --> 00:28:59,179
20. And so here, God is referencing the judgment that would come upon the inhabitants of the land.

450
00:28:59,179 --> 00:29:05,419
We can read of all of those events. Of course, after the Exodus and before the conquering of the

451
00:29:05,419 --> 00:29:11,500
land, you have the wilderness wanderings. That was never what God's plan was for the nation of

452
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:16,140
Israel. But because of their doubt and unbelief, that generation would die in the wilderness.

453
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:22,539
Now, we get here as we wrap up the 15th chapter of the book of Genesis, we now come to this,

454
00:29:22,539 --> 00:29:27,419
what is being revealed with regard to the details of the covenant that God is making

455
00:29:27,979 --> 00:29:34,700
with Abram. And so we see that he's revealed several things, and now he's coming back to what

456
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:40,460
the passage started with that we're looking at this evening. When Abram says to God, after God

457
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:46,219
says to give thee this land to inherit it, at the end of verse number 7, that Abram then says,

458
00:29:46,219 --> 00:29:54,619
Lord God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it? And so God revealed these things to

459
00:29:54,619 --> 00:30:01,339
him, and now God is going to give him this sign, and he's going to give us details with regard to

460
00:30:01,339 --> 00:30:02,539
the covenant. Notice in verse

461
00:30:02,539 --> 00:30:09,499
verse number 17, and it came to pass that when the sun went down and it was dark.

462
00:30:09,499 --> 00:30:13,459
We notice that in verse number 12 it says when the sun was going down.

463
00:30:13,459 --> 00:30:18,179
Now the Bible tells us in verse number 17 that the sun went down and it was dark.

464
00:30:18,179 --> 00:30:25,299
Notice what it says, behold a smoking furnace and a burning lamp that passed between those

465
00:30:25,299 --> 00:30:26,579
pieces.

466
00:30:26,579 --> 00:30:27,579
What are the pieces?

467
00:30:28,019 --> 00:30:32,779
Well those are the animals that had been, God had given that detailed instruction with

468
00:30:32,779 --> 00:30:37,799
regard to that which was to be brought as we looked in verse number 9, and heifer of

469
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:41,739
three years old, a she goat of three years old, a ram of three years old, a turtle dove

470
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:46,539
and a young pigeon, and they had been divided and set in the midst, and so the Bible tells

471
00:30:46,539 --> 00:30:51,939
us in verse number 17 that passed between those pieces.

472
00:30:51,939 --> 00:30:57,559
Now remember I mentioned to you that the common custom of the day was that both parties that

473
00:30:57,559 --> 00:31:02,859
were involved in making the covenant or the agreement would pass through those pieces

474
00:31:02,859 --> 00:31:04,579
that had been divided.

475
00:31:04,579 --> 00:31:09,519
So both parties would pass through signifying that the covenant is being established and

476
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:16,919
symbolically saying if I break the covenant then it is for me to be divided asunder.

477
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:23,619
And so we find here in verse number 17 that the manifestation of God passing through is

478
00:31:23,619 --> 00:31:30,139
a smoking furnace and a burning lamp and it says that it passed between those pieces.

479
00:31:30,139 --> 00:31:31,299
What's the significance?

480
00:31:31,299 --> 00:31:37,099
Well the significance is that this Abrahamic covenant, as we often refer to it as, is an

481
00:31:37,099 --> 00:31:39,359
unconditional covenant.

482
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:44,239
This is based upon the goodness, the grace and mercy of God.

483
00:31:44,239 --> 00:31:50,119
This covenant that is being made has nothing to do with Abraham, it has everything to do

484
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:51,519
with God.

485
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:55,279
And that's important, it's significant for us to understand that as we think about promises

486
00:31:55,279 --> 00:32:01,419
in the Word of God, there are conditional promises and there are unconditional promises.

487
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:05,799
Some of the conditional promises, some of the most common conditional promises are ones

488
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:10,099
that would be categorized as being if-then.

489
00:32:10,099 --> 00:32:13,219
If you do this, then God will do this.

490
00:32:13,219 --> 00:32:15,039
That's a conditional promise.

491
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:19,359
God's action is a response to our action.

492
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:21,719
If you do this, then this is what God's going to do.

493
00:32:21,719 --> 00:32:24,879
In fact, you could read Proverbs chapter number two and you'll see a whole list of them at

494
00:32:24,879 --> 00:32:27,399
the beginning of the second chapter of the book of Proverbs.

495
00:32:27,399 --> 00:32:30,959
If-then, if-then, you'll read right through it and you'll see a number of them.

496
00:32:30,959 --> 00:32:35,079
And so those are scattered, littered throughout the Word of God and we find also there are

497
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:36,759
unconditional promises.

498
00:32:36,759 --> 00:32:43,599
This covenant that God has made, the significance of the manifestation of God through this smoking

499
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:48,719
furnace and this burning lamp passing between the pieces would signify for us this evening

500
00:32:48,719 --> 00:32:50,759
that this is an unconditional covenant.

501
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:56,559
This is a promise that God is making to Abraham with regard to that which had been promised.

502
00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:02,239
Remember, he says, to give thee this land to inherit it and Abram says to God, whereby

503
00:33:02,239 --> 00:33:05,819
shall I know that I shall inherit it?

504
00:33:05,819 --> 00:33:10,599
And so God then passes through those pieces, the manifestation of such as we've mentioned

505
00:33:10,599 --> 00:33:13,119
already, and he passes through.

506
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:15,759
Abram himself, he did not pass through.

507
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:16,759
Why?

508
00:33:16,759 --> 00:33:17,999
Because God is the one making the promise.

509
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:22,279
Now, keep that thought and look at a few verses with me in the preceding chapters.

510
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:24,719
Actually, let's read verse 18 and then we'll do that.

511
00:33:24,719 --> 00:33:33,559
In the same day, the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, unto thy seed have I given

512
00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:40,319
this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates, the Kenites

513
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:44,459
and the Kenizzites and the Kadmonites and the Hittites and the Perizzites and the Rephaims

514
00:33:44,459 --> 00:33:48,899
and the Amorites and the Canaanites and the Gergesites and the Jebusites.

515
00:33:48,899 --> 00:33:53,299
We see in verse number 18 where we received our title for our message this evening that

516
00:33:53,299 --> 00:33:58,699
in that same day, the Lord made this covenant with Abram and notice what he said, unto thy

517
00:33:58,699 --> 00:34:04,019
seed have I given this land.

518
00:34:04,019 --> 00:34:11,859
Abram says to God in verse number eight, God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit

519
00:34:11,859 --> 00:34:12,979
it?

520
00:34:12,979 --> 00:34:13,979
What is it?

521
00:34:13,979 --> 00:34:19,859
The land, as it's mentioned in verse number seven, to give this land, to give thee this

522
00:34:19,859 --> 00:34:21,259
land to inherit it.

523
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:25,339
And so God then answers that request that Abram made at the beginning of our study this

524
00:34:25,339 --> 00:34:27,059
evening.

525
00:34:27,059 --> 00:34:33,979
He passes through giving Abram the sign that this is the sign, I've made this covenant,

526
00:34:33,979 --> 00:34:41,379
this promise with you that I now am telling you I have given this land to your seed.

527
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:46,659
Now it's interesting because now we're speaking in terms that it's already settled.

528
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:52,419
It says unto thee have I given this land.

529
00:34:52,419 --> 00:34:57,499
Prior to this verse of Scripture, everything that is spoken of with regard to the land

530
00:34:57,499 --> 00:34:59,779
is spoken of in future.

531
00:34:59,779 --> 00:35:01,499
I'm going to give this to you.

532
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:04,939
Now he says I have given you this land.

533
00:35:04,939 --> 00:35:08,299
Notice with me, turn back if you will to chapter number 12.

534
00:35:08,299 --> 00:35:12,339
We did this last week as we looked at the promise with regard to the seed, but look

535
00:35:12,339 --> 00:35:17,279
at it now as the passage in Genesis 15 shifts from seed to land.

536
00:35:17,279 --> 00:35:22,539
We find in verse number seven of Genesis 12, the Bible says, and the Lord appeared unto

537
00:35:22,539 --> 00:35:29,219
Abram and said, unto thy seed will I give this land.

538
00:35:29,219 --> 00:35:30,819
That's future, correct?

539
00:35:30,819 --> 00:35:33,099
Will I give this land?

540
00:35:33,099 --> 00:35:36,699
And there builded he an altar unto the Lord who appeared unto him.

541
00:35:36,699 --> 00:35:40,319
Abram then responded to that promise by worshiping the Lord.

542
00:35:40,319 --> 00:35:44,659
We see in chapter number 13, look in verse number 15.

543
00:35:44,659 --> 00:35:48,299
This is after the division between Abram and Lot.

544
00:35:48,299 --> 00:35:53,499
And we know that Lot went toward the plain and pitched his tent towards Sodom.

545
00:35:53,499 --> 00:35:59,259
And the Lord then says to Abram in verse number 14, he says this, and the Lord said unto Abram,

546
00:35:59,259 --> 00:36:02,739
after that Lot was separated from him, lift up now thine eyes and look from the place

547
00:36:02,739 --> 00:36:08,779
where thou art northward and southward and eastward and westward for all the land which

548
00:36:08,779 --> 00:36:15,619
thou seest to thee will I give it and to thy seed forever.

549
00:36:15,619 --> 00:36:19,579
We see again in verse number 17, it says, arise, walk through the land and the length

550
00:36:19,579 --> 00:36:24,339
of it and in the breadth of it, for I will give it unto thee.

551
00:36:24,339 --> 00:36:29,339
In chapter number 15, as we started our message this evening in verse number seven, God says

552
00:36:29,339 --> 00:36:36,779
to Abram and he said unto him, I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees

553
00:36:36,779 --> 00:36:41,699
to give thee this land to inherit it.

554
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:47,299
And now Abram says, God, in verse number eight, he's asking for that sign.

555
00:36:47,299 --> 00:36:48,299
That's what's requested.

556
00:36:48,299 --> 00:36:51,459
Whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?

557
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:57,379
And God goes through this, what was a common practice, a custom in that particular day

558
00:36:57,379 --> 00:37:02,739
in those making covenants and God himself, the manifestation through the smoking furnace

559
00:37:02,739 --> 00:37:09,499
and the burning lamp, he passes through those pieces and he says to Abram, unto thy seed

560
00:37:09,499 --> 00:37:13,179
have I given this land.

561
00:37:13,179 --> 00:37:17,579
What a great promise that God gives to Abram on this particular day.

562
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:20,659
Now we understand the significance of the Abrahamic covenant.

563
00:37:20,659 --> 00:37:26,419
We understand that here the specifics are given with regard to the territory.

564
00:37:26,459 --> 00:37:31,459
He says there at the end of verse number 18, from the river of Egypt unto the great river,

565
00:37:31,459 --> 00:37:32,899
the river Euphrates.

566
00:37:32,899 --> 00:37:38,119
He then lists out a number of people groups that are mentioned in verses 19 through 21.

567
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:43,539
And we find this significance with regard to the territory that God has given.

568
00:37:43,539 --> 00:37:49,179
As we've looked at this 15th chapter and we dealt with the two aspects of the Abrahamic

569
00:37:49,179 --> 00:37:53,899
covenant, we see first of all the seed and we understand the birth of Isaac that would

570
00:37:53,899 --> 00:37:59,939
come later on here in the book of Genesis as we begin to read about that miraculous

571
00:37:59,939 --> 00:38:07,739
birth and how God was fulfilling the promise that he made to Abram and Sarah.

572
00:38:07,739 --> 00:38:09,939
And we see that in chapter number 21.

573
00:38:09,939 --> 00:38:14,679
But of course we understand the fullness of that Abrahamic covenant and that promise with

574
00:38:14,679 --> 00:38:18,379
regard to the seed is the Lord Jesus.

575
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:21,299
We find that Paul mentions that in the book of Galatians.

576
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:26,139
If you want to take a moment to turn there, we referenced this last week briefly and we'll

577
00:38:26,139 --> 00:38:27,699
reference it again this evening.

578
00:38:27,699 --> 00:38:34,059
We see in Galatians chapter number 3 that as the reference to Genesis chapter number

579
00:38:34,059 --> 00:38:39,099
15 in verse number 6 is seen in Galatians 3 and verse number 6.

580
00:38:39,099 --> 00:38:43,659
The Bible says even as Abraham believed God and it was accounted to him for righteousness.

581
00:38:43,659 --> 00:38:47,940
And we find it in verse number 16 of Galatians 3.

582
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:48,940
It says,

583
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:53,259
Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made.

584
00:38:53,259 --> 00:39:03,719
He saith not unto seeds as of many, but as of one, and to thy seed, which is Christ.

585
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:07,619
And so we understood as we studied through the 15th chapter of the book of Genesis over

586
00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:13,279
these last few weeks and really over the last few chapters of the book of Genesis that this

587
00:39:13,899 --> 00:39:18,880
promise has been given to Abram and it's a seed and it's a land and we focus upon that

588
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,599
seed and we see that as Christ.

589
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:26,799
Now you understand as you go from this portion of scripture in Genesis 12 through 15 and

590
00:39:26,799 --> 00:39:28,599
look at how God zeros in.

591
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:31,359
Remember he starts in Genesis with creation.

592
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:35,519
He looks at the creation of man, all of the different groups of people.

593
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:39,399
You see the tower of Babel, the spreading of the people and so on and so forth.

594
00:39:39,399 --> 00:39:46,119
And then God zeros in upon Abram and the Hebrew people and that will be the direction

595
00:39:46,119 --> 00:39:50,299
in which the book of Genesis and really all of scripture begins to travel.

596
00:39:50,299 --> 00:39:54,979
There are references that are provided to us with regard to other people groups as they

597
00:39:54,979 --> 00:39:57,239
interact with God's people.

598
00:39:57,239 --> 00:39:58,239
But why?

599
00:39:58,239 --> 00:39:59,239
What's the significance?

600
00:39:59,239 --> 00:40:00,759
Well, that's the seed.

601
00:40:00,759 --> 00:40:02,559
That's where Messiah would come from.

602
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:08,619
come through the line the messianic line and the significance of all that you

603
00:40:08,619 --> 00:40:12,159
read of and you think about the spiritual warfare that were engaged in

604
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:18,599
the spiritual battles that Satan has spent all of those years as recorded in

605
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:24,139
the Old Testament to try to defile and destroy that line so that that Messiah

606
00:40:24,139 --> 00:40:29,739
would not be able to come. Why is it that that Haman so hated Mordecai? Was it

607
00:40:29,739 --> 00:40:33,699
just because of Mordecai? Why was it that Haman wouldn't be satisfied with

608
00:40:33,699 --> 00:40:39,059
simply killing the one that would not bow down? No, he wanted to destroy all the

609
00:40:39,059 --> 00:40:46,179
Jews and you see the enemy, Satan, working to try to destroy the promised line, the

610
00:40:46,179 --> 00:40:51,099
seed. There's also the significance with regard to the land. God had promised them

611
00:40:51,099 --> 00:40:55,299
this land and you find the territorial battles that have taken place not only

612
00:40:55,379 --> 00:40:59,899
biblically but even still to this very day. The battles that take place with

613
00:40:59,899 --> 00:41:04,739
regard to the land that God promised to his people Israel and you find that

614
00:41:04,739 --> 00:41:09,059
throughout the scriptures the the borders of Israel, the children of

615
00:41:09,059 --> 00:41:13,259
Israel, they were large and they shrunk and they were all kind of all over the

616
00:41:13,259 --> 00:41:17,459
place throughout their history depending on the particular kings and so on and so

617
00:41:17,459 --> 00:41:22,099
forth. They never had really reached the fullness of the potential of what God

618
00:41:22,099 --> 00:41:26,819
outlines in Genesis chapter number 15. The closest they ever came is during the

619
00:41:26,819 --> 00:41:31,779
reign of David and that of Solomon. In fact if you look during the time of

620
00:41:31,779 --> 00:41:37,339
Solomon's reign when God had given rest and after the all of those amazing

621
00:41:37,339 --> 00:41:40,619
things that had taken place during of course the reign of David and then

622
00:41:40,619 --> 00:41:45,459
entering into the reign of Solomon that God had given rest from from those

623
00:41:45,459 --> 00:41:50,579
enemies and so on and so forth. But the fullness of this promise with regard to

624
00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:55,379
the territory that is described in Genesis 15 and verse number 18 will

625
00:41:55,379 --> 00:42:00,459
ultimately be fulfilled during the millennial reign of Christ. And so you

626
00:42:00,459 --> 00:42:05,139
begin to see that all the way back in Genesis chapter number 15 how you see so

627
00:42:05,139 --> 00:42:11,779
many years of time that are being referenced not only with regard to the

628
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:16,300
people of Israel, the events leading to the possession of the land, the time of

629
00:42:16,339 --> 00:42:21,819
Abraham's life of course and his depart his death, but also we see the fullness

630
00:42:21,819 --> 00:42:28,139
of the millennial reign of Christ that seed that is mentioned being Christ in

631
00:42:28,139 --> 00:42:33,020
Galatians chapter 3 and during the time in which he will physically rule

632
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:37,819
and reign on this earth for a thousand years. Now we're not there yet we've not

633
00:42:37,819 --> 00:42:41,459
reached the millennium of course we're going to have the rapture of the church

634
00:42:41,459 --> 00:42:44,459
will take place and the Great Tribulation and then the millennial reign

635
00:42:44,459 --> 00:42:49,179
of Christ. It will happen and we don't know the time in which it will happen we

636
00:42:49,179 --> 00:42:53,259
know that it's at least seven years and a few moments away because there's seven

637
00:42:53,259 --> 00:42:57,099
years of tribulation and the return of the Lord could happen at any moment and

638
00:42:57,099 --> 00:43:01,699
and that's when that timeline will begin. And so we find that here as we look at

639
00:43:01,699 --> 00:43:07,059
this passage of Scripture what an exciting opportunity to see that in the

640
00:43:07,059 --> 00:43:11,660
life of Abram that God has given these promises he told her about the seed he

641
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:15,139
took him out he said look up in the stars look toward the heaven if you can

642
00:43:15,139 --> 00:43:20,899
number them and he says so shall thy seed be. Then he says by the way I'm the

643
00:43:20,899 --> 00:43:24,419
Lord that brought you out of the earth the Chaldees to give thee this land to

644
00:43:24,419 --> 00:43:30,139
inherit it and Abram says whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it and God

645
00:43:30,139 --> 00:43:35,220
gives them this sign after he reveals these details he gives them this sign by

646
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:40,580
he alone passing through those pieces that were divided showing us the fact

647
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:45,459
that this is an unconditional covenant. These things were not based upon

648
00:43:45,459 --> 00:43:50,099
anything that Abram would do anything that he would offer any gifts that he

649
00:43:50,099 --> 00:43:54,739
would bring and we understand that salvation for a child of God is all

650
00:43:54,739 --> 00:44:00,020
based on the grace and mercy of God and it's important that we wrap up in that

651
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:04,380
fashion this evening. We understand the Bible says for by grace are you saved

652
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:08,059
through faith and that not of yourselves is the gift of God not of works lest any

653
00:44:08,099 --> 00:44:12,539
man should boast and we understand this evening that our God is gracious and he

654
00:44:12,539 --> 00:44:16,979
is merciful he's full of compassion and he is the Savior of the world and the

655
00:44:16,979 --> 00:44:21,100
reality this evening is that as we think about the truth of salvation we ought to

656
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:24,459
rejoice in the fact that it has everything to do with what the Lord

657
00:44:24,459 --> 00:44:29,179
Jesus Christ did on the cross of Calvary apart from anything that you could offer

658
00:44:29,179 --> 00:44:33,220
why because I can't there's nothing good enough that I could do to earn his

659
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:40,220
merit to earn his salvation it is the gift of God not by not by our works of

660
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:44,820
righteousness the Bible says that the wages of sin is death but the gift of

661
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:48,940
God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord I'm so thankful that Jesus said

662
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:54,619
on the cross of Calvary it is finished he paid for your sin and for my sin he

663
00:44:54,619 --> 00:44:58,579
paid for the sin of the world and we find that the truth of salvation the

664
00:44:58,579 --> 00:45:02,700
promise that God has given with regard to salvation in like manner to this

665
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:06,700
promise that he gave to Abram in Genesis chapter number 15 it has nothing

666
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:10,500
to do with anything that we would do other than just simply believing and

667
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:14,899
receiving and receive that great promise that he said for whosoever shall call

668
00:45:14,899 --> 00:45:20,619
upon the name of the Lord shall be saved I'm so thankful for the truth of

669
00:45:20,619 --> 00:45:25,419
salvation this evening as we understand the foundational aspect I understand it

670
00:45:25,419 --> 00:45:31,019
was more teachy this evening but as we understand the foundational the the

671
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:36,980
impact of Genesis chapter 15 it will help us to understand the events that

672
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:40,619
take place within the next pages of Scripture not only here in the book of

673
00:45:40,619 --> 00:45:44,779
Genesis but throughout the whole of Scripture with regard to this covenant

674
00:45:44,779 --> 00:45:51,220
that God made with Abram it is a significant event that helps if we don't

675
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:56,339
fully comprehend and understand this event in Genesis 15 it really hinders us

676
00:45:56,339 --> 00:46:00,859
from a proper understanding of future things that will be detailed and dealt

677
00:46:00,859 --> 00:46:04,980
with throughout the Word of God and that's why the book of Genesis is so

678
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:10,260
foundational and I believe that's why the book of Genesis is under such great

679
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:16,739
attack because it's so foundational to understanding the whole of Scripture let

680
00:46:16,739 --> 00:46:20,419
us pray together father we love you this evening we thank you for loving us we

681
00:46:20,419 --> 00:46:25,419
thank you for the Word of God the truth contained therein we thank you for this

682
00:46:25,419 --> 00:46:31,419
truth that you gave us in Genesis 15 that sets the firm foundation with

683
00:46:31,419 --> 00:46:36,940
regard to your dealings with the the children of Israel with the Hebrews the

684
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:41,500
Jewish race and as we begin to study throughout the rest of this book and

685
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:46,059
even the whole of Scripture and we see just your interactions and your dealings

686
00:46:46,059 --> 00:46:49,260
and Lord we thank you for this covenant that was made with Abram on this

687
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:54,899
particular day and in its significance I pray that you would help us to rejoice

688
00:46:54,899 --> 00:47:00,299
in the fact that you are eternal and omniscient that you are able to with

689
00:47:00,299 --> 00:47:07,019
specific detail lay out events that will happen generations to come even as we

690
00:47:07,019 --> 00:47:11,660
see here in the life of Abram because you are eternal and because you are

691
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:16,980
omniscient I pray God that you'd help us to rest in that and help us to find just

692
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:21,779
have our faith increased and to find great encouragement through those truths

693
00:47:21,779 --> 00:47:25,419
this evening I pray God that if there's one that has never trusted the Lord

694
00:47:25,419 --> 00:47:29,179
Jesus Christ as their personal Savior they do not know for sure if they were

695
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:32,660
denied today that heaven is their home I pray God that they'd understand the

696
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:36,940
truth of salvation redemption through the blood of Christ that Jesus Christ

697
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:41,459
the Son of God went to that cruel cross he suffered and bled and died he was

698
00:47:41,459 --> 00:47:44,980
buried in a borrowed tomb and he rose in victory conquering sin death in the

699
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:51,339
grave he said he declared it is finished and I pray this evening that if there's

700
00:47:51,339 --> 00:47:55,459
one under the sound of my voice whether they're here present in our auditorium

701
00:47:55,459 --> 00:47:59,100
or they're watching online that they never have trusted Christ as their

702
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:03,940
Savior that they would understand the promise of redemption the gift of God

703
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:08,339
which is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord and that today is the

704
00:48:08,339 --> 00:48:12,220
day of salvation the Bible declares for whosoever shall call upon the name of

705
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:17,059
the Lord shall be saved have your will and way in these moments of invitation

706
00:48:17,059 --> 00:48:19,859
and we'll thank you for all that you'll do for it's in Christ's name we pray
