WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.279
Genesis chapter number 15, and we have been studying

00:00:03.279 --> 00:00:06.139
through the book of Genesis for quite a while.

00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:08.960
I don't know exactly how long I could look in my notes

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.640
and tell you, this is lesson 43, I know that.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.920
And the very first lesson that we had,

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.279
if I scroll through my notes here,

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:18.479
was back on March 10th, 2019.

00:00:18.479 --> 00:00:20.760
And so we've been going through the book of Genesis,

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.620
making progress as we've gone through.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.440
Of course, we haven't been every single Sunday evening

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.440
in the book of Genesis.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.100
We've taken a few off, but we'll finish up

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.540
chapter number 15 this evening.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.400
And if you think about the 15th chapter

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.159
of the book of Genesis, you find that there's really

00:00:37.159 --> 00:00:40.759
a continuation of a dialogue, a meeting,

00:00:40.759 --> 00:00:45.240
that God gives us a record of between the Lord and Abram.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.759
And we find that as we really focused upon the first verse

00:00:48.759 --> 00:00:50.720
in our first study of Genesis 15,

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.400
and really the way in which Abram was greeted by the Lord

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.220
and God told him to fear not.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.220
And he said, I am thy shield, thy exceeding great reward.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.020
Last Sunday evening, we looked at verses two through six.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.739
And in that text of scripture, we dealt with the fact

00:01:05.739 --> 00:01:08.660
that Abram comes to the Lord and says to me,

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.220
thou hast given no seed.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.900
And of course, we find that God begins to provide

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.220
a record to Abram and Abram's perspective is revealed to us

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.620
as he says, here's the problem,

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.980
here's a potential solution, Eleazar,

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.660
one that's born in mine house.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.139
And God says, no, and he gives him

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:28.339
very specific instruction with regard to the promise.

00:01:28.339 --> 00:01:29.980
And that explanation is provided,

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.739
and of course, the promise is embraced.

00:01:31.739 --> 00:01:34.860
As we continue to move through the 15th chapter

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.900
of the book of Genesis, really,

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.620
we are given further insight detail

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.739
with regard to the Abrahamic covenant

00:01:41.739 --> 00:01:43.559
as we'd often refer to it.

00:01:43.559 --> 00:01:48.260
And we find that here in this passage of scripture,

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.519
there's some time that lapsed, not much,

00:01:50.519 --> 00:01:52.739
but we do see the days that go on.

00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:54.519
You'll recall from our study last week

00:01:54.879 --> 00:01:56.400
that it was in verse number five,

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.639
as the Lord is giving the promise to Abram,

00:01:59.639 --> 00:02:02.000
he brings him out and he says, look up toward heaven.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.800
And he tells him to look at the stars.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.239
And so we see it would be evening,

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:08.600
he's looking at the stars and we made note of those things.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.139
And of course, God gives them the promise

00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:12.720
with regard to his seed.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.639
And then we find in verse number 12,

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:16.600
the Bible says when the sun was going down.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.919
And so there's another day that is unfolding here

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:22.279
throughout this process, this dialogue,

00:02:22.279 --> 00:02:23.960
this meeting, if you will.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.440
And this conversation will continue.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.839
And as we look at the passage,

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:30.279
I want you to notice the statement in verse number 18,

00:02:30.279 --> 00:02:32.160
where the Bible says on the same day,

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.080
the Lord made a covenant with Abram.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.020
And so I've titled the message this evening,

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.199
the Lord made a covenant with Abram.

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:40.479
We'll be looking at verses seven

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:42.160
down through verse number 21.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.320
And as we dig into the passage this evening,

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.600
I want you to notice with me first of all,

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.080
what is requested.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.600
Notice what is requested as we begin to look at this passage

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.440
and we see how that in verse number one,

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.899
God comes and this message is given to Abram in a vision.

00:02:57.899 --> 00:03:01.440
And then Abram speaks to God and God responds to Abram

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.940
and so on and so forth.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.600
And we find that in verse number six,

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.880
that as we finished up last week,

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.160
it says he believed in the Lord

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.720
and he counted it to him for righteousness.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.759
That was of utmost importance as we looked at that verse

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:18.759
and seeing the faith of Abram

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:21.360
and believing what God said would come to pass.

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:23.679
And we find in verse number seven, it says,

00:03:23.679 --> 00:03:26.000
and he said unto him,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.759
I am the Lord that brought thee out of the Ur of the Chaldees

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:34.240
to give thee this land to inherit it.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.240
And so we find that God is now speaking to Abram again

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.559
in verse number seven.

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:39.960
And he tells him, it's interesting.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.880
He says, I am the Lord that brought thee

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.199
out of the Ur of the Chaldees.

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:46.399
And so we'd go all the way back to chapter number 11 and 12

00:03:46.399 --> 00:03:50.119
and begin to see that call of Abram that God extends

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:53.000
and how Abram would leave the Ur of the Chaldees

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.679
and he would go on this journey, of course,

00:03:54.679 --> 00:03:56.839
eventually coming to the place

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:59.240
where God had told him to travel to.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.440
And we find that he's saying,

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.440
I am the Lord that brought thee out of the Ur of the Chaldees

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.160
to give thee this land to inherit it.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.919
So as we look at the passage of scripture

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:11.479
and we've understood over the last several chapters

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:14.119
of studying the life of Abram,

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:17.079
that the promise to Abram really is twofold.

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:19.399
There's the aspect of the seed

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.279
and there's the aspect of the land.

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:25.000
Last week, we really focused upon

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.519
the seed portion of the promise.

00:04:27.519 --> 00:04:31.959
This evening, we'll see that the focus now will shift

00:04:31.959 --> 00:04:35.000
and not so much be with regard to the seed

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.839
as much as it is with regard to the land.

00:04:37.839 --> 00:04:39.399
We see that in verse number seven

00:04:39.399 --> 00:04:41.799
where God ends that verse of scripture by saying,

00:04:41.799 --> 00:04:46.440
to give thee this land to inherit it.

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.559
And he said unto him, excuse me,

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:50.600
go back to verse number eight.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.119
And he said, this is now Abram talking to the Lord.

00:04:54.119 --> 00:04:57.839
He says, Lord God, whereby shall I know

00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:59.799
that I shall inherit it?

00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:01.359
And so this is what we find

00:05:01.359 --> 00:05:03.799
when we notice what is requested in verse number eight,

00:05:03.799 --> 00:05:06.200
Abram is requesting a sign.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.519
He is requesting, he says,

00:05:07.519 --> 00:05:10.320
he hears what God says to thee this land

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.679
or to give thee this land to inherit it.

00:05:12.679 --> 00:05:16.000
And in verse number eight, Abram is saying to the Lord,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.600
whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.760
Now it's interesting because when we're speaking

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.320
about the seed in our previous message,

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.200
we find that Abram comes and he says,

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.720
you've not given me any seed.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.880
I understand this promise that's been given.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.279
I have no seed.

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:33.640
Lo, one born in my house is mine heir.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:34.720
And what does God do?

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.480
God says, no, that's not the way it's going to work.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:38.839
He tells him in verse number four,

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:40.799
this shall not be thine heir,

00:05:40.799 --> 00:05:43.079
but he that shall come forth out of thine own bow

00:05:43.079 --> 00:05:44.279
shall be thine heir.

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:45.440
And then what does God do?

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:49.880
He gives him a, it really goes and gives him this picture

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.880
of let's go out, look toward the heavens, see the stars.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.320
And so as God would give him and tell him

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.760
to look to the stars, if thou be able to number them,

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:04.119
and he said unto him, so shall thy seed be.

00:06:04.119 --> 00:06:06.980
And so now the same God is saying to Abram,

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.399
by the way, I've brought you out of the earthy Caldes

00:06:09.399 --> 00:06:10.959
to give you this land.

00:06:10.959 --> 00:06:13.359
And Abram saying, okay, what is the sign

00:06:13.359 --> 00:06:16.359
with regard to the inheritance of the land?

00:06:16.359 --> 00:06:18.279
And so he's requesting this sign.

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:20.839
It is interesting as we find that Paul is writing

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:22.320
to the believers in Corinth.

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.279
And in first Corinthians one and verse 22,

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:26.920
he says that the Jews require a sign.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.160
And that's interesting as it would go all the way back

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.920
even to Abram and asking the Lord

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.040
in this very passage of scripture, of course,

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:37.399
many times the Hebrews, Jewish folks,

00:06:37.399 --> 00:06:39.880
Father Abraham, and they understand their ancestry

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.000
and so on and so forth.

00:06:41.119 --> 00:06:44.720
And we find that he's asking, he's requesting this sign.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.239
He says, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?

00:06:48.239 --> 00:06:49.959
And so we notice what is requested.

00:06:49.959 --> 00:06:52.320
I now want you to notice what is required.

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:56.519
In verses nine through 11, God is going to give

00:06:56.519 --> 00:06:59.079
some specific requirements to Abram,

00:06:59.079 --> 00:07:00.279
specifically in verse number nine.

00:07:00.279 --> 00:07:02.839
And we see how Abram will respond

00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:05.000
to that which is required.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.799
In verse number nine, God said to Abram,

00:07:07.799 --> 00:07:09.519
it says, and he said unto him,

00:07:09.519 --> 00:07:12.119
take me an heifer of three years old

00:07:12.119 --> 00:07:14.160
and a she goat of three years old

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.799
and a ram of three years old

00:07:15.799 --> 00:07:18.920
and a turtle dove and a young pigeon.

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.959
It is interesting as we look at verse number nine

00:07:20.959 --> 00:07:23.559
and we begin to consider this evening what is required

00:07:23.559 --> 00:07:27.359
when this request is made by Abram

00:07:27.359 --> 00:07:29.359
with regard to this sign.

00:07:29.359 --> 00:07:30.839
What is it that you'll give me

00:07:30.839 --> 00:07:33.839
that I know that I shall inherit the land?

00:07:33.839 --> 00:07:37.519
God gives him some very detailed instruction.

00:07:37.559 --> 00:07:40.239
He tells him to get an heifer of three years,

00:07:40.239 --> 00:07:43.119
a she goat of three years, a ram of three years,

00:07:43.119 --> 00:07:45.679
a turtle dove and a young pigeon.

00:07:45.679 --> 00:07:47.959
And very detailed, very specific.

00:07:47.959 --> 00:07:51.200
Our God is a God of order in detail.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.760
And we find that throughout the whole of scripture.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:56.720
And we find that the action of Abram

00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:00.200
in verse number 10 is immediate obedience.

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:01.839
We see the detailed instruction

00:08:01.839 --> 00:08:04.040
followed by the detailed action

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.000
where the Bible says this in verse number 10,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.279
and he took unto him all these.

00:08:09.279 --> 00:08:11.600
Aren't you thankful for the obedience

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.720
that we read of in the life of Abram?

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:18.440
Our God, we understand as we study the scriptures,

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:22.399
there is a principle of obedience throughout the word of God

00:08:22.399 --> 00:08:24.760
in that our God blesses obedience.

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:26.839
And we find here that Abram did

00:08:26.839 --> 00:08:28.679
as the Lord had commanded him.

00:08:28.679 --> 00:08:30.519
He took unto him all these.

00:08:30.519 --> 00:08:32.719
Notice it was not partial obedience.

00:08:32.719 --> 00:08:36.039
He did not say, well, this will work

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:37.359
or I could do it this way.

00:08:37.359 --> 00:08:40.320
No, Abram gets the detailed instruction.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.400
And we find that there's detailed action

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.840
on the part of Abram, this immediate obedience.

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:49.039
It says this, that he divided them in the midst

00:08:49.039 --> 00:08:51.239
and laid each piece one against another,

00:08:51.239 --> 00:08:53.880
but the birds he divided he not.

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:55.000
And so in your mind's eye,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.559
you can see there's some land here.

00:08:56.559 --> 00:09:00.280
He takes these animals with the heifer,

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:01.359
the she goat and the ram.

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:02.880
He divides them in half.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.760
He lays one over here aside from each other.

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.719
So as he divides the heifer half here, half here,

00:09:08.719 --> 00:09:11.159
so on and so forth with the she goat and the ram,

00:09:11.159 --> 00:09:13.840
the turtle dove and the young pigeon, he did not divide.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.400
Now, the significance of this

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:18.880
is that this was a common custom of the day

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:21.280
for those making a covenant.

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:23.640
It's not something that we're accustomed to

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:27.359
as believers living in 2020.

00:09:27.359 --> 00:09:29.119
You've made some agreements with people

00:09:29.119 --> 00:09:31.919
and I'm guessing you probably never divided some animals

00:09:31.919 --> 00:09:34.599
and put them apart from one another and so on and so forth.

00:09:34.599 --> 00:09:37.599
And so we have different means in which we make covenants

00:09:37.599 --> 00:09:39.640
or agreements one with another today,

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:44.159
but this was a very custom, common custom,

00:09:44.159 --> 00:09:46.239
excuse me, during this particular era.

00:09:46.239 --> 00:09:49.200
And we find what would happen is the parties

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.479
that are making this agreement or this covenant,

00:09:51.479 --> 00:09:55.000
the two parties, they would pass in between

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.919
those divided animals and as they would pass in between

00:09:58.919 --> 00:10:01.119
what they were doing is.

00:10:01.119 --> 00:10:06.479
symbolically, they were saying this is the fate of either party that would

00:10:06.479 --> 00:10:10.439
break the covenant. In other words, if I make a covenant with you, we go through

00:10:10.439 --> 00:10:17.199
this common practice, this custom, we go through, we walk through these divided

00:10:17.199 --> 00:10:22.999
animals. If I then break the covenant, I'm to be cut asunder. That's basically what

00:10:22.999 --> 00:10:28.119
is being communicated. And so we find that this was a common custom, and it's

00:10:28.119 --> 00:10:31.999
important that we understand that because as we look at the passage of

00:10:31.999 --> 00:10:37.279
Scripture and we understand the era in which this is happening, we understand

00:10:37.279 --> 00:10:41.959
the custom, and then we understand actually what happens in just a few

00:10:41.959 --> 00:10:46.559
verses in the significance of the covenant based upon the action that is

00:10:46.559 --> 00:10:50.199
taken. And so it's very important that we understand that. Notice in verse number

00:10:50.199 --> 00:10:55.519
11, the Bible says this, and when the fowls came down upon the carcasses,

00:10:55.519 --> 00:11:02.159
Abram drove them away. And so this was a long process. We find that the Bible says

00:11:02.159 --> 00:11:06.799
in verse 12, when the sun was going down, and so from the time in which Abram would

00:11:06.799 --> 00:11:12.159
cut asunder these animals and place them out, no doubt those

00:11:12.159 --> 00:11:17.559
birds, the scavenger fowls, they would come down and try to eat upon that which

00:11:17.559 --> 00:11:22.119
had been divided, and Abram would spend the majority of that day driving

00:11:22.119 --> 00:11:28.079
away those fowls, as the Bible tells us there in verse number 11. As we look here

00:11:28.079 --> 00:11:32.679
at what's taking place, it's important that we, again, understand the detail in

00:11:32.679 --> 00:11:38.079
which God is giving us. And we find that this man, Abram, makes this request and

00:11:38.079 --> 00:11:42.839
then God gives this requirement. The significance of those two

00:11:42.839 --> 00:11:47.399
things that are mentioned in the beginning of this passage really begin

00:11:47.399 --> 00:11:53.959
to unfold in an amazing way as we look at the latter portion of Genesis 15. We look

00:11:53.959 --> 00:11:58.279
at verses 12 through 21, and I would say this, as we've noticed what's requested

00:11:58.279 --> 00:12:02.679
and required, we now will notice what is revealed. And this is the bulk of the

00:12:02.679 --> 00:12:07.279
message this evening, as we see the significance of that which God would

00:12:07.279 --> 00:12:12.440
reveal to Abram during this particular time, and of course being recorded for us

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:17.119
in the Word of God, so that we'd understand this Abrahamic covenant.

00:12:17.119 --> 00:12:22.199
These details are provided to Abram. Notice it says in verse number 12,

00:12:22.199 --> 00:12:25.879
"...and when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram, and lo and horror

00:12:25.879 --> 00:12:31.199
of great darkness fell upon him. And he," God, of course, is the he that is being

00:12:31.199 --> 00:12:36.399
referred to, "...said unto Abram." Now, notice as we look at these verses of

00:12:36.399 --> 00:12:41.720
Scripture, and we consider that which will be revealed to Abram, we see first

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:46.440
of all that God will reveal some truth with regard to the events that

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:52.159
would lead to the possession of the land. It goes back to what God said in verse

00:12:52.159 --> 00:12:58.599
number 7, "...to give thee this land to inherit it." And right, so we find that the

00:12:58.599 --> 00:13:03.559
the context of what we're dealing with is God has said to Abram, I'm gonna give

00:13:03.559 --> 00:13:07.360
you this land. Abram says, what is the sign that you're going to give me that I

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:13.039
know this? And God is going to lay out the details in these verses of Scripture

00:13:13.039 --> 00:13:18.399
with regard to his plan. It reveals to us some amazing things with regard to our

00:13:18.399 --> 00:13:22.799
God. He's omniscient. He knows all things. He's eternal. He knows the end from the

00:13:22.799 --> 00:13:27.279
beginning. He's going to speak to Abram in these verses of Scripture, just a few

00:13:27.279 --> 00:13:32.679
verses. He's gonna speak to him about events that would take place centuries

00:13:32.679 --> 00:13:38.879
later, and he deals with them in detail. Why? Because our God is eternal. He is

00:13:38.879 --> 00:13:43.879
Alpha and Omega, the the beginning and the end, the first and the last. And so we

00:13:43.879 --> 00:13:48.720
find here that God begins, as he's gonna speak to Abram in verse number 13, notice

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:54.479
what he says, "...know of a surety." Now it's interesting, as we study the Word of

00:13:54.479 --> 00:13:58.039
God, we understand that God wants us to know some things. He wants us to be aware

00:13:58.199 --> 00:14:03.399
of what his plan is. He wants us to have confidence in what he has said. We looked

00:14:03.399 --> 00:14:07.000
at it this morning as we were studying there in 2 Chronicles, in the life of

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.239
Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, and that great event that is recorded in chapter

00:14:11.239 --> 00:14:15.799
number 20 with regard to the coalition and all of those things, and how that

00:14:15.799 --> 00:14:21.320
Jehoshaphat was aware of what God had promised, what God had said, and in simple

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:26.839
faith he believed God. See, God wanted Jehoshaphat and others to know what he

00:14:26.839 --> 00:14:31.799
had told Solomon years earlier, and he's given us his Word this evening, and

00:14:31.799 --> 00:14:36.119
throughout the Scriptures we understand that God has said that there are some

00:14:36.119 --> 00:14:40.479
things that we need to know, that we can have confidence in, that we can be sure

00:14:40.479 --> 00:14:46.199
of. Notice what it says, "...know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a

00:14:46.199 --> 00:14:50.160
land that is not theirs." Now it's interesting because now we begin to see

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:55.479
the reference to the seed and also to the land. Remember as we dealt with the

00:14:55.479 --> 00:15:00.160
seed last week, the first aspect of this promise that had been given to Abram,

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:05.279
that he gives them the details with regard to the seed, and we followed that

00:15:05.279 --> 00:15:09.399
throughout the New Testament, the book of Galatians specifically, and now in

00:15:09.399 --> 00:15:14.959
answering the question with regard to the land, God says to Abram that, "...thy seed

00:15:14.959 --> 00:15:20.479
shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them, and they

00:15:20.519 --> 00:15:25.199
shall afflict them four hundred years." And so here, as we begin to think about

00:15:25.199 --> 00:15:30.079
the events that would lead to the possession of the land, God in Genesis

00:15:30.079 --> 00:15:35.440
chapter number 15 is giving truth to Abram with regard to the Egyptian

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:39.399
bondage. Now we understand that's going to happen many years from this event

00:15:39.399 --> 00:15:44.839
that we see. It's going to be 25 years before Isaac is even born, the promise

00:15:44.839 --> 00:15:50.359
of the seed. And now we find that hundreds of years are now in view with

00:15:50.359 --> 00:15:54.880
regard to the possession of the land and some events that would lead to the

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:58.839
possession of the land. And so we see the the reference to the Egyptian bondage

00:15:58.839 --> 00:16:04.559
here in verse number 13. We see in verse number 14, it says this, "...and also that

00:16:04.559 --> 00:16:11.799
nation whom they shall serve will I judge, and afterward shall they come out

00:16:11.839 --> 00:16:16.839
with great substance." Now does that sound familiar to you as to what takes place

00:16:16.839 --> 00:16:21.519
during the Passover, right? And we read about the Passover, the tenth plague. We

00:16:21.519 --> 00:16:26.279
understand that as the children of Israel were serving there in Egypt, as

00:16:26.279 --> 00:16:30.679
they were slaves, and there arose that Pharaoh that knew not Joseph, so on and

00:16:30.679 --> 00:16:35.359
so forth, and we find that God would raise up Moses and Aaron, and they would

00:16:35.359 --> 00:16:39.160
stand before the Pharaoh, and there were great plagues to demonstrate the power

00:16:39.199 --> 00:16:44.519
of God. And we find that after that tenth plague, the Passover, that the children

00:16:44.519 --> 00:16:49.359
of Israel were delivered. Yes, the Egyptians were judged, and they left with

00:16:49.359 --> 00:16:53.440
great substance. Notice with me, hold your place here in Genesis, and turn to the

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:57.839
book of Exodus, if you will, in Exodus chapter number 12. So not only do we see

00:16:57.839 --> 00:17:02.639
here in Genesis chapter number 15 a reference to the Egyptian bondage, but

00:17:02.639 --> 00:17:08.279
also to the Exodus. We find in Exodus chapter number 12, excuse me,

00:17:08.279 --> 00:17:13.919
in Exodus chapter number 12, notice in verse number 40. Let's look in verse

00:17:13.919 --> 00:17:15.720
number 40. The Bible says this,

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:21.359
Now the sojourning of the children of Israel... I'll give you a moment, I hear

00:17:21.359 --> 00:17:25.959
some pages turning. Verse number 40, Now the sojourning of the children of Israel

00:17:25.959 --> 00:17:31.440
who dwelt in Egypt was four hundred and thirty years. And it came to pass at the

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:35.839
end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day, it came to pass

00:17:35.839 --> 00:17:42.239
that all the hosts of the Lord went out from the land of Egypt. And we find here

00:17:42.239 --> 00:17:46.839
in Exodus chapter number 12, the reference with regard to the departure.

00:17:46.839 --> 00:17:52.079
Now you will note, and I think it's of significant importance, because we find

00:17:52.079 --> 00:17:57.399
in Genesis chapter number 15, in verse number 13, that the years, the number that

00:17:57.399 --> 00:18:02.079
is used is 400 years, and here in Exodus chapter number 12, the number that is

00:18:02.079 --> 00:18:06.440
used is 430 years. In fact, if you look at the New Testament, you'll find the

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:10.440
book of Acts in chapter number 7, it references 400 years, and the book of

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:15.040
Galatians in chapter number 3, it references 430 years. You say, Pastor, why

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:19.000
are you telling us all of this? Because here's what happens.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:24.160
Mockers and scoffers want to tell you that there's an error in the Bible. They

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:28.239
want to tell you that. And they'll look at something like this and say, is it 400

00:18:28.239 --> 00:18:35.760
or 430? Because your Bible says both. The answer is yes. It's both. How is it both?

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:41.760
Well, here's the importance, right? Here's what, so some Bible, if you

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:44.679
disagree with me, there's a lot of theologians that disagree with what I'm

00:18:44.679 --> 00:18:49.080
gonna tell you, and I don't, I'm not trying to say that someone's right, wrong.

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:53.940
I'm trying to simply give you a Bible answer based upon my own study of the

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:58.580
scriptures of what I believe God is giving us in His Word with regard to

00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:07.059
these years. Some simply just kind of skim over it by saying this, well, 400 is

00:19:07.059 --> 00:19:12.020
kind of a round number for 430. And they just try to explain it away real easy.

00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:17.140
Well, if that's okay for you, then fine, but I don't like that answer. Because I

00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:22.900
believe that every word of God is pure. Amen? And so if God is a God of detail,

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:28.820
and He is, then there's some significance between this 400 and this 430. We have a

00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:34.260
difference of 30 years, and what could that be? I believe specifically that the

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:42.859
400 years is in reference to Isaac, okay? That's the seed, right? Abram has been

00:19:42.859 --> 00:19:46.779
given the promise with regard to the seed. There's the seed and the land, and

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:53.500
God is giving this promise with regard to Isaac, and the time of Isaac, from the

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:58.219
time in which he would be weaned until the time of the Exodus, would be 400

00:19:58.219 --> 00:20:02.619
years. And we find that...

00:20:02.619 --> 00:20:08.299
that difference. Notice in verse number 13 again of chapter number 15 of the book of Genesis,

00:20:08.299 --> 00:20:12.699
he says, "...know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs,

00:20:12.699 --> 00:20:15.739
and shall serve them, and they shall afflict them four hundred years." Again,

00:20:15.739 --> 00:20:22.139
the reference of seed, I believe, dealing with Isaac. And so from Isaac, if you include

00:20:23.659 --> 00:20:28.939
from his time of weaning, if you will, to the time of the exodus, there would be that 400 years.

00:20:28.939 --> 00:20:34.699
And then you look at the 430 years, and you begin to think about Abram himself.

00:20:35.419 --> 00:20:39.739
And the reality is that Abram had left the Ur of the Chaldees, if you remember,

00:20:40.379 --> 00:20:45.579
here at this particular time in which Abram is dealing with these things. According to

00:20:45.579 --> 00:20:53.019
chapter number 12, where the call and the promise was initially given, he was 75 years old. So 75,

00:20:53.019 --> 00:20:58.299
and then when is Isaac going to be born? Well, Abram's going to be 100. So there's 25 years.

00:20:58.939 --> 00:21:05.979
The time of weaning obviously is different in our society culture than it was in biblical times,

00:21:05.979 --> 00:21:11.179
but it's very common for them to say that a time of a child being weaned was five years old.

00:21:11.179 --> 00:21:17.979
So if you take 25 years from the age of Abram at 75 to the time of 100 when Isaac was born,

00:21:17.979 --> 00:21:23.819
there's 25 years. The time of weaning being five years, there's your 30 years. The difference

00:21:23.819 --> 00:21:31.099
between 400 and 430, there's not a discrepancy in the Word of God. The question is, what timeline

00:21:31.099 --> 00:21:36.139
are we starting? What's the starting point? Is the starting point the time of Isaac, or is the

00:21:36.139 --> 00:21:42.459
starting point the time of Abram? If it's Abram, it's 430 years. If it's Isaac, it's 400 years.

00:21:42.459 --> 00:21:46.379
Does that make sense? And so we begin to study the Word of God, we begin to compare Scripture

00:21:46.379 --> 00:21:52.299
with Scripture, and you find that there is, I believe, an answer in the Word of God with regard

00:21:52.299 --> 00:21:57.339
to these things. It's interesting because, again, sometimes people just simply try to skim over it,

00:21:57.339 --> 00:22:02.379
excuse it, and say, well, it's just a round number, so on and so forth. There are other

00:22:03.259 --> 00:22:08.459
types of examples that we could look to this evening. We won't take the time to do so

00:22:09.179 --> 00:22:14.779
for the sake of our study here in Genesis 15, but what I would say to you is that there are

00:22:14.779 --> 00:22:20.860
many scoffers out there that seek to attack the Word of God. This is nothing new. We understand

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:25.979
that from the very beginning, in Genesis chapter number 3, that the enemy, Satan, says,

00:22:25.979 --> 00:22:34.059
yea, hath God said. And he begins to question the authority of God's spoken Word, so no doubt the

00:22:34.059 --> 00:22:39.899
enemy is going to question the authority of God's written Word. And what does he do? Why do

00:22:39.899 --> 00:22:46.699
these scoffers attack and try to dig in and tell us that there are errors and discrepancies?

00:22:46.699 --> 00:22:52.779
I believe that if they can be successful in doing so, that it puts doubt in the mind of

00:22:52.779 --> 00:22:59.019
the individual to say, how can I know if it's true or not? And ultimately, that's what Satan

00:22:59.019 --> 00:23:04.619
wants to do. Satan wants to have people come to a place where they say, I can't trust this book.

00:23:06.539 --> 00:23:12.539
And there are people that you can come in contact with, no doubt, that will laugh at you, will mock

00:23:13.259 --> 00:23:17.739
when you say that you're a Bible believer, when you say, well, the Bible says,

00:23:17.739 --> 00:23:23.259
because they have believed, they've been blinded by the enemy, and they believe the lie of the

00:23:23.259 --> 00:23:29.500
enemy. So I would say this evening, when someone asks me, is it 400 or 430 years? Yes, it depends

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:34.220
where the starting point is. And if we're starting with Abram, then it's 430. If we're starting with

00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:39.659
Isaac, it's 400. And so that's just kind of a side note. It's for free. If you don't like it,

00:23:39.659 --> 00:23:43.659
you don't have to have it. They gave me some beans at lunch yesterday. I didn't want them.

00:23:43.659 --> 00:23:48.059
They just kind of took them away, you know. But that's for free this evening. I believe that it's

00:23:48.059 --> 00:23:53.259
a valid explanation of the Word of God as you study and compare Scripture with Scripture.

00:23:53.259 --> 00:23:58.459
Notice, so we see these things that are revealed to Abram with regard to the events leading to

00:23:58.459 --> 00:24:02.619
the possession of the land. There's also events that are going to be revealed, as we're noticing

00:24:02.619 --> 00:24:08.619
what is revealed, with regard to the death of Abram. Notice what God says in verse number 15,

00:24:08.619 --> 00:24:14.059
and thou, now he's speaking directly to Abram. He's speaking in verse 13 and 14 about his seed

00:24:14.059 --> 00:24:18.379
and about the land that they would be a stranger in before they would possess the land, how they

00:24:18.379 --> 00:24:23.019
would leave during the exodus. In verse 15, he changes attention back to Abram and says,

00:24:23.019 --> 00:24:31.339
and thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace. Thou shalt be buried in a good old age.

00:24:31.979 --> 00:24:36.540
So now, Abram is getting, God is speaking directly to Abram with regard to

00:24:37.419 --> 00:24:43.260
revealing details about his death. If you look over, hold your place here, turn to the book of,

00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:49.100
excuse me, to chapter 25 in Genesis, and look in chapter 25 in verse number 7, you'll notice

00:24:50.299 --> 00:24:59.339
that certainly Abram was buried at a good old age. The Bible says in Genesis 25 in verse number

00:24:59.339 --> 00:25:05.260
7, and these are the days of the years of Abraham's life, which he lived, and hundred,

00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:13.339
threescore, and fifteen years. That's 175 years old. That's a good old age. And we understand

00:25:13.339 --> 00:25:18.619
that as we look here after the flood, and we've made note of this through our study of the book

00:25:18.619 --> 00:25:25.339
of Genesis, that the patriarchs, obviously, prior to the flood, they had very long lifespans.

00:25:25.979 --> 00:25:32.299
It begins to decrease, and it decreases pretty rapidly after the flood, and just all of the

00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:39.979
catastrophic impact to not only the earth and all of the geological things that took place,

00:25:39.979 --> 00:25:45.739
but also just the environment itself. You get to the end of the book of Genesis, and you read about

00:25:45.739 --> 00:25:53.019
the death of Joseph, and he lived to be 110 years old. And then eventually you get to where God

00:25:53.019 --> 00:25:57.500
speaks to Moses about the threescore and ten and so on and so forth, if by reason of strength,

00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:04.299
fourscore. And here, Abram is given this truth from God with regard to his departure, his death,

00:26:04.299 --> 00:26:12.779
that he would be buried in a good old age of 175 years. Again, in sight is the fact that our God

00:26:12.779 --> 00:26:19.339
is eternal, that our God is omniscient, that he's able to give truth to Abram with regard to his own

00:26:19.339 --> 00:26:27.100
death. Notice with me also that God reveals information to Abram with regard to the judgment

00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:31.100
upon the inhabitants of the land. We see that in verse number 16. It says,

00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:37.899
but in the fourth generation they shall come hither again, for the iniquity of the Amorites

00:26:37.899 --> 00:26:43.019
is not yet full. It's an interesting reference. You begin to look in verses 19 through 21,

00:26:43.019 --> 00:26:47.339
and you begin to see the other groups of people that are mentioned, the Kenites, the Kenizzites,

00:26:47.339 --> 00:26:52.139
the Kadmonites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaims, the Amorites, the Canaanites,

00:26:52.139 --> 00:26:56.779
the Gergesites, and the Jebusites. And you find here that the Amorites are mentioned

00:26:56.779 --> 00:27:02.619
specifically in verse number 16 about this fourth generation, again, this time period in which they

00:27:02.619 --> 00:27:07.979
would come again. And he says that the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full. It's interesting

00:27:07.979 --> 00:27:13.979
because the judgment would come upon the inhabitants of the land. This year, during the

00:27:13.979 --> 00:27:20.059
shutdown and all that was going on, I taught through the book of Joshua. We had those daily

00:27:20.059 --> 00:27:25.179
lessons that we sent out. And one reference that I made to you often throughout the book of Joshua

00:27:25.179 --> 00:27:30.779
is the fact that those inhabitants of the land were being judged because of their wickedness.

00:27:31.419 --> 00:27:36.139
And God had given warning to his people, to Joshua and the children of Israel,

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:43.979
to be careful about their walk with God and their obedience to the revealed Word of God,

00:27:43.979 --> 00:27:49.100
lest they also be judged. And so we find here that he says that the iniquity of the Amorites

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:54.940
is not yet full. In other words, God knew because he's omniscient and he's eternal,

00:27:54.940 --> 00:28:00.299
he knew the timing of what was going to happen. But really, I believe that as he says it's not

00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:05.419
yet full, that God had given them some space, if you will, some time to repent.

00:28:06.139 --> 00:28:14.699
But the inhabitants of the land, they never repented. They continued to go and serve

00:28:14.699 --> 00:28:20.940
idols and live in their wicked behavior. And we find that they eventually would be judged. And our

00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:27.660
God, of course, is the judge. And we understand that. He's gracious and he's merciful, but he is

00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:32.940
the righteous judge. And we understand this evening that as we think about the end times,

00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:37.500
and we think about the judgments, that as the people of God, if you've been born again,

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:41.739
you've trusted Christ as your Savior, that you'll stand at the bema seat of Christ,

00:28:41.739 --> 00:28:46.460
the judgment seat of Christ. But for those that have not trusted Christ as their Savior,

00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:52.299
they will stand at the great white throne judgment, as is revealed to us in Revelation chapter number

00:28:52.299 --> 00:28:59.179
20. And so here, God is referencing the judgment that would come upon the inhabitants of the land.

00:28:59.179 --> 00:29:05.419
We can read of all of those events. Of course, after the Exodus and before the conquering of the

00:29:05.419 --> 00:29:11.500
land, you have the wilderness wanderings. That was never what God's plan was for the nation of

00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:16.140
Israel. But because of their doubt and unbelief, that generation would die in the wilderness.

00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:22.539
Now, we get here as we wrap up the 15th chapter of the book of Genesis, we now come to this,

00:29:22.539 --> 00:29:27.419
what is being revealed with regard to the details of the covenant that God is making

00:29:27.979 --> 00:29:34.700
with Abram. And so we see that he's revealed several things, and now he's coming back to what

00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:40.460
the passage started with that we're looking at this evening. When Abram says to God, after God

00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:46.219
says to give thee this land to inherit it, at the end of verse number 7, that Abram then says,

00:29:46.219 --> 00:29:54.619
Lord God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it? And so God revealed these things to

00:29:54.619 --> 00:30:01.339
him, and now God is going to give him this sign, and he's going to give us details with regard to

00:30:01.339 --> 00:30:02.539
the covenant. Notice in verse

00:30:02.539 --> 00:30:09.499
verse number 17, and it came to pass that when the sun went down and it was dark.

00:30:09.499 --> 00:30:13.459
We notice that in verse number 12 it says when the sun was going down.

00:30:13.459 --> 00:30:18.179
Now the Bible tells us in verse number 17 that the sun went down and it was dark.

00:30:18.179 --> 00:30:25.299
Notice what it says, behold a smoking furnace and a burning lamp that passed between those

00:30:25.299 --> 00:30:26.579
pieces.

00:30:26.579 --> 00:30:27.579
What are the pieces?

00:30:28.019 --> 00:30:32.779
Well those are the animals that had been, God had given that detailed instruction with

00:30:32.779 --> 00:30:37.799
regard to that which was to be brought as we looked in verse number 9, and heifer of

00:30:37.799 --> 00:30:41.739
three years old, a she goat of three years old, a ram of three years old, a turtle dove

00:30:41.739 --> 00:30:46.539
and a young pigeon, and they had been divided and set in the midst, and so the Bible tells

00:30:46.539 --> 00:30:51.939
us in verse number 17 that passed between those pieces.

00:30:51.939 --> 00:30:57.559
Now remember I mentioned to you that the common custom of the day was that both parties that

00:30:57.559 --> 00:31:02.859
were involved in making the covenant or the agreement would pass through those pieces

00:31:02.859 --> 00:31:04.579
that had been divided.

00:31:04.579 --> 00:31:09.519
So both parties would pass through signifying that the covenant is being established and

00:31:09.519 --> 00:31:16.919
symbolically saying if I break the covenant then it is for me to be divided asunder.

00:31:16.919 --> 00:31:23.619
And so we find here in verse number 17 that the manifestation of God passing through is

00:31:23.619 --> 00:31:30.139
a smoking furnace and a burning lamp and it says that it passed between those pieces.

00:31:30.139 --> 00:31:31.299
What's the significance?

00:31:31.299 --> 00:31:37.099
Well the significance is that this Abrahamic covenant, as we often refer to it as, is an

00:31:37.099 --> 00:31:39.359
unconditional covenant.

00:31:39.359 --> 00:31:44.239
This is based upon the goodness, the grace and mercy of God.

00:31:44.239 --> 00:31:50.119
This covenant that is being made has nothing to do with Abraham, it has everything to do

00:31:50.119 --> 00:31:51.519
with God.

00:31:51.519 --> 00:31:55.279
And that's important, it's significant for us to understand that as we think about promises

00:31:55.279 --> 00:32:01.419
in the Word of God, there are conditional promises and there are unconditional promises.

00:32:01.419 --> 00:32:05.799
Some of the conditional promises, some of the most common conditional promises are ones

00:32:05.799 --> 00:32:10.099
that would be categorized as being if-then.

00:32:10.099 --> 00:32:13.219
If you do this, then God will do this.

00:32:13.219 --> 00:32:15.039
That's a conditional promise.

00:32:15.039 --> 00:32:19.359
God's action is a response to our action.

00:32:19.359 --> 00:32:21.719
If you do this, then this is what God's going to do.

00:32:21.719 --> 00:32:24.879
In fact, you could read Proverbs chapter number two and you'll see a whole list of them at

00:32:24.879 --> 00:32:27.399
the beginning of the second chapter of the book of Proverbs.

00:32:27.399 --> 00:32:30.959
If-then, if-then, you'll read right through it and you'll see a number of them.

00:32:30.959 --> 00:32:35.079
And so those are scattered, littered throughout the Word of God and we find also there are

00:32:35.079 --> 00:32:36.759
unconditional promises.

00:32:36.759 --> 00:32:43.599
This covenant that God has made, the significance of the manifestation of God through this smoking

00:32:43.599 --> 00:32:48.719
furnace and this burning lamp passing between the pieces would signify for us this evening

00:32:48.719 --> 00:32:50.759
that this is an unconditional covenant.

00:32:50.759 --> 00:32:56.559
This is a promise that God is making to Abraham with regard to that which had been promised.

00:32:56.559 --> 00:33:02.239
Remember, he says, to give thee this land to inherit it and Abram says to God, whereby

00:33:02.239 --> 00:33:05.819
shall I know that I shall inherit it?

00:33:05.819 --> 00:33:10.599
And so God then passes through those pieces, the manifestation of such as we've mentioned

00:33:10.599 --> 00:33:13.119
already, and he passes through.

00:33:13.119 --> 00:33:15.759
Abram himself, he did not pass through.

00:33:15.759 --> 00:33:16.759
Why?

00:33:16.759 --> 00:33:17.999
Because God is the one making the promise.

00:33:18.279 --> 00:33:22.279
Now, keep that thought and look at a few verses with me in the preceding chapters.

00:33:22.279 --> 00:33:24.719
Actually, let's read verse 18 and then we'll do that.

00:33:24.719 --> 00:33:33.559
In the same day, the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, unto thy seed have I given

00:33:33.559 --> 00:33:40.319
this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates, the Kenites

00:33:40.319 --> 00:33:44.459
and the Kenizzites and the Kadmonites and the Hittites and the Perizzites and the Rephaims

00:33:44.459 --> 00:33:48.899
and the Amorites and the Canaanites and the Gergesites and the Jebusites.

00:33:48.899 --> 00:33:53.299
We see in verse number 18 where we received our title for our message this evening that

00:33:53.299 --> 00:33:58.699
in that same day, the Lord made this covenant with Abram and notice what he said, unto thy

00:33:58.699 --> 00:34:04.019
seed have I given this land.

00:34:04.019 --> 00:34:11.859
Abram says to God in verse number eight, God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit

00:34:11.859 --> 00:34:12.979
it?

00:34:12.979 --> 00:34:13.979
What is it?

00:34:13.979 --> 00:34:19.859
The land, as it's mentioned in verse number seven, to give this land, to give thee this

00:34:19.859 --> 00:34:21.259
land to inherit it.

00:34:21.259 --> 00:34:25.339
And so God then answers that request that Abram made at the beginning of our study this

00:34:25.339 --> 00:34:27.059
evening.

00:34:27.059 --> 00:34:33.979
He passes through giving Abram the sign that this is the sign, I've made this covenant,

00:34:33.979 --> 00:34:41.379
this promise with you that I now am telling you I have given this land to your seed.

00:34:41.379 --> 00:34:46.659
Now it's interesting because now we're speaking in terms that it's already settled.

00:34:46.659 --> 00:34:52.419
It says unto thee have I given this land.

00:34:52.419 --> 00:34:57.499
Prior to this verse of Scripture, everything that is spoken of with regard to the land

00:34:57.499 --> 00:34:59.779
is spoken of in future.

00:34:59.779 --> 00:35:01.499
I'm going to give this to you.

00:35:01.499 --> 00:35:04.939
Now he says I have given you this land.

00:35:04.939 --> 00:35:08.299
Notice with me, turn back if you will to chapter number 12.

00:35:08.299 --> 00:35:12.339
We did this last week as we looked at the promise with regard to the seed, but look

00:35:12.339 --> 00:35:17.279
at it now as the passage in Genesis 15 shifts from seed to land.

00:35:17.279 --> 00:35:22.539
We find in verse number seven of Genesis 12, the Bible says, and the Lord appeared unto

00:35:22.539 --> 00:35:29.219
Abram and said, unto thy seed will I give this land.

00:35:29.219 --> 00:35:30.819
That's future, correct?

00:35:30.819 --> 00:35:33.099
Will I give this land?

00:35:33.099 --> 00:35:36.699
And there builded he an altar unto the Lord who appeared unto him.

00:35:36.699 --> 00:35:40.319
Abram then responded to that promise by worshiping the Lord.

00:35:40.319 --> 00:35:44.659
We see in chapter number 13, look in verse number 15.

00:35:44.659 --> 00:35:48.299
This is after the division between Abram and Lot.

00:35:48.299 --> 00:35:53.499
And we know that Lot went toward the plain and pitched his tent towards Sodom.

00:35:53.499 --> 00:35:59.259
And the Lord then says to Abram in verse number 14, he says this, and the Lord said unto Abram,

00:35:59.259 --> 00:36:02.739
after that Lot was separated from him, lift up now thine eyes and look from the place

00:36:02.739 --> 00:36:08.779
where thou art northward and southward and eastward and westward for all the land which

00:36:08.779 --> 00:36:15.619
thou seest to thee will I give it and to thy seed forever.

00:36:15.619 --> 00:36:19.579
We see again in verse number 17, it says, arise, walk through the land and the length

00:36:19.579 --> 00:36:24.339
of it and in the breadth of it, for I will give it unto thee.

00:36:24.339 --> 00:36:29.339
In chapter number 15, as we started our message this evening in verse number seven, God says

00:36:29.339 --> 00:36:36.779
to Abram and he said unto him, I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees

00:36:36.779 --> 00:36:41.699
to give thee this land to inherit it.

00:36:41.699 --> 00:36:47.299
And now Abram says, God, in verse number eight, he's asking for that sign.

00:36:47.299 --> 00:36:48.299
That's what's requested.

00:36:48.299 --> 00:36:51.459
Whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?

00:36:51.459 --> 00:36:57.379
And God goes through this, what was a common practice, a custom in that particular day

00:36:57.379 --> 00:37:02.739
in those making covenants and God himself, the manifestation through the smoking furnace

00:37:02.739 --> 00:37:09.499
and the burning lamp, he passes through those pieces and he says to Abram, unto thy seed

00:37:09.499 --> 00:37:13.179
have I given this land.

00:37:13.179 --> 00:37:17.579
What a great promise that God gives to Abram on this particular day.

00:37:17.579 --> 00:37:20.659
Now we understand the significance of the Abrahamic covenant.

00:37:20.659 --> 00:37:26.419
We understand that here the specifics are given with regard to the territory.

00:37:26.459 --> 00:37:31.459
He says there at the end of verse number 18, from the river of Egypt unto the great river,

00:37:31.459 --> 00:37:32.899
the river Euphrates.

00:37:32.899 --> 00:37:38.119
He then lists out a number of people groups that are mentioned in verses 19 through 21.

00:37:38.119 --> 00:37:43.539
And we find this significance with regard to the territory that God has given.

00:37:43.539 --> 00:37:49.179
As we've looked at this 15th chapter and we dealt with the two aspects of the Abrahamic

00:37:49.179 --> 00:37:53.899
covenant, we see first of all the seed and we understand the birth of Isaac that would

00:37:53.899 --> 00:37:59.939
come later on here in the book of Genesis as we begin to read about that miraculous

00:37:59.939 --> 00:38:07.739
birth and how God was fulfilling the promise that he made to Abram and Sarah.

00:38:07.739 --> 00:38:09.939
And we see that in chapter number 21.

00:38:09.939 --> 00:38:14.679
But of course we understand the fullness of that Abrahamic covenant and that promise with

00:38:14.679 --> 00:38:18.379
regard to the seed is the Lord Jesus.

00:38:18.379 --> 00:38:21.299
We find that Paul mentions that in the book of Galatians.

00:38:21.299 --> 00:38:26.139
If you want to take a moment to turn there, we referenced this last week briefly and we'll

00:38:26.139 --> 00:38:27.699
reference it again this evening.

00:38:27.699 --> 00:38:34.059
We see in Galatians chapter number 3 that as the reference to Genesis chapter number

00:38:34.059 --> 00:38:39.099
15 in verse number 6 is seen in Galatians 3 and verse number 6.

00:38:39.099 --> 00:38:43.659
The Bible says even as Abraham believed God and it was accounted to him for righteousness.

00:38:43.659 --> 00:38:47.940
And we find it in verse number 16 of Galatians 3.

00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:48.940
It says,

00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:53.259
Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made.

00:38:53.259 --> 00:39:03.719
He saith not unto seeds as of many, but as of one, and to thy seed, which is Christ.

00:39:03.719 --> 00:39:07.619
And so we understood as we studied through the 15th chapter of the book of Genesis over

00:39:07.619 --> 00:39:13.279
these last few weeks and really over the last few chapters of the book of Genesis that this

00:39:13.899 --> 00:39:18.880
promise has been given to Abram and it's a seed and it's a land and we focus upon that

00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:20.599
seed and we see that as Christ.

00:39:20.599 --> 00:39:26.799
Now you understand as you go from this portion of scripture in Genesis 12 through 15 and

00:39:26.799 --> 00:39:28.599
look at how God zeros in.

00:39:28.599 --> 00:39:31.359
Remember he starts in Genesis with creation.

00:39:31.359 --> 00:39:35.519
He looks at the creation of man, all of the different groups of people.

00:39:35.519 --> 00:39:39.399
You see the tower of Babel, the spreading of the people and so on and so forth.

00:39:39.399 --> 00:39:46.119
And then God zeros in upon Abram and the Hebrew people and that will be the direction

00:39:46.119 --> 00:39:50.299
in which the book of Genesis and really all of scripture begins to travel.

00:39:50.299 --> 00:39:54.979
There are references that are provided to us with regard to other people groups as they

00:39:54.979 --> 00:39:57.239
interact with God's people.

00:39:57.239 --> 00:39:58.239
But why?

00:39:58.239 --> 00:39:59.239
What's the significance?

00:39:59.239 --> 00:40:00.759
Well, that's the seed.

00:40:00.759 --> 00:40:02.559
That's where Messiah would come from.

00:40:02.559 --> 00:40:08.619
come through the line the messianic line and the significance of all that you

00:40:08.619 --> 00:40:12.159
read of and you think about the spiritual warfare that were engaged in

00:40:12.159 --> 00:40:18.599
the spiritual battles that Satan has spent all of those years as recorded in

00:40:18.599 --> 00:40:24.139
the Old Testament to try to defile and destroy that line so that that Messiah

00:40:24.139 --> 00:40:29.739
would not be able to come. Why is it that that Haman so hated Mordecai? Was it

00:40:29.739 --> 00:40:33.699
just because of Mordecai? Why was it that Haman wouldn't be satisfied with

00:40:33.699 --> 00:40:39.059
simply killing the one that would not bow down? No, he wanted to destroy all the

00:40:39.059 --> 00:40:46.179
Jews and you see the enemy, Satan, working to try to destroy the promised line, the

00:40:46.179 --> 00:40:51.099
seed. There's also the significance with regard to the land. God had promised them

00:40:51.099 --> 00:40:55.299
this land and you find the territorial battles that have taken place not only

00:40:55.379 --> 00:40:59.899
biblically but even still to this very day. The battles that take place with

00:40:59.899 --> 00:41:04.739
regard to the land that God promised to his people Israel and you find that

00:41:04.739 --> 00:41:09.059
throughout the scriptures the the borders of Israel, the children of

00:41:09.059 --> 00:41:13.259
Israel, they were large and they shrunk and they were all kind of all over the

00:41:13.259 --> 00:41:17.459
place throughout their history depending on the particular kings and so on and so

00:41:17.459 --> 00:41:22.099
forth. They never had really reached the fullness of the potential of what God

00:41:22.099 --> 00:41:26.819
outlines in Genesis chapter number 15. The closest they ever came is during the

00:41:26.819 --> 00:41:31.779
reign of David and that of Solomon. In fact if you look during the time of

00:41:31.779 --> 00:41:37.339
Solomon's reign when God had given rest and after the all of those amazing

00:41:37.339 --> 00:41:40.619
things that had taken place during of course the reign of David and then

00:41:40.619 --> 00:41:45.459
entering into the reign of Solomon that God had given rest from from those

00:41:45.459 --> 00:41:50.579
enemies and so on and so forth. But the fullness of this promise with regard to

00:41:50.579 --> 00:41:55.379
the territory that is described in Genesis 15 and verse number 18 will

00:41:55.379 --> 00:42:00.459
ultimately be fulfilled during the millennial reign of Christ. And so you

00:42:00.459 --> 00:42:05.139
begin to see that all the way back in Genesis chapter number 15 how you see so

00:42:05.139 --> 00:42:11.779
many years of time that are being referenced not only with regard to the

00:42:11.779 --> 00:42:16.300
people of Israel, the events leading to the possession of the land, the time of

00:42:16.339 --> 00:42:21.819
Abraham's life of course and his depart his death, but also we see the fullness

00:42:21.819 --> 00:42:28.139
of the millennial reign of Christ that seed that is mentioned being Christ in

00:42:28.139 --> 00:42:33.020
Galatians chapter 3 and during the time in which he will physically rule

00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:37.819
and reign on this earth for a thousand years. Now we're not there yet we've not

00:42:37.819 --> 00:42:41.459
reached the millennium of course we're going to have the rapture of the church

00:42:41.459 --> 00:42:44.459
will take place and the Great Tribulation and then the millennial reign

00:42:44.459 --> 00:42:49.179
of Christ. It will happen and we don't know the time in which it will happen we

00:42:49.179 --> 00:42:53.259
know that it's at least seven years and a few moments away because there's seven

00:42:53.259 --> 00:42:57.099
years of tribulation and the return of the Lord could happen at any moment and

00:42:57.099 --> 00:43:01.699
and that's when that timeline will begin. And so we find that here as we look at

00:43:01.699 --> 00:43:07.059
this passage of Scripture what an exciting opportunity to see that in the

00:43:07.059 --> 00:43:11.660
life of Abram that God has given these promises he told her about the seed he

00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:15.139
took him out he said look up in the stars look toward the heaven if you can

00:43:15.139 --> 00:43:20.899
number them and he says so shall thy seed be. Then he says by the way I'm the

00:43:20.899 --> 00:43:24.419
Lord that brought you out of the earth the Chaldees to give thee this land to

00:43:24.419 --> 00:43:30.139
inherit it and Abram says whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it and God

00:43:30.139 --> 00:43:35.220
gives them this sign after he reveals these details he gives them this sign by

00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:40.580
he alone passing through those pieces that were divided showing us the fact

00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:45.459
that this is an unconditional covenant. These things were not based upon

00:43:45.459 --> 00:43:50.099
anything that Abram would do anything that he would offer any gifts that he

00:43:50.099 --> 00:43:54.739
would bring and we understand that salvation for a child of God is all

00:43:54.739 --> 00:44:00.020
based on the grace and mercy of God and it's important that we wrap up in that

00:44:00.020 --> 00:44:04.380
fashion this evening. We understand the Bible says for by grace are you saved

00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:08.059
through faith and that not of yourselves is the gift of God not of works lest any

00:44:08.099 --> 00:44:12.539
man should boast and we understand this evening that our God is gracious and he

00:44:12.539 --> 00:44:16.979
is merciful he's full of compassion and he is the Savior of the world and the

00:44:16.979 --> 00:44:21.100
reality this evening is that as we think about the truth of salvation we ought to

00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:24.459
rejoice in the fact that it has everything to do with what the Lord

00:44:24.459 --> 00:44:29.179
Jesus Christ did on the cross of Calvary apart from anything that you could offer

00:44:29.179 --> 00:44:33.220
why because I can't there's nothing good enough that I could do to earn his

00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:40.220
merit to earn his salvation it is the gift of God not by not by our works of

00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:44.820
righteousness the Bible says that the wages of sin is death but the gift of

00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:48.940
God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord I'm so thankful that Jesus said

00:44:48.940 --> 00:44:54.619
on the cross of Calvary it is finished he paid for your sin and for my sin he

00:44:54.619 --> 00:44:58.579
paid for the sin of the world and we find that the truth of salvation the

00:44:58.579 --> 00:45:02.700
promise that God has given with regard to salvation in like manner to this

00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:06.700
promise that he gave to Abram in Genesis chapter number 15 it has nothing

00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:10.500
to do with anything that we would do other than just simply believing and

00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:14.899
receiving and receive that great promise that he said for whosoever shall call

00:45:14.899 --> 00:45:20.619
upon the name of the Lord shall be saved I'm so thankful for the truth of

00:45:20.619 --> 00:45:25.419
salvation this evening as we understand the foundational aspect I understand it

00:45:25.419 --> 00:45:31.019
was more teachy this evening but as we understand the foundational the the

00:45:31.019 --> 00:45:36.980
impact of Genesis chapter 15 it will help us to understand the events that

00:45:36.980 --> 00:45:40.619
take place within the next pages of Scripture not only here in the book of

00:45:40.619 --> 00:45:44.779
Genesis but throughout the whole of Scripture with regard to this covenant

00:45:44.779 --> 00:45:51.220
that God made with Abram it is a significant event that helps if we don't

00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:56.339
fully comprehend and understand this event in Genesis 15 it really hinders us

00:45:56.339 --> 00:46:00.859
from a proper understanding of future things that will be detailed and dealt

00:46:00.859 --> 00:46:04.980
with throughout the Word of God and that's why the book of Genesis is so

00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:10.260
foundational and I believe that's why the book of Genesis is under such great

00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:16.739
attack because it's so foundational to understanding the whole of Scripture let

00:46:16.739 --> 00:46:20.419
us pray together father we love you this evening we thank you for loving us we

00:46:20.419 --> 00:46:25.419
thank you for the Word of God the truth contained therein we thank you for this

00:46:25.419 --> 00:46:31.419
truth that you gave us in Genesis 15 that sets the firm foundation with

00:46:31.419 --> 00:46:36.940
regard to your dealings with the the children of Israel with the Hebrews the

00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:41.500
Jewish race and as we begin to study throughout the rest of this book and

00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:46.059
even the whole of Scripture and we see just your interactions and your dealings

00:46:46.059 --> 00:46:49.260
and Lord we thank you for this covenant that was made with Abram on this

00:46:49.260 --> 00:46:54.899
particular day and in its significance I pray that you would help us to rejoice

00:46:54.899 --> 00:47:00.299
in the fact that you are eternal and omniscient that you are able to with

00:47:00.299 --> 00:47:07.019
specific detail lay out events that will happen generations to come even as we

00:47:07.019 --> 00:47:11.660
see here in the life of Abram because you are eternal and because you are

00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:16.980
omniscient I pray God that you'd help us to rest in that and help us to find just

00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:21.779
have our faith increased and to find great encouragement through those truths

00:47:21.779 --> 00:47:25.419
this evening I pray God that if there's one that has never trusted the Lord

00:47:25.419 --> 00:47:29.179
Jesus Christ as their personal Savior they do not know for sure if they were

00:47:29.179 --> 00:47:32.660
denied today that heaven is their home I pray God that they'd understand the

00:47:32.660 --> 00:47:36.940
truth of salvation redemption through the blood of Christ that Jesus Christ

00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:41.459
the Son of God went to that cruel cross he suffered and bled and died he was

00:47:41.459 --> 00:47:44.980
buried in a borrowed tomb and he rose in victory conquering sin death in the

00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:51.339
grave he said he declared it is finished and I pray this evening that if there's

00:47:51.339 --> 00:47:55.459
one under the sound of my voice whether they're here present in our auditorium

00:47:55.459 --> 00:47:59.100
or they're watching online that they never have trusted Christ as their

00:47:59.100 --> 00:48:03.940
Savior that they would understand the promise of redemption the gift of God

00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:08.339
which is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord and that today is the

00:48:08.339 --> 00:48:12.220
day of salvation the Bible declares for whosoever shall call upon the name of

00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:17.059
the Lord shall be saved have your will and way in these moments of invitation

00:48:17.059 --> 00:48:19.859
and we'll thank you for all that you'll do for it's in Christ's name we pray
