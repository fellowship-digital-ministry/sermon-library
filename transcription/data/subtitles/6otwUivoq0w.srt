1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,440
Genesis chapter number 32, and this is, it's been a long time since we've been in the

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,440
book of Genesis.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:11,600
It was last, right before our missions conference last year, and we had Sunday evening before

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:16,280
missions conference in the book of Genesis, and then we had missions conference and then

5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:21,920
got into the summer months, and I've been dealing with, since then, Ask the Pastor.

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,239
There were a lot of questions that were submitted for Ask the Pastor, and it took a whole lot

7
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:27,479
longer than I expected.

8
00:00:27,479 --> 00:00:29,239
I actually didn't even answer all of them.

9
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:36,200
I saved a handful for this summer, and we'll have that as a summer Sunday evening series

10
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,720
again this upcoming summer.

11
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:43,599
But this is message number 71 in the book of Genesis, and it's back from May when we

12
00:00:43,599 --> 00:00:48,759
finished up chapter number 31, and so as we look at chapter number 32 in the title for

13
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:52,759
the message this evening, as you see on the back of the bulletin, is Jacob prepares to

14
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:53,759
meet Esau.

15
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:57,639
Before we get into the passage here in Genesis chapter number 32, it's important for us to

16
00:00:57,639 --> 00:01:02,919
understand, really, the backdrop and all that had taken place in previous years.

17
00:01:02,919 --> 00:01:08,319
We understand that the circumstances surrounding Jacob's departure from Beersheba were marked

18
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:10,120
with much tension.

19
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:13,480
You'll remember that Esau was to be blessed by Isaac.

20
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,279
It was, that was the desire.

21
00:01:15,279 --> 00:01:19,800
Isaac had given the instruction for Esau to go out and to bring him some venison, like

22
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,000
he enjoyed, and that he would give him a blessing.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,800
And we know that through a series of events that Jacob was the one that received the blessing.

24
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:32,639
In fact, if you turn back to Genesis chapter 27, I'll mark a couple of verses as we study

25
00:01:32,639 --> 00:01:38,480
through and kind of catch up to where we are here in Genesis chapter number 32.

26
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,800
But we find that Jacob receives the blessing.

27
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,919
You'll remember that Esau comes in, and Esau wept.

28
00:01:44,919 --> 00:01:49,720
He was very bothered by the situation, and he desired for a blessing.

29
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:57,839
And Esau was angry because of what had transpired, and Esau intended to slay Jacob after the

30
00:01:57,839 --> 00:02:03,400
days of mourning for Isaac were fulfilled, excuse me, for Jacob there.

31
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:09,320
The Bible tells us that Isaac and, or Esau and Jacob, that situation, there's obviously

32
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,320
some tension there.

33
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:16,160
And notice in verse number 41, Esau said this, it says, Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing

34
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:22,479
wherewith his father blessed him, and Esau said in his heart, the days of mourning for

35
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:30,199
my father at hand, notice what he says, then will I slay my brother Jacob.

36
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:35,360
And so these words of Esau, her elder son, were told to Rebekah, and she sent and called

37
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,639
Jacob her younger son and said unto him, behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort

38
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:43,199
himself, purposing to kill thee.

39
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:47,600
Now therefore, my son, obey my voice and arise, notice what she says, flee thou to

40
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:53,639
Laban my brother, to Haran, and it says this in verse 44, and tarry with him, notice this,

41
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:59,679
a few days, until thy brother's fury turn away.

42
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:02,979
We find that Rebekah provides this instruction to Jacob.

43
00:03:02,979 --> 00:03:07,119
She was also the one that provided the instruction to Jacob with regard to providing the meal

44
00:03:07,119 --> 00:03:09,679
by which he would receive the blessing.

45
00:03:09,679 --> 00:03:15,119
And she says, flee to my brother Laban and go for a few days.

46
00:03:15,119 --> 00:03:17,119
Jacob departed as he was instructed.

47
00:03:17,119 --> 00:03:23,000
We find that in Genesis chapter number 28, he's given instruction from Isaac.

48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,919
Isaac gives him a blessing and charges him with regard to his departure, and Jacob departs

49
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:31,720
from Beersheba and heads toward Haran.

50
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:36,800
The Bible tells us that as he was receiving that instruction as he departed, that he then

51
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:43,039
would be in that region with Laban for 20 years.

52
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:51,000
A few days, she said, 20 years, that's a long time, that's a very long time.

53
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,919
We find that after 20 years, he's then going to depart from Paddan Aram, and as he's planning

54
00:03:56,919 --> 00:04:01,440
to return to the land of his fathers per the instruction of the Lord, we find that the

55
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,580
departure from Paddan Aram was also marked by some excitement.

56
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:12,800
We read of and studied in Genesis chapter number 31 as we ended our study last May in

57
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:17,480
this chapter, and remember that after they departed, that Laban comes and he gathers

58
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:22,239
and he finds them and he comes and there's a confrontation that takes place.

59
00:04:22,239 --> 00:04:27,920
And God had appeared to Laban and told Laban that he was not to do anything to Jacob, he's

60
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,420
not to cause him any harm and what have you.

61
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:36,940
And so we find that at the end of that confrontation and all that interaction that took place in

62
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:43,220
chapter 31, we then come to chapter number 32 where Jacob is still leaving, he's left

63
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:49,059
Paddan Aram, he's heading back to the land of his fathers, and he's planning to reunite

64
00:04:49,059 --> 00:04:51,140
with Esau.

65
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:58,059
Twenty years earlier, Esau said, I'm going to mourn the death of my father and I'm going

66
00:04:58,059 --> 00:04:59,859
to kill my brother.

67
00:04:59,859 --> 00:05:01,820
That's what he intended to do.

68
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:07,459
Twenty years had passed and now Jacob is preparing to meet his brother.

69
00:05:07,459 --> 00:05:13,140
Notice in verse number one of Genesis 32, the Bible says, and Jacob went on his way

70
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,820
and the angels of God met him.

71
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:20,880
When Jacob saw them, he said, this is God's host and he called the name of that place

72
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,179
Mahanaim.

73
00:05:23,179 --> 00:05:28,619
And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau, his brother, under the land of Seir, the country

74
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:29,619
of Edom.

75
00:05:29,619 --> 00:05:34,779
And he commanded them saying, thus shall you speak unto my lord Esau, thy servant Jacob

76
00:05:34,779 --> 00:05:40,619
saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban and stayed there until now.

77
00:05:40,619 --> 00:05:44,660
And I have oxen and asses, flocks and men's servants, and women's servants, and I have

78
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:50,980
sent to tell my lord, notice the way it says, that I may find grace in thy sight.

79
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:56,260
We'll read down through this passage of Scripture this evening to verse number 23, we'll deal

80
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:00,820
with the remainder of chapter 32 next Sunday evening, but as we're looking at this text

81
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:04,380
of Scripture, if you're taking notes this evening, I want you to notice number one,

82
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,779
the preparation of Jacob.

83
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:07,779
The preparation of Jacob.

84
00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:14,899
In the first eight verses of Genesis 32, God provides for us a record of Jacob's preparation

85
00:06:14,899 --> 00:06:19,940
as he plans for this meeting, this reunion with his brother Esau.

86
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:24,179
We find that in verse number three that the Bible tells us that Jacob sent messengers

87
00:06:24,179 --> 00:06:25,420
before him.

88
00:06:25,579 --> 00:06:27,140
He's trying to prepare the way.

89
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:32,059
He's got these servants, these messengers that are going to take word to his brother

90
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:37,660
Esau, and we find that as he sends these messengers, that he sends them with a specific message.

91
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:43,899
In verses four and five, we find that as he would give these servants of his, these messengers,

92
00:06:43,899 --> 00:06:49,619
this specific message that he records for us, or God records for us, how it is that

93
00:06:49,619 --> 00:06:56,100
he commanded his servants, his messengers, to bring this specific message to Esau.

94
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,980
Notice if you will, how Jacob said to refer to Esau.

95
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:05,299
Notice in verse number four, and he commanded them saying, thus shall you speak unto my

96
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:09,579
Lord Esau.

97
00:07:09,579 --> 00:07:15,540
You notice how he says to refer to Esau is my Lord, but also notice how he refers to

98
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,540
himself.

99
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:22,420
In verse number four, thy servant Jacob.

100
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:28,619
He says, thus shall you speak unto my Lord Esau, thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have

101
00:07:28,619 --> 00:07:33,299
sojourned with Laban and stayed there until now.

102
00:07:33,299 --> 00:07:39,619
We notice, of course, as you would look back at the blessing that God had given to Isaac,

103
00:07:39,619 --> 00:07:45,420
and we mentioned very briefly of that interaction in chapter number 27, but if you were to look

104
00:07:45,459 --> 00:07:50,500
back there in that passage of Scripture, and notice in verse number 33 of Genesis 27, the

105
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:54,260
Bible says that Isaac trembled very exceedingly and said, who?

106
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,980
This is when Esau comes in.

107
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:59,380
He says, where is he that hath taken venison and brought it me, and I have eaten of all

108
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:04,059
before thou camest, and have blessed him, yea, and he shall be blessed.

109
00:08:04,059 --> 00:08:07,940
When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry,

110
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:11,660
and said unto his father, bless me, even me also, my father.

111
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:15,220
And he said, thy brother came with subtlety, and hath taken away thy blessing, and he said,

112
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:19,260
is not he rightly named Jacob?

113
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:22,459
For he hath supplanted me these two times, he took away my birthright, and behold, now

114
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:28,640
he hath taken away my blessing, and he said, hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?

115
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:33,099
Notice what it says in verse 37, and Isaac answered and said unto Esau, behold, I have

116
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:35,299
made him, who's him?

117
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:36,739
Jacob, right?

118
00:08:36,739 --> 00:08:40,140
I've made him, what's it say?

119
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,140
Thy Lord.

120
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:44,919
That's what it says.

121
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:50,119
And all his brethren have I given to him for, what's it say?

122
00:08:50,119 --> 00:08:53,280
Servants, is that what your Bible says?

123
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,280
That's what my Bible says.

124
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:59,520
My Bible says in verse 37, follow along with me there in Genesis 27, verse 37, Isaac answered

125
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:05,400
and said unto Esau, Esau says, dad, is there not a blessing for me?

126
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:13,440
And Isaac says to Esau, behold, I have made him, your brother, Jacob, I have made him

127
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,239
thy Lord.

128
00:09:16,239 --> 00:09:20,440
And all his brethren, that includes Esau, correct?

129
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,440
Yes or no?

130
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,440
Talk to me tonight.

131
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,940
Absolutely, right?

132
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:31,080
He says, and all his brethren have I given to him for what?

133
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,559
Servants.

134
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:37,400
But what does Jacob say to his messengers to go to Esau with?

135
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:44,799
He says, refer to Esau as my Lord, and refer to myself as thy servant.

136
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:49,900
That's actually reverse of the blessing and the instruction that God gave in Genesis 27.

137
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:56,599
I do see, however, a measure of humility within the life of Jacob here in this text of Scripture.

138
00:09:56,599 --> 00:09:59,520
Jacob, of course, is fearful.

139
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,039
He's going back.

140
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:05,039
home and Esau is ready to kill him, right? Last time he was there, why did he flee in

141
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:12,079
the first place? He fled in the first place because Esau is going to kill him. So he fled.

142
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:17,439
Now God, and we'll look at this in just a few moments, now God has divinely directed

143
00:10:17,439 --> 00:10:23,599
for Jacob to return. But he knows in so doing that he is going to meet Esau. And the last

144
00:10:23,599 --> 00:10:27,879
time he was there, Esau is going to kill him. And so he's concerned. I believe that he's

145
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:33,039
genuine in this in Genesis chapter 32 when he's sending these messengers with this message.

146
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:39,239
But we have to understand that God is sovereign. And God gave that blessing and God was in

147
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:45,839
control. And we find here that he sends this, not only does he give instruction with regard

148
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:51,079
to how to refer to Esau, how to refer to himself, he tells us in verse number five, he mentions

149
00:10:51,079 --> 00:10:55,679
about the blessing of the Lord and how much substance he had received. And during that

150
00:10:55,679 --> 00:11:02,239
20 years where they had been separated one from the other, how God had blessed him. And

151
00:11:02,239 --> 00:11:06,199
he records that in verse number five. But then we find that he has this desire that

152
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:11,119
he might find grace in the sight of Esau. The messengers returned to Jacob, according

153
00:11:11,119 --> 00:11:15,999
to verse number six. And we find that as these messengers returned to Jacob, that they bring

154
00:11:15,999 --> 00:11:20,479
him a message that he's not really too excited to receive. For the Bible tells us that they

155
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:25,619
returned to Jacob saying, we came to thy brother Esau, notice what it says, and also he cometh

156
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:36,139
to meet thee and 400 men with him. We know the entirety of this passage. Many of us are

157
00:11:36,139 --> 00:11:42,539
familiar with Genesis 32 and 33. And we see in chapter 33 the reunion. What a reunion

158
00:11:42,539 --> 00:11:47,739
it is, by the way. But I want you to think about Jacob just for a moment. These messengers

159
00:11:47,739 --> 00:11:51,999
come back and they say, oh, we went with the message that you gave us to give. And by the

160
00:11:51,999 --> 00:11:55,839
way, when we went, Esau was coming to meet you. And oh, by the way, he's got 400 men

161
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:02,079
with him. What are you thinking if you're Jacob? Probably thinking he's coming to kill

162
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:10,479
you. I mean, that's a natural response of interpreting those circumstances that he's

163
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:16,239
seeing. We find that the Bible tells us in verse number seven, then after Jacob received

164
00:12:16,239 --> 00:12:24,119
this news from his messengers, notice what it says, then Jacob was greatly afraid and

165
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:32,199
distressed. He was greatly afraid and distressed. You know, throughout the Bible, God tells

166
00:12:32,199 --> 00:12:38,199
us over and over to fear not. But the reality is that as human beings, there are times that

167
00:12:38,199 --> 00:12:45,399
we fear. It's an emotion that we have. God made us. He knows that we're emotional people.

168
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:49,759
And he knows that one of the emotions that we have is fear. There are things that happen

169
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:53,439
in your life. There are things that happen in my life. There are things that happen in

170
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:59,039
the lives of those that are recorded for us in the pages of Scripture that those circumstances

171
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:07,719
led to fear. They led to fear. The sin is not so much in being afraid. The sin is what

172
00:13:07,719 --> 00:13:13,999
happens after that immediate fear. Do I stay? Do I remain in a state of fear? Do I allow

173
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:22,599
fear to control me? Do I allow fear to trump what God has said in his Word? Or do I have

174
00:13:22,599 --> 00:13:30,479
the eye of faith and do I trust the Lord? Do I turn to God? Do I trust him in the moment

175
00:13:30,479 --> 00:13:36,839
when fear creeps in? I remember, and I think I did not do any research on this, but I would

176
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:43,639
assume the company still exists. But I remember while I was in high school, there was a particular

177
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:50,519
clothing line that made clothes that we would, a lot of things sports-wise, attire. And it

178
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:57,039
was called No Fear. No Fear. And they'd have certain things on them. And I played baseball

179
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:05,239
very competitively. And in Nevada, as a baseball, our team, we won state playoffs. And my sophomore

180
00:14:05,239 --> 00:14:09,679
year we were very competitive. And we used to have a shirt that we had made up that said

181
00:14:09,719 --> 00:14:13,639
No Fear Serpent Baseball because we were the Mineral County Serpents. That was the name

182
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:18,399
of our team. That was our mascot. But the reality is that as many times as people want

183
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,679
to put no fear on things and talk about it, everybody that I know has gotten some kind

184
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:33,999
of fear. Right? People that say, I'm not afraid of anything. You're lying, man. I'm just telling

185
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:44,639
you. You're lying. The sin is not in being afraid. It's how we handle it. What happens?

186
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:52,479
Listen, Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed. I would argue that most of us, if we were

187
00:14:52,479 --> 00:14:59,199
in this same situation, given the same exact circumstances, where we knew that somebody

188
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:04,039
wanted to kill us, we were separated from them for 20 years, and we're going to reunite

189
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:11,759
with them, and we find out they're coming to meet us with 400 people, I'm afraid. I'm

190
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:21,119
afraid. But I want you to notice what Jacob does. The Bible tells us in verse number 7

191
00:15:21,119 --> 00:15:26,559
that Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed. He divided the people that was with him and

192
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:32,359
the flocks and herds, the camels, into two bands and said, if Esau come to the one company

193
00:15:32,359 --> 00:15:36,959
and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape. So we find that he made

194
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:41,479
some preparations there. But then as we continue through the passage of Scripture, if you're

195
00:15:41,479 --> 00:15:45,639
taking notes, notice number 2 with me. We see number 1, the preparation of Jacob in

196
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:54,839
verses 1-8. Number 2, the prayer of Jacob in verses 9-12. In verses 9-12, we see that

197
00:15:54,839 --> 00:16:01,719
Jacob responds in prayer. The Bible says in verse number 9, and Jacob said, O God of

198
00:16:01,719 --> 00:16:10,439
my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, the Lord which said unto me, return unto thy

199
00:16:10,439 --> 00:16:16,679
country and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee. Notice what he says in verse

200
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:22,059
number 10. Again, we see this measure of humility. By the way, in Jacob's life, there was many

201
00:16:22,059 --> 00:16:26,099
times where you did not see much humility in his life, but we find that he says this

202
00:16:26,099 --> 00:16:31,539
in verse number 10 as he continues to pray. I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies

203
00:16:31,539 --> 00:16:36,099
and of all the truth which thou hast showed unto thy servant. For with my staff I passed

204
00:16:36,099 --> 00:16:41,659
over this Jordan, and now I am become two bands. You know, we're not worthy of God's

205
00:16:41,659 --> 00:16:52,979
blessing. We really aren't. God's grace, God's mercy, what a blessing. I'm so thankful

206
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:59,179
to be adopted in the family of God. I'm so thankful to be a child of the King, join heirs

207
00:16:59,179 --> 00:17:03,459
with Jesus. That's what the Bible tells us. It's all because of His grace, all because

208
00:17:03,459 --> 00:17:08,219
of His mercy. I didn't deserve it. You didn't deserve it. I'm not worthy of it. You're not

209
00:17:08,219 --> 00:17:15,619
worthy of it. But God's grace, God's mercy, His love for us. Jacob says this in verse

210
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:21,059
number 11, deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau,

211
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:26,299
for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me and the mother with the children. Listen,

212
00:17:26,299 --> 00:17:32,699
when you're afraid, God already knows that you're afraid. Does He know everything? Yes.

213
00:17:32,699 --> 00:17:37,579
So what kind of sense does it make for us to be afraid and then act like we're not?

214
00:17:37,579 --> 00:17:46,539
God knows. And He says specifically, I fear him. Deliver me. What is He thinking? No doubt

215
00:17:46,539 --> 00:17:53,099
in my mind that Jacob responds to this situation and he's thinking worst case scenario. By

216
00:17:53,099 --> 00:17:58,819
the way, sometimes some of us, some more than others, are worst case scenario thinkers.

217
00:17:58,819 --> 00:18:02,699
You know what I mean by that? Something happens, it's worst case scenario. I mean, you got

218
00:18:02,699 --> 00:18:06,179
a little sound in your car and it's like the whole thing needs to be replaced, the engine's

219
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:10,099
just falling out. I mean, the whole deal's just, you know what I mean? Just worst case

220
00:18:10,099 --> 00:18:14,459
scenario kind of people. You got a little ache over here and you're like, oh man, who

221
00:18:14,459 --> 00:18:20,499
knows what the doctor's going to say, right? And sometimes we're just worst case scenario.

222
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:25,979
That's how Jacob is looking at this situation. He's, I am afraid. But listen, what's he doing?

223
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:33,539
He's letting God know. He's being transparent with God. Again, God already knows. He knows

224
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:37,739
your heart. He knows your thoughts. He knows your fears. And so Jacob is coming before

225
00:18:37,739 --> 00:18:43,099
the Lord. He's praying and he's saying, God, I am afraid. I am fearful of this situation.

226
00:18:43,099 --> 00:18:48,139
I don't deserve what you've done in my life. You've been so good to me. But Lord, would

227
00:18:48,139 --> 00:18:54,099
you deliver me from the hand of my brother? For I fear him. Not only is he going to smite

228
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:58,219
me, but also my family. This is what he's thinking. But I want you to notice that as

229
00:18:58,219 --> 00:19:04,859
he's praying, that he also is recognizing, in this prayer it reveals to us, that Jacob

230
00:19:04,859 --> 00:19:10,979
had a knowledge of what God had said to him. In verse number 9 and also in verse number

231
00:19:10,979 --> 00:19:18,419
12, we find that Jacob understood that God had given him direction. Notice in verse number

232
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:23,820
9, Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, notice what he

233
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:29,579
says, the Lord which said unto me, return unto thy country and to thy kindred. So guess

234
00:19:29,579 --> 00:19:39,099
what? Jacob knew that he was not going back on his own will. God had given him the instruction.

235
00:19:39,099 --> 00:19:44,299
God had given him the direction to go back. In fact, if you turn back to Genesis chapter

236
00:19:44,299 --> 00:19:49,419
number 31 and look at the beginning of the chapter, notice what the Bible says in verse

237
00:19:49,419 --> 00:19:56,940
number 3 of Genesis 31, And the Lord said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers

238
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:00,059
and to thy kindred, and I will give you rest.

239
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:02,719
be with thee.

240
00:20:02,719 --> 00:20:04,979
That's what God told him to do.

241
00:20:04,979 --> 00:20:06,859
This was not Jacob that was just saying,

242
00:20:06,859 --> 00:20:09,819
listen, things were tough with Laban, no doubt.

243
00:20:09,819 --> 00:20:11,659
No doubt there was a desire for him

244
00:20:11,659 --> 00:20:13,119
to get out of that circumstance,

245
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:18,699
but God Himself told Jacob, return.

246
00:20:18,699 --> 00:20:20,879
Is Jacob being obedient?

247
00:20:20,879 --> 00:20:21,799
He is.

248
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:24,459
He's returning.

249
00:20:24,459 --> 00:20:26,919
But he knew what God said.

250
00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:29,079
He knew that God had given him

251
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:31,739
that divine direction to return

252
00:20:31,739 --> 00:20:33,579
back to the land of his fathers.

253
00:20:33,579 --> 00:20:36,159
He knew that God had promised to be with them

254
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:37,159
and to bless them.

255
00:20:37,159 --> 00:20:38,539
Notice at the end of verse 9,

256
00:20:38,539 --> 00:20:40,119
he says, return unto thy country

257
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:41,199
and to thy kindred.

258
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:42,199
Notice where he says,

259
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:45,659
and I will deal well with thee.

260
00:20:45,659 --> 00:20:46,659
In verse 12,

261
00:20:46,659 --> 00:20:48,159
and thou saidst,

262
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,159
I will surely do thee good

263
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,759
and make thy seed as the sand of the sea,

264
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:56,759
which cannot be numbered for multitude.

265
00:20:56,779 --> 00:20:59,399
Jacob is saying, God, you made a promise.

266
00:20:59,399 --> 00:21:02,859
I'm returning based upon your direction in my life.

267
00:21:02,859 --> 00:21:06,579
Now, understand, this isn't being irreverent.

268
00:21:06,579 --> 00:21:08,119
He's simply acknowledging that,

269
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:09,959
God, you've led me into this,

270
00:21:09,959 --> 00:21:12,879
and now I'm dealing with this perceived,

271
00:21:12,879 --> 00:21:14,419
really it's a perception here,

272
00:21:14,419 --> 00:21:17,339
it's a perceived difficulty that he's going to face.

273
00:21:17,339 --> 00:21:19,040
He makes some assumptions

274
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,919
based upon what the messengers tell him

275
00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:23,259
about Esau and the 400 men that are coming

276
00:21:23,259 --> 00:21:25,220
and the fear that he now has,

277
00:21:25,259 --> 00:21:27,259
but he takes it to the Lord.

278
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,259
And as he prays,

279
00:21:31,259 --> 00:21:34,720
it's revealed to us that he knew what God had told him.

280
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,799
Listen, in the time when it's either real adversity

281
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:40,040
as we've studied the last two Sunday mornings,

282
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,799
or even perceived adversity,

283
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:46,299
do not forget God's leadership.

284
00:21:46,299 --> 00:21:49,220
Do not forget God's promises.

285
00:21:50,259 --> 00:21:53,079
That's exactly what the enemy wants us to do.

286
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:57,279
Sometimes the enemy is going to bring real trial

287
00:21:57,279 --> 00:21:59,159
and real adversity in your life,

288
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:00,699
like he did with Hezekiah,

289
00:22:00,699 --> 00:22:02,579
like he did with the disciples

290
00:22:02,579 --> 00:22:04,500
that we studied the last two Sunday mornings,

291
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,360
but sometimes, like here in the passage with Jacob,

292
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,119
sometimes it's just a perceived thing,

293
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,500
it's an assumed thing.

294
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,000
And the enemy would like nothing more

295
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,199
for Jacob to be afraid and turn back

296
00:22:16,199 --> 00:22:19,039
and not do what God's told him to do.

297
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,739
The enemy doesn't want you to obey God.

298
00:22:21,739 --> 00:22:24,399
The enemy doesn't want me to obey God.

299
00:22:24,399 --> 00:22:26,619
The enemy will do whatever,

300
00:22:26,619 --> 00:22:28,660
within his power, whatever he's allowed to do,

301
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,779
because he's limited,

302
00:22:30,779 --> 00:22:33,020
he will do whatever he can to keep you and I

303
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,360
from doing the will of God.

304
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:40,360
Even if it's just an assumed, perceived danger.

305
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,580
Nothing actually had happened.

306
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,940
But he's fearful because of what could happen.

307
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:51,160
But in that moment, we must see the response of Jacob

308
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:55,399
and say, listen, we have to remember the promises of God.

309
00:22:57,199 --> 00:23:02,199
Never stop in doubt what God has led us to do by faith.

310
00:23:02,479 --> 00:23:04,479
I preached for an entire year,

311
00:23:04,479 --> 00:23:06,360
our theme was count your blessings,

312
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,979
and we talked about the blessings of the Lord,

313
00:23:08,979 --> 00:23:12,739
and I spent an entire year talking about increase our faith.

314
00:23:13,979 --> 00:23:17,160
And those two years were years in which we sought

315
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,160
to really have our faith increase

316
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,160
by remembering the blessings of God,

317
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,119
remembering the promises of God.

318
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:26,559
And so often, especially in the year in which we dealt

319
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,199
with increase our faith,

320
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:32,099
we spoke about the fact that if faith is a flower,

321
00:23:32,099 --> 00:23:36,020
I use the analogy often that doubt is a weed.

322
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:39,639
And if you want the flower to grow and to flourish,

323
00:23:39,639 --> 00:23:42,279
you must deal with the weeds.

324
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:43,639
You must deal with doubt.

325
00:23:43,639 --> 00:23:45,940
It doesn't mean that doubt's never gonna come.

326
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:50,179
It means that when doubt comes, we deal with it,

327
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:54,179
and we let the promises of God stand.

328
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:59,220
Because God has given us some promises, and God is faithful.

329
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,479
God has never failed us.

330
00:24:01,479 --> 00:24:04,819
And God made these promises to Jacob.

331
00:24:04,819 --> 00:24:07,899
God gave the direction to Jacob to return.

332
00:24:07,899 --> 00:24:10,259
We read it at the beginning of Genesis 31.

333
00:24:10,259 --> 00:24:13,559
Not only did he say, return unto the land of thy fathers,

334
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:14,639
but he said, unto thy kindred.

335
00:24:14,639 --> 00:24:17,519
Unto thy kindred, and I will be with thee.

336
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,480
God said that.

337
00:24:22,279 --> 00:24:25,760
Did God not know about Esau being back there?

338
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,600
Sure he did.

339
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:28,839
God knew all about it.

340
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:32,600
But God said, return, and I'm gonna be with you.

341
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,119
Jacob was a humble man.

342
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:36,639
I mentioned already in verse number 10,

343
00:24:36,639 --> 00:24:38,720
where he mentions, I'm not worthy

344
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,880
of the least of all the mercies,

345
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,519
and of all the truth,

346
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:45,720
which thou hast showed unto thy servant.

347
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,859
You know, we're not worthy, but we're blessed.

348
00:24:49,739 --> 00:24:50,700
We're blessed.

349
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:57,600
To know the Lord, to have his word, we're blessed.

350
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:00,419
God's been so good to us.

351
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:04,100
The blessing of the Lord should not cause us

352
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,339
to become prideful.

353
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,559
In fact, the blessing of the Lord should help us

354
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:13,160
to remain humble, to thank God for his grace

355
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,160
and for his mercy.

356
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:18,720
Where would we be without the Lord?

357
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,720
Jacob was a humble man.

358
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,959
We see the preparation, we see the prayer.

359
00:25:24,959 --> 00:25:26,919
I want you to notice a present for Esau.

360
00:25:26,919 --> 00:25:31,600
In verses 13 through 23, we find that Jacob,

361
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,000
after he concludes his prayer,

362
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,119
is gonna lodge in that place that night,

363
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:41,040
that he gathers together and he prepares a present

364
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:43,279
for his brother Esau.

365
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,720
At the end of the chapter, and we'll focus on it next week,

366
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,040
in verses 24 through following,

367
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:51,359
we will speak about the interaction that he had there,

368
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:54,160
but I want you to notice in these verses of Scripture

369
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,919
what Jacob does.

370
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:57,040
Says this in verse 13,

371
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,760
and he lodged there that same night

372
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:03,440
and took of that which came to his hand a present

373
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,959
for Esau, his brother.

374
00:26:05,959 --> 00:26:09,380
We understand that the reason that he desired

375
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:11,779
to send this present, it tells us in verse number 20,

376
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:15,299
and say ye, moreover, behold, thy servant Jacob

377
00:26:15,299 --> 00:26:18,779
is behind us, for he said, I will appease him

378
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:21,660
with the present that goeth before me,

379
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,419
and afterward I will see his face.

380
00:26:23,419 --> 00:26:27,940
Peradventure, he will accept me, accept of me.

381
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:30,579
In verse number five, we noticed already

382
00:26:30,579 --> 00:26:32,139
that when he sent the messengers out,

383
00:26:32,139 --> 00:26:35,100
he shared with us that truth that he was seeking

384
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,019
to find grace in the sight of Esau.

385
00:26:37,019 --> 00:26:41,019
He now prepares this present that he would deliver

386
00:26:41,019 --> 00:26:44,179
to Esau, and it's desiring to appease him

387
00:26:44,179 --> 00:26:45,679
that he would see his face

388
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:47,579
and that he would be accepted of him.

389
00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:52,339
I want you to notice this present is detailed for us

390
00:26:52,339 --> 00:26:54,779
in verse number 14 and following.

391
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:57,820
The Bible says 200 she goats and 20 he goats,

392
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:02,459
200 ewes and 20 rams, 30 milt camels with their colts,

393
00:27:02,459 --> 00:27:05,859
40 kine, 10 bulls, 20 she asses, and 10 foals,

394
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,980
and he delivered them into the hand of his servants

395
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:10,299
every drove by themselves and said unto his servants,

396
00:27:10,299 --> 00:27:12,619
pass over before me and put a space

397
00:27:12,619 --> 00:27:14,779
betwixt drove and drove.

398
00:27:14,779 --> 00:27:16,619
He commanded the foremost saying,

399
00:27:16,619 --> 00:27:19,179
when Esau my brother meeteth thee and asketh thee saying,

400
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:21,660
whose art thou and whither goest thou

401
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:23,660
and whose art these before thee,

402
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:26,980
then thou shalt say, they be thy servant Jacob's.

403
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:31,380
Notice it is a present sent unto my Lord Esau,

404
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:35,399
and behold also he is behind us.

405
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:39,480
We find that as he prayed,

406
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,619
as we recorded and noted in verses nine through 12

407
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:46,700
that Jacob is still a man that I think we can relate to.

408
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:49,660
We can see that though he's prayed,

409
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:52,779
he now still is trying to do something in his own hand

410
00:27:53,899 --> 00:27:55,859
to try to appease his brother.

411
00:27:55,859 --> 00:27:58,700
Yeah, sometimes we're guilty of that, aren't we?

412
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:01,139
We talk about take it to the Lord

413
00:28:01,139 --> 00:28:03,619
and the songwriter said, leave it there.

414
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,019
You ever sing those words and think about

415
00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:07,679
how many times we take something to the Lord,

416
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,459
but we don't really leave it with the Lord.

417
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:13,980
So we prayed about it.

418
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:19,179
Cast thy burden upon the Lord and he shall sustain thee.

419
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,459
Casting all your care upon him, why?

420
00:28:22,459 --> 00:28:23,959
For he careth for you.

421
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,739
But there are times, listen, I understand we're humans.

422
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:31,380
We can relate to Jacob, can we not?

423
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,580
He prayed about it.

424
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,940
He was like, okay, so I prayed,

425
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:36,299
but now I'm gonna also get this present ready.

426
00:28:37,659 --> 00:28:39,779
I mean, I'm not trying to beat Jacob up

427
00:28:39,779 --> 00:28:41,700
because we do the same kind of thing.

428
00:28:42,779 --> 00:28:44,340
It might not be in the same context

429
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,619
of what Jacob is dealing with,

430
00:28:45,619 --> 00:28:47,460
but what I'm saying this evening is that

431
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,659
I hope that we can relate to Jacob

432
00:28:49,659 --> 00:28:51,739
and that we can learn something from the passage

433
00:28:51,739 --> 00:28:54,020
of Scripture and it's so interesting to me

434
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:58,299
that the timing and we see God is so good

435
00:28:58,299 --> 00:29:01,580
and he's so sovereign and we think about the theme

436
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,979
that I've been dealing with this year

437
00:29:02,979 --> 00:29:05,460
in the last several weeks and thinking about the truth

438
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:08,820
that the God of the universe, the God of the creator,

439
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,380
God, that he's our helper.

440
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:14,500
And we find here that Jacob is,

441
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,460
he's trying to do something.

442
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:20,820
He's still got that situation of fear going on

443
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,500
in his heart and his life.

444
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:26,059
Oh, he responds by praying and it's appropriate,

445
00:29:26,059 --> 00:29:28,619
but sometimes we pray,

446
00:29:28,619 --> 00:29:31,219
but then we try to still figure something out.

447
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,820
We pray and then we still try to appease somebody.

448
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:36,580
That's what Jacob's doing, right?

449
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,419
Is that fair?

450
00:29:37,419 --> 00:29:39,460
That's what's taking place.

451
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:41,859
And this evening we find that,

452
00:29:41,859 --> 00:29:43,739
I mean, this was a significant gift.

453
00:29:43,739 --> 00:29:45,700
According to verse 13, it was 200 she goats,

454
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,539
20 he goats, 200 ewes and 20 rams.

455
00:29:48,539 --> 00:29:49,820
According to verse number 14,

456
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:52,779
30 milch camels and their colts, 40 kine,

457
00:29:52,779 --> 00:29:55,020
10 bulls, 20 she asses and 10 foals.

458
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:59,140
I mean, this was a serious present

459
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,380
that Jacob has.

460
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:05,700
prepared to send to Esau. What a scene! The Bible tells us in verse number 17

461
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:09,180
that he commanded the foremost saying, well look back in verse 16, excuse me, he

462
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:12,700
delivered them into the hands of his servants, every drove by themselves, and

463
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:18,380
notice the Bible, the drove, the idea of the herds, he says every herd, every drove

464
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:21,940
by themselves, and sent them to his servants, Passover before me, and put a

465
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:27,020
space between, drove and drove. So ask this, this wasn't just like one arrival

466
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:31,340
of servants with all of these herds, no, there was a group of

467
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:35,580
servants that came with the first herd, there's a little space, and then all of

468
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:38,340
a sudden there's another group of servants that come with another drove,

469
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:46,300
and oh, what is all this, a present for you from Jacob? And he says in

470
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:50,820
verse 17, and he commanded the foremost saying, when Esau my brother meeteth thee

471
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:54,780
and asketh thee, saying whose art thou, and whither goest thou, and whose are

472
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:58,860
these before thee, notice what he says, this is what you should say, they be thy

473
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:06,540
servants Jacob's, it is a present unto my Lord Esau, and behold also he is behind

474
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:11,940
us. So Jacob was behind, he's sending all this stuff, in verse 19, so commanded he

475
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:15,860
the second, and the third, and all that followed the drove. So again, you see, can

476
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:19,020
you see the scene, you see how it's unfolding? I mean Esau, the first

477
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:24,020
servants come with this portion of the the present that that Jacob has

478
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:28,700
provided and presented, and we find that he's, what is all this? He's like, oh, this

479
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:34,740
is a present for you. A little while later, another drove comes, servants, it's a present

480
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:39,540
for you. It says in verse 19, and so commanded he the second, and the third,

481
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:43,940
and all that followed the drove, saying, on this manner shall you speak unto Esau

482
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:51,460
when you find him. So there's more than four droves that went. Can you imagine

483
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:59,140
the scene? Esau, another group of people come, another group of people come, and

484
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:03,260
notice verse 20, and say ye moreover, behold thy servant Jacob is behind us.

485
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:07,980
For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and

486
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:12,620
afterward I will see his face. Peradventure he will accept of me. So

487
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:17,540
went the present over before him, and himself lodged that night in the company.

488
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:22,380
As we find in verse 21 that the servants that he had commanded, and all of that

489
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:26,820
livestock that is recorded in verse 13 and 14, that it went forward as he had

490
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:31,740
instructed, no doubt he's seeking reconciliation. It says at the end of

491
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:38,139
verse number 20, peradventure he will accept of me. He said in verse number 5, that I

492
00:32:38,139 --> 00:32:45,220
might find grace in thy sight. It says in verse 22, after it says this in verse 21,

493
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:48,260
that he lodged that night in the company, that he rose up that night and took his

494
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:52,779
two wives, his two women servants, and his 11 sons, and passed over the Ford Jabbok,

495
00:32:52,779 --> 00:32:59,340
and he took them and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had. Why?

496
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:03,620
Because he wants to protect them. Remember what he said back as you looked

497
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:07,540
in verse number 11? He said, deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother,

498
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:12,220
from the hand of Esau. Why? For I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, but

499
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:16,820
notice what he says, and the mother with the children. Jacob wasn't simply

500
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:19,700
concerned about losing his own life, but he was concerned about his wives and his

501
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:25,059
children. And so, therefore, we see his action in verse number 22 and 23, and how

502
00:33:25,059 --> 00:33:31,059
he rose up and put some space and separated the family in purpose of, hey,

503
00:33:31,059 --> 00:33:36,460
I'm trying to protect. But we're going to look at this passage of Scripture, and I

504
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:40,340
don't want to get ahead of myself for next week, but the reality is that if you

505
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:44,540
look at verses 24 through 32, and you find what happens here, the Bible says,

506
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:47,300
and Jacob was left alone, and there wrestled a man with him until the

507
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:54,580
breaking of the day. What an encounter Jacob has at the end of this chapter,

508
00:33:54,580 --> 00:34:01,900
and how his life has changed forever. In fact, as you look at the text of

509
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:06,380
Scripture, and again, I don't want to preach the message for next week, this

510
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:13,540
evening, but it tells us the end of verse number 31, and he halted upon his thigh.

511
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:23,100
I look at that end of verse number 31, and I see a limp. It's something that Jacob

512
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:30,420
would never forget, an encounter that would stay with him the rest of his life.

513
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:41,179
Every time he would limp, when he leans upon the staff in Egypt to give a blessing,

514
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:48,619
he remembered the meeting he had with God. I'm thankful for God's grace.

515
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:52,899
I'm thankful that God knows our frame. I'm thankful that God knows that we're

516
00:34:52,899 --> 00:35:04,140
but flesh. He made us. He knows us, and I'm thankful that though Jacob prayed,

517
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:10,220
and then Jacob still kept his hand in the mix and presented this present so that he

518
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:15,660
could appease his brother, I'm thankful that God still met with him.

519
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:22,619
That's precious to me because God knows where we are. He knows what we're dealing

520
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:31,540
with, and he loves us, and he ministers to us, and the reality is that Jacob here in

521
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:39,020
this text of Scripture, he brought his fear before the Lord, but you can tell by his actions

522
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:47,500
that he still has a measure of fear with regard to this reunion, and in our lives this evening

523
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:54,179
when we look at Genesis chapter number 32, I hope that we can relate to Jacob. I understand

524
00:35:54,179 --> 00:36:00,500
that the specifics are going to be different. I don't know any of us that have been separated

525
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:06,420
from a brother for 20 years that wanted to kill us. Circumstances are different, but

526
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:10,179
God knows your heart, and God knows what you're dealing with, and God knows if you're afraid,

527
00:36:10,179 --> 00:36:15,540
and he knows that anxiety that you're dealing with or whatever that opposition is that you're

528
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:23,700
facing. When you take it to the Lord, at times in our lives we act just like Jacob.

529
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:27,500
We pour our heart out before the Lord, and then we leave from the presence of the Lord,

530
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:34,179
and we go and try to figure something out. We try to take matters into our own hands.

531
00:36:34,179 --> 00:36:37,580
I think if we'd be honest tonight, I'll be honest with you from the pulpit, I've

532
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:43,619
done it. I think if we'd be honest tonight, at times in our lives we've all done it.

533
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:50,619
We try to take matters into our own hands. You know what I find out more times than not?

534
00:36:50,619 --> 00:36:59,540
I mess it up. I mess it up. And you know what I find out in my life? God is much better

535
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:09,260
than I am. God is able to work in hearts I can't. God was able to do something in Esau's

536
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:15,920
heart that Jacob could never accomplish. God was able to do something in Esau's heart

537
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:22,940
that no present, no matter the size, the cost, the whatever, that could never do. Why? Because

538
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:28,940
he's the Creator God. Because he's able. And this evening as we look at this passage

539
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:32,580
of Scripture and we see the preparation, and we see that Jacob's going to meet Esau, it's

540
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:38,100
been 20 years. I mean you think about the flood of emotions that would come over Jacob,

541
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:43,660
and even the initial apprehension of, God, are you sure you want me to go back to that

542
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:51,380
place? God, do you remember the circumstances that surrounded my departure from there?

543
00:37:51,380 --> 00:38:03,940
But he rose up to go. He left Padonaron. He's heading back. We went, as you told us, and

544
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:12,619
we found that Esau's coming. He's got 400 men with him. Throw you for a loop sometimes.

545
00:38:12,619 --> 00:38:18,940
Because sometimes we have this idea that if I'm obeying the will of God that there will

546
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:24,700
be no difficulties. But you know, as many times as I've read the Bible, and I've read

547
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:31,700
it quite a few times, I've never found the Bible to tell me that. That if I follow God

548
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:38,099
I'll have no problems, I'll have no difficulties, I'll have no opposition. In fact, I read over

549
00:38:38,099 --> 00:38:45,380
and over, throughout the pages of this book, people that follow the Lord, that because

550
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:55,140
they follow the Lord, face difficulties. But God knew about them, and God sustained them,

551
00:38:55,140 --> 00:39:01,859
and God blessed them, and God grew them. You know, some of the most fascinating accounts

552
00:39:01,859 --> 00:39:07,580
in the Word of God, if we were to ask the children this evening, I don't like using

553
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:12,020
the word story when we talk about a biblical account, but many people refer to it as a

554
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:18,880
Bible story. I like using the word biblical account because its story kind of gives the

555
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:29,880
idea that it's a story. Something that maybe is just made up. They're biblical accounts.

556
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:36,520
And I know it's just a little nuance of syntax, but that's just my personal approach to it.

557
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:42,440
But if we were to ask the kids this evening, or maybe even some of the adults, what biblical

558
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:52,119
account is your favorite? I'm sure some would speak about David and Goliath. Joseph in the

559
00:39:52,119 --> 00:40:00,239
pit, being delivered, in the prison, being delivered. Maybe Daniel, right? Maybe Daniel

560
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:05,479
the Den of Lies, maybe Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.

561
00:40:05,479 --> 00:40:06,479
We could go on and on.

562
00:40:06,479 --> 00:40:11,479
But you know what's amazing about most of those accounts?

563
00:40:11,479 --> 00:40:18,399
We read of those and we find that they face some difficulties, they face some adversity

564
00:40:18,399 --> 00:40:24,039
and some opposition, and God showed Himself mighty.

565
00:40:24,039 --> 00:40:30,799
He revealed His power and we look at Him and say, man, look at what God did.

566
00:40:30,799 --> 00:40:36,799
And then we face a difficulty and say, oh, woe is me.

567
00:40:36,799 --> 00:40:39,899
What might God do in our lives?

568
00:40:39,899 --> 00:40:48,599
How might God show Himself real in your life, in my life?

569
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:51,219
Jacob's a man just like we are.

570
00:40:51,219 --> 00:40:53,779
He dealt with fear just like we do.

571
00:40:53,779 --> 00:41:03,599
He took it to the Lord and just like we do, we sometimes try to keep our hand in it.

572
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:08,019
I'm thankful and we'll look at it in its entirety next week that God met with him at the end

573
00:41:08,019 --> 00:41:09,799
of chapter 32.

574
00:41:09,799 --> 00:41:14,759
You read chapter 33, it's a great reunion that takes place between Jacob and Esau.

575
00:41:14,759 --> 00:41:19,439
It's amazing to see the reconciliation between those two men.

576
00:41:19,439 --> 00:41:22,119
It's a blessing.

577
00:41:22,119 --> 00:41:28,739
But I hope that as we look at these, just 23 verses tonight, this preparation of Jacob,

578
00:41:28,739 --> 00:41:34,339
that as we relate to Jacob, say, Lord, would You help us?

579
00:41:34,339 --> 00:41:41,819
Would You help me to be able to see in the life of Jacob what sometimes I even do in

580
00:41:41,819 --> 00:41:43,779
my own life?

581
00:41:43,779 --> 00:41:47,699
And help me to keep my hands out of it.

582
00:41:47,699 --> 00:41:49,259
Let God have His way.

583
00:41:49,399 --> 00:41:56,319
Let God do what only God can do because He is able.

584
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:57,319
We sing it.

585
00:41:57,319 --> 00:41:58,319
He is able.

586
00:41:58,319 --> 00:41:59,439
He is able.

587
00:41:59,439 --> 00:42:02,599
I know He is able.

588
00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:03,979
He is able to deliver thee.

589
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:06,119
We sing the hymn.

590
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:07,279
Deliver thee from what?

591
00:42:07,279 --> 00:42:08,279
From anything.

592
00:42:08,279 --> 00:42:09,279
From anything.

593
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:13,239
Isn't that what Darius said to Daniel?

594
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:19,659
He said, Daniel, is thy God that thou servest continually, able to deliver thee?

595
00:42:19,659 --> 00:42:28,599
Isn't it amazing that Darius had such a high view of Daniel and of Daniel's God?

596
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:31,499
Because Daniel was a man that walked with God.

597
00:42:31,499 --> 00:42:33,739
Daniel had a great testimony.

598
00:42:33,739 --> 00:42:38,539
And Daniel returned word, he is.

599
00:42:38,539 --> 00:42:41,579
They've not touched me all night.

600
00:42:41,579 --> 00:42:46,359
Those men that accused, they didn't hit the ground before they were devoured.

601
00:42:46,359 --> 00:42:48,559
Our God is able.

602
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:49,559
Let's pray.

603
00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:50,559
Father, we love You.

604
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:51,919
We thank You for loving us.

605
00:42:51,919 --> 00:42:58,219
As we look at this account tonight of Jacob and his preparation, Lord, I pray that in

606
00:42:58,219 --> 00:43:10,699
our lives, we deal with opposition, whether real or assumed.

607
00:43:10,699 --> 00:43:19,819
As we see in the text tonight, this was just an assumed problem, the perception of Jacob.

608
00:43:19,819 --> 00:43:23,679
Worst case scenario thinking.

609
00:43:23,679 --> 00:43:29,519
No doubt in our lives, there are times that we've been guilty of the same thing.

610
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:31,919
I thank You that Jacob prayed.

611
00:43:31,919 --> 00:43:37,599
Lord, I pray that we'd come to You, seeking Your face.

612
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:49,419
Lord, I pray that we'd learn from the life of Jacob to leave it with You, to trust You,

613
00:43:49,419 --> 00:43:55,859
to know that You are the God that spoke everything into existence, that You rule and that You

614
00:43:55,859 --> 00:44:01,219
reign, that You're our God and that You're able.

615
00:44:01,219 --> 00:44:08,059
So often, we mess things up by trying to get our own hands into the mix.

616
00:44:08,059 --> 00:44:14,899
Lord, I pray that You would help us to simply trust You, help us to follow You, help us

617
00:44:14,899 --> 00:44:16,739
to obey You.

618
00:44:16,739 --> 00:44:20,579
I pray that in a moment of invitation this evening, that You'd move and work in hearts

619
00:44:20,579 --> 00:44:22,339
and lives as only You can.

620
00:44:22,339 --> 00:44:25,739
Well, thank You for all that You'll do, for it's in Christ's name we pray.
