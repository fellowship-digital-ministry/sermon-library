WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
Genesis chapter number 32, and this is, it's been a long time since we've been in the

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.440
book of Genesis.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:11.600
It was last, right before our missions conference last year, and we had Sunday evening before

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.280
missions conference in the book of Genesis, and then we had missions conference and then

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.920
got into the summer months, and I've been dealing with, since then, Ask the Pastor.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.239
There were a lot of questions that were submitted for Ask the Pastor, and it took a whole lot

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:27.479
longer than I expected.

00:00:27.479 --> 00:00:29.239
I actually didn't even answer all of them.

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:36.200
I saved a handful for this summer, and we'll have that as a summer Sunday evening series

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.720
again this upcoming summer.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:43.599
But this is message number 71 in the book of Genesis, and it's back from May when we

00:00:43.599 --> 00:00:48.759
finished up chapter number 31, and so as we look at chapter number 32 in the title for

00:00:48.759 --> 00:00:52.759
the message this evening, as you see on the back of the bulletin, is Jacob prepares to

00:00:52.759 --> 00:00:53.759
meet Esau.

00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:57.639
Before we get into the passage here in Genesis chapter number 32, it's important for us to

00:00:57.639 --> 00:01:02.919
understand, really, the backdrop and all that had taken place in previous years.

00:01:02.919 --> 00:01:08.319
We understand that the circumstances surrounding Jacob's departure from Beersheba were marked

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:10.120
with much tension.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.480
You'll remember that Esau was to be blessed by Isaac.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.279
It was, that was the desire.

00:01:15.279 --> 00:01:19.800
Isaac had given the instruction for Esau to go out and to bring him some venison, like

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.000
he enjoyed, and that he would give him a blessing.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.800
And we know that through a series of events that Jacob was the one that received the blessing.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.639
In fact, if you turn back to Genesis chapter 27, I'll mark a couple of verses as we study

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:38.480
through and kind of catch up to where we are here in Genesis chapter number 32.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.800
But we find that Jacob receives the blessing.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.919
You'll remember that Esau comes in, and Esau wept.

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:49.720
He was very bothered by the situation, and he desired for a blessing.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:57.839
And Esau was angry because of what had transpired, and Esau intended to slay Jacob after the

00:01:57.839 --> 00:02:03.400
days of mourning for Isaac were fulfilled, excuse me, for Jacob there.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:09.320
The Bible tells us that Isaac and, or Esau and Jacob, that situation, there's obviously

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.320
some tension there.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.160
And notice in verse number 41, Esau said this, it says, Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.479
wherewith his father blessed him, and Esau said in his heart, the days of mourning for

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:30.199
my father at hand, notice what he says, then will I slay my brother Jacob.

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:35.360
And so these words of Esau, her elder son, were told to Rebekah, and she sent and called

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.639
Jacob her younger son and said unto him, behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:43.199
himself, purposing to kill thee.

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:47.600
Now therefore, my son, obey my voice and arise, notice what she says, flee thou to

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.639
Laban my brother, to Haran, and it says this in verse 44, and tarry with him, notice this,

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:59.679
a few days, until thy brother's fury turn away.

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:02.979
We find that Rebekah provides this instruction to Jacob.

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:07.119
She was also the one that provided the instruction to Jacob with regard to providing the meal

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:09.679
by which he would receive the blessing.

00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:15.119
And she says, flee to my brother Laban and go for a few days.

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:17.119
Jacob departed as he was instructed.

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:23.000
We find that in Genesis chapter number 28, he's given instruction from Isaac.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.919
Isaac gives him a blessing and charges him with regard to his departure, and Jacob departs

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:31.720
from Beersheba and heads toward Haran.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.800
The Bible tells us that as he was receiving that instruction as he departed, that he then

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:43.039
would be in that region with Laban for 20 years.

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:51.000
A few days, she said, 20 years, that's a long time, that's a very long time.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.919
We find that after 20 years, he's then going to depart from Paddan Aram, and as he's planning

00:03:56.919 --> 00:04:01.440
to return to the land of his fathers per the instruction of the Lord, we find that the

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.580
departure from Paddan Aram was also marked by some excitement.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:12.800
We read of and studied in Genesis chapter number 31 as we ended our study last May in

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.480
this chapter, and remember that after they departed, that Laban comes and he gathers

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:22.239
and he finds them and he comes and there's a confrontation that takes place.

00:04:22.239 --> 00:04:27.920
And God had appeared to Laban and told Laban that he was not to do anything to Jacob, he's

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.420
not to cause him any harm and what have you.

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:36.940
And so we find that at the end of that confrontation and all that interaction that took place in

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:43.220
chapter 31, we then come to chapter number 32 where Jacob is still leaving, he's left

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:49.059
Paddan Aram, he's heading back to the land of his fathers, and he's planning to reunite

00:04:49.059 --> 00:04:51.140
with Esau.

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:58.059
Twenty years earlier, Esau said, I'm going to mourn the death of my father and I'm going

00:04:58.059 --> 00:04:59.859
to kill my brother.

00:04:59.859 --> 00:05:01.820
That's what he intended to do.

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:07.459
Twenty years had passed and now Jacob is preparing to meet his brother.

00:05:07.459 --> 00:05:13.140
Notice in verse number one of Genesis 32, the Bible says, and Jacob went on his way

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.820
and the angels of God met him.

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.880
When Jacob saw them, he said, this is God's host and he called the name of that place

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.179
Mahanaim.

00:05:23.179 --> 00:05:28.619
And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau, his brother, under the land of Seir, the country

00:05:28.619 --> 00:05:29.619
of Edom.

00:05:29.619 --> 00:05:34.779
And he commanded them saying, thus shall you speak unto my lord Esau, thy servant Jacob

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:40.619
saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban and stayed there until now.

00:05:40.619 --> 00:05:44.660
And I have oxen and asses, flocks and men's servants, and women's servants, and I have

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:50.980
sent to tell my lord, notice the way it says, that I may find grace in thy sight.

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:56.260
We'll read down through this passage of Scripture this evening to verse number 23, we'll deal

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:00.820
with the remainder of chapter 32 next Sunday evening, but as we're looking at this text

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:04.380
of Scripture, if you're taking notes this evening, I want you to notice number one,

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.779
the preparation of Jacob.

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:07.779
The preparation of Jacob.

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:14.899
In the first eight verses of Genesis 32, God provides for us a record of Jacob's preparation

00:06:14.899 --> 00:06:19.940
as he plans for this meeting, this reunion with his brother Esau.

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:24.179
We find that in verse number three that the Bible tells us that Jacob sent messengers

00:06:24.179 --> 00:06:25.420
before him.

00:06:25.579 --> 00:06:27.140
He's trying to prepare the way.

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:32.059
He's got these servants, these messengers that are going to take word to his brother

00:06:32.059 --> 00:06:37.660
Esau, and we find that as he sends these messengers, that he sends them with a specific message.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:43.899
In verses four and five, we find that as he would give these servants of his, these messengers,

00:06:43.899 --> 00:06:49.619
this specific message that he records for us, or God records for us, how it is that

00:06:49.619 --> 00:06:56.100
he commanded his servants, his messengers, to bring this specific message to Esau.

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:59.980
Notice if you will, how Jacob said to refer to Esau.

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:05.299
Notice in verse number four, and he commanded them saying, thus shall you speak unto my

00:07:05.299 --> 00:07:09.579
Lord Esau.

00:07:09.579 --> 00:07:15.540
You notice how he says to refer to Esau is my Lord, but also notice how he refers to

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:16.540
himself.

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:22.420
In verse number four, thy servant Jacob.

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:28.619
He says, thus shall you speak unto my Lord Esau, thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have

00:07:28.619 --> 00:07:33.299
sojourned with Laban and stayed there until now.

00:07:33.299 --> 00:07:39.619
We notice, of course, as you would look back at the blessing that God had given to Isaac,

00:07:39.619 --> 00:07:45.420
and we mentioned very briefly of that interaction in chapter number 27, but if you were to look

00:07:45.459 --> 00:07:50.500
back there in that passage of Scripture, and notice in verse number 33 of Genesis 27, the

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:54.260
Bible says that Isaac trembled very exceedingly and said, who?

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:55.980
This is when Esau comes in.

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:59.380
He says, where is he that hath taken venison and brought it me, and I have eaten of all

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:04.059
before thou camest, and have blessed him, yea, and he shall be blessed.

00:08:04.059 --> 00:08:07.940
When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry,

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:11.660
and said unto his father, bless me, even me also, my father.

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:15.220
And he said, thy brother came with subtlety, and hath taken away thy blessing, and he said,

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:19.260
is not he rightly named Jacob?

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.459
For he hath supplanted me these two times, he took away my birthright, and behold, now

00:08:22.459 --> 00:08:28.640
he hath taken away my blessing, and he said, hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:33.099
Notice what it says in verse 37, and Isaac answered and said unto Esau, behold, I have

00:08:33.099 --> 00:08:35.299
made him, who's him?

00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:36.739
Jacob, right?

00:08:36.739 --> 00:08:40.140
I've made him, what's it say?

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:41.140
Thy Lord.

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:44.919
That's what it says.

00:08:44.919 --> 00:08:50.119
And all his brethren have I given to him for, what's it say?

00:08:50.119 --> 00:08:53.280
Servants, is that what your Bible says?

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.280
That's what my Bible says.

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:59.520
My Bible says in verse 37, follow along with me there in Genesis 27, verse 37, Isaac answered

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:05.400
and said unto Esau, Esau says, dad, is there not a blessing for me?

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:13.440
And Isaac says to Esau, behold, I have made him, your brother, Jacob, I have made him

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:16.239
thy Lord.

00:09:16.239 --> 00:09:20.440
And all his brethren, that includes Esau, correct?

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:21.440
Yes or no?

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:22.440
Talk to me tonight.

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:23.940
Absolutely, right?

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:31.080
He says, and all his brethren have I given to him for what?

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:32.559
Servants.

00:09:32.559 --> 00:09:37.400
But what does Jacob say to his messengers to go to Esau with?

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:44.799
He says, refer to Esau as my Lord, and refer to myself as thy servant.

00:09:44.799 --> 00:09:49.900
That's actually reverse of the blessing and the instruction that God gave in Genesis 27.

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:56.599
I do see, however, a measure of humility within the life of Jacob here in this text of Scripture.

00:09:56.599 --> 00:09:59.520
Jacob, of course, is fearful.

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:00.039
He's going back.

00:10:00.039 --> 00:10:05.039
home and Esau is ready to kill him, right? Last time he was there, why did he flee in

00:10:05.039 --> 00:10:12.079
the first place? He fled in the first place because Esau is going to kill him. So he fled.

00:10:12.079 --> 00:10:17.439
Now God, and we'll look at this in just a few moments, now God has divinely directed

00:10:17.439 --> 00:10:23.599
for Jacob to return. But he knows in so doing that he is going to meet Esau. And the last

00:10:23.599 --> 00:10:27.879
time he was there, Esau is going to kill him. And so he's concerned. I believe that he's

00:10:27.879 --> 00:10:33.039
genuine in this in Genesis chapter 32 when he's sending these messengers with this message.

00:10:33.039 --> 00:10:39.239
But we have to understand that God is sovereign. And God gave that blessing and God was in

00:10:39.239 --> 00:10:45.839
control. And we find here that he sends this, not only does he give instruction with regard

00:10:45.839 --> 00:10:51.079
to how to refer to Esau, how to refer to himself, he tells us in verse number five, he mentions

00:10:51.079 --> 00:10:55.679
about the blessing of the Lord and how much substance he had received. And during that

00:10:55.679 --> 00:11:02.239
20 years where they had been separated one from the other, how God had blessed him. And

00:11:02.239 --> 00:11:06.199
he records that in verse number five. But then we find that he has this desire that

00:11:06.199 --> 00:11:11.119
he might find grace in the sight of Esau. The messengers returned to Jacob, according

00:11:11.119 --> 00:11:15.999
to verse number six. And we find that as these messengers returned to Jacob, that they bring

00:11:15.999 --> 00:11:20.479
him a message that he's not really too excited to receive. For the Bible tells us that they

00:11:20.479 --> 00:11:25.619
returned to Jacob saying, we came to thy brother Esau, notice what it says, and also he cometh

00:11:25.759 --> 00:11:36.139
to meet thee and 400 men with him. We know the entirety of this passage. Many of us are

00:11:36.139 --> 00:11:42.539
familiar with Genesis 32 and 33. And we see in chapter 33 the reunion. What a reunion

00:11:42.539 --> 00:11:47.739
it is, by the way. But I want you to think about Jacob just for a moment. These messengers

00:11:47.739 --> 00:11:51.999
come back and they say, oh, we went with the message that you gave us to give. And by the

00:11:51.999 --> 00:11:55.839
way, when we went, Esau was coming to meet you. And oh, by the way, he's got 400 men

00:11:55.839 --> 00:12:02.079
with him. What are you thinking if you're Jacob? Probably thinking he's coming to kill

00:12:02.079 --> 00:12:10.479
you. I mean, that's a natural response of interpreting those circumstances that he's

00:12:10.479 --> 00:12:16.239
seeing. We find that the Bible tells us in verse number seven, then after Jacob received

00:12:16.239 --> 00:12:24.119
this news from his messengers, notice what it says, then Jacob was greatly afraid and

00:12:24.119 --> 00:12:32.199
distressed. He was greatly afraid and distressed. You know, throughout the Bible, God tells

00:12:32.199 --> 00:12:38.199
us over and over to fear not. But the reality is that as human beings, there are times that

00:12:38.199 --> 00:12:45.399
we fear. It's an emotion that we have. God made us. He knows that we're emotional people.

00:12:45.399 --> 00:12:49.759
And he knows that one of the emotions that we have is fear. There are things that happen

00:12:49.759 --> 00:12:53.439
in your life. There are things that happen in my life. There are things that happen in

00:12:53.439 --> 00:12:59.039
the lives of those that are recorded for us in the pages of Scripture that those circumstances

00:12:59.039 --> 00:13:07.719
led to fear. They led to fear. The sin is not so much in being afraid. The sin is what

00:13:07.719 --> 00:13:13.999
happens after that immediate fear. Do I stay? Do I remain in a state of fear? Do I allow

00:13:14.159 --> 00:13:22.599
fear to control me? Do I allow fear to trump what God has said in his Word? Or do I have

00:13:22.599 --> 00:13:30.479
the eye of faith and do I trust the Lord? Do I turn to God? Do I trust him in the moment

00:13:30.479 --> 00:13:36.839
when fear creeps in? I remember, and I think I did not do any research on this, but I would

00:13:36.839 --> 00:13:43.639
assume the company still exists. But I remember while I was in high school, there was a particular

00:13:43.639 --> 00:13:50.519
clothing line that made clothes that we would, a lot of things sports-wise, attire. And it

00:13:50.519 --> 00:13:57.039
was called No Fear. No Fear. And they'd have certain things on them. And I played baseball

00:13:57.039 --> 00:14:05.239
very competitively. And in Nevada, as a baseball, our team, we won state playoffs. And my sophomore

00:14:05.239 --> 00:14:09.679
year we were very competitive. And we used to have a shirt that we had made up that said

00:14:09.719 --> 00:14:13.639
No Fear Serpent Baseball because we were the Mineral County Serpents. That was the name

00:14:13.639 --> 00:14:18.399
of our team. That was our mascot. But the reality is that as many times as people want

00:14:18.399 --> 00:14:22.679
to put no fear on things and talk about it, everybody that I know has gotten some kind

00:14:22.679 --> 00:14:33.999
of fear. Right? People that say, I'm not afraid of anything. You're lying, man. I'm just telling

00:14:33.999 --> 00:14:44.639
you. You're lying. The sin is not in being afraid. It's how we handle it. What happens?

00:14:44.639 --> 00:14:52.479
Listen, Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed. I would argue that most of us, if we were

00:14:52.479 --> 00:14:59.199
in this same situation, given the same exact circumstances, where we knew that somebody

00:14:59.199 --> 00:15:04.039
wanted to kill us, we were separated from them for 20 years, and we're going to reunite

00:15:04.039 --> 00:15:11.759
with them, and we find out they're coming to meet us with 400 people, I'm afraid. I'm

00:15:11.759 --> 00:15:21.119
afraid. But I want you to notice what Jacob does. The Bible tells us in verse number 7

00:15:21.119 --> 00:15:26.559
that Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed. He divided the people that was with him and

00:15:26.559 --> 00:15:32.359
the flocks and herds, the camels, into two bands and said, if Esau come to the one company

00:15:32.359 --> 00:15:36.959
and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape. So we find that he made

00:15:36.959 --> 00:15:41.479
some preparations there. But then as we continue through the passage of Scripture, if you're

00:15:41.479 --> 00:15:45.639
taking notes, notice number 2 with me. We see number 1, the preparation of Jacob in

00:15:45.639 --> 00:15:54.839
verses 1-8. Number 2, the prayer of Jacob in verses 9-12. In verses 9-12, we see that

00:15:54.839 --> 00:16:01.719
Jacob responds in prayer. The Bible says in verse number 9, and Jacob said, O God of

00:16:01.719 --> 00:16:10.439
my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, the Lord which said unto me, return unto thy

00:16:10.439 --> 00:16:16.679
country and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee. Notice what he says in verse

00:16:16.679 --> 00:16:22.059
number 10. Again, we see this measure of humility. By the way, in Jacob's life, there was many

00:16:22.059 --> 00:16:26.099
times where you did not see much humility in his life, but we find that he says this

00:16:26.099 --> 00:16:31.539
in verse number 10 as he continues to pray. I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies

00:16:31.539 --> 00:16:36.099
and of all the truth which thou hast showed unto thy servant. For with my staff I passed

00:16:36.099 --> 00:16:41.659
over this Jordan, and now I am become two bands. You know, we're not worthy of God's

00:16:41.659 --> 00:16:52.979
blessing. We really aren't. God's grace, God's mercy, what a blessing. I'm so thankful

00:16:52.979 --> 00:16:59.179
to be adopted in the family of God. I'm so thankful to be a child of the King, join heirs

00:16:59.179 --> 00:17:03.459
with Jesus. That's what the Bible tells us. It's all because of His grace, all because

00:17:03.459 --> 00:17:08.219
of His mercy. I didn't deserve it. You didn't deserve it. I'm not worthy of it. You're not

00:17:08.219 --> 00:17:15.619
worthy of it. But God's grace, God's mercy, His love for us. Jacob says this in verse

00:17:15.619 --> 00:17:21.059
number 11, deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau,

00:17:21.059 --> 00:17:26.299
for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me and the mother with the children. Listen,

00:17:26.299 --> 00:17:32.699
when you're afraid, God already knows that you're afraid. Does He know everything? Yes.

00:17:32.699 --> 00:17:37.579
So what kind of sense does it make for us to be afraid and then act like we're not?

00:17:37.579 --> 00:17:46.539
God knows. And He says specifically, I fear him. Deliver me. What is He thinking? No doubt

00:17:46.539 --> 00:17:53.099
in my mind that Jacob responds to this situation and he's thinking worst case scenario. By

00:17:53.099 --> 00:17:58.819
the way, sometimes some of us, some more than others, are worst case scenario thinkers.

00:17:58.819 --> 00:18:02.699
You know what I mean by that? Something happens, it's worst case scenario. I mean, you got

00:18:02.699 --> 00:18:06.179
a little sound in your car and it's like the whole thing needs to be replaced, the engine's

00:18:06.179 --> 00:18:10.099
just falling out. I mean, the whole deal's just, you know what I mean? Just worst case

00:18:10.099 --> 00:18:14.459
scenario kind of people. You got a little ache over here and you're like, oh man, who

00:18:14.459 --> 00:18:20.499
knows what the doctor's going to say, right? And sometimes we're just worst case scenario.

00:18:20.499 --> 00:18:25.979
That's how Jacob is looking at this situation. He's, I am afraid. But listen, what's he doing?

00:18:25.979 --> 00:18:33.539
He's letting God know. He's being transparent with God. Again, God already knows. He knows

00:18:33.539 --> 00:18:37.739
your heart. He knows your thoughts. He knows your fears. And so Jacob is coming before

00:18:37.739 --> 00:18:43.099
the Lord. He's praying and he's saying, God, I am afraid. I am fearful of this situation.

00:18:43.099 --> 00:18:48.139
I don't deserve what you've done in my life. You've been so good to me. But Lord, would

00:18:48.139 --> 00:18:54.099
you deliver me from the hand of my brother? For I fear him. Not only is he going to smite

00:18:54.099 --> 00:18:58.219
me, but also my family. This is what he's thinking. But I want you to notice that as

00:18:58.219 --> 00:19:04.859
he's praying, that he also is recognizing, in this prayer it reveals to us, that Jacob

00:19:04.859 --> 00:19:10.979
had a knowledge of what God had said to him. In verse number 9 and also in verse number

00:19:10.979 --> 00:19:18.419
12, we find that Jacob understood that God had given him direction. Notice in verse number

00:19:18.419 --> 00:19:23.820
9, Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, notice what he

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:29.579
says, the Lord which said unto me, return unto thy country and to thy kindred. So guess

00:19:29.579 --> 00:19:39.099
what? Jacob knew that he was not going back on his own will. God had given him the instruction.

00:19:39.099 --> 00:19:44.299
God had given him the direction to go back. In fact, if you turn back to Genesis chapter

00:19:44.299 --> 00:19:49.419
number 31 and look at the beginning of the chapter, notice what the Bible says in verse

00:19:49.419 --> 00:19:56.940
number 3 of Genesis 31, And the Lord said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers

00:19:56.940 --> 00:20:00.059
and to thy kindred, and I will give you rest.

00:20:00.059 --> 00:20:02.719
be with thee.

00:20:02.719 --> 00:20:04.979
That's what God told him to do.

00:20:04.979 --> 00:20:06.859
This was not Jacob that was just saying,

00:20:06.859 --> 00:20:09.819
listen, things were tough with Laban, no doubt.

00:20:09.819 --> 00:20:11.659
No doubt there was a desire for him

00:20:11.659 --> 00:20:13.119
to get out of that circumstance,

00:20:13.119 --> 00:20:18.699
but God Himself told Jacob, return.

00:20:18.699 --> 00:20:20.879
Is Jacob being obedient?

00:20:20.879 --> 00:20:21.799
He is.

00:20:21.799 --> 00:20:24.459
He's returning.

00:20:24.459 --> 00:20:26.919
But he knew what God said.

00:20:26.919 --> 00:20:29.079
He knew that God had given him

00:20:29.079 --> 00:20:31.739
that divine direction to return

00:20:31.739 --> 00:20:33.579
back to the land of his fathers.

00:20:33.579 --> 00:20:36.159
He knew that God had promised to be with them

00:20:36.159 --> 00:20:37.159
and to bless them.

00:20:37.159 --> 00:20:38.539
Notice at the end of verse 9,

00:20:38.539 --> 00:20:40.119
he says, return unto thy country

00:20:40.119 --> 00:20:41.199
and to thy kindred.

00:20:41.199 --> 00:20:42.199
Notice where he says,

00:20:42.199 --> 00:20:45.659
and I will deal well with thee.

00:20:45.659 --> 00:20:46.659
In verse 12,

00:20:46.659 --> 00:20:48.159
and thou saidst,

00:20:48.159 --> 00:20:50.159
I will surely do thee good

00:20:50.159 --> 00:20:52.759
and make thy seed as the sand of the sea,

00:20:52.759 --> 00:20:56.759
which cannot be numbered for multitude.

00:20:56.779 --> 00:20:59.399
Jacob is saying, God, you made a promise.

00:20:59.399 --> 00:21:02.859
I'm returning based upon your direction in my life.

00:21:02.859 --> 00:21:06.579
Now, understand, this isn't being irreverent.

00:21:06.579 --> 00:21:08.119
He's simply acknowledging that,

00:21:08.119 --> 00:21:09.959
God, you've led me into this,

00:21:09.959 --> 00:21:12.879
and now I'm dealing with this perceived,

00:21:12.879 --> 00:21:14.419
really it's a perception here,

00:21:14.419 --> 00:21:17.339
it's a perceived difficulty that he's going to face.

00:21:17.339 --> 00:21:19.040
He makes some assumptions

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:20.919
based upon what the messengers tell him

00:21:20.919 --> 00:21:23.259
about Esau and the 400 men that are coming

00:21:23.259 --> 00:21:25.220
and the fear that he now has,

00:21:25.259 --> 00:21:27.259
but he takes it to the Lord.

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:31.259
And as he prays,

00:21:31.259 --> 00:21:34.720
it's revealed to us that he knew what God had told him.

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:37.799
Listen, in the time when it's either real adversity

00:21:37.799 --> 00:21:40.040
as we've studied the last two Sunday mornings,

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:42.799
or even perceived adversity,

00:21:42.799 --> 00:21:46.299
do not forget God's leadership.

00:21:46.299 --> 00:21:49.220
Do not forget God's promises.

00:21:50.259 --> 00:21:53.079
That's exactly what the enemy wants us to do.

00:21:53.079 --> 00:21:57.279
Sometimes the enemy is going to bring real trial

00:21:57.279 --> 00:21:59.159
and real adversity in your life,

00:21:59.159 --> 00:22:00.699
like he did with Hezekiah,

00:22:00.699 --> 00:22:02.579
like he did with the disciples

00:22:02.579 --> 00:22:04.500
that we studied the last two Sunday mornings,

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:07.360
but sometimes, like here in the passage with Jacob,

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:09.119
sometimes it's just a perceived thing,

00:22:09.119 --> 00:22:10.500
it's an assumed thing.

00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:14.000
And the enemy would like nothing more

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.199
for Jacob to be afraid and turn back

00:22:16.199 --> 00:22:19.039
and not do what God's told him to do.

00:22:19.039 --> 00:22:21.739
The enemy doesn't want you to obey God.

00:22:21.739 --> 00:22:24.399
The enemy doesn't want me to obey God.

00:22:24.399 --> 00:22:26.619
The enemy will do whatever,

00:22:26.619 --> 00:22:28.660
within his power, whatever he's allowed to do,

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:30.779
because he's limited,

00:22:30.779 --> 00:22:33.020
he will do whatever he can to keep you and I

00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:35.360
from doing the will of God.

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:40.360
Even if it's just an assumed, perceived danger.

00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:42.580
Nothing actually had happened.

00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:46.940
But he's fearful because of what could happen.

00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:51.160
But in that moment, we must see the response of Jacob

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:55.399
and say, listen, we have to remember the promises of God.

00:22:57.199 --> 00:23:02.199
Never stop in doubt what God has led us to do by faith.

00:23:02.479 --> 00:23:04.479
I preached for an entire year,

00:23:04.479 --> 00:23:06.360
our theme was count your blessings,

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:08.979
and we talked about the blessings of the Lord,

00:23:08.979 --> 00:23:12.739
and I spent an entire year talking about increase our faith.

00:23:13.979 --> 00:23:17.160
And those two years were years in which we sought

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:20.160
to really have our faith increase

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:22.160
by remembering the blessings of God,

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:24.119
remembering the promises of God.

00:23:24.119 --> 00:23:26.559
And so often, especially in the year in which we dealt

00:23:26.559 --> 00:23:28.199
with increase our faith,

00:23:28.199 --> 00:23:32.099
we spoke about the fact that if faith is a flower,

00:23:32.099 --> 00:23:36.020
I use the analogy often that doubt is a weed.

00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:39.639
And if you want the flower to grow and to flourish,

00:23:39.639 --> 00:23:42.279
you must deal with the weeds.

00:23:42.279 --> 00:23:43.639
You must deal with doubt.

00:23:43.639 --> 00:23:45.940
It doesn't mean that doubt's never gonna come.

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:50.179
It means that when doubt comes, we deal with it,

00:23:50.179 --> 00:23:54.179
and we let the promises of God stand.

00:23:55.599 --> 00:23:59.220
Because God has given us some promises, and God is faithful.

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:01.479
God has never failed us.

00:24:01.479 --> 00:24:04.819
And God made these promises to Jacob.

00:24:04.819 --> 00:24:07.899
God gave the direction to Jacob to return.

00:24:07.899 --> 00:24:10.259
We read it at the beginning of Genesis 31.

00:24:10.259 --> 00:24:13.559
Not only did he say, return unto the land of thy fathers,

00:24:13.559 --> 00:24:14.639
but he said, unto thy kindred.

00:24:14.639 --> 00:24:17.519
Unto thy kindred, and I will be with thee.

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:19.480
God said that.

00:24:22.279 --> 00:24:25.760
Did God not know about Esau being back there?

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:26.600
Sure he did.

00:24:27.679 --> 00:24:28.839
God knew all about it.

00:24:29.919 --> 00:24:32.600
But God said, return, and I'm gonna be with you.

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:34.119
Jacob was a humble man.

00:24:34.119 --> 00:24:36.639
I mentioned already in verse number 10,

00:24:36.639 --> 00:24:38.720
where he mentions, I'm not worthy

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:40.880
of the least of all the mercies,

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:43.519
and of all the truth,

00:24:43.519 --> 00:24:45.720
which thou hast showed unto thy servant.

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:48.859
You know, we're not worthy, but we're blessed.

00:24:49.739 --> 00:24:50.700
We're blessed.

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:57.600
To know the Lord, to have his word, we're blessed.

00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:00.419
God's been so good to us.

00:25:00.419 --> 00:25:04.100
The blessing of the Lord should not cause us

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:05.339
to become prideful.

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:08.559
In fact, the blessing of the Lord should help us

00:25:08.559 --> 00:25:13.160
to remain humble, to thank God for his grace

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:14.160
and for his mercy.

00:25:15.639 --> 00:25:18.720
Where would we be without the Lord?

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:20.720
Jacob was a humble man.

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:24.959
We see the preparation, we see the prayer.

00:25:24.959 --> 00:25:26.919
I want you to notice a present for Esau.

00:25:26.919 --> 00:25:31.600
In verses 13 through 23, we find that Jacob,

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:34.000
after he concludes his prayer,

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.119
is gonna lodge in that place that night,

00:25:36.119 --> 00:25:41.040
that he gathers together and he prepares a present

00:25:41.079 --> 00:25:43.279
for his brother Esau.

00:25:43.279 --> 00:25:45.720
At the end of the chapter, and we'll focus on it next week,

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:48.040
in verses 24 through following,

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:51.359
we will speak about the interaction that he had there,

00:25:51.359 --> 00:25:54.160
but I want you to notice in these verses of Scripture

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:55.919
what Jacob does.

00:25:55.919 --> 00:25:57.040
Says this in verse 13,

00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:58.760
and he lodged there that same night

00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:03.440
and took of that which came to his hand a present

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:05.959
for Esau, his brother.

00:26:05.959 --> 00:26:09.380
We understand that the reason that he desired

00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:11.779
to send this present, it tells us in verse number 20,

00:26:11.779 --> 00:26:15.299
and say ye, moreover, behold, thy servant Jacob

00:26:15.299 --> 00:26:18.779
is behind us, for he said, I will appease him

00:26:18.779 --> 00:26:21.660
with the present that goeth before me,

00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:23.419
and afterward I will see his face.

00:26:23.419 --> 00:26:27.940
Peradventure, he will accept me, accept of me.

00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:30.579
In verse number five, we noticed already

00:26:30.579 --> 00:26:32.139
that when he sent the messengers out,

00:26:32.139 --> 00:26:35.100
he shared with us that truth that he was seeking

00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:37.019
to find grace in the sight of Esau.

00:26:37.019 --> 00:26:41.019
He now prepares this present that he would deliver

00:26:41.019 --> 00:26:44.179
to Esau, and it's desiring to appease him

00:26:44.179 --> 00:26:45.679
that he would see his face

00:26:45.679 --> 00:26:47.579
and that he would be accepted of him.

00:26:48.899 --> 00:26:52.339
I want you to notice this present is detailed for us

00:26:52.339 --> 00:26:54.779
in verse number 14 and following.

00:26:54.779 --> 00:26:57.820
The Bible says 200 she goats and 20 he goats,

00:26:57.820 --> 00:27:02.459
200 ewes and 20 rams, 30 milt camels with their colts,

00:27:02.459 --> 00:27:05.859
40 kine, 10 bulls, 20 she asses, and 10 foals,

00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:07.980
and he delivered them into the hand of his servants

00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:10.299
every drove by themselves and said unto his servants,

00:27:10.299 --> 00:27:12.619
pass over before me and put a space

00:27:12.619 --> 00:27:14.779
betwixt drove and drove.

00:27:14.779 --> 00:27:16.619
He commanded the foremost saying,

00:27:16.619 --> 00:27:19.179
when Esau my brother meeteth thee and asketh thee saying,

00:27:19.179 --> 00:27:21.660
whose art thou and whither goest thou

00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:23.660
and whose art these before thee,

00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:26.980
then thou shalt say, they be thy servant Jacob's.

00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:31.380
Notice it is a present sent unto my Lord Esau,

00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:35.399
and behold also he is behind us.

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:39.480
We find that as he prayed,

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:42.619
as we recorded and noted in verses nine through 12

00:27:42.619 --> 00:27:46.700
that Jacob is still a man that I think we can relate to.

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:49.660
We can see that though he's prayed,

00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:52.779
he now still is trying to do something in his own hand

00:27:53.899 --> 00:27:55.859
to try to appease his brother.

00:27:55.859 --> 00:27:58.700
Yeah, sometimes we're guilty of that, aren't we?

00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:01.139
We talk about take it to the Lord

00:28:01.139 --> 00:28:03.619
and the songwriter said, leave it there.

00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:06.019
You ever sing those words and think about

00:28:06.019 --> 00:28:07.679
how many times we take something to the Lord,

00:28:07.679 --> 00:28:10.459
but we don't really leave it with the Lord.

00:28:12.299 --> 00:28:13.980
So we prayed about it.

00:28:15.299 --> 00:28:19.179
Cast thy burden upon the Lord and he shall sustain thee.

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:22.459
Casting all your care upon him, why?

00:28:22.459 --> 00:28:23.959
For he careth for you.

00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:27.739
But there are times, listen, I understand we're humans.

00:28:27.739 --> 00:28:31.380
We can relate to Jacob, can we not?

00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:32.580
He prayed about it.

00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:33.940
He was like, okay, so I prayed,

00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:36.299
but now I'm gonna also get this present ready.

00:28:37.659 --> 00:28:39.779
I mean, I'm not trying to beat Jacob up

00:28:39.779 --> 00:28:41.700
because we do the same kind of thing.

00:28:42.779 --> 00:28:44.340
It might not be in the same context

00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:45.619
of what Jacob is dealing with,

00:28:45.619 --> 00:28:47.460
but what I'm saying this evening is that

00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:49.659
I hope that we can relate to Jacob

00:28:49.659 --> 00:28:51.739
and that we can learn something from the passage

00:28:51.739 --> 00:28:54.020
of Scripture and it's so interesting to me

00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:58.299
that the timing and we see God is so good

00:28:58.299 --> 00:29:01.580
and he's so sovereign and we think about the theme

00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:02.979
that I've been dealing with this year

00:29:02.979 --> 00:29:05.460
in the last several weeks and thinking about the truth

00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:08.820
that the God of the universe, the God of the creator,

00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:10.380
God, that he's our helper.

00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:14.500
And we find here that Jacob is,

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:16.460
he's trying to do something.

00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:20.820
He's still got that situation of fear going on

00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:22.500
in his heart and his life.

00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:26.059
Oh, he responds by praying and it's appropriate,

00:29:26.059 --> 00:29:28.619
but sometimes we pray,

00:29:28.619 --> 00:29:31.219
but then we try to still figure something out.

00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:34.820
We pray and then we still try to appease somebody.

00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:36.580
That's what Jacob's doing, right?

00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:37.419
Is that fair?

00:29:37.419 --> 00:29:39.460
That's what's taking place.

00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:41.859
And this evening we find that,

00:29:41.859 --> 00:29:43.739
I mean, this was a significant gift.

00:29:43.739 --> 00:29:45.700
According to verse 13, it was 200 she goats,

00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:48.539
20 he goats, 200 ewes and 20 rams.

00:29:48.539 --> 00:29:49.820
According to verse number 14,

00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:52.779
30 milch camels and their colts, 40 kine,

00:29:52.779 --> 00:29:55.020
10 bulls, 20 she asses and 10 foals.

00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:59.140
I mean, this was a serious present

00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:00.380
that Jacob has.

00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:05.700
prepared to send to Esau. What a scene! The Bible tells us in verse number 17

00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:09.180
that he commanded the foremost saying, well look back in verse 16, excuse me, he

00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:12.700
delivered them into the hands of his servants, every drove by themselves, and

00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:18.380
notice the Bible, the drove, the idea of the herds, he says every herd, every drove

00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:21.940
by themselves, and sent them to his servants, Passover before me, and put a

00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:27.020
space between, drove and drove. So ask this, this wasn't just like one arrival

00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:31.340
of servants with all of these herds, no, there was a group of

00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:35.580
servants that came with the first herd, there's a little space, and then all of

00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:38.340
a sudden there's another group of servants that come with another drove,

00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:46.300
and oh, what is all this, a present for you from Jacob? And he says in

00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:50.820
verse 17, and he commanded the foremost saying, when Esau my brother meeteth thee

00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:54.780
and asketh thee, saying whose art thou, and whither goest thou, and whose are

00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:58.860
these before thee, notice what he says, this is what you should say, they be thy

00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:06.540
servants Jacob's, it is a present unto my Lord Esau, and behold also he is behind

00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:11.940
us. So Jacob was behind, he's sending all this stuff, in verse 19, so commanded he

00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:15.860
the second, and the third, and all that followed the drove. So again, you see, can

00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:19.020
you see the scene, you see how it's unfolding? I mean Esau, the first

00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:24.020
servants come with this portion of the the present that that Jacob has

00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:28.700
provided and presented, and we find that he's, what is all this? He's like, oh, this

00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:34.740
is a present for you. A little while later, another drove comes, servants, it's a present

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:39.540
for you. It says in verse 19, and so commanded he the second, and the third,

00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:43.940
and all that followed the drove, saying, on this manner shall you speak unto Esau

00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:51.460
when you find him. So there's more than four droves that went. Can you imagine

00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:59.140
the scene? Esau, another group of people come, another group of people come, and

00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:03.260
notice verse 20, and say ye moreover, behold thy servant Jacob is behind us.

00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:07.980
For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and

00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:12.620
afterward I will see his face. Peradventure he will accept of me. So

00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:17.540
went the present over before him, and himself lodged that night in the company.

00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:22.380
As we find in verse 21 that the servants that he had commanded, and all of that

00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:26.820
livestock that is recorded in verse 13 and 14, that it went forward as he had

00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:31.740
instructed, no doubt he's seeking reconciliation. It says at the end of

00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:38.139
verse number 20, peradventure he will accept of me. He said in verse number 5, that I

00:32:38.139 --> 00:32:45.220
might find grace in thy sight. It says in verse 22, after it says this in verse 21,

00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:48.260
that he lodged that night in the company, that he rose up that night and took his

00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:52.779
two wives, his two women servants, and his 11 sons, and passed over the Ford Jabbok,

00:32:52.779 --> 00:32:59.340
and he took them and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had. Why?

00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:03.620
Because he wants to protect them. Remember what he said back as you looked

00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:07.540
in verse number 11? He said, deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother,

00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:12.220
from the hand of Esau. Why? For I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, but

00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:16.820
notice what he says, and the mother with the children. Jacob wasn't simply

00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:19.700
concerned about losing his own life, but he was concerned about his wives and his

00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:25.059
children. And so, therefore, we see his action in verse number 22 and 23, and how

00:33:25.059 --> 00:33:31.059
he rose up and put some space and separated the family in purpose of, hey,

00:33:31.059 --> 00:33:36.460
I'm trying to protect. But we're going to look at this passage of Scripture, and I

00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:40.340
don't want to get ahead of myself for next week, but the reality is that if you

00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:44.540
look at verses 24 through 32, and you find what happens here, the Bible says,

00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:47.300
and Jacob was left alone, and there wrestled a man with him until the

00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:54.580
breaking of the day. What an encounter Jacob has at the end of this chapter,

00:33:54.580 --> 00:34:01.900
and how his life has changed forever. In fact, as you look at the text of

00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:06.380
Scripture, and again, I don't want to preach the message for next week, this

00:34:06.419 --> 00:34:13.540
evening, but it tells us the end of verse number 31, and he halted upon his thigh.

00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:23.100
I look at that end of verse number 31, and I see a limp. It's something that Jacob

00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:30.420
would never forget, an encounter that would stay with him the rest of his life.

00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:41.179
Every time he would limp, when he leans upon the staff in Egypt to give a blessing,

00:34:41.179 --> 00:34:48.619
he remembered the meeting he had with God. I'm thankful for God's grace.

00:34:48.619 --> 00:34:52.899
I'm thankful that God knows our frame. I'm thankful that God knows that we're

00:34:52.899 --> 00:35:04.140
but flesh. He made us. He knows us, and I'm thankful that though Jacob prayed,

00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:10.220
and then Jacob still kept his hand in the mix and presented this present so that he

00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:15.660
could appease his brother, I'm thankful that God still met with him.

00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:22.619
That's precious to me because God knows where we are. He knows what we're dealing

00:35:22.619 --> 00:35:31.540
with, and he loves us, and he ministers to us, and the reality is that Jacob here in

00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:39.020
this text of Scripture, he brought his fear before the Lord, but you can tell by his actions

00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:47.500
that he still has a measure of fear with regard to this reunion, and in our lives this evening

00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:54.179
when we look at Genesis chapter number 32, I hope that we can relate to Jacob. I understand

00:35:54.179 --> 00:36:00.500
that the specifics are going to be different. I don't know any of us that have been separated

00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:06.420
from a brother for 20 years that wanted to kill us. Circumstances are different, but

00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:10.179
God knows your heart, and God knows what you're dealing with, and God knows if you're afraid,

00:36:10.179 --> 00:36:15.540
and he knows that anxiety that you're dealing with or whatever that opposition is that you're

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:23.700
facing. When you take it to the Lord, at times in our lives we act just like Jacob.

00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:27.500
We pour our heart out before the Lord, and then we leave from the presence of the Lord,

00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:34.179
and we go and try to figure something out. We try to take matters into our own hands.

00:36:34.179 --> 00:36:37.580
I think if we'd be honest tonight, I'll be honest with you from the pulpit, I've

00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:43.619
done it. I think if we'd be honest tonight, at times in our lives we've all done it.

00:36:43.619 --> 00:36:50.619
We try to take matters into our own hands. You know what I find out more times than not?

00:36:50.619 --> 00:36:59.540
I mess it up. I mess it up. And you know what I find out in my life? God is much better

00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:09.260
than I am. God is able to work in hearts I can't. God was able to do something in Esau's

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:15.920
heart that Jacob could never accomplish. God was able to do something in Esau's heart

00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:22.940
that no present, no matter the size, the cost, the whatever, that could never do. Why? Because

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:28.940
he's the Creator God. Because he's able. And this evening as we look at this passage

00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:32.580
of Scripture and we see the preparation, and we see that Jacob's going to meet Esau, it's

00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:38.100
been 20 years. I mean you think about the flood of emotions that would come over Jacob,

00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:43.660
and even the initial apprehension of, God, are you sure you want me to go back to that

00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:51.380
place? God, do you remember the circumstances that surrounded my departure from there?

00:37:51.380 --> 00:38:03.940
But he rose up to go. He left Padonaron. He's heading back. We went, as you told us, and

00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:12.619
we found that Esau's coming. He's got 400 men with him. Throw you for a loop sometimes.

00:38:12.619 --> 00:38:18.940
Because sometimes we have this idea that if I'm obeying the will of God that there will

00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:24.700
be no difficulties. But you know, as many times as I've read the Bible, and I've read

00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:31.700
it quite a few times, I've never found the Bible to tell me that. That if I follow God

00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:38.099
I'll have no problems, I'll have no difficulties, I'll have no opposition. In fact, I read over

00:38:38.099 --> 00:38:45.380
and over, throughout the pages of this book, people that follow the Lord, that because

00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:55.140
they follow the Lord, face difficulties. But God knew about them, and God sustained them,

00:38:55.140 --> 00:39:01.859
and God blessed them, and God grew them. You know, some of the most fascinating accounts

00:39:01.859 --> 00:39:07.580
in the Word of God, if we were to ask the children this evening, I don't like using

00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:12.020
the word story when we talk about a biblical account, but many people refer to it as a

00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:18.880
Bible story. I like using the word biblical account because its story kind of gives the

00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:29.880
idea that it's a story. Something that maybe is just made up. They're biblical accounts.

00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:36.520
And I know it's just a little nuance of syntax, but that's just my personal approach to it.

00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:42.440
But if we were to ask the kids this evening, or maybe even some of the adults, what biblical

00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:52.119
account is your favorite? I'm sure some would speak about David and Goliath. Joseph in the

00:39:52.119 --> 00:40:00.239
pit, being delivered, in the prison, being delivered. Maybe Daniel, right? Maybe Daniel

00:40:00.239 --> 00:40:05.479
the Den of Lies, maybe Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.

00:40:05.479 --> 00:40:06.479
We could go on and on.

00:40:06.479 --> 00:40:11.479
But you know what's amazing about most of those accounts?

00:40:11.479 --> 00:40:18.399
We read of those and we find that they face some difficulties, they face some adversity

00:40:18.399 --> 00:40:24.039
and some opposition, and God showed Himself mighty.

00:40:24.039 --> 00:40:30.799
He revealed His power and we look at Him and say, man, look at what God did.

00:40:30.799 --> 00:40:36.799
And then we face a difficulty and say, oh, woe is me.

00:40:36.799 --> 00:40:39.899
What might God do in our lives?

00:40:39.899 --> 00:40:48.599
How might God show Himself real in your life, in my life?

00:40:48.599 --> 00:40:51.219
Jacob's a man just like we are.

00:40:51.219 --> 00:40:53.779
He dealt with fear just like we do.

00:40:53.779 --> 00:41:03.599
He took it to the Lord and just like we do, we sometimes try to keep our hand in it.

00:41:03.599 --> 00:41:08.019
I'm thankful and we'll look at it in its entirety next week that God met with him at the end

00:41:08.019 --> 00:41:09.799
of chapter 32.

00:41:09.799 --> 00:41:14.759
You read chapter 33, it's a great reunion that takes place between Jacob and Esau.

00:41:14.759 --> 00:41:19.439
It's amazing to see the reconciliation between those two men.

00:41:19.439 --> 00:41:22.119
It's a blessing.

00:41:22.119 --> 00:41:28.739
But I hope that as we look at these, just 23 verses tonight, this preparation of Jacob,

00:41:28.739 --> 00:41:34.339
that as we relate to Jacob, say, Lord, would You help us?

00:41:34.339 --> 00:41:41.819
Would You help me to be able to see in the life of Jacob what sometimes I even do in

00:41:41.819 --> 00:41:43.779
my own life?

00:41:43.779 --> 00:41:47.699
And help me to keep my hands out of it.

00:41:47.699 --> 00:41:49.259
Let God have His way.

00:41:49.399 --> 00:41:56.319
Let God do what only God can do because He is able.

00:41:56.319 --> 00:41:57.319
We sing it.

00:41:57.319 --> 00:41:58.319
He is able.

00:41:58.319 --> 00:41:59.439
He is able.

00:41:59.439 --> 00:42:02.599
I know He is able.

00:42:02.599 --> 00:42:03.979
He is able to deliver thee.

00:42:03.979 --> 00:42:06.119
We sing the hymn.

00:42:06.119 --> 00:42:07.279
Deliver thee from what?

00:42:07.279 --> 00:42:08.279
From anything.

00:42:08.279 --> 00:42:09.279
From anything.

00:42:09.279 --> 00:42:13.239
Isn't that what Darius said to Daniel?

00:42:13.239 --> 00:42:19.659
He said, Daniel, is thy God that thou servest continually, able to deliver thee?

00:42:19.659 --> 00:42:28.599
Isn't it amazing that Darius had such a high view of Daniel and of Daniel's God?

00:42:28.599 --> 00:42:31.499
Because Daniel was a man that walked with God.

00:42:31.499 --> 00:42:33.739
Daniel had a great testimony.

00:42:33.739 --> 00:42:38.539
And Daniel returned word, he is.

00:42:38.539 --> 00:42:41.579
They've not touched me all night.

00:42:41.579 --> 00:42:46.359
Those men that accused, they didn't hit the ground before they were devoured.

00:42:46.359 --> 00:42:48.559
Our God is able.

00:42:48.559 --> 00:42:49.559
Let's pray.

00:42:49.559 --> 00:42:50.559
Father, we love You.

00:42:50.559 --> 00:42:51.919
We thank You for loving us.

00:42:51.919 --> 00:42:58.219
As we look at this account tonight of Jacob and his preparation, Lord, I pray that in

00:42:58.219 --> 00:43:10.699
our lives, we deal with opposition, whether real or assumed.

00:43:10.699 --> 00:43:19.819
As we see in the text tonight, this was just an assumed problem, the perception of Jacob.

00:43:19.819 --> 00:43:23.679
Worst case scenario thinking.

00:43:23.679 --> 00:43:29.519
No doubt in our lives, there are times that we've been guilty of the same thing.

00:43:29.519 --> 00:43:31.919
I thank You that Jacob prayed.

00:43:31.919 --> 00:43:37.599
Lord, I pray that we'd come to You, seeking Your face.

00:43:37.599 --> 00:43:49.419
Lord, I pray that we'd learn from the life of Jacob to leave it with You, to trust You,

00:43:49.419 --> 00:43:55.859
to know that You are the God that spoke everything into existence, that You rule and that You

00:43:55.859 --> 00:44:01.219
reign, that You're our God and that You're able.

00:44:01.219 --> 00:44:08.059
So often, we mess things up by trying to get our own hands into the mix.

00:44:08.059 --> 00:44:14.899
Lord, I pray that You would help us to simply trust You, help us to follow You, help us

00:44:14.899 --> 00:44:16.739
to obey You.

00:44:16.739 --> 00:44:20.579
I pray that in a moment of invitation this evening, that You'd move and work in hearts

00:44:20.579 --> 00:44:22.339
and lives as only You can.

00:44:22.339 --> 00:44:25.739
Well, thank You for all that You'll do, for it's in Christ's name we pray.
