WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.400
Genesis, chapter number 31, and be looking at verses 17 down through verse number 37

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.600
this evening as we continue our study here through the book of Genesis.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.880
Genesis, chapter 31, verses 17 down through verse number 37.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.520
The passage of Scripture that is before us this evening provides us with a record of

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.719
Jacob's departure from Paddan Aram.

00:00:22.719 --> 00:00:28.000
Remember, he had been in our previous text of Scripture as we studied last time.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
We really looked at the latter part of chapter 30 and into the first 16 verses of chapter

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.240
31, and God had appeared to Jacob and God told him in verse number 3 as it's recorded

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:44.240
in chapter 31, and the Lord said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers and to

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.159
thy kindred and I will be with thee.

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:51.759
Remember as we studied a couple of weeks ago that Jacob then has a conversation with his

00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:58.080
wives and he calls Leah and Rachel and they, he begins to share with them what God has

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.000
done and how God has directed, and we know that as we study the passage of Scripture

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.940
that it's now been 20 years since he first arrived in this place.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.400
God had given him specific instruction to depart, and as we look in verse number 17

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.480
of Genesis 31, the Bible says, Then Jacob rose up and set his sons and his wives upon

00:01:19.519 --> 00:01:24.000
camels, and he carried away all his cattle and all his goods which he had gotten, the

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.639
cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in Paddan Aram, for to go to Isaac his father

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:31.559
in the land of Canaan.

00:01:31.559 --> 00:01:35.519
Notice the opportunity that presented itself in verse number 19, the Bible tells us that

00:01:35.519 --> 00:01:41.400
Laban went to shear his sheep, and so when Laban went to shear his sheep, Laban was not

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.680
going to allow Jacob to leave without a problem, and so Laban goes to shear his sheep and the

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.599
opportunity presents itself, and Jacob is going to depart.

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:55.800
As you study through the passage of Scripture, you find that Laban does pursue after, eventually

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.639
overtakes, and there's discussion that we'll look at.

00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:03.319
But notice the end of verse number 19, the Bible says, And Rachel had stolen the images

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:05.680
that were her father's.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.479
If you look down in verse number 34, the Bible says, Now Rachel had taken the images and

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:17.559
put them in the camel's furniture and sat upon them, and Laban searched all the tent,

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:18.880
but found them not.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:25.160
I've titled the message, as you see in the bulletin today, What's in Your Tent?

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.160
What's in Your Tent?

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.880
As we think about this passage of Scripture, and we think about that which is recorded

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.759
for us, and the departure of Jacob, and of course, as we continue to study through the

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:40.600
book of Genesis, we see chapter 32 and 33 provide for us the reconciliation with Esau

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.960
and the reunion and what have you.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:48.139
But before they get out of the land there in Paddan Aram, we find that there's this

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:55.080
interesting section of Genesis chapter 31 that God gives us about these stolen images

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.720
that Rachel took.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.080
And as we look at the passage of Scripture, I hope that God would help us to see the historical

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.800
context of what's going on, but then also to evaluate our lives and say, What's in my

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.080
tent?

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.720
Because the reality is that Rachel knew what was in her tent, and we'll see that as we

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.520
go through the text of Scripture.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.039
And the reality this evening is that you know what's in your tent as well.

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:19.039
Amen?

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:20.800
And here's what the Bible says in verse 19.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.119
It says that Rachel had stolen the images that were her father's.

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:30.199
Know this, it says in verse 20, and Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, and

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:32.880
that he told him not that he fled.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.199
So he fled with all that he had, and he rose up and passed over the river and set his face

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.960
toward the Mount Gilead.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:46.639
It says that it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled, and he took his brethren

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:52.919
with him and pursued after him seven days' journey, and they overtook him in the Mount

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:54.479
Gilead.

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:58.199
I want you to notice as we look at the passage of Scripture, and we'll kind of, same deal

00:03:58.199 --> 00:04:02.440
as this morning, the first two thoughts are pretty brief, and we'll focus our attention

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.479
on the third thought this evening.

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:07.679
But I want you to notice, first of all, Jacob's ignorance.

00:04:07.679 --> 00:04:13.479
As we look at the passage of Scripture, Jacob is unaware of what Rachel had done.

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:19.839
Jacob has no idea, according to what the Scriptures tell us, that she had taken these goods.

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:25.279
And we think, I look at the passage of Scripture, and I notice that his behavior would support

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:27.359
the fact that he did not know.

00:04:27.359 --> 00:04:33.480
It tells us that as Laban comes, there's going to be this interaction between Jacob and Laban,

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.760
and God intervened.

00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:36.839
God spoke to Laban.

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:41.040
He appeared to Laban, according to verse 24, the Syrian in a dream by night.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.600
He said, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob, either good or bad.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.200
Then Laban overtook Jacob.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.359
Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the Mount, and Laban with his brethren pitched in the

00:04:51.359 --> 00:04:52.359
Mount of Gilead.

00:04:52.359 --> 00:04:56.160
And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done?

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.480
Thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters as captives, taken

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:01.839
with the sword.

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:06.200
Therefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me, and didst not tell

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.760
me that I might have sent thee away with mirth, with songs, with tabernacle, with harp?

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.519
And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters?

00:05:13.519 --> 00:05:16.679
Thou hast now done foolishly in so doing."

00:05:16.679 --> 00:05:21.559
Notice where he says, It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt.

00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:27.359
But the God of your father spake unto me yesterday night, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak

00:05:27.359 --> 00:05:29.839
not to Jacob, either good or bad.

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:32.119
I'm thankful that God intervened.

00:05:32.119 --> 00:05:36.600
And Jacob is in the situation where he no doubt is thankful that God appeared to Laban

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:37.600
as well.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.160
And Laban hearkened to that which God had spoken to him.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:46.640
And it says in verse number 30, And now, though thou wouldst needs be gone, because thou sore

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:53.959
longest after thy father's house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?

00:05:53.959 --> 00:05:58.220
And these images that are referred to in verse number 19, that Rachel had stolen the images

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:03.100
that were her father's, we find that Laban refers to them in verse number 30 as being

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:04.820
his gods.

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:09.839
We find that these idols, if you will, these household gods, they would be stored and no

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:18.179
doubt they carried some significance for them as not only idol worship, but even potentially

00:06:18.179 --> 00:06:25.459
as being part of their monetary gain and how they would put, boil down and melt down their

00:06:26.019 --> 00:06:29.100
silver and gold and make these images and so on and so forth.

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:36.540
And obviously Laban is concerned most about these images, these gods that had been stolen.

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:41.299
And Jacob answered and said to Laban, because I was afraid, and I said, Peradventure thou

00:06:41.299 --> 00:06:45.100
wouldst take by force thy daughters from me.

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:50.100
And so Jacob is being confronted by Laban here and Jacob responds.

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:56.619
And notice what Jacob says in verse number 32, with whomsoever thou findest thy gods,

00:06:56.619 --> 00:06:58.980
let him not live.

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:04.019
That's pretty significant.

00:07:04.019 --> 00:07:10.339
He says, before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me and take it to thee.

00:07:10.339 --> 00:07:15.339
And then the Bible says, for Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.

00:07:15.339 --> 00:07:21.019
Now what we know about the relationship between Jacob and Rachel is that Jacob loved Rachel,

00:07:21.019 --> 00:07:22.019
right?

00:07:22.019 --> 00:07:26.739
Remember, as we studied several weeks ago, all of that family division between Rachel

00:07:26.739 --> 00:07:31.820
and Leah and how Leah thought she wanted so desperately what Rachel had.

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:32.820
And what was that?

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:37.540
That was the love of Jacob and Rachel wanted so desperately what Leah had.

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:38.540
What was that?

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:39.799
That was children.

00:07:39.799 --> 00:07:44.739
And we find that that dispute, the carnality and all that took place, and now we find that

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:49.899
Jacob having this love for his wife, Rachel, that the Scriptures tell us that he knew not

00:07:49.899 --> 00:07:51.899
that Rachel had stolen them.

00:07:51.899 --> 00:07:56.019
But I want you to see that, as I mentioned, not only the statement of Scripture but the

00:07:56.019 --> 00:08:03.660
behavior of Jacob, for he says to Laban, with whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:05.739
not live.

00:08:05.739 --> 00:08:10.260
Now if Jacob knew that Rachel had stolen the images, the gods, do you think he would have

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:15.420
said, with whomsoever thou find they shall not live?

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:18.380
Not a chance.

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:24.220
So we find here that as we look at the passage of Scripture, I know the ignorance of Jacob

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:29.579
and we find that as we continue through the passage of Scripture that evidently at some

00:08:29.579 --> 00:08:34.539
level permission had been granted to Laban to search.

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:39.059
And the search begins, according to verse number 33, and that's where we pick up and

00:08:39.059 --> 00:08:43.859
notice something about Laban, and I notice Laban's persistence.

00:08:43.859 --> 00:08:46.940
Laban is searching and searching and searching, he's trying to find these images, he's trying

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:51.500
to find these false gods, these idols, and the Bible says in verse 33,

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:58.580
And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the two maidservants'

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:01.460
tents, that's Bilhah and Zilpah.

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:06.219
But notice this phrase, but he found them not.

00:09:06.219 --> 00:09:11.140
Then went he out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:15.580
Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in camel's furniture, and sat upon them.

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:19.780
And Laban searched all the tent, but found them not.

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:24.739
She said to her father, Let it not displease my Lord, that I cannot rise up before thee,

00:09:24.739 --> 00:09:27.179
for the custom of women is upon me.

00:09:27.179 --> 00:09:30.260
And he searched, but found not the images.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:35.859
But you notice that on three occasions we read how that he found them not.

00:09:35.859 --> 00:09:41.539
In verse 33, and again in verse number 34, it says that very plainly, but found them

00:09:41.539 --> 00:09:42.539
not.

00:09:42.539 --> 00:09:47.340
And in verse 35 it says that he found not the images.

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:49.719
But he was persistent, he was searching.

00:09:49.719 --> 00:09:53.940
He didn't just search one tent, he searched all of it, he searched high and low, and he

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:54.940
looked everywhere.

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:57.380
Have you ever been in a situation where you're searching for something?

00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:00.059
And listen, these images, these false gods, these

00:10:00.059 --> 00:10:05.299
idols that Rachel had stolen away, Laban wanted these.

00:10:05.299 --> 00:10:08.139
He had pursued after Jacob this journey.

00:10:08.139 --> 00:10:14.579
He takes a group of people with him, and he overtakes Jacob, and he desires to have these

00:10:14.579 --> 00:10:20.019
images returned, and he's persistent in his search.

00:10:20.019 --> 00:10:25.059
But as we look at the text of Scripture after the Scriptures declare to us that he searched

00:10:25.059 --> 00:10:30.539
and found not the images, the Bible tells us in verse number 36 that Jacob is now angry.

00:10:30.539 --> 00:10:35.419
He's wroth with Laban, and they began to have this argument as it's recorded in verse 36

00:10:35.419 --> 00:10:39.859
and 37, and it really carries into the next message that we'll have at the end of this

00:10:39.859 --> 00:10:40.939
chapter.

00:10:40.939 --> 00:10:45.659
But the Bible says this in verse 36, and Jacob was wroth and chode with Laban, and Jacob

00:10:45.659 --> 00:10:48.579
answered and said to Laban, what is my trespass?

00:10:48.579 --> 00:10:53.299
What is my sin that thou hast so hotly pursued after me?

00:10:53.299 --> 00:11:00.339
As thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff?

00:11:00.339 --> 00:11:06.459
Set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both.

00:11:06.459 --> 00:11:12.059
The reality is that Laban found nothing, Laban found nothing.

00:11:12.059 --> 00:11:17.699
But the something that he was looking for was there, he just didn't find it, right?

00:11:17.699 --> 00:11:23.099
So Jacob's angry, Jacob's arguing, Jacob's saying, what is my trespass, what is my sin?

00:11:23.899 --> 00:11:27.819
You have searched everything, you've searched all my stuff.

00:11:27.819 --> 00:11:34.339
Come on, show us the evidence, bring it out here and let the brethren judge betwixt us.

00:11:34.339 --> 00:11:35.339
Couldn't produce anything.

00:11:35.339 --> 00:11:39.659
And that's what leads us to our third thought this evening.

00:11:39.659 --> 00:11:43.019
I want you to notice Rachel's behavior.

00:11:43.019 --> 00:11:50.899
We've already read the verses of Scripture, but I would say this, Rachel knew and God

00:11:50.899 --> 00:11:51.899
knew.

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:55.339
And really, that's the most important thing, isn't it?

00:11:55.339 --> 00:11:56.899
That God knows.

00:11:56.899 --> 00:11:59.739
Who wrote the book of Genesis from a human perspective?

00:11:59.739 --> 00:12:00.739
Moses.

00:12:00.739 --> 00:12:05.860
Moses wasn't even thought of at this point in human history, right?

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:08.940
And he'd be the human penman that God would use to write this.

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:13.580
We understand that all Scripture is given by inspiration of God and before Laban ever

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:20.380
overtakes Jacob and his family, God reveals to us in the written Word of God that Rachel

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:24.339
had stolen the images that were her father's in verse number 19.

00:12:24.339 --> 00:12:27.139
God knows.

00:12:27.139 --> 00:12:30.819
And here we find that Rachel knew exactly what had taken place.

00:12:30.819 --> 00:12:32.459
She knew what she was doing.

00:12:32.459 --> 00:12:36.259
The Scriptures tell us in verse number 34 that she had taken the images.

00:12:36.259 --> 00:12:41.539
Notice that she puts them in the camel's furniture and then she sits upon them, those pieces

00:12:41.539 --> 00:12:45.339
of furniture where she hid the images that she had taken.

00:12:45.339 --> 00:12:50.360
And she sits there in her tent and she sits on that furniture where those images are hidden

00:12:51.339 --> 00:12:53.080
She knows exactly what's in those images.

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:55.239
She knows exactly what she's doing.

00:12:55.239 --> 00:13:01.959
And I would say this, that after she hides the images, then she lies to her father.

00:13:01.959 --> 00:13:08.639
Laban comes in and verse 35 tells us that she says, let it not displease my Lord.

00:13:08.639 --> 00:13:12.679
Daddy, don't be upset with me.

00:13:12.679 --> 00:13:17.199
I'm not going to be able to stand up and offer you the reverence that is customary.

00:13:17.199 --> 00:13:18.199
Why?

00:13:18.199 --> 00:13:21.720
Because the custom of women is upon me.

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:28.520
So therefore he respects that which she states as being factual, though she is lying.

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:32.039
He searched everywhere else and he found them not.

00:13:32.039 --> 00:13:33.039
Why?

00:13:33.039 --> 00:13:37.679
Because they were in the furniture that she was sitting on.

00:13:37.679 --> 00:13:43.759
And as we begin to think about this behavior of Rachel, we find here this evening that

00:13:43.759 --> 00:13:48.279
just as we've discussed in other portions of Scripture, we spoke about the truth in

00:13:48.279 --> 00:13:53.559
Genesis chapter number three, where somebody there, as we look at the fall of man and Adam

00:13:53.559 --> 00:13:58.720
and Eve and how Eve desired the fruit and she took the fruit, she ate the fruit.

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:02.839
The Bible tells us that what did Adam and Eve do after their eyes were opened?

00:14:02.839 --> 00:14:04.959
They hid themselves.

00:14:04.959 --> 00:14:09.720
They tried to make fig leaves to cover themselves.

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:13.639
And we find here this evening that throughout the Word of God, as we study the Scriptures,

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:19.559
that there is a progression to sin, if you will.

00:14:19.559 --> 00:14:21.239
There's a desire for something.

00:14:21.239 --> 00:14:25.720
No doubt there was an interest that Rachel had in these images, whether it was that she

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:30.919
wanted to continue to worship these false gods or whether it was that she wanted the

00:14:30.919 --> 00:14:35.119
value of the monetary value of these particular images.

00:14:35.119 --> 00:14:39.799
There are scholars that debate the two as to what it was that she really desired to

00:14:39.799 --> 00:14:45.040
have, but the reality is that there was something that drove her to the place of stealing these

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:48.799
images.

00:14:48.799 --> 00:14:54.399
And then it has to be covered, and then there has to be lying, right?

00:14:54.399 --> 00:14:59.359
We see how that pattern, that progression of sin, if you will.

00:14:59.359 --> 00:15:01.559
And I titled the message, What's in Your Tent?

00:15:01.559 --> 00:15:05.519
Because the reality is that as we look at this passage of Scripture, that when Rachel

00:15:05.559 --> 00:15:11.760
made the decision, when she chose to steal these, she then goes on this downward spiral

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:18.760
where this single sin of stealing these images begins to lead to more sin.

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:24.359
I want you to think about this as well, as we think about what's taking place here and

00:15:24.359 --> 00:15:27.720
we think about the response of Jacob to Laban.

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:33.559
I want you to think about this when we consider the deception of sin.

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:39.040
You know Hebrews talks about the deceitfulness of sin.

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:41.399
And I want you to think about this.

00:15:41.399 --> 00:15:45.440
We may be able to deceive other people.

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:53.839
In fact, we may be able to deceive the people that are closest to us, Jacob.

00:15:53.839 --> 00:15:56.399
Jacob didn't know.

00:15:56.399 --> 00:16:05.600
He offers to say, whoever you find the goods with, let him not live.

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:09.839
Rachel was clever, quote-unquote.

00:16:09.839 --> 00:16:15.679
By the way, it's not good to be good at sin, amen?

00:16:15.679 --> 00:16:19.600
God gives indictment towards the children of Israel, the nation of Judah, why?

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:22.720
Because they were wise to do evil.

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:25.559
That's not a compliment.

00:16:25.559 --> 00:16:29.119
That's not the kind of wisdom that we desire, amen?

00:16:29.119 --> 00:16:30.119
Wise to do evil.

00:16:30.119 --> 00:16:34.119
No, no, no, that's not what we desire.

00:16:34.119 --> 00:16:36.119
Jacob knew not.

00:16:36.119 --> 00:16:46.359
She was able to deceive Leah, the handmaids, the children, her husband, but there's one

00:16:46.359 --> 00:16:54.799
person she can't deceive, and that's God, because God knows.

00:16:54.799 --> 00:16:59.320
It seems as if when you look at this passage of Scripture, when you conclude throughout

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:03.919
the text of Scripture in Genesis 31, someone could take a view of this passage of Scripture

00:17:03.919 --> 00:17:08.959
and say something like this, she got away with it.

00:17:08.959 --> 00:17:12.880
Can I tell you, you never get away with sin.

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:18.600
Be not deceived, God is not mocked, for it's a remand soweth, that shall he also reap,

00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:19.919
Galatians 6.

00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:27.079
We find here this evening that the deception that is obvious in the text of Scripture,

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:33.200
the deception by which she, the length at which she goes to deceive her father and to

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:40.239
create this story, the depravity of the heart.

00:17:40.239 --> 00:17:44.399
This evening as we think about this passage of Scripture and we ask the question, what's

00:17:44.399 --> 00:17:45.399
in your tent?

00:17:45.399 --> 00:17:49.399
I want to remind you of another account that we have in the Word of God.

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:52.959
Turn to the book of Joshua, if you will.

00:17:52.959 --> 00:17:59.359
Look at Joshua chapter number 7.

00:17:59.359 --> 00:18:06.600
In Joshua chapter number 7, we begin reading the passage of Scripture having knowledge

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:09.919
that Joshua does not yet have.

00:18:09.919 --> 00:18:15.839
For the Bible declares to us in verse 1 the situation, but the reality is that Joshua

00:18:15.839 --> 00:18:22.119
is not yet aware at this particular time as to all that had taken place.

00:18:22.119 --> 00:18:25.359
In Joshua 7 and verse number 1, the Bible says, but the children of Israel committed

00:18:25.359 --> 00:18:29.359
a trespass in the accursed thing.

00:18:29.359 --> 00:18:35.919
For Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah of the tribe of Judah, took

00:18:35.919 --> 00:18:38.039
of the accursed thing.

00:18:38.039 --> 00:18:40.440
The anger of the Lord was kindled against the children of Israel.

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:46.039
It's interesting, we find that this man Achan, he is referred to as being the troubler of

00:18:46.039 --> 00:18:47.039
Israel.

00:18:47.039 --> 00:18:50.559
That's not a great way to be remembered, is it?

00:18:50.559 --> 00:18:53.719
The troubler of Israel.

00:18:53.719 --> 00:18:59.520
But we find that what happened, there's defeat at Ai, and as we read of the defeat at Ai

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:05.239
here in this passage of Scripture, we find that these men go out, there's a situation

00:19:05.239 --> 00:19:09.359
where there's a trespass that's been committed, but we also find that there's a measure of

00:19:09.359 --> 00:19:13.279
pride where they say, let not all of us go up, just let a certain amount, so on and so

00:19:13.279 --> 00:19:14.279
forth.

00:19:14.279 --> 00:19:21.039
And we find that there were 36 men that died that lost their lives at Ai.

00:19:21.039 --> 00:19:25.919
Joshua in verse number 6, he rinses clothes, I mean, he's discouraged because of what's

00:19:25.919 --> 00:19:29.799
taken place, and he falls upon the earth upon his face.

00:19:29.799 --> 00:19:35.440
And the Bible tells us in verse 7 that Joshua said, alas, O Lord God, wherefore hast thou

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:40.599
at all brought this people over Jordan to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites to

00:19:40.599 --> 00:19:41.599
destroy us?

00:19:41.599 --> 00:19:46.359
Would to God we had been content and dwelt at the other side, Jordan.

00:19:46.359 --> 00:19:51.479
O Lord, what shall I say when Israel turneth their backs before their enemies?

00:19:51.479 --> 00:19:55.400
For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it, and shall environ

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:58.440
us, or surround us, and cut off our name from the earth.

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:00.039
And what wilt thou do unto them?

00:20:00.039 --> 00:20:02.639
thy great name."

00:20:02.639 --> 00:20:04.639
Notice what God says.

00:20:04.639 --> 00:20:08.299
He says, get up.

00:20:08.299 --> 00:20:15.559
In verse number 10, the Lord said unto Joshua, get thee up, wherefore liest thou thus upon

00:20:15.559 --> 00:20:16.559
thy face?

00:20:16.559 --> 00:20:23.239
And then notice the three words that start verse number 11, Israel hath sinned.

00:20:24.239 --> 00:20:31.159
Achan, the troubler of Israel, he took from the spoils at Jericho, which were not to be

00:20:31.159 --> 00:20:35.859
taken of, a picture of the firstfruits.

00:20:35.859 --> 00:20:40.359
We find here that he says, Israel hath sinned, and they also have transgressed my covenant

00:20:40.359 --> 00:20:45.339
which I commanded them, for they have even taken of the accursed thing, and have also

00:20:45.339 --> 00:20:49.859
stolen and dissembled also, and they have put it even among their own stuff.

00:20:49.859 --> 00:20:53.339
So the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies, but turned their backs

00:20:53.339 --> 00:20:56.059
before their enemies, because they were accursed.

00:20:56.059 --> 00:21:00.759
Neither will I be with you anymore, except you destroy the accursed from among you.

00:21:00.759 --> 00:21:06.859
The severity of the consequence at the end of verse number 12 is astounding.

00:21:06.859 --> 00:21:12.059
God says, listen, if you don't deal with this, I'm not going to be with you anymore.

00:21:12.059 --> 00:21:15.019
That's pretty serious, is it not?

00:21:15.179 --> 00:21:20.539
See, God never reveals an evil that He doesn't expect us to deal with.

00:21:20.539 --> 00:21:22.079
He's exposing the sin here.

00:21:22.079 --> 00:21:24.499
We know the text of Scripture, we know what happens.

00:21:24.499 --> 00:21:28.779
I want you to think about the scene, if you will, here in Achan's life, and I want you

00:21:28.779 --> 00:21:33.379
to think about what's taking place where God gives Joshua the instruction, the direction

00:21:33.379 --> 00:21:37.739
on what to do to bring and to expose the offender.

00:21:37.739 --> 00:21:44.019
Now all along, who knows what has happened?

00:21:44.019 --> 00:21:46.899
Achan, right?

00:21:46.899 --> 00:21:49.939
Achan knows that he took the accursed thing.

00:21:49.939 --> 00:21:52.979
Achan is absolutely aware of what's taking place.

00:21:52.979 --> 00:21:56.379
Joshua doesn't know.

00:21:56.379 --> 00:21:59.219
God knows, and Achan knows.

00:21:59.219 --> 00:22:01.299
Who knew in Genesis 31?

00:22:01.299 --> 00:22:08.339
Laban didn't know, Jacob didn't know, but Rachel knew, and God knew.

00:22:08.339 --> 00:22:10.459
And here we find that it says in verse number 14,

00:22:10.459 --> 00:22:30.719
I can't even begin to imagine the amount of weight and pressure that must have been

00:22:30.719 --> 00:22:32.659
on Achan through this process.

00:22:32.659 --> 00:22:37.259
You ever think about it as you read this passage of Scripture?

00:22:38.259 --> 00:22:44.499
Uh-oh, narrowed in, right?

00:22:44.499 --> 00:22:48.859
And here we find that it says it shall be that he that, in verse 15, is taken with the

00:22:48.859 --> 00:22:53.019
accursed thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath.

00:22:53.019 --> 00:22:54.019
Why?

00:22:54.019 --> 00:22:56.659
Because he hath transgressed the covenant of the Lord, and because he hath wrought folly

00:22:56.659 --> 00:22:57.739
in Israel.

00:22:57.739 --> 00:22:58.739
So what does Joshua do?

00:22:58.739 --> 00:22:59.739
He obeys the Lord.

00:22:59.739 --> 00:23:03.299
He rose up early in the morning, brought Israel by their tribes, and the tribe of Judah was

00:23:03.299 --> 00:23:05.459
taken.

00:23:05.459 --> 00:23:06.459
Not the tribe of Dan.

00:23:07.059 --> 00:23:08.059
You go through the whole list.

00:23:08.059 --> 00:23:09.059
No, the tribe of Judah.

00:23:09.059 --> 00:23:11.859
The tribe of Judah is taken.

00:23:11.859 --> 00:23:16.419
And then the Bible tells us in verse 17 that he brought the family of Judah, and he took

00:23:16.419 --> 00:23:22.019
the family of the Zarhites, and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man, and

00:23:22.019 --> 00:23:26.859
Zabdai was taken, and he brought his household man by man.

00:23:26.859 --> 00:23:30.019
Again, the narrowing in.

00:23:30.019 --> 00:23:32.419
Achan knows.

00:23:32.419 --> 00:23:36.819
Is there a thought, perhaps, in Achan's mind that maybe they'll just pick the wrong guy?

00:23:36.819 --> 00:23:41.859
I mean, maybe he's hoping against hope, so to speak, but it's just narrowing in, and

00:23:41.859 --> 00:23:44.859
it's narrowing in, and it's getting closer and getting closer.

00:23:44.859 --> 00:23:48.939
And eventually, the Bible tells us in verse number 18, he brought his household man by

00:23:48.939 --> 00:23:54.239
man, and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdai, the son of Zerah, and the tribe

00:23:54.239 --> 00:23:56.899
of Judah was taken.

00:23:56.899 --> 00:23:58.459
Notice what Joshua says unto Achan.

00:23:58.459 --> 00:23:59.459
He says,

00:24:00.459 --> 00:24:14.779
What did he do?

00:24:14.779 --> 00:24:20.339
Well, he saw, according to verse number 21, among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment,

00:24:20.339 --> 00:24:24.419
two hundred shekels of silver and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, and I coveted

00:24:24.419 --> 00:24:26.379
them and I took them.

00:24:26.379 --> 00:24:32.819
Behold, notice the next phrase, they are hid in the earth, in the midst of what?

00:24:32.819 --> 00:24:38.379
In the midst of my tent, and the silver under it.

00:24:38.379 --> 00:24:41.579
Achan knew what was in his tent.

00:24:41.579 --> 00:24:44.059
Rachel knew what was in her tent.

00:24:44.059 --> 00:24:49.259
I would say this evening, whatever it is this evening, that we know what's in our tent.

00:24:49.259 --> 00:24:53.339
Listen, we might have someone else deceived.

00:24:53.339 --> 00:25:01.539
We might have the closest people to us deceived, but there's not one of us without sin, right?

00:25:01.539 --> 00:25:07.739
And the reality is that God desires that we would confess and forsake our sin.

00:25:07.739 --> 00:25:13.699
God desires that we would be clean, that we would live lives that are holy and pure.

00:25:13.699 --> 00:25:16.739
This evening we're going to take the Lord's Supper, and part of observing the Lord's Supper

00:25:16.739 --> 00:25:22.299
is let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of this bread and drink of this cup.

00:25:22.299 --> 00:25:24.059
It's a table of examination.

00:25:24.059 --> 00:25:28.979
The process of self-examination is so important in the life of a believer.

00:25:28.979 --> 00:25:35.499
The process of self-examination is not perhaps the most desirable thing to do.

00:25:35.499 --> 00:25:37.899
It requires humility.

00:25:37.899 --> 00:25:43.499
It requires honesty, that I'm going to be honest before the Lord, that I'm going to

00:25:43.499 --> 00:25:48.699
say to the Lord, search me, as the psalmist says in Psalm 139.

00:25:48.699 --> 00:25:49.699
Search me, Lord.

00:25:50.099 --> 00:25:53.459
Listen, Rachel didn't say, search my tent.

00:25:53.459 --> 00:25:54.459
Why not?

00:25:54.459 --> 00:25:57.499
She knew what was in her tent.

00:25:57.499 --> 00:25:58.779
She had to come up with a story.

00:25:58.779 --> 00:26:04.539
She had to lie and deceive her father because she didn't want him to search her tent.

00:26:04.539 --> 00:26:09.299
Achan, before he was taken and the manner in which he was taken, he wasn't offering

00:26:09.299 --> 00:26:11.259
for anyone to search his tent.

00:26:11.259 --> 00:26:12.259
Why?

00:26:12.259 --> 00:26:14.739
Because he knew what was in his tent, right?

00:26:14.739 --> 00:26:21.179
And if we're not careful, we can get really good at hiding things, get really good at

00:26:21.179 --> 00:26:22.179
covering things.

00:26:22.179 --> 00:26:25.179
But I want to remind you what the Word of God says.

00:26:25.179 --> 00:26:37.419
Turn, if you will, to Psalm 69.

00:26:37.419 --> 00:26:41.339
In Psalm 69, it's a psalm that's ascribed to David.

00:26:41.339 --> 00:26:50.459
I want you to consider the truth of verse number 5, Psalm 69 and verse number 5.

00:26:50.459 --> 00:26:52.339
Notice what the Word of God says.

00:26:52.339 --> 00:27:05.179
Oh God, thou knowest my foolishness and my sins are not hid from thee.

00:27:05.179 --> 00:27:10.859
I mentioned that the psalm is ascribed to David because David learned this lesson personally

00:27:10.859 --> 00:27:13.579
as well, did he not?

00:27:13.579 --> 00:27:19.019
Did David think that he somehow perfectly covered his sin?

00:27:19.019 --> 00:27:24.139
I mean, in his mind, he's sinned with Bathsheba, but now she's with child and so I'm going

00:27:24.139 --> 00:27:28.839
to have Uriah, her husband, come back so that he would go home to his wife and everyone

00:27:28.839 --> 00:27:33.099
would just think that that's their child.

00:27:33.099 --> 00:27:38.579
But Uriah comes back and he refuses to go home.

00:27:38.579 --> 00:27:41.259
Not once.

00:27:41.259 --> 00:27:47.899
We find that David gives him opportunity and then when Uriah continues to refuse so that

00:27:47.899 --> 00:27:53.259
David cannot hide or cover his sin in that manner, what does David do?

00:27:53.259 --> 00:28:02.099
David then sends with Uriah his death sentence, put him in the forefront of the hottest battle.

00:28:02.099 --> 00:28:04.059
And Uriah was killed.

00:28:04.059 --> 00:28:07.639
He was murdered.

00:28:07.639 --> 00:28:08.739
So then what can David do?

00:28:08.739 --> 00:28:12.979
Well now David can take Bathsheba to be his wife.

00:28:12.979 --> 00:28:15.019
And there's months that pass by.

00:28:15.019 --> 00:28:17.739
How do we know that there are months?

00:28:17.739 --> 00:28:25.059
Because the baby's born and Nathan stands before David, David the king, but Nathan the

00:28:25.059 --> 00:28:27.139
prophet.

00:28:27.139 --> 00:28:31.539
And Nathan tells David a story.

00:28:31.539 --> 00:28:38.099
And when David hears the story, David is upset.

00:28:38.099 --> 00:28:44.380
He's bothered by what has been presented to him as being the offense.

00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:49.539
And Nathan says, thou art the man.

00:28:49.539 --> 00:28:52.940
Guess what David learned on that day?

00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:59.380
My sins are not hid from thee.

00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:05.899
David would confess, as we would read in Psalm 51, that great psalm of repentance against

00:29:05.899 --> 00:29:10.779
thee, and thee only have I done this wickedness.

00:29:10.779 --> 00:29:17.899
We find that David is forgiven, but notice this evening that Rachel, she tried to hide,

00:29:17.899 --> 00:29:26.179
but God knew, she knew, Achan he tried to hide, Joshua didn't know, he's beside himself,

00:29:26.179 --> 00:29:28.779
he's laying on the ground crying to God.

00:29:28.779 --> 00:29:35.859
God says, get up, Israel hath sinned, and unless it's dealt with, I'm not going to be

00:29:35.859 --> 00:29:36.859
with you.

00:29:36.859 --> 00:29:48.459
And here's how we're going to find the offender, tribe, family, household, man by man.

00:29:48.459 --> 00:29:55.619
We find that David thought he had everything covered, but God knew.

00:29:55.619 --> 00:30:00.059
Notice what the word of God says in Proverbs 28, we'll finish here.

00:30:00.059 --> 00:30:10.799
say, I believe there's such a temptation, even on the part of God's people, to try

00:30:10.799 --> 00:30:20.179
to cover our sin.

00:30:20.179 --> 00:30:26.579
In church services, in revival meetings, in pastor's conferences that I attend, a preacher

00:30:26.979 --> 00:30:30.859
on sin, and people don't want to go forward because they might think they're the only

00:30:30.859 --> 00:30:37.859
ones in the group that have sin. Right? There's a temptation for us to cover our sin. There

00:30:41.539 --> 00:30:48.539
just is. But the Bible tells us in Proverbs 28 and verse number 13, he that covereth his

00:30:49.419 --> 00:30:56.419
sins shall not prosper. That's the Bible. He that covereth his sins shall not prosper.

00:31:02.779 --> 00:31:09.779
But whosoever, or whoso, excuse me, confesseth and forsaketh them, his sins, shall have mercy.

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:17.939
Aren't you thankful this evening that our God is gracious and merciful? So often we

00:31:17.939 --> 00:31:24.259
read about the nature of our God where the Bible says that He's ready to pardon. He's

00:31:24.259 --> 00:31:31.259
ready to forgive. With thee, the psalmist says, there is forgiveness. Pillars of biblical

00:31:32.739 --> 00:31:39.739
Christianity are forgiveness and restoration. And I'm so thankful for that. We find that

00:31:41.419 --> 00:31:46.019
a verse that we often quote from 1 John 1 and verse number 9, if we confess our sins,

00:31:46.019 --> 00:31:53.019
He is faithful and just to forgive us and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. So

00:31:53.579 --> 00:31:58.019
the reality this evening, and I've said this before, but as we look at it from Genesis

00:31:58.019 --> 00:32:05.019
31 and the life of Rachel in particular, and look at this truth of what's in your tent,

00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:12.500
you know and God knows. We can't hide our sin from God. God knows. And if hiding our

00:32:16.179 --> 00:32:21.899
sin, covering our sin means that we shall not prosper, but confessing it and forsaking

00:32:21.899 --> 00:32:27.819
it means we receive mercy, the real question that I have is why would we even try to cover

00:32:27.819 --> 00:32:34.220
our sin? Right? I mean, if He's promised to forgive us, if He says that He's gracious

00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:41.220
and He's merciful, why wouldn't we just want to confess it and forsake it to have that

00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:48.940
sweet communion with Him? The song, nothing between my soul and my Savior. We can sing

00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:59.500
that song, but as we really truly allow the words of that song to seek deep into our hearts,

00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:08.860
we say, is there something between my soul and my Savior? I don't want to become cleaner,

00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:16.860
I want to be clean. Rachel knew what was in her tent. We can look at Jacob's ignorance,

00:33:16.979 --> 00:33:23.979
we can look at Laban's persistence of searching and searching and searching, but we know Rachel's

00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:29.940
behavior, and if we're not careful this evening, there are times in our lives where we can

00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:36.059
mimic the behavior of Rachel, and we can go through great lengths and take great strides

00:33:36.059 --> 00:33:43.059
to try to cover our sin. But instead of covering our sin, we need to just confess and forsake

00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:54.220
and have the forgiveness that God promises. What's in your tent? I don't know what's in

00:33:54.940 --> 00:34:01.940
your tent. You do, and God does. Right? And this evening, as we prepare for the Lord's

00:34:06.339 --> 00:34:13.339
Supper, we often take a moment of time to search ourselves. I believe it's a great segue

00:34:17.419 --> 00:34:23.859
this evening as we close this message from the book of Genesis and then enter into the

00:34:23.859 --> 00:34:30.859
observance of the Lord's Supper, that in 1 Corinthians 11, I'll read more of it in just

00:34:31.859 --> 00:34:34.859
a few moments, but in verse 28 he says,

00:34:34.859 --> 00:34:41.859
But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup.

00:34:41.899 --> 00:34:45.540
For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself,

00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:50.179
not discerning the Lord's body. For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many

00:34:50.179 --> 00:34:57.179
sleep. The table of examination. So as we conclude the message this evening and we segue

00:34:58.179 --> 00:35:04.059
into the observance of the Lord's Supper, let's take a few moments this evening to just

00:35:04.059 --> 00:35:11.059
have some self-examination, that we could be honest with God as the psalmist was and

00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:19.220
says, search me, O Lord. Somewhere that I've even deceived myself, would you show me if

00:35:20.139 --> 00:35:26.380
there's any wicked way in me? Because I want to be clean. I want there to be nothing between

00:35:26.419 --> 00:35:33.139
my soul and my Savior. So let's take a few moments this evening before we take and distribute

00:35:33.139 --> 00:35:36.579
the Lord's Supper to have this time of examination.
