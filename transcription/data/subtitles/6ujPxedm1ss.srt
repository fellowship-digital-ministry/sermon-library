1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,279
and the Old Testament.

2
00:00:02,279 --> 00:00:05,119
And this is just gonna be a launching point this evening.

3
00:00:05,119 --> 00:00:07,960
And eventually, as we begin here,

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:11,680
we will also end here in Jonah chapter number four,

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,199
verses one and two.

6
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:17,120
And we will continue with our Ask the Pastor series.

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,659
And I'll be honest, if you look in the bulletin,

8
00:00:19,659 --> 00:00:21,360
there's a different series,

9
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,639
or title for a message this evening.

10
00:00:23,639 --> 00:00:25,520
And that's because I was gonna preach

11
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,879
a different Ask the Pastor, but the folks aren't here.

12
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:33,000
And I am not gonna always be able to adjust that,

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,119
but it happens that I'm able to adjust it for this evening

14
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:38,119
and wanna try to make sure.

15
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:40,200
I didn't wanna be like, well, it's too bad you weren't here,

16
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,139
get the recording, sort of a situation.

17
00:00:43,139 --> 00:00:45,840
So we'll try to adjust that as we can.

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,520
So if you've given a question

19
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,319
and you know you're gonna be on vacation,

20
00:00:49,319 --> 00:00:50,500
would you let me know?

21
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,299
And that might help a little bit.

22
00:00:52,299 --> 00:00:55,439
But Jonah chapter four, look at verses one and two.

23
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:57,520
If you're familiar with the book of Jonah, of course,

24
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,080
we know that Jonah's already been swallowed

25
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,520
by the great fish and he's already been spewed out.

26
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,519
He's already gone to Nineveh and he's preached.

27
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:06,959
And we come to the fourth chapter.

28
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:10,080
The people of Nineveh have responded in repentance.

29
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,639
And it says this in verse number one,

30
00:01:11,639 --> 00:01:14,760
but it displeased Jonah exceedingly.

31
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,080
And he was very angry.

32
00:01:17,199 --> 00:01:18,919
Notice it says, he prayed unto the Lord and said,

33
00:01:18,919 --> 00:01:21,360
"'I pray thee, O Lord, was not this my saying

34
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,279
"'when I was yet in my country?

35
00:01:23,279 --> 00:01:26,940
"'Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish, why?

36
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:31,379
"'For I knew that thou art a gracious God,

37
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:36,199
"'and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness,

38
00:01:36,199 --> 00:01:39,660
"'and repentest thee of the evil.'"

39
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,860
I wanna preach a message tonight

40
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,260
that I've titled from verse number two,

41
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:47,580
I knew that thou art a gracious God.

42
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,620
The question that was submitted says this,

43
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:52,339
many skeptics of Christianity say they like the God

44
00:01:52,339 --> 00:01:53,940
of the New Testament,

45
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:56,339
but not the God of the Old Testament.

46
00:01:56,339 --> 00:01:58,980
How do we, as the people of God,

47
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:02,379
explain the annihilation of whole people groups

48
00:02:02,379 --> 00:02:07,379
as being in line with a truly loving and merciful God?

49
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:09,979
And I think it's a great question,

50
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:12,660
one in which you may have been exposed to,

51
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:16,339
where someone will question you with regard to

52
00:02:16,339 --> 00:02:19,940
noticing or at least seeming to notice a contradiction

53
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,059
between the Old and New Testament.

54
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:24,339
And I believe it's a wonderful question.

55
00:02:24,339 --> 00:02:26,220
I hope that you'd bear with me this evening

56
00:02:27,059 --> 00:02:27,899
as a preacher friend of mine says,

57
00:02:27,899 --> 00:02:29,580
I didn't come to church to get out of church,

58
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,580
I came in to get something from church.

59
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,460
And I will admit to you at the very beginning,

60
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:36,339
it's gonna be a little bit longer of a message this evening

61
00:02:36,339 --> 00:02:39,059
and at least that's what my notes say.

62
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:40,940
And we hope that we'll get through it

63
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,100
and hope that it makes sense.

64
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,820
But in order to answer the question,

65
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,460
I believe it's imperative for us to understand

66
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:49,500
and acknowledge all of God's attributes.

67
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,419
And we will not study all of his attributes this evening,

68
00:02:53,419 --> 00:02:56,179
but with dealing with the question specifically,

69
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,500
with regard to God being loving and merciful

70
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,820
and seeing this seeming discrepancy,

71
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:07,380
we also notice that yes, God is loving and God is merciful

72
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,339
and we ought to rejoice in that.

73
00:03:09,339 --> 00:03:10,539
But at the very same time,

74
00:03:10,539 --> 00:03:14,699
we understand that God is righteous and he is just.

75
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:17,020
And as we understand the attributes of God

76
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,779
and we understand the character of God

77
00:03:18,779 --> 00:03:20,940
as it's been revealed to us in the word of God,

78
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,580
we would understand that God's attributes

79
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,820
are in perfect harmony.

80
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,940
We as people, as human beings,

81
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:31,139
our attributes are not always in perfect harmony.

82
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:34,580
In fact, there are times in which we perhaps had a bad day

83
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:37,139
and we're more on the side of judgment

84
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:39,300
than we are on the side of grace or mercy.

85
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,919
And we find that we can fluctuate as human beings,

86
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:45,979
but God is perfect in his attributes

87
00:03:45,979 --> 00:03:48,020
and they are harmonious.

88
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,940
We find this, it's interesting to me

89
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:50,940
and you don't need to turn there,

90
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:54,020
but in Genesis chapter number 18 and verse number 25,

91
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,300
as Abraham is having a conversation with the Lord

92
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:59,899
regarding the pending destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah,

93
00:03:59,899 --> 00:04:02,699
we find that in that verse of scripture,

94
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:06,820
Abraham reveals to us and we are given the truth

95
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:10,220
of two very important aspects of our God.

96
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:14,339
Number one is this, God is the judge of all the earth.

97
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:19,779
Number two, he always does what is right.

98
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:21,579
And so we find that Abraham

99
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:24,100
is having this conversation with the Lord

100
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,059
and he's finding out about the impending judgment

101
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:28,540
of Sodom and Gomorrah.

102
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,200
And Abraham, as he's having this conversation,

103
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,980
he reveals two important truths.

104
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,540
Number one, God is the judge of all the earth.

105
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:39,299
And number two, he always does what is right.

106
00:04:39,299 --> 00:04:42,660
So I believe as we begin starting this message this evening

107
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,640
that many of those that would come to a perspective

108
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,519
such as what has been asked this evening,

109
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:50,640
I believe that for many of them,

110
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,279
obviously I cannot say for all of them,

111
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:55,720
I would never seek to do so because of the individual nature

112
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,600
of those that would have this perspective,

113
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,480
but for many of them, I believe that perhaps

114
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:06,480
they have approached the Bible incorrectly and incompletely.

115
00:05:06,559 --> 00:05:09,200
And why I say that is for this reason,

116
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,720
I believe that their approach,

117
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,959
many times individual skeptics

118
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:15,399
that would approach the Bible,

119
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:18,679
they have an approach of a critical nature.

120
00:05:18,679 --> 00:05:21,679
They approach the Bible by seeking to find fault

121
00:05:21,679 --> 00:05:26,600
and criticize, and therefore they reach a faulty conclusion.

122
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,559
Why is that?

123
00:05:27,559 --> 00:05:28,880
Well, because they just like to look

124
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,320
at certain portions of scripture.

125
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,959
They look to a certain portion that's going to be in line

126
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:38,040
with what they want, what fits their presupposition,

127
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,200
and therefore they're going to seek a passage

128
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,679
that they can run to and support what they already think.

129
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,480
Now, as the people of God,

130
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,859
we understand that our approach

131
00:05:48,859 --> 00:05:50,899
to God's word is much different.

132
00:05:50,899 --> 00:05:54,079
Our approach to God's word, my approach to God's word,

133
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:58,000
is God is right and I'm in error, right?

134
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,079
And so as I come to the word of God,

135
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:03,399
it's God's word that is going to correct

136
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:05,839
and instruct my thinking.

137
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:09,000
And if I approach the word of God at that level,

138
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,640
and I approach the word of God with understanding

139
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,640
that he is the judge of all the earth,

140
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,480
that he always does that which is right,

141
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:20,519
that he is perfect in harmony with regard to his attributes,

142
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:22,600
then my perspective of the word of God

143
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,519
is going to be quite different.

144
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:26,920
Let me also say this by way of introduction.

145
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,980
The Bible tells us in the book of 1 Corinthians

146
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,679
that the natural man receiveth not

147
00:06:30,679 --> 00:06:32,459
the things of the spirit of God.

148
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:33,299
Why?

149
00:06:33,299 --> 00:06:35,839
Because they are foolishness unto him.

150
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:39,359
They must be spiritually discerned.

151
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,679
And so as we go to the word of God

152
00:06:40,679 --> 00:06:43,000
and we begin to seek the face of God

153
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
and looking at God's word,

154
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
we want to give an honest approach to the word of God.

155
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,839
And indeed, there are times in which,

156
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:50,000
as the skeptics would say,

157
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,760
as the question gives us this evening,

158
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,220
that there are people groups that are destroyed.

159
00:06:56,299 --> 00:06:58,200
And there are some that would look at that and say,

160
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,200
how could that be in line with a God

161
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,279
who's loving and merciful?

162
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:08,440
I hope this evening that after reviewing several examples

163
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,720
that we could conclude,

164
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:14,480
even as Jonah concluded there in Jonah 4,

165
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:18,519
that we know that God is gracious.

166
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:19,720
He's gracious.

167
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,679
There's a number of other things

168
00:07:20,679 --> 00:07:22,239
that are mentioned there in Jonah 4

169
00:07:22,239 --> 00:07:23,480
and verse number two that we'll look at

170
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,839
as we end this evening.

171
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:27,880
Let me start here with the Egyptians, if we could.

172
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,200
I'm gonna give a number of examples.

173
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,140
These examples were not given on the question that was asked

174
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,920
but I will give some examples

175
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,480
of perhaps what is being referred to

176
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,559
and hope that that helps us to answer the question.

177
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:42,640
Turn to Exodus chapter number four, if you will.

178
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,959
In Exodus chapter number four,

179
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:47,000
we find that in verses 22 and 23,

180
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,079
Moses has been given instruction.

181
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:53,519
He's objected and God has given him the signs, the miracles.

182
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:57,480
And we find that in Exodus chapter four in verse number 22,

183
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,480
notice what God says to Moses.

184
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,000
He says, and thou shalt say unto Pharaoh,

185
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,279
thus saith the Lord, Israel is my son, even my firstborn.

186
00:08:06,359 --> 00:08:10,040
And I say unto thee, let my son go, that he may serve me.

187
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,760
And if thou refuse to let him go,

188
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:17,760
behold, I will slay thy son, even thy firstborn.

189
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:22,160
I have every belief as we look at this instruction

190
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,739
that God gives to Moses in Exodus four in verses 22 and 23.

191
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:27,720
I have every reason to believe

192
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,679
that Moses faithfully communicated to Pharaoh

193
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:35,640
what was at stake, that God said to Moses,

194
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,479
deliver this message to Pharaoh.

195
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:39,119
If he doesn't let my people go,

196
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:43,200
that I will slay thy son, even thy firstborn.

197
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,640
Over the next several chapters,

198
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,239
we find the interaction between Moses and Pharaoh.

199
00:08:48,239 --> 00:08:49,640
And of course, Aaron is there.

200
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,840
And we find that as Moses is interacting with Pharaoh,

201
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,760
that in chapter seven through 10,

202
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,400
plagues one through nine are recorded for us.

203
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,559
As you read about those plagues,

204
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:01,380
you read about the devastation,

205
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,119
you read about the destruction of Egypt,

206
00:09:04,119 --> 00:09:07,799
you read about how that in Exodus 8 and verse 19,

207
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:11,760
how that the people, the counselors of Pharaoh,

208
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,000
they say they recognize that this is the finger of God.

209
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,520
We find it in the 10th chapter

210
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,460
that the people, the counselors of Pharaoh,

211
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,960
they say to Pharaoh,

212
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:27,359
do you not know that our land has been destroyed?

213
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:31,780
And we find that God was revealing Himself

214
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,059
to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians.

215
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:35,739
I believe that in so doing,

216
00:09:35,739 --> 00:09:38,419
that God was demonstrating a measure of grace,

217
00:09:38,419 --> 00:09:40,059
a measure of mercy.

218
00:09:40,059 --> 00:09:43,099
Because when Moses first comes to Pharaoh and says,

219
00:09:43,099 --> 00:09:45,260
God said, let my people go.

220
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,059
Pharaoh says, who's God?

221
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,719
And so God begins to reveal Himself

222
00:09:50,719 --> 00:09:52,340
and to reveal His power.

223
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:56,760
And everything that God said He would do, He did.

224
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:01,760
In the ninth chapter, which would reveal His power,

225
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,160
record for us the seventh plague. I want you to notice that in verse number 19

226
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,960
the Bible says this, Moses of course has received the instruction from God and I

227
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:15,760
believe this is a great picture of God's mercy, of God's love and grace. Notice

228
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,720
what he says before the arrival of the seventh plague, send therefore now and

229
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,880
gather thy cattle and all that thou hast in the field. For upon every man and

230
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:29,440
beast which shall be found in the field and shall not be brought home, the hail

231
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,040
shall come down upon them and they shall die. That's gracious and merciful of God

232
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:38,920
to let them know of what was going to happen. And we find that even after six

233
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:43,440
plagues had already taken place and all that God had demonstrated that

234
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:49,080
particular point, that the response of the people was still mixed. Even though

235
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,960
God gave him warning, the Bible tells us in verse number 20 that he that feared

236
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:56,320
the word of the Lord among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his

237
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:02,960
cattle flee into the houses. They believed. They responded to the merciful

238
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:07,880
truth that God had given the warning. We find that in verse 21 it says, and he

239
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:11,480
that regarded not the word of the Lord left his servants and his cattle in the

240
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:16,880
field. What happened to them? They died. They died. The plague came just as God

241
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,440
said. We find that the scriptures, it's interesting to me and we don't have time

242
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,560
to develop each of these truths that we'll look at this evening, but I do want

243
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,320
you to understand that the scriptures record for us interaction between Pharaoh

244
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,440
and Moses during several of the plagues. And in those interactions you will find

245
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,680
that many times Pharaoh makes the request, would you make the plague stop?

246
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:48,760
And God graciously responds to that request and the plague is stayed. But you

247
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,800
know it's interesting to me that with regard to the death of the firstborn,

248
00:11:51,800 --> 00:12:00,040
there's no request. There's no reference that we find that as God would reveal to,

249
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:05,680
of course, at the end of chapter 10 we find that Pharaoh told Moses to flee, get

250
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,800
out of his sight, that in the day that I see your face you're gonna die. And we

251
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,480
find that Pharaoh had expelled Moses from his presence, but all the way back

252
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:19,920
as we mentioned in chapter 4 that God had set the consequence. If you don't

253
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:27,240
let my people go, the firstborn is gonna die. And there was no request, there was

254
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:32,040
no interaction between Pharaoh saying, okay Moses how do we avoid that? Just let

255
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:38,360
the people go. Let me say this also, it was the Egyptians that had given the

256
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:42,680
instruction, in fact Pharaoh himself, to kill all of the male children of the

257
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:48,880
children of Israel. They were very known for human sacrifice themselves and so we

258
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,320
find that this is a situation in which I believe as you look at the text of

259
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:58,120
Scripture and you honestly evaluate these chapters that provide us the

260
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:02,480
record of the the plagues and the consequence of the death of the

261
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,920
firstborn, that God indeed was gracious and merciful. He didn't just come in and

262
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:13,320
wipe them out in just a moment, he came in and revealed himself to them. Who is

263
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:19,320
God? Okay, over the next several plagues you're gonna see who God is. And they

264
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:24,280
still rejected. I believe this evening that Pharaoh had been given light, yet he

265
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:29,480
failed to respond to the light that was given. And in a lack of response or maybe

266
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:34,440
in responding to that light by rejecting the light, we find that he had to deal

267
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:39,200
with the consequences and the nation of Egypt dealt with the consequences. I

268
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:44,320
think about not only the Egyptians but I think about the Amorites. We think about

269
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,840
the Amorites, we find that God provides details for us in the Abrahamic

270
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:53,360
Covenant as it's recorded in Genesis chapter 15 and as God would give the

271
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,240
Abrahamic Covenant in Genesis chapter 15, not only would he speak about all of the

272
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,840
the details with regard to the place and what have you, but he also speaks of the

273
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:07,080
time of the Abrahamic Covenant, the time of entering into the land that was

274
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:11,960
promised. And we find that in Genesis 15 and verse number 16, God says this,

275
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:15,880
but in the fourth generation they shall come hither again. Notice what he says,

276
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:21,960
for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full. We read that statement that the

277
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:26,080
iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full. In other words, I believe that God here

278
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:31,040
is demonstrating once again his grace and his mercy. Why? Because he was going

279
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:36,520
to give them time to repent. He was going to give them opportunity to repent

280
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:40,720
before his judgment would come. It's interesting as you go to the book of

281
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,160
Joshua, turn to the book of Joshua, if you will, in chapter number 5, because we

282
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,800
begin to see some things about the Amorites here in Joshua chapter number

283
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:52,240
5, and we find that the Amorites in chapter number 5 of the book of Joshua

284
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,720
and also in chapter number 10, there's a different response of the Amorites,

285
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,720
the king of the Amorites, the kings, excuse me, of the Amorites, versus the

286
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:06,119
response that we see of Rahab in Joshua chapter number 2. Here in Joshua chapter

287
00:15:06,119 --> 00:15:08,720
number 5 and verse number 1, notice what the Bible says,

288
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,360
and it came to pass when all the kings of the Amorites, which were on the side

289
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,680
of Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, which were by the sea,

290
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:20,240
heard that the Lord had dried up the waters of Jordan from before the

291
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,800
children of Israel until we were passed over, that their heart melted, neither was

292
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,880
their spirit in them anymore because of the children of Israel. That's very

293
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:35,800
similar to what we read of Rahab as the spies went, as we read in Joshua

294
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:40,600
chapter number 2, when the spies go into Jericho, and we read about the

295
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:45,600
understanding of Rahab and the people of Jericho, and the Bible tells us in

296
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,720
Joshua chapter 2 and verse number 9 that Rahab says to these men, I know that the

297
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,360
Lord hath given you the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that

298
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,839
all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you. For we have heard how the

299
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:04,279
Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt, and

300
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:07,160
what ye did under the two kings of the Amorites that were on the other side,

301
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:11,160
Jordan, Sihon, and Og, whom ye utterly destroyed. By the way, with Sihon in

302
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:15,040
particular, it was asked that they could pass through freely. They did not want to

303
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:19,000
have interaction, but there was a rejection of that. You can go back and

304
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,040
read of that in the book of Numbers. Notice it says in verse number, well we

305
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:28,440
won't continue reading, but you remember that Rahab believed that God was going

306
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:32,559
to give the people of Israel the land, and she feared, and there was an

307
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:36,200
agreement that was made. There was a scarlet thread that was hung out, and God

308
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:44,240
through these spies told Rahab that there's safety in the house. Jericho

309
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,680
was still destroyed, but Rahab and whoever she had in the house, there was

310
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:53,400
mercy, there was grace. Why? Because of a response. But notice I mentioned in

311
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:57,360
Joshua 5 that these kings of the Amorites, it's also mentioned about the

312
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,640
Canaanites here, that they hear about this, but I want you to see what their

313
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:04,000
response is, and really you got to flip over to chapter number 10, and I want you

314
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,080
to really see the response of the kings of the Amorites as it's recorded for us

315
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:12,800
in Joshua chapter number 10. In fact, we find that it's in Joshua chapter number

316
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:17,080
9, the account of the Gibeonites, and if you want to have an add-on to the

317
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:21,960
message from this morning of the way in which the false teachers, the depth of

318
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:26,200
depravity, excuse me, deception, read about the Gibeonites in Joshua chapter

319
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:31,240
number 9. We find that we, after the situation with southern Canaan being

320
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:35,360
destroyed in Joshua 9 and all the victory, that in Joshua chapter number

321
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:40,200
10, these five kings of the Amorites, as it's mentioned in verse number 5, the

322
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,839
king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmut, the king of Lachish, the

323
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:48,720
king of Eglon, they gathered themselves together and went up, they and all their

324
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,720
hosts, and encamped before Gibeon and made war against it, and they would soon

325
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:58,920
be defeated. So we find that the Amorites, as it's mentioned because of the

326
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:03,240
reference in Genesis chapter 15, and then here in the book of Joshua, and we read

327
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:08,119
about the fact that they were destroyed, but you think about the mercy

328
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:12,320
and the grace of God even still being understood within the context of their

329
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:19,960
destruction. For Rahab responded in belief, but these kings of the Amorites,

330
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:25,360
they formed a coalition to go into battle. We find that they were ultimately

331
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:30,160
defeated. One that many like to look at is the Amalekites, and turn over the book

332
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,799
of 1st Samuel, if you will, and I want you to look here. Of course, this

333
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:37,359
instruction is given in 1st Samuel chapter 15 with regard to the

334
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:42,299
Amalekites, and maybe this is one in which someone had in mind. As you look at

335
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:47,059
the instruction that Samuel would give to Saul, we find that this instruction is

336
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:51,340
given with regard to the Amalekites, and it says in verse number one of 1st

337
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:55,299
Samuel 15, Samuel also said unto Saul, the Lord sent me to anoint thee to be

338
00:18:55,299 --> 00:18:59,460
king over his people, over Israel. Now therefore hearken thou unto the

339
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:04,220
voice of the words of the Lord. Thus saith the Lord of hosts. Notice what it says,

340
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:09,260
I remember that which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid wait for him in the

341
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:14,940
way when he came up from Egypt. Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all

342
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:18,540
that they have, and spare them not, but slay both man and woman, infant and

343
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:22,059
suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass. There are people that look at verse

344
00:19:22,059 --> 00:19:27,739
number three completely out of the context of verse number two, or of Exodus

345
00:19:27,739 --> 00:19:32,580
and Deuteronomy, and say, man, God gave the instruction to just annihilate all

346
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:37,739
of them. Notice what he says in verse number two, I remember that which Amalek

347
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:41,979
did to Israel. Well what is it that Amalek did to Israel? Turn back to Exodus

348
00:19:41,979 --> 00:19:50,979
chapter number 17. In Exodus chapter number 17, of course we understand that

349
00:19:50,979 --> 00:19:54,299
at this particular point they've already left Egypt, they've already crossed the

350
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:58,739
Red Sea, they've already complained about water and about food and about water

351
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:03,739
again, and God has miraculously provided for them.

352
00:20:03,739 --> 00:20:10,059
But then we find that as we come to the latter part of Exodus chapter number 17 in verse number 8 the Bible begins to reveal

353
00:20:10,059 --> 00:20:14,539
to us this about Amalek and it says then came Amalek and fought with Israel in Rephidim and

354
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:18,259
Moses said unto Joshua choose us out men and go out fight with Amalek

355
00:20:18,579 --> 00:20:22,819
Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in mine hand and this is the time in which

356
00:20:23,259 --> 00:20:25,579
remember they had to stay up the hands of

357
00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:31,659
Moses and as Moses hands were stayed up the children of Israel had victory as they were let down they had defeat

358
00:20:31,779 --> 00:20:35,179
We find that in verse number 16 of Exodus 17 the Bible says

359
00:20:35,459 --> 00:20:40,499
Because the Lord hath sworn that the Lord will have war with Amalek from generation to generation

360
00:20:41,899 --> 00:20:46,099
Now what is it that the Amalekites did? What is it that the king of Amalek did?

361
00:20:46,219 --> 00:20:51,059
Well, God gives us more insight to that in the book of Deuteronomy in chapter number 25

362
00:20:51,739 --> 00:20:56,959
in Deuteronomy chapter number 25 God gives us some insight as to the tactics of the

363
00:20:57,439 --> 00:21:00,499
Amalekites the behavior of the Amalekites and what they did and

364
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:08,239
God is using Moses here in Deuteronomy to prepare the nation of Israel for entrance into the land and he's going to remind them of

365
00:21:08,239 --> 00:21:12,679
This and what it is that they're to do notice. It says in verse 17 of Deuteronomy 25

366
00:21:13,199 --> 00:21:15,719
Remember what Amalek did unto thee by the way?

367
00:21:16,639 --> 00:21:21,199
When you were come forth out of Egypt, what is it that he did notice verse 18?

368
00:21:21,199 --> 00:21:29,079
How he met thee by the way and smote the hindmost of thee even all that were feeble behind thee when thou was

369
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:32,359
faint and weary and he feared not God

370
00:21:33,399 --> 00:21:35,399
That's what he did

371
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:42,999
So therefore verse 19 it shall be when the Lord thy God hath given thee rest from all thine enemies round about in the land

372
00:21:42,999 --> 00:21:50,159
Which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it that thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven

373
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,159
Thou shalt not forget it

374
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:58,599
So when read first Samuel 15 apart from Exodus 17 apart from Deuteronomy 25

375
00:21:58,719 --> 00:22:01,279
You can certainly come to a different conclusion

376
00:22:01,999 --> 00:22:09,399
You can reach a conclusion that says how could God do that? Well God says I remember what they did and here's what the

377
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:15,679
Consequences here's what's going to happen and we read it in Exodus chapter 17. We read it in Deuteronomy 25

378
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,959
what the details are of

379
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:21,479
The behavior of Amalek and the Amalekites

380
00:22:21,959 --> 00:22:28,119
Think about the people of Nineveh. I'm going to use this from a positive perspective toward the book of Jonah if you will

381
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:30,639
I'm trying to use this as a contrast

382
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:33,359
between the the two

383
00:22:34,039 --> 00:22:37,119
Aspects in which we're looking at here in the city of Nineveh

384
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:43,679
I believe that as Jonah preaches this message after God got a hold of them in Jonah 3 and verse number 4

385
00:22:43,959 --> 00:22:49,039
The Bible tells us that he began to enter into the city a day's journey and he cried and said yet 40 days in

386
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,039
Nineveh shall be overthrown. I

387
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:53,279
Believe with all my heart

388
00:22:53,719 --> 00:22:55,399
that Nineveh

389
00:22:55,399 --> 00:23:02,279
Including the hundred and twenty thousand children in Nineveh and we get that number from Jonah 4 in verse number 11

390
00:23:03,199 --> 00:23:07,239
After God deals with Jonah and the Gourd and all of that situation

391
00:23:07,239 --> 00:23:12,279
He says in verse 11 of chapter 4 and should not I spare Nineveh that great city where there are more than six

392
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:17,719
64,000 persons that cannot discern between the right hand and their left hand and also much cattle

393
00:23:17,719 --> 00:23:23,839
I believe that in 40 days based on the preaching of Jonah in verse number 4 of Jonah 3

394
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:29,239
that God would have destroyed Nineveh including those hundred and twenty thousand children and

395
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:35,999
He would have destroyed them, but we find that the response of the people of Nineveh

396
00:23:36,879 --> 00:23:39,919
Stayed the judgment of God and spared the people

397
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:46,439
Notice in verse number 5 of Jonah chapter number 3 the Bible says so the people of Nineveh believed God

398
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:51,879
They believed God they proclaimed a fast and put on sackcloth from the greatest of them

399
00:23:51,879 --> 00:23:55,479
Even to the least of them verse 10. You can read the rest of it later

400
00:23:55,479 --> 00:23:56,279
but in verse number 10

401
00:23:56,279 --> 00:23:59,399
It says that God saw their works that they turned from their evil way and God

402
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:03,559
Repented of the evil that he had said that he would do unto them and he did it not. I

403
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:06,519
believe again that God would have

404
00:24:07,439 --> 00:24:11,959
Destroyed the city of Nineveh all of the inhabitants including those hundred and twenty thousand children

405
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:14,679
the question that we could ask about the

406
00:24:15,439 --> 00:24:20,000
Situation there with Egypt the situation here with Nineveh and you look at two very different

407
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:24,759
situations where God is revealing himself to Pharaoh and to the people of

408
00:24:25,399 --> 00:24:27,399
Egypt and the the

409
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,679
Magicians they are

410
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:31,679
recognizing as they see these

411
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,199
These plagues and these miracles they are recognizing. This is the finger of God

412
00:24:37,399 --> 00:24:41,359
But yet there's not a response like we read of in Nineveh

413
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:45,639
There continues to be a refusal to let the people of God go

414
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:48,119
they see the

415
00:24:48,199 --> 00:24:54,000
Time in which God allowed for these plagues and all that he does and he reveals his his grace

416
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,559
I believe in his mercy to the Egyptians yet. They continue to resist

417
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:01,119
yet for the people of Nineveh

418
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:04,880
They respond with repentance and thus they are spared

419
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:12,559
So as we look at the text of Scripture we look at these examples the the the Egyptians the Amorites the

420
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,279
Amalekites the people of Nineveh

421
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:20,519
We see the people of Nineveh have a different outcome than the other three that we've looked at but we find that God. Yes

422
00:25:21,199 --> 00:25:25,440
He is just and he is righteous and he is the judge of all the earth

423
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:33,799
This evening we could ask the question would God have been justified in destroying the the people of Egypt

424
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:37,799
Would God have been justified in destroying the the people of Nineveh? Yes

425
00:25:39,639 --> 00:25:46,959
One was destroyed and one was spared what was different not God the response of the people

426
00:25:47,959 --> 00:25:51,319
And we find this evening that our God is no

427
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:56,119
Respecter of persons and we find that as we look at these examples

428
00:25:56,119 --> 00:26:02,919
We again mention how that he says that the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full you read about the Amalekites and it's

429
00:26:03,239 --> 00:26:09,839
Specifically a result of their own behavior and the judgment of God and we find that here

430
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:12,319
God's judgment is seen

431
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:12,679
yes

432
00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:14,359
but if you look at it in its

433
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:19,059
Entirety and look at the entirety of the passages and all that goes into it

434
00:26:19,059 --> 00:26:26,160
You find that it's not void of God being merciful. It's not void of God giving space for repentance

435
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:28,919
for we see that in Nineveh and

436
00:26:29,479 --> 00:26:35,039
Let me say this as we would consider God's judgment and perhaps those that would like to

437
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:41,279
Reach this conclusion and have this perspective of that which was asked this evening

438
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,440
Oftentimes they would look at the people groups as being different

439
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:50,720
The the people groups void of Israel right other than Israel

440
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,720
Maybe I should say it that way and this evening for just a few minutes

441
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,880
I want us to consider God's judgment upon his own people and

442
00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:06,039
As we consider God's judgment upon his own people. I believe that it demonstrates God's justice in a very clear way

443
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,399
Because God is no respecter of persons

444
00:27:09,399 --> 00:27:15,519
and so when God judges these people groups that we speak of and people say look at what God did to

445
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,319
This people group or that people group I say yes, he did

446
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:23,959
But do you want to look at what God did in the nation of Israel who were his own people?

447
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,279
Why because God is just

448
00:27:28,239 --> 00:27:31,440
Right. God is merciful, but God is just

449
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:35,039
think with me turn to look at 2nd Chronicles if you will and

450
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:41,759
2nd Chronicles chapter number 7 and many times when we speak about 2nd Chronicles chapter number 7 a verse

451
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:45,039
Immediately comes to our mind and that's verse number 14

452
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:50,599
If my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways

453
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:55,839
Then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land. What a great verse

454
00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:01,959
But I want you to understand that in 2nd Chronicles chapter number 7 not only does God give that promise

455
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:04,759
We've looked at that as being revival promise

456
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:10,079
But I want you to notice what God says in verses 19 through 22 with regard to his judgment

457
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:12,880
Notice in verse number 19

458
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,160
But if you turn away and forsake my statutes and my commandments

459
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:20,160
Which I have set before you and shall go and serve other gods and worship them

460
00:28:20,479 --> 00:28:24,559
Then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land

461
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:30,959
Which I have given them and this house which I have sanctified for my name will I cast out of my sight and will make?

462
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:35,679
It to be a proverb and a byword among all nations in this house

463
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:42,880
Which is high shall be an astonishment to everyone that passeth by it so that he shall say why hath the Lord done thus?

464
00:28:43,399 --> 00:28:48,260
Unto this land and unto this house and it shall be answered

465
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:53,080
Because they forsook the Lord God of their fathers

466
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:59,580
Which brought them forth out of the land of Egypt and laid hold on other gods and worshiped them and served them

467
00:29:00,059 --> 00:29:02,059
Therefore hath he brought all this evil

468
00:29:02,979 --> 00:29:04,979
upon them

469
00:29:05,299 --> 00:29:08,779
If you want to jot down in your notes, I won't take time to read all the verses

470
00:29:08,779 --> 00:29:11,739
But look at Psalm 106 verses 35 through 43

471
00:29:11,899 --> 00:29:17,820
You'll see how the psalmist records this very same truth with regard to the judgment of God the justice of God

472
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:22,219
I want you to think about it within the context of the Assyrian captivity and

473
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:26,500
second Kings chapter number seven and I know we're in a lot of places this evening and I

474
00:29:27,219 --> 00:29:32,539
Hope that as we look and compare scripture with scripture that we don't want to just take one

475
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,539
isolated

476
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:35,580
incident

477
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:38,339
From here or from the Word of God and come to a conclusion

478
00:29:39,219 --> 00:29:44,659
First Kings chapter number seven. I think I said second Kings, but it's first Kings chapter number seven seventeen, excuse me

479
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:50,820
First Kings chapter number seventeen and I want you to look here at what the Word of God tells us. I

480
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:57,739
Don't know why I'm in first King it did I say second Kings at first I

481
00:30:00,099 --> 00:30:03,299
Said first I said second now, I'm gonna say second again. All right

482
00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:05,639
2 Kings chapter 17, please forgive me.

483
00:30:05,639 --> 00:30:09,079
2 Kings chapter 17, my notes even say 2 Kings 17.

484
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:11,919
But beginning in verse number seven,

485
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:14,479
2 Kings 17 and verse number seven,

486
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:16,319
I will not have time to read all the way down

487
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:19,719
through verse number 23, but this really records for us

488
00:30:19,719 --> 00:30:21,639
the record of the Assyrian captivity

489
00:30:21,639 --> 00:30:24,239
of the nation of Israel, the 10 tribes of the north.

490
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,239
In verse number seven it says,

491
00:30:25,239 --> 00:30:26,939
for so it was that the children of Israel

492
00:30:26,939 --> 00:30:28,999
had sinned against the Lord their God,

493
00:30:28,999 --> 00:30:30,679
which had brought them up out of the land of Egypt

494
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:32,399
from under the hand of Pharaoh, king of Egypt,

495
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,839
and had feared other gods.

496
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:37,719
And notice what it says in verse number 14,

497
00:30:37,719 --> 00:30:39,999
notwithstanding they would not hear,

498
00:30:39,999 --> 00:30:43,279
but hardened their necks like to the neck of their fathers

499
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:45,319
that did not believe in the Lord God.

500
00:30:45,319 --> 00:30:47,279
They rejected his statutes and his covenant

501
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,159
that he made with their fathers and his testimonies,

502
00:30:49,159 --> 00:30:51,519
which he testified against them.

503
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:53,519
And they followed vanity and became vain

504
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:56,239
and went after the heathen that were around about them,

505
00:30:56,239 --> 00:30:57,919
concerning whom the Lord had charged

506
00:30:57,919 --> 00:30:59,919
that they should not do like them.

507
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:02,239
And they left all the commandments of the Lord their God

508
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:04,599
and made them molten images, even two calves,

509
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:06,639
and made a grove and worshiped all the host of heaven

510
00:31:06,639 --> 00:31:08,319
and served Baal.

511
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:09,519
Notice in verse 18 it says,

512
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,639
therefore the Lord was very angry with Israel

513
00:31:11,639 --> 00:31:13,339
and removed them out of his sight.

514
00:31:13,339 --> 00:31:15,499
There was none left but the tribe of Judah only.

515
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:16,599
And verse number 23 says,

516
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:18,999
until the Lord removed Israel out of his sight,

517
00:31:18,999 --> 00:31:21,239
as he had said by all his servants, the prophets,

518
00:31:21,239 --> 00:31:23,679
so was Israel carried away out of their own land

519
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:26,559
to Assyria unto this day.

520
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:28,919
They face judgment.

521
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:33,639
They face the justice of God because of their wickedness,

522
00:31:33,639 --> 00:31:35,839
because of their behavior.

523
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:37,839
Does it mean that God isn't merciful?

524
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:39,199
Oh no, God is merciful.

525
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:41,679
But they rejected.

526
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:44,439
The Bible told us as we looked at these verses here,

527
00:31:44,439 --> 00:31:45,639
it says that they would not hear,

528
00:31:45,639 --> 00:31:47,479
that they hardened their necks,

529
00:31:47,479 --> 00:31:49,319
that they rejected his statutes,

530
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:51,159
that they left all of his commandments

531
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:54,199
and the judgment of God comes.

532
00:31:54,199 --> 00:31:56,079
We read this of the Assyrian captivity.

533
00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:58,199
I want you to think about the Babylonian captivity

534
00:31:58,479 --> 00:32:01,799
of Judah from the book of Jeremiah, if you will.

535
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:02,639
And I want you to notice,

536
00:32:02,639 --> 00:32:04,679
there's some very strong language in the book of Jeremiah

537
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:06,799
that I really hope helps us this evening

538
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:11,239
with regard to this subject that is before us.

539
00:32:11,239 --> 00:32:12,519
Because again, there are people

540
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:14,659
that will bring this charge against God,

541
00:32:14,659 --> 00:32:15,879
that they will bring this charge

542
00:32:15,879 --> 00:32:17,079
as they look at the word of God

543
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:19,079
and they'll say that there's some discrepancy.

544
00:32:19,079 --> 00:32:21,879
But I hope that as we look at God's dealings

545
00:32:21,879 --> 00:32:23,919
with his own people, the nation of Israel,

546
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:25,999
that we would see very clearly

547
00:32:25,999 --> 00:32:28,179
that yes, our God is merciful and gracious,

548
00:32:29,059 --> 00:32:31,539
but our God is righteous and just.

549
00:32:31,539 --> 00:32:34,579
And his attributes are in perfect harmony.

550
00:32:34,579 --> 00:32:38,019
In Jeremiah 11, look at verses 11 through 13.

551
00:32:38,019 --> 00:32:39,619
Notice what the word of God says.

552
00:32:39,619 --> 00:32:42,339
Therefore, thus saith the Lord,

553
00:32:42,339 --> 00:32:45,199
behold, I will bring evil upon them,

554
00:32:45,199 --> 00:32:47,979
which they shall not be able to escape.

555
00:32:47,979 --> 00:32:49,639
And though they shall cry unto me,

556
00:32:49,639 --> 00:32:51,479
I will not hearken unto them.

557
00:32:51,479 --> 00:32:53,099
You say, God said that?

558
00:32:53,099 --> 00:32:54,739
Yes.

559
00:32:54,739 --> 00:32:55,859
God said that.

560
00:32:55,859 --> 00:32:57,659
And he's not talking about the Amalekites

561
00:32:58,419 --> 00:32:59,539
or the Amorites or the Philistines

562
00:32:59,539 --> 00:33:02,219
or the Egyptians or the people of Nineveh.

563
00:33:02,219 --> 00:33:05,019
He's talking about his own people, Judah.

564
00:33:05,019 --> 00:33:06,139
He says in verse number 12,

565
00:33:06,139 --> 00:33:07,579
then shall the cities of Judah

566
00:33:07,579 --> 00:33:09,299
and inhabitants of Jerusalem go

567
00:33:09,299 --> 00:33:11,979
and cry unto the gods unto whom they offer incense,

568
00:33:11,979 --> 00:33:13,599
but they shall not save them at all

569
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:14,899
in the time of their trouble.

570
00:33:14,899 --> 00:33:17,219
For according to their number of thy cities

571
00:33:17,219 --> 00:33:19,019
were thy gods, O Judah.

572
00:33:19,019 --> 00:33:21,139
And according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem,

573
00:33:21,139 --> 00:33:24,139
have you set up altars to that shameful thing,

574
00:33:24,139 --> 00:33:26,499
even altars to burn incense unto Baal.

575
00:33:27,499 --> 00:33:29,139
God says, I'm gonna judge you.

576
00:33:29,139 --> 00:33:30,699
He says in verse number 13,

577
00:33:30,699 --> 00:33:33,259
I will bring evil upon them

578
00:33:33,259 --> 00:33:36,079
that they shall not be able to escape.

579
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:37,739
Notice in Jeremiah chapter 21,

580
00:33:37,739 --> 00:33:40,379
turn over several chapters, if you will.

581
00:33:40,379 --> 00:33:42,739
You can look at verses one through 10 for sake of time.

582
00:33:42,739 --> 00:33:44,819
I just want to look at verses four through six.

583
00:33:44,819 --> 00:33:47,259
Jeremiah is responding to Zedekiah.

584
00:33:49,579 --> 00:33:51,419
The request had been made

585
00:33:51,419 --> 00:33:53,419
that he would inquire of the Lord.

586
00:33:54,419 --> 00:33:57,219
Notice in verse two, this is the request.

587
00:33:57,219 --> 00:33:59,419
I pray thee of the Lord for us,

588
00:33:59,419 --> 00:34:00,859
for Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon,

589
00:34:00,859 --> 00:34:01,939
maketh war against us.

590
00:34:01,939 --> 00:34:03,459
If so be that the Lord will deal with us

591
00:34:03,459 --> 00:34:04,819
according to all his wondrous works

592
00:34:04,819 --> 00:34:07,139
that he may go up from us.

593
00:34:07,139 --> 00:34:09,019
They're wanting God to just intervene

594
00:34:09,019 --> 00:34:12,019
into some miraculous way in his wondrous works.

595
00:34:12,019 --> 00:34:14,279
And they say, Jeremiah, go inquire the Lord for us

596
00:34:14,279 --> 00:34:16,019
and find out if he's gonna show up

597
00:34:16,019 --> 00:34:18,699
and deal mightily for us.

598
00:34:18,699 --> 00:34:19,819
Jeremiah said unto them,

599
00:34:19,819 --> 00:34:21,019
thus shall you say to Zedekiah.

600
00:34:21,019 --> 00:34:22,139
Look at verse four.

601
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:24,099
Thus saith the Lord God of Israel.

602
00:34:24,099 --> 00:34:27,099
Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war

603
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:28,419
that are in your hands,

604
00:34:28,419 --> 00:34:30,459
wherewith you fight against the king of Babylon

605
00:34:30,459 --> 00:34:31,419
and against the Chaldeans,

606
00:34:31,419 --> 00:34:33,059
which besiege you without the walls.

607
00:34:33,059 --> 00:34:36,059
And I will assemble them into the midst of this city.

608
00:34:36,059 --> 00:34:39,459
And I myself will fight against you

609
00:34:39,459 --> 00:34:42,139
with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm,

610
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:45,139
even in anger and in fury and in great wrath.

611
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:47,379
And I will smite the inhabitants of this city,

612
00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:48,379
both man and beast.

613
00:34:48,379 --> 00:34:51,379
They shall die of a great pestilence.

614
00:34:51,379 --> 00:34:53,539
That's not the answer they were hoping for.

615
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,979
But if you read the indictment against Judah

616
00:34:56,979 --> 00:34:58,799
in the beginning of the book of Jeremiah,

617
00:34:58,799 --> 00:35:01,659
you find that there are people that forgot the Lord,

618
00:35:01,659 --> 00:35:05,459
they forsook the Lord and they followed after idols.

619
00:35:05,459 --> 00:35:07,679
And God said, you're not listening to my prophets.

620
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:08,899
There's no repentance.

621
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:11,199
Judgment is coming.

622
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:13,099
Did God not send a prophet?

623
00:35:13,099 --> 00:35:16,299
Jeremiah's prophesying until he can't talk anymore.

624
00:35:17,379 --> 00:35:18,940
And there's just rejection.

625
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,220
So guess what happens?

626
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,220
Judgment.

627
00:35:22,059 --> 00:35:22,899
They're carried away into Babylon.

628
00:35:22,899 --> 00:35:24,859
Turn to the book of 2 Chronicles, if you will.

629
00:35:26,979 --> 00:35:29,220
2 Chronicles chapter number 36.

630
00:35:31,859 --> 00:35:33,379
I want you to notice here,

631
00:35:33,379 --> 00:35:36,239
as it's described to us, the Babylonian captivity.

632
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:40,819
We read there in 2 Kings 17 about the Assyrian captivity.

633
00:35:40,819 --> 00:35:44,500
Here in 2 Chronicles 36 and verse number 15,

634
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,459
the Bible says this,

635
00:35:45,459 --> 00:35:49,019
and the Lord God of their father sent to them

636
00:35:49,019 --> 00:35:51,940
by his messengers, rising up at times and sending

637
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,819
because he had had compassion on his people

638
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:54,659
and on his dwelling place.

639
00:35:54,659 --> 00:35:57,579
God is merciful, he's gracious, but notice what they did.

640
00:35:57,579 --> 00:36:00,599
They mocked the messengers of God and despised his words

641
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:02,299
and misused his prophets

642
00:36:02,299 --> 00:36:06,199
until the wrath of the Lord rose against his people.

643
00:36:06,199 --> 00:36:08,579
Notice the last statement of verse 16,

644
00:36:08,579 --> 00:36:11,539
till there was no remedy.

645
00:36:12,539 --> 00:36:13,379
Wow.

646
00:36:14,779 --> 00:36:18,259
Yeah, God is merciful, but God is just.

647
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:21,419
And it's not just that as you study the Old Testament

648
00:36:21,419 --> 00:36:24,619
that there's some people groups outside of Israel

649
00:36:24,619 --> 00:36:28,019
that face the judgment of God because of their wickedness,

650
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,579
the iniquity of the Amorites.

651
00:36:29,579 --> 00:36:31,819
Listen, they were wicked people that served idols

652
00:36:31,819 --> 00:36:34,739
and God gave them space to repent, but they repented not.

653
00:36:34,739 --> 00:36:39,059
And we find that God, his judgment comes,

654
00:36:39,059 --> 00:36:41,779
but his judgment came for the nation of Israel as well.

655
00:36:41,779 --> 00:36:43,539
And I believe that that ought to help us

656
00:36:43,539 --> 00:36:47,479
to understand the fullness of God's attributes this evening

657
00:36:47,479 --> 00:36:50,059
that he is gracious and merciful,

658
00:36:50,059 --> 00:36:52,359
but he's righteous and just.

659
00:36:52,359 --> 00:36:55,759
The question put a statement with regard

660
00:36:55,759 --> 00:36:57,799
to the God of the Old Testament

661
00:36:57,799 --> 00:36:59,500
versus the God of the New Testament,

662
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,479
that they like the God of the New Testament,

663
00:37:01,479 --> 00:37:03,479
but they do not like the God of the Old Testament.

664
00:37:03,479 --> 00:37:07,519
I said this that I feel like, and again, not all, but many,

665
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:08,839
have an approach to the Bible

666
00:37:08,839 --> 00:37:11,399
that's incorrect and incomplete.

667
00:37:11,399 --> 00:37:12,839
Why do I say that?

668
00:37:12,839 --> 00:37:14,399
Well, turn to the book of Acts.

669
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:17,440
New Testament, by the way.

670
00:37:18,679 --> 00:37:23,440
In Acts 5, you reach a faulty conclusion

671
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,059
when you have a faulty approach.

672
00:37:26,059 --> 00:37:30,679
If you want your approach to be that God is unjust

673
00:37:30,679 --> 00:37:35,679
in the things that he did, you begin to read to that end.

674
00:37:38,479 --> 00:37:39,559
If you want to see a distinction

675
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:40,639
between the Old and New Testament,

676
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:43,199
perhaps you ignore certain passages

677
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:44,799
like we'll look at here in the New Testament

678
00:37:44,799 --> 00:37:47,159
very quickly as we conclude.

679
00:37:47,159 --> 00:37:50,799
We find that there's judgment in the New Testament as well.

680
00:37:50,799 --> 00:37:53,459
In Acts 5, we read of Ananias and Sapphira.

681
00:37:54,799 --> 00:37:57,119
What was the offense of Ananias and Sapphira?

682
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:58,599
They lied.

683
00:37:58,599 --> 00:37:59,440
They lied.

684
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:03,559
Now, sin is sin, right?

685
00:38:03,559 --> 00:38:05,359
We see that in the Word of God.

686
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:07,459
But you know, for many people today,

687
00:38:08,759 --> 00:38:11,159
I would say many people today on a Sunday

688
00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:14,059
in the United States of America that sat in church today,

689
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:16,659
lying is no big deal to them.

690
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:19,519
They don't even think about it.

691
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:21,639
They don't even think twice about lying.

692
00:38:21,639 --> 00:38:24,440
If it means that I'm gonna face a consequence

693
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:28,119
that's not pleasant, I mean, people lie all the time.

694
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:30,319
I'm not saying that it's right, it's wrong.

695
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:34,779
But the offense of Ananias and Sapphira is that they lied.

696
00:38:36,279 --> 00:38:37,760
The Bible records for us here

697
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,679
that Peter actually says to them,

698
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:43,399
listen, when it was your land, you could have kept it.

699
00:38:43,399 --> 00:38:45,000
You didn't have to sell it.

700
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,799
And when you sold your land and you made your money,

701
00:38:47,799 --> 00:38:49,760
you didn't have to give it all.

702
00:38:51,739 --> 00:38:52,580
Right?

703
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,399
That's what happens.

704
00:38:53,399 --> 00:38:54,239
We won't take time to read all of it,

705
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:55,919
but I want you to notice what happens

706
00:38:55,919 --> 00:38:58,219
that Peter says that you've conceived

707
00:38:58,219 --> 00:38:59,059
this thing in thine heart.

708
00:38:59,059 --> 00:39:01,700
You've lied, not unto men at the end of verse number four,

709
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,159
but unto God.

710
00:39:03,159 --> 00:39:04,839
And Ananias, hearing these words,

711
00:39:04,839 --> 00:39:07,559
fell down and gave up the ghost.

712
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:10,200
And great fear came on all them that heard these things.

713
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,399
I guess so.

714
00:39:12,919 --> 00:39:13,880
Right?

715
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,159
I mean, what happens if one of us lied today

716
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:17,239
and you just died?

717
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:23,239
Do you understand what I'm saying?

718
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:24,640
It would impact us.

719
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,279
Sapphira, the Bible tells us, it continues.

720
00:39:28,279 --> 00:39:30,279
In verse number six, the young man arose, wound him up,

721
00:39:30,279 --> 00:39:32,039
and carried him out and buried him.

722
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:33,760
And it was about the space of three hours after

723
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,599
when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in.

724
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:38,559
And she's asked the same line of questions.

725
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:40,799
And she says, yep, yay for so much.

726
00:39:40,799 --> 00:39:41,640
At the end of verse number eight,

727
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,479
then Peter said unto her,

728
00:39:42,479 --> 00:39:44,080
how is it that ye have agreed together

729
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,440
to tempt the Spirit of the Lord?

730
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,519
Behold, the feet of them which have buried thy husband

731
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:49,679
are at the door and shall carry thee out.

732
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:51,959
Then fell she down straightway at his feet

733
00:39:51,959 --> 00:39:53,000
and yielded up the ghost.

734
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,919
And the young men came in and found her dead

735
00:39:55,919 --> 00:39:58,640
and carrying her forth, buried her by her husband.

736
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,000
Look at the result in verse number 11.

737
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,039
And great fear came upon all the church.

738
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:15,479
and upon as many as heard these things. They lied and they died." Is that not judgment?

739
00:40:15,479 --> 00:40:22,879
Absolutely. God is just and He is righteous, and the judge of all the earth shall do what's

740
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:29,679
right. Turn to the book of...right here in the book of Acts, turn to the chapter 12.

741
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:35,679
In Acts chapter 12, we read of Herod. You say, well, Herod deserved it. He killed James

742
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:42,799
and he was going to kill Peter. Well, Herod is here at the end of Acts chapter 12, and

743
00:40:42,799 --> 00:40:47,099
the Bible says that in verse number 20, and Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre

744
00:40:47,099 --> 00:40:51,039
and Sidon, but they came with one accord to him, and having made Blastas the king's chamberlain

745
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:55,759
their friend, desired peace because their country was nourished by the king's country.

746
00:40:55,759 --> 00:41:00,599
And upon a set day Herod arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon his throne and made an oration

747
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:04,639
unto them. The people gave a shout, saying, It is of the voice of God and not of man.

748
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:08,599
And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory, and

749
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:15,919
he was eaten of worms and gave up the ghost. We're talking about judgment, New Testament,

750
00:41:15,919 --> 00:41:21,359
God's judgment, right? And so we begin to look at the Scriptures, and sometimes what

751
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:25,439
happens is we don't see the judgment in the New Testament, maybe in the same light as

752
00:41:25,439 --> 00:41:30,239
we see the Old Testament. One of the reasons I believe that to be the case is because God

753
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:33,779
is dealing with Israel as a nation in the Old Testament. He's dealing with the church

754
00:41:33,779 --> 00:41:38,459
as a organism in the New Testament, and there's distinction between that. There are many people

755
00:41:38,459 --> 00:41:43,439
groups that come against Israel as a nation, and therefore they have the right to protect

756
00:41:43,439 --> 00:41:46,859
their borders and all of those things, and they have… the Philistines are constantly

757
00:41:46,859 --> 00:41:50,559
coming against the nation of Israel and to fight against them, and the Amorites that

758
00:41:50,559 --> 00:41:54,679
set that coalition that we read of in Joshua chapter 10, they're coming against, they

759
00:41:54,679 --> 00:42:01,319
set in battle against the city of Gibeon. Why? Because of the agreement that had been

760
00:42:01,319 --> 00:42:05,399
made between the Gibeonites and the nation of Israel, and we find that they're defeated.

761
00:42:05,399 --> 00:42:09,799
But we see that in the New Testament, God is still a God of just judgment.

762
00:42:09,799 --> 00:42:17,799
I want to remind you of 1 Corinthians chapter 11. We have our Lord's Supper table before

763
00:42:17,799 --> 00:42:22,199
us, every single service you come in, and as you walk into these doors, one of the first

764
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:26,239
things that you see is up here on the platform area, this Lord's Supper table. It says,

765
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:31,759
This do in remembrance of me. We should be mindful of the fact that as we observe the

766
00:42:31,759 --> 00:42:35,039
Lord's Supper, and even as we think about the table of remembrance that is there, and

767
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:40,159
we see those words and we're mindful of the truth of 1 Corinthians chapter 11, we speak

768
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:45,919
about that importance of eating and drinking in a fashion in which we're not eating and

769
00:42:45,919 --> 00:42:51,239
drinking unworthily. We let a man examine himself, but I want to remind you what 1

770
00:42:51,239 --> 00:42:57,999
Corinthians 11 and verse number 30 says. Those that would eat and drink unworthily, it says,

771
00:42:57,999 --> 00:43:03,759
for this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep. You understand that word

772
00:43:03,759 --> 00:43:12,919
sleep is not, you took a siesta this afternoon. The word sleep means died. They were dead.

773
00:43:12,919 --> 00:43:19,459
God's judgment. God's judgment. I would say this, as you look at the churches in the book

774
00:43:19,459 --> 00:43:26,559
of Revelation, the churches of Asia, sometimes the judgment is maybe different judgment than

775
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:32,519
what we see in the Old Testament. Maybe it's not that a people group is destroyed, but

776
00:43:32,519 --> 00:43:36,839
you know it's sad judgment when God says to the church at Ephesus, If you don't repent,

777
00:43:36,839 --> 00:43:43,879
I'm going to remove your candlestick. That's serious. But sometimes what happens is we

778
00:43:43,879 --> 00:43:48,359
don't look at that as being judgment, because the reality is that sometimes we go through

779
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:53,279
the motions of church. We don't even know if the Holy Spirit's present, if He's even…

780
00:43:53,279 --> 00:43:58,079
We're just going through what we do. We're just on our routine. We're just on our check

781
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:06,799
the box, go to church. But God's judgment, removing His presence, removing the candlestick

782
00:44:06,799 --> 00:44:14,659
as it says here in Revelation chapter 2 with dealing with the church at Ephesus. It's interesting

783
00:44:14,659 --> 00:44:20,679
as you read the messages to the churches, you find that many times that God says, Repent,

784
00:44:20,679 --> 00:44:28,039
or here's the consequence. And this evening we begin to think about some of the judgment

785
00:44:28,039 --> 00:44:33,959
that we would see in New Testament Christianity. It might not be the same kind of judgment

786
00:44:33,959 --> 00:44:38,639
that we see in the Old Testament with some of these people groups, but nonetheless it's

787
00:44:38,639 --> 00:44:44,439
judgment. And there are times that people die a premature death. Why? Because of their

788
00:44:44,439 --> 00:44:49,919
carnality, because of their behavior. I think it was D.L. Moody that said this, When God's

789
00:44:49,919 --> 00:44:54,319
people are not walking in holiness, that God begins to deal with them. And the first way

790
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:58,039
in which God deals with His people that are not walking in obedience to His Word and walking

791
00:44:58,039 --> 00:45:02,999
in holiness, for God said that we're to be holy as He is holy in all manner of conversation.

792
00:45:02,999 --> 00:45:09,079
And he said the first form of the way in which God deals with His people is that of conviction.

793
00:45:09,079 --> 00:45:16,239
You ever face conviction? What happens when we get convicted? When we hear the preaching

794
00:45:16,239 --> 00:45:19,119
of the Word of God, when we read the Word of God in our daily lives, we're reading the

795
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:25,599
Word of God and God begins to convict us. We can respond to that in one of two ways.

796
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:30,239
We can have a soft heart and respond in obedience to the Word of God and we can get right whatever

797
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:36,319
we need to get right. Or, we can harden our hearts. We can quench the Spirit of God. We

798
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:43,299
can grieve the Spirit of God. When we quench and grieve the Spirit of God, that conviction,

799
00:45:43,299 --> 00:45:48,959
we just learn how to kind of deal with it. And after a little while, we're not so impacted

800
00:45:48,959 --> 00:45:53,959
by the conviction. Someone drew a diagram and explained conviction like a triangle in

801
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:59,959
a sandbox. And eventually, the triangle in the sandbox as it rotates either way, whichever

802
00:45:59,959 --> 00:46:05,839
way you want to have it rotate in your mind, eventually after it rotates one complete revolution,

803
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:11,119
that triangle now becomes a circle. And the circle, the triangle will move freely within

804
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:17,199
the circle without any friction from the sand. Do you see it in your mind's eye? Why? Because

805
00:46:17,199 --> 00:46:20,799
we've just quenched the Spirit of God. We've grieved the Spirit of God. And so, God deals

806
00:46:20,799 --> 00:46:24,399
with conviction. And after conviction, if we don't respond to conviction, you know what

807
00:46:24,399 --> 00:46:30,359
God uses? Chastisement. You know why He chastens us? Because He loves us. And there are people

808
00:46:30,359 --> 00:46:34,699
that look at the chastisement of the Lord in a wrong way. We say, no, God chastens us

809
00:46:34,699 --> 00:46:41,799
because we're His sons, because He loves us. Dale Moody went on to say that if we don't

810
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:47,319
respond to the conviction, we face the chastisement. And if we don't respond to the chastisement,

811
00:46:47,319 --> 00:46:54,519
we face a coffin. That's pretty serious. As you look at the Word of God and you look

812
00:46:54,519 --> 00:47:00,639
at 1 Corinthians 11, and for this cause, many are sick and weakly among you, and many sleep.

813
00:47:00,639 --> 00:47:08,279
Listen, not everyone that's sick is facing the chastisement of God. We understand that

814
00:47:08,279 --> 00:47:12,199
biblically. Not every time somebody's sick. But I'm going to tell you what, if I'm sick,

815
00:47:12,199 --> 00:47:16,719
I want to... Lord, did I do something like... I want to make sure I'm not sick or weakly

816
00:47:16,719 --> 00:47:23,639
because of my disobedience. He says, many sleep. They've died. Premature deaths from

817
00:47:23,639 --> 00:47:30,679
a human, from our human perspective. Why? Because they ate and drank unworthily.

818
00:47:30,679 --> 00:47:37,639
Listen, in the New Testament, we find that God, He exercises judgment. We read it in

819
00:47:37,639 --> 00:47:43,279
Acts 5 with Ananias and Sapphira, in Acts 12 with Herod. Believers in general in 1 Corinthians

820
00:47:43,279 --> 00:47:50,159
11. The churches of Asia that are mentioned in the book of Revelation, specifically there

821
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:56,759
with the church at Ephesus, as we referenced in Revelation 2. And this evening, as we begin

822
00:47:56,759 --> 00:48:01,079
to think about our God, I'm so thankful that our God is gracious and merciful. But the

823
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:08,079
writer of Hebrews said that our God is a consuming fire, is a fearful thing to fall in the hands

824
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:15,519
of a living God, an angry God. And you think about His justice and His judgment. I'm thankful

825
00:48:15,519 --> 00:48:20,719
that God is gracious and merciful. And we do see His judgment in the Old Testament and

826
00:48:20,719 --> 00:48:25,559
the New Testament. Listen, God said of Himself, I'm the same yesterday, today, and forever.

827
00:48:25,559 --> 00:48:32,259
Begin to approach the Scriptures with that perspective as we begin to read a passage

828
00:48:32,259 --> 00:48:39,539
that seems to contradict from man's perspective what that truth reveals to us, then we better

829
00:48:39,539 --> 00:48:44,259
dig in and dig deeper and try to understand what it is that's taking place and what God

830
00:48:44,259 --> 00:48:51,659
is recording for us. So, how do we answer the skeptics? I said we'd end with Jonah 4.

831
00:48:51,659 --> 00:48:58,679
I already put my Bible away, and so some of you did as well. But look back at Jonah 4.

832
00:48:58,679 --> 00:49:07,239
Look back at Jonah chapter 4. You know, from Jonah's perspective, the people of Nineveh

833
00:49:07,239 --> 00:49:15,119
deserve judgment. Capital of Assyria, wicked people. They say that the city of Nineveh

834
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:19,919
was lined with stakes that had skulls on them from the people they defeated. It was a wicked

835
00:49:19,919 --> 00:49:28,039
place, immoral, ungodly. I think that that Nineveh, Jonah would have been perfectly happy

836
00:49:28,119 --> 00:49:33,799
if Nineveh had been destroyed. He'd have been happy about it. That's why he fled. He says

837
00:49:33,799 --> 00:49:40,839
in verse number 1, it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he is very angry. Why? Because God repented

838
00:49:40,839 --> 00:49:44,119
the evil that He had said that He would do against them or unto them, and He did it not.

839
00:49:44,119 --> 00:49:47,479
Verse number 2, he prayed unto the Lord and said, I pray thee, O Lord, was not this my

840
00:49:47,479 --> 00:49:54,239
saying when I was yet in my country? Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish. Why? For I knew

841
00:49:54,239 --> 00:50:03,039
that Thou art a gracious God, and merciful. Slow to anger.

842
00:50:03,039 --> 00:50:12,719
and of great kindness, and repentest thee of the evil." God is gracious, God is

843
00:50:12,719 --> 00:50:20,599
merciful, God is slow to anger and of great kindness, and God is just, and God

844
00:50:20,599 --> 00:50:26,959
is righteous. When people reject, whether Old Testament or New Testament, when people

845
00:50:26,959 --> 00:50:32,799
reject the grace and mercy of God, the light that God gives, judgment is the

846
00:50:32,799 --> 00:50:38,359
consequence. And so this evening I hope that that would help us in dealing with

847
00:50:38,359 --> 00:50:44,199
some skeptics, taking a more thorough approach to the Word of God, a complete

848
00:50:44,199 --> 00:50:49,039
understanding of the passages that often are looked to and attacked and

849
00:50:49,039 --> 00:50:53,039
criticized, and say, okay, let's dig in. Why did this happen the way that it did?

850
00:50:53,039 --> 00:50:58,359
What was God really revealing? Why did God send ten plagues before nine and

851
00:50:58,359 --> 00:51:04,279
then the death of the firstborn? Is that not the grace and mercy of God? Is that

852
00:51:04,279 --> 00:51:11,079
not God revealing Himself? Absolutely. But there's a refusal, there's a rejection.

853
00:51:11,079 --> 00:51:15,799
We find that throughout the Word of God, He is the judge of all the earth, and He

854
00:51:15,799 --> 00:51:20,359
always does what is right. Let's pray. Father, we love You this evening. We thank

855
00:51:20,359 --> 00:51:25,599
You for loving us. We thank You for Your precious Word, for the truth that's

856
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:31,199
contained therein. I pray this evening, we've looked at so many passages of

857
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:40,119
Scripture, we've used some examples that some may turn to in order to attack.

858
00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:49,839
We've looked at passages that show that You're no respecter of persons, that when

859
00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:57,559
Your people rejected You and refused to obey You and turned to idols, they faced

860
00:51:57,559 --> 00:52:05,599
Your judgment, severe judgment. We've looked at examples in the New Testament

861
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:16,559
of those that have faced judgment. God, I pray that this evening, as we consider

862
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:22,039
our own lives, that we would determine that we will walk in holiness and that we would

863
00:52:22,039 --> 00:52:31,039
walk in obedience to Thy Word. For we do not want to face Your hand of judgment. We'd

864
00:52:31,039 --> 00:52:38,679
much rather have Your hand of blessing. And God, I pray that You would continue to enable

865
00:52:38,759 --> 00:52:48,039
us to adequately interact with those that we come into contact with, that we'd be ready

866
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:53,519
to give an answer of the hope that lies within us. I pray that as we have a time of invitation

867
00:52:53,519 --> 00:52:57,799
that we would respond. Lord, that You do a work in our hearts and lives where You would

868
00:52:57,799 --> 00:53:00,959
be glorified, and we'll thank You for it. In Christ's name, would You stand with us?
