1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
And on Wednesday evenings here for a few weeks, of course, we were out of town last week,

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:11,279
but for a number of weeks now, we've gone through very slowly, systematically through Luke chapter

3
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:18,399
number 11 and cutting our message time, making it more abbreviated so that we can spend more time

4
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:26,000
in prayer. And I am certainly thankful for the passage and for the request of the disciple when

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,599
the disciple said, Lord, teach us to pray. And what a great request. And I'm so thankful that

6
00:00:33,599 --> 00:00:40,479
our God graciously answered, provided response. Of course, the Lord Jesus Christ is going to

7
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:46,720
reply to the disciples. And he says to them, plural, when you pray, verse number two, say,

8
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:53,279
our father, which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done as in

9
00:00:53,279 --> 00:00:58,159
heaven, so in earth. And we've looked at verse one and two in the previous lessons. And as we've

10
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:04,879
examined this passage, we understood that Jesus is providing framework for prayer. This model

11
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,599
prayer that we find here in Luke chapter 11, also in the book of Matthew, we find that it was not

12
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:14,879
intended to be memorized and just simply repeated. In fact, for some of you at some point in your

13
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:20,080
life, you probably memorized this prayer, and it was probably told to you that it was the Lord's

14
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,519
Prayer. I believe that the Lord's Prayer is found in John 17, specifically when you read that passage

15
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:31,760
of scripture. In fact, I remember when I played middle school football at Northwoods Park Middle

16
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:36,800
School in Jacksonville, North Carolina, that before every game, I didn't even go to church,

17
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:41,680
but before every game, we recited the Lord's Prayer. I didn't even know, I had no idea what

18
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,959
we were even doing or saying, had no clue. And we're in a public school, and we're all reciting

19
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:54,080
this Lord's Prayer. And the reality is that nowhere in the New Testament do you see this

20
00:01:54,080 --> 00:02:00,239
prayer, the model here that is given, do you see it prayed as just being memorized and rehearsed.

21
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:07,360
In fact, the New Testament does provide us with some recorded prayers. Of course, we've made note

22
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,320
of Paul's prayer for the believers in Colossians 1, and you read the book of Ephesians,

23
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,800
and on two occasions, Paul shares with them how he's praying for them specifically.

24
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,080
And it is nothing like what we find here. Why? Because this is a model prayer. It is not to just

25
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,119
be memorized and repeated. We've noted, as we looked at this passage of scripture, that it says

26
00:02:27,119 --> 00:02:33,119
when you pray, not if you pray, but when you pray. And the reality is that prayer is a unique

27
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:38,800
privilege for the children of God. Because of the fact that we've been born again, adopted in the

28
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,880
family of God, we have access to the very throne room of heaven. The Bible says when you pray,

29
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:51,679
say, our Father. We're mindful of that relationship that we have that enables us to have access. Of

30
00:02:51,679 --> 00:02:57,279
course, we know that he is the God of the universe, the creator of all things, and you think about the

31
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:05,119
Lord God omnipotent in all that he is, and yet he is our Father. And how precious that is for us to

32
00:03:05,119 --> 00:03:12,160
be mindful of as we enter into a sweet season of prayer. We find that, as we looked in our last

33
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:16,479
lesson, that there's an attitude of reverence and an attitude of submission. The Bible says,

34
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:22,240
hallowed be thy name, and we're mindful of our God being holy, and we are to give thanks at the

35
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:28,080
remembrance of his holiness, the psalmist says, and that we just get into the presence of God and

36
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:35,360
stand in awe of who he is. And then we find that the spirit or the attitude of really submission,

37
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:41,279
it is very possible for us, and perhaps if we'd be honest with ourselves and transparent with

38
00:03:41,279 --> 00:03:45,839
ourselves this evening, there are times in our lives that we can pinpoint that we have prayed

39
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:52,240
very selfishly. We've prayed about what we want, what our desires are, and maybe we've

40
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:59,199
lacked that attitude of submission. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done in heaven, as in heaven,

41
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:03,679
so on earth. And so we're thankful for the instruction that is given there. We come to

42
00:04:03,679 --> 00:04:12,639
verse number three, and the Bible says this, give us day by day our daily bread. Give us day by day

43
00:04:13,279 --> 00:04:18,480
our daily bread. As we focus this evening on verse number three, if I were to title the message,

44
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:25,519
I'd simply title it prayer for provision. Prayer for provision. As we look at this thought in verse

45
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:32,480
number three, the reality is that for most of us this evening, we have been abundantly blessed,

46
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:40,160
and we probably did not have to pray for our daily bread today. God has graciously blessed us as we

47
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:46,640
would sit here in the place in which we are, and we could think and very honestly agree with what

48
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:52,559
the psalmist says when he said that he hath daily loadeth me with benefits. God has provided for us,

49
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:58,320
and what a blessing. There are times in my life, there are times in our children's lives that

50
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,679
they'll say something like this, we have nothing to eat. And what that means really is that there's

51
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:08,559
nothing in the house that I would like to eat, because there's plenty of things, and you start

52
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:12,799
going through a list of the items that are available, and you find out that they're not

53
00:05:12,799 --> 00:05:18,399
hungry. I'm not hungry for those things, and there's something else that we would desire.

54
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:23,279
When we think about this particular statement that is given, again, a model, the framework for

55
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:29,200
prayer as Jesus is giving the instruction to his disciples, I'm mindful as we've looked through

56
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:34,239
here already, and it's noteworthy again in verse number three, to find the way in which he's

57
00:05:34,239 --> 00:05:40,079
mentioning the aspect of being plural as opposed to singular when he says, of course, the single

58
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:47,279
disciple asked him, Lord, teach us to pray. It says one of his disciples said, Lord, teach us to pray.

59
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:52,399
And then he says, when ye pray, say, our Father. And you find here in verse number three, again,

60
00:05:52,399 --> 00:06:01,119
the inclusiveness, give us day by day our daily bread. No doubt, as we would think about this

61
00:06:01,119 --> 00:06:07,920
prayer for provision, I believe that really it has two levels of being able to impact us. Number one,

62
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:13,920
if you're taking notes, I believe that it impacts our perspective. It impacts our perspective.

63
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:18,799
You know, the reality is that for some of us today in the particular area in which we live,

64
00:06:18,799 --> 00:06:24,000
and just really with the plenty that God has blessed us with, we may not think day by day

65
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,799
about our provision that we need. And we understand that provision here, specifically when he says,

66
00:06:28,799 --> 00:06:34,720
our daily bread, speaking about the food provision, but we have need of provision.

67
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:40,399
But when we think about this phrase that is given here, and again, the framework for prayer,

68
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:45,600
I believe that as we would begin to follow the framework that it impacts our perspective in this

69
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:53,040
way, it allows us to have an awareness and recognition that God is indeed our provider.

70
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:59,600
You think about the passage, our Father which art in heaven, and you get to verse number three,

71
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:07,279
give us, who's he praying to? He's praying to the Lord, to God Almighty, give us day by day

72
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:13,040
our daily bread. When we pray that and understand the framework in this prayer for provision,

73
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:18,799
again, not memorizing and just mindlessly repeating, but when we're mindful of this

74
00:07:18,799 --> 00:07:24,559
perspective and we have an awareness and a recognition that God is our provider.

75
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:29,279
I think about the children of Israel, and we won't take time to go back there, but if you

76
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:34,720
think about Exodus chapter number 16, where God provides us with a record of the manna that came

77
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:41,600
down from heaven and how God provided for his children, you're mindful of the fact that they

78
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:47,600
would collect that, and if they left it over, it would spoil, it would stink, it would breed worms,

79
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:53,679
and so on and so forth, and they would need to just take their daily allotment, and they would

80
00:07:53,679 --> 00:08:00,160
find that God on that next day would provide again. What a great reminder for them. I'm mindful

81
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:05,760
as they would enter into the land of promise in Joshua chapter number five, after they cross over

82
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:11,440
and commemorate the crossing and all that takes place there, you find that the Bible tells us

83
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:17,920
in verse number 12 that the manna ceases, but they ate of the fruit of the land. God was providing

84
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,959
for his people, and when we begin to have this mindset and this framework for our prayer,

85
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:31,119
and we're mindful of this prayer for provision, that it would impact my perspective to help me

86
00:08:31,119 --> 00:08:38,400
have this understanding, this recognition that God is my provider. I believe that it's also

87
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:45,919
impactful for us to be able to instruct our children, to help them understand that God has

88
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:52,640
graciously provided for us, and the provision that he has given to us. We find that God is aware

89
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,520
of our needs. He's created us. He knows what we need. In fact, Matthew 6, you don't need to turn

90
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:02,799
there, if you'd like you can, in Matthew 6 and verse number 8, we find that the Bible tells us

91
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:08,719
this, be not ye therefore like unto them, speaking of those that were praying, he called them

92
00:09:08,719 --> 00:09:16,400
hypocrites and so on and so forth, and he says here, your father knoweth what things ye have

93
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:22,960
need of before ye ask him. I made the statement to someone actually today, and I said to the

94
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:27,760
individual, I said, you know, the reality is that prayer, sometimes when we think about prayer, not

95
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:35,039
only is it moving the hand of God, but prayer helps my own perspective. We're going to think about God

96
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:41,280
and his provision for us, and the fact that he is the provider. You say, no, I go to work and I

97
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:46,080
provide for my family. I understand that you're supposed to provide for your family. In fact,

98
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,400
the New Testament speaks about those that would not provide for their family. They're worse than

99
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:56,320
an infidel, but the reality is that we understand that it's God who's given us the ability,

100
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:02,239
and so ultimately God is the provider. Notice what the book of Deuteronomy tells us with regard to

101
00:10:02,239 --> 00:10:07,520
this thought in Deuteronomy chapter number 8, and Deuteronomy 8 and verse number 18. Now remember,

102
00:10:08,239 --> 00:10:15,039
in this portion of the book of Deuteronomy, you would find that God is preparing his children for

103
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:19,520
entrance into the land, and remember in chapter number 6, he says when you come into a land that's

104
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,880
full of all of these things, and you have houses that you didn't build, and you have

105
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:28,080
vineyards that you didn't plant, and you have all of these things, beware lest thou forget the Lord.

106
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:35,440
We find that Deuteronomy 8 and verse number 18 says this, but thou shalt remember the Lord thy God,

107
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:44,159
for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant which he swear

108
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:50,640
unto thy fathers as it is this day. Everything comes from God. He may have given you employment

109
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:56,400
somewhere, and he may use that source of employment to provide for your needs, but you understand that

110
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:02,479
he is the provider. We begin to think about this prayer for provision and how it would impact my

111
00:11:02,479 --> 00:11:09,440
perspective, and it would help me to be mindful of who he is and how he provides. Remember, he's the

112
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:19,440
shepherd. Psalm 23, a precious passage of scripture, the Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. Why?

113
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,840
Because what does a good shepherd do? A good shepherd leads his sheep into the green pasture,

114
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:29,440
a good shepherd leads his sheep into the green pastures, right? A good shepherd takes care of his

115
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,400
sheep, and guess what? Our God is a good shepherd. He is the good shepherd. He's the great shepherd,

116
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:40,320
and I'm so thankful that he's my shepherd. And we think about this perspective with this

117
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:46,080
framework of prayers as mentioned in Luke chapter number 11, and the reality is just like the

118
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:51,679
children of Israel, you know, the fact of the matter is that we can get very comfortable with

119
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:58,000
things in life and forget some things, as was the warning in Deuteronomy chapter number six.

120
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,840
And so this framework, this model that the Lord is providing to the disciples, and of course

121
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:08,479
preserved for us this evening, helps us in our perspective. Not only does it help us in our

122
00:12:08,479 --> 00:12:12,880
perspective and I think impact our perspective, but another thought this evening is that it will

123
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:20,640
impact our praise. Many of us, no doubt, when we would sit down to have a meal, we will pray and

124
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:27,359
thank God for the meal that is before us. And sometimes, if we're not careful, it can almost

125
00:12:27,359 --> 00:12:34,239
just become a routine kind of thing, almost a memorized prayer. We just kind of, oh we're going

126
00:12:34,239 --> 00:12:40,960
to pray, we're going to pray for the food, but I wonder if we have really prayed and recognized,

127
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:47,200
be aware of the fact that God is our provider, that when we sit down and we have that meal that

128
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:52,479
is before us, how it would really impact our praise. Understand that God has provided for us

129
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,520
and He's provided abundantly before us. And I understand that as we're sitting here in one of

130
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:03,280
the wealthiest counties in all of America, right, one of the wealthiest nations in all of the world,

131
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:08,880
that sometimes it's hard for us to really kind of relate to this sort of thing, but even in our

132
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:14,640
position and how the Lord has blessed us, we're mindful that it's the Lord that has blessed us

133
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:20,960
and it should impact our praise. See, I believe this evening that as we pray for His provision,

134
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:28,400
that we'll be mindful to praise Him for that provision. I believe this evening that it is

135
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:33,440
very easy for us, and I believe it's a very dangerous position to be in, it's very easy

136
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:40,559
for us to take God's provision for granted. Just take it for granted. And just, you know,

137
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:47,919
we really, in a lot of ways, we do that in a lot of areas of life. Most times we walk in and we

138
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:54,719
turn lights on in a building and we probably don't even think about the electricity, the whatever,

139
00:13:54,719 --> 00:13:58,880
it just comes on and we just take it for granted that it's going to come on, until you turn on

140
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,599
that switch and it doesn't come on. And then all of a sudden, man, what's going on? I can't believe,

141
00:14:03,599 --> 00:14:07,200
right, and this is going to ruin my day and I'm not going to be on time and whatever, right?

142
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:11,599
But the reality is that we just, as human beings, sometimes we can take things for granted.

143
00:14:11,599 --> 00:14:15,200
And that's what the danger was for the children of Israel when they would enter into the land of

144
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:21,200
promise. And I think the reality is that for us this evening, when we think about this truth and

145
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:27,039
this framework in which the Lord gives and answers the disciple and teaches the disciples, He's

146
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:35,039
helping them to understand that when we have this model and this framework, that it will help us to

147
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:41,679
be mindful of the fact that He is our provider, which will lead us to praising Him. And I mean

148
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:48,479
truly thanking Him for His provision and not just going through the, oh yeah, we're going to pray

149
00:14:48,479 --> 00:14:54,320
before we eat and keep it short, if you would, because the meal's hot, we're hungry. No, no,

150
00:14:54,320 --> 00:15:01,919
that we would truly be appreciative of what God has provided for us. And the truth, turn over to

151
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:08,320
Psalm 37, if you will. And when you look at Psalm 37 and the testimony that's here, I know that many

152
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:14,000
of us are familiar with this portion of Scripture and the psalm of David and what powerful truth is

153
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,320
contained. It's obviously nowhere near the longest psalm, but it is a lengthy psalm. And here we find

154
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:28,479
that David gives testimony. And I am thankful for what he says in verse number 25 of Psalm 37.

155
00:15:28,479 --> 00:15:33,039
And I believe how it relates to our study this evening with this thought from Luke 11 in verse

156
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:40,719
number 3. It says, I have been young and now am old, yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken

157
00:15:41,359 --> 00:15:49,200
nor his seed begging bread. Sometimes I think in the Christian life, if we're not careful,

158
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:54,719
things can just become very methodical, if you will. And I think there's a danger

159
00:15:55,119 --> 00:16:01,440
here, specifically with regard to the subject matter of prayer. We just kind of get into this

160
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:07,119
methodical kind of thing of prayer. And one of the reasons why I've chosen to go so slowly through

161
00:16:07,119 --> 00:16:12,239
this passage in Luke chapter number 11 is not only for my own good, but I hope to be a blessing to

162
00:16:12,239 --> 00:16:19,919
you as well, is for us to really just be mindful of when we enter into a season of prayer, that

163
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:25,760
we're praying to the Lord God Almighty, and that He is the creator and sustainer of all things,

164
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:29,280
and that we have access because of this relationship that we have with Him.

165
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:34,559
Begin to think about this prayer of provision, that we do not take things for granted. See,

166
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:39,679
when you're praying for your provision, when you're mindful of—see, the Bible talks about

167
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:46,719
wealth making wings and flying away. The reality is that there are some people that we could look

168
00:16:46,719 --> 00:16:54,320
at historically that seem to have plenty, and in just a short turn of events, things can change in

169
00:16:54,320 --> 00:17:00,080
a hurry. And we think about this prayer of provision, and it reminds us that our God is

170
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:06,880
our provider. He's our provider. And we ought to praise Him. We ought to thank Him. You know, we go,

171
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:13,760
and we—most times we go to the grocery store, and maybe we just have a list. Maybe it's a

172
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,079
shared list, whatever it might be, and you just go through the grocery store, and you just purchase

173
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:22,400
the items that are on your list, and maybe not even given a whole lot of thought to it. A number

174
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,599
of years ago, Holly and I had the opportunity. In fact, it was—it's coming up on being five years

175
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:33,280
ago. We were down in Florida for our 15th wedding anniversary, and in August, we'll celebrate 20

176
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:38,560
years. And so, it was just about five years ago, and we were down in Orlando for just a couple of

177
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:45,119
days, just her and I, and just enjoying some time away. And we drove over to Hope Children's Home

178
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:49,359
in Tampa. And as we drove over there to Hope Children's Home, we had the privilege of being

179
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:55,040
able to take a tour and go through the facility. And I don't remember the fellow's name that took

180
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:59,040
us on the tour. We had the privilege of seeing Brother Higgins and his wife and what have you.

181
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:04,160
But as we went on that tour, we'd go through these rooms and see where they would, of course, have

182
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,400
their activities and that sort of thing, go through the school. As we'd go into the kitchen

183
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,880
areas, you would see in the dining hall and what have you, there'd be a board, and it was kind of a

184
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:18,319
wish list, and some items would be on that thing of things they were praying for. And I remember

185
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:24,079
going through and seeing in each of those rooms and asking the fellow that was giving us a tour

186
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:29,920
about the items that were listed on this board. And one of them in particular, I remember probably

187
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:35,680
because of a conversation I had with my niece today, it was bacon. And I said, bacon's on all

188
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:41,359
of these boards everywhere I go. And Adeline told me today that her favorite vegetable is bacon.

189
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:45,760
And I said, she has some things to learn in life. I mean, you're on a good track, but I mean, you know,

190
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:51,280
but they were all praying for bacon, I inquired. And he said, we haven't had bacon a long time,

191
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:58,959
and we're praying for bacon. And I just thought about that for a moment. And here's, just honestly,

192
00:18:58,959 --> 00:19:07,520
here's what I thought. If I want bacon, we go to the store and buy it. Honestly, I've never prayed

193
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:15,439
for bacon. I just haven't. But I was so impressed with going through there and seeing that. And

194
00:19:15,439 --> 00:19:20,800
there were a number of other things on the list. And when we got done the tour, there's a Walmart

195
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:26,640
just, I don't know, a mile or so up the road. And Holly and I drove up to the Walmart and got a

196
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,920
whole bunch, two carts full of groceries to take back. And we put a whole lot of bacon in the cart.

197
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:38,079
Because we just want it to be a blessing. Because those kids, and I thought about the lesson that

198
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:43,119
those kids were learning, and the way in which they were seeing how God would work and how God

199
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:48,640
would answer. And this evening, we think about the framework, and we think about the, listen,

200
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:55,520
God's been good to us. He really has. But we need to recognize that it's God who has been good to us.

201
00:19:56,239 --> 00:20:02,239
And He's provided for us. He is our provider. We need to praise Him accordingly. And again,

202
00:20:02,239 --> 00:20:07,760
for many of us, I know I've said years, I've said this over the years, and it's been a while

203
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:14,160
probably since I've said it, but most of us do not have to pray for our daily bread. We really don't.

204
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:22,880
Because God's blessed us. But when we understand the framework by which God has given us here,

205
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:28,479
we pray for God's continued provision for our families, for our lives, for one another. And

206
00:20:28,479 --> 00:20:34,079
then we praise Him for His provision. Every day of my life, I pray and I thank God for

207
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:39,199
a number of things. But as I think about God being my shepherd, I thank Him for

208
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:49,119
His provision, His protection, and His presence. Every day. And I try to instruct and instill in

209
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:56,160
our children, God has provided for us. We have a good God. And as we think about the framework of

210
00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:01,359
this passage of scripture, such a simple thought, but I hope that it would impact our perspective,

211
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:07,680
that we'd be more aware of and recognize that God is our provider, and that we would praise

212
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:14,319
Him accordingly. It's so easy to take things for granted. It's so easy to just be comfortable,

213
00:21:14,959 --> 00:21:21,439
increased with goods, as the church of the Laodiceans in Revelation 3. We have a good God.

214
00:21:21,439 --> 00:21:26,160
Prayer for provision. Let's pray. Father, we love You. We thank You so much for loving us.

215
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:35,680
We do thank You for Your provision. We thank You for just, Lord, as we look at our lives and see

216
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:44,079
Your hand. God, we just want to thank You this evening and praise You. Lord, we know that there

217
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:50,079
are brothers and sisters in other parts of this nation, other parts of the world,

218
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:57,199
that do not have the same level of provision that we may enjoy and experience.

219
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:05,680
God, we rejoice in how You take care of them as well. The testimony of David in Psalm 37 and verse

220
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:10,400
25. Father, I pray this evening that You would help us to be mindful,

221
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:19,599
regularly mindful, of the truth that You are our provider and that we would praise You accordingly.

222
00:22:20,239 --> 00:22:23,680
We do pray that You'd bless our time of prayer. We thank You for the privilege.

223
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,280
I pray that You would move mightily and we'll thank You for it. In Christ's name we pray. Amen.
