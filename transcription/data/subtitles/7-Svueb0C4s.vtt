WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.360
And on Wednesday evenings here for a few weeks, of course, we were out of town last week,

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:11.279
but for a number of weeks now, we've gone through very slowly, systematically through Luke chapter

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:18.399
number 11 and cutting our message time, making it more abbreviated so that we can spend more time

00:00:18.399 --> 00:00:26.000
in prayer. And I am certainly thankful for the passage and for the request of the disciple when

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.599
the disciple said, Lord, teach us to pray. And what a great request. And I'm so thankful that

00:00:33.599 --> 00:00:40.479
our God graciously answered, provided response. Of course, the Lord Jesus Christ is going to

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:46.720
reply to the disciples. And he says to them, plural, when you pray, verse number two, say,

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:53.279
our father, which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done as in

00:00:53.279 --> 00:00:58.159
heaven, so in earth. And we've looked at verse one and two in the previous lessons. And as we've

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:04.879
examined this passage, we understood that Jesus is providing framework for prayer. This model

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.599
prayer that we find here in Luke chapter 11, also in the book of Matthew, we find that it was not

00:01:09.599 --> 00:01:14.879
intended to be memorized and just simply repeated. In fact, for some of you at some point in your

00:01:14.879 --> 00:01:20.080
life, you probably memorized this prayer, and it was probably told to you that it was the Lord's

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.519
Prayer. I believe that the Lord's Prayer is found in John 17, specifically when you read that passage

00:01:25.519 --> 00:01:31.760
of scripture. In fact, I remember when I played middle school football at Northwoods Park Middle

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.800
School in Jacksonville, North Carolina, that before every game, I didn't even go to church,

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.680
but before every game, we recited the Lord's Prayer. I didn't even know, I had no idea what

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.959
we were even doing or saying, had no clue. And we're in a public school, and we're all reciting

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:54.080
this Lord's Prayer. And the reality is that nowhere in the New Testament do you see this

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:00.239
prayer, the model here that is given, do you see it prayed as just being memorized and rehearsed.

00:02:00.239 --> 00:02:07.360
In fact, the New Testament does provide us with some recorded prayers. Of course, we've made note

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.320
of Paul's prayer for the believers in Colossians 1, and you read the book of Ephesians,

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.800
and on two occasions, Paul shares with them how he's praying for them specifically.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.080
And it is nothing like what we find here. Why? Because this is a model prayer. It is not to just

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.119
be memorized and repeated. We've noted, as we looked at this passage of scripture, that it says

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:33.119
when you pray, not if you pray, but when you pray. And the reality is that prayer is a unique

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:38.800
privilege for the children of God. Because of the fact that we've been born again, adopted in the

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.880
family of God, we have access to the very throne room of heaven. The Bible says when you pray,

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:51.679
say, our Father. We're mindful of that relationship that we have that enables us to have access. Of

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:57.279
course, we know that he is the God of the universe, the creator of all things, and you think about the

00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:05.119
Lord God omnipotent in all that he is, and yet he is our Father. And how precious that is for us to

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:12.160
be mindful of as we enter into a sweet season of prayer. We find that, as we looked in our last

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.479
lesson, that there's an attitude of reverence and an attitude of submission. The Bible says,

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:22.240
hallowed be thy name, and we're mindful of our God being holy, and we are to give thanks at the

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:28.080
remembrance of his holiness, the psalmist says, and that we just get into the presence of God and

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:35.360
stand in awe of who he is. And then we find that the spirit or the attitude of really submission,

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.279
it is very possible for us, and perhaps if we'd be honest with ourselves and transparent with

00:03:41.279 --> 00:03:45.839
ourselves this evening, there are times in our lives that we can pinpoint that we have prayed

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:52.240
very selfishly. We've prayed about what we want, what our desires are, and maybe we've

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:59.199
lacked that attitude of submission. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done in heaven, as in heaven,

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:03.679
so on earth. And so we're thankful for the instruction that is given there. We come to

00:04:03.679 --> 00:04:12.639
verse number three, and the Bible says this, give us day by day our daily bread. Give us day by day

00:04:13.279 --> 00:04:18.480
our daily bread. As we focus this evening on verse number three, if I were to title the message,

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:25.519
I'd simply title it prayer for provision. Prayer for provision. As we look at this thought in verse

00:04:25.519 --> 00:04:32.480
number three, the reality is that for most of us this evening, we have been abundantly blessed,

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:40.160
and we probably did not have to pray for our daily bread today. God has graciously blessed us as we

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:46.640
would sit here in the place in which we are, and we could think and very honestly agree with what

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:52.559
the psalmist says when he said that he hath daily loadeth me with benefits. God has provided for us,

00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:58.320
and what a blessing. There are times in my life, there are times in our children's lives that

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:03.679
they'll say something like this, we have nothing to eat. And what that means really is that there's

00:05:03.679 --> 00:05:08.559
nothing in the house that I would like to eat, because there's plenty of things, and you start

00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:12.799
going through a list of the items that are available, and you find out that they're not

00:05:12.799 --> 00:05:18.399
hungry. I'm not hungry for those things, and there's something else that we would desire.

00:05:18.399 --> 00:05:23.279
When we think about this particular statement that is given, again, a model, the framework for

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:29.200
prayer as Jesus is giving the instruction to his disciples, I'm mindful as we've looked through

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:34.239
here already, and it's noteworthy again in verse number three, to find the way in which he's

00:05:34.239 --> 00:05:40.079
mentioning the aspect of being plural as opposed to singular when he says, of course, the single

00:05:40.079 --> 00:05:47.279
disciple asked him, Lord, teach us to pray. It says one of his disciples said, Lord, teach us to pray.

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:52.399
And then he says, when ye pray, say, our Father. And you find here in verse number three, again,

00:05:52.399 --> 00:06:01.119
the inclusiveness, give us day by day our daily bread. No doubt, as we would think about this

00:06:01.119 --> 00:06:07.920
prayer for provision, I believe that really it has two levels of being able to impact us. Number one,

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:13.920
if you're taking notes, I believe that it impacts our perspective. It impacts our perspective.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:18.799
You know, the reality is that for some of us today in the particular area in which we live,

00:06:18.799 --> 00:06:24.000
and just really with the plenty that God has blessed us with, we may not think day by day

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.799
about our provision that we need. And we understand that provision here, specifically when he says,

00:06:28.799 --> 00:06:34.720
our daily bread, speaking about the food provision, but we have need of provision.

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:40.399
But when we think about this phrase that is given here, and again, the framework for prayer,

00:06:40.399 --> 00:06:45.600
I believe that as we would begin to follow the framework that it impacts our perspective in this

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:53.040
way, it allows us to have an awareness and recognition that God is indeed our provider.

00:06:53.679 --> 00:06:59.600
You think about the passage, our Father which art in heaven, and you get to verse number three,

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:07.279
give us, who's he praying to? He's praying to the Lord, to God Almighty, give us day by day

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:13.040
our daily bread. When we pray that and understand the framework in this prayer for provision,

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:18.799
again, not memorizing and just mindlessly repeating, but when we're mindful of this

00:07:18.799 --> 00:07:24.559
perspective and we have an awareness and a recognition that God is our provider.

00:07:25.519 --> 00:07:29.279
I think about the children of Israel, and we won't take time to go back there, but if you

00:07:29.279 --> 00:07:34.720
think about Exodus chapter number 16, where God provides us with a record of the manna that came

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:41.600
down from heaven and how God provided for his children, you're mindful of the fact that they

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:47.600
would collect that, and if they left it over, it would spoil, it would stink, it would breed worms,

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:53.679
and so on and so forth, and they would need to just take their daily allotment, and they would

00:07:53.679 --> 00:08:00.160
find that God on that next day would provide again. What a great reminder for them. I'm mindful

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:05.760
as they would enter into the land of promise in Joshua chapter number five, after they cross over

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:11.440
and commemorate the crossing and all that takes place there, you find that the Bible tells us

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:17.920
in verse number 12 that the manna ceases, but they ate of the fruit of the land. God was providing

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:24.959
for his people, and when we begin to have this mindset and this framework for our prayer,

00:08:25.519 --> 00:08:31.119
and we're mindful of this prayer for provision, that it would impact my perspective to help me

00:08:31.119 --> 00:08:38.400
have this understanding, this recognition that God is my provider. I believe that it's also

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:45.919
impactful for us to be able to instruct our children, to help them understand that God has

00:08:45.919 --> 00:08:52.640
graciously provided for us, and the provision that he has given to us. We find that God is aware

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:57.520
of our needs. He's created us. He knows what we need. In fact, Matthew 6, you don't need to turn

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:02.799
there, if you'd like you can, in Matthew 6 and verse number 8, we find that the Bible tells us

00:09:02.799 --> 00:09:08.719
this, be not ye therefore like unto them, speaking of those that were praying, he called them

00:09:08.719 --> 00:09:16.400
hypocrites and so on and so forth, and he says here, your father knoweth what things ye have

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:22.960
need of before ye ask him. I made the statement to someone actually today, and I said to the

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:27.760
individual, I said, you know, the reality is that prayer, sometimes when we think about prayer, not

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:35.039
only is it moving the hand of God, but prayer helps my own perspective. We're going to think about God

00:09:35.039 --> 00:09:41.280
and his provision for us, and the fact that he is the provider. You say, no, I go to work and I

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:46.080
provide for my family. I understand that you're supposed to provide for your family. In fact,

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:50.400
the New Testament speaks about those that would not provide for their family. They're worse than

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:56.320
an infidel, but the reality is that we understand that it's God who's given us the ability,

00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:02.239
and so ultimately God is the provider. Notice what the book of Deuteronomy tells us with regard to

00:10:02.239 --> 00:10:07.520
this thought in Deuteronomy chapter number 8, and Deuteronomy 8 and verse number 18. Now remember,

00:10:08.239 --> 00:10:15.039
in this portion of the book of Deuteronomy, you would find that God is preparing his children for

00:10:15.039 --> 00:10:19.520
entrance into the land, and remember in chapter number 6, he says when you come into a land that's

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:22.880
full of all of these things, and you have houses that you didn't build, and you have

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:28.080
vineyards that you didn't plant, and you have all of these things, beware lest thou forget the Lord.

00:10:29.039 --> 00:10:35.440
We find that Deuteronomy 8 and verse number 18 says this, but thou shalt remember the Lord thy God,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:44.159
for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant which he swear

00:10:44.159 --> 00:10:50.640
unto thy fathers as it is this day. Everything comes from God. He may have given you employment

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:56.400
somewhere, and he may use that source of employment to provide for your needs, but you understand that

00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:02.479
he is the provider. We begin to think about this prayer for provision and how it would impact my

00:11:02.479 --> 00:11:09.440
perspective, and it would help me to be mindful of who he is and how he provides. Remember, he's the

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:19.440
shepherd. Psalm 23, a precious passage of scripture, the Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. Why?

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:23.840
Because what does a good shepherd do? A good shepherd leads his sheep into the green pasture,

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:29.440
a good shepherd leads his sheep into the green pastures, right? A good shepherd takes care of his

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:34.400
sheep, and guess what? Our God is a good shepherd. He is the good shepherd. He's the great shepherd,

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:40.320
and I'm so thankful that he's my shepherd. And we think about this perspective with this

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:46.080
framework of prayers as mentioned in Luke chapter number 11, and the reality is just like the

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:51.679
children of Israel, you know, the fact of the matter is that we can get very comfortable with

00:11:51.679 --> 00:11:58.000
things in life and forget some things, as was the warning in Deuteronomy chapter number six.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.840
And so this framework, this model that the Lord is providing to the disciples, and of course

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:08.479
preserved for us this evening, helps us in our perspective. Not only does it help us in our

00:12:08.479 --> 00:12:12.880
perspective and I think impact our perspective, but another thought this evening is that it will

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:20.640
impact our praise. Many of us, no doubt, when we would sit down to have a meal, we will pray and

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:27.359
thank God for the meal that is before us. And sometimes, if we're not careful, it can almost

00:12:27.359 --> 00:12:34.239
just become a routine kind of thing, almost a memorized prayer. We just kind of, oh we're going

00:12:34.239 --> 00:12:40.960
to pray, we're going to pray for the food, but I wonder if we have really prayed and recognized,

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:47.200
be aware of the fact that God is our provider, that when we sit down and we have that meal that

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:52.479
is before us, how it would really impact our praise. Understand that God has provided for us

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:57.520
and He's provided abundantly before us. And I understand that as we're sitting here in one of

00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:03.280
the wealthiest counties in all of America, right, one of the wealthiest nations in all of the world,

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:08.880
that sometimes it's hard for us to really kind of relate to this sort of thing, but even in our

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:14.640
position and how the Lord has blessed us, we're mindful that it's the Lord that has blessed us

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:20.960
and it should impact our praise. See, I believe this evening that as we pray for His provision,

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:28.400
that we'll be mindful to praise Him for that provision. I believe this evening that it is

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:33.440
very easy for us, and I believe it's a very dangerous position to be in, it's very easy

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:40.559
for us to take God's provision for granted. Just take it for granted. And just, you know,

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:47.919
we really, in a lot of ways, we do that in a lot of areas of life. Most times we walk in and we

00:13:47.919 --> 00:13:54.719
turn lights on in a building and we probably don't even think about the electricity, the whatever,

00:13:54.719 --> 00:13:58.880
it just comes on and we just take it for granted that it's going to come on, until you turn on

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:03.599
that switch and it doesn't come on. And then all of a sudden, man, what's going on? I can't believe,

00:14:03.599 --> 00:14:07.200
right, and this is going to ruin my day and I'm not going to be on time and whatever, right?

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:11.599
But the reality is that we just, as human beings, sometimes we can take things for granted.

00:14:11.599 --> 00:14:15.200
And that's what the danger was for the children of Israel when they would enter into the land of

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:21.200
promise. And I think the reality is that for us this evening, when we think about this truth and

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:27.039
this framework in which the Lord gives and answers the disciple and teaches the disciples, He's

00:14:27.039 --> 00:14:35.039
helping them to understand that when we have this model and this framework, that it will help us to

00:14:35.039 --> 00:14:41.679
be mindful of the fact that He is our provider, which will lead us to praising Him. And I mean

00:14:41.679 --> 00:14:48.479
truly thanking Him for His provision and not just going through the, oh yeah, we're going to pray

00:14:48.479 --> 00:14:54.320
before we eat and keep it short, if you would, because the meal's hot, we're hungry. No, no,

00:14:54.320 --> 00:15:01.919
that we would truly be appreciative of what God has provided for us. And the truth, turn over to

00:15:01.919 --> 00:15:08.320
Psalm 37, if you will. And when you look at Psalm 37 and the testimony that's here, I know that many

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:14.000
of us are familiar with this portion of Scripture and the psalm of David and what powerful truth is

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:20.320
contained. It's obviously nowhere near the longest psalm, but it is a lengthy psalm. And here we find

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:28.479
that David gives testimony. And I am thankful for what he says in verse number 25 of Psalm 37.

00:15:28.479 --> 00:15:33.039
And I believe how it relates to our study this evening with this thought from Luke 11 in verse

00:15:33.039 --> 00:15:40.719
number 3. It says, I have been young and now am old, yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken

00:15:41.359 --> 00:15:49.200
nor his seed begging bread. Sometimes I think in the Christian life, if we're not careful,

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:54.719
things can just become very methodical, if you will. And I think there's a danger

00:15:55.119 --> 00:16:01.440
here, specifically with regard to the subject matter of prayer. We just kind of get into this

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:07.119
methodical kind of thing of prayer. And one of the reasons why I've chosen to go so slowly through

00:16:07.119 --> 00:16:12.239
this passage in Luke chapter number 11 is not only for my own good, but I hope to be a blessing to

00:16:12.239 --> 00:16:19.919
you as well, is for us to really just be mindful of when we enter into a season of prayer, that

00:16:19.919 --> 00:16:25.760
we're praying to the Lord God Almighty, and that He is the creator and sustainer of all things,

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:29.280
and that we have access because of this relationship that we have with Him.

00:16:30.159 --> 00:16:34.559
Begin to think about this prayer of provision, that we do not take things for granted. See,

00:16:34.559 --> 00:16:39.679
when you're praying for your provision, when you're mindful of—see, the Bible talks about

00:16:39.679 --> 00:16:46.719
wealth making wings and flying away. The reality is that there are some people that we could look

00:16:46.719 --> 00:16:54.320
at historically that seem to have plenty, and in just a short turn of events, things can change in

00:16:54.320 --> 00:17:00.080
a hurry. And we think about this prayer of provision, and it reminds us that our God is

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:06.880
our provider. He's our provider. And we ought to praise Him. We ought to thank Him. You know, we go,

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:13.760
and we—most times we go to the grocery store, and maybe we just have a list. Maybe it's a

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:18.079
shared list, whatever it might be, and you just go through the grocery store, and you just purchase

00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:22.400
the items that are on your list, and maybe not even given a whole lot of thought to it. A number

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:27.599
of years ago, Holly and I had the opportunity. In fact, it was—it's coming up on being five years

00:17:27.599 --> 00:17:33.280
ago. We were down in Florida for our 15th wedding anniversary, and in August, we'll celebrate 20

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:38.560
years. And so, it was just about five years ago, and we were down in Orlando for just a couple of

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:45.119
days, just her and I, and just enjoying some time away. And we drove over to Hope Children's Home

00:17:45.119 --> 00:17:49.359
in Tampa. And as we drove over there to Hope Children's Home, we had the privilege of being

00:17:49.359 --> 00:17:55.040
able to take a tour and go through the facility. And I don't remember the fellow's name that took

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:59.040
us on the tour. We had the privilege of seeing Brother Higgins and his wife and what have you.

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:04.160
But as we went on that tour, we'd go through these rooms and see where they would, of course, have

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:08.400
their activities and that sort of thing, go through the school. As we'd go into the kitchen

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:12.880
areas, you would see in the dining hall and what have you, there'd be a board, and it was kind of a

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:18.319
wish list, and some items would be on that thing of things they were praying for. And I remember

00:18:18.319 --> 00:18:24.079
going through and seeing in each of those rooms and asking the fellow that was giving us a tour

00:18:24.079 --> 00:18:29.920
about the items that were listed on this board. And one of them in particular, I remember probably

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:35.680
because of a conversation I had with my niece today, it was bacon. And I said, bacon's on all

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:41.359
of these boards everywhere I go. And Adeline told me today that her favorite vegetable is bacon.

00:18:41.359 --> 00:18:45.760
And I said, she has some things to learn in life. I mean, you're on a good track, but I mean, you know,

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:51.280
but they were all praying for bacon, I inquired. And he said, we haven't had bacon a long time,

00:18:52.079 --> 00:18:58.959
and we're praying for bacon. And I just thought about that for a moment. And here's, just honestly,

00:18:58.959 --> 00:19:07.520
here's what I thought. If I want bacon, we go to the store and buy it. Honestly, I've never prayed

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:15.439
for bacon. I just haven't. But I was so impressed with going through there and seeing that. And

00:19:15.439 --> 00:19:20.800
there were a number of other things on the list. And when we got done the tour, there's a Walmart

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:26.640
just, I don't know, a mile or so up the road. And Holly and I drove up to the Walmart and got a

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:31.920
whole bunch, two carts full of groceries to take back. And we put a whole lot of bacon in the cart.

00:19:33.119 --> 00:19:38.079
Because we just want it to be a blessing. Because those kids, and I thought about the lesson that

00:19:38.079 --> 00:19:43.119
those kids were learning, and the way in which they were seeing how God would work and how God

00:19:43.119 --> 00:19:48.640
would answer. And this evening, we think about the framework, and we think about the, listen,

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:55.520
God's been good to us. He really has. But we need to recognize that it's God who has been good to us.

00:19:56.239 --> 00:20:02.239
And He's provided for us. He is our provider. We need to praise Him accordingly. And again,

00:20:02.239 --> 00:20:07.760
for many of us, I know I've said years, I've said this over the years, and it's been a while

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:14.160
probably since I've said it, but most of us do not have to pray for our daily bread. We really don't.

00:20:15.599 --> 00:20:22.880
Because God's blessed us. But when we understand the framework by which God has given us here,

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:28.479
we pray for God's continued provision for our families, for our lives, for one another. And

00:20:28.479 --> 00:20:34.079
then we praise Him for His provision. Every day of my life, I pray and I thank God for

00:20:34.079 --> 00:20:39.199
a number of things. But as I think about God being my shepherd, I thank Him for

00:20:41.199 --> 00:20:49.119
His provision, His protection, and His presence. Every day. And I try to instruct and instill in

00:20:49.119 --> 00:20:56.160
our children, God has provided for us. We have a good God. And as we think about the framework of

00:20:56.160 --> 00:21:01.359
this passage of scripture, such a simple thought, but I hope that it would impact our perspective,

00:21:01.359 --> 00:21:07.680
that we'd be more aware of and recognize that God is our provider, and that we would praise

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:14.319
Him accordingly. It's so easy to take things for granted. It's so easy to just be comfortable,

00:21:14.959 --> 00:21:21.439
increased with goods, as the church of the Laodiceans in Revelation 3. We have a good God.

00:21:21.439 --> 00:21:26.160
Prayer for provision. Let's pray. Father, we love You. We thank You so much for loving us.

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:35.680
We do thank You for Your provision. We thank You for just, Lord, as we look at our lives and see

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:44.079
Your hand. God, we just want to thank You this evening and praise You. Lord, we know that there

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:50.079
are brothers and sisters in other parts of this nation, other parts of the world,

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:57.199
that do not have the same level of provision that we may enjoy and experience.

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:05.680
God, we rejoice in how You take care of them as well. The testimony of David in Psalm 37 and verse

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:10.400
25. Father, I pray this evening that You would help us to be mindful,

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:19.599
regularly mindful, of the truth that You are our provider and that we would praise You accordingly.

00:22:20.239 --> 00:22:23.680
We do pray that You'd bless our time of prayer. We thank You for the privilege.

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:29.280
I pray that You would move mightily and we'll thank You for it. In Christ's name we pray. Amen.
