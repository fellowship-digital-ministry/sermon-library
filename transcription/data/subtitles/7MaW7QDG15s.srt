1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,779
in John chapter number six.

2
00:00:01,779 --> 00:00:03,819
I put these words up here

3
00:00:03,819 --> 00:00:05,460
and I hope that they would be a blessing to you

4
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,219
and a challenge to us.

5
00:00:07,219 --> 00:00:09,260
And I'm gonna just stand to the side here

6
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:10,659
and look at them with you.

7
00:00:10,659 --> 00:00:13,659
And I've titled the message Living for Jesus tonight.

8
00:00:13,659 --> 00:00:15,840
We sing the song Living for Jesus

9
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:20,100
and I've highlighted from this hymn some words

10
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,100
that I hope would be an encouragement to us

11
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,739
and that we would be challenged this evening

12
00:00:24,739 --> 00:00:25,979
as we open the scriptures,

13
00:00:25,979 --> 00:00:27,459
but also as we think about this song,

14
00:00:27,459 --> 00:00:30,940
living for Jesus, a life that is true.

15
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,779
Notice it says, striving to please him.

16
00:00:33,779 --> 00:00:38,779
Notice what I highlighted in all that I do.

17
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,340
Not in most things that I do,

18
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,139
not in the sacred things that I do.

19
00:00:44,139 --> 00:00:46,779
Sometimes if we're not careful in our minds,

20
00:00:46,779 --> 00:00:49,819
we will put some categories in our life

21
00:00:49,819 --> 00:00:51,900
of sacred and secular,

22
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:55,900
but the reality is that we are saved by the grace of God

23
00:00:55,939 --> 00:00:58,700
and everything about us is to be lived

24
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,659
for the glory and honor of the Lord.

25
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:03,779
Whether therefore you eat or drink

26
00:01:03,779 --> 00:01:06,699
or whatsoever you do,

27
00:01:06,699 --> 00:01:10,180
do all to the glory of God.

28
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:13,260
I had a very wise Bible professor in Bible college

29
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,239
that said, all means all and that's all that all means.

30
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:18,919
Now we can laugh at that little ditty,

31
00:01:18,919 --> 00:01:22,139
but the reality is that we see that the songwriter said,

32
00:01:22,139 --> 00:01:26,580
in all that I do, yielding allegiance,

33
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,900
glad-hearted and free.

34
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,459
Notice what the songwriter said,

35
00:01:30,459 --> 00:01:35,459
this is the pathway of blessing for me.

36
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:41,260
Not this is a pathway, but this is the,

37
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,540
I understand it's not inspired Bible,

38
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:46,180
but I believe that there's biblical truth

39
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:49,900
that underlines and supports what the songwriter is saying.

40
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,019
This is the blessing,

41
00:01:51,019 --> 00:01:53,099
this is the pathway of blessing for me.

42
00:01:53,099 --> 00:01:53,940
Why do we say that?

43
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:57,019
Well, God in his word blesses obedience.

44
00:01:57,019 --> 00:01:58,139
Does he not?

45
00:01:58,139 --> 00:02:02,019
It's a Bible principle from Genesis to Revelation

46
00:02:02,019 --> 00:02:05,260
that God blesses obedience.

47
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:06,839
We want God's blessing,

48
00:02:06,839 --> 00:02:09,619
but God's blessing comes as we obey him.

49
00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:10,460
Notice what it says,

50
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,139
living for Jesus, notice this,

51
00:02:12,139 --> 00:02:15,419
who died in my place.

52
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:17,300
You know, sometimes I think we,

53
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,619
it's not that we forget it,

54
00:02:18,619 --> 00:02:21,100
we just don't live mindfully of the truth

55
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,779
that it was my cross,

56
00:02:22,779 --> 00:02:24,020
that I deserve to die,

57
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,460
that it was for, as it says,

58
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:30,460
bearing on Calvary, my sin and disgrace.

59
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,979
It was my sin, it was your sin.

60
00:02:32,979 --> 00:02:33,820
Notice what it says,

61
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:38,820
such love constrains me to answer his call,

62
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:43,419
follow his leading and give him,

63
00:02:43,419 --> 00:02:45,660
notice again, my all.

64
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:49,179
Not just give him some,

65
00:02:49,179 --> 00:02:50,779
but give him my all.

66
00:02:50,779 --> 00:02:53,940
All for Jesus, I surrender,

67
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,460
and I surrender what?

68
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,380
I surrender all.

69
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,940
Notice living for Jesus,

70
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,539
notice this, wherever I am.

71
00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:03,419
Again, sometimes if we're not careful,

72
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:06,580
we'll make that distinction between

73
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,580
in our mind secular and sacred,

74
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,020
but it's all sacred.

75
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,100
I belong to the Lord,

76
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,300
and so living for Jesus,

77
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,820
wherever I am,

78
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:17,820
doing each duty in his holy name.

79
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:18,699
And why?

80
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,300
Because whatsoever thy hand finds to do,

81
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,860
do it heartily as unto the Lord.

82
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,339
It's what the Bible tells us to do.

83
00:03:24,339 --> 00:03:25,779
And so each duty, say,

84
00:03:25,779 --> 00:03:30,259
well, this isn't as visible as some other task,

85
00:03:30,259 --> 00:03:33,259
and no one's gonna know we're doing it for God.

86
00:03:33,259 --> 00:03:34,699
You know, if you ever study the temple,

87
00:03:34,699 --> 00:03:37,660
there were chapters and pillars that were made,

88
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:40,380
and there was lily work on the top.

89
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,380
It's a great message.

90
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,940
I'm not gonna preach it this evening,

91
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,740
but something interesting about the lily work,

92
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,179
you know who would see it?

93
00:03:46,179 --> 00:03:47,899
God.

94
00:03:47,899 --> 00:03:48,899
God.

95
00:03:48,899 --> 00:03:49,940
That's it.

96
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,740
God would see it.

97
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:56,740
Notice willing to suffer affliction and loss.

98
00:03:57,059 --> 00:03:59,220
Wonder how willing we are.

99
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:02,899
We're thankful that he suffered greatly.

100
00:04:04,339 --> 00:04:06,300
Are we willing to suffer affliction and loss,

101
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,380
deeming, notice what it says,

102
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,020
each trial a part of my cross.

103
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,660
Living for Jesus through life's,

104
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:15,419
or earth's, notice what it says, little while.

105
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:19,459
You know, this life is just, it's just a vapor.

106
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,980
Appears for a little time and then vanisheth away.

107
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,179
And the songwriter said,

108
00:04:24,179 --> 00:04:27,200
living for Jesus through earth's little while.

109
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,339
You know, the reality is I don't know how long I have.

110
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:31,619
You don't know how long you have.

111
00:04:31,619 --> 00:04:33,100
There are people that think,

112
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,700
doctors have said, whatever the diagnosis is,

113
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,540
that they have certain amount of time to live,

114
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,739
but as is appointed unto man,

115
00:04:39,739 --> 00:04:41,859
wants to die and after this, the judgment.

116
00:04:41,859 --> 00:04:43,920
And we know that our time here on earth

117
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,859
is just a little while.

118
00:04:45,859 --> 00:04:47,559
Notice what this line says.

119
00:04:47,559 --> 00:04:49,059
I highlight the whole line.

120
00:04:49,059 --> 00:04:54,059
My dearest treasure, the light of his smile.

121
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,279
The greatest thing that I'm living for

122
00:04:59,339 --> 00:05:01,619
is God to be pleased with my life.

123
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,420
The light of his smile.

124
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,700
That's my dearest treasure.

125
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,420
You talk to people today,

126
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,220
you go around and you do a survey

127
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,859
and you ask people, what's your dearest treasure?

128
00:05:10,859 --> 00:05:12,959
What's the most prized possession that you have?

129
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:15,179
What is the thing that you're working so hard for?

130
00:05:15,179 --> 00:05:17,899
What is that most desired treasure?

131
00:05:17,899 --> 00:05:18,820
And the songwriter said,

132
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:22,619
my dearest treasure is the light of his smile.

133
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:27,140
Seeking the lost ones he died to redeem,

134
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:30,660
bringing the weary to find rest in him.

135
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,179
The chorus says, oh Jesus, Lord and Savior,

136
00:05:33,179 --> 00:05:35,179
I give myself to thee.

137
00:05:36,019 --> 00:05:41,019
For thou and thy atonement didst give thyself for me.

138
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,980
Notice what it says, I own no other master.

139
00:05:46,899 --> 00:05:48,220
I'm not my own master.

140
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,839
I don't wanna be my own master.

141
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,540
I don't want anyone else to be my master.

142
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,299
He's a good master.

143
00:05:54,299 --> 00:05:56,579
He's my savior, he's my Lord.

144
00:05:56,579 --> 00:05:57,779
I own no other master.

145
00:05:57,779 --> 00:06:02,540
My heart shall be thy throne.

146
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,940
You know, that's a decision that we have to make

147
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,220
every single day of our lives,

148
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:09,179
and sometimes multiple times in the day of our lives.

149
00:06:09,179 --> 00:06:10,019
Why?

150
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:12,019
Because you know who wants to be the,

151
00:06:12,019 --> 00:06:14,239
sit on the throne of your life?

152
00:06:14,239 --> 00:06:16,279
You and me.

153
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,940
I wanna sit on the throne of my life.

154
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,140
You wanna sit on the throne of your life.

155
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:21,980
Oh, not me, pastor.

156
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,339
Don't deceive yourself.

157
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,459
The worst deception is self-deception.

158
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:30,059
This evening, my heart shall be thy throne.

159
00:06:30,059 --> 00:06:34,820
My life I give henceforth to live,

160
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:38,980
O Christ, for thee alone.

161
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,059
As we look at this, words of these songs,

162
00:06:42,059 --> 00:06:44,299
and think about the message that I'm gonna preach tonight,

163
00:06:44,299 --> 00:06:47,380
living for Jesus, in John chapter number six,

164
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:50,779
reminded that last week we had the opportunity

165
00:06:50,779 --> 00:06:54,619
on Sunday evening to look at a single verse of scripture

166
00:06:54,619 --> 00:06:56,500
in the book of Hebrews in the 11th chapter.

167
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,619
In Hebrews chapter 11, we considered the testimony of Enoch

168
00:07:00,179 --> 00:07:01,899
and the importance of pleasing the Lord with my life.

169
00:07:01,899 --> 00:07:04,339
I said this as we looked at that text of scripture,

170
00:07:04,339 --> 00:07:06,859
just again, one verse of scripture,

171
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:09,140
that he, Enoch, had this testimony.

172
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:09,980
What was it?

173
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,820
He pleased God.

174
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,399
What a great testimony.

175
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:16,660
The thought of that challenge, honestly,

176
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,779
has continued to be on my mind.

177
00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:21,420
Something that I just couldn't kinda get away from

178
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,260
and shake loose.

179
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,420
Something that's just been permeating my mind.

180
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,779
And this evening, many of you would know

181
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,399
you've received cards and correspondence from me

182
00:07:30,179 --> 00:07:32,440
if I send you an email, if I send you a card,

183
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,839
if I write out a card for you,

184
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:35,559
you'll see that in that card,

185
00:07:35,559 --> 00:07:39,200
I will write down this verse, 2 Corinthians 5,

186
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,839
and verse number 15.

187
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:43,600
It's if I could call it a life verse.

188
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,959
It is a life verse, and the Bible says there,

189
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:49,959
and that he died for all, that they which live

190
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:53,760
should not henceforth live unto themselves,

191
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:58,440
but unto him which died for them and rose again.

192
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,959
This past Christmas, Brianna made each of us

193
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:05,519
some mugs for Christmas, and this mug has that verse on it,

194
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:07,799
and she wrote that out, and I set this,

195
00:08:07,799 --> 00:08:09,399
I don't use this to drink coffee

196
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:10,540
or any other hot drink from.

197
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:13,359
I have it in my office in a place where I can see it

198
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:16,799
each day as a daily reminder of this verse

199
00:08:16,799 --> 00:08:18,079
that is my life verse.

200
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:19,859
It's sitting on a shelf in my office,

201
00:08:19,859 --> 00:08:22,079
and each day when I walk to my office

202
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:24,119
and I walk over to where my chair is,

203
00:08:24,119 --> 00:08:27,779
I see that mug and I'm reminded of that verse of scripture.

204
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:30,140
Miss Mady has been making some things

205
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:33,580
with her new business, and she has given me some materials,

206
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:36,020
a polo shirt, a sweatshirt.

207
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,659
As I have summarized this verse of scripture,

208
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:40,820
2 Corinthians 5, and verse number 15,

209
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,700
I've summarized it this way so that it would fit on a polo.

210
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:47,619
Living for him who died for me.

211
00:08:47,619 --> 00:08:50,900
Living for him who died for me.

212
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:55,900
I wonder, as I, and this evening as we evaluate our lives,

213
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:01,820
I wonder if we can truly say that we're living for Jesus.

214
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,900
Do the decisions that I, do the decisions that you make

215
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:08,099
on a daily basis, the decisions that we make

216
00:09:08,099 --> 00:09:11,219
with our resources, our time,

217
00:09:11,219 --> 00:09:14,659
decisions that we make on how we use our time,

218
00:09:14,659 --> 00:09:16,820
how are we managing our time,

219
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:20,739
what kind of steward am I of the time that God has given me

220
00:09:20,739 --> 00:09:24,659
as I have the opportunity to use the resource

221
00:09:24,659 --> 00:09:26,979
that God has given me of my talents

222
00:09:26,979 --> 00:09:30,020
as I would be a steward of the talents

223
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:33,940
that God has given me as I would use the resources,

224
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,099
being a steward of the treasures

225
00:09:36,099 --> 00:09:38,340
that God has entrusted me with.

226
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,219
I wonder this evening if my decisions

227
00:09:41,219 --> 00:09:44,859
with regard to the resources that God has entrusted me with,

228
00:09:44,859 --> 00:09:49,859
if those decisions truly reveal that I am living for Jesus.

229
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,140
I wonder this evening if we were to take

230
00:09:53,979 --> 00:09:56,700
and truly evaluate our lives with that humility

231
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,419
and that honesty, could we say,

232
00:09:59,419 --> 00:10:01,419
I'm living for Jesus.

233
00:10:01,419 --> 00:10:03,419
I'm living for Jesus.

234
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:06,419
In our text of Scripture here in John chapter number 6,

235
00:10:06,419 --> 00:10:08,419
and I'm going to jump into the end of the passage.

236
00:10:08,419 --> 00:10:11,419
I'll make some reference to the beginning portions of the passage

237
00:10:11,419 --> 00:10:13,419
as we get through the message this evening.

238
00:10:13,419 --> 00:10:17,419
But I want you to jump in right there with me in verse number 66.

239
00:10:17,419 --> 00:10:21,419
The Bible says this in John chapter 6 and verse number 66,

240
00:10:22,419 --> 00:10:28,419
From that time many of his, that's Jesus,

241
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:35,419
many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him.

242
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:38,419
Verse 67,

243
00:10:38,419 --> 00:10:43,419
Peter said, Jesus unto the twelve, his twelve disciples, he says this,

244
00:10:43,419 --> 00:10:48,419
Will ye also go away?

245
00:10:48,419 --> 00:10:54,419
Peter's the one that so quickly, so often answers the questions that Jesus asks.

246
00:10:54,419 --> 00:10:59,419
At times Peter answers and it's almost as if he puts his foot in his mouth.

247
00:10:59,419 --> 00:11:00,419
You've ever been there in your life?

248
00:11:00,419 --> 00:11:05,419
You say something like, man, what did I mean by that and why did I say that?

249
00:11:05,419 --> 00:11:08,419
This isn't one of those times.

250
00:11:08,419 --> 00:11:11,419
In Matthew 16, it's not one of those times when he says,

251
00:11:11,419 --> 00:11:13,419
Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.

252
00:11:13,419 --> 00:11:17,419
Here he gives an answer, a response to this question when Jesus says,

253
00:11:17,419 --> 00:11:19,419
Will ye also go away?

254
00:11:19,419 --> 00:11:21,419
And Peter stands and he gives an answer.

255
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:26,419
Notice what he says, Lord, to whom shall we go?

256
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:31,419
Thou hast the words of eternal life.

257
00:11:32,419 --> 00:11:38,419
And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ,

258
00:11:38,419 --> 00:11:41,419
the Son of the living God.

259
00:11:41,419 --> 00:11:45,419
Wow, what a declaration by Peter in verse 68 and 69.

260
00:11:45,419 --> 00:11:47,419
We'll look at that in just a moment.

261
00:11:47,419 --> 00:11:49,419
But as we're looking at this portion of Scripture,

262
00:11:49,419 --> 00:11:51,419
I've titled the message Living for Jesus.

263
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:56,419
If you're taking notes, number one, consider with me a disturbing trend.

264
00:11:56,419 --> 00:11:59,419
A disturbing trend that we see in verse number 66.

265
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:00,419
The Bible says many.

266
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:02,419
We do not know the number of these disciples

267
00:12:02,419 --> 00:12:04,419
that are referenced here in this portion of Scripture.

268
00:12:04,419 --> 00:12:08,419
We do know, however, that in the beginning of the passage of Scripture,

269
00:12:08,419 --> 00:12:11,419
in John chapter number 6, that God records for us

270
00:12:11,419 --> 00:12:13,419
and provides us with the record, the account,

271
00:12:13,419 --> 00:12:17,419
the miracle by which we refer to as the feeding of the 5,000.

272
00:12:17,419 --> 00:12:19,419
And we're aware and we understand this evening

273
00:12:19,419 --> 00:12:21,419
that when we look at the feeding of the 5,000,

274
00:12:21,419 --> 00:12:25,419
that the Bible tells us that that was the number of the men.

275
00:12:25,419 --> 00:12:28,419
And so we understand that as we look at that passage of Scripture,

276
00:12:28,419 --> 00:12:31,419
there's probably 15,000, 20,000 people

277
00:12:31,419 --> 00:12:34,419
that are there for the feeding of the 5,000 as we reference it

278
00:12:34,419 --> 00:12:39,419
because that is the number, the count of the men that is provided to us.

279
00:12:39,419 --> 00:12:42,419
We find that after the feeding and after that great miracle,

280
00:12:42,419 --> 00:12:45,419
that account that is recorded at the beginning of John chapter number 6,

281
00:12:45,419 --> 00:12:49,419
we find the Bible tells us that Jesus instructed the disciples

282
00:12:49,419 --> 00:12:52,419
to cross over the sea and they cross over

283
00:12:52,419 --> 00:12:56,419
and he's then walking on the sea at the rate shortly thereafter.

284
00:12:56,419 --> 00:12:59,419
And then as we get into the text and we find that in verse number 22,

285
00:12:59,419 --> 00:13:02,419
it's the day following and there are many people there

286
00:13:02,419 --> 00:13:05,419
and they're kind of perplexed as to how Jesus got to where he is

287
00:13:05,419 --> 00:13:09,419
and all that's taken place because they know that they sent,

288
00:13:09,419 --> 00:13:13,419
as they went across, they heard Jesus go, send the disciples

289
00:13:13,419 --> 00:13:16,419
and Jesus didn't get into one of the boats, into the ship.

290
00:13:16,419 --> 00:13:19,419
And so they were kind of perplexed as to how he got there and what was going on.

291
00:13:19,419 --> 00:13:24,419
And the Bible tells us in verse number 25, notice actually verse 24,

292
00:13:24,419 --> 00:13:28,419
the Bible says, when the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there,

293
00:13:28,419 --> 00:13:32,419
neither his disciples, they also took shipping and came to Capernaum

294
00:13:32,419 --> 00:13:35,419
seeking for Jesus.

295
00:13:35,419 --> 00:13:37,419
When they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him,

296
00:13:37,419 --> 00:13:39,419
Rabbi, when camest thou hither?

297
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:42,419
And of course, I mentioned already that in the previous portion,

298
00:13:42,419 --> 00:13:45,419
he's walking on the water and they find Jesus.

299
00:13:45,419 --> 00:13:47,419
They were seeking for him in verse number 24.

300
00:13:47,419 --> 00:13:50,419
So we do not know the number here in verse 66,

301
00:13:50,419 --> 00:13:53,419
but we see this disturbing trend where the Bible says

302
00:13:53,419 --> 00:13:58,419
that many, many of his disciples, notice where it says went back.

303
00:13:58,419 --> 00:14:00,419
Went back.

304
00:14:00,419 --> 00:14:02,419
Went back to what?

305
00:14:02,419 --> 00:14:05,419
Their own lives.

306
00:14:05,419 --> 00:14:08,419
They went back to their old ways.

307
00:14:08,419 --> 00:14:10,419
They went back to whatever they knew.

308
00:14:10,419 --> 00:14:12,419
They went back.

309
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:18,419
And the Bible says that they walked no more with him.

310
00:14:18,419 --> 00:14:21,419
They walked no more with him.

311
00:14:21,419 --> 00:14:24,419
That's a disturbing trend.

312
00:14:24,419 --> 00:14:28,419
I don't know about you, but when I read John 6 and verse 66,

313
00:14:28,419 --> 00:14:31,419
it breaks my heart.

314
00:14:31,419 --> 00:14:34,419
And we see here what's taking place in this trend,

315
00:14:34,419 --> 00:14:38,419
and we find, remember, Paul says this in 2 Timothy 4 and verse number 10

316
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,419
about Demas.

317
00:14:40,419 --> 00:14:45,419
He hath forsaken me. Why? Having loved this present world.

318
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:49,419
And we look at this passage of Scripture and we see this reference here,

319
00:14:49,419 --> 00:14:52,419
and we find that right after the feeding,

320
00:14:52,419 --> 00:14:55,419
that the Bible tells us in verse number 25 that they found him.

321
00:14:55,419 --> 00:14:57,419
They were seeking for him, according to verse 24.

322
00:14:57,419 --> 00:14:59,419
They seek him and they find him.

323
00:14:59,419 --> 00:15:01,419
And notice what Jesus says in verse 26.

324
00:15:01,419 --> 00:15:03,419
Jesus answered them and said,

325
00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:06,419
Verily, verily, I say unto you, ye seek me, notice,

326
00:15:06,419 --> 00:15:08,419
not because ye saw the miracles,

327
00:15:08,419 --> 00:15:12,419
but because ye did eat of the loaves and were filled.

328
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:14,419
There was a reason that they were seeking Jesus,

329
00:15:14,419 --> 00:15:16,419
but it wasn't the proper reason.

330
00:15:16,419 --> 00:15:18,419
We find that he says that you sought me

331
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:21,419
because, not because of the miracles,

332
00:15:21,419 --> 00:15:23,419
but because of the loaves and you were filled.

333
00:15:23,419 --> 00:15:26,419
You received this sustenance, you received this food,

334
00:15:26,419 --> 00:15:28,419
and so that's why you're seeking me.

335
00:15:28,419 --> 00:15:30,419
As you go through the chapter, and again,

336
00:15:30,419 --> 00:15:32,419
we don't have time to develop all of it this evening,

337
00:15:32,419 --> 00:15:34,419
but you find that Jesus is preaching the gospel,

338
00:15:34,419 --> 00:15:39,419
and Jesus is preaching the importance of personal faith in the Lord Jesus Christ,

339
00:15:39,419 --> 00:15:42,419
and then after preaching about the personal faith

340
00:15:42,419 --> 00:15:44,419
that is required in the Lord Jesus Christ,

341
00:15:44,419 --> 00:15:46,419
he tells them in verse 63,

342
00:15:46,419 --> 00:15:49,419
It is the spirit that quickeneth, the flesh profiteth nothing.

343
00:15:49,419 --> 00:15:52,419
The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit and they are life.

344
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:55,419
And the Bible says that there are some of you that believe not.

345
00:15:55,419 --> 00:15:58,419
Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not,

346
00:15:58,419 --> 00:16:01,419
who should betray him, and it says in verse 66,

347
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:05,419
From that time when Jesus was preaching and giving the truth,

348
00:16:05,419 --> 00:16:09,419
from that time many of his disciples went back

349
00:16:09,419 --> 00:16:13,419
and walked no more with him.

350
00:16:13,419 --> 00:16:15,419
I want to make this statement.

351
00:16:15,419 --> 00:16:18,419
I hope that you would understand it this evening.

352
00:16:18,419 --> 00:16:25,419
Not all who seek Jesus are interested in living for Jesus.

353
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:32,419
Not all who seek Jesus are truly interested in living for Jesus.

354
00:16:32,419 --> 00:16:35,419
I want to remind you of what Jesus said in Mark chapter number 8,

355
00:16:35,419 --> 00:16:38,419
a passage that many of us would be familiar with,

356
00:16:38,419 --> 00:16:41,419
but take a moment to turn there in Mark chapter number 8,

357
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:45,419
and we see that Jesus is speaking about these that would follow him,

358
00:16:45,419 --> 00:16:48,419
that would take up their cross and follow him,

359
00:16:48,419 --> 00:16:51,419
and we find that here in this portion of scripture,

360
00:16:51,419 --> 00:16:56,419
we are confronted with the importance, yes, of following the Lord Jesus Christ,

361
00:16:56,419 --> 00:17:00,419
but you understand that we must be willing to bear that price

362
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:03,419
and to pay whatever that cost might be.

363
00:17:03,419 --> 00:17:05,419
Notice in verse 34, the Bible says this,

364
00:17:05,419 --> 00:17:08,419
And when he had called the people unto him with his disciples,

365
00:17:08,419 --> 00:17:09,419
also he said unto them,

366
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:14,419
Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself,

367
00:17:14,419 --> 00:17:17,419
and take up his cross, and follow me.

368
00:17:17,419 --> 00:17:19,419
I believe that following the Lord and living for Jesus

369
00:17:19,419 --> 00:17:22,419
could be used synonymously this evening,

370
00:17:22,419 --> 00:17:24,419
and we think about this truth of following him,

371
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:27,419
and I've thought this often as I've read this portion of scripture,

372
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:30,419
that many of God's people will not follow him

373
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:36,419
because we will not deny ourselves and take up our cross.

374
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:40,419
You know, there's some believers today that are trying to follow Jesus,

375
00:17:40,419 --> 00:17:42,419
but they've not first denied themselves.

376
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:44,419
And there's a conflict there.

377
00:17:44,419 --> 00:17:47,419
You can't serve two masters, the Bible tells us that,

378
00:17:47,419 --> 00:17:49,419
and if you've not denied yourself,

379
00:17:49,419 --> 00:17:51,419
who wants to be the king of your life is you.

380
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:54,419
Who wants to be the king of my life is me.

381
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:59,419
And if I don't deny myself, but yet I'm trying to follow Jesus,

382
00:17:59,419 --> 00:18:01,419
I have conflict.

383
00:18:01,419 --> 00:18:05,419
And in that conflict, we find that we can grow weary,

384
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:08,419
and we can get overwhelmed, and we can get discouraged,

385
00:18:08,419 --> 00:18:11,419
and we find that the Bible says that we're to deny ourselves,

386
00:18:11,419 --> 00:18:13,419
take up his cross, and follow him,

387
00:18:13,419 --> 00:18:15,419
for whosoever will save his life shall lose it,

388
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:19,419
but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's,

389
00:18:19,419 --> 00:18:22,419
the same shall save it.

390
00:18:22,419 --> 00:18:24,419
It's a paradox.

391
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:25,419
We find in verse 36,

392
00:18:25,419 --> 00:18:28,419
For what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world

393
00:18:28,419 --> 00:18:31,419
and lose his own soul?

394
00:18:31,419 --> 00:18:34,419
What shall a man give in exchange for his soul?

395
00:18:34,419 --> 00:18:37,419
Jesus, therefore, shall be ashamed of me and of my words,

396
00:18:37,419 --> 00:18:40,419
and this adulterous and sinful generation of him also,

397
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:42,419
shall the Son of Man be ashamed when he cometh

398
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:47,419
in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.

399
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:53,419
Again, not all who seek Jesus are truly interested in living for Jesus.

400
00:18:53,419 --> 00:18:56,419
If we're not careful this evening, the truth of verse 66,

401
00:18:56,419 --> 00:19:01,419
this disturbing trend that we see, and no doubt we know some,

402
00:19:01,419 --> 00:19:04,419
maybe we could say even as the text says that we know many

403
00:19:04,419 --> 00:19:07,419
that no longer walk with Jesus.

404
00:19:07,419 --> 00:19:10,419
And if we're not careful, the many that desert,

405
00:19:10,419 --> 00:19:14,419
the many that depart, this disturbing trend can influence us,

406
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:16,419
those that desire to follow Jesus.

407
00:19:16,419 --> 00:19:18,419
We can get discouraged.

408
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:21,419
We can get our eyes on where is so-and-so and what happened to so-and-so,

409
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:23,419
and I used to know about this person, what about that person?

410
00:19:23,419 --> 00:19:27,419
And the reality is that Jesus says, keep your eyes on me.

411
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:29,419
I shared that testimony at the start of the service this evening.

412
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:33,419
I knew I was preaching this message, and I was so encouraged by that missionary

413
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:38,419
that 20 years has passed since I've last seen him, and he's still serving God.

414
00:19:38,419 --> 00:19:40,419
That's a blessing.

415
00:19:40,419 --> 00:19:47,419
You know how many fellow students I went to Bible college with?

416
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:49,419
Not even in church today.

417
00:19:49,419 --> 00:19:51,419
Sad.

418
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:52,419
But I can't get my eyes on that.

419
00:19:52,419 --> 00:19:55,419
I can't get distracted by that.

420
00:19:55,419 --> 00:19:59,419
And if we're not careful, when many...

421
00:19:59,419 --> 00:20:04,099
When many go back and walk no more with him,

422
00:20:04,099 --> 00:20:05,779
it can impact us.

423
00:20:05,779 --> 00:20:06,879
It's a disturbing trend.

424
00:20:06,879 --> 00:20:08,299
Number two, if you're taking notes,

425
00:20:08,299 --> 00:20:10,619
I want you to see a direct question.

426
00:20:10,619 --> 00:20:13,499
Jesus then focuses his attention in verse 67

427
00:20:13,499 --> 00:20:15,819
back in John chapter number six to the 12,

428
00:20:15,819 --> 00:20:19,099
to his disciples, and notice it's a very direct question.

429
00:20:19,099 --> 00:20:21,679
I'm thankful I would also refer to this question

430
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,499
as being a piercing question.

431
00:20:23,499 --> 00:20:26,299
And questions that deserve answers,

432
00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:28,659
questions that are soul-searching questions,

433
00:20:28,659 --> 00:20:31,139
questions that just hit us straight on.

434
00:20:31,139 --> 00:20:33,739
And the Lord Jesus Christ, God in flesh,

435
00:20:33,739 --> 00:20:35,659
he looks at those 12 disciples.

436
00:20:35,659 --> 00:20:37,419
Now, in your mind, put yourself here

437
00:20:37,419 --> 00:20:39,039
in John chapter number six.

438
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,859
They've seen this great miracle.

439
00:20:40,859 --> 00:20:43,099
They, of course, they were going across the sea.

440
00:20:43,099 --> 00:20:45,939
Jesus comes, they see all these people come.

441
00:20:45,939 --> 00:20:48,579
They're seeking him because they wanna get some more food.

442
00:20:48,579 --> 00:20:50,979
And we find that Jesus is preaching.

443
00:20:50,979 --> 00:20:52,639
And then they see all of these people.

444
00:20:52,639 --> 00:20:55,179
I don't know the number, but many went back

445
00:20:55,179 --> 00:20:56,899
and walked with him no more.

446
00:20:56,939 --> 00:20:59,619
And as they go back and as they leave,

447
00:20:59,619 --> 00:21:02,859
and perhaps even as they're still walking away,

448
00:21:02,859 --> 00:21:04,899
Jesus looks to the disciples

449
00:21:04,899 --> 00:21:06,679
and he fixes his attention on them.

450
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:11,679
And he says this, will ye also go away?

451
00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:14,419
It's a very direct question.

452
00:21:16,639 --> 00:21:19,399
Direct questions require direct responses.

453
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:22,899
You ever have somebody give you an answer

454
00:21:22,899 --> 00:21:25,619
and they're just beating around the bush?

455
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:27,179
Say, come on, man, shoot straight with me.

456
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:29,739
Just tell me what, you ever feel that way?

457
00:21:29,739 --> 00:21:32,179
Salesmen, they're good at beating around the bush, right?

458
00:21:32,179 --> 00:21:34,499
And I'm not trying to categorize

459
00:21:34,499 --> 00:21:36,659
all salesmen in that statement.

460
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:38,339
So I should say it this way.

461
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:41,499
Many salesmen that I have interacted with in my life

462
00:21:41,499 --> 00:21:43,459
are very good at beating around the bush.

463
00:21:43,459 --> 00:21:44,819
They don't answer direct questions.

464
00:21:44,819 --> 00:21:46,459
You can ask somebody a very direct question

465
00:21:46,459 --> 00:21:50,299
and they just kinda circle the camp, so to speak,

466
00:21:50,299 --> 00:21:53,699
and they never give you a direct answer.

467
00:21:53,699 --> 00:21:56,219
I'm sure, Brother Mark, all those years in law enforcement,

468
00:21:56,219 --> 00:21:58,719
you had a lot of people that you asked direct questions to

469
00:21:58,719 --> 00:22:01,719
that did not provide direct answers.

470
00:22:01,719 --> 00:22:05,539
And we find that Jesus, God in flesh,

471
00:22:05,539 --> 00:22:06,939
can you imagine these disciples,

472
00:22:06,939 --> 00:22:08,139
all that they've just seen,

473
00:22:08,139 --> 00:22:09,499
all that they've just witnessed,

474
00:22:09,499 --> 00:22:10,539
and they see these people,

475
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:13,139
perhaps they can still see the backs of these people

476
00:22:13,139 --> 00:22:15,519
leaving and departing from Jesus,

477
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:20,519
and Jesus says to them, will ye also go away?

478
00:22:21,779 --> 00:22:23,539
It's a piercing question.

479
00:22:24,379 --> 00:22:25,859
It's a soul-searching question.

480
00:22:26,659 --> 00:22:31,339
Peter, he stands and he gives an answer.

481
00:22:32,379 --> 00:22:33,939
If you're taking notes, number three,

482
00:22:33,939 --> 00:22:35,939
as we look at verses 68 and 69,

483
00:22:35,939 --> 00:22:38,179
I would say it's a deliberate resolve.

484
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:40,919
Deliberate resolve.

485
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:45,919
Peter, look at the response that he says in verse 68.

486
00:22:46,539 --> 00:22:48,619
Notice just the first aspect of it.

487
00:22:48,619 --> 00:22:53,299
He says, Lord, to whom shall we go?

488
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:55,859
To whom shall we go?

489
00:22:58,139 --> 00:23:01,819
When you think about the response that Peter gives here,

490
00:23:01,819 --> 00:23:04,339
you think about all that Peter had witnessed

491
00:23:04,339 --> 00:23:07,279
as he's walked with the Lord Jesus Christ,

492
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:09,379
as he's going to give us further insight

493
00:23:09,379 --> 00:23:11,819
as to what he understood in the next,

494
00:23:11,819 --> 00:23:14,679
the end of verse 68 and the verse number 69,

495
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:17,419
we find it's very clear and very obvious

496
00:23:17,419 --> 00:23:20,659
as to why Peter would say, to whom shall we go?

497
00:23:21,659 --> 00:23:25,619
I ask you the question this evening, to whom shall we go?

498
00:23:25,619 --> 00:23:26,699
I mean, if we're gonna decide

499
00:23:26,699 --> 00:23:30,059
that we're not gonna live for Jesus, who are we living for?

500
00:23:30,059 --> 00:23:31,459
If we're gonna decide that we're not,

501
00:23:31,459 --> 00:23:33,219
and understand again this evening,

502
00:23:33,219 --> 00:23:34,619
we talk about living for Jesus.

503
00:23:34,619 --> 00:23:37,759
I spent the time to highlight those words in that song

504
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:41,099
to try to help us this evening to understand

505
00:23:41,099 --> 00:23:43,659
the importance of living for Jesus

506
00:23:43,659 --> 00:23:47,019
in every area of my life, in every moment of my life.

507
00:23:47,019 --> 00:23:49,379
And I'm all of his, listen, I'm thankful I got

508
00:23:49,379 --> 00:23:53,179
all of his salvation and I got all of him.

509
00:23:53,179 --> 00:23:55,499
But does he really have all of us?

510
00:23:55,499 --> 00:23:58,579
Some people that think that we need more of God,

511
00:23:58,579 --> 00:24:01,339
and I think I understand what they mean when they say that,

512
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:03,659
but the reality is that it's not so much

513
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:06,819
that we need more of God as much as God needs more of us.

514
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:08,939
At the moment of salvation,

515
00:24:08,939 --> 00:24:11,239
I got all the Holy Spirit I'm ever gonna have.

516
00:24:12,579 --> 00:24:15,279
I was indwelled with the Spirit of God and so were you.

517
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:16,879
But you know what, day by day,

518
00:24:16,879 --> 00:24:18,979
the Holy Spirit doesn't have all of me.

519
00:24:19,979 --> 00:24:21,739
And the Holy Spirit doesn't have all of you.

520
00:24:21,739 --> 00:24:24,939
There's some parts of us that we hold reserved,

521
00:24:24,939 --> 00:24:26,739
if you will, off limits.

522
00:24:26,739 --> 00:24:28,699
God, you can go here, but not here.

523
00:24:28,699 --> 00:24:30,779
And God, I'm willing to do this, but not this.

524
00:24:30,779 --> 00:24:33,219
And this is my life and this is what I wanna do.

525
00:24:33,219 --> 00:24:35,419
Hold on a minute, to whom shall we go?

526
00:24:37,179 --> 00:24:40,459
Why would I wanna, I understand that mentally

527
00:24:40,459 --> 00:24:42,579
sometimes we think that we know best

528
00:24:42,579 --> 00:24:44,299
and we should be the one to,

529
00:24:44,299 --> 00:24:47,059
but I don't really wanna be the king of my life.

530
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:48,899
Why?

531
00:24:48,899 --> 00:24:50,959
Because I know the king of kings.

532
00:24:50,959 --> 00:24:52,419
Before I knew the king of kings,

533
00:24:52,419 --> 00:24:54,899
you know I wanted to be the king of my life.

534
00:24:54,899 --> 00:24:57,619
Before I trusted Christ and got born again,

535
00:24:57,619 --> 00:24:59,819
the reality is that I wanted to be the king of my life.

536
00:24:59,819 --> 00:25:00,819
What do I wanna do?

537
00:25:00,819 --> 00:25:02,019
What are my ambitions?

538
00:25:02,019 --> 00:25:03,139
What are my goals?

539
00:25:03,139 --> 00:25:06,059
But after I'm saved, after I understand salvation

540
00:25:06,059 --> 00:25:07,899
and redemption through the blood of Christ,

541
00:25:07,899 --> 00:25:10,939
I come to this place, whom shall we go?

542
00:25:10,939 --> 00:25:12,139
To whom shall we go?

543
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:14,379
Notice what he says.

544
00:25:15,379 --> 00:25:19,779
He reveals to us at the end of verse 68 what Christ had.

545
00:25:19,779 --> 00:25:24,779
He says, for thou hast the words of eternal life.

546
00:25:25,779 --> 00:25:27,539
Aren't you thankful for God's word?

547
00:25:28,539 --> 00:25:32,539
I'm so thankful that as we refer to God's word

548
00:25:32,539 --> 00:25:36,899
as its completeness, that it's filled with God's words.

549
00:25:36,899 --> 00:25:40,139
And I'm thankful that the words that he has given us

550
00:25:40,139 --> 00:25:43,779
in this book, the Bible, are precious words,

551
00:25:44,219 --> 00:25:45,139
are profitable words.

552
00:25:45,139 --> 00:25:47,979
They're words that give us direction in our lives,

553
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:51,219
that help us to understand the truth

554
00:25:51,219 --> 00:25:54,579
and to help us to guide and to lead

555
00:25:54,579 --> 00:25:57,699
so that we could live a life that is pleasing to him.

556
00:25:57,699 --> 00:25:59,659
So that as the songwriter said,

557
00:25:59,659 --> 00:26:02,179
my dearest treasure is what?

558
00:26:02,179 --> 00:26:04,419
The light of his smile.

559
00:26:04,419 --> 00:26:05,559
How can I have that?

560
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:09,499
How can I have the testimony of Enoch that he pleased God?

561
00:26:09,499 --> 00:26:14,259
Well, because thou hast the words of eternal life.

562
00:26:14,259 --> 00:26:18,299
And I'm thankful that the one who is the living word

563
00:26:18,299 --> 00:26:20,299
gave us the written word.

564
00:26:20,299 --> 00:26:22,299
And as he gave us the written word

565
00:26:22,299 --> 00:26:25,139
and we see the truth of inspiration and revelation

566
00:26:25,139 --> 00:26:27,019
and we understand this evening

567
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:29,419
the importance of preservation,

568
00:26:29,419 --> 00:26:32,719
that we have the word of God.

569
00:26:32,719 --> 00:26:33,759
What a blessing.

570
00:26:34,619 --> 00:26:39,379
Thou hast the words of eternal life.

571
00:26:40,499 --> 00:26:43,939
Did you hear what that philosopher said?

572
00:26:43,939 --> 00:26:46,379
Did you hear what that historian said?

573
00:26:46,379 --> 00:26:49,019
Did you hear what that theologian said?

574
00:26:49,019 --> 00:26:53,859
Thou hast the words of eternal life.

575
00:26:53,859 --> 00:26:55,259
Amen?

576
00:26:55,259 --> 00:26:59,859
This evening, Peter says, Lord, to whom shall we go?

577
00:27:00,939 --> 00:27:02,819
There's some that maybe are following over here

578
00:27:02,819 --> 00:27:03,839
and maybe they're going back.

579
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:05,999
I don't know where all of those that went away

580
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:08,939
and turned back, who they went to and what they were doing.

581
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:11,859
But Peter says, no, we're not going away.

582
00:27:11,859 --> 00:27:12,779
Where are we gonna go?

583
00:27:12,779 --> 00:27:15,219
You Lord have the words of eternal life.

584
00:27:15,219 --> 00:27:17,739
Number two, he tells us not only what Christ had

585
00:27:17,739 --> 00:27:19,219
but he tells us who Christ is.

586
00:27:19,219 --> 00:27:23,539
He tells us in verse 69, and we believe and are sure

587
00:27:24,579 --> 00:27:29,579
that thou art that Christ, the son of the living God.

588
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,499
Wow, what a declaration that Peter makes in verse 69.

589
00:27:34,499 --> 00:27:37,339
And we find that as Peter would make this declaration,

590
00:27:37,339 --> 00:27:41,139
notice what he says, we believe and are sure.

591
00:27:41,139 --> 00:27:44,419
Listen, it's important for us to believe who God is.

592
00:27:44,419 --> 00:27:47,099
It's important for us to have confidence

593
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:49,059
in knowing who he is.

594
00:27:49,059 --> 00:27:52,219
This conviction and this confidence of Peter

595
00:27:52,219 --> 00:27:53,379
that is revealed here.

596
00:27:53,379 --> 00:27:56,379
This is what keeps Peter focused on the Lord.

597
00:27:56,379 --> 00:27:59,779
You say, but Peter, he had some problems later in his life.

598
00:27:59,779 --> 00:28:00,999
I understand.

599
00:28:02,059 --> 00:28:06,459
But you know, if you read the book of 1 and 2 Peter,

600
00:28:06,459 --> 00:28:08,899
he's a man that lived for Jesus.

601
00:28:08,899 --> 00:28:11,699
I'm thankful that John 20

602
00:28:11,699 --> 00:28:13,539
isn't the end of the story for Peter.

603
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:19,379
I'm happy that that's not the end of the story for Peter.

604
00:28:19,379 --> 00:28:21,339
Because Peter served Christ faithfully.

605
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:24,699
Was there a period in Peter's life

606
00:28:24,699 --> 00:28:26,579
where we'd say, man, it was a dark spot?

607
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:28,779
Sure, but if we'd evaluate all of our lives,

608
00:28:28,779 --> 00:28:30,859
there's some dark spots as well.

609
00:28:30,859 --> 00:28:32,059
I'm just thankful this evening

610
00:28:32,059 --> 00:28:33,979
that God didn't record my dark spots

611
00:28:33,979 --> 00:28:36,059
for all of people to see and read.

612
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:37,959
Aren't you?

613
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:40,739
Right, honestly.

614
00:28:40,739 --> 00:28:42,700
Can you imagine if your life or my life

615
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,299
was written in the Bible

616
00:28:44,299 --> 00:28:46,859
and all people for all times have the opportunity

617
00:28:46,859 --> 00:28:48,779
to read about your failures?

618
00:28:48,779 --> 00:28:50,339
About my failures?

619
00:28:50,339 --> 00:28:52,059
Thank God for his grace.

620
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,539
Peter's story doesn't end.

621
00:28:54,539 --> 00:28:57,979
His life doesn't end in John 19 and 20.

622
00:28:57,979 --> 00:28:59,619
You read 1 and 2 Peter

623
00:28:59,619 --> 00:29:02,959
and you see a man that lived for Jesus.

624
00:29:03,959 --> 00:29:08,119
This evening, I see his conviction and his confidence

625
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:09,919
when he says we believe and are sure.

626
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:11,479
We believe and are sure of what?

627
00:29:11,479 --> 00:29:15,359
That thou art that Christ.

628
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:18,000
Now understand with me that Jesus

629
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,320
is the one that asks the question.

630
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:23,479
Remember, we find back in verse number 67,

631
00:29:23,479 --> 00:29:27,880
then said Jesus under the 12, will you also go away?

632
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:31,519
Simon refers to Jesus as Lord in verse number 68.

633
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:33,279
By the way, he is Lord.

634
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,200
And then in verse 69, he says,

635
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,279
and we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ.

636
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,359
What's the significance of this?

637
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:45,039
Well, in verse number 67, it is Jesus who is speaking.

638
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:47,279
The name Jesus means God incarnate.

639
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:49,239
It means Jehovah is salvation.

640
00:29:49,239 --> 00:29:53,320
We understand who Jesus is as the man, right?

641
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,719
We understand that Jesus was born in a manger.

642
00:29:56,719 --> 00:29:57,880
He was born of a virgin.

643
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,039
We can read of his birth

644
00:29:59,039 --> 00:29:59,880
and we can.

645
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:04,200
look at his life, and we can see the man Jesus.

646
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,880
But you understand that when Peter says to Jesus

647
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:11,160
that thou art the Christ, that Christ,

648
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,620
the son of the living God,

649
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:14,960
the name Christ means the anointed one,

650
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,120
it means the Messiah, it means the son of God.

651
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,700
In this evening, what does Peter say?

652
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:27,200
That Jesus, the man, is God in flesh.

653
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,820
What a blessing.

654
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,640
And so Peter, having this understanding,

655
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:36,120
it's a deliberate resolve that he has

656
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,320
that he's looking at this, we sang this morning,

657
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,480
I am resolved no longer to linger,

658
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,440
you can look at all the words of that song,

659
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,800
and you can see the resolve of the songwriter,

660
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,040
and I wonder this evening,

661
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,800
when we look at this deliberate resolve,

662
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,480
yes, there are many that went, they turned away,

663
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,380
they went back, and they walked no more with Jesus,

664
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:55,900
but the question wasn't so much for those

665
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:59,960
as it was for these 12 disciples, will ye also go away?

666
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:05,060
Peter says, to whom shall we go?

667
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:08,180
To whom shall we go?

668
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:11,580
The song that they sang, Holly and Brown and Joseph,

669
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,180
just a few moments ago,

670
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,180
some of the words of that song talk about the blessings,

671
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:20,100
look what God has done.

672
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:25,420
Look what God has done, we see who he is.

673
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:26,860
Why don't you just for a moment think about

674
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:28,600
what he's done in your life?

675
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:32,980
The chorus of that song says, look what God has done,

676
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:36,060
I stand amazed and think of his love,

677
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:40,560
I don't deserve it, there's no way I could earn it.

678
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:45,340
Eternity, it's not long enough to thank God

679
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:48,280
for all he has done.

680
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:51,660
But think about this, the promise of eternal life,

681
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:54,700
the promise of eternal life,

682
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:58,660
because of Calvary, the peace that settled in my heart

683
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,420
since the day that he saved me.

684
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:02,440
Aren't you thankful for peace?

685
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:06,620
Listen, you can't buy peace, you can't earn peace,

686
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,120
it's God's peace.

687
00:32:10,139 --> 00:32:13,340
We have peace with God through the Lord Jesus Christ,

688
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:16,779
we have the peace of God which passeth all understanding.

689
00:32:16,779 --> 00:32:18,500
He answered prayers.

690
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,779
Isn't it exciting, Tim stood up here and said,

691
00:32:21,779 --> 00:32:23,740
God still answers prayer.

692
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:27,020
Listen, I love it when a young man, 16, almost 17 years old

693
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:29,580
knows that God answers prayer.

694
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,220
We serve a living God,

695
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,380
whoever liveth to make intercession for us,

696
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,139
he hears us when we pray,

697
00:32:36,139 --> 00:32:38,460
he's capable of doing exceeding abundantly

698
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:41,740
above all that we ask or think, and he answers prayer.

699
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:43,740
It says this, I've prayed for years,

700
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:46,460
never once has he failed me.

701
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:50,240
You cannot charge God with failing you.

702
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,919
Have we failed him?

703
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:55,360
More times than we'd like to admit.

704
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,040
More times than we'd like to admit.

705
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,600
But he's never failed me, he's never failed you,

706
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,200
he never will.

707
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,000
He made a way when all I saw was impossibility.

708
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,960
My heart bows in worship, my lips sing his praise.

709
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,639
Notice this last phrase,

710
00:33:09,639 --> 00:33:11,559
and this is what I want us to think of.

711
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:16,559
We will choose to serve the Lord for the rest of our days.

712
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,760
Living for Jesus.

713
00:33:19,639 --> 00:33:20,480
This evening,

714
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,040
the thought of Hebrews 11 and verse five

715
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,480
from last Sunday evening,

716
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,160
I just couldn't get it off my mind.

717
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,419
He had this testimony, he pleased God.

718
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,960
Living for Jesus.

719
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:41,960
John six, it's a sad record of many that departed.

720
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,760
Listen, it's a disturbing trend.

721
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:49,000
Demas, as I mentioned a moment ago,

722
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,500
hath forsaken me, having loved this present world.

723
00:33:52,639 --> 00:33:54,559
But we find that Jesus looks at those 12,

724
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:56,639
and this evening he says,

725
00:33:56,639 --> 00:33:59,240
I believe as we could make application to us as well,

726
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,559
will you also go away?

727
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:07,080
Listen, I hope that we'd have that resolve of Peter.

728
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,160
As we look at his answer,

729
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,720
as we look at his answer, say to whom shall we go?

730
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,679
Listen, I don't wanna live my life for me.

731
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:19,160
I hope this evening you don't wanna live your life for you.

732
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:25,160
I don't wanna just get through life and I made it.

733
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:31,220
I made it to retirement, I made it to just got through.

734
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:36,200
No, I wanna say that my dearest treasure

735
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,520
is the light of his smile.

736
00:34:39,399 --> 00:34:42,320
I wanna have that testimony that I please God.

737
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,040
With all that we know this evening of who God is,

738
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,619
with all that we've experienced of what he's done for us,

739
00:34:53,619 --> 00:34:57,160
I say with Peter, to whom shall we go?

740
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,839
To whom shall we go this evening?

741
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:02,920
You say, pastor, I'm living for Jesus.

742
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:06,080
Pray that God helps you to continue to live for Jesus

743
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,720
in every area of your life.

744
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:10,040
Listen, we cannot compartmentalize our lives.

745
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,559
We cannot look at this is the sacred

746
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:14,059
and this is the secular.

747
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:19,520
He saved me completely and he saved you completely.

748
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:23,200
And it's not a distinction between secular and sacred.

749
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,980
I belong to Jesus.

750
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
I am his and he is mine.

751
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:34,000
For me to live is Christ and to die is gain.

752
00:35:34,959 --> 00:35:38,880
This evening, I hope that if you're living for Jesus,

753
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:43,600
that your prayer will be God help me to finish strong,

754
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,959
to live for you all the days of my life.

755
00:35:45,959 --> 00:35:48,080
The little while that we're here on earth,

756
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,860
however long that is that I would live for thee.

757
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:52,959
Maybe this evening, some areas in your life

758
00:35:52,959 --> 00:35:56,080
where just honestly, if you evaluate your life,

759
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,239
you're not surrendered.

760
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,059
Maybe you're seeking Jesus,

761
00:36:01,059 --> 00:36:02,640
but not really wanting to live for Jesus.

762
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,860
Maybe you're trying to follow him,

763
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,559
but you've not denied yourself.

764
00:36:05,559 --> 00:36:08,500
Maybe there's some area where there's a lack of surrender.

765
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:12,820
Can I tell you this evening, wave the white flag,

766
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:14,940
just surrender to God.

767
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:17,179
You'll be thankful that you did.

768
00:36:17,179 --> 00:36:18,540
I don't think this evening,

769
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:21,660
anyone will regret living for Jesus.

770
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:25,339
No one's gonna get, no child of God's gonna get

771
00:36:25,339 --> 00:36:26,559
the beam of seed of Christ and say,

772
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:29,559
well, I wish I wouldn't have been that surrendered.

773
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:31,899
It's just not gonna happen.

774
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:36,380
You know what I think's more likely?

775
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:37,880
I wish I would have done more.

776
00:36:39,339 --> 00:36:42,380
I wish I would have been fully yielded

777
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:44,820
and surrendered this evening.

778
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:50,940
How I spend my time and my treasures, my talents,

779
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:56,420
how I manage the resources that God has entrusted me with,

780
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,820
how you manage the resources

781
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:59,679
that God has entrusted you with.

782
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:05,200
When looking at that management of those resources,

783
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,679
does the conclusion that one would reach,

784
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:12,000
that you would reach, be that you're living for Jesus,

785
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,800
that I'm living for Jesus.

786
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,640
Let's pray.

787
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,880
Father, we love you.

788
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,520
We thank you for loving us.

789
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:23,080
Lord, I pray that you'd help us

790
00:37:24,619 --> 00:37:26,980
to live for you all the days of our lives.

791
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,820
Help us to be yielded and surrendered.

792
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:35,480
In this brief moment of invitation,

793
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,959
Lord, I pray that you'd move and work.

794
00:37:37,959 --> 00:37:40,760
I pray that decisions would be made that would please thee.

795
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,239
We'll give you the glory for what you'll do

796
00:37:44,239 --> 00:37:45,559
for it's in Christ's name we pray.

797
00:37:45,559 --> 00:37:46,760
Would you stand with me?

798
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,580
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

799
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,480
Kimberly's gonna play quietly on the piano

800
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,739
and the altar is open.
