WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.779
in John chapter number six.

00:00:01.779 --> 00:00:03.819
I put these words up here

00:00:03.819 --> 00:00:05.460
and I hope that they would be a blessing to you

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.219
and a challenge to us.

00:00:07.219 --> 00:00:09.260
And I'm gonna just stand to the side here

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:10.659
and look at them with you.

00:00:10.659 --> 00:00:13.659
And I've titled the message Living for Jesus tonight.

00:00:13.659 --> 00:00:15.840
We sing the song Living for Jesus

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.100
and I've highlighted from this hymn some words

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.100
that I hope would be an encouragement to us

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.739
and that we would be challenged this evening

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:25.979
as we open the scriptures,

00:00:25.979 --> 00:00:27.459
but also as we think about this song,

00:00:27.459 --> 00:00:30.940
living for Jesus, a life that is true.

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.779
Notice it says, striving to please him.

00:00:33.779 --> 00:00:38.779
Notice what I highlighted in all that I do.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.340
Not in most things that I do,

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.139
not in the sacred things that I do.

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:46.779
Sometimes if we're not careful in our minds,

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:49.819
we will put some categories in our life

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:51.900
of sacred and secular,

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.900
but the reality is that we are saved by the grace of God

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:58.700
and everything about us is to be lived

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.659
for the glory and honor of the Lord.

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:03.779
Whether therefore you eat or drink

00:01:03.779 --> 00:01:06.699
or whatsoever you do,

00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:10.180
do all to the glory of God.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.260
I had a very wise Bible professor in Bible college

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.239
that said, all means all and that's all that all means.

00:01:17.239 --> 00:01:18.919
Now we can laugh at that little ditty,

00:01:18.919 --> 00:01:22.139
but the reality is that we see that the songwriter said,

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:26.580
in all that I do, yielding allegiance,

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.900
glad-hearted and free.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.459
Notice what the songwriter said,

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:35.459
this is the pathway of blessing for me.

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:41.260
Not this is a pathway, but this is the,

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.540
I understand it's not inspired Bible,

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.180
but I believe that there's biblical truth

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.900
that underlines and supports what the songwriter is saying.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.019
This is the blessing,

00:01:51.019 --> 00:01:53.099
this is the pathway of blessing for me.

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:53.940
Why do we say that?

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.019
Well, God in his word blesses obedience.

00:01:57.019 --> 00:01:58.139
Does he not?

00:01:58.139 --> 00:02:02.019
It's a Bible principle from Genesis to Revelation

00:02:02.019 --> 00:02:05.260
that God blesses obedience.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.839
We want God's blessing,

00:02:06.839 --> 00:02:09.619
but God's blessing comes as we obey him.

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:10.460
Notice what it says,

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.139
living for Jesus, notice this,

00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:15.419
who died in my place.

00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:17.300
You know, sometimes I think we,

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.619
it's not that we forget it,

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:21.100
we just don't live mindfully of the truth

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.779
that it was my cross,

00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:24.020
that I deserve to die,

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.460
that it was for, as it says,

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.460
bearing on Calvary, my sin and disgrace.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.979
It was my sin, it was your sin.

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:33.820
Notice what it says,

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.820
such love constrains me to answer his call,

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.419
follow his leading and give him,

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:45.660
notice again, my all.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.179
Not just give him some,

00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:50.779
but give him my all.

00:02:50.779 --> 00:02:53.940
All for Jesus, I surrender,

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.460
and I surrender what?

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.380
I surrender all.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.940
Notice living for Jesus,

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.539
notice this, wherever I am.

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:03.419
Again, sometimes if we're not careful,

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:06.580
we'll make that distinction between

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.580
in our mind secular and sacred,

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.020
but it's all sacred.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.100
I belong to the Lord,

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.300
and so living for Jesus,

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.820
wherever I am,

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.820
doing each duty in his holy name.

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:18.699
And why?

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:20.300
Because whatsoever thy hand finds to do,

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.860
do it heartily as unto the Lord.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.339
It's what the Bible tells us to do.

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:25.779
And so each duty, say,

00:03:25.779 --> 00:03:30.259
well, this isn't as visible as some other task,

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:33.259
and no one's gonna know we're doing it for God.

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:34.699
You know, if you ever study the temple,

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:37.660
there were chapters and pillars that were made,

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.380
and there was lily work on the top.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:41.380
It's a great message.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.940
I'm not gonna preach it this evening,

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.740
but something interesting about the lily work,

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.179
you know who would see it?

00:03:46.179 --> 00:03:47.899
God.

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:48.899
God.

00:03:48.899 --> 00:03:49.940
That's it.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.740
God would see it.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:56.740
Notice willing to suffer affliction and loss.

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:59.220
Wonder how willing we are.

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.899
We're thankful that he suffered greatly.

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:06.300
Are we willing to suffer affliction and loss,

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:07.380
deeming, notice what it says,

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.020
each trial a part of my cross.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.660
Living for Jesus through life's,

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.419
or earth's, notice what it says, little while.

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:19.459
You know, this life is just, it's just a vapor.

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.980
Appears for a little time and then vanisheth away.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.179
And the songwriter said,

00:04:24.179 --> 00:04:27.200
living for Jesus through earth's little while.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.339
You know, the reality is I don't know how long I have.

00:04:29.339 --> 00:04:31.619
You don't know how long you have.

00:04:31.619 --> 00:04:33.100
There are people that think,

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.700
doctors have said, whatever the diagnosis is,

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.540
that they have certain amount of time to live,

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:39.739
but as is appointed unto man,

00:04:39.739 --> 00:04:41.859
wants to die and after this, the judgment.

00:04:41.859 --> 00:04:43.920
And we know that our time here on earth

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.859
is just a little while.

00:04:45.859 --> 00:04:47.559
Notice what this line says.

00:04:47.559 --> 00:04:49.059
I highlight the whole line.

00:04:49.059 --> 00:04:54.059
My dearest treasure, the light of his smile.

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.279
The greatest thing that I'm living for

00:04:59.339 --> 00:05:01.619
is God to be pleased with my life.

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.420
The light of his smile.

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:05.700
That's my dearest treasure.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.420
You talk to people today,

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.220
you go around and you do a survey

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:10.859
and you ask people, what's your dearest treasure?

00:05:10.859 --> 00:05:12.959
What's the most prized possession that you have?

00:05:12.959 --> 00:05:15.179
What is the thing that you're working so hard for?

00:05:15.179 --> 00:05:17.899
What is that most desired treasure?

00:05:17.899 --> 00:05:18.820
And the songwriter said,

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.619
my dearest treasure is the light of his smile.

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.140
Seeking the lost ones he died to redeem,

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:30.660
bringing the weary to find rest in him.

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.179
The chorus says, oh Jesus, Lord and Savior,

00:05:33.179 --> 00:05:35.179
I give myself to thee.

00:05:36.019 --> 00:05:41.019
For thou and thy atonement didst give thyself for me.

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.980
Notice what it says, I own no other master.

00:05:46.899 --> 00:05:48.220
I'm not my own master.

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.839
I don't wanna be my own master.

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:52.540
I don't want anyone else to be my master.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.299
He's a good master.

00:05:54.299 --> 00:05:56.579
He's my savior, he's my Lord.

00:05:56.579 --> 00:05:57.779
I own no other master.

00:05:57.779 --> 00:06:02.540
My heart shall be thy throne.

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:03.940
You know, that's a decision that we have to make

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:06.220
every single day of our lives,

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.179
and sometimes multiple times in the day of our lives.

00:06:09.179 --> 00:06:10.019
Why?

00:06:10.019 --> 00:06:12.019
Because you know who wants to be the,

00:06:12.019 --> 00:06:14.239
sit on the throne of your life?

00:06:14.239 --> 00:06:16.279
You and me.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:19.940
I wanna sit on the throne of my life.

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:21.140
You wanna sit on the throne of your life.

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:21.980
Oh, not me, pastor.

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:23.339
Don't deceive yourself.

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.459
The worst deception is self-deception.

00:06:27.459 --> 00:06:30.059
This evening, my heart shall be thy throne.

00:06:30.059 --> 00:06:34.820
My life I give henceforth to live,

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:38.980
O Christ, for thee alone.

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:42.059
As we look at this, words of these songs,

00:06:42.059 --> 00:06:44.299
and think about the message that I'm gonna preach tonight,

00:06:44.299 --> 00:06:47.380
living for Jesus, in John chapter number six,

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:50.779
reminded that last week we had the opportunity

00:06:50.779 --> 00:06:54.619
on Sunday evening to look at a single verse of scripture

00:06:54.619 --> 00:06:56.500
in the book of Hebrews in the 11th chapter.

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.619
In Hebrews chapter 11, we considered the testimony of Enoch

00:07:00.179 --> 00:07:01.899
and the importance of pleasing the Lord with my life.

00:07:01.899 --> 00:07:04.339
I said this as we looked at that text of scripture,

00:07:04.339 --> 00:07:06.859
just again, one verse of scripture,

00:07:06.859 --> 00:07:09.140
that he, Enoch, had this testimony.

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:09.980
What was it?

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:12.820
He pleased God.

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:14.399
What a great testimony.

00:07:14.399 --> 00:07:16.660
The thought of that challenge, honestly,

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:18.779
has continued to be on my mind.

00:07:18.779 --> 00:07:21.420
Something that I just couldn't kinda get away from

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:22.260
and shake loose.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.420
Something that's just been permeating my mind.

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:26.779
And this evening, many of you would know

00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:29.399
you've received cards and correspondence from me

00:07:30.179 --> 00:07:32.440
if I send you an email, if I send you a card,

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:33.839
if I write out a card for you,

00:07:33.839 --> 00:07:35.559
you'll see that in that card,

00:07:35.559 --> 00:07:39.200
I will write down this verse, 2 Corinthians 5,

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.839
and verse number 15.

00:07:40.839 --> 00:07:43.600
It's if I could call it a life verse.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.959
It is a life verse, and the Bible says there,

00:07:45.959 --> 00:07:49.959
and that he died for all, that they which live

00:07:49.959 --> 00:07:53.760
should not henceforth live unto themselves,

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:58.440
but unto him which died for them and rose again.

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:01.959
This past Christmas, Brianna made each of us

00:08:01.959 --> 00:08:05.519
some mugs for Christmas, and this mug has that verse on it,

00:08:05.519 --> 00:08:07.799
and she wrote that out, and I set this,

00:08:07.799 --> 00:08:09.399
I don't use this to drink coffee

00:08:09.399 --> 00:08:10.540
or any other hot drink from.

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:13.359
I have it in my office in a place where I can see it

00:08:13.359 --> 00:08:16.799
each day as a daily reminder of this verse

00:08:16.799 --> 00:08:18.079
that is my life verse.

00:08:18.079 --> 00:08:19.859
It's sitting on a shelf in my office,

00:08:19.859 --> 00:08:22.079
and each day when I walk to my office

00:08:22.079 --> 00:08:24.119
and I walk over to where my chair is,

00:08:24.119 --> 00:08:27.779
I see that mug and I'm reminded of that verse of scripture.

00:08:27.779 --> 00:08:30.140
Miss Mady has been making some things

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:33.580
with her new business, and she has given me some materials,

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:36.020
a polo shirt, a sweatshirt.

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:38.659
As I have summarized this verse of scripture,

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:40.820
2 Corinthians 5, and verse number 15,

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:43.700
I've summarized it this way so that it would fit on a polo.

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:47.619
Living for him who died for me.

00:08:47.619 --> 00:08:50.900
Living for him who died for me.

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:55.900
I wonder, as I, and this evening as we evaluate our lives,

00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:01.820
I wonder if we can truly say that we're living for Jesus.

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:04.900
Do the decisions that I, do the decisions that you make

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:08.099
on a daily basis, the decisions that we make

00:09:08.099 --> 00:09:11.219
with our resources, our time,

00:09:11.219 --> 00:09:14.659
decisions that we make on how we use our time,

00:09:14.659 --> 00:09:16.820
how are we managing our time,

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:20.739
what kind of steward am I of the time that God has given me

00:09:20.739 --> 00:09:24.659
as I have the opportunity to use the resource

00:09:24.659 --> 00:09:26.979
that God has given me of my talents

00:09:26.979 --> 00:09:30.020
as I would be a steward of the talents

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:33.940
that God has given me as I would use the resources,

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:36.099
being a steward of the treasures

00:09:36.099 --> 00:09:38.340
that God has entrusted me with.

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:41.219
I wonder this evening if my decisions

00:09:41.219 --> 00:09:44.859
with regard to the resources that God has entrusted me with,

00:09:44.859 --> 00:09:49.859
if those decisions truly reveal that I am living for Jesus.

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:53.140
I wonder this evening if we were to take

00:09:53.979 --> 00:09:56.700
and truly evaluate our lives with that humility

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:59.419
and that honesty, could we say,

00:09:59.419 --> 00:10:01.419
I'm living for Jesus.

00:10:01.419 --> 00:10:03.419
I'm living for Jesus.

00:10:03.419 --> 00:10:06.419
In our text of Scripture here in John chapter number 6,

00:10:06.419 --> 00:10:08.419
and I'm going to jump into the end of the passage.

00:10:08.419 --> 00:10:11.419
I'll make some reference to the beginning portions of the passage

00:10:11.419 --> 00:10:13.419
as we get through the message this evening.

00:10:13.419 --> 00:10:17.419
But I want you to jump in right there with me in verse number 66.

00:10:17.419 --> 00:10:21.419
The Bible says this in John chapter 6 and verse number 66,

00:10:22.419 --> 00:10:28.419
From that time many of his, that's Jesus,

00:10:28.419 --> 00:10:35.419
many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him.

00:10:37.419 --> 00:10:38.419
Verse 67,

00:10:38.419 --> 00:10:43.419
Peter said, Jesus unto the twelve, his twelve disciples, he says this,

00:10:43.419 --> 00:10:48.419
Will ye also go away?

00:10:48.419 --> 00:10:54.419
Peter's the one that so quickly, so often answers the questions that Jesus asks.

00:10:54.419 --> 00:10:59.419
At times Peter answers and it's almost as if he puts his foot in his mouth.

00:10:59.419 --> 00:11:00.419
You've ever been there in your life?

00:11:00.419 --> 00:11:05.419
You say something like, man, what did I mean by that and why did I say that?

00:11:05.419 --> 00:11:08.419
This isn't one of those times.

00:11:08.419 --> 00:11:11.419
In Matthew 16, it's not one of those times when he says,

00:11:11.419 --> 00:11:13.419
Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.

00:11:13.419 --> 00:11:17.419
Here he gives an answer, a response to this question when Jesus says,

00:11:17.419 --> 00:11:19.419
Will ye also go away?

00:11:19.419 --> 00:11:21.419
And Peter stands and he gives an answer.

00:11:21.419 --> 00:11:26.419
Notice what he says, Lord, to whom shall we go?

00:11:26.419 --> 00:11:31.419
Thou hast the words of eternal life.

00:11:32.419 --> 00:11:38.419
And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ,

00:11:38.419 --> 00:11:41.419
the Son of the living God.

00:11:41.419 --> 00:11:45.419
Wow, what a declaration by Peter in verse 68 and 69.

00:11:45.419 --> 00:11:47.419
We'll look at that in just a moment.

00:11:47.419 --> 00:11:49.419
But as we're looking at this portion of Scripture,

00:11:49.419 --> 00:11:51.419
I've titled the message Living for Jesus.

00:11:51.419 --> 00:11:56.419
If you're taking notes, number one, consider with me a disturbing trend.

00:11:56.419 --> 00:11:59.419
A disturbing trend that we see in verse number 66.

00:11:59.419 --> 00:12:00.419
The Bible says many.

00:12:00.419 --> 00:12:02.419
We do not know the number of these disciples

00:12:02.419 --> 00:12:04.419
that are referenced here in this portion of Scripture.

00:12:04.419 --> 00:12:08.419
We do know, however, that in the beginning of the passage of Scripture,

00:12:08.419 --> 00:12:11.419
in John chapter number 6, that God records for us

00:12:11.419 --> 00:12:13.419
and provides us with the record, the account,

00:12:13.419 --> 00:12:17.419
the miracle by which we refer to as the feeding of the 5,000.

00:12:17.419 --> 00:12:19.419
And we're aware and we understand this evening

00:12:19.419 --> 00:12:21.419
that when we look at the feeding of the 5,000,

00:12:21.419 --> 00:12:25.419
that the Bible tells us that that was the number of the men.

00:12:25.419 --> 00:12:28.419
And so we understand that as we look at that passage of Scripture,

00:12:28.419 --> 00:12:31.419
there's probably 15,000, 20,000 people

00:12:31.419 --> 00:12:34.419
that are there for the feeding of the 5,000 as we reference it

00:12:34.419 --> 00:12:39.419
because that is the number, the count of the men that is provided to us.

00:12:39.419 --> 00:12:42.419
We find that after the feeding and after that great miracle,

00:12:42.419 --> 00:12:45.419
that account that is recorded at the beginning of John chapter number 6,

00:12:45.419 --> 00:12:49.419
we find the Bible tells us that Jesus instructed the disciples

00:12:49.419 --> 00:12:52.419
to cross over the sea and they cross over

00:12:52.419 --> 00:12:56.419
and he's then walking on the sea at the rate shortly thereafter.

00:12:56.419 --> 00:12:59.419
And then as we get into the text and we find that in verse number 22,

00:12:59.419 --> 00:13:02.419
it's the day following and there are many people there

00:13:02.419 --> 00:13:05.419
and they're kind of perplexed as to how Jesus got to where he is

00:13:05.419 --> 00:13:09.419
and all that's taken place because they know that they sent,

00:13:09.419 --> 00:13:13.419
as they went across, they heard Jesus go, send the disciples

00:13:13.419 --> 00:13:16.419
and Jesus didn't get into one of the boats, into the ship.

00:13:16.419 --> 00:13:19.419
And so they were kind of perplexed as to how he got there and what was going on.

00:13:19.419 --> 00:13:24.419
And the Bible tells us in verse number 25, notice actually verse 24,

00:13:24.419 --> 00:13:28.419
the Bible says, when the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there,

00:13:28.419 --> 00:13:32.419
neither his disciples, they also took shipping and came to Capernaum

00:13:32.419 --> 00:13:35.419
seeking for Jesus.

00:13:35.419 --> 00:13:37.419
When they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him,

00:13:37.419 --> 00:13:39.419
Rabbi, when camest thou hither?

00:13:39.419 --> 00:13:42.419
And of course, I mentioned already that in the previous portion,

00:13:42.419 --> 00:13:45.419
he's walking on the water and they find Jesus.

00:13:45.419 --> 00:13:47.419
They were seeking for him in verse number 24.

00:13:47.419 --> 00:13:50.419
So we do not know the number here in verse 66,

00:13:50.419 --> 00:13:53.419
but we see this disturbing trend where the Bible says

00:13:53.419 --> 00:13:58.419
that many, many of his disciples, notice where it says went back.

00:13:58.419 --> 00:14:00.419
Went back.

00:14:00.419 --> 00:14:02.419
Went back to what?

00:14:02.419 --> 00:14:05.419
Their own lives.

00:14:05.419 --> 00:14:08.419
They went back to their old ways.

00:14:08.419 --> 00:14:10.419
They went back to whatever they knew.

00:14:10.419 --> 00:14:12.419
They went back.

00:14:12.419 --> 00:14:18.419
And the Bible says that they walked no more with him.

00:14:18.419 --> 00:14:21.419
They walked no more with him.

00:14:21.419 --> 00:14:24.419
That's a disturbing trend.

00:14:24.419 --> 00:14:28.419
I don't know about you, but when I read John 6 and verse 66,

00:14:28.419 --> 00:14:31.419
it breaks my heart.

00:14:31.419 --> 00:14:34.419
And we see here what's taking place in this trend,

00:14:34.419 --> 00:14:38.419
and we find, remember, Paul says this in 2 Timothy 4 and verse number 10

00:14:38.419 --> 00:14:40.419
about Demas.

00:14:40.419 --> 00:14:45.419
He hath forsaken me. Why? Having loved this present world.

00:14:45.419 --> 00:14:49.419
And we look at this passage of Scripture and we see this reference here,

00:14:49.419 --> 00:14:52.419
and we find that right after the feeding,

00:14:52.419 --> 00:14:55.419
that the Bible tells us in verse number 25 that they found him.

00:14:55.419 --> 00:14:57.419
They were seeking for him, according to verse 24.

00:14:57.419 --> 00:14:59.419
They seek him and they find him.

00:14:59.419 --> 00:15:01.419
And notice what Jesus says in verse 26.

00:15:01.419 --> 00:15:03.419
Jesus answered them and said,

00:15:03.419 --> 00:15:06.419
Verily, verily, I say unto you, ye seek me, notice,

00:15:06.419 --> 00:15:08.419
not because ye saw the miracles,

00:15:08.419 --> 00:15:12.419
but because ye did eat of the loaves and were filled.

00:15:12.419 --> 00:15:14.419
There was a reason that they were seeking Jesus,

00:15:14.419 --> 00:15:16.419
but it wasn't the proper reason.

00:15:16.419 --> 00:15:18.419
We find that he says that you sought me

00:15:18.419 --> 00:15:21.419
because, not because of the miracles,

00:15:21.419 --> 00:15:23.419
but because of the loaves and you were filled.

00:15:23.419 --> 00:15:26.419
You received this sustenance, you received this food,

00:15:26.419 --> 00:15:28.419
and so that's why you're seeking me.

00:15:28.419 --> 00:15:30.419
As you go through the chapter, and again,

00:15:30.419 --> 00:15:32.419
we don't have time to develop all of it this evening,

00:15:32.419 --> 00:15:34.419
but you find that Jesus is preaching the gospel,

00:15:34.419 --> 00:15:39.419
and Jesus is preaching the importance of personal faith in the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:15:39.419 --> 00:15:42.419
and then after preaching about the personal faith

00:15:42.419 --> 00:15:44.419
that is required in the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:15:44.419 --> 00:15:46.419
he tells them in verse 63,

00:15:46.419 --> 00:15:49.419
It is the spirit that quickeneth, the flesh profiteth nothing.

00:15:49.419 --> 00:15:52.419
The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit and they are life.

00:15:52.419 --> 00:15:55.419
And the Bible says that there are some of you that believe not.

00:15:55.419 --> 00:15:58.419
Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not,

00:15:58.419 --> 00:16:01.419
who should betray him, and it says in verse 66,

00:16:01.419 --> 00:16:05.419
From that time when Jesus was preaching and giving the truth,

00:16:05.419 --> 00:16:09.419
from that time many of his disciples went back

00:16:09.419 --> 00:16:13.419
and walked no more with him.

00:16:13.419 --> 00:16:15.419
I want to make this statement.

00:16:15.419 --> 00:16:18.419
I hope that you would understand it this evening.

00:16:18.419 --> 00:16:25.419
Not all who seek Jesus are interested in living for Jesus.

00:16:25.419 --> 00:16:32.419
Not all who seek Jesus are truly interested in living for Jesus.

00:16:32.419 --> 00:16:35.419
I want to remind you of what Jesus said in Mark chapter number 8,

00:16:35.419 --> 00:16:38.419
a passage that many of us would be familiar with,

00:16:38.419 --> 00:16:41.419
but take a moment to turn there in Mark chapter number 8,

00:16:42.419 --> 00:16:45.419
and we see that Jesus is speaking about these that would follow him,

00:16:45.419 --> 00:16:48.419
that would take up their cross and follow him,

00:16:48.419 --> 00:16:51.419
and we find that here in this portion of scripture,

00:16:51.419 --> 00:16:56.419
we are confronted with the importance, yes, of following the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:16:56.419 --> 00:17:00.419
but you understand that we must be willing to bear that price

00:17:00.419 --> 00:17:03.419
and to pay whatever that cost might be.

00:17:03.419 --> 00:17:05.419
Notice in verse 34, the Bible says this,

00:17:05.419 --> 00:17:08.419
And when he had called the people unto him with his disciples,

00:17:08.419 --> 00:17:09.419
also he said unto them,

00:17:09.419 --> 00:17:14.419
Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself,

00:17:14.419 --> 00:17:17.419
and take up his cross, and follow me.

00:17:17.419 --> 00:17:19.419
I believe that following the Lord and living for Jesus

00:17:19.419 --> 00:17:22.419
could be used synonymously this evening,

00:17:22.419 --> 00:17:24.419
and we think about this truth of following him,

00:17:24.419 --> 00:17:27.419
and I've thought this often as I've read this portion of scripture,

00:17:27.419 --> 00:17:30.419
that many of God's people will not follow him

00:17:30.419 --> 00:17:36.419
because we will not deny ourselves and take up our cross.

00:17:36.419 --> 00:17:40.419
You know, there's some believers today that are trying to follow Jesus,

00:17:40.419 --> 00:17:42.419
but they've not first denied themselves.

00:17:42.419 --> 00:17:44.419
And there's a conflict there.

00:17:44.419 --> 00:17:47.419
You can't serve two masters, the Bible tells us that,

00:17:47.419 --> 00:17:49.419
and if you've not denied yourself,

00:17:49.419 --> 00:17:51.419
who wants to be the king of your life is you.

00:17:51.419 --> 00:17:54.419
Who wants to be the king of my life is me.

00:17:54.419 --> 00:17:59.419
And if I don't deny myself, but yet I'm trying to follow Jesus,

00:17:59.419 --> 00:18:01.419
I have conflict.

00:18:01.419 --> 00:18:05.419
And in that conflict, we find that we can grow weary,

00:18:05.419 --> 00:18:08.419
and we can get overwhelmed, and we can get discouraged,

00:18:08.419 --> 00:18:11.419
and we find that the Bible says that we're to deny ourselves,

00:18:11.419 --> 00:18:13.419
take up his cross, and follow him,

00:18:13.419 --> 00:18:15.419
for whosoever will save his life shall lose it,

00:18:15.419 --> 00:18:19.419
but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's,

00:18:19.419 --> 00:18:22.419
the same shall save it.

00:18:22.419 --> 00:18:24.419
It's a paradox.

00:18:24.419 --> 00:18:25.419
We find in verse 36,

00:18:25.419 --> 00:18:28.419
For what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world

00:18:28.419 --> 00:18:31.419
and lose his own soul?

00:18:31.419 --> 00:18:34.419
What shall a man give in exchange for his soul?

00:18:34.419 --> 00:18:37.419
Jesus, therefore, shall be ashamed of me and of my words,

00:18:37.419 --> 00:18:40.419
and this adulterous and sinful generation of him also,

00:18:40.419 --> 00:18:42.419
shall the Son of Man be ashamed when he cometh

00:18:42.419 --> 00:18:47.419
in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.

00:18:47.419 --> 00:18:53.419
Again, not all who seek Jesus are truly interested in living for Jesus.

00:18:53.419 --> 00:18:56.419
If we're not careful this evening, the truth of verse 66,

00:18:56.419 --> 00:19:01.419
this disturbing trend that we see, and no doubt we know some,

00:19:01.419 --> 00:19:04.419
maybe we could say even as the text says that we know many

00:19:04.419 --> 00:19:07.419
that no longer walk with Jesus.

00:19:07.419 --> 00:19:10.419
And if we're not careful, the many that desert,

00:19:10.419 --> 00:19:14.419
the many that depart, this disturbing trend can influence us,

00:19:14.419 --> 00:19:16.419
those that desire to follow Jesus.

00:19:16.419 --> 00:19:18.419
We can get discouraged.

00:19:18.419 --> 00:19:21.419
We can get our eyes on where is so-and-so and what happened to so-and-so,

00:19:21.419 --> 00:19:23.419
and I used to know about this person, what about that person?

00:19:23.419 --> 00:19:27.419
And the reality is that Jesus says, keep your eyes on me.

00:19:27.419 --> 00:19:29.419
I shared that testimony at the start of the service this evening.

00:19:29.419 --> 00:19:33.419
I knew I was preaching this message, and I was so encouraged by that missionary

00:19:33.419 --> 00:19:38.419
that 20 years has passed since I've last seen him, and he's still serving God.

00:19:38.419 --> 00:19:40.419
That's a blessing.

00:19:40.419 --> 00:19:47.419
You know how many fellow students I went to Bible college with?

00:19:47.419 --> 00:19:49.419
Not even in church today.

00:19:49.419 --> 00:19:51.419
Sad.

00:19:51.419 --> 00:19:52.419
But I can't get my eyes on that.

00:19:52.419 --> 00:19:55.419
I can't get distracted by that.

00:19:55.419 --> 00:19:59.419
And if we're not careful, when many...

00:19:59.419 --> 00:20:04.099
When many go back and walk no more with him,

00:20:04.099 --> 00:20:05.779
it can impact us.

00:20:05.779 --> 00:20:06.879
It's a disturbing trend.

00:20:06.879 --> 00:20:08.299
Number two, if you're taking notes,

00:20:08.299 --> 00:20:10.619
I want you to see a direct question.

00:20:10.619 --> 00:20:13.499
Jesus then focuses his attention in verse 67

00:20:13.499 --> 00:20:15.819
back in John chapter number six to the 12,

00:20:15.819 --> 00:20:19.099
to his disciples, and notice it's a very direct question.

00:20:19.099 --> 00:20:21.679
I'm thankful I would also refer to this question

00:20:21.679 --> 00:20:23.499
as being a piercing question.

00:20:23.499 --> 00:20:26.299
And questions that deserve answers,

00:20:26.299 --> 00:20:28.659
questions that are soul-searching questions,

00:20:28.659 --> 00:20:31.139
questions that just hit us straight on.

00:20:31.139 --> 00:20:33.739
And the Lord Jesus Christ, God in flesh,

00:20:33.739 --> 00:20:35.659
he looks at those 12 disciples.

00:20:35.659 --> 00:20:37.419
Now, in your mind, put yourself here

00:20:37.419 --> 00:20:39.039
in John chapter number six.

00:20:39.039 --> 00:20:40.859
They've seen this great miracle.

00:20:40.859 --> 00:20:43.099
They, of course, they were going across the sea.

00:20:43.099 --> 00:20:45.939
Jesus comes, they see all these people come.

00:20:45.939 --> 00:20:48.579
They're seeking him because they wanna get some more food.

00:20:48.579 --> 00:20:50.979
And we find that Jesus is preaching.

00:20:50.979 --> 00:20:52.639
And then they see all of these people.

00:20:52.639 --> 00:20:55.179
I don't know the number, but many went back

00:20:55.179 --> 00:20:56.899
and walked with him no more.

00:20:56.939 --> 00:20:59.619
And as they go back and as they leave,

00:20:59.619 --> 00:21:02.859
and perhaps even as they're still walking away,

00:21:02.859 --> 00:21:04.899
Jesus looks to the disciples

00:21:04.899 --> 00:21:06.679
and he fixes his attention on them.

00:21:06.679 --> 00:21:11.679
And he says this, will ye also go away?

00:21:13.019 --> 00:21:14.419
It's a very direct question.

00:21:16.639 --> 00:21:19.399
Direct questions require direct responses.

00:21:21.599 --> 00:21:22.899
You ever have somebody give you an answer

00:21:22.899 --> 00:21:25.619
and they're just beating around the bush?

00:21:25.619 --> 00:21:27.179
Say, come on, man, shoot straight with me.

00:21:27.179 --> 00:21:29.739
Just tell me what, you ever feel that way?

00:21:29.739 --> 00:21:32.179
Salesmen, they're good at beating around the bush, right?

00:21:32.179 --> 00:21:34.499
And I'm not trying to categorize

00:21:34.499 --> 00:21:36.659
all salesmen in that statement.

00:21:36.659 --> 00:21:38.339
So I should say it this way.

00:21:38.339 --> 00:21:41.499
Many salesmen that I have interacted with in my life

00:21:41.499 --> 00:21:43.459
are very good at beating around the bush.

00:21:43.459 --> 00:21:44.819
They don't answer direct questions.

00:21:44.819 --> 00:21:46.459
You can ask somebody a very direct question

00:21:46.459 --> 00:21:50.299
and they just kinda circle the camp, so to speak,

00:21:50.299 --> 00:21:53.699
and they never give you a direct answer.

00:21:53.699 --> 00:21:56.219
I'm sure, Brother Mark, all those years in law enforcement,

00:21:56.219 --> 00:21:58.719
you had a lot of people that you asked direct questions to

00:21:58.719 --> 00:22:01.719
that did not provide direct answers.

00:22:01.719 --> 00:22:05.539
And we find that Jesus, God in flesh,

00:22:05.539 --> 00:22:06.939
can you imagine these disciples,

00:22:06.939 --> 00:22:08.139
all that they've just seen,

00:22:08.139 --> 00:22:09.499
all that they've just witnessed,

00:22:09.499 --> 00:22:10.539
and they see these people,

00:22:10.539 --> 00:22:13.139
perhaps they can still see the backs of these people

00:22:13.139 --> 00:22:15.519
leaving and departing from Jesus,

00:22:15.519 --> 00:22:20.519
and Jesus says to them, will ye also go away?

00:22:21.779 --> 00:22:23.539
It's a piercing question.

00:22:24.379 --> 00:22:25.859
It's a soul-searching question.

00:22:26.659 --> 00:22:31.339
Peter, he stands and he gives an answer.

00:22:32.379 --> 00:22:33.939
If you're taking notes, number three,

00:22:33.939 --> 00:22:35.939
as we look at verses 68 and 69,

00:22:35.939 --> 00:22:38.179
I would say it's a deliberate resolve.

00:22:39.179 --> 00:22:40.919
Deliberate resolve.

00:22:40.919 --> 00:22:45.919
Peter, look at the response that he says in verse 68.

00:22:46.539 --> 00:22:48.619
Notice just the first aspect of it.

00:22:48.619 --> 00:22:53.299
He says, Lord, to whom shall we go?

00:22:54.539 --> 00:22:55.859
To whom shall we go?

00:22:58.139 --> 00:23:01.819
When you think about the response that Peter gives here,

00:23:01.819 --> 00:23:04.339
you think about all that Peter had witnessed

00:23:04.339 --> 00:23:07.279
as he's walked with the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:23:07.279 --> 00:23:09.379
as he's going to give us further insight

00:23:09.379 --> 00:23:11.819
as to what he understood in the next,

00:23:11.819 --> 00:23:14.679
the end of verse 68 and the verse number 69,

00:23:14.679 --> 00:23:17.419
we find it's very clear and very obvious

00:23:17.419 --> 00:23:20.659
as to why Peter would say, to whom shall we go?

00:23:21.659 --> 00:23:25.619
I ask you the question this evening, to whom shall we go?

00:23:25.619 --> 00:23:26.699
I mean, if we're gonna decide

00:23:26.699 --> 00:23:30.059
that we're not gonna live for Jesus, who are we living for?

00:23:30.059 --> 00:23:31.459
If we're gonna decide that we're not,

00:23:31.459 --> 00:23:33.219
and understand again this evening,

00:23:33.219 --> 00:23:34.619
we talk about living for Jesus.

00:23:34.619 --> 00:23:37.759
I spent the time to highlight those words in that song

00:23:37.759 --> 00:23:41.099
to try to help us this evening to understand

00:23:41.099 --> 00:23:43.659
the importance of living for Jesus

00:23:43.659 --> 00:23:47.019
in every area of my life, in every moment of my life.

00:23:47.019 --> 00:23:49.379
And I'm all of his, listen, I'm thankful I got

00:23:49.379 --> 00:23:53.179
all of his salvation and I got all of him.

00:23:53.179 --> 00:23:55.499
But does he really have all of us?

00:23:55.499 --> 00:23:58.579
Some people that think that we need more of God,

00:23:58.579 --> 00:24:01.339
and I think I understand what they mean when they say that,

00:24:01.339 --> 00:24:03.659
but the reality is that it's not so much

00:24:03.659 --> 00:24:06.819
that we need more of God as much as God needs more of us.

00:24:07.799 --> 00:24:08.939
At the moment of salvation,

00:24:08.939 --> 00:24:11.239
I got all the Holy Spirit I'm ever gonna have.

00:24:12.579 --> 00:24:15.279
I was indwelled with the Spirit of God and so were you.

00:24:15.279 --> 00:24:16.879
But you know what, day by day,

00:24:16.879 --> 00:24:18.979
the Holy Spirit doesn't have all of me.

00:24:19.979 --> 00:24:21.739
And the Holy Spirit doesn't have all of you.

00:24:21.739 --> 00:24:24.939
There's some parts of us that we hold reserved,

00:24:24.939 --> 00:24:26.739
if you will, off limits.

00:24:26.739 --> 00:24:28.699
God, you can go here, but not here.

00:24:28.699 --> 00:24:30.779
And God, I'm willing to do this, but not this.

00:24:30.779 --> 00:24:33.219
And this is my life and this is what I wanna do.

00:24:33.219 --> 00:24:35.419
Hold on a minute, to whom shall we go?

00:24:37.179 --> 00:24:40.459
Why would I wanna, I understand that mentally

00:24:40.459 --> 00:24:42.579
sometimes we think that we know best

00:24:42.579 --> 00:24:44.299
and we should be the one to,

00:24:44.299 --> 00:24:47.059
but I don't really wanna be the king of my life.

00:24:48.059 --> 00:24:48.899
Why?

00:24:48.899 --> 00:24:50.959
Because I know the king of kings.

00:24:50.959 --> 00:24:52.419
Before I knew the king of kings,

00:24:52.419 --> 00:24:54.899
you know I wanted to be the king of my life.

00:24:54.899 --> 00:24:57.619
Before I trusted Christ and got born again,

00:24:57.619 --> 00:24:59.819
the reality is that I wanted to be the king of my life.

00:24:59.819 --> 00:25:00.819
What do I wanna do?

00:25:00.819 --> 00:25:02.019
What are my ambitions?

00:25:02.019 --> 00:25:03.139
What are my goals?

00:25:03.139 --> 00:25:06.059
But after I'm saved, after I understand salvation

00:25:06.059 --> 00:25:07.899
and redemption through the blood of Christ,

00:25:07.899 --> 00:25:10.939
I come to this place, whom shall we go?

00:25:10.939 --> 00:25:12.139
To whom shall we go?

00:25:13.179 --> 00:25:14.379
Notice what he says.

00:25:15.379 --> 00:25:19.779
He reveals to us at the end of verse 68 what Christ had.

00:25:19.779 --> 00:25:24.779
He says, for thou hast the words of eternal life.

00:25:25.779 --> 00:25:27.539
Aren't you thankful for God's word?

00:25:28.539 --> 00:25:32.539
I'm so thankful that as we refer to God's word

00:25:32.539 --> 00:25:36.899
as its completeness, that it's filled with God's words.

00:25:36.899 --> 00:25:40.139
And I'm thankful that the words that he has given us

00:25:40.139 --> 00:25:43.779
in this book, the Bible, are precious words,

00:25:44.219 --> 00:25:45.139
are profitable words.

00:25:45.139 --> 00:25:47.979
They're words that give us direction in our lives,

00:25:47.979 --> 00:25:51.219
that help us to understand the truth

00:25:51.219 --> 00:25:54.579
and to help us to guide and to lead

00:25:54.579 --> 00:25:57.699
so that we could live a life that is pleasing to him.

00:25:57.699 --> 00:25:59.659
So that as the songwriter said,

00:25:59.659 --> 00:26:02.179
my dearest treasure is what?

00:26:02.179 --> 00:26:04.419
The light of his smile.

00:26:04.419 --> 00:26:05.559
How can I have that?

00:26:05.559 --> 00:26:09.499
How can I have the testimony of Enoch that he pleased God?

00:26:09.499 --> 00:26:14.259
Well, because thou hast the words of eternal life.

00:26:14.259 --> 00:26:18.299
And I'm thankful that the one who is the living word

00:26:18.299 --> 00:26:20.299
gave us the written word.

00:26:20.299 --> 00:26:22.299
And as he gave us the written word

00:26:22.299 --> 00:26:25.139
and we see the truth of inspiration and revelation

00:26:25.139 --> 00:26:27.019
and we understand this evening

00:26:27.019 --> 00:26:29.419
the importance of preservation,

00:26:29.419 --> 00:26:32.719
that we have the word of God.

00:26:32.719 --> 00:26:33.759
What a blessing.

00:26:34.619 --> 00:26:39.379
Thou hast the words of eternal life.

00:26:40.499 --> 00:26:43.939
Did you hear what that philosopher said?

00:26:43.939 --> 00:26:46.379
Did you hear what that historian said?

00:26:46.379 --> 00:26:49.019
Did you hear what that theologian said?

00:26:49.019 --> 00:26:53.859
Thou hast the words of eternal life.

00:26:53.859 --> 00:26:55.259
Amen?

00:26:55.259 --> 00:26:59.859
This evening, Peter says, Lord, to whom shall we go?

00:27:00.939 --> 00:27:02.819
There's some that maybe are following over here

00:27:02.819 --> 00:27:03.839
and maybe they're going back.

00:27:03.839 --> 00:27:05.999
I don't know where all of those that went away

00:27:05.999 --> 00:27:08.939
and turned back, who they went to and what they were doing.

00:27:09.299 --> 00:27:11.859
But Peter says, no, we're not going away.

00:27:11.859 --> 00:27:12.779
Where are we gonna go?

00:27:12.779 --> 00:27:15.219
You Lord have the words of eternal life.

00:27:15.219 --> 00:27:17.739
Number two, he tells us not only what Christ had

00:27:17.739 --> 00:27:19.219
but he tells us who Christ is.

00:27:19.219 --> 00:27:23.539
He tells us in verse 69, and we believe and are sure

00:27:24.579 --> 00:27:29.579
that thou art that Christ, the son of the living God.

00:27:31.039 --> 00:27:34.499
Wow, what a declaration that Peter makes in verse 69.

00:27:34.499 --> 00:27:37.339
And we find that as Peter would make this declaration,

00:27:37.339 --> 00:27:41.139
notice what he says, we believe and are sure.

00:27:41.139 --> 00:27:44.419
Listen, it's important for us to believe who God is.

00:27:44.419 --> 00:27:47.099
It's important for us to have confidence

00:27:47.099 --> 00:27:49.059
in knowing who he is.

00:27:49.059 --> 00:27:52.219
This conviction and this confidence of Peter

00:27:52.219 --> 00:27:53.379
that is revealed here.

00:27:53.379 --> 00:27:56.379
This is what keeps Peter focused on the Lord.

00:27:56.379 --> 00:27:59.779
You say, but Peter, he had some problems later in his life.

00:27:59.779 --> 00:28:00.999
I understand.

00:28:02.059 --> 00:28:06.459
But you know, if you read the book of 1 and 2 Peter,

00:28:06.459 --> 00:28:08.899
he's a man that lived for Jesus.

00:28:08.899 --> 00:28:11.699
I'm thankful that John 20

00:28:11.699 --> 00:28:13.539
isn't the end of the story for Peter.

00:28:15.679 --> 00:28:19.379
I'm happy that that's not the end of the story for Peter.

00:28:19.379 --> 00:28:21.339
Because Peter served Christ faithfully.

00:28:22.519 --> 00:28:24.699
Was there a period in Peter's life

00:28:24.699 --> 00:28:26.579
where we'd say, man, it was a dark spot?

00:28:26.579 --> 00:28:28.779
Sure, but if we'd evaluate all of our lives,

00:28:28.779 --> 00:28:30.859
there's some dark spots as well.

00:28:30.859 --> 00:28:32.059
I'm just thankful this evening

00:28:32.059 --> 00:28:33.979
that God didn't record my dark spots

00:28:33.979 --> 00:28:36.059
for all of people to see and read.

00:28:37.119 --> 00:28:37.959
Aren't you?

00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:40.739
Right, honestly.

00:28:40.739 --> 00:28:42.700
Can you imagine if your life or my life

00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:44.299
was written in the Bible

00:28:44.299 --> 00:28:46.859
and all people for all times have the opportunity

00:28:46.859 --> 00:28:48.779
to read about your failures?

00:28:48.779 --> 00:28:50.339
About my failures?

00:28:50.339 --> 00:28:52.059
Thank God for his grace.

00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:54.539
Peter's story doesn't end.

00:28:54.539 --> 00:28:57.979
His life doesn't end in John 19 and 20.

00:28:57.979 --> 00:28:59.619
You read 1 and 2 Peter

00:28:59.619 --> 00:29:02.959
and you see a man that lived for Jesus.

00:29:03.959 --> 00:29:08.119
This evening, I see his conviction and his confidence

00:29:08.119 --> 00:29:09.919
when he says we believe and are sure.

00:29:09.919 --> 00:29:11.479
We believe and are sure of what?

00:29:11.479 --> 00:29:15.359
That thou art that Christ.

00:29:15.359 --> 00:29:18.000
Now understand with me that Jesus

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.320
is the one that asks the question.

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:23.479
Remember, we find back in verse number 67,

00:29:23.479 --> 00:29:27.880
then said Jesus under the 12, will you also go away?

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:31.519
Simon refers to Jesus as Lord in verse number 68.

00:29:31.519 --> 00:29:33.279
By the way, he is Lord.

00:29:33.279 --> 00:29:35.200
And then in verse 69, he says,

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:39.279
and we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ.

00:29:39.279 --> 00:29:41.359
What's the significance of this?

00:29:41.359 --> 00:29:45.039
Well, in verse number 67, it is Jesus who is speaking.

00:29:45.039 --> 00:29:47.279
The name Jesus means God incarnate.

00:29:47.279 --> 00:29:49.239
It means Jehovah is salvation.

00:29:49.239 --> 00:29:53.320
We understand who Jesus is as the man, right?

00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:56.719
We understand that Jesus was born in a manger.

00:29:56.719 --> 00:29:57.880
He was born of a virgin.

00:29:57.880 --> 00:29:59.039
We can read of his birth

00:29:59.039 --> 00:29:59.880
and we can.

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:04.200
look at his life, and we can see the man Jesus.

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:07.880
But you understand that when Peter says to Jesus

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:11.160
that thou art the Christ, that Christ,

00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:12.620
the son of the living God,

00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:14.960
the name Christ means the anointed one,

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:19.120
it means the Messiah, it means the son of God.

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:22.700
In this evening, what does Peter say?

00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:27.200
That Jesus, the man, is God in flesh.

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:29.820
What a blessing.

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:33.640
And so Peter, having this understanding,

00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:36.120
it's a deliberate resolve that he has

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:38.320
that he's looking at this, we sang this morning,

00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:40.480
I am resolved no longer to linger,

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:42.440
you can look at all the words of that song,

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:44.800
and you can see the resolve of the songwriter,

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:46.040
and I wonder this evening,

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:47.800
when we look at this deliberate resolve,

00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:50.480
yes, there are many that went, they turned away,

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:53.380
they went back, and they walked no more with Jesus,

00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:55.900
but the question wasn't so much for those

00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:59.960
as it was for these 12 disciples, will ye also go away?

00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:05.060
Peter says, to whom shall we go?

00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:08.180
To whom shall we go?

00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:11.580
The song that they sang, Holly and Brown and Joseph,

00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:13.180
just a few moments ago,

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:18.180
some of the words of that song talk about the blessings,

00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:20.100
look what God has done.

00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:25.420
Look what God has done, we see who he is.

00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:26.860
Why don't you just for a moment think about

00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:28.600
what he's done in your life?

00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:32.980
The chorus of that song says, look what God has done,

00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:36.060
I stand amazed and think of his love,

00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:40.560
I don't deserve it, there's no way I could earn it.

00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:45.340
Eternity, it's not long enough to thank God

00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:48.280
for all he has done.

00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:51.660
But think about this, the promise of eternal life,

00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:54.700
the promise of eternal life,

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:58.660
because of Calvary, the peace that settled in my heart

00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:00.420
since the day that he saved me.

00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:02.440
Aren't you thankful for peace?

00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:06.620
Listen, you can't buy peace, you can't earn peace,

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:09.120
it's God's peace.

00:32:10.139 --> 00:32:13.340
We have peace with God through the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:16.779
we have the peace of God which passeth all understanding.

00:32:16.779 --> 00:32:18.500
He answered prayers.

00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:21.779
Isn't it exciting, Tim stood up here and said,

00:32:21.779 --> 00:32:23.740
God still answers prayer.

00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:27.020
Listen, I love it when a young man, 16, almost 17 years old

00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:29.580
knows that God answers prayer.

00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:32.220
We serve a living God,

00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:34.380
whoever liveth to make intercession for us,

00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:36.139
he hears us when we pray,

00:32:36.139 --> 00:32:38.460
he's capable of doing exceeding abundantly

00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:41.740
above all that we ask or think, and he answers prayer.

00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:43.740
It says this, I've prayed for years,

00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:46.460
never once has he failed me.

00:32:47.919 --> 00:32:50.240
You cannot charge God with failing you.

00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:52.919
Have we failed him?

00:32:52.919 --> 00:32:55.360
More times than we'd like to admit.

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:57.040
More times than we'd like to admit.

00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:59.600
But he's never failed me, he's never failed you,

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:01.200
he never will.

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:05.000
He made a way when all I saw was impossibility.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.960
My heart bows in worship, my lips sing his praise.

00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:09.639
Notice this last phrase,

00:33:09.639 --> 00:33:11.559
and this is what I want us to think of.

00:33:11.559 --> 00:33:16.559
We will choose to serve the Lord for the rest of our days.

00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:18.760
Living for Jesus.

00:33:19.639 --> 00:33:20.480
This evening,

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:25.040
the thought of Hebrews 11 and verse five

00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:26.480
from last Sunday evening,

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:29.160
I just couldn't get it off my mind.

00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:33.419
He had this testimony, he pleased God.

00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:36.960
Living for Jesus.

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:41.960
John six, it's a sad record of many that departed.

00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:44.760
Listen, it's a disturbing trend.

00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:49.000
Demas, as I mentioned a moment ago,

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.500
hath forsaken me, having loved this present world.

00:33:52.639 --> 00:33:54.559
But we find that Jesus looks at those 12,

00:33:54.559 --> 00:33:56.639
and this evening he says,

00:33:56.639 --> 00:33:59.240
I believe as we could make application to us as well,

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:00.559
will you also go away?

00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:07.080
Listen, I hope that we'd have that resolve of Peter.

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:10.160
As we look at his answer,

00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:13.720
as we look at his answer, say to whom shall we go?

00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:16.679
Listen, I don't wanna live my life for me.

00:34:16.679 --> 00:34:19.160
I hope this evening you don't wanna live your life for you.

00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:25.160
I don't wanna just get through life and I made it.

00:34:26.220 --> 00:34:31.220
I made it to retirement, I made it to just got through.

00:34:32.559 --> 00:34:36.200
No, I wanna say that my dearest treasure

00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:38.520
is the light of his smile.

00:34:39.399 --> 00:34:42.320
I wanna have that testimony that I please God.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.040
With all that we know this evening of who God is,

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.619
with all that we've experienced of what he's done for us,

00:34:53.619 --> 00:34:57.160
I say with Peter, to whom shall we go?

00:34:57.160 --> 00:34:59.839
To whom shall we go this evening?

00:34:59.839 --> 00:35:02.920
You say, pastor, I'm living for Jesus.

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:06.080
Pray that God helps you to continue to live for Jesus

00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:07.720
in every area of your life.

00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:10.040
Listen, we cannot compartmentalize our lives.

00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:12.559
We cannot look at this is the sacred

00:35:12.559 --> 00:35:14.059
and this is the secular.

00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:19.520
He saved me completely and he saved you completely.

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:23.200
And it's not a distinction between secular and sacred.

00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:24.980
I belong to Jesus.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.000
I am his and he is mine.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:34.000
For me to live is Christ and to die is gain.

00:35:34.959 --> 00:35:38.880
This evening, I hope that if you're living for Jesus,

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:43.600
that your prayer will be God help me to finish strong,

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:45.959
to live for you all the days of my life.

00:35:45.959 --> 00:35:48.080
The little while that we're here on earth,

00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:50.860
however long that is that I would live for thee.

00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:52.959
Maybe this evening, some areas in your life

00:35:52.959 --> 00:35:56.080
where just honestly, if you evaluate your life,

00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:57.239
you're not surrendered.

00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:01.059
Maybe you're seeking Jesus,

00:36:01.059 --> 00:36:02.640
but not really wanting to live for Jesus.

00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:03.860
Maybe you're trying to follow him,

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:05.559
but you've not denied yourself.

00:36:05.559 --> 00:36:08.500
Maybe there's some area where there's a lack of surrender.

00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:12.820
Can I tell you this evening, wave the white flag,

00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:14.940
just surrender to God.

00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:17.179
You'll be thankful that you did.

00:36:17.179 --> 00:36:18.540
I don't think this evening,

00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:21.660
anyone will regret living for Jesus.

00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:25.339
No one's gonna get, no child of God's gonna get

00:36:25.339 --> 00:36:26.559
the beam of seed of Christ and say,

00:36:26.559 --> 00:36:29.559
well, I wish I wouldn't have been that surrendered.

00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:31.899
It's just not gonna happen.

00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:36.380
You know what I think's more likely?

00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:37.880
I wish I would have done more.

00:36:39.339 --> 00:36:42.380
I wish I would have been fully yielded

00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:44.820
and surrendered this evening.

00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:50.940
How I spend my time and my treasures, my talents,

00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:56.420
how I manage the resources that God has entrusted me with,

00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:57.820
how you manage the resources

00:36:57.820 --> 00:36:59.679
that God has entrusted you with.

00:37:00.679 --> 00:37:05.200
When looking at that management of those resources,

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:07.679
does the conclusion that one would reach,

00:37:07.679 --> 00:37:12.000
that you would reach, be that you're living for Jesus,

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.800
that I'm living for Jesus.

00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:14.640
Let's pray.

00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:15.880
Father, we love you.

00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:17.520
We thank you for loving us.

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:23.080
Lord, I pray that you'd help us

00:37:24.619 --> 00:37:26.980
to live for you all the days of our lives.

00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:31.820
Help us to be yielded and surrendered.

00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:35.480
In this brief moment of invitation,

00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:37.959
Lord, I pray that you'd move and work.

00:37:37.959 --> 00:37:40.760
I pray that decisions would be made that would please thee.

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:44.239
We'll give you the glory for what you'll do

00:37:44.239 --> 00:37:45.559
for it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:37:45.559 --> 00:37:46.760
Would you stand with me?

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:49.580
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:53.480
Kimberly's gonna play quietly on the piano

00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:54.739
and the altar is open.
