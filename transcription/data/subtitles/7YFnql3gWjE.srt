1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,839
First Timothy chapter number six this morning,

2
00:00:02,839 --> 00:00:05,639
and we'll be looking at verses 13 through 21,

3
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:07,639
and looking at the end of this book,

4
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:09,359
and we'll get into Second Timothy

5
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:11,239
beginning next week, Lord willing.

6
00:00:11,239 --> 00:00:12,920
And as you know, we've been studying

7
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,840
throughout this calendar year,

8
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,760
our theme, as you see on the banners, continue.

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,100
And as we think about that theme of continue,

10
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,959
we've used, or we've taken that theme

11
00:00:22,959 --> 00:00:25,600
really from First and Second Timothy,

12
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,600
as we find that Timothy is given a charge

13
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,600
and responsibility to continue,

14
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,759
and you and I, as well, have been charged

15
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,680
and given the responsibility to continue.

16
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,959
I find, in this text of Scripture,

17
00:00:37,959 --> 00:00:41,840
as the letter concludes, Paul issues a charge

18
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,520
to his son in the faith.

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,360
It's interesting, he refers to Timothy

20
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,000
and also to Titus as being his son in the faith,

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,759
and there's a great bond and relationship that they have.

22
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:54,279
We understand that Paul, according to,

23
00:00:54,279 --> 00:00:56,000
there's not much time between the writing

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,439
of First and Second Timothy,

25
00:00:57,439 --> 00:00:59,560
and so Paul is near the end of his life.

26
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,799
He reveals in Second Timothy, chapter number four,

27
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:04,839
that the time of his departure is at hand,

28
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:06,879
and we understand that Paul,

29
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:09,540
if we could use symbolically this morning,

30
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,559
is really kind of passing a baton, if you will,

31
00:01:12,559 --> 00:01:16,440
to his son in the faith, and he's issuing this charge,

32
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:20,480
and we find that as we look here at this charge,

33
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,879
it is made in the sight of God and before Jesus Christ.

34
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:26,139
It's interesting that Paul, of course,

35
00:01:26,139 --> 00:01:28,220
all Scripture is given by inspiration of God,

36
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:31,199
and God would have it so, to use those words,

37
00:01:31,199 --> 00:01:33,540
and there's little doubt in my mind

38
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,739
that the reality that this charge is being given

39
00:01:36,739 --> 00:01:40,000
in the sight of God and before Jesus Christ

40
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
really drives home the seriousness of this charge.

41
00:01:45,099 --> 00:01:47,459
We find that it would bring an awareness,

42
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:51,019
and Timothy is given the charge to keep.

43
00:01:51,019 --> 00:01:51,919
To keep what?

44
00:01:51,919 --> 00:01:53,540
To keep this commandment,

45
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:56,739
and it says without spot, unrebukable,

46
00:01:56,739 --> 00:01:59,940
until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ.

47
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,080
Look at it with me, if you will,

48
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,959
beginning in verse number 13.

49
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:07,000
The Bible says, I give thee charge in the sight of God,

50
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,619
who quickeneth all things, and before Christ Jesus,

51
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:14,339
before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession,

52
00:02:14,339 --> 00:02:18,580
that thou keep this commandment without spot,

53
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:23,380
unrebukable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,

54
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:27,460
and so we see the charge is given to keep this commandment,

55
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:30,820
notice without spot, and unrebukable.

56
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,259
We understand the importance of God's people

57
00:02:33,259 --> 00:02:34,699
living godly lives.

58
00:02:34,699 --> 00:02:38,139
We mentioned last week, as we looked at verses 11 and 12,

59
00:02:38,139 --> 00:02:42,500
that there's this thought of flee, follow, and fight,

60
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,779
and we find that what is it that Timothy

61
00:02:44,779 --> 00:02:46,580
was to follow after?

62
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:51,179
Righteousness, godliness, faith, love,

63
00:02:51,179 --> 00:02:53,660
patience, and meekness,

64
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:57,580
and we find that Timothy is now given this charge

65
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:01,899
to keep this commandment without spot, unrebukable,

66
00:03:01,899 --> 00:03:05,580
and then it says this, until the appearing

67
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,199
of our Lord Jesus Christ.

68
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:10,820
We find that this word keep is an interesting word.

69
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,740
It means to attend to carefully.

70
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:15,160
It means to guard or to observe,

71
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:19,300
but it also carries with it the idea of to practice,

72
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,539
do, or fulfill.

73
00:03:22,539 --> 00:03:27,059
To continue in a course or an action,

74
00:03:27,059 --> 00:03:28,419
and I think about this word

75
00:03:28,419 --> 00:03:31,339
and how Timothy is receiving this charge,

76
00:03:31,339 --> 00:03:35,020
and really Paul is going to remind Timothy

77
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:38,740
of three important biblical truths,

78
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,619
and I believe this morning that these three truths

79
00:03:41,619 --> 00:03:44,199
that are given to us in this portion of scripture

80
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:48,059
provide motivation and encouragement

81
00:03:48,059 --> 00:03:51,500
to Timothy so that he would continue.

82
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,179
I believe this morning that these same truths

83
00:03:54,179 --> 00:03:57,940
will provide for each of us the motivation

84
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:01,979
and the encouragement that we need to continue.

85
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:03,139
I'm not sure of you.

86
00:04:03,139 --> 00:04:07,100
I know for me, I've never ran a long-distance race.

87
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,860
I was never interested in running a long-distance race.

88
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,600
I thought one time in my life,

89
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,740
I was in my mid-20s, and I thought in my mid-20s,

90
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:17,839
I said, you know, I think I'm gonna run a marathon,

91
00:04:18,619 --> 00:04:20,959
and I had that thought because I did some research

92
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,040
and I found that there is a super small percentage

93
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,600
of the world population that has ever run a marathon,

94
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,359
and so I thought, well, so few people globally

95
00:04:33,359 --> 00:04:35,279
have ever done this, so I think, bar,

96
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:36,920
I'm gonna run a marathon,

97
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,760
and so I began to train for a marathon.

98
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,119
How many of you ever run a marathon?

99
00:04:41,119 --> 00:04:42,559
All right, a couple of you, all right,

100
00:04:42,559 --> 00:04:46,920
and I've never run one, but I started training,

101
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:51,000
and I got up to six miles and seven miles and eight miles,

102
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,959
and I thought, okay, we're making progress,

103
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,559
and then I did eight miles for a few times

104
00:04:55,559 --> 00:04:57,760
in a particular two-week period of time,

105
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,880
and I had this thought, this is insane,

106
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,140
and I've not even made it close

107
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,799
to what a marathon would be,

108
00:05:06,799 --> 00:05:10,959
and I never have run that distance again in my life.

109
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:14,119
Holly was training for a half marathon about a year ago,

110
00:05:14,119 --> 00:05:16,899
and I ran out and ran five miles with her

111
00:05:17,739 --> 00:05:18,660
to try to just accompany her on a run,

112
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,660
and I thought, you know, I used to play baseball.

113
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,660
You run like 90 feet to the base,

114
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,700
and you know, maybe if you hit a double or triple,

115
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,739
you know, whatever, a little bit longer,

116
00:05:27,739 --> 00:05:30,820
but long-distance running, not my thing,

117
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:34,420
but I have seen races and long-distance running

118
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:37,660
where there's a measure of motivation

119
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:40,820
and encouragement from some onlookers.

120
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:41,640
To do what?

121
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,500
To continue.

122
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,339
Really, what is the thought?

123
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:47,420
Finish, finish.

124
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,760
Many times when you're looking at someone

125
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,059
that's running a marathon,

126
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:55,739
the course of the marathon is not necessarily

127
00:05:55,739 --> 00:06:00,140
littered with onlookers for the entire duration

128
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,660
of that particular race,

129
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:04,760
but you will find that near the finish line,

130
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,179
there's a great host of people that are assembled,

131
00:06:08,179 --> 00:06:10,140
and they're assembled near that finish line,

132
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,899
and they're cheering people on,

133
00:06:11,899 --> 00:06:13,339
they're motivating them,

134
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:17,760
they're encouraging them to cross the finish line.

135
00:06:18,899 --> 00:06:20,839
This morning, we're running a race.

136
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,899
The race that we're running is not a sprint.

137
00:06:23,899 --> 00:06:25,980
The race that we're running is better described

138
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:29,579
as a marathon, and in this life, we're running this race.

139
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:32,440
The analogy is used throughout the scriptures.

140
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,339
We find it in Hebrews chapter number 12,

141
00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:37,579
particularly where the Bible talks about

142
00:06:37,579 --> 00:06:41,700
looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher

143
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:45,299
of our faith, and as we're looking unto Jesus,

144
00:06:45,299 --> 00:06:49,220
as we're running, we're not growing weary,

145
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:52,279
we're not being overwhelmed, we're running this race,

146
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:56,140
we're giving, seeking to cross the finish line.

147
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:59,660
You say, pastor, when is the finish line?

148
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:02,640
Where is the finish line?

149
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,019
You know, the reality is that for every one of us,

150
00:07:05,019 --> 00:07:07,760
the finish line might be at a different place,

151
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,880
unless the Lord Jesus Christ comes back

152
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,239
while we're still alive, and all of us

153
00:07:14,239 --> 00:07:17,579
that are alive at that time, that'll be our finish line.

154
00:07:19,119 --> 00:07:21,040
But I want you to understand that for Paul,

155
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,339
his finish line came way back.

156
00:07:24,339 --> 00:07:26,200
In 2 Timothy chapter number four,

157
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,880
the time of my departure is at hand.

158
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,079
I have finished.

159
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:31,559
He crosses that finish line.

160
00:07:31,559 --> 00:07:34,559
He understood that he was going to put off

161
00:07:34,559 --> 00:07:37,660
this earthly tabernacle, and he was going to go

162
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:40,619
to be with Jesus, his savior, for he said,

163
00:07:40,619 --> 00:07:44,839
to be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord,

164
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,920
and what great truth that is.

165
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,100
But I want you to understand that you never

166
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:52,220
are going to finish your race with joy

167
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,920
unless you purpose to do so.

168
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:58,500
In fact, in Acts chapter number 20,

169
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:02,619
Paul makes that declaration as he's speaking

170
00:08:02,619 --> 00:08:06,519
to the very people that Timothy is now ministering to.

171
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:10,339
In Acts chapter number 20, Paul calls for the leaders

172
00:08:10,339 --> 00:08:13,679
of the church at Ephesus to gather together

173
00:08:13,679 --> 00:08:15,920
as he is on his way to Jerusalem,

174
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,220
and as he calls them to gather together,

175
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:21,119
he gives them some very important truth.

176
00:08:21,119 --> 00:08:26,119
But one thing that he tells them is that he had a desire,

177
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:31,160
a purpose, to finish his course with joy.

178
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:36,679
We find this morning that now Timothy

179
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:40,359
is ministering in Ephesus, and Timothy is going

180
00:08:40,359 --> 00:08:45,359
to receive this charge from Paul to keep,

181
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:51,039
to continue on, to do, to follow,

182
00:08:51,119 --> 00:08:54,520
and as he's encouraging him, as he's giving him this charge,

183
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:58,880
he's gonna provide motivation and encouragement

184
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,640
so that he too might finish his course.

185
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:07,020
This morning, I desire to finish my course with joy.

186
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:10,479
I hope this morning that that's your desire as well.

187
00:09:10,479 --> 00:09:12,080
I wanna finish strong.

188
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,359
I wanna finish what God has given me to do.

189
00:09:14,359 --> 00:09:17,159
You know, there are a lot of people that start a race.

190
00:09:21,359 --> 00:09:23,359
It's not about whether you start at the race.

191
00:09:23,359 --> 00:09:25,760
Now, that's important, but we're only gonna talk

192
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:28,799
about finishing, finishing.

193
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:30,159
This morning, I've titled the message,

194
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:31,919
if you look at the back of the bulletin,

195
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:33,679
really hear from our text of scripture.

196
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:36,119
Notice in verse number 15, I read verse 13 and 14.

197
00:09:36,119 --> 00:09:39,359
Look at verse 15, which in his times he shall show

198
00:09:39,359 --> 00:09:41,919
who is the blessed and only potentate,

199
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:45,840
the King of kings and Lord of lords.

200
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,840
You know what the Apostle Paul is going to do here

201
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,000
in this text of scripture?

202
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,679
He's going to exalt and magnify the Lord Jesus Christ,

203
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:55,739
just like he does in Hebrews 12 and verse two,

204
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,419
and as we're running that race,

205
00:09:57,419 --> 00:10:00,739
he says it in verse number one of Hebrews 12.

206
00:10:00,739 --> 00:10:02,439
he talks about the race.

207
00:10:02,439 --> 00:10:05,739
He says at the end of the verse, he says this,

208
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:08,759
let us run with patience the race that is set before us,

209
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:12,819
looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith.

210
00:10:12,819 --> 00:10:15,559
And here in 1 Timothy chapter number six,

211
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:19,679
I believe there are three particular truths

212
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:23,759
that Paul gives to Timothy to motivate and encourage him,

213
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:25,999
but what he's doing is he's elevating

214
00:10:25,999 --> 00:10:28,919
and magnifying the Lord Jesus Christ, why?

215
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:31,439
Because he's the one that we're running for.

216
00:10:31,439 --> 00:10:33,079
He's the one that we're running for.

217
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:34,679
You know, you're not running for me,

218
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:36,679
you're not running for your spouse,

219
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:37,999
you're not running for your children,

220
00:10:37,999 --> 00:10:39,079
you're not running for your parents,

221
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:41,599
you're not running for, you're running for Jesus,

222
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,539
you're running for the Lord.

223
00:10:43,539 --> 00:10:46,959
And we find that if Paul is going to understand

224
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,559
what Timothy is going to endure,

225
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:51,519
and obviously he does because he's given

226
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,879
throughout these six chapters of this book,

227
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:56,879
this letter to Timothy, he's mentioned many things

228
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:58,519
about some of the difficulties

229
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:00,859
and understand with me this morning,

230
00:11:00,859 --> 00:11:04,599
that when those difficulties come, we can get overwhelmed.

231
00:11:04,599 --> 00:11:06,239
When those difficulties can come,

232
00:11:06,239 --> 00:11:11,239
we can be tempted to throw in the towel, so to speak.

233
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,039
Those of you that ran a marathon,

234
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,679
just a couple of you raised your hand,

235
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:17,039
there was a point in that race,

236
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:18,879
there was a point in that time

237
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:22,679
that your body just wanted to stop.

238
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:24,919
You had to push through, you had to continue.

239
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:30,119
And we find this morning, these wonderful truths

240
00:11:30,119 --> 00:11:34,799
that point our attention to Jesus Christ.

241
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:37,199
He is the one that we run for.

242
00:11:37,199 --> 00:11:39,279
He is the one that we live for.

243
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:43,159
We sing the song, living for Jesus.

244
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:45,319
My theme verse for my life,

245
00:11:45,319 --> 00:11:47,519
2 Corinthians 5 and verse number 15,

246
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,899
and Mady has made some things for me over the years,

247
00:11:50,899 --> 00:11:53,519
knowing that that's my favorite Bible verse,

248
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:54,679
and I've summarized it,

249
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:56,319
because to write the whole verse out

250
00:11:56,319 --> 00:11:58,719
is just too much to put on a shirt or something.

251
00:11:58,719 --> 00:11:59,879
And I said it this way, I said,

252
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:01,799
here's how I think we can summarize it,

253
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:05,079
living for him who died for me.

254
00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:07,199
And that's really what our goal should be,

255
00:12:07,199 --> 00:12:10,919
because he is king of kings and Lord of lords.

256
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:12,079
Notice with me as we dig

257
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,839
into the text of scripture this morning,

258
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,199
what does Paul first remind Timothy of

259
00:12:16,199 --> 00:12:17,879
when he's giving him this charge,

260
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:19,599
as he's closing this letter,

261
00:12:19,599 --> 00:12:24,599
he reminds Timothy of God's power, his power.

262
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:27,279
I'm so thankful this morning

263
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,359
that we serve an omnipotent God,

264
00:12:30,359 --> 00:12:32,119
a God who has all power.

265
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:33,459
I'm so thankful this morning

266
00:12:33,459 --> 00:12:35,119
that we serve a God who is able to do

267
00:12:35,119 --> 00:12:39,079
exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think.

268
00:12:39,079 --> 00:12:40,719
I'm so thankful this morning

269
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:43,399
that our God appeared to Abraham

270
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:46,599
and he announced himself that he is El Shaddai,

271
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,319
the almighty God.

272
00:12:48,319 --> 00:12:50,039
And then a chapter later,

273
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:55,039
he says to Abraham, is anything too hard for me?

274
00:12:55,239 --> 00:12:59,359
Obviously understanding that you're the Lord God almighty,

275
00:12:59,359 --> 00:13:03,919
that you are El Elyon, the strong one, the mighty one,

276
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:07,119
that there's nothing outside of your power.

277
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:10,599
There's no problem that's too big for God.

278
00:13:10,599 --> 00:13:12,419
And I'm so thankful this morning

279
00:13:12,419 --> 00:13:14,119
that as we are running this race,

280
00:13:14,119 --> 00:13:16,079
as we're given this charge to keep,

281
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:19,199
to continue, that we're looking toward that finish line,

282
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:21,719
that we understand that all the things

283
00:13:21,719 --> 00:13:22,999
that happen around us,

284
00:13:22,999 --> 00:13:26,679
that we're serving a God who has all power.

285
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:28,159
He doesn't have most power.

286
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:29,679
He doesn't have some power.

287
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:31,239
He has all power.

288
00:13:31,239 --> 00:13:33,239
In fact, he says in Matthew 28,

289
00:13:33,239 --> 00:13:34,799
as he gives the great commission,

290
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:38,959
all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.

291
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,679
Go ye therefore.

292
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:42,559
I mean, what a blessed truth.

293
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:44,459
What an understanding that we have

294
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:47,379
that our God has all power.

295
00:13:47,379 --> 00:13:48,659
Where do we see it here?

296
00:13:48,659 --> 00:13:50,779
Where notice with me in verse number 13,

297
00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:54,179
Paul says, I give the charge in the sight of God.

298
00:13:54,179 --> 00:13:58,179
And then notice this phrase, who quickeneth all things.

299
00:13:58,179 --> 00:14:02,299
Understand with me this morning that he alone gives life.

300
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:04,139
He is the life giver.

301
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:07,379
He has the power to give life.

302
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:09,259
And I'm so thankful this morning

303
00:14:09,259 --> 00:14:11,639
that he is the life giver.

304
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:14,519
Yes, we understand about this life that we have

305
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:17,399
as we talk about being living beings,

306
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:19,079
but I understand this morning

307
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:21,119
that there's a focus that I have

308
00:14:21,119 --> 00:14:24,279
that goes beyond just the temporal life, if you will,

309
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:25,880
and that's the eternal life,

310
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:29,039
that he is the author of eternal life.

311
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:32,599
He is the only one that can provide salvation

312
00:14:32,599 --> 00:14:34,519
for a soul, for an individual.

313
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:37,799
And I'm thankful this morning that he alone,

314
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:41,440
he said, I am the way, the truth, and the life.

315
00:14:42,239 --> 00:14:45,279
No man cometh unto the Father but by me.

316
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,599
There's no other name under heaven given among men

317
00:14:47,599 --> 00:14:49,579
whereby we must be saved.

318
00:14:49,579 --> 00:14:52,599
That's what Peter says as he's preaching there

319
00:14:52,599 --> 00:14:54,279
in Acts chapter number four.

320
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:56,679
I'm thankful that not only does he give me

321
00:14:56,679 --> 00:14:58,959
this life here that I have,

322
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,919
but he's given me eternal life.

323
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:03,319
I was born, tomorrow's my birthday.

324
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,979
I was born on July 15th, 1980.

325
00:15:05,979 --> 00:15:08,279
I'll be 44 years old tomorrow,

326
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:11,279
but I'm telling you that I'm thankful for that.

327
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:12,959
I'm thankful for that truth,

328
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,359
but I am so much, just great thankfulness

329
00:15:15,359 --> 00:15:20,000
that on August 31st, 1997, I received eternal life.

330
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,399
I was born again.

331
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,639
See, to have one birth isn't enough.

332
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:29,239
To be born once is to die twice.

333
00:15:29,239 --> 00:15:33,399
But if you're born twice, you only die once.

334
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:35,479
Because the Bible tells me and tells you

335
00:15:35,479 --> 00:15:39,880
that the second death hath no power over us.

336
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,319
Hallelujah.

337
00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:42,559
I mean, I want you to think about it

338
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:45,919
as we're thinking about the grind of life

339
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:48,919
and Timothy has been receiving this instruction

340
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:51,539
that there's false teachers there in Ephesus

341
00:15:51,539 --> 00:15:53,199
and there's these problems in Ephesus

342
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,399
and Timothy, you gotta deal with all this stuff

343
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:57,199
and it can become overwhelming and say,

344
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,079
what, we're serving God.

345
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:01,639
Continue, Timothy.

346
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:02,859
Keep these things, Timothy.

347
00:16:02,859 --> 00:16:03,699
Why?

348
00:16:03,699 --> 00:16:06,220
Because you serve the Lord God Almighty.

349
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:09,660
You serve the God who is omnipotent.

350
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,979
We find that here in verse number 13,

351
00:16:11,979 --> 00:16:13,859
he says that he quickeneth all things,

352
00:16:13,859 --> 00:16:15,440
that he says before Christ Jesus,

353
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,299
who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession.

354
00:16:20,299 --> 00:16:23,099
Now, I think this is interesting as we look at this truth

355
00:16:23,099 --> 00:16:26,380
at the end of verse number 13 with regard to Jesus Christ

356
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:29,699
and the reference that is made as I look at this

357
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:32,819
as God giving us the truth that he has all power.

358
00:16:32,819 --> 00:16:36,979
You know that it was there in John 19

359
00:16:36,979 --> 00:16:40,919
that Pontius Pilate thought he had some power.

360
00:16:41,899 --> 00:16:42,940
Do you remember?

361
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:45,500
In John chapter 19, maybe you wanna turn over there

362
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,399
and I'm gonna read a couple of verses of scripture

363
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:48,940
for you from John 19.

364
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:51,179
Jesus Christ had already gone through

365
00:16:51,179 --> 00:16:54,619
the process of some trials and now he stood there

366
00:16:54,619 --> 00:16:57,160
before Pilate and all that's taken place

367
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,539
and we find that Pilate had asked a question about truth

368
00:17:00,539 --> 00:17:05,179
and then he left and did not stick around for an answer

369
00:17:05,179 --> 00:17:07,059
and then we come to the 19th chapter

370
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:09,500
and the trials continuing there before Pilate.

371
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,019
Pilate reenters into the presence.

372
00:17:12,019 --> 00:17:14,739
He said a couple of times at the end of verse 18

373
00:17:14,739 --> 00:17:16,459
and twice in the beginning of chapter 19,

374
00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:18,199
I find no fault in him.

375
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:19,039
Why is that?

376
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,739
Because he's the perfect Lamb of God.

377
00:17:21,739 --> 00:17:26,739
He is sinless, he is perfect, he is holy, he is pure.

378
00:17:27,979 --> 00:17:31,380
The just for the unjust.

379
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:34,459
He did not have to make a sacrifice first for his own sin.

380
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,339
He was sinless, he simply made a sacrifice

381
00:17:37,339 --> 00:17:40,179
for the sin of mankind.

382
00:17:40,179 --> 00:17:43,539
But we find in the text of scripture in verse number 10,

383
00:17:43,539 --> 00:17:44,619
I'll read verse number nine.

384
00:17:44,619 --> 00:17:47,579
And when again into the judgment hall and saith unto Jesus,

385
00:17:47,579 --> 00:17:49,380
whence art thou?

386
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,199
But Jesus gave him no answer.

387
00:17:52,299 --> 00:17:55,819
Then saith Pilate unto him, speakest thou not unto me?

388
00:17:55,819 --> 00:17:57,940
Notice what Pilate says.

389
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:02,220
Knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee

390
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,699
and have power to release thee?

391
00:18:04,699 --> 00:18:07,839
Now Pilate, I mean, from his perspective,

392
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:09,419
he did have some power.

393
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:12,339
But understand that Jesus is gonna set him straight.

394
00:18:12,339 --> 00:18:15,959
And Jesus is gonna help him understand a perspective

395
00:18:15,959 --> 00:18:19,039
that unfortunately sometimes humanity doesn't have.

396
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,699
You know, there's some people on this earth

397
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:23,059
that think they have power over people.

398
00:18:23,059 --> 00:18:26,759
Listen, I'm thankful that as Jesus says here to Pilate

399
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:29,619
in verse number 11, Jesus does give an answer to this.

400
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:34,659
He says, thou couldest have no power at all against me

401
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:38,299
except it were given thee from above.

402
00:18:38,299 --> 00:18:40,380
Therefore he that delivered me unto thee

403
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,059
hath the greater sin.

404
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:45,380
You know, I'm interested here in this text of scripture

405
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:48,659
as we look at the truth that Paul is giving to Timothy.

406
00:18:48,659 --> 00:18:50,739
Continue, finish, why?

407
00:18:50,739 --> 00:18:52,899
Because our God has all power.

408
00:18:52,899 --> 00:18:54,820
Pilate said, I have power to crucify thee

409
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,140
and I have power to release thee.

410
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:58,459
And Jesus says, let me just help you understand.

411
00:18:58,459 --> 00:19:01,500
You could have no power at all except I give it to you

412
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,500
except it were given thee from above.

413
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:09,500
I'm thankful this morning that Jesus finished the work.

414
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:11,739
He finished.

415
00:19:12,779 --> 00:19:15,140
He went all the way to Calvary,

416
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,779
went all the way to the cross,

417
00:19:16,779 --> 00:19:19,260
suffered and bled and died.

418
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,419
As he hung upon that cross,

419
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:22,979
several things that he cried out,

420
00:19:22,979 --> 00:19:27,539
but one was this, it is finished.

421
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:29,140
Hallelujah.

422
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,539
With that, he gave up the ghost.

423
00:19:31,539 --> 00:19:33,219
You know why it says that he gave up the ghost?

424
00:19:33,219 --> 00:19:35,539
Because he laid down his life.

425
00:19:35,539 --> 00:19:39,299
He willingly and freely offered his life

426
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:41,739
as a substitute for humanity.

427
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:46,380
Otherwise we'd be on our way to the lake of fire

428
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,260
with no hope whatsoever.

429
00:19:49,179 --> 00:19:50,380
He finished.

430
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:53,419
Notice with me back in 1 Timothy chapter number six,

431
00:19:53,419 --> 00:19:55,739
not only do we see that he quickeneth all things,

432
00:19:55,739 --> 00:19:57,539
he alone is the one who gives life.

433
00:19:57,539 --> 00:19:59,459
He witnessed a good confession,

434
00:19:59,459 --> 00:20:01,219
but notice it says this in verse.

435
00:20:01,219 --> 00:20:08,339
number 16, who only hath immortality. I want you to think about that. He is the

436
00:20:08,339 --> 00:20:11,459
one that not only has the power to give life, but he is the one that has power

437
00:20:11,459 --> 00:20:17,139
over death. He has power over death. The Bible tells us we understand as we read

438
00:20:17,139 --> 00:20:22,539
through the pages of Scripture that he conquered sin, death, and the grave. He

439
00:20:22,539 --> 00:20:29,339
triumphed over the enemy. He triumphed over Satan. We understand that he rose in

440
00:20:29,339 --> 00:20:33,819
victory. Listen, during his earthly ministry, we see his power displayed

441
00:20:33,819 --> 00:20:38,579
through the miracles, not only over nature and over disease, but we see his

442
00:20:38,579 --> 00:20:43,059
power displayed over death. When you come to John chapter number 11, and both Mary

443
00:20:43,059 --> 00:20:48,499
and Martha say, Jesus, if you had been here, our brother had not died. They

444
00:20:48,499 --> 00:20:53,579
understood that Jesus had power to heal. He had power over disease. That's why

445
00:20:53,579 --> 00:21:01,139
initially they even sent for Jesus, because their brother was sick. Jesus

446
00:21:01,139 --> 00:21:12,179
loved him, but Jesus delayed. He didn't leave immediately, and he arrives right

447
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:19,779
on time, because he was going to show not only Mary and Martha, but all those that

448
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:25,859
were gathered, that not only does he have power over disease, but he has power

449
00:21:25,859 --> 00:21:37,419
over death. And he says, roll that stone, he stinketh. He's been dead for four days.

450
00:21:37,419 --> 00:21:48,219
Is that not the objection? Jesus says, Lazarus, come forth. He tells him, take

451
00:21:48,219 --> 00:21:55,179
off the grave clothes and come walk. Could you imagine? Man, hallelujah. Listen, this

452
00:21:55,179 --> 00:22:01,499
morning, our God conquered sin, death, and the grave. We find that he makes this

453
00:22:01,499 --> 00:22:06,179
statement. You don't need to turn there in Revelation chapter 1, in verse 18, it

454
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:11,859
says, I am he that liveth and was dead. Behold, I am alive forevermore, amen, and

455
00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:19,019
have the keys of hell and of death. I'm thankful this morning that the one for

456
00:22:19,019 --> 00:22:25,299
whom we are running has all power. What motivation and encouragement that we

457
00:22:25,299 --> 00:22:30,739
receive through this reminder. Number two, we understand his position. We see his

458
00:22:30,739 --> 00:22:34,739
power, but then we also see in 1st Timothy chapter 6, his position. Notice

459
00:22:34,739 --> 00:22:39,979
with me, in verse number 15, it says, in which in his times he shall show who is

460
00:22:39,979 --> 00:22:47,339
the blessed and only potentate. The word literally means the only all-powerful

461
00:22:47,339 --> 00:22:50,779
one. That's what it means, the only all-powerful one. By the way, there's

462
00:22:50,779 --> 00:23:01,619
none like him. There's none like our God. He alone reigns. He alone is God. We find

463
00:23:01,619 --> 00:23:05,839
this morning that here in the text of Scripture, it says, not only who is the

464
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:11,439
blessed and only potentate, the king of kings and Lord of lords. We read those

465
00:23:11,439 --> 00:23:16,079
names ascribed to the Lord Jesus Christ in Revelation 17, in verse 14. We read it

466
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:23,079
in chapter 19, in verse number 16, that he is king of kings and Lord of lords. I

467
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:28,359
mean, what a contrast that is given to us in verse 15 about our Lord, about the one

468
00:23:28,359 --> 00:23:34,039
who we're running for, the one that we're having our eyes on, compared

469
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:40,639
the contrast to the Roman emperors that would have been obviously known during

470
00:23:40,639 --> 00:23:46,679
that day. No, no, no, no. Listen, we're serving God. We're not serving some man.

471
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:50,879
We're not running a race for some man. We're not running a race for some Roman

472
00:23:50,879 --> 00:23:56,679
emperor. No, we're running the race for the only, that he is the blessed and only

473
00:23:56,679 --> 00:24:01,959
potentate. We're running a race for the king of kings and Lord of lords.

474
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:09,079
Hallelujah. His position. In Isaiah 52, in verse number 7, the Bible says,

475
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:16,719
thy God reigneth. Aren't you thankful this morning that our God is on his throne?

476
00:24:16,719 --> 00:24:22,239
We read in Revelation 19, in verse number 6, hallelujah, for the Lord God

477
00:24:22,239 --> 00:24:28,799
omnipotent reigneth. It really reminds me of how Paul, in the first chapter of 1

478
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:33,959
Timothy, turned back, if you will. It was our January memory verse.

479
00:24:33,959 --> 00:24:38,719
As Paul says this, in 1 Timothy 1 and verse 17, under the inspiration of the Holy

480
00:24:38,719 --> 00:24:47,399
Spirit of God, now under the king eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God,

481
00:24:47,399 --> 00:24:55,679
be honor and glory forever and ever. Listen, he's the one that we're running

482
00:24:55,759 --> 00:25:01,199
for. He's the one that we got to have our eyes on. If Timothy is going to continue,

483
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:05,919
if Timothy is going to finish his course like Paul is going to finish his course,

484
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:10,359
if you are going to finish your course, if I am going to finish my course,

485
00:25:10,359 --> 00:25:16,279
I must remember this morning, I must have this awareness this morning that he has

486
00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:20,399
all power and he's the one that I'm running for. I must recognize this morning

487
00:25:20,399 --> 00:25:24,799
and I must regularly remind myself of his position. Listen, we live in a world that's

488
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:31,439
chaotic. We live in a world that it seems like evil is just everywhere and ruling,

489
00:25:31,439 --> 00:25:36,279
but understand that the heathen, they rage according to Psalm chapter number 2.

490
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:41,079
But you know what God's doing? He's sitting on his throne in Psalm 2.

491
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:44,399
He's not worried. He's not up in...you know what happens sometimes when we worry?

492
00:25:44,399 --> 00:25:48,079
Sometimes people will kind of ring their...God's not ringing his hands.

493
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:52,119
God's not worried. God's not concerned. God's not sitting up in heaven saying,

494
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:58,279
what are we going to do? No, he's God and he reigns and he's in control.

495
00:25:58,279 --> 00:26:09,399
His position motivates me. It encourages me because I'm running a race for God Almighty

496
00:26:09,399 --> 00:26:15,439
who's on his throne. This morning, as we look at the text of Scripture,

497
00:26:15,439 --> 00:26:22,279
we see not only that Paul reminds Timothy of the power of God, the position that God

498
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:28,599
has, but he reminds him, number 3, of God's plan. I'm so thankful this morning that God

499
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:36,159
has a plan. Have you ever made a plan? Sure you have. You have plans. Have you ever made

500
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:42,879
plans that didn't kind of go the way that you had hoped they would go? Sure you have.

501
00:26:42,879 --> 00:26:48,599
There was a wrinkle. There was something that was unexpected. There was something you

502
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:55,979
didn't plan for. Something that was outside of your control. You know why that's the case?

503
00:26:55,979 --> 00:27:03,839
Because we're mere men. We try to make plans, but we don't know what's on tomorrow. Right?

504
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:11,519
We try to make plans, but we can't control all the circumstances. But our God is outside

505
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:20,359
of time. Our God is the all-powerful one. Our God has a plan that nobody is going to

506
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:26,599
alter. No one can. You know they've been trying to alter His plan. I mean the enemy. They've

507
00:27:26,599 --> 00:27:30,999
been trying to alter His plan throughout. If you read the page of the Old Testament,

508
00:27:30,999 --> 00:27:34,879
even as you get into the New Testament, you begin to see how the enemy is trying to thwart

509
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:42,239
plan of God through all sorts of means. But understand with me this morning that at every

510
00:27:42,239 --> 00:27:49,879
time the enemy has been unsuccessful. Why? Because God's plan is going to come to pass.

511
00:27:49,879 --> 00:27:57,479
It is absolutely certain. Amen? I'm sure that you've made plans that you thought,

512
00:27:57,479 --> 00:28:05,959
man, I went to, I mean, extremes to ensure that everything is going to happen. And then

513
00:28:05,959 --> 00:28:09,399
the disappointment that comes when it doesn't work out the way that you thought it would.

514
00:28:09,399 --> 00:28:16,319
It doesn't happen to God. Nothing has ever occurred to Him. He knows everything. Nothing's

515
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:22,879
ever surprised Him. He knows everything. I've said at times, and I'm sure you have as you've

516
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:32,719
sought to see your plan unfold, why I didn't think about that. It's never happened to God.

517
00:28:32,719 --> 00:28:37,959
Notice His plan as it's given to us here in verse number 14. It says that thou keep this

518
00:28:37,959 --> 00:28:45,759
commandment without spot, unrebukable notice until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ.

519
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:53,279
Now obviously God's plan goes beyond just His return, but here within the context of

520
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:59,519
1 Timothy chapter number 6, the aspect that is highlighted of God's plan that's given

521
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:05,079
to us here with regard to the charge that is issued to Timothy is the fact that Jesus

522
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:14,000
is coming again until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ. I believe as we look throughout

523
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:20,359
the pages of Scripture how we can rejoice in understanding this truth with regard to

524
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:26,399
the return of Jesus Christ. The fact that He said in John chapter number 14, let not

525
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:31,199
your heart be troubled. You believe in God, believe also in Me. In My Father's house are

526
00:29:31,199 --> 00:29:35,299
many mansions. If it were not so, I would have told you. And then He says this, I go

527
00:29:35,299 --> 00:29:43,399
to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again

528
00:29:43,399 --> 00:29:50,319
and receive you unto Myself that where I am, there ye may be also. Isn't that a wonderful

529
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:57,679
promise? He had given to the disciples in John chapter 13 much information with regard

530
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:01,279
to His going and being crucified and all that would take place.

531
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:06,199
and they were overwhelmed, but he says let not your heart be troubled. Listen,

532
00:30:06,199 --> 00:30:11,039
there is no one, there is no situation, there is no circumstance that is going

533
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:17,039
to keep our God from coming back. Now I understand this morning that many times

534
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:22,599
we pray as John did, even so come Lord Jesus, we're looking for his

535
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:26,679
return, we're looking for his soon return, but understand that he's not coming back

536
00:30:26,679 --> 00:30:31,759
on your timetable or on my timetable. He's coming back at the exact right

537
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:36,559
moment. Now would I like to be alive when it happens? Hallelujah.

538
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:40,039
We'll look at that passage in just a moment of 1 Thessalonians, what a great

539
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:43,599
truth it is, but I want to remind you of what happened in Acts chapter number 1.

540
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:49,159
See this is a truth that goes throughout the the New Testament, the church as we

541
00:30:49,159 --> 00:30:54,039
have understood this teaching of the return of the Lord Jesus Christ, and even

542
00:30:54,039 --> 00:30:58,479
as Paul would give this charge to Timothy in motivating him and

543
00:30:58,479 --> 00:31:05,199
encouraging him, why? Because Jesus is coming again. In Acts chapter number 1,

544
00:31:05,199 --> 00:31:12,159
the resurrection had already taken place, Jesus was there for 40 days, and he was

545
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:17,559
teaching and all that he was doing, and now he's going to ascend to heaven. He

546
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:22,999
gives the Great Commission, it's recorded in Acts chapter 1 and verse number 8, and

547
00:31:22,999 --> 00:31:26,799
in verse 9, as soon as he finishes giving the Great Commission, this is when

548
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:31,599
he'd spoken these things, while they beheld he was taken up, and a cloud

549
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:36,879
received him out of their sight. And while they looked steadfastly toward

550
00:31:36,879 --> 00:31:41,479
heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel, which

551
00:31:41,479 --> 00:31:47,439
also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? Notice these

552
00:31:47,439 --> 00:31:55,239
words, this saying Jesus, which has taken up from you into heaven, shall so come

553
00:31:55,239 --> 00:32:04,919
in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven. I believe that this truth

554
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:10,159
that is given in Acts 1 and verse 11 served as a great motivator for the

555
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:15,279
early church. You read the book of Acts and you can read that even the

556
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:21,839
opposition of the disciples, those that opposed Christianity, if you will, that

557
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:26,599
they say of the disciples that you have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine. And

558
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:31,599
then later in chapter 17, they say that they've turned the world upside down.

559
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:36,239
These that have turned the world upside down have come hither also. And we find

560
00:32:36,239 --> 00:32:40,159
that as you look at those truths that are mentioned, those statements that are

561
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:44,959
given, even from those that oppose the work, that they're acknowledging that the

562
00:32:44,959 --> 00:32:49,799
early church was a church that was motivated to get the gospel to every

563
00:32:49,799 --> 00:32:56,279
creature. Why? Because Jesus is coming back. The last thing they heard before he

564
00:32:56,279 --> 00:33:00,799
ascended to heaven and before the angels said he's going to come back in like

565
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:08,599
manner was, ye shall be witnesses unto me, both in Jerusalem and Judea and Samaria

566
00:33:08,599 --> 00:33:14,119
and unto the uttermost part of the earth. That's what the Lord has commissioned us

567
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:21,759
to do. Now many today, when is he going to come back? People have written books

568
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:27,479
trying to set a time. You can go on the internet and I do not suggest that you

569
00:33:27,479 --> 00:33:32,719
do. Go back to my message from 1 Timothy chapter number 4, how's your diet? You

570
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:35,199
got to be careful what you're watching and what you're listening to, what you're

571
00:33:35,199 --> 00:33:41,319
reading. There's a lot of stuff out there that's not for us to consume. There's

572
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:46,519
people that have all kinds of theories and this thing happens and that happens

573
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:50,399
and all these things with regard to, listen, I don't know when he's coming but

574
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:54,799
I know he's coming. And you know what the amazing thing is? I don't really need to

575
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:59,599
know when he's coming. And actually it's better for us if we don't know when he's

576
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:04,879
coming because it motivates us to do what we're supposed to do. Because as I

577
00:34:04,879 --> 00:34:09,679
understand that I want to be found faithful, I want to be found when he

578
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:14,759
returns doing what I'm supposed to be doing, I do not want, as we read in 1

579
00:34:14,759 --> 00:34:21,759
John 2 and chapter 3, I do not desire to be ashamed of him at his appearing. Amen?

580
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:32,199
So Paul says to Timothy, keep. Keep doing. Fulfill. Continue. For how long? Until the

581
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:39,039
appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ. Finish strong. Finish well. 1 Thessalonians

582
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:44,959
chapter 4, a favorite passage of Scripture, as I look here and consider

583
00:34:44,959 --> 00:34:50,799
this truth of our Lord Jesus Christ coming back and I'll get to the mockers

584
00:34:50,799 --> 00:34:56,199
and the scoffers in just a moment. We find in 1 Thessalonians 4 and verse 13,

585
00:34:56,199 --> 00:35:07,439
the Bible begins by saying this, but I would not have you to be

586
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:13,559
ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that you sorrow not even as

587
00:35:13,559 --> 00:35:18,279
others which have no hope. I don't want you to be ignorant, I want you to be

588
00:35:18,279 --> 00:35:23,079
informed. I want you to understand something. I want you to have truth

589
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:28,799
regarding those that are asleep, those who have died. And he says this, that you

590
00:35:28,799 --> 00:35:34,759
sorrow not even as others which have no hope. So obviously we understand that the

591
00:35:34,759 --> 00:35:38,759
book is written to a local church, the church of Thessalonica. A church is made

592
00:35:38,759 --> 00:35:43,639
up of individuals that have been saved and baptized. They are the people of God.

593
00:35:43,639 --> 00:35:48,639
They're Christians. They're heaven-bound. And we find that he says in verse number

594
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:53,999
14, for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, and we do, even so them also

595
00:35:53,999 --> 00:35:59,399
which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. For this we say unto you, notice

596
00:35:59,399 --> 00:36:04,999
these words, by the word of the Lord. This is not Paul sitting up at a Q&A

597
00:36:04,999 --> 00:36:08,439
time and saying, well let me give you my opinion, here's what I think is going to

598
00:36:08,439 --> 00:36:16,639
happen. No. Paul says I'm telling you this by the word of the Lord, that we which

599
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:21,279
are alive and remain under the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which

600
00:36:21,279 --> 00:36:25,919
are asleep. Now I hope I'm part of that group. Amen? I really do. I think it'd be

601
00:36:25,999 --> 00:36:31,679
awesome to be alive when the trumpet of the Lord sounds. I really do. But I don't

602
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:39,159
know. I could die tomorrow. I could die today. We have no idea. David said there's

603
00:36:39,159 --> 00:36:47,159
but a step between me and death. And that's true for every single human being.

604
00:36:47,159 --> 00:36:51,239
Says that we shall not prevent them which are asleep or go before them. Verse 16, for

605
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:56,279
the Lord himself, remember what it said in Acts 1 and verse 11, this same Jesus.

606
00:36:56,279 --> 00:37:01,839
Listen, he's not sending an angel. Amen? He's coming himself. In verse 16, for the

607
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:05,919
Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the

608
00:37:05,919 --> 00:37:11,559
archangel, with the trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first. Then we

609
00:37:11,559 --> 00:37:14,999
which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the

610
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:20,479
clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore,

611
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:25,239
notice verse 18, comfort one another with these words, how comforting these words

612
00:37:25,239 --> 00:37:35,639
are. I'm thankful this morning that my God has a plan. His plan is extensive. For

613
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:41,959
sake of the message this morning, the aspect of God's plan that is zeroed in

614
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:49,079
on is his return. His return. Why is it that that aspect of the plan of God

615
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:53,199
would be zeroed in on? Because there's a motivation, there's an encouragement

616
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:58,919
that's given to Timothy with regard to continue to do what God has called

617
00:37:58,919 --> 00:38:04,439
him to do. And as he's going to receive this charge and as this motivation and

618
00:38:04,439 --> 00:38:09,039
this encouragement is given, there's an understanding that Timothy, you have

619
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:14,879
to remember that our God has all power. You have to remember, Timothy,

620
00:38:14,879 --> 00:38:20,959
that our God, he is on his throne. His position is that he is King of kings and

621
00:38:20,959 --> 00:38:26,879
Lord of lords. And Timothy, you have to remember that God has a plan. And God's

622
00:38:26,879 --> 00:38:29,999
plan is that he's coming back. That's part of his plan. Remember I said a

623
00:38:29,999 --> 00:38:33,519
moment ago that there are scoffers and there are mockers according to what we

624
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:38,919
read in 2 Peter. The Bible says that these folks were there in the first

625
00:38:38,919 --> 00:38:42,999
century. Can I tell you this morning they continue to be here in our day and age

626
00:38:42,999 --> 00:38:47,119
as well. In 2 Peter chapter number 3, these scoffers and mockers and they're

627
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:52,599
asking about when is the time of his appearing. In 2 Peter chapter 3,

628
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:58,319
beginning in verse number 1, the Bible says, The second epistle, beloved, I now

629
00:38:58,319 --> 00:39:03,279
write unto you, in both which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance.

630
00:39:03,279 --> 00:39:07,759
They may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets

631
00:39:07,759 --> 00:39:12,199
under the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Savior, knowing this

632
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:17,479
first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own

633
00:39:17,479 --> 00:39:22,799
lust. And here's what it says that they'll say, Where is the promise of his

634
00:39:22,799 --> 00:39:27,919
coming? Where's the promise of his coming? And notice the rest of the verse says

635
00:39:27,919 --> 00:39:32,159
this, For since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from

636
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:35,679
the beginning of the creation. So they're going to say where's the promise of his

637
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:38,999
coming and they're gonna try to to cloak that if you will with this

638
00:39:38,999 --> 00:39:42,959
statement that everything continues as it ever has been. And then in verse 5,

639
00:39:42,959 --> 00:39:49,519
it's interesting, it says this, For this they willingly are ignorant of. You know

640
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:55,199
there are some people that we come in contact with that are willingly ignorant.

641
00:39:55,199 --> 00:40:02,039
It's almost as if they would say it this way, Don't confuse me with the facts.

642
00:40:02,039 --> 00:40:03,459
Don't confuse me with the truth.

643
00:40:03,459 --> 00:40:04,299
Why?

644
00:40:04,299 --> 00:40:06,499
Because I wanna believe what I wanna believe.

645
00:40:07,859 --> 00:40:09,379
And I wanna believe what I wanna believe

646
00:40:09,379 --> 00:40:13,259
regardless of what anyone says including God and his word

647
00:40:13,259 --> 00:40:15,739
because I already have settled what I wanna believe.

648
00:40:15,739 --> 00:40:17,759
And so of this they are willingly ignorant.

649
00:40:17,759 --> 00:40:20,659
Notice it continues that by the word of God

650
00:40:20,659 --> 00:40:22,219
the heavens were of old

651
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:24,979
and the earth standing out of the water and in the water

652
00:40:24,979 --> 00:40:27,139
whereby the world that then was being overflowed

653
00:40:27,139 --> 00:40:27,979
with water perished.

654
00:40:27,979 --> 00:40:28,799
Now what's he talking about?

655
00:40:28,799 --> 00:40:29,639
The flood.

656
00:40:29,639 --> 00:40:32,699
Do you know how many people are attacking

657
00:40:32,699 --> 00:40:35,379
the Genesis record of the flood?

658
00:40:35,379 --> 00:40:36,219
Why are they attacking it?

659
00:40:36,219 --> 00:40:38,019
You say, pastors, just Genesis doesn't really matter.

660
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:40,659
Oh, it matters so much

661
00:40:40,659 --> 00:40:42,579
because if the Genesis record isn't true

662
00:40:42,579 --> 00:40:45,699
then how do we know anything is true?

663
00:40:48,699 --> 00:40:51,099
Verse seven, but the heavens and the earth

664
00:40:51,099 --> 00:40:54,259
which are now by the same word are kept in store

665
00:40:55,139 --> 00:40:57,779
reserved under the fire against the day of judgment

666
00:40:57,799 --> 00:41:00,079
and the perdition of ungodly men.

667
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:01,479
But then in verse eight it says this,

668
00:41:01,479 --> 00:41:05,119
but beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing

669
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:08,539
that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years

670
00:41:08,539 --> 00:41:10,959
and a thousand years as one day.

671
00:41:10,959 --> 00:41:12,599
Now why does he say that?

672
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:16,039
Well, we are bound by time.

673
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:21,399
Everything that we do is time-sensitive.

674
00:41:21,399 --> 00:41:24,159
You buy a product, there's an expiration date.

675
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:26,679
Right, am I not telling the truth?

676
00:41:26,679 --> 00:41:30,099
But listen, bottled water has an expiration date.

677
00:41:30,099 --> 00:41:31,359
It does.

678
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:32,259
It's like five years,

679
00:41:32,259 --> 00:41:34,259
but I mean, it's got an expiration date.

680
00:41:35,379 --> 00:41:37,579
Milk has an expiration date.

681
00:41:37,579 --> 00:41:40,259
Cheat, I mean, you go through it, it has an expiration date.

682
00:41:40,259 --> 00:41:43,339
Everything that we do is bound by time.

683
00:41:44,179 --> 00:41:45,979
Sometimes it's so hard with children,

684
00:41:45,979 --> 00:41:46,859
they don't understand time.

685
00:41:46,859 --> 00:41:48,519
How many of you can remember when you're little kids,

686
00:41:48,519 --> 00:41:50,499
they wanna know, especially if you're taking a road trip,

687
00:41:50,499 --> 00:41:51,959
are we there yet?

688
00:41:51,959 --> 00:41:53,079
20 more minutes.

689
00:41:53,079 --> 00:41:55,499
They don't know what 20 minutes is.

690
00:41:55,499 --> 00:41:57,639
20 minutes to my kids was a long time.

691
00:41:59,959 --> 00:42:02,479
But understand that as we grow older,

692
00:42:02,479 --> 00:42:04,919
we get a greater awareness of time.

693
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:11,239
You start talking in measurements of time of months

694
00:42:12,379 --> 00:42:13,799
to a little kid.

695
00:42:13,799 --> 00:42:16,819
Well, we're gonna go on vacation in nine months.

696
00:42:16,819 --> 00:42:18,239
They can't understand that.

697
00:42:19,499 --> 00:42:21,799
But for us, nine months is like that.

698
00:42:22,799 --> 00:42:26,139
It's July, it's the middle of July right now.

699
00:42:26,139 --> 00:42:28,099
It seems like we just were having a new year, right?

700
00:42:28,099 --> 00:42:29,739
It just goes so quick.

701
00:42:32,059 --> 00:42:33,819
But see, God is outside of time.

702
00:42:35,859 --> 00:42:37,379
And so he says this in verse number nine,

703
00:42:37,379 --> 00:42:42,379
the Lord is not slack concerning his promise.

704
00:42:43,259 --> 00:42:45,439
I love that terminology, why?

705
00:42:45,439 --> 00:42:50,439
Because every promise that God has given will come to pass.

706
00:42:51,419 --> 00:42:53,979
He is not slack concerning his promise.

707
00:42:53,979 --> 00:42:55,539
I don't know if you've ever said something

708
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:57,299
that then you kind of step back and you regret it,

709
00:42:57,299 --> 00:42:58,939
saying it, saying, man, I wish I didn't say that.

710
00:42:58,939 --> 00:43:01,299
I wish, not that it was a sinful thing,

711
00:43:01,299 --> 00:43:03,779
but you made a commitment, you made a promise.

712
00:43:03,779 --> 00:43:05,499
I remember promising Juliana something

713
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:06,359
when she was a little girl.

714
00:43:06,359 --> 00:43:07,879
I've used the illustration before.

715
00:43:07,879 --> 00:43:10,159
I told her, Bart, I promise on Saturday

716
00:43:10,159 --> 00:43:11,459
we're gonna go do this.

717
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:17,079
And Saturday came and it was pouring rain.

718
00:43:18,459 --> 00:43:19,919
And the activity was outside.

719
00:43:21,139 --> 00:43:23,179
We weren't gonna be able to do it.

720
00:43:23,179 --> 00:43:24,699
You know, she looked at me and she said,

721
00:43:24,699 --> 00:43:27,939
but daddy, you promised.

722
00:43:29,939 --> 00:43:32,419
Man, that was, I did.

723
00:43:34,259 --> 00:43:36,999
And I said, honey, I'm not God.

724
00:43:37,899 --> 00:43:41,059
I have no control over this.

725
00:43:41,059 --> 00:43:42,579
I said, Jesus, this is what I told her.

726
00:43:42,579 --> 00:43:45,219
I said, Jesus, when he was in the midst of the storm,

727
00:43:45,219 --> 00:43:48,219
he was able to say, peace be still.

728
00:43:48,279 --> 00:43:50,959
And the winds and the waves obeyed and it was calm.

729
00:43:50,959 --> 00:43:53,599
But daddy doesn't have that kind of power.

730
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:54,679
I told her that.

731
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:56,919
And she kind of calmed down.

732
00:43:56,919 --> 00:43:57,739
But you know what I learned?

733
00:43:57,739 --> 00:43:59,399
I didn't promise her anything anymore.

734
00:43:59,399 --> 00:44:02,959
I didn't.

735
00:44:02,959 --> 00:44:04,899
I'll do my best to do that.

736
00:44:04,899 --> 00:44:06,039
We'll plan to do that.

737
00:44:06,039 --> 00:44:08,599
But I tried to take that word promise out

738
00:44:10,199 --> 00:44:11,919
because I can't control the circumstances,

739
00:44:11,919 --> 00:44:14,239
but God controls everything.

740
00:44:14,239 --> 00:44:16,359
The Lord is not slack concerning his promises.

741
00:44:16,359 --> 00:44:17,679
Some men cannot slackness,

742
00:44:18,179 --> 00:44:19,739
but his long suffering to us word.

743
00:44:19,739 --> 00:44:22,579
Notice where it says, not willing that any should perish,

744
00:44:22,579 --> 00:44:24,619
but that all should come to repentance.

745
00:44:24,619 --> 00:44:26,019
Why hasn't he come back yet?

746
00:44:26,019 --> 00:44:27,579
Because he's long suffering.

747
00:44:28,819 --> 00:44:31,259
Remember what Paul told Timothy in the beginning

748
00:44:31,259 --> 00:44:33,219
of this book of 1 Timothy.

749
00:44:33,219 --> 00:44:36,579
He said, this is a faithful saying

750
00:44:36,579 --> 00:44:37,939
and worthy of all acceptation

751
00:44:37,939 --> 00:44:39,679
that Christ Jesus came into the world

752
00:44:39,679 --> 00:44:42,019
to save sinners of whom I am chief.

753
00:44:42,019 --> 00:44:45,379
So Jesus came to save humanity.

754
00:44:45,379 --> 00:44:48,639
And so he has a desire for people to be saved.

755
00:44:48,639 --> 00:44:50,259
And that of course is his plan.

756
00:44:50,259 --> 00:44:53,679
And so with regard to the aspect of the plan of his return,

757
00:44:53,679 --> 00:44:55,519
he's not slack concerning his promise.

758
00:44:55,519 --> 00:44:59,119
He is going to come back, but he's long suffering.

759
00:44:59,119 --> 00:44:59,959
Why?

760
00:44:59,959 --> 00:45:00,959
Because he's not willing that any should perish,

761
00:45:00,959 --> 00:45:03,919
but that all should come to repentance.

762
00:45:03,919 --> 00:45:05,919
Back in the text of scripture,

763
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:08,679
it says in verse 16 in 1 Timothy 6,

764
00:45:08,679 --> 00:45:11,579
who only hath immortality dwelling in the light,

765
00:45:11,579 --> 00:45:14,579
which no man can approach unto whom no man hath seen,

766
00:45:14,599 --> 00:45:18,899
nor can see to whom be honor and power everlasting.

767
00:45:18,899 --> 00:45:19,739
Amen.

768
00:45:19,739 --> 00:45:20,799
Isn't that exciting?

769
00:45:20,799 --> 00:45:22,999
I mean, just the climax, if you will,

770
00:45:22,999 --> 00:45:25,879
of how this charge is given.

771
00:45:25,879 --> 00:45:28,479
The text continues in verse 17

772
00:45:28,479 --> 00:45:29,879
through the end of the chapter,

773
00:45:29,879 --> 00:45:32,079
really highlighting on some truth

774
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:34,879
with regard to now giving a charge to those

775
00:45:34,879 --> 00:45:36,999
that's already been referenced earlier in the chapter

776
00:45:36,999 --> 00:45:40,159
in verse 17, charge them that are rich in this world.

777
00:45:40,159 --> 00:45:42,879
Now, remember the problem of verse number nine

778
00:45:42,879 --> 00:45:44,159
was not they that are rich,

779
00:45:44,659 --> 00:45:45,779
but they that will be rich.

780
00:45:45,779 --> 00:45:47,019
That's their motivation.

781
00:45:47,019 --> 00:45:48,139
That's their drive.

782
00:45:48,139 --> 00:45:49,899
That's all they're consumed with.

783
00:45:49,899 --> 00:45:52,499
It's not a problem to be rich.

784
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:55,979
It's a problem if that's our driving, motivating,

785
00:45:55,979 --> 00:45:59,139
all I'm living for is to get rich.

786
00:45:59,139 --> 00:45:59,959
That's a problem.

787
00:45:59,959 --> 00:46:02,279
But so he says, charge them that are rich in the world,

788
00:46:02,279 --> 00:46:03,899
that they be not high-minded,

789
00:46:03,899 --> 00:46:06,659
nor trust in their uncertain riches.

790
00:46:06,659 --> 00:46:07,699
You know, there's a lot of people

791
00:46:07,699 --> 00:46:09,999
that trust in uncertain riches.

792
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:12,099
But what?

793
00:46:12,099 --> 00:46:13,799
In the living God.

794
00:46:14,179 --> 00:46:15,139
In the living God.

795
00:46:15,139 --> 00:46:16,899
Who?

796
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:20,319
Giveth us richly all things to enjoy.

797
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:23,779
I'm thankful that our God is a benevolent God.

798
00:46:23,779 --> 00:46:24,939
He's a giving God.

799
00:46:25,819 --> 00:46:27,139
For God so loved the world

800
00:46:27,139 --> 00:46:30,259
that he gave his only begotten Son,

801
00:46:30,259 --> 00:46:32,019
that whosoever believeth in him should not perish,

802
00:46:32,019 --> 00:46:34,479
but have everlasting life, the greatest gift,

803
00:46:34,479 --> 00:46:37,139
the unspeakable gift.

804
00:46:37,139 --> 00:46:39,699
It says in verse 18 that they do good,

805
00:46:39,699 --> 00:46:41,659
that they be rich in good works,

806
00:46:41,659 --> 00:46:43,719
ready to distribute, willing to communicate,

807
00:46:44,539 --> 00:46:46,699
laying up in store for themselves a good foundation

808
00:46:46,699 --> 00:46:47,859
against the time to come,

809
00:46:47,859 --> 00:46:49,659
that they may lay hold on eternal life.

810
00:46:49,659 --> 00:46:53,819
Remember this truth of having the focus of eternity,

811
00:46:53,819 --> 00:46:56,119
not the temporary.

812
00:46:56,119 --> 00:46:58,939
So often we can get caught up living in the temporary,

813
00:46:58,939 --> 00:47:01,019
the mundane, the monotonous, but no,

814
00:47:01,019 --> 00:47:02,219
we as God's people,

815
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:04,019
we look not at those things which are temporal,

816
00:47:04,019 --> 00:47:06,819
but those things which are eternal.

817
00:47:06,819 --> 00:47:10,459
And we find that he had said to Timothy in verse number 12,

818
00:47:10,799 --> 00:47:13,839
the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life.

819
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:16,559
And I mentioned this even as we see it in verse number 19.

820
00:47:16,559 --> 00:47:18,639
It's not the idea that you're somehow

821
00:47:18,639 --> 00:47:20,319
going to get eternal life.

822
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:23,819
It's rather the idea that because you have eternal life,

823
00:47:23,819 --> 00:47:26,699
you are a possessor of eternal life.

824
00:47:26,699 --> 00:47:30,099
You ought to also be a professor of eternal life.

825
00:47:30,099 --> 00:47:33,039
You're to be living like you're saved.

826
00:47:34,919 --> 00:47:36,959
Oh, Timothy, verse 20.

827
00:47:37,959 --> 00:47:42,879
Keep that which is committed to thy trust,

828
00:47:42,879 --> 00:47:45,379
avoiding profane and vain babblings

829
00:47:45,379 --> 00:47:49,439
and oppositions of science, falsely so called,

830
00:47:49,439 --> 00:47:53,179
which some professing have erred concerning the faith.

831
00:47:53,179 --> 00:47:55,279
Grace be with thee.

832
00:47:55,279 --> 00:47:56,659
Amen.

833
00:47:56,659 --> 00:48:01,139
This morning, we're not in Ephesus and we're not Timothy.

834
00:48:02,139 --> 00:48:07,139
But this morning, if you're saved by the grace of God,

835
00:48:08,259 --> 00:48:09,559
you're running a race.

836
00:48:11,939 --> 00:48:16,179
And just as Paul is seeking to motivate

837
00:48:16,179 --> 00:48:20,019
and encourage Timothy to finish his race,

838
00:48:20,859 --> 00:48:23,659
I believe this morning that we too are being motivated

839
00:48:23,659 --> 00:48:26,539
and encouraged to finish our race.

840
00:48:27,379 --> 00:48:32,379
When times get hard, when we just want to give up,

841
00:48:34,859 --> 00:48:36,219
what's the point?

842
00:48:37,059 --> 00:48:40,299
No, no, don't go down that path of thinking.

843
00:48:41,299 --> 00:48:44,820
Fix your attention on our King of Kings and Lord of Lords,

844
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:49,820
our God, our Savior, the one for whom we are running.

845
00:48:50,139 --> 00:48:53,059
And remember his power.

846
00:48:53,059 --> 00:48:54,619
He has all power.

847
00:48:54,619 --> 00:48:56,739
I am weak, but he is strong.

848
00:48:59,479 --> 00:49:03,859
His strength is made perfect in weakness.

849
00:49:05,539 --> 00:49:07,659
2 Corinthians 12.

850
00:49:07,659 --> 00:49:10,859
We must remember this morning that our God has all power.

851
00:49:10,859 --> 00:49:12,859
Remember his position,

852
00:49:12,859 --> 00:49:16,539
that he is the blessed and only potentate,

853
00:49:16,539 --> 00:49:19,799
literally the only all powerful one.

854
00:49:19,799 --> 00:49:21,820
He is King of Kings and Lord of Lords.

855
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:24,019
Thy God reigneth.

856
00:49:24,019 --> 00:49:28,659
You say, pastor, it's chaotic, things are crazy.

857
00:49:28,659 --> 00:49:32,500
I know, but God's on his throne.

858
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:34,940
None of it surprised God.

859
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:37,059
You say, I read the news and I was surprised.

860
00:49:37,059 --> 00:49:38,179
God wasn't.

861
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:44,659
Rest in knowing that thy God reigneth.

862
00:49:44,659 --> 00:49:47,539
And number three, remember his plan.

863
00:49:47,539 --> 00:49:52,239
Are you looking for, as he would say to Titus,

864
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:55,320
the blessed hope and glorious appearing

865
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:58,579
of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.

866
00:50:00,039 --> 00:50:02,239
Listen for the trumpet, the songwriter said.

867
00:50:02,239 --> 00:50:11,579
Jesus is coming. Hallelujah. This morning, I want to finish well. I want to finish strong.

868
00:50:11,579 --> 00:50:16,419
I want to continue our theme for this year, continue. You say, but all these things are

869
00:50:16,419 --> 00:50:25,279
against us. If God be for us, who can be against us? Remember, we are more than conquerors

870
00:50:25,279 --> 00:50:31,539
through Him, but thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus

871
00:50:31,539 --> 00:50:38,999
Christ. This morning, we serve the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, and He is worthy

872
00:50:38,999 --> 00:50:47,239
of all of our worship, and He is worthy this morning of us continuing, continuing, pressing

873
00:50:47,239 --> 00:50:55,199
on, finishing. He's worthy. Let's pray. Father, we love you. We thank you for loving us. We

874
00:50:55,199 --> 00:51:00,079
thank you for your Word, the truth contained therein. We thank you for this letter that

875
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:08,999
we've been able to study over these months, the encouragement, instruction that we have

876
00:51:08,999 --> 00:51:17,699
received. And Lord, this morning, I pray that you would help us, even as Timothy was receiving

877
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:22,439
this charge and being reminded of these truths, Lord, so that he would continue, so that he

878
00:51:22,479 --> 00:51:32,279
would finish. I pray that you would help us to rejoice in knowing that you have all power,

879
00:51:32,279 --> 00:51:39,719
your position is settled. We have a plan that will never be altered. And God, I pray you'd

880
00:51:39,719 --> 00:51:44,679
help us to keep our eyes on Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith. God, if there's

881
00:51:44,679 --> 00:51:48,919
one here this morning or one that's tuned in via live stream that's not sure of heaven,

882
00:51:48,919 --> 00:51:52,519
I pray that today they'd be saved. They'd trust the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal

883
00:51:52,519 --> 00:51:58,159
Savior. Maybe this morning there's someone here or on live stream that's struggling,

884
00:51:58,159 --> 00:52:04,319
they're overwhelmed, they're just dealing with it. God, I pray that you'd encourage

885
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:14,879
them to continue. I pray, Lord, that for the one that has their eyes on you, would you

886
00:52:14,879 --> 00:52:23,519
help us to continue in that same manner. Help us not to be distracted. Help us not

887
00:52:23,519 --> 00:52:30,059
to be detoured. No, help us to continue. I pray that in this moment, this time of invitation

888
00:52:30,059 --> 00:52:36,279
that you'd have your will and way, I pray that your people would respond. Do business

889
00:52:36,279 --> 00:52:40,959
with God this morning. And I pray that you'd be honored and glorified, that you'd be exalted

890
00:52:40,959 --> 00:52:45,119
through every decision that's made. Well, thank you for it in Christ's name. We pray.
