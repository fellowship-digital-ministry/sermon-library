00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.839
First Timothy chapter number six this morning,

00:00:02.839 --> 00:00:05.639
and we'll be looking at verses 13 through 21,

00:00:05.639 --> 00:00:07.639
and looking at the end of this book,

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:09.359
and we'll get into Second Timothy

00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:11.239
beginning next week, Lord willing.

00:00:11.239 --> 00:00:12.920
And as you know, we've been studying

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.840
throughout this calendar year,

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.760
our theme, as you see on the banners, continue.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.100
And as we think about that theme of continue,

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.959
we've used, or we've taken that theme

00:00:22.959 --> 00:00:25.600
really from First and Second Timothy,

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.600
as we find that Timothy is given a charge

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.600
and responsibility to continue,

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.759
and you and I, as well, have been charged

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.680
and given the responsibility to continue.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.959
I find, in this text of Scripture,

00:00:37.959 --> 00:00:41.840
as the letter concludes, Paul issues a charge

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.520
to his son in the faith.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.360
It's interesting, he refers to Timothy

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.000
and also to Titus as being his son in the faith,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.759
and there's a great bond and relationship that they have.

00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:54.279
We understand that Paul, according to,

00:00:54.279 --> 00:00:56.000
there's not much time between the writing

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.439
of First and Second Timothy,

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:59.560
and so Paul is near the end of his life.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.799
He reveals in Second Timothy, chapter number four,

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:04.839
that the time of his departure is at hand,

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:06.879
and we understand that Paul,

00:01:06.879 --> 00:01:09.540
if we could use symbolically this morning,

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.559
is really kind of passing a baton, if you will,

00:01:12.559 --> 00:01:16.440
to his son in the faith, and he's issuing this charge,

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.480
and we find that as we look here at this charge,

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.879
it is made in the sight of God and before Jesus Christ.

00:01:23.879 --> 00:01:26.139
It's interesting that Paul, of course,

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:28.220
all Scripture is given by inspiration of God,

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.199
and God would have it so, to use those words,

00:01:31.199 --> 00:01:33.540
and there's little doubt in my mind

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.739
that the reality that this charge is being given

00:01:36.739 --> 00:01:40.000
in the sight of God and before Jesus Christ

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
really drives home the seriousness of this charge.

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:47.459
We find that it would bring an awareness,

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:51.019
and Timothy is given the charge to keep.

00:01:51.019 --> 00:01:51.919
To keep what?

00:01:51.919 --> 00:01:53.540
To keep this commandment,

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.739
and it says without spot, unrebukable,

00:01:56.739 --> 00:01:59.940
until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.080
Look at it with me, if you will,

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.959
beginning in verse number 13.

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:07.000
The Bible says, I give thee charge in the sight of God,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.619
who quickeneth all things, and before Christ Jesus,

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.339
before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession,

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:18.580
that thou keep this commandment without spot,

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.380
unrebukable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.460
and so we see the charge is given to keep this commandment,

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.820
notice without spot, and unrebukable.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.259
We understand the importance of God's people

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:34.699
living godly lives.

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:38.139
We mentioned last week, as we looked at verses 11 and 12,

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:42.500
that there's this thought of flee, follow, and fight,

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.779
and we find that what is it that Timothy

00:02:44.779 --> 00:02:46.580
was to follow after?

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.179
Righteousness, godliness, faith, love,

00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:53.660
patience, and meekness,

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.580
and we find that Timothy is now given this charge

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.899
to keep this commandment without spot, unrebukable,

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:05.580
and then it says this, until the appearing

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.199
of our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:10.820
We find that this word keep is an interesting word.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.740
It means to attend to carefully.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.160
It means to guard or to observe,

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.300
but it also carries with it the idea of to practice,

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.539
do, or fulfill.

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:27.059
To continue in a course or an action,

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:28.419
and I think about this word

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:31.339
and how Timothy is receiving this charge,

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:35.020
and really Paul is going to remind Timothy

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.740
of three important biblical truths,

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.619
and I believe this morning that these three truths

00:03:41.619 --> 00:03:44.199
that are given to us in this portion of scripture

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:48.059
provide motivation and encouragement

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:51.500
to Timothy so that he would continue.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.179
I believe this morning that these same truths

00:03:54.179 --> 00:03:57.940
will provide for each of us the motivation

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.979
and the encouragement that we need to continue.

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:03.139
I'm not sure of you.

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:07.100
I know for me, I've never ran a long-distance race.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.860
I was never interested in running a long-distance race.

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.600
I thought one time in my life,

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.740
I was in my mid-20s, and I thought in my mid-20s,

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.839
I said, you know, I think I'm gonna run a marathon,

00:04:18.619 --> 00:04:20.959
and I had that thought because I did some research

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.040
and I found that there is a super small percentage

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.600
of the world population that has ever run a marathon,

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.359
and so I thought, well, so few people globally

00:04:33.359 --> 00:04:35.279
have ever done this, so I think, bar,

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:36.920
I'm gonna run a marathon,

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.760
and so I began to train for a marathon.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.119
How many of you ever run a marathon?

00:04:41.119 --> 00:04:42.559
All right, a couple of you, all right,

00:04:42.559 --> 00:04:46.920
and I've never run one, but I started training,

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.000
and I got up to six miles and seven miles and eight miles,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.959
and I thought, okay, we're making progress,

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:55.559
and then I did eight miles for a few times

00:04:55.559 --> 00:04:57.760
in a particular two-week period of time,

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.880
and I had this thought, this is insane,

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.140
and I've not even made it close

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:06.799
to what a marathon would be,

00:05:06.799 --> 00:05:10.959
and I never have run that distance again in my life.

00:05:10.959 --> 00:05:14.119
Holly was training for a half marathon about a year ago,

00:05:14.119 --> 00:05:16.899
and I ran out and ran five miles with her

00:05:17.739 --> 00:05:18.660
to try to just accompany her on a run,

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.660
and I thought, you know, I used to play baseball.

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.660
You run like 90 feet to the base,

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.700
and you know, maybe if you hit a double or triple,

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.739
you know, whatever, a little bit longer,

00:05:27.739 --> 00:05:30.820
but long-distance running, not my thing,

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.420
but I have seen races and long-distance running

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.660
where there's a measure of motivation

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.820
and encouragement from some onlookers.

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:41.640
To do what?

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:42.500
To continue.

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.339
Really, what is the thought?

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:47.420
Finish, finish.

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:49.760
Many times when you're looking at someone

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.059
that's running a marathon,

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:55.739
the course of the marathon is not necessarily

00:05:55.739 --> 00:06:00.140
littered with onlookers for the entire duration

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:01.660
of that particular race,

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.760
but you will find that near the finish line,

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.179
there's a great host of people that are assembled,

00:06:08.179 --> 00:06:10.140
and they're assembled near that finish line,

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:11.899
and they're cheering people on,

00:06:11.899 --> 00:06:13.339
they're motivating them,

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:17.760
they're encouraging them to cross the finish line.

00:06:18.899 --> 00:06:20.839
This morning, we're running a race.

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.899
The race that we're running is not a sprint.

00:06:23.899 --> 00:06:25.980
The race that we're running is better described

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:29.579
as a marathon, and in this life, we're running this race.

00:06:29.579 --> 00:06:32.440
The analogy is used throughout the scriptures.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.339
We find it in Hebrews chapter number 12,

00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:37.579
particularly where the Bible talks about

00:06:37.579 --> 00:06:41.700
looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:45.299
of our faith, and as we're looking unto Jesus,

00:06:45.299 --> 00:06:49.220
as we're running, we're not growing weary,

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:52.279
we're not being overwhelmed, we're running this race,

00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:56.140
we're giving, seeking to cross the finish line.

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:59.660
You say, pastor, when is the finish line?

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:02.640
Where is the finish line?

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:05.019
You know, the reality is that for every one of us,

00:07:05.019 --> 00:07:07.760
the finish line might be at a different place,

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.880
unless the Lord Jesus Christ comes back

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.239
while we're still alive, and all of us

00:07:14.239 --> 00:07:17.579
that are alive at that time, that'll be our finish line.

00:07:19.119 --> 00:07:21.040
But I want you to understand that for Paul,

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:24.339
his finish line came way back.

00:07:24.339 --> 00:07:26.200
In 2 Timothy chapter number four,

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:27.880
the time of my departure is at hand.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.079
I have finished.

00:07:30.079 --> 00:07:31.559
He crosses that finish line.

00:07:31.559 --> 00:07:34.559
He understood that he was going to put off

00:07:34.559 --> 00:07:37.660
this earthly tabernacle, and he was going to go

00:07:38.519 --> 00:07:40.619
to be with Jesus, his savior, for he said,

00:07:40.619 --> 00:07:44.839
to be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord,

00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:46.920
and what great truth that is.

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.100
But I want you to understand that you never

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:52.220
are going to finish your race with joy

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:54.920
unless you purpose to do so.

00:07:56.059 --> 00:07:58.500
In fact, in Acts chapter number 20,

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:02.619
Paul makes that declaration as he's speaking

00:08:02.619 --> 00:08:06.519
to the very people that Timothy is now ministering to.

00:08:06.519 --> 00:08:10.339
In Acts chapter number 20, Paul calls for the leaders

00:08:10.339 --> 00:08:13.679
of the church at Ephesus to gather together

00:08:13.679 --> 00:08:15.920
as he is on his way to Jerusalem,

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.220
and as he calls them to gather together,

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:21.119
he gives them some very important truth.

00:08:21.119 --> 00:08:26.119
But one thing that he tells them is that he had a desire,

00:08:26.399 --> 00:08:31.160
a purpose, to finish his course with joy.

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:36.679
We find this morning that now Timothy

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:40.359
is ministering in Ephesus, and Timothy is going

00:08:40.359 --> 00:08:45.359
to receive this charge from Paul to keep,

00:08:46.039 --> 00:08:51.039
to continue on, to do, to follow,

00:08:51.119 --> 00:08:54.520
and as he's encouraging him, as he's giving him this charge,

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:58.880
he's gonna provide motivation and encouragement

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:03.640
so that he too might finish his course.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:07.020
This morning, I desire to finish my course with joy.

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:10.479
I hope this morning that that's your desire as well.

00:09:10.479 --> 00:09:12.080
I wanna finish strong.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.359
I wanna finish what God has given me to do.

00:09:14.359 --> 00:09:17.159
You know, there are a lot of people that start a race.

00:09:21.359 --> 00:09:23.359
It's not about whether you start at the race.

00:09:23.359 --> 00:09:25.760
Now, that's important, but we're only gonna talk

00:09:25.919 --> 00:09:28.799
about finishing, finishing.

00:09:28.799 --> 00:09:30.159
This morning, I've titled the message,

00:09:30.159 --> 00:09:31.919
if you look at the back of the bulletin,

00:09:31.919 --> 00:09:33.679
really hear from our text of scripture.

00:09:33.679 --> 00:09:36.119
Notice in verse number 15, I read verse 13 and 14.

00:09:36.119 --> 00:09:39.359
Look at verse 15, which in his times he shall show

00:09:39.359 --> 00:09:41.919
who is the blessed and only potentate,

00:09:41.919 --> 00:09:45.840
the King of kings and Lord of lords.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.840
You know what the Apostle Paul is going to do here

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:49.000
in this text of scripture?

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.679
He's going to exalt and magnify the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:09:52.679 --> 00:09:55.739
just like he does in Hebrews 12 and verse two,

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:57.419
and as we're running that race,

00:09:57.419 --> 00:10:00.739
he says it in verse number one of Hebrews 12.

00:10:00.739 --> 00:10:02.439
he talks about the race.

00:10:02.439 --> 00:10:05.739
He says at the end of the verse, he says this,

00:10:05.739 --> 00:10:08.759
let us run with patience the race that is set before us,

00:10:08.759 --> 00:10:12.819
looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith.

00:10:12.819 --> 00:10:15.559
And here in 1 Timothy chapter number six,

00:10:15.559 --> 00:10:19.679
I believe there are three particular truths

00:10:19.679 --> 00:10:23.759
that Paul gives to Timothy to motivate and encourage him,

00:10:23.759 --> 00:10:25.999
but what he's doing is he's elevating

00:10:25.999 --> 00:10:28.919
and magnifying the Lord Jesus Christ, why?

00:10:28.919 --> 00:10:31.439
Because he's the one that we're running for.

00:10:31.439 --> 00:10:33.079
He's the one that we're running for.

00:10:33.079 --> 00:10:34.679
You know, you're not running for me,

00:10:34.679 --> 00:10:36.679
you're not running for your spouse,

00:10:36.679 --> 00:10:37.999
you're not running for your children,

00:10:37.999 --> 00:10:39.079
you're not running for your parents,

00:10:39.079 --> 00:10:41.599
you're not running for, you're running for Jesus,

00:10:41.599 --> 00:10:43.539
you're running for the Lord.

00:10:43.539 --> 00:10:46.959
And we find that if Paul is going to understand

00:10:46.959 --> 00:10:48.559
what Timothy is going to endure,

00:10:48.559 --> 00:10:51.519
and obviously he does because he's given

00:10:51.519 --> 00:10:53.879
throughout these six chapters of this book,

00:10:53.879 --> 00:10:56.879
this letter to Timothy, he's mentioned many things

00:10:56.879 --> 00:10:58.519
about some of the difficulties

00:10:58.519 --> 00:11:00.859
and understand with me this morning,

00:11:00.859 --> 00:11:04.599
that when those difficulties come, we can get overwhelmed.

00:11:04.599 --> 00:11:06.239
When those difficulties can come,

00:11:06.239 --> 00:11:11.239
we can be tempted to throw in the towel, so to speak.

00:11:11.379 --> 00:11:13.039
Those of you that ran a marathon,

00:11:13.039 --> 00:11:14.679
just a couple of you raised your hand,

00:11:14.679 --> 00:11:17.039
there was a point in that race,

00:11:17.039 --> 00:11:18.879
there was a point in that time

00:11:18.879 --> 00:11:22.679
that your body just wanted to stop.

00:11:22.679 --> 00:11:24.919
You had to push through, you had to continue.

00:11:25.759 --> 00:11:30.119
And we find this morning, these wonderful truths

00:11:30.119 --> 00:11:34.799
that point our attention to Jesus Christ.

00:11:34.799 --> 00:11:37.199
He is the one that we run for.

00:11:37.199 --> 00:11:39.279
He is the one that we live for.

00:11:39.279 --> 00:11:43.159
We sing the song, living for Jesus.

00:11:43.159 --> 00:11:45.319
My theme verse for my life,

00:11:45.319 --> 00:11:47.519
2 Corinthians 5 and verse number 15,

00:11:47.519 --> 00:11:50.899
and Mady has made some things for me over the years,

00:11:50.899 --> 00:11:53.519
knowing that that's my favorite Bible verse,

00:11:53.519 --> 00:11:54.679
and I've summarized it,

00:11:54.679 --> 00:11:56.319
because to write the whole verse out

00:11:56.319 --> 00:11:58.719
is just too much to put on a shirt or something.

00:11:58.719 --> 00:11:59.879
And I said it this way, I said,

00:11:59.879 --> 00:12:01.799
here's how I think we can summarize it,

00:12:01.799 --> 00:12:05.079
living for him who died for me.

00:12:05.079 --> 00:12:07.199
And that's really what our goal should be,

00:12:07.199 --> 00:12:10.919
because he is king of kings and Lord of lords.

00:12:10.919 --> 00:12:12.079
Notice with me as we dig

00:12:12.079 --> 00:12:13.839
into the text of scripture this morning,

00:12:13.839 --> 00:12:16.199
what does Paul first remind Timothy of

00:12:16.199 --> 00:12:17.879
when he's giving him this charge,

00:12:17.879 --> 00:12:19.599
as he's closing this letter,

00:12:19.599 --> 00:12:24.599
he reminds Timothy of God's power, his power.

00:12:25.479 --> 00:12:27.279
I'm so thankful this morning

00:12:27.279 --> 00:12:30.359
that we serve an omnipotent God,

00:12:30.359 --> 00:12:32.119
a God who has all power.

00:12:32.119 --> 00:12:33.459
I'm so thankful this morning

00:12:33.459 --> 00:12:35.119
that we serve a God who is able to do

00:12:35.119 --> 00:12:39.079
exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think.

00:12:39.079 --> 00:12:40.719
I'm so thankful this morning

00:12:40.719 --> 00:12:43.399
that our God appeared to Abraham

00:12:43.399 --> 00:12:46.599
and he announced himself that he is El Shaddai,

00:12:46.599 --> 00:12:48.319
the almighty God.

00:12:48.319 --> 00:12:50.039
And then a chapter later,

00:12:50.039 --> 00:12:55.039
he says to Abraham, is anything too hard for me?

00:12:55.239 --> 00:12:59.359
Obviously understanding that you're the Lord God almighty,

00:12:59.359 --> 00:13:03.919
that you are El Elyon, the strong one, the mighty one,

00:13:03.919 --> 00:13:07.119
that there's nothing outside of your power.

00:13:07.119 --> 00:13:10.599
There's no problem that's too big for God.

00:13:10.599 --> 00:13:12.419
And I'm so thankful this morning

00:13:12.419 --> 00:13:14.119
that as we are running this race,

00:13:14.119 --> 00:13:16.079
as we're given this charge to keep,

00:13:16.519 --> 00:13:19.199
to continue, that we're looking toward that finish line,

00:13:19.199 --> 00:13:21.719
that we understand that all the things

00:13:21.719 --> 00:13:22.999
that happen around us,

00:13:22.999 --> 00:13:26.679
that we're serving a God who has all power.

00:13:26.679 --> 00:13:28.159
He doesn't have most power.

00:13:28.159 --> 00:13:29.679
He doesn't have some power.

00:13:29.679 --> 00:13:31.239
He has all power.

00:13:31.239 --> 00:13:33.239
In fact, he says in Matthew 28,

00:13:33.239 --> 00:13:34.799
as he gives the great commission,

00:13:34.799 --> 00:13:38.959
all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.

00:13:38.959 --> 00:13:40.679
Go ye therefore.

00:13:40.679 --> 00:13:42.559
I mean, what a blessed truth.

00:13:42.559 --> 00:13:44.459
What an understanding that we have

00:13:44.459 --> 00:13:47.379
that our God has all power.

00:13:47.379 --> 00:13:48.659
Where do we see it here?

00:13:48.659 --> 00:13:50.779
Where notice with me in verse number 13,

00:13:50.779 --> 00:13:54.179
Paul says, I give the charge in the sight of God.

00:13:54.179 --> 00:13:58.179
And then notice this phrase, who quickeneth all things.

00:13:58.179 --> 00:14:02.299
Understand with me this morning that he alone gives life.

00:14:02.299 --> 00:14:04.139
He is the life giver.

00:14:04.139 --> 00:14:07.379
He has the power to give life.

00:14:07.379 --> 00:14:09.259
And I'm so thankful this morning

00:14:09.259 --> 00:14:11.639
that he is the life giver.

00:14:11.639 --> 00:14:14.519
Yes, we understand about this life that we have

00:14:14.519 --> 00:14:17.399
as we talk about being living beings,

00:14:17.399 --> 00:14:19.079
but I understand this morning

00:14:19.079 --> 00:14:21.119
that there's a focus that I have

00:14:21.119 --> 00:14:24.279
that goes beyond just the temporal life, if you will,

00:14:24.279 --> 00:14:25.880
and that's the eternal life,

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:29.039
that he is the author of eternal life.

00:14:29.039 --> 00:14:32.599
He is the only one that can provide salvation

00:14:32.599 --> 00:14:34.519
for a soul, for an individual.

00:14:34.519 --> 00:14:37.799
And I'm thankful this morning that he alone,

00:14:37.799 --> 00:14:41.440
he said, I am the way, the truth, and the life.

00:14:42.239 --> 00:14:45.279
No man cometh unto the Father but by me.

00:14:45.279 --> 00:14:47.599
There's no other name under heaven given among men

00:14:47.599 --> 00:14:49.579
whereby we must be saved.

00:14:49.579 --> 00:14:52.599
That's what Peter says as he's preaching there

00:14:52.599 --> 00:14:54.279
in Acts chapter number four.

00:14:54.279 --> 00:14:56.679
I'm thankful that not only does he give me

00:14:56.679 --> 00:14:58.959
this life here that I have,

00:14:58.959 --> 00:15:00.919
but he's given me eternal life.

00:15:00.919 --> 00:15:03.319
I was born, tomorrow's my birthday.

00:15:03.319 --> 00:15:05.979
I was born on July 15th, 1980.

00:15:05.979 --> 00:15:08.279
I'll be 44 years old tomorrow,

00:15:08.279 --> 00:15:11.279
but I'm telling you that I'm thankful for that.

00:15:12.119 --> 00:15:12.959
I'm thankful for that truth,

00:15:12.959 --> 00:15:15.359
but I am so much, just great thankfulness

00:15:15.359 --> 00:15:20.000
that on August 31st, 1997, I received eternal life.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.399
I was born again.

00:15:22.399 --> 00:15:24.639
See, to have one birth isn't enough.

00:15:26.559 --> 00:15:29.239
To be born once is to die twice.

00:15:29.239 --> 00:15:33.399
But if you're born twice, you only die once.

00:15:33.399 --> 00:15:35.479
Because the Bible tells me and tells you

00:15:35.479 --> 00:15:39.880
that the second death hath no power over us.

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:41.319
Hallelujah.

00:15:41.319 --> 00:15:42.559
I mean, I want you to think about it

00:15:42.559 --> 00:15:45.919
as we're thinking about the grind of life

00:15:45.919 --> 00:15:48.919
and Timothy has been receiving this instruction

00:15:48.919 --> 00:15:51.539
that there's false teachers there in Ephesus

00:15:51.539 --> 00:15:53.199
and there's these problems in Ephesus

00:15:53.199 --> 00:15:55.399
and Timothy, you gotta deal with all this stuff

00:15:55.399 --> 00:15:57.199
and it can become overwhelming and say,

00:15:57.199 --> 00:16:00.079
what, we're serving God.

00:16:00.079 --> 00:16:01.639
Continue, Timothy.

00:16:01.639 --> 00:16:02.859
Keep these things, Timothy.

00:16:02.859 --> 00:16:03.699
Why?

00:16:03.699 --> 00:16:06.220
Because you serve the Lord God Almighty.

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:09.660
You serve the God who is omnipotent.

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:11.979
We find that here in verse number 13,

00:16:11.979 --> 00:16:13.859
he says that he quickeneth all things,

00:16:13.859 --> 00:16:15.440
that he says before Christ Jesus,

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:20.299
who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession.

00:16:20.299 --> 00:16:23.099
Now, I think this is interesting as we look at this truth

00:16:23.099 --> 00:16:26.380
at the end of verse number 13 with regard to Jesus Christ

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:29.699
and the reference that is made as I look at this

00:16:29.699 --> 00:16:32.819
as God giving us the truth that he has all power.

00:16:32.819 --> 00:16:36.979
You know that it was there in John 19

00:16:36.979 --> 00:16:40.919
that Pontius Pilate thought he had some power.

00:16:41.899 --> 00:16:42.940
Do you remember?

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:45.500
In John chapter 19, maybe you wanna turn over there

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:47.399
and I'm gonna read a couple of verses of scripture

00:16:47.399 --> 00:16:48.940
for you from John 19.

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:51.179
Jesus Christ had already gone through

00:16:51.179 --> 00:16:54.619
the process of some trials and now he stood there

00:16:54.619 --> 00:16:57.160
before Pilate and all that's taken place

00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:00.539
and we find that Pilate had asked a question about truth

00:17:00.539 --> 00:17:05.179
and then he left and did not stick around for an answer

00:17:05.179 --> 00:17:07.059
and then we come to the 19th chapter

00:17:07.059 --> 00:17:09.500
and the trials continuing there before Pilate.

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:12.019
Pilate reenters into the presence.

00:17:12.019 --> 00:17:14.739
He said a couple of times at the end of verse 18

00:17:14.739 --> 00:17:16.459
and twice in the beginning of chapter 19,

00:17:16.459 --> 00:17:18.199
I find no fault in him.

00:17:18.199 --> 00:17:19.039
Why is that?

00:17:19.039 --> 00:17:21.739
Because he's the perfect Lamb of God.

00:17:21.739 --> 00:17:26.739
He is sinless, he is perfect, he is holy, he is pure.

00:17:27.979 --> 00:17:31.380
The just for the unjust.

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:34.459
He did not have to make a sacrifice first for his own sin.

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:37.339
He was sinless, he simply made a sacrifice

00:17:37.339 --> 00:17:40.179
for the sin of mankind.

00:17:40.179 --> 00:17:43.539
But we find in the text of scripture in verse number 10,

00:17:43.539 --> 00:17:44.619
I'll read verse number nine.

00:17:44.619 --> 00:17:47.579
And when again into the judgment hall and saith unto Jesus,

00:17:47.579 --> 00:17:49.380
whence art thou?

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:51.199
But Jesus gave him no answer.

00:17:52.299 --> 00:17:55.819
Then saith Pilate unto him, speakest thou not unto me?

00:17:55.819 --> 00:17:57.940
Notice what Pilate says.

00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:02.220
Knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:04.699
and have power to release thee?

00:18:04.699 --> 00:18:07.839
Now Pilate, I mean, from his perspective,

00:18:07.839 --> 00:18:09.419
he did have some power.

00:18:09.419 --> 00:18:12.339
But understand that Jesus is gonna set him straight.

00:18:12.339 --> 00:18:15.959
And Jesus is gonna help him understand a perspective

00:18:15.959 --> 00:18:19.039
that unfortunately sometimes humanity doesn't have.

00:18:19.039 --> 00:18:20.699
You know, there's some people on this earth

00:18:20.699 --> 00:18:23.059
that think they have power over people.

00:18:23.059 --> 00:18:26.759
Listen, I'm thankful that as Jesus says here to Pilate

00:18:26.759 --> 00:18:29.619
in verse number 11, Jesus does give an answer to this.

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:34.659
He says, thou couldest have no power at all against me

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:38.299
except it were given thee from above.

00:18:38.299 --> 00:18:40.380
Therefore he that delivered me unto thee

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:42.059
hath the greater sin.

00:18:42.059 --> 00:18:45.380
You know, I'm interested here in this text of scripture

00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:48.659
as we look at the truth that Paul is giving to Timothy.

00:18:48.659 --> 00:18:50.739
Continue, finish, why?

00:18:50.739 --> 00:18:52.899
Because our God has all power.

00:18:52.899 --> 00:18:54.820
Pilate said, I have power to crucify thee

00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:56.140
and I have power to release thee.

00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:58.459
And Jesus says, let me just help you understand.

00:18:58.459 --> 00:19:01.500
You could have no power at all except I give it to you

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:04.500
except it were given thee from above.

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:09.500
I'm thankful this morning that Jesus finished the work.

00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:11.739
He finished.

00:19:12.779 --> 00:19:15.140
He went all the way to Calvary,

00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:16.779
went all the way to the cross,

00:19:16.779 --> 00:19:19.260
suffered and bled and died.

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:21.419
As he hung upon that cross,

00:19:21.419 --> 00:19:22.979
several things that he cried out,

00:19:22.979 --> 00:19:27.539
but one was this, it is finished.

00:19:27.539 --> 00:19:29.140
Hallelujah.

00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:31.539
With that, he gave up the ghost.

00:19:31.539 --> 00:19:33.219
You know why it says that he gave up the ghost?

00:19:33.219 --> 00:19:35.539
Because he laid down his life.

00:19:35.539 --> 00:19:39.299
He willingly and freely offered his life

00:19:39.299 --> 00:19:41.739
as a substitute for humanity.

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:46.380
Otherwise we'd be on our way to the lake of fire

00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:48.260
with no hope whatsoever.

00:19:49.179 --> 00:19:50.380
He finished.

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:53.419
Notice with me back in 1 Timothy chapter number six,

00:19:53.419 --> 00:19:55.739
not only do we see that he quickeneth all things,

00:19:55.739 --> 00:19:57.539
he alone is the one who gives life.

00:19:57.539 --> 00:19:59.459
He witnessed a good confession,

00:19:59.459 --> 00:20:01.219
but notice it says this in verse.

00:20:01.219 --> 00:20:08.339
number 16, who only hath immortality. I want you to think about that. He is the

00:20:08.339 --> 00:20:11.459
one that not only has the power to give life, but he is the one that has power

00:20:11.459 --> 00:20:17.139
over death. He has power over death. The Bible tells us we understand as we read

00:20:17.139 --> 00:20:22.539
through the pages of Scripture that he conquered sin, death, and the grave. He

00:20:22.539 --> 00:20:29.339
triumphed over the enemy. He triumphed over Satan. We understand that he rose in

00:20:29.339 --> 00:20:33.819
victory. Listen, during his earthly ministry, we see his power displayed

00:20:33.819 --> 00:20:38.579
through the miracles, not only over nature and over disease, but we see his

00:20:38.579 --> 00:20:43.059
power displayed over death. When you come to John chapter number 11, and both Mary

00:20:43.059 --> 00:20:48.499
and Martha say, Jesus, if you had been here, our brother had not died. They

00:20:48.499 --> 00:20:53.579
understood that Jesus had power to heal. He had power over disease. That's why

00:20:53.579 --> 00:21:01.139
initially they even sent for Jesus, because their brother was sick. Jesus

00:21:01.139 --> 00:21:12.179
loved him, but Jesus delayed. He didn't leave immediately, and he arrives right

00:21:12.179 --> 00:21:19.779
on time, because he was going to show not only Mary and Martha, but all those that

00:21:19.779 --> 00:21:25.859
were gathered, that not only does he have power over disease, but he has power

00:21:25.859 --> 00:21:37.419
over death. And he says, roll that stone, he stinketh. He's been dead for four days.

00:21:37.419 --> 00:21:48.219
Is that not the objection? Jesus says, Lazarus, come forth. He tells him, take

00:21:48.219 --> 00:21:55.179
off the grave clothes and come walk. Could you imagine? Man, hallelujah. Listen, this

00:21:55.179 --> 00:22:01.499
morning, our God conquered sin, death, and the grave. We find that he makes this

00:22:01.499 --> 00:22:06.179
statement. You don't need to turn there in Revelation chapter 1, in verse 18, it

00:22:06.179 --> 00:22:11.859
says, I am he that liveth and was dead. Behold, I am alive forevermore, amen, and

00:22:12.419 --> 00:22:19.019
have the keys of hell and of death. I'm thankful this morning that the one for

00:22:19.019 --> 00:22:25.299
whom we are running has all power. What motivation and encouragement that we

00:22:25.299 --> 00:22:30.739
receive through this reminder. Number two, we understand his position. We see his

00:22:30.739 --> 00:22:34.739
power, but then we also see in 1st Timothy chapter 6, his position. Notice

00:22:34.739 --> 00:22:39.979
with me, in verse number 15, it says, in which in his times he shall show who is

00:22:39.979 --> 00:22:47.339
the blessed and only potentate. The word literally means the only all-powerful

00:22:47.339 --> 00:22:50.779
one. That's what it means, the only all-powerful one. By the way, there's

00:22:50.779 --> 00:23:01.619
none like him. There's none like our God. He alone reigns. He alone is God. We find

00:23:01.619 --> 00:23:05.839
this morning that here in the text of Scripture, it says, not only who is the

00:23:05.839 --> 00:23:11.439
blessed and only potentate, the king of kings and Lord of lords. We read those

00:23:11.439 --> 00:23:16.079
names ascribed to the Lord Jesus Christ in Revelation 17, in verse 14. We read it

00:23:16.079 --> 00:23:23.079
in chapter 19, in verse number 16, that he is king of kings and Lord of lords. I

00:23:23.079 --> 00:23:28.359
mean, what a contrast that is given to us in verse 15 about our Lord, about the one

00:23:28.359 --> 00:23:34.039
who we're running for, the one that we're having our eyes on, compared

00:23:34.039 --> 00:23:40.639
the contrast to the Roman emperors that would have been obviously known during

00:23:40.639 --> 00:23:46.679
that day. No, no, no, no. Listen, we're serving God. We're not serving some man.

00:23:46.679 --> 00:23:50.879
We're not running a race for some man. We're not running a race for some Roman

00:23:50.879 --> 00:23:56.679
emperor. No, we're running the race for the only, that he is the blessed and only

00:23:56.679 --> 00:24:01.959
potentate. We're running a race for the king of kings and Lord of lords.

00:24:02.359 --> 00:24:09.079
Hallelujah. His position. In Isaiah 52, in verse number 7, the Bible says,

00:24:09.079 --> 00:24:16.719
thy God reigneth. Aren't you thankful this morning that our God is on his throne?

00:24:16.719 --> 00:24:22.239
We read in Revelation 19, in verse number 6, hallelujah, for the Lord God

00:24:22.239 --> 00:24:28.799
omnipotent reigneth. It really reminds me of how Paul, in the first chapter of 1

00:24:28.799 --> 00:24:33.959
Timothy, turned back, if you will. It was our January memory verse.

00:24:33.959 --> 00:24:38.719
As Paul says this, in 1 Timothy 1 and verse 17, under the inspiration of the Holy

00:24:38.719 --> 00:24:47.399
Spirit of God, now under the king eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God,

00:24:47.399 --> 00:24:55.679
be honor and glory forever and ever. Listen, he's the one that we're running

00:24:55.759 --> 00:25:01.199
for. He's the one that we got to have our eyes on. If Timothy is going to continue,

00:25:01.199 --> 00:25:05.919
if Timothy is going to finish his course like Paul is going to finish his course,

00:25:05.919 --> 00:25:10.359
if you are going to finish your course, if I am going to finish my course,

00:25:10.359 --> 00:25:16.279
I must remember this morning, I must have this awareness this morning that he has

00:25:16.279 --> 00:25:20.399
all power and he's the one that I'm running for. I must recognize this morning

00:25:20.399 --> 00:25:24.799
and I must regularly remind myself of his position. Listen, we live in a world that's

00:25:24.799 --> 00:25:31.439
chaotic. We live in a world that it seems like evil is just everywhere and ruling,

00:25:31.439 --> 00:25:36.279
but understand that the heathen, they rage according to Psalm chapter number 2.

00:25:36.279 --> 00:25:41.079
But you know what God's doing? He's sitting on his throne in Psalm 2.

00:25:41.079 --> 00:25:44.399
He's not worried. He's not up in...you know what happens sometimes when we worry?

00:25:44.399 --> 00:25:48.079
Sometimes people will kind of ring their...God's not ringing his hands.

00:25:48.079 --> 00:25:52.119
God's not worried. God's not concerned. God's not sitting up in heaven saying,

00:25:52.119 --> 00:25:58.279
what are we going to do? No, he's God and he reigns and he's in control.

00:25:58.279 --> 00:26:09.399
His position motivates me. It encourages me because I'm running a race for God Almighty

00:26:09.399 --> 00:26:15.439
who's on his throne. This morning, as we look at the text of Scripture,

00:26:15.439 --> 00:26:22.279
we see not only that Paul reminds Timothy of the power of God, the position that God

00:26:22.279 --> 00:26:28.599
has, but he reminds him, number 3, of God's plan. I'm so thankful this morning that God

00:26:28.599 --> 00:26:36.159
has a plan. Have you ever made a plan? Sure you have. You have plans. Have you ever made

00:26:36.159 --> 00:26:42.879
plans that didn't kind of go the way that you had hoped they would go? Sure you have.

00:26:42.879 --> 00:26:48.599
There was a wrinkle. There was something that was unexpected. There was something you

00:26:48.599 --> 00:26:55.979
didn't plan for. Something that was outside of your control. You know why that's the case?

00:26:55.979 --> 00:27:03.839
Because we're mere men. We try to make plans, but we don't know what's on tomorrow. Right?

00:27:03.839 --> 00:27:11.519
We try to make plans, but we can't control all the circumstances. But our God is outside

00:27:11.519 --> 00:27:20.359
of time. Our God is the all-powerful one. Our God has a plan that nobody is going to

00:27:20.359 --> 00:27:26.599
alter. No one can. You know they've been trying to alter His plan. I mean the enemy. They've

00:27:26.599 --> 00:27:30.999
been trying to alter His plan throughout. If you read the page of the Old Testament,

00:27:30.999 --> 00:27:34.879
even as you get into the New Testament, you begin to see how the enemy is trying to thwart

00:27:35.039 --> 00:27:42.239
plan of God through all sorts of means. But understand with me this morning that at every

00:27:42.239 --> 00:27:49.879
time the enemy has been unsuccessful. Why? Because God's plan is going to come to pass.

00:27:49.879 --> 00:27:57.479
It is absolutely certain. Amen? I'm sure that you've made plans that you thought,

00:27:57.479 --> 00:28:05.959
man, I went to, I mean, extremes to ensure that everything is going to happen. And then

00:28:05.959 --> 00:28:09.399
the disappointment that comes when it doesn't work out the way that you thought it would.

00:28:09.399 --> 00:28:16.319
It doesn't happen to God. Nothing has ever occurred to Him. He knows everything. Nothing's

00:28:16.319 --> 00:28:22.879
ever surprised Him. He knows everything. I've said at times, and I'm sure you have as you've

00:28:23.319 --> 00:28:32.719
sought to see your plan unfold, why I didn't think about that. It's never happened to God.

00:28:32.719 --> 00:28:37.959
Notice His plan as it's given to us here in verse number 14. It says that thou keep this

00:28:37.959 --> 00:28:45.759
commandment without spot, unrebukable notice until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:28:45.759 --> 00:28:53.279
Now obviously God's plan goes beyond just His return, but here within the context of

00:28:53.279 --> 00:28:59.519
1 Timothy chapter number 6, the aspect that is highlighted of God's plan that's given

00:28:59.519 --> 00:29:05.079
to us here with regard to the charge that is issued to Timothy is the fact that Jesus

00:29:05.079 --> 00:29:14.000
is coming again until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ. I believe as we look throughout

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:20.359
the pages of Scripture how we can rejoice in understanding this truth with regard to

00:29:20.359 --> 00:29:26.399
the return of Jesus Christ. The fact that He said in John chapter number 14, let not

00:29:26.399 --> 00:29:31.199
your heart be troubled. You believe in God, believe also in Me. In My Father's house are

00:29:31.199 --> 00:29:35.299
many mansions. If it were not so, I would have told you. And then He says this, I go

00:29:35.299 --> 00:29:43.399
to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again

00:29:43.399 --> 00:29:50.319
and receive you unto Myself that where I am, there ye may be also. Isn't that a wonderful

00:29:50.319 --> 00:29:57.679
promise? He had given to the disciples in John chapter 13 much information with regard

00:29:57.679 --> 00:30:01.279
to His going and being crucified and all that would take place.

00:30:01.279 --> 00:30:06.199
and they were overwhelmed, but he says let not your heart be troubled. Listen,

00:30:06.199 --> 00:30:11.039
there is no one, there is no situation, there is no circumstance that is going

00:30:11.039 --> 00:30:17.039
to keep our God from coming back. Now I understand this morning that many times

00:30:17.039 --> 00:30:22.599
we pray as John did, even so come Lord Jesus, we're looking for his

00:30:22.599 --> 00:30:26.679
return, we're looking for his soon return, but understand that he's not coming back

00:30:26.679 --> 00:30:31.759
on your timetable or on my timetable. He's coming back at the exact right

00:30:31.759 --> 00:30:36.559
moment. Now would I like to be alive when it happens? Hallelujah.

00:30:36.559 --> 00:30:40.039
We'll look at that passage in just a moment of 1 Thessalonians, what a great

00:30:40.039 --> 00:30:43.599
truth it is, but I want to remind you of what happened in Acts chapter number 1.

00:30:43.599 --> 00:30:49.159
See this is a truth that goes throughout the the New Testament, the church as we

00:30:49.159 --> 00:30:54.039
have understood this teaching of the return of the Lord Jesus Christ, and even

00:30:54.039 --> 00:30:58.479
as Paul would give this charge to Timothy in motivating him and

00:30:58.479 --> 00:31:05.199
encouraging him, why? Because Jesus is coming again. In Acts chapter number 1,

00:31:05.199 --> 00:31:12.159
the resurrection had already taken place, Jesus was there for 40 days, and he was

00:31:12.159 --> 00:31:17.559
teaching and all that he was doing, and now he's going to ascend to heaven. He

00:31:17.559 --> 00:31:22.999
gives the Great Commission, it's recorded in Acts chapter 1 and verse number 8, and

00:31:22.999 --> 00:31:26.799
in verse 9, as soon as he finishes giving the Great Commission, this is when

00:31:26.799 --> 00:31:31.599
he'd spoken these things, while they beheld he was taken up, and a cloud

00:31:31.599 --> 00:31:36.879
received him out of their sight. And while they looked steadfastly toward

00:31:36.879 --> 00:31:41.479
heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel, which

00:31:41.479 --> 00:31:47.439
also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? Notice these

00:31:47.439 --> 00:31:55.239
words, this saying Jesus, which has taken up from you into heaven, shall so come

00:31:55.239 --> 00:32:04.919
in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven. I believe that this truth

00:32:04.919 --> 00:32:10.159
that is given in Acts 1 and verse 11 served as a great motivator for the

00:32:10.159 --> 00:32:15.279
early church. You read the book of Acts and you can read that even the

00:32:15.279 --> 00:32:21.839
opposition of the disciples, those that opposed Christianity, if you will, that

00:32:21.839 --> 00:32:26.599
they say of the disciples that you have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine. And

00:32:26.599 --> 00:32:31.599
then later in chapter 17, they say that they've turned the world upside down.

00:32:31.599 --> 00:32:36.239
These that have turned the world upside down have come hither also. And we find

00:32:36.239 --> 00:32:40.159
that as you look at those truths that are mentioned, those statements that are

00:32:40.159 --> 00:32:44.959
given, even from those that oppose the work, that they're acknowledging that the

00:32:44.959 --> 00:32:49.799
early church was a church that was motivated to get the gospel to every

00:32:49.799 --> 00:32:56.279
creature. Why? Because Jesus is coming back. The last thing they heard before he

00:32:56.279 --> 00:33:00.799
ascended to heaven and before the angels said he's going to come back in like

00:33:00.799 --> 00:33:08.599
manner was, ye shall be witnesses unto me, both in Jerusalem and Judea and Samaria

00:33:08.599 --> 00:33:14.119
and unto the uttermost part of the earth. That's what the Lord has commissioned us

00:33:14.159 --> 00:33:21.759
to do. Now many today, when is he going to come back? People have written books

00:33:21.759 --> 00:33:27.479
trying to set a time. You can go on the internet and I do not suggest that you

00:33:27.479 --> 00:33:32.719
do. Go back to my message from 1 Timothy chapter number 4, how's your diet? You

00:33:32.719 --> 00:33:35.199
got to be careful what you're watching and what you're listening to, what you're

00:33:35.199 --> 00:33:41.319
reading. There's a lot of stuff out there that's not for us to consume. There's

00:33:41.319 --> 00:33:46.519
people that have all kinds of theories and this thing happens and that happens

00:33:46.519 --> 00:33:50.399
and all these things with regard to, listen, I don't know when he's coming but

00:33:50.399 --> 00:33:54.799
I know he's coming. And you know what the amazing thing is? I don't really need to

00:33:54.799 --> 00:33:59.599
know when he's coming. And actually it's better for us if we don't know when he's

00:33:59.599 --> 00:34:04.879
coming because it motivates us to do what we're supposed to do. Because as I

00:34:04.879 --> 00:34:09.679
understand that I want to be found faithful, I want to be found when he

00:34:09.679 --> 00:34:14.759
returns doing what I'm supposed to be doing, I do not want, as we read in 1

00:34:14.759 --> 00:34:21.759
John 2 and chapter 3, I do not desire to be ashamed of him at his appearing. Amen?

00:34:21.759 --> 00:34:32.199
So Paul says to Timothy, keep. Keep doing. Fulfill. Continue. For how long? Until the

00:34:32.199 --> 00:34:39.039
appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ. Finish strong. Finish well. 1 Thessalonians

00:34:39.039 --> 00:34:44.959
chapter 4, a favorite passage of Scripture, as I look here and consider

00:34:44.959 --> 00:34:50.799
this truth of our Lord Jesus Christ coming back and I'll get to the mockers

00:34:50.799 --> 00:34:56.199
and the scoffers in just a moment. We find in 1 Thessalonians 4 and verse 13,

00:34:56.199 --> 00:35:07.439
the Bible begins by saying this, but I would not have you to be

00:35:07.439 --> 00:35:13.559
ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that you sorrow not even as

00:35:13.559 --> 00:35:18.279
others which have no hope. I don't want you to be ignorant, I want you to be

00:35:18.279 --> 00:35:23.079
informed. I want you to understand something. I want you to have truth

00:35:23.079 --> 00:35:28.799
regarding those that are asleep, those who have died. And he says this, that you

00:35:28.799 --> 00:35:34.759
sorrow not even as others which have no hope. So obviously we understand that the

00:35:34.759 --> 00:35:38.759
book is written to a local church, the church of Thessalonica. A church is made

00:35:38.759 --> 00:35:43.639
up of individuals that have been saved and baptized. They are the people of God.

00:35:43.639 --> 00:35:48.639
They're Christians. They're heaven-bound. And we find that he says in verse number

00:35:48.639 --> 00:35:53.999
14, for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, and we do, even so them also

00:35:53.999 --> 00:35:59.399
which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. For this we say unto you, notice

00:35:59.399 --> 00:36:04.999
these words, by the word of the Lord. This is not Paul sitting up at a Q&A

00:36:04.999 --> 00:36:08.439
time and saying, well let me give you my opinion, here's what I think is going to

00:36:08.439 --> 00:36:16.639
happen. No. Paul says I'm telling you this by the word of the Lord, that we which

00:36:16.639 --> 00:36:21.279
are alive and remain under the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which

00:36:21.279 --> 00:36:25.919
are asleep. Now I hope I'm part of that group. Amen? I really do. I think it'd be

00:36:25.999 --> 00:36:31.679
awesome to be alive when the trumpet of the Lord sounds. I really do. But I don't

00:36:31.679 --> 00:36:39.159
know. I could die tomorrow. I could die today. We have no idea. David said there's

00:36:39.159 --> 00:36:47.159
but a step between me and death. And that's true for every single human being.

00:36:47.159 --> 00:36:51.239
Says that we shall not prevent them which are asleep or go before them. Verse 16, for

00:36:51.239 --> 00:36:56.279
the Lord himself, remember what it said in Acts 1 and verse 11, this same Jesus.

00:36:56.279 --> 00:37:01.839
Listen, he's not sending an angel. Amen? He's coming himself. In verse 16, for the

00:37:01.839 --> 00:37:05.919
Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the

00:37:05.919 --> 00:37:11.559
archangel, with the trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first. Then we

00:37:11.559 --> 00:37:14.999
which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the

00:37:14.999 --> 00:37:20.479
clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore,

00:37:20.599 --> 00:37:25.239
notice verse 18, comfort one another with these words, how comforting these words

00:37:25.239 --> 00:37:35.639
are. I'm thankful this morning that my God has a plan. His plan is extensive. For

00:37:35.639 --> 00:37:41.959
sake of the message this morning, the aspect of God's plan that is zeroed in

00:37:41.959 --> 00:37:49.079
on is his return. His return. Why is it that that aspect of the plan of God

00:37:49.079 --> 00:37:53.199
would be zeroed in on? Because there's a motivation, there's an encouragement

00:37:53.199 --> 00:37:58.919
that's given to Timothy with regard to continue to do what God has called

00:37:58.919 --> 00:38:04.439
him to do. And as he's going to receive this charge and as this motivation and

00:38:04.439 --> 00:38:09.039
this encouragement is given, there's an understanding that Timothy, you have

00:38:09.039 --> 00:38:14.879
to remember that our God has all power. You have to remember, Timothy,

00:38:14.879 --> 00:38:20.959
that our God, he is on his throne. His position is that he is King of kings and

00:38:20.959 --> 00:38:26.879
Lord of lords. And Timothy, you have to remember that God has a plan. And God's

00:38:26.879 --> 00:38:29.999
plan is that he's coming back. That's part of his plan. Remember I said a

00:38:29.999 --> 00:38:33.519
moment ago that there are scoffers and there are mockers according to what we

00:38:33.519 --> 00:38:38.919
read in 2 Peter. The Bible says that these folks were there in the first

00:38:38.919 --> 00:38:42.999
century. Can I tell you this morning they continue to be here in our day and age

00:38:42.999 --> 00:38:47.119
as well. In 2 Peter chapter number 3, these scoffers and mockers and they're

00:38:47.119 --> 00:38:52.599
asking about when is the time of his appearing. In 2 Peter chapter 3,

00:38:52.599 --> 00:38:58.319
beginning in verse number 1, the Bible says, The second epistle, beloved, I now

00:38:58.319 --> 00:39:03.279
write unto you, in both which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance.

00:39:03.279 --> 00:39:07.759
They may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets

00:39:07.759 --> 00:39:12.199
under the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Savior, knowing this

00:39:12.199 --> 00:39:17.479
first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own

00:39:17.479 --> 00:39:22.799
lust. And here's what it says that they'll say, Where is the promise of his

00:39:22.799 --> 00:39:27.919
coming? Where's the promise of his coming? And notice the rest of the verse says

00:39:27.919 --> 00:39:32.159
this, For since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from

00:39:32.159 --> 00:39:35.679
the beginning of the creation. So they're going to say where's the promise of his

00:39:35.679 --> 00:39:38.999
coming and they're gonna try to to cloak that if you will with this

00:39:38.999 --> 00:39:42.959
statement that everything continues as it ever has been. And then in verse 5,

00:39:42.959 --> 00:39:49.519
it's interesting, it says this, For this they willingly are ignorant of. You know

00:39:49.519 --> 00:39:55.199
there are some people that we come in contact with that are willingly ignorant.

00:39:55.199 --> 00:40:02.039
It's almost as if they would say it this way, Don't confuse me with the facts.

00:40:02.039 --> 00:40:03.459
Don't confuse me with the truth.

00:40:03.459 --> 00:40:04.299
Why?

00:40:04.299 --> 00:40:06.499
Because I wanna believe what I wanna believe.

00:40:07.859 --> 00:40:09.379
And I wanna believe what I wanna believe

00:40:09.379 --> 00:40:13.259
regardless of what anyone says including God and his word

00:40:13.259 --> 00:40:15.739
because I already have settled what I wanna believe.

00:40:15.739 --> 00:40:17.759
And so of this they are willingly ignorant.

00:40:17.759 --> 00:40:20.659
Notice it continues that by the word of God

00:40:20.659 --> 00:40:22.219
the heavens were of old

00:40:22.219 --> 00:40:24.979
and the earth standing out of the water and in the water

00:40:24.979 --> 00:40:27.139
whereby the world that then was being overflowed

00:40:27.139 --> 00:40:27.979
with water perished.

00:40:27.979 --> 00:40:28.799
Now what's he talking about?

00:40:28.799 --> 00:40:29.639
The flood.

00:40:29.639 --> 00:40:32.699
Do you know how many people are attacking

00:40:32.699 --> 00:40:35.379
the Genesis record of the flood?

00:40:35.379 --> 00:40:36.219
Why are they attacking it?

00:40:36.219 --> 00:40:38.019
You say, pastors, just Genesis doesn't really matter.

00:40:38.019 --> 00:40:40.659
Oh, it matters so much

00:40:40.659 --> 00:40:42.579
because if the Genesis record isn't true

00:40:42.579 --> 00:40:45.699
then how do we know anything is true?

00:40:48.699 --> 00:40:51.099
Verse seven, but the heavens and the earth

00:40:51.099 --> 00:40:54.259
which are now by the same word are kept in store

00:40:55.139 --> 00:40:57.779
reserved under the fire against the day of judgment

00:40:57.799 --> 00:41:00.079
and the perdition of ungodly men.

00:41:00.079 --> 00:41:01.479
But then in verse eight it says this,

00:41:01.479 --> 00:41:05.119
but beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing

00:41:06.079 --> 00:41:08.539
that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years

00:41:08.539 --> 00:41:10.959
and a thousand years as one day.

00:41:10.959 --> 00:41:12.599
Now why does he say that?

00:41:12.599 --> 00:41:16.039
Well, we are bound by time.

00:41:17.079 --> 00:41:21.399
Everything that we do is time-sensitive.

00:41:21.399 --> 00:41:24.159
You buy a product, there's an expiration date.

00:41:24.159 --> 00:41:26.679
Right, am I not telling the truth?

00:41:26.679 --> 00:41:30.099
But listen, bottled water has an expiration date.

00:41:30.099 --> 00:41:31.359
It does.

00:41:31.359 --> 00:41:32.259
It's like five years,

00:41:32.259 --> 00:41:34.259
but I mean, it's got an expiration date.

00:41:35.379 --> 00:41:37.579
Milk has an expiration date.

00:41:37.579 --> 00:41:40.259
Cheat, I mean, you go through it, it has an expiration date.

00:41:40.259 --> 00:41:43.339
Everything that we do is bound by time.

00:41:44.179 --> 00:41:45.979
Sometimes it's so hard with children,

00:41:45.979 --> 00:41:46.859
they don't understand time.

00:41:46.859 --> 00:41:48.519
How many of you can remember when you're little kids,

00:41:48.519 --> 00:41:50.499
they wanna know, especially if you're taking a road trip,

00:41:50.499 --> 00:41:51.959
are we there yet?

00:41:51.959 --> 00:41:53.079
20 more minutes.

00:41:53.079 --> 00:41:55.499
They don't know what 20 minutes is.

00:41:55.499 --> 00:41:57.639
20 minutes to my kids was a long time.

00:41:59.959 --> 00:42:02.479
But understand that as we grow older,

00:42:02.479 --> 00:42:04.919
we get a greater awareness of time.

00:42:06.239 --> 00:42:11.239
You start talking in measurements of time of months

00:42:12.379 --> 00:42:13.799
to a little kid.

00:42:13.799 --> 00:42:16.819
Well, we're gonna go on vacation in nine months.

00:42:16.819 --> 00:42:18.239
They can't understand that.

00:42:19.499 --> 00:42:21.799
But for us, nine months is like that.

00:42:22.799 --> 00:42:26.139
It's July, it's the middle of July right now.

00:42:26.139 --> 00:42:28.099
It seems like we just were having a new year, right?

00:42:28.099 --> 00:42:29.739
It just goes so quick.

00:42:32.059 --> 00:42:33.819
But see, God is outside of time.

00:42:35.859 --> 00:42:37.379
And so he says this in verse number nine,

00:42:37.379 --> 00:42:42.379
the Lord is not slack concerning his promise.

00:42:43.259 --> 00:42:45.439
I love that terminology, why?

00:42:45.439 --> 00:42:50.439
Because every promise that God has given will come to pass.

00:42:51.419 --> 00:42:53.979
He is not slack concerning his promise.

00:42:53.979 --> 00:42:55.539
I don't know if you've ever said something

00:42:55.539 --> 00:42:57.299
that then you kind of step back and you regret it,

00:42:57.299 --> 00:42:58.939
saying it, saying, man, I wish I didn't say that.

00:42:58.939 --> 00:43:01.299
I wish, not that it was a sinful thing,

00:43:01.299 --> 00:43:03.779
but you made a commitment, you made a promise.

00:43:03.779 --> 00:43:05.499
I remember promising Juliana something

00:43:05.499 --> 00:43:06.359
when she was a little girl.

00:43:06.359 --> 00:43:07.879
I've used the illustration before.

00:43:07.879 --> 00:43:10.159
I told her, Bart, I promise on Saturday

00:43:10.159 --> 00:43:11.459
we're gonna go do this.

00:43:13.299 --> 00:43:17.079
And Saturday came and it was pouring rain.

00:43:18.459 --> 00:43:19.919
And the activity was outside.

00:43:21.139 --> 00:43:23.179
We weren't gonna be able to do it.

00:43:23.179 --> 00:43:24.699
You know, she looked at me and she said,

00:43:24.699 --> 00:43:27.939
but daddy, you promised.

00:43:29.939 --> 00:43:32.419
Man, that was, I did.

00:43:34.259 --> 00:43:36.999
And I said, honey, I'm not God.

00:43:37.899 --> 00:43:41.059
I have no control over this.

00:43:41.059 --> 00:43:42.579
I said, Jesus, this is what I told her.

00:43:42.579 --> 00:43:45.219
I said, Jesus, when he was in the midst of the storm,

00:43:45.219 --> 00:43:48.219
he was able to say, peace be still.

00:43:48.279 --> 00:43:50.959
And the winds and the waves obeyed and it was calm.

00:43:50.959 --> 00:43:53.599
But daddy doesn't have that kind of power.

00:43:53.599 --> 00:43:54.679
I told her that.

00:43:56.079 --> 00:43:56.919
And she kind of calmed down.

00:43:56.919 --> 00:43:57.739
But you know what I learned?

00:43:57.739 --> 00:43:59.399
I didn't promise her anything anymore.

00:43:59.399 --> 00:44:02.959
I didn't.

00:44:02.959 --> 00:44:04.899
I'll do my best to do that.

00:44:04.899 --> 00:44:06.039
We'll plan to do that.

00:44:06.039 --> 00:44:08.599
But I tried to take that word promise out

00:44:10.199 --> 00:44:11.919
because I can't control the circumstances,

00:44:11.919 --> 00:44:14.239
but God controls everything.

00:44:14.239 --> 00:44:16.359
The Lord is not slack concerning his promises.

00:44:16.359 --> 00:44:17.679
Some men cannot slackness,

00:44:18.179 --> 00:44:19.739
but his long suffering to us word.

00:44:19.739 --> 00:44:22.579
Notice where it says, not willing that any should perish,

00:44:22.579 --> 00:44:24.619
but that all should come to repentance.

00:44:24.619 --> 00:44:26.019
Why hasn't he come back yet?

00:44:26.019 --> 00:44:27.579
Because he's long suffering.

00:44:28.819 --> 00:44:31.259
Remember what Paul told Timothy in the beginning

00:44:31.259 --> 00:44:33.219
of this book of 1 Timothy.

00:44:33.219 --> 00:44:36.579
He said, this is a faithful saying

00:44:36.579 --> 00:44:37.939
and worthy of all acceptation

00:44:37.939 --> 00:44:39.679
that Christ Jesus came into the world

00:44:39.679 --> 00:44:42.019
to save sinners of whom I am chief.

00:44:42.019 --> 00:44:45.379
So Jesus came to save humanity.

00:44:45.379 --> 00:44:48.639
And so he has a desire for people to be saved.

00:44:48.639 --> 00:44:50.259
And that of course is his plan.

00:44:50.259 --> 00:44:53.679
And so with regard to the aspect of the plan of his return,

00:44:53.679 --> 00:44:55.519
he's not slack concerning his promise.

00:44:55.519 --> 00:44:59.119
He is going to come back, but he's long suffering.

00:44:59.119 --> 00:44:59.959
Why?

00:44:59.959 --> 00:45:00.959
Because he's not willing that any should perish,

00:45:00.959 --> 00:45:03.919
but that all should come to repentance.

00:45:03.919 --> 00:45:05.919
Back in the text of scripture,

00:45:05.919 --> 00:45:08.679
it says in verse 16 in 1 Timothy 6,

00:45:08.679 --> 00:45:11.579
who only hath immortality dwelling in the light,

00:45:11.579 --> 00:45:14.579
which no man can approach unto whom no man hath seen,

00:45:14.599 --> 00:45:18.899
nor can see to whom be honor and power everlasting.

00:45:18.899 --> 00:45:19.739
Amen.

00:45:19.739 --> 00:45:20.799
Isn't that exciting?

00:45:20.799 --> 00:45:22.999
I mean, just the climax, if you will,

00:45:22.999 --> 00:45:25.879
of how this charge is given.

00:45:25.879 --> 00:45:28.479
The text continues in verse 17

00:45:28.479 --> 00:45:29.879
through the end of the chapter,

00:45:29.879 --> 00:45:32.079
really highlighting on some truth

00:45:32.079 --> 00:45:34.879
with regard to now giving a charge to those

00:45:34.879 --> 00:45:36.999
that's already been referenced earlier in the chapter

00:45:36.999 --> 00:45:40.159
in verse 17, charge them that are rich in this world.

00:45:40.159 --> 00:45:42.879
Now, remember the problem of verse number nine

00:45:42.879 --> 00:45:44.159
was not they that are rich,

00:45:44.659 --> 00:45:45.779
but they that will be rich.

00:45:45.779 --> 00:45:47.019
That's their motivation.

00:45:47.019 --> 00:45:48.139
That's their drive.

00:45:48.139 --> 00:45:49.899
That's all they're consumed with.

00:45:49.899 --> 00:45:52.499
It's not a problem to be rich.

00:45:52.499 --> 00:45:55.979
It's a problem if that's our driving, motivating,

00:45:55.979 --> 00:45:59.139
all I'm living for is to get rich.

00:45:59.139 --> 00:45:59.959
That's a problem.

00:45:59.959 --> 00:46:02.279
But so he says, charge them that are rich in the world,

00:46:02.279 --> 00:46:03.899
that they be not high-minded,

00:46:03.899 --> 00:46:06.659
nor trust in their uncertain riches.

00:46:06.659 --> 00:46:07.699
You know, there's a lot of people

00:46:07.699 --> 00:46:09.999
that trust in uncertain riches.

00:46:11.059 --> 00:46:12.099
But what?

00:46:12.099 --> 00:46:13.799
In the living God.

00:46:14.179 --> 00:46:15.139
In the living God.

00:46:15.139 --> 00:46:16.899
Who?

00:46:16.899 --> 00:46:20.319
Giveth us richly all things to enjoy.

00:46:20.319 --> 00:46:23.779
I'm thankful that our God is a benevolent God.

00:46:23.779 --> 00:46:24.939
He's a giving God.

00:46:25.819 --> 00:46:27.139
For God so loved the world

00:46:27.139 --> 00:46:30.259
that he gave his only begotten Son,

00:46:30.259 --> 00:46:32.019
that whosoever believeth in him should not perish,

00:46:32.019 --> 00:46:34.479
but have everlasting life, the greatest gift,

00:46:34.479 --> 00:46:37.139
the unspeakable gift.

00:46:37.139 --> 00:46:39.699
It says in verse 18 that they do good,

00:46:39.699 --> 00:46:41.659
that they be rich in good works,

00:46:41.659 --> 00:46:43.719
ready to distribute, willing to communicate,

00:46:44.539 --> 00:46:46.699
laying up in store for themselves a good foundation

00:46:46.699 --> 00:46:47.859
against the time to come,

00:46:47.859 --> 00:46:49.659
that they may lay hold on eternal life.

00:46:49.659 --> 00:46:53.819
Remember this truth of having the focus of eternity,

00:46:53.819 --> 00:46:56.119
not the temporary.

00:46:56.119 --> 00:46:58.939
So often we can get caught up living in the temporary,

00:46:58.939 --> 00:47:01.019
the mundane, the monotonous, but no,

00:47:01.019 --> 00:47:02.219
we as God's people,

00:47:02.219 --> 00:47:04.019
we look not at those things which are temporal,

00:47:04.019 --> 00:47:06.819
but those things which are eternal.

00:47:06.819 --> 00:47:10.459
And we find that he had said to Timothy in verse number 12,

00:47:10.799 --> 00:47:13.839
the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life.

00:47:13.839 --> 00:47:16.559
And I mentioned this even as we see it in verse number 19.

00:47:16.559 --> 00:47:18.639
It's not the idea that you're somehow

00:47:18.639 --> 00:47:20.319
going to get eternal life.

00:47:20.319 --> 00:47:23.819
It's rather the idea that because you have eternal life,

00:47:23.819 --> 00:47:26.699
you are a possessor of eternal life.

00:47:26.699 --> 00:47:30.099
You ought to also be a professor of eternal life.

00:47:30.099 --> 00:47:33.039
You're to be living like you're saved.

00:47:34.919 --> 00:47:36.959
Oh, Timothy, verse 20.

00:47:37.959 --> 00:47:42.879
Keep that which is committed to thy trust,

00:47:42.879 --> 00:47:45.379
avoiding profane and vain babblings

00:47:45.379 --> 00:47:49.439
and oppositions of science, falsely so called,

00:47:49.439 --> 00:47:53.179
which some professing have erred concerning the faith.

00:47:53.179 --> 00:47:55.279
Grace be with thee.

00:47:55.279 --> 00:47:56.659
Amen.

00:47:56.659 --> 00:48:01.139
This morning, we're not in Ephesus and we're not Timothy.

00:48:02.139 --> 00:48:07.139
But this morning, if you're saved by the grace of God,

00:48:08.259 --> 00:48:09.559
you're running a race.

00:48:11.939 --> 00:48:16.179
And just as Paul is seeking to motivate

00:48:16.179 --> 00:48:20.019
and encourage Timothy to finish his race,

00:48:20.859 --> 00:48:23.659
I believe this morning that we too are being motivated

00:48:23.659 --> 00:48:26.539
and encouraged to finish our race.

00:48:27.379 --> 00:48:32.379
When times get hard, when we just want to give up,

00:48:34.859 --> 00:48:36.219
what's the point?

00:48:37.059 --> 00:48:40.299
No, no, don't go down that path of thinking.

00:48:41.299 --> 00:48:44.820
Fix your attention on our King of Kings and Lord of Lords,

00:48:44.820 --> 00:48:49.820
our God, our Savior, the one for whom we are running.

00:48:50.139 --> 00:48:53.059
And remember his power.

00:48:53.059 --> 00:48:54.619
He has all power.

00:48:54.619 --> 00:48:56.739
I am weak, but he is strong.

00:48:59.479 --> 00:49:03.859
His strength is made perfect in weakness.

00:49:05.539 --> 00:49:07.659
2 Corinthians 12.

00:49:07.659 --> 00:49:10.859
We must remember this morning that our God has all power.

00:49:10.859 --> 00:49:12.859
Remember his position,

00:49:12.859 --> 00:49:16.539
that he is the blessed and only potentate,

00:49:16.539 --> 00:49:19.799
literally the only all powerful one.

00:49:19.799 --> 00:49:21.820
He is King of Kings and Lord of Lords.

00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:24.019
Thy God reigneth.

00:49:24.019 --> 00:49:28.659
You say, pastor, it's chaotic, things are crazy.

00:49:28.659 --> 00:49:32.500
I know, but God's on his throne.

00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:34.940
None of it surprised God.

00:49:34.940 --> 00:49:37.059
You say, I read the news and I was surprised.

00:49:37.059 --> 00:49:38.179
God wasn't.

00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:44.659
Rest in knowing that thy God reigneth.

00:49:44.659 --> 00:49:47.539
And number three, remember his plan.

00:49:47.539 --> 00:49:52.239
Are you looking for, as he would say to Titus,

00:49:52.239 --> 00:49:55.320
the blessed hope and glorious appearing

00:49:55.320 --> 00:49:58.579
of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.

00:50:00.039 --> 00:50:02.239
Listen for the trumpet, the songwriter said.

00:50:02.239 --> 00:50:11.579
Jesus is coming. Hallelujah. This morning, I want to finish well. I want to finish strong.

00:50:11.579 --> 00:50:16.419
I want to continue our theme for this year, continue. You say, but all these things are

00:50:16.419 --> 00:50:25.279
against us. If God be for us, who can be against us? Remember, we are more than conquerors

00:50:25.279 --> 00:50:31.539
through Him, but thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus

00:50:31.539 --> 00:50:38.999
Christ. This morning, we serve the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, and He is worthy

00:50:38.999 --> 00:50:47.239
of all of our worship, and He is worthy this morning of us continuing, continuing, pressing

00:50:47.239 --> 00:50:55.199
on, finishing. He's worthy. Let's pray. Father, we love you. We thank you for loving us. We

00:50:55.199 --> 00:51:00.079
thank you for your Word, the truth contained therein. We thank you for this letter that

00:51:00.079 --> 00:51:08.999
we've been able to study over these months, the encouragement, instruction that we have

00:51:08.999 --> 00:51:17.699
received. And Lord, this morning, I pray that you would help us, even as Timothy was receiving

00:51:17.699 --> 00:51:22.439
this charge and being reminded of these truths, Lord, so that he would continue, so that he

00:51:22.479 --> 00:51:32.279
would finish. I pray that you would help us to rejoice in knowing that you have all power,

00:51:32.279 --> 00:51:39.719
your position is settled. We have a plan that will never be altered. And God, I pray you'd

00:51:39.719 --> 00:51:44.679
help us to keep our eyes on Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith. God, if there's

00:51:44.679 --> 00:51:48.919
one here this morning or one that's tuned in via live stream that's not sure of heaven,

00:51:48.919 --> 00:51:52.519
I pray that today they'd be saved. They'd trust the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal

00:51:52.519 --> 00:51:58.159
Savior. Maybe this morning there's someone here or on live stream that's struggling,

00:51:58.159 --> 00:52:04.319
they're overwhelmed, they're just dealing with it. God, I pray that you'd encourage

00:52:04.319 --> 00:52:14.879
them to continue. I pray, Lord, that for the one that has their eyes on you, would you

00:52:14.879 --> 00:52:23.519
help us to continue in that same manner. Help us not to be distracted. Help us not

00:52:23.519 --> 00:52:30.059
to be detoured. No, help us to continue. I pray that in this moment, this time of invitation

00:52:30.059 --> 00:52:36.279
that you'd have your will and way, I pray that your people would respond. Do business

00:52:36.279 --> 00:52:40.959
with God this morning. And I pray that you'd be honored and glorified, that you'd be exalted

00:52:40.959 --> 00:52:45.119
through every decision that's made. Well, thank you for it in Christ's name. We pray.
