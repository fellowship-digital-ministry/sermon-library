1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,199
Your family starts singing and you say, like we do, I made you sing.

2
00:00:04,199 --> 00:00:05,480
And we do that all the time.

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:10,199
One of us will just start singing a song and I'll just say a few words of that particular

4
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:14,760
song, sing part of a measure, and then Brianna or someone else will start singing the rest

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,239
and I'll say, hey, I made you sing.

6
00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:20,760
But man, it's good to have a song, amen, to sing with enthusiasm.

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:26,600
I've been in some places, some churches, some pastors meetings, where we get up to sing

8
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,120
and I get up to sing.

9
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,959
And then all of a sudden I realize, like, man, I'm singing way too loud, like everybody

10
00:00:32,959 --> 00:00:35,759
else is singing really quiet.

11
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:38,720
And man, it's good to sing out, amen.

12
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,720
So thank you, Zachary.

13
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,000
I appreciate that.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,799
Genesis chapter 21, Genesis chapter 21, we'll be looking at just verses one through seven

15
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:48,400
this evening.

16
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,000
And if you have your bulletin in front of you, you see that the title of the message

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,400
tonight is Sarah conceived and bear a son.

18
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:02,599
It had been 25 years since God called Abraham from the Ur of the Chaldees.

19
00:01:02,599 --> 00:01:06,879
We understand at that particular time in his life, his name was Abram.

20
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:11,059
And we find, of course, that his name in chapter 18 is changed to Abraham.

21
00:01:11,059 --> 00:01:15,199
But we find that it had been 25 years that had passed, now 25 years is a long time.

22
00:01:15,199 --> 00:01:19,419
Some of you aren't yet 25 and you say, man, 25 years is a really long time.

23
00:01:19,419 --> 00:01:24,500
And we understand 25 years, even for those of us that are above 25 years, some of us

24
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:29,779
are some increment of 25, and we won't go any further than that.

25
00:01:29,779 --> 00:01:35,220
But the reality is that 25 years is a long time, amen, it's a long time.

26
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:40,860
And 25 years had passed since God had called Abraham from the Ur of the Chaldees.

27
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,940
We find that Abraham responded to that call.

28
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:47,940
And it's interesting that as you look in the book of Hebrews, in Hebrews chapter 11, the

29
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:54,379
Bible says this, he went out not knowing whither he went.

30
00:01:54,379 --> 00:01:58,620
God leads his dear children along, we just sang that wonderful hymn, and we find the

31
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:04,220
Bible tells us just before that phrase in Hebrews, that he went out not knowing whither

32
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:08,699
he went, it says this, that he obeyed, he obeyed.

33
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:13,839
And I'm thankful for the obedience of Abraham, I'm thankful that he took that step of obedience.

34
00:02:13,839 --> 00:02:19,619
We find that the obedience of Abraham would be blessed in a variety of ways.

35
00:02:19,619 --> 00:02:23,220
We find that as you study through the portion of scripture that we've been studying in recent

36
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:29,919
weeks, that you find so many examples of how God would bless the obedience of Abraham.

37
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:35,020
And we find that of course when he, God called Abraham out of the Ur of the Chaldees, that

38
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:39,300
God gave Abraham a two-fold promise.

39
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:44,899
The two-fold promise that was given to Abraham was within really two areas, two specific

40
00:02:44,899 --> 00:02:49,220
areas, and one being a land and one being a seed.

41
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:55,860
We find that as God had given that promise to Abraham, that it's oft repeated in the

42
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:01,039
portion of scripture in the book of Genesis that covers the life of Abraham, and we would

43
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:06,100
say this, that the story of Abraham, that really his life and the account that we have

44
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:10,660
in the word of God, there are many twists and turns, right?

45
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:15,419
The passage that we studied last week in chapter 20 of Genesis, not a high point in the life

46
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:17,059
of Abraham, right?

47
00:03:17,059 --> 00:03:21,199
He goes into Gerar and he finds that Abimelech is there and he's not so sure that he wants

48
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:26,619
to have, I shouldn't say that he's not sure, he makes an agreement and he says, this is

49
00:03:26,619 --> 00:03:30,339
my sister, and it's not a high point in the life of Abraham, something that he had done

50
00:03:30,339 --> 00:03:34,139
earlier with Pharaoh in Egypt in Genesis chapter number 12.

51
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:38,339
But we find that there are twists and turns in the life of Abraham, but the reality is

52
00:03:38,339 --> 00:03:42,119
that there are twists and turns in your life and in my life, right?

53
00:03:42,119 --> 00:03:46,020
There are times in our lives where it seems like, man, we're walking with God and we see

54
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:49,820
the blessing of God and we're kind of on the mountaintop, so to speak, and, I mean,

55
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:53,460
it's wonderful, and then there's some times in which we look back and we kind of say,

56
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,380
man, I don't know what was going on with me then.

57
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:59,619
I don't know why I didn't trust God, why I didn't have the faith that I needed to have.

58
00:03:59,619 --> 00:04:05,259
And we have those twists and turns, those mountains and those valleys, but as I look

59
00:04:05,259 --> 00:04:11,500
at the twists and turns, I find that there are many valuable lessons, not only for Abraham

60
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:15,020
to learn, but for us to learn.

61
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:21,019
In my humble opinion, I believe that the record that is before us tonight is really

62
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:24,739
one of the highest points in Abraham's life.

63
00:04:24,739 --> 00:04:29,579
I hope that this evening that this message will encourage us.

64
00:04:29,579 --> 00:04:36,299
I hope that as we look at these seven verses of Scripture that we would put ourselves in

65
00:04:36,299 --> 00:04:43,420
the position of Abraham and Sarah and rejoice greatly and that we would take away some truth

66
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:49,899
that would help us, the birth of a child is precious and impactful.

67
00:04:49,899 --> 00:04:51,700
Would you not agree?

68
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:59,140
Many of us that have children, we can remember in our mind the birth of our children, the

69
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:04,859
day in which they were born, and just how precious and how impactful that particular

70
00:05:04,859 --> 00:05:05,899
event was.

71
00:05:05,899 --> 00:05:10,980
But I believe that in this particular case, that as you look at the birth of Isaac being

72
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:17,220
a fulfillment of a promise that had been made 25 years earlier, man, it's a precious,

73
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,459
precious moment.

74
00:05:19,459 --> 00:05:23,579
As we look at the passage of Scripture, I want you to notice letter, excuse me, I'll

75
00:05:23,579 --> 00:05:24,980
get to the points in a minute.

76
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:30,339
Verse 1, and the Lord visited Sarah as He had said, and the Lord did unto Sarah as He

77
00:05:30,339 --> 00:05:32,380
had spoken.

78
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:37,700
For Sarah conceived and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God

79
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,980
had spoken to him.

80
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:45,579
And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him,

81
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:46,700
Isaac.

82
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:52,899
And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac, being eight days old, as God had commanded him.

83
00:05:52,899 --> 00:05:58,899
And Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born unto him.

84
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:05,119
And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear will laugh with me.

85
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:11,040
She said, who would have said unto Abraham that Sarah should have given children suck?

86
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:15,160
For I have born him a son in his old age.

87
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:20,079
I want you to note the expressions that are listed in these first few verses, really in

88
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:21,239
verses 1 and 2.

89
00:06:21,239 --> 00:06:26,239
Note these expressions, and I believe this evening that as we take note of a couple of

90
00:06:26,239 --> 00:06:30,799
these expressions, that it reminds us and reveals to us the faithfulness of God.

91
00:06:30,799 --> 00:06:35,040
We mentioned in our message last week from Genesis chapter number 20, that though Abraham

92
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:40,399
had fear that God was faithful, and God is faithful, and I am thankful for the faithfulness

93
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,399
of God.

94
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:46,920
And we find here in verses 1 and 2, that as we note these expressions, that it will remind

95
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,720
us that our God is faithful.

96
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,160
Note with me, the Bible says this in verse number 1, and the Lord visited Sarah.

97
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:58,440
Note this expression, as he had said.

98
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,839
As he had said.

99
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:06,119
And then it says this, and the Lord did unto Sarah, notice again, as he had spoken.

100
00:07:06,119 --> 00:07:10,320
So in verse number 1, we see two phrases, two expressions that are used for us.

101
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:14,220
One, as he had said, number two, as he had spoken.

102
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:17,760
We find that in verse number 2, the Bible says that Sarah conceived and bare Abraham

103
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:23,160
a son in his old age, and then notice this expression, this statement, at the set time

104
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:27,000
of which God had spoken to him.

105
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,239
So we find that in verse number 1, it says as he had said, it says in verse number 1,

106
00:07:31,239 --> 00:07:36,760
as he had spoken, and then in verse number 2, at the set time of which God had spoken

107
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,760
to him.

108
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:42,200
Again, these phrases that are given to us in verse 1 and 2, they remind us and reveal

109
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,040
to us the faithfulness of God.

110
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:48,279
I want you to go back to chapter number 12, and we're going to go through some of these

111
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:53,880
verses and remind ourselves of the, that which God has said, that which he had spoken, as

112
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,880
we consider the two statements in verse number 1.

113
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:02,359
Go back to Genesis chapter number 12, and we'll look at a number of verses here in these

114
00:08:02,359 --> 00:08:06,720
next few chapters of the book of Genesis, and we'll be reminded of what it is that God

115
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,720
said.

116
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:14,359
In Genesis chapter 12 and verse number 7, let me say this even before I look at this,

117
00:08:14,359 --> 00:08:19,260
what God had said, it's interesting that God reveals to us in chapter number 11 and verse

118
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:24,480
number 30, but Sarah was barren, she had no child.

119
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:29,239
And God gives us that information so that we understand the circumstances in which they

120
00:08:29,239 --> 00:08:30,239
were dealing with.

121
00:08:30,239 --> 00:08:35,799
She was barren, they had no children, but in Genesis 12, after God calls Abraham, Abram

122
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:40,400
at that time, to leave the earth, the Chaldees, we find that in verse number 7 of Genesis

123
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:45,679
12, the Bible says, and the Lord appeared unto Abram and said, unto thy seed will I

124
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:50,859
give this land, and there builded he an altar unto the Lord who appeared unto him.

125
00:08:50,859 --> 00:08:52,119
What is God saying to Abram?

126
00:08:52,119 --> 00:08:55,640
He's saying, listen, unto thy seed will I give this land.

127
00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:00,799
Well, Abram has no seed at this particular time, and so God is no doubt understanding

128
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:06,880
the promise that he's made and that he would reiterate to Abraham with regard to this child,

129
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,599
this seed, and here to the land.

130
00:09:09,599 --> 00:09:14,119
Notice if you will, in chapter number 13 and verse number 16.

131
00:09:14,119 --> 00:09:17,599
In chapter number 13, we read of the separation of Lot and Abraham.

132
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:20,960
Of course, there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and the herdmen

133
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:26,280
of Lot's cattle, and we find that it's in this portion of Scripture in which Lot determined

134
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:32,119
that he would take that section, that place, that was well-watered and was pleasant to

135
00:09:32,119 --> 00:09:36,700
the eyes, and we find that he pitched his tent toward Sodom.

136
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:40,619
But in verse number 16, notice what God says to Abraham.

137
00:09:40,619 --> 00:09:46,200
He says this, and I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth.

138
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,580
In verse number 15, he mentions about the land, but I want you to notice specifically

139
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,500
because what we're dealing with in Genesis 21 is the birth of Isaac, the fulfillment

140
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:00,059
of the promise, the particular situation.

141
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:05,439
with a son a seed and we find here in verse number 16 that God says and I will

142
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:10,019
make thy seed as the dust of the earth so that if a man can number the dust of

143
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:16,459
the earth then shall thy seed also be numbered notice chapter 15 in chapter

144
00:10:16,459 --> 00:10:22,559
number 15 we find that here the covenant is made between Abraham and and God God

145
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:27,179
giving that that Abrahamic covenant as we often referred to it as it's after

146
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:33,179
the great victory of chapter number 14 and God notice what Abraham says in

147
00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:37,939
verse number 3 and Abram said behold to me thou hast given no seed now

148
00:10:37,939 --> 00:10:42,179
understand again that this promise had been made and sometimes listen we

149
00:10:42,179 --> 00:10:45,219
sometimes are anxious to get the fulfillment of our promise are we not

150
00:10:45,219 --> 00:10:52,019
and here we find that Abraham he says to to me behold to me thou hast given no

151
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:56,979
seed and lo one born in my house is mine heir this is the logic of Abraham

152
00:10:56,979 --> 00:11:00,659
and we find that in verse number 4 the Bible says that behold the word of the

153
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:07,180
Lord came unto him unto Abraham saying this shall not be thine heir but he that

154
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:11,860
shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir and he brought him

155
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:16,059
forth abroad and said look now toward heaven and tell the stars if they'll be

156
00:11:16,059 --> 00:11:22,180
able to number them and he said unto him so shall thy seed be and he Abraham

157
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:29,339
believed in the Lord and he God counted it to him for righteousness what a

158
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:34,259
precious truth in verse number 6 of Abraham believing the promise that God

159
00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:40,220
had given and we find that Abraham had offered really his logical solution to

160
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:45,379
the problem I've received no seed and one that's born in mine house is mine

161
00:11:45,379 --> 00:11:49,739
heir and God says no Abraham I'm gonna give you a seed I'm gonna give you a

162
00:11:49,739 --> 00:11:56,739
son notice in chapter 17 in verse number 16 in fact we'll look at a few verses

163
00:11:56,739 --> 00:12:02,659
here in Genesis chapter number 17 but in verse number 16 the Bible says this and

164
00:12:02,659 --> 00:12:10,819
I will bless her and give thee a son also of her yay I will bless her and she

165
00:12:10,819 --> 00:12:15,940
shall be a mother of nations kings of people shall be of her who is her it's

166
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:21,860
Sarah as you notice in verse number 15 that God then changes Sarah to Sarah in

167
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:26,259
that verse of Scripture and God says I will bless her and give thee a son also

168
00:12:26,259 --> 00:12:30,220
of her skip down and look at verse number 19 the Bible says here and God

169
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:37,339
said Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed and thou shalt call his name

170
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:42,259
Isaac and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant and

171
00:12:42,259 --> 00:12:47,940
with his seed after him verse 21 but my covenant will I establish with Isaac

172
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:55,300
which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year as we look at

173
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:59,860
these verses of Scripture I can't help but think about Abraham and we

174
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:04,699
understand that the book of Genesis was written by Moses years and years later

175
00:13:04,699 --> 00:13:11,179
and we find that Abraham however had experienced this walk with God Abraham

176
00:13:11,179 --> 00:13:16,139
had heard the promise of God as we read these verses we find the Bible says the

177
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:20,779
Lord spoke unto Abraham the the word of the Lord came unto Abraham and and now

178
00:13:20,779 --> 00:13:26,220
we come to chapter number 21 and I love the way in which God tells us that the

179
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:34,899
Lord visited Sarah as he had said as he had spoken we must understand this

180
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:40,139
evening that our God is faithful and he always does what he says he will do amen

181
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:48,539
always always write it down mark it trust it put your faith in what God has

182
00:13:48,539 --> 00:13:54,979
said because he always always always will do what he says he will do and that

183
00:13:54,979 --> 00:13:59,580
ought to cause us to rejoice greatly I think about Abraham at this time in his

184
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:05,739
life again the first mention of a seed is in Genesis chapter number 12 he's 75

185
00:14:05,739 --> 00:14:10,979
years old and now in chapter number 21 he's a hundred years old and this is

186
00:14:10,979 --> 00:14:17,179
when Isaac is born 25 years again a lengthy period of time but God did what

187
00:14:17,179 --> 00:14:23,540
he said he would do as he had said as he had spoken notice the phrase in verse

188
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:28,660
number two that also reminds us and reveals to us the faithfulness of God it

189
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:35,179
says at the end of the verse at the set time of which God had spoken to him we

190
00:14:35,179 --> 00:14:39,899
find that it was there in chapter number 17 that we mentioned as we looked at

191
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:43,579
those verses just a moment ago in verse number 21 that it said at the end of the

192
00:14:43,579 --> 00:14:48,899
verse that Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year but we

193
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:52,459
find that that is expanded upon in chapter number 18 turn back to chapter

194
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:57,500
18 if you will and look at verses 10 through 14 and we know that here it was

195
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:02,019
in this chapter in which the Lord appeared unto unto Abraham and remember

196
00:15:02,019 --> 00:15:06,660
Abraham saw him and he he jumped up and he ran toward him and the the fellowship

197
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:11,260
that they enjoyed one with another and it's in this passage that God gives him

198
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:16,579
the truth with regard to the timing of the birth of Isaac it says in verse

199
00:15:16,579 --> 00:15:20,779
number 10 and he said I will certainly return unto thee according to the time

200
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:27,220
of life and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son and Sarah heard it in the tent

201
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:31,299
door which was behind him now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in

202
00:15:31,299 --> 00:15:35,660
age and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women therefore Sarah

203
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:41,459
laughed within herself saying after I am wax old and shall I have pleasure my

204
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:45,500
Lord being old also and the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh

205
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:50,119
saying shall I have sure to bear a child which I'm old is anything too hard for

206
00:15:50,119 --> 00:15:56,880
the Lord notice again verse 14 at the time appointed I will return unto thee

207
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:03,639
according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son aren't you thankful

208
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:08,839
that God has spoken to us that he has given us his word we see specifically

209
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:13,279
within the context of our message this evening that God was speaking to Abraham

210
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:18,880
about this particular event this promise of a seed of a son of Isaac that would

211
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,519
be born and we find that we can rejoice greatly in understanding these

212
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:26,320
statements that are made in verses one and two and helping us to be reminded

213
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,839
of the the faithfulness of God it reveals the faithfulness of God but we

214
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:36,880
have 66 books in our Bible that we read and God has given us truth and as God

215
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:41,320
has revealed to us truth we must recognize this evening that he is

216
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:47,359
faithful to do all that he said he will do do you remember when the folks

217
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:55,040
arrived at the tomb early on the morning of the resurrection he is not here for

218
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:05,399
he is risen as he said as he said see because God always does what he says

219
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:11,600
he's going to do that should cause you and I to rejoice greatly listen we live

220
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,639
in the midst of as I mentioned this morning we're talking about all of the

221
00:17:14,639 --> 00:17:19,399
the the various aspects of the the flesh and dealing with anger and wrath

222
00:17:19,399 --> 00:17:23,519
and malice and all of that but we looked at lying and we talked about how that we

223
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:27,919
live in the midst of a time in which lying is just commonplace and it's

224
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:33,079
something that is commonly accepted but the reality is that our God is not a man

225
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:38,279
that he should lie everything that he has said he has the power to do it when

226
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:42,399
Sarah laughs in chapter 18 God questions Abraham as to why Sarah laughed I

227
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:46,399
believe that God questions Abraham because God had given Abraham truth in

228
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:50,119
chapter number 17 that he was responsible to communicate to his wife

229
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:55,119
and we find that Abraham believed God in that passage of Scripture and he had

230
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:59,799
that responsibility but we also find that there he says in verse number 14 of

231
00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:03,679
chapter number 18 listen when Sarah laughs and she says this is just not

232
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:10,119
even possible I mean I'm old and God says is anything too hard for the Lord

233
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:15,799
listen when we think about the promises that God has given us he said this I

234
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:19,079
will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it do you

235
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:25,279
believe that you say but we're living in 2021 the the the politics and the

236
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:28,559
whatever and all the things are going on and they're trying to shut us down and

237
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:33,239
they're trying to do this and they're trying to do that we serve God is

238
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:40,520
anything too hard for the Lord the answer is no it doesn't matter all

239
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:45,880
listen we know that Satan is gonna oppose the work of God is always

240
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:52,840
opposed is it not but we say God's faithful he said he would build his

241
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:59,239
church and he does and I'm rejoicing and I'm thankful we could look at a whole

242
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:06,599
host of things listen no one is ever going to conquer our God amen he reigns

243
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:12,039
he is the Lord God omnipotent there's nothing listen God listen I know

244
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:16,039
sometimes we kind of worry you ever you ever worry listen don't get all holy on

245
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:19,320
me and say I never worry listen the Bible says that we're to be careful for

246
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,479
nothing right but in everything through prayer and supplication we're to make

247
00:19:22,479 --> 00:19:26,039
it with Thanksgiving we're to make our requests known unto God but the problem

248
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:32,440
is that as believers there are times that we worry God never worries he's not

249
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:36,840
up in heaven fretting saying what am I gonna do now these evil people have

250
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:44,440
these evil plans no it doesn't God's in control amen he's in control he was in

251
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:48,320
control of the circumstances here and when we look at the expressions the

252
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,960
statements that are made in verses 1 & 2 it reminds us and reveals to us the

253
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:58,440
faithfulness of God I want to know the actions that we find in verses 3 & 4 and

254
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,039
as we look at the actions in verses

255
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:05,799
three and four, it really reveals to us the obedience of Abraham. The obedience

256
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:10,319
of Abraham. Notice in verse number three, the Bible says this, and Abraham called

257
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:15,039
the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac. I've

258
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:22,039
simply cut down the the phraseology for this point here, saying this, when it

259
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:25,079
talks about the action of Abraham in verse number three, that he called his

260
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:30,359
name Isaac. Why did he call his name Isaac? Because that's what God told him.

261
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:35,159
It's obedience. Turn back, if you will, to chapter 17. We read it a moment ago, but I

262
00:20:35,159 --> 00:20:41,839
want you to see it again. Verse number 19, and God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear

263
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:47,359
thee a son indeed, and thou shalt call his name Isaac. Thou shalt call his name

264
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:52,199
Isaac. So in verse number three of Genesis chapter number 21, when we read

265
00:20:52,199 --> 00:20:59,159
about the fact that this boy is born and God blessed and God fulfilled, God

266
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:04,199
did what he said he was going to do, that Abraham then calls his name Isaac, an

267
00:21:04,199 --> 00:21:10,439
act of obedience. You remember Elizabeth and Zacharias? They'd received, Zacharias

268
00:21:10,439 --> 00:21:14,199
had received a vision that they were gonna have a son. Elizabeth was barren,

269
00:21:14,199 --> 00:21:17,719
correct? And we can read of that in Luke chapter number one. You can read all that

270
00:21:17,719 --> 00:21:22,639
takes place. And what was it that God said the angel that appeared to Zacharias,

271
00:21:22,639 --> 00:21:26,519
remember he wanted to have some kind of a sign, and what did the angel say? You

272
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:33,159
shall call his name John. So then what happened to Zacharias when he asked for

273
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:40,039
that sign? He can't talk anymore. Man, I bet he probably regretted that. Couldn't

274
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:46,919
talk the duration of that term as Elizabeth is with child. But you know

275
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:50,839
something that's interesting about Zacharias, he was faithful to communicate

276
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:57,799
in some manner with his wife that that son was to be named John. Because when

277
00:21:57,799 --> 00:22:02,279
that son was born, they said what shall his name be? And Elizabeth said John. And

278
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:08,839
there was opposition, right? There's none in your family with this name. And

279
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:15,999
then what happens, they give him a pen and paper, that's what we'd use, an iPad

280
00:22:15,999 --> 00:22:22,999
and a smart pencil, and said his name shall be John. He was obeying. Listen,

281
00:22:22,999 --> 00:22:28,039
obedience is so critical in the life of a believer. It really is. It's just

282
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:36,519
critical that we obey. Abraham obeyed. He received the promise that had been given.

283
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:43,239
He's now going to have this son, this promise on 25 years, and we find that he

284
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:49,119
calls his name Isaac. It's a matter of obedience. Not only do we see obedience

285
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:53,439
in the life of Abraham with regard to the naming of his son, but we see the obedience

286
00:22:53,439 --> 00:22:57,039
of Abraham with regard to the circumcision of his son. Notice in verse

287
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:01,199
number four, the Bible says, and Abraham circumcised his son Isaac, being eight

288
00:23:01,199 --> 00:23:07,959
days old. Notice the last phrase, as God had commanded him. As God had commanded

289
00:23:07,959 --> 00:23:12,879
him. You go back to chapter number 17 again, and look at verses 10 through 12,

290
00:23:12,879 --> 00:23:19,119
and you note here the commandment of God with regard to this right of circumcision,

291
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:23,199
this token of the covenant that is mentioned here, and we find that the

292
00:23:23,199 --> 00:23:27,439
Bible tells us in Genesis 17, beginning in verse number 10, that God is speaking

293
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:30,559
to Abraham, and he says this, look, pick it up in verse number 9, and God said

294
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:35,359
unto Abraham, thou shalt keep my covenant, therefore thou and thy seed after thee,

295
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:39,959
and their generations, this is my covenant which you shall keep between me and you

296
00:23:39,959 --> 00:23:44,599
and thy seed after thee, every man child among you shall be circumcised, and you

297
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:49,279
shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin, and it shall be a token of the

298
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:54,559
covenant betwixt me and you, and he that is eight days old shall be circumcised

299
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:59,359
among you. Every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house

300
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:04,439
or bought with money of any stranger which is not of thy seed, and we find the

301
00:24:04,439 --> 00:24:09,599
Bible tells us in chapter 21 and verse number 4, that Abraham circumcised his

302
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:15,199
son Isaac being eight days old as God had commanded him. Not only did he

303
00:24:15,199 --> 00:24:19,999
fulfill the responsibility to circumcise his son, but he did it on the eighth day.

304
00:24:19,999 --> 00:24:26,159
That's complete obedience, is it not? It would have been disobedience to have

305
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:33,839
circumcised Isaac prior to or after the prescribed time that God had given. See,

306
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:39,119
you think about obedience, and you think about the importance of obedience, the

307
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:43,239
word of God shares with us throughout really the whole of Scripture that God

308
00:24:43,239 --> 00:24:49,999
places a premium upon obedience. To obey, in fact, God says in 1st Samuel, when

309
00:24:49,999 --> 00:24:54,759
speaking to Saul, Samuel speaking to Saul in 1st Samuel 15, to obey is better than

310
00:24:54,759 --> 00:25:00,239
sacrifice. What happens when Samuel comes, God tells Samuel that Saul has

311
00:25:00,239 --> 00:25:04,799
disobeyed, he's to kill the Amalekites, right? And what happens, he comes and

312
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:09,199
Samuel shows up and he says, I have obeyed the voice of the Lord, but he

313
00:25:09,199 --> 00:25:16,959
disobeyed. It was partial obedience, and God places a premium on obedience. And so

314
00:25:16,959 --> 00:25:22,039
in verses 1 and 2, as we look at, excuse me, verses 1 through 4, when we look at

315
00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:27,199
this account that is given to us of the birth of Isaac, we find it in the first

316
00:25:27,199 --> 00:25:30,359
two verses that there are three statements that are made that remind us

317
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:33,999
and reveal to us the faithfulness of God. In verses 3 and 4, there are two

318
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:38,599
actions that are recorded for us that remind us and reveal to us the obedience

319
00:25:38,599 --> 00:25:44,159
of Abraham, and I'm so thankful for his obedience. We find that in verses 5

320
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:48,479
through 7, the Bible says, and Abraham was a hundred years old when his son

321
00:25:48,479 --> 00:25:53,279
Isaac was born unto him, I said, and dealt with that by way of introduction, the 25

322
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:57,719
years that had passed from Genesis 12, when Abram was called out of the Ur of

323
00:25:57,719 --> 00:26:02,119
the Chaldees to begin following the Lord. He went out not knowing whither he went,

324
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:07,199
yet he obeyed, and we find that now he's a hundred years old. And Sarah, the Bible

325
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:11,559
then gives us this statement that Sarah makes in verses 6 and 7. She says,

326
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:15,999
God hath made me to laugh. No doubt she has in her mind that which happened in

327
00:26:15,999 --> 00:26:20,079
chapter number 18. God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear will laugh

328
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:24,439
with me. And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham that Sarah should have

329
00:26:24,439 --> 00:26:31,479
given children suck? For I have born him a son in this old age. Who but God? Amen?

330
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:37,359
No person is going to say you're going to have a child at this age. They were

331
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:42,719
past that point, but God had given the promise. As we look at this passage of

332
00:26:42,719 --> 00:26:47,079
Scripture, I really want to think about a couple of things this evening that I

333
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:50,479
hope would be a blessing and encouragement to you. Number one, waiting

334
00:26:50,479 --> 00:27:02,199
on the Lord isn't always easy. How many of you like to wait? Nobody. No one likes

335
00:27:02,199 --> 00:27:06,279
to wait. I had to run to Aldi this afternoon to get a couple of things real

336
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:12,799
quick. Not a good idea on Sunday afternoon. Just tuck that away somewhere.

337
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:16,439
Next time you're at Aldi on Sunday afternoon, you'll remember that pastor

338
00:27:16,439 --> 00:27:20,399
said it's not a good idea, and you'll be like, you know, he was right. There's a

339
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:25,759
lot of people at Aldi. And out of all of the checkout lines at Aldi, there was

340
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:30,839
only one that had a light on. Isn't that exciting? And I get in line, there's all

341
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:34,399
kinds of people. But then there's this other line down here that's got a light

342
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:37,719
off, but a cashier working, and people just keep lining up. And I'm kind of like,

343
00:27:37,719 --> 00:27:41,199
what's the deal here? Like, if you're open, put your light on. If you're not, tell

344
00:27:41,199 --> 00:27:45,079
them to get in a different line. And literally, have you ever been in a line

345
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:47,719
where you got a whole bunch of stuff? Armando, you got to buy a lot because

346
00:27:47,719 --> 00:27:50,959
you got a lot of kids, right? And you got all this stuff, and somebody comes and

347
00:27:50,959 --> 00:27:53,439
just got a couple things, and maybe out of the generosity of your heart, you say,

348
00:27:53,439 --> 00:27:58,239
you know what? You go ahead and go first. It happens, right? I only had a couple

349
00:27:58,239 --> 00:28:02,479
things, but no one was being generous, all right? I'm waiting. No one was being

350
00:28:02,479 --> 00:28:07,679
kind, and that's all right. It is what it is. But literally, this lady walks up

351
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:12,519
with four bags of chips, and she says to the person in front of them, I only got a

352
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:16,879
couple things, I'm gonna go ahead. And just literally went right ahead and just

353
00:28:16,879 --> 00:28:23,559
went on her business, and I was like, well then, that's interesting. Now, I don't

354
00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:26,599
think I could get away with it, right? You know what I mean? Somebody caused a big

355
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:34,799
problem. But she just, I've never seen that in my life. She didn't want to wait.

356
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:41,440
We don't like waiting. I go to the store, I try to find the line that has the

357
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:48,320
fewest people, and it almost never fails, that that's the line that has a problem.

358
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:53,919
Right, Pierre? Absolutely, right? Amen. You're like, oh look, that line, right, Blake?

359
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:57,039
You're like, I'm gonna get in this line, it's gonna be real fast. And then,

360
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,199
and then somebody's like, well, you know, I really don't, can you just do a price

361
00:29:00,199 --> 00:29:03,479
check on this? Because I'm not really sure that I want it. I'm like, how do they get

362
00:29:03,479 --> 00:29:09,440
in your car if you don't want it? Like, come on, right? You gotta be kidding me.

363
00:29:09,479 --> 00:29:17,519
Let's just go. We don't like to wait. Waiting on God is not always easy. It

364
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:26,799
really isn't. Waiting on God isn't always easy. In Genesis chapter number 16, we

365
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:32,919
won't take time to really read what takes place there, but you'll note that

366
00:29:32,959 --> 00:29:41,039
it's the account of Abraham and Hagar and the birth of Ishmael. And I preached

367
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:46,559
a message on this a number of months ago from this portion of Scripture, and one

368
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:49,919
of the things that I said in that message that is worth repeating with

369
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:56,399
regard to this particular point tonight is that oftentimes we are quick to

370
00:29:56,399 --> 00:30:02,239
criticize and attack Abraham and Sarah for the event

371
00:30:02,239 --> 00:30:04,539
that takes place in Genesis chapter number 16.

372
00:30:05,559 --> 00:30:06,959
But if you look at what takes place

373
00:30:06,959 --> 00:30:08,319
in Genesis chapter number 16,

374
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:10,059
you'll note that the Bible tells us

375
00:30:10,059 --> 00:30:11,919
that they had already waited 10 years.

376
00:30:12,839 --> 00:30:15,259
10 years, that's a long time.

377
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:19,979
It's a long time to wait.

378
00:30:19,979 --> 00:30:22,839
It ends up being 25 years altogether

379
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:24,919
when you look at the entirety of what takes place

380
00:30:24,919 --> 00:30:27,739
between the original promise being given

381
00:30:27,739 --> 00:30:30,319
and now looking at this.

382
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:31,599
But it says in verse number three,

383
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:33,479
and Sarah Abram's wife took Hagar,

384
00:30:33,479 --> 00:30:35,239
her maid in the Egyptian,

385
00:30:35,239 --> 00:30:39,599
after Abram had dwelt 10 years in the land of Canaan

386
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:42,859
and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife.

387
00:30:42,859 --> 00:30:44,079
10 years, a long time.

388
00:30:45,619 --> 00:30:47,879
Waiting on the Lord isn't always easy.

389
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:49,999
There are times in which we're trying to wait on the Lord

390
00:30:49,999 --> 00:30:51,979
and we begin to rely on our own understanding.

391
00:30:51,979 --> 00:30:54,039
We try to figure it out ourselves.

392
00:30:54,039 --> 00:30:58,199
We try to make things happen, right?

393
00:30:59,199 --> 00:31:01,999
Because waiting on God isn't always easy.

394
00:31:01,999 --> 00:31:05,019
In chapter number 17,

395
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:10,159
we find that Abraham is crying out to God

396
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,959
after God has given him the promise of a son

397
00:31:12,959 --> 00:31:15,579
that would be born, that being Isaac.

398
00:31:15,579 --> 00:31:18,299
In verse number 18, Abraham cries out to the Lord

399
00:31:18,299 --> 00:31:21,839
and says, oh, that Ishmael might live before thee.

400
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:25,439
God answers that plea and tells Abraham

401
00:31:25,439 --> 00:31:27,479
that he would bless Ishmael

402
00:31:27,479 --> 00:31:29,399
and he would make him fruitful

403
00:31:29,399 --> 00:31:33,659
and multiply him exceedingly in verse number 20.

404
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:38,199
But can you understand Abraham at this particular time

405
00:31:38,199 --> 00:31:41,559
crying out to God and saying, oh, that Ishmael might live?

406
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:44,999
I mean, it's been a long time that I've been waiting.

407
00:31:44,999 --> 00:31:46,159
It's been a long time.

408
00:31:47,579 --> 00:31:50,779
And this evening, you might be waiting on God for something.

409
00:31:52,339 --> 00:31:55,639
And you might be kind of getting weary waiting,

410
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:58,239
getting weary in waiting.

411
00:31:58,239 --> 00:32:00,079
Well, let me remind you of what Paul says

412
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:02,399
to the believers in the book of Galatians

413
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:04,579
in chapter number six.

414
00:32:04,579 --> 00:32:07,039
He says, let us not be weary in well-doing

415
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:11,219
for in due season we shall reap if we faint not.

416
00:32:11,219 --> 00:32:13,959
In Galatians six and verse number nine.

417
00:32:13,959 --> 00:32:18,039
Sometimes when we wait, if we're not careful, we can faint.

418
00:32:19,639 --> 00:32:20,939
Waiting is not easy.

419
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:25,499
But I will say this, on the flip side,

420
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:27,219
not only do we acknowledge this evening

421
00:32:27,219 --> 00:32:29,639
that waiting on the Lord isn't always easy,

422
00:32:29,639 --> 00:32:31,539
but I would say number two,

423
00:32:31,539 --> 00:32:36,539
waiting on the Lord is always worth it, always.

424
00:32:37,619 --> 00:32:42,579
It's not always easy, but it is always worth it.

425
00:32:42,579 --> 00:32:44,819
I don't believe you'll regret waiting on God

426
00:32:46,219 --> 00:32:48,519
because you get to see God do what only God can do.

427
00:32:48,519 --> 00:32:51,979
And you see God work in ways that are miraculous.

428
00:32:51,979 --> 00:32:55,379
And we find that God always does, as we said,

429
00:32:56,219 --> 00:32:58,299
in Genesis 21, as we looked at those first two verses

430
00:32:58,299 --> 00:33:01,139
of Scripture, as he had said, as he had spoken,

431
00:33:01,139 --> 00:33:04,619
at the set time of which God had spoken to him,

432
00:33:04,619 --> 00:33:05,959
that God is faithful.

433
00:33:05,959 --> 00:33:09,499
And as we begin to wait on God, and as we're in that season,

434
00:33:09,499 --> 00:33:10,679
as we're waiting on the Lord,

435
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:12,619
we find that it's always worth it.

436
00:33:13,459 --> 00:33:16,899
God is able to do things far better than you or I.

437
00:33:18,379 --> 00:33:20,139
We make a mess of things.

438
00:33:21,179 --> 00:33:23,739
Sometimes we get ahead of God.

439
00:33:23,739 --> 00:33:27,259
You understand that God's timeline isn't your timeline.

440
00:33:27,259 --> 00:33:29,219
Sometimes we wish it was, don't we?

441
00:33:30,179 --> 00:33:33,459
We like to think that we got the timeline

442
00:33:33,459 --> 00:33:35,419
how it needs to be, and okay, I'm ready for this to happen,

443
00:33:35,419 --> 00:33:36,859
I'm ready for that to happen.

444
00:33:38,139 --> 00:33:40,859
I remember personally in our own lives

445
00:33:40,859 --> 00:33:44,539
when we were seeking the Lord with regard to ministry,

446
00:33:44,539 --> 00:33:47,699
full-time ministry, and working in the,

447
00:33:47,699 --> 00:33:48,739
graduating from Bible college,

448
00:33:48,739 --> 00:33:50,259
knowing that God called me to the ministry,

449
00:33:50,259 --> 00:33:51,679
and then working in the corporate world,

450
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:55,519
working in churches, and helping as youth ministry,

451
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:57,479
various aspects of ministry,

452
00:33:57,479 --> 00:33:59,439
but just really coming to a place of knowing

453
00:33:59,439 --> 00:34:03,679
that it was time for us to go full-time into ministry.

454
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:05,559
Things were great in the corporate world,

455
00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:08,599
things were wonderful there as far as career path,

456
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:09,439
and so on and so forth,

457
00:34:09,439 --> 00:34:11,719
but I just knew in our personal devotions,

458
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:14,239
in our sitting under the preaching of the word of God,

459
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,899
we just knew it was time.

460
00:34:16,839 --> 00:34:18,919
And that really was a season of,

461
00:34:19,799 --> 00:34:22,679
I would describe it as really agonizing,

462
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:25,279
and really just struggling with,

463
00:34:25,279 --> 00:34:29,039
God, are you sure it's time now?

464
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:30,799
Because you don't want to make sure.

465
00:34:31,759 --> 00:34:33,660
And I remember Holly and I talking,

466
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:35,479
and I remember all that we dealt with,

467
00:34:35,479 --> 00:34:36,759
and all that we went through,

468
00:34:36,759 --> 00:34:38,720
and then I remember meeting with my pastor,

469
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,479
and talking to my pastor, and him saying,

470
00:34:40,479 --> 00:34:42,899
yeah, I know, absolutely, it's time for you to go

471
00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:44,639
full-time into ministry, I think this is great,

472
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:47,079
so on and so forth, and just after that,

473
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:48,720
you know what God said?

474
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:50,359
Wait.

475
00:34:53,479 --> 00:34:55,599
Is that not what God said?

476
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:56,799
Here's what I thought.

477
00:34:58,079 --> 00:34:59,479
You know what I thought, Ron?

478
00:34:59,479 --> 00:35:01,239
I thought that when I came to the place

479
00:35:01,239 --> 00:35:04,359
of fully surrendering, and saying, okay, God,

480
00:35:04,359 --> 00:35:07,019
you said it's time, I've agonized through this,

481
00:35:07,019 --> 00:35:09,399
I've struggled with this, we've worked through this,

482
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:11,000
I've counseled with my pastor,

483
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,220
and I've come to the place saying, okay, let's go,

484
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:15,819
that God was gonna give me marching orders tomorrow.

485
00:35:19,479 --> 00:35:22,799
It was about eight months before I ever heard one word.

486
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:25,880
You know what we did?

487
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,599
We just kept serving God.

488
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,919
We just kept doing what we were doing.

489
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:31,299
Just waiting on God.

490
00:35:31,299 --> 00:35:34,359
Brother Armando, I remember hearing about a church,

491
00:35:34,359 --> 00:35:36,099
the first church that I heard about

492
00:35:36,099 --> 00:35:38,160
that needed a pastor was in West Virginia,

493
00:35:39,399 --> 00:35:40,880
and I remember hearing a man talk about it,

494
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,599
this church that needs this pastor,

495
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,479
and I remember thinking, maybe that's the place

496
00:35:45,479 --> 00:35:47,119
that God has for us.

497
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:49,619
I remember sitting in our church feeling that way.

498
00:35:50,959 --> 00:35:51,880
But you know what?

499
00:35:52,919 --> 00:35:53,759
It wasn't.

500
00:35:54,959 --> 00:35:58,139
And just waiting on God, and just waiting on God.

501
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:03,039
Waiting is not always easy, but it's always worth it.

502
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:08,039
It's always worth it, because God's timing is perfect,

503
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,919
and God has a plan, and right now,

504
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:13,919
you might not see exactly all that that plan is.

505
00:36:13,919 --> 00:36:16,160
Oftentimes in our lives, it's a whole lot easier

506
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,319
as we look back on it, and oh, we see how God is working,

507
00:36:19,319 --> 00:36:21,839
and we see now what God was doing,

508
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:23,559
but in the moment, right?

509
00:36:23,559 --> 00:36:27,039
We're living in that moment, we say, what is God doing?

510
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:31,319
I'm ready, Lord, I'm surrendered, Lord, I'm willing, Lord.

511
00:36:31,319 --> 00:36:32,279
God says, wait.

512
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:34,440
Wait.

513
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:38,819
I mentioned earlier the part of the verse

514
00:36:38,819 --> 00:36:41,239
of Numbers 23 and verse number 19,

515
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:43,199
and let me just read that verse to you,

516
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:45,079
and then I'm gonna look at a number of verses

517
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:47,199
with regard to waiting on the Lord,

518
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:49,799
but in Numbers chapter 23, I want you to notice

519
00:36:49,799 --> 00:36:53,440
what God says here in this portion of scripture.

520
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,119
In verse number 19, it says this.

521
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:57,479
God is not a man that he should lie,

522
00:36:57,479 --> 00:36:59,559
neither the son of man that he should repent.

523
00:36:59,559 --> 00:37:02,479
Hath he said, and shall he not do it?

524
00:37:02,479 --> 00:37:06,319
Or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?

525
00:37:06,319 --> 00:37:08,720
This is directly in the context in which

526
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:13,199
Balaam was called in to curse the people of God.

527
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:18,479
And Balaam says, listen, God is not a man that he should lie,

528
00:37:18,479 --> 00:37:20,519
neither the son of man that he should repent.

529
00:37:20,519 --> 00:37:23,919
Hath he said, and shall he not do it?

530
00:37:23,919 --> 00:37:28,639
Or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?

531
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:31,160
Several weeks ago, I preached a message,

532
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,519
speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth,

533
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:35,559
and looking at the life of Samuel,

534
00:37:35,559 --> 00:37:38,639
and we looked at the truth in Revelation chapter number one,

535
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:41,720
where the Lord says to John,

536
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:43,880
there's some things he needs to write down,

537
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:48,880
and that these things must shortly come to pass.

538
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:52,759
These things must shortly come to pass.

539
00:37:52,759 --> 00:37:55,639
See, God always does what he says he's going to do.

540
00:37:55,639 --> 00:37:58,919
You say, man, I wish he'd return tonight.

541
00:37:58,919 --> 00:38:00,079
I'm sure you do.

542
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:02,440
A whole lot of us do, amen?

543
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:05,000
I hear the words of Brother Mershawn all the time.

544
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,799
I'm looking for the upper taker, not the undertaker.

545
00:38:07,799 --> 00:38:10,799
Listen, even so come, Lord Jesus, right?

546
00:38:10,799 --> 00:38:11,759
Listen for the trumpet.

547
00:38:11,759 --> 00:38:14,500
Jesus is coming, and he is coming,

548
00:38:15,619 --> 00:38:18,839
but he's coming at a set time.

549
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:20,039
No man knows the hour.

550
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:21,079
We don't know when he's coming,

551
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:23,239
but we know that he's coming,

552
00:38:23,239 --> 00:38:25,259
and I know that certainly for us,

553
00:38:25,259 --> 00:38:27,259
man, it'd be okay if he came right now,

554
00:38:28,399 --> 00:38:30,399
but if he doesn't come right now,

555
00:38:30,399 --> 00:38:34,799
it means that he still has a task for us to do right now

556
00:38:34,799 --> 00:38:37,219
as we continue to wait upon him,

557
00:38:37,219 --> 00:38:38,880
knowing that his timing is perfect.

558
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:39,839
Think about these verses.

559
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:42,799
Turn to the book of Psalms, if you will, Psalm 27.

560
00:38:42,799 --> 00:38:44,959
Read about four verses or so from the book of Psalms,

561
00:38:44,959 --> 00:38:47,320
and then we'll look at two other passages of scripture,

562
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,880
and then wrap it up this evening.

563
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,119
Psalm 27, let's read these fairly quickly,

564
00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:54,520
and we'll get over to our fellowship this evening.

565
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,559
Psalm 27, in verse number 14,

566
00:38:56,559 --> 00:38:58,599
notice what the word of God says.

567
00:38:58,599 --> 00:39:03,599
Wait on the Lord, be of good courage,

568
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:07,000
and he shall strengthen thine heart.

569
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Wait, I say, on the Lord, chapter 33 and verse number 20.

570
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:18,959
Notice this.

571
00:39:18,959 --> 00:39:22,479
Our soul waiteth for the Lord.

572
00:39:22,479 --> 00:39:26,559
He is our help and our shield.

573
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,799
Aren't you thankful the Lord is our helper?

574
00:39:30,799 --> 00:39:32,080
He's our helper.

575
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:32,919
He's our shield.

576
00:39:32,919 --> 00:39:34,159
He protects us.

577
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:36,200
Look at Psalm 62, if you will.

578
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,320
Verses one and also verse number five.

579
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,959
Look at these two verses here in Psalm 62.

580
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:50,320
The Bible says, truly, my soul waiteth upon God.

581
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,080
From him cometh my salvation.

582
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,719
He only is my rock and my salvation.

583
00:39:55,719 --> 00:39:56,919
He is my defense.

584
00:39:56,919 --> 00:39:58,440
I shall not be greatly moved.

585
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,599
Look at verse number five.

586
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:02,599
My soul, wait thou only upon God.

587
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:11,919
God, for my expectation is from Him. Are you expecting God to work? Anticipating God working?

588
00:40:11,919 --> 00:40:15,239
Looking forward to seeing God work? You say, I don't know how all this stuff is going to

589
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:22,799
work out. God is able. Abraham, waiting on the Lord. God promised He was going to give

590
00:40:22,799 --> 00:40:31,639
me a son. It's not happened yet. How is it going to happen? Sarah, I'm old. It's beyond.

591
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:42,879
Is anything too hard for the Lord? God did what He said He would do. Look at Psalm 130.

592
00:40:42,879 --> 00:40:55,599
Psalm 130, verse 5. I wait for the Lord, my soul doth wait, and in His word do I hope.

593
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:59,879
My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning. I say more than

594
00:40:59,879 --> 00:41:04,679
they that watch for the morning. Waiting on the Lord. Notice it says not only waiting

595
00:41:04,679 --> 00:41:07,919
on the Lord. Listen, when we think about waiting on the Lord, it's not that we're sitting idle

596
00:41:07,919 --> 00:41:12,399
doing nothing. I told you that when we waited for those seven months, that was before we

597
00:41:12,399 --> 00:41:16,719
ever even got a call about Fellowship Baptist Church, that we waited for seven months. We

598
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:21,039
kept serving God. I kept teaching the adult Sunday school class. I remember that each

599
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:24,079
time we'd start a new quarter, my pastor would meet with me and say, are you sure you want

600
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:26,399
to start a new quarter? We don't know when you're going to leave. We don't know when

601
00:41:26,399 --> 00:41:30,399
God's going to open up a door. I said, well, as far as we know right now, I'm here, so

602
00:41:30,399 --> 00:41:37,599
let's just keep teaching if you're okay with it. I just kept on teaching. Kept on serving.

603
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:45,359
As we wait on the Lord, it says in verse number 5, and in His word do I hope. Do I hope. Having

604
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:50,999
that confidence that God's going to do what He said He's going to do. That blessed hope

605
00:41:51,159 --> 00:41:57,359
that Paul speaks of when he's writing and encouraging Titus, in Titus chapter number

606
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:02,999
2. We're familiar with this verse of scripture, Isaiah 40 and verse number 31. Someone years

607
00:42:02,999 --> 00:42:11,999
ago no doubt put this particular verse to song, and it is a good scripture song in Isaiah

608
00:42:11,999 --> 00:42:16,639
40 and verse number 31. But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength.

609
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:20,679
They shall mount up with wings as eagles. They shall run and not be weary. They shall

610
00:42:20,679 --> 00:42:26,239
walk and not faint. Then I want you to think about this in James chapter number 5, and

611
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:33,919
we'll close with this verse of scripture. In James chapter number 5, as you're turning

612
00:42:33,919 --> 00:42:39,119
to James, let me remind you of what the writer of Hebrews says in Hebrews 10 and verse 37,

613
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:45,759
if we get a little while, and he that shall come will come and will not tarry. Aren't

614
00:42:45,759 --> 00:42:51,039
you thankful for that promise? No doubt at some point in your life you've heard someone

615
00:42:51,039 --> 00:42:57,959
say if the Lord doesn't tarry His coming, He's not going to. He says He will not tarry.

616
00:42:57,959 --> 00:43:07,239
He's coming right on time. But notice what James says in James 5 and verse number 7.

617
00:43:07,239 --> 00:43:14,079
It says be patient therefore brethren unto the coming of the Lord. Notice this, behold

618
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:22,799
the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth and hath long patience for it

619
00:43:22,799 --> 00:43:28,179
until he receive the early and latter rain. Isn't that a great example or illustration

620
00:43:28,179 --> 00:43:34,519
analogy that he gives? How many of you ever planted anything? Did you plant it and then

621
00:43:34,519 --> 00:43:42,999
tomorrow go reap your harvest? It doesn't work that way, right? I know they say often

622
00:43:42,999 --> 00:43:48,219
about corn that by the 4th of July it should be around knee high and then by whatever some

623
00:43:48,219 --> 00:43:50,999
date in August it should be close to your shoulder and so on and so forth. It takes

624
00:43:50,999 --> 00:43:57,999
time. There's a process, right? And so you go out there and notice what it says about

625
00:43:57,999 --> 00:44:03,459
the husbandman, the one that's doing that, it says that he waiteth for the precious fruit

626
00:44:03,459 --> 00:44:10,839
of the earth and it says and hath long patience for it. And then it says this, as that analogy

627
00:44:10,839 --> 00:44:15,399
or illustration is given in verse number 7 about the husbandman, James then turns his

628
00:44:15,399 --> 00:44:21,559
attention to the believers and said be ye also patient, establish your hearts for the

629
00:44:21,559 --> 00:44:30,519
coming of the Lord draweth nigh. He's coming. He's coming. We don't know when he's coming

630
00:44:30,519 --> 00:44:36,799
but he's going to. As he had said, as he had spoken. Those are the words that we read in

631
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:42,039
verse number 1 of Genesis 21. How encouraging for Abraham. Can you put yourself in that

632
00:44:42,039 --> 00:44:51,219
position? 25 years. It wasn't just a singular promise that was made, it was oft repeated.

633
00:44:51,219 --> 00:44:57,679
The Lord often came back to him and told him of this promise and yet he was waiting. Listen,

634
00:44:57,679 --> 00:45:06,399
waiting isn't always easy but waiting is always worth it. I'm not sure in your life what it

635
00:45:06,399 --> 00:45:10,639
is that you're waiting on the Lord to do. You're waiting on some direction from the

636
00:45:10,639 --> 00:45:17,879
Lord. It's not easy waiting but it's always worth it. See if we're not careful we can

637
00:45:17,879 --> 00:45:24,919
get ahead of God. We can get ahead of God. And we don't want to get ahead of God. Amen?

638
00:45:24,919 --> 00:45:32,559
It'd be much better that God is leading us than us trying to lead God. Amen? And so wait

639
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:38,719
on the Lord. Wait on God. Be encouraged tonight from this portion of scripture in Genesis

640
00:45:38,719 --> 00:45:44,559
21 because those statements in verses 1 and 2 they reveal to us and remind us of the faithfulness

641
00:45:44,559 --> 00:45:50,639
of God. Our God is faithful. But then determine that you're going to obey God because the

642
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:57,199
actions that are noted in verse 3 and 4 reveal to us the obedience of Abraham. He called

643
00:45:57,199 --> 00:46:02,839
his name Isaac and he circumcised him on the eighth day. Oh that we would make that

644
00:46:02,839 --> 00:46:09,439
commitment. I'm going to obey the Lord. I will obey. We sing trust and obey. Obedience

645
00:46:09,439 --> 00:46:15,159
is the very best way to show that you believe. Doing exactly what the Lord commanded and

646
00:46:15,159 --> 00:46:23,879
doing it how? Happily. Amen? And so we find in Genesis 21 the fulfillment of a great promise.

647
00:46:23,879 --> 00:46:29,519
God always does what God says He will do. And we ought to rejoice greatly in that truth

648
00:46:29,519 --> 00:46:34,679
tonight. Amen? Let's pray together. Father we love You. We thank You for loving us. We

649
00:46:34,679 --> 00:46:39,239
thank You for the Word of God. We thank You for the truth that is revealed to us in this

650
00:46:39,239 --> 00:46:49,039
portion of scripture. And God I pray that as we are mindful tonight of Your faithfulness

651
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:56,319
that Lord You would minister to our hearts and help us to just be encouraged, to be strengthened.

652
00:46:56,319 --> 00:47:02,519
I pray that as we consider the obedience of Abraham that You'd help us to determine to

653
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:11,639
obey You. Lord perhaps there are some that are in that season of waiting and I know that

654
00:47:11,639 --> 00:47:22,519
it's not always easy. But I know that it's worth it. And I pray God that You'd help us.

655
00:47:22,519 --> 00:47:26,679
Would You move and work as only You can. We'll give You the glory for each decision that's

656
00:47:26,679 --> 00:47:28,399
made. For it's in Christ's name we pray. Would You
