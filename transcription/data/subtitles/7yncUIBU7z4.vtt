WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.920
in our society today, much opposition,

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.860
but we're thankful that God's on his throne

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.099
and he's given us wonderful truth in his word.

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:10.140
Hebrews chapter number five this evening,

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.460
Hebrews chapter number five this evening,

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.219
and be looking at verses 11 through 14 tonight,

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:18.760
a familiar passage of scripture for some of us,

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.739
and be dealing with this continued thought

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:25.879
with regard to doing what we ought to do.

00:00:25.879 --> 00:00:27.520
Doing what we ought to do.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.639
I said this in the very first message of this new series,

00:00:30.639 --> 00:00:32.240
it's only three weeks in,

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.880
and of course I wasn't here last week,

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.040
we were at the pastor's meeting,

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.680
but the Mark filled in for me,

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.040
and I certainly appreciate him doing that,

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.080
and but this is the third lesson in this mini series,

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.380
but I said this in the very first week,

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.720
just because we know that we ought to do something

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.560
doesn't mean we do it.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.639
All right, would you agree with that?

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:51.880
All right, you ever eat something

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.720
that you knew you shouldn't have eaten?

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.619
You said, yeah, this is not gonna be good for me,

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:57.540
but man, it's gonna taste good, right?

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.340
And you did something that you knew you shouldn't do,

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.840
but you did it anyway, there are times on the flip side,

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.339
we know what we ought to do,

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:05.819
I ought to eat more green beans

00:01:05.819 --> 00:01:07.860
instead of eating whatever it might be,

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.980
and that's just a silly analogy,

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.139
but the reality is that we know

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:14.220
that we don't always do the things

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.260
that we know that we ought to do.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.220
Some of these are reminders for us,

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.580
but let me remind you of what Peter said

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.900
when he's writing to the persecuted believers,

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.220
he said, I'm gonna stir you up

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.339
by putting you in remembrance of these things,

00:01:28.339 --> 00:01:29.980
though you know them,

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.419
I'm gonna put you in remembrance of them, why?

00:01:32.419 --> 00:01:34.339
We need to be reminded of some things,

00:01:34.339 --> 00:01:36.500
and in our text of scripture this evening,

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.819
the phraseology that is used

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:44.180
is that when the time that you ought to be teachers,

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.160
and we see that use of that word ought,

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.819
and that's what we're chasing after

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:52.180
as we're studying through this particular series,

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.580
if you will, doing what we ought to do,

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.220
I've titled the message for this evening,

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.379
we ought to grow spiritually.

00:02:00.379 --> 00:02:03.180
We ought to grow spiritually.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.419
As you read the New Testament in particular,

00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:09.139
I believe that we are regularly confronted

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:12.139
with the subject of our walk with the Lord.

00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:14.419
Regularly throughout the New Testament,

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:17.779
you find that God is challenging His people

00:02:17.779 --> 00:02:19.339
with regard to their walk,

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:22.979
we understand the truth that after an individual

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:25.699
trusts Christ as their personal savior,

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:27.300
that they're to walk with the Lord

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.380
and they are to grow spiritually.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.740
I believe that it's an expectation,

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.020
I believe it's a valid expectation

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.500
that God would have of His children

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.500
that we grow spiritually.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.520
I believe that as we would look at the New Testament,

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.300
we look here at this text of scripture

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.139
with this idea of we ought to grow spiritually,

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:47.860
look at verse number 11,

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.500
the Bible says this,

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.880
of whom we have many things to say,

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.199
and hard to be uttered.

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:56.080
What made them hard to be uttered

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.600
really wasn't so much the context of what Paul,

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.600
I believe he is the writer of the human penman

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.839
for the book of Hebrews,

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:04.619
was desiring to say to them,

00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:07.580
but what really made it hard to be uttered

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.800
was the last phrase of verse number 11,

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.960
seeing ye are dull of hearing.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.639
For when for the time ye ought to be teachers,

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:20.740
ye have need that one teach you again,

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.940
which be the first principles of the oracles of God.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.020
And it becomes such as have need of milk

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.820
and not of strong meat.

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.360
For everyone that useth milk is unskillful

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.800
in the word of righteousness,

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.580
for he is a babe.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.320
But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age,

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.000
even those who by reason of use

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.740
have their senses exercised to discern

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.100
both good and evil.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.220
As we begin to look at this portion of scripture

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.100
and really think about the truth broadly speaking

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.339
throughout the New Testament

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:56.039
that we ought to grow spiritually,

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:57.940
I wanna remind you that the believers

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.259
in the church in Corinth,

00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:02.380
they were corrected because they were carnal

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.619
and therefore incapable of receiving

00:04:05.619 --> 00:04:08.539
the meat, quote unquote, of the word.

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:11.300
In fact, in 1 Corinthians chapter number three,

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.660
if you wanna jot the reference down

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.699
in 1 Corinthians chapter three,

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:17.100
in verses one through three,

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.980
the apostle Paul makes this appeal

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.019
to the church in Corinth

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:21.980
and really is correcting them

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.859
because of their carnality.

00:04:23.859 --> 00:04:27.260
And he says this in 1 Corinthians three in verse one,

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.299
and I, brethren, could not speak unto you

00:04:30.299 --> 00:04:34.019
as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal,

00:04:34.019 --> 00:04:36.220
even as unto babes in Christ.

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:37.059
Doesn't this sound familiar

00:04:37.059 --> 00:04:38.619
to what we just read in Hebrews?

00:04:38.619 --> 00:04:40.440
Paul says, I have some things to say to you,

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.619
but they're hard to be uttered

00:04:41.619 --> 00:04:43.820
seeing you are dull of hearing.

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.700
Here he says that I can't speak these things unto you,

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.500
not because Paul didn't know them,

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.700
not because Paul wasn't capable of teaching them,

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.559
but because they were carnal.

00:04:54.559 --> 00:04:57.980
And therefore they were not ready to receive

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.720
that which Paul wanted to teach them.

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:01.940
In verse number two,

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.420
I have fed you with milk and not with meat.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:08.500
For hitherto you were not able to bear it,

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.299
neither yet now are you able.

00:05:11.299 --> 00:05:13.619
For ye are yet carnal,

00:05:13.619 --> 00:05:15.899
for whereas there is among you envying

00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:17.980
and strife and divisions,

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:22.019
are ye not carnal and walk as men?

00:05:22.019 --> 00:05:24.540
And so we find a church there in Corinth

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.820
that is being corrected because of their carnality

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.339
and their lack of spiritual growth,

00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:32.179
but yet we find, on the other hand,

00:05:32.179 --> 00:05:34.059
the believers in Thessalonica

00:05:34.059 --> 00:05:37.100
which are commended for their spiritual growth.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:38.100
And what's very interesting

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.059
as you begin to think about the church in Thessalonica,

00:05:40.059 --> 00:05:41.959
turn over to 1 Thessalonians chapter two,

00:05:41.959 --> 00:05:43.299
if you will, very quickly,

00:05:43.299 --> 00:05:46.339
and then we'll get to our text in Hebrews chapter five.

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:48.739
But in 1 Thessalonians chapter two,

00:05:48.739 --> 00:05:50.320
we find that the apostle Paul

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.019
is writing to this church in Thessalonica

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:56.799
and really here he's giving us this great insight

00:05:56.799 --> 00:06:00.859
with regard to the believers in Thessalonica

00:06:00.859 --> 00:06:05.320
and their approach or their receiving of God's word.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.940
Notice in 1 Thessalonians two in verse 13,

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:10.019
the Bible says this,

00:06:10.019 --> 00:06:13.859
for this cause also thank we God without ceasing.

00:06:13.859 --> 00:06:14.739
Notice what he says,

00:06:14.739 --> 00:06:17.380
because when you receive the word of God

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:18.980
which you heard of us,

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:23.059
you received it not as the word of men,

00:06:23.059 --> 00:06:25.779
but as it is in truth, the word of God,

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:30.779
which effectually worketh also in you that believe.

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:32.700
Isn't that a great verse of scripture

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:35.779
that gives us some understanding

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:39.940
with regard to the mindset of the believers in Thessalonica

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:41.660
that these in the church,

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:46.660
they received the word as Paul and company came and preached,

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.480
they received the word of God,

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.140
which they heard of Paul as he would preach,

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:53.739
but they didn't receive it

00:06:53.739 --> 00:06:55.859
like they would receive the word of men.

00:06:55.859 --> 00:06:58.660
See, because God's word is not man's word

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:01.940
and God's word is not to be treated like any other book,

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:03.619
than any other periodical,

00:07:03.619 --> 00:07:07.260
any other magazine or any other thing that you would read.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.420
This is God's word and notice what it says,

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:15.420
which effectually worketh also in you that believe.

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:19.260
I'm thankful this evening for God's word

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.779
working in the lives of his people.

00:07:22.779 --> 00:07:25.320
And we find here this evening

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.019
that the church in Thessalonica,

00:07:27.019 --> 00:07:30.459
they had a proper understanding of God's word,

00:07:30.459 --> 00:07:33.100
which led to growth in their lives.

00:07:33.619 --> 00:07:37.500
And if you notice in 2 Thessalonians chapter number one,

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:38.980
in verse number three,

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:41.619
2 Thessalonians one in verse number three,

00:07:41.619 --> 00:07:44.579
Paul says, we are bound to thank God always for you,

00:07:44.579 --> 00:07:45.859
brethren, as it is meat.

00:07:45.859 --> 00:07:46.739
Why?

00:07:46.739 --> 00:07:50.380
Because that your faith groweth exceedingly

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:52.540
and the charity of every one of you

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:55.940
all toward each other aboundeth.

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:58.459
And so we see that the church in Thessalonica

00:07:58.459 --> 00:08:01.339
is a church that is growing spiritually

00:08:01.339 --> 00:08:06.339
and a key for them is their understanding of God's word

00:08:07.299 --> 00:08:09.980
and their receiving of God's word.

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:12.619
And so the passage in Hebrews chapter number five,

00:08:12.619 --> 00:08:15.660
I believe that it confronts every believer

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:19.779
and then begs us to evaluate our own lives

00:08:19.779 --> 00:08:22.600
to consider our spiritual growth.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.500
Each one of us are at a different place

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.059
in our Christian journey.

00:08:26.059 --> 00:08:27.019
Amen, each one of us,

00:08:27.019 --> 00:08:28.980
a different place in our Christian journey.

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:31.899
And the reality is that there are some here

00:08:31.899 --> 00:08:35.380
that have been saved for 40 years or more.

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:38.020
There's some that have been saved for 20 to 40 years,

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:40.419
some that have been saved for just a couple of years.

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:42.260
I remember when I first got to Bible college

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.820
on the day that I started Bible college

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:46.460
was my spiritual birthday.

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:48.719
I was one year old in the Lord.

00:08:48.719 --> 00:08:52.260
I had trusted Christ on August 31st, 1997

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.580
and I started Bible college on August 31st, 1998.

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:58.419
And I was one year old in the Lord

00:08:58.419 --> 00:09:02.140
and I was immature spiritually speaking.

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:05.940
I did not know that I've said this before,

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:09.700
a very first day, very first class Old Testament survey.

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:12.260
The professor thought he was being smart

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:13.539
and said, take out a piece of paper

00:09:13.539 --> 00:09:15.619
and write all the books of the Old Testament in order.

00:09:15.619 --> 00:09:19.340
And I could not, I was lost, I was in a mess.

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:21.739
Now the reality is that some of us here tonight

00:09:21.739 --> 00:09:23.619
that maybe been saved 20, 30 years,

00:09:23.619 --> 00:09:26.539
we may not know the books of the Bible in order.

00:09:26.619 --> 00:09:29.599
We really should, amen.

00:09:29.599 --> 00:09:30.900
It's not really that hard of a thing.

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:34.059
I remember listening to some people share and quote some,

00:09:34.059 --> 00:09:35.500
we support Hope Children's Home.

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:37.559
It wasn't Hope Children's Home, it was another one.

00:09:37.559 --> 00:09:41.020
And these young people stood up on the platform

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:42.580
in a service and they said,

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:43.940
all the books of the Bible in order.

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:45.500
And I thought, okay, that's wonderful.

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:48.000
And then they said them all in order backwards.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.979
And I said, now that's a little different right there.

00:09:50.979 --> 00:09:53.460
And I have a hard time saying the alphabet backwards.

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:55.020
I can say it forward, no problem,

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:56.700
but backwards, it takes me a little while.

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:58.020
I gotta think about it, right?

00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:00.619
And really what I'm doing is I'm saying it in order.

00:10:00.619 --> 00:10:02.579
order in my head and then just trying to remember

00:10:02.579 --> 00:10:04.299
to say it backwards.

00:10:04.299 --> 00:10:06.299
But what I'm saying this evening is that we're all

00:10:06.299 --> 00:10:10.299
at a different place on how long we've been saved,

00:10:10.299 --> 00:10:12.579
but we ought to be able to evaluate our lives

00:10:12.579 --> 00:10:14.499
and say what kind of spiritual growth

00:10:14.499 --> 00:10:16.939
is evidenced in my life?

00:10:16.939 --> 00:10:19.819
Is there spiritual growth evidenced in my life?

00:10:19.819 --> 00:10:22.899
And a passage like this, when we deal with the subject

00:10:22.899 --> 00:10:27.659
doing what we ought to do and we ought to grow spiritually,

00:10:27.699 --> 00:10:32.259
the passage does not simply call out, if you will,

00:10:32.259 --> 00:10:35.179
these believers that are being written to

00:10:35.179 --> 00:10:37.099
in this passage of scripture,

00:10:37.099 --> 00:10:40.139
but it also causes us to pause and reflect

00:10:40.139 --> 00:10:42.899
and say let me evaluate my own life

00:10:42.899 --> 00:10:45.299
and determine how am I doing spiritually?

00:10:45.299 --> 00:10:47.699
Am I growing spiritually?

00:10:47.699 --> 00:10:50.719
See, the reality is that it's a dangerous thing

00:10:50.719 --> 00:10:54.199
for us to ever just get comfortable spiritually.

00:10:55.059 --> 00:10:57.539
It's something interesting about spirituality

00:10:57.539 --> 00:10:58.739
and spiritual growth.

00:10:58.739 --> 00:11:00.899
There really is no place of stagnation.

00:11:00.899 --> 00:11:03.219
You're either going forward or you're going backwards.

00:11:03.219 --> 00:11:05.379
And that's a very interesting dynamic.

00:11:05.379 --> 00:11:08.179
I don't know how many of you here in the text of scripture,

00:11:08.179 --> 00:11:10.779
they often, in both the First Corinthians

00:11:10.779 --> 00:11:13.359
and here in Hebrews, they're using the analogy

00:11:13.359 --> 00:11:17.419
of milk and meat and dealing with babes and mature,

00:11:17.419 --> 00:11:19.579
and we'll look at some of that in just a moment,

00:11:19.579 --> 00:11:21.699
but if you do any kind of weight training,

00:11:21.699 --> 00:11:23.859
going to the gym and that sort of thing,

00:11:23.859 --> 00:11:26.579
you find out something very interesting

00:11:26.579 --> 00:11:28.939
when you're working out and you're making progress

00:11:28.939 --> 00:11:30.019
and you're making progress,

00:11:30.019 --> 00:11:32.739
but then you take a little bit of time off

00:11:32.739 --> 00:11:34.899
and you take a couple of weeks, three weeks, a month,

00:11:34.899 --> 00:11:37.019
maybe five weeks, but it hasn't been that long,

00:11:37.019 --> 00:11:38.459
and then you try to go back to the gym

00:11:38.459 --> 00:11:40.179
and do exactly what you were doing before,

00:11:40.179 --> 00:11:42.019
what do you find out?

00:11:42.019 --> 00:11:45.659
You find out that you've actually gone backwards, right?

00:11:45.659 --> 00:11:48.419
You didn't maintain it, you went backwards.

00:11:48.419 --> 00:11:50.699
It was a struggle, it was difficult,

00:11:50.699 --> 00:11:53.219
and really that's a great example for us

00:11:53.219 --> 00:11:55.619
with regard to spiritual living,

00:11:55.619 --> 00:12:00.199
and so we have to understand that spiritually speaking,

00:12:00.199 --> 00:12:02.459
I've said this many times over the years,

00:12:02.459 --> 00:12:05.059
you and I, we're as close to God today

00:12:05.059 --> 00:12:06.219
as we really wanna be.

00:12:07.119 --> 00:12:08.979
We're as close to God as we really wanna be.

00:12:08.979 --> 00:12:11.059
There's something interesting about spiritual growth

00:12:11.059 --> 00:12:12.919
versus physical growth.

00:12:12.919 --> 00:12:14.459
When you think about physical growth,

00:12:14.459 --> 00:12:18.220
there are certain expectations that we have of children

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:20.179
based upon their age.

00:12:20.179 --> 00:12:21.459
When they're at a certain age,

00:12:21.459 --> 00:12:24.179
we expect them to be able to do certain things.

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:26.199
When they're really just a couple of months old,

00:12:26.199 --> 00:12:28.619
we expect they're not gonna do anything but lay around,

00:12:28.619 --> 00:12:31.339
and if I leave them there, when I come back,

00:12:31.339 --> 00:12:32.739
they're still gonna be there.

00:12:32.739 --> 00:12:35.159
And then all of a sudden, they can start rolling over,

00:12:35.159 --> 00:12:36.539
and then they can start crawling,

00:12:36.539 --> 00:12:38.799
and what you find out is that where you left them

00:12:38.799 --> 00:12:40.940
is not where they are when you come back, right?

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:41.860
You know what I mean?

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:44.179
And then they start, Juliana told me this morning,

00:12:44.179 --> 00:12:45.739
Nova, she's growing so fast,

00:12:45.739 --> 00:12:48.419
she's like, she's gonna be walking so soon.

00:12:48.419 --> 00:12:51.940
I said, get ready, girl, fasten that buckle, right?

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:53.500
Because when they start walking,

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:55.739
it's a different dynamic, right?

00:12:55.739 --> 00:12:58.299
And then there's the talking, and then there's the reading,

00:12:58.299 --> 00:12:59.940
and so on and so forth, right?

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:04.940
And there are these growth expectations based upon the age.

00:13:05.619 --> 00:13:10.619
What happens physically if those milestones aren't met?

00:13:13.339 --> 00:13:14.699
Say it again?

00:13:14.699 --> 00:13:15.899
Go to a doctor.

00:13:15.899 --> 00:13:18.459
There's reason for concern, right?

00:13:18.459 --> 00:13:20.940
If you have a child that's two, three years old,

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:23.459
and they're not rolling over, they're not crawling,

00:13:24.299 --> 00:13:25.659
I'm expecting that you were at the doctor

00:13:25.659 --> 00:13:27.279
before they were two or three years old,

00:13:27.279 --> 00:13:30.339
because you had a concern as a parent

00:13:30.339 --> 00:13:34.519
that my child is not doing the things

00:13:34.519 --> 00:13:37.819
that they should be doing based upon their age.

00:13:37.819 --> 00:13:38.659
Am I right?

00:13:39.619 --> 00:13:40.979
Right, they have these growth charts.

00:13:40.979 --> 00:13:42.779
They're in the whatever percentile, right?

00:13:42.779 --> 00:13:44.860
You know, you take your kids to the doctor,

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:47.580
the pediatrician, your baby's in this percentile

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:49.739
of height and weight, and so on and so forth,

00:13:49.739 --> 00:13:52.819
and if it's not where it needs to be, you get concerned.

00:13:52.819 --> 00:13:54.179
If there's not steady growth,

00:13:54.179 --> 00:13:56.580
if there's not, you get concerned.

00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:58.299
Am I right?

00:13:58.299 --> 00:14:01.099
Spiritually, it's a lot different

00:14:01.099 --> 00:14:04.699
in the sense of how long you have been saved

00:14:04.699 --> 00:14:08.139
doesn't necessarily put you on a certain level

00:14:08.139 --> 00:14:10.099
of how spiritual you should be,

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:13.619
because as we are saved,

00:14:13.619 --> 00:14:15.199
the Holy Spirit of God lives within us,

00:14:15.199 --> 00:14:19.739
and we can, the youngest quote-unquote in Christ,

00:14:19.739 --> 00:14:23.699
the one that's been saved the fewest number of years

00:14:23.699 --> 00:14:27.579
could be the most spiritual person in the room.

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:30.139
Amen?

00:14:30.139 --> 00:14:32.660
Because spiritual growth is quite different

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:36.899
than physical growth, and spiritually speaking,

00:14:36.899 --> 00:14:41.899
that growth comes as we are longing for it and desiring it.

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:44.839
We're spending time with God, and we're in his word,

00:14:44.839 --> 00:14:47.540
and we're in his presence, and we're in church services,

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:50.419
and we're growing spiritually.

00:14:50.419 --> 00:14:52.019
And so as we look at this text of Scripture,

00:14:52.019 --> 00:14:53.339
if you're taking notes, number one,

00:14:53.339 --> 00:14:56.199
the condition, their condition noted.

00:14:56.199 --> 00:14:58.079
Their condition is noted for us.

00:14:58.079 --> 00:15:01.440
Notice some of the things that we get insight here

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:03.619
with regard to the condition of these

00:15:03.619 --> 00:15:07.559
that are being corrected in Hebrews chapter number five.

00:15:07.559 --> 00:15:10.260
Number one, they were dull of hearing,

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:11.859
according to verse number 11.

00:15:11.859 --> 00:15:14.220
The Bible says, of whom we have many things to say

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:15.660
and hard to be uttered.

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:18.320
Seeing ye are dull of hearing.

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:20.859
Now, that's not a compliment.

00:15:20.859 --> 00:15:21.699
Amen?

00:15:21.699 --> 00:15:23.019
This is a problem.

00:15:23.019 --> 00:15:26.139
In fact, we could look at a number of passages of Scripture.

00:15:26.139 --> 00:15:27.940
You could look at Matthew 13, 15.

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:30.660
You could look at Acts 28 and verse 27

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:32.540
and see some references with regard

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:34.820
to those that were dull of hearing.

00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:37.079
You can find many times in the Old Testament

00:15:37.079 --> 00:15:40.359
where God says of his people, I sent my prophets,

00:15:40.359 --> 00:15:42.799
but you would not hear them.

00:15:43.799 --> 00:15:46.040
And so they're dull of hearing.

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:48.959
The Bible tells us as we look at this passage of Scripture

00:15:48.959 --> 00:15:50.639
and consider their condition,

00:15:50.639 --> 00:15:54.359
it seems quite obvious to me that as you read verse number 12

00:15:54.359 --> 00:15:56.320
that these individuals being addressed,

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:58.239
that they had been saved for some time.

00:15:58.239 --> 00:16:00.459
These were not new converts.

00:16:00.459 --> 00:16:01.839
Why do I know they're not new converts?

00:16:01.839 --> 00:16:02.919
Well, the Bible says for when,

00:16:02.919 --> 00:16:04.959
for the time you ought to be teachers.

00:16:04.959 --> 00:16:09.059
There was an expectation that Paul had, that God had,

00:16:09.059 --> 00:16:10.359
that these individuals,

00:16:10.359 --> 00:16:12.100
after being saved for some period of time,

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:13.579
we don't know how long,

00:16:13.579 --> 00:16:16.619
but it would seem to me that they're not babes in Christ

00:16:16.619 --> 00:16:20.299
for we find other portions of Scripture

00:16:20.299 --> 00:16:23.699
that would help us understand those that are babes in Christ

00:16:23.699 --> 00:16:25.380
but the way it's written here,

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:28.459
it seems quite obvious to me that these people

00:16:28.459 --> 00:16:31.019
had been saved for some period of time

00:16:31.019 --> 00:16:34.019
and there was an expectation that they were now

00:16:34.019 --> 00:16:38.139
at a place where they should have grown spiritually

00:16:38.139 --> 00:16:42.940
for when, for the time you ought to be teachers.

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:47.679
You should be in a place where you have grown spiritually

00:16:47.679 --> 00:16:51.500
that you're able to go and give some level of instruction

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:54.859
to someone else and be able to teach them.

00:16:54.859 --> 00:16:57.239
Now, not every child of God

00:16:57.239 --> 00:16:59.779
has the spiritual gift of teaching.

00:16:59.779 --> 00:17:02.899
Not every child of God is going to have a podium

00:17:02.899 --> 00:17:06.699
or a platform or a pulpit to teach from,

00:17:06.699 --> 00:17:09.699
but the reality is that we have opportunities

00:17:09.699 --> 00:17:14.100
every day of our lives to teach people, to influence them,

00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:17.699
to teach them something about what we have learned

00:17:17.699 --> 00:17:21.820
about who God is and what God has done for us,

00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:23.619
what he tells us in his word.

00:17:23.619 --> 00:17:25.380
We find that they were dull of hearing,

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:27.059
they'd been saved for some time.

00:17:27.059 --> 00:17:28.919
I noticed this also when I think about

00:17:28.919 --> 00:17:30.579
their condition being noted,

00:17:30.579 --> 00:17:34.179
they were still babes in need of milk.

00:17:34.179 --> 00:17:35.699
They were still babes in need of milk.

00:17:36.339 --> 00:17:41.339
The reality this evening is that a babe that is a babe,

00:17:41.699 --> 00:17:42.779
it's not a problem.

00:17:43.739 --> 00:17:47.979
A new convert that's just been born again

00:17:47.979 --> 00:17:50.779
by the grace of God, they're a babe in Christ.

00:17:50.779 --> 00:17:53.940
As newborn babes, 1 Peter 2 and verse 2,

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:55.880
desire the sincere milk of the word

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:57.440
that you may grow thereby.

00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:00.100
It's not a problem to be a babe in Christ.

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:02.100
In fact, let me say it this way,

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:04.739
every single one of us, at one point,

00:18:04.739 --> 00:18:07.019
we were a babe in Christ.

00:18:07.019 --> 00:18:11.540
The problem is if we still are a babe in Christ.

00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:12.979
Does that make sense?

00:18:12.979 --> 00:18:15.419
And so he says in the text of scripture

00:18:15.419 --> 00:18:18.859
that they're still babes, still in need of milk.

00:18:18.859 --> 00:18:20.179
Notice in verse number 12,

00:18:20.179 --> 00:18:22.540
for when for the time you ought to be teachers,

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:24.820
you have need that one teach you again,

00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:26.619
which be, notice how he phrases this,

00:18:26.619 --> 00:18:31.059
the first principles of the oracles of God.

00:18:31.059 --> 00:18:33.020
And it becomes such as have need of milk

00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:35.059
and not of strong meat.

00:18:35.059 --> 00:18:37.460
For everyone that uses milk is unskillful

00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:40.859
in the word of righteousness, for he is a babe.

00:18:40.859 --> 00:18:43.960
And so we find here in verse number 12

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:46.059
that he talks about them being in need

00:18:46.059 --> 00:18:48.339
of someone teaching them, but not only teaching them,

00:18:48.339 --> 00:18:50.619
but teaching them, according to what it says here,

00:18:50.619 --> 00:18:53.320
the first principles of the oracles of God.

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:54.619
Could I say it this way?

00:18:54.619 --> 00:18:58.020
The basics, the basics.

00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:00.299
And it's not a problem if we need

00:19:00.299 --> 00:19:02.140
to be reminded of the basics,

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:04.739
but if we've been saved for any length of time,

00:19:04.739 --> 00:19:07.140
if we've been growing spiritually,

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:09.940
if we're taking the truth that's given to us

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:11.219
and we're evaluating our lives

00:19:11.219 --> 00:19:13.080
and we're saying I wanna grow spiritually,

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:18.080
I shouldn't need to someone teaching me the basics.

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:19.859
Is that fair this evening?

00:19:19.859 --> 00:19:23.000
And we see that here as we note their condition,

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.380
that their lack of spiritual growth,

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:27.460
these individuals that are being addressed

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:30.320
in Hebrews chapter five, different from what we find

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:32.900
in 1 Corinthians three, where their lack

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:36.619
of spiritual growth could be traced to their carnality.

00:19:36.619 --> 00:19:40.380
By the way, carnality will stunt your spiritual growth.

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:41.820
You try to have one foot in the world

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:42.739
and one foot in church,

00:19:42.739 --> 00:19:44.619
it's gonna stunt your spiritual growth.

00:19:44.619 --> 00:19:46.859
You cannot serve God in mammon.

00:19:46.859 --> 00:19:48.539
To love the world, the Bible says,

00:19:48.539 --> 00:19:50.760
is to be the enemy of God.

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:52.659
Does it not in the book of James?

00:19:52.659 --> 00:19:54.539
You adulterers, that's what he calls them.

00:19:54.539 --> 00:19:55.940
You know, in the Old Testament,

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:57.900
we think about adultery and so often,

00:19:57.900 --> 00:19:59.380
we think about it in the context

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:01.179
of a husband and wife relationship.

00:20:01.179 --> 00:20:02.679
and certainly that's true,

00:20:02.679 --> 00:20:04.719
but I want you to understand in the Old Testament,

00:20:04.719 --> 00:20:08.159
many times when the nation of Israel and Judah

00:20:08.159 --> 00:20:11.559
are being indicted for adultery, it's spiritual adultery.

00:20:12.519 --> 00:20:13.359
What are they saying?

00:20:13.359 --> 00:20:16.599
Well, you've left God to go serve idols.

00:20:16.599 --> 00:20:18.299
Love not the world,

00:20:18.299 --> 00:20:20.839
neither the things that are in the world, right?

00:20:20.839 --> 00:20:22.339
1 John chapter two.

00:20:22.339 --> 00:20:24.679
And so we find here that yes,

00:20:24.679 --> 00:20:27.239
carnality will stunt spiritual growth,

00:20:27.239 --> 00:20:30.039
but here, these that are being addressed

00:20:30.239 --> 00:20:31.339
in Hebrews chapter five,

00:20:31.339 --> 00:20:33.699
what is it that leads to a lack of spiritual growth

00:20:33.699 --> 00:20:34.739
in their lives?

00:20:34.739 --> 00:20:37.599
Well, it's the fact that they're dull of hearing.

00:20:37.599 --> 00:20:38.899
They're dull of hearing.

00:20:38.899 --> 00:20:42.059
You know, it's interesting in Revelation two and three,

00:20:42.059 --> 00:20:43.939
in those two chapters,

00:20:43.939 --> 00:20:47.979
God is addressing the seven churches in Asia.

00:20:47.979 --> 00:20:51.099
And as he's addressing those seven churches in Asia,

00:20:51.099 --> 00:20:54.379
seven times in those two chapters,

00:20:54.379 --> 00:20:55.219
the Bible says,

00:20:55.219 --> 00:20:58.879
he that hath an ear,

00:20:58.879 --> 00:21:00.959
let him hear.

00:21:01.999 --> 00:21:03.659
Seven times.

00:21:03.659 --> 00:21:06.279
As he's writing to those seven churches in Asia

00:21:06.279 --> 00:21:08.799
in Revelation two and three,

00:21:08.799 --> 00:21:10.879
I think God intends for his people

00:21:10.879 --> 00:21:12.679
to not be dull of hearing,

00:21:12.679 --> 00:21:14.799
but to be ready to hear,

00:21:14.799 --> 00:21:16.159
ready to receive,

00:21:16.159 --> 00:21:21.059
ready and eager to find out what does God have for me?

00:21:21.059 --> 00:21:23.839
How is God going to speak to me today

00:21:24.579 --> 00:21:26.099
not only when I go to church,

00:21:26.099 --> 00:21:27.579
but certainly when I go to church,

00:21:27.579 --> 00:21:31.179
having that anticipation of what does God have for me?

00:21:31.179 --> 00:21:34.019
What does God have for me today?

00:21:34.019 --> 00:21:35.859
Because God is a personal God.

00:21:35.859 --> 00:21:38.259
But then I think about every day opening our Bibles

00:21:38.259 --> 00:21:40.739
and having our special quiet time with God.

00:21:40.739 --> 00:21:42.459
What does God have for me?

00:21:43.739 --> 00:21:45.979
Let me remind you of what the Old Testament says.

00:21:45.979 --> 00:21:48.179
Turn to the book of Amos, if you will.

00:21:48.179 --> 00:21:50.539
Hosea, Joel, Amos,

00:21:50.539 --> 00:21:54.279
and go over, if you will, to the book of Amos,

00:21:54.279 --> 00:21:55.779
chapter number eight.

00:21:57.319 --> 00:22:00.879
Hosea, so Daniel, Hosea, Joel, Amos.

00:22:02.239 --> 00:22:04.039
I try to help you more than some preachers

00:22:04.039 --> 00:22:06.999
that I've heard say it's between Genesis and Revelation,

00:22:06.999 --> 00:22:08.919
and that's always very helpful, isn't it,

00:22:08.919 --> 00:22:10.000
when somebody says that?

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.439
But the book of Amos,

00:22:11.439 --> 00:22:12.679
it's always fun when somebody tells you

00:22:12.679 --> 00:22:15.679
to go to the minor prophets, you know?

00:22:15.679 --> 00:22:18.000
Amos, chapter number eight.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.439
And let me read this verse of Scripture for you

00:22:21.139 --> 00:22:23.179
in Amos, chapter eight, in verse number 11.

00:22:23.179 --> 00:22:24.019
The Bible says,

00:22:24.019 --> 00:22:26.179
Behold, the day has come, saith the Lord God,

00:22:26.179 --> 00:22:27.719
that I will send a famine in the land,

00:22:27.719 --> 00:22:30.779
not a famine of bread, nor a thirst of water,

00:22:30.779 --> 00:22:34.879
but of hearing the words of the Lord.

00:22:36.939 --> 00:22:41.619
A famine of hearing the words of the Lord.

00:22:41.619 --> 00:22:43.619
You know what 2 Timothy tells us?

00:22:43.619 --> 00:22:46.059
2 Timothy tells us that we're to preach the word,

00:22:46.059 --> 00:22:47.539
be instant in season, out of season,

00:22:47.539 --> 00:22:50.339
reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine

00:22:51.199 --> 00:22:52.079
for the time will come when men

00:22:52.079 --> 00:22:54.799
will not endure sound doctrine.

00:22:54.799 --> 00:22:57.679
The Bible continues there in 2 Timothy, chapter number four,

00:22:57.679 --> 00:22:59.679
and it says this,

00:22:59.679 --> 00:23:02.079
But after their own lusts shall they heap themselves

00:23:02.079 --> 00:23:05.699
teachers having itching ears.

00:23:05.699 --> 00:23:08.359
Tell me something that makes me feel good.

00:23:08.359 --> 00:23:10.679
Make me a, you know, how to be a better you,

00:23:10.679 --> 00:23:14.079
kind of a motivational speaker and that sort of thing.

00:23:14.079 --> 00:23:19.079
And the reality is that we are to preach the word of God,

00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:22.739
and we understand this evening that it's an indictment

00:23:22.739 --> 00:23:24.659
against these believers that are being addressed

00:23:24.659 --> 00:23:26.019
in Hebrews chapter five,

00:23:26.019 --> 00:23:29.539
that their lack of spiritual growth can be directly traced

00:23:29.539 --> 00:23:32.959
to the fact that they were dull of hearing.

00:23:32.959 --> 00:23:36.699
Completely opposite of what we read of the Thessalonians

00:23:36.699 --> 00:23:38.059
in 1 Thessalonians chapter two,

00:23:38.059 --> 00:23:39.319
they were not dull of hearing.

00:23:39.319 --> 00:23:42.259
I mean, they were ready to receive the word of God

00:23:42.259 --> 00:23:46.059
because they understood that it was God's word.

00:23:46.059 --> 00:23:49.019
We see their condition noted in Hebrews chapter five,

00:23:49.839 --> 00:23:50.679
number two, if you're taking notes,

00:23:50.679 --> 00:23:52.599
the call to grow spiritually.

00:23:52.599 --> 00:23:56.079
I believe this evening that spiritual growth is expected.

00:23:56.079 --> 00:23:58.279
I said this a moment ago by way of invitation,

00:23:58.279 --> 00:24:00.359
I believe, introduction, excuse me.

00:24:00.359 --> 00:24:04.199
I believe that God expects that his people grow.

00:24:04.199 --> 00:24:07.359
And by the way, I don't think that's an invalid expectation.

00:24:07.359 --> 00:24:09.079
I think it's an appropriate expectation

00:24:09.079 --> 00:24:11.359
that God would expect of his people

00:24:11.359 --> 00:24:12.659
that we would grow spiritually.

00:24:12.659 --> 00:24:15.079
Let me say this, not only is an expectation

00:24:15.079 --> 00:24:17.199
that God has that his people would grow spiritually,

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:20.220
but God has given us everything

00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:22.899
that we need to be able to grow spiritually.

00:24:22.899 --> 00:24:23.859
He's given us all things

00:24:23.859 --> 00:24:25.739
that pertain unto life and godliness.

00:24:25.739 --> 00:24:27.220
Listen, if you plant a plant,

00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:31.820
if you plant something, you expect it to grow, right?

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:33.059
You expect it to grow.

00:24:33.059 --> 00:24:34.579
You expect it to produce some fruit.

00:24:34.579 --> 00:24:37.220
You water it, you cultivate it, you do whatever,

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:39.059
you put some miracle grow on it, whatever you do,

00:24:39.059 --> 00:24:41.139
and you expect there to be growth.

00:24:41.139 --> 00:24:43.100
And if there's no growth, what do you do?

00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:44.539
You say, what's going on here?

00:24:44.539 --> 00:24:45.859
And it's disappointing.

00:24:45.859 --> 00:24:48.959
I mean, John 15, if you don't bear fruit,

00:24:48.959 --> 00:24:50.559
they're gonna cut the tree down.

00:24:51.759 --> 00:24:52.839
That's what it says.

00:24:53.919 --> 00:24:56.359
Last year, our garden, we had tomato plants

00:24:56.359 --> 00:24:58.959
that were taller than Joseph last year.

00:24:58.959 --> 00:25:00.399
I'm telling you, we had tomato plants

00:25:00.399 --> 00:25:01.380
that were taller than Joseph.

00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:02.519
I mean, that's tall, right?

00:25:02.519 --> 00:25:05.759
I mean, and we had tomatoes coming out of our ears.

00:25:05.759 --> 00:25:07.019
We didn't know what to do with all these tomatoes.

00:25:07.019 --> 00:25:08.600
Holly was canning them, we're giving them away,

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:09.440
giving them away.

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:11.919
We haven't gotten one tomato this year.

00:25:11.919 --> 00:25:13.079
I look at our garden, I say,

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:15.979
what in the world is going on?

00:25:15.979 --> 00:25:17.579
You know what I'm ready to do with that garden?

00:25:17.579 --> 00:25:20.059
I'm ready to go till it all up and just say, forget it,

00:25:20.059 --> 00:25:23.539
it's been a bad year, and just start over next year.

00:25:23.539 --> 00:25:25.759
It's terrible, not producing anything.

00:25:27.179 --> 00:25:29.579
God expects for his people to grow spiritually.

00:25:30.619 --> 00:25:33.220
We find that there's a call in God's word

00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:35.019
for us to grow spiritually.

00:25:35.019 --> 00:25:37.039
Not only is spiritual growth expected,

00:25:37.039 --> 00:25:38.220
but I believe this evening

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:40.539
that spiritual growth can be measured.

00:25:40.539 --> 00:25:42.419
I believe it can be measured.

00:25:42.419 --> 00:25:44.160
I believe that we can look at our lives

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:46.959
if we do an honest evaluation

00:25:46.959 --> 00:25:48.320
and we're humble before the Lord

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:49.320
and we can determine

00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:51.919
whether we're growing spiritually or not.

00:25:51.919 --> 00:25:55.239
We can determine in our own lives

00:25:55.239 --> 00:25:59.039
how well we're doing in this area of spiritual growth.

00:25:59.039 --> 00:26:02.199
Here in Hebrews chapter five, we find again,

00:26:02.199 --> 00:26:06.000
as this appeal is given and he's saying their condition,

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.839
but then notice in verse 14, he says,

00:26:08.859 --> 00:26:12.579
but strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age,

00:26:12.579 --> 00:26:14.380
even those who by reason of use

00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:19.380
have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.

00:26:19.619 --> 00:26:23.299
As we look at this call to grow spiritually,

00:26:23.299 --> 00:26:26.820
we find that Paul makes this contrast, if you will,

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:29.380
by the babes and the spiritually mature,

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:30.660
by those who need milk

00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:32.940
versus those that have the meat of the word,

00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:36.459
those that are needing to learn the first principles

00:26:36.459 --> 00:26:37.539
of the oracles of God

00:26:37.559 --> 00:26:40.600
versus those that have their senses exercised

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:42.720
to discern both good and evil.

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:44.359
You know, I think we got a huge problem

00:26:44.359 --> 00:26:46.160
in American churches today,

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:48.160
really in churches all across the world today.

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:49.799
You know what I think a huge problem is

00:26:49.799 --> 00:26:52.519
is that we have spiritually anemic people.

00:26:53.679 --> 00:26:55.799
We have people that have not grown spiritually.

00:26:55.799 --> 00:26:58.440
They cannot discern between good and evil.

00:26:58.440 --> 00:26:59.259
I'm telling you the truth.

00:26:59.259 --> 00:27:01.600
You look at what's going on in our world today.

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:02.799
You look at all this nonsense

00:27:02.799 --> 00:27:04.239
that's going on in our world today,

00:27:04.239 --> 00:27:07.000
the mockery of God and of Christianity

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.259
and so on and so forth.

00:27:08.259 --> 00:27:10.100
Listen, there's a lot of people today

00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:13.699
that are unfortunately weak Christians.

00:27:14.619 --> 00:27:16.899
They haven't grown spiritually.

00:27:16.899 --> 00:27:18.699
They haven't grown spiritually.

00:27:18.699 --> 00:27:21.419
They can't discern between good and evil.

00:27:21.419 --> 00:27:23.179
We have, listen, we have people,

00:27:23.179 --> 00:27:25.419
I read the statistics to you a few weeks ago

00:27:25.419 --> 00:27:27.779
about those that have a biblical worldview,

00:27:27.779 --> 00:27:30.299
and that's frightening when you look at the statistics,

00:27:30.299 --> 00:27:32.459
but I'm telling you, listen, this evening,

00:27:32.459 --> 00:27:34.699
when you start thinking about some of the things,

00:27:34.699 --> 00:27:38.119
some of the main talking points in our culture today,

00:27:38.119 --> 00:27:40.079
we start talking about gender.

00:27:40.079 --> 00:27:44.019
Listen, how can people that say that they're Christians,

00:27:45.039 --> 00:27:47.380
are you with me, think that there's more

00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:49.459
than male and female?

00:27:49.459 --> 00:27:52.039
Because God is pretty clear in his word, amen?

00:27:52.039 --> 00:27:54.079
He created male and he created female,

00:27:54.079 --> 00:27:57.199
period, end of story, amen?

00:27:57.199 --> 00:27:59.919
You say, oh, you're so narrow-minded.

00:27:59.919 --> 00:28:01.759
No, no, no, we're just biblical.

00:28:02.699 --> 00:28:04.899
We're just biblical.

00:28:06.539 --> 00:28:08.299
Abortion, well, you know, everyone,

00:28:08.299 --> 00:28:11.119
listen, it's about life.

00:28:12.259 --> 00:28:15.619
It's about life, amen?

00:28:15.619 --> 00:28:17.859
And we can't discern between good and evil

00:28:17.859 --> 00:28:20.179
because we're not growing spiritually.

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:24.059
And we got a lot of weak Christians,

00:28:24.059 --> 00:28:27.259
not only in America, but across the globe,

00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:30.459
and it's sad.

00:28:30.479 --> 00:28:32.799
There's a call, 2 Timothy 2 and verse 15,

00:28:32.799 --> 00:28:35.559
study to show thyself approved unto God,

00:28:35.559 --> 00:28:37.279
a workman that needeth not to be ashamed,

00:28:37.279 --> 00:28:40.640
rightly dividing the word of truth.

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:42.279
You know, if you're going to rightly divide

00:28:42.279 --> 00:28:44.119
the word of truth, you have to study

00:28:44.119 --> 00:28:46.320
and you have to be growing spiritually.

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:49.479
You know there are some things in the Bible that are hard?

00:28:49.479 --> 00:28:52.159
Listen, I was reading this morning

00:28:52.159 --> 00:28:54.599
in the book of Zechariah,

00:28:54.599 --> 00:28:56.239
and I was reading this morning in the book of Zechariah,

00:28:56.239 --> 00:28:57.279
you know, it's amazing to me,

00:28:57.279 --> 00:28:58.719
I was being encouraged, Brother Mark,

00:28:58.739 --> 00:29:00.940
because every time God was showing Zechariah something,

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:03.179
Zechariah said, what does that mean?

00:29:03.179 --> 00:29:04.299
What does that mean?

00:29:04.299 --> 00:29:05.140
What does that mean?

00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:07.700
And I'm like, man, I can relate with Zechariah, amen?

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:09.260
Because there's some times you're saying, what?

00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:12.239
And this is, now some things are the milk,

00:29:12.239 --> 00:29:14.440
but some of them are the meat.

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:18.059
Well, let me tell you what our brother Peter said.

00:29:18.059 --> 00:29:22.739
As Peter is writing in 2 Peter chapter number three,

00:29:22.739 --> 00:29:26.279
he says this, I'll give you a moment to turn there.

00:29:29.719 --> 00:29:33.539
In 2 Peter chapter three, in verse number 14,

00:29:33.539 --> 00:29:34.500
wherefore, beloved,

00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:36.059
seeing that you look for such things,

00:29:36.059 --> 00:29:39.119
be diligent that you may be found of him in peace

00:29:39.119 --> 00:29:40.539
without spot and blameless,

00:29:40.539 --> 00:29:43.539
and account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation

00:29:43.539 --> 00:29:45.599
even as our beloved brother Paul,

00:29:45.599 --> 00:29:47.460
also according to the wisdom given unto him

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:48.779
hath written unto you,

00:29:48.779 --> 00:29:51.140
as also in all his epistles speaking in them

00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:54.539
of these things, in which are some things,

00:29:54.539 --> 00:29:56.020
what does it say?

00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:59.020
Hard to be understood.

00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:00.839
Is that what your Bible says?

00:30:00.839 --> 00:30:01.679
That's what.

00:30:01.679 --> 00:30:03.479
My Bible says.

00:30:03.479 --> 00:30:04.759
So what does that mean?

00:30:04.759 --> 00:30:06.399
Well, that means we gotta study.

00:30:07.559 --> 00:30:10.359
Have you ever taken a class that challenged you?

00:30:10.359 --> 00:30:12.519
Listen, as an adult, I don't like taking classes

00:30:12.519 --> 00:30:13.719
that challenge me.

00:30:13.719 --> 00:30:15.039
I'll be honest with you.

00:30:15.039 --> 00:30:17.479
I got, as a senior in high school,

00:30:17.479 --> 00:30:21.059
listen, I already had enough to graduate.

00:30:22.079 --> 00:30:24.199
And I went to a class, calculus.

00:30:24.199 --> 00:30:25.199
How many of you took calculus?

00:30:25.199 --> 00:30:28.479
Bless the Lord, oh, I make you pray.

00:30:28.479 --> 00:30:30.839
I'm telling you, I took calculus for one day.

00:30:31.999 --> 00:30:33.479
I went to class that one day.

00:30:33.479 --> 00:30:34.639
They gave us an assignment.

00:30:34.639 --> 00:30:35.479
I went home.

00:30:35.479 --> 00:30:38.279
Now, I aced all of the other math classes

00:30:38.279 --> 00:30:39.199
going up to calculus.

00:30:39.199 --> 00:30:41.159
I mean, it was easy.

00:30:41.159 --> 00:30:43.759
But you ever reach like a, I maxed out,

00:30:43.759 --> 00:30:45.239
like there's nothing left.

00:30:45.239 --> 00:30:47.319
That's what I felt like with calculus.

00:30:47.319 --> 00:30:49.839
And I went to that class, and I took that assignment,

00:30:49.839 --> 00:30:53.359
and I went home, and I worked on it for hours.

00:30:53.359 --> 00:30:54.719
And I got back to class the next day,

00:30:54.719 --> 00:30:55.879
and the teacher stood up and said,

00:30:55.879 --> 00:30:57.559
now that should have taken you about 15 minutes,

00:30:57.559 --> 00:31:00.079
a good little refresher, and here are the answers.

00:31:00.079 --> 00:31:02.479
I had three of the five wrong, and it took me hours,

00:31:02.479 --> 00:31:04.559
and I raised my hand, and the teacher said, what's wrong?

00:31:04.559 --> 00:31:06.759
I said, I need a different class.

00:31:06.759 --> 00:31:08.239
I don't need this class.

00:31:08.239 --> 00:31:11.079
I don't wanna be challenged by this.

00:31:11.079 --> 00:31:12.119
And he said, that's terrible.

00:31:12.119 --> 00:31:13.679
I'm just being honest with you.

00:31:15.139 --> 00:31:18.099
Spiritually speaking, I wanna be challenged.

00:31:19.079 --> 00:31:21.359
Sometimes there are things that are hard to be understood.

00:31:21.359 --> 00:31:23.559
I had a preacher say this the other day,

00:31:23.559 --> 00:31:25.359
and it absolutely, I don't know if you remember hearing him,

00:31:25.359 --> 00:31:27.799
this guy, pastors in Texas,

00:31:27.799 --> 00:31:30.119
been a pastor for 40 years, he made this statement,

00:31:30.119 --> 00:31:33.839
and he said, I struggled with something in God's Word

00:31:33.839 --> 00:31:37.319
for a decade and a half.

00:31:37.319 --> 00:31:38.159
How long is that?

00:31:38.159 --> 00:31:41.159
That's 15 years.

00:31:41.159 --> 00:31:45.039
He said, I struggled over this thing for 15 years

00:31:45.039 --> 00:31:47.519
that I couldn't fully understand.

00:31:48.359 --> 00:31:51.239
And then after 15 years, God opened my eyes

00:31:51.239 --> 00:31:52.939
and helped me understand it.

00:31:52.939 --> 00:31:54.879
That's amazing to me.

00:31:54.879 --> 00:31:56.759
Listen, Peter says,

00:31:56.759 --> 00:31:58.599
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

00:31:58.599 --> 00:32:00.359
that Paul wrote some things,

00:32:00.359 --> 00:32:01.599
and in the epistles that he wrote,

00:32:01.599 --> 00:32:05.719
some of those things are hard to be understood.

00:32:05.719 --> 00:32:06.839
It doesn't mean we give up.

00:32:06.839 --> 00:32:08.479
It means we keep digging in.

00:32:09.439 --> 00:32:11.319
We wanna grow spiritually.

00:32:12.239 --> 00:32:15.079
I mentioned earlier, 1 Peter 2, in verse number two,

00:32:15.079 --> 00:32:16.879
the Bible says, as newborn babes desire

00:32:16.879 --> 00:32:19.239
the sincere milk of the Lord, that you may grow thereby.

00:32:19.239 --> 00:32:21.599
Here in 2 Peter 3, I have you here already,

00:32:21.599 --> 00:32:25.319
so notice just a few verses down in verse 18.

00:32:25.319 --> 00:32:27.479
Let me just continue reading, starting in verse 16,

00:32:27.479 --> 00:32:28.599
and I'll read through the end.

00:32:28.599 --> 00:32:30.479
It says, as also in all his epistles,

00:32:30.479 --> 00:32:32.159
speaking in them of these things,

00:32:32.159 --> 00:32:33.939
in which are some things hard to be understood,

00:32:33.939 --> 00:32:37.399
which they that are unlearned and unstable rest,

00:32:37.399 --> 00:32:39.139
as they do also the other scriptures

00:32:39.139 --> 00:32:40.279
under their own destruction.

00:32:40.279 --> 00:32:43.759
Ye, therefore, beloved, seeing you know these things before,

00:32:43.759 --> 00:32:45.279
notice what he says in verse 17,

00:32:45.279 --> 00:32:47.500
beware lest ye also being led away

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:49.519
with the error of the wicked fall

00:32:49.519 --> 00:32:50.919
from your own steadfastness,

00:32:50.919 --> 00:32:53.959
but grow in grace and in the knowledge

00:32:53.959 --> 00:32:55.919
of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ,

00:32:55.919 --> 00:33:00.359
to him be glory both now and forever, amen.

00:33:00.359 --> 00:33:05.359
You know what the remedy is for spiritual false teaching

00:33:05.439 --> 00:33:06.839
and spiritual wickedness?

00:33:06.839 --> 00:33:09.439
The antidote, the remedy for false teaching

00:33:09.439 --> 00:33:11.699
is growth spiritually.

00:33:11.699 --> 00:33:15.119
Listen, if you're grounded in God's word,

00:33:15.119 --> 00:33:16.439
you're not gonna be tossed to and fro

00:33:16.439 --> 00:33:18.399
with every wind of doctrine,

00:33:18.399 --> 00:33:20.199
because you're grounded in God's word.

00:33:20.199 --> 00:33:22.279
Something comes up and somebody says something,

00:33:22.279 --> 00:33:24.459
and you're like, eh, that doesn't fit

00:33:24.459 --> 00:33:27.619
with what the Bible says, amen.

00:33:28.959 --> 00:33:31.079
Hebrews six and verse number one,

00:33:31.079 --> 00:33:32.759
we read in Hebrews five, you don't need to turn there,

00:33:32.759 --> 00:33:34.079
but in verse 11 through 14,

00:33:34.079 --> 00:33:35.479
in verse number one of chapter six,

00:33:35.479 --> 00:33:39.759
the Bible says this, let us go on unto perfection.

00:33:41.099 --> 00:33:43.379
I believe that I could rightly say,

00:33:43.379 --> 00:33:46.399
let us go on to spiritual maturity,

00:33:46.399 --> 00:33:48.199
and that spiritual growth.

00:33:49.159 --> 00:33:52.199
See, this evening, we talk about this subject

00:33:53.119 --> 00:33:55.799
of we ought to grow spiritually.

00:33:55.799 --> 00:33:59.039
Let me leave you with two thoughts, and we'll be done.

00:33:59.039 --> 00:34:03.759
Number one, you should desire to grow spiritually.

00:34:03.759 --> 00:34:06.619
If you're saved, you should desire to grow.

00:34:07.639 --> 00:34:09.919
I hope that we never get to a place

00:34:09.919 --> 00:34:12.359
where we're just comfortable with where we are.

00:34:12.359 --> 00:34:13.979
So you know what, I've gone as far as I've gone.

00:34:13.979 --> 00:34:16.839
That's what I did with calculus years ago.

00:34:16.839 --> 00:34:18.720
I said I'm good, I've reached, no, no, no.

00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:22.039
I hope spiritually we never come to that place

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:24.839
that we desire to continue to grow,

00:34:24.839 --> 00:34:26.079
to get closer and closer.

00:34:26.079 --> 00:34:28.679
You know what's amazing, that Moses,

00:34:28.679 --> 00:34:31.239
after he saw God do so many amazing things,

00:34:31.239 --> 00:34:34.720
says that I might know him, that I might know thee.

00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:37.639
Paul, after he experienced so many wonderful things

00:34:37.639 --> 00:34:40.279
in Philippians three, that I might know him.

00:34:40.279 --> 00:34:42.959
Wow, these are two, one Old Testament,

00:34:42.959 --> 00:34:44.079
one New Testament that we look at

00:34:44.079 --> 00:34:45.679
as being great heroes of the faith,

00:34:45.679 --> 00:34:47.119
but they're saying after,

00:34:47.119 --> 00:34:48.720
this is not in the beginning of their life,

00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:50.959
in their beginning of their spiritual journey.

00:34:50.959 --> 00:34:52.679
This is after they'd walked with God

00:34:52.679 --> 00:34:56.600
and seen God do amazing things, they wanna know God.

00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:57.679
They wanna know God.

00:34:58.559 --> 00:34:59.880
You have to desire it.

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:01.119
And then I would say this, number two,

00:35:01.119 --> 00:35:03.880
develop a plan to grow spiritually.

00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:04.799
Can I say it this way?

00:35:04.799 --> 00:35:07.559
You're not gonna grow spiritually on accident.

00:35:07.559 --> 00:35:09.759
You're not gonna grow spiritually on accident.

00:35:12.359 --> 00:35:16.320
If we use the analogy as we used a few minutes ago

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:21.119
of working out and physical exercise,

00:35:21.119 --> 00:35:23.639
by the way, profit is little, there is some profit,

00:35:23.639 --> 00:35:25.679
but it's little, according to 1 Timothy.

00:35:28.079 --> 00:35:30.679
But there's a plan that's developed

00:35:30.679 --> 00:35:34.279
if there's a desire to grow, amen?

00:35:35.119 --> 00:35:36.959
I'm not watching the Olympics

00:35:36.959 --> 00:35:39.320
and you make the decision for yourself,

00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:43.119
but those that are competing in the Olympics right now,

00:35:43.119 --> 00:35:46.000
they had a desire, they had a goal.

00:35:46.679 --> 00:35:47.519
What was their goal?

00:35:47.519 --> 00:35:48.679
They wanna win a medal.

00:35:48.679 --> 00:35:49.679
Am I right?

00:35:49.679 --> 00:35:51.119
They wanna win a medal.

00:35:51.119 --> 00:35:53.679
If you know what they did, they developed a plan

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.039
and they worked really hard.

00:35:57.039 --> 00:35:58.600
I mean, they worked really hard

00:35:59.679 --> 00:36:03.639
to be able to even qualify to represent their country

00:36:03.639 --> 00:36:04.880
on that stage.

00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:08.119
They worked exceedingly hard.

00:36:09.039 --> 00:36:13.000
I mean, they sacrificed so that they could grow

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:16.399
in their discipline in order to compete

00:36:16.399 --> 00:36:17.720
so that they might win.

00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:19.160
Am I right?

00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:24.039
Paul says this, that I may win Christ.

00:36:24.039 --> 00:36:25.639
I may win Christ.

00:36:25.639 --> 00:36:27.519
See, we gotta have a desire to grow spiritually.

00:36:27.519 --> 00:36:29.519
It's not gonna happen on accident.

00:36:29.519 --> 00:36:31.839
We have the desire, we have to develop a plan.

00:36:31.839 --> 00:36:33.199
How can I grow spiritually?

00:36:33.199 --> 00:36:34.839
It's not gonna happen on accident.

00:36:34.839 --> 00:36:36.839
It's an everyday commitment

00:36:36.839 --> 00:36:37.959
that we're gonna grow spiritually.

00:36:37.959 --> 00:36:39.919
I wanna get a little closer to God today

00:36:39.919 --> 00:36:41.720
than I was yesterday.

00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:43.479
I wanna understand a little bit more about God today

00:36:43.479 --> 00:36:44.639
than I did yesterday

00:36:45.919 --> 00:36:47.359
because we wanna grow spiritually.

00:36:47.359 --> 00:36:48.880
We ought to grow spiritually.

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:49.720
Let's pray.

00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:50.799
Father, we love you.

00:36:50.799 --> 00:36:51.959
We thank you for loving us.

00:36:51.959 --> 00:36:54.039
Thank you for your word.

00:36:54.039 --> 00:36:56.799
I pray that you'd help us this evening,

00:36:56.799 --> 00:36:59.199
Lord, to grow spiritually.

00:36:59.199 --> 00:37:02.359
Help us not to get comfortable with where we are

00:37:02.359 --> 00:37:04.479
in our Christian walk.

00:37:04.479 --> 00:37:07.440
Lord, help us to have the desire.

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:09.799
Help us to develop a plan.

00:37:09.799 --> 00:37:12.399
I pray that you'd move and work,

00:37:12.399 --> 00:37:15.039
Lord, to help us not to soon forget

00:37:15.039 --> 00:37:17.039
what we've heard this evening.

00:37:17.039 --> 00:37:18.000
We'll thank you for it.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.079
In Christ's name we pray, amen.

00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:23.039
Does anyone need a prayer bulletin this evening?

00:37:23.039 --> 00:37:24.479
You didn't get one on your way?
