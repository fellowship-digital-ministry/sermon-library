1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,239
evening, Genesis chapter number 30, and this is part two of the message that I started

2
00:00:05,239 --> 00:00:10,920
last week that I entitled, The Sons of Jacob, and of course, as we began studying last week,

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:16,340
we started to go through, starting in chapter 29 and verse number 31, and going down and

4
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:22,159
looking at the sons of Jacob and the way in which God blessed, and of course, his recognition

5
00:00:22,159 --> 00:00:27,479
of understanding that life is a gift from God, and we're thankful that God is the giver

6
00:00:27,479 --> 00:00:28,479
of life.

7
00:00:28,479 --> 00:00:34,599
And as we studied through the first eight of the sons of Jacob last week and looked

8
00:00:34,599 --> 00:00:42,520
at what was taking place, we understand that there was a real competition that was going

9
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:49,680
on between Leah and Rachel, and as we highlighted through the names of the sons of Jacob and

10
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:56,119
the way in which the mothers would name their children, that you would see that competition

11
00:00:56,119 --> 00:01:00,880
that was taking place, and we mentioned as we went through and studied the names of

12
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:09,919
these sons and what their names mean and the recognition at times by the mother with the

13
00:01:09,919 --> 00:01:17,559
name of God and recognizing God's favor and God's blessing, and then the depth of carnality

14
00:01:17,559 --> 00:01:24,480
and the competition and how they began to compete one with another, and as we looked

15
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:31,120
at these first eight sons, we noticed and left on a high note with son number four in

16
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:39,559
verse number 35 of Genesis 29, that this son, his name was Judah, and here's what the Bible

17
00:01:39,559 --> 00:01:46,440
tells us, that here's what Leah said in verse number 35 of Genesis 29, "'Now will I praise

18
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,519
the Lord.'

19
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:52,680
Therefore she called his name Judah and left bearing.'"

20
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,839
As we looked at that particular juncture of our text of Scripture and we mentioned

21
00:01:57,839 --> 00:02:02,400
how that she says, "'Now will I praise the Lord.'"

22
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:07,919
Once again, she's acknowledging God as being Jehovah God.

23
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:13,679
That reference was completely dismissed when she named Levi in verse number 34.

24
00:02:13,679 --> 00:02:19,880
There's no reference to God whatsoever, and here in verse 35 of Genesis 29, she's saying

25
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:26,039
that she's going to praise the Lord Jehovah, and she called his name Judah, which literally

26
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:27,360
means praise.

27
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,880
I believe that her joy and praise, as I mentioned last week, would be in the Lord, that no longer

28
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:39,279
would she be focused upon this conflict with Rachel, and what a joy and what a blessing.

29
00:02:39,279 --> 00:02:46,679
But we find that Rachel begins to implement some really worldly, carnal behavior because

30
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,520
she sees that she has no children.

31
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:55,080
And seeing that she has no children, we find that she goes through these extents of being

32
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:01,520
able to have children legally and handmade, and we find that this competition and this

33
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:07,360
depth of carnality had a great impact upon Leah.

34
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,559
And I'm kind of reviewing these things very quickly because it's interesting when we left

35
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:19,320
off with Leah at son number 8 in verse number 13 of Genesis 30, I want you to notice what

36
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:27,919
Leah says, and the contrast between son number 4, Judah, and son number 8, Asher.

37
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:33,800
In verse number 13 of Genesis 30, it says, and Leah said, happy am I, for the daughters

38
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:38,440
will call me blessed, and she called his name Asher.

39
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:44,320
We mentioned that the name Judah means praise, and she says, now will I praise the Lord,

40
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:50,000
acknowledging Jehovah, and here after the carnality that Rachel employs, and after

41
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,800
all that takes place with this fleshly living, and Leah operating in like fashion, now she

42
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,820
can only name her son happy.

43
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:08,539
She says, happy am I, and notice what it is that would bring her a level of happiness.

44
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:13,740
She says, for the daughters will call me blessed.

45
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:18,420
You know, it's a terrible thing when we're more concerned about what people think about

46
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:25,480
us than what God knows about us, and we find that in this verse of Scripture, these two

47
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:31,480
verses of Scripture in verse 35 of chapter 29 and verse 13 of chapter 30, we see the

48
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,359
height and the depth in the life of Leah.

49
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:40,079
And as I mentioned last week, and I believe that it's important that we understand tonight

50
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:47,799
that we look at the historical context of this portion of Scripture, and we understand

51
00:04:47,799 --> 00:04:53,640
that God is giving us the record of the sons of Jacob, but as we trace through and we see

52
00:04:53,760 --> 00:05:00,320
what's taking place, we can understand as well that we can operate spiritually, or we

53
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:07,079
can operate carnally, and the reality is that there are times in which we can allow other

54
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:14,480
people to influence our behavior.

55
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,640
Leah was at a high point in verse number 35.

56
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:33,399
In Rachel, she employed fleshly, carnal methodology, and Leah responded in like fashion.

57
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:39,519
She goes from that pinnacle of spirituality, if you will, in verse 35, to a place of just

58
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:43,440
slinging mud and competing with her sister.

59
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,440
And that's tragic.

60
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,320
As we continue through the text of Scripture, we come to verse number 18 and we see son

61
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:58,559
number 9, and notice the Bible says in verse 17 of Genesis 30, it says,

62
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:02,679
And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived and bare Jacob the fifth son.

63
00:06:02,679 --> 00:06:07,760
And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given my maiden to my husband,

64
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:11,359
and she called his name Issachar.

65
00:06:11,359 --> 00:06:17,119
We find that here in verse number 18, we see son number 9, and his name Issachar means

66
00:06:17,119 --> 00:06:19,519
there is recompense or there is reward.

67
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:26,239
I will say this for sake of the audience this evening, verses 14 through 17 I'm not going

68
00:06:26,239 --> 00:06:31,880
to read publicly this evening, but I want you to understand that the circumstances surrounding

69
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:37,920
the birth of Issachar are unfortunate to say the least.

70
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:42,760
And when you see what happens between Leah and Rachel in those verses of Scripture, and

71
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:49,920
you see how Reuben the firstborn was used and how Jacob comes back and all of the carnality,

72
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,040
it's really a sad situation.

73
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:56,959
And here as she names him Issachar, there is recompense or there is reward.

74
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:03,720
We see once again this battle, this conflict between sisters.

75
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,320
And we find that in verse number 18 when she calls his name Issachar, she also says

76
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:15,640
this, notice what she says, God hath given me my hire.

77
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:22,160
She's acknowledged God, but she's no longer acknowledging God as being Jehovah.

78
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,359
She's acknowledging God as being Elohim or Lord.

79
00:07:25,359 --> 00:07:30,559
And we've mentioned this before, we've seen this behavior in the life of Leah in previous

80
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:36,679
text of Scripture, in the life of Rachel, and we find here that as she has this ninth

81
00:07:36,679 --> 00:07:42,720
son, that these circumstances that are just wild beyond our imagination, the depth of

82
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,720
carnality.

83
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:50,440
But as we see historically in the context of what's happening, we must understand that

84
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:58,000
we too can sink to some pretty low levels of carnality.

85
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:05,480
The Bible tells us in 1 Corinthians 10, let him that thinketh he standeth, take heed lest

86
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,940
he fall.

87
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:12,040
You know, it's absolutely imperative that you and I walk in the Spirit so that we do

88
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,279
not fulfill the lust of the flesh.

89
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:22,279
After salvation, the Holy Spirit of God indwelled us, isn't that wonderful?

90
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:24,320
And He enables us.

91
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:27,359
We still have a flesh.

92
00:08:27,359 --> 00:08:31,000
And our flesh still has fleshly desires.

93
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,840
And we can still reach these depths of carnality.

94
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:39,640
And we see that here with son number nine, continue to move forward with me in verse

95
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,640
number 19.

96
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,520
It says that Leah conceived again and bear Jacob the sixth son.

97
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:48,440
And it says that Leah said, God hath endued me with a good dowry.

98
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,880
Now will my husband dwell with me because I have born him six sons.

99
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,239
And she called his name Zebulun.

100
00:08:56,239 --> 00:08:58,239
The name Zebulun means dwelling.

101
00:08:58,239 --> 00:09:02,239
And notice what she says, God hath endued me with good dowry.

102
00:09:02,239 --> 00:09:05,099
She then makes this statement in verse number 20.

103
00:09:05,099 --> 00:09:08,880
She says, now will my husband dwell with me.

104
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,820
Isn't that what she's been longing for all along?

105
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:16,640
She acknowledges in the beginning of our text in chapter number 29, how that when she had

106
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,960
Reuben that God, the Lord Jehovah, hath looked upon my affliction.

107
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,659
Now, therefore, my husband will love me.

108
00:09:23,659 --> 00:09:28,960
And she goes through that process and she has that, that confidence when Levi is born

109
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,559
in verse number 34.

110
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:33,880
Now this time, will my husband be joined unto me?

111
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,880
Why?

112
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,280
Because I have born him three sons.

113
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:41,719
And we find that she was longing for that relationship with Jacob and that that's what

114
00:09:41,719 --> 00:09:42,719
she desired.

115
00:09:42,719 --> 00:09:45,419
And Rachel was desiring what Leah had.

116
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:47,799
She wanted to have children and she was barren.

117
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:53,559
We see this conflict that's taking place and she comes to this place in verse number 20

118
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:56,520
where she says, now you see the confidence.

119
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,840
Now Jacob will dwell with me.

120
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,039
I have born him.

121
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:03,719
She gave Him six sons.

122
00:10:03,719 --> 00:10:06,839
It's interesting.

123
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:08,959
There was a time in which she acknowledged

124
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,699
that God was the One that was the Giver,

125
00:10:11,699 --> 00:10:13,759
that God was the One that was in control,

126
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:15,679
and she comes to the place in the birth

127
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,399
of her fourth son Judah

128
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:22,519
where she says, now will I praise the Lord.

129
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:26,759
And here's the last of the sons of Leah, Zebulun,

130
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,959
and she refers to God.

131
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,639
She says, God hath endued me with a good dowry.

132
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:33,519
And she refers to God once again

133
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,559
as Elohim, not as Jehovah.

134
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:39,959
And we find once again this desire

135
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:42,879
that she voices of my husband

136
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:44,599
will dwell with me.

137
00:10:44,599 --> 00:10:46,159
Afterwards, in v. 21,

138
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:48,479
the Bible says that she bared a daughter

139
00:10:48,479 --> 00:10:50,439
and called her name Dinah.

140
00:10:50,439 --> 00:10:51,959
And it says this in v. 22,

141
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:54,639
it's interesting, the Bible says that God remembered Rachel

142
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:56,199
and God hearkened to her

143
00:10:56,199 --> 00:10:57,359
and opened her womb.

144
00:10:57,359 --> 00:10:59,599
Let me just help us understand

145
00:10:59,599 --> 00:11:01,859
a little bit about v. 22 here.

146
00:11:01,859 --> 00:11:03,919
You understand that God doesn't forget anything.

147
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:06,399
So when the Bible says that God remembered Rachel,

148
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,199
it's not that he had forgotten her,

149
00:11:08,199 --> 00:11:10,199
it's not in that context.

150
00:11:10,199 --> 00:11:11,879
But we find that the Bible tells us

151
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:14,439
is the attention of the dialogue

152
00:11:14,439 --> 00:11:16,599
is now turned back to Rachel.

153
00:11:16,599 --> 00:11:18,699
And it says that God remembered Rachel.

154
00:11:18,699 --> 00:11:20,759
Notice where it says that God hearkened to her,

155
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:23,479
he heard her, remember her desire

156
00:11:23,479 --> 00:11:26,199
to begin chapter number 30.

157
00:11:26,199 --> 00:11:27,439
In v. 1, it says,

158
00:11:27,439 --> 00:11:30,639
and when Rachel saw that she bared Jacob no children,

159
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:33,159
Rachel envied her sister and said unto Jacob,

160
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:35,419
give me children or else I die.

161
00:11:35,419 --> 00:11:37,919
We found that in chapter number 29,

162
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:39,759
the Bible taught us that she was barren

163
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:41,839
and she longed to have children.

164
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,179
And I think there's a great problem here

165
00:11:44,179 --> 00:11:47,339
where she was envying her sister.

166
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:48,959
We mentioned that last week

167
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,699
and how terrible envy is

168
00:11:51,699 --> 00:11:53,519
and we ought not be envious.

169
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,759
We ought not have envy in our lives

170
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:59,759
and we understand that that was her position

171
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:01,319
at the beginning of the chapter.

172
00:12:01,319 --> 00:12:03,919
But as we come to the latter part here

173
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:05,719
of Genesis chapter number 30

174
00:12:05,719 --> 00:12:07,819
and looking at the birth of Joseph,

175
00:12:07,819 --> 00:12:10,399
we see that the Bible tells us

176
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,119
that God remembered her, hearkened to her

177
00:12:14,119 --> 00:12:17,359
and had opened her womb.

178
00:12:17,359 --> 00:12:20,199
And the reality is that that envy

179
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:22,759
that she had at the beginning of chapter 30

180
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:25,379
led to great strife.

181
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:30,379
It led to just carnality and fleshly living.

182
00:12:31,479 --> 00:12:33,439
And if we're not careful,

183
00:12:33,439 --> 00:12:35,279
envy in our lives will result

184
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,839
in the same type of behavior.

185
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,479
I understand that the circumstances

186
00:12:39,479 --> 00:12:41,399
will be quite different than what they are here

187
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:43,019
in Genesis 29 and 30.

188
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:47,439
But it's amazing to me how there's this,

189
00:12:47,439 --> 00:12:51,119
when there's envy, there's this desire for vain glory.

190
00:12:51,119 --> 00:12:52,999
There's this desire for attention.

191
00:12:52,999 --> 00:12:54,239
There's this desire.

192
00:12:54,239 --> 00:12:56,199
And you see that between Rachel and Leah

193
00:12:56,199 --> 00:12:58,339
and I believe that it's so imperative

194
00:12:58,339 --> 00:13:01,979
that we can make that application in our lives.

195
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:06,019
The Bible tells us in verse 23 of Genesis 30

196
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:09,839
that she conceived and bear a son.

197
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,839
And notice what she says,

198
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:16,519
God hath taken away my reproach.

199
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:18,619
She says God hath taken away my reproach.

200
00:13:18,619 --> 00:13:21,499
She recognizes that God is the giver of life.

201
00:13:21,499 --> 00:13:25,939
She acknowledges God here in verse number 23

202
00:13:25,939 --> 00:13:27,259
as being Elohim.

203
00:13:27,259 --> 00:13:29,619
We see that in the verse that she says,

204
00:13:29,619 --> 00:13:32,659
God hath taken away my reproach, the Lord.

205
00:13:32,659 --> 00:13:34,299
Now remember that she says,

206
00:13:34,299 --> 00:13:37,139
or Jacob said this to her in verse number two

207
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:38,739
of Genesis 30, when she said,

208
00:13:38,739 --> 00:13:40,659
give me children or else I die.

209
00:13:40,659 --> 00:13:42,259
He said, am I in God's stead

210
00:13:42,259 --> 00:13:45,139
who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?

211
00:13:45,139 --> 00:13:47,359
Jacob is looking at Rachel and saying,

212
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:49,559
this is beyond my ability.

213
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:52,279
And here now we find that when she conceives

214
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:54,119
and bears a son that she says,

215
00:13:54,119 --> 00:13:57,879
God hath taken away my reproach.

216
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:02,359
We spoke last week about the significance

217
00:14:02,359 --> 00:14:05,119
within the culture of having children

218
00:14:05,119 --> 00:14:07,679
and especially having male children.

219
00:14:08,719 --> 00:14:10,799
You see it throughout the Old Testament

220
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:14,359
and you see that culture and that society

221
00:14:14,359 --> 00:14:18,159
placing such an emphasis and importance upon that.

222
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:20,639
And she says, God hath taken away my reproach.

223
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,639
I want you to see in verse 24, the continuation here.

224
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:29,519
The Bible says that she, Rachel, called his name Joseph.

225
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,159
She called his name Joseph and notice what she says,

226
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:36,839
the Lord shall add to me another son.

227
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:39,119
I believe here as you see the name Joseph,

228
00:14:39,119 --> 00:14:43,199
the word, the name literally means Jehovah has added.

229
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,239
And you see here that she says

230
00:14:45,239 --> 00:14:47,319
that the Lord shall add to me another son.

231
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:49,679
And when you think about the name Joseph

232
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:51,919
and you think about the significance of Joseph,

233
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:55,039
and of course, as we close out over the next several months,

234
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:57,959
the book of Genesis will see a great emphasis

235
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:00,559
on the life of Joseph from chapter 37

236
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:01,959
until the end of the book.

237
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:03,439
And you see that emphasis,

238
00:15:03,439 --> 00:15:06,159
but we find here that she calls his name Joseph.

239
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:09,599
And again, she's in this text of scripture,

240
00:15:09,599 --> 00:15:13,639
she's not only referred to God as Elohim in verse 23,

241
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:18,639
but now in verse 24, she refers to the Lord as Jehovah.

242
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:20,919
She refers to the Lord as Jehovah.

243
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:25,159
I believe that in the life of Rachel,

244
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:28,799
it started with carnality and with envy

245
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:31,439
and all of this fleshly desire.

246
00:15:31,439 --> 00:15:34,199
But as we come here to verse number 24,

247
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:36,299
and we see the birth of Joseph,

248
00:15:36,299 --> 00:15:38,599
we find that now Rachel is the one

249
00:15:38,599 --> 00:15:42,079
that is on this pinnacle of spirituality, if you will.

250
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,679
She's at this place where she's acknowledging God,

251
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:48,599
not only as Elohim, but also as Jehovah.

252
00:15:48,599 --> 00:15:51,259
I believe that her life and her behavior

253
00:15:51,259 --> 00:15:56,259
are now being dominated not by carnality, but by faith.

254
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,879
Notice what she says again there

255
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:00,519
at the end of verse number 24.

256
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:05,519
She says, the Lord shall add to me another son.

257
00:16:06,019 --> 00:16:08,899
Not only is she now operating with this understanding

258
00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:12,259
of God being the giver of life and God blessing her

259
00:16:12,259 --> 00:16:13,819
and allowing her to have son,

260
00:16:13,819 --> 00:16:16,399
but she now has this faith

261
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,379
that God's going to add another son.

262
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:21,419
You know, it's interesting,

263
00:16:21,419 --> 00:16:25,019
the correlation between our walk and our behavior

264
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:28,699
and as we walk with God and as we're walking in the Spirit,

265
00:16:28,699 --> 00:16:30,939
how we can exercise faith.

266
00:16:32,379 --> 00:16:34,979
As we're walking with Him and we're trusting Him

267
00:16:35,319 --> 00:16:38,039
and we're enjoying, I love this chorus

268
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:40,799
that we're singing this year that goes along with our theme.

269
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:43,719
I walk with the King, hallelujah.

270
00:16:43,719 --> 00:16:47,059
I mean, it's a joy to walk with the Lord Jesus Christ,

271
00:16:47,059 --> 00:16:50,679
to enjoy that fellowship with Him on a daily basis.

272
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:53,479
And we find that now Rachel is in this place

273
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:56,119
of really the mountaintop, if you will,

274
00:16:56,119 --> 00:16:58,259
that Leah had vacated.

275
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:01,879
Leah had left that place at the end of chapter number 29

276
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:03,779
and she calls His name Judah and she says,

277
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:05,299
I'm gonna praise the Lord,

278
00:17:05,299 --> 00:17:08,319
but she allows outward influences.

279
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,519
She allows those external influences

280
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:13,059
to impact her walk with God.

281
00:17:14,399 --> 00:17:15,819
But now we find Rachel

282
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:18,599
on that mountaintop of spirituality.

283
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:21,459
We see Rachel not only being spiritual,

284
00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:23,679
but we see the faith that she displays

285
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,119
when she says the Lord shall add to me another son.

286
00:17:28,259 --> 00:17:33,259
This evening, we ought not allow any external influences

287
00:17:33,399 --> 00:17:35,119
to affect our walk with God.

288
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:38,679
Honestly.

289
00:17:41,239 --> 00:17:45,119
My walk with God must be protected.

290
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:48,239
Your walk with God must be protected.

291
00:17:48,239 --> 00:17:50,039
And as we walk with God,

292
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:53,559
we're not going to allow the external influences

293
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:56,319
to hinder my walk with God.

294
00:17:56,319 --> 00:18:00,479
I'm not willing to sacrifice my walk with God

295
00:18:00,499 --> 00:18:04,019
because of some external influence in my life.

296
00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:09,019
I'm not willing to get into a carnal match of wits

297
00:18:10,199 --> 00:18:13,979
and of fleshly ambitions as Rachel and Leah

298
00:18:13,979 --> 00:18:17,419
find themselves in and seeing my spirituality

299
00:18:17,419 --> 00:18:18,739
just disappear.

300
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:20,939
No.

301
00:18:22,739 --> 00:18:24,299
I'm walking with my King.

302
00:18:25,619 --> 00:18:30,359
And you can't influence my walk with God.

303
00:18:31,059 --> 00:18:34,099
Oh, that we'd really be in that place.

304
00:18:34,099 --> 00:18:36,539
If we'd be honest this evening,

305
00:18:36,539 --> 00:18:40,940
there are times no doubt that external influences

306
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:43,519
do in fact impact our walk with God.

307
00:18:44,899 --> 00:18:46,339
I'm not speaking this evening

308
00:18:46,339 --> 00:18:47,919
just of the positive influences.

309
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,179
I'm speaking primarily of the negative influences.

310
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:55,019
That we allow the behavior of others

311
00:18:55,019 --> 00:18:57,179
that we would respond in like manner,

312
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:59,859
that we would go to the same level of carnality

313
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,479
as others would deal with

314
00:19:01,479 --> 00:19:05,259
and that we would jeopardize our walk with God.

315
00:19:06,719 --> 00:19:07,899
It's tragic.

316
00:19:09,219 --> 00:19:11,119
It happens so often.

317
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:13,279
Turn to Psalm 90, if you will.

318
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:17,019
I want to look at just a reference here in Psalm 90.

319
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:26,239
Psalm 90 is a prayer of Moses.

320
00:19:29,859 --> 00:19:34,859
We don't have time to look at the entirety

321
00:19:35,179 --> 00:19:36,940
of the Psalm this evening,

322
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:40,459
but I want you to begin looking with me in verse number nine.

323
00:19:40,459 --> 00:19:43,219
He says, for all our days are passed away in thy wrath.

324
00:19:43,219 --> 00:19:46,940
We spend our years as a tale that is told.

325
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:49,739
The days of our years are three score years and 10.

326
00:19:49,739 --> 00:19:52,699
And if by reason of strength, they be four score years.

327
00:19:52,699 --> 00:19:54,639
Yet is there strength, labor, and sorrow

328
00:19:54,639 --> 00:19:57,500
for to soon cut off and we fly away.

329
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,899
Who knoweth the power of thine anger

330
00:19:58,899 --> 00:20:00,299
even according to thy fear.

331
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:04,739
So is thy wrath. So teach us to number our days that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom

332
00:20:05,219 --> 00:20:10,419
I want you to look back in verse number 9 and I want you to consider that last phrase when he says we spend our

333
00:20:10,419 --> 00:20:13,039
Years as a tale that is told

334
00:20:13,619 --> 00:20:15,619
I want you to think about your story

335
00:20:15,739 --> 00:20:21,419
I want you to think this evening about Leah and Rachel and their story in Genesis 29 and 30

336
00:20:22,379 --> 00:20:24,819
And I want you to think this evening if we can make

337
00:20:25,379 --> 00:20:30,939
Application and using this portion of scripture this evening to make application and to think about our own lives

338
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:32,939
I want you to think about their story

339
00:20:33,379 --> 00:20:36,779
Because the Bible says that we live our life as a tale that is told

340
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:41,179
Every day there's some

341
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:44,419
Entry into our story

342
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:51,819
The the story of our lives is being written as I think about it from a from a

343
00:20:52,739 --> 00:20:53,939
perspective of

344
00:20:53,939 --> 00:20:57,379
My life and I think about the the entirety of my life

345
00:20:57,379 --> 00:21:02,619
I think about the fact of course my story if I would look at it from a from a pure

346
00:21:03,619 --> 00:21:06,659
Total lifespan of my life. It started on my day of birth

347
00:21:09,259 --> 00:21:14,539
The greatest page inserted in my story was the day of my second birth and

348
00:21:15,099 --> 00:21:18,659
If you've been born again, that's the greatest page in your story as well

349
00:21:18,699 --> 00:21:23,299
Amen that day that we trust that the Lord Jesus Christ is our personal Savior

350
00:21:23,299 --> 00:21:27,259
That's the I mean, by the way, that's the most important page at any of our books

351
00:21:29,019 --> 00:21:31,019
But I want you to think about this as

352
00:21:31,859 --> 00:21:32,939
our

353
00:21:32,939 --> 00:21:35,139
life is being lived as

354
00:21:35,619 --> 00:21:36,819
that

355
00:21:36,819 --> 00:21:41,979
Story the tale that's going to be told. I want you to think this evening of

356
00:21:43,059 --> 00:21:46,419
The way in which that that book is being written

357
00:21:47,419 --> 00:21:52,779
and as we think about that book being written that tale that is told and and we think about the

358
00:21:53,179 --> 00:21:56,699
The ending of that book is going to be when we leave this earth

359
00:21:58,299 --> 00:22:01,859
None of our book has ended yet. You're all still here. Amen, and

360
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:05,579
But but the reality is that the book is going to end

361
00:22:06,379 --> 00:22:13,179
We read books and we see there's a beginning to a book and there's an end to a book and our tale our life story

362
00:22:13,179 --> 00:22:15,179
There's a beginning and there's an end

363
00:22:15,339 --> 00:22:21,579
But I want you to think about the the entries into the book on a daily basis and I want you to think about

364
00:22:23,339 --> 00:22:25,339
Who influences

365
00:22:25,539 --> 00:22:27,539
How that story is written as?

366
00:22:28,419 --> 00:22:30,419
We think about Leah and Rachel

367
00:22:31,139 --> 00:22:33,339
Now we have the ability to read it

368
00:22:33,979 --> 00:22:37,539
This portion of their life that's recorded for us. And by the way

369
00:22:38,179 --> 00:22:41,799
It's not something that I'd be pleased to have preserved for other people to read

370
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,799
Amen I

371
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:48,199
It's tragic

372
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,799
The carnality

373
00:22:51,239 --> 00:22:53,239
fleshly living

374
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:55,679
But God recorded it

375
00:22:56,759 --> 00:23:03,679
Aren't you kind of happy that your story isn't gonna be read by people for you understand I'm saying

376
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:09,159
Would it be something if Leah's story

377
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,159
Was not influenced by Rachel

378
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:23,599
If Leah said you know what I'm not gonna allow that behavior that external influence to affect

379
00:23:24,959 --> 00:23:26,959
my story

380
00:23:26,959 --> 00:23:32,719
I'm not going to to go to that same measure. I'm not going to employ those same

381
00:23:34,199 --> 00:23:36,199
behaviors

382
00:23:36,959 --> 00:23:42,439
Unfortunately as we've read and as we've studied and as you know the passage of Scripture that's not what happened

383
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:46,159
But as we make application tonight and we think about our own lives

384
00:23:47,199 --> 00:23:51,039
Who's that person that we came into contact with last week that really kind of?

385
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:56,639
Pushed our buttons. I used that phrase last Sunday night. My dad likes using that phrase. I

386
00:23:57,399 --> 00:23:59,399
Have no idea what it means

387
00:23:59,879 --> 00:24:02,119
I'm teasing. I know exactly what it means

388
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:04,399
But

389
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:07,959
Listen if we're honest this evening with the Lord and with ourselves

390
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,759
There are times that people

391
00:24:13,999 --> 00:24:16,440
Influence how our story is written

392
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:20,959
Positive and negative

393
00:24:21,479 --> 00:24:28,119
I'm thinking tonight more of the negative aspect because of the the context and what we're dealing with with Rachel and Leah

394
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:30,159
But

395
00:24:30,199 --> 00:24:34,879
Oh that we'd come to the place where we say listen, I'm not gonna let you

396
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,839
External influence. I'm not gonna let your carnality

397
00:24:39,879 --> 00:24:42,399
impact my walk with God

398
00:24:43,199 --> 00:24:46,839
My tail that is being told I think about Joseph

399
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:53,500
that's the 11th son that we're speaking of here at this spiritual high point in the life of Rachel when she

400
00:24:53,699 --> 00:24:58,739
Acknowledges God as both Elohim and Jehovah when her life is not only

401
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:02,179
Demonstrating her

402
00:25:02,179 --> 00:25:05,859
Spirituality but her faith and we find that at this particular point

403
00:25:05,859 --> 00:25:09,339
But when you think about the life of Joseph and you think about his story

404
00:25:10,539 --> 00:25:13,619
Isn't it a blessing to read Genesis 37 through 50?

405
00:25:13,619 --> 00:25:18,940
I understand that Genesis 38 doesn't deal with Joseph whatsoever, but it starts in Genesis 37

406
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:24,099
It skips 38 and 39 through 50 so much of the life of Joseph is on display

407
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:34,139
Are there some people that had an opportunity to have an external influence in the life of Joseph to cause him to live

408
00:25:35,099 --> 00:25:37,099
fleshly and carnal

409
00:25:38,379 --> 00:25:41,019
Absolutely, but do we read it? I

410
00:25:42,739 --> 00:25:45,539
Don't read there in the life of

411
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:49,419
Joseph where he behaved himself unwisely

412
00:25:49,419 --> 00:25:53,940
I don't read in the life of Joseph where he allowed the

413
00:25:54,379 --> 00:26:00,199
the wicked behavior of his brothers when he allowed the the false accusation of

414
00:26:00,899 --> 00:26:08,699
Potiphar's wife. I don't read where Joseph is allowing those things to cause him to respond in like fashion

415
00:26:09,979 --> 00:26:11,859
right and

416
00:26:11,859 --> 00:26:18,179
This evening we must understand as we look at this portion of Scripture that that God is

417
00:26:18,379 --> 00:26:25,059
In control and God has a purpose and I must get to the point where I say my walk with God is of utmost

418
00:26:25,339 --> 00:26:29,239
Priority and I'm not gonna allow these other people to influence my walk with God

419
00:26:30,379 --> 00:26:32,379
I'm gonna keep my eyes on my God

420
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:37,299
I'm gonna I'm going to to seek to walk with him daily

421
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:44,379
I'm going to crucify my flesh. Listen. We all have the flesh and you know if

422
00:26:45,179 --> 00:26:52,139
You'd be honest this evening, you know what thing it is that can get you into the flesh faster than any other thing

423
00:26:52,659 --> 00:26:54,659
We know what it is

424
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,940
Don't we

425
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:05,699
Sometimes we allow competition that's what's going on here this conflict this competition between Rachel and Leah

426
00:27:07,299 --> 00:27:11,940
Go back to Genesis chapter number 35, if you will, we ended in 30 in verse 24

427
00:27:12,539 --> 00:27:16,500
when we read of the birth of Joseph and Rachel naming the

428
00:27:16,859 --> 00:27:22,659
11th son of Jacob and she says that she calls his name Joseph and said the Lord shall add to me another son

429
00:27:22,899 --> 00:27:26,739
many things transpire between the birth of Joseph and the

430
00:27:27,299 --> 00:27:33,699
Final son that would be born to Jacob here in Genesis chapter 35 and over the next several weeks and months

431
00:27:33,699 --> 00:27:40,099
We'll study these portions of Scripture and we'll see the events in the life of Jacob and all those things that transpire

432
00:27:40,099 --> 00:27:45,259
But we pick it up in Genesis 35 in verse 16. The Bible says that they journeyed from Bethel

433
00:27:45,259 --> 00:27:48,500
there was but a little way to come to Ephra Ephrath and

434
00:27:48,979 --> 00:27:55,699
Rachel travailed and she had hard labor and it came to pass when she was in hard labor that the midwife said unto her fear not

435
00:27:55,940 --> 00:28:02,339
Thou shalt have this son also and it came to pass as her soul was in departing for she died

436
00:28:02,619 --> 00:28:08,179
That she called his name Ben. Oh, Ben. Oh nigh, but his father called him Benjamin

437
00:28:08,339 --> 00:28:13,259
verse 19 says that Rachel died and was buried in the way of Ephrath, which is in Beth

438
00:28:13,259 --> 00:28:18,940
Which is Bethlehem and Jacob said a pillar upon her grave. That is the pillar of Rachel's grave unto

439
00:28:19,379 --> 00:28:27,359
This day we find son number 12 of Jacob born here in Genesis 35 in verse number 5 15. Excuse me

440
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:32,119
Rachel named him Ben. Oh nine, which means son of sorrow

441
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:35,559
but we find that Jacob named him Benjamin and we often

442
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:40,880
Obviously as we look at the tribe of Benjamin and we speak of Benjamin we use that name

443
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,159
That's the name that Jacob gave him and it's it means son of my right hand

444
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:50,839
or son of honor or good fortune and we understand that

445
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:54,239
Rachel here dies and she is departing

446
00:28:54,239 --> 00:28:59,760
It says as her soul was departing in verse number 18 for she died and in the birth of Benjamin

447
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,760
And so thus we see the twelve sons of Jacob. I mentioned this last week

448
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,959
Obviously God could have just given us a list and just a few verses of Scripture and said here are the sons of Jacob

449
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:13,320
Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam and just given us all twelve

450
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,839
But he gave us all of these details

451
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:23,760
some of which we've not read for sake of the the audience and sake of the the youth that's here this evening and we've

452
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,279
We've skipped over some of those things in the last two weeks

453
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,719
But as God has given us this

454
00:29:30,679 --> 00:29:37,959
Passage of Scripture and he's given us the record of the sons of Jacob. I believe this evening that there is application in our lives

455
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:40,799
certainly

456
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,039
The circumstances are going to vary

457
00:29:43,959 --> 00:29:48,359
The circumstances aren't going to be in having sons being born

458
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:56,000
But when you see the behavior between these two individuals, you can see that we can operate in like fashion

459
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,279
Isn't amazing the things that can cause us to get into the

460
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:03,939
flesh, and to behave carnally.

461
00:30:03,939 --> 00:30:09,319
Let me just finish with this example this evening as we look at a New Testament principle.

462
00:30:09,319 --> 00:30:13,559
It's in the book of 1 Corinthians, and we know as we'd study through the book of 1 Corinthians

463
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:17,159
that the church in Corinth was not a model church.

464
00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:18,599
Amen?

465
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:23,439
The church in 1 Corinthians, in Corinth that's being written to there in 1 Corinthians, they're

466
00:30:23,439 --> 00:30:27,079
not a model church, and they have so many problems.

467
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:29,559
Paul says, I can't write unto you as unto spiritual.

468
00:30:29,559 --> 00:30:30,559
Why?

469
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:31,919
Because you're carnal.

470
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:35,699
He tells them right in the beginning of the book, he speaks to them about the reports

471
00:30:35,699 --> 00:30:40,239
that he's received and how he believes them, and the carnality that was there.

472
00:30:40,239 --> 00:30:44,599
But let me remind you, just as we look at this passage of Scripture with the sons of

473
00:30:44,599 --> 00:30:50,359
Jacob, and we can look at it and say, what in the world is going on?

474
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:58,719
The depth of depravity really that you see in the carnality and the fleshly behavior.

475
00:30:58,879 --> 00:31:02,119
Why must I remind ourselves of the church in Corinth?

476
00:31:02,119 --> 00:31:04,119
You know what they were fighting about?

477
00:31:04,119 --> 00:31:05,559
You know what they had carnality about?

478
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:11,099
There's a whole lot of things, but one thing in particular was spiritual gifts.

479
00:31:11,099 --> 00:31:13,479
Now just think about that for just a moment.

480
00:31:13,479 --> 00:31:16,319
Who gives the spiritual gift?

481
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:19,359
God, right?

482
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:21,079
We understand that biblically.

483
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:26,999
The Bible says that he giveth to every man as he wills.

484
00:31:26,999 --> 00:31:31,619
Who gave the children for Jacob, the sons of Jacob, to Rachel and Leah?

485
00:31:31,619 --> 00:31:34,839
It's God that gives children.

486
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:38,519
And that was the source of their conflict and their carnality.

487
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:44,839
And here we find in a church, a New Testament body of believers that have understood the

488
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:49,319
gospel of Jesus Christ that had been preached to them, and they've been saved by the blood

489
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:53,839
of Jesus Christ, that now they're having divisions and they're having fighting.

490
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:58,999
I'm of Paul, I'm of Cephas, all of that stuff is going on, but then there's this huge battle

491
00:31:58,999 --> 00:32:04,839
over spiritual gifts.

492
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:09,439
My spiritual gift is better than yours, right?

493
00:32:09,439 --> 00:32:14,279
You read the book of 1 Corinthians, it's absolutely what happens.

494
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:18,959
And there's this competition about the spiritual gifts, but we find that as we read the whole

495
00:32:18,959 --> 00:32:23,879
of Scripture, we find that as we read the book of 1 Corinthians, that absolutely it

496
00:32:23,879 --> 00:32:29,759
is God that gives the gift and he gives it for the purpose that all would profit from

497
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:30,759
it.

498
00:32:30,759 --> 00:32:35,959
And ultimately the number one goal is that God would be glorified.

499
00:32:35,959 --> 00:32:40,479
We find that Peter writes of spiritual gifts and he says, as every man hath received the

500
00:32:40,479 --> 00:32:48,119
gift, even so let him minister as of the ability that God giveth, that in all things he might

501
00:32:48,119 --> 00:32:50,439
be glorified.

502
00:32:50,439 --> 00:32:52,399
And that's the purpose of the spiritual gifts.

503
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:58,699
But when we look at that example this evening in closing, it is absolutely striking to me

504
00:32:58,699 --> 00:33:08,559
that we too as New Testament believers can get involved in mudslinging, fleshly, carnal

505
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:09,559
behavior.

506
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:13,519
And it ought not be.

507
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:19,199
It ought not be that Paul had to write to those believers as babes because they couldn't

508
00:33:19,199 --> 00:33:25,719
handle because they were carnal.

509
00:33:25,719 --> 00:33:30,599
This evening, I don't want to be carnal.

510
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:34,159
I hope that you have no desire to be carnal.

511
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:41,479
And I don't want to allow anyone else to cause me to operate in the flesh.

512
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:45,959
Paul said, I am crucified with Christ.

513
00:33:45,959 --> 00:33:50,359
We are to mortify the old man.

514
00:33:50,359 --> 00:33:56,679
We are to walk in the Spirit so that we do not fulfill the lust of the flesh.

515
00:33:56,679 --> 00:34:03,719
A preacher of yesteryear, he said this often, he said, you know what's something that's

516
00:34:03,719 --> 00:34:10,239
interesting about a dead man is that you can't offend a dead man.

517
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:16,599
It's a simple statement, but it's true.

518
00:34:16,599 --> 00:34:25,759
And he said, if I am dead, if I've been crucified with Christ, you can't offend me.

519
00:34:25,759 --> 00:34:29,519
I'm not going to be carnal.

520
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:34,959
And this evening, we see it in the life of Rachel and Leah, and oh, how we can criticize

521
00:34:34,959 --> 00:34:38,839
and we can just say, how in the world?

522
00:34:38,839 --> 00:34:41,959
Some of you came to me and said that.

523
00:34:41,959 --> 00:34:44,679
You said something like this three weeks ago.

524
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:47,359
How are you going to preach that passage of Scripture?

525
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:50,759
I got a few of those questions.

526
00:34:50,759 --> 00:34:56,879
I hope that after we've studied through this that we can see, yes, the historical context,

527
00:34:57,039 --> 00:35:05,199
but we can make application in our lives and say, I'm not going to live that way.

528
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:09,199
I'm going to keep my eyes on Jesus, and I'm going to walk in the Spirit with the help

529
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:15,279
of God, by the grace of God, and I'm not going to behave that way.

530
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:20,639
And if my story were preserved and written down for others to read, they wouldn't read

531
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:24,379
that kind of behavior, amen?

532
00:35:24,379 --> 00:35:25,379
Because I wouldn't want…

533
00:35:25,379 --> 00:35:26,379
I'd be embarrassed.

534
00:35:26,379 --> 00:35:27,379
Wouldn't you?

535
00:35:27,379 --> 00:35:28,379
I'd be embarrassed.

536
00:35:28,379 --> 00:35:34,579
We say day by day, I'm going to walk with my Savior.

537
00:35:34,579 --> 00:35:35,579
Let's pray together.

538
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:36,579
Father, we love You.

539
00:35:36,579 --> 00:35:39,339
We thank You for loving us.

540
00:35:39,339 --> 00:35:41,219
Thank You for the Word of God.

541
00:35:41,219 --> 00:35:47,459
Indeed, a challenging passage of Scripture that we've looked at these last two weeks,

542
00:35:47,459 --> 00:35:52,259
but I hope in some way that as we've sought to make application and thinking about our

543
00:35:52,259 --> 00:35:58,339
own lives, and even looking this evening in closing at the believers in Corinth, that

544
00:35:58,339 --> 00:36:04,299
we'd acknowledge that we too can operate in the flesh.

545
00:36:04,299 --> 00:36:07,219
Carnality can be prevalent in our lives.

546
00:36:07,219 --> 00:36:15,699
We can allow those external influences to cause us to abandon spirituality and faith.

547
00:36:15,699 --> 00:36:17,619
God, I pray that it would not be so in our lives.

548
00:36:17,619 --> 00:36:22,339
I pray that we'd stay so close to You, that we'd be so concerned about protecting

549
00:36:22,339 --> 00:36:32,219
our walk with You, that we'd allow for no external influences to hinder that walk, that

550
00:36:32,219 --> 00:36:39,459
we would walk in the Spirit, that we would please You, and that You would be pleased

551
00:36:39,459 --> 00:36:40,459
with our lives.

552
00:36:40,459 --> 00:36:43,699
I pray, God, that You'd move and work as only You can.

553
00:36:43,699 --> 00:36:47,339
We'll thank You for every decision that is made, for it's in Christ's name we pray.

554
00:36:47,339 --> 00:36:48,339
Amen.

555
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:48,339
