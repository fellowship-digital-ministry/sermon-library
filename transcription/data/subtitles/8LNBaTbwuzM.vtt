WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.239
evening, Genesis chapter number 30, and this is part two of the message that I started

00:00:05.239 --> 00:00:10.920
last week that I entitled, The Sons of Jacob, and of course, as we began studying last week,

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.340
we started to go through, starting in chapter 29 and verse number 31, and going down and

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:22.159
looking at the sons of Jacob and the way in which God blessed, and of course, his recognition

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:27.479
of understanding that life is a gift from God, and we're thankful that God is the giver

00:00:27.479 --> 00:00:28.479
of life.

00:00:28.479 --> 00:00:34.599
And as we studied through the first eight of the sons of Jacob last week and looked

00:00:34.599 --> 00:00:42.520
at what was taking place, we understand that there was a real competition that was going

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:49.680
on between Leah and Rachel, and as we highlighted through the names of the sons of Jacob and

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:56.119
the way in which the mothers would name their children, that you would see that competition

00:00:56.119 --> 00:01:00.880
that was taking place, and we mentioned as we went through and studied the names of

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:09.919
these sons and what their names mean and the recognition at times by the mother with the

00:01:09.919 --> 00:01:17.559
name of God and recognizing God's favor and God's blessing, and then the depth of carnality

00:01:17.559 --> 00:01:24.480
and the competition and how they began to compete one with another, and as we looked

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:31.120
at these first eight sons, we noticed and left on a high note with son number four in

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:39.559
verse number 35 of Genesis 29, that this son, his name was Judah, and here's what the Bible

00:01:39.559 --> 00:01:46.440
tells us, that here's what Leah said in verse number 35 of Genesis 29, "'Now will I praise

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.519
the Lord.'

00:01:49.519 --> 00:01:52.680
Therefore she called his name Judah and left bearing.'"

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.839
As we looked at that particular juncture of our text of Scripture and we mentioned

00:01:57.839 --> 00:02:02.400
how that she says, "'Now will I praise the Lord.'"

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.919
Once again, she's acknowledging God as being Jehovah God.

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:13.679
That reference was completely dismissed when she named Levi in verse number 34.

00:02:13.679 --> 00:02:19.880
There's no reference to God whatsoever, and here in verse 35 of Genesis 29, she's saying

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:26.039
that she's going to praise the Lord Jehovah, and she called his name Judah, which literally

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:27.360
means praise.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.880
I believe that her joy and praise, as I mentioned last week, would be in the Lord, that no longer

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:39.279
would she be focused upon this conflict with Rachel, and what a joy and what a blessing.

00:02:39.279 --> 00:02:46.679
But we find that Rachel begins to implement some really worldly, carnal behavior because

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.520
she sees that she has no children.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:55.080
And seeing that she has no children, we find that she goes through these extents of being

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:01.520
able to have children legally and handmade, and we find that this competition and this

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:07.360
depth of carnality had a great impact upon Leah.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.559
And I'm kind of reviewing these things very quickly because it's interesting when we left

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:19.320
off with Leah at son number 8 in verse number 13 of Genesis 30, I want you to notice what

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:27.919
Leah says, and the contrast between son number 4, Judah, and son number 8, Asher.

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:33.800
In verse number 13 of Genesis 30, it says, and Leah said, happy am I, for the daughters

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.440
will call me blessed, and she called his name Asher.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:44.320
We mentioned that the name Judah means praise, and she says, now will I praise the Lord,

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:50.000
acknowledging Jehovah, and here after the carnality that Rachel employs, and after

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:57.800
all that takes place with this fleshly living, and Leah operating in like fashion, now she

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.820
can only name her son happy.

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:08.539
She says, happy am I, and notice what it is that would bring her a level of happiness.

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:13.740
She says, for the daughters will call me blessed.

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:18.420
You know, it's a terrible thing when we're more concerned about what people think about

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:25.480
us than what God knows about us, and we find that in this verse of Scripture, these two

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:31.480
verses of Scripture in verse 35 of chapter 29 and verse 13 of chapter 30, we see the

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.359
height and the depth in the life of Leah.

00:04:35.359 --> 00:04:40.079
And as I mentioned last week, and I believe that it's important that we understand tonight

00:04:40.079 --> 00:04:47.799
that we look at the historical context of this portion of Scripture, and we understand

00:04:47.799 --> 00:04:53.640
that God is giving us the record of the sons of Jacob, but as we trace through and we see

00:04:53.760 --> 00:05:00.320
what's taking place, we can understand as well that we can operate spiritually, or we

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:07.079
can operate carnally, and the reality is that there are times in which we can allow other

00:05:07.079 --> 00:05:14.480
people to influence our behavior.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:18.640
Leah was at a high point in verse number 35.

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:33.399
In Rachel, she employed fleshly, carnal methodology, and Leah responded in like fashion.

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:39.519
She goes from that pinnacle of spirituality, if you will, in verse 35, to a place of just

00:05:39.519 --> 00:05:43.440
slinging mud and competing with her sister.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.440
And that's tragic.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.320
As we continue through the text of Scripture, we come to verse number 18 and we see son

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:58.559
number 9, and notice the Bible says in verse 17 of Genesis 30, it says,

00:05:58.559 --> 00:06:02.679
And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived and bare Jacob the fifth son.

00:06:02.679 --> 00:06:07.760
And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given my maiden to my husband,

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.359
and she called his name Issachar.

00:06:11.359 --> 00:06:17.119
We find that here in verse number 18, we see son number 9, and his name Issachar means

00:06:17.119 --> 00:06:19.519
there is recompense or there is reward.

00:06:19.519 --> 00:06:26.239
I will say this for sake of the audience this evening, verses 14 through 17 I'm not going

00:06:26.239 --> 00:06:31.880
to read publicly this evening, but I want you to understand that the circumstances surrounding

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:37.920
the birth of Issachar are unfortunate to say the least.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:42.760
And when you see what happens between Leah and Rachel in those verses of Scripture, and

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:49.920
you see how Reuben the firstborn was used and how Jacob comes back and all of the carnality,

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.040
it's really a sad situation.

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:56.959
And here as she names him Issachar, there is recompense or there is reward.

00:06:56.959 --> 00:07:03.720
We see once again this battle, this conflict between sisters.

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:08.320
And we find that in verse number 18 when she calls his name Issachar, she also says

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:15.640
this, notice what she says, God hath given me my hire.

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:22.160
She's acknowledged God, but she's no longer acknowledging God as being Jehovah.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.359
She's acknowledging God as being Elohim or Lord.

00:07:25.359 --> 00:07:30.559
And we've mentioned this before, we've seen this behavior in the life of Leah in previous

00:07:30.559 --> 00:07:36.679
text of Scripture, in the life of Rachel, and we find here that as she has this ninth

00:07:36.679 --> 00:07:42.720
son, that these circumstances that are just wild beyond our imagination, the depth of

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:43.720
carnality.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:50.440
But as we see historically in the context of what's happening, we must understand that

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:58.000
we too can sink to some pretty low levels of carnality.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:05.480
The Bible tells us in 1 Corinthians 10, let him that thinketh he standeth, take heed lest

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:07.940
he fall.

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:12.040
You know, it's absolutely imperative that you and I walk in the Spirit so that we do

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:15.279
not fulfill the lust of the flesh.

00:08:15.279 --> 00:08:22.279
After salvation, the Holy Spirit of God indwelled us, isn't that wonderful?

00:08:22.279 --> 00:08:24.320
And He enables us.

00:08:24.519 --> 00:08:27.359
We still have a flesh.

00:08:27.359 --> 00:08:31.000
And our flesh still has fleshly desires.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.840
And we can still reach these depths of carnality.

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:39.640
And we see that here with son number nine, continue to move forward with me in verse

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:40.640
number 19.

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:43.520
It says that Leah conceived again and bear Jacob the sixth son.

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:48.440
And it says that Leah said, God hath endued me with a good dowry.

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:52.880
Now will my husband dwell with me because I have born him six sons.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:56.239
And she called his name Zebulun.

00:08:56.239 --> 00:08:58.239
The name Zebulun means dwelling.

00:08:58.239 --> 00:09:02.239
And notice what she says, God hath endued me with good dowry.

00:09:02.239 --> 00:09:05.099
She then makes this statement in verse number 20.

00:09:05.099 --> 00:09:08.880
She says, now will my husband dwell with me.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.820
Isn't that what she's been longing for all along?

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:16.640
She acknowledges in the beginning of our text in chapter number 29, how that when she had

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:20.960
Reuben that God, the Lord Jehovah, hath looked upon my affliction.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.659
Now, therefore, my husband will love me.

00:09:23.659 --> 00:09:28.960
And she goes through that process and she has that, that confidence when Levi is born

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:30.559
in verse number 34.

00:09:30.559 --> 00:09:33.880
Now this time, will my husband be joined unto me?

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:34.880
Why?

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:36.280
Because I have born him three sons.

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:41.719
And we find that she was longing for that relationship with Jacob and that that's what

00:09:41.719 --> 00:09:42.719
she desired.

00:09:42.719 --> 00:09:45.419
And Rachel was desiring what Leah had.

00:09:45.419 --> 00:09:47.799
She wanted to have children and she was barren.

00:09:48.159 --> 00:09:53.559
We see this conflict that's taking place and she comes to this place in verse number 20

00:09:53.559 --> 00:09:56.520
where she says, now you see the confidence.

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:58.840
Now Jacob will dwell with me.

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:00.039
I have born him.

00:10:00.039 --> 00:10:03.719
She gave Him six sons.

00:10:03.719 --> 00:10:06.839
It's interesting.

00:10:06.839 --> 00:10:08.959
There was a time in which she acknowledged

00:10:08.959 --> 00:10:11.699
that God was the One that was the Giver,

00:10:11.699 --> 00:10:13.759
that God was the One that was in control,

00:10:13.759 --> 00:10:15.679
and she comes to the place in the birth

00:10:15.679 --> 00:10:17.399
of her fourth son Judah

00:10:17.399 --> 00:10:22.519
where she says, now will I praise the Lord.

00:10:22.519 --> 00:10:26.759
And here's the last of the sons of Leah, Zebulun,

00:10:26.759 --> 00:10:28.959
and she refers to God.

00:10:28.959 --> 00:10:31.639
She says, God hath endued me with a good dowry.

00:10:31.639 --> 00:10:33.519
And she refers to God once again

00:10:33.519 --> 00:10:36.559
as Elohim, not as Jehovah.

00:10:36.559 --> 00:10:39.959
And we find once again this desire

00:10:39.959 --> 00:10:42.879
that she voices of my husband

00:10:42.879 --> 00:10:44.599
will dwell with me.

00:10:44.599 --> 00:10:46.159
Afterwards, in v. 21,

00:10:46.159 --> 00:10:48.479
the Bible says that she bared a daughter

00:10:48.479 --> 00:10:50.439
and called her name Dinah.

00:10:50.439 --> 00:10:51.959
And it says this in v. 22,

00:10:51.959 --> 00:10:54.639
it's interesting, the Bible says that God remembered Rachel

00:10:54.639 --> 00:10:56.199
and God hearkened to her

00:10:56.199 --> 00:10:57.359
and opened her womb.

00:10:57.359 --> 00:10:59.599
Let me just help us understand

00:10:59.599 --> 00:11:01.859
a little bit about v. 22 here.

00:11:01.859 --> 00:11:03.919
You understand that God doesn't forget anything.

00:11:03.919 --> 00:11:06.399
So when the Bible says that God remembered Rachel,

00:11:06.399 --> 00:11:08.199
it's not that he had forgotten her,

00:11:08.199 --> 00:11:10.199
it's not in that context.

00:11:10.199 --> 00:11:11.879
But we find that the Bible tells us

00:11:11.879 --> 00:11:14.439
is the attention of the dialogue

00:11:14.439 --> 00:11:16.599
is now turned back to Rachel.

00:11:16.599 --> 00:11:18.699
And it says that God remembered Rachel.

00:11:18.699 --> 00:11:20.759
Notice where it says that God hearkened to her,

00:11:20.759 --> 00:11:23.479
he heard her, remember her desire

00:11:23.479 --> 00:11:26.199
to begin chapter number 30.

00:11:26.199 --> 00:11:27.439
In v. 1, it says,

00:11:27.439 --> 00:11:30.639
and when Rachel saw that she bared Jacob no children,

00:11:30.639 --> 00:11:33.159
Rachel envied her sister and said unto Jacob,

00:11:33.159 --> 00:11:35.419
give me children or else I die.

00:11:35.419 --> 00:11:37.919
We found that in chapter number 29,

00:11:37.919 --> 00:11:39.759
the Bible taught us that she was barren

00:11:39.759 --> 00:11:41.839
and she longed to have children.

00:11:41.839 --> 00:11:44.179
And I think there's a great problem here

00:11:44.179 --> 00:11:47.339
where she was envying her sister.

00:11:47.339 --> 00:11:48.959
We mentioned that last week

00:11:48.959 --> 00:11:51.699
and how terrible envy is

00:11:51.699 --> 00:11:53.519
and we ought not be envious.

00:11:53.879 --> 00:11:56.759
We ought not have envy in our lives

00:11:56.759 --> 00:11:59.759
and we understand that that was her position

00:11:59.759 --> 00:12:01.319
at the beginning of the chapter.

00:12:01.319 --> 00:12:03.919
But as we come to the latter part here

00:12:03.919 --> 00:12:05.719
of Genesis chapter number 30

00:12:05.719 --> 00:12:07.819
and looking at the birth of Joseph,

00:12:07.819 --> 00:12:10.399
we see that the Bible tells us

00:12:10.399 --> 00:12:14.119
that God remembered her, hearkened to her

00:12:14.119 --> 00:12:17.359
and had opened her womb.

00:12:17.359 --> 00:12:20.199
And the reality is that that envy

00:12:20.199 --> 00:12:22.759
that she had at the beginning of chapter 30

00:12:22.799 --> 00:12:25.379
led to great strife.

00:12:25.379 --> 00:12:30.379
It led to just carnality and fleshly living.

00:12:31.479 --> 00:12:33.439
And if we're not careful,

00:12:33.439 --> 00:12:35.279
envy in our lives will result

00:12:35.279 --> 00:12:37.839
in the same type of behavior.

00:12:37.839 --> 00:12:39.479
I understand that the circumstances

00:12:39.479 --> 00:12:41.399
will be quite different than what they are here

00:12:41.399 --> 00:12:43.019
in Genesis 29 and 30.

00:12:44.159 --> 00:12:47.439
But it's amazing to me how there's this,

00:12:47.439 --> 00:12:51.119
when there's envy, there's this desire for vain glory.

00:12:51.119 --> 00:12:52.999
There's this desire for attention.

00:12:52.999 --> 00:12:54.239
There's this desire.

00:12:54.239 --> 00:12:56.199
And you see that between Rachel and Leah

00:12:56.199 --> 00:12:58.339
and I believe that it's so imperative

00:12:58.339 --> 00:13:01.979
that we can make that application in our lives.

00:13:03.199 --> 00:13:06.019
The Bible tells us in verse 23 of Genesis 30

00:13:06.019 --> 00:13:09.839
that she conceived and bear a son.

00:13:09.839 --> 00:13:11.839
And notice what she says,

00:13:11.839 --> 00:13:16.519
God hath taken away my reproach.

00:13:16.519 --> 00:13:18.619
She says God hath taken away my reproach.

00:13:18.619 --> 00:13:21.499
She recognizes that God is the giver of life.

00:13:21.499 --> 00:13:25.939
She acknowledges God here in verse number 23

00:13:25.939 --> 00:13:27.259
as being Elohim.

00:13:27.259 --> 00:13:29.619
We see that in the verse that she says,

00:13:29.619 --> 00:13:32.659
God hath taken away my reproach, the Lord.

00:13:32.659 --> 00:13:34.299
Now remember that she says,

00:13:34.299 --> 00:13:37.139
or Jacob said this to her in verse number two

00:13:37.139 --> 00:13:38.739
of Genesis 30, when she said,

00:13:38.739 --> 00:13:40.659
give me children or else I die.

00:13:40.659 --> 00:13:42.259
He said, am I in God's stead

00:13:42.259 --> 00:13:45.139
who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?

00:13:45.139 --> 00:13:47.359
Jacob is looking at Rachel and saying,

00:13:47.359 --> 00:13:49.559
this is beyond my ability.

00:13:49.559 --> 00:13:52.279
And here now we find that when she conceives

00:13:52.279 --> 00:13:54.119
and bears a son that she says,

00:13:54.119 --> 00:13:57.879
God hath taken away my reproach.

00:13:57.879 --> 00:14:02.359
We spoke last week about the significance

00:14:02.359 --> 00:14:05.119
within the culture of having children

00:14:05.119 --> 00:14:07.679
and especially having male children.

00:14:08.719 --> 00:14:10.799
You see it throughout the Old Testament

00:14:10.799 --> 00:14:14.359
and you see that culture and that society

00:14:14.359 --> 00:14:18.159
placing such an emphasis and importance upon that.

00:14:18.159 --> 00:14:20.639
And she says, God hath taken away my reproach.

00:14:20.639 --> 00:14:24.639
I want you to see in verse 24, the continuation here.

00:14:24.639 --> 00:14:29.519
The Bible says that she, Rachel, called his name Joseph.

00:14:29.519 --> 00:14:33.159
She called his name Joseph and notice what she says,

00:14:33.159 --> 00:14:36.839
the Lord shall add to me another son.

00:14:36.839 --> 00:14:39.119
I believe here as you see the name Joseph,

00:14:39.119 --> 00:14:43.199
the word, the name literally means Jehovah has added.

00:14:43.199 --> 00:14:45.239
And you see here that she says

00:14:45.239 --> 00:14:47.319
that the Lord shall add to me another son.

00:14:47.319 --> 00:14:49.679
And when you think about the name Joseph

00:14:49.679 --> 00:14:51.919
and you think about the significance of Joseph,

00:14:51.919 --> 00:14:55.039
and of course, as we close out over the next several months,

00:14:55.039 --> 00:14:57.959
the book of Genesis will see a great emphasis

00:14:57.959 --> 00:15:00.559
on the life of Joseph from chapter 37

00:15:00.559 --> 00:15:01.959
until the end of the book.

00:15:01.959 --> 00:15:03.439
And you see that emphasis,

00:15:03.439 --> 00:15:06.159
but we find here that she calls his name Joseph.

00:15:06.159 --> 00:15:09.599
And again, she's in this text of scripture,

00:15:09.599 --> 00:15:13.639
she's not only referred to God as Elohim in verse 23,

00:15:13.639 --> 00:15:18.639
but now in verse 24, she refers to the Lord as Jehovah.

00:15:18.679 --> 00:15:20.919
She refers to the Lord as Jehovah.

00:15:20.919 --> 00:15:25.159
I believe that in the life of Rachel,

00:15:25.159 --> 00:15:28.799
it started with carnality and with envy

00:15:28.799 --> 00:15:31.439
and all of this fleshly desire.

00:15:31.439 --> 00:15:34.199
But as we come here to verse number 24,

00:15:34.199 --> 00:15:36.299
and we see the birth of Joseph,

00:15:36.299 --> 00:15:38.599
we find that now Rachel is the one

00:15:38.599 --> 00:15:42.079
that is on this pinnacle of spirituality, if you will.

00:15:42.079 --> 00:15:44.679
She's at this place where she's acknowledging God,

00:15:44.679 --> 00:15:48.599
not only as Elohim, but also as Jehovah.

00:15:48.599 --> 00:15:51.259
I believe that her life and her behavior

00:15:51.259 --> 00:15:56.259
are now being dominated not by carnality, but by faith.

00:15:56.539 --> 00:15:58.879
Notice what she says again there

00:15:58.879 --> 00:16:00.519
at the end of verse number 24.

00:16:00.519 --> 00:16:05.519
She says, the Lord shall add to me another son.

00:16:06.019 --> 00:16:08.899
Not only is she now operating with this understanding

00:16:08.899 --> 00:16:12.259
of God being the giver of life and God blessing her

00:16:12.259 --> 00:16:13.819
and allowing her to have son,

00:16:13.819 --> 00:16:16.399
but she now has this faith

00:16:16.399 --> 00:16:19.379
that God's going to add another son.

00:16:19.379 --> 00:16:21.419
You know, it's interesting,

00:16:21.419 --> 00:16:25.019
the correlation between our walk and our behavior

00:16:25.019 --> 00:16:28.699
and as we walk with God and as we're walking in the Spirit,

00:16:28.699 --> 00:16:30.939
how we can exercise faith.

00:16:32.379 --> 00:16:34.979
As we're walking with Him and we're trusting Him

00:16:35.319 --> 00:16:38.039
and we're enjoying, I love this chorus

00:16:38.039 --> 00:16:40.799
that we're singing this year that goes along with our theme.

00:16:40.799 --> 00:16:43.719
I walk with the King, hallelujah.

00:16:43.719 --> 00:16:47.059
I mean, it's a joy to walk with the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:16:47.059 --> 00:16:50.679
to enjoy that fellowship with Him on a daily basis.

00:16:50.679 --> 00:16:53.479
And we find that now Rachel is in this place

00:16:53.479 --> 00:16:56.119
of really the mountaintop, if you will,

00:16:56.119 --> 00:16:58.259
that Leah had vacated.

00:16:58.259 --> 00:17:01.879
Leah had left that place at the end of chapter number 29

00:17:01.879 --> 00:17:03.779
and she calls His name Judah and she says,

00:17:03.779 --> 00:17:05.299
I'm gonna praise the Lord,

00:17:05.299 --> 00:17:08.319
but she allows outward influences.

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:10.519
She allows those external influences

00:17:10.519 --> 00:17:13.059
to impact her walk with God.

00:17:14.399 --> 00:17:15.819
But now we find Rachel

00:17:15.819 --> 00:17:18.599
on that mountaintop of spirituality.

00:17:18.599 --> 00:17:21.459
We see Rachel not only being spiritual,

00:17:21.459 --> 00:17:23.679
but we see the faith that she displays

00:17:23.679 --> 00:17:27.119
when she says the Lord shall add to me another son.

00:17:28.259 --> 00:17:33.259
This evening, we ought not allow any external influences

00:17:33.399 --> 00:17:35.119
to affect our walk with God.

00:17:37.839 --> 00:17:38.679
Honestly.

00:17:41.239 --> 00:17:45.119
My walk with God must be protected.

00:17:45.119 --> 00:17:48.239
Your walk with God must be protected.

00:17:48.239 --> 00:17:50.039
And as we walk with God,

00:17:50.039 --> 00:17:53.559
we're not going to allow the external influences

00:17:53.559 --> 00:17:56.319
to hinder my walk with God.

00:17:56.319 --> 00:18:00.479
I'm not willing to sacrifice my walk with God

00:18:00.499 --> 00:18:04.019
because of some external influence in my life.

00:18:04.019 --> 00:18:09.019
I'm not willing to get into a carnal match of wits

00:18:10.199 --> 00:18:13.979
and of fleshly ambitions as Rachel and Leah

00:18:13.979 --> 00:18:17.419
find themselves in and seeing my spirituality

00:18:17.419 --> 00:18:18.739
just disappear.

00:18:20.099 --> 00:18:20.939
No.

00:18:22.739 --> 00:18:24.299
I'm walking with my King.

00:18:25.619 --> 00:18:30.359
And you can't influence my walk with God.

00:18:31.059 --> 00:18:34.099
Oh, that we'd really be in that place.

00:18:34.099 --> 00:18:36.539
If we'd be honest this evening,

00:18:36.539 --> 00:18:40.940
there are times no doubt that external influences

00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:43.519
do in fact impact our walk with God.

00:18:44.899 --> 00:18:46.339
I'm not speaking this evening

00:18:46.339 --> 00:18:47.919
just of the positive influences.

00:18:47.919 --> 00:18:51.179
I'm speaking primarily of the negative influences.

00:18:51.179 --> 00:18:55.019
That we allow the behavior of others

00:18:55.019 --> 00:18:57.179
that we would respond in like manner,

00:18:57.179 --> 00:18:59.859
that we would go to the same level of carnality

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:01.479
as others would deal with

00:19:01.479 --> 00:19:05.259
and that we would jeopardize our walk with God.

00:19:06.719 --> 00:19:07.899
It's tragic.

00:19:09.219 --> 00:19:11.119
It happens so often.

00:19:11.119 --> 00:19:13.279
Turn to Psalm 90, if you will.

00:19:13.279 --> 00:19:17.019
I want to look at just a reference here in Psalm 90.

00:19:22.579 --> 00:19:26.239
Psalm 90 is a prayer of Moses.

00:19:29.859 --> 00:19:34.859
We don't have time to look at the entirety

00:19:35.179 --> 00:19:36.940
of the Psalm this evening,

00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:40.459
but I want you to begin looking with me in verse number nine.

00:19:40.459 --> 00:19:43.219
He says, for all our days are passed away in thy wrath.

00:19:43.219 --> 00:19:46.940
We spend our years as a tale that is told.

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:49.739
The days of our years are three score years and 10.

00:19:49.739 --> 00:19:52.699
And if by reason of strength, they be four score years.

00:19:52.699 --> 00:19:54.639
Yet is there strength, labor, and sorrow

00:19:54.639 --> 00:19:57.500
for to soon cut off and we fly away.

00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:58.899
Who knoweth the power of thine anger

00:19:58.899 --> 00:20:00.299
even according to thy fear.

00:20:00.299 --> 00:20:04.739
So is thy wrath. So teach us to number our days that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom

00:20:05.219 --> 00:20:10.419
I want you to look back in verse number 9 and I want you to consider that last phrase when he says we spend our

00:20:10.419 --> 00:20:13.039
Years as a tale that is told

00:20:13.619 --> 00:20:15.619
I want you to think about your story

00:20:15.739 --> 00:20:21.419
I want you to think this evening about Leah and Rachel and their story in Genesis 29 and 30

00:20:22.379 --> 00:20:24.819
And I want you to think this evening if we can make

00:20:25.379 --> 00:20:30.939
Application and using this portion of scripture this evening to make application and to think about our own lives

00:20:30.939 --> 00:20:32.939
I want you to think about their story

00:20:33.379 --> 00:20:36.779
Because the Bible says that we live our life as a tale that is told

00:20:39.179 --> 00:20:41.179
Every day there's some

00:20:42.419 --> 00:20:44.419
Entry into our story

00:20:45.619 --> 00:20:51.819
The the story of our lives is being written as I think about it from a from a

00:20:52.739 --> 00:20:53.939
perspective of

00:20:53.939 --> 00:20:57.379
My life and I think about the the entirety of my life

00:20:57.379 --> 00:21:02.619
I think about the fact of course my story if I would look at it from a from a pure

00:21:03.619 --> 00:21:06.659
Total lifespan of my life. It started on my day of birth

00:21:09.259 --> 00:21:14.539
The greatest page inserted in my story was the day of my second birth and

00:21:15.099 --> 00:21:18.659
If you've been born again, that's the greatest page in your story as well

00:21:18.699 --> 00:21:23.299
Amen that day that we trust that the Lord Jesus Christ is our personal Savior

00:21:23.299 --> 00:21:27.259
That's the I mean, by the way, that's the most important page at any of our books

00:21:29.019 --> 00:21:31.019
But I want you to think about this as

00:21:31.859 --> 00:21:32.939
our

00:21:32.939 --> 00:21:35.139
life is being lived as

00:21:35.619 --> 00:21:36.819
that

00:21:36.819 --> 00:21:41.979
Story the tale that's going to be told. I want you to think this evening of

00:21:43.059 --> 00:21:46.419
The way in which that that book is being written

00:21:47.419 --> 00:21:52.779
and as we think about that book being written that tale that is told and and we think about the

00:21:53.179 --> 00:21:56.699
The ending of that book is going to be when we leave this earth

00:21:58.299 --> 00:22:01.859
None of our book has ended yet. You're all still here. Amen, and

00:22:02.779 --> 00:22:05.579
But but the reality is that the book is going to end

00:22:06.379 --> 00:22:13.179
We read books and we see there's a beginning to a book and there's an end to a book and our tale our life story

00:22:13.179 --> 00:22:15.179
There's a beginning and there's an end

00:22:15.339 --> 00:22:21.579
But I want you to think about the the entries into the book on a daily basis and I want you to think about

00:22:23.339 --> 00:22:25.339
Who influences

00:22:25.539 --> 00:22:27.539
How that story is written as?

00:22:28.419 --> 00:22:30.419
We think about Leah and Rachel

00:22:31.139 --> 00:22:33.339
Now we have the ability to read it

00:22:33.979 --> 00:22:37.539
This portion of their life that's recorded for us. And by the way

00:22:38.179 --> 00:22:41.799
It's not something that I'd be pleased to have preserved for other people to read

00:22:42.799 --> 00:22:44.799
Amen I

00:22:46.199 --> 00:22:48.199
It's tragic

00:22:48.799 --> 00:22:50.799
The carnality

00:22:51.239 --> 00:22:53.239
fleshly living

00:22:53.679 --> 00:22:55.679
But God recorded it

00:22:56.759 --> 00:23:03.679
Aren't you kind of happy that your story isn't gonna be read by people for you understand I'm saying

00:23:07.079 --> 00:23:09.159
Would it be something if Leah's story

00:23:09.919 --> 00:23:13.159
Was not influenced by Rachel

00:23:15.679 --> 00:23:23.599
If Leah said you know what I'm not gonna allow that behavior that external influence to affect

00:23:24.959 --> 00:23:26.959
my story

00:23:26.959 --> 00:23:32.719
I'm not going to to go to that same measure. I'm not going to employ those same

00:23:34.199 --> 00:23:36.199
behaviors

00:23:36.959 --> 00:23:42.439
Unfortunately as we've read and as we've studied and as you know the passage of Scripture that's not what happened

00:23:43.279 --> 00:23:46.159
But as we make application tonight and we think about our own lives

00:23:47.199 --> 00:23:51.039
Who's that person that we came into contact with last week that really kind of?

00:23:51.759 --> 00:23:56.639
Pushed our buttons. I used that phrase last Sunday night. My dad likes using that phrase. I

00:23:57.399 --> 00:23:59.399
Have no idea what it means

00:23:59.879 --> 00:24:02.119
I'm teasing. I know exactly what it means

00:24:02.399 --> 00:24:04.399
But

00:24:04.799 --> 00:24:07.959
Listen if we're honest this evening with the Lord and with ourselves

00:24:09.279 --> 00:24:11.759
There are times that people

00:24:13.999 --> 00:24:16.440
Influence how our story is written

00:24:18.959 --> 00:24:20.959
Positive and negative

00:24:21.479 --> 00:24:28.119
I'm thinking tonight more of the negative aspect because of the the context and what we're dealing with with Rachel and Leah

00:24:28.159 --> 00:24:30.159
But

00:24:30.199 --> 00:24:34.879
Oh that we'd come to the place where we say listen, I'm not gonna let you

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.839
External influence. I'm not gonna let your carnality

00:24:39.879 --> 00:24:42.399
impact my walk with God

00:24:43.199 --> 00:24:46.839
My tail that is being told I think about Joseph

00:24:46.839 --> 00:24:53.500
that's the 11th son that we're speaking of here at this spiritual high point in the life of Rachel when she

00:24:53.699 --> 00:24:58.739
Acknowledges God as both Elohim and Jehovah when her life is not only

00:25:00.539 --> 00:25:02.179
Demonstrating her

00:25:02.179 --> 00:25:05.859
Spirituality but her faith and we find that at this particular point

00:25:05.859 --> 00:25:09.339
But when you think about the life of Joseph and you think about his story

00:25:10.539 --> 00:25:13.619
Isn't it a blessing to read Genesis 37 through 50?

00:25:13.619 --> 00:25:18.940
I understand that Genesis 38 doesn't deal with Joseph whatsoever, but it starts in Genesis 37

00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:24.099
It skips 38 and 39 through 50 so much of the life of Joseph is on display

00:25:25.859 --> 00:25:34.139
Are there some people that had an opportunity to have an external influence in the life of Joseph to cause him to live

00:25:35.099 --> 00:25:37.099
fleshly and carnal

00:25:38.379 --> 00:25:41.019
Absolutely, but do we read it? I

00:25:42.739 --> 00:25:45.539
Don't read there in the life of

00:25:46.379 --> 00:25:49.419
Joseph where he behaved himself unwisely

00:25:49.419 --> 00:25:53.940
I don't read in the life of Joseph where he allowed the

00:25:54.379 --> 00:26:00.199
the wicked behavior of his brothers when he allowed the the false accusation of

00:26:00.899 --> 00:26:08.699
Potiphar's wife. I don't read where Joseph is allowing those things to cause him to respond in like fashion

00:26:09.979 --> 00:26:11.859
right and

00:26:11.859 --> 00:26:18.179
This evening we must understand as we look at this portion of Scripture that that God is

00:26:18.379 --> 00:26:25.059
In control and God has a purpose and I must get to the point where I say my walk with God is of utmost

00:26:25.339 --> 00:26:29.239
Priority and I'm not gonna allow these other people to influence my walk with God

00:26:30.379 --> 00:26:32.379
I'm gonna keep my eyes on my God

00:26:33.419 --> 00:26:37.299
I'm gonna I'm going to to seek to walk with him daily

00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:44.379
I'm going to crucify my flesh. Listen. We all have the flesh and you know if

00:26:45.179 --> 00:26:52.139
You'd be honest this evening, you know what thing it is that can get you into the flesh faster than any other thing

00:26:52.659 --> 00:26:54.659
We know what it is

00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:57.940
Don't we

00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:05.699
Sometimes we allow competition that's what's going on here this conflict this competition between Rachel and Leah

00:27:07.299 --> 00:27:11.940
Go back to Genesis chapter number 35, if you will, we ended in 30 in verse 24

00:27:12.539 --> 00:27:16.500
when we read of the birth of Joseph and Rachel naming the

00:27:16.859 --> 00:27:22.659
11th son of Jacob and she says that she calls his name Joseph and said the Lord shall add to me another son

00:27:22.899 --> 00:27:26.739
many things transpire between the birth of Joseph and the

00:27:27.299 --> 00:27:33.699
Final son that would be born to Jacob here in Genesis chapter 35 and over the next several weeks and months

00:27:33.699 --> 00:27:40.099
We'll study these portions of Scripture and we'll see the events in the life of Jacob and all those things that transpire

00:27:40.099 --> 00:27:45.259
But we pick it up in Genesis 35 in verse 16. The Bible says that they journeyed from Bethel

00:27:45.259 --> 00:27:48.500
there was but a little way to come to Ephra Ephrath and

00:27:48.979 --> 00:27:55.699
Rachel travailed and she had hard labor and it came to pass when she was in hard labor that the midwife said unto her fear not

00:27:55.940 --> 00:28:02.339
Thou shalt have this son also and it came to pass as her soul was in departing for she died

00:28:02.619 --> 00:28:08.179
That she called his name Ben. Oh, Ben. Oh nigh, but his father called him Benjamin

00:28:08.339 --> 00:28:13.259
verse 19 says that Rachel died and was buried in the way of Ephrath, which is in Beth

00:28:13.259 --> 00:28:18.940
Which is Bethlehem and Jacob said a pillar upon her grave. That is the pillar of Rachel's grave unto

00:28:19.379 --> 00:28:27.359
This day we find son number 12 of Jacob born here in Genesis 35 in verse number 5 15. Excuse me

00:28:28.119 --> 00:28:32.119
Rachel named him Ben. Oh nine, which means son of sorrow

00:28:32.399 --> 00:28:35.559
but we find that Jacob named him Benjamin and we often

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:40.880
Obviously as we look at the tribe of Benjamin and we speak of Benjamin we use that name

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.159
That's the name that Jacob gave him and it's it means son of my right hand

00:28:45.839 --> 00:28:50.839
or son of honor or good fortune and we understand that

00:28:51.479 --> 00:28:54.239
Rachel here dies and she is departing

00:28:54.239 --> 00:28:59.760
It says as her soul was departing in verse number 18 for she died and in the birth of Benjamin

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:03.760
And so thus we see the twelve sons of Jacob. I mentioned this last week

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:09.959
Obviously God could have just given us a list and just a few verses of Scripture and said here are the sons of Jacob

00:29:10.359 --> 00:29:13.320
Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam and just given us all twelve

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:16.839
But he gave us all of these details

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:23.760
some of which we've not read for sake of the the audience and sake of the the youth that's here this evening and we've

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:26.279
We've skipped over some of those things in the last two weeks

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:29.719
But as God has given us this

00:29:30.679 --> 00:29:37.959
Passage of Scripture and he's given us the record of the sons of Jacob. I believe this evening that there is application in our lives

00:29:39.279 --> 00:29:40.799
certainly

00:29:40.799 --> 00:29:43.039
The circumstances are going to vary

00:29:43.959 --> 00:29:48.359
The circumstances aren't going to be in having sons being born

00:29:48.559 --> 00:29:56.000
But when you see the behavior between these two individuals, you can see that we can operate in like fashion

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.279
Isn't amazing the things that can cause us to get into the

00:30:00.279 --> 00:30:03.939
flesh, and to behave carnally.

00:30:03.939 --> 00:30:09.319
Let me just finish with this example this evening as we look at a New Testament principle.

00:30:09.319 --> 00:30:13.559
It's in the book of 1 Corinthians, and we know as we'd study through the book of 1 Corinthians

00:30:13.559 --> 00:30:17.159
that the church in Corinth was not a model church.

00:30:17.159 --> 00:30:18.599
Amen?

00:30:18.599 --> 00:30:23.439
The church in 1 Corinthians, in Corinth that's being written to there in 1 Corinthians, they're

00:30:23.439 --> 00:30:27.079
not a model church, and they have so many problems.

00:30:27.079 --> 00:30:29.559
Paul says, I can't write unto you as unto spiritual.

00:30:29.559 --> 00:30:30.559
Why?

00:30:30.559 --> 00:30:31.919
Because you're carnal.

00:30:31.919 --> 00:30:35.699
He tells them right in the beginning of the book, he speaks to them about the reports

00:30:35.699 --> 00:30:40.239
that he's received and how he believes them, and the carnality that was there.

00:30:40.239 --> 00:30:44.599
But let me remind you, just as we look at this passage of Scripture with the sons of

00:30:44.599 --> 00:30:50.359
Jacob, and we can look at it and say, what in the world is going on?

00:30:50.359 --> 00:30:58.719
The depth of depravity really that you see in the carnality and the fleshly behavior.

00:30:58.879 --> 00:31:02.119
Why must I remind ourselves of the church in Corinth?

00:31:02.119 --> 00:31:04.119
You know what they were fighting about?

00:31:04.119 --> 00:31:05.559
You know what they had carnality about?

00:31:05.559 --> 00:31:11.099
There's a whole lot of things, but one thing in particular was spiritual gifts.

00:31:11.099 --> 00:31:13.479
Now just think about that for just a moment.

00:31:13.479 --> 00:31:16.319
Who gives the spiritual gift?

00:31:16.319 --> 00:31:19.359
God, right?

00:31:19.359 --> 00:31:21.079
We understand that biblically.

00:31:21.079 --> 00:31:26.999
The Bible says that he giveth to every man as he wills.

00:31:26.999 --> 00:31:31.619
Who gave the children for Jacob, the sons of Jacob, to Rachel and Leah?

00:31:31.619 --> 00:31:34.839
It's God that gives children.

00:31:34.839 --> 00:31:38.519
And that was the source of their conflict and their carnality.

00:31:38.519 --> 00:31:44.839
And here we find in a church, a New Testament body of believers that have understood the

00:31:44.839 --> 00:31:49.319
gospel of Jesus Christ that had been preached to them, and they've been saved by the blood

00:31:49.319 --> 00:31:53.839
of Jesus Christ, that now they're having divisions and they're having fighting.

00:31:54.799 --> 00:31:58.999
I'm of Paul, I'm of Cephas, all of that stuff is going on, but then there's this huge battle

00:31:58.999 --> 00:32:04.839
over spiritual gifts.

00:32:04.839 --> 00:32:09.439
My spiritual gift is better than yours, right?

00:32:09.439 --> 00:32:14.279
You read the book of 1 Corinthians, it's absolutely what happens.

00:32:14.279 --> 00:32:18.959
And there's this competition about the spiritual gifts, but we find that as we read the whole

00:32:18.959 --> 00:32:23.879
of Scripture, we find that as we read the book of 1 Corinthians, that absolutely it

00:32:23.879 --> 00:32:29.759
is God that gives the gift and he gives it for the purpose that all would profit from

00:32:29.759 --> 00:32:30.759
it.

00:32:30.759 --> 00:32:35.959
And ultimately the number one goal is that God would be glorified.

00:32:35.959 --> 00:32:40.479
We find that Peter writes of spiritual gifts and he says, as every man hath received the

00:32:40.479 --> 00:32:48.119
gift, even so let him minister as of the ability that God giveth, that in all things he might

00:32:48.119 --> 00:32:50.439
be glorified.

00:32:50.439 --> 00:32:52.399
And that's the purpose of the spiritual gifts.

00:32:52.399 --> 00:32:58.699
But when we look at that example this evening in closing, it is absolutely striking to me

00:32:58.699 --> 00:33:08.559
that we too as New Testament believers can get involved in mudslinging, fleshly, carnal

00:33:08.559 --> 00:33:09.559
behavior.

00:33:09.559 --> 00:33:13.519
And it ought not be.

00:33:13.519 --> 00:33:19.199
It ought not be that Paul had to write to those believers as babes because they couldn't

00:33:19.199 --> 00:33:25.719
handle because they were carnal.

00:33:25.719 --> 00:33:30.599
This evening, I don't want to be carnal.

00:33:30.599 --> 00:33:34.159
I hope that you have no desire to be carnal.

00:33:34.159 --> 00:33:41.479
And I don't want to allow anyone else to cause me to operate in the flesh.

00:33:41.599 --> 00:33:45.959
Paul said, I am crucified with Christ.

00:33:45.959 --> 00:33:50.359
We are to mortify the old man.

00:33:50.359 --> 00:33:56.679
We are to walk in the Spirit so that we do not fulfill the lust of the flesh.

00:33:56.679 --> 00:34:03.719
A preacher of yesteryear, he said this often, he said, you know what's something that's

00:34:03.719 --> 00:34:10.239
interesting about a dead man is that you can't offend a dead man.

00:34:10.239 --> 00:34:16.599
It's a simple statement, but it's true.

00:34:16.599 --> 00:34:25.759
And he said, if I am dead, if I've been crucified with Christ, you can't offend me.

00:34:25.759 --> 00:34:29.519
I'm not going to be carnal.

00:34:29.519 --> 00:34:34.959
And this evening, we see it in the life of Rachel and Leah, and oh, how we can criticize

00:34:34.959 --> 00:34:38.839
and we can just say, how in the world?

00:34:38.839 --> 00:34:41.959
Some of you came to me and said that.

00:34:41.959 --> 00:34:44.679
You said something like this three weeks ago.

00:34:44.679 --> 00:34:47.359
How are you going to preach that passage of Scripture?

00:34:47.359 --> 00:34:50.759
I got a few of those questions.

00:34:50.759 --> 00:34:56.879
I hope that after we've studied through this that we can see, yes, the historical context,

00:34:57.039 --> 00:35:05.199
but we can make application in our lives and say, I'm not going to live that way.

00:35:05.199 --> 00:35:09.199
I'm going to keep my eyes on Jesus, and I'm going to walk in the Spirit with the help

00:35:09.199 --> 00:35:15.279
of God, by the grace of God, and I'm not going to behave that way.

00:35:15.279 --> 00:35:20.639
And if my story were preserved and written down for others to read, they wouldn't read

00:35:20.639 --> 00:35:24.379
that kind of behavior, amen?

00:35:24.379 --> 00:35:25.379
Because I wouldn't want…

00:35:25.379 --> 00:35:26.379
I'd be embarrassed.

00:35:26.379 --> 00:35:27.379
Wouldn't you?

00:35:27.379 --> 00:35:28.379
I'd be embarrassed.

00:35:28.379 --> 00:35:34.579
We say day by day, I'm going to walk with my Savior.

00:35:34.579 --> 00:35:35.579
Let's pray together.

00:35:35.579 --> 00:35:36.579
Father, we love You.

00:35:36.579 --> 00:35:39.339
We thank You for loving us.

00:35:39.339 --> 00:35:41.219
Thank You for the Word of God.

00:35:41.219 --> 00:35:47.459
Indeed, a challenging passage of Scripture that we've looked at these last two weeks,

00:35:47.459 --> 00:35:52.259
but I hope in some way that as we've sought to make application and thinking about our

00:35:52.259 --> 00:35:58.339
own lives, and even looking this evening in closing at the believers in Corinth, that

00:35:58.339 --> 00:36:04.299
we'd acknowledge that we too can operate in the flesh.

00:36:04.299 --> 00:36:07.219
Carnality can be prevalent in our lives.

00:36:07.219 --> 00:36:15.699
We can allow those external influences to cause us to abandon spirituality and faith.

00:36:15.699 --> 00:36:17.619
God, I pray that it would not be so in our lives.

00:36:17.619 --> 00:36:22.339
I pray that we'd stay so close to You, that we'd be so concerned about protecting

00:36:22.339 --> 00:36:32.219
our walk with You, that we'd allow for no external influences to hinder that walk, that

00:36:32.219 --> 00:36:39.459
we would walk in the Spirit, that we would please You, and that You would be pleased

00:36:39.459 --> 00:36:40.459
with our lives.

00:36:40.459 --> 00:36:43.699
I pray, God, that You'd move and work as only You can.

00:36:43.699 --> 00:36:47.339
We'll thank You for every decision that is made, for it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:36:47.339 --> 00:36:48.339
Amen.

00:36:48.339 --> 00:36:48.339
