WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.920
12, and this is only the fourth week in this new series, the first half of the year. We

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:12.640
dealt with the 1 Thessalonians chapter 5, the latter portion of that, and the latter

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:19.639
portion of 2 Thessalonians chapter 3. And as we looked at that, those various principles

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:26.479
that were contained therein, we finished that up right at the end of June. Walk Worthy and

00:00:26.479 --> 00:00:32.799
Please God, that was the title of that six-month series, and I certainly enjoyed teaching through

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:37.680
those principles and making the application. And then a month ago, we started a brand new

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:44.680
series on Wednesday evenings, and doing what we ought to do. And doing what we ought to

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:50.520
do, I've said this each week, that knowing what we ought to do doesn't mean we do what

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:57.599
we ought to do, but certainly if we know, it goes a long way to helping us do the things

00:00:57.599 --> 00:01:02.639
that we ought to do. Here in Romans chapter 12, we're going to deal with a subject this

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:09.400
evening, if you're taking notes, I've titled the message, We Ought to Walk Humbly. We ought

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:16.400
to walk humbly. God has much to say about pride and humility in His Word. In fact, the

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:22.000
text that is before us, we find that Paul is going to provide some brief instruction

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.400
with regard to spiritual gifts. And as he gives this instruction, he's going to preface

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.639
the instruction with this admonition to every recipient. Notice what he says in verse number

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:38.839
3, Romans 12 and verse number 3, as we're diving right in, the Bible says, For I say,

00:01:38.839 --> 00:01:45.040
through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you. And so we see that

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:51.139
this admonition, this charge is being given to every recipient. Of course, through preservation,

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:55.519
this admonition or warning is given to us as well. Notice what it says right in the

00:01:55.519 --> 00:02:05.519
midst of verse number 3, Not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to

00:02:05.519 --> 00:02:13.440
think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith. We find

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:20.119
that the charge to walk humbly within the context of spiritual gifts, it grabs my attention.

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:25.240
And I think about spiritual gifts and I understand that if we would, if these believers would

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.639
have a proper understanding of spiritual gifts, I believe that what would be promoted in our

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:38.080
lives is humility, not pride. But we find that a careful study of the book of 1 Corinthians,

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:44.559
the church at Corinth, we find that we are reminded as to why this particular admonition

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:50.399
is given within the context of spiritual gifts. We find that the church in Corinth, they had

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:56.039
many problems, of course much as a result of their carnality and the divisions and what

00:02:56.039 --> 00:03:01.960
have you, but there was a situation there in Corinth where they were, look at the spiritual

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.960
gift that I have and I'm better than you are because of the spiritual gift that I have

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.919
versus the spiritual gift that you have. And they had an understanding that was not

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:16.559
appropriate with regard to spiritual gifts, but we find here that Paul is giving this

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:22.639
instruction in Romans chapter 12, again just a brief text through verse number 8 with regard

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:30.279
to spiritual gifts. He says that we are not to think of him, this charge to every man,

00:03:30.279 --> 00:03:35.199
not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think. It reminds me of Micah 6 and

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:39.320
verse number 8 where the Bible says, he hath showed thee, O man, what is good and what

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:45.919
doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:50.279
thy God. And we begin to look at this text of Scripture this evening and this thought

00:03:50.279 --> 00:03:55.479
of walking in humility and the importance of it, and I believe that in order for us

00:03:55.479 --> 00:04:00.440
to walk in humility, there are two things that we must acknowledge. If you're taking

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.600
notes this evening, the first two thoughts for you are those things that we must acknowledge

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:11.759
before we will really walk in humility. And the first one is we must acknowledge the desire

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:16.119
of our own flesh. We must acknowledge the desire of our own flesh. What do I mean by

00:04:16.119 --> 00:04:23.559
that? Well, your flesh desires glory. Your flesh desires attention. My flesh, we understand

00:04:23.559 --> 00:04:28.040
humanity, we understand the human nature, and the reality is that we find throughout

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.480
the Scriptures many examples. We do not have time here on a Wednesday evening to really

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:38.760
do an in-depth study of all the examples that God gives us, but we find that it is a natural

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:47.600
tendency of mankind to desire recognition, glory, to have that desire. In fact, Paul

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.119
says in 2 Corinthians chapter 12, and we're going to look at that passage in just a moment,

00:04:52.119 --> 00:04:55.320
I'm just going to quote the first part of the verse. He says,

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:02.880
"...though I would desire to glory." Now, he's going to say why he's not going to glory,

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:08.399
but it's interesting as he gives us that insight, "...though I would desire to glory." Listen,

00:05:08.399 --> 00:05:14.160
this evening if we're going to walk in humility, we must first acknowledge the desire of our

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:21.040
flesh. Our flesh desires recognition. Our flesh wants to think of ourselves more highly

00:05:21.079 --> 00:05:26.839
than we ought to think of ourselves, and we have this issue with pride, and it's certainly

00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:32.279
a carnal, fleshly issue. Go back to the book of 2 Chronicles, if you will. We're going to look

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:38.720
just at two brief examples in the Old Testament. 2 Chronicles chapter 26, and in this text of

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:45.160
Scripture, God gives us some information about a king by the name of Uzziah. And this king is,

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:52.160
God tells us several things about him, and early on in his ministry, we find that he sought the

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:58.760
Lord, according to verse number 5 of 2 Chronicles 26. The Bible says that he sought God in the days

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:04.720
of Zechariah, who had understanding in the visions of God, and as long as he sought the Lord, God

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:10.679
made him to prosper. There's a whole message in that verse of Scripture, how we ought to seek

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:15.959
the Lord, and ought to put the Lord first. In verse 7, the verse begins by saying, and God

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:20.839
helped him. In verse number 8, at the end of the verse, it says that he strengthened himself

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:28.839
exceedingly, and God was working, and God was allowing Uzziah to prosper. And we find that the

00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:34.600
text of Scripture, without going through all of the details, we find the advancements, if you will,

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:40.119
within the kingdom during his reign, and all that was taking place. But we come to chapter,

00:06:40.119 --> 00:06:43.880
to verse number 15 in chapter 26, and the Bible says this,

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:50.839
and he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by cunning men, to be on the towers and upon the

00:06:50.839 --> 00:06:57.559
bulwarks, to shoot arrows and great stones withal. And notice what the Bible says, and his name was

00:06:57.559 --> 00:07:04.839
spread far abroad, for he was marvelously helped, and then notice these words, till he was strong.

00:07:05.399 --> 00:07:11.320
And you look at verse 16, and it says, but when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:19.880
destruction. If we're not careful, our heart too will be lifted up. Why? Because of the desire of

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:26.119
our flesh. We find that this man Uzziah, he was helped of the Lord. We find that God was the one

00:07:26.119 --> 00:07:31.559
that was making him to prosper. But when his name was spread far abroad, when he was marvelously

00:07:31.559 --> 00:07:37.640
helped, he becomes strong, and he gets this attention, and his heart is lifted up in pride,

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:43.880
and it leads to destruction. The desire of Uzziah is no different than the desire of any one of us.

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:49.880
The flesh that Uzziah was dealing with is the same flesh that we deal with, and we find this

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:56.839
evening that just as Uzziah had his name spread abroad, all of a sudden someone starts talking

00:07:56.839 --> 00:08:03.640
about and starts recognizing we can get that big head syndrome, and we can think more highly

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:08.119
of ourselves than we ought to think, and I'm telling you, your flesh likes that.

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:15.079
Our flesh likes that. It's a desire of the flesh. At Nebuchadnezzar in Daniel chapter 4, and we'll

00:08:15.079 --> 00:08:19.399
look at Daniel again in just a few moments. You might want to hold your place there. Turn to

00:08:19.399 --> 00:08:24.679
Daniel chapter 4, if you will, and we'll just read one verse at this point, and then I'll come back

00:08:24.679 --> 00:08:31.000
and read a couple of verses here in just a moment, but in Daniel chapter 4, we find that there was a

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:37.960
vision or a dream, and Daniel is going to provide that interpretation, but in verse number 30,

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:44.039
I want you to see what happens after the interpretation was given, and Daniel provided

00:08:44.679 --> 00:08:50.840
Nebuchadnezzar with exactly what God was going to do because of the pride of this man,

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:55.320
but in verse number 29, it says, at the end of 12 months, he walked in the palace of the kingdom

00:08:55.320 --> 00:09:00.679
of Babylon, and notice in Daniel 4, in verse number 30, notice what King Nebuchadnezzar says.

00:09:00.679 --> 00:09:06.760
It says that the king spake and said, is not this great Babylon that, notice when he says,

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:14.919
I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power and for the honor of my

00:09:15.559 --> 00:09:22.359
majesty. He was full of himself. He was a prideful man. He was actually, I mean, he was a super

00:09:22.359 --> 00:09:27.159
powerful man. We understand that as you read throughout the book of Daniel and even other

00:09:27.159 --> 00:09:32.440
portions of scripture in Jeremiah, and you see the power of Nebuchadnezzar leading the nation of

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:39.640
Babylon, but we find that his heart was lifted up, and just as Nebuchadnezzar here in Daniel 4

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:46.760
would have that desire to say, look at what I've done. Look at what I've accomplished. Look at what

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:54.280
I've, all of that pride, and it's a desire of our flesh. If we're going to walk in humility,

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:59.880
we must acknowledge this evening that my flesh, your flesh, that our flesh

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:02.840
has a desire to glory.

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.580
The second thing that we must acknowledge

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:08.580
is the danger of pride, the danger of pride.

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:11.980
God tells us several things about pride in his word.

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:14.560
Again, this evening, it's not an exhaustive study,

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:16.160
but we find in the book of Proverbs,

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.200
Proverbs 13, if you will,

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.920
God gives us a couple of truths here

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:22.060
in the book of Proverbs with regard to pride

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:25.240
that are important for us to point out this evening

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:28.880
as we acknowledge the danger of pride.

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:31.940
The Bible tells us here in Proverbs 13 in verse number 10

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:34.380
that pride leads to contention.

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:38.420
And we have a lot of contention in our world today.

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:41.520
We have a lot of contention in our homes today.

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:44.660
Unfortunately, there's contention in our churches today.

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:47.460
And we find the Bible tells us in Proverbs 13

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:51.960
in verse number 10, only by pride cometh contention,

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:54.400
but the well-advised is wisdom.

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:57.600
Pride leads to contention.

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:58.800
I'm right, you're wrong.

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:00.960
It's my way, not your way.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.700
And we find that here,

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:07.040
he talks about the source of contention being pride.

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.940
And we see that so often.

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:13.380
And we see that the result of that

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:16.880
as it's revealed to us in Proverbs 16 in verse number 18,

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:19.780
where the Bible says a familiar verse of scripture,

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:23.380
pride goeth before destruction

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:26.480
and in haughty spirit before a fall.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:29.500
We see this in the life of Nebuchadnezzar.

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:32.820
We see that he's lifted up and look at what I've done.

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:35.540
Look at what I've accomplished.

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:40.540
Only by pride cometh or pride goeth before destruction.

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:43.360
And we find that in Nebuchadnezzar's life,

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:46.180
I told you to hold your place there in Daniel four,

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:47.820
but in verse number 30,

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:52.100
we read there of his elevating himself.

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:55.300
And the Bible says there in verse number 34,

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:57.680
at the end of the day, as I, Nebuchadnezzar lifted,

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:00.040
well, let me back up to verse number 31.

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:02.360
While the word was in the king's mouth,

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:05.200
there fell a voice from heaven.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.160
Here's what the voice said.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:09.460
O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken,

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:11.480
the kingdom is departed from thee

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:13.200
and they shall drive thee from men

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:15.400
and thy dwelling shall be with the beast of the field.

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:18.400
They shall make thee to eat grass as oxen

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:20.360
and seven times shall pass over thee

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.919
until thou know that the most high ruleth

00:12:22.919 --> 00:12:27.300
in the kingdom of men and giveth it to whomsoever he will.

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:29.620
The same hour.

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:32.260
You see those words in your Bible in verse 33?

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:37.260
The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar.

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:40.380
And he was driven from men and did eat grass as oxen.

00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:42.700
His body was wet with the dew of heaven

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:45.200
till his hairs were grown like eagle's feathers

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:48.820
and his nails like bird's claws.

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:49.860
You say, no.

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:52.680
Yeah, that's what happened.

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:57.400
Pride goeth before destruction.

00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:00.680
He barely got the words out of his mouth in verse number 30.

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:02.080
Look at all of this.

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:04.020
Look at all that I've done.

00:13:04.919 --> 00:13:06.600
While the word was in his mouth,

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:09.720
verse 31 tells us there fell a voice from heaven.

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:11.120
And in that same hour,

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:13.600
notice what Nebuchadnezzar acknowledges

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:17.200
at the end of this duration that he's there

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:18.480
driven out to the field.

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:19.820
It says in verse 37,

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:22.419
now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and extol and honor

00:13:22.419 --> 00:13:23.740
the king of heaven,

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:26.300
all whose works are truth and his ways judgment.

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:29.340
And then notice this last phrase of verse 37.

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:32.059
And those that walk in pride,

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:35.419
he is able to abase.

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:39.020
Nebuchadnezzar learned it the hard way.

00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:39.919
Did he not?

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.940
See, we must acknowledge the danger of pride.

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:48.639
So many today fail to acknowledge the desire

00:13:48.639 --> 00:13:50.919
of their flesh to have that glory,

00:13:50.919 --> 00:13:53.559
and therefore they're not walking in humility.

00:13:53.559 --> 00:13:56.340
They fail to acknowledge the danger of pride,

00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:59.559
and therefore they do not walk in humility.

00:13:59.559 --> 00:14:02.260
We live in a prideful society.

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:07.400
We find that God says this in James 4, 6,

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:10.400
and again in 1 Peter 5 and verse number 5.

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:14.620
He tells us that God resisteth the proud,

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:16.559
but giveth grace unto the humble.

00:14:16.559 --> 00:14:18.459
I'm not sure what you,

00:14:18.459 --> 00:14:20.559
if you get an image in your mind

00:14:20.559 --> 00:14:25.559
when you read those words that God resisteth the proud,

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:27.119
but in my mind's eye,

00:14:27.119 --> 00:14:32.119
I have the picture of someone resisting and pushing,

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:35.320
and God says he resisteth the proud,

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:38.559
but he giveth grace unto the humble.

00:14:38.559 --> 00:14:41.440
Have you ever had somebody that was resisting you,

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:43.200
that you were resisting them?

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:46.739
I don't want God to resist me.

00:14:46.739 --> 00:14:48.339
Pride leads to contention.

00:14:48.339 --> 00:14:49.580
It leads to destruction.

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:52.360
We find that those who walk in pride,

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:55.100
God says that he resists.

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:57.260
He resisteth the proud.

00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:01.339
Nebuchadnezzar we spoke of in Uzziah's situation

00:15:01.339 --> 00:15:04.059
as we referenced in 2 Chronicles 26.

00:15:04.059 --> 00:15:07.100
He was lifted up in pride, and so what did he do?

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:08.339
Well, he tried to do those things

00:15:08.339 --> 00:15:10.140
that did not pertain to him.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.360
He thought that he could fulfill

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:15.760
the responsibility of the priest, but he was the king,

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:18.880
and he was not permitted to go and to give

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:22.679
and to burn the incense and to do the duty of the priest.

00:15:22.679 --> 00:15:25.559
It was not for him to do so.

00:15:25.559 --> 00:15:27.360
We find that he went in and did so,

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:28.720
and there are some priests that went in

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:33.279
and they held him back, but he became leprous,

00:15:33.279 --> 00:15:35.720
the leprosy immediately.

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:40.779
See, pride leads to destruction,

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:44.500
but there's so many, unfortunately,

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:47.420
that we come in contact with that we, too,

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:50.600
at times in our lives, that we, too, are prideful.

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:53.220
We acknowledge the desire of our flesh,

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:57.020
the danger of pride, and by acknowledging those two truths,

00:15:57.020 --> 00:16:00.700
does it mean that we automatically will walk in humility?

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:02.779
Well, of course, the answer is no.

00:16:02.779 --> 00:16:04.779
Just because we acknowledge that something

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:07.679
is wrong doesn't mean that we're going

00:16:07.679 --> 00:16:10.760
to walk the way that we ought to walk,

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:14.399
and so, too often, we are guilty of being prideful,

00:16:14.399 --> 00:16:18.720
even though we know the consequences,

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:21.600
even though we know that God resisteth the proud,

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:24.179
even though we know that pride leads to contention

00:16:24.179 --> 00:16:26.360
and that pride cometh before destruction,

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:31.360
there are times still that we walk being proud

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:35.300
and not walking in humility.

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:38.739
I wanna give you two tips this evening.

00:16:38.739 --> 00:16:42.059
I gave you two truths that we need to acknowledge

00:16:42.059 --> 00:16:47.059
in order to come to the place of walking in humility,

00:16:47.339 --> 00:16:50.540
but I wanna give you two tips in our closing time

00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:53.140
this evening that I believe will help us

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:58.140
to walk in humility on a regular basis, continuously.

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:01.160
I believe it's possible for us, as God's people,

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:03.100
to walk in humility.

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:06.500
I do believe that it's possible that we can fulfill

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:10.820
what God has told us to do, that we would humble ourselves

00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:12.760
under the mighty hand of God, that we would,

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:16.140
as Peter says it this way, that we would be clothed

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:17.500
with humility.

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:19.000
I do believe it's possible.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.540
There are a number of things that we could give you

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:22.380
this evening.

00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:25.899
I've tried to boil it down to just two simple tips,

00:17:25.899 --> 00:17:28.899
and I hope that it would provoke for you

00:17:28.899 --> 00:17:33.720
thought this evening on how we could walk in humility.

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:38.619
Number one, we must maintain a proper view of our God.

00:17:39.899 --> 00:17:42.080
If we maintain a proper view of our God,

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:45.800
it will go a long way to helping us walk in humility.

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:50.800
We find that when Uzziah died, the Bible tells us of Isaiah,

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:56.640
and he saw God in his glory, high, holy, and lifted up.

00:17:57.619 --> 00:18:00.179
It is trained and filled the temple,

00:18:00.179 --> 00:18:02.779
is what we read in the book of Isaiah.

00:18:02.779 --> 00:18:05.420
We find that Isaiah is broken.

00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:09.059
He's seeing God in his rightful place, and it's amazing.

00:18:09.059 --> 00:18:10.679
It's interesting when you see the timing,

00:18:10.679 --> 00:18:13.880
because it says in the year that King Uzziah died,

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:15.940
this is what happens.

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:18.459
And we find this evening that if we would maintain

00:18:18.459 --> 00:18:20.459
a proper view of God, that we'd understand

00:18:20.459 --> 00:18:23.420
that he alone is God, that we'd understand this evening

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:26.679
that he is the creator, that he is the sustainer,

00:18:26.679 --> 00:18:30.160
that we would see him for who he truly is.

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:36.080
Notice in our text in Romans chapter 12,

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:39.500
it's very interesting to see in the text,

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:41.220
and we're not dealing with the spiritual gifts,

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:44.440
but we're dealing with this walking in humility,

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:48.039
but we find it's given to us in this portion of Scripture

00:18:48.039 --> 00:18:52.500
in the midst of, really at the beginning of the instruction

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:55.099
with regard to the spiritual gifts.

00:18:55.099 --> 00:18:57.660
But notice in verse number six, the Bible says,

00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:01.340
having then gifts differing according to the grace,

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:04.160
notice what it says, that is given to us.

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:06.500
Who gives it to us?

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:07.340
God.

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:11.080
So the gift that you have, or the gift that I have,

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:15.720
isn't because of us, it's because God gave it to us.

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:19.299
In fact, we read in each of the passages of Scripture

00:19:19.299 --> 00:19:21.539
that God speaks of spiritual gifts

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:23.140
here in Romans chapter 12,

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:25.140
we see it in 1 Corinthians chapter 12,

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:27.299
and we see it in 1 Peter chapter four,

00:19:27.299 --> 00:19:29.419
that in each passage of Scripture,

00:19:29.419 --> 00:19:31.859
God makes it abundantly clear

00:19:31.859 --> 00:19:35.119
that the spiritual gifts are given

00:19:35.119 --> 00:19:38.820
to God's people by God himself.

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:40.859
The Spirit, the Holy Spirit of God,

00:19:40.859 --> 00:19:45.419
giveth to every man severally as he will,

00:19:45.419 --> 00:19:47.500
according to 1 Corinthians chapter 12.

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:49.900
We find that in verse number seven of 1 Corinthians 12,

00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:51.700
it says that it's given to every man.

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:54.080
We find that in 1 Peter chapter number four,

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:56.119
it speaks about that we have received,

00:19:56.119 --> 00:20:01.119
as every man hath received the gift, even as he receiveth.

00:20:01.119 --> 00:20:07.279
so let him minister." Who did we receive it from? We received it from God. We received it from God.

00:20:08.079 --> 00:20:14.799
And so when I have a proper understanding of spiritual gifts, it will help me to walk in

00:20:14.799 --> 00:20:22.239
humility when I have that proper view of who God is, that I see Him in His glory, that I see Him

00:20:22.239 --> 00:20:30.559
high, holy, and lifted up, that I understand that He alone is God and that the reality is this,

00:20:30.559 --> 00:20:40.159
He is God without me and He's God without you. He's God without us, but we are nothing without

00:20:40.159 --> 00:20:49.519
Him. He's God without us, but we are nothing without Him. And we find this evening that if

00:20:49.519 --> 00:20:57.199
we would maintain a proper view of God, that we would regularly understand that every, every good

00:20:57.199 --> 00:21:05.119
gift, not most of them, but every one of them, cometh down from above, right? We read it in

00:21:05.119 --> 00:21:11.599
James, and we understand the truth that God gives us, and He's helping us to understand that He

00:21:11.599 --> 00:21:18.959
is a good God and that He gives us every good and every perfect gift is from above.

00:21:19.519 --> 00:21:23.839
And cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow

00:21:23.839 --> 00:21:30.479
of turning. We find that the Bible tells us there are those that walk in pride and they have

00:21:30.479 --> 00:21:39.039
this view, just as Uzziah had this idea of he was becoming famous, his name was spread abroad,

00:21:39.039 --> 00:21:43.999
and he was marvelously helped till he was strong, and all of a sudden it started to look at, hey,

00:21:43.999 --> 00:21:51.919
look at what we've done around here. And he gets a little prideful. Nebuchadnezzar, look at all that

00:21:51.919 --> 00:22:00.959
I have done. Deuteronomy 8 and verse 18 admonishes us to remember that it is God who gives us the

00:22:00.959 --> 00:22:06.399
power to get wealth. We live in a society today that a lot of people that are prideful over their

00:22:06.399 --> 00:22:14.959
position, they're prideful over their possessions and what have you, and the reality is that God is

00:22:15.039 --> 00:22:22.639
the one that allows us to have the power to get anything. See, we have to have that proper view

00:22:22.639 --> 00:22:28.959
of God. When our view of God is out of balance, then all of a sudden it impacts how we view

00:22:28.959 --> 00:22:35.679
ourself. But when my view of God is proper, when my view of God is what it is supposed to be,

00:22:35.679 --> 00:22:40.559
then what's going to happen is, number two, I'm going to maintain a proper view of myself.

00:22:40.559 --> 00:22:44.479
So we must first maintain a proper view of our God, but number two, maintain a proper view of

00:22:44.479 --> 00:22:50.399
ourselves. It is important that we understand this evening that, yes, it starts with that proper view

00:22:50.399 --> 00:22:56.879
of who God is, and then that leads to us having a proper view of ourselves. There are many times,

00:22:56.879 --> 00:23:02.399
and we could speak of it, and there are people that use this terminology that Paul was the

00:23:02.399 --> 00:23:07.759
greatest Christian that ever lived. Paul didn't think that way. You know what Paul said of himself?

00:23:07.759 --> 00:23:16.000
That he was the chief chiefest of sinners. Paul was a man that I believe, as you study the

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:23.279
scriptures, walked in humility. And we find that as you look even in our text in Romans chapter 12

00:23:23.279 --> 00:23:30.639
and verse number three, notice as Paul is going to begin giving this charge, this admonition to these

00:23:30.639 --> 00:23:35.279
brethren and to give them the instruction with regard to the spiritual gifts, but he says,

00:23:35.279 --> 00:23:39.519
listen, you're not to think of yourselves more highly than you ought to think. You're to walk

00:23:39.519 --> 00:23:44.479
in humility, be humble, don't allow this to cause you to be prideful, think soberly, but I want you

00:23:44.479 --> 00:23:49.759
to notice in Romans 12 and verse 3, notice the way he begins the verse, for I say, notice,

00:23:50.479 --> 00:23:58.479
through the grace given unto me. You know, I think that Paul never got over the fact

00:23:59.279 --> 00:24:06.319
that he was saved by the grace of God. I don't think the journey on the road to Damascus ever

00:24:07.679 --> 00:24:18.559
kind of left Paul's mind. Paul regularly rehearses his conversion. He regularly shares with those

00:24:18.559 --> 00:24:23.919
that he's ministering to how he was on that road and how the bright light shone and all that took

00:24:23.919 --> 00:24:29.679
place, and Paul never got over the fact that God saved him. Paul never got over the fact that if

00:24:29.679 --> 00:24:35.600
God had not saved him, he would go to a Christless eternity to the lake of fire. He never got over

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:41.279
that, and he understood who God was, and he understood who he was in a proper view of himself,

00:24:41.279 --> 00:24:46.959
and we find that he says that the grace that was given unto me, listen, the grace is going to be

00:24:46.959 --> 00:24:52.959
given to you as well. We read it in verse number six, having then gifts differing according to

00:24:52.959 --> 00:24:59.279
the grace that is given to us. Paul had a certain position, but even think about what he said to the

00:24:59.279 --> 00:25:04.559
believers in Corinth in 1 Corinthians chapter 3, in the midst of all of the divisions and all of the

00:25:04.559 --> 00:25:09.119
carnality and all that was taking place, and there's a group of people saying, I'm of Paul,

00:25:09.119 --> 00:25:14.880
and I'm of Apollos, and I'm of Cephas, and by the way, if that happens in some arenas today,

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:18.880
in some circles today, there's some people saying, that's right, those are the ones that I was

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:25.199
responsible for leading to Christ, that's right, that's my Christ. No, no, Paul says, who is Paul?

00:25:27.199 --> 00:25:32.239
Who's Apollos? You know what we are? We're just ministers.

00:25:34.239 --> 00:25:40.320
God uses some of us to plant, God uses some of us to water, but God's the one that gives the

00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:46.720
increase, and God's, listen, God allows us, I love the way that he says it in 1 Corinthians 3,

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:55.119
in verse number 9, we are laborers together, it doesn't say for God, it says with God.

00:25:56.320 --> 00:26:06.720
We are laborers together with God. I'm nothing without him, but God allows us to be a laborer of

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:13.519
his, and we allow, that would help us as we have that proper view of God, we have that proper view

00:26:13.519 --> 00:26:20.720
of ourselves, that we recognize that God has given to me the grace, and God has allowed me

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:26.479
to serve him, to be a laborer together with him. What a blessing, what a privilege.

00:26:27.839 --> 00:26:35.359
Paul says this in 1 Corinthians chapter 15. Again, a verse of scripture that we regularly

00:26:36.079 --> 00:26:43.760
hear or refer to, and Paul says, the beginning of the verse,

00:26:45.119 --> 00:26:54.160
but by the grace of God, I am what I am. And his grace, it's not my grace, it's his grace,

00:26:54.160 --> 00:27:02.479
he's the source of grace, which was bestowed upon me was not in vain, but I labored more abundantly

00:27:02.479 --> 00:27:10.079
than they all, yet not I, but the grace of God, which was with me. What a perspective that Paul

00:27:10.079 --> 00:27:18.239
had. How was he able to walk in humility? How was he able to be used of God? So often, we look at

00:27:18.239 --> 00:27:23.040
the life of the apostle Paul and say, look at how God used Paul. That's because Paul was usable.

00:27:25.119 --> 00:27:31.679
It's because Paul walked in humility. God wasn't resisting Paul, because Paul wasn't prideful.

00:27:33.119 --> 00:27:39.199
God was using Paul, and God will use us as well if we walk in humility,

00:27:40.479 --> 00:27:47.679
acknowledging that our flesh has a desire. Listen, we must never get to the place where we think, nah,

00:27:48.799 --> 00:27:55.679
I don't have any. Your flesh desires to glory. You let people talk enough of good about you,

00:27:55.679 --> 00:27:58.239
and all of a sudden, you start thinking real good about yourself.

00:28:02.399 --> 00:28:11.440
The danger of pride leads to contention, destruction. God resists. We see this truth,

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:17.519
these two tips, we must maintain a proper view of God, a proper view of ourselves. I want to

00:28:17.519 --> 00:28:22.799
finish with 2 Corinthians chapter 12. I mentioned in the beginning the first part of that verse,

00:28:22.799 --> 00:28:31.359
and I told you that we'd turn there. So often in referencing 2 Corinthians chapter 12, our minds

00:28:31.359 --> 00:28:38.559
race to verse number 9, when God says, my grace is sufficient for thee. And oh, what a precious

00:28:38.559 --> 00:28:45.279
promise that is. What a great response that God gives to his servant Paul when he besought the

00:28:45.279 --> 00:28:50.799
Lord thrice for this thing, that it might depart from him. And God says, my grace is sufficient for

00:28:50.799 --> 00:28:56.559
thee. It's great truth. I'm so thankful. But I want to back up into the text of Scripture and deal

00:28:56.559 --> 00:29:02.320
with the subject of pride and humility, which is before us this evening. And I want you to notice

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:07.919
in verse number 1, it says, it is not expedient for me, doubtless to glory, I will come to visions

00:29:07.919 --> 00:29:14.239
and revelations of the Lord. I knew a man in Christ about 14 years ago, whether in the body

00:29:14.239 --> 00:29:19.119
I cannot tell or whether out of the body I cannot tell, God knoweth, such in one caught up to the

00:29:19.119 --> 00:29:25.039
third heaven. And I knew such a man, whether in the body or out of the body, I cannot tell, God

00:29:25.039 --> 00:29:32.320
knoweth, how that he was caught up into paradise and heard unspeakable words, which is not lawful

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:36.719
for a man to utter. By the way, it's a great text of Scripture for people that tell you they went to

00:29:36.719 --> 00:29:41.760
heaven and got a message for you. If Paul couldn't give us a message after he was caught up into the

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:47.760
third heaven, I don't think anyone else is either. Amen? Just a side thought. Verse number 5,

00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:53.279
of such in one will I glory. I'm not going to glory myself. No, I'm going to glory in him,

00:29:53.279 --> 00:29:58.320
yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine infirmities, for though I would desire to glory,

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:00.960
I shall not be a fool.

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:08.320
Notice, for I will say the truth, but now I forbear.

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:18.960
Notice the last part of verse 6, it's so important, lest any man should think of me above that

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:26.300
which he seeth me to be, or that he heareth of me.

00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:32.340
When I look at the end of verse number 6, in 2 Corinthians chapter 12, it brings great

00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:33.340
conviction.

00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:34.340
Why?

00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:35.340
Why?

00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:40.940
Paul is not, he's taking this thing of humility to a completely different level.

00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:46.380
Paul's saying, I'm not going to glory, but I don't want other people to think more highly

00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:48.580
of me either.

00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:50.620
Now think about that.

00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:54.420
Sometimes we say, well I didn't say it about myself, but man, they can just throw it all

00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:56.540
on, and I just, yeah man, it's wonderful.

00:30:56.540 --> 00:31:02.860
And we take glory in hearing what they, Paul says, no, no, no, now I forbear, lest any

00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:11.620
man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be, or that he heareth of me.

00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:17.540
Paul didn't want people, I believe, as I mentioned a moment ago, sometimes we hear people say,

00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:20.580
Paul is the greatest Christian that ever walked upon the face of the earth.

00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:24.300
I think Paul would cringe at hearing those words.

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:25.900
I'm being honest with you.

00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:31.540
He did not want other people to think too highly of him.

00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:36.540
We find this evening that Paul takes this thing of humility to a different level in

00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:43.020
2 Corinthians chapter 12, a level by which revealing to me the means by which God was

00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:47.740
able to use him in such a powerful way.

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:52.940
Paul was just a man that God was using.

00:31:52.940 --> 00:32:00.220
Paul understands, just as we should understand this evening, the truth of John 15, when Jesus

00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:05.140
said, I am the vine, ye are the branches.

00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:08.620
Without me, how many things can we do?

00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:09.620
Nothing.

00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:12.420
It's what the text of Scripture says.

00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:21.220
There's a lot of times that we think more highly of ourselves than we ought.

00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:26.980
And we find this evening that Paul, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:33.300
as he's going to give this teaching about spiritual gifts, he says, now listen, I want

00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:39.020
you to understand that as I give this teaching, as I give this truth, that I say to every

00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:45.540
man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think.

00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:46.740
Amen.

00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:49.460
Let's not think more highly of ourselves than we ought to think.

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:54.100
But let's not also allow other people to think more highly of us than they ought to

00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:57.340
think.

00:32:57.340 --> 00:33:06.300
In taking some measure of enjoyment, satisfaction, there's some level of pride, one step removed,

00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:11.460
if you will, because I wasn't saying it about myself, but I…Paul says, I don't want people

00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:16.140
to think more highly of me than they ought, but to think soberly.

00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:19.820
See God has been so good to us.

00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:26.820
I said it a moment ago, I'll say it again, God is God without me and without you.

00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:28.260
Would you agree with that?

00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:30.180
He's God.

00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:32.080
He doesn't need you.

00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:33.940
I'm so thankful He loves you.

00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:35.980
I'm so thankful He loves me.

00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:38.340
He doesn't need me, but He loves me.

00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:41.700
He doesn't need me, but He extended His grace to me.

00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:44.820
He doesn't need me, but He saved me.

00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:47.060
And then He would allow me to serve Him.

00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:52.980
It's absolutely amazing God's love.

00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:55.700
See God is God without me.

00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:59.040
I've only walked upon this face of this earth for a little over 44 years.

00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:02.140
God was God well before I was around.

00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:07.620
Even though God knew I would be born, He was God.

00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:14.740
But understand this evening that without Him, we are nothing.

00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:23.820
And if we can maintain that perspective, it'll go a long way to enabling us to walk in humility,

00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:26.220
to walk humbly with our God.

00:34:26.220 --> 00:34:27.220
Let's pray together.

00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:28.220
Father, we love you.

00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:29.380
We thank you for loving us.

00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:35.820
We thank you for this charge, this admonition that we find here in Romans 12 as we're dealing

00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:40.900
with this little series here on Wednesday nights of doing what we ought to do.

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:47.340
God, I pray that you'd help us to walk in humility.

00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:56.660
Help us, Lord, to understand that you resist the proud, but give grace to the humble.

00:34:56.660 --> 00:34:59.860
God, I don't want you to resist me.

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:05.620
God, my flesh is just like the flesh of anyone else.

00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:10.140
Any example that we've used this evening or anyone else seated here tonight, and our

00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:19.420
flesh desires to glory, God, I pray that you'd help me, help us to maintain a proper view

00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:23.580
of who you are and who we are.

00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:24.860
Help us to abide in you.

00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:29.460
Help us, Lord, to live and walk in humility.

00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:30.460
Bless our time of prayer.

00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:32.900
I pray, God, that you'd be exalted.

00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:34.900
We thank you that you hear and answer prayer.

00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:40.660
We thank you that you're able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think.

00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:43.660
I pray that you'd be honored and glorified, and we'll thank you for it in Christ's name

00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:44.660
we pray.

00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:45.660
Amen.

00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:46.940
Does anyone need a prayer bulletin this evening?

00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:48.740
You didn't get one on your way in tonight?
