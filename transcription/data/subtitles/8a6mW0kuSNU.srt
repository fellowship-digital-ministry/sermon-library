1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,599
Verses 7 through 10 is a familiar passage of Scripture

2
00:00:02,599 --> 00:00:04,639
to many of God's people.

3
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:07,800
In fact, it's one that perhaps you've heard someone

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,000
preach on, you've heard somebody reference

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,020
the portion of Scripture.

6
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:16,020
Maybe you have even memorized part of this passage

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,120
that I'm gonna preach this morning.

8
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,399
I believe this morning that the truth

9
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:23,120
that is contained within this passage

10
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:28,120
is a truth that it's imperative that every child of God

11
00:00:28,799 --> 00:00:33,319
truly understands and grasps this truth.

12
00:00:33,319 --> 00:00:35,799
We notice in verse number seven,

13
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:38,520
I'm actually gonna back up and look at verse number six,

14
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,720
five, sorry, in verse number five,

15
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,240
notice what Paul says.

16
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,639
He says, of such in one will I glory,

17
00:00:45,639 --> 00:00:49,159
yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine infirmities.

18
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:51,979
For though I would desire to glory, I should not be a fool.

19
00:00:51,979 --> 00:00:54,279
For I will say the truth, but now I forbear,

20
00:00:54,279 --> 00:00:56,119
lest any man should think of me

21
00:00:56,119 --> 00:00:57,880
above that which he seeth me to be,

22
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,419
or that he heareth of me.

23
00:00:59,419 --> 00:01:01,240
So in the first six verses,

24
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,959
I only read the last couple of them,

25
00:01:02,959 --> 00:01:04,879
verse five and six, we find that Paul

26
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,680
is referencing some visions, according to verse number one,

27
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,720
that he, visions and revelations

28
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,839
that are received of the Lord.

29
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:14,440
But it wasn't only glory in those things,

30
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:18,199
but we find that Paul was privileged to see

31
00:01:18,199 --> 00:01:20,919
and to have those visions and revelations.

32
00:01:20,919 --> 00:01:23,980
He also mentions in the text of Scripture

33
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:28,699
that he was not able, it was unlawful for him to speak

34
00:01:28,699 --> 00:01:30,620
or to utter these things.

35
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:33,940
And many times I've heard people through the years say,

36
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:36,980
someone had this vision or someone had this experience.

37
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:39,819
And I've often replied back to them and said this,

38
00:01:39,819 --> 00:01:42,419
if Paul wasn't permitted to talk about the visions

39
00:01:42,419 --> 00:01:44,540
and revelations that he received,

40
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,660
I'm not listening to the vision or revelation

41
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,580
that you think you received,

42
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:51,500
because the Bible also tells us in this very book

43
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,819
that the devil, the enemy,

44
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:57,500
he transforms himself into an angel of light.

45
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,260
And so we must be careful, we must understand the truth

46
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,819
of 1 John to try the spirits.

47
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:05,720
But notice, with understanding all these revelations

48
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,440
and visions that Paul received,

49
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,820
he starts in verse seven and says,

50
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:13,100
and lest I should be exalted above measure

51
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,699
through the abundance of the revelations,

52
00:02:15,699 --> 00:02:20,699
notice, there was given to me a thorn

53
00:02:21,339 --> 00:02:22,660
in the flesh.

54
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,660
Now, this isn't really part of the message

55
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,419
or the bulk of the message this morning,

56
00:02:26,419 --> 00:02:28,500
but I want you to consider what Paul says

57
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,339
in verse number seven.

58
00:02:29,339 --> 00:02:34,339
He says, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh.

59
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:38,979
I want you to acknowledge that Paul recognized this morning

60
00:02:38,979 --> 00:02:41,699
that this thorn in the flesh that he references,

61
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:43,539
it was given to him.

62
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:46,080
It was on purpose, it had a purpose,

63
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,259
it was given to him by God.

64
00:02:48,259 --> 00:02:49,660
And Paul recognized that.

65
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:52,619
Listen, nothing in your life happens by accident.

66
00:02:52,619 --> 00:02:54,940
Nothing in my life happens by accident.

67
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:58,419
We find that God is in control of all things.

68
00:02:58,419 --> 00:03:03,419
We find that God was giving to Paul this thorn in the flesh.

69
00:03:04,539 --> 00:03:07,380
Notice it says, the messenger of Satan to buffet me,

70
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,899
lest I should be exalted above measure.

71
00:03:09,899 --> 00:03:12,259
Now notice in verse eight, for this thing,

72
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:14,139
for what thing, this thorn in the flesh,

73
00:03:14,139 --> 00:03:18,179
I besought the Lord thrice that it might depart from me.

74
00:03:18,179 --> 00:03:21,220
So Paul prayed on three different occasions,

75
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:25,460
specifically prayed that this would be removed,

76
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:29,860
that he says that it might be depart from me,

77
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,220
that it might depart from me.

78
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,139
Have you ever had a situation,

79
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:37,300
you pray and you ask God that it would depart from you?

80
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,940
Come on, we pray, God,

81
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,979
would you help this thing depart from me, right?

82
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:42,220
I don't wanna deal with this thing.

83
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,820
I don't wanna deal with this infirmity.

84
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,160
I don't wanna have this issue.

85
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,500
I don't wanna have this problem.

86
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,619
I don't want this heartache.

87
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,339
I don't want this obstacle.

88
00:03:49,339 --> 00:03:50,619
Are you with me this morning?

89
00:03:50,619 --> 00:03:53,380
You pray that God would remove it.

90
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:56,940
By the way, aren't you thankful that God can remove it?

91
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,740
Amen, you pray that he would remove it

92
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:03,820
because you know that he has the power to do so.

93
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,460
But we find this morning that sometimes

94
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,460
as we look at our text this morning,

95
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:11,059
it is not always within the will of God

96
00:04:11,059 --> 00:04:14,660
that he will remove from your life or my life,

97
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:18,720
what we desire for him to remove from our lives.

98
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,779
Now, it doesn't mean that he cannot.

99
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:23,720
It simply means that it's not within his will.

100
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,480
It means that he has a greater purpose in that thing

101
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,200
than maybe we understand or recognize

102
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,399
at the particular moment.

103
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:34,320
We can look through the gospel records.

104
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,160
We can see as the Lord Jesus Christ is walking

105
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,700
upon the face of the earth in his earthly ministry,

106
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:43,040
and we can see many times in which God healed

107
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,320
and God performed miracles,

108
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,820
but we find that there were certain times

109
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:51,959
in which God led his people directly into difficulty

110
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:56,959
to prove himself and to increase their faith.

111
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:59,260
And this morning, we find that Paul,

112
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,959
because he understood the power of God,

113
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:04,959
because he experienced the work of God in his life,

114
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:09,079
he prays that God would remove this thing from his life,

115
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:10,399
this thorn in the flesh.

116
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:12,160
He says, I besought the Lord.

117
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,720
Listen, this is earnest prayer.

118
00:05:16,239 --> 00:05:18,559
This wasn't just a passing, Lord, would you?

119
00:05:18,559 --> 00:05:23,299
No, he's earnestly seeking, he's beseeching the Lord

120
00:05:23,299 --> 00:05:24,820
that it might depart from me.

121
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,239
And I want you to notice in verse number nine,

122
00:05:28,239 --> 00:05:33,239
and he, that's God, said unto me, that's Paul,

123
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,119
my grace is sufficient for thee,

124
00:05:38,119 --> 00:05:42,040
for my strength is made perfect in weakness.

125
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,640
Most gladly, therefore, will I rather glory

126
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,279
in my infirmities that the power of Christ

127
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:49,200
may rest upon me.

128
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,720
Therefore, I take pleasure in infirmities

129
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,720
and reproaches and necessities and persecutions

130
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,720
and distresses for Christ's sake,

131
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,040
for when I am weak, then am I strong.

132
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,519
This morning, if you're taking notes,

133
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:07,119
I want you to notice number one, the promise explained.

134
00:06:07,119 --> 00:06:10,200
The promise explained in verse number nine.

135
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:15,119
We find that God replies, responds to the request of Paul,

136
00:06:15,119 --> 00:06:16,559
according to verse number eight,

137
00:06:16,559 --> 00:06:19,440
that he would remove this thing from his life,

138
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,880
and God's response is given to us in verse number nine,

139
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,320
and there are two elements to this promise

140
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,880
that are explained to us,

141
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,559
and I want you to notice number one.

142
00:06:28,559 --> 00:06:31,320
It's very simple truth, but it says, number one,

143
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,799
my grace is sufficient for thee.

144
00:06:35,799 --> 00:06:38,859
I'm thankful this morning to know the grace of God.

145
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,019
I'm thankful this morning

146
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:42,500
to have experienced the grace of God.

147
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,059
We sang about God's grace this morning,

148
00:06:45,059 --> 00:06:47,299
wonderful grace of Jesus.

149
00:06:47,299 --> 00:06:50,500
Listen, you're saved by grace, amen?

150
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,739
For by grace are you saved through faith.

151
00:06:52,739 --> 00:06:54,739
And Ephesians two and verse number eight,

152
00:06:54,739 --> 00:06:56,380
we understand that truth,

153
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:59,779
and we find that God is a gracious God.

154
00:06:59,779 --> 00:07:02,859
He reveals to us throughout the pages of scripture.

155
00:07:02,859 --> 00:07:05,140
Remember all the way back in Genesis,

156
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:08,559
the Bible says that Noah found grace

157
00:07:08,559 --> 00:07:09,980
in the eyes of the Lord.

158
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,200
I'm thankful that our God is a gracious God.

159
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,899
Yes, he's merciful and he's holy

160
00:07:13,899 --> 00:07:15,779
in all of the attributes of God,

161
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:17,720
but this morning, just for a moment,

162
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,739
we're gonna focus our attention

163
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:22,899
upon this truth of God's grace,

164
00:07:22,899 --> 00:07:26,179
and he has a limitless supply of grace.

165
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:28,779
I mean, he's not restricted

166
00:07:28,779 --> 00:07:31,700
by too many people needing grace.

167
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,579
No, he is gracious.

168
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:37,500
His grace will never be exhausted in your life

169
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,160
or in my life or in our lives collectively.

170
00:07:42,059 --> 00:07:45,380
He says, my grace, my grace.

171
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,820
Have you ever tried to be gracious with someone?

172
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:51,059
And you try to be gracious with someone,

173
00:07:51,059 --> 00:07:52,820
you try to be gracious with someone,

174
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,140
and you say, my grace is kind of running out.

175
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,260
Have you ever been there?

176
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,579
You ever feel that way?

177
00:07:57,579 --> 00:08:00,140
You say, I know I'm supposed to be gracious, right?

178
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,779
Speak, we're supposed to speak,

179
00:08:01,779 --> 00:08:03,619
our speech is supposed to be with grace, right?

180
00:08:03,619 --> 00:08:06,660
How many times our speech hasn't been with grace, right?

181
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,619
We say, my grace is being exhausted here.

182
00:08:08,619 --> 00:08:13,380
You're testing me, you're pushing me to my limits.

183
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,220
And some of you are like, man,

184
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,220
I was there this morning, amen?

185
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:21,220
But you understand, listen, God's grace is sufficient.

186
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:25,059
God's grace is limitless.

187
00:08:25,059 --> 00:08:28,579
There's no exhausting the grace of God,

188
00:08:28,579 --> 00:08:31,739
and here we find that God says to Paul,

189
00:08:31,739 --> 00:08:36,299
my grace is sufficient for thee.

190
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:41,859
And I find in this truth of God's grace being amazing,

191
00:08:41,859 --> 00:08:44,460
and certainly it is, and we sing amazing grace,

192
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:47,539
how sweet the sound.

193
00:08:47,539 --> 00:08:50,940
We speak about God's grace being abundant.

194
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:55,179
We see that as Paul testifies of his own personal conversion

195
00:08:55,179 --> 00:08:57,299
as he's speaking to Timothy in 1 Timothy,

196
00:08:57,299 --> 00:09:01,820
and he talks about God's grace being abundant in his life.

197
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,619
And here we find that as Paul is writing

198
00:09:04,619 --> 00:09:06,380
to this church in Corinth

199
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:09,900
and he's rehearsing his own personal experience,

200
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:13,099
this promise is being explained

201
00:09:13,099 --> 00:09:18,099
that my grace, God says, is sufficient for thee.

202
00:09:18,119 --> 00:09:21,219
But God, I'm suffering with this thorn in the flesh.

203
00:09:21,219 --> 00:09:24,780
God, this thorn in the flesh is hindering my ability

204
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:27,659
from a human perspective of what I could accomplish

205
00:09:27,659 --> 00:09:28,900
and so on and so forth.

206
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,099
And God, I think it'd be so much better

207
00:09:31,099 --> 00:09:33,140
if I didn't have this thorn in the flesh.

208
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:38,140
And God says, my grace is sufficient for thee.

209
00:09:39,059 --> 00:09:41,539
Notice the second element of the promise

210
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:44,340
as we look at this truth of the promise explained.

211
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,520
We find that the second element,

212
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,020
Jesus says not only is my grace,

213
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:51,099
my grace is sufficient for thee,

214
00:09:51,099 --> 00:09:56,099
but he says my strength is made perfect in weakness.

215
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,099
Whose strength?

216
00:09:58,099 --> 00:09:59,039
Well, God's strength.

217
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,539
How much strength does he have?

218
00:10:00,539 --> 00:10:04,139
all power, all authority. He is the omnipotent God. He

219
00:10:04,179 --> 00:10:06,979
rules and He reigns. He said, let there be light, and

220
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:10,279
there was light. He spoke and it was done. We find that He

221
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:13,919
has all power. Brother Jeff this morning referenced one

222
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:16,359
of the miracles as he was dealing with the life of

223
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,119
Gideon there of the impotent man at the pool of Bethesda.

224
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:24,459
And that impotent man met the omnipotent God, the One who

225
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:28,339
has all power. That man had no power, but God has all

226
00:10:28,939 --> 00:10:33,939
power. And He says, my strength is made perfect in

227
00:10:33,979 --> 00:10:38,819
weakness. Now here's the thing. We don't like to be

228
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:45,859
weak. We feel vulnerable. We don't like to be weak. We

229
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:51,319
like, we like to have it figured out. Can you relate?

230
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,159
We want to, we want to have the answers we're going to

231
00:10:53,199 --> 00:10:56,899
be able to do. But, but here we find that, that Christ

232
00:10:56,919 --> 00:11:01,859
is giving a, a truth to Paul, but not just to Paul, to us

233
00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:04,699
as well as it's preserved in His Word. And it's a promise

234
00:11:04,739 --> 00:11:09,979
that is being explained that God's strength is made

235
00:11:09,999 --> 00:11:13,399
perfect in weakness. I want you to go back to 1

236
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:16,119
Corinthians chapter 1 just for a moment. And I want you

237
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:18,919
to look, Paul had previously written to this church in

238
00:11:18,939 --> 00:11:22,619
the, the first letter of 1 Corinthians as he sends this

239
00:11:22,659 --> 00:11:26,319
letter to them. But I want you to consider with me some

240
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:30,439
of what God says here in the first chapter as Paul is

241
00:11:30,479 --> 00:11:33,019
speaking to this church. And we know it's a carnal

242
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:35,819
church. And there's definitely been some growth as

243
00:11:35,859 --> 00:11:37,779
you look at 2 Corinthians. And we'll deal with that

244
00:11:37,819 --> 00:11:40,699
throughout the year. But notice in verse number 23,

245
00:11:40,719 --> 00:11:44,859
but we preach Christ crucified unto the Jews a

246
00:11:44,899 --> 00:11:47,359
stumbling block and unto the Greeks foolishness. But unto

247
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:50,399
them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the

248
00:11:50,439 --> 00:11:54,939
power of God and the wisdom of God. Notice this, because

249
00:11:54,959 --> 00:12:00,799
the foolishness of God is wiser than men. The weakness

250
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:05,339
of God is stronger than men. For ye see your calling,

251
00:12:05,379 --> 00:12:07,979
brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not

252
00:12:07,999 --> 00:12:10,879
many mighty, not many noble, are called. But God hath

253
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:13,379
chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the

254
00:12:13,419 --> 00:12:16,679
wise. God hath chosen the weak things of the world to

255
00:12:16,719 --> 00:12:20,219
confound the things which are mighty. And base things of

256
00:12:20,259 --> 00:12:23,119
the world and things which are despised hath God chosen,

257
00:12:23,139 --> 00:12:25,979
yea, and things which are not to bring to naught things

258
00:12:26,019 --> 00:12:31,679
that are why, that no flesh should glory in His presence.

259
00:12:31,719 --> 00:12:35,919
Brother Jeff hasn't gotten there yet in the Sunday

260
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:38,319
school class with Gideon, but you know why the army got

261
00:12:38,359 --> 00:12:41,199
shrunk down to 300? Because he said, if I give you the

262
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:43,459
victory with the large number you're going to think you

263
00:12:43,499 --> 00:12:50,599
got the victory. That no flesh should glory in His

264
00:12:50,659 --> 00:12:53,959
presence. We acknowledge it's all because of the grace of

265
00:12:53,999 --> 00:12:57,499
God. In fact, Paul would say that, I am what I am by the

266
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:03,099
grace of God. We find that God's strength is made

267
00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:06,399
perfect in weakness. I'm reminded of what the Bible

268
00:13:06,439 --> 00:13:10,379
says in John chapter number 1. Turn over quickly if you

269
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,139
will to John chapter number 1 as we read this very

270
00:13:13,179 --> 00:13:17,479
important passage of Scripture dealing with the truth of

271
00:13:17,699 --> 00:13:21,199
the Incarnation and the eternality of the Lord Jesus

272
00:13:21,239 --> 00:13:24,799
Christ. In John chapter number 1 the Bible begins in

273
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:28,839
verse number 1, In the beginning was the Word, and

274
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:32,339
the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was

275
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:35,179
in the beginning with God. All things were made by Him.

276
00:13:35,219 --> 00:13:39,059
Without Him was not anything made that was made. In Him

277
00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:42,919
was life, and the life was the light of men. Isn't that

278
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,259
wonderful? I'm going to skip down to verse number 14. The

279
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:48,979
Bible says, And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among

280
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:51,979
us. Now the Word that's referenced in verses 1 and

281
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:55,919
following we find then referenced in verse 14. In the

282
00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:59,099
beginning was the Word, the Word was with God, and the

283
00:13:59,119 --> 00:14:02,199
Word was God. And then in verse 14, And the Word was

284
00:14:02,219 --> 00:14:06,959
made flesh. That's the Incarnation. And dwelt among

285
00:14:06,999 --> 00:14:11,799
us, and we beheld His glory. The glory is of the only

286
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,779
begotten of the Father. Notice what this says, Full of

287
00:14:14,859 --> 00:14:22,099
grace and truth. John bare witness of Him, and cried,

288
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:25,339
saying, This was He of whom I spake. He that cometh after

289
00:14:25,379 --> 00:14:29,139
me is preferred before me. Why? For He was before me the

290
00:14:29,179 --> 00:14:33,579
eternality of Christ. And of His fullness have all we

291
00:14:33,619 --> 00:14:38,019
received, and grace for grace. For the law was given by

292
00:14:38,059 --> 00:14:43,019
Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ. No man

293
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,999
hath seen God at any time. The only begotten Son, which is

294
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:50,439
in the bosom of the Father, He hath declared Him. He's full

295
00:14:50,479 --> 00:14:55,839
of grace. He's gracious. The promise is explained. I want

296
00:14:55,879 --> 00:14:58,519
you to notice, He says, My grace is sufficient for thee.

297
00:14:58,539 --> 00:15:03,819
And then He says, My strength is made perfect in weakness.

298
00:15:03,859 --> 00:15:07,219
Just for a moment in 2 Corinthians chapter 12 as we

299
00:15:07,259 --> 00:15:09,619
consider the promise being explained, I want you to

300
00:15:09,619 --> 00:15:13,859
notice that little word, is. That little word, is. My

301
00:15:13,899 --> 00:15:19,999
grace is sufficient for thee. My strength is made perfect

302
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:25,339
in weakness. The Bible does not say that My grace was

303
00:15:25,379 --> 00:15:28,819
sufficient for thee. The Bible does not say My grace will

304
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:32,079
be sufficient for thee. The Bible says My grace is

305
00:15:32,119 --> 00:15:37,619
sufficient for thee. Listen, I understand that sometimes we

306
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:42,499
can talk about the past. I understand sometimes we can

307
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:45,459
worry about the future. You say, oh pastor we don't worry.

308
00:15:45,499 --> 00:15:48,459
Come on, we know we do. I understand the Bible says be

309
00:15:48,499 --> 00:15:52,399
careful for nothing. But there are times in your life, there

310
00:15:52,439 --> 00:15:55,579
are times in my life that we're not perfect in obedience.

311
00:15:55,599 --> 00:15:58,539
Amen. There are times that we worry about things, and we

312
00:15:58,579 --> 00:16:02,719
talk about the past, and we worry about the future. But

313
00:16:02,779 --> 00:16:07,419
you know where we live? We live in the present. You can't

314
00:16:07,459 --> 00:16:11,619
live in the past, and you can't live in the future. All you

315
00:16:11,659 --> 00:16:14,759
can do is live in the present. So you know what God says? My

316
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:21,539
grace is sufficient for thee. He didn't say it was, or it

317
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:24,279
will be. He said it is. So you know what that means to me?

318
00:16:24,299 --> 00:16:26,899
That means to me, and it means to you this morning when this

319
00:16:26,939 --> 00:16:30,819
promise is explained, that today in my circumstance today,

320
00:16:30,819 --> 00:16:34,219
in my situation today, in the obstacle today, in the

321
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:40,259
infirmity, the difficulty, His grace is today sufficient for

322
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:45,559
me. And it's important that we understand that little word is.

323
00:16:45,599 --> 00:16:49,799
You say it's so little word, but it's so important. The

324
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:57,079
promise is being explained to us. God Almighty, the Creator

325
00:16:57,479 --> 00:17:01,039
of the universe, the One who formed you and me, the One who

326
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:04,079
knows our thoughts. He knows everything about us. He knows

327
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:07,179
the hairs on our head. He knows our thoughts. He knows our

328
00:17:07,219 --> 00:17:15,899
cares. He says my grace is sufficient for thee. And it's

329
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:20,059
so mightily important, it's imperative that we understand

330
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:24,439
this promise that's being explained to us this morning.

331
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,999
And it's something that Paul is receiving from the Lord.

332
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:32,679
He's receiving this word. He prayed. God said my grace is

333
00:17:32,699 --> 00:17:37,839
sufficient. My grace is sufficient. We see here in the

334
00:17:37,879 --> 00:17:40,379
text, not only the promise explained, but we see a

335
00:17:40,419 --> 00:17:43,879
response here of Paul that I believe is revealing an

336
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,579
exemplary. If you're taking notes, number two, consider

337
00:17:46,619 --> 00:17:50,219
this. Not only the promise explained, but number two, the

338
00:17:50,339 --> 00:17:55,579
promise embraced. The promise embraced. I'm thankful that

339
00:17:55,619 --> 00:17:58,579
God explains the promise to us. I'm thankful that God

340
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:02,119
recorded verse number nine in our Bible so that we could see

341
00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:05,959
the promise explained. That we could understand that when

342
00:18:05,999 --> 00:18:09,459
Paul said, has he besought the Lord thrice that it might

343
00:18:09,499 --> 00:18:12,099
depart from me, that the Bible doesn't just simply say that

344
00:18:12,139 --> 00:18:17,299
God said no. But that the answer was my grace is

345
00:18:17,419 --> 00:18:21,019
sufficient for thee, for my strength is made perfect in

346
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:24,959
weakness. But then we see this response. And we find the

347
00:18:24,999 --> 00:18:29,339
promise is understood as God explained this to Paul. And

348
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:32,499
the promise is explained, but now the promise is embraced.

349
00:18:32,539 --> 00:18:36,940
The word embraced means to seize eagerly. It means to lay

350
00:18:36,979 --> 00:18:41,380
hold on. I want you to understand this morning that

351
00:18:41,419 --> 00:18:47,179
this truth of 2 Corinthians chapter 12 is not something

352
00:18:47,199 --> 00:18:52,940
cliché for the Christian. It's not some cliché that the

353
00:18:52,979 --> 00:18:55,979
Christian is to use for marketing purposes or

354
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,179
advertisement. We find that there are many times in which

355
00:18:59,219 --> 00:19:02,579
even the thought, my grace is sufficient for thee, or as

356
00:19:02,619 --> 00:19:06,559
we've worded it, God's grace is sufficient for our theme for

357
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:09,219
this year. Listen, it's not just a cliché for marketing

358
00:19:09,259 --> 00:19:14,659
purposes. It is a Bible truth that God has given to us that

359
00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:20,659
must be embraced by us. See, the promises of God are

360
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:24,820
important. And we find that God has given us many promises.

361
00:19:24,859 --> 00:19:27,619
In fact, Peter would say that they're exceeding great and

362
00:19:27,659 --> 00:19:30,459
precious promises. But we find that in the beginning of this

363
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,899
book, 2 Corinthians, in chapter 1 and verse number 20, I want

364
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:36,799
you to notice what the Bible says. Because we find that

365
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:39,940
this promise is explained that we're dealing with, and then

366
00:19:39,979 --> 00:19:43,179
it's embraced. But notice what Paul says in 2 Corinthians

367
00:19:43,199 --> 00:19:48,139
chapter 1 and verse number 20, for all the promises of God in

368
00:19:48,179 --> 00:20:00,079
Him are yea, and in Him, amen, unto the glory of God by us.

369
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:01,119
Aren't you amazed?

370
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:03,839
you thankful? Listen, the Apostle Paul, the Lord was

371
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:06,479
revealing and giving him truth. We know all scripture

372
00:20:06,479 --> 00:20:09,999
is given by inspiration of God with regard to all the

373
00:20:09,999 --> 00:20:15,559
promises of God. In him are yea and in him amen. Listen,

374
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:19,439
our God cannot lie. Aren't you thankful for that? I mean,

375
00:20:19,439 --> 00:20:22,359
he can't lie. Every promise in the book is mine. Every

376
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:24,239
chapter, every verse, every line. That's what the

377
00:20:24,239 --> 00:20:27,279
songwriter said. And we look at the promise and listen,

378
00:20:27,399 --> 00:20:30,959
it's not just about an intellectual exercise of being

379
00:20:30,959 --> 00:20:34,039
able to know the promises to being able to rehearse the

380
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:37,559
promises to be able to recite the promises. No, it must

381
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:41,839
be that we embrace them personally, that we take the

382
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:46,239
promise that God has given in his word and not just

383
00:20:46,239 --> 00:20:49,479
memorize it, not just share it for someone else, but we

384
00:20:49,479 --> 00:20:55,359
embrace it personally. That we understand as we look at

385
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:58,759
this text of scripture that the Apostle Paul, he

386
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:03,399
embraced this promise. I mean, the almighty God gave

387
00:21:03,399 --> 00:21:07,799
him a promise and it's embraced. And I would submit

388
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:11,639
to you this morning that for each of us here, that we

389
00:21:11,639 --> 00:21:14,119
look at this passage of scripture and that we too

390
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:17,959
would embrace the promise that's been revealed, that we

391
00:21:17,959 --> 00:21:21,839
would understand that in every scenario of my life, in

392
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:24,959
every scenario of your life, in every situation that we

393
00:21:24,959 --> 00:21:29,959
face, that we claim embrace the promise of God, that

394
00:21:29,959 --> 00:21:33,759
God's grace is sufficient. You ever been in a place

395
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:36,639
where you say, I just don't think I could go on. I just

396
00:21:36,639 --> 00:21:38,839
don't think I could do this anymore. This is too much

397
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:42,839
for me. There are times that you feel that way. And by

398
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:45,999
the way, God knows our frame. Aren't you thankful for

399
00:21:45,999 --> 00:21:50,319
that? He knows that we're but dust. We have an enemy

400
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:56,159
that's relentless. David, at one point in his life, he

401
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:01,959
fled and went to Philistine territory because Saul and

402
00:22:01,959 --> 00:22:06,719
all that was taking place got to be too much for him.

403
00:22:06,719 --> 00:22:10,000
We have an enemy. There are times in your life and in my

404
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,279
life that we can take a wrong perspective and a wrong

405
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:16,119
approach and say, what's it worth? I just can't do this

406
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:22,679
anymore. I'm just ready to throw in the towel. No. I'm

407
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:24,839
going to continue. Why? Because God's grace is

408
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:28,799
sufficient. And I'm going to embrace that promise. Notice

409
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:33,319
in the text, we see how Paul embraced this promise.

410
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:36,879
Notice what he says. In verse 9, we see the promise. And

411
00:22:36,879 --> 00:22:39,959
he, speaking of God, said to me, speaking of Paul, my

412
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:43,440
grace is sufficient for thee. For my strength is made

413
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,360
perfect in weakness. And then notice what Paul says. This

414
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,959
is the embracing of the promise. He understood it. It

415
00:22:48,959 --> 00:22:53,679
was explained. He says, most gladly therefore, because of

416
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,559
this promise, because of understanding what God

417
00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:00,159
Almighty has just revealed to me, most gladly therefore,

418
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:07,199
will I rather glory in my infirmities. Why? That the

419
00:23:07,199 --> 00:23:12,639
power of Christ may rest upon me. We want the power of

420
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:18,479
God to rest upon you. We want God's power in my life. I

421
00:23:18,479 --> 00:23:23,080
want to be used for the glory of God. I want God to, as it

422
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:26,119
says here, that my strength is made perfect in weakness.

423
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:28,759
And Paul, dealing with this thorn in the flesh, and we

424
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:31,199
don't understand all that it was. There are many that

425
00:23:31,199 --> 00:23:34,559
have concluded and they've assumed that it has to do

426
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,399
with his eyesight. And I understand the reasons why

427
00:23:37,399 --> 00:23:39,559
they would reach the conclusion. But we don't know

428
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:43,479
with a hundred percent certainty. But I want you to

429
00:23:43,479 --> 00:23:46,879
understand this morning that Paul says, because God made

430
00:23:46,879 --> 00:23:51,039
this truth known to me, that His grace is sufficient and

431
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:54,000
that His strength is made perfect in my weakness, that

432
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,440
I'm going to, and he says, most gladly therefore, I'm

433
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,959
going to glory in my infirmities. Well, that's a

434
00:24:01,959 --> 00:24:12,039
different perspective, is it not? It's not natural to

435
00:24:12,039 --> 00:24:15,759
glory in your infirmities. It's not natural as a human

436
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:24,679
being to glory in your infirmities. To complain about

437
00:24:24,679 --> 00:24:28,079
your infirmities would be a natural response as a human

438
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:34,559
being. Am I not right? But Paul says, most gladly

439
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:39,440
therefore, most gladly therefore, will I rather glory

440
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:46,679
in my infirmities. Why? That the power of Christ may rest

441
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:52,760
upon me. Paul's embracing this promise. He's believing

442
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:57,559
God. He's saying, God told me as I sought Him that this

443
00:24:57,559 --> 00:25:00,359
thing would be sought Him, so that this thing would depart

444
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:03,679
from me, that God said, my grace is sufficient for Thee,

445
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:07,079
that my strength is made perfect in weakness. And so

446
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:11,639
Paul has this response. It's a response of embracing, to

447
00:25:11,639 --> 00:25:15,559
seize it eagerly, to lay hold on it, to apply it in his

448
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:19,160
life. And he says that he would glory in his infirmities.

449
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,959
Not only does he say that in verse 9, but we find in verse

450
00:25:21,959 --> 00:25:25,399
number 10, it says, therefore. We've used this little

451
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:28,359
phrase before. You've heard it, no doubt. Therefore, when

452
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:30,359
you see a therefore in the Bible, you find out what it's

453
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:33,479
therefore. And he says, therefore, because of this

454
00:25:33,479 --> 00:25:36,760
revealed truth, because of the promise that has been

455
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:42,440
explained, because of what I've understood that God has

456
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,799
communicated to me, not only did he say in verse 9, I will

457
00:25:45,799 --> 00:25:48,519
glory in my infirmities, but he says in verse 10, I take

458
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:52,519
pleasure, notice what he says, in infirmities, in

459
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:57,880
reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in

460
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:04,279
distresses, for Christ's sake. There are many things that

461
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:11,160
Paul suffered because he followed Jesus. He's not

462
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,639
speaking about things that he would suffer because of his

463
00:26:13,639 --> 00:26:17,479
own sin, because of his own wrongdoing. No, he's talking

464
00:26:17,479 --> 00:26:22,119
about the things that he would suffer for following Christ.

465
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:24,359
There are many times we could study through the book of

466
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:27,000
Acts, as we have in years past, where you find that the

467
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,440
apostle Paul, he faced these great levels of difficulty,

468
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:33,399
and distresses, and persecutions, simply because he

469
00:26:33,399 --> 00:26:38,040
was following Jesus and preaching the gospel. And so

470
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,679
when he's speaking about these things, he's speaking

471
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:44,040
about taking pleasure and understanding that God was

472
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:47,639
going to give him the strength, that God was going to

473
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:51,559
supernaturally, through his grace and through his power,

474
00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:55,959
he was going to enable Paul to carry forth and to do what

475
00:26:55,959 --> 00:27:01,799
God had called him to do. He says, for when I am weak,

476
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:09,959
then am I strong. For when I am weak, then am I strong.

477
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:15,799
We find that even, as you read the book of 1 and 2

478
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:19,000
Corinthians, there's truth revealed to us with regard to

479
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:25,160
really the perspective that many had of the appearance,

480
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:33,399
the stature of Paul. And we find that it was God's power

481
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:39,559
that was seen in him and through him. We find that Paul

482
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:43,639
is saying, I'm taking pleasure, I'm glorying in. Why?

483
00:27:43,639 --> 00:27:46,839
Because I understand this promise. It's a full embrace.

484
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:54,440
It's a full embrace. This morning, the testimony, as we

485
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:58,519
look here at this passage, is a testimony of an individual

486
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:02,600
who not only knew the promise of God, but he personally

487
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:07,399
embraced, most importantly embraced, the promise of God.

488
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:13,799
And this morning and throughout 2025, our theme will be

489
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:18,839
God's grace is sufficient. And can I tell you this morning

490
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:21,559
that we need to see it in our lives every day.

491
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:28,679
We live in the present and God says my grace is sufficient.

492
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:36,520
God's grace is sufficient. And it's by the grace of God,

493
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:42,119
this promise is one that must be embraced. How am I going to

494
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:45,320
do this? How am I going to? Listen, if God's called you to

495
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,760
do it, he'll empower you to do it. And his grace will enable

496
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:52,359
you because his grace is sufficient. You say, I can't do

497
00:28:52,359 --> 00:28:55,559
this. You're right, but God can do it through you if he's

498
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:59,640
called you to do it because his grace is sufficient.

499
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:06,520
And this morning and throughout 2025, I want us in our lives,

500
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:10,279
those of us that have been saved by the grace of God to

501
00:29:10,279 --> 00:29:15,159
experience daily that God's grace is sufficient and that we

502
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:19,719
would give God the glory for his grace in our lives every day

503
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:25,000
because God's grace is sufficient. And we begin to live

504
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:31,000
life every day with this thought in our minds, saturated in our

505
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:38,440
hearts that God's grace is sufficient. And we pause as we

506
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,960
face that obstacle, that difficulty, that opposition,

507
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,760
whatever it might be. We say, God, you said that your grace

508
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:48,599
was sufficient. God, I'm trusting you. I'm embracing the

509
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:53,000
promise that you gave because God, I need your grace this

510
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,440
morning. I need your grace. I need your grace in this moment.

511
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,839
And I understand that your grace, you're full of grace.

512
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:01,080
It's not going to be.

513
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:12,440
be exhausted. Your grace is sufficient. And I hope that as we go through 2025 that we

514
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:20,860
would experience the grace of God in a very definite, real way. That we would be able

515
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:26,500
to give the glory to God. See, when it's God's grace and when it's God's strength, it's God

516
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:34,300
who gets the glory. Amen? It's God alone who gets the glory. You know, Paul didn't want

517
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:40,180
other people to think more highly of him than they should. Why? Because he wanted God to

518
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:47,580
be glorified. Because he says, I am what I am by the grace of God. And this morning,

519
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:55,900
I don't know all that we'll face day by day, but you know what encourages me? God does.

520
00:30:55,900 --> 00:31:05,020
He knows. And what encourages me even greater is that he said my grace is sufficient. And

521
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:13,580
I want to challenge each and every one of us to not just have a promise explained, but

522
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:21,580
to have a promise embraced. God in my life, I want to see your grace. I want to experience

523
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:30,140
your grace. When I don't think I could, God's grace is sufficient. When that phone call

524
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:38,100
comes, when that whatever happens, God's grace is sufficient. Don't get so caught up in the

525
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:44,020
future. Don't get so caught up in the what ifs. Because in the moment that you need God's

526
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:52,540
grace, God's grace is sufficient. Don't let your mind say, well, I don't know what I would

527
00:31:52,540 --> 00:32:00,020
do if. I don't know how I could if. No, no. God said my grace is sufficient. You know

528
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:07,140
what you'll find? In the moment that you need it, God's grace is sufficient. Let's pray.

529
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:13,540
Father, we love you. How we thank you for loving us. God, I pray this morning that just

530
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:25,700
as Paul embraced this promise that was explained in response to his request that this thorn

531
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:31,500
in his flesh would depart from him. God, I pray this morning that you'd help us to understand,

532
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:39,340
but most importantly, help us to embrace this promise. God, I'm thankful this morning that

533
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:47,860
your grace is sufficient. I've experienced it and I give you the glory for it. I pray

534
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:56,500
that you'd help us throughout this next calendar year as we study through this book to remind

535
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:02,860
it regularly of your grace. Thank you for saving us. Lord, if there's one here that's

536
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:07,740
not been saved by the grace of God, they don't know for sure that if they were to die that

537
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:16,460
heaven is their home. Their greatest need at this moment is to be saved. To have their

538
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:21,100
sins forgiven, to know for sure that heaven is their home. And I pray that the Holy Spirit

539
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:27,940
of God would convict them and help them to understand that Jesus saves. And for my grace

540
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:31,940
are you saved through faith and not of yourselves. It's the gift of God, not of works, lest any

541
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:37,260
man should boast. And I pray that if there's one under the sound of my voice that needs

542
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:42,500
to be saved, that today would be the day of their salvation. Lord, I pray for those

543
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:49,220
that have been saved, that know you as personal Lord and Savior. They've been saved by grace.

544
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:59,780
In a room of any size of people, there are great needs, difficulties, infirmities, hardships.

545
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:08,420
Lord, I pray that you'd help us to embrace this promise, that your grace is sufficient.

546
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:14,860
Lord, that you would help us to experience your grace in our lives. Maybe the Holy Spirit

547
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:20,540
has touched a particular area in someone's life, or would you help us to be responsive

548
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:27,540
this morning, to be doers of the word and not hearers only. We pray that you alone would

549
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:31,780
be honored and glorified through every decision that would be made. For it's in Christ's name

550
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,260
we pray. Would you stand with me?
