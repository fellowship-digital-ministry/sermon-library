00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.599
Verses 7 through 10 is a familiar passage of Scripture

00:00:02.599 --> 00:00:04.639
to many of God's people.

00:00:04.639 --> 00:00:07.800
In fact, it's one that perhaps you've heard someone

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.000
preach on, you've heard somebody reference

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.020
the portion of Scripture.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:16.020
Maybe you have even memorized part of this passage

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.120
that I'm gonna preach this morning.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.399
I believe this morning that the truth

00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:23.120
that is contained within this passage

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:28.120
is a truth that it's imperative that every child of God

00:00:28.799 --> 00:00:33.319
truly understands and grasps this truth.

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:35.799
We notice in verse number seven,

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:38.520
I'm actually gonna back up and look at verse number six,

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.720
five, sorry, in verse number five,

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.240
notice what Paul says.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.639
He says, of such in one will I glory,

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:49.159
yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine infirmities.

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:51.979
For though I would desire to glory, I should not be a fool.

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:54.279
For I will say the truth, but now I forbear,

00:00:54.279 --> 00:00:56.119
lest any man should think of me

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:57.880
above that which he seeth me to be,

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.419
or that he heareth of me.

00:00:59.419 --> 00:01:01.240
So in the first six verses,

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.959
I only read the last couple of them,

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:04.879
verse five and six, we find that Paul

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.680
is referencing some visions, according to verse number one,

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.720
that he, visions and revelations

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.839
that are received of the Lord.

00:01:12.839 --> 00:01:14.440
But it wasn't only glory in those things,

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.199
but we find that Paul was privileged to see

00:01:18.199 --> 00:01:20.919
and to have those visions and revelations.

00:01:20.919 --> 00:01:23.980
He also mentions in the text of Scripture

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:28.699
that he was not able, it was unlawful for him to speak

00:01:28.699 --> 00:01:30.620
or to utter these things.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.940
And many times I've heard people through the years say,

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.980
someone had this vision or someone had this experience.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.819
And I've often replied back to them and said this,

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:42.419
if Paul wasn't permitted to talk about the visions

00:01:42.419 --> 00:01:44.540
and revelations that he received,

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.660
I'm not listening to the vision or revelation

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.580
that you think you received,

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.500
because the Bible also tells us in this very book

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.819
that the devil, the enemy,

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:57.500
he transforms himself into an angel of light.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.260
And so we must be careful, we must understand the truth

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.819
of 1 John to try the spirits.

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:05.720
But notice, with understanding all these revelations

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.440
and visions that Paul received,

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.820
he starts in verse seven and says,

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.100
and lest I should be exalted above measure

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.699
through the abundance of the revelations,

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:20.699
notice, there was given to me a thorn

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:22.660
in the flesh.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.660
Now, this isn't really part of the message

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.419
or the bulk of the message this morning,

00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:28.500
but I want you to consider what Paul says

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.339
in verse number seven.

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:34.339
He says, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh.

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.979
I want you to acknowledge that Paul recognized this morning

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:41.699
that this thorn in the flesh that he references,

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:43.539
it was given to him.

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:46.080
It was on purpose, it had a purpose,

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.259
it was given to him by God.

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:49.660
And Paul recognized that.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.619
Listen, nothing in your life happens by accident.

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:54.940
Nothing in my life happens by accident.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.419
We find that God is in control of all things.

00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:03.419
We find that God was giving to Paul this thorn in the flesh.

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:07.380
Notice it says, the messenger of Satan to buffet me,

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.899
lest I should be exalted above measure.

00:03:09.899 --> 00:03:12.259
Now notice in verse eight, for this thing,

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:14.139
for what thing, this thorn in the flesh,

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:18.179
I besought the Lord thrice that it might depart from me.

00:03:18.179 --> 00:03:21.220
So Paul prayed on three different occasions,

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.460
specifically prayed that this would be removed,

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.860
that he says that it might be depart from me,

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.220
that it might depart from me.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.139
Have you ever had a situation,

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:37.300
you pray and you ask God that it would depart from you?

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.940
Come on, we pray, God,

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.979
would you help this thing depart from me, right?

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:42.220
I don't wanna deal with this thing.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.820
I don't wanna deal with this infirmity.

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.160
I don't wanna have this issue.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.500
I don't wanna have this problem.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.619
I don't want this heartache.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.339
I don't want this obstacle.

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:50.619
Are you with me this morning?

00:03:50.619 --> 00:03:53.380
You pray that God would remove it.

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.940
By the way, aren't you thankful that God can remove it?

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.740
Amen, you pray that he would remove it

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.820
because you know that he has the power to do so.

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.460
But we find this morning that sometimes

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.460
as we look at our text this morning,

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.059
it is not always within the will of God

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:14.660
that he will remove from your life or my life,

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.720
what we desire for him to remove from our lives.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.779
Now, it doesn't mean that he cannot.

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:23.720
It simply means that it's not within his will.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.480
It means that he has a greater purpose in that thing

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.200
than maybe we understand or recognize

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.399
at the particular moment.

00:04:32.399 --> 00:04:34.320
We can look through the gospel records.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.160
We can see as the Lord Jesus Christ is walking

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.700
upon the face of the earth in his earthly ministry,

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.040
and we can see many times in which God healed

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.320
and God performed miracles,

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.820
but we find that there were certain times

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.959
in which God led his people directly into difficulty

00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:56.959
to prove himself and to increase their faith.

00:04:57.079 --> 00:04:59.260
And this morning, we find that Paul,

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.959
because he understood the power of God,

00:05:01.959 --> 00:05:04.959
because he experienced the work of God in his life,

00:05:04.959 --> 00:05:09.079
he prays that God would remove this thing from his life,

00:05:09.079 --> 00:05:10.399
this thorn in the flesh.

00:05:10.399 --> 00:05:12.160
He says, I besought the Lord.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.720
Listen, this is earnest prayer.

00:05:16.239 --> 00:05:18.559
This wasn't just a passing, Lord, would you?

00:05:18.559 --> 00:05:23.299
No, he's earnestly seeking, he's beseeching the Lord

00:05:23.299 --> 00:05:24.820
that it might depart from me.

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.239
And I want you to notice in verse number nine,

00:05:28.239 --> 00:05:33.239
and he, that's God, said unto me, that's Paul,

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.119
my grace is sufficient for thee,

00:05:38.119 --> 00:05:42.040
for my strength is made perfect in weakness.

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.640
Most gladly, therefore, will I rather glory

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.279
in my infirmities that the power of Christ

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:49.200
may rest upon me.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.720
Therefore, I take pleasure in infirmities

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.720
and reproaches and necessities and persecutions

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.720
and distresses for Christ's sake,

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:01.040
for when I am weak, then am I strong.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.519
This morning, if you're taking notes,

00:06:03.519 --> 00:06:07.119
I want you to notice number one, the promise explained.

00:06:07.119 --> 00:06:10.200
The promise explained in verse number nine.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:15.119
We find that God replies, responds to the request of Paul,

00:06:15.119 --> 00:06:16.559
according to verse number eight,

00:06:16.559 --> 00:06:19.440
that he would remove this thing from his life,

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.880
and God's response is given to us in verse number nine,

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.320
and there are two elements to this promise

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:26.880
that are explained to us,

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.559
and I want you to notice number one.

00:06:28.559 --> 00:06:31.320
It's very simple truth, but it says, number one,

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:35.799
my grace is sufficient for thee.

00:06:35.799 --> 00:06:38.859
I'm thankful this morning to know the grace of God.

00:06:38.899 --> 00:06:40.019
I'm thankful this morning

00:06:40.019 --> 00:06:42.500
to have experienced the grace of God.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.059
We sang about God's grace this morning,

00:06:45.059 --> 00:06:47.299
wonderful grace of Jesus.

00:06:47.299 --> 00:06:50.500
Listen, you're saved by grace, amen?

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.739
For by grace are you saved through faith.

00:06:52.739 --> 00:06:54.739
And Ephesians two and verse number eight,

00:06:54.739 --> 00:06:56.380
we understand that truth,

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:59.779
and we find that God is a gracious God.

00:06:59.779 --> 00:07:02.859
He reveals to us throughout the pages of scripture.

00:07:02.859 --> 00:07:05.140
Remember all the way back in Genesis,

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:08.559
the Bible says that Noah found grace

00:07:08.559 --> 00:07:09.980
in the eyes of the Lord.

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:12.200
I'm thankful that our God is a gracious God.

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.899
Yes, he's merciful and he's holy

00:07:13.899 --> 00:07:15.779
in all of the attributes of God,

00:07:15.779 --> 00:07:17.720
but this morning, just for a moment,

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.739
we're gonna focus our attention

00:07:19.739 --> 00:07:22.899
upon this truth of God's grace,

00:07:22.899 --> 00:07:26.179
and he has a limitless supply of grace.

00:07:26.179 --> 00:07:28.779
I mean, he's not restricted

00:07:28.779 --> 00:07:31.700
by too many people needing grace.

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:34.579
No, he is gracious.

00:07:34.579 --> 00:07:37.500
His grace will never be exhausted in your life

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:41.160
or in my life or in our lives collectively.

00:07:42.059 --> 00:07:45.380
He says, my grace, my grace.

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:47.820
Have you ever tried to be gracious with someone?

00:07:48.899 --> 00:07:51.059
And you try to be gracious with someone,

00:07:51.059 --> 00:07:52.820
you try to be gracious with someone,

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:55.140
and you say, my grace is kind of running out.

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:56.260
Have you ever been there?

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:57.579
You ever feel that way?

00:07:57.579 --> 00:08:00.140
You say, I know I'm supposed to be gracious, right?

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:01.779
Speak, we're supposed to speak,

00:08:01.779 --> 00:08:03.619
our speech is supposed to be with grace, right?

00:08:03.619 --> 00:08:06.660
How many times our speech hasn't been with grace, right?

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:08.619
We say, my grace is being exhausted here.

00:08:08.619 --> 00:08:13.380
You're testing me, you're pushing me to my limits.

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:14.220
And some of you are like, man,

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:16.220
I was there this morning, amen?

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:21.220
But you understand, listen, God's grace is sufficient.

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:25.059
God's grace is limitless.

00:08:25.059 --> 00:08:28.579
There's no exhausting the grace of God,

00:08:28.579 --> 00:08:31.739
and here we find that God says to Paul,

00:08:31.739 --> 00:08:36.299
my grace is sufficient for thee.

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:41.859
And I find in this truth of God's grace being amazing,

00:08:41.859 --> 00:08:44.460
and certainly it is, and we sing amazing grace,

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:47.539
how sweet the sound.

00:08:47.539 --> 00:08:50.940
We speak about God's grace being abundant.

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:55.179
We see that as Paul testifies of his own personal conversion

00:08:55.179 --> 00:08:57.299
as he's speaking to Timothy in 1 Timothy,

00:08:57.299 --> 00:09:01.820
and he talks about God's grace being abundant in his life.

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:04.619
And here we find that as Paul is writing

00:09:04.619 --> 00:09:06.380
to this church in Corinth

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:09.900
and he's rehearsing his own personal experience,

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:13.099
this promise is being explained

00:09:13.099 --> 00:09:18.099
that my grace, God says, is sufficient for thee.

00:09:18.119 --> 00:09:21.219
But God, I'm suffering with this thorn in the flesh.

00:09:21.219 --> 00:09:24.780
God, this thorn in the flesh is hindering my ability

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:27.659
from a human perspective of what I could accomplish

00:09:27.659 --> 00:09:28.900
and so on and so forth.

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:31.099
And God, I think it'd be so much better

00:09:31.099 --> 00:09:33.140
if I didn't have this thorn in the flesh.

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:38.140
And God says, my grace is sufficient for thee.

00:09:39.059 --> 00:09:41.539
Notice the second element of the promise

00:09:41.539 --> 00:09:44.340
as we look at this truth of the promise explained.

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:46.520
We find that the second element,

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:49.020
Jesus says not only is my grace,

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:51.099
my grace is sufficient for thee,

00:09:51.099 --> 00:09:56.099
but he says my strength is made perfect in weakness.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:58.099
Whose strength?

00:09:58.099 --> 00:09:59.039
Well, God's strength.

00:09:59.039 --> 00:10:00.539
How much strength does he have?

00:10:00.539 --> 00:10:04.139
all power, all authority. He is the omnipotent God. He

00:10:04.179 --> 00:10:06.979
rules and He reigns. He said, let there be light, and

00:10:07.019 --> 00:10:10.279
there was light. He spoke and it was done. We find that He

00:10:10.319 --> 00:10:13.919
has all power. Brother Jeff this morning referenced one

00:10:13.959 --> 00:10:16.359
of the miracles as he was dealing with the life of

00:10:16.399 --> 00:10:20.119
Gideon there of the impotent man at the pool of Bethesda.

00:10:20.159 --> 00:10:24.459
And that impotent man met the omnipotent God, the One who

00:10:24.499 --> 00:10:28.339
has all power. That man had no power, but God has all

00:10:28.939 --> 00:10:33.939
power. And He says, my strength is made perfect in

00:10:33.979 --> 00:10:38.819
weakness. Now here's the thing. We don't like to be

00:10:38.839 --> 00:10:45.859
weak. We feel vulnerable. We don't like to be weak. We

00:10:45.879 --> 00:10:51.319
like, we like to have it figured out. Can you relate?

00:10:51.359 --> 00:10:53.159
We want to, we want to have the answers we're going to

00:10:53.199 --> 00:10:56.899
be able to do. But, but here we find that, that Christ

00:10:56.919 --> 00:11:01.859
is giving a, a truth to Paul, but not just to Paul, to us

00:11:01.899 --> 00:11:04.699
as well as it's preserved in His Word. And it's a promise

00:11:04.739 --> 00:11:09.979
that is being explained that God's strength is made

00:11:09.999 --> 00:11:13.399
perfect in weakness. I want you to go back to 1

00:11:13.439 --> 00:11:16.119
Corinthians chapter 1 just for a moment. And I want you

00:11:16.139 --> 00:11:18.919
to look, Paul had previously written to this church in

00:11:18.939 --> 00:11:22.619
the, the first letter of 1 Corinthians as he sends this

00:11:22.659 --> 00:11:26.319
letter to them. But I want you to consider with me some

00:11:26.339 --> 00:11:30.439
of what God says here in the first chapter as Paul is

00:11:30.479 --> 00:11:33.019
speaking to this church. And we know it's a carnal

00:11:33.039 --> 00:11:35.819
church. And there's definitely been some growth as

00:11:35.859 --> 00:11:37.779
you look at 2 Corinthians. And we'll deal with that

00:11:37.819 --> 00:11:40.699
throughout the year. But notice in verse number 23,

00:11:40.719 --> 00:11:44.859
but we preach Christ crucified unto the Jews a

00:11:44.899 --> 00:11:47.359
stumbling block and unto the Greeks foolishness. But unto

00:11:47.399 --> 00:11:50.399
them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the

00:11:50.439 --> 00:11:54.939
power of God and the wisdom of God. Notice this, because

00:11:54.959 --> 00:12:00.799
the foolishness of God is wiser than men. The weakness

00:12:00.839 --> 00:12:05.339
of God is stronger than men. For ye see your calling,

00:12:05.379 --> 00:12:07.979
brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not

00:12:07.999 --> 00:12:10.879
many mighty, not many noble, are called. But God hath

00:12:10.919 --> 00:12:13.379
chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the

00:12:13.419 --> 00:12:16.679
wise. God hath chosen the weak things of the world to

00:12:16.719 --> 00:12:20.219
confound the things which are mighty. And base things of

00:12:20.259 --> 00:12:23.119
the world and things which are despised hath God chosen,

00:12:23.139 --> 00:12:25.979
yea, and things which are not to bring to naught things

00:12:26.019 --> 00:12:31.679
that are why, that no flesh should glory in His presence.

00:12:31.719 --> 00:12:35.919
Brother Jeff hasn't gotten there yet in the Sunday

00:12:35.959 --> 00:12:38.319
school class with Gideon, but you know why the army got

00:12:38.359 --> 00:12:41.199
shrunk down to 300? Because he said, if I give you the

00:12:41.219 --> 00:12:43.459
victory with the large number you're going to think you

00:12:43.499 --> 00:12:50.599
got the victory. That no flesh should glory in His

00:12:50.659 --> 00:12:53.959
presence. We acknowledge it's all because of the grace of

00:12:53.999 --> 00:12:57.499
God. In fact, Paul would say that, I am what I am by the

00:12:57.519 --> 00:13:03.099
grace of God. We find that God's strength is made

00:13:03.139 --> 00:13:06.399
perfect in weakness. I'm reminded of what the Bible

00:13:06.439 --> 00:13:10.379
says in John chapter number 1. Turn over quickly if you

00:13:10.399 --> 00:13:13.139
will to John chapter number 1 as we read this very

00:13:13.179 --> 00:13:17.479
important passage of Scripture dealing with the truth of

00:13:17.699 --> 00:13:21.199
the Incarnation and the eternality of the Lord Jesus

00:13:21.239 --> 00:13:24.799
Christ. In John chapter number 1 the Bible begins in

00:13:24.839 --> 00:13:28.839
verse number 1, In the beginning was the Word, and

00:13:28.879 --> 00:13:32.339
the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was

00:13:32.379 --> 00:13:35.179
in the beginning with God. All things were made by Him.

00:13:35.219 --> 00:13:39.059
Without Him was not anything made that was made. In Him

00:13:39.079 --> 00:13:42.919
was life, and the life was the light of men. Isn't that

00:13:42.959 --> 00:13:46.259
wonderful? I'm going to skip down to verse number 14. The

00:13:46.279 --> 00:13:48.979
Bible says, And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among

00:13:49.019 --> 00:13:51.979
us. Now the Word that's referenced in verses 1 and

00:13:52.019 --> 00:13:55.919
following we find then referenced in verse 14. In the

00:13:55.959 --> 00:13:59.099
beginning was the Word, the Word was with God, and the

00:13:59.119 --> 00:14:02.199
Word was God. And then in verse 14, And the Word was

00:14:02.219 --> 00:14:06.959
made flesh. That's the Incarnation. And dwelt among

00:14:06.999 --> 00:14:11.799
us, and we beheld His glory. The glory is of the only

00:14:11.839 --> 00:14:14.779
begotten of the Father. Notice what this says, Full of

00:14:14.859 --> 00:14:22.099
grace and truth. John bare witness of Him, and cried,

00:14:22.139 --> 00:14:25.339
saying, This was He of whom I spake. He that cometh after

00:14:25.379 --> 00:14:29.139
me is preferred before me. Why? For He was before me the

00:14:29.179 --> 00:14:33.579
eternality of Christ. And of His fullness have all we

00:14:33.619 --> 00:14:38.019
received, and grace for grace. For the law was given by

00:14:38.059 --> 00:14:43.019
Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ. No man

00:14:43.299 --> 00:14:45.999
hath seen God at any time. The only begotten Son, which is

00:14:46.039 --> 00:14:50.439
in the bosom of the Father, He hath declared Him. He's full

00:14:50.479 --> 00:14:55.839
of grace. He's gracious. The promise is explained. I want

00:14:55.879 --> 00:14:58.519
you to notice, He says, My grace is sufficient for thee.

00:14:58.539 --> 00:15:03.819
And then He says, My strength is made perfect in weakness.

00:15:03.859 --> 00:15:07.219
Just for a moment in 2 Corinthians chapter 12 as we

00:15:07.259 --> 00:15:09.619
consider the promise being explained, I want you to

00:15:09.619 --> 00:15:13.859
notice that little word, is. That little word, is. My

00:15:13.899 --> 00:15:19.999
grace is sufficient for thee. My strength is made perfect

00:15:20.039 --> 00:15:25.339
in weakness. The Bible does not say that My grace was

00:15:25.379 --> 00:15:28.819
sufficient for thee. The Bible does not say My grace will

00:15:28.839 --> 00:15:32.079
be sufficient for thee. The Bible says My grace is

00:15:32.119 --> 00:15:37.619
sufficient for thee. Listen, I understand that sometimes we

00:15:37.759 --> 00:15:42.499
can talk about the past. I understand sometimes we can

00:15:42.519 --> 00:15:45.459
worry about the future. You say, oh pastor we don't worry.

00:15:45.499 --> 00:15:48.459
Come on, we know we do. I understand the Bible says be

00:15:48.499 --> 00:15:52.399
careful for nothing. But there are times in your life, there

00:15:52.439 --> 00:15:55.579
are times in my life that we're not perfect in obedience.

00:15:55.599 --> 00:15:58.539
Amen. There are times that we worry about things, and we

00:15:58.579 --> 00:16:02.719
talk about the past, and we worry about the future. But

00:16:02.779 --> 00:16:07.419
you know where we live? We live in the present. You can't

00:16:07.459 --> 00:16:11.619
live in the past, and you can't live in the future. All you

00:16:11.659 --> 00:16:14.759
can do is live in the present. So you know what God says? My

00:16:14.799 --> 00:16:21.539
grace is sufficient for thee. He didn't say it was, or it

00:16:21.559 --> 00:16:24.279
will be. He said it is. So you know what that means to me?

00:16:24.299 --> 00:16:26.899
That means to me, and it means to you this morning when this

00:16:26.939 --> 00:16:30.819
promise is explained, that today in my circumstance today,

00:16:30.819 --> 00:16:34.219
in my situation today, in the obstacle today, in the

00:16:34.259 --> 00:16:40.259
infirmity, the difficulty, His grace is today sufficient for

00:16:40.299 --> 00:16:45.559
me. And it's important that we understand that little word is.

00:16:45.599 --> 00:16:49.799
You say it's so little word, but it's so important. The

00:16:49.839 --> 00:16:57.079
promise is being explained to us. God Almighty, the Creator

00:16:57.479 --> 00:17:01.039
of the universe, the One who formed you and me, the One who

00:17:01.079 --> 00:17:04.079
knows our thoughts. He knows everything about us. He knows

00:17:04.119 --> 00:17:07.179
the hairs on our head. He knows our thoughts. He knows our

00:17:07.219 --> 00:17:15.899
cares. He says my grace is sufficient for thee. And it's

00:17:15.919 --> 00:17:20.059
so mightily important, it's imperative that we understand

00:17:20.099 --> 00:17:24.439
this promise that's being explained to us this morning.

00:17:24.559 --> 00:17:27.999
And it's something that Paul is receiving from the Lord.

00:17:28.039 --> 00:17:32.679
He's receiving this word. He prayed. God said my grace is

00:17:32.699 --> 00:17:37.839
sufficient. My grace is sufficient. We see here in the

00:17:37.879 --> 00:17:40.379
text, not only the promise explained, but we see a

00:17:40.419 --> 00:17:43.879
response here of Paul that I believe is revealing an

00:17:43.919 --> 00:17:46.579
exemplary. If you're taking notes, number two, consider

00:17:46.619 --> 00:17:50.219
this. Not only the promise explained, but number two, the

00:17:50.339 --> 00:17:55.579
promise embraced. The promise embraced. I'm thankful that

00:17:55.619 --> 00:17:58.579
God explains the promise to us. I'm thankful that God

00:17:58.619 --> 00:18:02.119
recorded verse number nine in our Bible so that we could see

00:18:02.159 --> 00:18:05.959
the promise explained. That we could understand that when

00:18:05.999 --> 00:18:09.459
Paul said, has he besought the Lord thrice that it might

00:18:09.499 --> 00:18:12.099
depart from me, that the Bible doesn't just simply say that

00:18:12.139 --> 00:18:17.299
God said no. But that the answer was my grace is

00:18:17.419 --> 00:18:21.019
sufficient for thee, for my strength is made perfect in

00:18:21.059 --> 00:18:24.959
weakness. But then we see this response. And we find the

00:18:24.999 --> 00:18:29.339
promise is understood as God explained this to Paul. And

00:18:29.359 --> 00:18:32.499
the promise is explained, but now the promise is embraced.

00:18:32.539 --> 00:18:36.940
The word embraced means to seize eagerly. It means to lay

00:18:36.979 --> 00:18:41.380
hold on. I want you to understand this morning that

00:18:41.419 --> 00:18:47.179
this truth of 2 Corinthians chapter 12 is not something

00:18:47.199 --> 00:18:52.940
cliché for the Christian. It's not some cliché that the

00:18:52.979 --> 00:18:55.979
Christian is to use for marketing purposes or

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.179
advertisement. We find that there are many times in which

00:18:59.219 --> 00:19:02.579
even the thought, my grace is sufficient for thee, or as

00:19:02.619 --> 00:19:06.559
we've worded it, God's grace is sufficient for our theme for

00:19:06.579 --> 00:19:09.219
this year. Listen, it's not just a cliché for marketing

00:19:09.259 --> 00:19:14.659
purposes. It is a Bible truth that God has given to us that

00:19:14.679 --> 00:19:20.659
must be embraced by us. See, the promises of God are

00:19:20.679 --> 00:19:24.820
important. And we find that God has given us many promises.

00:19:24.859 --> 00:19:27.619
In fact, Peter would say that they're exceeding great and

00:19:27.659 --> 00:19:30.459
precious promises. But we find that in the beginning of this

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:33.899
book, 2 Corinthians, in chapter 1 and verse number 20, I want

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:36.799
you to notice what the Bible says. Because we find that

00:19:36.839 --> 00:19:39.940
this promise is explained that we're dealing with, and then

00:19:39.979 --> 00:19:43.179
it's embraced. But notice what Paul says in 2 Corinthians

00:19:43.199 --> 00:19:48.139
chapter 1 and verse number 20, for all the promises of God in

00:19:48.179 --> 00:20:00.079
Him are yea, and in Him, amen, unto the glory of God by us.

00:20:00.119 --> 00:20:01.119
Aren't you amazed?

00:20:01.119 --> 00:20:03.839
you thankful? Listen, the Apostle Paul, the Lord was

00:20:03.839 --> 00:20:06.479
revealing and giving him truth. We know all scripture

00:20:06.479 --> 00:20:09.999
is given by inspiration of God with regard to all the

00:20:09.999 --> 00:20:15.559
promises of God. In him are yea and in him amen. Listen,

00:20:15.559 --> 00:20:19.439
our God cannot lie. Aren't you thankful for that? I mean,

00:20:19.439 --> 00:20:22.359
he can't lie. Every promise in the book is mine. Every

00:20:22.359 --> 00:20:24.239
chapter, every verse, every line. That's what the

00:20:24.239 --> 00:20:27.279
songwriter said. And we look at the promise and listen,

00:20:27.399 --> 00:20:30.959
it's not just about an intellectual exercise of being

00:20:30.959 --> 00:20:34.039
able to know the promises to being able to rehearse the

00:20:34.039 --> 00:20:37.559
promises to be able to recite the promises. No, it must

00:20:37.559 --> 00:20:41.839
be that we embrace them personally, that we take the

00:20:41.839 --> 00:20:46.239
promise that God has given in his word and not just

00:20:46.239 --> 00:20:49.479
memorize it, not just share it for someone else, but we

00:20:49.479 --> 00:20:55.359
embrace it personally. That we understand as we look at

00:20:55.359 --> 00:20:58.759
this text of scripture that the Apostle Paul, he

00:20:58.759 --> 00:21:03.399
embraced this promise. I mean, the almighty God gave

00:21:03.399 --> 00:21:07.799
him a promise and it's embraced. And I would submit

00:21:07.799 --> 00:21:11.639
to you this morning that for each of us here, that we

00:21:11.639 --> 00:21:14.119
look at this passage of scripture and that we too

00:21:14.119 --> 00:21:17.959
would embrace the promise that's been revealed, that we

00:21:17.959 --> 00:21:21.839
would understand that in every scenario of my life, in

00:21:21.839 --> 00:21:24.959
every scenario of your life, in every situation that we

00:21:24.959 --> 00:21:29.959
face, that we claim embrace the promise of God, that

00:21:29.959 --> 00:21:33.759
God's grace is sufficient. You ever been in a place

00:21:33.759 --> 00:21:36.639
where you say, I just don't think I could go on. I just

00:21:36.639 --> 00:21:38.839
don't think I could do this anymore. This is too much

00:21:38.839 --> 00:21:42.839
for me. There are times that you feel that way. And by

00:21:42.839 --> 00:21:45.999
the way, God knows our frame. Aren't you thankful for

00:21:45.999 --> 00:21:50.319
that? He knows that we're but dust. We have an enemy

00:21:50.319 --> 00:21:56.159
that's relentless. David, at one point in his life, he

00:21:56.159 --> 00:22:01.959
fled and went to Philistine territory because Saul and

00:22:01.959 --> 00:22:06.719
all that was taking place got to be too much for him.

00:22:06.719 --> 00:22:10.000
We have an enemy. There are times in your life and in my

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.279
life that we can take a wrong perspective and a wrong

00:22:12.279 --> 00:22:16.119
approach and say, what's it worth? I just can't do this

00:22:16.159 --> 00:22:22.679
anymore. I'm just ready to throw in the towel. No. I'm

00:22:22.679 --> 00:22:24.839
going to continue. Why? Because God's grace is

00:22:24.839 --> 00:22:28.799
sufficient. And I'm going to embrace that promise. Notice

00:22:28.799 --> 00:22:33.319
in the text, we see how Paul embraced this promise.

00:22:33.319 --> 00:22:36.879
Notice what he says. In verse 9, we see the promise. And

00:22:36.879 --> 00:22:39.959
he, speaking of God, said to me, speaking of Paul, my

00:22:39.959 --> 00:22:43.440
grace is sufficient for thee. For my strength is made

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:46.360
perfect in weakness. And then notice what Paul says. This

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:48.959
is the embracing of the promise. He understood it. It

00:22:48.959 --> 00:22:53.679
was explained. He says, most gladly therefore, because of

00:22:53.679 --> 00:22:56.559
this promise, because of understanding what God

00:22:56.559 --> 00:23:00.159
Almighty has just revealed to me, most gladly therefore,

00:23:00.159 --> 00:23:07.199
will I rather glory in my infirmities. Why? That the

00:23:07.199 --> 00:23:12.639
power of Christ may rest upon me. We want the power of

00:23:12.799 --> 00:23:18.479
God to rest upon you. We want God's power in my life. I

00:23:18.479 --> 00:23:23.080
want to be used for the glory of God. I want God to, as it

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:26.119
says here, that my strength is made perfect in weakness.

00:23:26.119 --> 00:23:28.759
And Paul, dealing with this thorn in the flesh, and we

00:23:28.759 --> 00:23:31.199
don't understand all that it was. There are many that

00:23:31.199 --> 00:23:34.559
have concluded and they've assumed that it has to do

00:23:34.559 --> 00:23:37.399
with his eyesight. And I understand the reasons why

00:23:37.399 --> 00:23:39.559
they would reach the conclusion. But we don't know

00:23:39.559 --> 00:23:43.479
with a hundred percent certainty. But I want you to

00:23:43.479 --> 00:23:46.879
understand this morning that Paul says, because God made

00:23:46.879 --> 00:23:51.039
this truth known to me, that His grace is sufficient and

00:23:51.039 --> 00:23:54.000
that His strength is made perfect in my weakness, that

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.440
I'm going to, and he says, most gladly therefore, I'm

00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:01.959
going to glory in my infirmities. Well, that's a

00:24:01.959 --> 00:24:12.039
different perspective, is it not? It's not natural to

00:24:12.039 --> 00:24:15.759
glory in your infirmities. It's not natural as a human

00:24:15.759 --> 00:24:24.679
being to glory in your infirmities. To complain about

00:24:24.679 --> 00:24:28.079
your infirmities would be a natural response as a human

00:24:28.119 --> 00:24:34.559
being. Am I not right? But Paul says, most gladly

00:24:34.559 --> 00:24:39.440
therefore, most gladly therefore, will I rather glory

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:46.679
in my infirmities. Why? That the power of Christ may rest

00:24:46.679 --> 00:24:52.760
upon me. Paul's embracing this promise. He's believing

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:57.559
God. He's saying, God told me as I sought Him that this

00:24:57.559 --> 00:25:00.359
thing would be sought Him, so that this thing would depart

00:25:00.359 --> 00:25:03.679
from me, that God said, my grace is sufficient for Thee,

00:25:03.679 --> 00:25:07.079
that my strength is made perfect in weakness. And so

00:25:07.079 --> 00:25:11.639
Paul has this response. It's a response of embracing, to

00:25:11.639 --> 00:25:15.559
seize it eagerly, to lay hold on it, to apply it in his

00:25:15.559 --> 00:25:19.160
life. And he says that he would glory in his infirmities.

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:21.959
Not only does he say that in verse 9, but we find in verse

00:25:21.959 --> 00:25:25.399
number 10, it says, therefore. We've used this little

00:25:25.559 --> 00:25:28.359
phrase before. You've heard it, no doubt. Therefore, when

00:25:28.359 --> 00:25:30.359
you see a therefore in the Bible, you find out what it's

00:25:30.359 --> 00:25:33.479
therefore. And he says, therefore, because of this

00:25:33.479 --> 00:25:36.760
revealed truth, because of the promise that has been

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:42.440
explained, because of what I've understood that God has

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:45.799
communicated to me, not only did he say in verse 9, I will

00:25:45.799 --> 00:25:48.519
glory in my infirmities, but he says in verse 10, I take

00:25:48.519 --> 00:25:52.519
pleasure, notice what he says, in infirmities, in

00:25:52.519 --> 00:25:57.880
reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in

00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:04.279
distresses, for Christ's sake. There are many things that

00:26:04.279 --> 00:26:11.160
Paul suffered because he followed Jesus. He's not

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:13.639
speaking about things that he would suffer because of his

00:26:13.639 --> 00:26:17.479
own sin, because of his own wrongdoing. No, he's talking

00:26:17.479 --> 00:26:22.119
about the things that he would suffer for following Christ.

00:26:22.119 --> 00:26:24.359
There are many times we could study through the book of

00:26:24.359 --> 00:26:27.000
Acts, as we have in years past, where you find that the

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.440
apostle Paul, he faced these great levels of difficulty,

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:33.399
and distresses, and persecutions, simply because he

00:26:33.399 --> 00:26:38.040
was following Jesus and preaching the gospel. And so

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:40.679
when he's speaking about these things, he's speaking

00:26:40.679 --> 00:26:44.040
about taking pleasure and understanding that God was

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:47.639
going to give him the strength, that God was going to

00:26:47.639 --> 00:26:51.559
supernaturally, through his grace and through his power,

00:26:51.559 --> 00:26:55.959
he was going to enable Paul to carry forth and to do what

00:26:55.959 --> 00:27:01.799
God had called him to do. He says, for when I am weak,

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:09.959
then am I strong. For when I am weak, then am I strong.

00:27:12.279 --> 00:27:15.799
We find that even, as you read the book of 1 and 2

00:27:15.799 --> 00:27:19.000
Corinthians, there's truth revealed to us with regard to

00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:25.160
really the perspective that many had of the appearance,

00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:33.399
the stature of Paul. And we find that it was God's power

00:27:34.119 --> 00:27:39.559
that was seen in him and through him. We find that Paul

00:27:39.559 --> 00:27:43.639
is saying, I'm taking pleasure, I'm glorying in. Why?

00:27:43.639 --> 00:27:46.839
Because I understand this promise. It's a full embrace.

00:27:47.799 --> 00:27:54.440
It's a full embrace. This morning, the testimony, as we

00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:58.519
look here at this passage, is a testimony of an individual

00:27:58.519 --> 00:28:02.600
who not only knew the promise of God, but he personally

00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:07.399
embraced, most importantly embraced, the promise of God.

00:28:08.359 --> 00:28:13.799
And this morning and throughout 2025, our theme will be

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:18.839
God's grace is sufficient. And can I tell you this morning

00:28:19.559 --> 00:28:21.559
that we need to see it in our lives every day.

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:28.679
We live in the present and God says my grace is sufficient.

00:28:30.359 --> 00:28:36.520
God's grace is sufficient. And it's by the grace of God,

00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:42.119
this promise is one that must be embraced. How am I going to

00:28:42.119 --> 00:28:45.320
do this? How am I going to? Listen, if God's called you to

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:48.760
do it, he'll empower you to do it. And his grace will enable

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:52.359
you because his grace is sufficient. You say, I can't do

00:28:52.359 --> 00:28:55.559
this. You're right, but God can do it through you if he's

00:28:55.559 --> 00:28:59.640
called you to do it because his grace is sufficient.

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:06.520
And this morning and throughout 2025, I want us in our lives,

00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:10.279
those of us that have been saved by the grace of God to

00:29:10.279 --> 00:29:15.159
experience daily that God's grace is sufficient and that we

00:29:15.159 --> 00:29:19.719
would give God the glory for his grace in our lives every day

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:25.000
because God's grace is sufficient. And we begin to live

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:31.000
life every day with this thought in our minds, saturated in our

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:38.440
hearts that God's grace is sufficient. And we pause as we

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:41.960
face that obstacle, that difficulty, that opposition,

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:44.760
whatever it might be. We say, God, you said that your grace

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:48.599
was sufficient. God, I'm trusting you. I'm embracing the

00:29:48.599 --> 00:29:53.000
promise that you gave because God, I need your grace this

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.440
morning. I need your grace. I need your grace in this moment.

00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:58.839
And I understand that your grace, you're full of grace.

00:29:58.839 --> 00:30:01.080
It's not going to be.

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:12.440
be exhausted. Your grace is sufficient. And I hope that as we go through 2025 that we

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:20.860
would experience the grace of God in a very definite, real way. That we would be able

00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:26.500
to give the glory to God. See, when it's God's grace and when it's God's strength, it's God

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:34.300
who gets the glory. Amen? It's God alone who gets the glory. You know, Paul didn't want

00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:40.180
other people to think more highly of him than they should. Why? Because he wanted God to

00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:47.580
be glorified. Because he says, I am what I am by the grace of God. And this morning,

00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:55.900
I don't know all that we'll face day by day, but you know what encourages me? God does.

00:30:55.900 --> 00:31:05.020
He knows. And what encourages me even greater is that he said my grace is sufficient. And

00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:13.580
I want to challenge each and every one of us to not just have a promise explained, but

00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:21.580
to have a promise embraced. God in my life, I want to see your grace. I want to experience

00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:30.140
your grace. When I don't think I could, God's grace is sufficient. When that phone call

00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:38.100
comes, when that whatever happens, God's grace is sufficient. Don't get so caught up in the

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:44.020
future. Don't get so caught up in the what ifs. Because in the moment that you need God's

00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:52.540
grace, God's grace is sufficient. Don't let your mind say, well, I don't know what I would

00:31:52.540 --> 00:32:00.020
do if. I don't know how I could if. No, no. God said my grace is sufficient. You know

00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:07.140
what you'll find? In the moment that you need it, God's grace is sufficient. Let's pray.

00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:13.540
Father, we love you. How we thank you for loving us. God, I pray this morning that just

00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:25.700
as Paul embraced this promise that was explained in response to his request that this thorn

00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:31.500
in his flesh would depart from him. God, I pray this morning that you'd help us to understand,

00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:39.340
but most importantly, help us to embrace this promise. God, I'm thankful this morning that

00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:47.860
your grace is sufficient. I've experienced it and I give you the glory for it. I pray

00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:56.500
that you'd help us throughout this next calendar year as we study through this book to remind

00:32:56.500 --> 00:33:02.860
it regularly of your grace. Thank you for saving us. Lord, if there's one here that's

00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:07.740
not been saved by the grace of God, they don't know for sure that if they were to die that

00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:16.460
heaven is their home. Their greatest need at this moment is to be saved. To have their

00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:21.100
sins forgiven, to know for sure that heaven is their home. And I pray that the Holy Spirit

00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:27.940
of God would convict them and help them to understand that Jesus saves. And for my grace

00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:31.940
are you saved through faith and not of yourselves. It's the gift of God, not of works, lest any

00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:37.260
man should boast. And I pray that if there's one under the sound of my voice that needs

00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:42.500
to be saved, that today would be the day of their salvation. Lord, I pray for those

00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:49.220
that have been saved, that know you as personal Lord and Savior. They've been saved by grace.

00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:59.780
In a room of any size of people, there are great needs, difficulties, infirmities, hardships.

00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:08.420
Lord, I pray that you'd help us to embrace this promise, that your grace is sufficient.

00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:14.860
Lord, that you would help us to experience your grace in our lives. Maybe the Holy Spirit

00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:20.540
has touched a particular area in someone's life, or would you help us to be responsive

00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:27.540
this morning, to be doers of the word and not hearers only. We pray that you alone would

00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:31.780
be honored and glorified through every decision that would be made. For it's in Christ's name

00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:33.260
we pray. Would you stand with me?
