1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,119
Introduced our theme last week from the 7th verse of 1st John chapter number 1,

2
00:00:05,119 --> 00:00:09,680
and we'll go back to the first four verses as we begin preaching through the book of 1st John

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:14,479
this year, and I'm definitely looking forward to it. Our theme for this year, as you see in our

4
00:00:14,479 --> 00:00:20,159
banners, Walking in the Light, and what a blessing. I'm so thankful for the Word of God, for the

5
00:00:20,159 --> 00:00:27,520
truth that is just conveyed to us, communicated to us through this precious book, and I trust that

6
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:33,360
you too are excited about the opportunity to study the book of 1st John together through 2022.

7
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,880
Beginning in verse number 1, the Bible says, "...that which was from the beginning,

8
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,200
which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon,

9
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:47,040
and our hands have handled of the word of life. For the life was manifested, and we have seen it,

10
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:52,959
and bear witness, and show unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested

11
00:00:52,959 --> 00:00:59,279
unto us. That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that you also may have fellowship

12
00:00:59,279 --> 00:01:05,519
with us, and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with His Son, Jesus Christ. And these

13
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:12,639
things write we unto you, that your joy may be full." I mentioned last week, as we touched on

14
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:18,400
verse number 4 during part of the message, that some of the most joyful people of all the earth

15
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,440
should be God's people, amen? And we have much to rejoice in. We'll deal with that a little bit as

16
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,959
we get through the message this morning, but I'd like to preach a message that I've simply

17
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:32,480
entitled from these first four verses, an eyewitness account, an eyewitness account.

18
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:38,239
There's a great similarity between the opening of this epistle and the opening of the Gospel of John.

19
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:41,599
You find that many times as you read the epistles, especially in the New Testament,

20
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:45,760
you look at a lot of the Pauline writings as he is writing under the inspiration of the Holy

21
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:51,519
Spirit of God, but there's an introduction. In the introduction, there's typically a greeting as to

22
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:56,800
who the book is being written to, the church or the individual, and then some information about

23
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:01,919
Paul as being the writer of the book, and so on and so forth. But here we find that John, under

24
00:02:01,919 --> 00:02:06,959
the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God, just gets right into it, and he does the same thing

25
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:12,320
in the Gospel of John. And of course, we understand all Scripture is given by inspiration of God,

26
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:17,440
but it's very interesting to see how there's really no introduction in this book like there

27
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,479
is in some of the other books that you read in the New Testament. But the introduction that is here

28
00:02:23,119 --> 00:02:28,880
is a powerful introduction, and we find that such is the case even with the Gospel of John. I mean,

29
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:34,399
it just starts with a bang. It's right in your face, the truth that is being declared and how

30
00:02:34,399 --> 00:02:41,039
powerful that is. I'm thankful that God's Word is truth and that God's truth changes lives, and God's

31
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:46,720
truth must be proclaimed. John, of course, as we know, was one of the twelve disciples. But more

32
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:53,440
than being one of the twelve disciples, John was really in that inner circle. We understand that

33
00:02:53,440 --> 00:03:00,639
God gives us the record of the Mount of Transfiguration. We're told that John, Peter,

34
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:07,199
and James as well, Jesus brought the three of them up into a mountain, and the Bible says that He was

35
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:15,199
transfigured before them. We find that John was in that inner circle many times as you read the

36
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:22,240
Gospel of John. You find that under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, He will refer to Himself as

37
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:28,320
the disciple whom Jesus loved. And you think about the closeness of that relationship that He had

38
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:34,880
with the Lord Jesus Christ, and you understand that it is this man that God has chosen to be

39
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:42,479
the human penman of this short epistle. We find that false teaching continues to invade the church

40
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:49,520
of God during the first century. We studied through the book of Colossians in 2021, and as we studied

41
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:54,080
through the book of Colossians, we referenced the false teaching that was prevalent there and how

42
00:03:54,080 --> 00:04:00,639
the Gnostics were one of the groups of people that Paul was no doubt dealing with, and the truth that

43
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:06,880
was given in that book to those believers to help them combat the false teaching. We've often said

44
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:13,039
over the years that the remedy for false teaching is truth, and how we need to know the truth. And

45
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:19,279
we understand that God has warned throughout the scriptures that there would be false teachers.

46
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:24,480
In fact, He uses the parallel, as Peter would tell us, that just as there were false prophets,

47
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:30,000
there will be false teachers. And we know that the false teaching invaded the church in the first

48
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:37,040
century, and it continues to seek to invade and influence the church to this very day, and how we

49
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:44,320
need to be built up in the faith, how that we need to earnestly contend for the faith. We cannot know

50
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:50,000
and cannot defend the faith, excuse me, we cannot defend it if we do not know it, and how imperative

51
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,720
it is that we know the faith that was once delivered. The Gnostics continued to be active,

52
00:04:57,359 --> 00:05:03,760
even amongst these that John is writing to, but really the bigger group of people that were quite

53
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:12,000
active were the Docetists. And this idea of these that would claim and follow this teaching

54
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:18,480
of these Docetists, they were making an impact in the region here and amongst the believers,

55
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:25,440
and really they denied the humanity of Jesus Christ. They, similarly to the Gnostics,

56
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:31,440
they would really take some of the Gnostic teaching and they would come to this conclusion

57
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,200
that there's no humanity, that it was just a figure that Jesus went to a cross, that it really

58
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:45,200
didn't happen, there's no human form there. And so, obviously, that's a huge false teaching and

59
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:52,640
a huge problem. I believe that as we understand the false teaching that was really prevalent in

60
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:59,359
seeking to invade the churches and the believers, it gives us great insight to these first four

61
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:06,640
verses of the book of 1 John, because these false teachers are denying the humanity of Jesus Christ,

62
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:12,720
and John says, that which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our

63
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:18,880
eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled of the word of life. Well, that smacks you

64
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:24,959
in the face, doesn't it? And we find that he's going directly at the false teaching, and he's

65
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:32,160
proving, yes, the deity of Jesus Christ, but the humanity of Jesus Christ, the great truth of the

66
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,119
incarnation. In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God. That's how

67
00:06:37,119 --> 00:06:42,640
John's gospel begins, and you find that you skip down to the 14th verse, and it says this,

68
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:49,040
and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. We'll look at that verse in more detail in just a

69
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:59,359
moment, but you find that Jesus Christ is 100% God and 100% man, and John, who was one of those 12

70
00:06:59,359 --> 00:07:08,160
disciples, John, who was in the inner circle, he was able to give this eyewitness account and help

71
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:15,279
these believers to understand truth so that they would not be influenced by this false teaching.

72
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,839
If you look at the text of Scripture, if you're taking notes this morning, I want you to notice,

73
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:25,119
first of all, the credibility of the account. We speak about an eyewitness account, or you speak

74
00:07:25,119 --> 00:07:31,839
about an account in general, you find that the eyewitness account has great credibility and is

75
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:36,959
one that is sought after. When you think about someone giving an account, giving a testimony,

76
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:42,000
giving some type of record, if it's in a court of law, if it's to some type of law enforcement

77
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:51,040
personnel, having an eyewitness to the event that is being discussed or evaluated is of great value.

78
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:58,799
Someone comes, and they see this particular situation, an accident or something else, and

79
00:07:58,799 --> 00:08:01,679
you stand there, and you say, well, I want to tell you what happened. He says, well, were you here?

80
00:08:01,679 --> 00:08:05,519
Did you see it? Well, no, but I'm just going to kind of give you what I think happened.

81
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:11,760
I'm not interested in that kind of an account, right? That's not necessary. But the individual,

82
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:17,440
when the law enforcement shows up, when the lawyer is speaking to the clients and seeking to get

83
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:23,119
testimony and what have you, and there's an eyewitness of that particular event that stands,

84
00:08:23,679 --> 00:08:29,760
sits upon that stand and gives testimony and can say, I was there, and I saw it, and here's my

85
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:36,239
testimony. There's a level of credibility. And here we find the credibility of this eyewitness

86
00:08:36,239 --> 00:08:42,080
account. Notice again, in verse number one, he says, which we have heard. He says, that which

87
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:52,159
was from the beginning, which we have heard. Then he says this, which we have seen with our eyes,

88
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:57,679
which we have looked upon. And so you see the next two statements are dealing with what he saw.

89
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:02,479
So, he speaks about what he heard. He speaks about what he saw. And then notice at the end

90
00:09:02,479 --> 00:09:10,719
of verse number one, it says, in our hands have handled of the word of life. He says in verse

91
00:09:10,719 --> 00:09:19,039
number two, he says, for the life was manifested. Notice this phrase again, and we have seen it.

92
00:09:19,599 --> 00:09:27,440
Look in verse number three, that which we have seen and heard, declare we unto you.

93
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:34,320
The credibility of the account is laid out just beautifully for us in these first few verses

94
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:40,960
of 1 John chapter number one. And we see that John is giving the credibility to this eyewitness

95
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:45,840
account that he's going to provide, and of course, the entirety of this epistle. But he begins by

96
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:50,559
letting the readers and letting us know under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God, that this

97
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:57,280
is not some second hand type of information, that this is not something that he's just conjured up

98
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,760
in his own mind and some theory that he's.

99
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,560
No, this is an eyewitness account.

100
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,180
This is what I have seen with my eyes.

101
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:07,140
This is what I've heard with my ears.

102
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,140
This is what I've handled with my hands.

103
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,860
And what a blessing to think about the power,

104
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:15,940
the credibility of this account.

105
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,980
Notice in John 1, back in the Gospel of John,

106
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:21,100
I mentioned that we'd be in this verse in just a moment,

107
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,560
but look at John 1 in verse number 14.

108
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,020
In fact, we're gonna take a little journey

109
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,600
through the Gospel of John

110
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:31,100
to just look at the testimony of the Apostle John

111
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:34,180
and to deal with this credibility that he has

112
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,280
with regard to the writing of this book

113
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:40,280
and the information that he would give.

114
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,280
The Bible says in John 1 in verse number 14,

115
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,980
and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.

116
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,700
We know the incarnation

117
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,980
when God took upon himself human form.

118
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,520
And the Bible says, and dwelt among us,

119
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,940
tabernacled among us.

120
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,400
He lived and breathed.

121
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,780
He walked among the disciples.

122
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:02,660
And Jesus, as you look at the entirety

123
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,940
of his earthly ministry

124
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:08,400
and John being one of those disciples in the inner circle,

125
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:12,360
remember, John, he saw that Jesus slept, right?

126
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,200
He was tired.

127
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,240
He was asleep on the boat.

128
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,320
He saw that Jesus was unhungered.

129
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,540
He saw that Jesus was thirsty.

130
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,360
He saw these things,

131
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,940
these human attributes of the Lord Jesus Christ.

132
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,820
He saw the deity of Christ.

133
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,500
He saw the power of Christ.

134
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,540
He saw the same God that was sleeping in the boat

135
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,580
stand and say, peace, be still.

136
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,040
He saw the same God who was wearied with his journey

137
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,200
that was looking for water

138
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,540
that gave freely of the living water

139
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,200
that we look at in John 4.

140
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,900
And he talked to the lady, the woman at the well

141
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,580
of all of her history and all of those things.

142
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,480
He is the God-man.

143
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,580
And John says that he was made flesh and he dwelt among us.

144
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,040
Notice the next phrase.

145
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,660
And we beheld his glory,

146
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,420
the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,

147
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:10,500
full of grace and truth.

148
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,700
That phrase, when it says we beheld his glory,

149
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,420
is really the same phrase that we look at in 1 John

150
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,420
when it says that we looked upon him.

151
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,140
We beheld his glory.

152
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:24,080
As we notice, as we study through the gospel records

153
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,000
and we read of the life and ministry

154
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,300
of the Lord Jesus Christ,

155
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:32,100
and you think about the great privilege of these disciples,

156
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:36,220
and John in particular with regard to the subject at hand,

157
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:41,100
how that he had the opportunity to see all of these things,

158
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:46,100
to hear from the Lord Jesus Christ, to sit with him.

159
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,560
What a great blessing.

160
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,740
Notice in John one, skip down if you would,

161
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,380
to verse number 35.

162
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:53,220
The Bible says, again,

163
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,740
the next day after John stood and two of his disciples,

164
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,660
this is speaking of John the Baptist,

165
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,460
it says this in verse number 36,

166
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:02,100
and looking upon Jesus as he walked,

167
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,700
notice what John the Baptist says,

168
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,620
behold, the Lamb of God.

169
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,520
And the two disciples heard him speak

170
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,520
and they followed Jesus.

171
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,720
It says, then Jesus turned and saw them following

172
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,400
and saith unto them, what seek ye?

173
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,540
They said unto him, Rabbi, which is to say,

174
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:23,580
being interpreted, Master, where dwellest thou?

175
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,960
Notice what Jesus says,

176
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,860
the invitation that is extended in verse number 39.

177
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:31,600
He saith unto them, come and see.

178
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,500
They came and saw where he dwelt

179
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,860
and abode with him that day,

180
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,740
for it was about the 10th hour.

181
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:42,720
One of the two which heard John speak and followed him,

182
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,120
it says, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.

183
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:50,180
We believe that the second one was the John

184
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,640
that we're speaking of this morning,

185
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,900
John the Apostle, the disciple.

186
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,700
He does not regularly refer to himself

187
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,920
throughout this book, as you know,

188
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,560
as we've studied in the past,

189
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,660
but you find that after they come and see,

190
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:08,020
they respond to the invitation and John is there,

191
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:11,660
and then the attention goes to Andrew in verse number 40,

192
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:14,860
and it says that he first findeth his own brother

193
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:17,200
and saith unto him, notice what he says,

194
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,160
and no doubt John would have come to the same conclusion,

195
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,580
we have found the Messiah,

196
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:25,720
which is being interpreted, the Christ.

197
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,119
John has the opportunity to walk with the Lord Jesus Christ.

198
00:14:31,119 --> 00:14:33,600
He has the opportunity to see great miracles,

199
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,800
to hear great teaching,

200
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,400
and John chapter number 15,

201
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,800
turn over, if you will, several chapters,

202
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,800
and you note that in this particular section

203
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,480
of the Gospel of John, that the hour is nigh,

204
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,540
it is not yet come, we find that he makes that statement

205
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:51,100
in John 17, the hour is now come,

206
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,339
but we know that soon,

207
00:14:52,339 --> 00:14:54,700
Jesus would go to the cross of Calvary.

208
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,420
We know that he's told the disciples,

209
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:58,860
he's explained to the disciples what's happening,

210
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,940
and he's giving them information here in this 15th chapter,

211
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,839
really into the 16th chapter,

212
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,140
with regard to the comforter that would come

213
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,700
and the adversity that they deal with,

214
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,700
and so on and so forth,

215
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:14,000
but notice what Jesus says in John 15 and verse number 27,

216
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:20,240
and ye also shall bear witness, why?

217
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,440
Because ye have been with me from the beginning.

218
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:26,960
Right, doesn't that parallel so beautifully

219
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,760
to first John chapter number one,

220
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:32,040
when John, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

221
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,559
he begins this testimony that he's going to give,

222
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:38,240
and says that which was from the beginning,

223
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,740
which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes,

224
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,260
which we have looked upon,

225
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,300
and our hands have handled the word of life,

226
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,779
he says in verse number three,

227
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:48,740
that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you,

228
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:52,300
Jesus said, ye shall bear witness, why?

229
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:55,540
Because ye have been with me from the beginning,

230
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,940
and John is testifying, he's giving this witness.

231
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:03,839
Notice in the very last statements of John 21,

232
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,100
the last two verses of this great book,

233
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:10,240
in John 21, we understand that it's at this time

234
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,200
in which the focus is really primarily dealing with Peter,

235
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,559
here at the end of John 21, and John is there,

236
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:21,240
for the Bible says that Peter, in verse number 20,

237
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,839
turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved,

238
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:28,240
following, and that's John, and so John is there,

239
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,360
and Jesus is interacting with Peter,

240
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,520
and we find that in verse number 24,

241
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,640
as the book concludes, the Bible says,

242
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:39,660
this is the disciple which testifieth of these things,

243
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,920
and wrote these things,

244
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,100
and we know that his testimony is true.

245
00:16:47,779 --> 00:16:49,220
Notice verse 25,

246
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:53,820
and there are also many other things which Jesus did,

247
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,020
the which, if they should be written,

248
00:16:56,020 --> 00:17:00,080
everyone, I suppose, that even the world itself

249
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:04,440
could not contain the books that should be written, amen.

250
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:08,339
And I want you to just meditate upon that for just a moment.

251
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:11,059
We really, as we started our study in Sunday school,

252
00:17:11,059 --> 00:17:13,820
the family church Sunday school class

253
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,380
that we started back in November,

254
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,460
and going through the miracles of Jesus Christ,

255
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,300
we looked at this verse of scripture,

256
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,380
John 21 and verse 25, coupled with the truth

257
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:25,740
in John 20, verse 30 and 31,

258
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,059
speaking about the things that were written

259
00:17:28,059 --> 00:17:30,260
versus the things that were not written,

260
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,580
but I want you, just for a moment,

261
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:34,640
to think about John giving this eyewitness account

262
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,200
in 1 John, these first four verses

263
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,480
that are our focus of study this morning,

264
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,320
and as you consider the credibility of the account,

265
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,820
the credibility of that which John is giving,

266
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:50,279
you must understand the great things that he heard and saw.

267
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,279
He says, these things are written,

268
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:57,000
but if all of the things were written,

269
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,559
I'm not sure the world could contain.

270
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:05,580
Can you imagine when we look through and study the gospels

271
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:10,500
as we journey with Jesus during his earthly ministry,

272
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,900
we have the opportunity to see some great things,

273
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:17,020
but there's so many things that Jesus did

274
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,260
that are not recorded for us in scripture,

275
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,860
and John is a witness of those things.

276
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:27,260
John is an eyewitness, and he says,

277
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:29,339
I'm gonna give an account,

278
00:18:29,339 --> 00:18:31,200
and when you think about the senses,

279
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,220
he says, the things that I've heard,

280
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:36,280
the things that I've seen,

281
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:40,000
as I've handled the word of life,

282
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,960
this is the testimony that I'm going to give.

283
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:47,080
Now, when somebody enters into a law firm,

284
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,600
when someone enters into a courtroom,

285
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:54,100
and they preface the account that they're going to give

286
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,400
with that kind of a statement,

287
00:18:57,419 --> 00:19:01,140
this is an exciting testimony that I'm ready to hear, right?

288
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,059
There is credibility in this testimony.

289
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:05,739
Now, we understand the credibility

290
00:19:05,739 --> 00:19:07,260
because it's the word of God,

291
00:19:08,299 --> 00:19:10,260
but I want you to understand

292
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,780
the original recipients of this book

293
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,780
and all that's going on with the false teaching

294
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:19,859
and all of the influence and how that John comes,

295
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:22,739
again, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

296
00:19:22,739 --> 00:19:27,140
but he's going to just come out full steam, full go,

297
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,640
and say, here's the testimony that I'm going to give,

298
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,080
and here's why it's credible,

299
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,400
because I'm an eyewitness.

300
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,020
I would say this of John,

301
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,960
when I think about the credibility of the account

302
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,000
that is given to us in this epistle,

303
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,040
I would say that he was a faithful, credible witness.

304
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,600
He was faithful.

305
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,640
He did what God had instructed him to do.

306
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:51,400
He fulfilled the ministry that God had given him to fulfill,

307
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:55,200
and we find that he is laboring and seeking to influence,

308
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,679
and he's giving this testimony.

309
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,179
So we think about the credibility, and that's wonderful,

310
00:19:59,179 --> 00:20:00,020
but now as we.

311
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:03,500
move through the passage, I want you to think not only of the credibility, but I

312
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:08,060
want you to think about the content of this testimony, this eyewitness account

313
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:12,760
that is given. I'm thankful for the credibility of it, but I want to know the

314
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:17,700
content of it. Well, stick with us for all year to get the content of it, amen?

315
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:21,660
Because I can't give it to you in one service, but I do believe he gives us a

316
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:27,220
great preview as to what the content is of this witness that he is going to

317
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:33,380
provide this testimony. Notice in verse number two, for the life was manifested

318
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:39,220
and we have seen it. How similar that is to John 1 and verse number 14. He says

319
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:48,900
this, and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the

320
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:55,260
Father and was manifested unto us. Now isn't that really the most important

321
00:20:55,260 --> 00:21:01,340
thing to be able to, the content of the message, the content being eternal life,

322
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:09,820
the true need of every human being? And we find that he begins speaking about

323
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:14,860
this eternal life in verse number two, and as we think about this eternal

324
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:18,460
life, we really think of it from two perspectives. Number one would be the

325
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:23,940
source. What is the source of eternal life? It's not John, it's not the

326
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:30,780
disciples or the apostles' creed. It is the Father. It is God's plan that we find

327
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:35,940
that is given throughout the Word of God that he is going to redeem his creation

328
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:43,300
through the substitutionary atonement of his Son, right? The gift of God is

329
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:47,980
eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. We find that in Ephesians chapter

330
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:52,060
number one, we won't take time to look there, but if you want to go back and

331
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:56,180
look through Ephesians 1, you see three really beautiful divisions in the first

332
00:21:56,180 --> 00:22:01,060
15 verses of that chapter, and what you see is the plan of redemption, that

333
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:06,340
this is God's plan on how mankind is going to be redeemed. So many people over

334
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:11,460
the years have confused Ephesians 1 with dealing with the who is going to be

335
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:16,460
redeemed instead of the how people are going to be redeemed. He's not dealing

336
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:21,780
with the who, he's dealing with the how. Mankind, the plan of God is that mankind

337
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:27,260
will be redeemed only one way, and that's through Jesus Christ. So he deals

338
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:31,380
with the plan of redemption, he then deals with the price of redemption. It's

339
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:35,540
with the precious blood of Christ. Redemption is not possible apart from

340
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:40,780
the blood of Christ, amen? You can't be redeemed. Redeemed how I love to

341
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:44,900
proclaim it, redeemed how? By the blood of the Lamb, right? That's what we're

342
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:48,900
saying. And there's only one way to be redeemed. We know that Peter says this,

343
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:52,060
that we're not redeemed with corruptible things such as silver and

344
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:55,620
gold received by our tradition from fathers and so on and so forth, but we're

345
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:59,940
redeemed how? With the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb that was slain

346
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:04,620
before the foundation of the world. We see the plan and the the price, and then

347
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:08,860
you see the proof of redemption in that next section of Ephesians 1, where you

348
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:16,580
find that God in his wisdom has given us the Holy Spirit of God, who is the, he

349
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:20,740
seals us into the day of redemption, and you think about the wonderful truth of

350
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:26,500
that proof of redemption. And so we think about eternal life, a subject that will be

351
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:31,940
dealt with throughout this book, and you find the source of eternal life, but then

352
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:36,300
you find really, and this becomes a very large focus of the book of 1st John,

353
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:43,540
really he deals with the security, the security. You know, I'm so thankful that

354
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:49,460
we can know that we're saved, that we can have that security. We find that

355
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:57,020
throughout the book of 1st John, in one form or another, the word know is used

356
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:02,660
over 30 times. Now when you think about the word being used, it's, I think it's 38

357
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:08,860
times, know, known, knoweth. Many of those, not all of them of course, but many of

358
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:15,340
those are in reference specifically to knowing that you have eternal life,

359
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:22,020
knowing that you belong to the Father, knowing that you're saved. And so the

360
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:27,340
content of the testimony is that we're going to tell you the source of eternal

361
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:31,180
life, and that is God, and we're going to teach you and we're going to share with

362
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:36,380
you the security of eternal life, knowing that you belong to the Lord. I want you to

363
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:42,340
think about what John heard Jesus say in John chapter number 10. In John

364
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:46,940
chapter number 10, in verses 27 through 30, John hears Jesus say this,

365
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:53,380
I know my sheep and they hear my voice, and I give unto them eternal life, and

366
00:24:53,380 --> 00:25:03,580
they shall never perish. John heard Jesus speak those words. Now when John heard

367
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:09,100
Jesus speak those words, those are words of security, are they not? I give unto

368
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:18,100
them eternal life, and they shall never perish. Man, those are absolutes. Those

369
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:22,620
are cherished statements within the Word of God. And when you think about the

370
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:27,580
security of the believer, and you find that Peter says this, that we are kept by

371
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:32,340
the power of God, when you find, I've said this to people over the years, that

372
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:37,620
God promises that the gift of God is eternal life. He didn't tell us that the

373
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:44,220
gift of God was temporary life, and he sure didn't tell us it was probationary

374
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:51,420
life. I've never been on probation. I hope to never be on probation. Amen? If you

375
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:56,620
were, don't tell me. If you are, definitely don't tell me. But the reality

376
00:25:56,620 --> 00:26:01,700
is that I understand some things about being on probation, and one of the things

377
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:05,540
that I understand about being on probation is that you better walk a fine

378
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:11,660
line, right? Because what happens if you don't walk the fine line, you go

379
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:16,700
back to the big house, so to speak, right? I mean, that's what happens. So

380
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,220
therefore, when we think about the eternal life, he didn't say I give you

381
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:25,460
probationary life. He didn't say I made the down payment, and now you try to keep

382
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:32,020
it. And John, as he's writing in this book, under the inspiration of the Holy

383
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:36,820
Spirit of God, he says, I want you to understand the source of eternal life,

384
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:42,560
but I want you to know the security of eternal life. I want you to know that you

385
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:49,940
belong to Him, that I am His, and He is mine. Isn't that precious? When you think

386
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:53,820
about the truth of eternal life, and you think about who He is to us, and we

387
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:58,380
understand the relationship of adoption, and that we become His children, and yes,

388
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:03,420
our fellowship will vary during our walk with Christ, but our relationship is

389
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:10,780
constant. And what joy that is. You think about the truth of the psalmist in Psalm

390
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:16,860
23, a familiar passage of Scripture that we often refer to to be a source of

391
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:21,340
great encouragement to us and strength to us, that the Word of God says the Lord

392
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:27,980
is my shepherd. It was an understanding that the psalmist had that there was a

393
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:35,220
relationship there, and that He is my shepherd. And here, throughout this book,

394
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:39,940
we understand that part of the content here will be that of eternal life, the

395
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:45,220
source, and the security. I would say this, that as you continue reading, notice

396
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:48,260
we've noted in verse number two about the eternal life, but look in verse

397
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:52,700
number three, that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that you

398
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:57,340
also may have fellowship with us. And truly our fellowship is with the Father

399
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:02,540
and with His Son, Jesus Christ. I believe that as you look at the content of the

400
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:06,740
account of the testimony that is given, then another theme that will be

401
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:11,500
developed throughout this epistle is that of fellowship. Fellowship, yes, first

402
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:17,100
with the Lord, but then fellowship one with another. I belabored the point last

403
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:20,220
week, and we'll look at it again next week, as you look at verse number seven,

404
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:23,740
that He says that if we walk in the light, our theme, walking in the light,

405
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:27,820
that if you walk in the light, living that life of obedience as He is in the

406
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:31,900
light, that we have fellowship, He doesn't say with God, He says with one another.

407
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:36,619
Now, we understand that we do have fellowship with God, because we're

408
00:28:36,619 --> 00:28:40,020
walking in the light as He is in the light, so we have fellowship with Him, and

409
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:45,179
that is rejoicing, or that should cause us to rejoice greatly, but He

410
00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:50,380
notes specifically that we have fellowship one with another, and how

411
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:54,900
precious that is, and how God has designed it that we would have

412
00:28:54,900 --> 00:29:01,140
fellowship one with another, and we find that here, that John is in this opening,

413
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:06,260
he's speaking about the credibility of his witness, of his testimony, that he has

414
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:12,739
heard and seen and handled of the Word of Life, of Jesus Christ, and he's

415
00:29:12,739 --> 00:29:17,739
going to declare that which he's heard, and that which he has seen, and he's

416
00:29:17,739 --> 00:29:23,140
speaking of eternal life, and he's speaking of fellowship. Truly, our

417
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:27,020
fellowship is with the Father, and with His Son, Jesus Christ, he says in verse

418
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:31,380
number three. You know, apart from redemption, there's no way to have

419
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:36,179
fellowship with God. We're at enmity with God before salvation. It's what the Word

420
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:41,940
of God teaches. We're dead in our sins and our trespasses. We mentioned the

421
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:49,140
biblical term, the theological term of reconciliation. We had to be reconciled.

422
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:57,140
Why? Because we were separated. Our sin separates us from God. We cannot have

423
00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:02,059
fellowship with God, so we must be redeemed.

424
00:30:02,059 --> 00:30:09,159
And as we're redeemed, I mentioned last week as we studied that introductory message with

425
00:30:09,159 --> 00:30:13,899
regard to walking in the light, that number one, walking in the light requires relationship.

426
00:30:13,899 --> 00:30:17,419
You cannot walk in the light if you don't belong to Him.

427
00:30:17,419 --> 00:30:21,539
It requires relationship, and it is based upon relationship.

428
00:30:21,539 --> 00:30:27,179
And because I belong to the Lord, because I've been saved, I can walk in the light

429
00:30:27,179 --> 00:30:29,859
and I can have fellowship with Him.

430
00:30:29,859 --> 00:30:30,859
Now think about that.

431
00:30:30,859 --> 00:30:32,899
Isn't that a great privilege of every child?

432
00:30:32,899 --> 00:30:40,979
It's a unique privilege that we can have fellowship with God, the God of the universe, the God

433
00:30:40,979 --> 00:30:46,739
of the impossible, the God who simply spoke and it was.

434
00:30:46,739 --> 00:30:48,559
He loves us so much.

435
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:52,459
He desires to have fellowship with each and every one of us.

436
00:30:52,459 --> 00:30:54,979
What a unique privilege that is.

437
00:30:54,979 --> 00:31:02,139
And through the book of 1 John, we'll find that this thought of fellowship, this truth

438
00:31:02,139 --> 00:31:06,279
of fellowship is developed throughout the study of the book.

439
00:31:06,279 --> 00:31:09,860
And how joyful it is that we can have fellowship with God.

440
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:15,379
Indeed, there are times in which our fellowship is hindered.

441
00:31:15,379 --> 00:31:17,579
Have you experienced that in your life?

442
00:31:17,579 --> 00:31:19,180
Our fellowship can be hindered.

443
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:23,459
Our fellowship can be hindered with those that we have relationships with here on earth,

444
00:31:23,459 --> 00:31:24,540
correct?

445
00:31:25,099 --> 00:31:27,819
We can have hindered relationships with a spouse, we can have hindered relationships

446
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:28,819
with a sibling.

447
00:31:28,819 --> 00:31:29,819
Sibling rivalry, right?

448
00:31:29,819 --> 00:31:34,579
We'll talk about that tonight, actually, Jacob and Esau, amen.

449
00:31:34,579 --> 00:31:36,220
And what a dysfunctional family.

450
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:38,180
Anyway, we'll get to that tonight.

451
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:43,459
The reality, however, is that, listen, we can have relationship with somebody here on

452
00:31:43,459 --> 00:31:46,579
earth and have hindered fellowship with them.

453
00:31:46,579 --> 00:31:49,899
And we can have relationship with God, but have hindered fellowship.

454
00:31:49,899 --> 00:31:51,500
John deals with that.

455
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:55,099
He tells us how that we can have that fellowship restored.

456
00:31:55,099 --> 00:31:57,220
Isn't that wonderful?

457
00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:03,659
What tragedy it would be if that fellowship was hindered, but there was no way back.

458
00:32:03,659 --> 00:32:04,860
But there is a way back.

459
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:05,860
Why?

460
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:11,099
Because our God is gracious and He's merciful and He's ready to pardon and ready to forgive.

461
00:32:11,099 --> 00:32:15,619
And we'll see those themes develop throughout the book of 1 John.

462
00:32:15,619 --> 00:32:21,020
So we find the credibility of the witness, the content of the witness, but I want you

463
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:26,339
to see as we close this morning in verse number four, I want you to note the purpose

464
00:32:26,339 --> 00:32:28,619
of this witness.

465
00:32:28,619 --> 00:32:38,739
Notice he says it very simply, and these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full.

466
00:32:38,739 --> 00:32:43,139
I want you to keep that in mind, but turn to the book of John in the 20th chapter, and

467
00:32:43,139 --> 00:32:46,699
I want you to see, hold your place in 1 John, we're going to come right back, but I want

468
00:32:46,699 --> 00:32:52,739
you to see what it says in John 20.

469
00:32:52,739 --> 00:32:57,220
He says here in 1 John, and these things write we unto you, why?

470
00:32:57,220 --> 00:33:01,739
The purpose is stated, that your joy may be full.

471
00:33:01,739 --> 00:33:07,199
Notice in the gospel of John in chapter number 20, he says this in verse number 30, and many

472
00:33:07,199 --> 00:33:11,459
other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of His disciples, which are not written in

473
00:33:11,459 --> 00:33:13,500
this book.

474
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,779
But these are written.

475
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:16,860
Why?

476
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:22,899
That you might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you might

477
00:33:22,899 --> 00:33:25,539
have life through His name.

478
00:33:25,539 --> 00:33:27,739
Do we understand the purpose of the gospel of John?

479
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:32,179
Yeah, the purpose of the gospel of John is that you might believe that Jesus is the Christ,

480
00:33:32,179 --> 00:33:36,459
that He is the Son of God, and that as you believe that and receive that, that you have

481
00:33:36,459 --> 00:33:40,419
eternal life through His name.

482
00:33:40,419 --> 00:33:44,660
The purpose, as it's stated in 1 John, He's writing to believers.

483
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:51,779
It's always helpful to understand the audience, the recipients, because He does not say here

484
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:56,139
in 1 John 1 that I'm writing these things unto you so that you would believe that you

485
00:33:56,139 --> 00:34:00,819
would know that Jesus is the Christ, but He says, I'm writing these things unto you that

486
00:34:00,819 --> 00:34:05,819
your joy may be full, that your joy may be full.

487
00:34:06,139 --> 00:34:15,099
Listen, there are times in which our joy tank isn't full.

488
00:34:15,099 --> 00:34:19,660
We're running on fumes, so to speak, running on empty.

489
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:24,779
Somebody said this and I do not like the statement whatsoever, fake it until you make it.

490
00:34:24,779 --> 00:34:26,959
That's nonsense.

491
00:34:26,959 --> 00:34:27,959
You know what that is?

492
00:34:27,959 --> 00:34:31,100
That's fleshly.

493
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:37,299
I shouldn't have to fake it when I understand the source of joy, right?

494
00:34:37,299 --> 00:34:39,820
It's not fake it until you make it.

495
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:44,179
That's carnal and fleshly.

496
00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:49,299
He says, these things write we unto you that your joy may be full.

497
00:34:49,299 --> 00:34:53,179
Now, I want you to think about this as we close this morning.

498
00:34:53,179 --> 00:34:55,179
What would cause my joy to be full?

499
00:34:55,179 --> 00:34:59,700
Well, number one, joy is the result of salvation.

500
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:02,660
It is a byproduct of salvation.

501
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:07,019
And we find that He said, when we looked at the content, two of the truths that will be

502
00:35:07,019 --> 00:35:10,679
developed, the themes, if you will, that will be developed through the book, is that of

503
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:13,940
eternal life, the source and the security.

504
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:18,459
And so we think about that big theme, if you will, that's developed here and having the

505
00:35:18,459 --> 00:35:23,380
knowledge that you belong to Christ, that should cause you to have fullness of joy.

506
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,380
Amen?

507
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,779
I belong to Him.

508
00:35:25,779 --> 00:35:27,899
I am His and He is mine.

509
00:35:27,899 --> 00:35:30,700
He will never leave me nor forsake me.

510
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:33,540
In Luke chapter number 10, you don't need to turn there, but in Luke chapter number

511
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:39,459
10, the disciples come back, and He'd sent out these 70, and they come back, and we find

512
00:35:39,459 --> 00:35:41,739
that they're coming back and they're rejoicing.

513
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:46,220
They come back with joy, and they say, even the devils are subject unto us through thy

514
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:47,220
name.

515
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,619
And I mean, they're excited about it.

516
00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:54,419
And Jesus says this in Luke 10 and verse number 20, notwithstanding in this, rejoice not that

517
00:35:54,419 --> 00:35:58,299
the spirits are subject unto you, but rather rejoice, why?

518
00:35:58,299 --> 00:36:00,980
Because your names are written in heaven.

519
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:05,239
I want you to think about that for a moment.

520
00:36:05,239 --> 00:36:09,779
We sing the song, there's a new name written down in glory, and it's mine.

521
00:36:09,779 --> 00:36:12,380
Oh, yes, it's mine, right?

522
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:18,019
And as we sing that song, I hope for you the same way for me, I remember back as I'm singing

523
00:36:18,019 --> 00:36:21,660
that song to the day in which I trust that Christ is my Savior.

524
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:25,980
I'm thinking back to the day in which my name was written down in glory, the day in

525
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:31,299
which I trust at Christ, and the reality is that Jesus says, listen, what should be the

526
00:36:31,299 --> 00:36:37,260
real cause of your rejoice is that your name is written in the book of heaven, the book

527
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,260
of life.

528
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:41,100
And you think about that this morning.

529
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,859
Who can take your name out of that book?

530
00:36:43,859 --> 00:36:47,419
You can't even take your name out of the book.

531
00:36:47,419 --> 00:36:53,700
And the reality is that that security that we have in Christ that will be developed throughout

532
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:58,339
this book, He says these things, and these things write we unto you, what?

533
00:36:58,339 --> 00:37:02,380
That your joy may be full.

534
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:08,760
You know, someone that does not know the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal Savior, certainly

535
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:14,820
they may have some periods of happiness in their life, but happiness and joy are really

536
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:17,579
not synonymous one with the other.

537
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:20,820
There's a distinct difference between the two.

538
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:25,619
Because we can be living...happiness, I would say this, is based on our happenings, if I

539
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:28,500
could use that phraseology.

540
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,660
Why do they call Disney the happiest place on earth?

541
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:34,500
Honestly, I have no idea.

542
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,899
I've been there.

543
00:37:36,899 --> 00:37:42,019
I've been there pre-COVID when there's 8,000 people trying to stand in line for one line

544
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:47,820
to one ride, and it's 900 degrees, and the sun is beating down on you, and it's the happiest

545
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:48,820
place on earth.

546
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:52,540
And I'm like, man, there's a lot of places I can think of that would cause more happiness

547
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:55,940
than this.

548
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:59,139
I'm just being honest.

549
00:37:59,139 --> 00:38:02,700
If Disney gets a hold of the video, they're not going to like what I said, amen?

550
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,859
It's all good.

551
00:38:04,859 --> 00:38:10,339
But the reality is that happiness typically is based on our happenings.

552
00:38:10,339 --> 00:38:13,100
Joy is different.

553
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,299
It's well within us.

554
00:38:14,299 --> 00:38:17,179
It's something that God gives us.

555
00:38:17,179 --> 00:38:20,299
No man taketh your joy, right?

556
00:38:20,299 --> 00:38:22,260
It's what the Word of God tells us.

557
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:27,540
And we can be dealing with some of the most adverse circumstances on this earth, some

558
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:33,959
of the hardest trials that we've ever faced, and have joy.

559
00:38:33,959 --> 00:38:40,179
We can face the most intense and the most severe storm, we can have peace and we can

560
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:42,020
have joy.

561
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:46,020
It's completely different than happiness.

562
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:50,260
Joy is the result of salvation.

563
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:55,539
David said this in Psalm 51, his great psalm of repentance.

564
00:38:55,539 --> 00:39:04,419
He says, restore unto me the joy of thy salvation.

565
00:39:04,419 --> 00:39:09,539
He did not say, restore unto me salvation, he didn't lose it, but he certainly lost the

566
00:39:09,539 --> 00:39:11,539
joy of his salvation.

567
00:39:11,539 --> 00:39:13,260
You know why he lost the joy of his salvation?

568
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:18,099
Because sin robs you of your joy.

569
00:39:18,099 --> 00:39:21,419
And so we find here that he says that your joy may be full.

570
00:39:21,419 --> 00:39:25,659
Number one, joy is the result of salvation, but then I would say this, number two, that

571
00:39:25,659 --> 00:39:27,219
joy is the result of fellowship.

572
00:39:27,219 --> 00:39:31,559
It's the result of fellowship, of that godly living.

573
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:35,059
We mentioned that in verse number seven, the theme that we have, walking in the light,

574
00:39:35,059 --> 00:39:38,779
that if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship one with another

575
00:39:38,779 --> 00:39:42,299
in the blood of Jesus Christ, His Son cleanseth us from all sin.

576
00:39:42,299 --> 00:39:47,099
We understand that that walk in the light or walking in the light, we said this last

577
00:39:47,099 --> 00:39:51,580
week, could be synonymous with obedient, godly living.

578
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:57,320
And you know that when we're saved and we have the joy of the Lord, it's our strength,

579
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:01,219
we have joy because our names are written in heaven, but there's a joy that we have

580
00:40:01,219 --> 00:40:02,099
in obedient living.

581
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:08,339
living, because to him that knoweth to do right and doeth it not, to him it is sin.

582
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:09,339
And D.L.

583
00:40:09,339 --> 00:40:12,699
Moody said this, sin will keep you from this book, or this book will keep you from sin,

584
00:40:12,699 --> 00:40:14,599
referring to the Bible.

585
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:18,619
And I would submit to you this morning that one of the ways that we lose our joy as God's

586
00:40:18,619 --> 00:40:21,339
people is by sinning.

587
00:40:21,339 --> 00:40:23,099
It robs us of our joy.

588
00:40:23,099 --> 00:40:24,099
We're not right with God.

589
00:40:24,099 --> 00:40:25,099
We're not walking with God.

590
00:40:25,099 --> 00:40:26,919
We're not in fellowship with God.

591
00:40:26,919 --> 00:40:32,199
And his presence, the psalmist said in Psalm 1611, is fullness of joy.

592
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:36,999
So there's a joy that's the result of salvation, and I'm so thankful for that joy, that source

593
00:40:36,999 --> 00:40:42,639
of joy is now there with me, within me, but the reality is that it also is a result of

594
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:43,639
our fellowship.

595
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:48,259
And so when we think about the content of the testimony that he gives, and then he tells

596
00:40:48,259 --> 00:40:56,159
us the purpose, these things right we unto you, that your joy may be full.

597
00:40:56,159 --> 00:41:01,919
Now, of God, he never designed it that you'd run on fumes.

598
00:41:01,919 --> 00:41:07,159
That you'd be almost at empty, but that your joy would be full.

599
00:41:07,159 --> 00:41:09,719
Notice if you will, we'll quickly look at a few verses of Scripture.

600
00:41:09,719 --> 00:41:11,999
Turn to John 15.

601
00:41:11,999 --> 00:41:15,199
Look at a couple of verses here in John 15 and 16, and then we'll make a reference to

602
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:17,599
the book of Galatians and be done this morning.

603
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:21,719
John 15.

604
00:41:21,719 --> 00:41:29,699
Joy is the result of salvation, but joy is also the result of fellowship, of godly living.

605
00:41:29,699 --> 00:41:34,079
We find that in John 15, and beginning in verse 10, the Bible says this,

606
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:35,079
15.

607
00:41:35,079 --> 00:41:38,819
If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love, even as I have kept my Father's

608
00:41:38,819 --> 00:41:41,159
commandments and abide in His love.

609
00:41:41,159 --> 00:41:46,399
These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your

610
00:41:46,399 --> 00:41:48,279
joy might be full.

611
00:41:48,279 --> 00:41:50,079
Isn't that amazing?

612
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:56,439
How similar what he heard Jesus say is now what he's declaring.

613
00:41:56,439 --> 00:41:58,839
By the way, that's what Jesus tells him at the end of John 15.

614
00:41:58,839 --> 00:42:01,039
We looked at it earlier in verse number 27.

615
00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:06,159
We find that Jesus is saying, I've spoken these things unto you, that my joy might remain

616
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:08,519
in you, and that your joy might be full.

617
00:42:08,519 --> 00:42:09,519
What was it?

618
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:11,759
He says, if ye keep my commandments, ye abide in my love.

619
00:42:11,759 --> 00:42:16,359
Notice in verse number 12, this is my commandment, that ye love one another as I have loved you.

620
00:42:16,359 --> 00:42:20,879
Notice verse number 14, ye are my friends if you do whatsoever I have commanded you.

621
00:42:20,879 --> 00:42:24,359
You know, in the book of 1 John, as we go throughout the entirety of the book, you'll

622
00:42:24,359 --> 00:42:31,039
find that there are many references to walking and obeying the Lord Jesus Christ, and having

623
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:34,239
that fellowship results in joy.

624
00:42:34,239 --> 00:42:37,439
Let's just be honest with one another this morning.

625
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:42,319
When I'm not walking in fellowship with God, my joy suffers.

626
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:47,639
I'm not as joyful when I'm not walking with God as I am when I am walking with God.

627
00:42:47,639 --> 00:42:52,439
And if you'd be honest and evaluate your life this morning, you'd say, yeah, I've experienced

628
00:42:52,439 --> 00:42:55,359
that.

629
00:42:55,359 --> 00:43:05,599
Notice in John 16, in verse number 24, hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name.

630
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:09,239
Ask and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.

631
00:43:09,239 --> 00:43:14,959
You think about the prayer and prayer being answered.

632
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:18,839
The Bible says, if I regard iniquity in Psalm 66 and verse 18 in my heart, the Lord will

633
00:43:18,839 --> 00:43:19,839
not hear me.

634
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:22,719
It's not that He can't hear you.

635
00:43:22,719 --> 00:43:28,679
He can hear us, and so that sin hinders our fellowship with Him and hinders His answering

636
00:43:28,679 --> 00:43:29,679
to us.

637
00:43:29,679 --> 00:43:34,039
And here He says this, when you think about that praying, you know praying is a result

638
00:43:34,039 --> 00:43:37,159
of being in fellowship, right?

639
00:43:37,159 --> 00:43:41,319
Let me ask you, don't answer me, please don't answer me, but let me ask you to think about

640
00:43:41,319 --> 00:43:42,719
this personally in your life.

641
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:47,799
If there's some hindrance between you and your spouse, and there's some contention between

642
00:43:47,799 --> 00:43:52,999
you, and your fellowship has been hindered, how's your communication?

643
00:43:52,999 --> 00:43:57,319
Not great, because your fellowship's been hindered, right?

644
00:43:57,319 --> 00:44:00,879
So therefore, your communication suffers.

645
00:44:00,879 --> 00:44:03,959
Is that valid?

646
00:44:03,959 --> 00:44:06,479
So what happens in our walk with God?

647
00:44:06,479 --> 00:44:11,879
When our fellowship is hindered, our communication is also hindered.

648
00:44:11,879 --> 00:44:13,559
How do we communicate with God?

649
00:44:13,559 --> 00:44:14,559
Through prayer.

650
00:44:14,559 --> 00:44:18,919
My prayer life isn't what it's supposed to be if I'm not in fellowship with God, right?

651
00:44:18,919 --> 00:44:21,039
And neither is yours.

652
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:25,599
And so the byproduct of that fellowship is that communication.

653
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:31,159
And so we find here that He talks about your joy being full, how it results in the ask

654
00:44:31,159 --> 00:44:33,039
and ye shall receive that your joy may be full.

655
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:35,959
We'll turn to the book of Galatians, and we'll end there.

656
00:44:35,959 --> 00:44:40,799
In Galatians chapter number 5, the Bible speaks about the fruit of the Spirit.

657
00:44:40,799 --> 00:44:43,479
He talks about the works of the flesh.

658
00:44:43,479 --> 00:44:48,879
He talks about the fact that the flesh and the Spirit are enmity one with the other.

659
00:44:48,879 --> 00:44:50,739
But then He lists out the fruit of the Spirit.

660
00:44:50,739 --> 00:44:56,599
He describes it with all of these different descriptive terms that are so powerful, really

661
00:44:56,599 --> 00:45:02,119
you note that He says the fruit of the Spirit, singular, it's not plural, it's singular,

662
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:06,639
but here's how the fruit of the Spirit is described.

663
00:45:06,639 --> 00:45:13,559
These are the descriptive terms that help us understand the fruit of the Spirit, love,

664
00:45:13,559 --> 00:45:21,719
joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance, against such

665
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:24,199
there is no law.

666
00:45:24,199 --> 00:45:26,479
How do we have the fruit of the Spirit?

667
00:45:26,479 --> 00:45:29,599
As we walk in the Spirit, right?

668
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:30,839
What is walking in the Spirit?

669
00:45:31,559 --> 00:45:36,919
Well, it's the same, really similar to walking in the light.

670
00:45:36,919 --> 00:45:39,599
And so we have this joy.

671
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:43,759
He says, I want you to understand the purpose of the testimony that I'm giving.

672
00:45:43,759 --> 00:45:51,719
I'm writing these things to you that your joy may be full.

673
00:45:51,719 --> 00:45:55,199
I want my joy tank to be full.

674
00:45:55,199 --> 00:45:59,559
It starts with salvation.

675
00:45:59,559 --> 00:46:04,199
Because if our names are written in the book of life, we ought to rejoice.

676
00:46:04,199 --> 00:46:08,959
Doesn't matter what happens, it doesn't matter how hard the day is, it doesn't matter how

677
00:46:08,959 --> 00:46:13,879
many people say whatever they say, I'm going to heaven.

678
00:46:13,879 --> 00:46:19,039
Can't wait, we say to the kids, we sing with them, going to see Jesus, can't wait, right?

679
00:46:19,039 --> 00:46:22,399
A little song that we sing with the kids.

680
00:46:22,399 --> 00:46:26,379
Listen, Deon Moody said some guy pulled a gun on him.

681
00:46:26,379 --> 00:46:28,919
He said, you can't threaten me with heaven.

682
00:46:28,919 --> 00:46:30,359
I love it.

683
00:46:30,359 --> 00:46:33,239
I don't know that I'd say it.

684
00:46:33,239 --> 00:46:37,919
But that's what he said.

685
00:46:37,919 --> 00:46:45,239
Listen, at the end of the day, no matter what happens, we're going to heaven.

686
00:46:45,239 --> 00:46:47,799
It's my long home, amen?

687
00:46:47,799 --> 00:46:50,799
For all of eternity, I'm going to be with my Savior.

688
00:46:50,799 --> 00:46:53,719
That should cause us to have joy.

689
00:46:53,719 --> 00:46:58,319
And as we walk in fellowship with Him, we have joy.

690
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:00,959
In His presence is fullness of joy.

691
00:47:00,959 --> 00:47:03,479
So we see the credibility.

692
00:47:03,479 --> 00:47:09,439
John says as he gets up on the witness stand, listen, yes, I'm a disciple.

693
00:47:09,439 --> 00:47:12,479
Yes, I'm in the inner circle.

694
00:47:12,479 --> 00:47:19,039
I have heard, I have seen, I have handled of the Word of life.

695
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:22,919
The content, we're going to talk about salvation.

696
00:47:22,919 --> 00:47:30,279
We're going to talk about eternal life, the source, and the security, and the whole purpose

697
00:47:30,279 --> 00:47:33,159
is that your joy might be full.

698
00:47:33,159 --> 00:47:40,839
Oh, that we live as joyful people, that truly the joy of the Lord would be our strength,

699
00:47:40,839 --> 00:47:45,959
and that we'd rejoice greatly because we belong to Him and because we walk with Him.

700
00:47:45,959 --> 00:47:46,959
Let's pray.

701
00:47:46,959 --> 00:47:47,959
Father, we love You.

702
00:47:47,959 --> 00:47:48,959
Thank You for loving us.

703
00:47:48,959 --> 00:47:50,799
I thank You for the Word of God.

704
00:47:50,799 --> 00:47:57,519
I thank You for the truth of these four verses and how impactful they are in my life, and

705
00:47:57,519 --> 00:48:01,679
I trust in the lives of those that are gathered here this morning.

706
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:07,679
If there'd be one present, one that's tuned in, that's never trusted the Lord Jesus Christ

707
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:12,839
as their personal Savior, I pray that today they would trust Christ.

708
00:48:12,839 --> 00:48:17,439
Oh, we pray that the Holy Spirit of God would convict them of their sin and convince them

709
00:48:17,439 --> 00:48:22,159
of Christ's righteousness and of judgment to come, that they would place their faith

710
00:48:22,159 --> 00:48:27,679
and trust in the finished work of Christ at Calvary, that their names would be written

711
00:48:27,679 --> 00:48:32,279
in the book of life, they might have joy and fellowship.

712
00:48:32,279 --> 00:48:43,519
God, I pray for each child of God as we evaluate our lives, perhaps if we would take time to

713
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:48,799
evaluate and be honest with ourselves and with You, there are times in which our joy

714
00:48:48,799 --> 00:48:52,719
tank is not full.

715
00:48:52,719 --> 00:48:57,639
There are times in which we're living under the circumstances.

716
00:48:57,639 --> 00:49:05,719
There are times in which we have believed that little statement that I mentioned that

717
00:49:05,719 --> 00:49:09,359
I disagree with, fake it till you make it.

718
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:12,559
There's no reason to fake it.

719
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:20,039
God, I pray that if our fellowship's been hindered because of some sin, it'd help us

720
00:49:20,039 --> 00:49:26,559
to see that fellowship restored, that we might have fullness of joy, that our joy would be

721
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:29,039
full.

722
00:49:29,039 --> 00:49:41,639
Indeed, Your people, we, should be the most joyful people in all the world.

723
00:49:41,639 --> 00:49:47,119
I pray that You'd move and work as only You can, that decisions would be made that would

724
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:53,679
please Thee, that would cause us to be conformed to the image of Christ and impact eternity.

725
00:49:53,679 --> 00:49:57,159
Well, thank You for all that You'll do, for it's in Christ's name we pray.

726
00:49:57,159 --> 00:49:58,919
Would You stand with me?

727
00:49:58,919 --> 00:50:02,119
As your bowed eyes are closed, Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano.

728
00:50:02,119 --> 00:50:05,479
At the end of our service, we have an opportunity for you to respond.

729
00:50:05,479 --> 00:50:10,479
Come to the altar, make your pew and altar, and ask the Lord to speak to your heart, or

730
00:50:10,479 --> 00:50:12,959
you respond to how the Lord has spoken to your heart.

731
00:50:12,959 --> 00:50:14,959
I'll say, yes, Lord, yes.

732
00:50:14,959 --> 00:50:16,279
Help me to have that fellowship.

733
00:50:16,279 --> 00:50:21,399
Acknowledge that the fellowship is hindered, that the joy is not what it should be, and

734
00:50:21,399 --> 00:50:22,539
have that restored.

735
00:50:22,539 --> 00:50:24,159
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
