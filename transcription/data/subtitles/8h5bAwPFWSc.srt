1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,440
18, Exodus chapter number 18,

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,039
and really this morning,

3
00:00:04,039 --> 00:00:07,980
we'll be transitioning into phase two of our annual theme,

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:09,600
our theme for this year.

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,039
As you know, you see on the banners there,

6
00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:14,520
great is the Lord, and then it says this,

7
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,879
and greatly to be praised, Psalm 48, verse number one.

8
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:19,600
We've been singing as our theme song,

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,760
Psalm 48, one and two all year.

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,479
And the first part, the phase one, if you will,

11
00:00:25,479 --> 00:00:27,459
for our annual theme this year,

12
00:00:27,459 --> 00:00:29,000
has really been dealing with the idea

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,700
of discovering God's greatness.

14
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,659
Each of us would, I believe,

15
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:36,419
agree this morning that our God is great.

16
00:00:36,419 --> 00:00:39,040
We wanna be able to have some substance

17
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,119
as to why we would make that claim.

18
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:43,220
Why is it that we would tell somebody else

19
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,060
that our God is great?

20
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,419
What sets him apart?

21
00:00:46,419 --> 00:00:49,459
And so as we've studied for all of these months,

22
00:00:49,459 --> 00:00:51,979
and we've looked at so many various subjects

23
00:00:51,979 --> 00:00:54,380
and passages of scripture, topics,

24
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,619
as to why our God is great,

25
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,479
and we've discovered God's greatness,

26
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:03,319
phase two is going to be this, declare God's greatness.

27
00:01:03,319 --> 00:01:05,000
And you'll remember with me

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,680
as we began studying this year with this theme

29
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,760
that I made note that the psalmist

30
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,879
made two powerful statements really

31
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:16,879
with regard to the greatness of God

32
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:19,639
as it relates to our theme for this year.

33
00:01:19,639 --> 00:01:22,540
And one of those is in Psalm 135, in verse number five,

34
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,800
where the psalmist said this,

35
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,339
for I know that the Lord is great,

36
00:01:26,339 --> 00:01:28,440
that our Lord is above all gods.

37
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,379
Each and every individual, every child of God

38
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:33,099
needs to know and be fully persuaded

39
00:01:33,099 --> 00:01:35,819
in their own heart and mind that God is great.

40
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:38,660
And we ought to be able to say with the psalmist,

41
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:42,699
for I know that the Lord is great.

42
00:01:42,699 --> 00:01:44,440
God wants us to know his greatness.

43
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,260
He has given us his precious word.

44
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:50,980
He's revealed to us his character, his nature,

45
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,839
and he helps us to understand how great he is.

46
00:01:54,839 --> 00:01:57,360
But then in Psalm 145, in verse number six,

47
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,680
the psalmist makes that second statement

48
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,639
that is so impactful with regard to our theme for this year.

49
00:02:03,639 --> 00:02:05,220
And at the end of that verse of scripture,

50
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:10,220
the psalmist says this, and I will declare thy greatness.

51
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,600
I will declare thy greatness.

52
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,479
Near the end of the year,

53
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:17,279
we'll get into phase three of our series

54
00:02:17,279 --> 00:02:19,460
for this particular annual theme.

55
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:22,500
And phase one, discover God's greatness.

56
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,220
Phase two, declare God's greatness.

57
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,899
And then we're gonna deal with a number of messages,

58
00:02:25,899 --> 00:02:29,580
just a handful of messages on this thought of living

59
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:34,059
and how we live understanding how great our God is,

60
00:02:34,059 --> 00:02:36,500
living in light of God's greatness.

61
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,259
You know, when I understand how great God is,

62
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:39,979
it's gonna impact how I pray.

63
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,179
When I understand how great God is,

64
00:02:43,179 --> 00:02:45,020
so we're gonna deal with that at the end of the year.

65
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,419
But for a number of weeks now,

66
00:02:46,419 --> 00:02:48,360
we're going to look at this second phase

67
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,440
and dealing with the subject of declaring God's greatness.

68
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,240
As we look to Exodus chapter 18,

69
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,080
I want us to consider this morning

70
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,320
the proclamation of Jethro.

71
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,639
The Bible begins in verse number one,

72
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:03,559
when Jethro the priest of Midian, Moses' father-in-law,

73
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:07,720
heard of all that God had done for Moses and for Israel,

74
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,679
his people, and that the Lord had brought Israel

75
00:03:10,679 --> 00:03:12,119
out of Egypt.

76
00:03:12,119 --> 00:03:14,440
Then Jethro, Moses' father-in-law,

77
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,820
took Zipporah, Moses' wife,

78
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,259
after he had sent her back, and her two sons,

79
00:03:19,259 --> 00:03:21,479
of which the name of the one was Gershom,

80
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:24,779
for he said, I have been an alien in a strange land,

81
00:03:24,779 --> 00:03:27,059
verse four, and the name of the other was Eleazar,

82
00:03:27,059 --> 00:03:30,539
for the God of my father said he was mine help

83
00:03:30,539 --> 00:03:33,740
and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh.

84
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:36,100
And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law,

85
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,460
came with the sons and his wife unto Moses

86
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:41,940
into the wilderness, where he encamped at the Mount of God.

87
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,059
And he said unto Moses, I, thy father-in-law,

88
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,520
Jethro, come unto thee and thy wife

89
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,679
and her two sons with her.

90
00:03:48,679 --> 00:03:51,639
And Moses went out to meet his father-in-law

91
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:54,000
and did obeisance and kissed him,

92
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
and they asked each other of their welfare,

93
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,919
and notice it says they came into the tent.

94
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:01,399
We'll study down through verse number 12 this morning

95
00:04:01,399 --> 00:04:03,320
as we look at this text of scripture,

96
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,679
as we're studying this thought,

97
00:04:04,679 --> 00:04:06,279
the proclamation of Jethro.

98
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:08,559
If you are taking notes, number one this morning,

99
00:04:08,559 --> 00:04:12,080
I want you to notice with me the reunion with Jethro.

100
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,279
The reunion with Jethro,

101
00:04:13,279 --> 00:04:14,940
if you were to go back to Exodus chapter number four,

102
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,500
we won't do it for sake of time.

103
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,420
But if you go back this morning to Exodus four

104
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:22,980
in verse number 18, God gives us in that verse of scripture

105
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:27,820
the last recorded interaction between Moses and Jethro.

106
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:31,100
And Moses, after he had been called by God,

107
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,940
after he saw God and God gave him all of the instruction

108
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,980
that he gave him, the commission, if you will,

109
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,859
in Exodus chapter number three,

110
00:04:38,859 --> 00:04:42,299
we find that Moses is going to respond in obedience.

111
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,880
He's going to go as God had given him

112
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,399
the instruction to do so.

113
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:48,600
And we find that in the fourth chapter of the book

114
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,320
of Exodus, we find that that interaction,

115
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,559
that last recorded interaction is provided to us

116
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:57,399
with regard to Moses and Jethro.

117
00:04:57,399 --> 00:04:59,600
Moses would leave, and now we understand

118
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,480
that between his departure in chapter number four

119
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,160
and where we are here in Exodus chapter number 18

120
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,119
this morning, a lot of things have taken place.

121
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:13,980
A lot of amazing things have taken place in between.

122
00:05:14,559 --> 00:05:17,420
The chapters that we're not noticeably looking at

123
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,540
this morning, but we find that we'll make reference

124
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,739
to them in summary.

125
00:05:21,739 --> 00:05:25,100
And so we find that Jethro, while he was still in Midian,

126
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,959
it's quite interesting, in verse number one,

127
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:31,100
the Bible tells us that Jethro heard something.

128
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:35,679
Notice the Bible says that he heard of all that God

129
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,859
had done for Moses and for Israel, his people,

130
00:05:39,859 --> 00:05:43,700
and that the Lord had brought Israel out of Egypt.

131
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:47,420
And so Jethro receives, he has this understanding

132
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,660
of what's taking place.

133
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,760
It's piqued his interest, so to speak.

134
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,100
We find that the children of Israel have been delivered

135
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,859
from Egyptian bondage after all of the plagues.

136
00:05:56,859 --> 00:06:00,140
And we find that the Bible then tells us of the journey

137
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:03,500
that would take place in verses two through five

138
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:08,040
where Jethro, Zipporah, Gershom, and Eleazar

139
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,399
would travel to the place where Moses was camped

140
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:13,519
according to verse number five.

141
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:15,179
And we find that as we look at this,

142
00:06:15,179 --> 00:06:18,279
it's very interesting to note that the Bible does not tell us

143
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:22,119
in verse number one that Jethro heard what Moses did.

144
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:28,480
No, the Bible says that Jethro heard of all that God

145
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,399
had done for Moses.

146
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:33,820
I'm thankful that God used Moses,

147
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,179
but it was God that was at work.

148
00:06:36,179 --> 00:06:38,779
It was God that was performing the miracles.

149
00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:41,339
It was God that was providing for his children.

150
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:43,260
It was God that was leading them.

151
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,179
And in your life and in my life,

152
00:06:45,179 --> 00:06:47,299
it's just like we look at in the New Testament

153
00:06:47,299 --> 00:06:49,019
with John three in verse number 30,

154
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:50,179
where John the Baptist said,

155
00:06:50,179 --> 00:06:52,420
he must increase and I must decrease.

156
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:55,299
It's not about Moses, it's about Jehovah God.

157
00:06:55,299 --> 00:06:57,059
It's not about you, it's not about me.

158
00:06:57,059 --> 00:06:59,459
It's about the Lord God Almighty.

159
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,600
And what Midian heard, I love the verbiage here,

160
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,880
is the Bible says that he heard of all

161
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,559
that God had done for Moses.

162
00:07:09,559 --> 00:07:12,920
Praise the Lord that God was at work

163
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:17,079
and word gets back to Midian, word gets back to Jethro.

164
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:19,519
And now I mentioned this, that it piqued his interest.

165
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:22,559
I find that as I look at these next verses of scripture,

166
00:07:22,559 --> 00:07:25,040
the journey that would be embarked upon

167
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,279
is they would determine, I wanna go.

168
00:07:27,299 --> 00:07:28,899
And in fact, in verse number seven,

169
00:07:28,899 --> 00:07:30,859
the Bible says that as they greet one another

170
00:07:30,859 --> 00:07:34,660
and we would see that the greeting is that custom greeting

171
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:38,980
for that particular society and culture.

172
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:43,459
The Bible says that they asked each other of their welfare.

173
00:07:43,459 --> 00:07:46,220
There's an interest, there's a desire

174
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:49,019
to be able to understand some more of what's going on.

175
00:07:49,019 --> 00:07:51,459
And then I want you to notice that the Bible tells us

176
00:07:51,459 --> 00:07:54,179
as we consider the reunion with Jethro,

177
00:07:54,179 --> 00:07:57,019
that the Bible tells us at the end of verse number seven,

178
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,880
and they came into the tent.

179
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,679
Now the tent is the house, right?

180
00:08:02,679 --> 00:08:04,399
And we understand this morning,

181
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:06,559
if we were to look at our society today,

182
00:08:06,559 --> 00:08:09,760
and we're to think of trying to make application,

183
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,079
someone comes from a distance,

184
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:12,700
they've heard that God was at work,

185
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,320
that God was doing some things,

186
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,399
and they greet us and we have this greeting.

187
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:18,880
And then we say, come on into my house.

188
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,619
And they didn't just stay outside,

189
00:08:20,619 --> 00:08:23,760
no, they went into the tent and they're gonna go there.

190
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,640
And the Bible tells us, verse number eight,

191
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,220
it's interesting to me, it's one verse of scripture,

192
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,679
but I think it took a while.

193
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:32,260
We can read this verse of scripture

194
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,099
in just a couple of seconds.

195
00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:39,020
But I think that the time that verse eight actually covers

196
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:42,260
was ours, was ours.

197
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,619
And I begin to think about what's taking place here.

198
00:08:44,619 --> 00:08:46,260
And we noticed the reunion with Jethro,

199
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,099
if you're taking notes number two this morning,

200
00:08:48,099 --> 00:08:49,780
the report from Moses.

201
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:52,099
Verse number eight provides us with the report

202
00:08:52,099 --> 00:08:55,340
that Moses would deliver to his father-in-law Jethro.

203
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:57,320
The Bible says this in verse number eight,

204
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,599
and Moses told his father-in-law,

205
00:08:59,599 --> 00:09:01,559
notice that little word all.

206
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,679
Did you see it?

207
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:06,960
The Bible says that Moses told his father-in-law

208
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,760
all that the Lord had done.

209
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,919
Unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake.

210
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:17,679
And so we see the first part, phase one, if you will,

211
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:21,880
part one of this report is the plagues in Egypt.

212
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,359
That's the first part of this report

213
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,500
that Moses is going to deliver to Jethro.

214
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,340
And we see that the Bible says that he told him all.

215
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,020
I don't believe this morning

216
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:35,260
that Moses just simply summarized everything and said,

217
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,299
well, look, God just worked real big.

218
00:09:37,299 --> 00:09:38,700
I mean, God did some amazing things.

219
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,520
No, I think Moses was giving them details.

220
00:09:42,979 --> 00:09:45,020
And he's sharing with them what God did

221
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:48,659
and how God was moving and how God was showing his power

222
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:50,419
and how God was showing his might.

223
00:09:50,419 --> 00:09:53,260
I think he took time to go through each of the plagues.

224
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,640
I think he dealt with the fact

225
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,080
that there was a separation between the Egyptians

226
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,039
and the children of Israel,

227
00:09:58,039 --> 00:10:01,039
that there were certain plagues that affected the Egyptians.

228
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:03,399
but did not affect the children of Israel.

229
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:07,479
I think that Moses provided those kinds of details.

230
00:10:08,599 --> 00:10:10,159
You ever hear somebody give you a report

231
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:12,639
and they provide some information

232
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:14,199
and sometimes we say,

233
00:10:14,199 --> 00:10:17,179
hold on, tell me a little bit more about that.

234
00:10:17,179 --> 00:10:19,039
You kind of just skipped over that.

235
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:21,319
You kind of just summarized that part of it.

236
00:10:21,319 --> 00:10:23,279
But I want to know the details.

237
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,039
And some people are very detailed oriented.

238
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:28,119
If I tell my mom a story, she's here this morning,

239
00:10:28,119 --> 00:10:29,599
she wants all the details.

240
00:10:29,599 --> 00:10:30,719
She doesn't want the summary.

241
00:10:30,719 --> 00:10:31,999
She wants to know the details.

242
00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:33,319
And I appreciate that.

243
00:10:33,319 --> 00:10:34,599
And there's some people that are saying,

244
00:10:34,599 --> 00:10:36,599
just give me the summary.

245
00:10:36,599 --> 00:10:38,199
I just read the end notes.

246
00:10:38,199 --> 00:10:40,039
No, no, but some people want the details.

247
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:42,119
And I think that this reunion,

248
00:10:42,119 --> 00:10:45,039
that begins there in those verses,

249
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:46,859
as we read in verses one through seven,

250
00:10:46,859 --> 00:10:50,119
that it leads to this report that Moses would deliver.

251
00:10:50,119 --> 00:10:51,879
And the first part of that report

252
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:54,639
is all that the Lord had done unto Pharaoh

253
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:56,599
and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake.

254
00:10:56,599 --> 00:11:00,399
Can you imagine, as the Bible tells us in verse number one,

255
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:02,399
that Jethro heard,

256
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:07,799
but now he gets to hear a report directly from Moses.

257
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:09,599
That's a little bit different, isn't it?

258
00:11:09,599 --> 00:11:11,239
You ever hear a report from someone else,

259
00:11:11,239 --> 00:11:14,019
some second-hand source, and someone tells you about it,

260
00:11:14,019 --> 00:11:16,599
but then all of a sudden you get to go face-to-face

261
00:11:16,599 --> 00:11:18,519
with the person that experienced it,

262
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:20,199
and they get to provide you with,

263
00:11:20,199 --> 00:11:23,019
oh man, just a different perspective altogether.

264
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:25,759
Moses was there.

265
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:27,279
Moses was living that.

266
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,799
Moses was interacting.

267
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:31,199
He was entering into the court of Pharaoh.

268
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:33,039
He was the one that was raising up,

269
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:34,399
and Aaron there with them,

270
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,039
and they would see the plagues,

271
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:37,559
and they would see them come,

272
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:39,279
and we find that there were times

273
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,439
in which Moses would say to Pharaoh,

274
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:44,399
okay, at the appointed time, I'll raise my hand.

275
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,199
He's following the direction of the Lord,

276
00:11:46,199 --> 00:11:49,259
and the plague will be stayed, and I mean, it's amazing.

277
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,979
And now Moses is rehearsing this firsthand.

278
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:54,939
You know what Moses is doing?

279
00:11:54,939 --> 00:11:56,799
He's declaring how great God is.

280
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:00,759
He's declaring how great God is.

281
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:02,719
He's great in power.

282
00:12:02,719 --> 00:12:04,959
We dealt with that many, many months ago,

283
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,839
and we find that Moses is giving in this report

284
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:11,199
to his father-in-law.

285
00:12:11,199 --> 00:12:15,279
The first part of this report is the plagues in Egypt,

286
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,919
and to the Egyptians.

287
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:19,039
Notice it says, for Israel's sake.

288
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:23,319
Listen, I'm thankful that God is working for his people.

289
00:12:23,319 --> 00:12:24,619
Aren't you thankful for that?

290
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:26,719
I mean, listen, when you think about it this morning,

291
00:12:27,439 --> 00:12:29,639
when the Bible says this, who can be against us?

292
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:30,479
Right, why?

293
00:12:30,479 --> 00:12:32,179
Because God is for us.

294
00:12:32,179 --> 00:12:34,799
We sing the song, I'm on the winning side.

295
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:39,799
Listen, I am so thankful that God works on our behalf.

296
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:41,879
Aren't you thankful for that?

297
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:45,719
I mean, hallelujah, and what a joy to know

298
00:12:45,719 --> 00:12:48,839
that God was working for Israel's sake.

299
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:50,639
He was working for his people,

300
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,559
and he was demonstrating his power,

301
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:55,919
but notice that part two, as we look at verse number eight,

302
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:59,759
then the Bible says this, and all the travail

303
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:03,199
that had come upon them by the way.

304
00:13:04,199 --> 00:13:07,719
Now all of a sudden, we go from part one of this report

305
00:13:07,719 --> 00:13:11,079
with the plagues in Egypt, to part two of this report,

306
00:13:11,079 --> 00:13:13,219
the problems along the way.

307
00:13:13,219 --> 00:13:14,959
You ever have problems in life?

308
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,219
Ha ha.

309
00:13:16,219 --> 00:13:18,159
You say, pastor, how much time do you have?

310
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:20,079
And I got problems, right?

311
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,439
We all have problems, we understand it.

312
00:13:22,439 --> 00:13:25,519
Man that's born of woman is few days and full of trouble,

313
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,599
the Bible tells us, and we find here,

314
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:30,679
the Bible speaks about the travail

315
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:32,999
that had come upon them by the way.

316
00:13:32,999 --> 00:13:35,599
That word travail means toil, it means hardship,

317
00:13:35,599 --> 00:13:37,599
it means distress.

318
00:13:37,599 --> 00:13:39,839
And we find this morning that if you were to go back

319
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,939
and you look at the Exodus, and you understand

320
00:13:42,939 --> 00:13:45,199
what takes place after the death of the firstborn

321
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,839
in that 10th plague, that they leave Egypt land,

322
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:50,879
and the Bible tells us that they camp

323
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:52,759
in a place called Pi-ha-hireth,

324
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:54,359
and then the next day they're there,

325
00:13:54,359 --> 00:13:56,479
and there's the Red Sea.

326
00:13:56,479 --> 00:13:57,439
And what happens?

327
00:13:57,439 --> 00:13:59,699
Well, the Egyptians are in hot pursuit.

328
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,319
God leads them through the Red Sea,

329
00:14:03,319 --> 00:14:04,639
the midst of the Red Sea.

330
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,299
Man, what a blessing to think about God's power.

331
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:11,039
Exodus chapter 14 records that for us,

332
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:16,039
and it is a mountaintop of chapters in God's word

333
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:19,559
when you read how God worked and what God did.

334
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:21,519
You read chapter 15 of the book of Exodus,

335
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,599
and you find a people, the people of God

336
00:14:23,599 --> 00:14:25,839
that are rejoicing, they're singing the song of Moses,

337
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,319
they're speaking about how great God is.

338
00:14:29,319 --> 00:14:30,399
And you get to the end of the chapter,

339
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,199
and they're complaining.

340
00:14:32,199 --> 00:14:34,239
Because there's no, there's bitter water.

341
00:14:35,439 --> 00:14:37,119
There's bitter water.

342
00:14:37,119 --> 00:14:40,079
Moses, we're gonna die, right?

343
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,319
Those children of Israel.

344
00:14:42,699 --> 00:14:43,839
So what does Moses do?

345
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,239
Well, he gives this report to his father-in-law.

346
00:14:46,239 --> 00:14:51,239
He covers the plagues, but then he covers the problems.

347
00:14:51,439 --> 00:14:53,879
Listen, in our lives, we understand

348
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:56,799
there are gonna be some problems along the way.

349
00:14:56,799 --> 00:14:59,359
And we find that as Moses would begin

350
00:14:59,359 --> 00:15:02,299
to speak about the bitter water,

351
00:15:02,299 --> 00:15:04,159
but then we find that the second problem

352
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:05,819
that the children of Israel would experience

353
00:15:05,819 --> 00:15:08,239
after the bitter water is a place where they would come

354
00:15:08,239 --> 00:15:09,839
and there's no water.

355
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:14,259
And we find that they would have this need for food,

356
00:15:14,259 --> 00:15:17,479
and by the way, God knows he made us, he is the creator.

357
00:15:17,479 --> 00:15:20,319
He knows that we need food, and he knows that we need water,

358
00:15:20,359 --> 00:15:22,279
and he's able to sustain us.

359
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:25,919
We spoke as we looked at discovering the greatness of God,

360
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:28,359
that God cares for his children.

361
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,179
God sent manna from heaven.

362
00:15:33,439 --> 00:15:34,359
It's amazing.

363
00:15:34,359 --> 00:15:37,539
You think about the manna that God sent from heaven.

364
00:15:37,539 --> 00:15:39,919
And God gave him specific instruction

365
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:42,079
with regard to the gathering of the manna,

366
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,719
and he provided them with instruction

367
00:15:43,719 --> 00:15:45,879
with regard to which days to gather

368
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:47,799
and which day not to gather.

369
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:50,279
And you know, there are some people that were doubters,

370
00:15:51,119 --> 00:15:51,959
there are some people that didn't think

371
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:53,339
it was really gonna work that way.

372
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:55,799
There were some that gathered more

373
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:57,199
when they weren't supposed to,

374
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,839
and they tried to keep it overnight for the next day,

375
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,079
not having faith that God would provide it

376
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,599
on the second day, and what happened to that manna?

377
00:16:04,599 --> 00:16:06,999
Well, the Bible tells us that it got some worms

378
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:08,119
and it stank.

379
00:16:11,119 --> 00:16:12,839
So I then think that some of those same people,

380
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:14,719
when it came to the day where they're not supposed

381
00:16:14,719 --> 00:16:16,119
to gather, or excuse me,

382
00:16:16,119 --> 00:16:17,799
where they're supposed to gather twice, why?

383
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:19,879
Because on the Sabbath there will be no manna,

384
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,519
well, I don't know, because it had worms

385
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,559
and it stank earlier, so I'm not sure,

386
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:28,759
and they went out looking for it and there was none.

387
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:33,359
God provided miraculously for his people.

388
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,319
And we find that as Jethro is receiving this report

389
00:16:38,319 --> 00:16:41,119
that Moses is delivering again,

390
00:16:41,119 --> 00:16:44,479
Moses is the man of God, he's the eyewitness,

391
00:16:44,479 --> 00:16:47,239
he's the one that experienced this firsthand,

392
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:50,639
he's now delivering this message to his father-in-law,

393
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,559
and he's speaking about what God has done,

394
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:55,039
the plagues and the problems,

395
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:57,839
but I want you to notice the end of verse number nine,

396
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,039
excuse me, the end of verse number eight,

397
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:03,559
where the Bible says, and how the Lord delivered them.

398
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:05,759
I'm thankful for God's deliverance,

399
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:08,079
I'm thankful for God's provision, his power,

400
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,719
I'm thankful for, as Moses was able to speak

401
00:17:10,719 --> 00:17:12,439
about the troubles that they endured,

402
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:14,039
the problems that they had,

403
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:16,719
that at the same time he was able to give testimony

404
00:17:16,719 --> 00:17:18,479
of what God did.

405
00:17:18,479 --> 00:17:20,619
Listen, we came to a place called Marah

406
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:22,019
where there was bitter water,

407
00:17:22,019 --> 00:17:23,639
but let me tell you what God did,

408
00:17:23,639 --> 00:17:26,359
let me tell you how God made that bitter water

409
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:29,599
that was not capable for us to partake of,

410
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:33,199
it would kill us, that he caused us to have direction

411
00:17:33,199 --> 00:17:34,879
with putting that tree in there

412
00:17:34,879 --> 00:17:37,079
to make those bitter waters sweet.

413
00:17:38,199 --> 00:17:39,119
That's amazing.

414
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:42,399
And then let me tell you about when we get there

415
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:45,079
and there's no water and what God did,

416
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:47,199
and I believe, and I know I've said this before

417
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:49,699
from this Pope, but I believe with all of my heart

418
00:17:49,699 --> 00:17:52,159
that the reason that God allowed them to go to a place

419
00:17:52,159 --> 00:17:54,539
where there was no water is because if they came

420
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:56,919
to a place again where there was bitter water

421
00:17:56,919 --> 00:17:59,079
that they would have tried to lean on their own understanding

422
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:00,859
and they would have tried to find a tree

423
00:18:00,859 --> 00:18:04,719
that was like the tree in Marah and put it into the water.

424
00:18:04,719 --> 00:18:05,599
Why do I believe that?

425
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:07,119
Because that's human nature.

426
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:12,159
That's why sometimes our problems are different

427
00:18:12,999 --> 00:18:15,159
each time we go through life.

428
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:17,119
Little different than it was last time, why?

429
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:19,839
Because you're not gonna try the same solution.

430
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:21,899
You're gonna depend upon God.

431
00:18:21,899 --> 00:18:25,479
Trust him to see what he's able to do.

432
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:28,959
And we find that Moses is able to tell them

433
00:18:28,959 --> 00:18:31,959
about the place where there's no water

434
00:18:31,959 --> 00:18:34,440
and the people are complaining and the people are upset

435
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,440
and God tells Moses to go and I'm gonna show you a rock

436
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,000
and I'm gonna provide water out of the rock.

437
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,839
Now, I just wanna think about Jethro for a moment.

438
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:46,320
Can you imagine as he's hearing this?

439
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,159
Can you imagine?

440
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:50,219
I've never seen water come out of a rock.

441
00:18:50,219 --> 00:18:53,000
I mean, I've been to places where there's fresh water

442
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,239
that's coming in the mountains and so on and so forth

443
00:18:55,239 --> 00:18:57,279
but I mean, I'm talking about a dry rock.

444
00:18:57,279 --> 00:18:59,279
I'm talking about a place where there's nothing,

445
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:01,079
where there's no water, where the people say

446
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:04,339
we're gonna die for thirst and God leads a man

447
00:19:04,339 --> 00:19:07,199
directly to a particular rock and says,

448
00:19:07,199 --> 00:19:11,519
that rock smite it and he does and their water gushes out.

449
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:13,239
That's amazing.

450
00:19:13,239 --> 00:19:15,639
Absolutely miraculous.

451
00:19:15,639 --> 00:19:18,799
And I think about Jethro as he's receiving this report

452
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,679
and as he's hearing it and here's the thing,

453
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:21,599
have you ever been in a place,

454
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:22,880
I said this to somebody yesterday,

455
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,719
have you ever been in a place where you said to somebody,

456
00:19:24,719 --> 00:19:25,919
that's unbelievable?

457
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:28,880
It's unbelievable.

458
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,179
See, it's only unbelievable, here's what I said,

459
00:19:31,179 --> 00:19:33,279
the full context of my statement was this,

460
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:36,559
it's unbelievable except for the fact that God said it

461
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:39,919
and therefore it's believable, right?

462
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,699
But somebody, listen, Moses experienced it.

463
00:19:42,699 --> 00:19:44,359
Have you ever been in a situation

464
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:45,839
where somebody's telling you a story

465
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:47,880
and you say, I can't believe that.

466
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,639
I mean, come on, seriously?

467
00:19:49,639 --> 00:19:51,719
And you say, no, no, it really happened,

468
00:19:51,719 --> 00:19:55,719
like I was there, I saw it, I experienced it.

469
00:19:55,719 --> 00:19:57,639
And Moses had given this report

470
00:19:58,599 --> 00:20:01,199
and as Moses is declaring the greatness of God.

471
00:20:01,199 --> 00:20:04,319
And as Moses is testifying of how great God is,

472
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:07,119
and how wonderful God is, and what God has done,

473
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:09,719
we find that Jethro is receiving all of this.

474
00:20:09,719 --> 00:20:11,719
He's taking all of this in,

475
00:20:11,719 --> 00:20:14,939
and he's hearing all of these wonderful things.

476
00:20:16,479 --> 00:20:18,219
So we see their reunion,

477
00:20:19,299 --> 00:20:22,519
followed by the report.

478
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:25,379
Then we come here to the latter part

479
00:20:25,379 --> 00:20:26,439
of the text of scripture

480
00:20:26,439 --> 00:20:28,119
that we're going to focus on this morning.

481
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:30,119
And I want you to notice number three,

482
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:31,439
if you're taking notes this morning,

483
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:35,039
number three, the response of Jethro.

484
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,599
The response of Jethro.

485
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:38,159
I'll read all three verses

486
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,119
that detail for us his response,

487
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:41,539
and then we'll get into the details.

488
00:20:41,539 --> 00:20:42,919
Notice in verse number nine,

489
00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:43,759
the Bible says,

490
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:47,299
and Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness

491
00:20:47,299 --> 00:20:49,199
which the Lord had done to Israel,

492
00:20:49,199 --> 00:20:52,259
whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians.

493
00:20:52,259 --> 00:20:53,199
And Jethro said,

494
00:20:53,199 --> 00:20:56,439
blessed be the Lord who hath delivered you

495
00:20:56,439 --> 00:20:58,179
out of the hand of the Egyptians

496
00:20:58,179 --> 00:21:00,039
and out of the hand of Pharaoh.

497
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:01,879
Who hath delivered the people

498
00:21:01,879 --> 00:21:04,479
from under the hand of the Egyptians.

499
00:21:04,479 --> 00:21:05,879
Notice verse number 11.

500
00:21:05,879 --> 00:21:10,879
Now I know that the Lord is greater than all gods.

501
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:13,619
That's a powerful statement.

502
00:21:14,999 --> 00:21:17,399
For in the thing wherein they dealt proudly,

503
00:21:17,399 --> 00:21:22,099
he Jehovah God, the Lord God Almighty was above them.

504
00:21:22,099 --> 00:21:22,939
In verse 12,

505
00:21:22,939 --> 00:21:26,039
and Jethro Moses' father-in-law took a burnt offering

506
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:27,559
and sacrifices for God.

507
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:29,759
And Aaron came and all the elders of Israel

508
00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:31,799
to eat bread with Moses,

509
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:35,039
with Moses' father-in-law before God.

510
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,959
Verses nine through 12 record for us

511
00:21:36,959 --> 00:21:38,719
the response of Jethro.

512
00:21:38,719 --> 00:21:41,839
Again, we see the reunion and we see this report.

513
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:44,399
It's one verse of scripture in verse number eight

514
00:21:44,399 --> 00:21:46,079
that provides us with the report

515
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:48,479
that Moses would deliver to his father-in-law.

516
00:21:48,479 --> 00:21:51,519
But then we see the response of Jethro here

517
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:52,959
beginning in verse number nine.

518
00:21:52,959 --> 00:21:53,999
Notice first of all,

519
00:21:53,999 --> 00:21:56,839
his response was one of rejoicing.

520
00:21:56,839 --> 00:21:57,919
One of rejoicing.

521
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:00,679
Listen, it's good for us to rejoice.

522
00:22:00,679 --> 00:22:02,679
It's good for us to rejoice when we hear

523
00:22:02,679 --> 00:22:05,199
of how great God is and what God is doing.

524
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:06,999
And we find that the Bible says,

525
00:22:06,999 --> 00:22:09,479
and Jethro rejoiced.

526
00:22:09,479 --> 00:22:12,719
Isn't that what you would expect the response to be?

527
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:16,299
Honestly, rejoicing.

528
00:22:17,719 --> 00:22:20,359
I would expect that response

529
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:22,919
when I understand the content of the report

530
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:23,959
in verse number eight,

531
00:22:23,959 --> 00:22:27,159
when I'm understanding all that Moses would be delivering

532
00:22:27,199 --> 00:22:31,199
because the Bible again says that Moses told him

533
00:22:31,199 --> 00:22:33,679
all that the Lord had done unto Pharaoh

534
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,599
and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake

535
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:38,879
and all the travail that had come upon them by the way

536
00:22:38,879 --> 00:22:40,279
and how the Lord delivered them.

537
00:22:40,279 --> 00:22:43,799
And therefore, the Bible says that Jethro rejoiced.

538
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:45,639
He's rejoicing.

539
00:22:45,639 --> 00:22:47,579
You know, it's good for us to rejoice.

540
00:22:48,439 --> 00:22:50,159
It's easy for us to complain.

541
00:22:51,499 --> 00:22:54,319
We have to be purposed to rejoice.

542
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:57,319
Honestly, complaining comes naturally for you and for me.

543
00:22:58,239 --> 00:22:59,559
It's a human tendency,

544
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:02,839
a natural human tendency to complain.

545
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:05,079
We have to be purposed to rejoice.

546
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:08,079
Can I tell you we have much to rejoice for?

547
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:09,139
To rejoice in?

548
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:14,759
We serve a great God who's able to do amazing things.

549
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:16,239
And we know him.

550
00:23:16,239 --> 00:23:18,199
He's revealed himself to us.

551
00:23:18,199 --> 00:23:19,359
It's amazing.

552
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:21,879
We have so much to be thankful for.

553
00:23:21,879 --> 00:23:26,279
Rejoice in the Lord always.

554
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:29,679
And again, I say, rejoice.

555
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:32,039
Philippians chapter four.

556
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:35,759
What a powerful truth.

557
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:37,279
The psalmist said this.

558
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:39,199
This is the day the Lord hath made.

559
00:23:41,199 --> 00:23:44,159
I will rejoice and be glad in it.

560
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:48,399
It's a purpose determined perspective.

561
00:23:49,459 --> 00:23:51,639
He didn't say this is the day the Lord hath made

562
00:23:52,399 --> 00:23:53,799
and everything's great and everything went

563
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:55,839
just according to plan, just how I thought it'd go.

564
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:58,199
And so therefore I'm gonna rejoice.

565
00:23:58,199 --> 00:24:02,459
No, I'm gonna rejoice because God is God and he's my God.

566
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:05,719
We find that this rejoicing is given.

567
00:24:05,719 --> 00:24:08,359
It says that he rejoiced for all the goodness

568
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:10,399
which the Lord had done to Israel,

569
00:24:10,399 --> 00:24:12,719
whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians.

570
00:24:12,719 --> 00:24:15,439
And then notice the Bible says that he blessed the Lord.

571
00:24:15,439 --> 00:24:18,519
He says, blessed be the Lord who hath delivered you

572
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:19,879
out of the hand of the Egyptians

573
00:24:19,879 --> 00:24:20,999
out of the hand of Pharaoh,

574
00:24:20,999 --> 00:24:22,239
who hath delivered the people

575
00:24:22,239 --> 00:24:23,939
from under the hand of the Egyptians.

576
00:24:23,939 --> 00:24:27,719
Now you understand that Jethro had some knowledge here.

577
00:24:27,719 --> 00:24:30,559
Jethro had some knowledge about the Egyptians,

578
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,799
about their power, about their might.

579
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,719
Of course, we understand that Moses,

580
00:24:35,719 --> 00:24:38,299
after the events that took place early in his life

581
00:24:38,299 --> 00:24:41,199
when he fled to the backside of the desert

582
00:24:41,199 --> 00:24:42,879
as we often refer to it as,

583
00:24:42,879 --> 00:24:47,199
that that's when he meets his soon to be wife Zipporah

584
00:24:47,199 --> 00:24:49,559
and of course his father-in-law there,

585
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:52,479
Jethro, and we find that he's a priest of Midian,

586
00:24:52,479 --> 00:24:55,479
but he hears what God did to the Egyptians.

587
00:24:57,239 --> 00:24:58,459
God showed his power.

588
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:01,159
And we find that this man,

589
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:05,599
this response that he gives is so powerful

590
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:08,479
as we think about this verbal declaration

591
00:25:08,479 --> 00:25:10,639
that's given to us in verse number 11.

592
00:25:10,639 --> 00:25:13,239
He's rejoicing, but then notice specifically

593
00:25:13,239 --> 00:25:15,279
what he says in verse number 11.

594
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:19,759
He says, now, now I know

595
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:24,759
that the Lord is greater than all gods.

596
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:27,059
Now that's a powerful statement.

597
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,439
Think about the nation of Egypt, the Egyptian people,

598
00:25:31,439 --> 00:25:33,519
they were a polytheistic people.

599
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:37,099
All of the false gods and all of the idolatrous worship

600
00:25:37,099 --> 00:25:38,959
that was prevalent there in Egypt.

601
00:25:38,959 --> 00:25:41,559
And we find that again, there's no doubt

602
00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:44,899
as Moses is sharing these testimonies

603
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:47,179
and giving the report to his father-in-law

604
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:51,539
that Jethro is understanding the power

605
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:54,179
and the might of Jehovah God.

606
00:25:57,939 --> 00:26:00,819
But I want you to notice that he says, now I know,

607
00:26:00,819 --> 00:26:05,819
now I know that the Lord is greater than all gods.

608
00:26:08,619 --> 00:26:12,139
He had heard in verse number one of chapter 18

609
00:26:12,139 --> 00:26:14,679
of all that God had done for Moses.

610
00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:18,139
He had heard much of no doubt

611
00:26:18,139 --> 00:26:21,019
what Moses actually reported to him.

612
00:26:21,019 --> 00:26:23,219
But now after hearing it firsthand,

613
00:26:23,219 --> 00:26:26,019
after having this reunion with Moses,

614
00:26:26,019 --> 00:26:29,799
he stands and he rejoices and he then makes

615
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:34,259
this verbal declaration of his own personal understanding

616
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,939
of how great God is.

617
00:26:36,939 --> 00:26:38,659
As we're gonna think about this statement

618
00:26:38,659 --> 00:26:40,619
and I mentioned by way of introduction

619
00:26:40,619 --> 00:26:43,819
where the psalmist says in Psalm 135 in verse number five,

620
00:26:43,819 --> 00:26:46,299
for I know that the Lord is great.

621
00:26:46,299 --> 00:26:49,339
Listen, we need to have this kind of understanding

622
00:26:49,339 --> 00:26:53,419
in our lives just as Jethro is going to declare

623
00:26:53,419 --> 00:26:56,179
verbally what he knows to be true.

624
00:26:56,179 --> 00:26:58,219
Listen, we as the people of God,

625
00:26:58,219 --> 00:26:59,459
we need to be able to stand and say,

626
00:26:59,459 --> 00:27:01,639
I know that God is great.

627
00:27:02,539 --> 00:27:05,339
There's no one that's gonna convince me otherwise,

628
00:27:05,339 --> 00:27:07,699
no one is gonna persuade me otherwise

629
00:27:07,699 --> 00:27:10,699
for I am convinced, I am persuaded,

630
00:27:10,699 --> 00:27:13,219
I know in whom I have believed.

631
00:27:14,819 --> 00:27:18,539
And we get into the Bible and we allow the Bible

632
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:22,179
to get into us and as we have the truth of God's word

633
00:27:22,179 --> 00:27:24,819
that has solidified our position with regard

634
00:27:24,819 --> 00:27:27,639
to who he is and of his greatness.

635
00:27:28,539 --> 00:27:31,379
We find that this man, Jethro,

636
00:27:31,379 --> 00:27:34,679
makes this powerful, powerful declaration.

637
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:39,079
Now I know that the Lord is greater than all gods.

638
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:40,799
From the thing wherein they dealt proudly,

639
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:43,499
he was above them.

640
00:27:43,539 --> 00:27:47,399
Notice after this verbal declaration in verse number 11,

641
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:49,539
there's a personal offering that is made

642
00:27:49,539 --> 00:27:51,919
in verse number 12 where the Bible tells us

643
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:53,899
that Jethro, Moses' father-in-law,

644
00:27:53,899 --> 00:27:58,899
took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God.

645
00:27:59,019 --> 00:28:02,419
Now this is, these actions in verse number 12

646
00:28:02,419 --> 00:28:05,099
are actions that support the declaration

647
00:28:05,099 --> 00:28:06,399
in verse number 11.

648
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:09,179
Listen, someone said, I don't know who

649
00:28:09,179 --> 00:28:11,479
the phrase is attributed to,

650
00:28:11,479 --> 00:28:13,559
but actions speak louder than words.

651
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:14,919
You've heard that before.

652
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:17,319
And we find that the Bible says,

653
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:19,519
throughout the pages of scripture,

654
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:21,599
where Paul will say, listen,

655
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:23,279
not only the things that you've heard of me,

656
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:25,279
but the things that you've seen in me.

657
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,439
We find that the Bible speaks about,

658
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:31,879
give me thine heart and let thine eyes observe my ways.

659
00:28:31,879 --> 00:28:34,039
Someone said this talk is cheap

660
00:28:34,039 --> 00:28:37,259
and we understand some of those phraseologies

661
00:28:37,259 --> 00:28:39,079
and some of those pithy statements.

662
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:42,139
But this morning, as we look at this text of scripture

663
00:28:42,139 --> 00:28:45,299
and we see the verbal declaration in verse number 11,

664
00:28:45,299 --> 00:28:47,199
where Jethro stands and he says,

665
00:28:47,199 --> 00:28:50,979
he makes this powerful statement of the greatness of God,

666
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:54,579
but then the action that follows supports what he says,

667
00:28:54,579 --> 00:28:57,599
where he then takes a burnt offering

668
00:28:57,599 --> 00:28:59,519
and sacrifices for God.

669
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:04,739
His actions are aligning with what he's declared.

670
00:29:05,739 --> 00:29:09,179
Listen, when we know that God is great,

671
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:12,079
it ought to impact how we live our lives.

672
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:14,799
It ought to impact how we behave, what we do.

673
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:17,079
That's why at the end of this year,

674
00:29:17,079 --> 00:29:20,559
as we look at this three phases, if you will,

675
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,039
of this particular theme,

676
00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:24,179
that yes, we want to discover God's greatness

677
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:26,199
and yes, we want to declare God's greatness,

678
00:29:26,199 --> 00:29:27,719
but eventually what has to happen

679
00:29:27,719 --> 00:29:31,159
is I have to live in light of God's greatness.

680
00:29:31,159 --> 00:29:35,379
The truth of God's word must impact my daily behavior.

681
00:29:35,379 --> 00:29:39,019
I see as I study the scriptures, as I look to God's word,

682
00:29:39,019 --> 00:29:43,059
I find that belief impacts behavior.

683
00:29:45,379 --> 00:29:48,019
The fool hath said in his heart, there is no God.

684
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:49,839
That's why he acts foolish.

685
00:29:53,859 --> 00:29:56,659
But when we understand we have belief,

686
00:29:56,659 --> 00:29:58,619
it's gonna impact our behavior.

687
00:29:58,619 --> 00:30:00,579
It's gonna impact how we live.

688
00:30:00,579 --> 00:30:01,839
Listen, if you.

689
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:03,559
believe this morning that God answers prayer,

690
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:04,459
you're gonna pray.

691
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:10,039
If you don't really think that God answers prayer,

692
00:30:10,039 --> 00:30:11,139
you're not gonna pray.

693
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:13,679
I talked to somebody recently,

694
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,639
and here's what the person said to me recently,

695
00:30:15,639 --> 00:30:16,839
is within the last couple of weeks,

696
00:30:16,839 --> 00:30:17,839
here's what the person said to me,

697
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:19,599
I really wanna, in my mind,

698
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:21,599
I wanna believe that God does not exist.

699
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:27,279
And then they said, but I know that's not true.

700
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:29,959
Okay, but in my mind, I wanna believe that.

701
00:30:29,999 --> 00:30:31,919
And then about four minutes later in the conversation,

702
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:33,519
they said this, I don't understand

703
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:35,379
why God doesn't answer my prayers.

704
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:39,519
Hold on a minute, let me understand this.

705
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:42,239
The God that you said you hope doesn't exist,

706
00:30:42,239 --> 00:30:45,599
you're confused as to why he's not answering your prayers?

707
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:49,319
And they looked at me and said, it's kind of strange, huh?

708
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:52,559
Yeah, yeah, I don't have a degree for that, amen.

709
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,359
But the reality is that, listen,

710
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:57,939
if we know that God answers prayer, I'm gonna pray.

711
00:30:58,939 --> 00:31:02,499
My behavior is impacted by my belief.

712
00:31:05,819 --> 00:31:08,679
But my behavior reveals what I believe.

713
00:31:09,819 --> 00:31:13,739
When you see somebody that doesn't pray,

714
00:31:13,739 --> 00:31:16,039
they must not believe that God answers prayer.

715
00:31:17,339 --> 00:31:18,659
It goes both ways.

716
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:24,099
And this morning, as we look at the declaration

717
00:31:24,099 --> 00:31:27,799
in verse number 11, we see the action in verse number 12,

718
00:31:28,639 --> 00:31:29,999
where Jethro says, I know,

719
00:31:29,999 --> 00:31:33,519
I know that he's greater than all gods.

720
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:36,839
Now I'm gonna bring an offering,

721
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:38,799
a burnt offering and a sacrifice.

722
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:42,679
And his actions are aligning with what he's declared,

723
00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:45,079
what he's given this statement,

724
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:47,199
this proclamation in verse number 11.

725
00:31:47,199 --> 00:31:50,479
And we find that the Bible tells us that Aaron came

726
00:31:51,479 --> 00:31:54,559
and all the elders of Israel to eat bread

727
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:57,799
with Moses' father-in-law before God.

728
00:31:57,799 --> 00:31:59,159
Can you imagine?

729
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:02,439
I mean, what a scene here in verse number 12,

730
00:32:02,439 --> 00:32:03,999
as you look at what's taking place

731
00:32:03,999 --> 00:32:08,999
and you see this man, Jethro, who had heard some things,

732
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:12,519
who's the priest of Midian, and he's there

733
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:14,439
and he's heard about what God has done,

734
00:32:14,439 --> 00:32:16,679
but he comes and he receives this report

735
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:18,939
and he has this time with Moses,

736
00:32:18,939 --> 00:32:22,919
where Moses is providing firsthand all that God has done

737
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:25,139
and who God is, and the Bible says

738
00:32:25,139 --> 00:32:27,459
that he's gonna respond by rejoicing,

739
00:32:27,459 --> 00:32:30,839
by declaring, and then by sacrificing.

740
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:32,459
Wow.

741
00:32:32,459 --> 00:32:34,839
And Aaron's there and all the elders of Israel.

742
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:36,879
I mean, this is a big deal.

743
00:32:36,879 --> 00:32:37,819
It's exciting.

744
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:41,879
As I look at this passage of scripture this morning,

745
00:32:41,879 --> 00:32:44,119
and we look at these three points,

746
00:32:44,119 --> 00:32:45,659
these three thoughts with regard

747
00:32:45,659 --> 00:32:47,959
to the outline of the message,

748
00:32:47,959 --> 00:32:50,959
I really have three thoughts for us in closing this morning.

749
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:54,839
And I'd like for us to consider,

750
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:57,399
as we look at this portion of scripture,

751
00:32:57,399 --> 00:32:59,179
number one is this.

752
00:32:59,179 --> 00:33:03,479
Have you personally experienced the greatness of God

753
00:33:03,479 --> 00:33:04,539
as Moses did?

754
00:33:05,959 --> 00:33:08,079
In your life personally,

755
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:11,239
have you experienced the greatness of God?

756
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:13,079
Moses experienced it personally.

757
00:33:14,339 --> 00:33:16,039
Moses was able to give the report

758
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:18,239
that he gives in verse number eight

759
00:33:18,239 --> 00:33:21,639
because he experienced God's greatness personally.

760
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:24,679
Hey, do you know that God's great?

761
00:33:26,239 --> 00:33:30,759
Can you testify of God's greatness in your life personally?

762
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:32,079
And we find this morning,

763
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:34,599
listen, if you've not ever personally experienced

764
00:33:34,599 --> 00:33:35,679
the greatness of God,

765
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:37,839
I wanna encourage you this morning,

766
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:39,919
if you've never been saved by the grace of God,

767
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:42,359
that today is the day of salvation.

768
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:43,839
And what great, I mean,

769
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:48,839
think about God's grace and his love in saving us.

770
00:33:49,259 --> 00:33:51,559
Man, hallelujah.

771
00:33:51,559 --> 00:33:52,479
The greatness of God,

772
00:33:52,479 --> 00:33:54,079
the great plan of redemption

773
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:55,919
as we dealt with a few weeks ago.

774
00:33:57,159 --> 00:33:59,939
Then I begin to think about God working in my life.

775
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,779
God's showing me personally day by day.

776
00:34:03,779 --> 00:34:05,439
I dealt with this on Wednesday evening.

777
00:34:05,439 --> 00:34:06,279
If you were here,

778
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:07,879
as we're studying through the book of Ruth,

779
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:12,439
Naomi didn't get to experience personally

780
00:34:12,439 --> 00:34:14,759
how God visited the people.

781
00:34:14,759 --> 00:34:15,739
She only heard.

782
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:18,599
She only heard.

783
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:19,419
Why?

784
00:34:19,419 --> 00:34:20,259
Because she was in Moab.

785
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:23,479
They left Bethlehem.

786
00:34:23,479 --> 00:34:26,419
Elimelech led the family to leave Bethlehem, Judah.

787
00:34:27,279 --> 00:34:29,019
And they went to Moab.

788
00:34:29,019 --> 00:34:31,919
And after 10 years of famine and three funerals,

789
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,219
she hears.

790
00:34:35,279 --> 00:34:38,099
The Lord visited her people and giving them bread.

791
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:42,319
She didn't get to experience it personally,

792
00:34:42,319 --> 00:34:43,919
but she got to hear about it.

793
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:45,839
And I said this on Wednesday evening,

794
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:47,799
I don't wanna just hear about what God's doing

795
00:34:47,799 --> 00:34:49,359
in someone else's life,

796
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:51,039
in some other place.

797
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:54,479
I wanna experience what God's doing in my life.

798
00:34:54,479 --> 00:34:56,279
Listen, it's exciting to hear what God's doing

799
00:34:56,279 --> 00:34:57,339
in somebody else's life.

800
00:34:57,339 --> 00:34:58,319
It really is.

801
00:34:58,319 --> 00:35:00,879
It's exciting to get to hear what God's doing

802
00:35:00,879 --> 00:35:03,779
in some other church and some other missionary

803
00:35:03,779 --> 00:35:05,279
that we have the privilege of supporting

804
00:35:05,279 --> 00:35:06,239
and receiving those reports.

805
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:08,959
Listen, it encourages my heart,

806
00:35:08,959 --> 00:35:10,679
but it's not enough for me.

807
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:11,839
It's not enough for me to just hear

808
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:13,119
what God's doing in your life.

809
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:14,719
It's not enough for me to hear what God's doing

810
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:16,399
on the mission field or in some other church.

811
00:35:16,399 --> 00:35:20,119
I wanna see God work personally in my life.

812
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:23,099
I wanna experience personally the greatness of God.

813
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:26,479
Let me ask this question.

814
00:35:26,479 --> 00:35:29,319
Are you personally declaring God's greatness with others?

815
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:32,239
Moses had an opportunity.

816
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:34,919
Yes, Jethro heard and Jethro came.

817
00:35:34,919 --> 00:35:36,959
He traveled and he comes to this place

818
00:35:36,959 --> 00:35:38,919
and he enters into the tent

819
00:35:38,919 --> 00:35:40,859
after they'd asked of each other's welfare.

820
00:35:40,859 --> 00:35:43,119
And Moses has the opportunity to declare

821
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:44,659
all that God has done.

822
00:35:46,039 --> 00:35:47,139
I wonder this morning,

823
00:35:48,139 --> 00:35:50,499
are you declaring God's greatness with others?

824
00:35:51,659 --> 00:35:53,579
See, no one wants to hear.

825
00:35:53,579 --> 00:35:55,139
Just keep looking for somebody.

826
00:35:56,699 --> 00:35:59,399
Just look, there's a lot of hurting people in our world.

827
00:36:00,739 --> 00:36:02,379
You know what I've learned?

828
00:36:02,379 --> 00:36:03,979
People like to hear stories.

829
00:36:05,619 --> 00:36:06,539
I use the word story.

830
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:09,099
They like to hear what God's doing in people's lives.

831
00:36:09,099 --> 00:36:10,819
Can I tell you what God's done for me?

832
00:36:10,819 --> 00:36:12,139
Some people are like, ah, I don't wanna hear that,

833
00:36:12,139 --> 00:36:13,539
but some people are like, eh.

834
00:36:14,979 --> 00:36:16,539
Give some interest to that.

835
00:36:16,539 --> 00:36:17,859
I have found personally,

836
00:36:17,859 --> 00:36:20,059
in trying to reach people with the gospel,

837
00:36:20,059 --> 00:36:21,059
for years and years and years,

838
00:36:21,059 --> 00:36:23,659
it's how I was trained, it's how I was taught,

839
00:36:23,659 --> 00:36:25,579
that when you go and engage somebody with the gospel,

840
00:36:25,579 --> 00:36:27,299
that you invite them to church.

841
00:36:27,299 --> 00:36:29,399
I haven't done that for a couple of years.

842
00:36:31,279 --> 00:36:33,339
You know why I stopped doing that?

843
00:36:33,339 --> 00:36:34,659
Because God convicted me.

844
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:35,859
It's probably been like four or five years

845
00:36:35,859 --> 00:36:38,099
I've not started out by saying,

846
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:39,979
I wanna invite you to church.

847
00:36:39,979 --> 00:36:41,559
Why?

848
00:36:41,559 --> 00:36:42,539
Because as soon as I say church,

849
00:36:42,539 --> 00:36:44,099
they have an idea in their head.

850
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:46,479
They have a church that they've gone to,

851
00:36:47,319 --> 00:36:48,159
they got a church that they got hurt at,

852
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:48,979
they got a church that they didn't like,

853
00:36:48,979 --> 00:36:50,039
they got a church, you fill in the blank.

854
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:51,279
There's something.

855
00:36:51,279 --> 00:36:53,459
It's boring, it's dead, it's this, it's that,

856
00:36:53,459 --> 00:36:55,319
it's whatever, they just want my money.

857
00:36:55,319 --> 00:36:57,439
Whatever it is, they have an idea.

858
00:36:57,439 --> 00:36:58,279
They truly do.

859
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:00,179
See what I do?

860
00:37:00,179 --> 00:37:02,439
Can I tell you how God changed my life?

861
00:37:02,439 --> 00:37:04,519
Can I tell you what he did for me 26 years ago?

862
00:37:04,519 --> 00:37:06,279
I mean, just changed my life.

863
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:09,119
And there's some people that will listen.

864
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:13,319
More people, I've had better opportunity

865
00:37:13,319 --> 00:37:15,719
to declare God's greatness when I take that approach

866
00:37:15,719 --> 00:37:17,919
than when I say, can I invite you to church?

867
00:37:19,399 --> 00:37:20,639
It's been transformative.

868
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:23,759
And here we find this morning, listen,

869
00:37:23,759 --> 00:37:25,559
if we know that God is great,

870
00:37:25,559 --> 00:37:28,019
we need to be declaring God's greatness.

871
00:37:28,019 --> 00:37:32,799
We need to find somebody to tell how great our God is.

872
00:37:32,799 --> 00:37:33,959
And let me ask this question.

873
00:37:33,959 --> 00:37:35,039
I wonder this morning,

874
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:40,119
as I look at the text and I see Moses

875
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:44,099
standing and declaring and sharing all that God has done

876
00:37:44,099 --> 00:37:45,579
and he's exalting the Lord

877
00:37:45,579 --> 00:37:47,539
and he's declaring God's greatness

878
00:37:47,539 --> 00:37:50,539
and then the response of Jethro where he says,

879
00:37:50,539 --> 00:37:55,099
now I know that the Lord is greater than all gods.

880
00:37:55,099 --> 00:37:58,099
I wonder this morning if God could use me,

881
00:37:58,099 --> 00:38:02,819
if God could use you to help someone else realize

882
00:38:02,819 --> 00:38:04,739
how great God is.

883
00:38:04,739 --> 00:38:06,739
That'd be a wonderful thing, wouldn't it?

884
00:38:06,739 --> 00:38:09,779
I mean, somebody that God would allow our path to cross with

885
00:38:09,779 --> 00:38:12,059
that God would give us, as we often refer to it,

886
00:38:12,059 --> 00:38:13,579
as a divine appointment,

887
00:38:13,579 --> 00:38:16,179
where he'd allow us to have that interaction with someone

888
00:38:16,179 --> 00:38:18,139
and after we sit down and we talk to them

889
00:38:18,139 --> 00:38:19,739
and we reveal truth to them

890
00:38:19,739 --> 00:38:22,439
and we give them the truth of God's word,

891
00:38:22,439 --> 00:38:24,539
that they could stand and say something similar

892
00:38:24,539 --> 00:38:28,739
to what Jethro said, and I know that the Lord is great.

893
00:38:29,619 --> 00:38:30,539
That'd be awesome.

894
00:38:31,699 --> 00:38:34,579
A lot of people today that don't have any idea

895
00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:37,499
of how great your God is, how great my God is,

896
00:38:37,499 --> 00:38:39,919
they have no concept, they have no idea.

897
00:38:39,919 --> 00:38:41,379
You know why they don't know?

898
00:38:42,819 --> 00:38:45,599
They've listened to Hollywood as to who God is.

899
00:38:47,779 --> 00:38:50,459
They've listened to some political leader.

900
00:38:50,459 --> 00:38:52,679
They've listened to some religious leader.

901
00:38:56,019 --> 00:38:57,859
But you know who the best person is to tell somebody

902
00:38:57,859 --> 00:38:58,699
how great God is?

903
00:38:58,699 --> 00:39:00,399
Somebody that knows how great God is.

904
00:39:01,979 --> 00:39:04,299
Has anyone asked you before this question,

905
00:39:05,299 --> 00:39:07,299
hey, I'm gonna go to such and such restaurant,

906
00:39:07,299 --> 00:39:08,659
I wanna know, is it good?

907
00:39:09,659 --> 00:39:13,419
Now, if you've never been there before,

908
00:39:13,419 --> 00:39:16,579
do you have any business giving a review?

909
00:39:18,019 --> 00:39:18,859
Honestly.

910
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:22,539
I mean, you could, oh man, it's a great place to go, Tim.

911
00:39:22,539 --> 00:39:24,699
I mean, I'm telling you, it's awesome, it's the best food.

912
00:39:24,699 --> 00:39:26,899
I'm telling you, when's the last time?

913
00:39:26,899 --> 00:39:28,599
Well, I've never been there before.

914
00:39:30,779 --> 00:39:35,779
You'd be like, why did you just tell me all of that?

915
00:39:38,859 --> 00:39:40,619
If we know how great God is,

916
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:43,819
we're the ones that are qualified

917
00:39:45,739 --> 00:39:48,419
to tell somebody else how great God is.

918
00:39:49,899 --> 00:39:52,079
Those of us that have experienced.

919
00:39:53,219 --> 00:39:56,899
Why did Moses get to tell Jethro?

920
00:39:56,899 --> 00:39:58,979
Because Moses was qualified.

921
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:01,339
He knew how great God was.

922
00:40:01,339 --> 00:40:02,179
He experienced.

923
00:40:02,179 --> 00:40:05,579
He experienced it personally.

924
00:40:05,579 --> 00:40:08,979
And therefore, he is qualified to deliver a message

925
00:40:08,979 --> 00:40:12,319
to Jethro that resulted in Jethro saying,

926
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:20,159
I know now, I know that the Lord is greater than all gods.

927
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:23,959
Man, I want God to use me that way.

928
00:40:23,959 --> 00:40:25,959
I pray that this morning we would pray,

929
00:40:25,959 --> 00:40:28,999
God, use us in that manner.

930
00:40:28,999 --> 00:40:31,939
God, lead me, direct me.

931
00:40:31,939 --> 00:40:36,499
Give me those divine appointments

932
00:40:36,499 --> 00:40:38,979
so that I could declare your greatness.

933
00:40:38,979 --> 00:40:41,279
Jethro, I mean, this is a powerful, powerful

934
00:40:41,279 --> 00:40:45,679
proclamation of Jethro.

935
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:49,319
But it's the result of Moses saying,

936
00:40:49,319 --> 00:40:52,919
let me tell you all that God has done.

937
00:40:52,919 --> 00:40:56,399
This morning, we need to get into the habit.

938
00:40:56,399 --> 00:41:00,499
The word habit is sometimes used, eh.

939
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:03,999
We need to get into the routine, the habit,

940
00:41:03,999 --> 00:41:06,359
of telling people how great our God is,

941
00:41:06,359 --> 00:41:08,939
because we serve a great God.

942
00:41:08,939 --> 00:41:10,899
And it's good for us to share it here,

943
00:41:10,899 --> 00:41:13,039
but we need to get out of these walls.

944
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:15,779
Tell somebody how great our God is.

945
00:41:15,779 --> 00:41:16,539
Let's pray together.

946
00:41:16,539 --> 00:41:17,839
Father, we love you.

947
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:18,919
We thank you for loving us.

948
00:41:18,919 --> 00:41:19,979
We thank you for your word,

949
00:41:19,979 --> 00:41:21,819
the truth that's contained therein.

950
00:41:21,819 --> 00:41:25,119
We thank you, God, that you have revealed to us,

951
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:28,519
you've made known to us how great you are.

952
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:32,419
God, I pray that if there's one here

953
00:41:32,419 --> 00:41:34,819
that's never trusted Christ as their personal savior,

954
00:41:34,819 --> 00:41:39,859
they do not have assurance,

955
00:41:39,859 --> 00:41:42,259
100% confidence and certainty

956
00:41:42,259 --> 00:41:43,299
that if they were to die today,

957
00:41:43,299 --> 00:41:45,019
that heaven is their home.

958
00:41:45,019 --> 00:41:48,599
God, I pray that today would be the day of their salvation.

959
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:50,059
I pray that they would come forward

960
00:41:50,059 --> 00:41:51,239
during our time of invitation,

961
00:41:51,239 --> 00:41:52,599
that we have an opportunity to take a Bible

962
00:41:52,599 --> 00:41:53,739
and show them how they can know for sure

963
00:41:53,739 --> 00:41:56,099
that heaven is their home.

964
00:41:56,119 --> 00:41:58,959
God, I pray for every child of God.

965
00:41:58,959 --> 00:42:03,219
Lord, I don't want to just flounder in my Christian life.

966
00:42:03,219 --> 00:42:06,059
I don't want to just make it.

967
00:42:06,059 --> 00:42:08,839
God, I want to experience your greatness.

968
00:42:08,839 --> 00:42:11,739
I want to see you answer prayer.

969
00:42:11,739 --> 00:42:15,199
I want to see you work as only you can work.

970
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,379
I think what the psalmist said is,

971
00:42:16,379 --> 00:42:19,779
time, Lord, for thee to work.

972
00:42:19,779 --> 00:42:22,679
God, I pray that we'd have that desire,

973
00:42:22,699 --> 00:42:27,199
that earnest expectation of seeing you work.

974
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:30,039
God, would you give us opportunity

975
00:42:30,039 --> 00:42:32,299
to declare your greatness.

976
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:35,879
We come in contact with so many people so often

977
00:42:35,879 --> 00:42:41,839
that simply do not know who you are.

978
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:45,419
And God, we're qualified

979
00:42:45,419 --> 00:42:49,219
to tell others about how great you are.

980
00:42:49,239 --> 00:42:53,899
I pray that you'd use us for your honor and for your glory,

981
00:42:53,899 --> 00:42:56,539
that others might stand as Jethro did,

982
00:42:56,539 --> 00:42:59,839
and said, for now I know

983
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:02,379
the Lord is greater than all gods.

984
00:43:02,379 --> 00:43:04,419
Use us, Lord, to that end.

985
00:43:04,419 --> 00:43:05,779
Well, thank you for the work that you'll do.

986
00:43:05,779 --> 00:43:06,939
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

987
00:43:06,939 --> 00:43:08,419
Would you stand with me?

988
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:09,659
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

989
00:43:09,659 --> 00:43:12,079
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano.

990
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:14,099
And as she does, the altar is open.

991
00:43:14,099 --> 00:43:16,779
Maybe the Lord spoke to your heart this morning.

992
00:43:16,779 --> 00:43:18,219
Would you respond to the Lord?

993
00:43:18,219 --> 00:43:19,059
If you're not sure of heaven,

994
00:43:19,059 --> 00:43:20,019
we'd love to take a Bible and show you

995
00:43:20,019 --> 00:43:23,099
how you can know for sure that heaven's your home.

996
00:43:23,099 --> 00:43:25,099
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
