00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440
18, Exodus chapter number 18,

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.039
and really this morning,

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:07.980
we'll be transitioning into phase two of our annual theme,

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.600
our theme for this year.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.039
As you know, you see on the banners there,

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:14.520
great is the Lord, and then it says this,

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.879
and greatly to be praised, Psalm 48, verse number one.

00:00:17.879 --> 00:00:19.600
We've been singing as our theme song,

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.760
Psalm 48, one and two all year.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.479
And the first part, the phase one, if you will,

00:00:25.479 --> 00:00:27.459
for our annual theme this year,

00:00:27.459 --> 00:00:29.000
has really been dealing with the idea

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.700
of discovering God's greatness.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.659
Each of us would, I believe,

00:00:33.659 --> 00:00:36.419
agree this morning that our God is great.

00:00:36.419 --> 00:00:39.040
We wanna be able to have some substance

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.119
as to why we would make that claim.

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:43.220
Why is it that we would tell somebody else

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.060
that our God is great?

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.419
What sets him apart?

00:00:46.419 --> 00:00:49.459
And so as we've studied for all of these months,

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:51.979
and we've looked at so many various subjects

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:54.380
and passages of scripture, topics,

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.619
as to why our God is great,

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.479
and we've discovered God's greatness,

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:03.319
phase two is going to be this, declare God's greatness.

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:05.000
And you'll remember with me

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.680
as we began studying this year with this theme

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.760
that I made note that the psalmist

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.879
made two powerful statements really

00:01:13.879 --> 00:01:16.879
with regard to the greatness of God

00:01:16.879 --> 00:01:19.639
as it relates to our theme for this year.

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:22.540
And one of those is in Psalm 135, in verse number five,

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:23.800
where the psalmist said this,

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.339
for I know that the Lord is great,

00:01:26.339 --> 00:01:28.440
that our Lord is above all gods.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.379
Each and every individual, every child of God

00:01:31.379 --> 00:01:33.099
needs to know and be fully persuaded

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:35.819
in their own heart and mind that God is great.

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:38.660
And we ought to be able to say with the psalmist,

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.699
for I know that the Lord is great.

00:01:42.699 --> 00:01:44.440
God wants us to know his greatness.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.260
He has given us his precious word.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.980
He's revealed to us his character, his nature,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.839
and he helps us to understand how great he is.

00:01:54.839 --> 00:01:57.360
But then in Psalm 145, in verse number six,

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.680
the psalmist makes that second statement

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.639
that is so impactful with regard to our theme for this year.

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:05.220
And at the end of that verse of scripture,

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.220
the psalmist says this, and I will declare thy greatness.

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:12.600
I will declare thy greatness.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.479
Near the end of the year,

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:17.279
we'll get into phase three of our series

00:02:17.279 --> 00:02:19.460
for this particular annual theme.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.500
And phase one, discover God's greatness.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.220
Phase two, declare God's greatness.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.899
And then we're gonna deal with a number of messages,

00:02:25.899 --> 00:02:29.580
just a handful of messages on this thought of living

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:34.059
and how we live understanding how great our God is,

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:36.500
living in light of God's greatness.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.259
You know, when I understand how great God is,

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:39.979
it's gonna impact how I pray.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.179
When I understand how great God is,

00:02:43.179 --> 00:02:45.020
so we're gonna deal with that at the end of the year.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.419
But for a number of weeks now,

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:48.360
we're going to look at this second phase

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.440
and dealing with the subject of declaring God's greatness.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.240
As we look to Exodus chapter 18,

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.080
I want us to consider this morning

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.320
the proclamation of Jethro.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.639
The Bible begins in verse number one,

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:03.559
when Jethro the priest of Midian, Moses' father-in-law,

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:07.720
heard of all that God had done for Moses and for Israel,

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.679
his people, and that the Lord had brought Israel

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:12.119
out of Egypt.

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:14.440
Then Jethro, Moses' father-in-law,

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.820
took Zipporah, Moses' wife,

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.259
after he had sent her back, and her two sons,

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:21.479
of which the name of the one was Gershom,

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:24.779
for he said, I have been an alien in a strange land,

00:03:24.779 --> 00:03:27.059
verse four, and the name of the other was Eleazar,

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:30.539
for the God of my father said he was mine help

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:33.740
and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh.

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.100
And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law,

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.460
came with the sons and his wife unto Moses

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.940
into the wilderness, where he encamped at the Mount of God.

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.059
And he said unto Moses, I, thy father-in-law,

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.520
Jethro, come unto thee and thy wife

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.679
and her two sons with her.

00:03:48.679 --> 00:03:51.639
And Moses went out to meet his father-in-law

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:54.000
and did obeisance and kissed him,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
and they asked each other of their welfare,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.919
and notice it says they came into the tent.

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:01.399
We'll study down through verse number 12 this morning

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:03.320
as we look at this text of scripture,

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.679
as we're studying this thought,

00:04:04.679 --> 00:04:06.279
the proclamation of Jethro.

00:04:06.279 --> 00:04:08.559
If you are taking notes, number one this morning,

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:12.080
I want you to notice with me the reunion with Jethro.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.279
The reunion with Jethro,

00:04:13.279 --> 00:04:14.940
if you were to go back to Exodus chapter number four,

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.500
we won't do it for sake of time.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.420
But if you go back this morning to Exodus four

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.980
in verse number 18, God gives us in that verse of scripture

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.820
the last recorded interaction between Moses and Jethro.

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.100
And Moses, after he had been called by God,

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.940
after he saw God and God gave him all of the instruction

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.980
that he gave him, the commission, if you will,

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:38.859
in Exodus chapter number three,

00:04:38.859 --> 00:04:42.299
we find that Moses is going to respond in obedience.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.880
He's going to go as God had given him

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.399
the instruction to do so.

00:04:46.399 --> 00:04:48.600
And we find that in the fourth chapter of the book

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.320
of Exodus, we find that that interaction,

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.559
that last recorded interaction is provided to us

00:04:54.559 --> 00:04:57.399
with regard to Moses and Jethro.

00:04:57.399 --> 00:04:59.600
Moses would leave, and now we understand

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.480
that between his departure in chapter number four

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.160
and where we are here in Exodus chapter number 18

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.119
this morning, a lot of things have taken place.

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:13.980
A lot of amazing things have taken place in between.

00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:17.420
The chapters that we're not noticeably looking at

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:19.540
this morning, but we find that we'll make reference

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.739
to them in summary.

00:05:21.739 --> 00:05:25.100
And so we find that Jethro, while he was still in Midian,

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.959
it's quite interesting, in verse number one,

00:05:27.959 --> 00:05:31.100
the Bible tells us that Jethro heard something.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:35.679
Notice the Bible says that he heard of all that God

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:39.859
had done for Moses and for Israel, his people,

00:05:39.859 --> 00:05:43.700
and that the Lord had brought Israel out of Egypt.

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.420
And so Jethro receives, he has this understanding

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:48.660
of what's taking place.

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.760
It's piqued his interest, so to speak.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.100
We find that the children of Israel have been delivered

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:56.859
from Egyptian bondage after all of the plagues.

00:05:56.859 --> 00:06:00.140
And we find that the Bible then tells us of the journey

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:03.500
that would take place in verses two through five

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:08.040
where Jethro, Zipporah, Gershom, and Eleazar

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.399
would travel to the place where Moses was camped

00:06:11.399 --> 00:06:13.519
according to verse number five.

00:06:13.519 --> 00:06:15.179
And we find that as we look at this,

00:06:15.179 --> 00:06:18.279
it's very interesting to note that the Bible does not tell us

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:22.119
in verse number one that Jethro heard what Moses did.

00:06:23.519 --> 00:06:28.480
No, the Bible says that Jethro heard of all that God

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.399
had done for Moses.

00:06:31.399 --> 00:06:33.820
I'm thankful that God used Moses,

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.179
but it was God that was at work.

00:06:36.179 --> 00:06:38.779
It was God that was performing the miracles.

00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:41.339
It was God that was providing for his children.

00:06:41.339 --> 00:06:43.260
It was God that was leading them.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.179
And in your life and in my life,

00:06:45.179 --> 00:06:47.299
it's just like we look at in the New Testament

00:06:47.299 --> 00:06:49.019
with John three in verse number 30,

00:06:49.019 --> 00:06:50.179
where John the Baptist said,

00:06:50.179 --> 00:06:52.420
he must increase and I must decrease.

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:55.299
It's not about Moses, it's about Jehovah God.

00:06:55.299 --> 00:06:57.059
It's not about you, it's not about me.

00:06:57.059 --> 00:06:59.459
It's about the Lord God Almighty.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.600
And what Midian heard, I love the verbiage here,

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.880
is the Bible says that he heard of all

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:09.559
that God had done for Moses.

00:07:09.559 --> 00:07:12.920
Praise the Lord that God was at work

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:17.079
and word gets back to Midian, word gets back to Jethro.

00:07:17.079 --> 00:07:19.519
And now I mentioned this, that it piqued his interest.

00:07:19.519 --> 00:07:22.559
I find that as I look at these next verses of scripture,

00:07:22.559 --> 00:07:25.040
the journey that would be embarked upon

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.279
is they would determine, I wanna go.

00:07:27.299 --> 00:07:28.899
And in fact, in verse number seven,

00:07:28.899 --> 00:07:30.859
the Bible says that as they greet one another

00:07:30.859 --> 00:07:34.660
and we would see that the greeting is that custom greeting

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:38.980
for that particular society and culture.

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:43.459
The Bible says that they asked each other of their welfare.

00:07:43.459 --> 00:07:46.220
There's an interest, there's a desire

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:49.019
to be able to understand some more of what's going on.

00:07:49.019 --> 00:07:51.459
And then I want you to notice that the Bible tells us

00:07:51.459 --> 00:07:54.179
as we consider the reunion with Jethro,

00:07:54.179 --> 00:07:57.019
that the Bible tells us at the end of verse number seven,

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:00.880
and they came into the tent.

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:02.679
Now the tent is the house, right?

00:08:02.679 --> 00:08:04.399
And we understand this morning,

00:08:04.399 --> 00:08:06.559
if we were to look at our society today,

00:08:06.559 --> 00:08:09.760
and we're to think of trying to make application,

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.079
someone comes from a distance,

00:08:11.079 --> 00:08:12.700
they've heard that God was at work,

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:14.320
that God was doing some things,

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:16.399
and they greet us and we have this greeting.

00:08:16.399 --> 00:08:18.880
And then we say, come on into my house.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:20.619
And they didn't just stay outside,

00:08:20.619 --> 00:08:23.760
no, they went into the tent and they're gonna go there.

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:25.640
And the Bible tells us, verse number eight,

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:28.220
it's interesting to me, it's one verse of scripture,

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:29.679
but I think it took a while.

00:08:30.779 --> 00:08:32.260
We can read this verse of scripture

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.099
in just a couple of seconds.

00:08:34.099 --> 00:08:39.020
But I think that the time that verse eight actually covers

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:42.260
was ours, was ours.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.619
And I begin to think about what's taking place here.

00:08:44.619 --> 00:08:46.260
And we noticed the reunion with Jethro,

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.099
if you're taking notes number two this morning,

00:08:48.099 --> 00:08:49.780
the report from Moses.

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:52.099
Verse number eight provides us with the report

00:08:52.099 --> 00:08:55.340
that Moses would deliver to his father-in-law Jethro.

00:08:56.039 --> 00:08:57.320
The Bible says this in verse number eight,

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:59.599
and Moses told his father-in-law,

00:08:59.599 --> 00:09:01.559
notice that little word all.

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:03.679
Did you see it?

00:09:03.679 --> 00:09:06.960
The Bible says that Moses told his father-in-law

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.760
all that the Lord had done.

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:14.919
Unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake.

00:09:14.919 --> 00:09:17.679
And so we see the first part, phase one, if you will,

00:09:17.679 --> 00:09:21.880
part one of this report is the plagues in Egypt.

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:24.359
That's the first part of this report

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:27.500
that Moses is going to deliver to Jethro.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:30.340
And we see that the Bible says that he told him all.

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:32.020
I don't believe this morning

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:35.260
that Moses just simply summarized everything and said,

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.299
well, look, God just worked real big.

00:09:37.299 --> 00:09:38.700
I mean, God did some amazing things.

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:41.520
No, I think Moses was giving them details.

00:09:42.979 --> 00:09:45.020
And he's sharing with them what God did

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:48.659
and how God was moving and how God was showing his power

00:09:48.659 --> 00:09:50.419
and how God was showing his might.

00:09:50.419 --> 00:09:53.260
I think he took time to go through each of the plagues.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:54.640
I think he dealt with the fact

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:57.080
that there was a separation between the Egyptians

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:58.039
and the children of Israel,

00:09:58.039 --> 00:10:01.039
that there were certain plagues that affected the Egyptians.

00:10:01.039 --> 00:10:03.399
but did not affect the children of Israel.

00:10:03.399 --> 00:10:07.479
I think that Moses provided those kinds of details.

00:10:08.599 --> 00:10:10.159
You ever hear somebody give you a report

00:10:10.159 --> 00:10:12.639
and they provide some information

00:10:12.639 --> 00:10:14.199
and sometimes we say,

00:10:14.199 --> 00:10:17.179
hold on, tell me a little bit more about that.

00:10:17.179 --> 00:10:19.039
You kind of just skipped over that.

00:10:19.039 --> 00:10:21.319
You kind of just summarized that part of it.

00:10:21.319 --> 00:10:23.279
But I want to know the details.

00:10:23.279 --> 00:10:26.039
And some people are very detailed oriented.

00:10:26.039 --> 00:10:28.119
If I tell my mom a story, she's here this morning,

00:10:28.119 --> 00:10:29.599
she wants all the details.

00:10:29.599 --> 00:10:30.719
She doesn't want the summary.

00:10:30.719 --> 00:10:31.999
She wants to know the details.

00:10:31.999 --> 00:10:33.319
And I appreciate that.

00:10:33.319 --> 00:10:34.599
And there's some people that are saying,

00:10:34.599 --> 00:10:36.599
just give me the summary.

00:10:36.599 --> 00:10:38.199
I just read the end notes.

00:10:38.199 --> 00:10:40.039
No, no, but some people want the details.

00:10:40.039 --> 00:10:42.119
And I think that this reunion,

00:10:42.119 --> 00:10:45.039
that begins there in those verses,

00:10:45.039 --> 00:10:46.859
as we read in verses one through seven,

00:10:46.859 --> 00:10:50.119
that it leads to this report that Moses would deliver.

00:10:50.119 --> 00:10:51.879
And the first part of that report

00:10:51.879 --> 00:10:54.639
is all that the Lord had done unto Pharaoh

00:10:54.639 --> 00:10:56.599
and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake.

00:10:56.599 --> 00:11:00.399
Can you imagine, as the Bible tells us in verse number one,

00:11:01.079 --> 00:11:02.399
that Jethro heard,

00:11:03.919 --> 00:11:07.799
but now he gets to hear a report directly from Moses.

00:11:07.799 --> 00:11:09.599
That's a little bit different, isn't it?

00:11:09.599 --> 00:11:11.239
You ever hear a report from someone else,

00:11:11.239 --> 00:11:14.019
some second-hand source, and someone tells you about it,

00:11:14.019 --> 00:11:16.599
but then all of a sudden you get to go face-to-face

00:11:16.599 --> 00:11:18.519
with the person that experienced it,

00:11:18.519 --> 00:11:20.199
and they get to provide you with,

00:11:20.199 --> 00:11:23.019
oh man, just a different perspective altogether.

00:11:23.919 --> 00:11:25.759
Moses was there.

00:11:25.759 --> 00:11:27.279
Moses was living that.

00:11:27.279 --> 00:11:28.799
Moses was interacting.

00:11:28.799 --> 00:11:31.199
He was entering into the court of Pharaoh.

00:11:31.199 --> 00:11:33.039
He was the one that was raising up,

00:11:33.039 --> 00:11:34.399
and Aaron there with them,

00:11:34.399 --> 00:11:36.039
and they would see the plagues,

00:11:36.039 --> 00:11:37.559
and they would see them come,

00:11:37.559 --> 00:11:39.279
and we find that there were times

00:11:39.279 --> 00:11:41.439
in which Moses would say to Pharaoh,

00:11:41.439 --> 00:11:44.399
okay, at the appointed time, I'll raise my hand.

00:11:44.399 --> 00:11:46.199
He's following the direction of the Lord,

00:11:46.199 --> 00:11:49.259
and the plague will be stayed, and I mean, it's amazing.

00:11:51.519 --> 00:11:53.979
And now Moses is rehearsing this firsthand.

00:11:53.979 --> 00:11:54.939
You know what Moses is doing?

00:11:54.939 --> 00:11:56.799
He's declaring how great God is.

00:11:57.799 --> 00:12:00.759
He's declaring how great God is.

00:12:00.759 --> 00:12:02.719
He's great in power.

00:12:02.719 --> 00:12:04.959
We dealt with that many, many months ago,

00:12:04.959 --> 00:12:08.839
and we find that Moses is giving in this report

00:12:08.839 --> 00:12:11.199
to his father-in-law.

00:12:11.199 --> 00:12:15.279
The first part of this report is the plagues in Egypt,

00:12:15.279 --> 00:12:16.919
and to the Egyptians.

00:12:16.919 --> 00:12:19.039
Notice it says, for Israel's sake.

00:12:19.039 --> 00:12:23.319
Listen, I'm thankful that God is working for his people.

00:12:23.319 --> 00:12:24.619
Aren't you thankful for that?

00:12:24.619 --> 00:12:26.719
I mean, listen, when you think about it this morning,

00:12:27.439 --> 00:12:29.639
when the Bible says this, who can be against us?

00:12:29.639 --> 00:12:30.479
Right, why?

00:12:30.479 --> 00:12:32.179
Because God is for us.

00:12:32.179 --> 00:12:34.799
We sing the song, I'm on the winning side.

00:12:34.799 --> 00:12:39.799
Listen, I am so thankful that God works on our behalf.

00:12:40.399 --> 00:12:41.879
Aren't you thankful for that?

00:12:41.879 --> 00:12:45.719
I mean, hallelujah, and what a joy to know

00:12:45.719 --> 00:12:48.839
that God was working for Israel's sake.

00:12:48.839 --> 00:12:50.639
He was working for his people,

00:12:50.639 --> 00:12:52.559
and he was demonstrating his power,

00:12:52.559 --> 00:12:55.919
but notice that part two, as we look at verse number eight,

00:12:55.919 --> 00:12:59.759
then the Bible says this, and all the travail

00:12:59.759 --> 00:13:03.199
that had come upon them by the way.

00:13:04.199 --> 00:13:07.719
Now all of a sudden, we go from part one of this report

00:13:07.719 --> 00:13:11.079
with the plagues in Egypt, to part two of this report,

00:13:11.079 --> 00:13:13.219
the problems along the way.

00:13:13.219 --> 00:13:14.959
You ever have problems in life?

00:13:14.959 --> 00:13:16.219
Ha ha.

00:13:16.219 --> 00:13:18.159
You say, pastor, how much time do you have?

00:13:18.159 --> 00:13:20.079
And I got problems, right?

00:13:20.079 --> 00:13:22.439
We all have problems, we understand it.

00:13:22.439 --> 00:13:25.519
Man that's born of woman is few days and full of trouble,

00:13:26.079 --> 00:13:27.599
the Bible tells us, and we find here,

00:13:27.599 --> 00:13:30.679
the Bible speaks about the travail

00:13:30.679 --> 00:13:32.999
that had come upon them by the way.

00:13:32.999 --> 00:13:35.599
That word travail means toil, it means hardship,

00:13:35.599 --> 00:13:37.599
it means distress.

00:13:37.599 --> 00:13:39.839
And we find this morning that if you were to go back

00:13:39.839 --> 00:13:42.939
and you look at the Exodus, and you understand

00:13:42.939 --> 00:13:45.199
what takes place after the death of the firstborn

00:13:45.199 --> 00:13:48.839
in that 10th plague, that they leave Egypt land,

00:13:48.839 --> 00:13:50.879
and the Bible tells us that they camp

00:13:50.879 --> 00:13:52.759
in a place called Pi-ha-hireth,

00:13:52.759 --> 00:13:54.359
and then the next day they're there,

00:13:54.359 --> 00:13:56.479
and there's the Red Sea.

00:13:56.479 --> 00:13:57.439
And what happens?

00:13:57.439 --> 00:13:59.699
Well, the Egyptians are in hot pursuit.

00:14:00.959 --> 00:14:03.319
God leads them through the Red Sea,

00:14:03.319 --> 00:14:04.639
the midst of the Red Sea.

00:14:04.639 --> 00:14:07.299
Man, what a blessing to think about God's power.

00:14:08.559 --> 00:14:11.039
Exodus chapter 14 records that for us,

00:14:11.039 --> 00:14:16.039
and it is a mountaintop of chapters in God's word

00:14:16.039 --> 00:14:19.559
when you read how God worked and what God did.

00:14:19.559 --> 00:14:21.519
You read chapter 15 of the book of Exodus,

00:14:21.519 --> 00:14:23.599
and you find a people, the people of God

00:14:23.599 --> 00:14:25.839
that are rejoicing, they're singing the song of Moses,

00:14:25.839 --> 00:14:29.319
they're speaking about how great God is.

00:14:29.319 --> 00:14:30.399
And you get to the end of the chapter,

00:14:30.399 --> 00:14:32.199
and they're complaining.

00:14:32.199 --> 00:14:34.239
Because there's no, there's bitter water.

00:14:35.439 --> 00:14:37.119
There's bitter water.

00:14:37.119 --> 00:14:40.079
Moses, we're gonna die, right?

00:14:40.079 --> 00:14:41.319
Those children of Israel.

00:14:42.699 --> 00:14:43.839
So what does Moses do?

00:14:43.839 --> 00:14:46.239
Well, he gives this report to his father-in-law.

00:14:46.239 --> 00:14:51.239
He covers the plagues, but then he covers the problems.

00:14:51.439 --> 00:14:53.879
Listen, in our lives, we understand

00:14:53.879 --> 00:14:56.799
there are gonna be some problems along the way.

00:14:56.799 --> 00:14:59.359
And we find that as Moses would begin

00:14:59.359 --> 00:15:02.299
to speak about the bitter water,

00:15:02.299 --> 00:15:04.159
but then we find that the second problem

00:15:04.159 --> 00:15:05.819
that the children of Israel would experience

00:15:05.819 --> 00:15:08.239
after the bitter water is a place where they would come

00:15:08.239 --> 00:15:09.839
and there's no water.

00:15:09.839 --> 00:15:14.259
And we find that they would have this need for food,

00:15:14.259 --> 00:15:17.479
and by the way, God knows he made us, he is the creator.

00:15:17.479 --> 00:15:20.319
He knows that we need food, and he knows that we need water,

00:15:20.359 --> 00:15:22.279
and he's able to sustain us.

00:15:22.279 --> 00:15:25.919
We spoke as we looked at discovering the greatness of God,

00:15:25.919 --> 00:15:28.359
that God cares for his children.

00:15:30.399 --> 00:15:32.179
God sent manna from heaven.

00:15:33.439 --> 00:15:34.359
It's amazing.

00:15:34.359 --> 00:15:37.539
You think about the manna that God sent from heaven.

00:15:37.539 --> 00:15:39.919
And God gave him specific instruction

00:15:39.919 --> 00:15:42.079
with regard to the gathering of the manna,

00:15:42.079 --> 00:15:43.719
and he provided them with instruction

00:15:43.719 --> 00:15:45.879
with regard to which days to gather

00:15:45.879 --> 00:15:47.799
and which day not to gather.

00:15:47.799 --> 00:15:50.279
And you know, there are some people that were doubters,

00:15:51.119 --> 00:15:51.959
there are some people that didn't think

00:15:51.959 --> 00:15:53.339
it was really gonna work that way.

00:15:53.339 --> 00:15:55.799
There were some that gathered more

00:15:55.799 --> 00:15:57.199
when they weren't supposed to,

00:15:57.199 --> 00:15:59.839
and they tried to keep it overnight for the next day,

00:15:59.839 --> 00:16:02.079
not having faith that God would provide it

00:16:02.079 --> 00:16:04.599
on the second day, and what happened to that manna?

00:16:04.599 --> 00:16:06.999
Well, the Bible tells us that it got some worms

00:16:06.999 --> 00:16:08.119
and it stank.

00:16:11.119 --> 00:16:12.839
So I then think that some of those same people,

00:16:12.839 --> 00:16:14.719
when it came to the day where they're not supposed

00:16:14.719 --> 00:16:16.119
to gather, or excuse me,

00:16:16.119 --> 00:16:17.799
where they're supposed to gather twice, why?

00:16:17.799 --> 00:16:19.879
Because on the Sabbath there will be no manna,

00:16:20.479 --> 00:16:23.519
well, I don't know, because it had worms

00:16:23.519 --> 00:16:25.559
and it stank earlier, so I'm not sure,

00:16:25.559 --> 00:16:28.759
and they went out looking for it and there was none.

00:16:30.559 --> 00:16:33.359
God provided miraculously for his people.

00:16:34.399 --> 00:16:38.319
And we find that as Jethro is receiving this report

00:16:38.319 --> 00:16:41.119
that Moses is delivering again,

00:16:41.119 --> 00:16:44.479
Moses is the man of God, he's the eyewitness,

00:16:44.479 --> 00:16:47.239
he's the one that experienced this firsthand,

00:16:47.239 --> 00:16:50.639
he's now delivering this message to his father-in-law,

00:16:50.639 --> 00:16:53.559
and he's speaking about what God has done,

00:16:53.559 --> 00:16:55.039
the plagues and the problems,

00:16:55.039 --> 00:16:57.839
but I want you to notice the end of verse number nine,

00:16:57.839 --> 00:16:59.039
excuse me, the end of verse number eight,

00:16:59.039 --> 00:17:03.559
where the Bible says, and how the Lord delivered them.

00:17:03.559 --> 00:17:05.759
I'm thankful for God's deliverance,

00:17:05.759 --> 00:17:08.079
I'm thankful for God's provision, his power,

00:17:08.079 --> 00:17:10.719
I'm thankful for, as Moses was able to speak

00:17:10.719 --> 00:17:12.439
about the troubles that they endured,

00:17:12.439 --> 00:17:14.039
the problems that they had,

00:17:14.039 --> 00:17:16.719
that at the same time he was able to give testimony

00:17:16.719 --> 00:17:18.479
of what God did.

00:17:18.479 --> 00:17:20.619
Listen, we came to a place called Marah

00:17:20.619 --> 00:17:22.019
where there was bitter water,

00:17:22.019 --> 00:17:23.639
but let me tell you what God did,

00:17:23.639 --> 00:17:26.359
let me tell you how God made that bitter water

00:17:26.359 --> 00:17:29.599
that was not capable for us to partake of,

00:17:29.599 --> 00:17:33.199
it would kill us, that he caused us to have direction

00:17:33.199 --> 00:17:34.879
with putting that tree in there

00:17:34.879 --> 00:17:37.079
to make those bitter waters sweet.

00:17:38.199 --> 00:17:39.119
That's amazing.

00:17:40.039 --> 00:17:42.399
And then let me tell you about when we get there

00:17:42.399 --> 00:17:45.079
and there's no water and what God did,

00:17:45.079 --> 00:17:47.199
and I believe, and I know I've said this before

00:17:47.199 --> 00:17:49.699
from this Pope, but I believe with all of my heart

00:17:49.699 --> 00:17:52.159
that the reason that God allowed them to go to a place

00:17:52.159 --> 00:17:54.539
where there was no water is because if they came

00:17:54.539 --> 00:17:56.919
to a place again where there was bitter water

00:17:56.919 --> 00:17:59.079
that they would have tried to lean on their own understanding

00:17:59.079 --> 00:18:00.859
and they would have tried to find a tree

00:18:00.859 --> 00:18:04.719
that was like the tree in Marah and put it into the water.

00:18:04.719 --> 00:18:05.599
Why do I believe that?

00:18:05.599 --> 00:18:07.119
Because that's human nature.

00:18:09.759 --> 00:18:12.159
That's why sometimes our problems are different

00:18:12.999 --> 00:18:15.159
each time we go through life.

00:18:15.159 --> 00:18:17.119
Little different than it was last time, why?

00:18:17.119 --> 00:18:19.839
Because you're not gonna try the same solution.

00:18:19.839 --> 00:18:21.899
You're gonna depend upon God.

00:18:21.899 --> 00:18:25.479
Trust him to see what he's able to do.

00:18:25.479 --> 00:18:28.959
And we find that Moses is able to tell them

00:18:28.959 --> 00:18:31.959
about the place where there's no water

00:18:31.959 --> 00:18:34.440
and the people are complaining and the people are upset

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:38.440
and God tells Moses to go and I'm gonna show you a rock

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:41.000
and I'm gonna provide water out of the rock.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.839
Now, I just wanna think about Jethro for a moment.

00:18:43.839 --> 00:18:46.320
Can you imagine as he's hearing this?

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:47.159
Can you imagine?

00:18:47.159 --> 00:18:50.219
I've never seen water come out of a rock.

00:18:50.219 --> 00:18:53.000
I mean, I've been to places where there's fresh water

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.239
that's coming in the mountains and so on and so forth

00:18:55.239 --> 00:18:57.279
but I mean, I'm talking about a dry rock.

00:18:57.279 --> 00:18:59.279
I'm talking about a place where there's nothing,

00:18:59.279 --> 00:19:01.079
where there's no water, where the people say

00:19:01.079 --> 00:19:04.339
we're gonna die for thirst and God leads a man

00:19:04.339 --> 00:19:07.199
directly to a particular rock and says,

00:19:07.199 --> 00:19:11.519
that rock smite it and he does and their water gushes out.

00:19:11.519 --> 00:19:13.239
That's amazing.

00:19:13.239 --> 00:19:15.639
Absolutely miraculous.

00:19:15.639 --> 00:19:18.799
And I think about Jethro as he's receiving this report

00:19:18.799 --> 00:19:20.679
and as he's hearing it and here's the thing,

00:19:20.679 --> 00:19:21.599
have you ever been in a place,

00:19:21.599 --> 00:19:22.880
I said this to somebody yesterday,

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:24.719
have you ever been in a place where you said to somebody,

00:19:24.719 --> 00:19:25.919
that's unbelievable?

00:19:27.279 --> 00:19:28.880
It's unbelievable.

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:31.179
See, it's only unbelievable, here's what I said,

00:19:31.179 --> 00:19:33.279
the full context of my statement was this,

00:19:33.279 --> 00:19:36.559
it's unbelievable except for the fact that God said it

00:19:36.559 --> 00:19:39.919
and therefore it's believable, right?

00:19:39.919 --> 00:19:42.699
But somebody, listen, Moses experienced it.

00:19:42.699 --> 00:19:44.359
Have you ever been in a situation

00:19:44.359 --> 00:19:45.839
where somebody's telling you a story

00:19:45.839 --> 00:19:47.880
and you say, I can't believe that.

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:49.639
I mean, come on, seriously?

00:19:49.639 --> 00:19:51.719
And you say, no, no, it really happened,

00:19:51.719 --> 00:19:55.719
like I was there, I saw it, I experienced it.

00:19:55.719 --> 00:19:57.639
And Moses had given this report

00:19:58.599 --> 00:20:01.199
and as Moses is declaring the greatness of God.

00:20:01.199 --> 00:20:04.319
And as Moses is testifying of how great God is,

00:20:04.319 --> 00:20:07.119
and how wonderful God is, and what God has done,

00:20:07.119 --> 00:20:09.719
we find that Jethro is receiving all of this.

00:20:09.719 --> 00:20:11.719
He's taking all of this in,

00:20:11.719 --> 00:20:14.939
and he's hearing all of these wonderful things.

00:20:16.479 --> 00:20:18.219
So we see their reunion,

00:20:19.299 --> 00:20:22.519
followed by the report.

00:20:22.519 --> 00:20:25.379
Then we come here to the latter part

00:20:25.379 --> 00:20:26.439
of the text of scripture

00:20:26.439 --> 00:20:28.119
that we're going to focus on this morning.

00:20:28.119 --> 00:20:30.119
And I want you to notice number three,

00:20:30.119 --> 00:20:31.439
if you're taking notes this morning,

00:20:31.439 --> 00:20:35.039
number three, the response of Jethro.

00:20:35.039 --> 00:20:36.599
The response of Jethro.

00:20:36.599 --> 00:20:38.159
I'll read all three verses

00:20:38.159 --> 00:20:40.119
that detail for us his response,

00:20:40.119 --> 00:20:41.539
and then we'll get into the details.

00:20:41.539 --> 00:20:42.919
Notice in verse number nine,

00:20:42.919 --> 00:20:43.759
the Bible says,

00:20:43.759 --> 00:20:47.299
and Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness

00:20:47.299 --> 00:20:49.199
which the Lord had done to Israel,

00:20:49.199 --> 00:20:52.259
whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians.

00:20:52.259 --> 00:20:53.199
And Jethro said,

00:20:53.199 --> 00:20:56.439
blessed be the Lord who hath delivered you

00:20:56.439 --> 00:20:58.179
out of the hand of the Egyptians

00:20:58.179 --> 00:21:00.039
and out of the hand of Pharaoh.

00:21:00.759 --> 00:21:01.879
Who hath delivered the people

00:21:01.879 --> 00:21:04.479
from under the hand of the Egyptians.

00:21:04.479 --> 00:21:05.879
Notice verse number 11.

00:21:05.879 --> 00:21:10.879
Now I know that the Lord is greater than all gods.

00:21:12.079 --> 00:21:13.619
That's a powerful statement.

00:21:14.999 --> 00:21:17.399
For in the thing wherein they dealt proudly,

00:21:17.399 --> 00:21:22.099
he Jehovah God, the Lord God Almighty was above them.

00:21:22.099 --> 00:21:22.939
In verse 12,

00:21:22.939 --> 00:21:26.039
and Jethro Moses' father-in-law took a burnt offering

00:21:26.039 --> 00:21:27.559
and sacrifices for God.

00:21:27.559 --> 00:21:29.759
And Aaron came and all the elders of Israel

00:21:30.519 --> 00:21:31.799
to eat bread with Moses,

00:21:31.799 --> 00:21:35.039
with Moses' father-in-law before God.

00:21:35.039 --> 00:21:36.959
Verses nine through 12 record for us

00:21:36.959 --> 00:21:38.719
the response of Jethro.

00:21:38.719 --> 00:21:41.839
Again, we see the reunion and we see this report.

00:21:41.839 --> 00:21:44.399
It's one verse of scripture in verse number eight

00:21:44.399 --> 00:21:46.079
that provides us with the report

00:21:46.079 --> 00:21:48.479
that Moses would deliver to his father-in-law.

00:21:48.479 --> 00:21:51.519
But then we see the response of Jethro here

00:21:51.519 --> 00:21:52.959
beginning in verse number nine.

00:21:52.959 --> 00:21:53.999
Notice first of all,

00:21:53.999 --> 00:21:56.839
his response was one of rejoicing.

00:21:56.839 --> 00:21:57.919
One of rejoicing.

00:21:57.919 --> 00:22:00.679
Listen, it's good for us to rejoice.

00:22:00.679 --> 00:22:02.679
It's good for us to rejoice when we hear

00:22:02.679 --> 00:22:05.199
of how great God is and what God is doing.

00:22:05.199 --> 00:22:06.999
And we find that the Bible says,

00:22:06.999 --> 00:22:09.479
and Jethro rejoiced.

00:22:09.479 --> 00:22:12.719
Isn't that what you would expect the response to be?

00:22:13.799 --> 00:22:16.299
Honestly, rejoicing.

00:22:17.719 --> 00:22:20.359
I would expect that response

00:22:20.359 --> 00:22:22.919
when I understand the content of the report

00:22:22.919 --> 00:22:23.959
in verse number eight,

00:22:23.959 --> 00:22:27.159
when I'm understanding all that Moses would be delivering

00:22:27.199 --> 00:22:31.199
because the Bible again says that Moses told him

00:22:31.199 --> 00:22:33.679
all that the Lord had done unto Pharaoh

00:22:33.679 --> 00:22:35.599
and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake

00:22:35.599 --> 00:22:38.879
and all the travail that had come upon them by the way

00:22:38.879 --> 00:22:40.279
and how the Lord delivered them.

00:22:40.279 --> 00:22:43.799
And therefore, the Bible says that Jethro rejoiced.

00:22:43.799 --> 00:22:45.639
He's rejoicing.

00:22:45.639 --> 00:22:47.579
You know, it's good for us to rejoice.

00:22:48.439 --> 00:22:50.159
It's easy for us to complain.

00:22:51.499 --> 00:22:54.319
We have to be purposed to rejoice.

00:22:54.319 --> 00:22:57.319
Honestly, complaining comes naturally for you and for me.

00:22:58.239 --> 00:22:59.559
It's a human tendency,

00:22:59.559 --> 00:23:02.839
a natural human tendency to complain.

00:23:02.839 --> 00:23:05.079
We have to be purposed to rejoice.

00:23:05.079 --> 00:23:08.079
Can I tell you we have much to rejoice for?

00:23:08.079 --> 00:23:09.139
To rejoice in?

00:23:10.319 --> 00:23:14.759
We serve a great God who's able to do amazing things.

00:23:14.759 --> 00:23:16.239
And we know him.

00:23:16.239 --> 00:23:18.199
He's revealed himself to us.

00:23:18.199 --> 00:23:19.359
It's amazing.

00:23:19.359 --> 00:23:21.879
We have so much to be thankful for.

00:23:21.879 --> 00:23:26.279
Rejoice in the Lord always.

00:23:26.279 --> 00:23:29.679
And again, I say, rejoice.

00:23:30.759 --> 00:23:32.039
Philippians chapter four.

00:23:33.599 --> 00:23:35.759
What a powerful truth.

00:23:35.759 --> 00:23:37.279
The psalmist said this.

00:23:37.279 --> 00:23:39.199
This is the day the Lord hath made.

00:23:41.199 --> 00:23:44.159
I will rejoice and be glad in it.

00:23:45.119 --> 00:23:48.399
It's a purpose determined perspective.

00:23:49.459 --> 00:23:51.639
He didn't say this is the day the Lord hath made

00:23:52.399 --> 00:23:53.799
and everything's great and everything went

00:23:53.799 --> 00:23:55.839
just according to plan, just how I thought it'd go.

00:23:55.839 --> 00:23:58.199
And so therefore I'm gonna rejoice.

00:23:58.199 --> 00:24:02.459
No, I'm gonna rejoice because God is God and he's my God.

00:24:03.559 --> 00:24:05.719
We find that this rejoicing is given.

00:24:05.719 --> 00:24:08.359
It says that he rejoiced for all the goodness

00:24:08.359 --> 00:24:10.399
which the Lord had done to Israel,

00:24:10.399 --> 00:24:12.719
whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians.

00:24:12.719 --> 00:24:15.439
And then notice the Bible says that he blessed the Lord.

00:24:15.439 --> 00:24:18.519
He says, blessed be the Lord who hath delivered you

00:24:18.519 --> 00:24:19.879
out of the hand of the Egyptians

00:24:19.879 --> 00:24:20.999
out of the hand of Pharaoh,

00:24:20.999 --> 00:24:22.239
who hath delivered the people

00:24:22.239 --> 00:24:23.939
from under the hand of the Egyptians.

00:24:23.939 --> 00:24:27.719
Now you understand that Jethro had some knowledge here.

00:24:27.719 --> 00:24:30.559
Jethro had some knowledge about the Egyptians,

00:24:30.559 --> 00:24:32.799
about their power, about their might.

00:24:32.799 --> 00:24:35.719
Of course, we understand that Moses,

00:24:35.719 --> 00:24:38.299
after the events that took place early in his life

00:24:38.299 --> 00:24:41.199
when he fled to the backside of the desert

00:24:41.199 --> 00:24:42.879
as we often refer to it as,

00:24:42.879 --> 00:24:47.199
that that's when he meets his soon to be wife Zipporah

00:24:47.199 --> 00:24:49.559
and of course his father-in-law there,

00:24:50.239 --> 00:24:52.479
Jethro, and we find that he's a priest of Midian,

00:24:52.479 --> 00:24:55.479
but he hears what God did to the Egyptians.

00:24:57.239 --> 00:24:58.459
God showed his power.

00:24:59.519 --> 00:25:01.159
And we find that this man,

00:25:01.159 --> 00:25:05.599
this response that he gives is so powerful

00:25:05.599 --> 00:25:08.479
as we think about this verbal declaration

00:25:08.479 --> 00:25:10.639
that's given to us in verse number 11.

00:25:10.639 --> 00:25:13.239
He's rejoicing, but then notice specifically

00:25:13.239 --> 00:25:15.279
what he says in verse number 11.

00:25:15.319 --> 00:25:19.759
He says, now, now I know

00:25:19.759 --> 00:25:24.759
that the Lord is greater than all gods.

00:25:25.399 --> 00:25:27.059
Now that's a powerful statement.

00:25:28.159 --> 00:25:31.439
Think about the nation of Egypt, the Egyptian people,

00:25:31.439 --> 00:25:33.519
they were a polytheistic people.

00:25:33.519 --> 00:25:37.099
All of the false gods and all of the idolatrous worship

00:25:37.099 --> 00:25:38.959
that was prevalent there in Egypt.

00:25:38.959 --> 00:25:41.559
And we find that again, there's no doubt

00:25:41.559 --> 00:25:44.899
as Moses is sharing these testimonies

00:25:45.519 --> 00:25:47.179
and giving the report to his father-in-law

00:25:47.179 --> 00:25:51.539
that Jethro is understanding the power

00:25:51.539 --> 00:25:54.179
and the might of Jehovah God.

00:25:57.939 --> 00:26:00.819
But I want you to notice that he says, now I know,

00:26:00.819 --> 00:26:05.819
now I know that the Lord is greater than all gods.

00:26:08.619 --> 00:26:12.139
He had heard in verse number one of chapter 18

00:26:12.139 --> 00:26:14.679
of all that God had done for Moses.

00:26:15.539 --> 00:26:18.139
He had heard much of no doubt

00:26:18.139 --> 00:26:21.019
what Moses actually reported to him.

00:26:21.019 --> 00:26:23.219
But now after hearing it firsthand,

00:26:23.219 --> 00:26:26.019
after having this reunion with Moses,

00:26:26.019 --> 00:26:29.799
he stands and he rejoices and he then makes

00:26:29.799 --> 00:26:34.259
this verbal declaration of his own personal understanding

00:26:34.259 --> 00:26:36.939
of how great God is.

00:26:36.939 --> 00:26:38.659
As we're gonna think about this statement

00:26:38.659 --> 00:26:40.619
and I mentioned by way of introduction

00:26:40.619 --> 00:26:43.819
where the psalmist says in Psalm 135 in verse number five,

00:26:43.819 --> 00:26:46.299
for I know that the Lord is great.

00:26:46.299 --> 00:26:49.339
Listen, we need to have this kind of understanding

00:26:49.339 --> 00:26:53.419
in our lives just as Jethro is going to declare

00:26:53.419 --> 00:26:56.179
verbally what he knows to be true.

00:26:56.179 --> 00:26:58.219
Listen, we as the people of God,

00:26:58.219 --> 00:26:59.459
we need to be able to stand and say,

00:26:59.459 --> 00:27:01.639
I know that God is great.

00:27:02.539 --> 00:27:05.339
There's no one that's gonna convince me otherwise,

00:27:05.339 --> 00:27:07.699
no one is gonna persuade me otherwise

00:27:07.699 --> 00:27:10.699
for I am convinced, I am persuaded,

00:27:10.699 --> 00:27:13.219
I know in whom I have believed.

00:27:14.819 --> 00:27:18.539
And we get into the Bible and we allow the Bible

00:27:18.539 --> 00:27:22.179
to get into us and as we have the truth of God's word

00:27:22.179 --> 00:27:24.819
that has solidified our position with regard

00:27:24.819 --> 00:27:27.639
to who he is and of his greatness.

00:27:28.539 --> 00:27:31.379
We find that this man, Jethro,

00:27:31.379 --> 00:27:34.679
makes this powerful, powerful declaration.

00:27:34.679 --> 00:27:39.079
Now I know that the Lord is greater than all gods.

00:27:39.079 --> 00:27:40.799
From the thing wherein they dealt proudly,

00:27:40.799 --> 00:27:43.499
he was above them.

00:27:43.539 --> 00:27:47.399
Notice after this verbal declaration in verse number 11,

00:27:47.399 --> 00:27:49.539
there's a personal offering that is made

00:27:49.539 --> 00:27:51.919
in verse number 12 where the Bible tells us

00:27:51.919 --> 00:27:53.899
that Jethro, Moses' father-in-law,

00:27:53.899 --> 00:27:58.899
took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God.

00:27:59.019 --> 00:28:02.419
Now this is, these actions in verse number 12

00:28:02.419 --> 00:28:05.099
are actions that support the declaration

00:28:05.099 --> 00:28:06.399
in verse number 11.

00:28:06.399 --> 00:28:09.179
Listen, someone said, I don't know who

00:28:09.179 --> 00:28:11.479
the phrase is attributed to,

00:28:11.479 --> 00:28:13.559
but actions speak louder than words.

00:28:13.559 --> 00:28:14.919
You've heard that before.

00:28:14.919 --> 00:28:17.319
And we find that the Bible says,

00:28:17.319 --> 00:28:19.519
throughout the pages of scripture,

00:28:19.519 --> 00:28:21.599
where Paul will say, listen,

00:28:21.599 --> 00:28:23.279
not only the things that you've heard of me,

00:28:23.279 --> 00:28:25.279
but the things that you've seen in me.

00:28:25.279 --> 00:28:27.439
We find that the Bible speaks about,

00:28:27.439 --> 00:28:31.879
give me thine heart and let thine eyes observe my ways.

00:28:31.879 --> 00:28:34.039
Someone said this talk is cheap

00:28:34.039 --> 00:28:37.259
and we understand some of those phraseologies

00:28:37.259 --> 00:28:39.079
and some of those pithy statements.

00:28:39.079 --> 00:28:42.139
But this morning, as we look at this text of scripture

00:28:42.139 --> 00:28:45.299
and we see the verbal declaration in verse number 11,

00:28:45.299 --> 00:28:47.199
where Jethro stands and he says,

00:28:47.199 --> 00:28:50.979
he makes this powerful statement of the greatness of God,

00:28:50.979 --> 00:28:54.579
but then the action that follows supports what he says,

00:28:54.579 --> 00:28:57.599
where he then takes a burnt offering

00:28:57.599 --> 00:28:59.519
and sacrifices for God.

00:29:01.139 --> 00:29:04.739
His actions are aligning with what he's declared.

00:29:05.739 --> 00:29:09.179
Listen, when we know that God is great,

00:29:09.179 --> 00:29:12.079
it ought to impact how we live our lives.

00:29:12.079 --> 00:29:14.799
It ought to impact how we behave, what we do.

00:29:14.799 --> 00:29:17.079
That's why at the end of this year,

00:29:17.079 --> 00:29:20.559
as we look at this three phases, if you will,

00:29:20.559 --> 00:29:22.039
of this particular theme,

00:29:22.039 --> 00:29:24.179
that yes, we want to discover God's greatness

00:29:24.179 --> 00:29:26.199
and yes, we want to declare God's greatness,

00:29:26.199 --> 00:29:27.719
but eventually what has to happen

00:29:27.719 --> 00:29:31.159
is I have to live in light of God's greatness.

00:29:31.159 --> 00:29:35.379
The truth of God's word must impact my daily behavior.

00:29:35.379 --> 00:29:39.019
I see as I study the scriptures, as I look to God's word,

00:29:39.019 --> 00:29:43.059
I find that belief impacts behavior.

00:29:45.379 --> 00:29:48.019
The fool hath said in his heart, there is no God.

00:29:48.019 --> 00:29:49.839
That's why he acts foolish.

00:29:53.859 --> 00:29:56.659
But when we understand we have belief,

00:29:56.659 --> 00:29:58.619
it's gonna impact our behavior.

00:29:58.619 --> 00:30:00.579
It's gonna impact how we live.

00:30:00.579 --> 00:30:01.839
Listen, if you.

00:30:01.839 --> 00:30:03.559
believe this morning that God answers prayer,

00:30:03.559 --> 00:30:04.459
you're gonna pray.

00:30:07.279 --> 00:30:10.039
If you don't really think that God answers prayer,

00:30:10.039 --> 00:30:11.139
you're not gonna pray.

00:30:12.279 --> 00:30:13.679
I talked to somebody recently,

00:30:13.679 --> 00:30:15.639
and here's what the person said to me recently,

00:30:15.639 --> 00:30:16.839
is within the last couple of weeks,

00:30:16.839 --> 00:30:17.839
here's what the person said to me,

00:30:17.839 --> 00:30:19.599
I really wanna, in my mind,

00:30:19.599 --> 00:30:21.599
I wanna believe that God does not exist.

00:30:24.119 --> 00:30:27.279
And then they said, but I know that's not true.

00:30:27.279 --> 00:30:29.959
Okay, but in my mind, I wanna believe that.

00:30:29.999 --> 00:30:31.919
And then about four minutes later in the conversation,

00:30:31.919 --> 00:30:33.519
they said this, I don't understand

00:30:33.519 --> 00:30:35.379
why God doesn't answer my prayers.

00:30:37.319 --> 00:30:39.519
Hold on a minute, let me understand this.

00:30:39.519 --> 00:30:42.239
The God that you said you hope doesn't exist,

00:30:42.239 --> 00:30:45.599
you're confused as to why he's not answering your prayers?

00:30:47.359 --> 00:30:49.319
And they looked at me and said, it's kind of strange, huh?

00:30:49.319 --> 00:30:52.559
Yeah, yeah, I don't have a degree for that, amen.

00:30:52.559 --> 00:30:54.359
But the reality is that, listen,

00:30:54.359 --> 00:30:57.939
if we know that God answers prayer, I'm gonna pray.

00:30:58.939 --> 00:31:02.499
My behavior is impacted by my belief.

00:31:05.819 --> 00:31:08.679
But my behavior reveals what I believe.

00:31:09.819 --> 00:31:13.739
When you see somebody that doesn't pray,

00:31:13.739 --> 00:31:16.039
they must not believe that God answers prayer.

00:31:17.339 --> 00:31:18.659
It goes both ways.

00:31:20.359 --> 00:31:24.099
And this morning, as we look at the declaration

00:31:24.099 --> 00:31:27.799
in verse number 11, we see the action in verse number 12,

00:31:28.639 --> 00:31:29.999
where Jethro says, I know,

00:31:29.999 --> 00:31:33.519
I know that he's greater than all gods.

00:31:34.599 --> 00:31:36.839
Now I'm gonna bring an offering,

00:31:36.839 --> 00:31:38.799
a burnt offering and a sacrifice.

00:31:38.799 --> 00:31:42.679
And his actions are aligning with what he's declared,

00:31:42.679 --> 00:31:45.079
what he's given this statement,

00:31:45.079 --> 00:31:47.199
this proclamation in verse number 11.

00:31:47.199 --> 00:31:50.479
And we find that the Bible tells us that Aaron came

00:31:51.479 --> 00:31:54.559
and all the elders of Israel to eat bread

00:31:54.559 --> 00:31:57.799
with Moses' father-in-law before God.

00:31:57.799 --> 00:31:59.159
Can you imagine?

00:31:59.159 --> 00:32:02.439
I mean, what a scene here in verse number 12,

00:32:02.439 --> 00:32:03.999
as you look at what's taking place

00:32:03.999 --> 00:32:08.999
and you see this man, Jethro, who had heard some things,

00:32:09.279 --> 00:32:12.519
who's the priest of Midian, and he's there

00:32:12.519 --> 00:32:14.439
and he's heard about what God has done,

00:32:14.439 --> 00:32:16.679
but he comes and he receives this report

00:32:16.679 --> 00:32:18.939
and he has this time with Moses,

00:32:18.939 --> 00:32:22.919
where Moses is providing firsthand all that God has done

00:32:22.919 --> 00:32:25.139
and who God is, and the Bible says

00:32:25.139 --> 00:32:27.459
that he's gonna respond by rejoicing,

00:32:27.459 --> 00:32:30.839
by declaring, and then by sacrificing.

00:32:30.839 --> 00:32:32.459
Wow.

00:32:32.459 --> 00:32:34.839
And Aaron's there and all the elders of Israel.

00:32:34.839 --> 00:32:36.879
I mean, this is a big deal.

00:32:36.879 --> 00:32:37.819
It's exciting.

00:32:38.759 --> 00:32:41.879
As I look at this passage of scripture this morning,

00:32:41.879 --> 00:32:44.119
and we look at these three points,

00:32:44.119 --> 00:32:45.659
these three thoughts with regard

00:32:45.659 --> 00:32:47.959
to the outline of the message,

00:32:47.959 --> 00:32:50.959
I really have three thoughts for us in closing this morning.

00:32:53.119 --> 00:32:54.839
And I'd like for us to consider,

00:32:55.919 --> 00:32:57.399
as we look at this portion of scripture,

00:32:57.399 --> 00:32:59.179
number one is this.

00:32:59.179 --> 00:33:03.479
Have you personally experienced the greatness of God

00:33:03.479 --> 00:33:04.539
as Moses did?

00:33:05.959 --> 00:33:08.079
In your life personally,

00:33:08.079 --> 00:33:11.239
have you experienced the greatness of God?

00:33:11.239 --> 00:33:13.079
Moses experienced it personally.

00:33:14.339 --> 00:33:16.039
Moses was able to give the report

00:33:16.039 --> 00:33:18.239
that he gives in verse number eight

00:33:18.239 --> 00:33:21.639
because he experienced God's greatness personally.

00:33:22.959 --> 00:33:24.679
Hey, do you know that God's great?

00:33:26.239 --> 00:33:30.759
Can you testify of God's greatness in your life personally?

00:33:30.759 --> 00:33:32.079
And we find this morning,

00:33:32.079 --> 00:33:34.599
listen, if you've not ever personally experienced

00:33:34.599 --> 00:33:35.679
the greatness of God,

00:33:35.679 --> 00:33:37.839
I wanna encourage you this morning,

00:33:37.839 --> 00:33:39.919
if you've never been saved by the grace of God,

00:33:39.919 --> 00:33:42.359
that today is the day of salvation.

00:33:42.359 --> 00:33:43.839
And what great, I mean,

00:33:43.839 --> 00:33:48.839
think about God's grace and his love in saving us.

00:33:49.259 --> 00:33:51.559
Man, hallelujah.

00:33:51.559 --> 00:33:52.479
The greatness of God,

00:33:52.479 --> 00:33:54.079
the great plan of redemption

00:33:54.079 --> 00:33:55.919
as we dealt with a few weeks ago.

00:33:57.159 --> 00:33:59.939
Then I begin to think about God working in my life.

00:34:01.039 --> 00:34:03.779
God's showing me personally day by day.

00:34:03.779 --> 00:34:05.439
I dealt with this on Wednesday evening.

00:34:05.439 --> 00:34:06.279
If you were here,

00:34:06.279 --> 00:34:07.879
as we're studying through the book of Ruth,

00:34:10.159 --> 00:34:12.439
Naomi didn't get to experience personally

00:34:12.439 --> 00:34:14.759
how God visited the people.

00:34:14.759 --> 00:34:15.739
She only heard.

00:34:17.079 --> 00:34:18.599
She only heard.

00:34:18.599 --> 00:34:19.419
Why?

00:34:19.419 --> 00:34:20.259
Because she was in Moab.

00:34:21.599 --> 00:34:23.479
They left Bethlehem.

00:34:23.479 --> 00:34:26.419
Elimelech led the family to leave Bethlehem, Judah.

00:34:27.279 --> 00:34:29.019
And they went to Moab.

00:34:29.019 --> 00:34:31.919
And after 10 years of famine and three funerals,

00:34:33.239 --> 00:34:34.219
she hears.

00:34:35.279 --> 00:34:38.099
The Lord visited her people and giving them bread.

00:34:39.519 --> 00:34:42.319
She didn't get to experience it personally,

00:34:42.319 --> 00:34:43.919
but she got to hear about it.

00:34:43.919 --> 00:34:45.839
And I said this on Wednesday evening,

00:34:45.839 --> 00:34:47.799
I don't wanna just hear about what God's doing

00:34:47.799 --> 00:34:49.359
in someone else's life,

00:34:49.359 --> 00:34:51.039
in some other place.

00:34:51.519 --> 00:34:54.479
I wanna experience what God's doing in my life.

00:34:54.479 --> 00:34:56.279
Listen, it's exciting to hear what God's doing

00:34:56.279 --> 00:34:57.339
in somebody else's life.

00:34:57.339 --> 00:34:58.319
It really is.

00:34:58.319 --> 00:35:00.879
It's exciting to get to hear what God's doing

00:35:00.879 --> 00:35:03.779
in some other church and some other missionary

00:35:03.779 --> 00:35:05.279
that we have the privilege of supporting

00:35:05.279 --> 00:35:06.239
and receiving those reports.

00:35:06.239 --> 00:35:08.959
Listen, it encourages my heart,

00:35:08.959 --> 00:35:10.679
but it's not enough for me.

00:35:10.679 --> 00:35:11.839
It's not enough for me to just hear

00:35:11.839 --> 00:35:13.119
what God's doing in your life.

00:35:13.119 --> 00:35:14.719
It's not enough for me to hear what God's doing

00:35:14.719 --> 00:35:16.399
on the mission field or in some other church.

00:35:16.399 --> 00:35:20.119
I wanna see God work personally in my life.

00:35:20.119 --> 00:35:23.099
I wanna experience personally the greatness of God.

00:35:24.559 --> 00:35:26.479
Let me ask this question.

00:35:26.479 --> 00:35:29.319
Are you personally declaring God's greatness with others?

00:35:31.039 --> 00:35:32.239
Moses had an opportunity.

00:35:32.239 --> 00:35:34.919
Yes, Jethro heard and Jethro came.

00:35:34.919 --> 00:35:36.959
He traveled and he comes to this place

00:35:36.959 --> 00:35:38.919
and he enters into the tent

00:35:38.919 --> 00:35:40.859
after they'd asked of each other's welfare.

00:35:40.859 --> 00:35:43.119
And Moses has the opportunity to declare

00:35:43.119 --> 00:35:44.659
all that God has done.

00:35:46.039 --> 00:35:47.139
I wonder this morning,

00:35:48.139 --> 00:35:50.499
are you declaring God's greatness with others?

00:35:51.659 --> 00:35:53.579
See, no one wants to hear.

00:35:53.579 --> 00:35:55.139
Just keep looking for somebody.

00:35:56.699 --> 00:35:59.399
Just look, there's a lot of hurting people in our world.

00:36:00.739 --> 00:36:02.379
You know what I've learned?

00:36:02.379 --> 00:36:03.979
People like to hear stories.

00:36:05.619 --> 00:36:06.539
I use the word story.

00:36:06.539 --> 00:36:09.099
They like to hear what God's doing in people's lives.

00:36:09.099 --> 00:36:10.819
Can I tell you what God's done for me?

00:36:10.819 --> 00:36:12.139
Some people are like, ah, I don't wanna hear that,

00:36:12.139 --> 00:36:13.539
but some people are like, eh.

00:36:14.979 --> 00:36:16.539
Give some interest to that.

00:36:16.539 --> 00:36:17.859
I have found personally,

00:36:17.859 --> 00:36:20.059
in trying to reach people with the gospel,

00:36:20.059 --> 00:36:21.059
for years and years and years,

00:36:21.059 --> 00:36:23.659
it's how I was trained, it's how I was taught,

00:36:23.659 --> 00:36:25.579
that when you go and engage somebody with the gospel,

00:36:25.579 --> 00:36:27.299
that you invite them to church.

00:36:27.299 --> 00:36:29.399
I haven't done that for a couple of years.

00:36:31.279 --> 00:36:33.339
You know why I stopped doing that?

00:36:33.339 --> 00:36:34.659
Because God convicted me.

00:36:34.659 --> 00:36:35.859
It's probably been like four or five years

00:36:35.859 --> 00:36:38.099
I've not started out by saying,

00:36:38.099 --> 00:36:39.979
I wanna invite you to church.

00:36:39.979 --> 00:36:41.559
Why?

00:36:41.559 --> 00:36:42.539
Because as soon as I say church,

00:36:42.539 --> 00:36:44.099
they have an idea in their head.

00:36:45.359 --> 00:36:46.479
They have a church that they've gone to,

00:36:47.319 --> 00:36:48.159
they got a church that they got hurt at,

00:36:48.159 --> 00:36:48.979
they got a church that they didn't like,

00:36:48.979 --> 00:36:50.039
they got a church, you fill in the blank.

00:36:50.039 --> 00:36:51.279
There's something.

00:36:51.279 --> 00:36:53.459
It's boring, it's dead, it's this, it's that,

00:36:53.459 --> 00:36:55.319
it's whatever, they just want my money.

00:36:55.319 --> 00:36:57.439
Whatever it is, they have an idea.

00:36:57.439 --> 00:36:58.279
They truly do.

00:36:59.119 --> 00:37:00.179
See what I do?

00:37:00.179 --> 00:37:02.439
Can I tell you how God changed my life?

00:37:02.439 --> 00:37:04.519
Can I tell you what he did for me 26 years ago?

00:37:04.519 --> 00:37:06.279
I mean, just changed my life.

00:37:07.239 --> 00:37:09.119
And there's some people that will listen.

00:37:10.199 --> 00:37:13.319
More people, I've had better opportunity

00:37:13.319 --> 00:37:15.719
to declare God's greatness when I take that approach

00:37:15.719 --> 00:37:17.919
than when I say, can I invite you to church?

00:37:19.399 --> 00:37:20.639
It's been transformative.

00:37:21.639 --> 00:37:23.759
And here we find this morning, listen,

00:37:23.759 --> 00:37:25.559
if we know that God is great,

00:37:25.559 --> 00:37:28.019
we need to be declaring God's greatness.

00:37:28.019 --> 00:37:32.799
We need to find somebody to tell how great our God is.

00:37:32.799 --> 00:37:33.959
And let me ask this question.

00:37:33.959 --> 00:37:35.039
I wonder this morning,

00:37:36.719 --> 00:37:40.119
as I look at the text and I see Moses

00:37:40.119 --> 00:37:44.099
standing and declaring and sharing all that God has done

00:37:44.099 --> 00:37:45.579
and he's exalting the Lord

00:37:45.579 --> 00:37:47.539
and he's declaring God's greatness

00:37:47.539 --> 00:37:50.539
and then the response of Jethro where he says,

00:37:50.539 --> 00:37:55.099
now I know that the Lord is greater than all gods.

00:37:55.099 --> 00:37:58.099
I wonder this morning if God could use me,

00:37:58.099 --> 00:38:02.819
if God could use you to help someone else realize

00:38:02.819 --> 00:38:04.739
how great God is.

00:38:04.739 --> 00:38:06.739
That'd be a wonderful thing, wouldn't it?

00:38:06.739 --> 00:38:09.779
I mean, somebody that God would allow our path to cross with

00:38:09.779 --> 00:38:12.059
that God would give us, as we often refer to it,

00:38:12.059 --> 00:38:13.579
as a divine appointment,

00:38:13.579 --> 00:38:16.179
where he'd allow us to have that interaction with someone

00:38:16.179 --> 00:38:18.139
and after we sit down and we talk to them

00:38:18.139 --> 00:38:19.739
and we reveal truth to them

00:38:19.739 --> 00:38:22.439
and we give them the truth of God's word,

00:38:22.439 --> 00:38:24.539
that they could stand and say something similar

00:38:24.539 --> 00:38:28.739
to what Jethro said, and I know that the Lord is great.

00:38:29.619 --> 00:38:30.539
That'd be awesome.

00:38:31.699 --> 00:38:34.579
A lot of people today that don't have any idea

00:38:34.579 --> 00:38:37.499
of how great your God is, how great my God is,

00:38:37.499 --> 00:38:39.919
they have no concept, they have no idea.

00:38:39.919 --> 00:38:41.379
You know why they don't know?

00:38:42.819 --> 00:38:45.599
They've listened to Hollywood as to who God is.

00:38:47.779 --> 00:38:50.459
They've listened to some political leader.

00:38:50.459 --> 00:38:52.679
They've listened to some religious leader.

00:38:56.019 --> 00:38:57.859
But you know who the best person is to tell somebody

00:38:57.859 --> 00:38:58.699
how great God is?

00:38:58.699 --> 00:39:00.399
Somebody that knows how great God is.

00:39:01.979 --> 00:39:04.299
Has anyone asked you before this question,

00:39:05.299 --> 00:39:07.299
hey, I'm gonna go to such and such restaurant,

00:39:07.299 --> 00:39:08.659
I wanna know, is it good?

00:39:09.659 --> 00:39:13.419
Now, if you've never been there before,

00:39:13.419 --> 00:39:16.579
do you have any business giving a review?

00:39:18.019 --> 00:39:18.859
Honestly.

00:39:19.899 --> 00:39:22.539
I mean, you could, oh man, it's a great place to go, Tim.

00:39:22.539 --> 00:39:24.699
I mean, I'm telling you, it's awesome, it's the best food.

00:39:24.699 --> 00:39:26.899
I'm telling you, when's the last time?

00:39:26.899 --> 00:39:28.599
Well, I've never been there before.

00:39:30.779 --> 00:39:35.779
You'd be like, why did you just tell me all of that?

00:39:38.859 --> 00:39:40.619
If we know how great God is,

00:39:42.159 --> 00:39:43.819
we're the ones that are qualified

00:39:45.739 --> 00:39:48.419
to tell somebody else how great God is.

00:39:49.899 --> 00:39:52.079
Those of us that have experienced.

00:39:53.219 --> 00:39:56.899
Why did Moses get to tell Jethro?

00:39:56.899 --> 00:39:58.979
Because Moses was qualified.

00:39:58.979 --> 00:40:01.339
He knew how great God was.

00:40:01.339 --> 00:40:02.179
He experienced.

00:40:02.179 --> 00:40:05.579
He experienced it personally.

00:40:05.579 --> 00:40:08.979
And therefore, he is qualified to deliver a message

00:40:08.979 --> 00:40:12.319
to Jethro that resulted in Jethro saying,

00:40:12.319 --> 00:40:20.159
I know now, I know that the Lord is greater than all gods.

00:40:20.159 --> 00:40:23.959
Man, I want God to use me that way.

00:40:23.959 --> 00:40:25.959
I pray that this morning we would pray,

00:40:25.959 --> 00:40:28.999
God, use us in that manner.

00:40:28.999 --> 00:40:31.939
God, lead me, direct me.

00:40:31.939 --> 00:40:36.499
Give me those divine appointments

00:40:36.499 --> 00:40:38.979
so that I could declare your greatness.

00:40:38.979 --> 00:40:41.279
Jethro, I mean, this is a powerful, powerful

00:40:41.279 --> 00:40:45.679
proclamation of Jethro.

00:40:45.679 --> 00:40:49.319
But it's the result of Moses saying,

00:40:49.319 --> 00:40:52.919
let me tell you all that God has done.

00:40:52.919 --> 00:40:56.399
This morning, we need to get into the habit.

00:40:56.399 --> 00:41:00.499
The word habit is sometimes used, eh.

00:41:00.499 --> 00:41:03.999
We need to get into the routine, the habit,

00:41:03.999 --> 00:41:06.359
of telling people how great our God is,

00:41:06.359 --> 00:41:08.939
because we serve a great God.

00:41:08.939 --> 00:41:10.899
And it's good for us to share it here,

00:41:10.899 --> 00:41:13.039
but we need to get out of these walls.

00:41:13.039 --> 00:41:15.779
Tell somebody how great our God is.

00:41:15.779 --> 00:41:16.539
Let's pray together.

00:41:16.539 --> 00:41:17.839
Father, we love you.

00:41:17.839 --> 00:41:18.919
We thank you for loving us.

00:41:18.919 --> 00:41:19.979
We thank you for your word,

00:41:19.979 --> 00:41:21.819
the truth that's contained therein.

00:41:21.819 --> 00:41:25.119
We thank you, God, that you have revealed to us,

00:41:25.119 --> 00:41:28.519
you've made known to us how great you are.

00:41:28.519 --> 00:41:32.419
God, I pray that if there's one here

00:41:32.419 --> 00:41:34.819
that's never trusted Christ as their personal savior,

00:41:34.819 --> 00:41:39.859
they do not have assurance,

00:41:39.859 --> 00:41:42.259
100% confidence and certainty

00:41:42.259 --> 00:41:43.299
that if they were to die today,

00:41:43.299 --> 00:41:45.019
that heaven is their home.

00:41:45.019 --> 00:41:48.599
God, I pray that today would be the day of their salvation.

00:41:48.599 --> 00:41:50.059
I pray that they would come forward

00:41:50.059 --> 00:41:51.239
during our time of invitation,

00:41:51.239 --> 00:41:52.599
that we have an opportunity to take a Bible

00:41:52.599 --> 00:41:53.739
and show them how they can know for sure

00:41:53.739 --> 00:41:56.099
that heaven is their home.

00:41:56.119 --> 00:41:58.959
God, I pray for every child of God.

00:41:58.959 --> 00:42:03.219
Lord, I don't want to just flounder in my Christian life.

00:42:03.219 --> 00:42:06.059
I don't want to just make it.

00:42:06.059 --> 00:42:08.839
God, I want to experience your greatness.

00:42:08.839 --> 00:42:11.739
I want to see you answer prayer.

00:42:11.739 --> 00:42:15.199
I want to see you work as only you can work.

00:42:15.199 --> 00:42:16.379
I think what the psalmist said is,

00:42:16.379 --> 00:42:19.779
time, Lord, for thee to work.

00:42:19.779 --> 00:42:22.679
God, I pray that we'd have that desire,

00:42:22.699 --> 00:42:27.199
that earnest expectation of seeing you work.

00:42:27.199 --> 00:42:30.039
God, would you give us opportunity

00:42:30.039 --> 00:42:32.299
to declare your greatness.

00:42:32.299 --> 00:42:35.879
We come in contact with so many people so often

00:42:35.879 --> 00:42:41.839
that simply do not know who you are.

00:42:41.839 --> 00:42:45.419
And God, we're qualified

00:42:45.419 --> 00:42:49.219
to tell others about how great you are.

00:42:49.239 --> 00:42:53.899
I pray that you'd use us for your honor and for your glory,

00:42:53.899 --> 00:42:56.539
that others might stand as Jethro did,

00:42:56.539 --> 00:42:59.839
and said, for now I know

00:42:59.839 --> 00:43:02.379
the Lord is greater than all gods.

00:43:02.379 --> 00:43:04.419
Use us, Lord, to that end.

00:43:04.419 --> 00:43:05.779
Well, thank you for the work that you'll do.

00:43:05.779 --> 00:43:06.939
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:43:06.939 --> 00:43:08.419
Would you stand with me?

00:43:08.419 --> 00:43:09.659
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

00:43:09.659 --> 00:43:12.079
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano.

00:43:12.079 --> 00:43:14.099
And as she does, the altar is open.

00:43:14.099 --> 00:43:16.779
Maybe the Lord spoke to your heart this morning.

00:43:16.779 --> 00:43:18.219
Would you respond to the Lord?

00:43:18.219 --> 00:43:19.059
If you're not sure of heaven,

00:43:19.059 --> 00:43:20.019
we'd love to take a Bible and show you

00:43:20.019 --> 00:43:23.099
how you can know for sure that heaven's your home.

00:43:23.099 --> 00:43:25.099
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
