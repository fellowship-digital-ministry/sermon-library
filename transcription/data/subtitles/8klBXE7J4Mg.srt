1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,880
I am not planning to preach through the book of Exodus after finishing Genesis.

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:06,679
If I were to do so, we'd start in chapter one.

3
00:00:06,679 --> 00:00:08,479
Someone asked me, are you preaching through Exodus?

4
00:00:08,479 --> 00:00:09,720
I say that we're in chapter three.

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,159
No, I'm not preaching through Exodus.

6
00:00:12,159 --> 00:00:15,720
In fact, I think over the summer we're going to implement once again, we'll have it on

7
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:20,799
Wednesday evening, but the Ask the Pastor series on Sunday nights, I got a couple from

8
00:00:20,799 --> 00:00:25,360
last summer that we did not finish and I'll begin with those and then we'll do that.

9
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,159
We'll start that after the missions conference and have that through the summer and then

10
00:00:29,159 --> 00:00:32,639
in September we'll start a brand new series on Sunday evening and look forward to the

11
00:00:32,639 --> 00:00:34,060
opportunity to do that.

12
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,720
This evening as we look at Exodus chapter number three, I want to draw your attention

13
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,279
to really the center part of the text.

14
00:00:40,279 --> 00:00:41,279
We're going to read verse seven.

15
00:00:41,279 --> 00:00:44,360
I'll get right into the message, but verse number seven, notice what the Bible says.

16
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:50,520
The Lord said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people, which are in Egypt and have

17
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,439
heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters.

18
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:57,279
And then notice this statement, for I know their sorrows.

19
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:03,360
I'm going to preach a message this evening that I've simply entitled, I know their sorrows.

20
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:07,559
After the death of Joseph, of course, recorded in Genesis chapter number 50, we understand

21
00:01:07,559 --> 00:01:13,360
the nation of Israel, the people of God, they face great afflictions and yet though suffering

22
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,360
great affliction, we understand they grew and they multiplied and we're told that the

23
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,440
Egyptians, if we're to study the first chapter, you're understanding that they made their

24
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:27,260
lives bitter with hard bondage, is the terminology that God uses to describe that period of time

25
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:32,139
of the children of Israel, after Joseph died, after the Pharaoh died, there rose up another

26
00:01:32,139 --> 00:01:37,220
Pharaoh which knew not Joseph and it was a difficult time for the children of Israel.

27
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:42,059
We find that the birth of Moses and really his first 80 years of life are recorded for

28
00:01:42,059 --> 00:01:47,540
us and it's amazing because you read chapter two and all, I mean, that's a lot of history

29
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,620
that's covered in one single chapter of scripture.

30
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:53,620
You come to the third chapter of the book of Exodus, we begin reading about the call

31
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:54,620
of Moses.

32
00:01:54,980 --> 00:02:01,660
Now, we must understand that a great number of years has passed between Joseph dying,

33
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:06,819
the period of time of bitter, hard bondage for the children of Israel, and now Moses

34
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:09,100
being called by God.

35
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:14,899
We find that most of Exodus 3 and Exodus chapter number 4 record for us and provide us with

36
00:02:14,899 --> 00:02:19,220
a dialogue, if you will, of the interaction between God and Moses.

37
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:24,020
As God calls Moses and Moses says, I think you got the wrong guy and you see the interaction

38
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:26,539
with the excuses and so on and so forth.

39
00:02:26,539 --> 00:02:30,899
But we find that as we look at this portion of scripture, and I really want to focus on

40
00:02:30,899 --> 00:02:36,300
verses 7 through 12 this evening, and I hope that it'll be a blessing to you and a help

41
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,820
to you because God says, I know their sorrows.

42
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,860
I'm thankful that our God is an eternal God.

43
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,940
I'm thankful that he's omniscient and that he's omnipotent.

44
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:45,940
He is immutable.

45
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:46,940
He never changes.

46
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,740
He's no respecter of persons.

47
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:53,779
And I'm thankful this evening that as we look at a text of scripture in Exodus 3, a period

48
00:02:54,539 --> 00:02:58,500
of history that literally took place thousands of years ago, that we have the opportunity

49
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:04,100
to see that we serve the same God today, and if you're facing challenges and difficulties

50
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:11,500
and you say, I have sorrows, I want you to know tonight that God knows your sorrows.

51
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,059
He knows.

52
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:14,380
He's aware.

53
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:18,020
As we look at this portion of scripture, I want you to quickly, if you're taking notes,

54
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,699
number one, notice the perspective of God.

55
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:21,699
We've read verse 7 already.

56
00:03:21,699 --> 00:03:23,259
I'm going to read it again.

57
00:03:23,259 --> 00:03:27,139
And we find that God speaks, of course, we understand the call is recorded in the first

58
00:03:27,139 --> 00:03:29,339
several verses of Exodus chapter 3.

59
00:03:29,339 --> 00:03:35,380
And he begins to, God begins to speak to Moses out of that burning bush, the bush that burned

60
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:38,020
with fire but was not consumed according to verse number 2.

61
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:42,940
In verse 7 it says, the Lord said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which

62
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:49,179
are in Egypt and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters, for I know their sorrows.

63
00:03:49,179 --> 00:03:54,059
Verse number 9 says this, now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel

64
00:03:54,059 --> 00:04:01,899
has come unto me, and I've also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them.

65
00:04:01,899 --> 00:04:07,660
When I consider the perspective of God from verse 7 and verse number 9, clearly revealed

66
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,779
to us are two truths this evening.

67
00:04:09,779 --> 00:04:13,779
Number one, God knows everything.

68
00:04:13,779 --> 00:04:15,660
God knows everything.

69
00:04:15,899 --> 00:04:19,260
Number two, God sees everything.

70
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,579
God knows everything and God sees everything.

71
00:04:22,579 --> 00:04:25,339
Have you ever heard somebody say something like this?

72
00:04:25,339 --> 00:04:28,700
Nobody knows and nobody cares.

73
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,579
Nobody knows what I'm dealing with.

74
00:04:30,579 --> 00:04:34,059
No one understands the sorrow of my heart.

75
00:04:34,059 --> 00:04:36,820
No one understands the burden that I'm carrying.

76
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,339
No one seems to care.

77
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:43,140
No one sees all the things that I'm dealing with.

78
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:50,179
I want you to know tonight that God knows everything and God sees everything.

79
00:04:50,179 --> 00:04:55,299
We serve a God who is amazing.

80
00:04:55,299 --> 00:05:03,700
I mean simply, we sang this morning about our Savior's love, I stand amazed in the presence

81
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,660
of Jesus the Nazarene.

82
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:11,640
I wonder how He could love me, a sinner condemned unclean.

83
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,760
And we sing the chorus, oh how marvelous, oh how wonderful, oh how marvelous is His

84
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,920
love for me.

85
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:21,959
Oh, you think about the love of God, it's amazing.

86
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:27,239
And as we look at this passage of Scripture, we understand that God knew all about their

87
00:05:27,239 --> 00:05:28,799
circumstances.

88
00:05:28,799 --> 00:05:33,179
He knew all about what they were facing and what they were dealing with and I want you

89
00:05:33,179 --> 00:05:37,799
to understand that it wasn't on day one of facing the difficulties and the adversities

90
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:42,559
that God comes and gives this call and this announcement.

91
00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:47,119
But all along the way, God knew what was taking place.

92
00:05:47,119 --> 00:05:48,239
He was aware.

93
00:05:48,239 --> 00:05:54,339
It's not as if all of a sudden after all of these years and all of the tragic circumstances

94
00:05:54,339 --> 00:06:00,480
that all of a sudden God has now made, no, God knew about it from the first day.

95
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:06,480
God has a plan, He has a purpose, He's always at work and there are times in which we wonder

96
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:13,239
and we've said something like this in the past with regard to God's timing, it's perfect.

97
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:17,600
There are times in my life, there are times in your life that we could say, I wish God

98
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,140
would hurry up and work, I wish He would, but God is at work.

99
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:24,239
God is doing something.

100
00:06:24,239 --> 00:06:29,799
There are times in which we can understand and many times on the other side of it, so

101
00:06:29,799 --> 00:06:36,000
to speak, that we can see that God was working to develop us as individuals through that

102
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:43,679
period of difficulty and trial and God was humbling us and God was at work and God was

103
00:06:43,679 --> 00:06:50,600
doing something in those circumstances that could not be done any other way.

104
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,000
And we ought to rejoice in that.

105
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,040
As much as God knew about their circumstances, I want you to know this evening that God knows

106
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,559
about your circumstances.

107
00:07:01,559 --> 00:07:07,000
It could be this evening that there are some that are dealing with things that no other

108
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,679
person on the face of this earth understands that they know.

109
00:07:12,679 --> 00:07:16,119
You've not shared it, you've not told anyone.

110
00:07:16,119 --> 00:07:23,200
Maybe there's a family that just a couple, a husband and wife are carrying a burden dealing

111
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:28,359
with a situation, a circumstance and nobody else knows about it, just the two of you,

112
00:07:28,359 --> 00:07:35,720
but I want you to know that God knows about it and God cares and God has a plan and God

113
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,679
is at work.

114
00:07:37,679 --> 00:07:42,339
We must understand this evening as we look at a passage of Scripture that for many of

115
00:07:42,339 --> 00:07:47,720
us is familiar, but we must be reminded of the perspective of God.

116
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,380
He knows everything.

117
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,320
He sees everything.

118
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:55,799
He cares deeply about His people.

119
00:07:55,799 --> 00:08:00,760
He loves us with an everlasting love, an unconditional love.

120
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,160
It's absolutely amazing.

121
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,399
We see the perspective of God.

122
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:07,200
I want you to see number two, the promise of God.

123
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,200
The promise of God.

124
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:14,279
I want you to notice in verse number eight, the Bible says this, and I am come down to

125
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:22,359
deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land unto

126
00:08:22,359 --> 00:08:29,679
a good land and a large unto a land flowing with milk and honey unto the place, the Canaanites,

127
00:08:29,679 --> 00:08:36,900
the place of the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites and the Jebusites.

128
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:40,799
We find that in verse number eight, God gives a promise to Moses.

129
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:45,719
He lets Moses understand that he was aware of what was taking place.

130
00:08:45,719 --> 00:08:49,080
He reveals to Moses that I know what's going on.

131
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,760
I see what's going on.

132
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,200
I am aware of the circumstances.

133
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,960
But then in verse number eight, he gives this promise and he says, I am come down to.

134
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,280
He's coming to do something.

135
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:05,960
And we find that really, as we look at verse number eight, it's a twofold promise.

136
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:12,880
He's going to bring them out in order to bring them in.

137
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,880
Notice he says in verse number eight, I am come down to deliver them out of the hand

138
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:23,239
of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land.

139
00:09:23,239 --> 00:09:24,619
He's coming to deliver them.

140
00:09:24,619 --> 00:09:29,239
We read through the book of Exodus and we understand that God will deliver them with

141
00:09:29,239 --> 00:09:31,260
a high hand, with a mighty hand.

142
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:36,719
We read through the portion of the next several chapters and we read of the plagues and we

143
00:09:36,719 --> 00:09:41,640
read of the great deliverance as they go and cross over the Red Sea.

144
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:46,400
And what a tremendous miracle of God and how God delivered them.

145
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,679
He brought them out.

146
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:51,280
He promised that that's what he was going to do.

147
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:56,960
But notice the promise is not simply to bring them out of that land and then to leave them

148
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,039
to themselves and figured out now I've delivered you from Egypt.

149
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:01,959
and now good luck, I mean, figure it out.

150
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:05,659
No, he says, and not only to bring them up

151
00:10:05,659 --> 00:10:08,519
out of that land into a good land,

152
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:10,939
in a large, in a land flowing with milk and honey,

153
00:10:10,939 --> 00:10:14,479
he brought them out so that he might bring them in.

154
00:10:15,499 --> 00:10:17,819
Now, we've understood as we study

155
00:10:17,819 --> 00:10:22,499
through the history of Israel that they disobey God,

156
00:10:22,499 --> 00:10:25,899
their unbelief causes them to wander in the wilderness

157
00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:28,599
for 40 years, and all that takes place.

158
00:10:28,599 --> 00:10:30,279
That was never God's plan.

159
00:10:31,719 --> 00:10:34,599
God knew about it because he knows all things,

160
00:10:34,599 --> 00:10:38,719
but God's plan was to bring them out and bring them in.

161
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:42,679
See, what limits God is your unbelief, my unbelief,

162
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:45,679
our doubt, it limits God.

163
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:47,439
In Psalm 78, the Bible talks about

164
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:51,159
they limited the Holy One of Israel.

165
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:53,159
He did not many mighty works there, why?

166
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:54,759
Because of their unbelief.

167
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:57,639
And so we find that they doubted,

168
00:10:57,639 --> 00:11:01,119
they said, if you were to read in Numbers chapter 14,

169
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:02,799
throughout that portion of scripture,

170
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:05,439
when God had Moses send those spies,

171
00:11:05,439 --> 00:11:08,039
they come back and 10 have the evil report,

172
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:12,079
and they say, we are not able, we cannot.

173
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,639
They have walled cities, they have strong cities,

174
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:17,639
they have giants, I mean, we're just not capable.

175
00:11:19,119 --> 00:11:19,959
And so what do they do?

176
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:22,059
Well, 40 years.

177
00:11:23,239 --> 00:11:25,559
But God made a promise,

178
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,679
and we find that even after that 40 years,

179
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:28,519
you know what God did?

180
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:30,279
He brought them in.

181
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:31,279
He brought them in.

182
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:35,079
Look over, if you will, quickly at Exodus chapter six,

183
00:11:35,079 --> 00:11:37,239
and then we're gonna look at Deuteronomy just for a moment.

184
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:39,139
In Exodus chapter number six,

185
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:43,459
the Lord's speaking to Moses.

186
00:11:45,179 --> 00:11:47,079
It's very interesting.

187
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:48,939
If you were to study the life of Moses,

188
00:11:48,939 --> 00:11:51,499
the end of chapter five is really amazing.

189
00:11:52,999 --> 00:11:54,899
Moses is pouring his heart out to the Lord,

190
00:11:55,259 --> 00:11:56,099
and he says in verse 23,

191
00:11:56,099 --> 00:11:58,139
for since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name,

192
00:11:58,139 --> 00:11:59,499
he hath done evil to this people,

193
00:11:59,499 --> 00:12:02,179
neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.

194
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:05,059
It really got worse before it got better.

195
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:07,419
You say, well, that's encouraging, Pastor.

196
00:12:07,419 --> 00:12:09,539
I'm just telling you what happened.

197
00:12:09,539 --> 00:12:10,859
In chapter number six, it says,

198
00:12:10,859 --> 00:12:13,059
then the Lord said unto Moses, notice what he says,

199
00:12:13,059 --> 00:12:17,699
now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh.

200
00:12:17,699 --> 00:12:19,179
God was about ready to work.

201
00:12:19,179 --> 00:12:20,379
We start reading about the plagues here

202
00:12:20,379 --> 00:12:21,379
in just a few moments,

203
00:12:21,379 --> 00:12:23,199
but I want you to notice in verse seven,

204
00:12:23,199 --> 00:12:24,599
what the Bible says,

205
00:12:24,599 --> 00:12:27,399
and I will take you to me for a people,

206
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:29,399
and I will be to you a God,

207
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:32,319
and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God,

208
00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:34,039
which bringeth you out

209
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:36,959
from under the burdens of the Egyptians,

210
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,659
and I will bring you in under the land

211
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:40,519
concerning the witch.

212
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:43,799
I did swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, to Jacob,

213
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:46,719
and I will give it you for an heritage.

214
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:50,139
I am the Lord.

215
00:12:50,139 --> 00:12:53,279
Deuteronomy, the Bible says this in chapter six.

216
00:12:55,219 --> 00:12:58,919
A great reminder as so much history has passed

217
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:02,799
between the portions of Scripture in Exodus three,

218
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:04,279
in Exodus chapter six,

219
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:06,859
and now in Deuteronomy chapter number six,

220
00:13:06,859 --> 00:13:10,379
we find that the new generation has risen up.

221
00:13:10,379 --> 00:13:12,939
The 40 years of wilderness wanderings are completed,

222
00:13:12,939 --> 00:13:17,919
and we find now that Moses is preparing these people

223
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:19,519
for entrance into the land,

224
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:24,399
reminding them of the ways of God and the plan of God,

225
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,879
and we find that Moses will say this

226
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:29,319
in verse 23 of Exodus six,

227
00:13:29,319 --> 00:13:33,759
and he brought us out from fence,

228
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:37,399
referring to Egypt, if you look at verse 22,

229
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,799
it says, and the Lord showed signs and wanders,

230
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:41,679
great and sore upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh,

231
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:44,319
and upon all his household before our eyes,

232
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:47,119
and he brought us out from fence

233
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:51,059
that he might bring us in to give us the land

234
00:13:51,059 --> 00:13:55,719
which he swear unto our fathers.

235
00:13:55,719 --> 00:13:57,639
The book of Joshua,

236
00:13:57,639 --> 00:13:59,499
we're not gonna look there this evening,

237
00:13:59,499 --> 00:14:03,379
but the book of Joshua records for us

238
00:14:03,379 --> 00:14:07,699
the entrance into the conquering of,

239
00:14:07,699 --> 00:14:11,379
the inhabiting of, the dividing of the land

240
00:14:11,379 --> 00:14:14,019
that God promised to Moses,

241
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:17,359
and now repeats here, excuse me, to Abraham,

242
00:14:17,359 --> 00:14:19,879
then to Moses, and so many others,

243
00:14:19,879 --> 00:14:22,079
Jacob, of course, had received the promise,

244
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,999
Joseph, and we see here with Moses

245
00:14:24,999 --> 00:14:26,959
in Exodus chapter number three.

246
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,519
So we see the perspective of God,

247
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:30,799
that God knows everything, that God sees everything,

248
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:31,959
we see the promise of God,

249
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:33,479
he says he's gonna bring them out,

250
00:14:33,479 --> 00:14:34,959
that he might bring them in.

251
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,259
Now I want you to leave a little space

252
00:14:36,259 --> 00:14:37,359
if you're keeping notes,

253
00:14:37,359 --> 00:14:39,819
because there's a third promise

254
00:14:39,819 --> 00:14:42,499
that I'm gonna circle back to at the end,

255
00:14:42,499 --> 00:14:45,079
and I hope that you'd leave just a little space

256
00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:47,159
in your notes here this evening.

257
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:48,559
I wanna give you the third thought

258
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:51,039
before I go back to that promise,

259
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:52,799
and so number three, if you're taking notes,

260
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:56,299
the plan of God, the plan of God.

261
00:14:56,299 --> 00:14:59,759
So God reveals to Moses his perspective,

262
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:02,839
what he knows, what he sees, what he understands,

263
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:05,859
he then reveals to Moses his promise,

264
00:15:05,859 --> 00:15:07,319
but then he gives him the plan,

265
00:15:07,319 --> 00:15:09,759
like now here's how I'm going to do

266
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:11,839
what I've promised to do.

267
00:15:11,859 --> 00:15:13,779
That's pretty neat that God does that,

268
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:16,419
it's pretty amazing that God makes the promise,

269
00:15:16,419 --> 00:15:18,899
but then reveals to Moses how he's going to do it.

270
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:20,459
Now, the interesting thing

271
00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:22,619
as we look at this portion of scripture

272
00:15:22,619 --> 00:15:24,179
is that in verse number eight,

273
00:15:24,179 --> 00:15:26,099
God in giving the promise, he says,

274
00:15:26,099 --> 00:15:28,739
I am come down to deliver them,

275
00:15:28,739 --> 00:15:30,379
who's then the children of Israel,

276
00:15:30,379 --> 00:15:32,379
out of the hand of the Egyptians.

277
00:15:32,379 --> 00:15:34,179
But we begin to think about the plan of God

278
00:15:34,179 --> 00:15:36,419
as it's revealed here in verse number 10,

279
00:15:36,419 --> 00:15:39,359
notice what God says to Moses.

280
00:15:40,359 --> 00:15:45,359
Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh.

281
00:15:48,819 --> 00:15:51,579
So in Exodus three in verse number 10,

282
00:15:51,579 --> 00:15:52,939
he says, come now therefore,

283
00:15:52,939 --> 00:15:56,299
and I will send thee unto Pharaoh,

284
00:15:56,299 --> 00:15:59,659
that thou mayest bring forth my people,

285
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:02,819
the children of Israel, out of Egypt.

286
00:16:04,539 --> 00:16:07,219
Now, when God reveals this plan,

287
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:10,959
there's something interesting that's revealed.

288
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:13,239
God said in verse number eight,

289
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:15,439
I am come down to deliver them.

290
00:16:16,359 --> 00:16:18,039
But then in verse number 10, he says,

291
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:22,479
come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh,

292
00:16:22,479 --> 00:16:24,559
that thou mayest bring forth my people,

293
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:25,959
the children of Israel, out of Egypt.

294
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:27,639
Now, we understand what takes place

295
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:28,959
in the next chapter and a half

296
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:33,799
with regard to the dialogue between Moses and God.

297
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:35,339
It begins in verse number 11,

298
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:37,559
when Moses says, who am I?

299
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:40,839
But I want you to understand that I believe initially

300
00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:42,199
that in verse number eight,

301
00:16:42,199 --> 00:16:44,999
when Moses is first hearing that God's going to do this,

302
00:16:44,999 --> 00:16:46,199
Moses is all on board.

303
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:47,679
This is great, God's gonna take care of this.

304
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:49,439
He's gonna come down, he's gonna bring the people out,

305
00:16:49,439 --> 00:16:51,239
he's gonna bring them in, it's wonderful.

306
00:16:51,239 --> 00:16:53,779
But then in verse number 10, God says to Moses,

307
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:55,759
now you come, I'm gonna send you.

308
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,419
Hold on a minute.

309
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:02,179
I thought you were gonna do this.

310
00:17:02,179 --> 00:17:04,779
Well, I am, but I'm gonna use you.

311
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:11,279
See, what God reveals to Moses in this portion of Scripture

312
00:17:11,999 --> 00:17:13,839
that's so important for us to understand

313
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,559
with regard to the plan of God

314
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:18,379
is that God's plan includes God's people.

315
00:17:19,479 --> 00:17:22,679
God's plan includes God's people.

316
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:26,779
God, the creator of all things,

317
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:29,639
the Lord God Almighty, the strong one,

318
00:17:29,639 --> 00:17:33,799
the self-existent one, the Almighty God,

319
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:37,839
he is going to use Moses.

320
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:41,059
Isn't that amazing?

321
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:42,779
You know what's even more amazing?

322
00:17:42,779 --> 00:17:44,059
Is that he'll use us.

323
00:17:45,959 --> 00:17:48,839
Not only that he will use us, but he wants to use us.

324
00:17:50,499 --> 00:17:51,519
It's amazing.

325
00:17:52,399 --> 00:17:55,679
It's almost beyond comprehension

326
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,239
for us to consider this evening

327
00:17:57,239 --> 00:18:00,779
that the God of the universe would use us.

328
00:18:01,779 --> 00:18:04,119
That he would use us.

329
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:05,899
See, God wants to use you tonight.

330
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:11,359
And I wonder this evening if we will surrender

331
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:15,999
and yield ourselves and allow God to use us.

332
00:18:15,999 --> 00:18:18,159
How does God wanna use you?

333
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:21,199
I'm not sure how to answer the question specifically,

334
00:18:21,199 --> 00:18:22,839
but I know generally speaking,

335
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:24,959
he wants to use you for his glory.

336
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:27,599
Amen?

337
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:30,859
He doesn't wanna use you so that you can be promoted.

338
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:33,699
He wants to use you so that he might be exalted.

339
00:18:35,019 --> 00:18:37,419
And we find in this text of scripture

340
00:18:37,419 --> 00:18:40,739
and in the portion of scripture that follows

341
00:18:40,739 --> 00:18:42,459
with the dialogue and the interaction

342
00:18:42,459 --> 00:18:45,000
between Moses and God,

343
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,139
we find that God is going to give Moses instruction.

344
00:18:49,139 --> 00:18:51,859
And every time Moses provides an objection,

345
00:18:51,859 --> 00:18:54,380
a reason that it shouldn't work or isn't going to work,

346
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:57,019
God gives him an answer and encourages him

347
00:18:57,019 --> 00:18:58,479
and helps him to understand.

348
00:18:58,479 --> 00:19:01,380
And so it's very interesting that in verse number 10,

349
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:04,979
that God reveals this plan of his,

350
00:19:04,979 --> 00:19:09,779
this plan of how I'm going to fulfill the promise.

351
00:19:09,779 --> 00:19:14,219
I am going to come down to deliver my people

352
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:15,579
out of the hand of the Egyptians

353
00:19:15,579 --> 00:19:16,619
according to verse number eight,

354
00:19:16,619 --> 00:19:18,639
and then to bring them into a land,

355
00:19:18,639 --> 00:19:21,119
a good land according to verse number eight.

356
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:22,759
But then he says in verse number 10,

357
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:26,139
I will send thee unto Pharaoh

358
00:19:26,139 --> 00:19:28,619
that thou mayest bring forth my people,

359
00:19:28,619 --> 00:19:32,539
the children of Israel, out of Egypt.

360
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:35,539
And Moses said unto God,

361
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:40,679
who am I that I should go unto Pharaoh

362
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:41,899
and that I should bring forth

363
00:19:41,899 --> 00:19:45,219
the children of Israel out of Egypt?

364
00:19:45,219 --> 00:19:48,059
We find that there's other excuses that are given,

365
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:50,619
and we've spent time in past messages

366
00:19:50,619 --> 00:19:55,459
over the years of reviewing the excuses of Moses

367
00:19:55,459 --> 00:19:58,339
and the interaction and what have you,

368
00:19:58,339 --> 00:20:00,179
but understand this evening that.

369
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:09,979
And many times, when God reveals His plan to His people, there's a moment of objection.

370
00:20:09,979 --> 00:20:18,379
No, God, you got the wrong…no, I'm not…I can't speak, I'm not eloquent, right?

371
00:20:18,379 --> 00:20:21,099
That's what He says at the end.

372
00:20:21,099 --> 00:20:24,019
He was trained in all the ways of Egypt.

373
00:20:24,019 --> 00:20:33,979
If you look at Acts, he was actually very mighty, and yet he offers this excuse before

374
00:20:33,979 --> 00:20:39,099
God, and God simply says, who made your mouth, your tongue?

375
00:20:39,099 --> 00:20:51,299
See, we can offer excuses to God as to why we're not the vessel, the individual that

376
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:53,739
God can use.

377
00:20:53,739 --> 00:20:58,259
But it's far better that we'd come to a place of just surrender and yieldedness and

378
00:20:58,259 --> 00:21:07,299
say, God, I want you to use me for your honor and for your glory, for the advancement of

379
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:12,459
your gospel, for souls to be saved, for lives to be changed.

380
00:21:12,459 --> 00:21:16,959
I've shared recently in a number of services, and especially on Wednesday evening, I know

381
00:21:16,959 --> 00:21:21,459
that some of you are in other classes and what have you on Wednesday evenings, but we

382
00:21:21,459 --> 00:21:28,099
have a real problem that's going on in our independent Baptist churches with regard to

383
00:21:28,099 --> 00:21:30,699
workers.

384
00:21:30,699 --> 00:21:36,299
I'm saying about pastors and missionaries.

385
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:39,899
Ronnie was asking me after church this morning, what's going to happen to our churches?

386
00:21:39,899 --> 00:21:41,659
And I said, Ronnie, we're in a problem.

387
00:21:41,659 --> 00:21:42,659
We got a problem.

388
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:44,139
There's a dearth in the land.

389
00:21:44,139 --> 00:21:46,259
There's a problem.

390
00:21:46,259 --> 00:21:49,979
Young people are not answering the call of God.

391
00:21:49,979 --> 00:21:52,139
They're just not.

392
00:21:52,139 --> 00:21:58,379
There's been this drastic shift with regard to, if you were to look back at, and I'll

393
00:21:58,379 --> 00:22:03,539
use the terminology of our movement, but if you look back at fundamentalism, if you will,

394
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:09,699
and you look at independent Baptist churches before my time in the 60s and 70s, I mean,

395
00:22:09,699 --> 00:22:13,619
there were preacher boys being called, I mean, they're just, just, I mean, Bible colleges

396
00:22:13,619 --> 00:22:16,899
were exploding and people were training for the ministry.

397
00:22:16,899 --> 00:22:21,179
And I think in a number of ways, some of them weren't really called by God.

398
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:22,459
They were called by their parents.

399
00:22:22,459 --> 00:22:28,899
It was kind of a, you know, a pushing them into the ministry kind of a situation.

400
00:22:28,899 --> 00:22:34,779
And then we've had this shift that's taken place in our churches where there's almost

401
00:22:34,779 --> 00:22:40,099
a discouragement to the next generation of answering the call of God.

402
00:22:40,099 --> 00:22:41,099
Why?

403
00:22:41,099 --> 00:22:42,959
Because you could do so much better for yourself.

404
00:22:42,959 --> 00:22:47,959
You could go and work in this career or that career and you could have this kind of salary

405
00:22:47,959 --> 00:22:52,519
and this kind of, and why would you, and there's almost this discouragement.

406
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:59,719
A number of years ago, there was a young man at camp and he felt as if God was calling

407
00:22:59,719 --> 00:23:02,839
him into the ministry.

408
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:08,519
He felt as if God was calling him into youth work.

409
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:13,799
And it was said over my dead body.

410
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:18,399
How tragic, how sad.

411
00:23:18,399 --> 00:23:25,399
But it happens and we're in a situation today where we have churches that have pastors that

412
00:23:25,399 --> 00:23:28,759
are literally aging out.

413
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:30,239
It's not that they don't want to do it anymore.

414
00:23:30,239 --> 00:23:34,359
It's not that they want to retire so they can go travel the world and just enjoy life.

415
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:39,679
It's that they just physically can't do the work of pastoring anymore.

416
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:48,359
Unless you've pastored, no one can fully understand the responsibility of pastoring.

417
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:51,759
Preaching is easy.

418
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:57,000
And I don't say that to say it in a way that it's not depending upon the Lord, but preaching

419
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,199
the public aspect of pastoring is the easiest part of pastoring.

420
00:24:02,199 --> 00:24:03,599
By far.

421
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:04,599
The easiest part.

422
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:09,119
I mean, it takes time, it takes study, but it's enjoyable, the Holy Spirit of God helps

423
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:10,119
you.

424
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:13,500
Like, it's just, it's the easy part of ministry.

425
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:17,759
When Paul says, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches, that's

426
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:20,479
a big situation.

427
00:24:20,479 --> 00:24:24,880
And so there are men that are just, I can't do it anymore.

428
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,000
But the problem is that there's no one in the ranks to follow.

429
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,119
But God's plan is that He uses people.

430
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:33,799
He uses people.

431
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:37,000
I said this on Wednesday evening and kind of belabored the point, the fact that the

432
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,639
Lord Jesus Christ, He said, listen, pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest that He'd

433
00:24:40,639 --> 00:24:41,639
send forth laborers.

434
00:24:41,639 --> 00:24:42,639
Why?

435
00:24:42,639 --> 00:24:45,679
Because the harvest is plenteous, but the laborers are few.

436
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:51,359
I talked to a president of a Bible college, he says, he says, Chris, we don't have anybody.

437
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:52,519
Nobody.

438
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:57,959
There is no name that I can give you of somebody that could go and possibly be a candidate

439
00:24:57,959 --> 00:24:59,320
in pastor church.

440
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,320
Zero.

441
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,320
None.

442
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:07,559
I talked to two evangelists that circle this country every single year.

443
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:08,559
Don't know anybody.

444
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:12,839
A third evangelist that's primarily on the East Coast, don't know anybody.

445
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:16,440
A director of a mission board, he said, I got one guy, he's in his mid-40s, here's his

446
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,440
resume.

447
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,239
That's sad.

448
00:25:19,239 --> 00:25:22,859
See, God still uses people today.

449
00:25:22,859 --> 00:25:27,039
The question is, are God's people willing to be used?

450
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:31,220
Are we coming to a place of saying, Lord, it's like what Isaiah said.

451
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:34,139
But why did Isaiah say what he said in Isaiah 6?

452
00:25:34,139 --> 00:25:37,339
It's because he saw God in his rightful place.

453
00:25:37,339 --> 00:25:40,619
He saw God high, holy, and lifted up.

454
00:25:40,619 --> 00:25:47,660
And when he saw God in his rightful place, he says, here am I, send me.

455
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:50,820
You know what's amazing about Isaiah 6, if you were to go back and study that portion

456
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:56,419
of scripture, Isaiah had no idea what he was volunteering to do.

457
00:25:56,419 --> 00:25:57,419
He just volunteered.

458
00:25:57,419 --> 00:25:58,419
Why?

459
00:25:58,419 --> 00:25:59,419
Because he saw God in his rightful place.

460
00:25:59,419 --> 00:26:06,699
He said, I'm willing to do whatever my God would want for me to do, whatever, wherever.

461
00:26:06,699 --> 00:26:09,779
And then when he gets the details at the end of chapter number 6, he's told, by the way,

462
00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:11,779
they're not going to listen to you.

463
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:14,139
Isn't that encouraging?

464
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:15,820
Ezekiel's told the same thing.

465
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:19,539
Hey, you're called to go to the house of Israel.

466
00:26:19,539 --> 00:26:23,959
If you were called to a different people of a hard language, they'd listen.

467
00:26:23,959 --> 00:26:27,459
But the children of Israel, they're not going to listen.

468
00:26:27,459 --> 00:26:28,899
Well, that's encouraging.

469
00:26:28,899 --> 00:26:30,940
But you know what's amazing?

470
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:38,259
Is that God measures, I'll use the word success, different than the world measures success.

471
00:26:38,259 --> 00:26:43,160
Because God's way of measuring success is the faithfulness of the individual.

472
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:47,539
Are you faithful to the task that I gave you to do?

473
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:54,940
So God uses people, and he says to Moses, come now therefore, and I will send thee unto

474
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:55,940
Pharaoh.

475
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:58,259
But God, I thought you were going to do it.

476
00:26:58,619 --> 00:26:59,820
Well, I am.

477
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:00,820
But I'm going to use you.

478
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:04,100
Isn't that amazing that God would use us?

479
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:08,779
I asked you to leave space because we're going to go back to that second point with regard

480
00:27:08,779 --> 00:27:12,179
to the promise of God.

481
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:19,079
I believe that this really third aspect of the promise of God in this text of Scripture

482
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:25,179
is a powerful, I'll call it a life-altering promise.

483
00:27:25,179 --> 00:27:35,579
And it's found in verse number 12, when God says these words, certainly I will be with

484
00:27:35,579 --> 00:27:37,739
thee.

485
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:39,660
Wow.

486
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,859
God says, I'm going to do this.

487
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:42,699
I'm going to bring my people out.

488
00:27:42,699 --> 00:27:43,940
I'm going to bring them in.

489
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:50,940
Moses, I'm going to send you to Pharaoh so that you can bring forth my people, the children

490
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,739
of Israel, out of Egypt.

491
00:27:52,739 --> 00:27:54,979
And Moses says, who am I?

492
00:27:55,779 --> 00:28:02,139
And God says this, certainly I will be with thee.

493
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:08,139
What a promise that God gives to Moses in Exodus 3 and verse number 12.

494
00:28:08,139 --> 00:28:10,660
A promise of his presence.

495
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:18,259
The reality that God was not simply sending Moses on a task to stand before and he was

496
00:28:18,259 --> 00:28:20,660
going in his own power and his own ability.

497
00:28:20,779 --> 00:28:25,139
No, God says, I will be with thee.

498
00:28:25,139 --> 00:28:32,260
You know what's amazing is that God's promise of his presence has been given to each of

499
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:36,260
us this evening as his people.

500
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:39,659
God says that he will never leave us nor forsake us.

501
00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:45,539
Within the context of the Great Commission, we find that Jesus Christ, our Savior, the

502
00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:49,979
Creator, he says, and lo, I am with you always.

503
00:28:49,979 --> 00:28:55,099
What a great promise that God gives.

504
00:28:55,099 --> 00:28:59,020
We ought never seek to do the work of God in our own power.

505
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:04,099
We must always be dependent upon God and we must recognize this wonderful promise.

506
00:29:04,099 --> 00:29:08,339
Notice he says, certainly I will be with thee and this shall be a token unto thee that I

507
00:29:08,339 --> 00:29:12,659
have sent thee when thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt.

508
00:29:12,659 --> 00:29:19,020
Notice what he says, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.

509
00:29:19,059 --> 00:29:27,380
You know, God gave him a promise of where they would serve God after their deliverance.

510
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:31,619
That you will serve God upon this mountain.

511
00:29:31,619 --> 00:29:39,460
And what a joy to understand the promise that God has given here with regard to his presence.

512
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:45,460
I wonder this evening, the, I almost said girls, but young ladies sang a wonderful song

513
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:52,500
about what God can do and how God wants to use us.

514
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:57,659
Considering the many things that were referenced that God has done in the past, but then how

515
00:29:57,659 --> 00:29:59,260
could God use us?

516
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:03,660
God's perspective is such that He knows.

517
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,040
He knows.

518
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,040
He understands.

519
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,040
He's aware.

520
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,040
He sees.

521
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,040
He knows everything.

522
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,720
He knows their sorrows.

523
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,240
He said, I know their sorrows.

524
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:19,160
He knows tonight what you're dealing with.

525
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,680
He's given promises.

526
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:26,080
In the text of our Scripture, He gave promises specifically with regard to the deliverance

527
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:31,740
and out of Egypt and into the land of promise, to bring them out and to bring them in.

528
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:38,060
But He gave this final promise as we conclude the service of His presence, that I will be

529
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:40,760
with thee.

530
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:45,100
And we understand God's plan tonight, that God uses people.

531
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,220
God uses people.

532
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:55,700
It's amazing how God's creation, aside from humankind, obey Him supremely.

533
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,780
God's creation obeys.

534
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:03,260
I believe that Jonah, oftentimes we speak of him as being the disobedient prophet.

535
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:07,300
I believe that Jonah was pretty thankful that the whale obeyed.

536
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:10,500
Amen?

537
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,500
Jonah was pretty…

538
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:17,380
I think Jonah was happy that the whale obeyed in a different manner than he did.

539
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,380
He went…

540
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,380
What did Jonah do?

541
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:21,860
Well, he went the opposite way.

542
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:26,980
What if the whale went further into the center of the ocean?

543
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:30,700
Jonah didn't get spit up onto dry land.

544
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:35,020
Jonah's happy that the whale obeyed.

545
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:40,500
God's people, let me say it this way, God wants to use His people.

546
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,060
He wants to use you tonight.

547
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,060
Are we usable?

548
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:50,500
Paul talks to Timothy about being a vessel that's fit for the Master's use.

549
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:55,260
I hope tonight that when you recognize the plan of God, God wants to do some great things.

550
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:58,140
God's capable of doing some great things.

551
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:01,340
But God uses people, He uses people.

552
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:08,020
And how surrendered and yielded are we to allowing God to work in and through us, not

553
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:13,140
for our advancement, but for His glory, for His glory?

554
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,140
Let's pray.

555
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,060
Father, we love You.

556
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,280
We thank You for loving us.

557
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:21,440
We thank You for the privilege of being able to be gathered here this evening.

558
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:26,720
We thank You for Your Word, the truth that's contained therein.

559
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,280
God, I thank You for the promise of Your presence.

560
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,280
Certainly I will be with Thee.

561
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,280
That's what You said to Moses.

562
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:38,920
And Lord, we still today understand that You've promised to go with us, to be with us.

563
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:46,220
And God, I pray that You would help us to submit to Your plan, that we'd be willing

564
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:54,140
to do whatever You have for us, that we'd go wherever You'd send, that we will be

565
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:57,620
faithful and obedient to Your plan.

566
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:01,620
I pray, God, that You would move and work in hearts and lives in these few moments as

567
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:02,620
only You can.

568
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:05,300
And we'll thank You for it in Christ's name we pray.
