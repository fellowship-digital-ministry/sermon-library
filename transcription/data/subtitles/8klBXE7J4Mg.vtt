00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.880
I am not planning to preach through the book of Exodus after finishing Genesis.

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.679
If I were to do so, we'd start in chapter one.

00:00:06.679 --> 00:00:08.479
Someone asked me, are you preaching through Exodus?

00:00:08.479 --> 00:00:09.720
I say that we're in chapter three.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.159
No, I'm not preaching through Exodus.

00:00:12.159 --> 00:00:15.720
In fact, I think over the summer we're going to implement once again, we'll have it on

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.799
Wednesday evening, but the Ask the Pastor series on Sunday nights, I got a couple from

00:00:20.799 --> 00:00:25.360
last summer that we did not finish and I'll begin with those and then we'll do that.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.159
We'll start that after the missions conference and have that through the summer and then

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:32.639
in September we'll start a brand new series on Sunday evening and look forward to the

00:00:32.639 --> 00:00:34.060
opportunity to do that.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.720
This evening as we look at Exodus chapter number three, I want to draw your attention

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.279
to really the center part of the text.

00:00:40.279 --> 00:00:41.279
We're going to read verse seven.

00:00:41.279 --> 00:00:44.360
I'll get right into the message, but verse number seven, notice what the Bible says.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.520
The Lord said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people, which are in Egypt and have

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.439
heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters.

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:57.279
And then notice this statement, for I know their sorrows.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:03.360
I'm going to preach a message this evening that I've simply entitled, I know their sorrows.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.559
After the death of Joseph, of course, recorded in Genesis chapter number 50, we understand

00:01:07.559 --> 00:01:13.360
the nation of Israel, the people of God, they face great afflictions and yet though suffering

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.360
great affliction, we understand they grew and they multiplied and we're told that the

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.440
Egyptians, if we're to study the first chapter, you're understanding that they made their

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:27.260
lives bitter with hard bondage, is the terminology that God uses to describe that period of time

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.139
of the children of Israel, after Joseph died, after the Pharaoh died, there rose up another

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:37.220
Pharaoh which knew not Joseph and it was a difficult time for the children of Israel.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.059
We find that the birth of Moses and really his first 80 years of life are recorded for

00:01:42.059 --> 00:01:47.540
us and it's amazing because you read chapter two and all, I mean, that's a lot of history

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.620
that's covered in one single chapter of scripture.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.620
You come to the third chapter of the book of Exodus, we begin reading about the call

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:54.620
of Moses.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:01.660
Now, we must understand that a great number of years has passed between Joseph dying,

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.819
the period of time of bitter, hard bondage for the children of Israel, and now Moses

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:09.100
being called by God.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:14.899
We find that most of Exodus 3 and Exodus chapter number 4 record for us and provide us with

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:19.220
a dialogue, if you will, of the interaction between God and Moses.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.020
As God calls Moses and Moses says, I think you got the wrong guy and you see the interaction

00:02:24.419 --> 00:02:26.539
with the excuses and so on and so forth.

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:30.899
But we find that as we look at this portion of scripture, and I really want to focus on

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:36.300
verses 7 through 12 this evening, and I hope that it'll be a blessing to you and a help

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.820
to you because God says, I know their sorrows.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.860
I'm thankful that our God is an eternal God.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.940
I'm thankful that he's omniscient and that he's omnipotent.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:45.940
He is immutable.

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:46.940
He never changes.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.740
He's no respecter of persons.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.779
And I'm thankful this evening that as we look at a text of scripture in Exodus 3, a period

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:58.500
of history that literally took place thousands of years ago, that we have the opportunity

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:04.100
to see that we serve the same God today, and if you're facing challenges and difficulties

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:11.500
and you say, I have sorrows, I want you to know tonight that God knows your sorrows.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.059
He knows.

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:14.380
He's aware.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.020
As we look at this portion of scripture, I want you to quickly, if you're taking notes,

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.699
number one, notice the perspective of God.

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:21.699
We've read verse 7 already.

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:23.259
I'm going to read it again.

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:27.139
And we find that God speaks, of course, we understand the call is recorded in the first

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:29.339
several verses of Exodus chapter 3.

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:35.380
And he begins to, God begins to speak to Moses out of that burning bush, the bush that burned

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.020
with fire but was not consumed according to verse number 2.

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.940
In verse 7 it says, the Lord said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:49.179
are in Egypt and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters, for I know their sorrows.

00:03:49.179 --> 00:03:54.059
Verse number 9 says this, now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel

00:03:54.059 --> 00:04:01.899
has come unto me, and I've also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them.

00:04:01.899 --> 00:04:07.660
When I consider the perspective of God from verse 7 and verse number 9, clearly revealed

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.779
to us are two truths this evening.

00:04:09.779 --> 00:04:13.779
Number one, God knows everything.

00:04:13.779 --> 00:04:15.660
God knows everything.

00:04:15.899 --> 00:04:19.260
Number two, God sees everything.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.579
God knows everything and God sees everything.

00:04:22.579 --> 00:04:25.339
Have you ever heard somebody say something like this?

00:04:25.339 --> 00:04:28.700
Nobody knows and nobody cares.

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.579
Nobody knows what I'm dealing with.

00:04:30.579 --> 00:04:34.059
No one understands the sorrow of my heart.

00:04:34.059 --> 00:04:36.820
No one understands the burden that I'm carrying.

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.339
No one seems to care.

00:04:38.339 --> 00:04:43.140
No one sees all the things that I'm dealing with.

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:50.179
I want you to know tonight that God knows everything and God sees everything.

00:04:50.179 --> 00:04:55.299
We serve a God who is amazing.

00:04:55.299 --> 00:05:03.700
I mean simply, we sang this morning about our Savior's love, I stand amazed in the presence

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.660
of Jesus the Nazarene.

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:11.640
I wonder how He could love me, a sinner condemned unclean.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.760
And we sing the chorus, oh how marvelous, oh how wonderful, oh how marvelous is His

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:16.920
love for me.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:21.959
Oh, you think about the love of God, it's amazing.

00:05:21.959 --> 00:05:27.239
And as we look at this passage of Scripture, we understand that God knew all about their

00:05:27.239 --> 00:05:28.799
circumstances.

00:05:28.799 --> 00:05:33.179
He knew all about what they were facing and what they were dealing with and I want you

00:05:33.179 --> 00:05:37.799
to understand that it wasn't on day one of facing the difficulties and the adversities

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:42.559
that God comes and gives this call and this announcement.

00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:47.119
But all along the way, God knew what was taking place.

00:05:47.119 --> 00:05:48.239
He was aware.

00:05:48.239 --> 00:05:54.339
It's not as if all of a sudden after all of these years and all of the tragic circumstances

00:05:54.339 --> 00:06:00.480
that all of a sudden God has now made, no, God knew about it from the first day.

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:06.480
God has a plan, He has a purpose, He's always at work and there are times in which we wonder

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:13.239
and we've said something like this in the past with regard to God's timing, it's perfect.

00:06:13.239 --> 00:06:17.600
There are times in my life, there are times in your life that we could say, I wish God

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:22.140
would hurry up and work, I wish He would, but God is at work.

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:24.239
God is doing something.

00:06:24.239 --> 00:06:29.799
There are times in which we can understand and many times on the other side of it, so

00:06:29.799 --> 00:06:36.000
to speak, that we can see that God was working to develop us as individuals through that

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:43.679
period of difficulty and trial and God was humbling us and God was at work and God was

00:06:43.679 --> 00:06:50.600
doing something in those circumstances that could not be done any other way.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.000
And we ought to rejoice in that.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.040
As much as God knew about their circumstances, I want you to know this evening that God knows

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:01.559
about your circumstances.

00:07:01.559 --> 00:07:07.000
It could be this evening that there are some that are dealing with things that no other

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.679
person on the face of this earth understands that they know.

00:07:12.679 --> 00:07:16.119
You've not shared it, you've not told anyone.

00:07:16.119 --> 00:07:23.200
Maybe there's a family that just a couple, a husband and wife are carrying a burden dealing

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:28.359
with a situation, a circumstance and nobody else knows about it, just the two of you,

00:07:28.359 --> 00:07:35.720
but I want you to know that God knows about it and God cares and God has a plan and God

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.679
is at work.

00:07:37.679 --> 00:07:42.339
We must understand this evening as we look at a passage of Scripture that for many of

00:07:42.339 --> 00:07:47.720
us is familiar, but we must be reminded of the perspective of God.

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.380
He knows everything.

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:51.320
He sees everything.

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:55.799
He cares deeply about His people.

00:07:55.799 --> 00:08:00.760
He loves us with an everlasting love, an unconditional love.

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:03.160
It's absolutely amazing.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.399
We see the perspective of God.

00:08:04.399 --> 00:08:07.200
I want you to see number two, the promise of God.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.200
The promise of God.

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:14.279
I want you to notice in verse number eight, the Bible says this, and I am come down to

00:08:14.279 --> 00:08:22.359
deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land unto

00:08:22.359 --> 00:08:29.679
a good land and a large unto a land flowing with milk and honey unto the place, the Canaanites,

00:08:29.679 --> 00:08:36.900
the place of the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites and the Jebusites.

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:40.799
We find that in verse number eight, God gives a promise to Moses.

00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:45.719
He lets Moses understand that he was aware of what was taking place.

00:08:45.719 --> 00:08:49.080
He reveals to Moses that I know what's going on.

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.760
I see what's going on.

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:53.200
I am aware of the circumstances.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:58.960
But then in verse number eight, he gives this promise and he says, I am come down to.

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:01.280
He's coming to do something.

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:05.960
And we find that really, as we look at verse number eight, it's a twofold promise.

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:12.880
He's going to bring them out in order to bring them in.

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:17.880
Notice he says in verse number eight, I am come down to deliver them out of the hand

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:23.239
of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land.

00:09:23.239 --> 00:09:24.619
He's coming to deliver them.

00:09:24.619 --> 00:09:29.239
We read through the book of Exodus and we understand that God will deliver them with

00:09:29.239 --> 00:09:31.260
a high hand, with a mighty hand.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:36.719
We read through the portion of the next several chapters and we read of the plagues and we

00:09:36.719 --> 00:09:41.640
read of the great deliverance as they go and cross over the Red Sea.

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:46.400
And what a tremendous miracle of God and how God delivered them.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.679
He brought them out.

00:09:48.679 --> 00:09:51.280
He promised that that's what he was going to do.

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:56.960
But notice the promise is not simply to bring them out of that land and then to leave them

00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:00.039
to themselves and figured out now I've delivered you from Egypt.

00:10:00.039 --> 00:10:01.959
and now good luck, I mean, figure it out.

00:10:01.959 --> 00:10:05.659
No, he says, and not only to bring them up

00:10:05.659 --> 00:10:08.519
out of that land into a good land,

00:10:08.519 --> 00:10:10.939
in a large, in a land flowing with milk and honey,

00:10:10.939 --> 00:10:14.479
he brought them out so that he might bring them in.

00:10:15.499 --> 00:10:17.819
Now, we've understood as we study

00:10:17.819 --> 00:10:22.499
through the history of Israel that they disobey God,

00:10:22.499 --> 00:10:25.899
their unbelief causes them to wander in the wilderness

00:10:25.899 --> 00:10:28.599
for 40 years, and all that takes place.

00:10:28.599 --> 00:10:30.279
That was never God's plan.

00:10:31.719 --> 00:10:34.599
God knew about it because he knows all things,

00:10:34.599 --> 00:10:38.719
but God's plan was to bring them out and bring them in.

00:10:38.719 --> 00:10:42.679
See, what limits God is your unbelief, my unbelief,

00:10:42.679 --> 00:10:45.679
our doubt, it limits God.

00:10:45.679 --> 00:10:47.439
In Psalm 78, the Bible talks about

00:10:47.439 --> 00:10:51.159
they limited the Holy One of Israel.

00:10:51.159 --> 00:10:53.159
He did not many mighty works there, why?

00:10:53.159 --> 00:10:54.759
Because of their unbelief.

00:10:55.639 --> 00:10:57.639
And so we find that they doubted,

00:10:57.639 --> 00:11:01.119
they said, if you were to read in Numbers chapter 14,

00:11:01.119 --> 00:11:02.799
throughout that portion of scripture,

00:11:02.799 --> 00:11:05.439
when God had Moses send those spies,

00:11:05.439 --> 00:11:08.039
they come back and 10 have the evil report,

00:11:08.039 --> 00:11:12.079
and they say, we are not able, we cannot.

00:11:12.079 --> 00:11:14.639
They have walled cities, they have strong cities,

00:11:14.639 --> 00:11:17.639
they have giants, I mean, we're just not capable.

00:11:19.119 --> 00:11:19.959
And so what do they do?

00:11:19.959 --> 00:11:22.059
Well, 40 years.

00:11:23.239 --> 00:11:25.559
But God made a promise,

00:11:25.559 --> 00:11:27.679
and we find that even after that 40 years,

00:11:27.679 --> 00:11:28.519
you know what God did?

00:11:28.519 --> 00:11:30.279
He brought them in.

00:11:30.279 --> 00:11:31.279
He brought them in.

00:11:31.279 --> 00:11:35.079
Look over, if you will, quickly at Exodus chapter six,

00:11:35.079 --> 00:11:37.239
and then we're gonna look at Deuteronomy just for a moment.

00:11:37.239 --> 00:11:39.139
In Exodus chapter number six,

00:11:41.399 --> 00:11:43.459
the Lord's speaking to Moses.

00:11:45.179 --> 00:11:47.079
It's very interesting.

00:11:47.079 --> 00:11:48.939
If you were to study the life of Moses,

00:11:48.939 --> 00:11:51.499
the end of chapter five is really amazing.

00:11:52.999 --> 00:11:54.899
Moses is pouring his heart out to the Lord,

00:11:55.259 --> 00:11:56.099
and he says in verse 23,

00:11:56.099 --> 00:11:58.139
for since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name,

00:11:58.139 --> 00:11:59.499
he hath done evil to this people,

00:11:59.499 --> 00:12:02.179
neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.

00:12:02.179 --> 00:12:05.059
It really got worse before it got better.

00:12:05.059 --> 00:12:07.419
You say, well, that's encouraging, Pastor.

00:12:07.419 --> 00:12:09.539
I'm just telling you what happened.

00:12:09.539 --> 00:12:10.859
In chapter number six, it says,

00:12:10.859 --> 00:12:13.059
then the Lord said unto Moses, notice what he says,

00:12:13.059 --> 00:12:17.699
now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh.

00:12:17.699 --> 00:12:19.179
God was about ready to work.

00:12:19.179 --> 00:12:20.379
We start reading about the plagues here

00:12:20.379 --> 00:12:21.379
in just a few moments,

00:12:21.379 --> 00:12:23.199
but I want you to notice in verse seven,

00:12:23.199 --> 00:12:24.599
what the Bible says,

00:12:24.599 --> 00:12:27.399
and I will take you to me for a people,

00:12:27.399 --> 00:12:29.399
and I will be to you a God,

00:12:29.399 --> 00:12:32.319
and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God,

00:12:32.319 --> 00:12:34.039
which bringeth you out

00:12:34.039 --> 00:12:36.959
from under the burdens of the Egyptians,

00:12:36.959 --> 00:12:39.659
and I will bring you in under the land

00:12:39.659 --> 00:12:40.519
concerning the witch.

00:12:40.519 --> 00:12:43.799
I did swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, to Jacob,

00:12:43.799 --> 00:12:46.719
and I will give it you for an heritage.

00:12:46.719 --> 00:12:50.139
I am the Lord.

00:12:50.139 --> 00:12:53.279
Deuteronomy, the Bible says this in chapter six.

00:12:55.219 --> 00:12:58.919
A great reminder as so much history has passed

00:12:58.919 --> 00:13:02.799
between the portions of Scripture in Exodus three,

00:13:02.799 --> 00:13:04.279
in Exodus chapter six,

00:13:04.279 --> 00:13:06.859
and now in Deuteronomy chapter number six,

00:13:06.859 --> 00:13:10.379
we find that the new generation has risen up.

00:13:10.379 --> 00:13:12.939
The 40 years of wilderness wanderings are completed,

00:13:12.939 --> 00:13:17.919
and we find now that Moses is preparing these people

00:13:17.919 --> 00:13:19.519
for entrance into the land,

00:13:19.839 --> 00:13:24.399
reminding them of the ways of God and the plan of God,

00:13:24.399 --> 00:13:26.879
and we find that Moses will say this

00:13:26.879 --> 00:13:29.319
in verse 23 of Exodus six,

00:13:29.319 --> 00:13:33.759
and he brought us out from fence,

00:13:33.759 --> 00:13:37.399
referring to Egypt, if you look at verse 22,

00:13:37.399 --> 00:13:39.799
it says, and the Lord showed signs and wanders,

00:13:39.799 --> 00:13:41.679
great and sore upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh,

00:13:41.679 --> 00:13:44.319
and upon all his household before our eyes,

00:13:44.319 --> 00:13:47.119
and he brought us out from fence

00:13:47.119 --> 00:13:51.059
that he might bring us in to give us the land

00:13:51.059 --> 00:13:55.719
which he swear unto our fathers.

00:13:55.719 --> 00:13:57.639
The book of Joshua,

00:13:57.639 --> 00:13:59.499
we're not gonna look there this evening,

00:13:59.499 --> 00:14:03.379
but the book of Joshua records for us

00:14:03.379 --> 00:14:07.699
the entrance into the conquering of,

00:14:07.699 --> 00:14:11.379
the inhabiting of, the dividing of the land

00:14:11.379 --> 00:14:14.019
that God promised to Moses,

00:14:14.039 --> 00:14:17.359
and now repeats here, excuse me, to Abraham,

00:14:17.359 --> 00:14:19.879
then to Moses, and so many others,

00:14:19.879 --> 00:14:22.079
Jacob, of course, had received the promise,

00:14:22.079 --> 00:14:24.999
Joseph, and we see here with Moses

00:14:24.999 --> 00:14:26.959
in Exodus chapter number three.

00:14:26.959 --> 00:14:28.519
So we see the perspective of God,

00:14:28.519 --> 00:14:30.799
that God knows everything, that God sees everything,

00:14:30.799 --> 00:14:31.959
we see the promise of God,

00:14:31.959 --> 00:14:33.479
he says he's gonna bring them out,

00:14:33.479 --> 00:14:34.959
that he might bring them in.

00:14:34.959 --> 00:14:36.259
Now I want you to leave a little space

00:14:36.259 --> 00:14:37.359
if you're keeping notes,

00:14:37.359 --> 00:14:39.819
because there's a third promise

00:14:39.819 --> 00:14:42.499
that I'm gonna circle back to at the end,

00:14:42.499 --> 00:14:45.079
and I hope that you'd leave just a little space

00:14:45.079 --> 00:14:47.159
in your notes here this evening.

00:14:47.159 --> 00:14:48.559
I wanna give you the third thought

00:14:48.559 --> 00:14:51.039
before I go back to that promise,

00:14:51.039 --> 00:14:52.799
and so number three, if you're taking notes,

00:14:52.799 --> 00:14:56.299
the plan of God, the plan of God.

00:14:56.299 --> 00:14:59.759
So God reveals to Moses his perspective,

00:14:59.759 --> 00:15:02.839
what he knows, what he sees, what he understands,

00:15:02.839 --> 00:15:05.859
he then reveals to Moses his promise,

00:15:05.859 --> 00:15:07.319
but then he gives him the plan,

00:15:07.319 --> 00:15:09.759
like now here's how I'm going to do

00:15:09.759 --> 00:15:11.839
what I've promised to do.

00:15:11.859 --> 00:15:13.779
That's pretty neat that God does that,

00:15:13.779 --> 00:15:16.419
it's pretty amazing that God makes the promise,

00:15:16.419 --> 00:15:18.899
but then reveals to Moses how he's going to do it.

00:15:18.899 --> 00:15:20.459
Now, the interesting thing

00:15:20.459 --> 00:15:22.619
as we look at this portion of scripture

00:15:22.619 --> 00:15:24.179
is that in verse number eight,

00:15:24.179 --> 00:15:26.099
God in giving the promise, he says,

00:15:26.099 --> 00:15:28.739
I am come down to deliver them,

00:15:28.739 --> 00:15:30.379
who's then the children of Israel,

00:15:30.379 --> 00:15:32.379
out of the hand of the Egyptians.

00:15:32.379 --> 00:15:34.179
But we begin to think about the plan of God

00:15:34.179 --> 00:15:36.419
as it's revealed here in verse number 10,

00:15:36.419 --> 00:15:39.359
notice what God says to Moses.

00:15:40.359 --> 00:15:45.359
Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh.

00:15:48.819 --> 00:15:51.579
So in Exodus three in verse number 10,

00:15:51.579 --> 00:15:52.939
he says, come now therefore,

00:15:52.939 --> 00:15:56.299
and I will send thee unto Pharaoh,

00:15:56.299 --> 00:15:59.659
that thou mayest bring forth my people,

00:15:59.659 --> 00:16:02.819
the children of Israel, out of Egypt.

00:16:04.539 --> 00:16:07.219
Now, when God reveals this plan,

00:16:08.159 --> 00:16:10.959
there's something interesting that's revealed.

00:16:11.919 --> 00:16:13.239
God said in verse number eight,

00:16:13.239 --> 00:16:15.439
I am come down to deliver them.

00:16:16.359 --> 00:16:18.039
But then in verse number 10, he says,

00:16:18.039 --> 00:16:22.479
come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh,

00:16:22.479 --> 00:16:24.559
that thou mayest bring forth my people,

00:16:24.559 --> 00:16:25.959
the children of Israel, out of Egypt.

00:16:25.959 --> 00:16:27.639
Now, we understand what takes place

00:16:27.639 --> 00:16:28.959
in the next chapter and a half

00:16:28.959 --> 00:16:33.799
with regard to the dialogue between Moses and God.

00:16:33.799 --> 00:16:35.339
It begins in verse number 11,

00:16:35.339 --> 00:16:37.559
when Moses says, who am I?

00:16:37.559 --> 00:16:40.839
But I want you to understand that I believe initially

00:16:40.839 --> 00:16:42.199
that in verse number eight,

00:16:42.199 --> 00:16:44.999
when Moses is first hearing that God's going to do this,

00:16:44.999 --> 00:16:46.199
Moses is all on board.

00:16:46.199 --> 00:16:47.679
This is great, God's gonna take care of this.

00:16:47.679 --> 00:16:49.439
He's gonna come down, he's gonna bring the people out,

00:16:49.439 --> 00:16:51.239
he's gonna bring them in, it's wonderful.

00:16:51.239 --> 00:16:53.779
But then in verse number 10, God says to Moses,

00:16:53.779 --> 00:16:55.759
now you come, I'm gonna send you.

00:16:57.279 --> 00:16:58.419
Hold on a minute.

00:16:59.339 --> 00:17:02.179
I thought you were gonna do this.

00:17:02.179 --> 00:17:04.779
Well, I am, but I'm gonna use you.

00:17:06.279 --> 00:17:11.279
See, what God reveals to Moses in this portion of Scripture

00:17:11.999 --> 00:17:13.839
that's so important for us to understand

00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:15.559
with regard to the plan of God

00:17:15.559 --> 00:17:18.379
is that God's plan includes God's people.

00:17:19.479 --> 00:17:22.679
God's plan includes God's people.

00:17:22.679 --> 00:17:26.779
God, the creator of all things,

00:17:26.779 --> 00:17:29.639
the Lord God Almighty, the strong one,

00:17:29.639 --> 00:17:33.799
the self-existent one, the Almighty God,

00:17:33.819 --> 00:17:37.839
he is going to use Moses.

00:17:39.299 --> 00:17:41.059
Isn't that amazing?

00:17:41.059 --> 00:17:42.779
You know what's even more amazing?

00:17:42.779 --> 00:17:44.059
Is that he'll use us.

00:17:45.959 --> 00:17:48.839
Not only that he will use us, but he wants to use us.

00:17:50.499 --> 00:17:51.519
It's amazing.

00:17:52.399 --> 00:17:55.679
It's almost beyond comprehension

00:17:55.679 --> 00:17:57.239
for us to consider this evening

00:17:57.239 --> 00:18:00.779
that the God of the universe would use us.

00:18:01.779 --> 00:18:04.119
That he would use us.

00:18:04.119 --> 00:18:05.899
See, God wants to use you tonight.

00:18:07.359 --> 00:18:11.359
And I wonder this evening if we will surrender

00:18:11.359 --> 00:18:15.999
and yield ourselves and allow God to use us.

00:18:15.999 --> 00:18:18.159
How does God wanna use you?

00:18:18.159 --> 00:18:21.199
I'm not sure how to answer the question specifically,

00:18:21.199 --> 00:18:22.839
but I know generally speaking,

00:18:22.839 --> 00:18:24.959
he wants to use you for his glory.

00:18:26.439 --> 00:18:27.599
Amen?

00:18:27.599 --> 00:18:30.859
He doesn't wanna use you so that you can be promoted.

00:18:30.859 --> 00:18:33.699
He wants to use you so that he might be exalted.

00:18:35.019 --> 00:18:37.419
And we find in this text of scripture

00:18:37.419 --> 00:18:40.739
and in the portion of scripture that follows

00:18:40.739 --> 00:18:42.459
with the dialogue and the interaction

00:18:42.459 --> 00:18:45.000
between Moses and God,

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.139
we find that God is going to give Moses instruction.

00:18:49.139 --> 00:18:51.859
And every time Moses provides an objection,

00:18:51.859 --> 00:18:54.380
a reason that it shouldn't work or isn't going to work,

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:57.019
God gives him an answer and encourages him

00:18:57.019 --> 00:18:58.479
and helps him to understand.

00:18:58.479 --> 00:19:01.380
And so it's very interesting that in verse number 10,

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:04.979
that God reveals this plan of his,

00:19:04.979 --> 00:19:09.779
this plan of how I'm going to fulfill the promise.

00:19:09.779 --> 00:19:14.219
I am going to come down to deliver my people

00:19:14.219 --> 00:19:15.579
out of the hand of the Egyptians

00:19:15.579 --> 00:19:16.619
according to verse number eight,

00:19:16.619 --> 00:19:18.639
and then to bring them into a land,

00:19:18.639 --> 00:19:21.119
a good land according to verse number eight.

00:19:21.119 --> 00:19:22.759
But then he says in verse number 10,

00:19:22.759 --> 00:19:26.139
I will send thee unto Pharaoh

00:19:26.139 --> 00:19:28.619
that thou mayest bring forth my people,

00:19:28.619 --> 00:19:32.539
the children of Israel, out of Egypt.

00:19:33.739 --> 00:19:35.539
And Moses said unto God,

00:19:36.539 --> 00:19:40.679
who am I that I should go unto Pharaoh

00:19:40.679 --> 00:19:41.899
and that I should bring forth

00:19:41.899 --> 00:19:45.219
the children of Israel out of Egypt?

00:19:45.219 --> 00:19:48.059
We find that there's other excuses that are given,

00:19:48.059 --> 00:19:50.619
and we've spent time in past messages

00:19:50.619 --> 00:19:55.459
over the years of reviewing the excuses of Moses

00:19:55.459 --> 00:19:58.339
and the interaction and what have you,

00:19:58.339 --> 00:20:00.179
but understand this evening that.

00:20:00.179 --> 00:20:09.979
And many times, when God reveals His plan to His people, there's a moment of objection.

00:20:09.979 --> 00:20:18.379
No, God, you got the wrong…no, I'm not…I can't speak, I'm not eloquent, right?

00:20:18.379 --> 00:20:21.099
That's what He says at the end.

00:20:21.099 --> 00:20:24.019
He was trained in all the ways of Egypt.

00:20:24.019 --> 00:20:33.979
If you look at Acts, he was actually very mighty, and yet he offers this excuse before

00:20:33.979 --> 00:20:39.099
God, and God simply says, who made your mouth, your tongue?

00:20:39.099 --> 00:20:51.299
See, we can offer excuses to God as to why we're not the vessel, the individual that

00:20:51.299 --> 00:20:53.739
God can use.

00:20:53.739 --> 00:20:58.259
But it's far better that we'd come to a place of just surrender and yieldedness and

00:20:58.259 --> 00:21:07.299
say, God, I want you to use me for your honor and for your glory, for the advancement of

00:21:07.299 --> 00:21:12.459
your gospel, for souls to be saved, for lives to be changed.

00:21:12.459 --> 00:21:16.959
I've shared recently in a number of services, and especially on Wednesday evening, I know

00:21:16.959 --> 00:21:21.459
that some of you are in other classes and what have you on Wednesday evenings, but we

00:21:21.459 --> 00:21:28.099
have a real problem that's going on in our independent Baptist churches with regard to

00:21:28.099 --> 00:21:30.699
workers.

00:21:30.699 --> 00:21:36.299
I'm saying about pastors and missionaries.

00:21:36.299 --> 00:21:39.899
Ronnie was asking me after church this morning, what's going to happen to our churches?

00:21:39.899 --> 00:21:41.659
And I said, Ronnie, we're in a problem.

00:21:41.659 --> 00:21:42.659
We got a problem.

00:21:42.659 --> 00:21:44.139
There's a dearth in the land.

00:21:44.139 --> 00:21:46.259
There's a problem.

00:21:46.259 --> 00:21:49.979
Young people are not answering the call of God.

00:21:49.979 --> 00:21:52.139
They're just not.

00:21:52.139 --> 00:21:58.379
There's been this drastic shift with regard to, if you were to look back at, and I'll

00:21:58.379 --> 00:22:03.539
use the terminology of our movement, but if you look back at fundamentalism, if you will,

00:22:03.539 --> 00:22:09.699
and you look at independent Baptist churches before my time in the 60s and 70s, I mean,

00:22:09.699 --> 00:22:13.619
there were preacher boys being called, I mean, they're just, just, I mean, Bible colleges

00:22:13.619 --> 00:22:16.899
were exploding and people were training for the ministry.

00:22:16.899 --> 00:22:21.179
And I think in a number of ways, some of them weren't really called by God.

00:22:21.179 --> 00:22:22.459
They were called by their parents.

00:22:22.459 --> 00:22:28.899
It was kind of a, you know, a pushing them into the ministry kind of a situation.

00:22:28.899 --> 00:22:34.779
And then we've had this shift that's taken place in our churches where there's almost

00:22:34.779 --> 00:22:40.099
a discouragement to the next generation of answering the call of God.

00:22:40.099 --> 00:22:41.099
Why?

00:22:41.099 --> 00:22:42.959
Because you could do so much better for yourself.

00:22:42.959 --> 00:22:47.959
You could go and work in this career or that career and you could have this kind of salary

00:22:47.959 --> 00:22:52.519
and this kind of, and why would you, and there's almost this discouragement.

00:22:52.519 --> 00:22:59.719
A number of years ago, there was a young man at camp and he felt as if God was calling

00:22:59.719 --> 00:23:02.839
him into the ministry.

00:23:02.839 --> 00:23:08.519
He felt as if God was calling him into youth work.

00:23:08.519 --> 00:23:13.799
And it was said over my dead body.

00:23:13.799 --> 00:23:18.399
How tragic, how sad.

00:23:18.399 --> 00:23:25.399
But it happens and we're in a situation today where we have churches that have pastors that

00:23:25.399 --> 00:23:28.759
are literally aging out.

00:23:28.759 --> 00:23:30.239
It's not that they don't want to do it anymore.

00:23:30.239 --> 00:23:34.359
It's not that they want to retire so they can go travel the world and just enjoy life.

00:23:34.359 --> 00:23:39.679
It's that they just physically can't do the work of pastoring anymore.

00:23:39.679 --> 00:23:48.359
Unless you've pastored, no one can fully understand the responsibility of pastoring.

00:23:48.359 --> 00:23:51.759
Preaching is easy.

00:23:51.759 --> 00:23:57.000
And I don't say that to say it in a way that it's not depending upon the Lord, but preaching

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:02.199
the public aspect of pastoring is the easiest part of pastoring.

00:24:02.199 --> 00:24:03.599
By far.

00:24:03.599 --> 00:24:04.599
The easiest part.

00:24:04.599 --> 00:24:09.119
I mean, it takes time, it takes study, but it's enjoyable, the Holy Spirit of God helps

00:24:09.119 --> 00:24:10.119
you.

00:24:10.119 --> 00:24:13.500
Like, it's just, it's the easy part of ministry.

00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:17.759
When Paul says, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches, that's

00:24:17.759 --> 00:24:20.479
a big situation.

00:24:20.479 --> 00:24:24.880
And so there are men that are just, I can't do it anymore.

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:29.000
But the problem is that there's no one in the ranks to follow.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.119
But God's plan is that He uses people.

00:24:32.119 --> 00:24:33.799
He uses people.

00:24:33.799 --> 00:24:37.000
I said this on Wednesday evening and kind of belabored the point, the fact that the

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.639
Lord Jesus Christ, He said, listen, pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest that He'd

00:24:40.639 --> 00:24:41.639
send forth laborers.

00:24:41.639 --> 00:24:42.639
Why?

00:24:42.639 --> 00:24:45.679
Because the harvest is plenteous, but the laborers are few.

00:24:45.679 --> 00:24:51.359
I talked to a president of a Bible college, he says, he says, Chris, we don't have anybody.

00:24:51.359 --> 00:24:52.519
Nobody.

00:24:52.519 --> 00:24:57.959
There is no name that I can give you of somebody that could go and possibly be a candidate

00:24:57.959 --> 00:24:59.320
in pastor church.

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:00.320
Zero.

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:01.320
None.

00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:07.559
I talked to two evangelists that circle this country every single year.

00:25:07.559 --> 00:25:08.559
Don't know anybody.

00:25:08.559 --> 00:25:12.839
A third evangelist that's primarily on the East Coast, don't know anybody.

00:25:12.839 --> 00:25:16.440
A director of a mission board, he said, I got one guy, he's in his mid-40s, here's his

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:17.440
resume.

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:19.239
That's sad.

00:25:19.239 --> 00:25:22.859
See, God still uses people today.

00:25:22.859 --> 00:25:27.039
The question is, are God's people willing to be used?

00:25:27.039 --> 00:25:31.220
Are we coming to a place of saying, Lord, it's like what Isaiah said.

00:25:32.119 --> 00:25:34.139
But why did Isaiah say what he said in Isaiah 6?

00:25:34.139 --> 00:25:37.339
It's because he saw God in his rightful place.

00:25:37.339 --> 00:25:40.619
He saw God high, holy, and lifted up.

00:25:40.619 --> 00:25:47.660
And when he saw God in his rightful place, he says, here am I, send me.

00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:50.820
You know what's amazing about Isaiah 6, if you were to go back and study that portion

00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:56.419
of scripture, Isaiah had no idea what he was volunteering to do.

00:25:56.419 --> 00:25:57.419
He just volunteered.

00:25:57.419 --> 00:25:58.419
Why?

00:25:58.419 --> 00:25:59.419
Because he saw God in his rightful place.

00:25:59.419 --> 00:26:06.699
He said, I'm willing to do whatever my God would want for me to do, whatever, wherever.

00:26:06.699 --> 00:26:09.779
And then when he gets the details at the end of chapter number 6, he's told, by the way,

00:26:09.779 --> 00:26:11.779
they're not going to listen to you.

00:26:11.779 --> 00:26:14.139
Isn't that encouraging?

00:26:14.139 --> 00:26:15.820
Ezekiel's told the same thing.

00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:19.539
Hey, you're called to go to the house of Israel.

00:26:19.539 --> 00:26:23.959
If you were called to a different people of a hard language, they'd listen.

00:26:23.959 --> 00:26:27.459
But the children of Israel, they're not going to listen.

00:26:27.459 --> 00:26:28.899
Well, that's encouraging.

00:26:28.899 --> 00:26:30.940
But you know what's amazing?

00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:38.259
Is that God measures, I'll use the word success, different than the world measures success.

00:26:38.259 --> 00:26:43.160
Because God's way of measuring success is the faithfulness of the individual.

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:47.539
Are you faithful to the task that I gave you to do?

00:26:47.539 --> 00:26:54.940
So God uses people, and he says to Moses, come now therefore, and I will send thee unto

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:55.940
Pharaoh.

00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:58.259
But God, I thought you were going to do it.

00:26:58.619 --> 00:26:59.820
Well, I am.

00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:00.820
But I'm going to use you.

00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:04.100
Isn't that amazing that God would use us?

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:08.779
I asked you to leave space because we're going to go back to that second point with regard

00:27:08.779 --> 00:27:12.179
to the promise of God.

00:27:12.179 --> 00:27:19.079
I believe that this really third aspect of the promise of God in this text of Scripture

00:27:19.079 --> 00:27:25.179
is a powerful, I'll call it a life-altering promise.

00:27:25.179 --> 00:27:35.579
And it's found in verse number 12, when God says these words, certainly I will be with

00:27:35.579 --> 00:27:37.739
thee.

00:27:37.739 --> 00:27:39.660
Wow.

00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:40.859
God says, I'm going to do this.

00:27:40.859 --> 00:27:42.699
I'm going to bring my people out.

00:27:42.699 --> 00:27:43.940
I'm going to bring them in.

00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:50.940
Moses, I'm going to send you to Pharaoh so that you can bring forth my people, the children

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:52.739
of Israel, out of Egypt.

00:27:52.739 --> 00:27:54.979
And Moses says, who am I?

00:27:55.779 --> 00:28:02.139
And God says this, certainly I will be with thee.

00:28:02.139 --> 00:28:08.139
What a promise that God gives to Moses in Exodus 3 and verse number 12.

00:28:08.139 --> 00:28:10.660
A promise of his presence.

00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:18.259
The reality that God was not simply sending Moses on a task to stand before and he was

00:28:18.259 --> 00:28:20.660
going in his own power and his own ability.

00:28:20.779 --> 00:28:25.139
No, God says, I will be with thee.

00:28:25.139 --> 00:28:32.260
You know what's amazing is that God's promise of his presence has been given to each of

00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:36.260
us this evening as his people.

00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:39.659
God says that he will never leave us nor forsake us.

00:28:39.659 --> 00:28:45.539
Within the context of the Great Commission, we find that Jesus Christ, our Savior, the

00:28:45.539 --> 00:28:49.979
Creator, he says, and lo, I am with you always.

00:28:49.979 --> 00:28:55.099
What a great promise that God gives.

00:28:55.099 --> 00:28:59.020
We ought never seek to do the work of God in our own power.

00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:04.099
We must always be dependent upon God and we must recognize this wonderful promise.

00:29:04.099 --> 00:29:08.339
Notice he says, certainly I will be with thee and this shall be a token unto thee that I

00:29:08.339 --> 00:29:12.659
have sent thee when thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt.

00:29:12.659 --> 00:29:19.020
Notice what he says, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.

00:29:19.059 --> 00:29:27.380
You know, God gave him a promise of where they would serve God after their deliverance.

00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:31.619
That you will serve God upon this mountain.

00:29:31.619 --> 00:29:39.460
And what a joy to understand the promise that God has given here with regard to his presence.

00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:45.460
I wonder this evening, the, I almost said girls, but young ladies sang a wonderful song

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:52.500
about what God can do and how God wants to use us.

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:57.659
Considering the many things that were referenced that God has done in the past, but then how

00:29:57.659 --> 00:29:59.260
could God use us?

00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:03.660
God's perspective is such that He knows.

00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:05.040
He knows.

00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:06.040
He understands.

00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:07.040
He's aware.

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:08.040
He sees.

00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:09.040
He knows everything.

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:10.720
He knows their sorrows.

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:12.240
He said, I know their sorrows.

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:19.160
He knows tonight what you're dealing with.

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:21.680
He's given promises.

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:26.080
In the text of our Scripture, He gave promises specifically with regard to the deliverance

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:31.740
and out of Egypt and into the land of promise, to bring them out and to bring them in.

00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:38.060
But He gave this final promise as we conclude the service of His presence, that I will be

00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:40.760
with thee.

00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:45.100
And we understand God's plan tonight, that God uses people.

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:47.220
God uses people.

00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:55.700
It's amazing how God's creation, aside from humankind, obey Him supremely.

00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:57.780
God's creation obeys.

00:30:57.780 --> 00:31:03.260
I believe that Jonah, oftentimes we speak of him as being the disobedient prophet.

00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:07.300
I believe that Jonah was pretty thankful that the whale obeyed.

00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:10.500
Amen?

00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:11.500
Jonah was pretty…

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:17.380
I think Jonah was happy that the whale obeyed in a different manner than he did.

00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:18.380
He went…

00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:19.380
What did Jonah do?

00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:21.860
Well, he went the opposite way.

00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:26.980
What if the whale went further into the center of the ocean?

00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:30.700
Jonah didn't get spit up onto dry land.

00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:35.020
Jonah's happy that the whale obeyed.

00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:40.500
God's people, let me say it this way, God wants to use His people.

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:43.060
He wants to use you tonight.

00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:44.060
Are we usable?

00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:50.500
Paul talks to Timothy about being a vessel that's fit for the Master's use.

00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:55.260
I hope tonight that when you recognize the plan of God, God wants to do some great things.

00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:58.140
God's capable of doing some great things.

00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:01.340
But God uses people, He uses people.

00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:08.020
And how surrendered and yielded are we to allowing God to work in and through us, not

00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:13.140
for our advancement, but for His glory, for His glory?

00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:14.140
Let's pray.

00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:16.060
Father, we love You.

00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:17.280
We thank You for loving us.

00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:21.440
We thank You for the privilege of being able to be gathered here this evening.

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:26.720
We thank You for Your Word, the truth that's contained therein.

00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:30.280
God, I thank You for the promise of Your presence.

00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:31.280
Certainly I will be with Thee.

00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:33.280
That's what You said to Moses.

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:38.920
And Lord, we still today understand that You've promised to go with us, to be with us.

00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:46.220
And God, I pray that You would help us to submit to Your plan, that we'd be willing

00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:54.140
to do whatever You have for us, that we'd go wherever You'd send, that we will be

00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:57.620
faithful and obedient to Your plan.

00:32:57.620 --> 00:33:01.620
I pray, God, that You would move and work in hearts and lives in these few moments as

00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:02.620
only You can.

00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:05.300
And we'll thank You for it in Christ's name we pray.
