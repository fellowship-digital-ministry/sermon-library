WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.840
prepared for accessing the files where the songs are stored.

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.119
I see that the two songs,

00:00:06.119 --> 00:00:09.060
Bringing in the Sheaves and Send a Light.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.840
And 1 Corinthians chapter number nine,

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:12.680
if you have your Bibles,

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.399
turn there to that passage of scripture

00:00:14.399 --> 00:00:16.239
in 1 Corinthians chapter number nine.

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:19.239
We're looking from verses 16 down through 27.

00:00:19.239 --> 00:00:22.479
I'm mindful each time that I enter into this auditorium

00:00:22.479 --> 00:00:23.639
on our right-hand side,

00:00:23.639 --> 00:00:26.239
as you walk in on the right, there's Send a Light.

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:29.040
And there's a map of the world,

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.280
quite smaller than the map on the left-hand side,

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.919
but the lighthouses and the admonition,

00:00:33.919 --> 00:00:36.919
the reminder that is ours to send a light.

00:00:36.919 --> 00:00:38.520
And you look to the left,

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.299
and of course, our missions map that gives us, again,

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:44.959
the perspective of the responsibility that we have

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:49.439
to take the gospel to all the world and to send the light.

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:52.299
And those pictures of those missionaries

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:54.500
that are represented are folks that we,

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.360
as a church family, regularly support.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.479
And not only through our financial giving,

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:01.419
but through our prayers and praying for them

00:01:01.419 --> 00:01:04.419
as they go to seek to preach the gospel

00:01:04.419 --> 00:01:06.160
to various places around the globe.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.080
And what a blessing that when you push

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.900
that little red button, all of those lights light up

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.839
on that map of all of the places

00:01:14.839 --> 00:01:16.220
in which we have missionaries.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.959
In fact, Carter, my nephew, would you run over there

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:20.919
and push that red button for me real quick?

00:01:20.919 --> 00:01:23.279
And I know the folks on livestream can't see this.

00:01:23.279 --> 00:01:24.720
Come on, hurry, man.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.559
You see the red button?

00:01:25.559 --> 00:01:27.120
Yeah, push that, hold it in for me.

00:01:27.879 --> 00:01:28.720
Can you see all those lights?

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.540
I know it's bright in here,

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.480
so you might not be able to see them well.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.639
But each of those lights represents a family

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:38.260
that we have, with the help of God,

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.180
decided that we're gonna partner with them

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.480
and try to get the gospel around the globe.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.279
Now, you'll see on that map,

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:49.239
not only when we designed that, thank you, Carter,

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:53.279
Brother Doug and Brother Ed and Don Curry

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:55.419
had much to do with that.

00:01:55.419 --> 00:01:57.180
Jim had much to do with it,

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.540
continues to help with the maintaining of it.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.580
But when we did that map, we wanted to have a light

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.300
represent each place where a missionary was

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.740
so that we could see where we're sending the gospel.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.600
But it also gives us a visual of some places

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.020
where there are no lights

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.059
and some places in which we need to get the gospel to,

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:21.259
some areas in which it's dark still, if you will.

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:24.100
And we think about the responsibility of sending the light.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.860
I had the privilege this past week,

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.580
we had an inspection here at church.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.300
It was not anything to do with the parsonage,

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.240
it was for the church.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.800
And as we had that inspection, I was praying

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.860
and God answered prayer.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.500
You know that truth, Ephesians 3.20, I share it often,

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.820
that he's able to do exceeding abundantly

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.259
above all that we ask or think.

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:42.820
And so I asked for something simple

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.899
with regard to that inspection

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:47.899
and he answered exceeding abundantly above.

00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:50.559
And the fellow that was doing the inspection, he walks in,

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:51.619
he didn't get any further

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:54.020
than where Brother John is sitting this evening.

00:02:54.779 --> 00:02:56.339
And he turned around, he was walking in front of me,

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:57.179
he turns around and he said,

00:02:57.179 --> 00:02:58.979
pastor, I got one question for you.

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:59.860
You guys have in church?

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.399
I mean, are you having people in church?

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:03.339
And I said, yes, sir.

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:05.360
He said, man, I'm so glad to hear that.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.220
God's people need to be in God's house.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.160
And he starts going, I'm like,

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.300
this is gonna be a good inspection.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.059
Amen, I was rejoicing.

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:14.500
We got over to that missions map

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.220
and he must've looked at that thing, I don't know,

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.100
five, 10 minutes and just kinda talking about missionaries.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.559
It was encouraging.

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:24.080
Got to pray with this fellow before he left.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.160
And what a blessing it was, but what a reminder

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.899
as we think about our responsibility

00:03:28.899 --> 00:03:31.399
to take the gospel to a lost and dying world.

00:03:31.399 --> 00:03:33.800
And it is our responsibility here in Jerusalem

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.440
in our locale to carry the gospel.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.320
Here in 1 Corinthians 9,

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.800
the apostle Paul is really sharing his testimony

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.199
and sharing his burden, if you will,

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:45.300
for preaching the gospel.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.479
Of course, you understand that Paul was a man

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:49.320
that God used in a great way.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.600
I believe one of the reasons in which God used Paul

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.160
in such a great way is because Paul was surrendered to God.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.600
Paul was willing to do whatever it was

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.759
that God wanted him to do.

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:03.419
He understood the truth of absolute surrender.

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:07.279
He understood the truth of being crucified with Christ.

00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:08.399
We look at that verse this morning

00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:10.520
in Galatians 2 in verse number 20.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.279
We find that the apostle Paul was a man

00:04:12.279 --> 00:04:14.899
that was surrendered to the will of God in his life.

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:17.019
And God used him greatly.

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.940
I believe that God will use any one of his servants

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.500
as we surrender ourselves to him

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.500
and we ask him to use us for his honor and for his glory.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.320
The apostle Paul was not seeking any recognition

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.160
in of himself.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.059
He was not seeking to have some accolades laid toward him.

00:04:34.059 --> 00:04:36.359
He was seeking to preach Christ.

00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:38.739
The Bible tells us in Romans 1

00:04:38.739 --> 00:04:41.420
that he was ready to preach the gospel.

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.019
We find here in 1 Corinthians 9,

00:04:44.019 --> 00:04:45.820
the apostle Paul, I'm gonna read a verse

00:04:45.859 --> 00:04:47.019
and then we'll get into the text

00:04:47.019 --> 00:04:49.619
and give you the title here from verse number 23.

00:04:49.619 --> 00:04:51.459
Notice what the Bible says.

00:04:51.459 --> 00:04:52.299
Paul says,

00:04:52.299 --> 00:04:56.559
and this I do for the gospel's sake,

00:04:56.559 --> 00:05:01.220
that I might be partaker thereof with you.

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.179
If I were to give a title to the message this evening,

00:05:03.179 --> 00:05:07.220
I'd simply use this phrase from verse number 23,

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.019
for the gospel's sake.

00:05:09.019 --> 00:05:10.760
For the gospel's sake.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.059
When you look at the heart

00:05:12.059 --> 00:05:16.140
and you see into the life of the apostle Paul,

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.160
you see a man that, as I mentioned already,

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.140
he was surrendered to the Lord

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:20.739
and he was used greatly of the Lord.

00:05:20.739 --> 00:05:24.500
And he went everywhere as he went and he was preaching.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.059
The Bible tells us in Acts 17

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:28.299
that when he gets to Thessalonica,

00:05:28.299 --> 00:05:31.440
that he goes to a synagogue as his manner was.

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.579
And as he would get to these new cities,

00:05:33.579 --> 00:05:37.179
he determined that he was going to seek opportunity

00:05:37.179 --> 00:05:38.779
to preach Christ.

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:41.019
And he was going to seize those opportunities.

00:05:41.019 --> 00:05:42.779
We find that Paul,

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:44.660
he was just a man that was surrendered.

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:49.459
He had that desire to see the gospel go forth.

00:05:49.459 --> 00:05:51.320
And we find that this evening,

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.140
as we would look at our lives

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:57.739
and we would begin to evaluate really our priorities,

00:05:57.739 --> 00:05:58.579
if you will,

00:05:58.579 --> 00:06:01.700
with regard to this truth of giving the gospel,

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:04.019
I hope this evening that God would challenge

00:06:04.019 --> 00:06:05.140
each and every one of us

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:09.059
with regard to the subject matter that is before us.

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.820
The reality is that every human being

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.540
upon the face of the earth will one day die.

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.540
It's just a fact.

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:18.739
Everyone's going to die.

00:06:19.619 --> 00:06:22.059
And every human being upon the face of the earth

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:26.119
is either saved or lost.

00:06:26.119 --> 00:06:27.480
There's no in-between ground.

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.899
There's no almost.

00:06:29.899 --> 00:06:31.420
In fact, it was Agrippa that said,

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:34.899
almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.

00:06:34.899 --> 00:06:37.700
And Paul responded that I wish that you were not almost,

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.940
but you are altogether such as I am,

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:41.480
except for these bonds.

00:06:42.339 --> 00:06:45.140
We find that there's no in-between.

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:46.700
There's no almost being saved.

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.640
There's saved and there's lost.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.380
And just as there's two categories of people,

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:55.459
there's only two eternal destinations,

00:06:55.459 --> 00:06:57.779
heaven and the lake of fire.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.339
That's it.

00:07:00.339 --> 00:07:01.820
There's no in-between.

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:04.140
There's no, I almost made it

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:05.739
and I'm going to spend some time

00:07:05.859 --> 00:07:08.380
in order to have some things taken care of

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.779
so that I can, then it doesn't work that way.

00:07:11.779 --> 00:07:14.339
In fact, if you were to look into the gospel accounts

00:07:14.339 --> 00:07:16.500
and you read the account of the rich man and Lazarus

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:20.380
and you find the truth with regard to the permanence

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:23.320
of that eternal destination.

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.100
You read Revelation chapter number 20

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:27.779
and you read about the great white throne judgment.

00:07:27.779 --> 00:07:30.299
If it doesn't convict you, if it doesn't stir you up,

00:07:30.299 --> 00:07:31.820
I'm not sure what can.

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:35.119
When you read that death and hell were cast

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:39.279
into the lake of fire, this is the second death.

00:07:39.279 --> 00:07:40.940
Wow.

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:44.000
I'm thankful this evening to be saved.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:44.920
Amen.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:48.440
I'm thankful to know that heaven is my home

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:50.119
and to be assured of it.

00:07:50.119 --> 00:07:52.760
But we've been entrusted with a message.

00:07:53.839 --> 00:07:56.260
This message that we've been entrusted with,

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:57.440
we have a responsibility.

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.760
And as I look at the life of the apostle Paul,

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:02.040
and I'm going to share this video this evening.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.440
It's not from one of our missionaries.

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:06.559
In fact, it's a man that's with the Lord right now.

00:08:08.359 --> 00:08:11.519
But he as an individual made a decision

00:08:11.519 --> 00:08:13.600
that by God's grace and with God's help,

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:17.079
he was going to seek to distribute gospel tracts.

00:08:17.079 --> 00:08:18.040
That's what he did.

00:08:19.739 --> 00:08:24.399
And ask questions to those individuals

00:08:24.399 --> 00:08:26.920
that he would give those gospel tracts to.

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:29.640
When I watched this video,

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:34.640
I was encouraged by this man's faithfulness to the Lord.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.000
Then I was challenged,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.679
because the reality is that all of us can do something

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:45.000
to fulfill the great commission that God has given us.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.599
As we look at this passage

00:08:46.599 --> 00:08:49.159
and examine it just for a few moments this evening,

00:08:49.159 --> 00:08:51.080
I want you to note with me, first of all,

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:53.080
the priority of Paul.

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:56.479
In verses 16 through 18, we see that God gives us

00:08:56.479 --> 00:08:58.960
as Paul is sharing his testimony

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:00.880
with the believers in Corinth,

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:03.359
and we have insight into understanding

00:09:03.359 --> 00:09:04.940
the priority that Paul has,

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:06.960
his priority in preaching the gospel.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.919
He understood the call that God had placed upon his life.

00:09:09.919 --> 00:09:12.400
He understood that he had a responsibility,

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.919
and I believe this evening that he took the call of God

00:09:15.919 --> 00:09:18.859
and the responsibility that he had been given seriously.

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:22.140
And as the people of God this evening,

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:24.919
we too have been given a commission.

00:09:24.919 --> 00:09:27.520
We too have been given a responsibility,

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:31.239
and it's important, it's imperative for us

00:09:31.239 --> 00:09:34.380
as the people of God to take serious

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.479
the work that God has given us to do.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.559
The Bible says this in verse 16,

00:09:39.559 --> 00:09:44.000
for though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.119
For necessity is laid upon me, yea, woe is unto me

00:09:48.119 --> 00:09:50.119
if I preach not the gospel.

00:09:50.119 --> 00:09:53.000
For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.320
But if against my will a dispensation of the gospel

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.880
is committed unto me, what is my reward then?

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.239
Verily that when I preach the gospel, I may.

00:10:00.239 --> 00:10:03.239
to make the Gospel of Christ without charge,

00:10:03.239 --> 00:10:06.359
that I abuse not my power in the Gospel."

00:10:06.359 --> 00:10:09.199
I like what Paul says about preaching the Gospel.

00:10:09.199 --> 00:10:11.159
He says I have nothing to glory of.

00:10:11.159 --> 00:10:15.799
And listen, Paul's not trying to make converts of Paul.

00:10:15.799 --> 00:10:17.959
He's trying to point people to Jesus.

00:10:17.959 --> 00:10:20.359
And he's made this priority in his life,

00:10:20.359 --> 00:10:23.519
and he's made it his life's aim and goal,

00:10:23.519 --> 00:10:25.639
if you will, to preach the Gospel.

00:10:25.639 --> 00:10:27.919
We read about the heart of the Apostle Paul

00:10:27.919 --> 00:10:29.279
in the book of Romans,

00:10:29.279 --> 00:10:30.399
and you don't need to turn there,

00:10:30.399 --> 00:10:33.519
but in Romans 9 and then also in Romans 10,

00:10:33.519 --> 00:10:36.879
you find the heart of Paul for individuals to be saved.

00:10:36.879 --> 00:10:40.039
And you find that he says in chapter 10 in verse 1,

00:10:40.039 --> 00:10:43.119
Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel

00:10:43.119 --> 00:10:47.839
is that they might be saved.

00:10:47.839 --> 00:10:52.839
He understood the greatest need of mankind is salvation.

00:10:53.039 --> 00:10:56.159
And his greatest desire for his brethren,

00:10:56.159 --> 00:10:58.519
as you look at chapter 9 in the first three verses

00:10:58.559 --> 00:11:00.119
and chapter 10, the first verse,

00:11:00.119 --> 00:11:02.079
is that they would be saved.

00:11:03.279 --> 00:11:05.399
And this evening, as we begin to think about

00:11:05.399 --> 00:11:09.799
the need in our world, the need in our community,

00:11:09.799 --> 00:11:13.839
the need in your workplace, the need on your street,

00:11:13.839 --> 00:11:15.679
is for people to be saved.

00:11:15.679 --> 00:11:16.879
That's what the need is.

00:11:17.959 --> 00:11:19.999
And the reality is that we find

00:11:19.999 --> 00:11:22.359
that the Apostle Paul understood

00:11:22.359 --> 00:11:25.639
that which had been placed upon him as a call.

00:11:25.679 --> 00:11:29.839
He understood that God gave him this responsibility

00:11:29.839 --> 00:11:31.599
to preach the Gospel.

00:11:31.599 --> 00:11:34.839
But this evening, as the people of God,

00:11:34.839 --> 00:11:37.159
that great commission that's been given to us

00:11:37.159 --> 00:11:38.279
to go into all the world

00:11:38.279 --> 00:11:40.359
and preach the Gospel to every creature,

00:11:41.399 --> 00:11:43.559
there's really no wiggle room.

00:11:43.559 --> 00:11:46.039
There's no out, if you will.

00:11:46.039 --> 00:11:49.479
There's a responsibility that's been laid upon us.

00:11:49.479 --> 00:11:50.879
The reality this evening is that

00:11:50.879 --> 00:11:53.399
when we understand a responsibility,

00:11:53.399 --> 00:11:54.919
we're going to either fulfill it

00:11:54.919 --> 00:11:56.359
or we're going to neglect it.

00:11:57.799 --> 00:12:00.719
We cannot deny the fact that there's a responsibility

00:12:00.719 --> 00:12:02.399
that's been given to us.

00:12:02.399 --> 00:12:04.479
And often, as we think about the responsibility,

00:12:04.479 --> 00:12:08.279
I like to look at it from this vantage point, if you will,

00:12:08.279 --> 00:12:10.519
not only of understanding it as being a responsibility,

00:12:10.519 --> 00:12:13.119
but it's a privilege.

00:12:13.119 --> 00:12:15.639
It is an absolute privilege.

00:12:15.639 --> 00:12:18.279
It's not simply duty.

00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:20.319
I know a songwriter says, I don't remember which hymn it is,

00:12:20.319 --> 00:12:22.119
but duty demands it.

00:12:22.119 --> 00:12:23.799
And I understand the thought of that

00:12:23.799 --> 00:12:26.799
and I understand the responsibility and the duty aspect.

00:12:26.799 --> 00:12:29.039
But this evening, we must understand

00:12:29.039 --> 00:12:31.879
that it is an absolute privilege

00:12:31.879 --> 00:12:35.639
to share Christ with a lost and dying world.

00:12:35.639 --> 00:12:38.639
I understand not everyone's going to be interested.

00:12:38.639 --> 00:12:40.399
No doubt you've had more people

00:12:40.399 --> 00:12:41.959
as you've sought to share the Gospel

00:12:41.959 --> 00:12:45.599
that have rejected you, really rejected Christ,

00:12:45.599 --> 00:12:47.879
than perhaps have embraced

00:12:47.879 --> 00:12:51.879
and have been eager to hear more about what you have to say.

00:12:51.879 --> 00:12:55.639
But it does not change the delight

00:12:55.639 --> 00:12:58.439
that we have as the people of God.

00:12:58.439 --> 00:13:00.399
When you have the opportunity

00:13:00.399 --> 00:13:03.279
to share the truth of the Gospel

00:13:03.279 --> 00:13:06.679
and you see somebody bow their head and trust Christ,

00:13:06.679 --> 00:13:11.679
what an amazing opportunity that God has given us.

00:13:11.759 --> 00:13:16.759
When you experience that miracle,

00:13:17.719 --> 00:13:18.559
it's a miracle.

00:13:18.559 --> 00:13:20.719
Salvation's a miracle.

00:13:20.719 --> 00:13:24.079
And when you experience someone else,

00:13:24.079 --> 00:13:25.439
I mean, I understand the miracle

00:13:25.439 --> 00:13:27.079
that took place in my life, in your life,

00:13:27.079 --> 00:13:28.079
when we trust that Christ,

00:13:28.079 --> 00:13:32.079
but when we have the opportunity to see someone else

00:13:32.079 --> 00:13:34.479
trust Christ as their Savior,

00:13:34.479 --> 00:13:37.319
man, it just does something for us spiritually.

00:13:38.519 --> 00:13:41.039
And I hope you can understand that terminology.

00:13:41.039 --> 00:13:43.719
I don't know what other words really to use,

00:13:43.719 --> 00:13:45.879
but to just say it, it does something for us.

00:13:45.879 --> 00:13:47.239
It's just an encouragement.

00:13:47.239 --> 00:13:51.319
What a great delight to be able to share Christ.

00:13:51.319 --> 00:13:52.799
As we think about the priority,

00:13:52.799 --> 00:13:54.319
we also see that Paul continues

00:13:54.319 --> 00:13:56.799
and he really shares a philosophy, if you will.

00:13:56.799 --> 00:13:59.319
And as we begin to think about the philosophy

00:13:59.319 --> 00:14:02.559
that Paul is sharing here in verses 19 through 22,

00:14:02.559 --> 00:14:05.719
we understand that he's not seeking

00:14:05.719 --> 00:14:09.239
to promote an idea of compromise.

00:14:09.239 --> 00:14:12.159
I do not believe that Paul is suggesting

00:14:12.159 --> 00:14:13.599
that there would be any compromise.

00:14:13.599 --> 00:14:17.720
I think that what Paul is seeking to communicate

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.319
is that we need to understand

00:14:19.319 --> 00:14:21.160
who it is that we're ministering to.

00:14:22.199 --> 00:14:24.199
When we understand some things about the individual

00:14:24.199 --> 00:14:25.199
that we're ministering to,

00:14:25.199 --> 00:14:28.119
perhaps it helps us in our approach

00:14:28.119 --> 00:14:30.399
to ministry with that individual.

00:14:30.399 --> 00:14:33.039
See, the reality is that when I'm engaged in ministry,

00:14:33.039 --> 00:14:36.079
when we think specifically about this passage of Scripture

00:14:36.079 --> 00:14:37.720
and the thought of preaching the gospel,

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:39.160
sharing the truth of the gospel

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:40.839
with a lost and dying world,

00:14:40.839 --> 00:14:42.399
with someone that's unsaved,

00:14:42.399 --> 00:14:44.959
when I understand a little bit about who they are,

00:14:44.959 --> 00:14:46.839
their background, so on and so forth,

00:14:46.839 --> 00:14:51.759
it's going to help me in how I approach that individual.

00:14:51.759 --> 00:14:53.359
It's not that I'm compromising,

00:14:53.359 --> 00:14:54.799
it's not that I'm changing something,

00:14:54.799 --> 00:14:57.679
it's simply gonna help me, enable me

00:14:57.679 --> 00:15:01.440
to be more pointed and more geared in a certain direction.

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:04.880
When I think about ministry for those that are saved,

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:08.039
as we think about the other context of ministry

00:15:08.039 --> 00:15:10.000
as we're ministering to believers,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.319
you know that when we minister to believers,

00:15:13.119 --> 00:15:14.359
that when we have some information

00:15:14.359 --> 00:15:16.559
about the folks in which we're ministering to,

00:15:16.559 --> 00:15:19.679
and we understand who the people are

00:15:19.679 --> 00:15:20.599
that we're ministering to,

00:15:20.599 --> 00:15:24.000
that it can help us be more effective in ministry?

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.599
You know that it is possible

00:15:27.599 --> 00:15:29.959
that you could try to minister to somebody

00:15:29.959 --> 00:15:34.519
and you could hinder your ability to effectively minister

00:15:34.519 --> 00:15:35.959
because of your approach.

00:15:37.799 --> 00:15:39.720
Because of your approach.

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:41.479
You could try to minister to some saved people,

00:15:41.479 --> 00:15:44.399
you could have a class that you're trying to minister to

00:15:44.399 --> 00:15:46.039
and you know about some things

00:15:46.039 --> 00:15:48.239
about a certain group of people within that class

00:15:48.239 --> 00:15:51.799
and you begin to maybe criticize or downplay

00:15:51.799 --> 00:15:54.599
or overemphasize some other thing,

00:15:54.599 --> 00:15:59.119
you begin to distance yourself from them

00:15:59.119 --> 00:16:02.759
and the ability to be able to effectively minister to them.

00:16:03.759 --> 00:16:05.679
If you know that someone

00:16:05.679 --> 00:16:09.720
is of a particular religious background

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:14.639
and you just begin by attacking that particular religion,

00:16:14.639 --> 00:16:16.959
I mean, both barrels, everything you know,

00:16:16.959 --> 00:16:21.720
you just absolutely blast that particular religion.

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:23.919
I can almost guarantee you

00:16:23.919 --> 00:16:25.919
that that person is shutting you off.

00:16:28.839 --> 00:16:32.319
The reality is that we really don't have to blast

00:16:32.319 --> 00:16:34.839
and criticize, we just need to exalt Christ

00:16:35.759 --> 00:16:38.839
and just share with them how Christ is better.

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:40.679
Let me tell you what Christ has done for you.

00:16:40.679 --> 00:16:45.199
Let me tell you the work that He accomplished on Calvary for you.

00:16:46.639 --> 00:16:50.160
And the reality is that when we begin to take that approach

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:53.679
and begin to share with someone what Christ has done for me,

00:16:55.239 --> 00:16:59.039
oh, it gives us that opportunity, that open door, if you will.

00:16:59.039 --> 00:17:01.119
See, I know that not every person

00:17:01.119 --> 00:17:03.440
is going to be interested in hearing the truth,

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:06.839
but the reality is that I want to be careful in my approach

00:17:06.839 --> 00:17:11.239
to not, by my words and by my approach, to turn them off.

00:17:11.239 --> 00:17:12.759
Does that make sense?

00:17:12.759 --> 00:17:14.479
And so we see that Paul, I do not believe

00:17:14.479 --> 00:17:16.880
that he's suggesting any kind of compromise,

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.479
but I think he's stressing here

00:17:18.479 --> 00:17:20.199
and seeking to communicate here

00:17:20.199 --> 00:17:22.000
that for us to have an understanding

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.959
of who it is that we're ministering to,

00:17:23.959 --> 00:17:26.759
specifically with regard to giving the gospel,

00:17:26.759 --> 00:17:28.839
that will help us to be more effective.

00:17:28.839 --> 00:17:30.160
Notice in verse 19,

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:32.160
for though I be free from all men,

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:34.399
yet have I made myself servant unto all

00:17:34.399 --> 00:17:35.959
that I might gain the more.

00:17:35.959 --> 00:17:37.599
And unto the Jews I became as a Jew,

00:17:37.599 --> 00:17:38.799
that I might gain the Jews.

00:17:38.799 --> 00:17:40.559
To them that are under the law is under the law,

00:17:40.559 --> 00:17:42.679
that I might gain them that are under the law.

00:17:42.679 --> 00:17:44.880
To them that are without law is without law,

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:48.079
being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,

00:17:48.079 --> 00:17:50.239
that I might gain them that are without the law.

00:17:50.239 --> 00:17:53.119
To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak.

00:17:53.119 --> 00:17:54.679
I made all things to all men

00:17:54.679 --> 00:17:57.559
that I might by all means save some.

00:17:57.559 --> 00:18:00.639
If you're not careful, there are some that would say

00:18:00.639 --> 00:18:02.399
and suggest from this passage of Scripture

00:18:02.399 --> 00:18:04.440
this idea of compromise.

00:18:04.519 --> 00:18:05.880
See, Paul's not seeking,

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:09.199
if you understand the context in which the Bible was written,

00:18:09.199 --> 00:18:11.599
you understand the time and the history

00:18:11.599 --> 00:18:13.279
and all the things that are taking place

00:18:13.279 --> 00:18:15.119
and the different people groups.

00:18:15.119 --> 00:18:19.559
Listen, Paul is not interested in making Gentiles Jews.

00:18:19.559 --> 00:18:22.639
He's not interested in making Jews Gentiles.

00:18:22.639 --> 00:18:25.119
What he is interested in is he's interested

00:18:25.119 --> 00:18:29.039
in preaching Christ and seeing people converted.

00:18:29.039 --> 00:18:30.799
That's what he's interested in.

00:18:30.799 --> 00:18:33.239
And the reality, see, I've had some people say,

00:18:33.239 --> 00:18:37.559
oh, what is your denomination?

00:18:37.559 --> 00:18:39.599
And, you know, are you Protestant?

00:18:39.599 --> 00:18:41.719
And I try not to get into all the discussion

00:18:41.719 --> 00:18:43.520
because Baptists really aren't Protestant.

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:45.599
And if you study church history and so on and so forth,

00:18:45.599 --> 00:18:48.599
but people aren't gonna follow you on all that stuff.

00:18:48.599 --> 00:18:50.239
But the reality is I like to tell people,

00:18:50.239 --> 00:18:52.200
listen, it's not about a religion.

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:55.559
It's about a relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:18:55.559 --> 00:18:57.359
I'm a Baptist by conviction

00:18:57.359 --> 00:19:00.279
because I believe what the Baptist people stand for

00:19:00.279 --> 00:19:02.599
historically, and I believe the distinctives

00:19:02.599 --> 00:19:04.479
and I believe they're important.

00:19:04.479 --> 00:19:08.479
But the reality is that we're Bible believers.

00:19:08.479 --> 00:19:10.000
There are some Baptist churches

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.839
that ought to take the name Baptist out of it

00:19:11.839 --> 00:19:13.479
because they no longer believe the book

00:19:13.479 --> 00:19:15.479
that I'm preaching from this evening.

00:19:15.479 --> 00:19:16.799
But if we believe the book

00:19:16.799 --> 00:19:18.559
and if we believe the fundamentals

00:19:18.559 --> 00:19:20.159
and believe those distinctives,

00:19:20.159 --> 00:19:23.119
yes, we identify as being a Baptist.

00:19:23.119 --> 00:19:26.679
But the reality is that here in this text of scripture

00:19:26.679 --> 00:19:28.679
and in the context of what's going on,

00:19:28.679 --> 00:19:31.760
you understand that there were some Judaizers

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:33.719
that were going around and saying to the Gentiles

00:19:33.719 --> 00:19:37.440
that you have to be circumcised like Moses

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:38.320
in order to be saved.

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:39.559
If you're not, you cannot be saved.

00:19:39.559 --> 00:19:42.279
I mean, all kinds of false teaching going on

00:19:42.279 --> 00:19:45.399
throughout this particular era of church history.

00:19:45.399 --> 00:19:48.479
And you find that Paul will say to the believers in Galatia

00:19:48.479 --> 00:19:51.119
in Galatians 6 and verse 15, he says,

00:19:51.119 --> 00:19:54.200
for Christ Jesus, neither circumcision availeth anything

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:58.959
nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.

00:19:58.959 --> 00:20:04.279
what's he saying? Well, the only way to be a new creature is to be in Christ, 2

00:20:04.279 --> 00:20:10.799
Corinthians 5 verse 17. If any man be in Christ, he's a new creature. So he says,

00:20:10.799 --> 00:20:15.439
listen, in Christ neither circumcision or uncircumcision availeth anything, but a

00:20:15.439 --> 00:20:21.159
new creature. And here in 1 Corinthians 9, in verses 19 through 22, I believe

00:20:21.159 --> 00:20:25.599
that what Paul is seeking to communicate to these believers in Corinth is a

00:20:25.599 --> 00:20:30.919
philosophy of understanding and not missing the truth of seeing people

00:20:30.919 --> 00:20:36.479
converted, helping them to understand their greatest need, and that's Christ.

00:20:36.479 --> 00:20:41.359
I've often told people over the years, listen, I'm not asking you to join our

00:20:41.359 --> 00:20:50.359
church. I'm not. I'm not asking you to put money in our offering plate. I'm not. I

00:20:50.559 --> 00:20:59.159
want to share Christ with you, because one day you're gonna die. One day you're

00:20:59.159 --> 00:21:03.799
gonna die. And are you gonna spend eternity in heaven or in the lake of

00:21:03.799 --> 00:21:08.879
fire? And it's a privilege of ours to be able to share that truth. Listen, there

00:21:08.879 --> 00:21:12.239
are groups of people that are trying to get people to join their church. There

00:21:12.239 --> 00:21:14.679
are groups of people that are just trying to get them to sign up and be part of

00:21:14.679 --> 00:21:22.919
their... really, it's more like a club. But if someone never joins our church, if

00:21:22.919 --> 00:21:26.359
someone never gives any money in our offering plate, but we have the privilege

00:21:26.359 --> 00:21:31.239
of sharing Christ with them and they trust Christ as their Savior, and they're

00:21:31.239 --> 00:21:36.719
going to go to heaven as a result of that miraculous conversion, glory to God!

00:21:36.719 --> 00:21:43.639
What a joy and privilege that is ours. I'm not trying to make somebody a

00:21:43.799 --> 00:21:48.119
Baptist. After they get saved, I'm gonna try to disciple them and teach them why

00:21:48.119 --> 00:21:52.279
I'm a Baptist and give them the truth of God's Word and go through that process

00:21:52.279 --> 00:21:58.959
of discipleship and so on and so forth. But you understand the philosophy of

00:21:58.959 --> 00:22:04.439
understanding that there are saved people and there are lost people. There's two

00:22:04.439 --> 00:22:10.359
destinations and we need to seek to reach individuals with the gospel. We

00:22:10.359 --> 00:22:15.999
find that the Apostle Paul will continue here and he says in verse 23,

00:22:15.999 --> 00:22:20.879
and this I do for the gospel sake. What's he talking about? Everything that we just

00:22:20.879 --> 00:22:25.519
read in those verses, the way in which he was communicating his philosophy, he was

00:22:25.519 --> 00:22:30.679
doing these things for the gospel sake, that I might be able to share Christ,

00:22:30.679 --> 00:22:34.359
that I might be able to preach the gospel, that people would hear the

00:22:34.359 --> 00:22:42.559
truth of God's love, the gospel, the good news. In a nutshell, the death, burial, and

00:22:42.559 --> 00:22:47.119
glorious resurrection of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. What a joy to

00:22:47.119 --> 00:22:53.759
communicate that message. And we find this evening that as we continue, he says

00:22:53.759 --> 00:22:57.679
that I might be a partaker thereof with you. And we get to the last point, if I

00:22:57.679 --> 00:23:01.039
could give this final point this evening, not only do we see the priority in the

00:23:01.039 --> 00:23:05.559
philosophy, but we see the prize for Paul. It's interesting how he finishes

00:23:05.559 --> 00:23:09.799
this chapter of Scripture and how it would relate to these individuals that

00:23:09.799 --> 00:23:15.079
were there in Corinth and how they would understand very quickly what Paul was

00:23:15.079 --> 00:23:20.319
referring to. He would deal with these Ithmian games and as he would begin to

00:23:20.319 --> 00:23:23.679
use this illustration, it was an illustration that the readers could

00:23:23.679 --> 00:23:27.999
easily relate to and understand. And he says here in verse 24,

00:23:27.999 --> 00:23:33.439
"...know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize.

00:23:33.439 --> 00:23:41.519
So run, that ye may obtain. And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate

00:23:41.519 --> 00:23:47.399
in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown," notice this, "...but we,

00:23:47.399 --> 00:23:54.199
an incorruptible." It begins to talk about these games and these

00:23:54.239 --> 00:23:58.079
competitors that are in these games, and they have a goal. What's their goal? To

00:23:58.079 --> 00:24:04.599
win. These games really predate the Olympic Games, and we'd understand some

00:24:04.599 --> 00:24:09.159
things about the Olympic Games, no doubt. We've heard things and seen things over

00:24:09.159 --> 00:24:13.999
the years of our lives about the Olympics and the training that goes into

00:24:13.999 --> 00:24:20.039
the restrictive diets that these athletes adhere to and all of these

00:24:20.119 --> 00:24:27.119
things that they do. Why? Because they want to win. I understand that culture's

00:24:27.119 --> 00:24:29.759
changing a little bit today and they just want to give a trophy for, like,

00:24:29.759 --> 00:24:34.679
participation in some of our younger sports and what-have-you. I was raised to

00:24:34.679 --> 00:24:39.319
win if I was gonna play. You understand what I'm saying? I never played a game to

00:24:39.319 --> 00:24:47.479
just have fun. I just didn't. We played to win. Now, if I didn't win, you're gonna

00:24:47.479 --> 00:24:54.399
lose graciously the same way you gotta win graciously. It was easier to win

00:24:54.399 --> 00:24:59.639
graciously than to lose graciously. But sometimes you lose in life, right? I mean,

00:24:59.639 --> 00:25:10.039
it's just what happens. And by the way, it's good for your character. We find

00:25:10.039 --> 00:25:16.199
that Paul says they're running to obtain a prize. They're running to win.

00:25:16.239 --> 00:25:20.359
But there's only one that's gonna receive the prize and this prize that he

00:25:20.359 --> 00:25:27.999
speaks about is a corruptible crown. A wreath of pine, if you will. They didn't

00:25:27.999 --> 00:25:32.759
use gold medals like the Olympic Games used today. They would use this

00:25:32.759 --> 00:25:40.959
wreath of pine and it was corruptible. It was temporary. And he says this,

00:25:40.959 --> 00:25:50.639
but we, an incorruptible. I therefore so run, verse 26, not as uncertainly, so fight

00:25:50.639 --> 00:25:54.919
I, not as one that beat at the air. I keep under my body and bring it into

00:25:54.919 --> 00:25:59.519
subjection, lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should

00:25:59.519 --> 00:26:06.199
be a castaway. The idea of being rejected, useless, of no value. But we'd think as we

00:26:06.199 --> 00:26:12.159
would understand this prize of an incorruptible crown. In verse 25, the

00:26:12.159 --> 00:26:19.479
Bible says, but we, an incorruptible. And then Paul says this, in verse 26, I

00:26:19.479 --> 00:26:27.199
therefore so run, not as uncertainty, uncertainly, excuse me, so fight I, not as

00:26:27.199 --> 00:26:31.879
one that beat at the air. And so we find that Paul is saying, here's what I'm

00:26:31.999 --> 00:26:37.199
doing. I'm seeking to do these things for the gospel's sake. See, Paul understood

00:26:37.199 --> 00:26:40.199
some truth. I mean, some amazing things that happened in the life of the

00:26:40.199 --> 00:26:44.879
Apostle Paul. Of course, we know that his name was Saul before his

00:26:44.879 --> 00:26:49.519
conversion. And we think about his conversion as it's recorded in Acts 9,

00:26:49.519 --> 00:26:56.279
and all that that took place, and how God changed his life. We think about this

00:26:56.279 --> 00:27:01.799
truth of the gospel's sake, and what it means to preach the gospel, and to give

00:27:01.799 --> 00:27:06.399
the truth of the good news of Jesus Christ to a lost and dying world. And you

00:27:06.399 --> 00:27:10.679
know, when you see someone trust Christ as their Savior, not only does it give

00:27:10.679 --> 00:27:18.679
you just a reason to rejoice, but that's an eternal decision. There are some

00:27:18.679 --> 00:27:26.279
people that I've not seen in years, but I led the Christ a long time ago. I

00:27:26.279 --> 00:27:34.119
don't know where all those people are, but the reality is that one day, one day

00:27:34.119 --> 00:27:39.719
we'll see them in heaven, in glory. I remember a man in a church that I

00:27:39.719 --> 00:27:42.999
attended years ago. He would say something like this when you would

00:27:42.999 --> 00:27:49.879
depart, something to the effect of, see you here, there, or in the air. And speaking

00:27:49.879 --> 00:27:53.199
about the truth of, listen, there's gonna be a reunion one day. Oh,

00:27:53.199 --> 00:27:57.079
what a grand reunion. I understand we're gonna see our Savior face-to-face. What a

00:27:57.079 --> 00:28:03.439
blessed truth. But think about the brethren. I think about, and I shared

00:28:03.439 --> 00:28:09.479
with someone just this past week as we were sharing testimonies, and I had the

00:28:09.479 --> 00:28:14.479
opportunity, and really it was a result of watching this video and talking

00:28:14.479 --> 00:28:20.479
about this video that I'm about to show you, and the way in which this man that

00:28:20.479 --> 00:28:26.719
for so many years so faithfully sought to give the gospel. But there's something

00:28:26.719 --> 00:28:32.439
unique, and you'll see it in the video, is that he really didn't know the full

00:28:32.439 --> 00:28:37.799
impact that he was having. And the reality is that there are times in which

00:28:37.799 --> 00:28:45.719
we don't know the full impact of our witness. Some water, or some plant, some

00:28:45.719 --> 00:28:52.879
water, but God giveth the increase. And I was mindful as I had this conversation

00:28:52.879 --> 00:28:57.839
after watching this video with this individual of the man that God used to

00:28:57.839 --> 00:29:02.199
share the gospel with my dad initially, and many of you heard that testimony a

00:29:02.239 --> 00:29:09.239
little over a year ago. And what a blessing to think about his faithfulness

00:29:09.239 --> 00:29:14.039
in sharing the truth of the gospel, and then when my dad was able to reconnect

00:29:14.039 --> 00:29:19.119
with him, to share with him some things that that had happened. He just didn't

00:29:19.119 --> 00:29:26.599
even know. He had no idea. And there's some people, as we give out some gospel tracks,

00:29:26.599 --> 00:29:34.359
as we share a witness, we just don't know. But we have to be

00:29:34.359 --> 00:29:42.759
faithful. We have to be diligent to give the gospel. Why? Because, number one, it's

00:29:42.759 --> 00:29:48.479
our job. It's our responsibility. But it is a privilege. It is a privilege to

00:29:48.479 --> 00:29:54.799
share the gospel. But number two, when we're mindful of the fact that out of

00:29:54.799 --> 00:30:00.719
all of the people upon the earth, seven plus billion people,

00:30:00.719 --> 00:30:09.399
There's only two categories of people, saved and lost, period, that's it.

00:30:09.399 --> 00:30:14.759
And there's two eternal destinations, heaven and the lake of fire.

00:30:14.759 --> 00:30:19.759
And I'll tell you, in our very first missions conference that we had, as I was the pastor

00:30:19.759 --> 00:30:27.079
here, the missionary that was here that week with us made this statement, I want to do

00:30:27.079 --> 00:30:34.239
to get the gospel to those that do not have it, what I would want for them to do for me

00:30:34.239 --> 00:30:36.599
if I did not have it.

00:30:36.599 --> 00:30:43.119
And that's a great thought, because if you were lost, you'd want somebody to come tell

00:30:43.119 --> 00:30:44.119
you about this.

00:30:44.119 --> 00:30:48.479
I mean, I know that you might not think that you want somebody to tell you about this,

00:30:48.479 --> 00:30:53.439
but on this side of being saved, you say, man, I'd want somebody to tell me.

00:30:53.439 --> 00:30:57.119
And in that account, in the gospels of that rich man and Lazarus, after that rich man

00:30:57.119 --> 00:31:00.639
died, what did he want?

00:31:00.639 --> 00:31:03.359
I want to send him back to tell my brothers.

00:31:03.359 --> 00:31:05.479
I don't want him to come to this place, right?

00:31:05.479 --> 00:31:08.319
I mean, that's what the Bible tells us.

00:31:08.319 --> 00:31:14.039
And so this evening, I hope that we would make a commitment to God that, you know what?

00:31:14.039 --> 00:31:17.799
By God's grace and with God's help, I'm going to be a witness.

00:31:17.799 --> 00:31:18.799
I don't know how many are in here.

00:31:18.799 --> 00:31:19.799
Dad, how many are in here tonight?

00:31:19.799 --> 00:31:20.799
Fifty-six in the building.

00:31:20.799 --> 00:31:21.799
Fifty-six in the building.

00:31:21.799 --> 00:31:22.799
He always has numbers, right?

00:31:22.799 --> 00:31:23.799
He's got to know exactly how many people are here.

00:31:23.799 --> 00:31:24.799
That's why I said dad.

00:31:24.799 --> 00:31:25.799
I knew he didn't know the answer.

00:31:25.799 --> 00:31:26.799
This man that we're going to watch this video on, he made a commitment to God to pass out

00:31:26.799 --> 00:31:27.799
10 tracts a week.

00:31:27.799 --> 00:31:28.799
Do you know if each person in here, I know there's children in that number, but let's

00:31:28.799 --> 00:31:29.799
just say 40 of us made that commitment to the Lord.

00:31:29.799 --> 00:31:30.799
With God's help and by God's grace, we gave out 10 tracts.

00:31:30.799 --> 00:31:31.799
He said a day.

00:31:31.799 --> 00:31:32.799
If we just said a week.

00:31:32.799 --> 00:31:33.799
If we just said a day.

00:31:33.799 --> 00:31:34.799
If we just said a day.

00:31:34.799 --> 00:31:35.799
If we just said a day.

00:31:35.799 --> 00:31:36.799
If we just said a day.

00:31:36.799 --> 00:31:37.799
If we just said a day.

00:31:37.799 --> 00:31:38.799
If we just said a day.

00:32:08.799 --> 00:32:15.579
That's a lot of people getting the truth to, getting the truth to, planting the seeds,

00:32:15.579 --> 00:32:16.579
letting God work.

00:32:16.579 --> 00:32:17.579
It's our job.

00:32:17.579 --> 00:32:22.199
It's our responsibility and it is a great privilege and I understand there are times

00:32:22.199 --> 00:32:26.279
in which we get discouraged with it because we think, man, they just don't want to hear.

00:32:26.279 --> 00:32:32.279
They just don't want to listen and the devil wants to discourage you when that happens

00:32:32.279 --> 00:32:36.079
so that you become more reluctant to give the truth.

00:32:36.079 --> 00:32:38.759
Jesus Joyce shared this story last year.

00:32:38.759 --> 00:32:42.999
She shared a gospel tract with someone and they tossed it in the garbage and she said,

00:32:42.999 --> 00:32:44.759
get that tract up.

00:32:44.759 --> 00:32:46.439
You need to go read that.

00:32:46.439 --> 00:32:51.119
I was, man, I guess you got to be above 90 to get away with something like that.

00:32:51.119 --> 00:32:52.119
Amen.

00:32:52.119 --> 00:32:56.919
And, but man, what courage and boldness.

00:32:56.919 --> 00:33:00.399
What would, what would cause her to make that statement?

00:33:00.399 --> 00:33:05.399
She knows what the content of that gospel tract is and she knows that it has the gospel

00:33:05.399 --> 00:33:08.759
and the power to change that individual's life.

00:33:08.759 --> 00:33:14.199
She can't make that individual get saved, but man, I want you to at least read it.

00:33:14.199 --> 00:33:16.519
And so I hope the people on live stream don't leave us.

00:33:16.519 --> 00:33:20.599
I want you to see this video as well and it's, it's about an eight and a half minute video

00:33:20.599 --> 00:33:24.959
and at the end of the video, we'll come and close our service in prayer, have an invitation.

00:33:24.959 --> 00:33:28.479
I'm going to dim this light, brother Jim, if you would show that video.
