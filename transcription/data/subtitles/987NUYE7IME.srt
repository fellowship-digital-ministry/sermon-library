1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
He is our refuge and strength,

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,340
a very present help in trouble.

3
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:10,460
In verses 2 and 3,

4
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:11,960
the idea really of the verses

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,680
is no matter what happens,

6
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:15,920
notice what the Bible says,

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,260
therefore, will not we fear.

8
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,340
Why? Because we understand who God is.

9
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,639
He's our refuge. He's our strength.

10
00:00:22,639 --> 00:00:24,760
He is a very present help in trouble.

11
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,760
Therefore, will not we fear,

12
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,180
though the earth be removed,

13
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:32,560
and though the mountains be carried

14
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,459
into the midst of the sea,

15
00:00:34,459 --> 00:00:36,959
though the waters thereof roar and be troubled,

16
00:00:36,959 --> 00:00:38,400
though the mountains shake

17
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,799
with the swelling thereof?

18
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:42,520
Selah.

19
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,259
That word selah means let it sink in.

20
00:00:45,259 --> 00:00:48,279
Meditate upon it. Think about that.

21
00:00:48,279 --> 00:00:49,720
You notice in verse 7,

22
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,599
the Bible says,

23
00:00:50,599 --> 00:00:53,279
the Lord of hosts, notice this,

24
00:00:53,279 --> 00:00:56,319
is with us.

25
00:00:56,319 --> 00:01:01,159
The God of Jacob is our refuge.

26
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:02,659
Selah.

27
00:01:02,659 --> 00:01:07,819
Verse 10, be still and know that I am God.

28
00:01:07,819 --> 00:01:10,160
I will be exalted among the heathen.

29
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,160
I will be exalted in the earth.

30
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:17,160
Verse 11, the Lord of hosts is with us.

31
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,919
The God of Jacob is our refuge.

32
00:01:21,919 --> 00:01:23,120
Selah.

33
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,000
Isn't that encouraging?

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,919
God is with us.

35
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:28,680
He says as we notice the truth in Hebrews,

36
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,839
I will never leave thee nor forsake thee.

37
00:01:31,839 --> 00:01:34,599
You understand even there in that passage of Scripture,

38
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:36,279
the implication of that truth is

39
00:01:36,279 --> 00:01:38,319
therefore, we shall not fear

40
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:39,760
what man shall do unto us.

41
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,120
Why? Because God is with us

42
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,559
and God is for us.

43
00:01:43,559 --> 00:01:44,919
We understand, listen,

44
00:01:44,919 --> 00:01:46,599
people ask the question all the time,

45
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:49,040
why do bad things happen to good people?

46
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,800
If God really is in control,

47
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,800
if He really is omnipotent and omniscient,

48
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,800
why is it that we go through troubles

49
00:01:54,839 --> 00:01:56,879
and trials and difficulties

50
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:58,680
so that He would be glorified?

51
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,400
You ever read John 9?

52
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,360
In John chapter 9, the disciples said,

53
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,599
who is it that sinned,

54
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:04,919
this man or his parents,

55
00:02:04,919 --> 00:02:07,000
that he was born blind?

56
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,919
And Jesus said, neither this man nor his parents,

57
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,759
but for the glory of God.

58
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:13,759
You read the entirety of John chapter 9

59
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,919
and you'll find out that there are people

60
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:17,039
that are gathered there

61
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:19,240
that are the religious leaders of the day

62
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,759
that see the miracle of Jesus

63
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:23,520
and they stand with astonishment

64
00:02:23,559 --> 00:02:26,479
and say we've never seen it like this before.

65
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,240
In fact, several chapters later

66
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,960
as the dialogue in John continues

67
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,639
following the life of Christ,

68
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:33,839
you find that at the tomb of Lazarus

69
00:02:33,839 --> 00:02:35,839
that some were still talking about

70
00:02:35,839 --> 00:02:37,960
the miracle of the man that was born blind

71
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,839
that was healed,

72
00:02:38,839 --> 00:02:42,039
for they said, the one that could heal the blind

73
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:44,600
couldn't he have healed Lazarus?

74
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,160
Sure he could have.

75
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,399
But he let Lazarus die

76
00:02:47,399 --> 00:02:50,080
so that he could bring him back from the grave.

77
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,639
Our God is in control.

78
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:55,399
He is our refuge.

79
00:02:55,399 --> 00:02:57,559
A very present help in trouble.

80
00:02:57,559 --> 00:02:59,479
How is it that God might be glorified

81
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:02,559
through a season of difficulty in my life or your life?

82
00:03:02,559 --> 00:03:04,199
Isn't it worth it?

83
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:06,479
I mean, honestly, for God to get the glory,

84
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:09,639
for someone to get the Gospel.

85
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:13,080
Ms. Joyce convicted me on Wednesday evening

86
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,960
during prayer time.

87
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,759
She had to go to the dermatologist

88
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:19,399
and she mentioned about the opportunity

89
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:22,080
to speak with her doctor about the Lord.

90
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,720
And then said this,

91
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,520
I am praying that I have more cancerous spots

92
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,199
so that I can go back

93
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:32,600
and share the Gospel with her again.

94
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,720
I said, can you repeat that?

95
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,279
I want to make sure I heard you right.

96
00:03:35,279 --> 00:03:36,720
If you were in the auditorium on Wednesday night,

97
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,960
you know that's how it happened.

98
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,880
I said, let me get this straight.

99
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,919
You're praying that you get cancer spots again

100
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:45,279
so that you can go back and share the Gospel.

101
00:03:45,279 --> 00:03:47,279
Yes.

102
00:03:47,279 --> 00:03:49,199
Praise the Lord.

103
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,119
And Paul said, the things that happened unto me

104
00:03:51,119 --> 00:03:53,119
in Philippians 1 have happened

105
00:03:53,119 --> 00:03:55,839
for the furtherance of the Gospel.

106
00:03:55,839 --> 00:03:56,839
That was all for you this morning.

107
00:03:56,839 --> 00:03:57,960
I hope it was a blessing to you.

108
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,320
First Chronicles chapter 22.

109
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,600
First Chronicles chapter 22.

110
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,639
If you have a bulletin with you,

111
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:04,399
you see that we're preaching from this passage.

112
00:04:04,399 --> 00:04:06,320
Not in the book of Colossians this morning.

113
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,639
And be looking at First Chronicles 22.

114
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:10,440
Really, I'll read the entire passage

115
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,479
and then really follow, trace if you will,

116
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:16,440
the circumstance that is there with Solomon

117
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,320
and then make some application for us this morning.

118
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:19,480
I do trust it will be a blessing

119
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,720
and encouragement to you.

120
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,920
In First Chronicles chapter 22,

121
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,119
we find here beginning in verse number one,

122
00:04:25,119 --> 00:04:25,959
notice the Bible says,

123
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:27,720
then David said,

124
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,000
this is the house of the Lord God

125
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,519
and this is the altar of the burnt offering for Israel.

126
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:35,799
And David commanded to gather together

127
00:04:35,799 --> 00:04:38,000
the strangers that were in the land of Israel

128
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,480
and he sent masons of hue rock stones

129
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,480
to build the house of God.

130
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,040
Verse three, and David prepared iron in abundance

131
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,959
for the nails for the doors of the gates

132
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,359
and for the joinings and brass in abundance without weight

133
00:04:50,359 --> 00:04:53,040
and cedar trees in abundance for the Zidaneans

134
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,559
and they of Tyre brought much cedar wood to David.

135
00:04:57,559 --> 00:04:59,279
And David said,

136
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:01,920
Solomon my son is young and tender.

137
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,920
The house that is to be built for the Lord

138
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,920
must be exceeding magnificent.

139
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,720
I like that terminology.

140
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,040
Of fame and of glory throughout all countries.

141
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,920
I will therefore now make preparation for it.

142
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:19,160
So David prepared abundantly before his death.

143
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,239
Then he called for Solomon his son

144
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:26,040
and charged him to build a house for the Lord God of Israel.

145
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,079
We'll get through the entirety of this passage

146
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:31,559
but I want to draw your attention to verse number 16.

147
00:05:31,559 --> 00:05:32,920
The Bible says of the gold,

148
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,399
the silver and the brass and the iron,

149
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:36,519
there's no number.

150
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,799
Arise therefore and be doing

151
00:05:41,679 --> 00:05:44,160
and the Lord be with thee.

152
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,640
This morning I've used that phrase

153
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,359
from verse number 16 as our title.

154
00:05:47,359 --> 00:05:50,720
Arise therefore and be doing.

155
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,799
Arise therefore and be doing.

156
00:05:53,799 --> 00:05:55,200
As we look at the text of Scripture

157
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,799
we would be reminded that just a few chapters earlier

158
00:05:57,799 --> 00:05:59,760
in 1 Chronicles 17,

159
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,720
God provides us with a record of David's desire

160
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,000
to build the temple.

161
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,559
If you're familiar with the passage of Scripture

162
00:06:05,559 --> 00:06:07,799
you understand that David had this desire

163
00:06:07,799 --> 00:06:09,600
to build the temple and the man of God,

164
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,920
the prophet of God at that time was Nathan

165
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:13,440
and Nathan says to David,

166
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,600
go and do all that is within thine heart.

167
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,320
And that very night,

168
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,519
God Almighty appeared to Nathan and said,

169
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:23,600
no, that's not my plan.

170
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,720
That's not my will.

171
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,640
It's not for David to build the temple.

172
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,119
We know that contained within the dialogue

173
00:06:31,119 --> 00:06:33,160
between Nathan and David,

174
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,239
as Nathan would convey the word of God to David

175
00:06:36,239 --> 00:06:40,079
is the Davidic covenant as we've come to know it.

176
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:41,640
But we find that there,

177
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,239
as we would think about the way

178
00:06:43,239 --> 00:06:46,160
in which God revealed His plan to David

179
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,160
and we look at the background really

180
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,839
to the text that we're looking at this morning

181
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:52,200
in 1 Chronicles 22,

182
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,880
I believe that even by way of introduction this morning

183
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,480
there are some valuable lessons for us

184
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,559
from the thought of 1 Chronicles 17.

185
00:06:59,559 --> 00:07:01,160
Number one, think about this.

186
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,160
Though you desire a good thing,

187
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,559
God's plan must take priority.

188
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,399
It was not a bad thing for David

189
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,079
to desire to build a temple.

190
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,079
It was a good thing.

191
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:16,559
It was a commendable desire.

192
00:07:16,559 --> 00:07:18,239
But God said, that's not my plan.

193
00:07:20,359 --> 00:07:24,160
How is it that we would respond if God said no to us?

194
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,519
No, David, I don't want you to build a temple.

195
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,239
Sometimes you tell a kid no and you see how they behave.

196
00:07:31,359 --> 00:07:34,119
Unfortunately, there are times in which you tell an adult no

197
00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:36,359
and though they may not throw the same kind of fit

198
00:07:36,359 --> 00:07:38,119
that Johnny will as two or three years old,

199
00:07:38,119 --> 00:07:40,000
they kind of respond in like fashion.

200
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,320
We've just kind of been able to clean it up a little bit.

201
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,320
You understand.

202
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,799
But God told David no.

203
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,559
See, though you might desire a good thing,

204
00:07:50,559 --> 00:07:52,160
God's plan must take priority.

205
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,720
Number two, another thought is that we need to rejoice

206
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,480
in God's faithfulness to reveal this plan.

207
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:01,640
I'm so thankful that God that night appeared to Nathan

208
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,320
and said, no, no, this is my plan.

209
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,320
Communicate this to David.

210
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,720
And Nathan was faithful to go and take to David

211
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,679
the plan of God.

212
00:08:09,679 --> 00:08:11,920
I'm so thankful that God has revealed his plan.

213
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,000
He doesn't just leave us here with no direction, no plan.

214
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,839
He's given us a plan.

215
00:08:17,679 --> 00:08:19,760
A third thought from that passage

216
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,880
that's really the introduction to this chapter

217
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:25,000
in 1 Chronicles 22 is that we need to submit

218
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,839
to the plan of God and do our part.

219
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:30,720
You know, when you look at David receiving a no answer,

220
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,400
David didn't just throw in the towel and say,

221
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,799
well, then fine, I'm not gonna do anything.

222
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,200
If I can't do what I wanna do,

223
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,679
I'm just not gonna do anything.

224
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,320
Kind of the kid on the basketball court.

225
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,679
If we're not gonna play by my rules,

226
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:44,080
I'm taking my ball and going home kind of an attitude.

227
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,520
No, no, David understood the plan of God

228
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,320
and David prepared and he worked

229
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,200
and he understood the future

230
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,960
and he understood that Solomon, his son,

231
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,760
was going to be the one to build the temple.

232
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,719
And so he was going to do his part

233
00:08:57,719 --> 00:09:00,599
in the preparation for the construction of the temple.

234
00:09:00,599 --> 00:09:01,719
That's commendable.

235
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:05,280
As we think about this text in 1 Chronicles 22

236
00:09:05,359 --> 00:09:08,960
and fast forward from that desire that David had

237
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,719
and the plan of God being revealed,

238
00:09:10,719 --> 00:09:13,599
I want you to consider with me this morning

239
00:09:13,599 --> 00:09:17,000
the importance of David's communication to Solomon

240
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,320
as it's contained here in chapter 22

241
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,200
of the book of 1 Chronicles.

242
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,000
I want you to notice if you look at the text

243
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,840
and you're taking notes,

244
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,440
number one, consider what Solomon recognized.

245
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,159
In the first few verses of 1 Chronicles 22,

246
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:30,159
we've read them already.

247
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:32,919
We find that David is communicating here.

248
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:34,799
He's commanded in verse number two

249
00:09:35,239 --> 00:09:36,919
to bring all of these individuals together

250
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:39,320
and we find that the scene is being set for us

251
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,200
as to this great event that is taking place

252
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,239
in Israel's history.

253
00:09:43,239 --> 00:09:45,599
And we find the Bible would tell us

254
00:09:45,599 --> 00:09:47,200
in these verses of Scripture,

255
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,880
those that had been gathered

256
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,159
and as David is then addressing

257
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:52,520
those that have been gathered,

258
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,880
he tells them that Solomon is his son

259
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,119
and young and tender.

260
00:09:56,119 --> 00:09:57,799
And he tells them about the house

261
00:09:57,799 --> 00:09:59,440
that was going to be built for the Lord.

262
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,520
And he tells them that Solomon

263
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:05,520
He tells them how that he prepared abundantly.

264
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:10,760
And then we find that in v. 6,

265
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,960
that he called for Solomon.

266
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,560
He called for Solomon.

267
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,560
And as he brings Solomon in to his presence,

268
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,280
we find that here Solomon is called

269
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,280
and will receive a charge.

270
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,080
We find that really from v. 6

271
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,240
all the way down through v. 16,

272
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,320
the attention now,

273
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,160
though there's all of these individuals

274
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,760
that are gathered together,

275
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,920
the attention and the focus of the passage

276
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,920
and the scene is that David

277
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,480
is issuing a charge to Solomon.

278
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,080
He'll address some of the others

279
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,200
throughout the process,

280
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,400
but primarily we find that the focus

281
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,480
in this next section of this chapter of the Bible

282
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,920
is that Solomon is receiving this charge.

283
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,000
I want you to consider what Solomon recognized.

284
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,080
We find in v. 6 that the Bible says,

285
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,440
then he, David, called for Solomon his son

286
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,440
and charged him to do what?

287
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:05,400
To build a house for the Lord God of Israel.

288
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,600
David rehearses what his desire was

289
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,720
in v. 7.

290
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,520
It says,

291
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,680
And David said to Solomon,

292
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,200
My son, ask for me.

293
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,040
It was in my mind to build a house

294
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,760
unto the name of the Lord my God.

295
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,480
But the word of the Lord came to me,

296
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,440
saying, Thou hast shed blood abundantly

297
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,000
and hast made great wars.

298
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,640
Thou shalt not build a house unto my name,

299
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,160
because Thou hast shed much blood

300
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,680
on the earth in my sight.

301
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:35,240
Behold, a son shall be born to thee,

302
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,280
who shall be a man of rest.

303
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,200
And I, God says, I will give him rest

304
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,680
from all his enemies round about.

305
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,280
Notice this, for his name shall be Solomon,

306
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,920
and I will give peace and quietness

307
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,000
unto Israel in his days.

308
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,440
He shall build a house for my name,

309
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,960
and he shall be my son,

310
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,000
and I will be his father,

311
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,360
and I will establish the throne of his kingdom

312
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,360
over Israel forever.

313
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,680
Now, think about these verses.

314
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,240
Think about Solomon receiving this charge,

315
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,920
this reference that is given to us

316
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,800
of Solomon standing there in the presence

317
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,440
of all of those that have been gathered

318
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,840
according to verse number two.

319
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,680
And David says,

320
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,600
Listen, Solomon, I want you to understand,

321
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,440
it was in my heart.

322
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,280
It was my plan.

323
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,280
It was my desire.

324
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,520
But God said no,

325
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,520
and God said that it would be my son.

326
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,560
Solomon, it would be you

327
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,520
that would build a temple.

328
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,280
And that's a big responsibility.

329
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,880
We find that David is going to give

330
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,520
the encouragement to Solomon.

331
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,520
He reveals to Solomon that this is the plan

332
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,840
and will of God for you, Solomon.

333
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,280
It is to build a temple.

334
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:47,920
He goes further and he encourages Solomon

335
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,280
to depend upon the Lord for the work,

336
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,960
for the task that was at hand.

337
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,120
He says in verse number 11,

338
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,720
Now, my son, the Lord be with thee

339
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,640
and prosper thou,

340
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,800
and build the house of the Lord thy God

341
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,800
as He hath said to thee.

342
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,400
Only the Lord give thee wisdom

343
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,320
and understanding

344
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,040
and give thee charge concerning Israel

345
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,960
that thou mayest keep the law

346
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,800
of the Lord thy God.

347
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,400
Then shalt thou prosper.

348
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,920
If thou takest heed to fulfill the statutes

349
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,320
and judgments which the Lord charged Moses with

350
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,680
concerning Israel,

351
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,000
be strong and of good courage.

352
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,240
Dread not, nor be dismayed.

353
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,680
Solomon, this is the plan and will of God for you.

354
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,520
Trust the Lord.

355
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,680
Depend upon God.

356
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,680
You need His strength.

357
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,680
You need His direction.

358
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,360
You need His wisdom.

359
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,000
And Solomon, this task that is before you,

360
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,880
this is your responsibility.

361
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,640
And God has revealed His plan.

362
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,920
And therefore, I want you to understand

363
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,960
that this I'm communicating to you.

364
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,480
Remember the significance of the communication

365
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,000
here between David and Solomon

366
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,480
in 1 Chronicles 22.

367
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,840
And Solomon had to recognize something.

368
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,960
And what Solomon had to recognize

369
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,600
is he had to recognize for himself

370
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,720
that this indeed is the will of God

371
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,680
and this is my responsibility.

372
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,520
We find that in verse 14

373
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,360
and really the beginning of verse number 16

374
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,720
that David communicates to his son Solomon

375
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,400
that the materials have been provided.

376
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,560
Notice in verse number 14,

377
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,480
Now, behold, in my trouble,

378
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,320
I have prepared for the house of the Lord

379
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,440
and a hundred thousand talents of gold

380
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,120
and a thousand talents of silver

381
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,280
and of brass and iron without weight.

382
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,360
For it is in abundance.

383
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,520
Timber also and stone have I prepared

384
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,680
and thou mayest add thereto.

385
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,560
Verse 16, of the gold, the silver,

386
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,000
and the brass and the iron,

387
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
there is no number.

388
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,720
David says, though it was not permitted

389
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,960
for me to build this house,

390
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,320
I understood the plan of God

391
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,280
and I prepared.

392
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,880
And here are the materials

393
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,720
that have been set aside.

394
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,040
The materials that have been provided

395
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,800
for the task that is at hand.

396
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,560
Not only did he provide the materials,

397
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,200
but according to verse number 15,

398
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,800
the labor was provided as well.

399
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,120
The Bible says, moreover, in verse 15,

400
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,400
there are workmen with thee in abundance,

401
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,040
hewers and workers of stone and timber

402
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,520
and all manner of cunning men

403
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:11,480
for every manner of work.

404
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:15,760
I like the perspective of David.

405
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,840
And I like the plan of David

406
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,720
and the preparation and the way in which

407
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,440
he was going to leave his son

408
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,880
in a position in which he could

409
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,640
fulfill the will of God.

410
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,280
See, David understood that this is the will of God,

411
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,120
that it was Solomon that would build a house,

412
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,000
and David didn't say,

413
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,720
well, then I'm going to just retire

414
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,520
and enjoy the rest of my days on life

415
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,600
and I'm going to sit back in my easy chair

416
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,680
and just enjoy life.

417
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,120
No, I'm going to prepare so that I can

418
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,800
have my son in a position

419
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,760
where he can do what God has for him to do.

420
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,160
That's commendable.

421
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,800
But really, the focus of the chapter

422
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,800
has to do with Solomon.

423
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,360
Is Solomon going to recognize and accept

424
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,320
that which is being communicated to him?

425
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,920
Is Solomon going to embrace

426
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,560
the responsibility that David is communicating?

427
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:08,440
The plan, the will of God for his life.

428
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,120
We find that in verse number 16

429
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:14,920
at the end of the charge.

430
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,040
I would say that it's a lengthy charge.

431
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,040
There's detail that is provided.

432
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,000
The latter phrase of verse number 16,

433
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,480
Arise, therefore, based upon Solomon

434
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,800
what I have communicated to you,

435
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:36,840
arise and be doing.

436
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,120
And be doing.

437
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,440
And the Lord be with thee.

438
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,280
In other words,

439
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:48,400
I believe that David is saying to Solomon,

440
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,040
you have your assignment.

441
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,240
Now get busy.

442
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,720
I've done my part to communicate to you.

443
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,040
You need to recognize that this is your responsibility.

444
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,080
I believe based upon the next chapters

445
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,280
that we're going to look at,

446
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,760
I believe that Solomon recognized

447
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,280
that this indeed was the will of God for his life.

448
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,560
He trusted what his father was communicating to him.

449
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,920
And as David, the king of Israel,

450
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,360
would communicate this truth to him,

451
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,400
we find that Solomon is going to recognize

452
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,680
that yes, indeed, this is my responsibility.

453
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,600
Thus, we find not only what he recognized,

454
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,720
but notice number two with me,

455
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,360
consider how Solomon responded.

456
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,320
How did he respond?

457
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,360
Let me finish reading chapter 22.

458
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,120
The Bible says David also in verse 17

459
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,440
commanded all the princes of Israel

460
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,200
to help Solomon, his son.

461
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,240
So we find that again,

462
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,000
those that were gathered according to verse number two

463
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,520
are addressed by David.

464
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,280
And he says to them in verse 18,

465
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,040
is not the Lord your God with you?

466
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,160
And hath He not given you rest on every side?

467
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:52,920
For it's given the inhabitants of the land into mine hand,

468
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,640
and the land is subdued before the Lord

469
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,080
and before His people.

470
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,600
Now set your heart and your soul

471
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,800
to seek the Lord your God.

472
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,120
Arise therefore and build ye the sanctuary of the Lord God

473
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,880
to bring the ark of the covenant of the Lord

474
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,040
and the holy vessels of God

475
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,000
to the house that is to be built

476
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,120
to the name of the Lord.

477
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,880
They recognize the responsibility,

478
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,600
but notice how Solomon, consider with me

479
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,360
how Solomon responded.

480
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,920
See, I believe this morning,

481
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,160
even before we look at turn over to 2 Chronicles 2,

482
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,000
but before we dig into that passage,

483
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,840
I want you to consider with me this morning,

484
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,720
the fact that he, Solomon had to recognize something.

485
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,440
Listen, no one this morning

486
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,320
or throughout the history of the church

487
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,559
would criticize Solomon for not building the temple

488
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,200
if it had not been communicated to him

489
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,480
that that was his responsibility.

490
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,720
Would you agree?

491
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,720
If David did not communicate to Solomon,

492
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,920
if David did not say this is your duty,

493
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,880
this is your responsibility,

494
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,360
this is the will and plan of God for you, Solomon,

495
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,679
and here's what I've done

496
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,800
and now this is your responsibility,

497
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,400
if that had not been communicated to Solomon appropriately,

498
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,200
then no one would criticize Solomon

499
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,800
for not building the temple.

500
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:04,559
However, if David, as he did, as we see,

501
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,559
if he effectively communicated to Solomon

502
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,520
the plan and will of God,

503
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:14,280
and Solomon said, not really interested in doing that,

504
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,600
I have other plans, I'm gonna do what I want to do.

505
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,440
Thanks, Dad, I know you're the king,

506
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,200
but I'm gonna live my life, I'm gonna do what I want to do.

507
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,600
From that point until now,

508
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,800
we'd have reason to criticize Solomon.

509
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,640
Would we not?

510
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,600
Why?

511
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,640
Because it was communicated to him

512
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,760
what his responsibility was.

513
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,640
And so how he responds to that

514
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,720
which he recognizes in chapter 22 of 1 Chronicles

515
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,239
is of significant importance.

516
00:19:43,239 --> 00:19:46,040
We can recognize something as being the plan

517
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:49,200
and will of God, but how do we respond to it?

518
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,160
And we find here in the text of Scripture

519
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,800
in 2 Chronicles chapter number two

520
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,200
that I am thankful to be able to say

521
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:57,040
that Solomon responded properly.

522
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:00,080
In verse number one, notice the Bible says,

523
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,880
of 2 Chronicles chapter number two.

524
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:09,040
and Solomon determined to build a house for the name of the Lord and a house

525
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:13,000
for his kingdom." This wasn't something that just came into the mind of Solomon

526
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,680
one day, you know, I think I'm gonna build a temple. No, no, it had been communicated

527
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:20,880
to him that this was the plan and will of God, and therefore, I love the verbiage,

528
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,680
the Bible says, and Solomon determined. That word determined, we see that

529
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:29,400
Solomon's response to that which he understood, to that which he recognized,

530
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:36,720
he responded with determination, firm resolution, settled purpose. When you say

531
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,080
that you're gonna determine to do something, that's not a half-hearted

532
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:45,240
approach, is it? You ever hear somebody say, well, I'm gonna try to do that, and I

533
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:49,400
often say, don't try, you're either gonna do it or you're not. Don't tell me this,

534
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:54,680
I'm gonna try to do this, because really, we need to determine to do some things.

535
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:59,080
When we know that it's the plan and will of God, when we understand that God has

536
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:03,720
communicated and revealed to us what his purpose and plan is for us, we need

537
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:09,640
to respond with determination like Solomon did. And Solomon determined to

538
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:14,080
build a house. He understood and recognized his responsibility, and he

539
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:19,480
responds appropriately in verse number two, and Solomon told out three score and

540
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:23,280
ten thousand men to bear burdens, and four score thousand to hew in the

541
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,960
mountain, and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them. And Solomon

542
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,880
sent to Haram the king of Tyre, saying, as thou didst deal with David my father,

543
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:37,080
and didst send him cedars to build a house to dwell therein, even so deal with

544
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:42,720
me. Behold, notice what he says in verse number four, I build a house to the name

545
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:50,360
of the Lord my God, to dedicate it to him, and to burn before him sweet incense, and

546
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:54,120
for the continual showbread, and for the burnt offerings, morning and evening, on

547
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:58,160
the Sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feast of the Lord our God.

548
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:03,720
This is an ordinance forever to Israel. I believe that we see in verses one

549
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,320
through four of 2nd Chronicles 2 that Solomon is responding with

550
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:11,720
determination. I find that in verses five and six that he responds with humility

551
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:18,480
and reverence. He responds with determination. I'm resolved, I have this

552
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,779
settled purpose that I'm going to do this, and it's good that he has

553
00:22:21,779 --> 00:22:26,180
determination, but I find in verses five and six that his response is one of

554
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:31,100
humility and reverence. Notice the Bible says, and the house which I build is

555
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:40,139
great. Why? For great is our God above all gods. He understands the greatness of God.

556
00:22:40,139 --> 00:22:47,419
He stands in awe of who God is. We find that if Solomon would recognize who God

557
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:51,860
is, and he would recognize the task that is before him, this is something that

558
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:55,860
will be done with reverence and with humility. You find in verse number six,

559
00:22:55,860 --> 00:23:02,660
but who is able to build him in house? Seeing the heaven and heaven of heavens

560
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:11,300
cannot contain him. Who am I then that I should build him in house, save only to

561
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:18,380
earn sacrifice before him? You ever wonder why God lets us serve him? I mean,

562
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:25,540
honestly, he is the God of the universe, the creator and sustainer of all things,

563
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:30,940
but he loved us so much that he sent his son to die for us, so we can enter into a

564
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:39,580
relationship with him, and we can enjoy his presence, and he allows us to serve

565
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:47,540
him. Who am I? Who am I? I mean, you find in Isaiah, chapter number six, the call of

566
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:52,900
Isaiah, I'm a man of unclean lips. I mean, Isaiah falls in the very presence of the

567
00:23:52,900 --> 00:24:00,779
holiness of God. God says, who shall go for us? I'm thankful that Isaiah says,

568
00:24:00,779 --> 00:24:08,100
here am I. See, we may not have, as we look at the text of Scripture here, this same

569
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:11,660
responsibility. We understand that we don't. We're not building a temple today.

570
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:17,059
We understand that God has a plan and a will for our lives. And as I notice the

571
00:24:17,059 --> 00:24:22,940
response of Solomon, he responds with determination, he responds with humility

572
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:26,459
and with reverence. I believe that he responds with understanding. Notice in

573
00:24:26,459 --> 00:24:31,619
verse 7, send me now therefore a man cunning to work in gold and in silver

574
00:24:31,619 --> 00:24:36,100
and brass and iron and purple, crimson, blue, and that can skill to grave with

575
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:39,179
the cunning men that are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my

576
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:44,020
father did provide. Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, algum trees out of

577
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:48,619
Lebanon, for I know that my servants can skill to cut timber in Lebanon, and

578
00:24:48,619 --> 00:24:54,260
behold, my servants shall be with thy servants. Even to prepare me timber in

579
00:24:54,260 --> 00:25:04,000
abundance for the house which I am about to build shall be wonderful, great. He had

580
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,679
understanding. Remember it was David in 1st Chronicles 22 that told him he had

581
00:25:08,679 --> 00:25:13,399
prepared, but that he also would be able to prepare and thou mayest add thereto

582
00:25:13,399 --> 00:25:16,880
according to the last statement of verse number 14 of 1st Chronicles 22. But

583
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:21,420
remember that one of David, as he was charging Solomon, one of the statements

584
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:26,040
that he made was that only the Lord give thee wisdom and understanding in verse

585
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:30,440
number 12. I believe that Solomon displays here in chapter 2 of 2nd

586
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,720
Chronicles that he had understanding. He responded with understanding to that

587
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:39,399
which had been given to him to do. Turn over, if you will, to chapter number 3

588
00:25:39,399 --> 00:25:45,440
here in 2nd Chronicles. Notice in verse number 1. Until we get to chapter 3,

589
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:54,760
verse number 1, it's all a plan. We can plan all kinds of things, but what

590
00:25:54,760 --> 00:26:03,320
is it that that David charged Solomon with? Arise therefore and be doing. Not

591
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:08,360
arise therefore and be planning. Again, I'm not trying to say that planning isn't

592
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:13,119
important, but understand that we can plan and plan and plan and plan and plan

593
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:23,559
and plan up some more and never actually do. In chapter 2, there's still planning

594
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:30,320
that is taking place. Preparation, more materials, more workers. But in chapter

595
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,640
number 3, the Bible says in verse number 1,

596
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:41,279
then Solomon began. Then Solomon began to build the house of the Lord at

597
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:47,399
Jerusalem in Mount Moriah, where the Lord appeared unto David his father in the

598
00:26:47,399 --> 00:26:52,320
place that David had prepared in the threshing floor of Arnon, the Jebusite.

599
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:57,880
Again in verse number 2, and he began to build in the second day of the second

600
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:01,959
month in the fourth year of his reign. There's a lot of preparation that was

601
00:27:01,959 --> 00:27:06,520
going on, but I'm thankful that it came to the place where the work commenced. It

602
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:14,920
started. Arise therefore and be doing. And when we think about the response here of

603
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:19,880
Solomon, and we understand by his response that he recognized and embraced

604
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:24,279
the assignment that God had given him, and this morning as we think about

605
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:27,920
Solomon and we think about his response and we look at these portions of

606
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:32,320
Scripture in 2 Chronicles 2 and 2 Chronicles 3, we must conclude, we must

607
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:37,480
identify this morning that he, Solomon, embraced the assignment and

608
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:44,880
he engaged in the work. It wasn't enough if he just recognized that this was what

609
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,279
had to be done. It wasn't enough if he just said, well, somebody else can do

610
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:53,279
that. It's just gonna be too much trouble. I mean, this is a really big

611
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:58,480
assignment. This is, man, as far as we can tell, there are no excuses that are

612
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:04,920
offered. There's an understanding. There's a response. The embracing of the plan

613
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:10,339
that God has revealed through David, his father, and he engages in the work. We

614
00:28:10,339 --> 00:28:13,880
notice in this morning, we consider what he recognized. We consider how he

615
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:18,000
responded. Notice with me, consider the result. Turn over to chapter number 5, if

616
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:27,279
you will. In chapter number 5 of 2 Chronicles, the Bible says in verse

617
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:33,239
number 1, thus, all the work that Solomon made for the house of the Lord was, what's

618
00:28:33,239 --> 00:28:40,320
it say? Isn't that good? It was finished. It was finished. You might want to

619
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:46,559
underline or circle that word in your Bible because you find that the

620
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:52,960
admonition, the charge of David, arise therefore and be doing that in chapter

621
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:57,919
number 3, the work commences, it begins, and now in chapter number 5, we find the

622
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:05,400
Bible says that the work that he had, the house of the Lord, was finished. There's

623
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:09,640
something about finishing a task. There's something about seeing something through

624
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:16,080
to the end. One of my children follows in the same kind of personality thing that I

625
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:22,200
have of wanting to mark off some tasks that you do in a particular day. It just

626
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:26,880
makes me feel good to check a box that I completed something. And you say, you're

627
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:33,400
weird. I know, it's okay. And you got weird things about you too, amen? I remember

628
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:37,840
sitting in a seminar when I was working for Sikorsky in a leadership program and

629
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:42,520
we're there and we broke up into various groups and began to reveal what our

630
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:46,400
personalities and how we dealt with things and because of the assessment

631
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:50,400
that had been done they had already put us in certain groups and it was a great

632
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:53,760
relief to me to find that everybody at the table that I was sitting with was a

633
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:59,880
list person and they just found such satisfaction of checking off a box of

634
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,880
the list. I was like, man, this is wonderful.

635
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:06,220
I thought I was the only one and I'll let you in on a secret sometimes

636
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:11,040
I have my list of things that I'm gonna do and then something comes up that I have to do that wasn't on the list

637
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,940
You know what? I do. I add it to the list so I can check it off

638
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,580
Amen, it brings me satisfaction

639
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:24,820
Maybe some of y'all are gonna start taking a list you say I need to do something like that too, but but the reality he finished

640
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:30,980
He finished notice what it says in the rest of verse number one and Solomon brought in all

641
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:36,820
The things that David his father had dedicated the silver the gold the instruments

642
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,360
Put he among the treasures of the house of God

643
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:45,720
We don't have time to read the entirety here of this chapter nor the next

644
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:50,000
But I want to draw your attention to verses 13 and 14 of chapter 5

645
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:54,520
It'll remind you of what you read in Exodus chapter number 40 when?

646
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:01,520
The work of the tabernacle was completed and they reared it up and the wonderful blessing that you find

647
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,880
at the end of that chapter

648
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,320
another era

649
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,560
another group of people, but the same God

650
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,680
And we find that in second Chronicles 5 in verse 13. It says it came even to pass as

651
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:21,440
The trumpeters and singers were as one to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the Lord

652
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:28,320
When they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music and praised the Lord saying

653
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:33,160
For he is good for his mercy endureth forever that

654
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:37,000
Then the house was filled with a cloud

655
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,640
even the house of the Lord

656
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:46,840
So that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of

657
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,600
God

658
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:52,000
You see there's a little word at the end of verse number 13 then

659
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,840
You don't get then if you don't do

660
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,480
Arise therefore and be doing if

661
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:07,120
Solomon did not respond properly if he did not embrace the task that had been assigned to him the will and plan of God

662
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:13,520
He's never going to see the glory of the Lord fill the temple. Why because he never built the temple, right?

663
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:20,160
So why is it that we get to this passage in 2nd Chronicles 5 verses 13 and 14 to see this great?

664
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:26,919
Just image in our minds and your sanctified imagination to see the temple being built into now

665
00:32:26,919 --> 00:32:31,080
It's finished and the work is completed in the glory of the Lord fills the house

666
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:38,240
So much so that the Bible tells us that the priest could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud in

667
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:43,600
verse number 14 chapter 6 records for us how that Solomon is

668
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:50,279
Speaking there and of course the the prayer of Solomon is contained in much of chapter number 6 and

669
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,779
Really the last two-thirds of the chapter is the the prayer of Solomon

670
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:00,040
If you fast-forward to verse number 1 of chapter 7

671
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:05,760
I want you to notice that the Bible says now when Solomon had made an end of praying again

672
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:10,360
That's what we contain in the two-third the latter two-third portion of chapter number 6

673
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:13,080
We don't have time to read it this morning. Go back and read it later

674
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:20,000
But when he finished praying the Bible says that the fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices and the glory

675
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,960
of the Lord filled the house

676
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:26,240
the priests could not enter into the house of the Lord because the glory of the Lord had filled the Lord's house when all the

677
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,840
Children of Israel saw how the fire came down the glory of the Lord upon the house

678
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:36,320
They bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement and worshiped and praised the Lord saying for he is good for his

679
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,800
Mercy endureth forever when you notice verse number 3

680
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:45,000
I want you to notice what the Bible says and when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down

681
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,160
They saw how the glory of the Lord filled the temple

682
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:52,800
You know what those people got to see God work because somebody obeyed what God said to do

683
00:33:54,240 --> 00:34:00,320
Amen all the people in Israel wouldn't have seen this great thing if Solomon said well

684
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,320
I don't know if that's really what I want to do

685
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,240
Arise

686
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,919
Therefore and be doing and

687
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:14,760
Solomon recognized the charge he accepted and recognized the the responsibility that was his and he responded in obedience

688
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:22,080
And he engaged in the work and the work is finished and God moves and God works and the people

689
00:34:22,839 --> 00:34:24,839
See and worship the Lord

690
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:31,959
verse 11 of 2nd Chronicles 7 says thus Solomon finished the house of the Lord and the king's house and

691
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:39,000
All that came into Solomon's heart to make in the house of the Lord and in his own house. He prosperously affected

692
00:34:40,959 --> 00:34:48,119
We see here as we would think about this portion of Scripture and really we've looked at a number of chapters this morning

693
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,360
As we look at this thought

694
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:57,720
Today with regard to Solomon and the responsibility and that which had been communicated to him

695
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:03,720
We understand that again as I mentioned a moment ago, there's no temple for us to build today

696
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:09,119
I'm not going to say to you this morning. Hey, listen, we need to go build a temple

697
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,720
It's not our responsibility

698
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,679
It's not the will of God for us this morning to go build a temple

699
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:21,239
But you know God has revealed to us what his plan and will is for us as a church

700
00:35:21,959 --> 00:35:24,119
The church is the pillar and ground of the truth

701
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:28,480
The church is a lighthouse the church is a beacon the church is

702
00:35:29,279 --> 00:35:36,080
The responsibility of the the believers, you know, we understand the church will use the term church, but we understand the church is made up of believers

703
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:41,399
we understand this morning that we'd speak about the the local church that it's a a

704
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:47,920
visible church the organized people that God has placed in the church the body of Christ and

705
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:52,399
And we find this morning that if we were to to take some

706
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:57,279
Application as we look at the life of Solomon and look at what takes place again this morning

707
00:35:57,279 --> 00:36:00,559
We can rejoice that Solomon fulfilled what God had for him

708
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:06,920
And we can understand for a number of generations. There's the temple that's there in

709
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,959
Jerusalem and the beauty of it and all that took place there

710
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,260
It's because he did what God told him to do

711
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,480
David the king of Israel

712
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,600
gave

713
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:28,200
to Solomon his son who would become the king a charge a command if you will a

714
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:30,600
mission

715
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,119
Arise, therefore and be doing

716
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:39,080
We find that Solomon responded properly

717
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:45,440
I'd like to tell you this morning if we could make application for us as New Testament believers that the king of kings and Lord of

718
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,480
Lords has given us as his people a mission a

719
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,600
responsibility a duty a

720
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,880
Commission as we'd often refer to it as

721
00:36:56,559 --> 00:37:03,559
And you'd find this morning that there are some even I I know a fella a pastor that actually wrote a book as he would

722
00:37:03,559 --> 00:37:08,040
Speak about the Great Commission, and he said that really in our churches today. It's the great omission

723
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,720
Wow

724
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:18,239
The Great Commission notice what Jesus says in Matthew 28 turn over there you're familiar with the passage, but I want you to see it

725
00:37:19,959 --> 00:37:21,959
In Matthew chapter number 28

726
00:37:21,959 --> 00:37:26,320
Jesus has already gone to the cross of Calvary's already shed his blood. He's been to the tomb

727
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:33,279
He's risen in victory conquering sin death in the grave. He's appeared to the disciples. It's soon before now

728
00:37:33,279 --> 00:37:35,839
He will be going and ascending to heaven

729
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:40,000
But before his ascension he speaks to his disciples and in Matthew's

730
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:45,640
Account here the Bible says in verse number 18 of Matthew 28 and Jesus now understand who he is

731
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:52,360
He's king of kings the Lord of Lords. He's spake unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth

732
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:58,200
Go ye therefore I understand the the verbiage is different

733
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:04,839
But you remember what David said arise therefore and be doing here. We find it says go ye therefore

734
00:38:05,959 --> 00:38:07,679
And teach all nations

735
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:10,160
Baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son of the Holy Ghost

736
00:38:10,839 --> 00:38:17,080
Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever. I have commanded you and lo I am with you all way even unto the end of the world

737
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:19,600
Amen

738
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,320
What a powerful instruction that's been given to us

739
00:38:23,399 --> 00:38:25,399
now this morning

740
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:31,220
We mentioned that David communicated to Solomon. He was faithful to communicate the plan the will of God

741
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:35,419
Remember David in 1st Chronicles 17 he had in his heart. I'm gonna build a temple

742
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:39,140
Nathan said go and do it and then God said to Nathan no

743
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:44,700
That very night God appeared to Nathan and said you need to go and you need to tell David

744
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:48,739
no, and and share with him what my plan and what my will is and

745
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:55,799
David takes that instruction from God and then he communicates that to Solomon thus making Solomon

746
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,220
responsible

747
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,739
Amen if

748
00:38:59,739 --> 00:39:05,500
David did not communicate to Solomon the plan and will of God as I mentioned earlier this morning

749
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:11,919
He would not we would not go through the process of criticizing Solomon for not doing what he didn't know. He was supposed to do

750
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,500
right

751
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:18,059
Anyone ever say to you? Why didn't you do that? And you're like you didn't tell me to do that and

752
00:39:18,679 --> 00:39:22,299
Now I'm accountable for something that you didn't even communicate to me to do

753
00:39:23,179 --> 00:39:25,179
Can I tell you that God Almighty?

754
00:39:26,179 --> 00:39:30,619
Has been faithful to communicate to us as his people what his plan and will is

755
00:39:32,059 --> 00:39:37,179
It's not a matter of whether or not God communicate it the truth to us

756
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:40,660
really

757
00:39:40,739 --> 00:39:45,059
It hinges upon our response to what has been communicated

758
00:39:46,099 --> 00:39:48,099
Because God has clearly

759
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:54,220
Faithfully communicated what his plan and will is for us as a church a church is not a club

760
00:39:55,179 --> 00:40:01,979
It's not a church has got a mission a purpose

761
00:40:01,979 --> 00:40:09,539
a plan. We think that here as God would communicate to us maybe this morning

762
00:40:09,539 --> 00:40:12,939
it's possible that there'd be one that would sit amongst us or one that's

763
00:40:12,939 --> 00:40:17,579
watching on livestream that honestly this morning before the Lord was

764
00:40:17,579 --> 00:40:21,179
ignorant to the teaching of the Great Commission and they say I never knew

765
00:40:21,179 --> 00:40:24,819
that I never knew that that was my responsibility it's absolutely possible

766
00:40:24,819 --> 00:40:35,179
but now you know. Is that fair? And so the question is how do we respond? We rejoice

767
00:40:35,179 --> 00:40:43,019
with Solomon as to how he responded to the assignment what his response was to

768
00:40:43,019 --> 00:40:47,259
to that which had been communicated to him and so this morning as we think

769
00:40:47,259 --> 00:40:52,779
about an application for us as the people of God in 2021 the question would

770
00:40:52,779 --> 00:40:56,699
be do we recognize our assignment and if so as we'd answer if we don't

771
00:40:56,699 --> 00:41:02,099
recognize it we teach it as we recognize the assignment this morning the question

772
00:41:02,099 --> 00:41:09,899
is how do I respond? How do I respond? Is it possible this morning that Solomon do

773
00:41:09,899 --> 00:41:13,659
you think that it's possible this morning that Solomon could have offered

774
00:41:13,659 --> 00:41:19,659
some excuses for not doing that that work? Sure he could have. I mean man is

775
00:41:19,659 --> 00:41:24,819
full of excuses. Amen? You just talk to people for a little while and you

776
00:41:24,819 --> 00:41:32,459
understand we got excuses for all kinds of things but we find that Solomon

777
00:41:32,459 --> 00:41:39,099
didn't make excuse. He got busy. He got busy preparing planning but then the

778
00:41:39,099 --> 00:41:44,099
work began. Arise therefore and be doing. You understand as New Testament

779
00:41:44,099 --> 00:41:47,099
believers according to James chapter 1 and verse number 22 we're not to be

780
00:41:47,099 --> 00:41:54,259
hearers only we're to be doers of the Word. Doers. Taking the truth that's been

781
00:41:54,259 --> 00:41:57,659
communicated to us from the Word of God and putting it in practice in our life

782
00:41:57,659 --> 00:42:05,259
and doing working out the will of God in our lives. According to Acts 5 and verse

783
00:42:05,259 --> 00:42:13,459
number 32 we are his witnesses. According to 2nd Corinthians 5 and verse number

784
00:42:13,539 --> 00:42:19,419
20 we are his ambassadors. His representatives. By the way you'd

785
00:42:19,419 --> 00:42:22,979
understand that that's not simply referring to someone that would fill a

786
00:42:22,979 --> 00:42:30,379
clergy quote-unquote position. That's a born-again believer. We're his witnesses.

787
00:42:30,379 --> 00:42:34,579
You know what makes us effective witnesses is that we've been born again.

788
00:42:34,579 --> 00:42:39,939
If you've experienced what Jesus has done for you, if you've experienced the

789
00:42:40,939 --> 00:42:44,739
transformation power of the gospel and you've been saved it makes you a

790
00:42:44,739 --> 00:42:49,939
witness. You can be effective as a witness because you've experienced what

791
00:42:49,939 --> 00:42:56,179
Jesus did for you. I was taking Brianna out yesterday to do some highway driving

792
00:42:56,179 --> 00:42:58,499
because she's getting ready to get her license. By the way kid I make

793
00:42:58,499 --> 00:43:02,099
congratulations on getting your license. We've been more careful recently. I'm

794
00:43:02,099 --> 00:43:06,739
just teasing but congratulations. So Brianna is getting close to the point of

795
00:43:06,739 --> 00:43:10,659
getting her license. She's not driven on the highway on 66 and so I said we're

796
00:43:10,659 --> 00:43:15,059
gonna drive out to Front Royal and we did. And wouldn't you know that just as

797
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:17,779
we're getting close to Gainesville there's a three-car accident right in

798
00:43:17,779 --> 00:43:24,459
front of us. It was right in front of us with about 200 cars in between us so

799
00:43:24,459 --> 00:43:30,179
guess what I didn't see what happened. So if an officer showed up and said hey can

800
00:43:30,179 --> 00:43:33,459
you give me a statement were you a witness? All I could have done in that

801
00:43:33,459 --> 00:43:40,059
situation is assume what happened based upon what I saw. That's not a good

802
00:43:40,059 --> 00:43:45,019
witness. That's not reliable in a court of law. But there was a truck that was

803
00:43:45,019 --> 00:43:48,739
there that seemingly was right behind it when it happened and he pulled off to

804
00:43:48,739 --> 00:43:52,099
the side and I think he was an eyewitness based upon how he was

805
00:43:52,099 --> 00:43:57,059
behaving. And I think he could probably give a good report as to what happened.

806
00:43:57,059 --> 00:44:02,859
Why? Because he saw it. He was an eyewitness. He doesn't have to assume

807
00:44:02,859 --> 00:44:06,939
that something happened. He doesn't have to well I think maybe this and I think

808
00:44:06,939 --> 00:44:13,819
it was that car. No he saw it. If you've been born again you're a witness and

809
00:44:13,819 --> 00:44:18,099
you're effective in being a witness because you can say this is what this

810
00:44:18,099 --> 00:44:26,099
is what Christ did for me. This is how he changed my life. This is how he gave me

811
00:44:26,099 --> 00:44:31,419
not only eternal life but he gave me abundant life and we're his ambassadors.

812
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:35,899
And the Bible tells us in Ephesians chapter number two when we think about

813
00:44:35,899 --> 00:44:40,539
that great truth of the fact that we're saved by grace through faith it's not of

814
00:44:40,539 --> 00:44:44,979
ourselves that it's the gift that we understand that it's not by works lest

815
00:44:44,979 --> 00:44:48,259
any man should boast but we notice in chapter number two in verse number ten

816
00:44:48,259 --> 00:44:55,839
the Bible says this in Ephesians 2 10 for we are his workmanship created in

817
00:44:55,839 --> 00:45:03,119
Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk

818
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:11,559
in them I would say this this morning being a disciple of Jesus Christ would

819
00:45:11,559 --> 00:45:19,799
be best described as being a participant and not a spectator a participant getting

820
00:45:19,799 --> 00:45:24,159
involved in the work of God what is it that God wants for me to do where is it

821
00:45:24,159 --> 00:45:29,719
that I can serve God how is it that I can be a witness that I can take that

822
00:45:29,719 --> 00:45:34,479
Great Commission that has been communicated to me from God Almighty the

823
00:45:34,479 --> 00:45:40,279
King of Kings and I'm going to embrace it and I'm going to seek to to be the

824
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:43,999
witness that God would enable me to be and by the way you don't go in your own

825
00:45:43,999 --> 00:45:49,199
power he said I'm with you you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has

826
00:45:49,199 --> 00:45:53,039
come upon you right in Acts 1 in verse number 8 I'm so thankful that I don't

827
00:45:53,079 --> 00:45:58,279
go in my own power my own strength and I don't have to come up with whatever the

828
00:45:58,279 --> 00:46:02,919
if you read all of the text between 1st Chronicles and 2nd Chronicles you know

829
00:46:02,919 --> 00:46:08,399
David gave some plans for the temple he made lots of preparation you understand

830
00:46:08,399 --> 00:46:11,759
that when you go out to to give the gospel to people you don't have to come

831
00:46:11,759 --> 00:46:16,719
up with your own ideas of what to say just get on the Word of God and then

832
00:46:16,719 --> 00:46:21,719
guess what the Holy Spirit of God uses the Word of God and he convicts and

833
00:46:21,719 --> 00:46:27,559
convinces John tells us that he's to reprove the world of sin of Christ

834
00:46:27,559 --> 00:46:33,559
righteousness and of judgment to come as we use the Word of God he does that what

835
00:46:33,559 --> 00:46:38,639
a blessing March Madness is going on right now I don't have a TV so I'm not

836
00:46:38,639 --> 00:46:43,139
seeing any of the games but I've seen some of the news and typically in a

837
00:46:43,139 --> 00:46:48,479
normal year it's a very exciting time of the year for college basketball and it's

838
00:46:48,479 --> 00:46:51,519
interesting obviously with regard to Kovat and what-have-you there's some

839
00:46:51,519 --> 00:46:54,839
places they have spectators not as many as they used to have but it's a very

840
00:46:54,839 --> 00:47:01,839
different thing being a participant on that floor and being a spectator right

841
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:09,299
our team won what did you do I watched I cheered I know man that guy hit the

842
00:47:09,299 --> 00:47:15,039
winning shot I saw this morning and again I don't really normally use sports

843
00:47:15,039 --> 00:47:19,359
but Texas got beat by somebody they shouldn't got beat by and that guy stood

844
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:26,039
at the foul line down by one with 1.2 seconds left and had two shots whoo he

845
00:47:26,039 --> 00:47:31,159
made both of them and they won that guy has got a different perspective than the

846
00:47:31,159 --> 00:47:37,439
guy sitting in the stands and here's the amazing thing turn over to first

847
00:47:37,439 --> 00:47:39,679
Corinthians and we'll look at this and then I'll say what I was going to say

848
00:47:39,679 --> 00:47:47,519
1st Corinthians chapter 3 the church in Corinth there was division and

849
00:47:47,519 --> 00:47:53,799
carnality and all of that that was going on and Paul gives them valuable

850
00:47:53,799 --> 00:47:59,519
instruction we know it's the Word of God in verse number 5 of 1st Corinthians

851
00:47:59,519 --> 00:48:05,479
3 the Bible says who then is Paul and who is Apollos but ministers by whom you

852
00:48:05,479 --> 00:48:10,399
believed even as the Lord gave to every man remember when Solomon said when he

853
00:48:10,399 --> 00:48:18,639
responded with reverence and humility who am I to build a house for God you

854
00:48:18,639 --> 00:48:26,999
know who are we to go and proclaim this message other than the fact that God

855
00:48:26,999 --> 00:48:33,199
would call us to do so Solomon who am I to do this well this is God's plan and

856
00:48:33,199 --> 00:48:37,320
will for you Solomon it's God's plan and will for you to go tell somebody

857
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:41,959
about Jesus you say well I'm not qualified if you're saved you're

858
00:48:41,959 --> 00:48:46,959
qualified and by the way not being qualified isn't a good excuse anyway get

859
00:48:46,959 --> 00:48:55,239
qualified if you feel like I don't know what to say find out what to say amen

860
00:48:55,239 --> 00:49:01,679
who are we we're just servants we're just ministers notice verse 6 I have

861
00:49:01,679 --> 00:49:12,159
planted Apollos watered but God gave the increase so then this is good

862
00:49:12,159 --> 00:49:18,479
because it helps us with that humility thing so then neither is he that plant

863
00:49:18,479 --> 00:49:23,599
death anything try to get full of yourself man I gave that person the

864
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:31,239
gospel we're nothing we're just servants just ministers neither he that

865
00:49:31,239 --> 00:49:38,639
watereth but God that giveth the increase now he that planteth and he

866
00:49:38,639 --> 00:49:42,359
that watereth are one and every man shall receive his own reward according

867
00:49:42,359 --> 00:49:49,959
to his own labor notice this for we are laborers together with God you're God's

868
00:49:49,959 --> 00:49:53,760
husbandry you're God's building I wonder this morning how are we laboring

869
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:59,839
together with God how are we laboring together with God we're familiar you

870
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:03,239
don't need to turn there we don't have time

871
00:50:03,239 --> 00:50:06,439
but we're familiar with the account in Mark chapter number 2,

872
00:50:06,439 --> 00:50:09,339
the man that was born of four.

873
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:11,439
And you think about the text of Scripture,

874
00:50:11,439 --> 00:50:14,539
and you think of all that's taking place there,

875
00:50:14,539 --> 00:50:21,739
that man had no way to get to Jesus on his own.

876
00:50:21,739 --> 00:50:24,139
And I believe it was very unlikely that one person

877
00:50:24,139 --> 00:50:27,439
was going to effectively be able to get him to Jesus.

878
00:50:27,439 --> 00:50:30,739
And so he gathered, the one maybe gathered his friends and said,

879
00:50:30,739 --> 00:50:33,039
hey, listen, you take that corner, you take that corner,

880
00:50:33,039 --> 00:50:34,939
I'm going to get this corner and you get that corner,

881
00:50:34,939 --> 00:50:38,039
and we're going to take this guy to Jesus.

882
00:50:38,039 --> 00:50:40,739
And we're laborers together with God,

883
00:50:40,739 --> 00:50:43,839
according to 1 Corinthians 3 and verse number 9.

884
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:46,439
And I just wonder this morning,

885
00:50:46,439 --> 00:50:50,039
arise therefore and be doing.

886
00:50:50,039 --> 00:50:52,539
Arise therefore and be doing.

887
00:50:52,539 --> 00:50:58,439
Are we really putting into practice our Christianity?

888
00:50:58,439 --> 00:51:03,339
Are we living out the Gospel?

889
00:51:03,339 --> 00:51:05,739
We're His representatives.

890
00:51:05,739 --> 00:51:09,539
There are many people today that would give all of their opinions and ideas

891
00:51:09,539 --> 00:51:14,239
as to what's wrong with our nation and our world.

892
00:51:14,239 --> 00:51:17,439
The answers vary and there are many.

893
00:51:17,439 --> 00:51:22,439
But I would submit to you this morning that one of the main factors

894
00:51:22,439 --> 00:51:25,739
that has led to so much wickedness in our world

895
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:32,139
is the fact that the church has not fulfilled its responsibility.

896
00:51:32,139 --> 00:51:35,639
And it falls on our shoulders to repent and say,

897
00:51:35,639 --> 00:51:38,439
you know what God, forgive us.

898
00:51:38,439 --> 00:51:41,539
We've not done what you've called us to do.

899
00:51:41,539 --> 00:51:47,239
We got real comfortable, been real convenient for a season.

900
00:51:47,239 --> 00:51:51,739
We see wickedness is prevailing all around us.

901
00:51:51,739 --> 00:51:52,839
What's the answer?

902
00:51:52,839 --> 00:51:54,439
Elect somebody different.

903
00:51:54,439 --> 00:51:55,639
Baloney.

904
00:51:55,639 --> 00:51:57,439
It's not the answer.

905
00:51:57,439 --> 00:52:00,539
The answer is Jesus.

906
00:52:00,539 --> 00:52:05,939
And until we as the church stand up and rise and be doing,

907
00:52:05,939 --> 00:52:08,839
we can expect more of the same.

908
00:52:08,839 --> 00:52:12,539
In fact, worse and worse.

909
00:52:12,539 --> 00:52:16,539
We're the light of the world.

910
00:52:16,539 --> 00:52:18,839
Brannon and I were singing this morning on the way to church.

911
00:52:18,839 --> 00:52:21,239
She's been coming early with me on Sunday mornings.

912
00:52:21,239 --> 00:52:24,339
This little light of mine.

913
00:52:24,339 --> 00:52:25,739
I'm going to let it shine.

914
00:52:25,739 --> 00:52:28,139
We sing it with the kids.

915
00:52:28,139 --> 00:52:31,239
But somewhere in between adolescence and adulthood,

916
00:52:31,239 --> 00:52:32,939
we get to the place where we say,

917
00:52:32,939 --> 00:52:35,739
no, I am going to hide it under my bushel

918
00:52:35,739 --> 00:52:37,439
because I don't want anybody to know

919
00:52:37,439 --> 00:52:40,039
because I don't know that they're going to respond.

920
00:52:40,039 --> 00:52:42,939
Right?

921
00:52:42,939 --> 00:52:44,439
We got to rise up.

922
00:52:44,439 --> 00:52:49,539
Arise, therefore, and be doing.

923
00:52:49,639 --> 00:52:53,139
Do the work of God.

924
00:52:53,139 --> 00:52:55,539
We commend Solomon.

925
00:52:55,539 --> 00:53:01,139
We applaud, rejoice in reading 2 Chronicles 5-7.

926
00:53:01,139 --> 00:53:04,939
I mean, it's an exciting portion of Scripture.

927
00:53:04,939 --> 00:53:09,239
And just as those individuals in Israel saw the glory of God,

928
00:53:09,239 --> 00:53:12,439
you know, when you engage in sharing the gospel,

929
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:15,539
not every person you share the gospel with is going to be saved,

930
00:53:15,539 --> 00:53:18,739
but eventually you're going to see somebody get saved.

931
00:53:18,739 --> 00:53:23,039
Man, I can't even explain to you, humanly speaking,

932
00:53:23,039 --> 00:53:25,739
what that joy is like.

933
00:53:25,739 --> 00:53:31,939
When you see somebody in a moment pass from death unto life,

934
00:53:31,939 --> 00:53:33,839
if you've led somebody to Christ in your life,

935
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:37,239
you know what that experience is like.

936
00:53:37,239 --> 00:53:40,339
It's amazing.

937
00:53:40,339 --> 00:53:42,539
But if you ain't sowing the seed,

938
00:53:42,539 --> 00:53:45,839
you're probably not going to have that opportunity.

939
00:53:46,039 --> 00:53:49,639
Arise, therefore, and be doing.

940
00:53:49,639 --> 00:53:50,339
Let's pray.

941
00:53:50,339 --> 00:53:55,039
Father, I thank You for convicting me,

942
00:53:55,039 --> 00:53:56,739
not only as I prepared the message,

943
00:53:56,739 --> 00:54:03,539
but even now as I've delivered the message.

944
00:54:03,539 --> 00:54:07,339
Thank You for Solomon.

945
00:54:07,339 --> 00:54:11,539
This portion of Scripture, the charge from David,

946
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:17,839
the King of Israel, to his son.

947
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:20,139
I'm thankful this morning that You are the King of Kings

948
00:54:20,139 --> 00:54:23,039
and that we are Your children, the sons of God,

949
00:54:23,039 --> 00:54:24,039
because we've believed in Your name.

950
00:54:24,039 --> 00:54:26,739
We've been saved.

951
00:54:26,739 --> 00:54:29,940
And though the verbiage is different

952
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:35,039
from 1 Chronicles 22.16 to Matthew 28.19,

953
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:42,839
I believe the sentiment is similar, if not exact.

954
00:54:42,839 --> 00:54:46,839
Go ye, therefore, is what You've told us.

955
00:54:46,839 --> 00:54:50,539
David said, Arise, therefore, and be doing.

956
00:54:50,539 --> 00:54:52,839
God, would You help us this morning to be honest

957
00:54:52,839 --> 00:55:01,940
and responsive to the Word of God?

958
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:07,839
Your witnesses, your ambassadors, your workmen.

959
00:55:07,839 --> 00:55:13,639
Help us, God, to recognize our responsibility,

960
00:55:13,639 --> 00:55:16,139
to respond properly to it,

961
00:55:16,139 --> 00:55:21,440
to embrace and engage in the work.

962
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:27,839
That we might see You work in a mighty, powerful way.

963
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:32,039
Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners.

964
00:55:32,039 --> 00:55:35,440
He's able to save them to the uttermost.

965
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:37,339
We believe, even as we sing the song,

966
00:55:37,339 --> 00:55:39,239
Jesus saves, that You still save.

967
00:55:39,239 --> 00:55:41,839
You're the Savior of the world.

968
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:46,039
And oh, that we'd be careful to obey Your instruction.

969
00:55:46,039 --> 00:55:47,539
As we have this time of invitation,

970
00:55:47,539 --> 00:55:52,539
I pray that You'd work and move the hearts of Your people.

971
00:55:52,539 --> 00:55:53,940
I pray this morning that the response

972
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:57,539
would not be one of emotion.

973
00:55:57,539 --> 00:56:02,440
Emotional responses rarely last.

974
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:06,739
But I pray for a response that would endure,

975
00:56:06,739 --> 00:56:12,839
because it's based upon the truth of Your Word.

976
00:56:12,839 --> 00:56:15,039
We'll thank You and praise You for the work that You'll do

977
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:17,039
and for the decisions that are made.

978
00:56:17,039 --> 00:56:18,139
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

979
00:56:18,139 --> 00:56:20,039
Would You stand with me?

980
00:56:20,039 --> 00:56:21,139
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

981
00:56:21,139 --> 00:56:23,839
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano.

982
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:25,539
And as she does, I want to give you an invitation,

983
00:56:25,539 --> 00:56:27,539
an opportunity to respond.

984
00:56:27,539 --> 00:56:31,239
At this altar or in your pew,

985
00:56:31,239 --> 00:56:33,739
would you let God have His way in your life

986
00:56:33,739 --> 00:56:35,739
as Kimberly plays?
