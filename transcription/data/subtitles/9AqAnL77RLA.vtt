WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.639
weeks now, this is lesson number five from this new series that we started

00:00:04.639 --> 00:00:08.399
here in this calendar year. From

00:00:08.399 --> 00:00:12.680
the latter portion of 1 Thessalonians 5 and in the latter portion of 2

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.979
Thessalonians 3, we'll look at both of those passages during this

00:00:15.979 --> 00:00:20.840
midweek Bible study. I've titled it, Walk Worthy, Please God,

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.000
and we know this evening that God's Word is profitable, amen?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.760
And I'm so thankful that God has given us the Bible, He's given us His Word in

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.040
these closing verses of 1 Thessalonians, as we've learned in the last several

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.119
weeks. We find that God provides very practical instruction for the church at

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:40.840
Thessalonica. Not only does He provide the practical instruction for the church

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.400
at Thessalonica, but He's preserved it for every church throughout the church

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.279
age, and we have the opportunity to study this, and when this instruction is

00:00:50.279 --> 00:00:56.279
received and applied, then we, like the church at Thessalonica, can walk worthy

00:00:56.279 --> 00:01:00.360
and please God. I know I've said this often, but it certainly should be the

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.919
goal of every individual believer that we would walk worthy and please God.

00:01:05.919 --> 00:01:11.199
Corporately, it ought to be the desire of every local church that we would walk

00:01:11.199 --> 00:01:16.720
worthy and please God. By the way, the reason that we're here is to magnify the

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.040
Lord Jesus Christ, we are to exalt the Lord, we are to evangelize the lost, and

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.680
we are to edify the believers, the brethren, and that's our purpose. And if

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.839
we're not walking worthy, if we're not seeking to please God, if we're not

00:01:29.839 --> 00:01:34.279
living in such a way that we're taking His instruction, applying it in our lives,

00:01:34.279 --> 00:01:38.599
then really we have no business of being a New Testament church. And so we find

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:41.839
that God has provided us with this instruction. We've looked at several

00:01:41.839 --> 00:01:47.000
lessons already, the church and its pastor, unity in the church. Last week, as

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:53.120
we start at verse number four, we dealt with, or 14, excuse me, warn them that are

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.800
unruly. And we dealt with the fact that you're always going to have some that

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.239
are unruly, and that problem was there in Thessalonica, it's going to be in every

00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:05.919
local church. But God has given us the prescription for those that are unruly,

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:10.279
and the purpose of warning them is so that they would realign their lives with

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:14.600
the truth of God's word, and that they would walk worthy and please God. Why?

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.440
Because Jesus is coming, and one day we're going to stand before Christ. If

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.320
you're aware of the theme, really, of 1 and 2 Thessalonians, as you study both of

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:28.080
these books, you'll find that there's an obvious theme of the return of Christ.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.559
And the fact that Jesus is coming again, we look at 1 Thessalonians 4, verses 13

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:37.800
through 18, and you see in that passage very clearly the truth with regard to the

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.839
rapture. And you find that as you study through these portions of scripture, that

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:48.160
we believe, as it's taught in God's word, the imminent return of Christ. And we're

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.039
to be looking for his return, but as we're looking for his return, he's left us with

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:59.479
instruction on how we're to live while we're waiting for his return, and we find

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:03.720
that these instructions are here for us this evening. Tonight, as we continue

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.679
through verse number 14, we'll deal with the subject of comfort the feeble-minded.

00:03:08.679 --> 00:03:12.160
And that's the title for the message this evening, comfort the feeble-minded.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.160
I mentioned last week that we would look at these truths in verse 14 and 15 as

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.360
stand-alone individual lessons as we study through this portion of scripture.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.119
The feeble-minded are those who are faint of heart, those that are faint-hearted,

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:33.199
those that, it's kind of described this way, of being of little soul. Think about

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:38.240
this way. Typically, the individual that would be classified, if you will, of being

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:43.960
feeble-minded lacks confidence, and they will struggle to continue. They will

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:50.279
struggle with fulfilling the goal or the objectives that God has given us. They

00:03:50.279 --> 00:03:55.440
will struggle to continue. That's our theme, obviously, for this calendar year.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.520
They will struggle most during times of difficulty. We find that they're easily

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.919
discouraged. And as you begin to understand as we read verse 14, notice

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:11.039
again, the Bible says this, now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:18.519
unruly, comfort the feeble-minded, support the weak, be patient toward all men. And

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:23.040
so as we get into the second aspect of verse 14, comfort the feeble-minded, we

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:28.799
understand that these are those that are faint-hearted, those that are going to

00:04:28.799 --> 00:04:34.799
struggle with discouragement. We find that there will be times that each of us

00:04:34.799 --> 00:04:39.799
may struggle with being in this category of having some adversity and

00:04:39.799 --> 00:04:45.079
difficulty that would cause us to be discouraged. There's not any amongst us

00:04:45.079 --> 00:04:50.440
that are above being discouraged. By the way, I believe that discouragement is one

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.200
of the tools that is most often used in the toolbox of our enemy. That is to

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:01.000
discourage God's people. There are so many things that we can be discouraged

00:05:01.119 --> 00:05:06.559
because of, and we find that that is a tool that is often used as the enemy

00:05:06.559 --> 00:05:11.880
seeks to devour the people of God. Of course, we've mentioned in previous

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.839
messages as we understand the truth that we have an enemy that desires to devour

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:20.399
us, but in so doing, why? He doesn't want us to continue. But if he could

00:05:20.399 --> 00:05:25.200
discourage us, that he could cause us to be faint of heart, that he could cause us,

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.519
as it said here, to be feeble-minded, to be discouraged, and then we just kind of

00:05:29.519 --> 00:05:32.839
flounder around and we don't do what we're supposed to do. And so what is the

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:38.559
admonition? What is the exhortation here? Comfort the feeble-minded. I'm thankful,

00:05:38.559 --> 00:05:42.880
continue by way of introduction, I'm thankful this evening that God knows our

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:49.959
frame. God knows that we're but dust. He knows that we're mere men, and he knows

00:05:49.959 --> 00:05:55.559
our struggles. The Bible tells us that we have a high priest that can, he's

00:05:55.559 --> 00:06:02.640
able to succor us, to help us. He never sinned, but he was tempted in all points

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.720
like as we are, yet without sin, according to Hebrews chapter number 4.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:12.880
And we understand that he is our great high priest. He understands, and so he, in

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:18.359
knowing our frame, we understand that he is a kind and compassionate father, and

00:06:18.359 --> 00:06:23.679
that he provides us with the comfort and the encouragement that we need. I think

00:06:23.679 --> 00:06:28.000
that each of us could probably stand this evening and give testimony of times

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:34.119
in our lives where God comforted us, where God encouraged us, where God used a

00:06:34.119 --> 00:06:39.959
verse of Scripture, God used a fellow believer to give us that comfort and

00:06:39.959 --> 00:06:45.760
that encouragement that we needed in that difficult hour. We find this evening

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:50.200
that as the instruction is given to this local church in Thessalonica, but then

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:54.320
preserved for all churches throughout the church age, that we acknowledge this

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:59.640
evening that there will be some within each congregation that will be faint of

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:04.160
heart. They'll be feeble-minded. So what are we to do? We're to encourage them.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:08.440
We're to comfort them. I would ask just two questions really as we look at the

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:12.880
message this evening. Number one, if you're taking notes, what causes someone

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:17.799
to be feeble-minded? What causes it? What is the cause? Now listen, this evening it's

00:07:17.799 --> 00:07:21.200
not going to be an exhaustive list, obviously. There are many experiences

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:28.160
that can lead, that can cause you and can cause me to have times of discouragement

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.640
and disappointment, and we find that there are many experiences in life that

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:35.679
can adversely affect us. We acknowledge that this evening, but I want you to

00:07:35.679 --> 00:07:38.559
think about the church in Thessalonica and just look at a few things that God

00:07:38.559 --> 00:07:42.920
gives us as we study through this particular letter that will help us to

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:47.799
understand some of their experiences and why it is that this instruction is

00:07:47.799 --> 00:07:51.640
given at the end of the epistle. Notice in 1 Thessalonians

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:55.279
chapter 3, turn over there if you will, and look at the few verses here in 1

00:07:55.279 --> 00:08:00.880
Thessalonians 3, beginning in verse number 2. I'll just read verse 1 with it.

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:05.480
Notice in verse number 1, wherefore, when we could no longer forbear, we thought it

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:10.480
good to be left at Athens alone. Notice and sent Timotheus, our brother and

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:14.760
minister of God and our fellow labor in the gospel of Christ, notice what the

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:20.640
purpose was of sending Timothy there to the church at Thessalonica to establish

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:28.440
you and to comfort you concerning your faith. Why? Notice what it says in verse

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:35.799
number 3, that no man should be moved by what? By these afflictions. For yourselves

00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:39.440
know that we are appointed thereunto. In other words, while Paul was there

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:44.080
ministering to them, he had explained to them, as we read in 2 Timothy 3,

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:48.799
yea, all those that live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution. We find

00:08:48.799 --> 00:08:53.679
that this was explained to the church at Thessalonica. He says that yourselves

00:08:53.679 --> 00:08:58.200
know that we are appointed thereunto. Paul had taught them some things, and he

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:02.719
obviously, when he arrives in Thessalonica, it was under much persecution and much

00:09:02.719 --> 00:09:07.119
affliction. That's why he was not able to stay in Thessalonica for a very long time,

00:09:07.159 --> 00:09:13.479
because of all of the adversity. And so he says that their concern was that no

00:09:13.479 --> 00:09:18.159
man should be moved by these afflictions, by the experiences that they were having,

00:09:18.159 --> 00:09:21.880
the trials, the tribulation, the persecution. Notice in verse number 4,

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:25.159
for verily when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer

00:09:25.159 --> 00:09:30.640
tribulation, even as it came to pass. And ye know, for this cause, when I could no

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:36.919
longer forbear, I sent to know your faith. Notice this, lest by some means the

00:09:36.919 --> 00:09:45.400
tempter have tempted you, and our labor be in vain. Paul knew that the enemy was

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:51.400
active. Paul knew the enemy was active. Can I tell you that the enemy is active

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:57.280
today? I mean, he's active. I'm thankful for the Bible truth that one day he's

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:01.440
going to be bound for a thousand years.

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.680
But then the Bible tells us after that he's going to be loose for a little season.

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:10.480
But then after that little season, that final revolt, he's going to be cast like a fire

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:15.520
and he's going to be tormented day and night forever and ever.

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:16.560
That's what the Bible tells us.

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:19.560
But until then, he's active.

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:22.520
And as he is active, he's seeking to discourage.

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:26.540
He's seeking to discourage the people of God.

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:29.920
And here Paul says, I desire to know your faith.

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:30.920
Why?

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:35.520
Because I understand the way that the enemy works and I don't want you to be moved, according

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.760
to verse number three, by these afflictions.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:41.300
And he says that our labor would be in vain.

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:46.280
No doubt because of the experiences that are mentioned here in chapter number three, that

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:52.440
these believers in Thessalonica endured, we find that it would adversely affect some.

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:56.280
You know, not everybody responds the same way to persecution.

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:59.920
Not everybody responds the same way to adversity and difficulty.

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.240
Some people seem to be crushed by it.

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:07.160
I mean, they're feeble minded, they're faint of heart.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:13.000
The persecution, the adversity comes and I mean, it's just like, man, we can't go on.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.760
Others seem to rise up and become even more courageous.

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:19.760
I want you to think about even as you look back in Numbers chapter 14, we're not going

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:24.840
to turn there, but in chapter 13 and 14, the book of Numbers, God tells us about 12 spies

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:27.340
that went out to spy the land.

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:32.060
And there were 10 that came back that had this report that was a report that lacked

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:37.540
faith, a report that said we're not able, a report that was influenced by what they

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:42.380
saw more than by what God promised.

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:44.779
They saw that there were giants in the land.

00:11:44.779 --> 00:11:50.260
They saw that there were fortified cities with walls and they said we're just not able.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:56.300
But there were two, Joshua and Caleb, that they recalled what God said and God had promised

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:58.940
them and we find that they trusted the Lord.

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:01.819
But guess what happened to that entire congregation?

00:12:01.819 --> 00:12:05.720
They said they were ready to stone Joshua and Caleb, why?

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:09.479
Because they couldn't, they just didn't want to go forward.

00:12:09.479 --> 00:12:15.339
They looked at, they heard the report and they were discouraged.

00:12:15.339 --> 00:12:17.820
Not everybody responds the same way.

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:23.580
I noticed in chapter four, notice if you will, in 1 Thessalonians 4 and verse number 13,

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:29.660
the Bible says this, but I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:34.740
which are asleep, that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope.

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:41.020
Now we understand as we often look at 1 Thessalonians 4 verses 13 through 18, we're looking at that

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:45.380
passage and we're preaching on the rapture, the return of Christ and I mean it's a, it's

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:46.500
a high point.

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:50.860
But I want you to understand that as Paul is writing to these believers, he says I would

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:53.020
not that you be ignorant, brethren.

00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:55.339
He wants them to understand a truth.

00:12:55.339 --> 00:12:58.660
But notice what he says concerning them which are asleep.

00:12:58.660 --> 00:12:59.660
What's that mean?

00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:01.940
It means that they've died.

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:07.220
Remember when Lazarus was asleep, Jesus said Lazarus is, he's sleeping and the disciples

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:09.419
said, well, I mean, if he's sleeping, that's good.

00:13:09.419 --> 00:13:10.419
Why?

00:13:10.419 --> 00:13:14.100
Because I mean, if he was sick and you know, now he needs some sleep and like, don't disturb

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:15.100
him.

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:19.699
And Jesus spoke plainly and said, Lazarus is dead.

00:13:19.699 --> 00:13:23.619
And they understood and Jesus went and called him from the tomb, amen, and he came walking

00:13:23.619 --> 00:13:24.619
out.

00:13:24.619 --> 00:13:27.900
Praise the Lord that he has the power over the grave.

00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:32.699
And we find here this evening that as we look at 1 Thessalonians chapter 4 and verse 13,

00:13:32.699 --> 00:13:35.380
he says concerning them which are asleep, guess what?

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:39.300
There were some loved ones that had died.

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:41.979
You know, the death of a loved one affects people differently.

00:13:41.979 --> 00:13:44.979
It's a hard thing.

00:13:44.979 --> 00:13:48.500
I'm sure you've had people that have said, you've heard them say, I just don't know how

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:54.540
I could, and they start thinking about what if my spouse died or my child or my parent,

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:55.540
whatever.

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:58.180
And everyone's going to respond different to that situation.

00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:00.139
And notice what he says at the end of the verse.

00:14:00.139 --> 00:14:08.419
He says that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope.

00:14:08.419 --> 00:14:14.339
And then he teaches them the wonderful truth with regard to the rapture that the dead in

00:14:14.339 --> 00:14:17.260
Christ shall rise first.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.420
Then we which are alive and remain.

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:24.619
And what a beautiful passage of Scripture that teaches not only the imminency of Christ's

00:14:24.619 --> 00:14:27.140
return but the order of the resurrection.

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:31.899
And we find here in this text of Scripture that as he says that you sorrow not even as

00:14:31.899 --> 00:14:37.779
others which have no hope, perhaps there were some that were sorrowing as if they had no

00:14:37.779 --> 00:14:39.100
hope.

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:43.059
Thus the instruction is given.

00:14:43.059 --> 00:14:48.820
And when he says comfort the feeble-minded, there were some experiences that we see just

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:49.980
in 1 Thessalonians.

00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:55.019
Look in 2 Thessalonians, if you will, and we'll just reference one here in chapter number

00:14:55.019 --> 00:14:56.019
two.

00:14:56.019 --> 00:14:59.700
I want you to see some of what they're dealing with again.

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:04.160
The time of writing between 1 and 2 Thessalonians is not very long.

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:09.299
And we find that as Paul is writing here to the same church in 2 Thessalonians, we see

00:15:09.299 --> 00:15:13.860
in chapter two, notice what he says, now we beseech you, brethren, chapter two, verse

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:18.779
number one, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by our gathering together unto

00:15:18.779 --> 00:15:19.779
him.

00:15:19.779 --> 00:15:24.899
Again, the recurring theme throughout these two letters, the return of Christ and our

00:15:24.899 --> 00:15:29.019
gathering to him, I'm so thankful that this world is not my home, amen?

00:15:29.019 --> 00:15:33.940
I'm a pilgrim, I'm a stranger, I'm not home but I'm going home, amen?

00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:39.540
And we find that he says in our gathering unto him, but notice in verse two that ye

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:48.660
be not soon, notice what he says, shaken in mind or be troubled.

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:51.779
What was it that would cause them to be shaken in mind?

00:15:51.779 --> 00:15:55.119
What is it that would cause them to be troubled?

00:15:55.119 --> 00:16:03.619
Notice he says neither by spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us as that the day of

00:16:04.299 --> 00:16:06.619
Christ is at hand.

00:16:06.619 --> 00:16:10.500
Let no man, verse three, deceive you by any means.

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:15.100
And so we find that as we notice what's taking place at the church in Thessalonica, there

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:22.100
were some false teachers that were writing letters to the church at Thessalonica saying

00:16:22.619 --> 00:16:27.019
that it was from Paul and they were teaching false doctrine.

00:16:27.019 --> 00:16:28.739
And guess what that false doctrine was doing?

00:16:28.739 --> 00:16:31.420
It was causing them to be shaken in mind.

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:33.459
It was causing them to be troubled.

00:16:33.459 --> 00:16:38.380
And so Paul says, no, we're gonna correct this, we don't want you to be shaken in mind,

00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:43.100
we don't want you to be troubled, we want you to understand the truth.

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:47.739
And so then we find that he, Paul, continues to teach them here, they were in need of instruction,

00:16:47.739 --> 00:16:49.739
they were in need of encouragement.

00:16:49.739 --> 00:16:54.119
We find that Jesus, you remember after he told the disciples that he was going to go

00:16:54.119 --> 00:16:58.580
to the cross of Calvary, he'd been telling them that for many times, but John 13 makes

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:04.260
it abundantly clear, and he says in John 14, let not your heart be troubled.

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:08.739
And we know that verse of Scripture, that text of Scripture, and it's interesting as

00:17:08.739 --> 00:17:14.899
he uses that phraseology, it carries with it that word troubled in John 14, one, to

00:17:14.899 --> 00:17:17.860
take away calmness of mind.

00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:20.980
That's what it means.

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:25.600
It means to render anxious or distressed.

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:29.760
So Jesus says, let not your heart be troubled.

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:35.360
Here we find that as Paul is writing to the church at Thessalonica, and he's seeking to

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:40.600
provide them, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God, instruction with regard

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:47.220
to dealing with church affairs and how they're to operate, yes, warn them that are unruly.

00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:50.959
There are gonna be some unruly folks, and you gotta warn them, you gotta teach them,

00:17:50.959 --> 00:17:55.080
you gotta use the Scripture, but there are going to be some that are feeble-minded, and

00:17:55.080 --> 00:18:01.760
we understand this evening some of the reasons, as it's revealed to us in 1 and 2 Thessalonians,

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:07.040
as to why some of those would be feeble-minded.

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:11.080
Now not all of them would be, but some of them would.

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:13.679
So what's the instruction?

00:18:13.679 --> 00:18:15.559
Comfort them.

00:18:15.559 --> 00:18:17.339
Comfort them.

00:18:17.339 --> 00:18:19.279
So he says comfort the feeble-minded.

00:18:19.279 --> 00:18:22.679
We asked the question, what causes someone to be feeble-minded?

00:18:22.679 --> 00:18:28.679
Now we ask the question, number two, how can we comfort the feeble-minded?

00:18:28.679 --> 00:18:33.320
As you look at the text of Scripture, we find that it's the people of God that are given

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:37.239
the instruction to comfort the people of God that are feeble-minded.

00:18:37.239 --> 00:18:38.479
Would you agree?

00:18:38.479 --> 00:18:43.000
Notice what Paul says in verse number 14, now we exhort you, who?

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.000
Brethren.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.000
What's the exhortation?

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.720
Number one, warn them that are unruly.

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:49.080
Number two, comfort the feeble-minded.

00:18:49.119 --> 00:18:53.119
And so therefore, that means, as we look here in this portion of Scripture, that there's

00:18:53.119 --> 00:18:58.440
some instruction to you, there's some instruction to me, that we're to comfort the feeble-minded.

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:00.440
How do we do that?

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:06.960
Well first, before we can comfort anyone, we must acknowledge that God is the comforter.

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:09.859
It is absolutely essential that we start there.

00:19:09.859 --> 00:19:13.880
You cannot, you don't know the words to say to comfort someone in your own strength, in

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:18.880
your own power, but when you acknowledge that God is the comforter, one of the names of

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:23.559
the Holy Spirit is that he is the comforter, when the comforter shall come, amen?

00:19:23.559 --> 00:19:26.159
And what a great truth of God's word.

00:19:26.159 --> 00:19:31.280
But I want you to turn over to 2 Corinthians chapter number one, and I want you to look

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:37.239
here at this portion of Scripture, just read a few verses, as we consider tonight how can

00:19:37.239 --> 00:19:40.119
we comfort the feeble-minded.

00:19:40.119 --> 00:19:44.400
We notice that there are some things that would cause perhaps some to be feeble-minded,

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:51.119
to be faint of heart, to not have the courage to continue, in times of difficulty especially,

00:19:51.119 --> 00:19:52.440
they're easily discouraged.

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:53.840
And so what is it that we can do?

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:57.119
Well we acknowledge first of all that God is the comforter.

00:19:57.119 --> 00:20:01.119
Notice in 2 Corinthians chapter one, in verse number three, notice what the Bible says,

00:20:01.119 --> 00:20:07.519
it be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and notice

00:20:07.519 --> 00:20:13.199
how it's described in the God of all comfort.

00:20:13.199 --> 00:20:20.359
Notice verse 4, who comforteth us in all our tribulation.

00:20:20.359 --> 00:20:22.939
Aren't you thankful for that truth?

00:20:22.939 --> 00:20:31.059
It says this, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble by the comfort

00:20:31.059 --> 00:20:35.699
wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.

00:20:35.699 --> 00:20:42.379
For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ.

00:20:42.379 --> 00:20:48.279
And so we find that in verses 3 and 4 specifically, we understand that God has revealed to us

00:20:48.279 --> 00:20:53.239
the truth here that He is the God of all comfort and He comforts us, but as He comforts

00:20:53.239 --> 00:20:57.839
us He then will enable us to be able to comfort others.

00:20:57.839 --> 00:21:01.919
You know there are some times in life that God might allow you to go through something

00:21:01.919 --> 00:21:07.159
so that you can help someone else down the road.

00:21:07.159 --> 00:21:10.439
Sometimes we don't think about it that way when we're going through it.

00:21:10.439 --> 00:21:12.879
You know how we think about it when we're going through it?

00:21:12.879 --> 00:21:13.879
Why me?

00:21:13.879 --> 00:21:15.919
Woe is me.

00:21:15.919 --> 00:21:17.339
Life isn't fair.

00:21:17.399 --> 00:21:18.399
Why is this happening?

00:21:18.399 --> 00:21:19.399
Isn't that typical?

00:21:19.399 --> 00:21:23.059
I mean that's typically how we respond.

00:21:23.059 --> 00:21:27.859
There are times in your life and in my life that God will allow us to go through something

00:21:27.859 --> 00:21:35.299
and He will comfort us through that something and we may not find out for years how God

00:21:35.299 --> 00:21:39.859
will then use us to be a comfort to someone else.

00:21:39.859 --> 00:21:43.179
Have you ever heard somebody to say to you when you're dealing with a time of adversity

00:21:44.179 --> 00:21:49.019
and they say to you I understand and you think immediately no you don't, you've never experienced

00:21:49.019 --> 00:21:50.019
what I'm experiencing.

00:21:50.019 --> 00:21:52.139
Have you ever had that happen?

00:21:52.139 --> 00:21:56.659
You know how much different it is when somebody can say I understand and they went through

00:21:56.659 --> 00:21:59.539
what you're going through?

00:21:59.539 --> 00:22:02.099
It makes a major difference.

00:22:02.099 --> 00:22:09.639
We find that God in His divine wisdom, in His providence, at times He will allow us

00:22:09.639 --> 00:22:13.239
to deal with some things so that we can comfort others.

00:22:13.239 --> 00:22:14.239
He comforts us.

00:22:14.239 --> 00:22:16.080
We have the promise.

00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:20.379
We can receive the comfort but then we too can comfort others.

00:22:20.379 --> 00:22:24.959
After we acknowledge that God is the comforter then God will give us opportunities to comfort

00:22:24.959 --> 00:22:25.959
others.

00:22:25.959 --> 00:22:28.039
How appropriate that we sang this evening to start the service.

00:22:28.039 --> 00:22:29.039
Make me a blessing.

00:22:29.039 --> 00:22:34.159
I mean what a joy to think about the connection between that song that we sang to start the

00:22:34.159 --> 00:22:38.739
service tonight and the thought of the message this evening with regard to comfort others.

00:22:38.739 --> 00:22:43.659
This word comfort in 1 Thessalonians 5 and verse number 14, it literally means this,

00:22:43.659 --> 00:22:45.139
to speak to someone.

00:22:45.139 --> 00:22:46.899
That's what it means.

00:22:46.899 --> 00:22:52.259
It carries with it the idea of to calm or to console, to encourage.

00:22:52.259 --> 00:22:53.259
You know what that means?

00:22:53.259 --> 00:22:57.699
As you think about the understanding of this thought behind the word comfort, it's not

00:22:57.699 --> 00:23:02.739
the main word that's used for comfort throughout our New Testament.

00:23:02.739 --> 00:23:05.779
And here it means to come and to speak with someone.

00:23:05.779 --> 00:23:07.419
That means that you've got to come close to them.

00:23:07.419 --> 00:23:12.139
You've got to kind of get, put your arm around them and kind of get into their world.

00:23:12.139 --> 00:23:14.580
Do you understand what I mean by that phraseology?

00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:18.339
And here he says comfort the feeble-minded.

00:23:18.339 --> 00:23:23.940
We find in 1 Thessalonians chapter 2 and verse number 11, notice what the Bible says here

00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:27.699
in the beginning of this portion of Scripture in 1 Thessalonians.

00:23:27.699 --> 00:23:34.580
He says in chapter 2 and verse number 7, we were gentle among you even as a nurse cherisheth

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:36.119
her children.

00:23:36.119 --> 00:23:40.159
You see the approach of ministry of Paul and those that were with him.

00:23:40.159 --> 00:23:46.159
We find in verse number 11 he says, as ye know how we exhorted, notice, and comforted

00:23:46.159 --> 00:23:53.000
and charged every one of you as a father doth his children.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.879
You think about how you interact with your children.

00:23:56.879 --> 00:24:01.720
The times that you have to correct them, no doubt, but the times that you're comforting

00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:06.559
them that they're struggling with something and you come alongside them and you're helping

00:24:06.559 --> 00:24:07.559
them.

00:24:07.559 --> 00:24:12.679
It's not always, and I know sometimes we kind of act this way and maybe we say this in just

00:24:12.679 --> 00:24:18.199
maybe a passing comment of grow up and get over it, but that's not really comforting

00:24:18.199 --> 00:24:19.559
anybody.

00:24:19.559 --> 00:24:21.639
Would you agree?

00:24:21.639 --> 00:24:23.559
Sometimes we can take that approach in life.

00:24:23.559 --> 00:24:25.260
We don't have the patience with someone.

00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:30.760
We don't have the time that's invested, but you understand, listen, if you have a child

00:24:30.799 --> 00:24:35.000
that's really struggling with something, they're really faint of heart over something, then

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.239
you're going to come alongside them and you're going to try to comfort them.

00:24:38.239 --> 00:24:43.760
You're going to speak with them and you're going to pray with them Lord willing and point

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:44.760
them to Christ.

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:48.839
Notice in chapter 3 and verse number 2, we've read the verses already, but he said that

00:24:48.839 --> 00:24:53.839
and sent Timotheus, listen, when he says in verse number 1 of chapter 3, when we could

00:24:53.839 --> 00:25:00.320
no longer forbear, it was eating Paul up that he didn't know how they were doing.

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:02.959
He knew that they were facing adversity.

00:25:02.959 --> 00:25:07.519
He knew that there were afflictions that they were enduring, but he did not know how they

00:25:07.519 --> 00:25:09.079
were handling it all.

00:25:09.079 --> 00:25:10.440
And it was a concern to him.

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:14.160
You know what Paul says as he's writing in 2 Corinthians, he talks about all the things

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:15.959
that befell him.

00:25:15.959 --> 00:25:20.359
He talks about all of these terrible things of being whipped and beaten and shipwrecked

00:25:20.359 --> 00:25:23.059
and stoned and so forth and so on.

00:25:23.059 --> 00:25:27.440
But then he says at the end of all of that, he says, and that which cometh upon me daily,

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:31.880
the care of all the churches.

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:36.000
Can I tell you this evening, and I don't say this in a prideful manner or in a way for

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.779
anyone to feel sorry for anyone, but when someone is in a place of ministry that God

00:25:40.779 --> 00:25:47.320
has put them in, unless you're in that place, you cannot fully understand the care of all

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:49.160
the churches.

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:50.559
You just can't.

00:25:50.559 --> 00:25:56.760
And Paul's like, all that external stuff, bring it on, but it's the care of all the

00:25:57.079 --> 00:25:58.079
churches.

00:25:58.079 --> 00:25:59.519
How are they doing?

00:25:59.519 --> 00:26:01.100
And it was eating them up.

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:02.320
So what does he do?

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:04.119
He sent Timothy.

00:26:04.119 --> 00:26:08.359
He couldn't go himself, so he sends Timothy, why?

00:26:08.359 --> 00:26:14.639
To comfort them, to find out how they were doing, to get a report.

00:26:14.639 --> 00:26:23.699
And in sending Timothy, it's that comfort, that speaking to, that close encounter, amen?

00:26:23.699 --> 00:26:25.579
And we find that he gives this instruction.

00:26:25.579 --> 00:26:32.059
It's true that God is the God of all comfort, yet we find that God uses his people over

00:26:32.059 --> 00:26:34.959
and over to comfort one another.

00:26:34.959 --> 00:26:39.660
He's the God of all comfort, but I want you to understand that he uses us, he uses his

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:40.660
children.

00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:45.699
Thus, we find that Paul says, brethren, this exhortation is to the brethren, comfort the

00:26:45.699 --> 00:26:48.859
feeble-minded.

00:26:48.859 --> 00:26:53.380
Notice with me quickly, if you will, in 2 Corinthians chapter 7, 2 Corinthians chapter

00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:57.359
number 7, notice what Paul says in this portion of Scripture.

00:26:57.359 --> 00:27:02.100
He was dealing with some real difficulty in all that was going on.

00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:04.940
He says in verse number 5 that their flesh had no rest.

00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:09.660
He says in verse number 5 that they were troubled on every side, without were fighting, within

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:10.660
were fears.

00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:14.839
I mean, it was a troublous time, but notice what Paul says in 2 Corinthians 7 and verse

00:27:14.839 --> 00:27:23.479
number 6, nevertheless, God that comforteth those that are cast down.

00:27:23.479 --> 00:27:25.799
Notice how God comforted him in this time.

00:27:25.799 --> 00:27:27.919
He comforted us by what?

00:27:27.919 --> 00:27:33.160
The coming of Titus.

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:35.279
God comforts us.

00:27:35.279 --> 00:27:37.679
Sometimes he uses his people to comfort us.

00:27:37.679 --> 00:27:44.000
You've been in a situation where someone just says, hey, let's get coffee, let's go

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:50.199
out to lunch, let's do whatever, can we meet, and there's just a, maybe they just show up.

00:27:50.199 --> 00:27:55.119
I know in 2024 it's not so common that we just show up at people's houses anymore like

00:27:55.119 --> 00:28:02.160
it was in previous generations, but he says that God comforts, but how God chose to comfort

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:07.679
in this particular circumstance was by the coming of Titus.

00:28:07.679 --> 00:28:12.479
You know, I think Paul's heart was overwhelmed with great joy when he saw Titus coming and

00:28:12.479 --> 00:28:16.880
how God used Titus to comfort and to encourage.

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:18.760
What a blessing.

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:23.880
Colossians 4 and verse number 11, you can jot down Ephesians 6 verses 21 and 22.

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:28.040
We won't take the time this evening to look there, but I want you to look at Colossians

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:29.040
4.

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:31.399
We'll mention just a couple of more verses and be done this evening.

00:28:31.639 --> 00:28:40.760
Colossians 4 and verse number 11, notice what Paul says about these fellow workers.

00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:45.679
He names several of them, starting in verse number 7, I'll actually just start there and

00:28:45.679 --> 00:28:46.679
get it in context.

00:28:46.679 --> 00:28:51.359
It says, all my estate shall Tychicus declare unto you, who is a beloved brother and a faithful

00:28:51.359 --> 00:28:55.640
minister and fellow servant in the Lord, whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose,

00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:58.760
that he might know your estate and do what?

00:28:58.760 --> 00:28:59.880
Comfort your hearts.

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:04.400
Verse number 9, with Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you.

00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:07.400
They shall make known unto you all things which are done here.

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:12.599
Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, saluteth you, and Marcus, sister son to Barnabas, touching

00:29:12.599 --> 00:29:17.080
whom you received commandments, if he come unto you, receive him, and Jesus, which is

00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:20.239
called justice, who are of the circumcision.

00:29:20.239 --> 00:29:25.719
These only are my fellow workers unto the kingdom of God, notice, which have been a

00:29:25.719 --> 00:29:29.359
comfort unto me.

00:29:29.359 --> 00:29:34.760
We acknowledge this evening readily that God is the God of all comfort, but we see

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:41.320
it over and over scripturally that God uses his people to comfort one another.

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:42.559
So how do we comfort?

00:29:42.559 --> 00:29:48.159
Well, we first have to acknowledge that God is the God of all comfort, then we ask God,

00:29:48.159 --> 00:29:51.960
we seek those opportunities that God would give us to comfort others.

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:52.960
What do we do?

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:55.440
Well, we must point them to Jesus.

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:59.119
We must point them to Jesus and we must point them to his word.

00:29:59.119 --> 00:30:00.559
You know, in 1 Thessalonians 4...

00:30:00.559 --> 00:30:03.159
We read verse 13, where he talked about

00:30:03.159 --> 00:30:05.539
those that were asleep, those who had died,

00:30:05.539 --> 00:30:08.539
that you sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.

00:30:08.539 --> 00:30:10.879
But in verse number 18, you know what Paul says

00:30:10.879 --> 00:30:12.439
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God?

00:30:12.439 --> 00:30:16.339
Wherefore, comfort one another with what?

00:30:16.339 --> 00:30:18.519
These words.

00:30:18.519 --> 00:30:19.679
What words?

00:30:19.679 --> 00:30:23.579
That Jesus is coming, that it's an imminent return,

00:30:23.579 --> 00:30:25.419
that there's an order,

00:30:25.419 --> 00:30:28.259
that the dead in Christ shall rise first.

00:30:28.259 --> 00:30:29.859
Don't be discouraged.

00:30:29.959 --> 00:30:32.259
I understand, listen, we should sorrow,

00:30:32.259 --> 00:30:34.619
we should mourn, and we should weep,

00:30:34.619 --> 00:30:37.899
but we don't weep in sorrow as others which have no hope.

00:30:37.899 --> 00:30:39.339
Why?

00:30:39.339 --> 00:30:40.759
Because we understand the truth of God's word

00:30:40.759 --> 00:30:42.459
with regard to a loved one

00:30:42.459 --> 00:30:44.339
that was saved by the grace of God,

00:30:44.339 --> 00:30:45.799
that enters into eternity,

00:30:45.799 --> 00:30:47.479
that to be absent from the body

00:30:47.479 --> 00:30:48.999
is to be present with the Lord,

00:30:48.999 --> 00:30:52.639
and one day there's gonna be a great reunion, hallelujah.

00:30:52.639 --> 00:30:54.419
And we find that though,

00:30:54.419 --> 00:30:57.159
when we deal with those circumstances in life,

00:30:57.159 --> 00:30:58.859
we can become discouraged,

00:30:58.859 --> 00:31:01.919
we can be feeble-minded, faint-hearted,

00:31:01.919 --> 00:31:04.119
and God says, comfort them.

00:31:04.119 --> 00:31:05.019
How?

00:31:05.019 --> 00:31:06.759
Point them to Jesus.

00:31:06.759 --> 00:31:09.040
Use the word of God.

00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:11.299
You know, that reminds us of how important it is

00:31:11.299 --> 00:31:13.559
that we know God's word,

00:31:13.559 --> 00:31:17.279
because as we know God's word, we're able to help others.

00:31:17.279 --> 00:31:18.639
You know, there are times in your life

00:31:18.639 --> 00:31:20.540
that you do as David did,

00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:22.680
that you have to encourage yourself in the Lord.

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:24.779
Have you ever been there before?

00:31:24.779 --> 00:31:25.879
You have to encourage yourself in the Lord.

00:31:25.879 --> 00:31:27.279
You better know God's word

00:31:27.339 --> 00:31:29.839
and encourage yourself in the Lord, amen?

00:31:29.839 --> 00:31:31.799
Because God uses his word.

00:31:31.799 --> 00:31:33.479
Come alongside them.

00:31:33.479 --> 00:31:34.419
Pray with them.

00:31:35.419 --> 00:31:37.419
Just spend some time with them.

00:31:37.419 --> 00:31:38.579
Encourage them.

00:31:38.579 --> 00:31:40.139
Comfort them.

00:31:40.139 --> 00:31:41.379
You know, sometimes,

00:31:42.419 --> 00:31:45.959
that one that is feeble-minded,

00:31:45.959 --> 00:31:48.379
who's faint-hearted, of little soul,

00:31:48.379 --> 00:31:52.559
lacks confidence, struggles to continue,

00:31:52.559 --> 00:31:53.860
times of difficulty,

00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:55.799
they're ready to just kind of give up.

00:31:56.779 --> 00:32:00.519
You know, sometimes, those that are easily discouraged,

00:32:00.519 --> 00:32:03.459
sometimes it's easy for us to just kind of

00:32:03.459 --> 00:32:05.259
maybe not spend some time with them.

00:32:06.299 --> 00:32:09.239
I hate to say it, but almost ignore them,

00:32:09.239 --> 00:32:11.800
because maybe the type of investment or work

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:13.779
that it might require,

00:32:13.779 --> 00:32:14.899
but they need comfort.

00:32:16.099 --> 00:32:18.039
You may comfort someone today,

00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:21.979
and you might need someone to comfort you tomorrow.

00:32:22.839 --> 00:32:25.860
But we better be mindful of that.

00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:27.839
You might comfort someone today,

00:32:28.699 --> 00:32:31.300
but you might need someone to comfort you tomorrow.

00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:34.539
I know it's a messianic psalm,

00:32:34.539 --> 00:32:37.099
but David says this.

00:32:37.099 --> 00:32:38.880
It's a psalm of David,

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:41.880
obviously applicable with the understanding

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:42.759
of the messianic psalm,

00:32:42.759 --> 00:32:45.220
but I want to read to you what David would say

00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:47.319
in Psalm 69 and verse 20.

00:32:48.739 --> 00:32:49.580
He says that,

00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:51.259
every reproach hath broken my heart,

00:32:51.259 --> 00:32:53.139
I am full of heaviness,

00:32:53.139 --> 00:32:55.860
and I looked for some to take pity,

00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:57.660
but there was none,

00:32:57.660 --> 00:32:59.899
and for comforters,

00:32:59.899 --> 00:33:01.080
but I found none.

00:33:02.279 --> 00:33:04.020
You know, I hope that that would never be said

00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:06.800
of a local congregation.

00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:08.500
There's someone that,

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:09.339
man, they're just,

00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:11.239
they're just facing it.

00:33:11.239 --> 00:33:13.220
They're just dealing with some real great trials

00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:14.139
and difficulties,

00:33:14.139 --> 00:33:16.660
and man, they're just faint of heart.

00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:17.639
They're just struggling.

00:33:17.639 --> 00:33:18.940
They're discouraged.

00:33:20.539 --> 00:33:22.139
Comfort them.

00:33:22.139 --> 00:33:23.860
Comfort them.

00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:25.899
Understand that God is the one

00:33:25.899 --> 00:33:27.179
that's the God of all comfort.

00:33:27.179 --> 00:33:28.139
Ultimately, what are we doing?

00:33:28.139 --> 00:33:29.660
We're pointing them to Jesus.

00:33:31.739 --> 00:33:33.059
But Paul says,

00:33:34.339 --> 00:33:36.339
when I was overwhelmed,

00:33:36.339 --> 00:33:38.339
I mean, all these things were happening,

00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:43.099
God comforted me by sending Titus.

00:33:43.099 --> 00:33:45.099
Praise the Lord.

00:33:45.099 --> 00:33:46.699
And this evening,

00:33:46.699 --> 00:33:47.739
make me a blessing.

00:33:47.779 --> 00:33:50.099
That's how we started out the service.

00:33:50.099 --> 00:33:52.899
Man, be aware of those around you

00:33:52.899 --> 00:33:55.179
that are within the congregation,

00:33:55.179 --> 00:33:56.220
but even without,

00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:58.220
just those that are struggling.

00:33:58.220 --> 00:33:59.899
I remember someone told me this years ago,

00:33:59.899 --> 00:34:01.220
and I'll end with this.

00:34:03.059 --> 00:34:07.179
If you preach to a people that are heavy-hearted,

00:34:07.179 --> 00:34:09.020
you'll never lack for an audience,

00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:12.580
and I understand what they meant by it,

00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:14.300
because man that is born of woman

00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:17.139
is a few days and full of trouble.

00:34:17.139 --> 00:34:18.059
We have difficulties.

00:34:18.059 --> 00:34:19.899
We have an enemy who's active.

00:34:21.179 --> 00:34:22.980
And again, that tool that he goes to

00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:24.019
over and over and over

00:34:24.019 --> 00:34:26.019
is the tool of discouragement.

00:34:26.019 --> 00:34:28.019
He wants to discourage you this evening.

00:34:29.220 --> 00:34:30.540
Maybe you say, man, I am.

00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:31.380
I'm discouraged.

00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:32.220
I'm faint of heart.

00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:33.579
I'm just dealing with it.

00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:37.220
Be comforted of God.

00:34:37.220 --> 00:34:39.299
Let someone comfort you.

00:34:39.299 --> 00:34:40.540
You know, sometimes what happens,

00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:41.380
we're kind of in it.

00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:42.739
We want to have a pity party.

00:34:43.859 --> 00:34:45.700
Maybe we resist the comfort

00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:47.100
that God's sending to us,

00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:49.179
because we just want to kind of

00:34:49.179 --> 00:34:51.660
be in that pity party.

00:34:51.660 --> 00:34:52.859
No, no.

00:34:52.859 --> 00:34:53.940
Be comforted.

00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:55.339
Be encouraged.

00:34:55.339 --> 00:34:56.899
Comfort the feeble-minded.

00:34:56.899 --> 00:34:57.739
Let's pray.

00:34:57.739 --> 00:34:58.700
Father, we love you.

00:34:58.700 --> 00:34:59.739
We thank you for loving us.

00:34:59.739 --> 00:35:02.139
Thank you for the truth of your word.

00:35:02.139 --> 00:35:04.139
God, I pray that you would help us

00:35:05.179 --> 00:35:08.059
to be aware of the needs of others.

00:35:08.059 --> 00:35:11.540
Lord, help us to be willing to

00:35:13.179 --> 00:35:15.100
invest in the lives of others,

00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:18.859
to comfort those that might be faint of heart.

00:35:18.859 --> 00:35:21.179
Lord, those that are struggling

00:35:21.179 --> 00:35:25.299
with great difficulties and adversities.

00:35:25.299 --> 00:35:27.220
Lord, I pray that you would help us

00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:29.940
to point them to Jesus.

00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:31.619
God, I pray that you'd bless our time of prayer.

00:35:31.619 --> 00:35:34.059
We thank you that you're a God who hears and answers.

00:35:34.059 --> 00:35:35.059
We pray that you'd bless,

00:35:35.059 --> 00:35:36.019
and we'll thank you for it.

00:35:36.019 --> 00:35:37.779
In Christ's name we pray.

00:35:37.779 --> 00:35:38.619
Amen.

00:35:38.619 --> 00:35:39.459
Does anyone need a prayer bulletin?

00:35:39.459 --> 00:35:40.859
You didn't get one on your way in?

00:35:40.859 --> 00:35:41.700
You need one?

00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:42.859
Anyone?

00:35:42.859 --> 00:35:44.220
Start at the back with me,

00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:45.059
and the help.
