WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
live as we continue with the subject matter of sound doctrine, and this evening we will

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.680
look at the subject matter of the Trinity. In fact, if you are taking notes, it's simply

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.040
titled the message this evening, The Trinity, and we'll look at a number of verses of

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:22.219
Scripture. We'll be in both the Old and New Testament this evening, and the Trinity

00:00:22.219 --> 00:00:29.760
is a scriptural reality that is of significant importance this evening. Many of us are very

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.000
much aware of the fact that there are many that would attack this teaching. With that

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.959
knowledge that there are many today that are attacking the reality and the Bible truth

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:47.319
of the Trinity, it makes it that much more important that we study the subject matter

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:52.360
and that we are well grounded. Remember, we are to be settled and grounded in the truth

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.520
and the faith, and we understand that there are many that have come, false teachers and

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:03.720
so on and so forth, and that is why it's important for us to study doctrine and to be sound in

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:10.040
doctrine and that we would not be tossed to and fro. This evening, as we think about the

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:17.040
subject matter of the Trinity, we must remember that our God transcends us, and that our understanding

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:25.279
is limited, yet He is the infinite God, and even over the last couple of weeks as we've

00:01:25.279 --> 00:01:30.360
studied not only the attributes of God but the names of God, we have stood in awe of

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.480
who our God is and the way in which He has made Himself known to us, and what a tremendous

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:42.080
blessing that is. Look here in 1 John 5 and verse number 7. The Bible says this,

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:49.080
For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, of course that's referring

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:54.599
to Jesus Christ. The beginning was the Word, the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:58.319
The Word was made flesh and dwelt among us, and so we know that one of the names of Jesus

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:03.360
is the Word, and so we see here that the Bible says there are three that bear record in heaven,

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:10.360
the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, and these three are one. We use the word Trinity,

00:02:12.279 --> 00:02:19.279
perhaps a word that would be used as well would be a triunity, three in one. We find

00:02:20.279 --> 00:02:27.279
the word used both in Acts and in Romans, the Godhead. You will not find the word Trinity

00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:32.720
or triunity in the Word of God. It's not an English word that you'll find in your Bible,

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.199
and like matter you will not find the word rapture, and there are some folks that say,

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:41.520
well the word rapture's not there. Yeah, but it means caught up, and we find that in the

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.720
book of 1 Thessalonians that we're to be caught up together in the clouds to meet the Lord

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:51.320
in the air, and so we understand the rapture based upon that teaching and obviously other

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:57.199
portions of Scripture, and this truth with regard to the triunity, the three in one,

00:02:57.199 --> 00:03:04.199
is really found throughout the whole of Scripture. The Bible, no doubt we find that the Bible

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:09.919
reveals this truth, and we accept it by faith. The Bible says that faith cometh by hearing

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:15.600
and hearing by the Word of God, and what a blessing to have the Word of God in its entire

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:22.320
purity, and to have the truth that has been given to us. I suppose this evening that many

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:29.320
that are within our group this evening have heard various analogies that mankind has tried

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:34.880
to kind of come up with to explain the Trinity. I'll say this, and I could use some of those

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:40.600
analogies and try to give it to you this evening, but the reality is that there is no analogy

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:47.720
that sufficiently explains the truth of the Trinity. Why? Because our God transcends us,

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:53.960
and a theologian of yesteryear made this statement, and I thought it was an interesting statement.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:04:00.600
He said, limiting God to our understanding is making ourselves equal to God in understanding.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:06.759
That was a pretty profound truth from a theologian of yesteryear. Let me remind you still as

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:10.679
we think about the kind of introduction to this thought this evening of dealing with

00:04:10.679 --> 00:04:17.559
the Trinity, if you would turn to the book of Romans in the 11th chapter, Romans 11,

00:04:17.559 --> 00:04:21.959
and we visited this portion of Scripture a number of weeks ago as we looked at the attributes

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:28.200
of God and dealt with the omniscience of God, the fact that He has perfect wisdom and all

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.760
knowledge. The Bible says in Romans 11, beginning in verse 33,

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:39.760
O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:48.600
His judgments and His ways past finding out! For who hath known the mind of the Lord? Or

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.720
who hath been His counselor? Or who hath first given to Him, and it shall be recompensed

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.799
unto Him again? For of Him and through Him and to Him are all things, to whom be glory

00:04:59.959 --> 00:05:06.959
forever. Amen. Remember, we've mentioned on a couple of occasions the truth of Psalm 135

00:05:07.119 --> 00:05:12.359
coupled with the truth of Psalm 145, where the psalmist declares, I know that the Lord

00:05:12.359 --> 00:05:19.239
is great. But then he says the greatness of God is unsearchable. And I believe, as I've

00:05:19.239 --> 00:05:24.239
said often, that there is no contradiction between those two statements. The reality

00:05:24.239 --> 00:05:29.320
is that we know our God is great, but His greatness is unsearchable in the fact that

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:36.320
I can't fully comprehend just how great our God is. And this teaching of the Trinity

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:41.760
that we find throughout the Word of God is of utmost importance. You know, things begin

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:46.200
to fall apart if the Trinity were not true, and we'll look at some of those things here

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:52.200
in just a few moments as we get into the study this evening. And so it is an imperative truth

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:56.640
of the Word of God. I will say this also by way of introduction. It's interesting to know

00:05:56.839 --> 00:06:01.279
as we looked at the names of God, and we spent the last two weeks looking at the names of

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:06.079
God, we looked at ten of them all in its entirety. Obviously there are more names that we could

00:06:06.079 --> 00:06:13.079
have looked at, but two of those names that we dealt with are Elohim and Adonai. Elohim

00:06:13.959 --> 00:06:20.279
and Adonai. It's interesting in the Hebrew that both of those words are plural, speaking

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:27.279
about a singular God. In the beginning, God, in Genesis chapter 1, the Hebrew word for

00:06:27.619 --> 00:06:34.619
God is plural, but we find that it's speaking of a singular God. I would not say this evening

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:40.279
that the teaching and really looking at those two nouns, if you will, being the names of

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:47.279
God Elohim and Adonai, that them being plural would prove the Trinity in its entirety, but

00:06:47.279 --> 00:06:52.320
certainly it helps us to understand how that from the beginning of the Word of God and

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:58.440
from the beginning of God's interaction with mankind, He was revealing this truth about

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:03.200
the Trinity. And as you look at progressive revelation, as you look at the fullness of

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:10.200
the Word of God and see how that God revealed all of this truth to us, how we can rejoice

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:16.359
in even the way that God used the names in the beginning of the Word of God. It is interesting

00:07:16.359 --> 00:07:21.239
the word Adonai, as we mentioned, it means Lord or Master, and often in the Old Testament,

00:07:21.239 --> 00:07:25.920
in fact, almost two-thirds of the time that the word is used in the Old Testament, it's

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:32.720
not referring to God, it's referring to a servant-master relationship, a ruler, a king,

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:38.839
something like that. But every time that word is used with dealing with a person, it's always

00:07:38.839 --> 00:07:45.839
singular, Adonai. But when it's referring to God, Adonai, plural. And what a blessing

00:07:46.519 --> 00:07:53.160
to see how that God would reveal this teaching of the Trinity, this truth of the Trinity

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:58.079
in that fashion. By way of introduction, continue, let me look at a few more verses of Scripture

00:07:58.079 --> 00:08:03.880
and then we'll dig into some examples specifically. Look at Deuteronomy chapter 6, if you will.

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:09.399
Deuteronomy chapter number 6 and verse number 4, and this is a very familiar passage of

00:08:09.399 --> 00:08:14.760
Scripture and we find that the children of Israel would have been extremely familiar

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:19.799
with this portion of Scripture. In fact, they would have recited this regularly. In

00:08:19.799 --> 00:08:26.239
Deuteronomy 6 and verse number 4, the Bible says, Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is

00:08:26.239 --> 00:08:33.280
one Lord. We find that in the New Testament, if you look at the truth of the baptism of

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:39.280
Jesus Christ in Matthew chapter number 3, in verses 16 and 17, you'll see the Trinity

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:46.320
there as you see the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Notice in Matthew 3 and verses

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:51.320
16 and 17, the Bible says, And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:56.080
the water. And, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending

00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:02.679
like a dove and lighting upon him. And, lo, a voice from heaven sang, This is my beloved

00:09:02.679 --> 00:09:08.119
Son in whom I am well pleased. Again, if you're mindful of the Great Commission in Matthew

00:09:08.119 --> 00:09:13.039
chapter 28 and verses 18 through 20, the Lord Jesus Christ is speaking and he gives

00:09:13.039 --> 00:09:18.119
the commission to his disciples and he says this, Jesus came and spake unto them, saying,

00:09:18.119 --> 00:09:23.200
All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore and teach all nations,

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:30.200
baptizing them in the, what does it say? Name, right? Singular, in the name of the Father

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:35.239
and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have

00:09:35.239 --> 00:09:40.320
commanded you. And, lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. Amen. And

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:45.520
Paul writes to the believers in Corinth and as he ends the second letter that he sends

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:50.520
to them in 2 Corinthians 13 and verse number 14, the Bible says, The grace of the Lord

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:57.559
Jesus Christ and the love of God and the communion of the Holy Ghost be with you all. Amen.

00:09:57.559 --> 00:10:00.039
We think about the Trinity. It is one triune God.

00:10:00.039 --> 00:10:05.679
coexisting and eternally existing in three persons, God the Father, God the

00:10:05.679 --> 00:10:10.239
Son, and God the Holy Spirit. Let's look at a few Old Testament examples, if you

00:10:10.239 --> 00:10:14.079
will, and let's begin all the way back in Genesis 1 at creation, if you will.

00:10:14.079 --> 00:10:19.919
Genesis chapter number 1, verses 26 and 27, and I want you to notice in each of

00:10:19.919 --> 00:10:24.799
these Old Testament passages that we'll look at, we'll see how that the

00:10:24.799 --> 00:10:31.359
reference is given to the truth of the Trinity, and as you go through

00:10:31.359 --> 00:10:37.599
the Scriptures, you see how that the package is more fully unfolded,

00:10:37.599 --> 00:10:42.599
unpackaged for us, unwrapped for us, so that we can see this teaching and this

00:10:42.599 --> 00:10:47.399
truth of the Trinity. But here in Genesis chapter number 1, in verses 26 and 27, the

00:10:47.399 --> 00:10:59.359
Bible says, and God said, let us make man in our image, after our likeness, and let

00:10:59.359 --> 00:11:02.759
them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and

00:11:02.759 --> 00:11:06.279
over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that

00:11:06.279 --> 00:11:13.639
creepeth upon the earth. So God created man in his own image, and the image of

00:11:13.639 --> 00:11:19.319
God created he him, male and female created he them. And so we look at some

00:11:19.319 --> 00:11:23.799
Old Testament examples, and we start with the creation of man, and we find here in

00:11:23.799 --> 00:11:29.999
our passage of Scripture that God said, let us make man in our image, after our

00:11:29.999 --> 00:11:35.439
likeness. And again, we see in these Old Testament examples how that this

00:11:35.439 --> 00:11:41.759
teaching, this truth, the reality of the Trinity, the triunity, the three-in-one,

00:11:41.759 --> 00:11:47.319
that it is given to us right from the beginning of the Scriptures. The

00:11:47.319 --> 00:11:50.559
Bible tells us not only here in Genesis chapter 1, but another example here in

00:11:50.559 --> 00:11:54.679
the book of Genesis, in chapter 11. Turn over there just a few pages in

00:11:54.679 --> 00:12:00.359
your Bible, and Genesis chapter 11 is the record of the Tower of Babel. You'll be

00:12:00.359 --> 00:12:05.959
mindful through our study of the book of Genesis that not too long ago we looked

00:12:05.959 --> 00:12:11.319
at this passage of Scripture, and we understood that which is taking place in

00:12:11.359 --> 00:12:16.799
the way in which God would confound the languages. And in chapter 11, notice, if

00:12:16.799 --> 00:12:19.799
you will, in verse number 2, it says, and it came to pass as they journeyed from

00:12:19.799 --> 00:12:24.079
the east, they found a plain in the land of Shinar, and they dwelt there. And they

00:12:24.079 --> 00:12:28.239
said one to another, go to, let us make brick, and burned them throughly. And they

00:12:28.239 --> 00:12:32.999
had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar. And God, excuse me, and they

00:12:32.999 --> 00:12:37.119
said, go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach into heaven,

00:12:37.119 --> 00:12:41.119
and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the

00:12:41.119 --> 00:12:47.159
whole earth. And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower which the

00:12:47.159 --> 00:12:51.999
children of men builded. And the Lord said, behold, the people is one, and they

00:12:51.999 --> 00:12:56.479
have all one language, and this they begin to do. And now nothing will be

00:12:56.479 --> 00:13:04.159
restrained from them which they have imagined to do. Go to, let us go down, and

00:13:04.159 --> 00:13:10.519
there confound their languages, that they may not understand one another's speech.

00:13:10.999 --> 00:13:16.119
Again, another instance of this truth being given to us in the Old Testament

00:13:16.119 --> 00:13:20.679
is Isaiah chapter number 6. So you see in Genesis 1, during the creation of man,

00:13:20.679 --> 00:13:24.879
and Genesis chapter 11, the confounding of the languages, and Isaiah chapter

00:13:24.879 --> 00:13:32.119
number 6, the call of Isaiah. The call of Isaiah. Isaiah chapter number 6, and we

00:13:32.119 --> 00:13:36.839
are again familiar with this passage of Scripture. In fact, I referenced it on

00:13:36.879 --> 00:13:41.879
Sunday evening during the message, but we look here in Isaiah chapter number 6,

00:13:41.879 --> 00:13:47.519
and we find that Isaiah sees the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up,

00:13:47.519 --> 00:13:52.239
his train filled the temple. The Bible tells us after these things, this

00:13:52.239 --> 00:13:55.359
interaction, we don't have time for reading all of it. I want to get to some

00:13:55.359 --> 00:13:59.559
things in the New Testament examples here in just a moment, but look at verse

00:13:59.559 --> 00:14:04.959
number 8. Isaiah speaking here, it says, also I heard the voice of the Lord saying,

00:14:04.959 --> 00:14:15.199
whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, here am I, send me. And he

00:14:15.199 --> 00:14:18.319
said, go and tell this people, hear ye indeed, but understand not, and see

00:14:18.319 --> 00:14:23.919
indeed, but perceive not. And so again, we find in verse number 8 of Isaiah 6, this

00:14:23.919 --> 00:14:30.679
reference, this teaching of the Trinity, this revelation to mankind in these

00:14:30.799 --> 00:14:35.039
three examples from the Old Testament, the creation of man, the confounding of

00:14:35.039 --> 00:14:40.959
the languages, and the call of Isaiah, how that the plural us is used in each one

00:14:40.959 --> 00:14:46.879
of those examples. The Lord is speaking, and he says, let us. I don't know about you,

00:14:46.879 --> 00:14:51.439
but if I'm doing something by myself, I don't say let us, let me, right? Because

00:14:51.439 --> 00:14:58.119
it's a singular use of the proper use of language. Occasionally, we will hear

00:14:58.119 --> 00:15:02.479
somebody say something of, hey, we are gonna go do this, and you really

00:15:02.479 --> 00:15:06.679
understand that they are going to go do this, and they're saying we because

00:15:06.679 --> 00:15:12.319
they're expecting you to help them, right? That's why they use the plural we. And so

00:15:12.319 --> 00:15:18.759
we see that God, in each of these examples, is helping us to understand the

00:15:18.759 --> 00:15:25.479
reality of this Bible truth of the Trinity, the triunity, the three-in-one. As

00:15:25.519 --> 00:15:29.239
we go to the New Testament, look at some examples. What I'll do this evening is

00:15:29.239 --> 00:15:34.039
I'll give you the truth in the way in which the each person of the

00:15:34.039 --> 00:15:37.279
Godhead, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, or the Holy Spirit, they're each

00:15:37.279 --> 00:15:44.399
referred to as God. Why? Because they are. Three-in-one. Look at John 17. We'll start

00:15:44.399 --> 00:15:51.079
first with the Father. In John chapter number 17, we often refer to this portion

00:15:51.079 --> 00:15:55.959
of Scripture in John 17 as the Lord's Prayer. We understand that there is a

00:15:55.959 --> 00:16:00.759
model prayer that He gives when the disciples say, teach us to pray. This, in

00:16:00.759 --> 00:16:05.199
fact, is the Lord's Prayer when He's praying before He would go to the cross

00:16:05.199 --> 00:16:09.839
of Calvary. And the Bible says this, these words spake Jesus and lifted up His eyes

00:16:09.839 --> 00:16:14.679
to heaven and said, Father, the hour has come. Glorify Thy Son that Thy Son also

00:16:14.679 --> 00:16:19.439
may glorify Thee. And Thou hast given Him power over all flesh that He should give

00:16:19.439 --> 00:16:23.839
eternal life to as many as Thou hast given Him. And this is life eternal that

00:16:23.839 --> 00:16:30.999
they might know Thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent. I

00:16:30.999 --> 00:16:34.599
have glorified Thee on the earth. I have finished the work which Thou hast given

00:16:34.599 --> 00:16:40.399
me, which Thou gavest me to do. And now, O Father, glorify Thou me with Thine own

00:16:40.399 --> 00:16:47.279
self, with the glory which I had with Thee before the world was. These five

00:16:47.359 --> 00:16:52.399
verses of Scripture are so powerful in helping us to understand a number of

00:16:52.399 --> 00:16:57.279
things about God. Of course, the eternality of Christ is in full view in

00:16:57.279 --> 00:17:01.639
verse number five when He speaks about the fact that He would have, once again,

00:17:01.639 --> 00:17:07.199
the glory that He had with the Father before the world was. And there are those

00:17:07.199 --> 00:17:12.559
that would teach that Jesus is created. No, He is not a created being. He is God.

00:17:12.559 --> 00:17:16.119
And we'll get to that in just a moment, but we find here the eternality of

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:19.839
Christ is in view in verse number five. But we saw in verse number three where

00:17:19.839 --> 00:17:24.839
that Jesus says, and this is life eternal, that they might know Thee, the one true,

00:17:24.839 --> 00:17:30.159
or excuse me, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent. And so the

00:17:30.159 --> 00:17:34.799
Father is the one, remember, in verse number one, as Jesus is praying, He says,

00:17:34.799 --> 00:17:39.439
Father, the hour has come. Glorify Thy Son. And so the Father is referred to as God.

00:17:39.439 --> 00:17:45.479
Why? Because He is. Jesus Christ is referred to as God. Why? Because He is. And

00:17:45.479 --> 00:17:51.719
John chapter number one, a portion of Scripture that I quoted a part of it

00:17:51.719 --> 00:17:55.759
when we looked at first John 5 and verse number 7, it said the Word and how

00:17:55.759 --> 00:17:59.639
that we may note that that's Jesus Christ, a title or a name that is given

00:17:59.639 --> 00:18:03.399
to Him. And John 1 and verse number 1, the Bible says, in the beginning was the

00:18:03.399 --> 00:18:08.879
Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the

00:18:08.879 --> 00:18:12.639
beginning with God. All things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything

00:18:12.839 --> 00:18:17.079
made that was made. If you look in verse number 14, the Bible says, and the Word

00:18:17.079 --> 00:18:22.119
was made flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the

00:18:22.119 --> 00:18:27.199
only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth. And so we see here in

00:18:27.199 --> 00:18:33.119
John chapter number one, that in the beginning was the Word. We know that the

00:18:33.119 --> 00:18:39.079
Word is Jesus Christ, and in verse number one it says, and the Word was God. But not

00:18:39.079 --> 00:18:42.519
only there, I want you to look at a few other examples. Look at Acts chapter

00:18:42.519 --> 00:18:47.599
20, if you will. And Acts chapter number 20, and I'm gonna spend a bulk of time

00:18:47.599 --> 00:18:50.440
here. I've kind of gone quickly this evening, but I want to spend a bulk of

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:55.199
time on this truth, this aspect of the teaching of the Trinity that Jesus is

00:18:55.199 --> 00:19:00.399
God, because that is the most attack thing today. There are a few cults and

00:19:00.399 --> 00:19:08.279
some major world religions that attack the teaching that Jesus is God, and we

00:19:08.279 --> 00:19:12.039
need to understand that this is a very prominent thing that's going on in our

00:19:12.039 --> 00:19:18.679
world today, through the world religions and also through the cults, and we

00:19:18.679 --> 00:19:22.719
need to be grounded and settled, and we need to know what the Word of God says,

00:19:22.719 --> 00:19:29.159
because they will take the scriptures, they'll twist things around, and they can

00:19:29.159 --> 00:19:32.799
get you all kinds of sideways if you're not careful, and that's why we're to be

00:19:32.799 --> 00:19:36.559
settled and grounded in the truth. Look in Acts chapter 20. Contextually, the

00:19:36.559 --> 00:19:40.440
Apostle Paul is speaking to the church leaders from Ephesus, and notice what he

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:42.519
says in verse number 28.

00:19:42.519 --> 00:19:47.999
blood on the cross of Calvary? Jesus Christ. And it says here, it says that

00:19:47.999 --> 00:19:53.879
you would feed the church of God which He hath purchased with His own blood.

00:19:53.879 --> 00:19:57.959
Why is Paul able to say it that way? Because Jesus is God. And there's no

00:19:57.959 --> 00:20:04.559
contradiction whatsoever. Yes, indeed, God in flesh, He died on the cross of

00:20:04.559 --> 00:20:09.719
Calvary to pay for the sin of mankind. Notice in the book of Hebrews, if you

00:20:09.719 --> 00:20:14.159
will, Hebrews chapter number one, we spent much time back in January as we

00:20:14.159 --> 00:20:18.279
started preaching through the book of Hebrews to look at this truth with

00:20:18.279 --> 00:20:25.599
regard to the the Lord Jesus Christ being referred to as God, because He is.

00:20:25.599 --> 00:20:32.359
And in the particular passage, really in verses 5 down through the the end of the

00:20:32.359 --> 00:20:36.959
chapter, He is dealing with the fact that Jesus is superior to the angels. And we

00:20:36.999 --> 00:20:40.759
said many things about that, and we'll mention a few of those this evening as

00:20:40.759 --> 00:20:44.639
well. But notice what it says in verse number 6, and again, when He bringeth in

00:20:44.639 --> 00:20:49.199
the first begotten of the world, He saith, and let all the angels of God worship

00:20:49.199 --> 00:20:55.879
Him. You understand that angels are not worshipped, but Christ is worshipped. Why?

00:20:55.879 --> 00:21:02.879
Because He is God. We find that in verse number 8, it says, but unto the Son He

00:21:02.919 --> 00:21:07.999
saith, this is God the Father speaking as we look at the verse here, but unto the

00:21:07.999 --> 00:21:12.679
Son He saith, thy throne, O God, is forever and ever. A scepter of

00:21:12.679 --> 00:21:17.999
righteousness is the scepter of thy kingdom. And why is God the Father

00:21:17.999 --> 00:21:24.779
referring to the Son as God, O God, forever and ever? Thy throne, O God, is

00:21:24.779 --> 00:21:30.959
forever and ever. Why? Because He is. He's God. We find here, we think about angels

00:21:31.039 --> 00:21:37.239
in the context of Hebrews chapter 1, we find that the angels, in fact, were there

00:21:37.239 --> 00:21:42.679
announcing the birth of Christ, and they're singing the praises in glory to

00:21:42.679 --> 00:21:47.119
God in the highest, and so on and so forth. And we find throughout the Word of

00:21:47.119 --> 00:21:51.319
God that angels are never worshipped. In fact, in the book of Revelation, when

00:21:51.319 --> 00:21:56.439
there's an angel that's giving some of those truths to John, and John's

00:21:56.439 --> 00:22:02.119
ready to worship, he says, no, worship God. Don't worship me. Don't worship an

00:22:02.119 --> 00:22:08.919
angel. You worship God. And so, if we're to worship God, if Jesus is not God, then

00:22:08.919 --> 00:22:12.959
there's a problem in the fact that throughout the gospel records we find

00:22:12.959 --> 00:22:18.959
many examples of Jesus accepting worship. Why would He accept worship? Because He's

00:22:18.959 --> 00:22:24.239
God. Remember when, let me share a couple of examples, and then I'll say that. Look

00:22:24.239 --> 00:22:29.719
in Matthew chapter number 2, if you will. In Matthew chapter number 2, and this is

00:22:29.719 --> 00:22:33.839
a portion of Scripture that we're familiar with during the season that is

00:22:33.839 --> 00:22:39.159
coming near upon us, the Christmas season. And speaking about the birth of our

00:22:39.159 --> 00:22:43.519
Savior in Matthew 2, in verse number 11, it says, when they were coming to the

00:22:43.519 --> 00:22:47.999
house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, fell down and worshipped him.

00:22:48.199 --> 00:22:54.279
And they worshipped Mary, they worshipped him, and remember they asked Herod, where is

00:22:54.279 --> 00:22:58.439
he that is born King of the Jews? In verse number 2, and they worship and they

00:22:58.439 --> 00:23:01.919
present gifts. It says, when they opened their treasures, they presented unto him

00:23:01.919 --> 00:23:06.839
gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh. Look over in chapter number 8 of the

00:23:06.839 --> 00:23:09.519
book of Matthew. We'll just look at a few examples right here in the book of

00:23:09.519 --> 00:23:14.879
Matthew. In chapter number 8, in verse number 1, the Bible says, when he was

00:23:14.879 --> 00:23:18.759
come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him. And behold, there

00:23:18.759 --> 00:23:25.319
came a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me

00:23:25.319 --> 00:23:31.039
clean. Of course, Jesus healed the man, but we find here that Jesus accepted and

00:23:31.039 --> 00:23:36.959
received the worship of this one. In chapter 9, in verse number 18, the Bible

00:23:36.959 --> 00:23:41.039
gives us another example. While he spake these things unto them, behold, there came

00:23:41.039 --> 00:23:45.759
a certain ruler and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even now dead, but

00:23:45.759 --> 00:23:52.039
come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live. There are many other examples

00:23:52.039 --> 00:23:55.359
that we could give you this evening in the gospel records, and I would

00:23:55.359 --> 00:23:59.079
encourage you to read through the Gospels and to take note of the times in

00:23:59.079 --> 00:24:04.559
which Jesus received worship. Why? Because He's God. It was absolutely

00:24:04.559 --> 00:24:10.199
appropriate for them to worship Jesus Christ because Jesus is God. If He was

00:24:10.199 --> 00:24:15.559
not God, He would not have received worship. You know, there was a time in

00:24:15.559 --> 00:24:18.239
which Paul, as he's on a missionary journey, that they were gonna worship

00:24:18.239 --> 00:24:22.959
Paul. They were gonna present offerings. What did Paul do? No, don't do that. I'm

00:24:22.959 --> 00:24:26.999
not. I'm trying to point you to the true living God. If someone came to try to

00:24:26.999 --> 00:24:31.279
worship you, what would you do? Would you let him worship you? I'm not worthy of

00:24:31.279 --> 00:24:36.839
worship, but Jesus is God, and therefore He accepted and He was worshipped. In

00:24:37.199 --> 00:24:40.839
Mark chapter number 2, again, we don't have time to look through the entirety

00:24:40.839 --> 00:24:44.599
of the passage, but I want you to remember what's happening here in Mark

00:24:44.599 --> 00:24:49.759
chapter number 2 and give you some feed for thought, some looking at this

00:24:49.759 --> 00:24:54.999
passage maybe later and studying through it. Jesus is teaching and a great

00:24:54.999 --> 00:24:59.199
group of people are gathered together, and these four want to bring their

00:24:59.199 --> 00:25:03.239
friend that was sick of the palsy. The Bible says that he was born of four. They

00:25:03.239 --> 00:25:05.959
couldn't get in because of how many people. They had to let him down through

00:25:05.959 --> 00:25:11.839
the the roof, and the Bible says that Jesus says to him, look in verse number

00:25:11.839 --> 00:25:17.879
5, when Jesus saw their faith, He said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins

00:25:17.879 --> 00:25:22.319
be forgiven thee. Now, there are people there that were sitting by that were

00:25:22.319 --> 00:25:25.719
observing, some that were there for the right reason, trying to hear Jesus teach

00:25:25.719 --> 00:25:29.159
and wanted to hear the Word. There were others that were there seeking to

00:25:29.159 --> 00:25:33.759
scribes, Pharisees, Sadducees, that were always looking to accuse the Lord Jesus

00:25:33.759 --> 00:25:37.239
Christ of something wrong, and here the Bible says that there were some of the

00:25:37.239 --> 00:25:40.199
scribes. Notice in verse number 6, but there were certain of the scribes

00:25:40.199 --> 00:25:45.879
sitting there and reasoning in their hearts. Why doth this man thus speak

00:25:45.879 --> 00:25:53.839
blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God only? They're right. Only God can forgive

00:25:53.839 --> 00:26:00.679
sins. You know, the priest can't forgive you of any sins, right? There's a whole

00:26:00.679 --> 00:26:06.879
host of people that have been blinded by those false teachings. Only God can

00:26:06.879 --> 00:26:11.799
forgive sins. They're right. Notice what is said here. Immediately when Jesus

00:26:11.799 --> 00:26:14.919
perceived in the Spirit that they had so reasoned within themselves, He said unto

00:26:14.919 --> 00:26:19.759
them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts? Whether is it easier to say to

00:26:19.759 --> 00:26:22.759
the sick of the palsy, Thy sins be forgiven thee, or to say, Arise and take

00:26:22.759 --> 00:26:27.679
up thy bed and walk? But that ye may know that the Son of Man hath power on earth

00:26:27.679 --> 00:26:32.159
to forgive sins. And then He turns to the man that was sick of the palsy. You

00:26:32.159 --> 00:26:34.959
got to see it, you got to understand what's happening. He's talking to these

00:26:34.959 --> 00:26:40.519
scribes that rightfully say, Who can forgive sins but God only? And He

00:26:40.519 --> 00:26:43.239
says this to the scribes, and then He looks to the man that's sick of the

00:26:43.239 --> 00:26:47.839
palsy, and He says to him, Arise, take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house.

00:26:47.839 --> 00:26:55.319
And he arose, and he went. Jesus said in verse number 10 that ye may know that

00:26:55.319 --> 00:27:01.799
the Son of Man hath power on earth to forgive sins. He's God. He's God. We could

00:27:01.799 --> 00:27:06.519
look at a whole host of examples this evening throughout these pages of the

00:27:06.519 --> 00:27:12.519
New Testament and find evidence that Christ is Messiah. We speak about His

00:27:12.519 --> 00:27:16.159
incarnation as deity, and we'll look at some of those things as we transition

00:27:16.159 --> 00:27:19.679
from the doctrine of God theology to the doctrine of Christ, and we'll begin

00:27:19.679 --> 00:27:24.559
looking at that in a couple of weeks. And we will make more mention and more

00:27:24.599 --> 00:27:29.279
reference to these things, but we find that Jesus Christ is God. The teaching of

00:27:29.279 --> 00:27:32.719
the Trinity here in the New Testament, God the Father is referred to as God

00:27:32.719 --> 00:27:37.239
because He is. The Lord Jesus Christ is referred to as God. Why? Because He is. He

00:27:37.239 --> 00:27:42.719
receives worship as God because He is. He mentions about forgiving sins, and what

00:27:42.719 --> 00:27:48.159
a blessing. Notice in Acts chapter number 5, the final reference, remember the

00:27:48.159 --> 00:27:53.159
triunity, the three-in-one, God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. In

00:27:53.159 --> 00:27:59.679
Acts chapter number 5, a portion of Scripture in the early church, there

00:27:59.679 --> 00:28:03.559
were Ananias and Sapphira. They were gonna sell a possession, remember, and

00:28:03.559 --> 00:28:07.679
they had made this agreement amongst themselves. They're gonna hold back a

00:28:07.679 --> 00:28:12.119
portion of what their proceeds were from the sale, but yet they were gonna come in

00:28:12.119 --> 00:28:18.719
and act as if they were gonna give everything. And the reality is that Peter

00:28:18.719 --> 00:28:22.279
deals with them and says, listen, you didn't have to sell it, and even after

00:28:22.279 --> 00:28:25.679
you did, you didn't have to give all of it, but there's an important truth that

00:28:25.679 --> 00:28:31.119
is given here. Again, sometimes we look at maybe the account and the

00:28:31.119 --> 00:28:35.279
circumstances in which we're dealing with in the dialogue, and perhaps we

00:28:35.279 --> 00:28:38.519
could miss some truth. And in verse number 1, it says this, but a certain man

00:28:38.519 --> 00:28:42.879
named Ananias with Sapphira, his wife, sold a possession and kept back a part

00:28:42.879 --> 00:28:46.319
of the price, his wife also being privy to it, and brought a certain part and

00:28:46.319 --> 00:28:52.559
laid it at the apostle's feet. But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine

00:28:52.559 --> 00:28:59.399
heart to lie to the Holy Ghost and to keep back part of the price of the land?

00:28:59.399 --> 00:29:04.479
So according to verse number 3, who did Ananias lie to? The Holy Ghost, the Holy

00:29:04.479 --> 00:29:10.399
Spirit. Verse number 4, while it remained, was it not thine own? And after it was

00:29:10.399 --> 00:29:15.439
sold, was it not in thine own power? Why hast thou conceived this thing in thine

00:29:15.479 --> 00:29:23.919
heart? Thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God. But unto God. Why? Because the

00:29:23.919 --> 00:29:29.839
Holy Spirit is God, right? In verse number 3, Peter says, listen Ananias, Satan has

00:29:29.839 --> 00:29:34.439
filled your heart. He says, why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy

00:29:34.439 --> 00:29:38.119
Ghost? And he goes through and he tells him, listen, you didn't have to sell the

00:29:38.119 --> 00:29:42.159
possession. After you sold it, you didn't have to give all of the proceeds to the

00:29:42.159 --> 00:29:44.439
church.

00:29:44.439 --> 00:29:49.519
but you came as if that's what you did and you didn't lie to man you lied to

00:29:49.519 --> 00:29:57.339
God the Holy Spirit is God and by the way I want you to consider this truth we

00:29:57.339 --> 00:30:00.879
see it here in Acts chapter 5 that the Holy Spirit is the Holy Ghost referred

00:30:00.879 --> 00:30:06.199
to as God be mindful with me in 2nd Timothy chapter number 3 of a great

00:30:06.199 --> 00:30:12.599
truth that we have with regard to the the Word of God the inspiration of God's

00:30:12.599 --> 00:30:18.159
Word in 2nd Timothy 3 in verse number 16 it's a verse that we often quote the

00:30:18.159 --> 00:30:23.639
Bible says all scripture is given by inspiration of God and it's profitable

00:30:23.639 --> 00:30:26.839
for doctrine for a proof for correction for instruction and righteousness that

00:30:26.839 --> 00:30:31.239
the man of God may be perfect throughly furnished unto all good works now we

00:30:31.239 --> 00:30:36.199
understand inspiration God breathed we understand that this book is God's Word

00:30:36.199 --> 00:30:41.919
to man and what a blessing that is I am so thankful for the Word of God Peter

00:30:41.919 --> 00:30:48.679
says this in 2nd Peter chapter number 1 in verses 19 through 21 and again

00:30:48.679 --> 00:30:53.359
there's no contradiction because the Holy Spirit the Holy Ghost is God and

00:30:53.359 --> 00:30:58.119
notice in verse number 19 Peter says we have also a more sure word of prophecy

00:30:58.119 --> 00:31:01.999
where unto you do well that you take heed as into a light that shineth in a

00:31:01.999 --> 00:31:06.119
dark place until the day dawn and the day star rise in your hearts knowing

00:31:06.119 --> 00:31:09.879
this first that no prophecy of the scriptures of any private interpretation

00:31:09.879 --> 00:31:14.399
for the prophecy came not an old time by the will of man but holy men of God

00:31:14.399 --> 00:31:21.919
spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost and we understand as we would read

00:31:21.919 --> 00:31:27.439
this portion of Scripture that the the Holy Spirit would lead these men again

00:31:27.439 --> 00:31:31.959
everything that Paul wrote or said wasn't Scripture but when he was

00:31:31.959 --> 00:31:36.439
speaking when he was writing Scripture of course the Holy Ghost would move upon

00:31:36.439 --> 00:31:40.079
him the Holy Spirit of God and all Scripture is given by inspiration of God

00:31:40.079 --> 00:31:44.319
and when we think about that truth this evening if the Holy Spirit the Holy

00:31:44.319 --> 00:31:48.319
Ghost moved upon men and obviously referring to the Old Testament writings

00:31:48.319 --> 00:31:53.159
here contextually and of course the entirety of the Word of God the question

00:31:53.159 --> 00:31:57.719
would be if the Holy Spirit is not God then how would we say that this is the

00:31:57.719 --> 00:32:03.079
Word of God the Holy Spirit's not God but he is God and so therefore there's

00:32:03.079 --> 00:32:07.319
no contradiction for us to say that this is the Word of God all Scripture is

00:32:07.319 --> 00:32:11.919
given by inspiration of God and oh by the way the operation of that the

00:32:11.919 --> 00:32:15.919
outworking of how that happened was that the Holy Ghost came upon men and they

00:32:15.919 --> 00:32:22.759
spoke and that was the Word of God why because the Holy Spirit is God and so

00:32:22.759 --> 00:32:26.519
this evening as we think about the subject of the Trinity it's an important

00:32:26.519 --> 00:32:30.999
subject matter it's an important scriptural reality and it is important

00:32:30.999 --> 00:32:36.199
for us as we look at the truth of the Trinity to really understand and grasp

00:32:36.199 --> 00:32:40.919
it to the best of our ability understanding that God has given the

00:32:40.919 --> 00:32:47.239
truth in his Word and we accept it by faith and we we trust that what God has

00:32:47.239 --> 00:32:52.439
given us and how he has revealed this truth to us that we can claim it by

00:32:52.439 --> 00:32:57.519
faith understanding that that he transcends us that my understanding is

00:32:57.839 --> 00:33:04.399
finite and he is an infinite God and we can rejoice in the fact that he is great

00:33:04.399 --> 00:33:09.879
but yet his greatness is unsearchable and his ways are past finding out but to

00:33:09.879 --> 00:33:14.159
understand this evening that this teaching of the Trinity listen there are

00:33:14.159 --> 00:33:17.719
some that would try to attack the the teaching of the Trinity I've mentioned

00:33:17.719 --> 00:33:21.399
that by way of introduction the reason why it's important that we study it

00:33:21.399 --> 00:33:24.999
there were some that would try to say well it was this is just a teaching that

00:33:24.999 --> 00:33:29.799
was introduced by some theologian in some particular year so on and so forth

00:33:29.799 --> 00:33:33.359
I showed you this evening starting all the way back in Genesis how that this is

00:33:33.359 --> 00:33:38.839
a Bible truth this is not something that some theologian or some some religious

00:33:38.839 --> 00:33:44.519
organization came up with and just began to to teach at some point no I'm pretty

00:33:44.519 --> 00:33:49.759
confident as I read the Word of God to see how that even in the Old Testament

00:33:49.759 --> 00:33:55.479
that God was revealing through the use of Elohim and Adonai and then also the

00:33:55.479 --> 00:34:01.319
use of let us make man in our image let us go down and confound their languages

00:34:01.319 --> 00:34:06.199
who will go for us that God was revealing even the Old Testament this

00:34:06.199 --> 00:34:11.799
truth this reality of the Trinity and then we see with the progressive

00:34:11.799 --> 00:34:17.239
revelation how that we get the New Testament and Jesus Messiah comes and he

00:34:17.239 --> 00:34:24.159
shows he shows that he is God how he receives worship he forgives sin the

00:34:24.159 --> 00:34:29.399
attributes of God that that are given in the Old Testament you'll see him in the

00:34:29.399 --> 00:34:33.079
New Testament through the person of Christ you'll see his power you'll see

00:34:33.079 --> 00:34:38.039
the names in the book of Revelation when you begin to read the first few chapters

00:34:38.039 --> 00:34:42.319
the book of Revelation you begin to see how that names are ascribed to Jesus

00:34:42.319 --> 00:34:46.199
then in the Old Testament are given to God the Father there's no contradiction

00:34:46.199 --> 00:34:52.319
why Jesus is God and so when we understand the biblical reality of the

00:34:52.319 --> 00:34:58.199
scriptural truth and we're grounded and settled on it these cults that want to

00:34:58.199 --> 00:35:03.799
deny that Jesus is God these religions of the world that want to deny that

00:35:03.799 --> 00:35:08.999
Jesus is God we must stand upon the truth of the Word of God and I would

00:35:08.999 --> 00:35:13.839
submit to you this but Paul says in 1st Corinthians 2 in verse number 14 the

00:35:13.839 --> 00:35:18.079
natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God for their foolishness

00:35:18.079 --> 00:35:22.039
unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned

00:35:22.039 --> 00:35:28.679
and I'm so thankful that God has revealed himself to us in his Word and

00:35:28.679 --> 00:35:34.919
he's given us this truth of the Trinity and what a blessing it is to know that

00:35:34.919 --> 00:35:41.319
God the Father God the Son and God the Holy Spirit three in one tri unity or

00:35:41.479 --> 00:35:46.439
Trinity as we often refer to it as let's pray this evening father we love you

00:35:46.439 --> 00:35:50.159
we're so thankful for your word we're so thankful for the truth that is contained

00:35:50.159 --> 00:35:55.039
therein and Lord as we study this passage or these passages of Scripture

00:35:55.039 --> 00:35:59.399
this evening with this subject matter of the Trinity I pray that our faith has

00:35:59.399 --> 00:36:04.999
been strengthened I pray that we've been grounded even more secure in the faith

00:36:04.999 --> 00:36:09.719
God we know that there are false teachers we are aware of cults today

00:36:09.719 --> 00:36:15.559
that would teach that Jesus was created that would teach blasphemous things

00:36:15.559 --> 00:36:20.879
about our Savior Jesus Christ and God we know that as we study your word that

00:36:20.879 --> 00:36:25.519
this was not some teaching that originated with some religious

00:36:25.519 --> 00:36:31.119
organization or some individual theologian at some date in recent

00:36:31.119 --> 00:36:35.519
history but this this is a Bible truth we go all the way back to the pages of

00:36:35.519 --> 00:36:39.559
Genesis and we see how that you were revealing this to your people and God I

00:36:39.639 --> 00:36:45.639
pray that you'd help us as we perhaps come into contact with some or have some

00:36:45.639 --> 00:36:49.559
that would attack our faith or our belief that we would be able to stand

00:36:49.559 --> 00:36:54.839
firm upon the truth of your word plus bless our time of prayer again we thank

00:36:54.839 --> 00:36:58.079
you for the privilege I pray that you be honored and glorified through all that

00:36:58.079 --> 00:37:03.399
said and done for it's in Christ's name we pray amen if you do not have a prayer

00:37:03.399 --> 00:37:06.519
bulletin we can get
