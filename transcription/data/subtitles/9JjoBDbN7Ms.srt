1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,039
This morning, that was a blessing.

2
00:00:01,039 --> 00:00:02,960
1 Timothy chapter number two,

3
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,239
this morning, 1 Timothy chapter number two.

4
00:00:05,239 --> 00:00:07,159
I know that we've been preaching

5
00:00:07,159 --> 00:00:08,500
through the book of 1 John,

6
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:09,840
and we will get back there,

7
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,640
Lord willing, next Sunday.

8
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,539
But I wanna preach a message this morning.

9
00:00:13,539 --> 00:00:15,439
If you'd looked at the back of the bulletin already,

10
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:16,840
you see the title this morning,

11
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,760
the place of prayer in our lives.

12
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,440
The place of prayer in our lives.

13
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,959
We think about the subject of prayer.

14
00:00:24,959 --> 00:00:26,920
In fact, I've said this before.

15
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,879
It's a lot easier for me to talk about prayer,

16
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:30,760
and it's a lot easier for me to preach about prayer

17
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,479
than it is for me to actually pray.

18
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,639
And the reality is that prayer is work.

19
00:00:36,639 --> 00:00:39,959
And as we think about the place of prayer in our lives,

20
00:00:39,959 --> 00:00:40,959
obviously, as you know,

21
00:00:40,959 --> 00:00:42,959
and I shared with you just a little bit

22
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:46,380
of starting our services with a season of prayer,

23
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,919
and I've just thoroughly enjoyed it.

24
00:00:47,919 --> 00:00:49,360
I think it's appropriate.

25
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,759
And I hope that this message this morning

26
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:54,319
will give you a little bit more insight

27
00:00:54,319 --> 00:00:56,880
as to why I believe that it's so necessary,

28
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,959
and really ask the Lord to forgive me

29
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:03,040
for not having prayer as a more prominent place

30
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,400
in our services,

31
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,519
and understanding the importance of prayer.

32
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:09,519
And before we dive into the text of scripture

33
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:12,000
here in 1 Timothy chapter number two this morning,

34
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,480
I wanna give you just a little bit of remind us, really,

35
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,959
of just some foundational truths,

36
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:18,739
as I'll refer to them as,

37
00:01:18,739 --> 00:01:21,519
with regard to the subject matter of prayer.

38
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:22,839
Some foundational truths.

39
00:01:22,839 --> 00:01:23,919
And I think it's important for us

40
00:01:23,919 --> 00:01:26,080
to understand these foundational truths

41
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,080
as we get into the message this morning.

42
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,559
And let me say this, right at the beginning,

43
00:01:29,559 --> 00:01:32,279
we're living in an evil day.

44
00:01:32,279 --> 00:01:35,199
We are living in the last days,

45
00:01:35,199 --> 00:01:37,879
as they're described by Paul,

46
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:39,199
as he's writing to Timothy

47
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:40,879
in 2 Timothy chapter number three.

48
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:44,319
He speaks about the evil days, the last days,

49
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:45,599
the perilous times.

50
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:47,680
He describes all that's taking place.

51
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,080
And I received an email just on Friday,

52
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,279
and the question in the email,

53
00:01:51,279 --> 00:01:52,279
it was not from anyone.

54
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:55,000
It was a mass mailing type of an email.

55
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,879
But the question in the subject line was this,

56
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:58,400
are we living in the last days?

57
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,879
And it's like, if you have to ask the question,

58
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:02,860
I'm not sure where we're going here, right?

59
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:05,599
Because obviously, if you know anything

60
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:07,580
about that phrase, last days,

61
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:10,800
we are absolutely living in the last days.

62
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,000
And we find that in these evil days,

63
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,119
in these last days, that we need strength.

64
00:02:17,979 --> 00:02:22,160
We need strength to stand in an evil day.

65
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,479
And the reality is that that strength

66
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:27,039
is not gonna come by your willpower.

67
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:30,399
It's not gonna come by your physical power.

68
00:02:30,399 --> 00:02:33,199
The strength to stand in the evil day

69
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:37,279
is going to be a result of prayer power.

70
00:02:37,279 --> 00:02:38,759
And the reality this morning is that

71
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:40,360
in Ephesians chapter number six,

72
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,080
as God is giving to the believers in Ephesus,

73
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,339
to us by way of preservation,

74
00:02:46,339 --> 00:02:48,440
the whole armor of God,

75
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,960
he concludes the section by speaking

76
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,759
about the importance of prayer.

77
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:55,559
In verse number 18 of Ephesians six,

78
00:02:55,559 --> 00:02:56,559
you can look at it later,

79
00:02:56,559 --> 00:02:58,360
and you can see that he emphasizes

80
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,960
after he goes through all of the armor

81
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,479
and putting on the whole armor of God,

82
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:05,119
he talks about praying always

83
00:03:05,119 --> 00:03:06,479
in the importance of prayer.

84
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:09,360
We understand that the church in Thessalonica

85
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,279
is told pray without ceasing.

86
00:03:11,279 --> 00:03:13,960
We understand that our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ,

87
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,880
he prayed often.

88
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,800
But I want you to consider with me this morning

89
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,800
as we think about some foundational truth

90
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,559
with regard to prayer,

91
00:03:21,559 --> 00:03:22,800
I would say this.

92
00:03:22,839 --> 00:03:24,720
We must be mindful of the fact

93
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,679
that an invitation has been extended.

94
00:03:27,679 --> 00:03:29,800
Prayer is the unique privilege

95
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,119
that is reserved for the child of God.

96
00:03:32,119 --> 00:03:36,080
God Almighty has extended an invitation

97
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,759
to you and to me and to every one of his people

98
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:42,360
to enter into his presence.

99
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,199
What a great invitation.

100
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:47,639
Remember the words that he spoke to Jeremiah

101
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:48,960
in Jeremiah 33,

102
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,000
call unto me.

103
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,399
Right, isn't that wonderful?

104
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,360
This invitation that the God of the universe,

105
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,399
God Almighty, my heavenly Father,

106
00:03:58,399 --> 00:04:00,160
he says call unto me.

107
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,119
And then he says this,

108
00:04:01,119 --> 00:04:04,360
and I will answer thee.

109
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,600
Isn't that precious?

110
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,440
And show thee great and mighty things

111
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,880
which thou knowest not.

112
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,320
Consider the words of Jesus in Matthew 7.

113
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:16,119
He says, ask and it shall be given unto you.

114
00:04:16,119 --> 00:04:18,279
Seek and ye shall find.

115
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,679
Knock and it shall be opened unto you

116
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,239
for everyone that asketh receiveth.

117
00:04:23,239 --> 00:04:24,359
Do you remember what James says?

118
00:04:24,359 --> 00:04:27,440
You have not because you ask not.

119
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,279
He also says you have not because you ask amidst.

120
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:32,320
But I want you to think about what Jesus says.

121
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,640
For everyone that asketh receiveth

122
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,559
and he that seeketh findeth

123
00:04:36,559 --> 00:04:39,040
and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.

124
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,799
Notice the analogy that he uses

125
00:04:40,799 --> 00:04:42,760
or what man is there of you

126
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,000
whom if his son ask bread,

127
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,480
will he give him a stone?

128
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,720
Now not one among us.

129
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,600
Amen?

130
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,320
In fact, even if it's not your son,

131
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,279
but he uses that analogy,

132
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:55,640
but if somebody comes to you and ask for bread,

133
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,040
you're not gonna give him a stone.

134
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,440
He says, or if he ask a fish,

135
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,760
will he give him a serpent?

136
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,839
No.

137
00:05:03,239 --> 00:05:05,480
No, that's not how we'd respond.

138
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,320
And notice the powerful truth.

139
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,399
If ye then, being evil,

140
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:15,600
know how to give good gifts unto your children,

141
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,480
how much more?

142
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,040
How much more?

143
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,200
Let those words sing, how much more

144
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,239
shall your Father which is in heaven

145
00:05:26,239 --> 00:05:31,239
give good things to them that ask him?

146
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:35,079
He said, ask, ask,

147
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:37,160
and it shall be given you.

148
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,040
Isn't that precious?

149
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,839
This invitation that's been extended.

150
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:43,519
I know that I've said to my children,

151
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:45,519
if you need help, just ask.

152
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:47,679
Perhaps you've said that to your children.

153
00:05:47,679 --> 00:05:49,119
Perhaps you've said it to a spouse

154
00:05:49,119 --> 00:05:50,040
or maybe to someone else.

155
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,760
You say, just ask, how often, however,

156
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,880
do we observe people that do not ask for help

157
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,559
and struggle to complete the task?

158
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:00,920
Why?

159
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,760
Because they don't wanna ask for help.

160
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,320
Whether it's because of pride,

161
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,720
whether it's because they don't wanna inconvenience you.

162
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,559
Has anyone ever said to you,

163
00:06:07,559 --> 00:06:08,519
well, I didn't ask you for help

164
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:10,519
because I didn't wanna inconvenience you.

165
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:11,720
Anyone ever say that to you?

166
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,959
I've been told that.

167
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:16,279
Can I tell you, you can't inconvenience God.

168
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:17,239
Amen?

169
00:06:17,239 --> 00:06:18,799
It is impossible.

170
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,519
The Bible tells us that he is a very present help

171
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:23,959
in the time of trouble.

172
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:26,239
The reality of God's word is that God

173
00:06:26,239 --> 00:06:29,119
is not only available to help us,

174
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:31,119
but he is able to help us.

175
00:06:31,119 --> 00:06:34,200
And when you combine those two truths,

176
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,440
it is so powerful because he's always available

177
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,920
and he's always able.

178
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,320
He said, ask.

179
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,600
He said, call unto me in invitation.

180
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,799
I want you to understand that God's given us

181
00:06:44,799 --> 00:06:47,839
many promises in his word with regard to prayer.

182
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,720
We find that throughout the Psalms,

183
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,160
the Psalmist regularly records

184
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,279
and speaks about how the Lord heard him,

185
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:58,079
how the Lord heard my cry,

186
00:06:58,079 --> 00:06:59,839
how the Lord heard my prayer.

187
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:02,200
And you think about the joy of that

188
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,640
and you think about the reality that God says,

189
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:08,720
if you call, if you ask, that I will respond.

190
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,200
He gave us this promise in Ephesians three

191
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,119
that he's able to do exceeding abundantly above

192
00:07:14,119 --> 00:07:16,160
all that we ask or think.

193
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,519
We're familiar with the truth

194
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:20,399
of Hebrews chapter number four and verse number 16

195
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:22,640
when he says that we're to come boldly

196
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,559
under the throne of grace.

197
00:07:24,559 --> 00:07:27,040
You think about that picture in your mind,

198
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,200
understanding that Jesus as our great high priest,

199
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,200
that he's provided that access

200
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,880
and that now you and I have the privilege

201
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,600
of going boldly under the throne of grace

202
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,799
that we may obtain mercy and find grace

203
00:07:41,799 --> 00:07:43,320
to help in time of need.

204
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,000
Think about this promise from the book

205
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,959
that we've been studying and we're not there yet

206
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:48,799
because it's first John chapter number five,

207
00:07:48,799 --> 00:07:51,839
but in first John five and verse number 14,

208
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:55,079
notice the way that it says this truth that says,

209
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:58,799
and this is the confidence that we have in him.

210
00:07:58,799 --> 00:08:01,519
Now I like being confident, don't you?

211
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:03,440
We have confidence, let me tell you this,

212
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,000
your confidence in Christ is never going to waver

213
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,880
from the perspective of him failing you.

214
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,239
Now, whether you have confidence in him or not

215
00:08:13,239 --> 00:08:15,720
is another story, but the reality is that

216
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,399
we can trust him.

217
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:19,799
Great is thy faithfulness, amen?

218
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:22,760
He is trustworthy, he is dependable,

219
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,000
and we find that he says the,

220
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,320
and this is the confidence that we have in him

221
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:33,320
that if we ask anything according to his will,

222
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,719
he heareth us.

223
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:38,119
Doesn't that encourage your heart this morning?

224
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:42,520
I mean, when you consider the invitation

225
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,760
that's been extended, when you consider the promises

226
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,799
that God has given us in his word,

227
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:48,880
as we think about these foundational truths,

228
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,520
I want you to consider answered prayer,

229
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,559
the testimonies throughout the word of God

230
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:53,520
of answered prayer.

231
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,599
Listen, answered prayer ought to encourage us.

232
00:08:56,599 --> 00:08:59,400
It ought to drive us to our knees more often

233
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,840
because we know that our God hears and answers prayer.

234
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:06,479
I think about, you could fill in the blanks this morning.

235
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:08,840
You can think about all of those that have gone before us,

236
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,479
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and I mean,

237
00:09:11,479 --> 00:09:14,080
you just start thinking about Moses and Joshua,

238
00:09:14,119 --> 00:09:17,280
and you think about Daniel and David and Isaiah,

239
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,640
and I mean, you just start naming all these people of God

240
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,520
that they heard from God, they prayed,

241
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,400
they saw the face of God, and God answered.

242
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,679
Paul, Peter, John.

243
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:35,119
I mean, we just go on and on.

244
00:09:35,119 --> 00:09:38,479
And think about all of the records that we have

245
00:09:38,479 --> 00:09:41,799
in the Bible that record for us

246
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:46,039
the way in which prayer was heard and prayer was answered.

247
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:48,919
You remember Elijah, he prayed.

248
00:09:50,239 --> 00:09:54,919
In fact, the example is used by James

249
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:57,640
when he speaks about the effectual fervent prayer

250
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,280
of a righteous man availeth much,

251
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,479
he uses the example of the righteous man.

252
00:10:01,479 --> 00:10:09,599
example of Elijah praying in the Old Testament. Elisha prayed. Hezekiah prayed. And as we

253
00:10:09,599 --> 00:10:14,639
read the Word of God and we see all of these testimonies of answered prayer, they all encourage

254
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:21,439
us. When we think about these foundational truths, and as I take a moment to just meditate

255
00:10:21,439 --> 00:10:26,079
upon those foundational truths, I believe that it leads me to a place, and really the

256
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:32,119
message this morning is a place in my life where I'm going to evaluate my own prayer

257
00:10:32,119 --> 00:10:38,119
life. And I'm going to, with the help of God, seek to determine the place of prayer in my

258
00:10:38,119 --> 00:10:45,839
life. I'm not asking you this morning to evaluate the place of prayer in my life. I'm not asking

259
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:50,679
you this morning to evaluate the place of prayer in your neighbor's life, in your spouse's

260
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:55,799
life, in your child's life, in some other member's life. I'm asking each of us this

261
00:10:55,799 --> 00:11:04,759
morning to humbly, before the Lord, to evaluate the place of prayer in our own lives personally.

262
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:09,019
I don't want to evaluate the place of prayer in your life. I want to evaluate the place

263
00:11:09,019 --> 00:11:14,719
of prayer in my life. And as we think about 1 Timothy chapter number 2, I believe that

264
00:11:14,719 --> 00:11:20,679
God provides us with some important truth regarding the place of prayer in our lives.

265
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:24,159
Notice in 1 Timothy chapter number 2, beginning in verse number 1, the Bible says,

266
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:29,719
I exhort, therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks

267
00:11:29,719 --> 00:11:34,559
be made for all men, for kings and for all that are in authority, that we may lead a

268
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:39,499
quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty. For this is good and acceptable

269
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:44,079
in the sight of God our Savior, who will have all men to be saved and to come unto the knowledge

270
00:11:44,119 --> 00:11:49,239
of the truth. For there is one God and one Mediator between God and man, the man Christ

271
00:11:49,239 --> 00:11:56,359
Jesus. Aren't you thankful for that? Notice what he did. He gave himself a ransom for

272
00:11:56,359 --> 00:12:03,359
all to be testified in due time, whereunto I am ordained a preacher and an apostle.

273
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:10,639
I speak the truth in Christ and lie not, a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.

274
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:18,039
I will, therefore, that men pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands without wrath and doubting.

275
00:12:22,719 --> 00:12:27,679
Anytime you read the Word of God and you find that God tells us that something is good and

276
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:31,519
acceptable in His sight, we ought to take note of that. Amen?

277
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,839
And here in this passage of Scripture, we find that very reference in verse number 3,

278
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:41,879
but as we consider this morning some truth from this passage that would help us in this

279
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:47,159
process of evaluation, I would say, number one, that prayer is a priority. Prayer is

280
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:53,159
a priority. Notice what he says in verse number 1, I exhort, therefore, that first of all

281
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:59,199
– note those words – first of all, not second, not third, not last, but first of

282
00:12:59,199 --> 00:13:06,199
all, that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men.

283
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:12,879
There's a priority in our text of Scripture that is placed upon prayer. The reality is

284
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:18,159
that prayer should be my first response and not my last resort. There are times, however,

285
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:22,839
in my life, and if you'd be honest in evaluating your life this morning, that we try all sorts

286
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:26,759
of things to figure it out, and then we come to the place when we say, maybe I should pray

287
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:33,759
about this. But prayer should be our first response. In fact, without turning there,

288
00:13:34,599 --> 00:13:39,639
but in James 5, in verse 13 and 14, in both of those verses, there are questions that

289
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:44,239
are asked. The first one in verse 13, are any afflicted? You know what the answer is?

290
00:13:44,239 --> 00:13:50,079
Let them pray. In verse 14, are any sick? You know what the answer is? Let them pray.

291
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:57,079
Let them call for the elders. I understand the innocence, but let them pray. The response.

292
00:13:57,219 --> 00:14:01,799
Someone said this. I believe it was John R. Rice. He said, all of our problems are prayer

293
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:08,639
problems. Man, that helps us to focus on that priority of prayer. The reality is that I

294
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:15,639
can't preach a message with the power of God if I've not first prayed. Amen? You can't

295
00:14:16,359 --> 00:14:22,959
live the life that you're supposed to live and have that godly testimony in the midst

296
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:27,119
of your home, in the midst of your family, in the midst of your neighbors, in the midst

297
00:14:27,119 --> 00:14:33,879
of your co-workers, without praying. The reality is that we can go and we can try to reach

298
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:40,199
our community and reach the world with the gospel, but we must first pray, because we

299
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:47,199
need the power of God. God has ordained it. We see it all throughout His Word that prayer

300
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:54,839
moves the hand of God. We can argue the finer points and we can ask the questions as to

301
00:14:55,679 --> 00:15:02,679
why that is, but the reality is that we must simply accept that God has set it to be so.

302
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:09,839
That prayer moves the hand of God. That ought to encourage us. We're to pray. We're to pray.

303
00:15:10,239 --> 00:15:15,079
We're to pray about everything. And we're to have prayer as a priority. It's interesting

304
00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:20,919
in the text of Scripture that he says that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions,

305
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:24,959
giving of thanks be made for all men. Notice what he says, for kings and for all that are

306
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:30,759
in authority. Then it says this, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness

307
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:36,799
and honesty. You ever wonder about that verse of Scripture? You know, the reality of we'd

308
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:40,079
be honest this morning with one another, it's a whole lot easier for us to complain

309
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:47,079
about those in authority than it is to pray for them. Amen? I'm talking to myself this

310
00:15:47,439 --> 00:15:54,439
morning. It's a whole lot easier for us to criticize, to complain about those that are

311
00:15:58,279 --> 00:16:04,279
in authority than it is for us to pray for them. But we're to pray for those that are

312
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:09,959
in authority. And then notice what he says, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life

313
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:15,839
in all godliness and honesty. Why? Because God moves and God works. You know the truth

314
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:22,599
of Proverbs 21, a verse of Scripture that we've often referred to over the years and

315
00:16:22,599 --> 00:16:27,919
rightly so, and what powerful truth it is when God gives us this truth with regard to

316
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:34,179
His power. And he says this, that the king's heart is in the hand of the Lord. As the rivers

317
00:16:34,179 --> 00:16:41,179
of water, He, God, turneth it whithersoever He will. Do you believe that? God is able.

318
00:16:42,059 --> 00:16:49,019
You read throughout the book of Ezra and Nehemiah and you can see how God moved the heart of

319
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:56,019
some wicked kings, some ungodly kings, how God moved and how God worked and how God responded

320
00:16:56,899 --> 00:17:03,899
to the prayer of His people. When they're rebuilding, they're praying. Repeatedly you

321
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:10,179
can read of the times of prayer. Oh, there was a work to be done, but they understood

322
00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:15,459
the importance of prayer. This morning, there's a priority that is placed upon prayer. I would

323
00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:22,459
say this, that prayer demonstrates our dependence. When I pray, I'm demonstrating my dependence

324
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:30,339
upon God. Someone said this, that prayer is not an escape from our responsibility. Rather,

325
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:40,059
prayer is our response to God's ability. You know, sometimes we use the phrase and we hear

326
00:17:42,899 --> 00:17:49,899
the phrase used, I'll pray for you, and sometimes we think that's just a discounted response.

327
00:17:50,219 --> 00:17:55,179
But you know the reality is that that's the greatest thing we could do for anyone, is

328
00:17:55,179 --> 00:18:02,179
to pray for them. To pray for them. We find that He says that first of all, prayer is

329
00:18:03,819 --> 00:18:08,939
a priority. Let me say this, prayer is pleasing to our Lord. We find that it says in verse

330
00:18:08,939 --> 00:18:15,939
number three, for this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior. What is good

331
00:18:16,539 --> 00:18:20,899
and acceptable? That we're praying, that we're going to His face, that we're seeking Him.

332
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:24,939
We notice that He says that who will have all men to be saved and come unto the knowledge

333
00:18:24,939 --> 00:18:28,279
of the truth. You know that God is not willing that any should perish, but that all should

334
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:33,139
come to repentance? You know how you and I need to be praying for those that are in authority

335
00:18:33,139 --> 00:18:39,559
that God would save them? You know why those in authority make decisions that we disagree

336
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:46,599
with so often is because they're lost. They're lost people that are operating as lost people.

337
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:54,760
Why should we be surprised by that? We pray for them. We pray for their salvation. That

338
00:18:55,359 --> 00:19:01,359
God would bring someone into their presence, that someone would cross their path that has

339
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:06,639
the boldness and the courage to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ, that the Holy Spirit

340
00:19:06,639 --> 00:19:13,639
of God would work and move as only He can. We pray. We pray for souls to be saved. Notice

341
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:19,959
it says there's one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, and what

342
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:25,440
joy that is. You can go directly to God through the Lord Jesus Christ. You don't need some

343
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:31,599
other person that you go through, and I'm thankful for that reality that tells us how

344
00:19:31,719 --> 00:19:37,559
He gave Himself a ransom for all. I'm thankful that Jesus died in my place and your place

345
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:42,599
and that He rose conquering sin, death, and the grave, that He ever liveth to make intercession

346
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:49,599
for us, that one day, one glorious day, He's coming back. And what a joy that is. And Paul

347
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:55,159
says as he's writing to Timothy, whereunto I am ordained a preacher and apostle. I speak

348
00:19:55,199 --> 00:20:01,199
the truth in Christ and lie not, a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity, faith

349
00:20:01,199 --> 00:20:01,559
and truth.

350
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:07,399
truth, but then notice what Paul says in verse number eight after he's speaking about prayer

351
00:20:07,399 --> 00:20:11,799
in the church and the importance and the priority and the fact that it's pleasing to God. Notice

352
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:20,439
what he says, I will therefore that men pray everywhere lifting up holy hands without wrath

353
00:20:20,439 --> 00:20:25,879
and doubting. Can I tell you this morning that prayer is going to require a plan. You're not

354
00:20:25,879 --> 00:20:34,359
going to pray by accident. You really aren't. I never pray by accident. I just don't. If I just

355
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:39,879
jump into my day and I just get into it and all sorts of things happen and I get emails and text

356
00:20:39,879 --> 00:20:44,839
messages and phone calls and the kind of days that you have and you have so many things going on,

357
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:52,039
the busyness of life, the reality is that if I don't have a time and a purpose and a plan,

358
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:57,959
it gets away from us. And all of a sudden, we look at the clock and we say, man, I haven't

359
00:20:57,959 --> 00:21:03,079
even prayed yet. I haven't had my time with the Lord yet. Then we've got to have a plan.

360
00:21:03,719 --> 00:21:09,479
We've got to make it a priority. This morning, before I ever even, I walked through the front

361
00:21:09,479 --> 00:21:15,239
door this morning from the fellowship hall. It's closer to my house and just joking with you guys,

362
00:21:15,239 --> 00:21:19,000
amen. But I walked through that door. I walked through there so I could take care of a couple

363
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,680
things over there actually. And then before I ever went to my office this morning, I stopped

364
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:28,759
here and prayed. I spent a season in prayer right there this morning. Why? Because once I go to my

365
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:35,959
office, man, there's all kinds of stuff going on. We've got to have a plan. Let me say this.

366
00:21:35,959 --> 00:21:41,879
When we think about this evaluation this morning and we think about the place of prayer in our

367
00:21:41,879 --> 00:21:45,799
lives, I want to look at it from two aspects. All of that really was just introduction.

368
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:49,799
And I know it's our passage of Scripture. It was really just introduction. And some of you say,

369
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:54,519
my notebook's full already. It's 11.20 already. I know. I'll try to keep it brief.

370
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:01,079
From two perspectives, number one, the place of prayer in our lives personally,

371
00:22:02,439 --> 00:22:09,079
personally, each one of us evaluating our own lives. I would ask this question this morning.

372
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:12,839
I've asked it of myself and I would ask you to ask yourself,

373
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:23,000
what words would best describe our prayer life? If we were to honestly evaluate our prayer lives

374
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:29,080
personally in the place of prayer in our lives, what words would best describe it?

375
00:22:31,239 --> 00:22:37,639
I'm not even going to provide you any suggestions. I'd rather you just evaluate and ask the Lord to

376
00:22:37,639 --> 00:22:45,160
help you evaluate. God, how best would my prayer life be described? I want you to turn to the book

377
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:50,039
of Acts, if you will, and I want you to look at an example. The example is of Paul at this

378
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:56,839
particular time, Acts chapter 9. His name is still Saul. But I want you to think about this personally

379
00:22:56,839 --> 00:23:05,239
from this evaluation. What place does prayer have in my life personally? And I want you to think

380
00:23:05,239 --> 00:23:11,319
about the Apostle Paul. I want you to notice in Acts chapter 9, we're familiar with the passage of

381
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:15,800
Scripture and he's journeying. He comes near to Damascus according to verse number three and

382
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:22,679
there's a bright light that shines from heaven. We find that the Lord speaks to him. He hears this

383
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:32,440
voice in verse number four, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? We find that the response is,

384
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:39,639
who art thou, Lord? And then he asked the question after Jesus tells him, I am Jesus whom

385
00:23:39,639 --> 00:23:46,119
thou persecutest. He then says, what wilt thou have me to do? He says, Lord, what wilt thou have

386
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:52,360
me to do? And the Bible tells us in verse number six that the response, the Lord says to him, arise

387
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:59,399
and go into the city and it shall be told thee what thou must do. That's interesting because God's

388
00:23:59,399 --> 00:24:05,239
going to speak to someone else here in just a moment as we go through the passage and Ananias

389
00:24:05,239 --> 00:24:11,479
is going to receive this instruction. But I want you to see that Jesus told him to go to the city

390
00:24:11,479 --> 00:24:16,839
and see and go there and it shall be told thee what thou must do. Notice in verse number seven,

391
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:21,720
the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man. And Saul

392
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:27,239
arose from the earth and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man, but they led him by the hand and

393
00:24:27,239 --> 00:24:33,320
brought him into Damascus. And he was there three days. He was three days without sight, it says,

394
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:39,880
and neither did eat nor drink. Notice verse number 10, there was a certain disciple at Damascus named

395
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:46,200
Ananias. And to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias. And he said, behold, I am here, Lord.

396
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:54,279
Notice what the Lord says, arise and go into the street, which is called straight and inquire in

397
00:24:54,279 --> 00:25:06,200
the house of Judas for one called Saul of Tarsus, for behold, he prayeth. He prayeth.

398
00:25:07,959 --> 00:25:13,639
What was Paul doing? I understand Saul, we refer to him as Paul. He was praying. Let me ask you in

399
00:25:13,639 --> 00:25:19,239
verse number six, did Jesus tell him to go pray? Actually didn't. It's not recorded that Jesus

400
00:25:19,239 --> 00:25:27,880
said, go into the city and pray. But Paul's praying. He's praying. Jesus told him, it shall

401
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:33,399
be told thee what thou must do. We can only assume what it is that Paul was praying, the direction in

402
00:25:33,399 --> 00:25:38,679
which he was seeking. We understand that he met the Lord. His life was changed. He was saved. This

403
00:25:38,679 --> 00:25:44,359
is his testimony of salvation in this passage of Scripture. We find that the Bible tells us,

404
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:48,760
as you continue reading on, that Ananias is concerned. He's saying, listen, we know about

405
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:55,000
this guy and you really want me to go. And we find that the Lord graciously speaks to Ananias and

406
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,839
tells him that he's chosen. Notice in verse number 15, after the objection, the Bible says that the

407
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:06,839
Lord said unto him, go thy way for he is a chosen vessel unto me to bear my name before the Gentiles

408
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:11,320
and kings and the children of Israel. For I will show him how great things he must suffer for my

409
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:18,040
name's sake. And Ananias went his way, entered into the house, and putting his hands on him,

410
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:23,880
said, brother, saw the Lord, even Jesus, that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest,

411
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:27,720
hath sent me, that thou mightest receive thy sight and be filled with the Holy Ghost. And

412
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:31,639
we see that he then preaches and all that takes place. And of course, we're familiar with the life

413
00:26:31,639 --> 00:26:37,079
of Paul. But I want you to just think for a moment as we evaluate our lives personally and how Paul,

414
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:42,359
right after his conversion, that when Jesus speaks to Ananias and says, listen, Ananias,

415
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:46,600
I have a task for you, and I want you to go into the city, and he tells him what street to go to,

416
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:50,919
and he tells me he's going to go to a house, and you're going to find one named Saul, and he's

417
00:26:50,919 --> 00:26:59,880
praying. That's powerful to me. It's impactful to me to see the response of Saul just after his

418
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:06,200
conversion that he's praying. We know much about the Apostle Paul. We read of his missionary

419
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:12,200
journeys. We read much of his letters, and we read in those letters how that under the inspiration

420
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:17,880
of the Holy Spirit of God that he tells those recipients, whether they be individuals or

421
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:26,119
whether they be churches, he tells them how he's praying for them regularly. Paul says,

422
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:30,119
I'm praying for you. And he doesn't just say, I'm praying for you, but he tells them how

423
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:33,880
he's praying for them. Paul is a man of prayer.

424
00:27:35,959 --> 00:27:39,399
Paul understood the importance of prayer. He understood that in his life there was a priority

425
00:27:39,399 --> 00:27:46,440
placed upon prayer. And we find that Paul is praying here in Acts 9, and we find that that's

426
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:52,600
his response, and we find that that becomes a pattern in his life, and not a pattern such as

427
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:58,119
rote religion, not a pattern as in, I said my prayers, quote unquote. That's not the idea of

428
00:27:58,119 --> 00:28:05,639
praying. It's not rote religion. I'm talking to my Father. Amen? I belong to Him. I've been

429
00:28:05,639 --> 00:28:11,480
adopted in His family. We mentioned last week, or two weeks ago from 1 John, how that He spoke

430
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:16,200
about the little children and the young men and the fathers, and we spoke about the little children,

431
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:20,919
how that at salvation, there's just a couple of things that we learn right away. Number one,

432
00:28:20,919 --> 00:28:28,279
our sins are forgiven. Number two, He's my Father, and I'm speaking to Him. It's not some recorded

433
00:28:28,279 --> 00:28:32,919
prayer. It's not some printed out, I just take a prayer book, and I just pray these prayers,

434
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:38,200
and they're just vain repetitions. No, it's not praying so that someone could look at me. By the

435
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:43,000
way, Jesus spoke of those religious leaders that prayed in that manner, and He said they have their

436
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,880
reward. You know what their reward was? The recognition of man. But He said, when you pray,

437
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:57,880
enter into your closet. Amen? And we pray to our Father. We pour our heart out unto Him. Last

438
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:03,000
Sunday morning in Sunday school, Psalm 62.8, we didn't deal with a miracle. We've been dealing

439
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,479
with miracles, but God just impressed that passage of Scripture, that verse of Scripture,

440
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:11,559
upon my heart. I couldn't get away from it all week, and we dealt with it last Sunday morning

441
00:29:11,559 --> 00:29:17,000
in Sunday school, and how the psalmist told us that we're to trust in Him at all times, and we're to

442
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:27,000
pour our heart out before Him. Hannah did that. David did that on more than one occasion. The

443
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,039
people of God that I mentioned by way of introduction this morning, that testimony of

444
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:36,279
answered prayer, they pour their heart out to God. Why? For He's a refuge for us.

445
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:43,320
You don't need a prayer book that has some recorded prayers that someone wrote down.

446
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:49,880
You just need to pour your heart out to God. Paul's praying. Paul tells the people that he

447
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:54,679
ministers to that he's praying for him. Paul asks the people that he's ministering to to pray for

448
00:29:54,679 --> 00:30:01,479
him. Often throughout the Scriptures, you find that Paul will ask the question. In fact, in Ephesians 6,

449
00:30:01,479 --> 00:30:03,679
when he talks about after the armor of God

450
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,399
that I mentioned earlier, how that he says praying always,

451
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,839
he then specifically says, and pray for me.

452
00:30:10,439 --> 00:30:13,479
He asked the believers in Thessalonica this way.

453
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:16,999
He says, brethren, pray for us.

454
00:30:16,999 --> 00:30:19,119
He tells the believers in the church in Colossae

455
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:21,459
to pray for him and to pray for them

456
00:30:21,459 --> 00:30:23,239
that the doors would be opened,

457
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:25,319
that he would speak with boldness

458
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:27,259
the way that he's supposed to speak.

459
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:31,379
No wonder in 1 Timothy 2, in verse number eight,

460
00:30:31,379 --> 00:30:36,339
he says, I will therefore that men pray everywhere,

461
00:30:36,339 --> 00:30:39,239
lifting up holy hands without wrath and doubting.

462
00:30:39,239 --> 00:30:41,979
Paul understood the importance of prayer.

463
00:30:41,979 --> 00:30:44,299
What a great example for us this morning.

464
00:30:44,299 --> 00:30:46,799
When we evaluate our lives personally,

465
00:30:48,459 --> 00:30:51,579
personally, what place does prayer have in my life?

466
00:30:51,579 --> 00:30:54,019
Number two, and I'll be done with this this morning,

467
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:58,859
when I evaluate prayer and when I ask the question,

468
00:30:58,859 --> 00:31:01,339
the place of prayer in our lives,

469
00:31:02,179 --> 00:31:05,819
yes, personally, but number two, corporately, corporately.

470
00:31:05,819 --> 00:31:08,899
I mentioned this two, three weeks ago now,

471
00:31:08,899 --> 00:31:11,499
the first Sunday that we started praying before our service,

472
00:31:11,499 --> 00:31:14,979
we start with a song and then we have a season of prayer.

473
00:31:14,979 --> 00:31:17,539
I believe God's pleased with that, by the way.

474
00:31:17,539 --> 00:31:21,139
It encourages my heart to hear the voices of people praying.

475
00:31:22,179 --> 00:31:26,359
How sweet that must be in the ears of God, amen?

476
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:30,739
Jesus said this in Matthew 21 in verse number 13,

477
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:33,059
and this is the verse that I said that Sunday morning

478
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:35,939
that we first changed the order of our services

479
00:31:35,939 --> 00:31:38,599
and made this emphasis on prayer corporately.

480
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:42,439
He said, by house shall be called the house of prayer.

481
00:31:43,259 --> 00:31:44,979
And just in case we weren't clear

482
00:31:44,979 --> 00:31:47,559
as to what house he was speaking of,

483
00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:51,019
we find that in 1 Timothy chapter three in verse number 15,

484
00:31:51,019 --> 00:31:52,979
that the word of God plainly teaches

485
00:31:52,979 --> 00:31:57,979
that the house of God is the church of the living God, amen?

486
00:31:58,139 --> 00:31:59,399
Amen?

487
00:31:59,399 --> 00:32:01,699
So he wasn't specifically just speaking

488
00:32:01,699 --> 00:32:05,099
about the temple, his house.

489
00:32:05,099 --> 00:32:06,419
This is God's house.

490
00:32:06,419 --> 00:32:07,779
You know that the Lord Jesus Christ

491
00:32:07,779 --> 00:32:09,099
is the head of the church?

492
00:32:10,699 --> 00:32:11,899
Someone was asking me recently

493
00:32:11,899 --> 00:32:16,139
about the church polity in a Baptist church.

494
00:32:16,139 --> 00:32:18,539
And the church polity in a Baptist church

495
00:32:18,539 --> 00:32:21,579
differs from church polity in some other churches.

496
00:32:21,579 --> 00:32:22,899
I began to explain some things,

497
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:24,019
and I said first and foremost,

498
00:32:24,019 --> 00:32:27,959
the Lord Jesus Christ is the head of the church, amen?

499
00:32:28,819 --> 00:32:29,939
I'm thankful for that.

500
00:32:29,939 --> 00:32:32,059
It's his church.

501
00:32:32,059 --> 00:32:36,539
And he said, my house shall be a house of prayer.

502
00:32:36,539 --> 00:32:38,579
Should be a house of prayer.

503
00:32:38,579 --> 00:32:40,059
I want you to think about the example

504
00:32:40,059 --> 00:32:43,859
when we think about the place of prayer in our lives,

505
00:32:43,859 --> 00:32:45,579
not just personally but corporately.

506
00:32:45,579 --> 00:32:47,619
Turn to Acts 12, if you will.

507
00:32:47,619 --> 00:32:49,819
We're in Acts nine looking at the life of Paul,

508
00:32:49,819 --> 00:32:51,419
but now I want you to look in Acts 12

509
00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:54,499
and the context of Acts chapter number 12

510
00:32:54,499 --> 00:32:56,179
is the situation with Peter.

511
00:32:56,179 --> 00:32:58,299
We know that James has already been killed.

512
00:32:58,299 --> 00:32:59,579
According to verse number two,

513
00:32:59,579 --> 00:33:02,699
Herod's killed James, and then he takes Peter,

514
00:33:02,699 --> 00:33:05,139
and he's intending to kill Peter as well.

515
00:33:05,139 --> 00:33:07,819
And we know that that's taking place.

516
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,819
And Herod, why does he wanna kill Peter?

517
00:33:09,819 --> 00:33:11,799
Well, he saw that it pleased the people,

518
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:14,899
the Jews in particular, that he killed James,

519
00:33:14,899 --> 00:33:16,859
and so therefore he takes Peter,

520
00:33:16,859 --> 00:33:18,279
according to verse number three.

521
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:21,619
But I want you to think of what takes place here

522
00:33:21,619 --> 00:33:23,199
in Acts chapter number 12.

523
00:33:23,199 --> 00:33:25,299
Notice the Bible says in verse number five,

524
00:33:25,299 --> 00:33:28,059
Peter therefore was kept in prison.

525
00:33:29,139 --> 00:33:30,459
He was kept in prison.

526
00:33:30,459 --> 00:33:32,859
He was gonna be there for a short period of time,

527
00:33:32,859 --> 00:33:35,379
and then after which we understand

528
00:33:35,379 --> 00:33:37,779
that Herod would bring him forth to kill him.

529
00:33:38,779 --> 00:33:42,419
And the Bible tells us in Acts 12 in verse number five,

530
00:33:42,419 --> 00:33:44,379
I want you to notice, it says Peter therefore

531
00:33:44,379 --> 00:33:47,039
was kept in prison, but then notice the next phrase,

532
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:51,499
but prayer was made without ceasing

533
00:33:51,499 --> 00:33:55,519
of the church unto God for him.

534
00:33:58,779 --> 00:34:01,779
As you know, often I like to, as I read

535
00:34:01,779 --> 00:34:03,359
and as I preach the word of God,

536
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:06,699
I like to put myself in the setting.

537
00:34:06,699 --> 00:34:08,579
We did that a little bit this morning in Sunday school

538
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:09,579
as we looked at that miracle,

539
00:34:09,579 --> 00:34:13,019
and let's just kind of be there and see what's happening.

540
00:34:13,019 --> 00:34:15,579
And this morning when I look at this passage of Scripture,

541
00:34:15,579 --> 00:34:18,059
and as I have looked at this passage over the years,

542
00:34:18,059 --> 00:34:20,099
I put myself in the setting,

543
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:22,179
and I see the church of God,

544
00:34:22,179 --> 00:34:24,859
and I see the events that are taking place,

545
00:34:24,859 --> 00:34:27,099
and James is already killed.

546
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:29,259
Herod's taken a sword and he's killed him.

547
00:34:29,259 --> 00:34:30,759
That's pretty serious, right?

548
00:34:31,899 --> 00:34:33,459
And he saw that the Jews were pleased,

549
00:34:33,459 --> 00:34:34,699
so he says, well, I'm gonna take Peter too,

550
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:36,699
and I'm gonna kill him.

551
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:38,739
But because of some things that were taking place,

552
00:34:38,739 --> 00:34:39,979
I'm gonna put him in prison first,

553
00:34:39,979 --> 00:34:41,739
and then I'm gonna kill him afterwards.

554
00:34:41,739 --> 00:34:43,419
And we find that the Bible tells us

555
00:34:43,419 --> 00:34:47,259
that the church of God responded how, they prayed.

556
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:50,379
Now, when I try to put myself in the position,

557
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:53,459
I ask myself this question, how would I have responded?

558
00:34:55,739 --> 00:34:57,179
What would I have done?

559
00:34:58,819 --> 00:35:00,219
Who would I have called and said,

560
00:35:00,219 --> 00:35:02,979
hey, we gotta get a plan going to get Peter out of jail?

561
00:35:06,859 --> 00:35:08,459
And I start networking with people and say,

562
00:35:08,459 --> 00:35:09,739
hey, listen, I know you're good at this,

563
00:35:09,739 --> 00:35:10,659
and I know you're good at that,

564
00:35:10,659 --> 00:35:13,259
and you're a strong, big guy, and I want you on my team,

565
00:35:13,259 --> 00:35:14,579
and we gotta do this, that, and the other,

566
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:15,899
and we're gonna get Peter out of jail, man.

567
00:35:16,179 --> 00:35:18,219
We're gonna get him out of prison.

568
00:35:18,219 --> 00:35:20,139
Isn't that how we operate sometimes?

569
00:35:20,139 --> 00:35:21,179
Seriously.

570
00:35:21,179 --> 00:35:23,179
It's just how we operate sometimes.

571
00:35:25,459 --> 00:35:26,779
We just immediately begin to think about,

572
00:35:26,779 --> 00:35:29,659
okay, what do I need to do to solve this problem?

573
00:35:29,659 --> 00:35:31,819
What do I need to do to take care of this?

574
00:35:31,819 --> 00:35:34,339
James is killed, Peter's in prison, man.

575
00:35:34,339 --> 00:35:36,659
Some maybe flee because, man, I'm gonna be next.

576
00:35:36,659 --> 00:35:38,739
I don't wanna get killed.

577
00:35:38,739 --> 00:35:40,019
Some are gonna try to figure out how to,

578
00:35:40,019 --> 00:35:42,459
no, but the Bible tells us that,

579
00:35:42,459 --> 00:35:44,459
but prayer was made without ceasing

580
00:35:44,459 --> 00:35:46,499
of the church and to God for him.

581
00:35:46,499 --> 00:35:48,379
They responded in prayer.

582
00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:50,179
They responded in prayer,

583
00:35:50,179 --> 00:35:52,179
and when we see how the church prayed,

584
00:35:52,179 --> 00:35:53,819
the Bible continues, and it says,

585
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:54,659
in verse number six,

586
00:35:54,659 --> 00:35:56,579
and when Herod would have brought him forth,

587
00:35:56,579 --> 00:35:59,339
the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers

588
00:35:59,339 --> 00:36:01,219
bound with two chains in the keepers

589
00:36:01,219 --> 00:36:03,059
before the door kept the prison,

590
00:36:03,059 --> 00:36:05,979
I mean, he was pretty shut in, was he not?

591
00:36:05,979 --> 00:36:07,499
We'd have had to have a pretty elaborate,

592
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:10,219
sophisticated plan to break Peter out,

593
00:36:10,219 --> 00:36:13,699
but God, he's over all of that stuff.

594
00:36:14,659 --> 00:36:17,539
And here, the Bible tells us that they were,

595
00:36:17,539 --> 00:36:18,459
I mean, it was secure.

596
00:36:18,459 --> 00:36:21,019
It was as secure as it could be.

597
00:36:21,019 --> 00:36:21,859
In verse number seven,

598
00:36:21,859 --> 00:36:24,419
behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him,

599
00:36:24,419 --> 00:36:25,859
and a light shined in the prison,

600
00:36:25,859 --> 00:36:28,819
and he smote Peter on the side, I love that,

601
00:36:28,819 --> 00:36:30,259
and raised him up, saying,

602
00:36:30,259 --> 00:36:33,779
Arise up quickly, and his chains fell off from his hands.

603
00:36:35,499 --> 00:36:36,859
And the Bible tells us,

604
00:36:36,859 --> 00:36:38,019
the angel said unto him,

605
00:36:38,019 --> 00:36:42,059
Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals, and so he did.

606
00:36:42,059 --> 00:36:42,899
He saith unto him,

607
00:36:42,899 --> 00:36:45,459
Cast thy garment upon thee, and follow me.

608
00:36:45,459 --> 00:36:47,139
And he went out, and followed him,

609
00:36:47,139 --> 00:36:49,859
and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel,

610
00:36:49,859 --> 00:36:51,499
but thought he saw a vision.

611
00:36:51,499 --> 00:36:54,219
Now, let me ask you, pause just for a moment

612
00:36:54,219 --> 00:36:55,419
before we continue reading.

613
00:36:55,419 --> 00:36:57,459
What's the church doing?

614
00:36:57,459 --> 00:36:59,579
The church is still praying,

615
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:01,899
because the Bible tells us in verse number five,

616
00:37:01,899 --> 00:37:04,459
but prayer was made without ceasing

617
00:37:04,459 --> 00:37:08,039
of the church unto God for him.

618
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:09,939
The church is praying.

619
00:37:09,939 --> 00:37:11,979
They have an all-night prayer meeting.

620
00:37:12,779 --> 00:37:14,419
You know how well those are attended?

621
00:37:15,459 --> 00:37:16,379
Come to Wednesday night,

622
00:37:16,379 --> 00:37:17,699
and see how well those are attended.

623
00:37:17,699 --> 00:37:19,099
That'll give you an idea of how well

624
00:37:19,099 --> 00:37:21,519
an all-night prayer meeting would be attended.

625
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:22,359
Amen?

626
00:37:23,299 --> 00:37:25,019
And it says this in verse number 10.

627
00:37:25,019 --> 00:37:27,979
When they were past the first and the second ward,

628
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:30,979
they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city,

629
00:37:30,979 --> 00:37:32,939
which opened to them of his own accord,

630
00:37:32,939 --> 00:37:35,759
and they went out, and passed on through one street,

631
00:37:35,759 --> 00:37:37,939
and forthwith the angel departed from him.

632
00:37:37,939 --> 00:37:41,139
And when Peter was come to himself,

633
00:37:41,139 --> 00:37:42,099
this is what he said,

634
00:37:42,099 --> 00:37:45,899
now I know of a surety that the Lord hath sent his angel,

635
00:37:45,899 --> 00:37:47,939
and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod,

636
00:37:47,939 --> 00:37:51,419
and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews.

637
00:37:51,419 --> 00:37:52,859
When he had considered the thing,

638
00:37:52,859 --> 00:37:55,539
he came to the house of Mary, the mother of John,

639
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:56,899
whose surname was Mark.

640
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:57,859
What does it say?

641
00:37:57,859 --> 00:38:02,859
Where many were gathered together praying.

642
00:38:05,179 --> 00:38:06,379
They're praying.

643
00:38:08,779 --> 00:38:09,899
Evaluate it personally,

644
00:38:09,899 --> 00:38:12,059
but then evaluate it corporately.

645
00:38:12,059 --> 00:38:14,699
What place does prayer have?

646
00:38:14,699 --> 00:38:15,659
Corporately.

647
00:38:20,179 --> 00:38:23,379
As we read in Acts chapter number 12,

648
00:38:24,299 --> 00:38:26,179
and you read from verse number six

649
00:38:26,179 --> 00:38:28,779
down to where I stopped in verse number 12,

650
00:38:28,779 --> 00:38:33,779
all that that you're reading of that miraculous deliverance,

651
00:38:33,899 --> 00:38:35,880
I would argue this morning

652
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:39,559
that that is God's hand moving

653
00:38:39,559 --> 00:38:42,179
in response to the church praying.

654
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,279
Amen?

655
00:38:45,279 --> 00:38:50,279
The hand of God moving miraculously, powerfully,

656
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:53,599
beyond what the church could ever do.

657
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:55,000
Remember the Bible tells us,

658
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,459
I mentioned the prayer promise,

659
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:58,239
that He is able to do exceeding abundantly

660
00:38:58,239 --> 00:39:00,019
above all that we ask or think.

661
00:39:00,019 --> 00:39:02,159
Now listen, sometimes we can ask or think

662
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:03,239
some great things,

663
00:39:03,279 --> 00:39:06,440
but we might have a little bit of wavering,

664
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:10,279
and He tells us that we're to pray without wrath and doubting,

665
00:39:10,279 --> 00:39:13,359
but we find here that these people are gathered praying.

666
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:15,880
No doubt they're praying that God would move.

667
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,839
Perhaps some have prayed that God would deliver Peter,

668
00:39:18,839 --> 00:39:21,079
but they can't even begin to imagine

669
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:23,000
how God would deliver Peter.

670
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:28,000
Because Herod is powerful, right?

671
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,039
And Herod has already killed James,

672
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:34,199
and now Herod has taken Peter,

673
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:35,959
and Herod has this plan,

674
00:39:35,959 --> 00:39:37,880
and Peter is in prison,

675
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,079
and the guards are there,

676
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:41,399
and the wards are shut.

677
00:39:41,399 --> 00:39:42,399
But they're praying.

678
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:44,679
They're praying.

679
00:39:45,799 --> 00:39:48,159
And Peter, according to verse number 13,

680
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:49,440
he came, it says,

681
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,039
and as Peter knocked at the door of the gate,

682
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:54,599
this is always make you laugh,

683
00:39:55,919 --> 00:39:59,839
a damsel came to hearken named Rhoda.

684
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:01,260
So Peter's knocking.

685
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:09,100
It says, when she knew Peter's voice, she opened not the gate for gladness, but ran

686
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:12,460
in and told how Peter stood before the gate.

687
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:15,560
She left him out there because she was so excited.

688
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,660
But then guess what?

689
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:25,400
They say, nah, thou art mad, you're crazy.

690
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:29,220
She constantly affirmed that it was even so.

691
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:32,220
Then said they, it is his angel.

692
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,740
But Peter continued knocking.

693
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:38,220
I don't know how long he was out there knocking, but he just kept knocking.

694
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:48,780
It says, when they opened the door and saw him, they were astonished, they were astonished.

695
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:52,740
God worked, God answered prayer.

696
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:55,120
You've been praying.

697
00:40:55,120 --> 00:41:00,680
And then the Bible tells us, but he, in verse 17, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold

698
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:01,680
their peace.

699
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,120
Why do you think he had to quiet them down?

700
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,120
Why?

701
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:07,000
Because they're excited.

702
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:14,440
Notice what it says, declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison.

703
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:17,440
He said, go, show these things unto James and the brethren, and he departed and went

704
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,600
into another place.

705
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:22,780
But I want you to just think about this in verse number 17, that when he declares unto

706
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:28,260
them how that the Lord had brought him out of the prison, that was a direct response

707
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:33,540
of their praying, of their praying.

708
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:39,340
I don't know that Peter was aware of the prayer meeting that was taking place.

709
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:45,420
I know that as they were praying, they weren't aware of how God was delivering Peter until

710
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,660
he came there.

711
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:55,740
And this morning, as we think about our lives and evaluating and asking ourselves the question,

712
00:41:55,740 --> 00:42:03,180
what place does prayer really have in my life, in my life personally?

713
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:06,580
Does it have, is there a priority that's placed upon prayer?

714
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:08,260
Do I have a plan?

715
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:15,140
What is it that would best describe, what words would best describe my prayer life?

716
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:17,660
Prayers work.

717
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:18,660
Prayers work.

718
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:27,740
But then when we evaluate prayer corporately, Jesus said, my house shall be a house of prayer.

719
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:32,940
I no longer desire for prayer to just be a bookend to our services.

720
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:35,020
I don't.

721
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:39,900
I intend with the help of God that we'll do exactly what we did this morning, we'll begin

722
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:46,380
each service with a season of prayer, praying that God would move and work.

723
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:51,100
Listen, those moments of prayer, they really aren't to pray for somebody that's sick.

724
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:55,140
They're not to pray for somebody that's whatever.

725
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:58,940
It's very specific prayer for what's at hand.

726
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:03,540
Oh God, use the song service this morning.

727
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:05,180
Speak to my heart through the songs.

728
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:08,420
Be glorified as we sing praise to Thy name.

729
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:11,260
God, would You use the preacher this morning?

730
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:14,780
Fill him with Your power to deliver the Word of God.

731
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:17,300
God, help me to be attentive.

732
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:24,260
Help me to long to hear and to get something from You this morning, God.

733
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:28,780
And we use that time of prayer for that purpose.

734
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:33,020
We really seek the face of God for how He would be exalted and glorified.

735
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:37,380
That if there's somebody that's lost in our midst that the Holy Spirit of God would speak

736
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:43,020
to them and would convict them of their sin and of Christ's righteousness, of judgment

737
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:48,620
to come, that today would be the day of salvation in their lives.

738
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:53,580
For the saying that God would stir us up, that God would change us, that God would do

739
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:57,580
something in our lives, that He'd be glorified.

740
00:43:57,580 --> 00:44:02,220
That's the purpose of that prayer time.

741
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:13,160
With the help of God, I seek to make prayer a priority, not only in my life personally,

742
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:15,060
but corporately as a church.

743
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:22,100
As I mentioned a moment ago, and it's worth repeating, I no longer desire for prayer to

744
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:25,260
simply be bookends to our service.

745
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:26,860
I don't.

746
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:30,460
Here's what someone said.

747
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:39,779
Someone said this about prayer, the pulpit of this day is weak in praying.

748
00:44:39,779 --> 00:44:51,380
The pride of learning is against the dependent humility of prayer.

749
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:56,460
When I read that, it just…

750
00:44:56,460 --> 00:45:00,779
I understand that I've been given a responsibility to preach the Word.

751
00:45:00,779 --> 00:45:03,180
That's my responsibility.

752
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:07,220
But God said, my house shall be a house of prayer.

753
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:13,180
And if we're not praying like we're supposed to, we can preach, we can get the greatest

754
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:17,540
preachers that walk the face of this earth.

755
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:23,600
But if we're not prayed up and we're not ready to receive, who's a better preacher

756
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,860
than Jesus?

757
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:26,860
Nobody.

758
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:29,460
But you know what Jesus said?

759
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,460
He said, you've heard my words, but you're doing them not.

760
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:34,700
You're like a foolish man.

761
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:36,540
There's others that heard His words and they did it.

762
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:38,619
He said, I liken you to a wise man.

763
00:45:38,619 --> 00:45:43,100
We sing the song, wise men build his house upon the rock, the foolish man, no, right?

764
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:45,100
The floods come, so on and so forth.

765
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:52,860
The response, the tenderness of the reception, it wasn't in the message that Jesus delivered.

766
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:58,500
It was the same message from God in flesh.

767
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:04,380
This morning, I want to just open up the curtain a little bit to help you understand why we're

768
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:07,860
placing a greater priority on prayer.

769
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:10,680
I mentioned this three weeks ago.

770
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:14,420
I want to be teachable.

771
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:21,420
I love preaching the Word of God, but when I heard that message a few weeks ago and someone

772
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:28,540
used that analogy of prayer being bookends in our service, I was like, Lord, forgive

773
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:29,860
me.

774
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:34,700
Because quite honestly, we pray, say, Lord, bless our services.

775
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:39,660
And then we have our service, and then we say, Lord, thank You for blessing our service

776
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:41,900
this morning.

777
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:47,220
What place does prayer have in my life, personally and corporately?

778
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:48,220
Let's pray.

779
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:49,580
Father, we love You.

780
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:52,020
Lord, we thank You for loving us.

781
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:53,940
Thank You for the Word of God.

782
00:46:53,940 --> 00:47:02,700
Lord, we thank You for the countless promises throughout the entirety of Your Word with

783
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:10,260
regard to prayer, the encouragement that we receive by the way in which You've answered

784
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:12,300
and worked.

785
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:17,339
As we read secular history and read church history, Bible history of those that have

786
00:47:17,339 --> 00:47:22,420
seen Your hand move and work, God, how we're encouraged to know that You're a God who

787
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:26,059
hears and answers prayer.

788
00:47:26,059 --> 00:47:32,900
This morning, all of those truths and all of those realities must have an impact in

789
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:36,980
our lives.

790
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:39,059
We must be doers of the Word and not hearers only.

791
00:47:39,059 --> 00:47:49,779
We must come to the place where we truly evaluate where prayer is in our lives, the

792
00:47:49,779 --> 00:47:55,740
place of prayer, personally and corporately.

793
00:47:55,740 --> 00:48:01,860
Lord, I pray that Your Holy Spirit would move and work as only You can.

794
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:05,320
We don't want to rush You this morning, Lord.

795
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:06,760
Help us do business with You.

796
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,880
Help us to respond.

797
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:12,119
God, help us to make some commitments.

798
00:48:12,119 --> 00:48:20,600
Help us, Lord, to renew some commitments with regard to prayer.

799
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:25,880
We want to see You move and work, and God, we want to be able to hear accounts like we

800
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:38,400
read in Acts 12, You moving and working in distinct, miraculous ways as a result of prayer.

801
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:43,679
We commit these moments to You and ask that You'd work as only You can.

802
00:48:43,679 --> 00:48:45,239
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

803
00:48:45,239 --> 00:48:47,000
Would You stand with me?

804
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,160
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

805
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:49,840
Kimberly is going to play quietly on the piano.

806
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:52,239
The altar is open.

807
00:48:52,239 --> 00:48:54,000
Thank God for prayer.

808
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,679
Make a commitment to the Lord.

809
00:48:56,679 --> 00:49:01,040
Evaluate your life, your prayer life, as Kimberly plays the altar is open.
