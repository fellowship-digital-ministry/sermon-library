WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.039
This morning, that was a blessing.

00:00:01.039 --> 00:00:02.960
1 Timothy chapter number two,

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.239
this morning, 1 Timothy chapter number two.

00:00:05.239 --> 00:00:07.159
I know that we've been preaching

00:00:07.159 --> 00:00:08.500
through the book of 1 John,

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.840
and we will get back there,

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.640
Lord willing, next Sunday.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.539
But I wanna preach a message this morning.

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:15.439
If you'd looked at the back of the bulletin already,

00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:16.840
you see the title this morning,

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.760
the place of prayer in our lives.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.440
The place of prayer in our lives.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.959
We think about the subject of prayer.

00:00:24.959 --> 00:00:26.920
In fact, I've said this before.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.879
It's a lot easier for me to talk about prayer,

00:00:28.879 --> 00:00:30.760
and it's a lot easier for me to preach about prayer

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.479
than it is for me to actually pray.

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:36.639
And the reality is that prayer is work.

00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:39.959
And as we think about the place of prayer in our lives,

00:00:39.959 --> 00:00:40.959
obviously, as you know,

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:42.959
and I shared with you just a little bit

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:46.380
of starting our services with a season of prayer,

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.919
and I've just thoroughly enjoyed it.

00:00:47.919 --> 00:00:49.360
I think it's appropriate.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.759
And I hope that this message this morning

00:00:52.759 --> 00:00:54.319
will give you a little bit more insight

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:56.880
as to why I believe that it's so necessary,

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.959
and really ask the Lord to forgive me

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:03.040
for not having prayer as a more prominent place

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.400
in our services,

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.519
and understanding the importance of prayer.

00:01:07.519 --> 00:01:09.519
And before we dive into the text of scripture

00:01:09.519 --> 00:01:12.000
here in 1 Timothy chapter number two this morning,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.480
I wanna give you just a little bit of remind us, really,

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.959
of just some foundational truths,

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:18.739
as I'll refer to them as,

00:01:18.739 --> 00:01:21.519
with regard to the subject matter of prayer.

00:01:21.519 --> 00:01:22.839
Some foundational truths.

00:01:22.839 --> 00:01:23.919
And I think it's important for us

00:01:23.919 --> 00:01:26.080
to understand these foundational truths

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.080
as we get into the message this morning.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.559
And let me say this, right at the beginning,

00:01:29.559 --> 00:01:32.279
we're living in an evil day.

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:35.199
We are living in the last days,

00:01:35.199 --> 00:01:37.879
as they're described by Paul,

00:01:37.879 --> 00:01:39.199
as he's writing to Timothy

00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:40.879
in 2 Timothy chapter number three.

00:01:40.879 --> 00:01:44.319
He speaks about the evil days, the last days,

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:45.599
the perilous times.

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:47.680
He describes all that's taking place.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.080
And I received an email just on Friday,

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.279
and the question in the email,

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:52.279
it was not from anyone.

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:55.000
It was a mass mailing type of an email.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.879
But the question in the subject line was this,

00:01:56.879 --> 00:01:58.400
are we living in the last days?

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.879
And it's like, if you have to ask the question,

00:02:00.879 --> 00:02:02.860
I'm not sure where we're going here, right?

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.599
Because obviously, if you know anything

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:07.580
about that phrase, last days,

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.800
we are absolutely living in the last days.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.000
And we find that in these evil days,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.119
in these last days, that we need strength.

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:22.160
We need strength to stand in an evil day.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.479
And the reality is that that strength

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:27.039
is not gonna come by your willpower.

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:30.399
It's not gonna come by your physical power.

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:33.199
The strength to stand in the evil day

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:37.279
is going to be a result of prayer power.

00:02:37.279 --> 00:02:38.759
And the reality this morning is that

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:40.360
in Ephesians chapter number six,

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.080
as God is giving to the believers in Ephesus,

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.339
to us by way of preservation,

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:48.440
the whole armor of God,

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.960
he concludes the section by speaking

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.759
about the importance of prayer.

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:55.559
In verse number 18 of Ephesians six,

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:56.559
you can look at it later,

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:58.360
and you can see that he emphasizes

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.960
after he goes through all of the armor

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.479
and putting on the whole armor of God,

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:05.119
he talks about praying always

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:06.479
in the importance of prayer.

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:09.360
We understand that the church in Thessalonica

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.279
is told pray without ceasing.

00:03:11.279 --> 00:03:13.960
We understand that our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ,

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.880
he prayed often.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.800
But I want you to consider with me this morning

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.800
as we think about some foundational truth

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.559
with regard to prayer,

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:22.800
I would say this.

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:24.720
We must be mindful of the fact

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.679
that an invitation has been extended.

00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:29.800
Prayer is the unique privilege

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.119
that is reserved for the child of God.

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:36.080
God Almighty has extended an invitation

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.759
to you and to me and to every one of his people

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:42.360
to enter into his presence.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.199
What a great invitation.

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:47.639
Remember the words that he spoke to Jeremiah

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:48.960
in Jeremiah 33,

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.000
call unto me.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.399
Right, isn't that wonderful?

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.360
This invitation that the God of the universe,

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.399
God Almighty, my heavenly Father,

00:03:58.399 --> 00:04:00.160
he says call unto me.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.119
And then he says this,

00:04:01.119 --> 00:04:04.360
and I will answer thee.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.600
Isn't that precious?

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.440
And show thee great and mighty things

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.880
which thou knowest not.

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.320
Consider the words of Jesus in Matthew 7.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.119
He says, ask and it shall be given unto you.

00:04:16.119 --> 00:04:18.279
Seek and ye shall find.

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:20.679
Knock and it shall be opened unto you

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.239
for everyone that asketh receiveth.

00:04:23.239 --> 00:04:24.359
Do you remember what James says?

00:04:24.359 --> 00:04:27.440
You have not because you ask not.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.279
He also says you have not because you ask amidst.

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:32.320
But I want you to think about what Jesus says.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.640
For everyone that asketh receiveth

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.559
and he that seeketh findeth

00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:39.040
and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.799
Notice the analogy that he uses

00:04:40.799 --> 00:04:42.760
or what man is there of you

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.000
whom if his son ask bread,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.480
will he give him a stone?

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.720
Now not one among us.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:50.600
Amen?

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.320
In fact, even if it's not your son,

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.279
but he uses that analogy,

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:55.640
but if somebody comes to you and ask for bread,

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.040
you're not gonna give him a stone.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.440
He says, or if he ask a fish,

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.760
will he give him a serpent?

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:01.839
No.

00:05:03.239 --> 00:05:05.480
No, that's not how we'd respond.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.320
And notice the powerful truth.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.399
If ye then, being evil,

00:05:11.399 --> 00:05:15.600
know how to give good gifts unto your children,

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.480
how much more?

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.040
How much more?

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.200
Let those words sing, how much more

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.239
shall your Father which is in heaven

00:05:26.239 --> 00:05:31.239
give good things to them that ask him?

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.079
He said, ask, ask,

00:05:35.079 --> 00:05:37.160
and it shall be given you.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.040
Isn't that precious?

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.839
This invitation that's been extended.

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:43.519
I know that I've said to my children,

00:05:43.519 --> 00:05:45.519
if you need help, just ask.

00:05:45.519 --> 00:05:47.679
Perhaps you've said that to your children.

00:05:47.679 --> 00:05:49.119
Perhaps you've said it to a spouse

00:05:49.119 --> 00:05:50.040
or maybe to someone else.

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.760
You say, just ask, how often, however,

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.880
do we observe people that do not ask for help

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.559
and struggle to complete the task?

00:06:00.079 --> 00:06:00.920
Why?

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.760
Because they don't wanna ask for help.

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.320
Whether it's because of pride,

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.720
whether it's because they don't wanna inconvenience you.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:07.559
Has anyone ever said to you,

00:06:07.559 --> 00:06:08.519
well, I didn't ask you for help

00:06:08.519 --> 00:06:10.519
because I didn't wanna inconvenience you.

00:06:10.519 --> 00:06:11.720
Anyone ever say that to you?

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:12.959
I've been told that.

00:06:12.959 --> 00:06:16.279
Can I tell you, you can't inconvenience God.

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:17.239
Amen?

00:06:17.239 --> 00:06:18.799
It is impossible.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.519
The Bible tells us that he is a very present help

00:06:22.519 --> 00:06:23.959
in the time of trouble.

00:06:23.959 --> 00:06:26.239
The reality of God's word is that God

00:06:26.239 --> 00:06:29.119
is not only available to help us,

00:06:29.119 --> 00:06:31.119
but he is able to help us.

00:06:31.119 --> 00:06:34.200
And when you combine those two truths,

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:37.440
it is so powerful because he's always available

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:38.920
and he's always able.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.320
He said, ask.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.600
He said, call unto me in invitation.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.799
I want you to understand that God's given us

00:06:44.799 --> 00:06:47.839
many promises in his word with regard to prayer.

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.720
We find that throughout the Psalms,

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.160
the Psalmist regularly records

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.279
and speaks about how the Lord heard him,

00:06:56.279 --> 00:06:58.079
how the Lord heard my cry,

00:06:58.079 --> 00:06:59.839
how the Lord heard my prayer.

00:06:59.839 --> 00:07:02.200
And you think about the joy of that

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.640
and you think about the reality that God says,

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:08.720
if you call, if you ask, that I will respond.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.200
He gave us this promise in Ephesians three

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.119
that he's able to do exceeding abundantly above

00:07:14.119 --> 00:07:16.160
all that we ask or think.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.519
We're familiar with the truth

00:07:17.519 --> 00:07:20.399
of Hebrews chapter number four and verse number 16

00:07:20.399 --> 00:07:22.640
when he says that we're to come boldly

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:24.559
under the throne of grace.

00:07:24.559 --> 00:07:27.040
You think about that picture in your mind,

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:30.200
understanding that Jesus as our great high priest,

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.200
that he's provided that access

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.880
and that now you and I have the privilege

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.600
of going boldly under the throne of grace

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.799
that we may obtain mercy and find grace

00:07:41.799 --> 00:07:43.320
to help in time of need.

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.000
Think about this promise from the book

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.959
that we've been studying and we're not there yet

00:07:46.959 --> 00:07:48.799
because it's first John chapter number five,

00:07:48.799 --> 00:07:51.839
but in first John five and verse number 14,

00:07:51.839 --> 00:07:55.079
notice the way that it says this truth that says,

00:07:55.079 --> 00:07:58.799
and this is the confidence that we have in him.

00:07:58.799 --> 00:08:01.519
Now I like being confident, don't you?

00:08:01.519 --> 00:08:03.440
We have confidence, let me tell you this,

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:08.000
your confidence in Christ is never going to waver

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.880
from the perspective of him failing you.

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.239
Now, whether you have confidence in him or not

00:08:13.239 --> 00:08:15.720
is another story, but the reality is that

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.399
we can trust him.

00:08:17.399 --> 00:08:19.799
Great is thy faithfulness, amen?

00:08:19.799 --> 00:08:22.760
He is trustworthy, he is dependable,

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:25.000
and we find that he says the,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.320
and this is the confidence that we have in him

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:33.320
that if we ask anything according to his will,

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:35.719
he heareth us.

00:08:35.719 --> 00:08:38.119
Doesn't that encourage your heart this morning?

00:08:39.719 --> 00:08:42.520
I mean, when you consider the invitation

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.760
that's been extended, when you consider the promises

00:08:44.799 --> 00:08:46.799
that God has given us in his word,

00:08:46.799 --> 00:08:48.880
as we think about these foundational truths,

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:50.520
I want you to consider answered prayer,

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:52.559
the testimonies throughout the word of God

00:08:52.559 --> 00:08:53.520
of answered prayer.

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:56.599
Listen, answered prayer ought to encourage us.

00:08:56.599 --> 00:08:59.400
It ought to drive us to our knees more often

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:02.840
because we know that our God hears and answers prayer.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:06.479
I think about, you could fill in the blanks this morning.

00:09:06.479 --> 00:09:08.840
You can think about all of those that have gone before us,

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.479
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and I mean,

00:09:11.479 --> 00:09:14.080
you just start thinking about Moses and Joshua,

00:09:14.119 --> 00:09:17.280
and you think about Daniel and David and Isaiah,

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:20.640
and I mean, you just start naming all these people of God

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:24.520
that they heard from God, they prayed,

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:27.400
they saw the face of God, and God answered.

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:32.679
Paul, Peter, John.

00:09:32.679 --> 00:09:35.119
I mean, we just go on and on.

00:09:35.119 --> 00:09:38.479
And think about all of the records that we have

00:09:38.479 --> 00:09:41.799
in the Bible that record for us

00:09:42.159 --> 00:09:46.039
the way in which prayer was heard and prayer was answered.

00:09:46.039 --> 00:09:48.919
You remember Elijah, he prayed.

00:09:50.239 --> 00:09:54.919
In fact, the example is used by James

00:09:54.919 --> 00:09:57.640
when he speaks about the effectual fervent prayer

00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.280
of a righteous man availeth much,

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:01.479
he uses the example of the righteous man.

00:10:01.479 --> 00:10:09.599
example of Elijah praying in the Old Testament. Elisha prayed. Hezekiah prayed. And as we

00:10:09.599 --> 00:10:14.639
read the Word of God and we see all of these testimonies of answered prayer, they all encourage

00:10:14.639 --> 00:10:21.439
us. When we think about these foundational truths, and as I take a moment to just meditate

00:10:21.439 --> 00:10:26.079
upon those foundational truths, I believe that it leads me to a place, and really the

00:10:26.079 --> 00:10:32.119
message this morning is a place in my life where I'm going to evaluate my own prayer

00:10:32.119 --> 00:10:38.119
life. And I'm going to, with the help of God, seek to determine the place of prayer in my

00:10:38.119 --> 00:10:45.839
life. I'm not asking you this morning to evaluate the place of prayer in my life. I'm not asking

00:10:45.839 --> 00:10:50.679
you this morning to evaluate the place of prayer in your neighbor's life, in your spouse's

00:10:50.679 --> 00:10:55.799
life, in your child's life, in some other member's life. I'm asking each of us this

00:10:55.799 --> 00:11:04.759
morning to humbly, before the Lord, to evaluate the place of prayer in our own lives personally.

00:11:04.759 --> 00:11:09.019
I don't want to evaluate the place of prayer in your life. I want to evaluate the place

00:11:09.019 --> 00:11:14.719
of prayer in my life. And as we think about 1 Timothy chapter number 2, I believe that

00:11:14.719 --> 00:11:20.679
God provides us with some important truth regarding the place of prayer in our lives.

00:11:20.679 --> 00:11:24.159
Notice in 1 Timothy chapter number 2, beginning in verse number 1, the Bible says,

00:11:24.159 --> 00:11:29.719
I exhort, therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks

00:11:29.719 --> 00:11:34.559
be made for all men, for kings and for all that are in authority, that we may lead a

00:11:34.559 --> 00:11:39.499
quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty. For this is good and acceptable

00:11:39.499 --> 00:11:44.079
in the sight of God our Savior, who will have all men to be saved and to come unto the knowledge

00:11:44.119 --> 00:11:49.239
of the truth. For there is one God and one Mediator between God and man, the man Christ

00:11:49.239 --> 00:11:56.359
Jesus. Aren't you thankful for that? Notice what he did. He gave himself a ransom for

00:11:56.359 --> 00:12:03.359
all to be testified in due time, whereunto I am ordained a preacher and an apostle.

00:12:03.639 --> 00:12:10.639
I speak the truth in Christ and lie not, a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.

00:12:11.039 --> 00:12:18.039
I will, therefore, that men pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands without wrath and doubting.

00:12:22.719 --> 00:12:27.679
Anytime you read the Word of God and you find that God tells us that something is good and

00:12:27.679 --> 00:12:31.519
acceptable in His sight, we ought to take note of that. Amen?

00:12:31.519 --> 00:12:35.839
And here in this passage of Scripture, we find that very reference in verse number 3,

00:12:36.159 --> 00:12:41.879
but as we consider this morning some truth from this passage that would help us in this

00:12:41.879 --> 00:12:47.159
process of evaluation, I would say, number one, that prayer is a priority. Prayer is

00:12:47.159 --> 00:12:53.159
a priority. Notice what he says in verse number 1, I exhort, therefore, that first of all

00:12:53.159 --> 00:12:59.199
– note those words – first of all, not second, not third, not last, but first of

00:12:59.199 --> 00:13:06.199
all, that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men.

00:13:07.879 --> 00:13:12.879
There's a priority in our text of Scripture that is placed upon prayer. The reality is

00:13:12.879 --> 00:13:18.159
that prayer should be my first response and not my last resort. There are times, however,

00:13:18.159 --> 00:13:22.839
in my life, and if you'd be honest in evaluating your life this morning, that we try all sorts

00:13:22.839 --> 00:13:26.759
of things to figure it out, and then we come to the place when we say, maybe I should pray

00:13:26.759 --> 00:13:33.759
about this. But prayer should be our first response. In fact, without turning there,

00:13:34.599 --> 00:13:39.639
but in James 5, in verse 13 and 14, in both of those verses, there are questions that

00:13:39.639 --> 00:13:44.239
are asked. The first one in verse 13, are any afflicted? You know what the answer is?

00:13:44.239 --> 00:13:50.079
Let them pray. In verse 14, are any sick? You know what the answer is? Let them pray.

00:13:50.079 --> 00:13:57.079
Let them call for the elders. I understand the innocence, but let them pray. The response.

00:13:57.219 --> 00:14:01.799
Someone said this. I believe it was John R. Rice. He said, all of our problems are prayer

00:14:01.799 --> 00:14:08.639
problems. Man, that helps us to focus on that priority of prayer. The reality is that I

00:14:08.639 --> 00:14:15.639
can't preach a message with the power of God if I've not first prayed. Amen? You can't

00:14:16.359 --> 00:14:22.959
live the life that you're supposed to live and have that godly testimony in the midst

00:14:22.959 --> 00:14:27.119
of your home, in the midst of your family, in the midst of your neighbors, in the midst

00:14:27.119 --> 00:14:33.879
of your co-workers, without praying. The reality is that we can go and we can try to reach

00:14:33.879 --> 00:14:40.199
our community and reach the world with the gospel, but we must first pray, because we

00:14:40.199 --> 00:14:47.199
need the power of God. God has ordained it. We see it all throughout His Word that prayer

00:14:47.839 --> 00:14:54.839
moves the hand of God. We can argue the finer points and we can ask the questions as to

00:14:55.679 --> 00:15:02.679
why that is, but the reality is that we must simply accept that God has set it to be so.

00:15:02.839 --> 00:15:09.839
That prayer moves the hand of God. That ought to encourage us. We're to pray. We're to pray.

00:15:10.239 --> 00:15:15.079
We're to pray about everything. And we're to have prayer as a priority. It's interesting

00:15:15.079 --> 00:15:20.919
in the text of Scripture that he says that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions,

00:15:20.919 --> 00:15:24.959
giving of thanks be made for all men. Notice what he says, for kings and for all that are

00:15:24.959 --> 00:15:30.759
in authority. Then it says this, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness

00:15:30.759 --> 00:15:36.799
and honesty. You ever wonder about that verse of Scripture? You know, the reality of we'd

00:15:36.799 --> 00:15:40.079
be honest this morning with one another, it's a whole lot easier for us to complain

00:15:40.079 --> 00:15:47.079
about those in authority than it is to pray for them. Amen? I'm talking to myself this

00:15:47.439 --> 00:15:54.439
morning. It's a whole lot easier for us to criticize, to complain about those that are

00:15:58.279 --> 00:16:04.279
in authority than it is for us to pray for them. But we're to pray for those that are

00:16:04.279 --> 00:16:09.959
in authority. And then notice what he says, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life

00:16:09.959 --> 00:16:15.839
in all godliness and honesty. Why? Because God moves and God works. You know the truth

00:16:15.839 --> 00:16:22.599
of Proverbs 21, a verse of Scripture that we've often referred to over the years and

00:16:22.599 --> 00:16:27.919
rightly so, and what powerful truth it is when God gives us this truth with regard to

00:16:27.919 --> 00:16:34.179
His power. And he says this, that the king's heart is in the hand of the Lord. As the rivers

00:16:34.179 --> 00:16:41.179
of water, He, God, turneth it whithersoever He will. Do you believe that? God is able.

00:16:42.059 --> 00:16:49.019
You read throughout the book of Ezra and Nehemiah and you can see how God moved the heart of

00:16:49.019 --> 00:16:56.019
some wicked kings, some ungodly kings, how God moved and how God worked and how God responded

00:16:56.899 --> 00:17:03.899
to the prayer of His people. When they're rebuilding, they're praying. Repeatedly you

00:17:04.899 --> 00:17:10.179
can read of the times of prayer. Oh, there was a work to be done, but they understood

00:17:10.179 --> 00:17:15.459
the importance of prayer. This morning, there's a priority that is placed upon prayer. I would

00:17:15.459 --> 00:17:22.459
say this, that prayer demonstrates our dependence. When I pray, I'm demonstrating my dependence

00:17:23.339 --> 00:17:30.339
upon God. Someone said this, that prayer is not an escape from our responsibility. Rather,

00:17:33.059 --> 00:17:40.059
prayer is our response to God's ability. You know, sometimes we use the phrase and we hear

00:17:42.899 --> 00:17:49.899
the phrase used, I'll pray for you, and sometimes we think that's just a discounted response.

00:17:50.219 --> 00:17:55.179
But you know the reality is that that's the greatest thing we could do for anyone, is

00:17:55.179 --> 00:18:02.179
to pray for them. To pray for them. We find that He says that first of all, prayer is

00:18:03.819 --> 00:18:08.939
a priority. Let me say this, prayer is pleasing to our Lord. We find that it says in verse

00:18:08.939 --> 00:18:15.939
number three, for this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior. What is good

00:18:16.539 --> 00:18:20.899
and acceptable? That we're praying, that we're going to His face, that we're seeking Him.

00:18:20.899 --> 00:18:24.939
We notice that He says that who will have all men to be saved and come unto the knowledge

00:18:24.939 --> 00:18:28.279
of the truth. You know that God is not willing that any should perish, but that all should

00:18:28.279 --> 00:18:33.139
come to repentance? You know how you and I need to be praying for those that are in authority

00:18:33.139 --> 00:18:39.559
that God would save them? You know why those in authority make decisions that we disagree

00:18:39.599 --> 00:18:46.599
with so often is because they're lost. They're lost people that are operating as lost people.

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:54.760
Why should we be surprised by that? We pray for them. We pray for their salvation. That

00:18:55.359 --> 00:19:01.359
God would bring someone into their presence, that someone would cross their path that has

00:19:01.359 --> 00:19:06.639
the boldness and the courage to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ, that the Holy Spirit

00:19:06.639 --> 00:19:13.639
of God would work and move as only He can. We pray. We pray for souls to be saved. Notice

00:19:14.799 --> 00:19:19.959
it says there's one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, and what

00:19:19.959 --> 00:19:25.440
joy that is. You can go directly to God through the Lord Jesus Christ. You don't need some

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:31.599
other person that you go through, and I'm thankful for that reality that tells us how

00:19:31.719 --> 00:19:37.559
He gave Himself a ransom for all. I'm thankful that Jesus died in my place and your place

00:19:37.559 --> 00:19:42.599
and that He rose conquering sin, death, and the grave, that He ever liveth to make intercession

00:19:42.599 --> 00:19:49.599
for us, that one day, one glorious day, He's coming back. And what a joy that is. And Paul

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:55.159
says as he's writing to Timothy, whereunto I am ordained a preacher and apostle. I speak

00:19:55.199 --> 00:20:01.199
the truth in Christ and lie not, a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity, faith

00:20:01.199 --> 00:20:01.559
and truth.

00:20:01.559 --> 00:20:07.399
truth, but then notice what Paul says in verse number eight after he's speaking about prayer

00:20:07.399 --> 00:20:11.799
in the church and the importance and the priority and the fact that it's pleasing to God. Notice

00:20:11.799 --> 00:20:20.439
what he says, I will therefore that men pray everywhere lifting up holy hands without wrath

00:20:20.439 --> 00:20:25.879
and doubting. Can I tell you this morning that prayer is going to require a plan. You're not

00:20:25.879 --> 00:20:34.359
going to pray by accident. You really aren't. I never pray by accident. I just don't. If I just

00:20:34.359 --> 00:20:39.879
jump into my day and I just get into it and all sorts of things happen and I get emails and text

00:20:39.879 --> 00:20:44.839
messages and phone calls and the kind of days that you have and you have so many things going on,

00:20:44.839 --> 00:20:52.039
the busyness of life, the reality is that if I don't have a time and a purpose and a plan,

00:20:52.759 --> 00:20:57.959
it gets away from us. And all of a sudden, we look at the clock and we say, man, I haven't

00:20:57.959 --> 00:21:03.079
even prayed yet. I haven't had my time with the Lord yet. Then we've got to have a plan.

00:21:03.719 --> 00:21:09.479
We've got to make it a priority. This morning, before I ever even, I walked through the front

00:21:09.479 --> 00:21:15.239
door this morning from the fellowship hall. It's closer to my house and just joking with you guys,

00:21:15.239 --> 00:21:19.000
amen. But I walked through that door. I walked through there so I could take care of a couple

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.680
things over there actually. And then before I ever went to my office this morning, I stopped

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:28.759
here and prayed. I spent a season in prayer right there this morning. Why? Because once I go to my

00:21:28.759 --> 00:21:35.959
office, man, there's all kinds of stuff going on. We've got to have a plan. Let me say this.

00:21:35.959 --> 00:21:41.879
When we think about this evaluation this morning and we think about the place of prayer in our

00:21:41.879 --> 00:21:45.799
lives, I want to look at it from two aspects. All of that really was just introduction.

00:21:46.279 --> 00:21:49.799
And I know it's our passage of Scripture. It was really just introduction. And some of you say,

00:21:49.799 --> 00:21:54.519
my notebook's full already. It's 11.20 already. I know. I'll try to keep it brief.

00:21:55.720 --> 00:22:01.079
From two perspectives, number one, the place of prayer in our lives personally,

00:22:02.439 --> 00:22:09.079
personally, each one of us evaluating our own lives. I would ask this question this morning.

00:22:09.079 --> 00:22:12.839
I've asked it of myself and I would ask you to ask yourself,

00:22:14.199 --> 00:22:23.000
what words would best describe our prayer life? If we were to honestly evaluate our prayer lives

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:29.080
personally in the place of prayer in our lives, what words would best describe it?

00:22:31.239 --> 00:22:37.639
I'm not even going to provide you any suggestions. I'd rather you just evaluate and ask the Lord to

00:22:37.639 --> 00:22:45.160
help you evaluate. God, how best would my prayer life be described? I want you to turn to the book

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:50.039
of Acts, if you will, and I want you to look at an example. The example is of Paul at this

00:22:50.039 --> 00:22:56.839
particular time, Acts chapter 9. His name is still Saul. But I want you to think about this personally

00:22:56.839 --> 00:23:05.239
from this evaluation. What place does prayer have in my life personally? And I want you to think

00:23:05.239 --> 00:23:11.319
about the Apostle Paul. I want you to notice in Acts chapter 9, we're familiar with the passage of

00:23:11.319 --> 00:23:15.800
Scripture and he's journeying. He comes near to Damascus according to verse number three and

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:22.679
there's a bright light that shines from heaven. We find that the Lord speaks to him. He hears this

00:23:22.679 --> 00:23:32.440
voice in verse number four, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? We find that the response is,

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:39.639
who art thou, Lord? And then he asked the question after Jesus tells him, I am Jesus whom

00:23:39.639 --> 00:23:46.119
thou persecutest. He then says, what wilt thou have me to do? He says, Lord, what wilt thou have

00:23:46.119 --> 00:23:52.360
me to do? And the Bible tells us in verse number six that the response, the Lord says to him, arise

00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:59.399
and go into the city and it shall be told thee what thou must do. That's interesting because God's

00:23:59.399 --> 00:24:05.239
going to speak to someone else here in just a moment as we go through the passage and Ananias

00:24:05.239 --> 00:24:11.479
is going to receive this instruction. But I want you to see that Jesus told him to go to the city

00:24:11.479 --> 00:24:16.839
and see and go there and it shall be told thee what thou must do. Notice in verse number seven,

00:24:16.839 --> 00:24:21.720
the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man. And Saul

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:27.239
arose from the earth and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man, but they led him by the hand and

00:24:27.239 --> 00:24:33.320
brought him into Damascus. And he was there three days. He was three days without sight, it says,

00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:39.880
and neither did eat nor drink. Notice verse number 10, there was a certain disciple at Damascus named

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:46.200
Ananias. And to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias. And he said, behold, I am here, Lord.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:54.279
Notice what the Lord says, arise and go into the street, which is called straight and inquire in

00:24:54.279 --> 00:25:06.200
the house of Judas for one called Saul of Tarsus, for behold, he prayeth. He prayeth.

00:25:07.959 --> 00:25:13.639
What was Paul doing? I understand Saul, we refer to him as Paul. He was praying. Let me ask you in

00:25:13.639 --> 00:25:19.239
verse number six, did Jesus tell him to go pray? Actually didn't. It's not recorded that Jesus

00:25:19.239 --> 00:25:27.880
said, go into the city and pray. But Paul's praying. He's praying. Jesus told him, it shall

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:33.399
be told thee what thou must do. We can only assume what it is that Paul was praying, the direction in

00:25:33.399 --> 00:25:38.679
which he was seeking. We understand that he met the Lord. His life was changed. He was saved. This

00:25:38.679 --> 00:25:44.359
is his testimony of salvation in this passage of Scripture. We find that the Bible tells us,

00:25:44.359 --> 00:25:48.760
as you continue reading on, that Ananias is concerned. He's saying, listen, we know about

00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:55.000
this guy and you really want me to go. And we find that the Lord graciously speaks to Ananias and

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:00.839
tells him that he's chosen. Notice in verse number 15, after the objection, the Bible says that the

00:26:00.839 --> 00:26:06.839
Lord said unto him, go thy way for he is a chosen vessel unto me to bear my name before the Gentiles

00:26:06.839 --> 00:26:11.320
and kings and the children of Israel. For I will show him how great things he must suffer for my

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:18.040
name's sake. And Ananias went his way, entered into the house, and putting his hands on him,

00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:23.880
said, brother, saw the Lord, even Jesus, that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest,

00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:27.720
hath sent me, that thou mightest receive thy sight and be filled with the Holy Ghost. And

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:31.639
we see that he then preaches and all that takes place. And of course, we're familiar with the life

00:26:31.639 --> 00:26:37.079
of Paul. But I want you to just think for a moment as we evaluate our lives personally and how Paul,

00:26:37.079 --> 00:26:42.359
right after his conversion, that when Jesus speaks to Ananias and says, listen, Ananias,

00:26:42.359 --> 00:26:46.600
I have a task for you, and I want you to go into the city, and he tells him what street to go to,

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:50.919
and he tells me he's going to go to a house, and you're going to find one named Saul, and he's

00:26:50.919 --> 00:26:59.880
praying. That's powerful to me. It's impactful to me to see the response of Saul just after his

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:06.200
conversion that he's praying. We know much about the Apostle Paul. We read of his missionary

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:12.200
journeys. We read much of his letters, and we read in those letters how that under the inspiration

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:17.880
of the Holy Spirit of God that he tells those recipients, whether they be individuals or

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:26.119
whether they be churches, he tells them how he's praying for them regularly. Paul says,

00:27:26.119 --> 00:27:30.119
I'm praying for you. And he doesn't just say, I'm praying for you, but he tells them how

00:27:30.839 --> 00:27:33.880
he's praying for them. Paul is a man of prayer.

00:27:35.959 --> 00:27:39.399
Paul understood the importance of prayer. He understood that in his life there was a priority

00:27:39.399 --> 00:27:46.440
placed upon prayer. And we find that Paul is praying here in Acts 9, and we find that that's

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:52.600
his response, and we find that that becomes a pattern in his life, and not a pattern such as

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:58.119
rote religion, not a pattern as in, I said my prayers, quote unquote. That's not the idea of

00:27:58.119 --> 00:28:05.639
praying. It's not rote religion. I'm talking to my Father. Amen? I belong to Him. I've been

00:28:05.639 --> 00:28:11.480
adopted in His family. We mentioned last week, or two weeks ago from 1 John, how that He spoke

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:16.200
about the little children and the young men and the fathers, and we spoke about the little children,

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:20.919
how that at salvation, there's just a couple of things that we learn right away. Number one,

00:28:20.919 --> 00:28:28.279
our sins are forgiven. Number two, He's my Father, and I'm speaking to Him. It's not some recorded

00:28:28.279 --> 00:28:32.919
prayer. It's not some printed out, I just take a prayer book, and I just pray these prayers,

00:28:32.919 --> 00:28:38.200
and they're just vain repetitions. No, it's not praying so that someone could look at me. By the

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:43.000
way, Jesus spoke of those religious leaders that prayed in that manner, and He said they have their

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.880
reward. You know what their reward was? The recognition of man. But He said, when you pray,

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:57.880
enter into your closet. Amen? And we pray to our Father. We pour our heart out unto Him. Last

00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:03.000
Sunday morning in Sunday school, Psalm 62.8, we didn't deal with a miracle. We've been dealing

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.479
with miracles, but God just impressed that passage of Scripture, that verse of Scripture,

00:29:07.479 --> 00:29:11.559
upon my heart. I couldn't get away from it all week, and we dealt with it last Sunday morning

00:29:11.559 --> 00:29:17.000
in Sunday school, and how the psalmist told us that we're to trust in Him at all times, and we're to

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:27.000
pour our heart out before Him. Hannah did that. David did that on more than one occasion. The

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:32.039
people of God that I mentioned by way of introduction this morning, that testimony of

00:29:32.039 --> 00:29:36.279
answered prayer, they pour their heart out to God. Why? For He's a refuge for us.

00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:43.320
You don't need a prayer book that has some recorded prayers that someone wrote down.

00:29:44.039 --> 00:29:49.880
You just need to pour your heart out to God. Paul's praying. Paul tells the people that he

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:54.679
ministers to that he's praying for him. Paul asks the people that he's ministering to to pray for

00:29:54.679 --> 00:30:01.479
him. Often throughout the Scriptures, you find that Paul will ask the question. In fact, in Ephesians 6,

00:30:01.479 --> 00:30:03.679
when he talks about after the armor of God

00:30:03.679 --> 00:30:06.399
that I mentioned earlier, how that he says praying always,

00:30:06.399 --> 00:30:08.839
he then specifically says, and pray for me.

00:30:10.439 --> 00:30:13.479
He asked the believers in Thessalonica this way.

00:30:13.479 --> 00:30:16.999
He says, brethren, pray for us.

00:30:16.999 --> 00:30:19.119
He tells the believers in the church in Colossae

00:30:19.119 --> 00:30:21.459
to pray for him and to pray for them

00:30:21.459 --> 00:30:23.239
that the doors would be opened,

00:30:23.239 --> 00:30:25.319
that he would speak with boldness

00:30:25.319 --> 00:30:27.259
the way that he's supposed to speak.

00:30:28.359 --> 00:30:31.379
No wonder in 1 Timothy 2, in verse number eight,

00:30:31.379 --> 00:30:36.339
he says, I will therefore that men pray everywhere,

00:30:36.339 --> 00:30:39.239
lifting up holy hands without wrath and doubting.

00:30:39.239 --> 00:30:41.979
Paul understood the importance of prayer.

00:30:41.979 --> 00:30:44.299
What a great example for us this morning.

00:30:44.299 --> 00:30:46.799
When we evaluate our lives personally,

00:30:48.459 --> 00:30:51.579
personally, what place does prayer have in my life?

00:30:51.579 --> 00:30:54.019
Number two, and I'll be done with this this morning,

00:30:54.019 --> 00:30:58.859
when I evaluate prayer and when I ask the question,

00:30:58.859 --> 00:31:01.339
the place of prayer in our lives,

00:31:02.179 --> 00:31:05.819
yes, personally, but number two, corporately, corporately.

00:31:05.819 --> 00:31:08.899
I mentioned this two, three weeks ago now,

00:31:08.899 --> 00:31:11.499
the first Sunday that we started praying before our service,

00:31:11.499 --> 00:31:14.979
we start with a song and then we have a season of prayer.

00:31:14.979 --> 00:31:17.539
I believe God's pleased with that, by the way.

00:31:17.539 --> 00:31:21.139
It encourages my heart to hear the voices of people praying.

00:31:22.179 --> 00:31:26.359
How sweet that must be in the ears of God, amen?

00:31:27.519 --> 00:31:30.739
Jesus said this in Matthew 21 in verse number 13,

00:31:31.139 --> 00:31:33.059
and this is the verse that I said that Sunday morning

00:31:33.059 --> 00:31:35.939
that we first changed the order of our services

00:31:35.939 --> 00:31:38.599
and made this emphasis on prayer corporately.

00:31:38.599 --> 00:31:42.439
He said, by house shall be called the house of prayer.

00:31:43.259 --> 00:31:44.979
And just in case we weren't clear

00:31:44.979 --> 00:31:47.559
as to what house he was speaking of,

00:31:47.559 --> 00:31:51.019
we find that in 1 Timothy chapter three in verse number 15,

00:31:51.019 --> 00:31:52.979
that the word of God plainly teaches

00:31:52.979 --> 00:31:57.979
that the house of God is the church of the living God, amen?

00:31:58.139 --> 00:31:59.399
Amen?

00:31:59.399 --> 00:32:01.699
So he wasn't specifically just speaking

00:32:01.699 --> 00:32:05.099
about the temple, his house.

00:32:05.099 --> 00:32:06.419
This is God's house.

00:32:06.419 --> 00:32:07.779
You know that the Lord Jesus Christ

00:32:07.779 --> 00:32:09.099
is the head of the church?

00:32:10.699 --> 00:32:11.899
Someone was asking me recently

00:32:11.899 --> 00:32:16.139
about the church polity in a Baptist church.

00:32:16.139 --> 00:32:18.539
And the church polity in a Baptist church

00:32:18.539 --> 00:32:21.579
differs from church polity in some other churches.

00:32:21.579 --> 00:32:22.899
I began to explain some things,

00:32:22.899 --> 00:32:24.019
and I said first and foremost,

00:32:24.019 --> 00:32:27.959
the Lord Jesus Christ is the head of the church, amen?

00:32:28.819 --> 00:32:29.939
I'm thankful for that.

00:32:29.939 --> 00:32:32.059
It's his church.

00:32:32.059 --> 00:32:36.539
And he said, my house shall be a house of prayer.

00:32:36.539 --> 00:32:38.579
Should be a house of prayer.

00:32:38.579 --> 00:32:40.059
I want you to think about the example

00:32:40.059 --> 00:32:43.859
when we think about the place of prayer in our lives,

00:32:43.859 --> 00:32:45.579
not just personally but corporately.

00:32:45.579 --> 00:32:47.619
Turn to Acts 12, if you will.

00:32:47.619 --> 00:32:49.819
We're in Acts nine looking at the life of Paul,

00:32:49.819 --> 00:32:51.419
but now I want you to look in Acts 12

00:32:51.419 --> 00:32:54.499
and the context of Acts chapter number 12

00:32:54.499 --> 00:32:56.179
is the situation with Peter.

00:32:56.179 --> 00:32:58.299
We know that James has already been killed.

00:32:58.299 --> 00:32:59.579
According to verse number two,

00:32:59.579 --> 00:33:02.699
Herod's killed James, and then he takes Peter,

00:33:02.699 --> 00:33:05.139
and he's intending to kill Peter as well.

00:33:05.139 --> 00:33:07.819
And we know that that's taking place.

00:33:07.819 --> 00:33:09.819
And Herod, why does he wanna kill Peter?

00:33:09.819 --> 00:33:11.799
Well, he saw that it pleased the people,

00:33:11.799 --> 00:33:14.899
the Jews in particular, that he killed James,

00:33:14.899 --> 00:33:16.859
and so therefore he takes Peter,

00:33:16.859 --> 00:33:18.279
according to verse number three.

00:33:18.279 --> 00:33:21.619
But I want you to think of what takes place here

00:33:21.619 --> 00:33:23.199
in Acts chapter number 12.

00:33:23.199 --> 00:33:25.299
Notice the Bible says in verse number five,

00:33:25.299 --> 00:33:28.059
Peter therefore was kept in prison.

00:33:29.139 --> 00:33:30.459
He was kept in prison.

00:33:30.459 --> 00:33:32.859
He was gonna be there for a short period of time,

00:33:32.859 --> 00:33:35.379
and then after which we understand

00:33:35.379 --> 00:33:37.779
that Herod would bring him forth to kill him.

00:33:38.779 --> 00:33:42.419
And the Bible tells us in Acts 12 in verse number five,

00:33:42.419 --> 00:33:44.379
I want you to notice, it says Peter therefore

00:33:44.379 --> 00:33:47.039
was kept in prison, but then notice the next phrase,

00:33:47.039 --> 00:33:51.499
but prayer was made without ceasing

00:33:51.499 --> 00:33:55.519
of the church unto God for him.

00:33:58.779 --> 00:34:01.779
As you know, often I like to, as I read

00:34:01.779 --> 00:34:03.359
and as I preach the word of God,

00:34:03.359 --> 00:34:06.699
I like to put myself in the setting.

00:34:06.699 --> 00:34:08.579
We did that a little bit this morning in Sunday school

00:34:08.579 --> 00:34:09.579
as we looked at that miracle,

00:34:09.579 --> 00:34:13.019
and let's just kind of be there and see what's happening.

00:34:13.019 --> 00:34:15.579
And this morning when I look at this passage of Scripture,

00:34:15.579 --> 00:34:18.059
and as I have looked at this passage over the years,

00:34:18.059 --> 00:34:20.099
I put myself in the setting,

00:34:20.099 --> 00:34:22.179
and I see the church of God,

00:34:22.179 --> 00:34:24.859
and I see the events that are taking place,

00:34:24.859 --> 00:34:27.099
and James is already killed.

00:34:27.099 --> 00:34:29.259
Herod's taken a sword and he's killed him.

00:34:29.259 --> 00:34:30.759
That's pretty serious, right?

00:34:31.899 --> 00:34:33.459
And he saw that the Jews were pleased,

00:34:33.459 --> 00:34:34.699
so he says, well, I'm gonna take Peter too,

00:34:34.699 --> 00:34:36.699
and I'm gonna kill him.

00:34:36.699 --> 00:34:38.739
But because of some things that were taking place,

00:34:38.739 --> 00:34:39.979
I'm gonna put him in prison first,

00:34:39.979 --> 00:34:41.739
and then I'm gonna kill him afterwards.

00:34:41.739 --> 00:34:43.419
And we find that the Bible tells us

00:34:43.419 --> 00:34:47.259
that the church of God responded how, they prayed.

00:34:48.179 --> 00:34:50.379
Now, when I try to put myself in the position,

00:34:50.379 --> 00:34:53.459
I ask myself this question, how would I have responded?

00:34:55.739 --> 00:34:57.179
What would I have done?

00:34:58.819 --> 00:35:00.219
Who would I have called and said,

00:35:00.219 --> 00:35:02.979
hey, we gotta get a plan going to get Peter out of jail?

00:35:06.859 --> 00:35:08.459
And I start networking with people and say,

00:35:08.459 --> 00:35:09.739
hey, listen, I know you're good at this,

00:35:09.739 --> 00:35:10.659
and I know you're good at that,

00:35:10.659 --> 00:35:13.259
and you're a strong, big guy, and I want you on my team,

00:35:13.259 --> 00:35:14.579
and we gotta do this, that, and the other,

00:35:14.579 --> 00:35:15.899
and we're gonna get Peter out of jail, man.

00:35:16.179 --> 00:35:18.219
We're gonna get him out of prison.

00:35:18.219 --> 00:35:20.139
Isn't that how we operate sometimes?

00:35:20.139 --> 00:35:21.179
Seriously.

00:35:21.179 --> 00:35:23.179
It's just how we operate sometimes.

00:35:25.459 --> 00:35:26.779
We just immediately begin to think about,

00:35:26.779 --> 00:35:29.659
okay, what do I need to do to solve this problem?

00:35:29.659 --> 00:35:31.819
What do I need to do to take care of this?

00:35:31.819 --> 00:35:34.339
James is killed, Peter's in prison, man.

00:35:34.339 --> 00:35:36.659
Some maybe flee because, man, I'm gonna be next.

00:35:36.659 --> 00:35:38.739
I don't wanna get killed.

00:35:38.739 --> 00:35:40.019
Some are gonna try to figure out how to,

00:35:40.019 --> 00:35:42.459
no, but the Bible tells us that,

00:35:42.459 --> 00:35:44.459
but prayer was made without ceasing

00:35:44.459 --> 00:35:46.499
of the church and to God for him.

00:35:46.499 --> 00:35:48.379
They responded in prayer.

00:35:48.379 --> 00:35:50.179
They responded in prayer,

00:35:50.179 --> 00:35:52.179
and when we see how the church prayed,

00:35:52.179 --> 00:35:53.819
the Bible continues, and it says,

00:35:53.819 --> 00:35:54.659
in verse number six,

00:35:54.659 --> 00:35:56.579
and when Herod would have brought him forth,

00:35:56.579 --> 00:35:59.339
the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers

00:35:59.339 --> 00:36:01.219
bound with two chains in the keepers

00:36:01.219 --> 00:36:03.059
before the door kept the prison,

00:36:03.059 --> 00:36:05.979
I mean, he was pretty shut in, was he not?

00:36:05.979 --> 00:36:07.499
We'd have had to have a pretty elaborate,

00:36:07.499 --> 00:36:10.219
sophisticated plan to break Peter out,

00:36:10.219 --> 00:36:13.699
but God, he's over all of that stuff.

00:36:14.659 --> 00:36:17.539
And here, the Bible tells us that they were,

00:36:17.539 --> 00:36:18.459
I mean, it was secure.

00:36:18.459 --> 00:36:21.019
It was as secure as it could be.

00:36:21.019 --> 00:36:21.859
In verse number seven,

00:36:21.859 --> 00:36:24.419
behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him,

00:36:24.419 --> 00:36:25.859
and a light shined in the prison,

00:36:25.859 --> 00:36:28.819
and he smote Peter on the side, I love that,

00:36:28.819 --> 00:36:30.259
and raised him up, saying,

00:36:30.259 --> 00:36:33.779
Arise up quickly, and his chains fell off from his hands.

00:36:35.499 --> 00:36:36.859
And the Bible tells us,

00:36:36.859 --> 00:36:38.019
the angel said unto him,

00:36:38.019 --> 00:36:42.059
Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals, and so he did.

00:36:42.059 --> 00:36:42.899
He saith unto him,

00:36:42.899 --> 00:36:45.459
Cast thy garment upon thee, and follow me.

00:36:45.459 --> 00:36:47.139
And he went out, and followed him,

00:36:47.139 --> 00:36:49.859
and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel,

00:36:49.859 --> 00:36:51.499
but thought he saw a vision.

00:36:51.499 --> 00:36:54.219
Now, let me ask you, pause just for a moment

00:36:54.219 --> 00:36:55.419
before we continue reading.

00:36:55.419 --> 00:36:57.459
What's the church doing?

00:36:57.459 --> 00:36:59.579
The church is still praying,

00:36:59.579 --> 00:37:01.899
because the Bible tells us in verse number five,

00:37:01.899 --> 00:37:04.459
but prayer was made without ceasing

00:37:04.459 --> 00:37:08.039
of the church unto God for him.

00:37:08.039 --> 00:37:09.939
The church is praying.

00:37:09.939 --> 00:37:11.979
They have an all-night prayer meeting.

00:37:12.779 --> 00:37:14.419
You know how well those are attended?

00:37:15.459 --> 00:37:16.379
Come to Wednesday night,

00:37:16.379 --> 00:37:17.699
and see how well those are attended.

00:37:17.699 --> 00:37:19.099
That'll give you an idea of how well

00:37:19.099 --> 00:37:21.519
an all-night prayer meeting would be attended.

00:37:21.519 --> 00:37:22.359
Amen?

00:37:23.299 --> 00:37:25.019
And it says this in verse number 10.

00:37:25.019 --> 00:37:27.979
When they were past the first and the second ward,

00:37:27.979 --> 00:37:30.979
they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city,

00:37:30.979 --> 00:37:32.939
which opened to them of his own accord,

00:37:32.939 --> 00:37:35.759
and they went out, and passed on through one street,

00:37:35.759 --> 00:37:37.939
and forthwith the angel departed from him.

00:37:37.939 --> 00:37:41.139
And when Peter was come to himself,

00:37:41.139 --> 00:37:42.099
this is what he said,

00:37:42.099 --> 00:37:45.899
now I know of a surety that the Lord hath sent his angel,

00:37:45.899 --> 00:37:47.939
and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod,

00:37:47.939 --> 00:37:51.419
and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews.

00:37:51.419 --> 00:37:52.859
When he had considered the thing,

00:37:52.859 --> 00:37:55.539
he came to the house of Mary, the mother of John,

00:37:55.539 --> 00:37:56.899
whose surname was Mark.

00:37:56.899 --> 00:37:57.859
What does it say?

00:37:57.859 --> 00:38:02.859
Where many were gathered together praying.

00:38:05.179 --> 00:38:06.379
They're praying.

00:38:08.779 --> 00:38:09.899
Evaluate it personally,

00:38:09.899 --> 00:38:12.059
but then evaluate it corporately.

00:38:12.059 --> 00:38:14.699
What place does prayer have?

00:38:14.699 --> 00:38:15.659
Corporately.

00:38:20.179 --> 00:38:23.379
As we read in Acts chapter number 12,

00:38:24.299 --> 00:38:26.179
and you read from verse number six

00:38:26.179 --> 00:38:28.779
down to where I stopped in verse number 12,

00:38:28.779 --> 00:38:33.779
all that that you're reading of that miraculous deliverance,

00:38:33.899 --> 00:38:35.880
I would argue this morning

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:39.559
that that is God's hand moving

00:38:39.559 --> 00:38:42.179
in response to the church praying.

00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:44.279
Amen?

00:38:45.279 --> 00:38:50.279
The hand of God moving miraculously, powerfully,

00:38:50.639 --> 00:38:53.599
beyond what the church could ever do.

00:38:53.599 --> 00:38:55.000
Remember the Bible tells us,

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:56.459
I mentioned the prayer promise,

00:38:56.459 --> 00:38:58.239
that He is able to do exceeding abundantly

00:38:58.239 --> 00:39:00.019
above all that we ask or think.

00:39:00.019 --> 00:39:02.159
Now listen, sometimes we can ask or think

00:39:02.159 --> 00:39:03.239
some great things,

00:39:03.279 --> 00:39:06.440
but we might have a little bit of wavering,

00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:10.279
and He tells us that we're to pray without wrath and doubting,

00:39:10.279 --> 00:39:13.359
but we find here that these people are gathered praying.

00:39:13.359 --> 00:39:15.880
No doubt they're praying that God would move.

00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:18.839
Perhaps some have prayed that God would deliver Peter,

00:39:18.839 --> 00:39:21.079
but they can't even begin to imagine

00:39:21.079 --> 00:39:23.000
how God would deliver Peter.

00:39:24.119 --> 00:39:28.000
Because Herod is powerful, right?

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:32.039
And Herod has already killed James,

00:39:32.039 --> 00:39:34.199
and now Herod has taken Peter,

00:39:34.199 --> 00:39:35.959
and Herod has this plan,

00:39:35.959 --> 00:39:37.880
and Peter is in prison,

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:39.079
and the guards are there,

00:39:39.079 --> 00:39:41.399
and the wards are shut.

00:39:41.399 --> 00:39:42.399
But they're praying.

00:39:43.839 --> 00:39:44.679
They're praying.

00:39:45.799 --> 00:39:48.159
And Peter, according to verse number 13,

00:39:48.159 --> 00:39:49.440
he came, it says,

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:53.039
and as Peter knocked at the door of the gate,

00:39:53.039 --> 00:39:54.599
this is always make you laugh,

00:39:55.919 --> 00:39:59.839
a damsel came to hearken named Rhoda.

00:39:59.839 --> 00:40:01.260
So Peter's knocking.

00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:09.100
It says, when she knew Peter's voice, she opened not the gate for gladness, but ran

00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:12.460
in and told how Peter stood before the gate.

00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:15.560
She left him out there because she was so excited.

00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:16.660
But then guess what?

00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:25.400
They say, nah, thou art mad, you're crazy.

00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:29.220
She constantly affirmed that it was even so.

00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:32.220
Then said they, it is his angel.

00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:33.740
But Peter continued knocking.

00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:38.220
I don't know how long he was out there knocking, but he just kept knocking.

00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:48.780
It says, when they opened the door and saw him, they were astonished, they were astonished.

00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:52.740
God worked, God answered prayer.

00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:55.120
You've been praying.

00:40:55.120 --> 00:41:00.680
And then the Bible tells us, but he, in verse 17, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold

00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:01.680
their peace.

00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:03.120
Why do you think he had to quiet them down?

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:04.120
Why?

00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:07.000
Because they're excited.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:14.440
Notice what it says, declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison.

00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:17.440
He said, go, show these things unto James and the brethren, and he departed and went

00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:18.600
into another place.

00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:22.780
But I want you to just think about this in verse number 17, that when he declares unto

00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:28.260
them how that the Lord had brought him out of the prison, that was a direct response

00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:33.540
of their praying, of their praying.

00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:39.340
I don't know that Peter was aware of the prayer meeting that was taking place.

00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:45.420
I know that as they were praying, they weren't aware of how God was delivering Peter until

00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:47.660
he came there.

00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:55.740
And this morning, as we think about our lives and evaluating and asking ourselves the question,

00:41:55.740 --> 00:42:03.180
what place does prayer really have in my life, in my life personally?

00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:06.580
Does it have, is there a priority that's placed upon prayer?

00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:08.260
Do I have a plan?

00:42:08.260 --> 00:42:15.140
What is it that would best describe, what words would best describe my prayer life?

00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:17.660
Prayers work.

00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:18.660
Prayers work.

00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:27.740
But then when we evaluate prayer corporately, Jesus said, my house shall be a house of prayer.

00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:32.940
I no longer desire for prayer to just be a bookend to our services.

00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:35.020
I don't.

00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:39.900
I intend with the help of God that we'll do exactly what we did this morning, we'll begin

00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:46.380
each service with a season of prayer, praying that God would move and work.

00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:51.100
Listen, those moments of prayer, they really aren't to pray for somebody that's sick.

00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:55.140
They're not to pray for somebody that's whatever.

00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:58.940
It's very specific prayer for what's at hand.

00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:03.540
Oh God, use the song service this morning.

00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:05.180
Speak to my heart through the songs.

00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:08.420
Be glorified as we sing praise to Thy name.

00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:11.260
God, would You use the preacher this morning?

00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:14.780
Fill him with Your power to deliver the Word of God.

00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:17.300
God, help me to be attentive.

00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:24.260
Help me to long to hear and to get something from You this morning, God.

00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:28.780
And we use that time of prayer for that purpose.

00:43:28.780 --> 00:43:33.020
We really seek the face of God for how He would be exalted and glorified.

00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:37.380
That if there's somebody that's lost in our midst that the Holy Spirit of God would speak

00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:43.020
to them and would convict them of their sin and of Christ's righteousness, of judgment

00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:48.620
to come, that today would be the day of salvation in their lives.

00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:53.580
For the saying that God would stir us up, that God would change us, that God would do

00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:57.580
something in our lives, that He'd be glorified.

00:43:57.580 --> 00:44:02.220
That's the purpose of that prayer time.

00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:13.160
With the help of God, I seek to make prayer a priority, not only in my life personally,

00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:15.060
but corporately as a church.

00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:22.100
As I mentioned a moment ago, and it's worth repeating, I no longer desire for prayer to

00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:25.260
simply be bookends to our service.

00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:26.860
I don't.

00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:30.460
Here's what someone said.

00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:39.779
Someone said this about prayer, the pulpit of this day is weak in praying.

00:44:39.779 --> 00:44:51.380
The pride of learning is against the dependent humility of prayer.

00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:56.460
When I read that, it just…

00:44:56.460 --> 00:45:00.779
I understand that I've been given a responsibility to preach the Word.

00:45:00.779 --> 00:45:03.180
That's my responsibility.

00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:07.220
But God said, my house shall be a house of prayer.

00:45:07.220 --> 00:45:13.180
And if we're not praying like we're supposed to, we can preach, we can get the greatest

00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:17.540
preachers that walk the face of this earth.

00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:23.600
But if we're not prayed up and we're not ready to receive, who's a better preacher

00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:25.860
than Jesus?

00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:26.860
Nobody.

00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:29.460
But you know what Jesus said?

00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:31.460
He said, you've heard my words, but you're doing them not.

00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:34.700
You're like a foolish man.

00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:36.540
There's others that heard His words and they did it.

00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:38.619
He said, I liken you to a wise man.

00:45:38.619 --> 00:45:43.100
We sing the song, wise men build his house upon the rock, the foolish man, no, right?

00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:45.100
The floods come, so on and so forth.

00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:52.860
The response, the tenderness of the reception, it wasn't in the message that Jesus delivered.

00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:58.500
It was the same message from God in flesh.

00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:04.380
This morning, I want to just open up the curtain a little bit to help you understand why we're

00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:07.860
placing a greater priority on prayer.

00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:10.680
I mentioned this three weeks ago.

00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:14.420
I want to be teachable.

00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:21.420
I love preaching the Word of God, but when I heard that message a few weeks ago and someone

00:46:21.460 --> 00:46:28.540
used that analogy of prayer being bookends in our service, I was like, Lord, forgive

00:46:28.540 --> 00:46:29.860
me.

00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:34.700
Because quite honestly, we pray, say, Lord, bless our services.

00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:39.660
And then we have our service, and then we say, Lord, thank You for blessing our service

00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:41.900
this morning.

00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:47.220
What place does prayer have in my life, personally and corporately?

00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:48.220
Let's pray.

00:46:48.220 --> 00:46:49.580
Father, we love You.

00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:52.020
Lord, we thank You for loving us.

00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:53.940
Thank You for the Word of God.

00:46:53.940 --> 00:47:02.700
Lord, we thank You for the countless promises throughout the entirety of Your Word with

00:47:02.700 --> 00:47:10.260
regard to prayer, the encouragement that we receive by the way in which You've answered

00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:12.300
and worked.

00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:17.339
As we read secular history and read church history, Bible history of those that have

00:47:17.339 --> 00:47:22.420
seen Your hand move and work, God, how we're encouraged to know that You're a God who

00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:26.059
hears and answers prayer.

00:47:26.059 --> 00:47:32.900
This morning, all of those truths and all of those realities must have an impact in

00:47:32.900 --> 00:47:36.980
our lives.

00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:39.059
We must be doers of the Word and not hearers only.

00:47:39.059 --> 00:47:49.779
We must come to the place where we truly evaluate where prayer is in our lives, the

00:47:49.779 --> 00:47:55.740
place of prayer, personally and corporately.

00:47:55.740 --> 00:48:01.860
Lord, I pray that Your Holy Spirit would move and work as only You can.

00:48:01.860 --> 00:48:05.320
We don't want to rush You this morning, Lord.

00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:06.760
Help us do business with You.

00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:08.880
Help us to respond.

00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:12.119
God, help us to make some commitments.

00:48:12.119 --> 00:48:20.600
Help us, Lord, to renew some commitments with regard to prayer.

00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:25.880
We want to see You move and work, and God, we want to be able to hear accounts like we

00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:38.400
read in Acts 12, You moving and working in distinct, miraculous ways as a result of prayer.

00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:43.679
We commit these moments to You and ask that You'd work as only You can.

00:48:43.679 --> 00:48:45.239
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:48:45.239 --> 00:48:47.000
Would You stand with me?

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:48.160
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:49.840
Kimberly is going to play quietly on the piano.

00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:52.239
The altar is open.

00:48:52.239 --> 00:48:54.000
Thank God for prayer.

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.679
Make a commitment to the Lord.

00:48:56.679 --> 00:49:01.040
Evaluate your life, your prayer life, as Kimberly plays the altar is open.
