1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,559
number two, Revelation chapter number two.

2
00:00:03,559 --> 00:00:06,639
And I know in the bulletin it says the church of Ephesus

3
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:08,119
is the title for the message

4
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:10,640
and that it's Revelation two, one through seven.

5
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,119
But I'm gonna tell you right at the start,

6
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:14,520
we're not gonna make it through the whole message tonight.

7
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,239
And it's just, I'm not gonna hurry through.

8
00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:19,760
There's a lot of really good things

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,260
that I wanna get from this.

10
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,159
I don't wanna be in a hurry and just rush through it.

11
00:00:25,159 --> 00:00:26,920
And so we're gonna look at several things

12
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,200
as we begin looking at these letters

13
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,919
to the seven churches in Asia.

14
00:00:32,919 --> 00:00:35,119
You remember in chapter number one

15
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:37,680
that God had given the instruction

16
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,220
beginning in verse number four,

17
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,759
John to the seven churches, which are in Asia,

18
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:43,959
specifically in verse number 11,

19
00:00:43,959 --> 00:00:46,240
the Lord Jesus Christ says I am Alpha and Omega,

20
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,319
the first and the last, and what thou seest,

21
00:00:48,319 --> 00:00:51,459
write in a book and send it unto the seven churches,

22
00:00:51,459 --> 00:00:54,240
which are in Asia, into Ephesus, unto Smyrna,

23
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,319
unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira,

24
00:00:56,319 --> 00:00:58,520
and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia,

25
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,560
and unto Laodicea.

26
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,200
And so we begin looking in chapter number two,

27
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,580
and it's the entirety of chapters two and three

28
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,680
that give us these seven letters

29
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,599
that are written to the churches in Asia.

30
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:13,800
Now understand this is Asia Minor,

31
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,699
is the region of the world

32
00:01:15,699 --> 00:01:17,839
in which these churches were located.

33
00:01:17,839 --> 00:01:20,419
And we find that today, if you were to look at a map,

34
00:01:20,419 --> 00:01:22,400
that would be modern day Turkey.

35
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,160
And that is the location of which

36
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,440
these seven churches were located.

37
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:30,260
And we find that this is the second part of the book.

38
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:33,239
We remember we mentioned in verse 19 of chapter one,

39
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:36,099
the Bible says write the things which thou hast seen,

40
00:01:36,099 --> 00:01:38,879
and that was section one, chapter one,

41
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:42,199
and the things which are, which is chapters two and three.

42
00:01:42,199 --> 00:01:45,120
And then the following, the end of the verse says,

43
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,519
and the things which shall be hereafter.

44
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:50,599
That begins the third section.

45
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:52,339
The outline for the book is provided to us.

46
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:54,120
It's there in Revelation 119.

47
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,660
And that third and final section of the book of Revelation

48
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:58,260
begins in chapter four,

49
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,620
and goes all the way through chapter 22.

50
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,959
And so we find that we're beginning that second point,

51
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:06,099
if you will, of the outline

52
00:02:06,099 --> 00:02:08,940
that God has provided to us in his word.

53
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,179
And the Bible says in verse number one of Revelation two,

54
00:02:12,179 --> 00:02:15,860
unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write,

55
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,440
these things saith he that holdeth the seven stars

56
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,699
in his right hand,

57
00:02:19,699 --> 00:02:23,899
who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks.

58
00:02:23,899 --> 00:02:25,839
We'll get further into the message this evening,

59
00:02:25,839 --> 00:02:28,179
or into the text as we go through the message.

60
00:02:28,179 --> 00:02:30,220
But as we move into the second section

61
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,660
of the book of Revelation,

62
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,660
we find that the Lord Jesus Christ,

63
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,440
who is the head of the church,

64
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,100
is now going to address these seven churches.

65
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,259
It's interesting to me, and I hope to you as well,

66
00:02:41,259 --> 00:02:43,139
that the first church that's addressed

67
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:45,100
happens to be the church

68
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,619
that we're really the most familiar with.

69
00:02:47,619 --> 00:02:49,779
And if you begin to look at the seven churches

70
00:02:49,779 --> 00:02:52,139
that are listed, the church of Ephesus

71
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:54,580
is the church that we know the most about.

72
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,440
And we find that it was this church

73
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,259
that God has provided to us much information

74
00:02:59,259 --> 00:03:02,020
within the New Testament with regard to this church.

75
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:05,020
It was Ephesus that ministry began,

76
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,979
according to Acts chapter number 18,

77
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,380
during Paul's second missionary journey.

78
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,460
He came there to Ephesus,

79
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,779
but the Bible tells us that he was there

80
00:03:14,779 --> 00:03:17,440
just for a very brief period of time,

81
00:03:18,259 --> 00:03:19,520
according to Acts chapter 18.

82
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,639
It was during that time when he was there

83
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:23,960
that he left Aquila and Priscilla,

84
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,199
and then he returned to Jerusalem.

85
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:29,559
But we find that in Acts 18 and verse 21,

86
00:03:29,559 --> 00:03:31,360
prior to his departure,

87
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,919
the Apostle Paul says that he would return

88
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:36,759
if the Lord allowed.

89
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:39,399
And I'm thankful that the Lord allowed the Apostle Paul

90
00:03:39,399 --> 00:03:41,660
to return to the city of Ephesus.

91
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,479
And he did, you begin reading in Acts chapter 19,

92
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,839
and you begin to see that there,

93
00:03:46,839 --> 00:03:48,960
during Paul's third missionary journey,

94
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,919
that he came back to Ephesus,

95
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:53,800
and he ministered there for nearly three years.

96
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,679
And what a blessing to think about

97
00:03:55,679 --> 00:03:57,440
the ministry there in Ephesus.

98
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,119
We know some things with regard to the city of Ephesus.

99
00:04:01,119 --> 00:04:05,460
It was a commercial, political, and religious center.

100
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:08,360
Of course, the great temple of Diana was there,

101
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,320
and the idol worship,

102
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,119
and you can read of what happened there in Acts 19

103
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:16,600
with regard to the ministry there in Ephesus,

104
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,320
and what great ministry it was.

105
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,899
The Bible would rehearse for us

106
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:22,079
and help us to see in Acts 19

107
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,359
the revival that took place in Ephesus,

108
00:04:24,359 --> 00:04:27,399
where people are thoroughly getting right with God,

109
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:29,940
and they're destroying their books,

110
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:34,720
and those books that were of curious arts, the Bible says.

111
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,279
And man, there was revival in the city of Ephesus,

112
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,640
and God was at work,

113
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,059
and God was using the Apostle Paul.

114
00:04:41,059 --> 00:04:42,739
We find that as you continue studying

115
00:04:42,739 --> 00:04:46,459
through the book of Acts in the 20th chapter,

116
00:04:46,459 --> 00:04:47,700
that it's the book of,

117
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:52,700
it's the church leaders of Ephesus that Paul calls for,

118
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,859
and he's going to give them some instruction.

119
00:04:55,859 --> 00:04:58,579
Acts chapter number 20 is a really,

120
00:04:58,579 --> 00:05:00,920
just a powerful passage of scripture

121
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,660
that gives us so much with regard

122
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,299
to the ministry of the Apostle Paul,

123
00:05:04,299 --> 00:05:07,679
and really his perspective and philosophy of ministry.

124
00:05:07,679 --> 00:05:10,140
We see it outlined in Acts chapter 20,

125
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,700
but who he's speaking to are the leaders

126
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,940
of this church of Ephesus,

127
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,500
and he could not make it back to Ephesus.

128
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,940
He was on his way to Jerusalem.

129
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:21,619
He had a timeline in which he was trying to get back,

130
00:05:21,619 --> 00:05:23,420
and he could not go to Ephesus,

131
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:26,820
so he called for the church leaders to meet him

132
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,540
while he was on his journey,

133
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,880
and he gathers with them,

134
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,019
and he has this meeting with them,

135
00:05:32,019 --> 00:05:33,380
and he instructs them,

136
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,299
and it's interesting.

137
00:05:34,299 --> 00:05:35,619
Hold your place here in Revelation,

138
00:05:35,619 --> 00:05:37,700
but look over to Acts 20, if you will,

139
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,500
and I want to give you two thoughts

140
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,619
that he gives Paul to these church leaders at Ephesus

141
00:05:43,619 --> 00:05:45,100
as he calls them,

142
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,119
and they gather together,

143
00:05:47,119 --> 00:05:49,700
and he gives them some instruction.

144
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,380
He gives them really two commands, if you will,

145
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,980
if we boil it all down.

146
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,260
In verse number 28,

147
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,920
notice the Bible says this.

148
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,820
Paul was rehearsing his ministry

149
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,260
and all that he did,

150
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:05,579
and how he was faithfully serving and teaching,

151
00:06:05,579 --> 00:06:07,500
and he declares in verse 26

152
00:06:08,299 --> 00:06:09,500
that he was pure from the blood of all men,

153
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,140
but in verse 28, notice what he says.

154
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,899
Take heed, therefore, unto yourselves,

155
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:16,660
and to all the flock over which the Holy Ghost

156
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,579
hath made you overseers.

157
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:20,779
And by the way, that's important for us to understand

158
00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:22,299
the work of the Holy Spirit,

159
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:23,820
the work of the Holy Ghost,

160
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:27,420
in calling and equipping church leaders.

161
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:31,079
We know that in the book of Ephesians in the fourth chapter,

162
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:34,600
God makes it clear that he gives as a gift

163
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,059
to a local church pastors,

164
00:06:37,059 --> 00:06:40,700
and what a joy to understand that God has designed.

165
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,500
We often use the term under-shepherd.

166
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,459
You're not gonna necessarily find that term in the Bible,

167
00:06:46,459 --> 00:06:49,619
but you will find that Jesus is the shepherd.

168
00:06:49,619 --> 00:06:51,779
He's the good shepherd, the chief shepherd,

169
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:55,299
and we have a responsibility to feed the flock of God

170
00:06:55,299 --> 00:06:58,059
and to fulfill that role the pastors do,

171
00:06:58,059 --> 00:07:01,459
and he says that the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers.

172
00:07:01,459 --> 00:07:04,660
Notice what he says, to feed the church of God

173
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:07,299
which he hath purchased with his own blood,

174
00:07:07,299 --> 00:07:09,380
and so really the first charge, if you will,

175
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:12,859
that Paul gives to these leaders of the church at Ephesus

176
00:07:12,859 --> 00:07:15,260
is to feed the church of God.

177
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,980
How do they feed the church of God?

178
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:20,299
Is it that they're to put on banquets and have meals?

179
00:07:20,299 --> 00:07:24,179
No, it's speaking about feeding the word of God,

180
00:07:24,179 --> 00:07:28,140
the bread of heaven, and breaking open the scriptures

181
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:32,820
and teaching by line upon line, precept upon precept,

182
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,380
and giving the truth of God's word.

183
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:39,859
We find that Peter references this, stay there in Acts 20,

184
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:41,480
but let me just mention very quickly

185
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,459
that in 1 Peter chapter five,

186
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:46,140
Peter says in verse number two,

187
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:49,160
feed the flock of God which is among you,

188
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,220
and so this is a consistent message

189
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,019
that's given to the leaders of the church.

190
00:07:54,019 --> 00:07:58,640
He tells them to feed, to give the truth of God's word.

191
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,980
What does Paul tell Timothy?

192
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,980
Remember, Timothy is in Ephesus ministering,

193
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:07,540
and he tells him in the fourth chapter, preach the word,

194
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:10,540
and he's giving him that mandate, and he tells him,

195
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,739
listen, there will come a time

196
00:08:12,739 --> 00:08:14,820
when they will not endure sound doctrine,

197
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,859
but it does not change the responsibility

198
00:08:17,859 --> 00:08:20,920
that you have as a leader, as a pastor,

199
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,739
to give the word of God, to preach the word of God,

200
00:08:24,739 --> 00:08:28,260
and we find that he gives a second charge, if you will,

201
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,260
in verses 29 and 30 here in Acts.

202
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,539
Notice the Bible says, for I know this,

203
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:36,940
that after my departing shall grievous wolves

204
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:40,659
enter in among you, not sparing the flock.

205
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:42,940
Also of your own selves shall men arise,

206
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,700
speaking perverse things,

207
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:49,219
to draw away disciples after them.

208
00:08:49,219 --> 00:08:50,940
He tells them to feed the church,

209
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,340
but then he tells them to protect the church.

210
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:57,520
Now I'm thankful that God is the ultimate protector,

211
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,760
that it's his church,

212
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,119
and I'm thankful that safety is of the Lord,

213
00:09:01,119 --> 00:09:03,880
but the pastor does have a responsibility

214
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:07,479
to provide not only the preaching and teaching

215
00:09:07,479 --> 00:09:10,080
of God's word, but to provide protection

216
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,260
for the flock of God, to give warning.

217
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,799
So often you read of the apostle Paul saying,

218
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:16,140
I'm warning you.

219
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,099
How do the warnings come?

220
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:22,539
Well, according to Psalm 19, the Bible speaks of itself

221
00:09:22,539 --> 00:09:25,960
in saying that by them thy servant is warned.

222
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,799
By what?

223
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:29,559
The law of the Lord, the precepts, the testimonies,

224
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:32,200
the word of God gives us warning.

225
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,760
And so how do we protect?

226
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,760
Well, we understand in the text in verse 29 in Acts 20

227
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,320
that there is external danger.

228
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,380
There's external danger.

229
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,840
The Bible says very clearly that he says,

230
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,119
I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves

231
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:50,619
enter in among you, not sparing the flock.

232
00:09:50,619 --> 00:09:53,200
And so there's an external danger,

233
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,059
and we have to be aware of that.

234
00:09:55,099 --> 00:09:58,140
There are times in which, in fact, just recently,

235
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,739
somebody mentioned about someone they had listened.

236
00:10:00,739 --> 00:10:03,139
to on some YouTube channel, and I said,

237
00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:05,279
hey listen, it was in my presence, and I said,

238
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,839
listen, you need to be careful listening to that individual

239
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,539
because there's some things that aren't right

240
00:10:10,539 --> 00:10:12,479
with what they say biblically.

241
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:13,919
What do we measure everything to?

242
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:16,919
To the Bible, and there's a lot of danger out there,

243
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:17,959
external danger.

244
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:19,559
Remember what Jude says,

245
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:24,519
that certain men have crept in unawares, all right?

246
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:26,959
And so they creep in to devour, to destroy,

247
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,359
to turn the grace of God, according to Jude,

248
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,659
into lasciviousness, and so we find that external danger,

249
00:10:33,659 --> 00:10:36,459
and I remember very distinctly having a conversation

250
00:10:36,459 --> 00:10:38,339
with a visitor to our church years ago

251
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:42,499
that was trying to peddle some pamphlets of information

252
00:10:42,499 --> 00:10:45,799
that were not aligned with what we believe biblically,

253
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:47,839
and I had to speak to that individual and say,

254
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,339
listen, you're not allowed to give any materials

255
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:52,639
out in our church without my permission.

256
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:55,479
And he was my senior by probably 50 years,

257
00:10:55,479 --> 00:10:58,259
and he looked at me and said, who do you think you are?

258
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,939
And I said, honestly, I don't think I'm anyone,

259
00:11:01,939 --> 00:11:04,219
but God called me to be the pastor of this church,

260
00:11:04,219 --> 00:11:06,059
and he's given me a responsibility,

261
00:11:06,059 --> 00:11:07,719
and the literature that you're distributing

262
00:11:07,719 --> 00:11:09,559
is not aligned with what we believe,

263
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:12,219
and therefore, you're not allowed to pass anything out

264
00:11:12,219 --> 00:11:13,699
without my permission.

265
00:11:13,699 --> 00:11:14,819
He didn't like it much,

266
00:11:14,819 --> 00:11:18,619
but that's the responsibility of a pastor.

267
00:11:18,619 --> 00:11:20,379
Not only the external danger,

268
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:21,859
but notice in verse number 30,

269
00:11:21,859 --> 00:11:25,219
the Bible says also of your own selves

270
00:11:25,219 --> 00:11:28,139
shall men arise speaking perverse things

271
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:29,759
to draw away disciples.

272
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:32,399
Notice what it says, after them.

273
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,599
There's external danger, but there's also internal danger,

274
00:11:36,599 --> 00:11:40,759
and we begin to understand that there's this responsibility,

275
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:44,519
this charge that was given to these leaders

276
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:47,759
of the church at Ephesus to feed the church

277
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:49,599
and to protect the church

278
00:11:49,599 --> 00:11:52,279
from the external and internal dangers.

279
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:54,879
We also know from Ephesians chapter six

280
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:56,519
that God gives the instruction

281
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:58,379
to put on the whole armor of God

282
00:11:58,379 --> 00:12:02,219
because of the spiritual warfare in which we are engaged.

283
00:12:03,179 --> 00:12:05,899
The church of Ephesus was engaged in spiritual warfare,

284
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:07,859
and so too are we,

285
00:12:07,859 --> 00:12:10,099
and the spiritual warfare is all around us,

286
00:12:10,099 --> 00:12:14,259
and so we find there that God gives information

287
00:12:14,259 --> 00:12:15,739
to the church at Ephesus

288
00:12:15,739 --> 00:12:19,619
with regard to being prepared for that battle,

289
00:12:19,619 --> 00:12:21,899
and then, of course, we've been studying this calendar year

290
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:23,939
going through 1st and 2nd Timothy,

291
00:12:23,939 --> 00:12:25,659
and we've had the opportunity

292
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:26,839
to deal with several things

293
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:30,399
with regard to the ministry of Timothy where?

294
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,359
At Ephesus, and so God gives us a lot of information

295
00:12:34,359 --> 00:12:36,139
about the church at Ephesus

296
00:12:36,139 --> 00:12:38,999
as we come here to Revelation chapter number two,

297
00:12:38,999 --> 00:12:41,599
and we find that as we look at the other churches,

298
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:45,079
in many instances, there's not as much information

299
00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:49,559
given to us within the scriptures about those churches

300
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:51,959
as what we have here about Ephesus,

301
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:55,659
and so God has given us a great foundation

302
00:12:55,659 --> 00:12:58,979
with which we can draw from as we begin to know

303
00:12:58,979 --> 00:13:02,419
what God is going to say to this church at Ephesus.

304
00:13:02,419 --> 00:13:05,059
Now, remember with me, I mentioned this last week,

305
00:13:05,059 --> 00:13:08,419
that each church that is addressed is a literal church

306
00:13:08,419 --> 00:13:10,899
that was in existence at the time of the writing.

307
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:13,919
We find that he says that he uses the plural

308
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:17,999
to send it unto the seven churches, plural.

309
00:13:17,999 --> 00:13:20,459
They're individual churches.

310
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:23,239
He speaks not only about the individual churches,

311
00:13:23,239 --> 00:13:25,159
but he talks about the seven stars

312
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:27,759
are the angels of the seven churches,

313
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:30,159
and in verse number 20 of chapter one,

314
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:32,879
and so we find that they are literal churches

315
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:35,299
that are in existence at the time of the writing.

316
00:13:35,299 --> 00:13:38,599
We find that these churches not only were literal churches

317
00:13:38,599 --> 00:13:40,919
that were in existence at the time of the writing,

318
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:42,679
but I want you to keep this in mind

319
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:45,439
as we study through these seven letters

320
00:13:45,439 --> 00:13:48,939
that these churches are representative

321
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,939
of the churches throughout the church age.

322
00:13:51,939 --> 00:13:53,319
What do I mean by that?

323
00:13:53,319 --> 00:13:55,599
Well, some, and if you have a study Bible,

324
00:13:55,599 --> 00:13:57,579
maybe in your notes of your study Bible,

325
00:13:57,579 --> 00:14:00,039
I believe Schofield takes this perspective.

326
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,119
If you have a Schofield Bible,

327
00:14:01,119 --> 00:14:02,959
I'm not trying to throw him under the bus,

328
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,479
but the reality is that he would teach,

329
00:14:05,479 --> 00:14:08,319
and several others, that each of these churches

330
00:14:08,319 --> 00:14:11,159
represent a period of church history.

331
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:13,959
In other words, every church from the first

332
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:17,759
to fourth century is a church of Ephesus kind of a church,

333
00:14:17,779 --> 00:14:19,959
and then from the fifth century to the next,

334
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:23,019
whatever the cutoff is, is the next church,

335
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:26,459
and eventually you get to where we are in church history,

336
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:28,459
and basically they would say every church

337
00:14:28,459 --> 00:14:30,579
has to be a Laodicean church.

338
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:32,099
Well, that's kind of a problem,

339
00:14:32,099 --> 00:14:36,019
and we don't have to be a Laodicean church, praise God,

340
00:14:36,019 --> 00:14:38,979
and we can be a church that's on fire for God,

341
00:14:38,979 --> 00:14:41,579
that's doing what God has commanded us to do

342
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:44,940
and living in such a way that we're not full of goods

343
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,440
and increased with goods in need of nothing.

344
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,160
No, we're dependent upon the Lord and serving the Lord,

345
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,559
and so I don't believe that these churches

346
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:57,279
are indicative of, for these centuries of church history,

347
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,319
that was the church that was in existence.

348
00:15:00,319 --> 00:15:02,079
I believe that you can find,

349
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:07,079
throughout all of church history, these types of churches.

350
00:15:07,119 --> 00:15:11,000
You can find a Laodicean church in the fourth century,

351
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,759
just as you can find a Laodicean church here

352
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:17,179
today in 2024, and you can find a church

353
00:15:17,179 --> 00:15:20,099
that is like the church at Ephesus in the first century,

354
00:15:20,099 --> 00:15:21,459
just like you could find a church

355
00:15:21,459 --> 00:15:25,160
like the church of Ephesus in 2024, and so on and so forth.

356
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,019
So I hope that makes sense to you as we go through

357
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:29,739
and begin studying these letters,

358
00:15:29,739 --> 00:15:32,660
because it's important that as we understand

359
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:37,259
the historical interpretation of each letter that is given,

360
00:15:37,259 --> 00:15:38,819
and when we study the Bible,

361
00:15:38,819 --> 00:15:40,660
I mentioned this in the very first lesson

362
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,660
as we entered into the book of Revelation,

363
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,440
we must understand the historical,

364
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,079
grammatical interpretation.

365
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,239
What is the literal interpretation of the book?

366
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:51,519
Literally, there was a church at Ephesus

367
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,319
that received a letter,

368
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:57,399
but as the Bible has one main interpretation,

369
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:00,160
the thing that's so amazing about God's word

370
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,759
is that it's a living book, and because it's a living book,

371
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,880
we find that God's word has many applications,

372
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,859
and so we can take the letters

373
00:16:09,859 --> 00:16:12,000
that were written to the seven churches,

374
00:16:12,099 --> 00:16:13,940
and as we study those churches,

375
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,899
and as we have the opportunity to study

376
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:18,359
the content of each letter,

377
00:16:18,359 --> 00:16:23,359
then what we do is we humbly and honestly examine our church

378
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,199
based upon the letters that are being sent

379
00:16:26,199 --> 00:16:29,579
to these churches, and so when we do that,

380
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:31,419
we can ask ourselves these questions,

381
00:16:31,419 --> 00:16:34,419
because really, in every letter,

382
00:16:34,419 --> 00:16:37,099
there's two things that are consistent,

383
00:16:37,099 --> 00:16:38,139
several things that are consistent,

384
00:16:38,139 --> 00:16:41,099
but two specifically that we should ask questions of,

385
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:42,479
and that would be this,

386
00:16:42,479 --> 00:16:46,839
where would we as a church be commended,

387
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:50,039
and where would we as a church be corrected?

388
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:52,179
Because we find that in each of these letters,

389
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:53,739
it's consistent for all of them

390
00:16:53,739 --> 00:16:57,319
that God says, I know thy works,

391
00:16:57,319 --> 00:17:00,160
and we find that God gives commendation,

392
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,679
he commends them for certain things that they're doing,

393
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:05,799
and then he corrects them for things that they're not doing

394
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:07,399
that they need to start doing,

395
00:17:07,399 --> 00:17:09,880
or things that they are doing that they need to stop doing,

396
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,019
and so we find that this is an important aspect

397
00:17:13,019 --> 00:17:16,339
for us to understand as we begin studying

398
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:17,799
each of these letters.

399
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:20,539
Let me say this also, in each of the letters,

400
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,779
we find that the opening statement

401
00:17:22,779 --> 00:17:25,339
to each of these particular churches

402
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:29,459
is a introduction from the Lord Jesus Christ himself

403
00:17:29,459 --> 00:17:31,699
in a very distinct way,

404
00:17:31,699 --> 00:17:34,579
and it's very interesting because the introduction

405
00:17:34,579 --> 00:17:36,500
to each of these letters that are sent

406
00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:39,720
to the seven churches really cap,

407
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,479
they gather and they go back to what we see

408
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:46,199
in Revelation chapter one in verses 12 through 16,

409
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:51,079
and they capture some element of that vision that John saw,

410
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:55,220
and as they capture that particular aspect of that vision,

411
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:59,839
we find that that particular attribute of God

412
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:02,639
is highlighted in the introduction

413
00:18:02,639 --> 00:18:04,359
to each of these churches,

414
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:06,660
and that's pretty fascinating and pretty exciting

415
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,779
to see how God does that.

416
00:18:08,779 --> 00:18:11,099
We understand even as we sang this evening,

417
00:18:11,099 --> 00:18:14,579
blessed be the name, and the Lord has many names,

418
00:18:14,579 --> 00:18:16,339
and the reason that he has so many names

419
00:18:16,339 --> 00:18:18,299
is because there's not one name

420
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:20,799
that captures all of who he is.

421
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:26,000
Our God is so wonderful and he's so amazing

422
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,539
that he gives us so many names

423
00:18:28,539 --> 00:18:32,339
so that we could understand various attributes

424
00:18:32,339 --> 00:18:34,479
about who our God is,

425
00:18:34,479 --> 00:18:35,919
and so we find this evening

426
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,839
that as we enter into this first letter

427
00:18:38,839 --> 00:18:40,119
and we look at the introduction,

428
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,479
I've read to you verse number one.

429
00:18:41,479 --> 00:18:44,440
I'll read it once again in Revelation two in verse one.

430
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:48,399
He says, under the angel of the church of Ephesus write,

431
00:18:48,399 --> 00:18:51,899
these things saith he that holdeth the seven stars

432
00:18:51,899 --> 00:18:53,320
in his right hand,

433
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:57,640
who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks,

434
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:01,640
and so there are really two aspects that God gives us

435
00:19:01,659 --> 00:19:03,739
here as he's introducing this letter

436
00:19:03,739 --> 00:19:05,659
to the church of Ephesus,

437
00:19:05,659 --> 00:19:07,359
and he says, number one,

438
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:11,779
that these things saith he that holdeth the seven stars

439
00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:13,179
in his right hand.

440
00:19:13,179 --> 00:19:16,859
That's the first aspect of the introduction that we see,

441
00:19:16,859 --> 00:19:19,099
and we find, again, as we mentioned last week,

442
00:19:19,099 --> 00:19:21,899
that this would be representative of the control,

443
00:19:21,899 --> 00:19:25,339
power, and authority that our God has,

444
00:19:25,339 --> 00:19:27,899
but I want you to think of it this way

445
00:19:27,899 --> 00:19:30,020
as we take each of these thoughts tonight

446
00:19:30,719 --> 00:19:33,520
to boil them down in a single statement.

447
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,440
I would say that when he tells us

448
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,440
that he holdeth the seven stars in his right hand,

449
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,440
I want you to remember and consider the fact

450
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,159
that he provides us with his protection.

451
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:45,839
I'm thankful to be secure in the hand of God.

452
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:47,200
In John chapter number 10,

453
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,320
Jesus used this great image

454
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,399
and really gave the people a truth

455
00:19:53,399 --> 00:19:56,039
that would help them understand the truth of security.

456
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:58,320
He said, my sheep hear my voice and I know them

457
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,219
and they follow me and I give unto them eternal.

458
00:20:01,219 --> 00:20:02,719
and they shall never perish,

459
00:20:02,719 --> 00:20:04,079
neither shall any man pluck them,

460
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:07,279
what does he say, out of my hand.

461
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:10,079
My father which gave them me is greater than all,

462
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:13,079
and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand.

463
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:15,379
I and my father are one.

464
00:20:15,379 --> 00:20:17,999
And now as he's writing to the church at Ephesus,

465
00:20:17,999 --> 00:20:20,039
he says, these things saith he

466
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:23,719
that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand.

467
00:20:23,719 --> 00:20:24,999
Yes, he has power.

468
00:20:24,999 --> 00:20:26,179
Yes, he has authority.

469
00:20:26,179 --> 00:20:28,799
Yes, he is the one who is in control.

470
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,439
But I want you to see this evening

471
00:20:30,439 --> 00:20:33,399
the protection that our God gives.

472
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:36,239
And I'm so thankful for his protection.

473
00:20:36,239 --> 00:20:39,319
We ought never take for granted the protection

474
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:41,799
that God gives and the ability of our God

475
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:44,279
to give us the protection that we need.

476
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:46,919
He goes further in verse number one and says this,

477
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:51,919
who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks.

478
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:54,079
And we think about this when he says he walks

479
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:56,879
in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks.

480
00:20:56,879 --> 00:20:59,959
We find that it is his church.

481
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:01,359
It's his church.

482
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:03,959
And he is the head of his church.

483
00:21:03,959 --> 00:21:06,599
Matthew 16, the Lord Jesus Christ said,

484
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,879
who do men say that I am?

485
00:21:08,879 --> 00:21:11,839
And then he said this, who say ye that I am?

486
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:13,919
And of course, Peter stands up and he says,

487
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,119
thou art the Christ, the son of the living God.

488
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:19,039
And we find that Jesus made this great declaration.

489
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:24,039
He said, I will build my church.

490
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:25,319
Right, is that what he said?

491
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:27,399
He didn't say to Peter, I'm gonna build your church.

492
00:21:27,399 --> 00:21:29,279
He said, I'm gonna build my church

493
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:31,919
and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.

494
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,519
And we find that Jesus, it is his church.

495
00:21:34,519 --> 00:21:36,999
We read in Acts 20 in verse 28 already,

496
00:21:36,999 --> 00:21:39,079
where the Bible says that he purchased it,

497
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:41,439
the church, with his own blood.

498
00:21:41,439 --> 00:21:44,719
We find that in Ephesians chapter five in verse number 25,

499
00:21:44,719 --> 00:21:47,839
to the very church that this letter is being written to,

500
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:50,079
that we find that there in Ephesians five,

501
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:51,919
when God is giving the instruction

502
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,399
with regard to the relationships within the home,

503
00:21:55,399 --> 00:21:57,819
he says that husbands are to love their wives,

504
00:21:57,819 --> 00:22:02,299
even as Christ loved the church and gave himself for it.

505
00:22:02,299 --> 00:22:04,979
We find that in Colossians one in verse number 18,

506
00:22:04,979 --> 00:22:06,899
that the Bible clearly teaches

507
00:22:06,899 --> 00:22:11,419
that the Lord Jesus Christ is the head of the church.

508
00:22:11,419 --> 00:22:13,739
It's his church, he's the head of the church.

509
00:22:13,739 --> 00:22:18,519
Why do we take from a biblical position,

510
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:20,779
the truth of separation of church and state?

511
00:22:20,779 --> 00:22:23,859
And by the way, understand that that is not anything

512
00:22:23,859 --> 00:22:26,019
that's in our United States Constitution.

513
00:22:26,019 --> 00:22:30,059
It's something that was written from a Jefferson

514
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:32,379
to the Danbury Baptist, why?

515
00:22:32,379 --> 00:22:35,179
Because the government was trying to infiltrate

516
00:22:35,179 --> 00:22:37,279
and influence the church.

517
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:39,399
The church has always been designed,

518
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:41,699
when you think about the starting of America

519
00:22:41,699 --> 00:22:42,979
and all that took place,

520
00:22:42,979 --> 00:22:45,339
they were leaving a place

521
00:22:45,339 --> 00:22:48,139
where there was a state-run church.

522
00:22:48,139 --> 00:22:50,119
The governor and the state had married,

523
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:52,219
if we could use that terminology tonight,

524
00:22:52,219 --> 00:22:54,879
and they did not, listen, the king of England

525
00:22:54,879 --> 00:22:57,319
is the head of the church of England.

526
00:22:57,319 --> 00:22:58,159
That's how it works.

527
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,519
The queen, she was the head of the church of England

528
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:02,599
for all the years of her reign,

529
00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:05,639
and now the king is the head of the church of England.

530
00:23:05,639 --> 00:23:08,799
We say, no, no, no, Christ is the head of the church,

531
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:11,479
and he does not share with anyone else, amen?

532
00:23:11,479 --> 00:23:14,099
It's his church, and so we understand

533
00:23:14,099 --> 00:23:16,999
that that teaching is a biblical truth

534
00:23:16,999 --> 00:23:18,839
that Christ is the head.

535
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:22,439
Yes, the church is to influence the society,

536
00:23:22,439 --> 00:23:24,919
the culture, the government, all of it,

537
00:23:24,919 --> 00:23:26,719
the church is to influence,

538
00:23:26,719 --> 00:23:30,659
but we do not stand for the government dictating to us

539
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:31,739
what we're to do.

540
00:23:33,139 --> 00:23:35,039
Why? Because he's the head.

541
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,559
But I want you to think of this

542
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,839
just as we talk about the protection that God gives,

543
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:43,439
we see here when it says at the end of verse number one,

544
00:23:43,439 --> 00:23:46,439
that he who walketh in the midst

545
00:23:46,439 --> 00:23:49,159
of the seven golden candlesticks,

546
00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:51,159
we see his protection,

547
00:23:51,159 --> 00:23:55,719
but I want you to see his presence, his presence.

548
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:59,439
I'm so thankful that when we can gather together

549
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:03,199
as a body of believers, as a church,

550
00:24:03,199 --> 00:24:07,679
that we can gather knowing that our Lord is present.

551
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,119
That's a wonderful thing.

552
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:11,439
It's a wonderful truth of God's word.

553
00:24:11,439 --> 00:24:14,919
We've often referenced whether two or three

554
00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:17,179
gathered in my name, there am I in the midst,

555
00:24:17,179 --> 00:24:19,979
and we can reference that portion of scripture

556
00:24:19,979 --> 00:24:22,619
and understand that, but we look here this evening

557
00:24:22,619 --> 00:24:24,139
and begin to think about the fact

558
00:24:24,139 --> 00:24:25,699
that we come into this place,

559
00:24:25,699 --> 00:24:29,779
we gather where we gather so that we can worship our Lord

560
00:24:29,779 --> 00:24:33,779
and we can enjoy the fact that his presence is here.

561
00:24:33,779 --> 00:24:36,939
By the way, if his presence is not here,

562
00:24:36,939 --> 00:24:38,139
we're wasting our time.

563
00:24:39,499 --> 00:24:41,699
Oh, how we need the presence of God.

564
00:24:41,699 --> 00:24:45,219
You know the word in the Old Testament, Ichabod.

565
00:24:45,219 --> 00:24:46,059
What does it mean?

566
00:24:46,059 --> 00:24:49,619
The glory of the Lord hath departed.

567
00:24:50,259 --> 00:24:51,099
That's what it means.

568
00:24:51,099 --> 00:24:52,899
Listen, we don't want the glory of the Lord to depart.

569
00:24:52,899 --> 00:24:54,539
We need him.

570
00:24:54,539 --> 00:24:57,459
We come, listen, the church is not a club.

571
00:24:57,459 --> 00:24:59,779
The church is not just a let's get together

572
00:24:59,779 --> 00:25:01,619
and have some fun, let's get together.

573
00:25:01,619 --> 00:25:03,499
No, no, no, we can have fellowship

574
00:25:03,499 --> 00:25:04,999
and I'm all for fellowship,

575
00:25:04,999 --> 00:25:08,979
but the purpose of the church is not just fellowship.

576
00:25:08,979 --> 00:25:11,019
The purpose of the church is to exalt

577
00:25:11,019 --> 00:25:13,299
and magnify the Lord Jesus Christ,

578
00:25:13,299 --> 00:25:17,059
to learn of him, to exalt him, to tell others about him.

579
00:25:17,059 --> 00:25:19,899
And fellowship, yes, is part of the whole thing

580
00:25:19,899 --> 00:25:22,499
and the family of the people of God

581
00:25:22,499 --> 00:25:23,699
and I'm so thankful for it,

582
00:25:23,699 --> 00:25:27,779
but we see in this introductory comment that Jesus gives

583
00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:31,379
and how he reveals himself to the church of Ephesus,

584
00:25:31,379 --> 00:25:35,459
we see his protection and his presence.

585
00:25:36,859 --> 00:25:39,939
And then we see this, that he says in verse number two,

586
00:25:39,939 --> 00:25:43,339
I know thy works.

587
00:25:43,339 --> 00:25:46,539
The first point that I wanna share with you this evening

588
00:25:46,539 --> 00:25:50,419
is how the Lord commends the church of Ephesus.

589
00:25:50,419 --> 00:25:54,819
Begin looking at the way that he commends the church

590
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:57,539
and we'll look here this evening at verses two and three

591
00:25:57,539 --> 00:26:00,899
and begin to dig in and see what Jesus says.

592
00:26:00,899 --> 00:26:02,259
Now, we understand this evening

593
00:26:02,259 --> 00:26:03,979
that God knows everything, right?

594
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:05,179
Do you agree with that?

595
00:26:05,179 --> 00:26:06,779
We say God is omniscient, right?

596
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:08,779
We talk about the fact that God is omnipotent,

597
00:26:08,779 --> 00:26:10,899
that he has all power, that he's omniscient,

598
00:26:10,899 --> 00:26:12,879
that he knows all things, that he has all wisdom,

599
00:26:12,879 --> 00:26:14,259
that he's omnipresent,

600
00:26:14,259 --> 00:26:16,199
that he's everywhere present at the same time.

601
00:26:16,859 --> 00:26:18,919
Praise the Lord, he'll never leave us nor forsake us

602
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:22,519
and we can rejoice in those attributes of our God.

603
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:25,359
And it's one thing for us to know in our minds

604
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:27,879
that God knows everything, it's a known truth,

605
00:26:27,879 --> 00:26:29,839
he's revealed it to us in his word.

606
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:32,519
I think about the many times in which the ministry

607
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:34,279
of the Lord Jesus Christ where there are people

608
00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:36,319
that are gathered and he says to them,

609
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:38,439
why reason ye in your hearts?

610
00:26:38,439 --> 00:26:40,039
He knows exactly what they're thinking,

611
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:41,319
he knows what's going on, why?

612
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:43,159
Because he knows everything.

613
00:26:43,159 --> 00:26:44,839
Can I tell you, it's one thing for us

614
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:46,919
to know it intellectually,

615
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:49,359
but it's quite a different thing when we read it

616
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:52,599
and think about the church of Ephesus receiving this letter

617
00:26:52,599 --> 00:26:57,439
when Jesus says, I know thy works.

618
00:26:57,439 --> 00:26:59,959
Think about that just for a moment.

619
00:26:59,959 --> 00:27:03,279
And God says to us as a New Testament church,

620
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:05,919
just as he does to each of these seven churches

621
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:07,679
that we'll study over the next several weeks,

622
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:12,679
he says to us this evening, I know your works.

623
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:14,639
And so it's one thing for us to sit back and say,

624
00:27:15,399 --> 00:27:17,039
yes, God knows everything, he knows it all,

625
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,479
he knows my motives, he knows everything.

626
00:27:19,479 --> 00:27:21,719
But when we kind of, the rubber meets the road,

627
00:27:21,719 --> 00:27:26,439
so to speak, and God says, I know your works.

628
00:27:26,439 --> 00:27:29,599
Notice what he says as we look at three aspects

629
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:33,039
of this commendation that God gives them.

630
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:36,059
He says in verse number two, I know thy works,

631
00:27:36,959 --> 00:27:41,159
and thy labor, and thy patience,

632
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:45,479
and how thou canst not bear them which are evil.

633
00:27:45,479 --> 00:27:49,279
Thou hast tried them which say they are apostles

634
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:52,679
and are not, hast found them liars,

635
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:54,559
and hast borne, and hast patience,

636
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:59,559
and for my name's sake, hast labored, and hast not fainted.

637
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,999
When God commends the church at Ephesus,

638
00:28:03,999 --> 00:28:06,879
we find that he begins by speaking about

639
00:28:06,879 --> 00:28:09,719
how they were busy serving the Lord.

640
00:28:09,719 --> 00:28:11,999
I made this statement a couple of weeks ago,

641
00:28:11,999 --> 00:28:15,519
and the reality is that we are saved to serve.

642
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:17,079
We're saved to serve.

643
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:18,959
We ought to have a place of ministry,

644
00:28:18,959 --> 00:28:20,399
we ought to have a place where we are

645
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:22,699
serving the Lord in some capacity.

646
00:28:22,699 --> 00:28:24,679
We find that the Bible teaches us

647
00:28:24,679 --> 00:28:26,439
very plainly and very clearly.

648
00:28:26,439 --> 00:28:29,459
In fact, we read of the verses in Ephesians chapter two

649
00:28:29,459 --> 00:28:31,839
very specifically that our works,

650
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:34,759
our service is not what saves us.

651
00:28:34,759 --> 00:28:36,479
Aren't you thankful for that tonight?

652
00:28:36,479 --> 00:28:38,119
For my grace are you saved through faith,

653
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:40,679
and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God,

654
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:45,119
not of works, lest any man should boast.

655
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:48,119
And we find that I'm not saved by my works,

656
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:49,839
you're not saved by your works,

657
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:52,759
we cannot be saved by our service for Christ,

658
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:57,759
nor can we keep our salvation by working or serving.

659
00:28:57,879 --> 00:28:58,919
Would you agree?

660
00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:01,719
Biblically, it's absolutely impossible

661
00:29:01,719 --> 00:29:04,139
to be saved by serving, by working.

662
00:29:04,139 --> 00:29:05,579
It's impossible to keep it.

663
00:29:05,579 --> 00:29:08,419
I'm kept by the power of God.

664
00:29:08,419 --> 00:29:10,779
He gave me the gift of God as eternal life.

665
00:29:10,779 --> 00:29:12,519
I praise the Lord for that.

666
00:29:13,859 --> 00:29:15,899
But the very next verse, in verse number 10,

667
00:29:15,899 --> 00:29:20,899
says for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus.

668
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:24,819
And we're to be busy serving the Lord and doing good works.

669
00:29:24,819 --> 00:29:26,279
We find that the book of Titus,

670
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:29,479
just three chapters in that book,

671
00:29:29,479 --> 00:29:31,759
that each of those chapters reference

672
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:33,939
some aspect of good works,

673
00:29:34,259 --> 00:29:38,019
how we are to be involved in working and serving the Lord.

674
00:29:38,019 --> 00:29:40,299
We find that the apostle Paul

675
00:29:40,299 --> 00:29:42,979
says that he wants to be a good minister.

676
00:29:42,979 --> 00:29:44,339
He wants to serve the Lord.

677
00:29:44,339 --> 00:29:45,699
He wants to please the Lord.

678
00:29:45,699 --> 00:29:48,500
He wants to be a good steward of the grace of God.

679
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,299
And we find that here,

680
00:29:50,299 --> 00:29:52,659
as we begin studying the book of Revelation

681
00:29:52,659 --> 00:29:55,399
and this letter to the church of Ephesus,

682
00:29:55,399 --> 00:29:56,859
the Lord Jesus Christ says,

683
00:29:56,859 --> 00:29:59,779
I know thy works and thy labor.

684
00:29:59,779 --> 00:30:01,459
They were serving the Lord.

685
00:30:01,459 --> 00:30:04,459
But they were not serving the Lord so that they could be saved,

686
00:30:04,459 --> 00:30:06,459
so that they could stay saved.

687
00:30:06,459 --> 00:30:11,459
It was the result of being saved that led them to serve their Master.

688
00:30:11,459 --> 00:30:15,459
And can I tell you this evening, we ought to be busy serving the Lord.

689
00:30:15,459 --> 00:30:18,459
We ought to be busy doing something for Jesus.

690
00:30:18,459 --> 00:30:20,459
Understanding that He's equipped us.

691
00:30:20,459 --> 00:30:24,459
We've been given a gift, spiritually speaking, every child of God.

692
00:30:24,459 --> 00:30:28,459
If you're saved tonight, you've been given a spiritual gift.

693
00:30:29,459 --> 00:30:34,459
The church can only function and do what the church is supposed to do

694
00:30:34,459 --> 00:30:39,459
as if every member is working together in using their spiritual gift

695
00:30:39,459 --> 00:30:42,459
for the honor and glory of God.

696
00:30:42,459 --> 00:30:45,459
And so we find here that Jesus says,

697
00:30:45,459 --> 00:30:49,459
I know thy works and thy labor.

698
00:30:49,459 --> 00:30:51,459
Notice He says at the end of verse number three,

699
00:30:51,459 --> 00:30:53,459
He says, well I'll read all of it, He says,

700
00:30:54,459 --> 00:30:56,459
And for my namesake, notice,

701
00:30:56,459 --> 00:31:00,459
hast labored and hast not fainted.

702
00:31:00,459 --> 00:31:02,459
Not only were they busy serving the Lord,

703
00:31:02,459 --> 00:31:04,459
but they were faithfully serving the Lord.

704
00:31:04,459 --> 00:31:07,459
They understood, notice in verse number three,

705
00:31:07,459 --> 00:31:10,459
that the Bible says that for my namesake,

706
00:31:10,459 --> 00:31:14,459
hast labored and hast not fainted.

707
00:31:14,459 --> 00:31:19,459
Begin to think about again this truth of being busy

708
00:31:19,459 --> 00:31:21,459
and being faithful in serving the Lord.

709
00:31:21,459 --> 00:31:24,459
And I'm reminded of some New Testament verses of Scripture

710
00:31:24,459 --> 00:31:27,459
in 1 Corinthians 15, in verse number 58,

711
00:31:27,459 --> 00:31:30,459
where the Bible says, Therefore, my beloved brethren,

712
00:31:30,459 --> 00:31:33,459
be ye steadfast, unmovable,

713
00:31:33,459 --> 00:31:35,459
always abounding in the work of the Lord,

714
00:31:35,459 --> 00:31:38,459
for as much as you know that your, what?

715
00:31:38,459 --> 00:31:44,459
That your labor is not in vain in the Lord.

716
00:31:44,459 --> 00:31:48,459
Serving the Lord, there is joy in serving Jesus.

717
00:31:48,459 --> 00:31:51,459
But it's also labor, it's work.

718
00:31:51,459 --> 00:31:55,459
By the way, it's okay to get tired out serving Jesus.

719
00:31:55,459 --> 00:31:58,459
We get tired out doing a lot of other things, don't we?

720
00:31:58,459 --> 00:32:01,459
So it's okay if we get tired out serving Jesus.

721
00:32:01,459 --> 00:32:04,459
And here we find that they're faithfully serving the Lord.

722
00:32:04,459 --> 00:32:07,459
Notice, it said again that they labored,

723
00:32:07,459 --> 00:32:10,459
there in verse number three, and it says,

724
00:32:10,459 --> 00:32:11,459
And hast not fainted.

725
00:32:11,459 --> 00:32:14,459
In the book of Galatians, in chapter number six,

726
00:32:14,459 --> 00:32:17,459
we find that the Lord is speaking to these churches

727
00:32:17,459 --> 00:32:18,459
in the region of Galatia.

728
00:32:18,459 --> 00:32:21,459
Paul is writing back to them, and he says to them,

729
00:32:21,459 --> 00:32:23,459
in verse number nine of Galatians six,

730
00:32:23,459 --> 00:32:26,459
Let us not be weary in well-doing,

731
00:32:26,459 --> 00:32:31,459
for in due season we shall reap if we faint not.

732
00:32:31,459 --> 00:32:34,459
But how is it that we avoid fainting?

733
00:32:34,459 --> 00:32:37,459
How is it that we serve the Lord,

734
00:32:37,459 --> 00:32:40,459
that we're busy and faithfully serving the Lord,

735
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:43,459
and how is it that here he says, and hast not fainted?

736
00:32:43,459 --> 00:32:45,459
Well, we find that the Bible teaches us

737
00:32:45,459 --> 00:32:48,459
about the work of the Holy Spirit

738
00:32:48,459 --> 00:32:50,459
and the empowering of the inner man,

739
00:32:50,459 --> 00:32:52,459
and that the outward man,

740
00:32:52,459 --> 00:32:54,459
2 Corinthians chapter number four, might perish,

741
00:32:54,459 --> 00:32:58,459
but that we're renewed day by day.

742
00:32:58,459 --> 00:33:01,459
So we find that they were faithfully busy

743
00:33:01,459 --> 00:33:04,459
serving the Lord.

744
00:33:04,459 --> 00:33:06,459
Not only were they busy serving the Lord

745
00:33:06,459 --> 00:33:08,459
and faithfully serving the Lord,

746
00:33:08,459 --> 00:33:11,459
but I want you to notice that they were separated

747
00:33:11,459 --> 00:33:14,459
and they were doctrinally sound.

748
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:17,459
They were separated and they were doctrinally sound.

749
00:33:17,459 --> 00:33:18,459
Why do I say that?

750
00:33:18,459 --> 00:33:20,459
Notice in verse two, he says,

751
00:33:20,459 --> 00:33:23,459
I know thy works and thy labor and thy patience.

752
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:26,459
It says this, and how thou canst not bear them

753
00:33:26,459 --> 00:33:28,459
which are evil.

754
00:33:28,459 --> 00:33:31,459
They had no tolerance for evil.

755
00:33:31,459 --> 00:33:33,459
By the way, that's okay.

756
00:33:33,459 --> 00:33:35,459
Amen, that's a good thing.

757
00:33:35,459 --> 00:33:38,459
They are being commended for the fact

758
00:33:38,459 --> 00:33:40,459
that they did not tolerate, they could not,

759
00:33:40,459 --> 00:33:43,459
canst not bear them which are evil.

760
00:33:43,459 --> 00:33:46,459
You know that as a church, as a body of believers,

761
00:33:46,459 --> 00:33:49,459
we have a responsibility to be concerned

762
00:33:49,459 --> 00:33:51,459
with the purity of the church,

763
00:33:51,459 --> 00:33:54,459
the holiness of the church, amen?

764
00:33:54,459 --> 00:33:56,459
This is an important thing.

765
00:33:56,459 --> 00:33:58,459
Jesus said, be holy.

766
00:33:58,459 --> 00:34:00,459
God said in Leviticus, and then it's repeated

767
00:34:00,459 --> 00:34:02,459
in the New Testament, be holy, why?

768
00:34:02,459 --> 00:34:03,459
For I am holy.

769
00:34:03,459 --> 00:34:06,459
He says that we're to be holy in all manner of conversation.

770
00:34:06,459 --> 00:34:08,459
We're not to live like we used to live.

771
00:34:08,459 --> 00:34:10,459
There's been a great change since I've been born again.

772
00:34:10,459 --> 00:34:12,459
No, we're not gonna be perfect.

773
00:34:12,459 --> 00:34:13,459
We understand that.

774
00:34:13,459 --> 00:34:15,459
But we understand that it's important

775
00:34:15,459 --> 00:34:17,459
that we don't allow evil.

776
00:34:17,459 --> 00:34:19,459
We don't just turn a blind eye.

777
00:34:19,459 --> 00:34:22,459
We don't just do as it's been done so often

778
00:34:22,459 --> 00:34:24,459
in the last 50 years in our churches

779
00:34:24,459 --> 00:34:27,459
of just sweeping things under the carpet.

780
00:34:27,459 --> 00:34:28,459
No.

781
00:34:28,459 --> 00:34:31,459
Here's what it says to the church of Ephesus.

782
00:34:31,459 --> 00:34:34,459
The way that Christ is commending them,

783
00:34:34,459 --> 00:34:37,459
thou, how thou canst not bear them

784
00:34:37,459 --> 00:34:39,459
which are evil.

785
00:34:39,459 --> 00:34:40,459
You know, it's an interesting thing.

786
00:34:40,459 --> 00:34:43,459
It's very unusual today for church discipline

787
00:34:43,459 --> 00:34:48,459
to be in any level in a local church.

788
00:34:48,459 --> 00:34:50,459
There's only one time, I've been saved for 27 years,

789
00:34:50,459 --> 00:34:52,459
there's only one time in 27 years

790
00:34:52,459 --> 00:34:55,459
that I ever saw church discipline carried out.

791
00:34:55,459 --> 00:34:57,459
Now, I don't think, obviously,

792
00:34:57,459 --> 00:34:59,459
we don't wanna have church discipline every week,

793
00:34:59,459 --> 00:35:01,459
but there have been several times

794
00:35:01,459 --> 00:35:04,459
in which church discipline should have been carried out

795
00:35:04,459 --> 00:35:07,459
during those 27 years of my saved life,

796
00:35:07,459 --> 00:35:10,459
and it was not carried out.

797
00:35:10,459 --> 00:35:13,459
There's a pattern that Jesus set forth

798
00:35:13,459 --> 00:35:15,459
in the book of Matthew in chapter 18

799
00:35:15,459 --> 00:35:17,459
with regard to church discipline

800
00:35:17,459 --> 00:35:18,459
and how we deal with those things

801
00:35:18,459 --> 00:35:19,459
and what we do.

802
00:35:19,459 --> 00:35:21,459
And understand that when we talk about

803
00:35:21,459 --> 00:35:22,459
church discipline this evening,

804
00:35:22,459 --> 00:35:25,459
we're talking about this lack of tolerance,

805
00:35:25,459 --> 00:35:28,459
the fact that they did not tolerate that which was evil.

806
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:30,459
It's not that we're trying to simply

807
00:35:30,459 --> 00:35:32,459
excommunicate someone, no.

808
00:35:32,459 --> 00:35:34,459
The goal of church discipline

809
00:35:34,459 --> 00:35:38,459
is always reconciliation.

810
00:35:38,459 --> 00:35:41,459
Listen, if we're going to go into

811
00:35:41,459 --> 00:35:43,459
a situation of church discipline

812
00:35:43,459 --> 00:35:46,459
and the goal not be reconciliation,

813
00:35:46,459 --> 00:35:48,459
we need to check ourselves.

814
00:35:48,459 --> 00:35:50,459
Because the Bible says in Galatians 6,

815
00:35:50,459 --> 00:35:53,459
you which are spiritual, restore such in one.

816
00:35:53,459 --> 00:35:55,459
That's what the Bible says.

817
00:35:55,459 --> 00:35:57,459
And so when we think about this truth

818
00:35:57,459 --> 00:35:58,459
and look at what's happening here

819
00:35:58,459 --> 00:35:59,459
at the church of Ephesus,

820
00:35:59,459 --> 00:36:03,459
he says that you cannot bear them which are evil.

821
00:36:03,459 --> 00:36:04,459
You're not going to allow that.

822
00:36:04,459 --> 00:36:07,459
What does the Bible say, a little leaven?

823
00:36:07,459 --> 00:36:09,459
Leaven it, the whole lump.

824
00:36:09,459 --> 00:36:11,459
What happened there in Ai?

825
00:36:11,459 --> 00:36:12,459
Do you remember Ai?

826
00:36:12,459 --> 00:36:14,459
You remember the book of Joshua?

827
00:36:14,459 --> 00:36:15,459
Man, they had victory at Jericho

828
00:36:15,459 --> 00:36:17,459
and it was an amazing thing, did they not?

829
00:36:17,459 --> 00:36:19,459
I mean, God worked miraculously.

830
00:36:19,459 --> 00:36:21,459
And so here's what happens in Ai.

831
00:36:21,459 --> 00:36:23,459
Let me back up just for a moment.

832
00:36:23,459 --> 00:36:25,459
At Jericho, there was specific instruction

833
00:36:25,459 --> 00:36:27,459
with regard to the spoils.

834
00:36:27,459 --> 00:36:29,459
What was the instruction?

835
00:36:29,459 --> 00:36:31,459
It's God's, right?

836
00:36:31,459 --> 00:36:32,459
Can I summarize it that way?

837
00:36:32,459 --> 00:36:34,459
The spoils of Jerusalem were God's.

838
00:36:34,459 --> 00:36:37,459
I believe it's a picture of the first fruits.

839
00:36:37,459 --> 00:36:39,459
And we find that that was what was said.

840
00:36:39,459 --> 00:36:41,459
But there was someone unknown to everybody else,

841
00:36:41,459 --> 00:36:45,459
including Joshua, that took.

842
00:36:45,459 --> 00:36:47,459
We don't find out until later in chapter 7.

843
00:36:47,459 --> 00:36:49,459
It tells us in verse 1,

844
00:36:49,459 --> 00:36:51,459
so that we as the readers know,

845
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:56,459
but Joshua did not know at that point.

846
00:36:56,459 --> 00:37:00,459
So one, someone took Achan

847
00:37:00,459 --> 00:37:03,459
of that which was forbidden.

848
00:37:03,459 --> 00:37:06,459
But then they got prideful.

849
00:37:06,459 --> 00:37:08,459
They said, oh, Ai's not that big.

850
00:37:08,459 --> 00:37:10,459
We don't need to send everybody.

851
00:37:10,459 --> 00:37:12,459
Just let a small contingency go

852
00:37:12,459 --> 00:37:14,459
and we'll be able to handle it.

853
00:37:14,459 --> 00:37:15,459
But what happened?

854
00:37:15,459 --> 00:37:16,459
They got defeated.

855
00:37:16,459 --> 00:37:18,459
36 men lost their lives at Ai.

856
00:37:18,459 --> 00:37:20,459
You read it in Joshua chapter 7.

857
00:37:20,459 --> 00:37:22,459
36 people lost their lives.

858
00:37:22,459 --> 00:37:24,459
Joshua's beside himself.

859
00:37:24,459 --> 00:37:26,459
I mean, Joshua's prostrating on the ground,

860
00:37:26,459 --> 00:37:28,459
crying out to the Lord, what's going on?

861
00:37:28,459 --> 00:37:31,459
And he says, get up.

862
00:37:31,459 --> 00:37:35,459
There's sin in the camp.

863
00:37:35,459 --> 00:37:37,459
There's sin in the camp.

864
00:37:37,459 --> 00:37:38,459
You know what he says?

865
00:37:38,459 --> 00:37:40,459
You've got to deal with it.

866
00:37:40,459 --> 00:37:42,459
And I'm going to tell you,

867
00:37:42,459 --> 00:37:44,459
Joshua chapter 7 has strong language.

868
00:37:44,459 --> 00:37:45,459
Here's what God says.

869
00:37:45,459 --> 00:37:46,459
I'm going to just summarize it.

870
00:37:46,459 --> 00:37:48,459
We don't have time to run over there.

871
00:37:48,459 --> 00:37:50,459
But you go back and you read Joshua 7.

872
00:37:50,459 --> 00:37:52,459
Here's what God says in summary.

873
00:37:52,459 --> 00:37:54,459
If you don't deal with the sin in the camp,

874
00:37:54,459 --> 00:37:56,459
I'm not going to be with you anymore

875
00:37:57,459 --> 00:38:00,459
That's how serious God is about it.

876
00:38:00,459 --> 00:38:03,459
Our God is a holy God.

877
00:38:03,459 --> 00:38:05,459
Our God is a holy God.

878
00:38:05,459 --> 00:38:08,459
And we find here that this church of Ephesus,

879
00:38:08,459 --> 00:38:11,459
that they're being commended for their labor,

880
00:38:11,459 --> 00:38:13,459
for their service, for their work.

881
00:38:13,459 --> 00:38:15,459
And they're also being commended for the fact

882
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:18,459
that they're separated and they're doctrinally sound.

883
00:38:18,459 --> 00:38:21,459
He says, thou canst not bear them which are evil.

884
00:38:21,459 --> 00:38:23,459
Notice as it continues in verse number 2.

885
00:38:23,459 --> 00:38:28,459
Thou hast tried them which say they are apostles

886
00:38:28,459 --> 00:38:33,459
and are not, and hast found them liars.

887
00:38:33,459 --> 00:38:35,459
You know, there's some people today

888
00:38:35,459 --> 00:38:37,459
that are running around saying they're apostles.

889
00:38:37,459 --> 00:38:40,459
They're either ignorant or they're lying.

890
00:38:40,459 --> 00:38:42,459
You say, man, that's a bold statement.

891
00:38:42,459 --> 00:38:43,459
It's just biblical.

892
00:38:43,459 --> 00:38:46,459
They either don't know that you can't be an apostle today

893
00:38:46,459 --> 00:38:48,459
or they're lying.

894
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:51,459
Because there's no other area.

895
00:38:51,459 --> 00:38:54,459
There's no more apostles.

896
00:38:54,459 --> 00:38:56,459
No more apostles.

897
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:59,459
But we find that here it says this.

898
00:38:59,459 --> 00:39:03,459
Thou hast, notice what it says, tried them

899
00:39:03,459 --> 00:39:07,459
which say they are apostles and are not

900
00:39:07,459 --> 00:39:10,459
and hast found them liars.

901
00:39:10,459 --> 00:39:12,459
So what were they doing?

902
00:39:12,459 --> 00:39:14,459
Well, according to 1 John chapter 4,

903
00:39:14,459 --> 00:39:16,459
I believe as we look at that passage

904
00:39:16,459 --> 00:39:18,459
that that's exactly what was being implemented

905
00:39:18,459 --> 00:39:20,459
by the church of Ephesus.

906
00:39:20,459 --> 00:39:24,459
And by the way, John is writing here this letter,

907
00:39:24,459 --> 00:39:27,459
1 John, but John also was very familiar with Ephesus

908
00:39:27,459 --> 00:39:29,459
and spent time there in Ephesus.

909
00:39:29,459 --> 00:39:32,459
And the Bible says in 1 John 4 and verse number 1,

910
00:39:32,459 --> 00:39:35,459
Beloved, believe not every spirit,

911
00:39:35,459 --> 00:39:38,459
but try the spirits, whether they are of God,

912
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:43,459
because many false prophets are gone out into the world.

913
00:39:43,459 --> 00:39:45,459
Try the spirits.

914
00:39:45,459 --> 00:39:47,459
They say they're apostles, but they're not.

915
00:39:47,459 --> 00:39:49,459
Listen, here's what you did, church,

916
00:39:49,459 --> 00:39:51,459
because you're separated, you're doctrinally sound.

917
00:39:51,459 --> 00:39:54,459
You tried them and you found them to be liars.

918
00:39:54,459 --> 00:39:58,459
You found them to not be what they said,

919
00:39:58,459 --> 00:40:00,459
what they claimed to be.

920
00:40:00,459 --> 00:40:05,219
of the sound doctrine that was so often repeated

921
00:40:05,219 --> 00:40:07,339
to Timothy in 1st and 2nd Timothy

922
00:40:07,339 --> 00:40:10,099
with regard to the importance of sound doctrine.

923
00:40:10,099 --> 00:40:12,619
Turn back very quickly, if you will,

924
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:14,099
to the book of 1st Timothy,

925
00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:17,739
and notice as Paul is writing and encouraging Timothy

926
00:40:17,739 --> 00:40:21,139
with regard to his ministry at Ephesus

927
00:40:21,139 --> 00:40:23,579
and his leadership there in the church

928
00:40:23,579 --> 00:40:25,219
and how important it was

929
00:40:25,219 --> 00:40:27,499
that they would be sound in the faith.

930
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:29,659
He says there in verse number five

931
00:40:29,659 --> 00:40:32,219
of chapter one of 1st Timothy,

932
00:40:32,219 --> 00:40:34,259
now the end of the commandment is charity

933
00:40:34,259 --> 00:40:36,059
out of a pure heart, of good conscience,

934
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:37,319
and of faith unfeigned,

935
00:40:37,319 --> 00:40:39,319
from which some, having swerved,

936
00:40:39,319 --> 00:40:43,219
have turned aside unto vain jangling.

937
00:40:43,219 --> 00:40:45,419
He tells us in verse number 10,

938
00:40:45,419 --> 00:40:48,579
for harmongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind

939
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:51,419
and menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons,

940
00:40:51,419 --> 00:40:53,099
and if there be any other thing that is,

941
00:40:53,099 --> 00:40:57,899
notice what he says, contrary to sound doctrine.

942
00:40:57,899 --> 00:41:02,499
So Timothy is given a very clear mandate and responsibility.

943
00:41:02,499 --> 00:41:04,859
If you look at chapter four in 1st Timothy

944
00:41:04,859 --> 00:41:06,139
in verse number six,

945
00:41:06,139 --> 00:41:07,379
notice what Paul says,

946
00:41:07,379 --> 00:41:11,259
if thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things,

947
00:41:11,259 --> 00:41:13,939
thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ,

948
00:41:13,939 --> 00:41:16,379
nourished up in the words of faith

949
00:41:16,379 --> 00:41:19,019
and of good doctrine,

950
00:41:19,019 --> 00:41:21,499
whereunto thou hast attained.

951
00:41:21,499 --> 00:41:23,419
Chapter six in verse number two,

952
00:41:23,419 --> 00:41:26,339
the Bible says, and they that have believing masters,

953
00:41:26,339 --> 00:41:28,939
let them not despise them because they are brethren,

954
00:41:28,939 --> 00:41:30,259
but rather do them service

955
00:41:30,259 --> 00:41:31,699
because they are faithful

956
00:41:31,699 --> 00:41:34,419
and beloved partakers of the benefit.

957
00:41:34,419 --> 00:41:36,419
These things, notice what he says,

958
00:41:36,419 --> 00:41:39,539
teach and exhort.

959
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:40,779
If any man, verse number three,

960
00:41:40,779 --> 00:41:43,499
teach otherwise and consent not to wholesome words,

961
00:41:43,499 --> 00:41:45,379
even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ

962
00:41:45,379 --> 00:41:47,499
and of the doctrine which is according to godliness,

963
00:41:47,499 --> 00:41:49,099
he is proud, knowing nothing,

964
00:41:49,099 --> 00:41:51,459
but doting about questions and strifes of words,

965
00:41:52,299 --> 00:41:55,979
whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,

966
00:41:55,979 --> 00:41:58,299
perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds

967
00:41:58,299 --> 00:41:59,659
and destitute of the truth,

968
00:41:59,659 --> 00:42:01,699
supposing that gain is godliness.

969
00:42:01,699 --> 00:42:05,779
Notice what he says, from such withdraw thyself.

970
00:42:05,779 --> 00:42:08,539
In 2nd Timothy chapter one in verse number 13,

971
00:42:08,539 --> 00:42:11,479
the Bible says, hold fast the form of sound words

972
00:42:11,479 --> 00:42:14,859
which thou hast heard of me in faith and love,

973
00:42:14,859 --> 00:42:17,419
which is in Christ Jesus.

974
00:42:17,419 --> 00:42:20,139
In chapter two in verse number two of 2nd Timothy,

975
00:42:20,139 --> 00:42:22,579
he says, in the things that thou hast heard of me,

976
00:42:22,579 --> 00:42:25,459
among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men

977
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:28,399
which shall be able to teach others also.

978
00:42:28,399 --> 00:42:30,699
We find that in chapter number four,

979
00:42:30,699 --> 00:42:32,219
well, in chapter three, verse 16,

980
00:42:32,219 --> 00:42:34,379
all scripture is given by inspiration of God

981
00:42:34,379 --> 00:42:37,099
and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction,

982
00:42:37,099 --> 00:42:38,639
for instruction in righteousness,

983
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:40,459
that the man of God might be perfect,

984
00:42:40,459 --> 00:42:43,019
throughly furnished unto all good works.

985
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:45,179
He says in chapter four in verse two,

986
00:42:45,179 --> 00:42:47,699
preach the word, be instant in season, out of season,

987
00:42:47,699 --> 00:42:50,819
reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all long-suffering,

988
00:42:50,819 --> 00:42:54,299
and what, doctrine, for the time will come

989
00:42:54,299 --> 00:42:57,459
when they will not endure what, sound doctrine,

990
00:42:57,459 --> 00:42:59,939
but after their own lust shall they heap to themselves

991
00:42:59,939 --> 00:43:02,859
teachers having itching ears.

992
00:43:02,859 --> 00:43:06,299
And so we find that the church had been instructed

993
00:43:06,299 --> 00:43:08,799
with regard to being sound in the faith,

994
00:43:08,799 --> 00:43:10,299
dealing with false teachers,

995
00:43:10,299 --> 00:43:12,419
all of those things, serving the Lord.

996
00:43:12,419 --> 00:43:15,339
We are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus.

997
00:43:15,339 --> 00:43:17,339
And here's what the Lord Jesus Christ,

998
00:43:17,979 --> 00:43:19,259
who is the protector of the church,

999
00:43:19,259 --> 00:43:22,019
whose presence is there, he says, I know your works,

1000
00:43:22,019 --> 00:43:23,899
and I know that you're serving,

1001
00:43:23,899 --> 00:43:25,979
and you're busy, and you're laboring,

1002
00:43:25,979 --> 00:43:28,419
and you're not fainting, and you're separated,

1003
00:43:28,419 --> 00:43:30,979
and you're doctrinally sound.

1004
00:43:30,979 --> 00:43:32,019
And he commends them.

1005
00:43:34,159 --> 00:43:36,259
Next week, we'll deal with the correction,

1006
00:43:37,459 --> 00:43:42,459
because he says this, nevertheless, in verse number four,

1007
00:43:43,459 --> 00:43:48,459
nevertheless, I have somewhat against thee.

1008
00:43:49,459 --> 00:43:51,179
And notice what he says,

1009
00:43:51,179 --> 00:43:55,639
because thou hast left thy first love.

1010
00:43:56,659 --> 00:44:00,059
We'll deal with that next week in its entirety,

1011
00:44:00,059 --> 00:44:01,899
and look at what it means,

1012
00:44:01,899 --> 00:44:03,979
and what Christ was correcting them on,

1013
00:44:03,979 --> 00:44:08,539
and how we can be careful not to be in the same situation

1014
00:44:08,539 --> 00:44:12,399
of the church of Ephesus, where they were serving,

1015
00:44:13,339 --> 00:44:14,759
but it almost becomes a Martha situation,

1016
00:44:14,759 --> 00:44:16,239
instead of a Mary situation,

1017
00:44:16,239 --> 00:44:18,519
where we're cumbered about with much serving,

1018
00:44:18,519 --> 00:44:22,719
and yet we fail to remember why,

1019
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:26,639
or really for whom we are serving.

1020
00:44:26,639 --> 00:44:29,799
And it's so vitally important that we understand,

1021
00:44:29,799 --> 00:44:32,839
as we look next week, at this nevertheless.

1022
00:44:32,839 --> 00:44:35,379
What is the correction that will come

1023
00:44:35,379 --> 00:44:37,679
to the church of Ephesus?

1024
00:44:37,679 --> 00:44:39,339
We've spent much time this evening

1025
00:44:39,339 --> 00:44:40,919
dealing with really the background

1026
00:44:40,919 --> 00:44:42,359
of the church of Ephesus,

1027
00:44:43,199 --> 00:44:44,079
and dealing tonight with the way

1028
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:47,919
in which Christ commends his church.

1029
00:44:47,919 --> 00:44:52,719
I wonder tonight, if we truly evaluated our own lives,

1030
00:44:52,719 --> 00:44:55,559
our church corporately, but then our individual lives,

1031
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:57,759
because we understand the church is not a building,

1032
00:44:57,759 --> 00:45:01,999
it's the people, the people, that's the church.

1033
00:45:01,999 --> 00:45:04,479
You're the church, we're the church.

1034
00:45:04,479 --> 00:45:07,159
I hope that this building doesn't burn down,

1035
00:45:07,159 --> 00:45:09,319
but you understand that if it did,

1036
00:45:09,319 --> 00:45:12,779
the church, Fellowship Baptist Church, still exists.

1037
00:45:13,959 --> 00:45:16,919
If we don't have this meeting place, we still exist.

1038
00:45:16,919 --> 00:45:18,739
We can have a meeting place somewhere else.

1039
00:45:18,739 --> 00:45:20,999
We can meet in a field, we can meet in a tent,

1040
00:45:20,999 --> 00:45:22,919
we can meet in a rented room.

1041
00:45:22,919 --> 00:45:24,559
The church is the people.

1042
00:45:25,399 --> 00:45:28,579
And how would he correct, or how would he commend us,

1043
00:45:28,579 --> 00:45:31,159
when he says to us, I know your works?

1044
00:45:31,159 --> 00:45:32,359
What does he know about our works?

1045
00:45:32,359 --> 00:45:34,599
What does he know about our service?

1046
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:36,239
Are we laboring?

1047
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:37,599
Are we fainting?

1048
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:39,679
Are we serving the Lord faithfully?

1049
00:45:39,679 --> 00:45:43,879
Are we doing for Christ what he saved us to do?

1050
00:45:44,999 --> 00:45:47,359
Are we truly serving the Lord?

1051
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:48,199
Let's pray together.

1052
00:45:48,199 --> 00:45:49,019
Father, we love you.

1053
00:45:49,019 --> 00:45:50,119
We thank you for loving us.

1054
00:45:50,119 --> 00:45:53,059
Thank you for the information that you give us

1055
00:45:53,059 --> 00:45:55,239
with regard to this church of Ephesus.

1056
00:45:55,239 --> 00:45:58,279
And Lord, we see how you commend this church,

1057
00:45:58,279 --> 00:46:00,819
and we'll see next week, as we already gave

1058
00:46:00,819 --> 00:46:05,819
kind of a preview, if you will, to the nevertheless.

1059
00:46:06,379 --> 00:46:09,419
And God, I pray that as we consider the thought tonight

1060
00:46:09,419 --> 00:46:12,499
of you knowing their works and their labor,

1061
00:46:12,499 --> 00:46:17,499
their service, their separation, their sound teaching,

1062
00:46:18,179 --> 00:46:20,139
the way in which you commended them,

1063
00:46:20,139 --> 00:46:22,739
Lord, I pray that you'd help us to evaluate our lives

1064
00:46:22,739 --> 00:46:25,139
with humility, with honesty,

1065
00:46:25,139 --> 00:46:28,459
and consider tonight our labor for you,

1066
00:46:28,459 --> 00:46:30,219
our level of separation.

1067
00:46:31,619 --> 00:46:34,759
Are we allowing for evil, wickedness?

1068
00:46:34,759 --> 00:46:37,519
Are we dealing with it, correcting it?

1069
00:46:38,399 --> 00:46:41,079
Lord, are we sound in doctrine?

1070
00:46:42,839 --> 00:46:45,719
God, I thank you that you gave each of us a spiritual gift,

1071
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:48,239
and Lord, you've called us to serve you.

1072
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:50,439
I'm thankful that our good works, our service,

1073
00:46:50,439 --> 00:46:53,519
is not to save us or to keep us saved,

1074
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:56,679
but it's out of love for what you've done for us

1075
00:46:56,679 --> 00:46:59,079
that we then can serve you.

1076
00:46:59,079 --> 00:47:01,439
I pray that you'd help us in this moment of invitation

1077
00:47:01,439 --> 00:47:05,679
tonight to examine our own lives individually,

1078
00:47:05,679 --> 00:47:09,679
to determine if we're serving you like we should.

1079
00:47:09,679 --> 00:47:10,879
I pray that you'd have your will and way,

1080
00:47:10,879 --> 00:47:11,839
and we'll thank you for it.

1081
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:12,799
In Christ's name we pray.

1082
00:47:12,799 --> 00:47:13,639
We just.
