1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,880
this evening, Jeremiah chapter number 38. And really, as we look at this passage of

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:14,279
Scripture this evening, I'll be looking at portions of Jeremiah 37, 38, 39, and 40.

3
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:18,739
And so hold your fingers there in that section of Scripture, and we'll be kind of bouncing

4
00:00:18,739 --> 00:00:25,120
back and forth. And as we look at this particular text, I'm trusting that the Lord will enable

5
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:32,459
us tonight to be encouraged from that which we read of with regard to the life of Jeremiah.

6
00:00:32,459 --> 00:00:41,220
As we have now completed almost 10 months in 2020, we know that there have been many

7
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:47,279
that have made commentary with regard to 2020. And as we think about the days in which we're

8
00:00:47,279 --> 00:00:55,240
living, many have expressed this thought, is that we are living in uncertain times.

9
00:00:55,240 --> 00:01:00,840
However, as we would think about the fact that we're living in 2020 and that our God

10
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:06,919
is omniscient and He's eternal, though from man's perspective we may face some level of

11
00:01:06,919 --> 00:01:13,639
uncertainty, the reality is that God knows all about it. God is never surprised by anything

12
00:01:13,639 --> 00:01:20,059
that happens. He knows the end from the beginning. And so as we begin to think about that truth

13
00:01:20,059 --> 00:01:24,940
and we think about the way in which people have used various verbiage to describe 2020,

14
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:31,180
and no doubt it's been varied at times, it's been quite accurate from man's perspective.

15
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:37,580
And I'm thankful that it's not only our perspective that matters. I'm thankful that we can understand

16
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:43,419
that God is still sitting upon His throne and that God is still in control. And though

17
00:01:43,419 --> 00:01:48,720
from my vantage point, though from your vantage point, speaking from a human perspective,

18
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,120
we may look at things and say, what is going on? The uncertainty of the times and so on

19
00:01:54,120 --> 00:02:00,599
and so forth. But we must rest in the fact that God is aware. As we look at the life

20
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:06,279
of Jeremiah in these particular chapters that we'll look at this evening, we really understand

21
00:02:06,279 --> 00:02:10,399
that there were some things that were certain, just as there are some things that are certain

22
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:16,100
for us this evening. We understand that God has given us some certainties with regard

23
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:22,580
to end times prophecy. We understand that as we would consider some of the truth that

24
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:27,940
God has given us in His Word with regard to end times in the last days and understanding

25
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:34,740
that we're living in those last days, there are some things that we should expect to happen

26
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:41,360
in these last days. And Jeremiah was a man that was, of course, serving God on the eve

27
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:47,839
of the Babylonian captivity. Historically speaking, we understand that as he is there

28
00:02:47,839 --> 00:02:53,720
and as he's preaching and giving the prophecies that have been given to him by the Lord God

29
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:59,619
Almighty, that Jeremiah is in a place where he is actually seeing the very things that

30
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:06,720
he's preached unfold. He's seeing the fulfillment of the very prophecies that he's proclaimed.

31
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:12,160
As we begin to think about the events that are surrounding the Babylonian captivity and

32
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:18,119
conquest of Jerusalem and the life of Jeremiah, I've asked you to turn to Jeremiah 38, and

33
00:03:18,119 --> 00:03:23,440
I want you to be there, but I want to remind you even before we jump into the portion of

34
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,759
Scripture that we'll look at this evening, I want to remind you of a great promise that

35
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:34,300
God gave to Jeremiah in Jeremiah chapter number one. In Jeremiah chapter number one in verse

36
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:41,300
number eight, God said to Jeremiah, be not afraid of their faces, for I am with thee

37
00:03:43,839 --> 00:03:50,839
to deliver thee, saith the Lord. We have, as we have looked at Scripture and considered

38
00:03:51,059 --> 00:03:57,679
these similar words that we read in Jeremiah 1.8, we read how that God promised to be with

39
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:03,919
Moses, he promised to be with Joshua, he promised to be with Jeremiah as we've just read, and

40
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:10,919
we understand that he is with us. We understand that Hebrews 13 tells us and we can rejoice

41
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:18,040
in the truth that he had said, I will never leave thee nor forsake thee, that Jesus said,

42
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:23,679
I am with you always, and for that we could rejoice. But as we think about that promise

43
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:28,320
and we think about the life and ministry of Jeremiah, we find that he was called of the

44
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:34,679
Lord and we find that he was faithful. Notice in Jeremiah 38 in verse number 28, it's where

45
00:04:34,679 --> 00:04:39,119
I'll get the title for the message this evening, and then we'll go through a host of Scriptures

46
00:04:39,119 --> 00:04:44,320
in these four chapters and trust to be a blessing to you this evening. In Jeremiah 38 in verse

47
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:51,320
number 28, the Bible says, so Jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day that

48
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:59,320
Jerusalem was taken. And he was there when Jerusalem was taken. I've said already by

49
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:05,320
way of introduction that Jeremiah witnessed what he had faithfully prophesied. If you're

50
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:11,320
taking notes this evening, I've simply entitled the message this evening, Jerusalem was taken.

51
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:16,320
Jerusalem was taken. We can see that from a historical perspective. We see the Bible

52
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,320
record that God gives us in His Word with regard to the captivity. And we find that

53
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:28,320
Jeremiah is called to minister and called to serve the Lord in really some difficult

54
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:34,320
days. As we would think about the life and ministry of Jeremiah, we would find that Jeremiah

55
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:40,320
had the privilege of prophesying and ministering during the times of really some kings, Josiah

56
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:46,320
in particular, where there was revival under the time of Jeremiah's ministry in the reign

57
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:52,320
of Josiah. And we'd find that when Josiah died, that Jeremiah, with a whole host of

58
00:05:52,320 --> 00:06:01,320
those within Judah, they wept at the death of Josiah. Jeremiah, however, also prophesied

59
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:08,320
and ministered during the time in which many in those that he was preaching to, they forsook

60
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:15,320
the commandment of the Lord. They did not hearken to the Word of God. We find that Jeremiah

61
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:20,320
is prophesying in such a day and he's ministering in such a day. If we're to take notes this

62
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:25,320
evening, first I would like you to take note of the coming judgment. It helps me to understand

63
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:32,320
the times in which Jeremiah is ministering, is prophesying, to understand and to take

64
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:37,320
note of the coming judgment. I'll just look at some verses here in the text in which we're

65
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:44,320
looking at this evening, but look in chapter 37 if you will. In verse number 6 of Jeremiah

66
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:49,320
37, the Bible says this, then came the word of the Lord unto the prophet Jeremiah saying,

67
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:58,320
thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel, thus shall ye say to the king of Judah. Now, pause

68
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:03,320
with me just for a moment at that phrase in verse number 7, for we find that the king

69
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:08,320
of Judah at this particular time is Zedekiah. And we see that in verse number 1 of Jeremiah

70
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:14,320
37, and king Zedekiah, the son of Josiah reigned. And it tells us in verse number 2, but neither

71
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:21,320
he nor his servants nor the people of the land did hearken unto the words of the Lord

72
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:28,320
which he spake by the prophet Jeremiah. And so we find that from the king to the servants

73
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:34,320
to the people, they did not hearken unto the words of the Lord which he spake by the prophet

74
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:40,320
Jeremiah. And so Jeremiah 37 tells us that they're not listening, they're not hearkening,

75
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:45,320
but yet we find that in verse number 3, they come to Jeremiah and they say, pray now unto

76
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:50,320
the Lord our God for us. And the word of the Lord comes unto Jeremiah, as we mentioned

77
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:55,320
in verse number 6, and God tells Jeremiah, thus shall you say to the king of Judah. Now

78
00:07:55,320 --> 00:08:01,320
this is the same king that has not hearkened. This is the same king that's not following

79
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:07,320
that which God has already revealed through his prophet and through the message. And it

80
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:13,320
says, thus shall you say to the king of Judah that sent you unto me to inquire of me. Behold,

81
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:19,320
Pharaoh's army, which has come forth to help you, shall return to Egypt into their own

82
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:26,320
land. And the Chaldeans shall come again and fight against this city and take it and burn

83
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:32,320
it with fire. Thus saith the Lord, deceive not yourselves, saying, the Chaldeans shall

84
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,320
surely depart from us, for they shall not depart. For though ye had smitten the whole

85
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:43,320
army of the Chaldeans that fight against you, and there remained but wounded men among them,

86
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:50,320
yet should they rise up every man in his tent and burn this city with fire. Now can

87
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,320
I tell you this evening, this isn't a pleasant message to have to deliver. Jeremiah is given

88
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,320
this instruction, he's given the word of the Lord, and as he goes back to Zedekiah and

89
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:04,320
those that had asked him to inquire, to go unto the Lord our God for us, that God does

90
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,320
not change the message. In fact, if you were to look back through the book of Jeremiah,

91
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,320
you would find that Jeremiah had faithfully proclaimed the same message. It was a message

92
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:21,320
of coming judgment. We find that in these verses of Scripture, they had this idea because

93
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:27,320
the Pharaoh's army, according to verse number 5, came forth out of Egypt, and the Chaldeans

94
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:32,320
that had besieged Jerusalem heard tidings of them, and they departed from Jerusalem.

95
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,320
So there's some folks that are thinking, okay, now the Chaldeans have left because

96
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,320
the Egyptians have come, and that's kind of our ticket out, if you will. That's our

97
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:46,320
deliverance. And Jeremiah, as he's speaking the word of the Lord unto these in Judah,

98
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,320
he says, listen, I want you to understand that this army, the army of the Egyptians,

99
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:58,320
they're going to return into Egypt. They're not going to help you. Furthermore, the Chaldeans,

100
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,320
they're going to come back.

101
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,320
and even if you had smitten the entire army

102
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,820
and they were all wounded men,

103
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:11,420
they would still conquer and burn this city.

104
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:14,220
That's not a very exciting message, right?

105
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,520
But we find that it's a message of coming judgment.

106
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,560
We find that in v. 17 of the same text of Scripture,

107
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,440
the Bible says,

108
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,520
then Zedekiah the king sent and took him out

109
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,220
and the king asked him secretly.

110
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,820
It's always of interest to me

111
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,120
when I read those words

112
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,120
where we find that this man Zedekiah the king

113
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,320
had already heard the word of the Lord from Jeremiah

114
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,420
on a number of occasions.

115
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:37,620
He says to Jeremiah in secrecy,

116
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:42,120
he says, is there any word from the Lord?

117
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,520
Yeah, the same word I've been giving you.

118
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,720
Coming judgment.

119
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,720
Notice at the end of v. 17,

120
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,620
Jeremiah said there is.

121
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,520
For said he, thou shalt be delivered

122
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:56,720
into the hand of the king of Babylon.

123
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,120
We find that as we look at the portion of Scripture

124
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,420
that is before us and we see that which would unfold,

125
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:06,120
you notice that it continues in chapter 38 in v. 1,

126
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,620
Then Shephatiah the son of Matan,

127
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,120
and Gedaliah the son of Pasher,

128
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,320
and Jucal the son of Shalamiah,

129
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,920
and Pasher the son of Malchiah

130
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,920
heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken

131
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,420
unto all the people.

132
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:21,020
Now they didn't like the words.

133
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,120
And we'll get to that in our next point.

134
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,620
But the Bible says this,

135
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,820
here are the words saying,

136
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,020
Thus saith the Lord,

137
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,520
this is the prophecy of Jeremiah

138
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,720
taking note of the coming judgment.

139
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,520
It says this,

140
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,820
He that remaineth in this city

141
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:33,920
shall die by the sword,

142
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,520
by the famine, and by the pestilence.

143
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,420
But he that goeth forth to the Chaldeans

144
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,420
shall live, for he shall have his life

145
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,720
for a prey and shall live.

146
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,620
Thus saith the Lord,

147
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,920
this city shall surely be given

148
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,820
into the hand of the king of Babylon's army,

149
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:50,420
which shall take it.

150
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,420
As we take note of coming judgment,

151
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,820
we see that judgment is announced by Jeremiah.

152
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,020
And then we read how that judgment

153
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,520
is actually experienced.

154
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,920
The Bible tells us as we've used

155
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,420
for our text verse this evening

156
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,720
in verse 28 of chapter 38,

157
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,320
that Jeremiah abode in the court of the prison

158
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,120
until the day that Jerusalem was taken.

159
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,120
And he was there when Jerusalem was taken.

160
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,720
Notice as we enter into the 39th chapter,

161
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,220
the Bible says in the ninth year

162
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,620
of Zedekiah king of Judah,

163
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,120
in the tenth month came Nebuchadnezzar

164
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,420
king of Babylon.

165
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:24,020
And all his army against Jerusalem

166
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,220
and they besieged it.

167
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,720
In the eleventh year of Zedekiah

168
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,620
in the fourth month,

169
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,820
the ninth day of the month,

170
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,220
the city was broken up.

171
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,720
The Bible tells us as you continue to look here

172
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,720
in verse number five,

173
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,520
it says that the Chaldeans army

174
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,720
pursued after them and overtook Zedekiah

175
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,120
in the plains of Jericho.

176
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,620
For we find that in verse number four,

177
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,120
the Bible says that Zedekiah

178
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,820
the king of Judah saw them

179
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,620
and all the men of war and they fled.

180
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,320
That was not following the direction

181
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:52,220
in which Jeremiah had given them.

182
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,020
And we find that the Bible tells us

183
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,320
that they overtook them

184
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,920
according to verse number five.

185
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,320
And notice what happens.

186
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,220
It says this at the end of verse number five

187
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,320
that they had them there in the land of Hamath

188
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,320
where he gave judgment upon him.

189
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,120
Notice verse six.

190
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,520
Then the king of Babylon slew

191
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,220
the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah

192
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,520
before his eyes.

193
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,620
Also, the king of Babylon

194
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:14,720
slew all the nobles of Judah.

195
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,020
Moreover, he put out Zedekiah's eyes

196
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,320
and bound him with chains

197
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,920
to carry him to Babylon.

198
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,320
The last thing that Zedekiah ever saw

199
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,520
with his physical vision

200
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,120
was the death of his sons

201
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,320
and of these nobles.

202
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,920
The Bible tells us in verse number eight

203
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,620
that the Chaldeans burned the king's house

204
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,120
and the houses of the people

205
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,520
with fire and break down the walls of Jerusalem.

206
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,420
So we begin to see here this evening

207
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,520
as we look at this portion of Scripture,

208
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,320
we note the coming judgment.

209
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,920
And we understand historically

210
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,520
the prophecy with regard to the judgment

211
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:53,020
and the judgment that was poured out.

212
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,620
And we read that and we see that.

213
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,620
I want you to take note though, however,

214
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,020
not only of the coming judgment,

215
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,920
but I want you to take note of the circumstances

216
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,820
in which Jeremiah faced.

217
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:04,320
So Jeremiah is a faithful servant of the Lord.

218
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,920
Jeremiah is faithfully proclaiming

219
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,020
the Word of the Lord.

220
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,720
When God spoke to Jeremiah

221
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,420
and said speak this message,

222
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,720
give this message,

223
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,220
deliver these words to My people,

224
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:17,220
Jeremiah faithfully did so.

225
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,820
He was obedient to the commandment of the Lord.

226
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,720
And we find that as we begin to look

227
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,119
at the circumstances in which he faced,

228
00:14:24,119 --> 00:14:28,119
that he dealt with some difficult circumstances.

229
00:14:28,119 --> 00:14:30,720
We find that back in chapter number 37,

230
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,320
according to verse number four,

231
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,520
the Bible says that Jeremiah came in

232
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,720
and went out among the people,

233
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,520
for they had not put him into prison.

234
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,619
And so we find that at that particular point,

235
00:14:41,619 --> 00:14:45,720
we begin to follow the course of Jeremiah

236
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,520
in these few chapters of Scripture

237
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,619
and these events that are provided to us

238
00:14:49,619 --> 00:14:51,619
that he's not yet in prison.

239
00:14:51,619 --> 00:14:54,020
That soon would change as we're aware of.

240
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,420
In verse number 15,

241
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,820
the Bible says after Jeremiah

242
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,020
had delivered this message of judgment,

243
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:00,619
it says,

244
00:15:00,619 --> 00:15:03,420
wherefore the princes were wroth with Jeremiah.

245
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,119
They didn't like his judgment.

246
00:15:05,119 --> 00:15:06,820
They didn't like the Word of the Lord.

247
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,820
They didn't like the message

248
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,720
that was being proclaimed.

249
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,220
And the Bible says that they smote him

250
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,420
and put him in prison

251
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:18,020
in the house of Jonathan the scribe,

252
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:21,220
for they had made that the prison.

253
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:24,020
So we find in chapter 37 and verse number 15

254
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,720
that he's now in prison.

255
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,220
According to chapter number 38,

256
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,119
after once again,

257
00:15:30,119 --> 00:15:32,820
we mentioned how in verse number one,

258
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,520
these folks, they heard the words

259
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,520
that Jeremiah had spoken.

260
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,619
And it says in verse number four of Jeremiah 38,

261
00:15:39,619 --> 00:15:42,220
therefore, the princes said unto the king,

262
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,720
as he beseeched thee,

263
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,220
let this man be put to death.

264
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:48,720
For thus he weakened the hands of the men of war

265
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,020
that remain in this city

266
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,619
in the hands of all the people,

267
00:15:51,619 --> 00:15:53,320
and speaking such words unto them.

268
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,720
For this man seeketh not the welfare of this people,

269
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,720
but the hurt.

270
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,720
Verse number five tells us that Zedekiah the king

271
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,920
gave them permission.

272
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,220
It says this, that he said,

273
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,619
behold, he is in your hand.

274
00:16:04,619 --> 00:16:07,220
For the king is not he that can do anything against you.

275
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,220
Verse six, then took they Jeremiah

276
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:12,720
and cast him into the dungeon of Melchizedek,

277
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,720
the son of Hamelak,

278
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,520
that was in the court of the prison.

279
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,020
And they let down Jeremiah with cords.

280
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,320
And in the dungeon there was no water but mire,

281
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,520
so Jeremiah sunk in the mire.

282
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,720
No longer is Jeremiah in prison now.

283
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,320
He's cast into the dungeon

284
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,520
in verse number six of chapter 38.

285
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,720
We find that there's some deliverance

286
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,720
and we'll look at that in our final point this evening.

287
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,420
And we skip down to verse number 13 of Jeremiah 38.

288
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:41,720
We find that they drew Jeremiah with cords

289
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,720
and took him up out of the dungeon.

290
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,720
Then it tells us that Jeremiah remained

291
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,720
in the court of the prison.

292
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,720
So he's in prison. He goes in the dungeon.

293
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,220
Now he's back in prison.

294
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,720
We've read as our text verse,

295
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,220
verse number 28,

296
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:57,220
that he's there in prison until Jerusalem is taken.

297
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,220
As we begin to think about the circumstances

298
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,720
in which Jeremiah was facing

299
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,220
and we take note of those circumstances,

300
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:06,020
and we see the description of what God gives us

301
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,920
with regard to those circumstances,

302
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,720
we understand that they were dire circumstances.

303
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,220
Notice with me the phrases of Scripture

304
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,420
that reveal to us the severity of that

305
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,220
which Jeremiah is dealing with

306
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:22,220
in chapter 37 and verse number 20.

307
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:24,420
The Bible says Jeremiah is speaking to Zedekiah.

308
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,720
This is when Zedekiah had come to him secretly.

309
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,420
And he's speaking there and it says,

310
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:30,920
Therefore, hear now, I pray thee,

311
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,420
O my Lord the King,

312
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,420
let my supplication, I pray thee,

313
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,420
be accepted before thee,

314
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,420
that thou cause me not to return

315
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:40,420
to the house of Jonathan the scribe.

316
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,420
That, remember, according to verse number 15,

317
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,420
that's where the prison was.

318
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,920
It says that they put him in prison

319
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,420
in the house of Jonathan the scribe

320
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,920
for they had made that the prison.

321
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,420
And so Jeremiah says to Zedekiah

322
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,420
that thou cause me not to return

323
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,920
to the house of Jonathan the scribe.

324
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,920
Notice the last phrase of verse number 20.

325
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,920
Lest I die there.

326
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,420
Lest I die there.

327
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,920
This is a very serious situation

328
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,920
in which Jeremiah is facing.

329
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:09,920
We find that he recognizes the potential

330
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,920
of him dying in that prison.

331
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,920
In chapter number 38, we've already mentioned

332
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,420
that in verse number 4,

333
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,920
the adversaries had the desire

334
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,420
to have Jeremiah put to death

335
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:23,920
because of the message that he proclaimed.

336
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:27,420
In verse number 10 of Jeremiah 38,

337
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,420
Ebed-Melech is used of the Lord.

338
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,420
He's an Ethiopian man.

339
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,920
And we'll deal with him a little bit

340
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,919
in our final point this evening.

341
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,419
We find that the Bible tells us

342
00:18:35,419 --> 00:18:38,419
in verse number 10 of Jeremiah 38,

343
00:18:38,419 --> 00:18:40,419
then the king commanded Ebed-Melech

344
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:41,919
the Ethiopian saying,

345
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:43,919
take from hence 30 men with thee

346
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,419
to take up Jeremiah the prophet

347
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:46,419
out of the dungeon.

348
00:18:46,419 --> 00:18:47,419
What's it say?

349
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:49,419
Before he die.

350
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:52,419
Dire circumstances.

351
00:18:52,419 --> 00:18:55,919
Great difficulty in which Jeremiah is facing.

352
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,419
We find that after Jeremiah

353
00:18:57,419 --> 00:18:58,919
is delivered from the dungeon

354
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:00,919
and sent back to the court of the prison,

355
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:02,419
according to verse number 13,

356
00:19:02,419 --> 00:19:03,919
he's now back in the prison

357
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,419
that in verse number 16,

358
00:19:05,419 --> 00:19:06,419
the Bible says,

359
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:07,919
so Zedekiah the king swears secretly

360
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:09,419
unto Jeremiah saying,

361
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:11,419
as the Lord liveth that made us this soul,

362
00:19:11,419 --> 00:19:12,919
I will not put thee to death,

363
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:14,919
neither will I give thee into the hand

364
00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:17,919
of these men that seek thy life.

365
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,419
Or people that were seeking the life of Jeremiah.

366
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:22,919
Why did they want him dead?

367
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:25,419
They didn't like his message.

368
00:19:25,419 --> 00:19:27,919
They didn't like the message of coming judgment.

369
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:29,419
They didn't like the message

370
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,919
that they were going to face

371
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:34,419
the judgment of God.

372
00:19:34,419 --> 00:19:35,419
By the way,

373
00:19:35,419 --> 00:19:37,419
the enemy understood,

374
00:19:37,419 --> 00:19:38,919
and we'll make note of this again

375
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:39,919
in just a few moments,

376
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,419
but in verse number 3 of chapter number 40,

377
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:43,419
the Bible says,

378
00:19:43,419 --> 00:19:45,419
now the Lord hath brought it and done

379
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:47,419
according as He had said,

380
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:49,419
because ye have sinned against the Lord

381
00:19:49,419 --> 00:19:51,419
and have not obeyed His voice,

382
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:57,919
therefore this thing is come upon you.

383
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,919
So the portion of Jeremiah that we're dealing with...

384
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:02,599
We started in chapter 37

385
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:04,439
with identifying the fact

386
00:20:04,439 --> 00:20:05,999
that they did not hearken

387
00:20:05,999 --> 00:20:07,839
unto the words of the Lord.

388
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:09,679
They did not want to hear

389
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,279
what the prophet had to say.

390
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:12,719
They did not want to hear

391
00:20:12,719 --> 00:20:14,119
the message of God.

392
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:16,499
And even as Zedekiah would go secretly

393
00:20:16,499 --> 00:20:17,879
and inquire and say,

394
00:20:17,879 --> 00:20:19,639
is there a word from the Lord?

395
00:20:19,639 --> 00:20:21,599
Is there any word from the Lord

396
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:23,199
that Jeremiah says it's the same

397
00:20:23,199 --> 00:20:25,159
that it has been?

398
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:26,399
You've not been obeying.

399
00:20:26,399 --> 00:20:27,599
You've not been following.

400
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:29,199
You've not been listening.

401
00:20:29,199 --> 00:20:30,799
And judgment is coming,

402
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,359
and we find that Jeremiah

403
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:34,919
in the midst of obeying the Lord,

404
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:37,439
in the midst of proclaiming the truth,

405
00:20:37,439 --> 00:20:42,319
that he faces some very difficult circumstances.

406
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:44,399
But I submit to you this evening

407
00:20:44,399 --> 00:20:46,319
that as Jeremiah would find himself

408
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:48,559
in these days of difficulty,

409
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:49,759
that as he'd find himself

410
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:51,799
dealing with many adversaries,

411
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:55,919
that God was well aware of where he was.

412
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,799
And not only was God aware

413
00:20:57,799 --> 00:20:59,759
of where Jeremiah was,

414
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:04,919
but God was able to take care of his man.

415
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:06,679
This evening, as I begin to think about

416
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:08,799
many things that have been said

417
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:11,359
with regard to not only the circumstances

418
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:12,479
in which we're facing,

419
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:14,759
but even the uncertainty of the days

420
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:16,399
that lie ahead of us,

421
00:21:16,399 --> 00:21:19,359
I take great comfort in knowing

422
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:21,359
that our God is in control.

423
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:23,199
I take great comfort in knowing

424
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:24,919
that our God is able to take care

425
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:27,119
of His children.

426
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,279
He's the Lord God Omnipotent.

427
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:30,439
And He's able.

428
00:21:30,439 --> 00:21:31,999
Does it mean that everything's going to be

429
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:33,839
just as easy as it's always been?

430
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:37,519
No, probably not.

431
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:39,119
Jeremiah dealt with some adversity.

432
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:40,239
I don't want to go to prison

433
00:21:40,239 --> 00:21:41,839
like Jeremiah's in prison,

434
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:43,439
but the reality is that

435
00:21:43,439 --> 00:21:45,519
listen, there are brothers and sisters in Christ

436
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:47,039
around the globe that are in prison

437
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,239
because of preaching the Word of God.

438
00:21:49,239 --> 00:21:51,239
And there have been many that have gone before us

439
00:21:51,239 --> 00:21:53,719
that have faithfully proclaimed the message

440
00:21:53,719 --> 00:21:54,839
of the Word of God

441
00:21:54,879 --> 00:21:59,559
and that suffered greatly because of it.

442
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:02,159
Honestly, in America,

443
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:06,119
thankfully, we've had a pretty easy road

444
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:08,199
here in our lifetime

445
00:22:08,199 --> 00:22:10,479
with regard to religious liberties,

446
00:22:10,479 --> 00:22:13,119
with regard to freedoms.

447
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:15,519
And I'm thankful for them.

448
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:18,159
But even though Jeremiah was living in a day

449
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,679
in which there was great wickedness

450
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:22,359
and we see about the coming judgment

451
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:24,359
and we see the circumstances

452
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:25,439
that he was facing,

453
00:22:25,439 --> 00:22:28,919
we understand that through all of it,

454
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:30,719
God was aware.

455
00:22:30,719 --> 00:22:32,399
God was able.

456
00:22:32,399 --> 00:22:33,799
As we look at the passage,

457
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:35,719
these chapters of Scripture,

458
00:22:35,719 --> 00:22:38,399
I not only note the coming judgment

459
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:39,479
and the circumstances,

460
00:22:39,479 --> 00:22:40,719
but I want you to take note

461
00:22:40,719 --> 00:22:43,119
of the compassion of the Lord.

462
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:45,079
Really, we'll look at it from two perspectives

463
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:46,279
this evening.

464
00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:48,159
Number one, I see the compassion of the Lord

465
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:49,839
as seen in Jeremiah's deliverance

466
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:51,799
from the dungeon.

467
00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:53,519
We find that there are these men

468
00:22:53,559 --> 00:22:56,759
in chapter 38 that want to kill Jeremiah.

469
00:22:56,759 --> 00:22:58,239
And they take Jeremiah

470
00:22:58,239 --> 00:22:59,679
and according to verse 6,

471
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,999
they let him down into this dungeon

472
00:23:01,999 --> 00:23:03,159
where there's no water

473
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:06,559
and Jeremiah sunk in the mire.

474
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,199
The Bible tells us of this man

475
00:23:08,199 --> 00:23:09,359
in verse 7,

476
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:11,999
Ebed-Melech the Ethiopian.

477
00:23:11,999 --> 00:23:13,079
He was one of the eunuchs

478
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:14,439
which was in the king's house.

479
00:23:14,439 --> 00:23:16,719
He heard that they had put Jeremiah

480
00:23:16,719 --> 00:23:18,279
in the dungeon.

481
00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:20,919
The king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin,

482
00:23:20,919 --> 00:23:22,999
Ebed-Melech went forth

483
00:23:22,999 --> 00:23:24,159
out of the king's house

484
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:25,919
and spake to the king saying,

485
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,119
notice what he says.

486
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:30,279
In v. 9 of Jeremiah 38,

487
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:32,039
My lord the king,

488
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:34,319
these men have done evil

489
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:35,759
in all that they have done

490
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:37,599
to Jeremiah the prophet,

491
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:40,239
whom they have cast into the dungeon

492
00:23:40,239 --> 00:23:42,559
and he is like to die for hunger

493
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,359
in the place where he is,

494
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:47,919
for there's no more bread in the city.

495
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:50,279
Then the king commanded Ebed-Melech

496
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:51,759
the Ethiopian saying,

497
00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:54,919
take from hence 30 men with thee

498
00:23:54,919 --> 00:23:56,639
and take up Jeremiah the prophet

499
00:23:56,639 --> 00:23:59,039
out of the dungeon before he die.

500
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,959
Notice what happens in v. 11,

501
00:24:00,959 --> 00:24:03,599
so Ebed-Melech took the men with him

502
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:05,439
and went into the house of the king

503
00:24:05,439 --> 00:24:06,519
under the treasury

504
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:08,599
and took thence old cast clouts

505
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:10,519
and old rotten rags

506
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:11,999
and let them down by cords

507
00:24:11,999 --> 00:24:13,999
into the dungeon of Jeremiah.

508
00:24:13,999 --> 00:24:16,959
Now can you imagine being Jeremiah?

509
00:24:16,959 --> 00:24:18,159
He's sinking in the mire.

510
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,479
He's in this dungeon.

511
00:24:20,479 --> 00:24:22,079
We find that they placed him there

512
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:23,279
so that he would die.

513
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:24,639
We find that Ebed-Melech

514
00:24:24,639 --> 00:24:26,479
as he approaches the king,

515
00:24:26,479 --> 00:24:28,279
he says, would you allow us to go?

516
00:24:28,279 --> 00:24:29,999
He's like to die for hunger

517
00:24:29,999 --> 00:24:33,639
in the place where he is.

518
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:35,919
The king gives permission in v. 10

519
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:37,839
that they go and deliver Jeremiah

520
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:39,359
before he'd die.

521
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:40,839
And it says in v. 12

522
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:42,679
that Ebed-Melech the Ethiopian

523
00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:44,199
sent him to Jeremiah.

524
00:24:44,199 --> 00:24:47,199
I mean, just hearing the words of Ebed-Melech

525
00:24:47,199 --> 00:24:49,319
must have brought some level of comfort

526
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:51,079
and encouragement to Jeremiah

527
00:24:51,079 --> 00:24:54,519
as he's there in that dungeon.

528
00:24:54,519 --> 00:24:56,439
It says, put now these old cast clouts

529
00:24:56,439 --> 00:24:58,799
and rotten rags under thine armholes

530
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,759
under the cords.

531
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:03,519
And Jeremiah did so.

532
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:06,279
So they drew up Jeremiah with cords

533
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:08,799
and took him out of the dungeon.

534
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,519
And Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.

535
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:13,039
I see God's deliverance here.

536
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,359
I understand that as I look

537
00:25:14,359 --> 00:25:16,079
at the passage of Scripture,

538
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:18,919
I begin to see how God is able

539
00:25:18,959 --> 00:25:20,879
to deliver and we see the compassion

540
00:25:20,879 --> 00:25:22,199
of the Lord and we understand

541
00:25:22,199 --> 00:25:23,479
that there were some men

542
00:25:23,479 --> 00:25:26,399
that had this evil plan against Jeremiah.

543
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:29,599
They wanted Jeremiah to die in the dungeon.

544
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:31,239
But the reality is that God wasn't done

545
00:25:31,239 --> 00:25:33,319
with Jeremiah.

546
00:25:33,319 --> 00:25:35,279
And God knew where Jeremiah was

547
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,399
and God would work on the behalf

548
00:25:37,399 --> 00:25:41,359
of Jeremiah by allowing this Ethiopian man

549
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:43,159
that is mentioned here, Ebed-Melech,

550
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:44,719
this Ethiopian man,

551
00:25:44,719 --> 00:25:46,719
to go and to inquire of the king

552
00:25:46,719 --> 00:25:48,279
and to seek permission from the king

553
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:49,839
to go with these 30 men

554
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:52,879
in order to bring this man Jeremiah out.

555
00:25:52,879 --> 00:25:54,519
It's of interest to me

556
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:57,239
that in v. 4, there were four of them

557
00:25:57,239 --> 00:25:59,399
that put Jeremiah in the dungeon

558
00:25:59,399 --> 00:26:00,839
and then there's a group of 30

559
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:08,679
that come to bring him out.

560
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:10,879
God is aware of where Jeremiah is

561
00:26:10,879 --> 00:26:12,799
and God is working on the behalf

562
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:14,999
of His servant.

563
00:26:14,999 --> 00:26:16,399
We find that Ebed-Melech

564
00:26:16,439 --> 00:26:19,479
would be rewarded for his work

565
00:26:19,479 --> 00:26:21,399
that he does here in Jeremiah 38

566
00:26:21,399 --> 00:26:22,639
if you look over quickly

567
00:26:22,639 --> 00:26:24,199
as kind of a sidebar.

568
00:26:24,199 --> 00:26:28,679
In Jeremiah 39, verses 16-18,

569
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:31,039
we see where this man would be rewarded

570
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,559
for his faithfulness.

571
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:34,999
It says this in v. 16,

572
00:26:34,999 --> 00:26:37,159
Go and speak to Ebed-Melech the Ethiopian,

573
00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:39,399
saying, Thus saith the Lord of hosts,

574
00:26:39,399 --> 00:26:41,679
the God of Israel,

575
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:43,839
Behold, I will bring My words upon this city

576
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:46,519
not for evil and not for good,

577
00:26:46,519 --> 00:26:49,439
and they shall be accomplished in that day before thee.

578
00:26:49,439 --> 00:26:51,639
Again, we see the reference to the coming judgment.

579
00:26:51,639 --> 00:26:53,079
We see the reference to the fact

580
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:55,559
that God was going to bring this judgment

581
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:58,279
upon His people because of their wickedness.

582
00:26:58,279 --> 00:27:01,319
But notice the promise in v. 17-18

583
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:02,839
with regard to Ebed-Melech.

584
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:03,799
It says this,

585
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:06,999
But I will deliver thee in that day,

586
00:27:06,999 --> 00:27:09,159
saith the Lord.

587
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:10,639
And thou shalt not be given

588
00:27:10,639 --> 00:27:11,799
into the hand of the men

589
00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:13,839
whom thou art afraid.

590
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:15,719
For I will surely deliver thee,

591
00:27:15,719 --> 00:27:17,599
and thou shalt not fall by the sword,

592
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:19,799
but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee.

593
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:22,359
Why? Notice this at the end of v. 18.

594
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:25,919
Because thou hast put thy trust in Me,

595
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:27,039
saith the Lord.

596
00:27:27,959 --> 00:27:30,319
See, this evening, we have to ask ourselves,

597
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:33,039
even as we, yes, we're looking at Jeremiah in particular,

598
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:36,159
but within the context of these chapters of Scripture,

599
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:38,199
we are introduced to this other man

600
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:40,599
that God used to bring deliverance

601
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:41,799
in the life of Jeremiah.

602
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:43,479
And we see how that he is rewarded.

603
00:27:43,479 --> 00:27:45,639
And we find that the Bible tells us

604
00:27:45,639 --> 00:27:48,119
that he put his trust in God.

605
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:50,679
Remember in v. 17, it says this,

606
00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:52,199
But I will deliver thee in that day.

607
00:27:52,199 --> 00:27:55,479
But we find that in this promise,

608
00:27:55,479 --> 00:27:58,039
the significance of the promise

609
00:27:58,039 --> 00:28:00,279
is that it begins in v. 16 by saying,

610
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:01,519
Thus saith the Lord of hosts,

611
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:02,839
the God of Israel.

612
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:05,999
He is able.

613
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:09,999
And Ebed-Melech receives this word

614
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:11,999
of encouragement from Jeremiah.

615
00:28:11,999 --> 00:28:15,199
And Jeremiah says, as he's speaking the Word of God,

616
00:28:15,199 --> 00:28:16,759
he says that God says,

617
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:18,079
This is what's going to happen

618
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:20,999
because thou hast put thy trust in Me.

619
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:22,439
God wants us to trust Him.

620
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:25,519
We sing the song, Trust and Obey.

621
00:28:26,639 --> 00:28:29,319
We speak about trusting the Lord.

622
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:31,439
But I wonder in your life and in my life,

623
00:28:31,439 --> 00:28:33,799
how often do we really trust Him?

624
00:28:35,479 --> 00:28:38,679
I made the statement to someone not too many weeks ago.

625
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:42,440
We're speaking about some historical things

626
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,399
within our nation and just various things

627
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:46,799
that are taking place even now today.

628
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,799
We're speaking about trust and confidence

629
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,760
and how some put their trust in chariots

630
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,239
and some put their trust in men.

631
00:28:52,239 --> 00:28:53,399
And we understand that.

632
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:56,679
You read history, you understand how those things work.

633
00:28:56,679 --> 00:29:00,559
But it's of interest to me that on our paper money,

634
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,399
it says,

635
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:05,959
In God, we trust.

636
00:29:05,959 --> 00:29:07,719
Now I understand there's a group of people today

637
00:29:07,719 --> 00:29:12,159
that would like to remove those four words from our money.

638
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:13,239
And I understand that.

639
00:29:13,239 --> 00:29:16,359
But the reality is that when it was first designed

640
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:18,399
and had those words placed upon it,

641
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:20,880
we see the significance of that.

642
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,639
In God, we trust.

643
00:29:22,639 --> 00:29:24,599
Is it not shameful this evening

644
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:28,719
that in the very money that we have in our currency

645
00:29:28,719 --> 00:29:30,320
in the United States of America,

646
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,119
that it says in God we trust,

647
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:36,320
yet we have many countless people that trust in money?

648
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,839
And the very money says in God we trust.

649
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:44,679
It's amazing.

650
00:29:44,679 --> 00:29:46,599
The Bible tells us about money that makes wings as eagles

651
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:49,599
and flies away.

652
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:52,079
We find that in the very currency that we have,

653
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:55,719
there's this reminder in God we trust.

654
00:29:55,719 --> 00:30:00,519
This man, Ibn Maliki, put his trust in the Lord God Almighty

655
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:01,519
this evening.

656
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:04,019
we find that our God still today

657
00:30:04,019 --> 00:30:06,419
wants us to trust Him.

658
00:30:06,419 --> 00:30:07,619
He wants us to trust Him

659
00:30:07,619 --> 00:30:10,519
even in days of what man would describe

660
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:12,199
as being uncertain days,

661
00:30:12,199 --> 00:30:13,759
as challenging days,

662
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:15,159
as difficult days.

663
00:30:15,159 --> 00:30:17,119
God says, I'm still in control.

664
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:18,559
I'm still on the throne.

665
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:20,599
Will you trust Me?

666
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:21,959
We find that Jeremiah,

667
00:30:21,959 --> 00:30:25,219
in the very midst of dealing with all that he's dealing with,

668
00:30:25,219 --> 00:30:28,019
and I want to be careful not to go to too many other portions

669
00:30:28,019 --> 00:30:31,059
because we could really just spend all night here

670
00:30:31,059 --> 00:30:34,359
looking through the passages in the book of Jeremiah,

671
00:30:34,359 --> 00:30:36,659
but in chapter 32,

672
00:30:36,659 --> 00:30:39,159
Jeremiah sees the Babylonians out there

673
00:30:39,159 --> 00:30:40,559
besieging the city

674
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:45,059
and God tells them to go by the field.

675
00:30:45,059 --> 00:30:48,259
To go and by the field.

676
00:30:48,259 --> 00:30:50,959
But we're going to be taken captive.

677
00:30:50,959 --> 00:30:52,159
By the field, Jeremiah.

678
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:54,959
You know what he did? He bought the field.

679
00:30:54,959 --> 00:30:56,659
He believed God.

680
00:30:56,659 --> 00:30:58,259
By the way, in the very passage,

681
00:30:58,259 --> 00:31:00,659
God mentions there about the remnant

682
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:01,559
that would return.

683
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:03,059
About the fact that the captivity

684
00:31:03,059 --> 00:31:05,459
would be a 70 year captivity.

685
00:31:05,459 --> 00:31:07,959
And certainly we understand historically

686
00:31:07,959 --> 00:31:11,159
that a remnant did return.

687
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:12,559
Jeremiah obeyed the Lord.

688
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:13,959
He trusted God.

689
00:31:13,959 --> 00:31:18,259
Listen, when all of the things that he could see,

690
00:31:18,259 --> 00:31:22,359
all that he could understand around him,

691
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:24,659
everything said the city's being taken.

692
00:31:24,659 --> 00:31:28,359
Even God told him the city was being taken.

693
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:29,659
But yet he trusted God.

694
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:31,659
God said, by the field.

695
00:31:31,659 --> 00:31:34,259
And he did.

696
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:35,959
Not only did Jeremiah trust God,

697
00:31:35,959 --> 00:31:38,159
but we find that Ebed-Melech trusted the Lord

698
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,959
through these actions that are recorded in chapter 38.

699
00:31:40,959 --> 00:31:42,959
We find that as we look at chapter 39

700
00:31:42,959 --> 00:31:45,059
and look at the reward that is offered to him

701
00:31:45,059 --> 00:31:46,659
and the word of encouragement

702
00:31:46,659 --> 00:31:50,359
that it was based upon his trust in God.

703
00:31:50,359 --> 00:31:52,859
You'll never go wrong trusting God.

704
00:31:52,859 --> 00:31:53,959
He'll never let you down.

705
00:31:53,959 --> 00:31:56,259
He'll never fail you.

706
00:31:56,259 --> 00:31:59,259
Our God is able.

707
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:00,859
God wants us to take Him at His word.

708
00:32:00,859 --> 00:32:03,459
He wants us to live by faith.

709
00:32:03,459 --> 00:32:05,159
I want you to notice not only

710
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:06,659
do we see the compassion of the Lord

711
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:09,159
in Jeremiah's deliverance from the dungeon,

712
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:12,159
but I see the compassion of the Lord

713
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:15,159
through the command of Nebuchadnezzar.

714
00:32:15,159 --> 00:32:17,059
We find that in chapter 39,

715
00:32:17,059 --> 00:32:18,159
as we read already,

716
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:21,459
we will not review these same verses

717
00:32:21,459 --> 00:32:23,559
and read them again.

718
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:26,059
We find that the Bible tells us

719
00:32:26,059 --> 00:32:27,959
that the Babylonians enter in

720
00:32:27,959 --> 00:32:29,659
and they take the city.

721
00:32:29,659 --> 00:32:32,659
And it says that the city was broken up

722
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:35,759
in verse 2 of Jeremiah 39.

723
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:37,859
We find that the Bible records for us

724
00:32:37,859 --> 00:32:40,659
how Zedekiah and a group of others

725
00:32:40,659 --> 00:32:42,259
sought to flee from the city

726
00:32:42,259 --> 00:32:43,459
and yet they are taken

727
00:32:43,459 --> 00:32:45,259
and the army of the Chaldeans

728
00:32:45,259 --> 00:32:47,059
pursued them and overtook them.

729
00:32:47,059 --> 00:32:49,259
And we find that his sons are slain

730
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:50,859
and his eyes are put out.

731
00:32:50,859 --> 00:32:52,459
And we come to that.

732
00:32:52,459 --> 00:32:53,959
We see all that's taking place.

733
00:32:53,959 --> 00:32:56,759
And if you know anything about the Babylonians,

734
00:32:57,059 --> 00:33:00,059
you understand if you look at the history

735
00:33:00,059 --> 00:33:03,059
and you see the power of these folks

736
00:33:03,059 --> 00:33:07,059
and really the brutality of these groups of people,

737
00:33:07,059 --> 00:33:09,859
and you find that you come to Jeremiah 39

738
00:33:09,859 --> 00:33:11,559
in verse 11,

739
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:13,959
and you notice a charge, a command

740
00:33:13,959 --> 00:33:18,559
that the king gives to the captain of the guard.

741
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:20,559
It's amazing.

742
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,059
In verse 11, the Bible says

743
00:33:22,059 --> 00:33:24,059
that Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon,

744
00:33:24,059 --> 00:33:26,259
gave charge concerning Jeremiah

745
00:33:26,259 --> 00:33:27,859
to Nebuchadnezzar Adan,

746
00:33:27,859 --> 00:33:29,759
the captain of the guard.

747
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:31,959
Now think about this.

748
00:33:31,959 --> 00:33:34,359
Just pause in your mind for a moment

749
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:37,859
and think about all that's taking place.

750
00:33:37,859 --> 00:33:39,459
The Chaldeans, the Babylonians,

751
00:33:39,459 --> 00:33:40,359
they've come in.

752
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:41,959
They've been in a place

753
00:33:41,959 --> 00:33:43,459
where they've besieged the city

754
00:33:43,459 --> 00:33:45,359
for a lengthy period of time.

755
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:48,859
The armies of Egypt and Pharaoh,

756
00:33:48,859 --> 00:33:51,159
they come in and the Chaldeans leave,

757
00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:53,259
but then the Egyptians leave

758
00:33:53,259 --> 00:33:54,859
and the Chaldeans come back.

759
00:33:54,959 --> 00:33:57,359
Now the Chaldeans have taken the city.

760
00:33:57,359 --> 00:33:58,459
It's broken up.

761
00:33:58,459 --> 00:34:00,759
They've already dealt with Zedekiah's sons.

762
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:01,959
They've dealt with Zedekiah.

763
00:34:01,959 --> 00:34:05,359
They've dealt with the nobles.

764
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:10,059
And we find all of these things going on.

765
00:34:10,059 --> 00:34:11,859
And the king of Babylon

766
00:34:11,859 --> 00:34:15,459
comes to the captain of the guard

767
00:34:15,459 --> 00:34:18,559
to speak to him about Jeremiah.

768
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:21,359
About one person

769
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,359
that's in the city.

770
00:34:24,459 --> 00:34:25,659
Isn't that amazing to you?

771
00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:27,959
I mean, we're going to see what he says.

772
00:34:27,959 --> 00:34:29,959
But I want you in your mind tonight

773
00:34:29,959 --> 00:34:35,559
to think about the power of our God.

774
00:34:35,559 --> 00:34:37,259
The compassion of our God.

775
00:34:37,259 --> 00:34:38,759
The ability of our God

776
00:34:38,759 --> 00:34:41,759
to take care of His people.

777
00:34:41,759 --> 00:34:43,259
From our human perspective,

778
00:34:43,259 --> 00:34:45,159
we would maybe come to the conclusion

779
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:47,559
that Nebuchadnezzar's not going to have any idea

780
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:49,259
who Jeremiah is.

781
00:34:49,259 --> 00:34:54,259
How does he get a hold of dealing with this situation

782
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:58,059
and taking time away from all the other events

783
00:34:58,059 --> 00:35:00,259
that are going on to deal with this?

784
00:35:00,259 --> 00:35:03,259
Because God is at work.

785
00:35:03,259 --> 00:35:04,859
God's taking care of His prophet.

786
00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:07,159
He's taking care of His man.

787
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:08,959
The Bible says this.

788
00:35:08,959 --> 00:35:12,759
Notice the charge, the command

789
00:35:12,759 --> 00:35:15,859
that Nebuchadnezzar gives to his captain of the guard,

790
00:35:15,859 --> 00:35:17,359
Nebuchadnezzar Adan.

791
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:20,659
In verse 12, it says this.

792
00:35:20,659 --> 00:35:29,259
Take him and look well to him.

793
00:35:29,259 --> 00:35:32,559
Hold on, you want me to do what?

794
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:34,359
Look well to him.

795
00:35:34,359 --> 00:35:39,659
Furthermore, do him no harm.

796
00:35:39,659 --> 00:35:45,159
Can you imagine saying this to a captain of the guard?

797
00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:48,159
A man that was a man of war.

798
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:54,259
No idea how many he had slain in his life.

799
00:35:54,259 --> 00:35:58,859
And the king says, take him

800
00:35:58,859 --> 00:36:01,159
and look well to him

801
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,359
and do him no harm.

802
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:04,759
And then it says this,

803
00:36:04,759 --> 00:36:12,359
but do unto him even as he shall say unto thee.

804
00:36:12,359 --> 00:36:14,059
You want me to do what?

805
00:36:14,059 --> 00:36:16,959
If you know the passage of Scripture,

806
00:36:16,959 --> 00:36:19,959
don't act like, well, I heard this before.

807
00:36:19,959 --> 00:36:24,259
This is amazing that God would work

808
00:36:24,259 --> 00:36:28,659
in the life of this wicked, ungodly king

809
00:36:28,659 --> 00:36:30,159
and captain of the guard,

810
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:31,559
and He brings this.

811
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:32,959
Listen, God is at work.

812
00:36:32,959 --> 00:36:35,659
He knows where you are.

813
00:36:35,659 --> 00:36:37,759
He knows where I am.

814
00:36:37,759 --> 00:36:39,459
He knows what we're dealing with.

815
00:36:39,459 --> 00:36:42,459
He is able to deliver us.

816
00:36:42,459 --> 00:36:44,259
I preached a message in the very beginning

817
00:36:44,259 --> 00:36:45,659
of this whole COVID thing

818
00:36:45,659 --> 00:36:46,759
from the book of Daniel.

819
00:36:46,759 --> 00:36:48,259
I think it was the very first Sunday

820
00:36:48,259 --> 00:36:50,059
when I preached all day long

821
00:36:50,059 --> 00:36:51,959
and had different crowds of people in here

822
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:53,959
each service as we were seeking

823
00:36:53,959 --> 00:36:55,559
to maintain the numbers by which

824
00:36:55,559 --> 00:36:57,359
our governor was restricting us by.

825
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:59,359
And I preached from Daniel

826
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:03,059
that our God is able to deliver us.

827
00:37:03,059 --> 00:37:04,859
And He is.

828
00:37:04,859 --> 00:37:06,659
And here Jeremiah,

829
00:37:06,659 --> 00:37:08,859
remember, the very people

830
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:10,659
that he was ministering to,

831
00:37:10,659 --> 00:37:13,359
the very people that he was delivering a message to,

832
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:14,859
they threw him in prison.

833
00:37:14,859 --> 00:37:16,259
They wanted him dead.

834
00:37:16,259 --> 00:37:18,659
They put him in the dungeon.

835
00:37:18,659 --> 00:37:22,459
And now comes this wicked Babylonian king,

836
00:37:22,459 --> 00:37:25,159
and he says to his captain of the guard,

837
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,659
take him.

838
00:37:26,659 --> 00:37:29,259
He says, look well to him.

839
00:37:29,259 --> 00:37:31,259
He says, do him no harm.

840
00:37:31,259 --> 00:37:33,459
By the way, here's what you need to do.

841
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:37,459
Whatever he tells you to do, do.

842
00:37:37,459 --> 00:37:40,259
I'm not sure that Nebuchadnezzar had ever received

843
00:37:40,259 --> 00:37:45,159
instruction from Nebuchadnezzar in this fashion before.

844
00:37:45,459 --> 00:37:50,659
I'm not sure that this is a common approach

845
00:37:50,659 --> 00:37:55,059
to dealing with a conquered people.

846
00:37:55,059 --> 00:37:57,659
But yet, God is working.

847
00:37:57,659 --> 00:38:02,659
God is protecting His man.

848
00:38:02,659 --> 00:38:04,259
The Bible says in v. 13,

849
00:38:04,259 --> 00:38:07,559
so Nebuchadnezzar, Adam, the captain of the guard,

850
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:10,059
says that he sent Nebuchadnezzar,

851
00:38:10,059 --> 00:38:13,659
Rabsarus, Nergal, Sherezer, Rabmag,

852
00:38:13,659 --> 00:38:16,159
all the king of Babylon's princes.

853
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:17,859
He even sent them and took Jeremiah

854
00:38:17,859 --> 00:38:19,159
out of the court of the prison,

855
00:38:19,159 --> 00:38:21,359
committed him unto Gedaliah, the son of Ahiakim,

856
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:22,659
the son of Shaphan,

857
00:38:22,659 --> 00:38:23,959
that he should carry him home,

858
00:38:23,959 --> 00:38:25,959
so he dwelt among the people.

859
00:38:25,959 --> 00:38:28,759
We read the latter part of chapter 39 already

860
00:38:28,759 --> 00:38:32,759
as it dealt with the situation with Ibn Malik,

861
00:38:32,759 --> 00:38:37,159
so skip down to v. 1 of chapter 40 if you will.

862
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:37,959
It says this,

863
00:38:37,959 --> 00:38:39,859
the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord

864
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:41,359
after that Nebuchadnezzar, Adam,

865
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:43,859
the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah

866
00:38:43,859 --> 00:38:45,159
when he had taken him,

867
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:46,759
being bound in chains among all

868
00:38:46,759 --> 00:38:49,359
that were carried away captive of Jerusalem and Judah,

869
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:52,159
which were carried away captive unto Babylon.

870
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:54,559
And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah

871
00:38:54,559 --> 00:38:55,359
and said unto him,

872
00:38:55,359 --> 00:39:00,259
The Lord thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place.

873
00:39:00,259 --> 00:39:02,359
Now the Lord hath brought it and done

874
00:39:02,359 --> 00:39:04,159
according as he hath said,

875
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:05,559
because ye have sinned against the Lord

876
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:06,959
and have not obeyed His voice.

877
00:39:06,959 --> 00:39:09,259
Therefore this thing has come upon you.

878
00:39:09,259 --> 00:39:13,259
And now, behold, I loose thee this day from the chains

879
00:39:13,259 --> 00:39:15,059
which were upon thine hand.

880
00:39:15,059 --> 00:39:17,159
Who put those chains there?

881
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:18,759
His own people.

882
00:39:18,759 --> 00:39:22,059
If it seem good unto thee to come with me into Babylon,

883
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:26,559
come, and I will look well unto thee.

884
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:29,459
But if it seem ill unto thee to come with me into Babylon,

885
00:39:29,459 --> 00:39:31,159
forbear.

886
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:33,359
Behold, all the land is before thee.

887
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:36,559
Whither it seemeth good and convenient for thee to go,

888
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:39,259
thither go.

889
00:39:39,259 --> 00:39:40,359
It says in verse number 5,

890
00:39:40,359 --> 00:39:42,059
Now, while he was not yet gone back,

891
00:39:42,059 --> 00:39:44,559
he said, Go back also to Goliath the son of Ahiakim,

892
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:45,959
the son of Shaphan,

893
00:39:45,959 --> 00:39:47,659
whom the king of Babylon hath made governor

894
00:39:47,659 --> 00:39:48,659
over the cities of Judah,

895
00:39:48,659 --> 00:39:50,659
and dwell with him among the people.

896
00:39:50,659 --> 00:39:53,559
Or go wheresoever it seemeth convenient unto thee to go.

897
00:39:53,559 --> 00:39:55,359
Notice the last part of verse number 5.

898
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:59,459
So the captain of the guard gave him vittles and a reward

899
00:39:59,459 --> 00:40:01,459
and let him go.

900
00:40:01,459 --> 00:40:04,819
He gave him a bit of a reward and let him go.

901
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:12,899
Let's begin to look at the passage of Scripture and stand and view what Jeremiah has just

902
00:40:12,899 --> 00:40:14,619
experienced.

903
00:40:14,619 --> 00:40:16,739
I see it as being the compassion of the Lord.

904
00:40:16,739 --> 00:40:20,259
I see how that God is taking care of His servant.

905
00:40:20,259 --> 00:40:24,779
We understand that Jeremiah one day would die.

906
00:40:24,779 --> 00:40:30,979
We'll begin to look at these events that unfold and are provided historically for us in chapters

907
00:40:30,979 --> 00:40:33,539
37 through 40.

908
00:40:33,539 --> 00:40:36,459
We see how that God was taking care of His man.

909
00:40:36,459 --> 00:40:39,259
He was taking care of His servant.

910
00:40:39,259 --> 00:40:45,739
And I wonder this evening, as we would look at a passage of Scripture like this, I wonder

911
00:40:45,739 --> 00:40:51,739
if we really believe tonight that God is able to take care of us.

912
00:40:51,739 --> 00:40:57,779
I wonder this evening if we believe that God is able to take care of us, if we begin to

913
00:40:57,779 --> 00:41:05,499
remove certain things that we've come to take for granted in our own nation.

914
00:41:05,499 --> 00:41:08,299
I'm thankful for the Bill of Rights.

915
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,899
I'm thankful for the U.S. Constitution.

916
00:41:10,899 --> 00:41:14,259
I'm thankful for the First Amendment.

917
00:41:14,259 --> 00:41:15,259
Thankful for those things.

918
00:41:15,259 --> 00:41:19,579
We have brothers and sisters around the globe that don't have a U.S. Constitution.

919
00:41:19,579 --> 00:41:25,339
They don't have the Bill of Rights, but yet they serve God faithfully and God is using

920
00:41:25,339 --> 00:41:30,979
them and God protects them and God delivers them.

921
00:41:30,979 --> 00:41:35,499
I hear testimony from missionaries all of the time as to how God is working and what

922
00:41:35,499 --> 00:41:36,499
God is doing.

923
00:41:36,499 --> 00:41:39,619
It encourages my heart.

924
00:41:39,619 --> 00:41:44,099
And this evening, I hope that we'd understand that as we live here in America and we have

925
00:41:44,099 --> 00:41:46,739
great freedoms and I'm thankful for them.

926
00:41:46,739 --> 00:41:51,459
And there are many that are sounding the alarm today and no doubt, just as I have received

927
00:41:52,019 --> 00:41:56,619
countless pieces of communication, no doubt you've come across some things where people

928
00:41:56,619 --> 00:42:01,859
are sounding the alarm on what's going to happen in the days ahead and how our religious

929
00:42:01,859 --> 00:42:04,619
liberties are being attacked and so on and so forth.

930
00:42:04,619 --> 00:42:09,419
And I say this, listen, I'm not interested in dealing with hardship, but I'm thankful

931
00:42:09,419 --> 00:42:11,999
to know that God is in control.

932
00:42:11,999 --> 00:42:15,019
I'm thankful to know that He sits upon His throne.

933
00:42:15,019 --> 00:42:20,279
I'm thankful to know that my responsibility and your responsibility is to be faithful

934
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:23,959
to God and to trust Him.

935
00:42:23,959 --> 00:42:30,159
This evening, as we think about the truth that is before us and we look at the events

936
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:35,499
in the life of Jeremiah, we say, is it not true that Jeremiah, as he experienced the

937
00:42:35,499 --> 00:42:39,039
deliverance of God, as he experienced the compassion of God, is it not true that we

938
00:42:39,039 --> 00:42:41,039
serve the same God?

939
00:42:41,039 --> 00:42:44,439
Is it not true that he too could work on our behalf?

940
00:42:44,439 --> 00:42:49,559
That he could provide and protect us and he could deliver us from any of the opposition

941
00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:51,999
that we might face in dealing with the blessing.

942
00:42:51,999 --> 00:42:58,839
Now we see, listen, Jeremiah dealt with some hardship, but God knew where he was.

943
00:42:58,839 --> 00:43:05,919
And we take note that Jeremiah was faithful and Jeremiah was committed to obedience.

944
00:43:05,919 --> 00:43:11,719
It was not, I'm going to obey and I'm going to be faithful because it's easy.

945
00:43:11,719 --> 00:43:20,639
In fact, because of his obedience and his faithfulness, it cost him dear.

946
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:22,319
But he pleased God.

947
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:27,039
I want you to, with the thought of what we've looked at in Jeremiah this evening, I want

948
00:43:27,039 --> 00:43:31,479
you to turn to the book of 2 Timothy, if you will.

949
00:43:31,479 --> 00:43:36,999
And I hope to conclude the message this evening with a thought from this third chapter of

950
00:43:36,999 --> 00:43:40,939
2 Timothy chapter number 3.

951
00:43:40,939 --> 00:43:45,619
And I hope that God would help us this evening.

952
00:43:45,619 --> 00:43:52,059
That God would encourage us and strengthen our faith by seeing the testimony of Jeremiah

953
00:43:52,059 --> 00:43:56,299
in those chapters that we've reviewed quickly this evening.

954
00:43:56,299 --> 00:43:59,259
And then look at this truth that Paul would give Timothy.

955
00:43:59,259 --> 00:44:04,499
We looked this morning at some of 2 Timothy chapter 4, but I want you to notice in chapter

956
00:44:04,499 --> 00:44:09,739
number 3, the Bible begins this way.

957
00:44:09,739 --> 00:44:13,139
This know also.

958
00:44:13,139 --> 00:44:18,419
Now it's of interest to me that many times, as you look at the Word of God, that you find

959
00:44:18,419 --> 00:44:21,219
that God wants His people to be aware of some things.

960
00:44:21,219 --> 00:44:23,659
He wants us to be informed.

961
00:44:23,659 --> 00:44:27,379
He does not want His people to be ignorant.

962
00:44:27,379 --> 00:44:31,139
He says this know also.

963
00:44:31,139 --> 00:44:32,899
Paul is speaking to Timothy.

964
00:44:32,899 --> 00:44:36,939
We find the preservation of Scripture that God is giving us this truth.

965
00:44:36,939 --> 00:44:38,779
And there's some things that we need to be aware of.

966
00:44:38,779 --> 00:44:42,459
There's some things that we need to be informed of.

967
00:44:42,459 --> 00:44:46,859
We find that Paul says on a number of occasions in other portions of Scripture, I would not

968
00:44:46,859 --> 00:44:49,239
have you be ignorant brethren.

969
00:44:49,239 --> 00:44:50,499
He wants them to be informed.

970
00:44:50,499 --> 00:44:52,139
He wants them to have the instruction.

971
00:44:52,139 --> 00:44:54,979
He wants them to have the Word of the Lord.

972
00:44:54,979 --> 00:45:01,019
In this evening, we come to this chapter and the Bible says this know also.

973
00:45:01,019 --> 00:45:02,339
Be aware of these things.

974
00:45:02,339 --> 00:45:04,419
Have knowledge of these things.

975
00:45:04,419 --> 00:45:11,939
That in the last days, perilous times shall come.

976
00:45:11,939 --> 00:45:19,539
For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient

977
00:45:19,539 --> 00:45:22,919
to parents, unthankful, unholy.

978
00:45:22,919 --> 00:45:23,919
It continues.

979
00:45:23,919 --> 00:45:29,519
Without natural affection, truce breakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers

980
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:35,139
of those that are good, traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasure more than

981
00:45:35,139 --> 00:45:37,279
lovers of God.

982
00:45:37,279 --> 00:45:41,559
You read these descriptive terms, can you not see the fulfillment of these very things

983
00:45:41,559 --> 00:45:45,279
even in the world in which we live today?

984
00:45:45,279 --> 00:45:52,159
What great description is given with regard to these last days and that which would characterize

985
00:45:52,159 --> 00:45:56,599
these last days, and God says He wants us to know this.

986
00:45:56,599 --> 00:46:02,399
Verse 5, having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof, from such turn away.

987
00:46:02,399 --> 00:46:06,919
For of this sort are they which creep into houses and lead captive silly women, laden

988
00:46:06,919 --> 00:46:13,919
with sins, led away with divers lust, ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge

989
00:46:13,919 --> 00:46:18,239
of the truth.

990
00:46:18,239 --> 00:46:26,679
He deals with the description of these last days.

991
00:46:26,679 --> 00:46:34,079
He says this, beginning in verse number 10, about the things that he knew with regard

992
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:35,079
to Paul.

993
00:46:35,079 --> 00:46:40,039
But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity,

994
00:46:40,039 --> 00:46:44,719
patience, persecutions, afflictions which came unto me at Antioch, Iconium, Lystra,

995
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:48,959
what persecutions I endured, notice this phrase, but out of them all the Lord delivered

996
00:46:48,959 --> 00:46:51,839
me.

997
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:57,999
I would encourage you, I actually gave a homework assignment on Wednesday night, I said I want

998
00:46:57,999 --> 00:47:01,119
you to go back and read Psalm 48, don't raise your hand and tell me if you did, but I got

999
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:05,719
one message from someone that said I went and read it and it blessed my heart.

1000
00:47:05,719 --> 00:47:09,799
It began to share with me some things that God showed them in that psalm and I was encouraged

1001
00:47:09,799 --> 00:47:10,799
by that.

1002
00:47:11,799 --> 00:47:14,599
The Word of God is powerful.

1003
00:47:14,599 --> 00:47:18,959
I want you to think about what Paul mentions in one verse of Scripture, he says about Antioch,

1004
00:47:18,959 --> 00:47:24,159
Iconium, and Lystra, and you think about these statements that are made and how that Paul

1005
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:28,119
says the persecutions that he endured, but out of them all the Lord delivered me.

1006
00:47:28,119 --> 00:47:33,839
I would encourage you this evening, if not tonight, maybe one day this week, to go back

1007
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:38,399
and read Acts 13 and Acts 14 and read about that first missionary journey of the Apostle

1008
00:47:38,399 --> 00:47:44,079
Paul and read about the things that he suffered, the things that he endured, and how that God

1009
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:46,379
delivered him.

1010
00:47:46,379 --> 00:47:50,519
By the way, for some of us we might not call it deliverance as he did, he was stoned and

1011
00:47:50,519 --> 00:48:01,999
left for dead, but God raised him up and he went back and preached some more.

1012
00:48:01,999 --> 00:48:17,519
Notice verse 12 of 2 Timothy 3,

1013
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:20,839
It does not tell us that men are going to get better and better, they're going to get

1014
00:48:20,839 --> 00:48:22,479
worse and worse.

1015
00:48:22,479 --> 00:48:24,719
Are we not seeing it?

1016
00:48:24,719 --> 00:48:25,999
Honestly.

1017
00:48:25,999 --> 00:48:31,319
We look around our country, we look around our world.

1018
00:48:31,319 --> 00:48:33,439
We can see the evil.

1019
00:48:33,439 --> 00:48:37,679
We can see, as Isaiah speaks of, where they call evil good and good evil.

1020
00:48:37,679 --> 00:48:39,639
We see it.

1021
00:48:39,639 --> 00:48:42,319
We see where they legislate wickedness.

1022
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:46,919
It's abounding in our nation.

1023
00:48:46,919 --> 00:48:50,799
And it's not going to get better and better.

1024
00:48:50,799 --> 00:48:55,939
Contrary to what some would like for you to believe, contrary to what some would stand

1025
00:48:55,939 --> 00:49:02,259
and proclaim as they would seek to garner your vote, or whatever it might be, and we

1026
00:49:02,259 --> 00:49:06,619
find that the Bible tells us that evil men and seducers, they're going to wax worse and

1027
00:49:06,619 --> 00:49:09,259
worse.

1028
00:49:09,259 --> 00:49:14,339
And with that message you say, okay, what is it that I'm supposed to do then?

1029
00:49:14,339 --> 00:49:17,899
Paul gives all this information to Timothy, he says, I want you to know this, I want you

1030
00:49:17,899 --> 00:49:21,819
to understand the characteristics of these last days, I want you to understand that it's

1031
00:49:21,819 --> 00:49:25,179
going to be perilous times, and here's what it's going to be like, and here's what you're

1032
00:49:25,179 --> 00:49:26,179
going to deal with.

1033
00:49:26,179 --> 00:49:29,699
And by the way, if you live godly in Christ Jesus, you're going to suffer persecution

1034
00:49:29,699 --> 00:49:33,299
because evil men and seducers are going to wax worse and worse.

1035
00:49:33,299 --> 00:49:37,019
And then he says this, continue.

1036
00:49:37,019 --> 00:49:39,539
That's what your job is.

1037
00:49:39,539 --> 00:49:44,219
But continue, verse 14.

1038
00:49:44,219 --> 00:49:51,119
But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned, and hast been assured of, knowing

1039
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:55,359
of whom thou hast learned them.

1040
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:58,879
It's a simple instruction, continue.

1041
00:49:58,879 --> 00:50:01,479
It's a whole lot easier.

1042
00:50:01,479 --> 00:50:02,839
to hear the instruction

1043
00:50:02,839 --> 00:50:04,119
and to give the instruction

1044
00:50:04,119 --> 00:50:06,519
than to heed the instruction.

1045
00:50:06,519 --> 00:50:08,759
For in the midst of the adversity

1046
00:50:08,759 --> 00:50:10,199
and the difficulties

1047
00:50:10,199 --> 00:50:13,119
and the perilous times that are described,

1048
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:15,639
the reality is that many have said,

1049
00:50:15,639 --> 00:50:17,639
no, I'm not interested in all of that.

1050
00:50:17,639 --> 00:50:20,879
I'm not interested in dealing with the effects

1051
00:50:20,879 --> 00:50:23,519
and the persecutions that would come my way

1052
00:50:23,519 --> 00:50:27,799
because of staying faithful and continuing.

1053
00:50:27,799 --> 00:50:29,479
Paul enters into the fourth chapter

1054
00:50:29,479 --> 00:50:31,719
before he will make the statements

1055
00:50:31,719 --> 00:50:35,199
with regard to him finishing his course.

1056
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:37,519
And he enters into this fourth chapter

1057
00:50:37,519 --> 00:50:40,799
with a charge for his son in the faith, Timothy.

1058
00:50:40,799 --> 00:50:42,519
He says, I charge thee before God

1059
00:50:42,519 --> 00:50:43,719
and the Lord Jesus Christ,

1060
00:50:43,719 --> 00:50:45,439
who shall judge the quick and the dead

1061
00:50:45,439 --> 00:50:47,839
as it is appearing in His kingdom.

1062
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:49,599
Preach the Word.

1063
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:51,319
Preach the Word.

1064
00:50:51,319 --> 00:50:53,639
Be instant in season, out of season.

1065
00:50:53,639 --> 00:50:55,039
Reprove, rebuke, exhort

1066
00:50:55,039 --> 00:50:57,079
with all longsuffering and doctrine.

1067
00:50:57,079 --> 00:50:58,359
For the time will come

1068
00:50:58,359 --> 00:51:01,519
when they will not endure sound doctrine.

1069
00:51:01,519 --> 00:51:02,599
But after their own lusts

1070
00:51:02,599 --> 00:51:03,919
shall they heap to themselves

1071
00:51:03,919 --> 00:51:06,239
teachers having itching ears.

1072
00:51:06,239 --> 00:51:08,479
They shall turn away their ears from the truth

1073
00:51:08,479 --> 00:51:10,959
and shall be turned into fables.

1074
00:51:10,959 --> 00:51:12,119
But watch thou in all things,

1075
00:51:12,119 --> 00:51:12,999
endure afflictions,

1076
00:51:12,999 --> 00:51:14,159
do the work of the evangelist,

1077
00:51:14,159 --> 00:51:18,399
make full proof of thy ministry.

1078
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:20,439
Let's begin to think about

1079
00:51:20,439 --> 00:51:22,479
the days in which we're living.

1080
00:51:22,479 --> 00:51:24,599
I take great encouragement and comfort

1081
00:51:24,599 --> 00:51:27,279
from looking at the passage of Scripture

1082
00:51:27,279 --> 00:51:28,239
in the book of Jeremiah

1083
00:51:28,279 --> 00:51:30,519
that we've studied this evening.

1084
00:51:30,519 --> 00:51:31,759
Jeremiah was living in a day

1085
00:51:31,759 --> 00:51:33,799
when judgment was coming.

1086
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:36,399
He faced some terrible circumstances,

1087
00:51:36,399 --> 00:51:39,159
but he experienced the compassion of God.

1088
00:51:39,159 --> 00:51:41,919
He saw God take care of him.

1089
00:51:41,919 --> 00:51:45,999
He saw God use Ibed-Melech

1090
00:51:45,999 --> 00:51:47,639
to get a host of men together

1091
00:51:47,639 --> 00:51:48,919
to deliver him from the dungeon.

1092
00:51:48,919 --> 00:51:52,959
Why? Because God wasn't done with him yet.

1093
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:58,199
He gave the direction to a wicked

1094
00:51:58,199 --> 00:52:05,439
Babylonian king to tell his captain of the guard,

1095
00:52:05,439 --> 00:52:06,999
don't do him any harm.

1096
00:52:06,999 --> 00:52:08,679
Look well to him.

1097
00:52:08,679 --> 00:52:09,439
Take good care of him.

1098
00:52:09,439 --> 00:52:15,959
By the way, here's just whatever he says to do, do.

1099
00:52:15,959 --> 00:52:17,119
And Nebuchadnezzar of Dan

1100
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:22,959
gives Jeremiah supplies, a reward,

1101
00:52:22,959 --> 00:52:25,439
and sends him on his way.

1102
00:52:25,439 --> 00:52:26,119
And this evening,

1103
00:52:26,119 --> 00:52:28,959
we serve the God of the universe.

1104
00:52:28,959 --> 00:52:30,639
And He is able.

1105
00:52:30,639 --> 00:52:33,319
We don't need to take this approach tonight

1106
00:52:33,319 --> 00:52:36,239
of the sky is falling.

1107
00:52:36,239 --> 00:52:39,279
Our God has a plan.

1108
00:52:39,279 --> 00:52:41,799
And His plan is that we would be faithful

1109
00:52:41,799 --> 00:52:44,599
unto death.

1110
00:52:44,599 --> 00:52:45,799
Amen?

1111
00:52:45,799 --> 00:52:46,839
Then we'd be faithful.

1112
00:52:46,839 --> 00:52:48,119
Just serve Him.

1113
00:52:48,119 --> 00:52:51,079
Just watch Him work.

1114
00:52:51,079 --> 00:52:53,599
I was reading this afternoon

1115
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:55,319
and someone was making a comment on faith.

1116
00:52:55,319 --> 00:52:57,479
He was a preacher of yesteryear.

1117
00:52:57,479 --> 00:52:59,639
And he said the thing that's interesting about faith

1118
00:52:59,639 --> 00:53:05,439
is that faith goes beyond human ability

1119
00:53:05,439 --> 00:53:07,799
because if it's humanly possible,

1120
00:53:07,799 --> 00:53:11,279
God doesn't get the glory.

1121
00:53:11,279 --> 00:53:14,839
And so faith goes a step beyond human possibility.

1122
00:53:14,839 --> 00:53:16,919
That's good.

1123
00:53:16,919 --> 00:53:19,199
Because we believe that our God is able.

1124
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:21,199
My trust this evening

1125
00:53:21,199 --> 00:53:24,919
is not in a system, in a government.

1126
00:53:24,919 --> 00:53:29,039
My trust this evening is not in some leader.

1127
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:34,159
My trust this evening is not in some words on a page.

1128
00:53:34,159 --> 00:53:36,159
I'm thankful for the things that we have

1129
00:53:36,159 --> 00:53:39,119
and the freedoms that we have.

1130
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:40,199
But if you take it all away,

1131
00:53:40,199 --> 00:53:42,399
you still have God.

1132
00:53:42,399 --> 00:53:44,439
And He's still in control.

1133
00:53:44,439 --> 00:53:48,199
And He's still God.

1134
00:53:48,199 --> 00:53:51,759
And we must still serve Him.

1135
00:53:51,759 --> 00:53:53,519
Do you believe that tonight?

1136
00:53:53,559 --> 00:53:55,719
There are people all over the world tonight.

1137
00:53:55,719 --> 00:53:56,959
You look at our missions map

1138
00:53:56,959 --> 00:53:58,439
when you leave here this evening,

1139
00:53:58,439 --> 00:54:00,879
and you remind yourself of the places

1140
00:54:00,879 --> 00:54:04,799
in which we have missionaries.

1141
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:06,639
That literally because of meeting

1142
00:54:06,639 --> 00:54:08,359
in the fashion in which we're meeting tonight,

1143
00:54:08,359 --> 00:54:10,999
they could be imprisoned or worse.

1144
00:54:10,999 --> 00:54:12,479
Literally because of the people

1145
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:14,319
that they share the Gospel with,

1146
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:16,439
that if they trust Christ as their Savior,

1147
00:54:16,439 --> 00:54:18,279
they're disowned by their family.

1148
00:54:18,279 --> 00:54:19,759
At times, they're beaten.

1149
00:54:19,759 --> 00:54:22,319
At times, they're put to death

1150
00:54:22,359 --> 00:54:25,479
because of the culture in which they're in.

1151
00:54:25,479 --> 00:54:28,599
We have such freedoms and such liberties.

1152
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:31,159
And I'm thankful for them.

1153
00:54:31,159 --> 00:54:34,239
But I fear that for too long,

1154
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:37,639
we've taken them for granted.

1155
00:54:37,639 --> 00:54:40,319
Someone said, I don't know who it was,

1156
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:43,159
that sometimes we don't know

1157
00:54:43,159 --> 00:54:44,439
how much we appreciate something

1158
00:54:44,439 --> 00:54:47,999
until it's taken away.

1159
00:54:47,999 --> 00:54:51,479
It might become a whole lot more difficult

1160
00:54:51,479 --> 00:54:53,519
to be a faithful Christian

1161
00:54:53,519 --> 00:54:57,399
in my lifetime and in your lifetime.

1162
00:54:57,399 --> 00:54:58,599
But can I tell you that that's

1163
00:54:58,599 --> 00:55:00,879
what we've been called to do?

1164
00:55:00,879 --> 00:55:03,399
We know, listen, Jeremiah knew

1165
00:55:03,399 --> 00:55:04,959
the coming judgment.

1166
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:06,839
I don't know when the Lord's going to come,

1167
00:55:06,839 --> 00:55:08,999
and neither do you.

1168
00:55:08,999 --> 00:55:10,679
But we do know that the Bible tells us

1169
00:55:10,679 --> 00:55:12,159
the characteristics of the last days

1170
00:55:12,159 --> 00:55:14,439
as we read in 2 Timothy 3.

1171
00:55:14,439 --> 00:55:15,439
Evil men and seducers,

1172
00:55:15,439 --> 00:55:18,079
they're going to wax worse and worse.

1173
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:19,399
Our society as a whole

1174
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:23,719
is becoming more and more anti-God.

1175
00:55:23,719 --> 00:55:25,519
And by the way, they're not shy

1176
00:55:25,519 --> 00:55:28,279
about being anti-God.

1177
00:55:28,279 --> 00:55:32,039
They're not shy at all.

1178
00:55:32,039 --> 00:55:33,319
Some of the things that I've read

1179
00:55:33,319 --> 00:55:35,599
in recent days and weeks

1180
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:36,919
with regard to some of that

1181
00:55:36,919 --> 00:55:39,439
which we may face as believers,

1182
00:55:39,439 --> 00:55:41,919
I don't know if it's true or not.

1183
00:55:41,919 --> 00:55:43,919
And I would not speculate on the truth of that,

1184
00:55:43,919 --> 00:55:45,279
but what I have to do is I say,

1185
00:55:45,279 --> 00:55:47,479
I've got to spend more time in this book.

1186
00:55:47,479 --> 00:55:49,239
I've got to have my faith increased.

1187
00:55:49,239 --> 00:55:52,799
I've got to be prepared for the battle.

1188
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:55,599
And so do you.

1189
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:57,599
Because our God is in control,

1190
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:00,399
but we're in a battle.

1191
00:56:00,399 --> 00:56:04,879
And we see the wickedness

1192
00:56:04,879 --> 00:56:10,079
that is being proclaimed unashamedly.

1193
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:11,319
And this evening,

1194
00:56:11,319 --> 00:56:14,759
we serve a God that is able.

1195
00:56:14,759 --> 00:56:16,279
And here's the beautiful thing.

1196
00:56:16,359 --> 00:56:19,839
Paul says at the end of 2 Timothy 4,

1197
00:56:19,839 --> 00:56:21,359
my time is well gone this evening,

1198
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:23,399
but at the end of 2 Timothy 4,

1199
00:56:23,399 --> 00:56:24,119
let me read it to you

1200
00:56:24,119 --> 00:56:27,999
because I want to leave you with this.

1201
00:56:27,999 --> 00:56:30,879
It's powerful.

1202
00:56:30,879 --> 00:56:31,919
He'd already said that the time

1203
00:56:31,919 --> 00:56:33,199
of his departure is at hand.

1204
00:56:33,199 --> 00:56:33,999
He's ready to leave.

1205
00:56:33,999 --> 00:56:34,959
He's fought a good fight.

1206
00:56:34,959 --> 00:56:39,319
But notice with me in verse 17.

1207
00:56:39,319 --> 00:56:40,959
It'd be appropriate to read verse 16

1208
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:42,439
along with it.

1209
00:56:42,439 --> 00:56:43,799
In 2 Timothy 4 and verse 16,

1210
00:56:43,799 --> 00:56:45,239
the Bible says that my first answer,

1211
00:56:45,279 --> 00:56:47,319
no man stood with me,

1212
00:56:47,319 --> 00:56:49,679
but all men forsook me.

1213
00:56:49,679 --> 00:56:51,679
I pray God that it be laid to their charge.

1214
00:56:51,679 --> 00:56:54,599
Verse 17, notwithstanding, notice this,

1215
00:56:54,599 --> 00:56:56,919
the Lord stood with me

1216
00:56:56,919 --> 00:56:58,879
and strengthened me,

1217
00:56:58,879 --> 00:57:01,839
that by me the preaching might be fully known

1218
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:05,279
and that all the Gentiles might hear.

1219
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:09,439
And I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.

1220
00:57:09,439 --> 00:57:11,559
It says in verse 18,

1221
00:57:11,559 --> 00:57:13,039
and the Lord shall deliver me

1222
00:57:13,039 --> 00:57:14,799
from every evil work.

1223
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:16,239
Notice this phrase,

1224
00:57:16,239 --> 00:57:18,359
and will preserve me

1225
00:57:18,359 --> 00:57:20,799
unto his heavenly kingdom,

1226
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:25,599
to whom be glory forever and ever.

1227
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:27,119
Amen.

1228
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:31,479
One day, I'm going to die and so are you,

1229
00:57:31,479 --> 00:57:34,799
but I'm going to go to heaven.

1230
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:37,199
And we understand that as Paul says here,

1231
00:57:37,199 --> 00:57:39,319
that the Lord will preserve me

1232
00:57:39,319 --> 00:57:41,199
until that day.

1233
00:57:41,199 --> 00:57:42,879
He was delivered, as he said in verse 17,

1234
00:57:42,879 --> 00:57:46,279
out of the mouth of the lion.

1235
00:57:46,279 --> 00:57:48,399
Many things in which Paul was delivered from,

1236
00:57:48,399 --> 00:57:50,399
as we mentioned in chapter number three,

1237
00:57:50,399 --> 00:57:51,519
that he said that out of them all,

1238
00:57:51,519 --> 00:57:52,999
the Lord delivered me.

1239
00:57:52,999 --> 00:57:55,399
But one day he faced death,

1240
00:57:55,399 --> 00:57:58,159
a martyr's death.

1241
00:57:58,159 --> 00:58:00,239
But we find until that day,

1242
00:58:00,239 --> 00:58:02,559
the Lord preserved him.

1243
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:04,639
And then when that day came,

1244
00:58:04,639 --> 00:58:07,559
he entered into the glory of heaven.

1245
00:58:07,559 --> 00:58:09,359
And he said,

1246
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:12,319
as he's writing to the believers in Philippi,

1247
00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:14,559
it's not easy for me to live as Christ,

1248
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:16,879
but to die as Cain.

1249
00:58:16,879 --> 00:58:18,359
He says, I'm in a straight betwixt two,

1250
00:58:18,359 --> 00:58:20,759
having desired apart to be with Christ,

1251
00:58:20,759 --> 00:58:23,399
which is far better.

1252
00:58:23,399 --> 00:58:24,919
And this evening,

1253
00:58:24,919 --> 00:58:27,559
on a particular day in history,

1254
00:58:27,559 --> 00:58:30,439
Paul faced his last day.

1255
00:58:30,439 --> 00:58:32,799
He faced a martyr's death.

1256
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:34,440
But he understood that until that day,

1257
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:36,239
God was going to deliver him.

1258
00:58:36,239 --> 00:58:37,239
And when that day came,

1259
00:58:37,239 --> 00:58:38,440
listen, there are many martyrs

1260
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:40,039
that have gone before us.

1261
00:58:40,039 --> 00:58:42,199
They were faithful.

1262
00:58:42,199 --> 00:58:43,320
They faced a martyr's death,

1263
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:44,839
but then they entered

1264
00:58:44,839 --> 00:58:47,639
into the presence of our Savior.

1265
00:58:47,639 --> 00:58:48,959
I'm not saying to you this evening

1266
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:50,239
that I want to face a martyr's death

1267
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:51,919
or that we would.

1268
00:58:51,919 --> 00:58:55,440
I'm just asking tonight,

1269
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:58,039
would we be faithful unto death?

1270
00:58:58,039 --> 00:59:00,799
What if it were that we had to

1271
00:59:00,799 --> 00:59:02,559
face some of those things

1272
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:06,119
that people faced years ago?

1273
00:59:06,119 --> 00:59:09,719
Are we prepared?

1274
00:59:09,719 --> 00:59:12,440
What if someone came to you and said,

1275
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:14,399
deny Christ or?

1276
00:59:14,399 --> 00:59:17,479
I don't know what the or is.

1277
00:59:17,479 --> 00:59:19,359
Are we willing to stand?

1278
00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:21,519
Are we willing to continue?

1279
00:59:21,519 --> 00:59:24,119
Are we recognizing that our God is able?

1280
00:59:24,119 --> 00:59:25,359
He's able to take care of us.

1281
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:26,279
But you don't understand,

1282
00:59:26,279 --> 00:59:27,559
I need to have this job.

1283
00:59:27,559 --> 00:59:28,959
I need to have this.

1284
00:59:28,959 --> 00:59:31,599
No, you don't understand that God is able.

1285
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:34,760
I'm saying that in love, I promise.

1286
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:37,519
Our God is able.

1287
00:59:37,519 --> 00:59:39,959
And I believe tonight

1288
00:59:39,959 --> 00:59:41,559
that He wants some of His people

1289
00:59:41,559 --> 00:59:43,239
to stand and say,

1290
00:59:43,239 --> 00:59:45,440
I will follow Thee.

1291
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:49,679
I will be faithful unto death.

1292
00:59:49,679 --> 00:59:52,760
Because I know,

1293
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:54,799
I know that you're able.

1294
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:56,559
And I know that you have a perfect plan

1295
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:57,599
and through your plan,

1296
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:00,359
you will be glorified.

1297
01:00:00,359 --> 01:00:01,359
Jerusalem was taken.

1298
01:00:01,359 --> 01:00:03,799
Jeremiah was there.

1299
01:00:03,799 --> 01:00:07,379
Jeremiah received good care

1300
01:00:07,379 --> 01:00:09,239
because of the compassion of the Lord.

1301
01:00:09,239 --> 01:00:11,519
Father, we love You. We thank You for loving us.

1302
01:00:11,519 --> 01:00:14,679
Thank You for Your Word.

1303
01:00:14,679 --> 01:00:17,879
I hope this evening that

1304
01:00:17,879 --> 01:00:20,179
You've taken Your Word and the truth contained therein

1305
01:00:20,179 --> 01:00:25,839
and You've helped us.

1306
01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:27,939
I know that many have described these days

1307
01:00:27,939 --> 01:00:32,259
as being uncertain.

1308
01:00:32,259 --> 01:00:38,139
And I understand that from man's perspective.

1309
01:00:38,139 --> 01:00:40,779
But God, we understand tonight that You're in control.

1310
01:00:40,779 --> 01:00:43,899
That You have a plan and a purpose.

1311
01:00:43,899 --> 01:00:46,219
We've understood this evening that You've called us

1312
01:00:46,219 --> 01:00:53,339
to continue to be faithful.

1313
01:00:53,339 --> 01:00:59,139
Father, I pray

1314
01:00:59,139 --> 01:01:02,019
that You would encourage each of us

1315
01:01:02,019 --> 01:01:04,379
through the example of Jeremiah,

1316
01:01:04,379 --> 01:01:08,179
through the example of Paul,

1317
01:01:08,179 --> 01:01:13,059
to determine that by Your grace and with Your help,

1318
01:01:13,059 --> 01:01:17,539
we will continue.

1319
01:01:17,539 --> 01:01:22,179
I pray, God, that You would work in hearts and lives.

1320
01:01:22,179 --> 01:01:23,659
Help me.

1321
01:01:23,659 --> 01:01:28,259
Help us to be faithful.

1322
01:01:28,259 --> 01:01:30,019
It's in Christ's name we pray, would You stand with me?
