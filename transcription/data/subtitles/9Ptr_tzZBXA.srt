1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,239
13 this evening and talk about someone that lived for the Lord, that walked with God and

2
00:00:06,239 --> 00:00:11,779
was used of the Lord mightily, Elisha would fit that bill.

3
00:00:11,779 --> 00:00:16,020
And I'm thankful over the past several months we've had the privilege to trace the steps

4
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:24,159
of Elisha and we understand that God has providentially preserved many of the events from Elisha's

5
00:00:24,159 --> 00:00:26,559
life for our learning.

6
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:32,360
And what a blessing to be able to study these passages of Scripture, to be encouraged and

7
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,340
to be challenged through these studies.

8
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:41,439
The reality is as we come to 2 Kings 13, we'll read of the death of Elisha and we understand

9
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:48,360
from Hebrews 9 and verse 27, and as it's appointed unto man once to die, after this the judgment.

10
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:54,080
And with that in mind and thinking about the truth of Psalm 90, that psalm has been ascribed

11
00:00:54,080 --> 00:01:00,919
to Moses and we find that in that passage of Scripture that it's recorded that we spend

12
00:01:00,919 --> 00:01:04,639
our years as a tale that is told.

13
00:01:04,639 --> 00:01:10,160
And therefore, I believe that Moses, obviously it's God's Word, he's the human author, he

14
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:16,400
rightly concludes and reminds us of the importance of numbering our days that we may apply our

15
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,519
hearts unto wisdom.

16
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:23,220
It's always interesting to me to study the final days of someone's life and throughout

17
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:30,019
the Scriptures, God gives us the opportunity to study a number of great patriarchs and

18
00:01:30,019 --> 00:01:35,139
even in the New Testament as we had the opportunity to read of some of the disciples and the apostles

19
00:01:35,139 --> 00:01:40,860
and see what God was doing in and through their lives and read some of those final days

20
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:47,739
and the final message, if you will, of what the Lord had done for them and what they desired

21
00:01:47,739 --> 00:01:51,900
to pass on to the future generation and what have you.

22
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:58,739
Of course, we've seen even in our own history, we've seen the opportunity to have things

23
00:01:58,739 --> 00:02:04,819
recorded of those that were nearing the end of their life and to think about just what

24
00:02:04,819 --> 00:02:05,819
was on their mind.

25
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:10,619
I think about David in particular and the desire that he had to instruct Solomon and

26
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:16,460
to give him counsel and direction with regard to the kingdom, with regard to his own life.

27
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:21,880
Of course, as we would think about our study of Elijah and Elisha, we understand that his

28
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:28,679
death, as we studied there in 2 Kings 2, the translation, if you will, of Elijah and

29
00:02:28,679 --> 00:02:34,279
how Elisha was there and how they journeyed together in all that took place and Elijah

30
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:39,059
continuously said to Elisha, Terry here, and he said, no, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming

31
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:45,059
and he kept following and of course, the Lord brought Elijah to heaven.

32
00:02:45,059 --> 00:02:49,440
Here in 2 Kings 13, we read about Elisha and his death.

33
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,720
It's interesting if we take the passage, begin reading with me in verse number 14,

34
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,720
if you will.

35
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,080
The Bible says this, now, Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness, whereof he died and

36
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:04,279
then you skip down to verse number 20 and you find that the Bible says, and Elisha died

37
00:03:04,279 --> 00:03:05,360
and they buried him.

38
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,320
If you're taking notes this evening, I simply have titled the message tonight, and Elisha

39
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,320
died, and Elisha died.

40
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:19,639
Notice with me that the passage that is before us records for us a final meeting, a final

41
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:21,160
meeting.

42
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:26,679
There's a meeting that is given to us here in verse number 14 and it's a meeting between

43
00:03:26,679 --> 00:03:31,639
Elisha, the prophet of God, and Joash, the king of Israel.

44
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:36,679
In fact, in the previous verses of scripture from verses 10 through 13, there really is

45
00:03:36,679 --> 00:03:43,020
a brief synopsis of the entire reign of Joash and then we see that the Bible then begins

46
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:49,240
to give us some of the details of those things that happened and here in verse number 14,

47
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:54,639
we find that the Bible tells us that Joash, upon hearing of Elisha's sickness, that there

48
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:57,940
was a meeting that took place between these two men.

49
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:03,160
It is interesting for us to be mindful of the fact, even before we read the fullness

50
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:08,000
of verse number 14 and kind of the description of what is given, it's important for us to

51
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,679
note that Joash, just as all of the kings of Israel, were wicked.

52
00:04:12,699 --> 00:04:14,860
He was a wicked man.

53
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:21,260
We find that after the divided kingdom, when you begin to look at Israel's history with

54
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:26,299
the northern kingdom, Israel, the southern Judah, you'll find that within the history

55
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:28,980
of Judah, there were some good kings.

56
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:33,700
There were some kings that they experienced revival under their ministries and we understand

57
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:37,700
as we study some of those things, but as you look through Israel's history and the northern

58
00:04:37,799 --> 00:04:40,799
tribes, there are no good kings.

59
00:04:40,799 --> 00:04:47,200
And the reality is that the Bible tells us in verse number 11 of 2 Kings 13, and he,

60
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:52,040
speaking of Joash, he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord.

61
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:56,959
He departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who made Israel sin, but

62
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,640
he walked therein.

63
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:05,440
And obviously, many of the kings of Israel are given to us with that description of following

64
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:11,179
after the sins of Jeroboam, and we've made note of that on several occasions.

65
00:05:11,179 --> 00:05:17,660
And we find here that Joash, he's a wicked man, he's following after the sins of Jeroboam.

66
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:24,380
However, as we note the greeting that is used here in verse number 14, it reveals to us

67
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:29,619
really the influence that Elisha had during this particular time.

68
00:05:29,619 --> 00:05:34,619
Notice in verse 14, now, Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness, whereof he died.

69
00:05:34,799 --> 00:05:42,239
And Joash, the king of Israel, came down unto him, and wept over his face, and said, O my

70
00:05:42,239 --> 00:05:49,239
father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof.

71
00:05:49,239 --> 00:05:50,720
That's an interesting greeting.

72
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,000
We find that in this particular greeting and the words that are uttered by Joash, it would

73
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,920
be mindful for us to consider the fact that these are the same words that Elisha uttered

74
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,899
at the time of Elijah's translation.

75
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:08,179
If you turn back to 2 Kings chapter number 2, and we will not go through the entirety

76
00:06:08,179 --> 00:06:15,640
of all that took place there in 2 Kings 2, however, we find that there was some discussion

77
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,480
that took place between Elijah and Elisha.

78
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:24,760
And Elijah tells Elisha in verse number 10, Thou hast asked a hard thing, nevertheless,

79
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:30,299
if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee, but if not, it shall

80
00:06:30,299 --> 00:06:31,619
not be so.

81
00:06:31,619 --> 00:06:34,700
This was with regard to the double portion that he requested.

82
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:39,299
In verse number 11, It came to pass, as they still went on and talked, that, behold, there

83
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:45,619
appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder.

84
00:06:45,619 --> 00:06:53,679
It says this, And Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven, and Elisha saw it, and he cried,

85
00:06:53,679 --> 00:07:01,000
My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof.

86
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,820
And he saw them no more.

87
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:06,839
It says that he took hold of his own clothes and rent them in two pieces, and of course

88
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:13,000
we begin the life and ministry of Elisha after Elijah's translation.

89
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,920
It's interesting as we begin to see the way in which Joash would approach and greet Elisha

90
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,799
here in 2 Kings 13.

91
00:07:21,799 --> 00:07:26,239
I mentioned already that it reveals the influence that Elisha had, but I also believe that it

92
00:07:26,239 --> 00:07:34,480
reveals to us that Joash understood not only the position that Elisha had as being a prophet

93
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:41,480
of God, but the way in which God's power had been used and had been evidenced in the life

94
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,799
of Elisha.

95
00:07:42,799 --> 00:07:46,079
Of course, we've studied many of the miracles of Elisha, and you study the miracles, you

96
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:52,720
begin to see how God used Elisha in mighty ways, and no doubt that God is continuing

97
00:07:52,720 --> 00:08:00,380
to give His people Israel a witness and an opportunity to hear the truth of the Word

98
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,399
of God.

99
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:08,040
I think about the time in which Ahab and Jehoshaphat made affinity and they were to go into battle

100
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:14,200
together and Ahab of course had called some false prophets over and Jehoshaphat inquired

101
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:20,040
were there not a prophet of God that we can inquire of, and in that passage of Scripture

102
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:25,160
Ahab reveals that there was one, but his name was Micaiah and he always prophesied that

103
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,640
which was evil with regard to Ahab.

104
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:33,359
It had something to do with the wickedness of Ahab, not with the prophecy of Micaiah.

105
00:08:33,359 --> 00:08:38,919
The reality is that we find that God would use Micaiah to give that voice and to give

106
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:44,200
that truth that was needed, and I'm thankful that God has always, as we look throughout

107
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,520
the history of Israel, we study the entirety of the Old Testament, you find that God always

108
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:53,559
sent prophets, there was a voice, there was truth, and we find that even Jeremiah on the

109
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:58,640
eve of captivity of the Babylonians there of Judah, that he's prophesying and he's giving

110
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,400
the truth.

111
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:07,320
We find here that Joash, though he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam, in this

112
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:14,559
final meeting it is revealed to us the influence that Elisha had and the fact that he, Joash,

113
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:20,640
recognized the position that Elisha held as being a prophet of God.

114
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,559
Notice with me, not only a final meeting, but there's a final message.

115
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:28,200
In verse number 15, the Bible says, "...and Elisha said unto him..."

116
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:33,859
In verses 15 through 19, this final message is revealed to us, and really we could call

117
00:09:33,859 --> 00:09:39,400
it a final prophecy if we'd like, and in this final message we find that really Elisha will

118
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:45,960
use two object lessons and then give a prophecy with regard to those object lessons.

119
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:50,760
In verses 15 through 17, we see the first of these two object lessons, and it has to

120
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,039
do with shooting an arrow.

121
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:58,080
Notice in verse 15, look at what Elisha says to Joash, "...take bow and arrows, and he took

122
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,840
unto him bow and arrows.

123
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,039
And he..."

124
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:02,199
He, Elisha, said to the king of Israel,

125
00:10:02,199 --> 00:10:03,319
that's Joash,

126
00:10:03,319 --> 00:10:06,419
put thine hand upon the bow.

127
00:10:06,419 --> 00:10:08,039
And he put his hand upon it.

128
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:10,279
And Elisha put his hands upon the king's hands

129
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:12,999
and he said, open the window eastward.

130
00:10:12,999 --> 00:10:14,319
And he opened it.

131
00:10:14,319 --> 00:10:16,359
Then Elisha said, shoot.

132
00:10:16,359 --> 00:10:17,639
And he shot.

133
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:21,239
And he said, the arrow of the Lord's deliverance,

134
00:10:21,239 --> 00:10:23,559
the arrow of deliverance from Syria,

135
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:25,999
for thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphac

136
00:10:25,999 --> 00:10:28,239
till thou have consumed them."

137
00:10:28,239 --> 00:10:30,759
Think about this first object lesson

138
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:31,759
of shooting this arrow.

139
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:33,639
And you see how step by step,

140
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:36,119
Elisha took Joash through the process

141
00:10:36,119 --> 00:10:39,039
and Joash takes that bow and he takes those arrows.

142
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:41,039
And the Bible tells us that Elisha

143
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:43,399
then put his hands upon the king's hands.

144
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:46,439
And he told him to open the window and to shoot.

145
00:10:46,439 --> 00:10:47,359
And he shot.

146
00:10:47,359 --> 00:10:50,319
And you find that Elisha then says,

147
00:10:50,319 --> 00:10:53,199
the arrow of the Lord's deliverance,

148
00:10:53,199 --> 00:10:54,919
there in verse number 17.

149
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:57,359
If you look back into our passage of scripture

150
00:10:57,359 --> 00:10:59,239
at the beginning of chapter 13,

151
00:10:59,239 --> 00:11:01,599
you find that the Bible gives us an overview

152
00:11:01,599 --> 00:11:05,319
of the time in which Jehoahaz was king of Israel.

153
00:11:05,319 --> 00:11:06,759
And while he was king of Israel,

154
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:08,399
the Bible tells us in verse number three

155
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,879
that the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel

156
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:14,319
and he delivered them into the hand of Haziel,

157
00:11:14,319 --> 00:11:17,119
king of Syria, in the hand of Ben-Hadad,

158
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:19,679
the son of Haziel, all their days.

159
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,719
And you begin to read through these verses of scripture

160
00:11:21,719 --> 00:11:25,719
and you find how that Syria had been once again

161
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:27,399
oppressing Israel.

162
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:30,119
It tells us at the end of verse number seven

163
00:11:30,119 --> 00:11:32,199
that the king of Syria had destroyed them

164
00:11:32,199 --> 00:11:35,719
and had made them like the dust by threshing.

165
00:11:35,719 --> 00:11:39,879
And so now we find that Elisha is now speaking to Joash.

166
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:42,399
And Joash is the king after Jehoahaz.

167
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,839
And we find there's still these problems with Syria

168
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:46,319
and all these things are going on.

169
00:11:46,319 --> 00:11:48,559
And Elisha gives him an object lesson.

170
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:49,919
And within that object lesson,

171
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:51,439
he reminds him of the prophecy.

172
00:11:51,439 --> 00:11:53,959
The first mention there in verse number 17,

173
00:11:53,959 --> 00:11:55,119
the deliverance from Syria.

174
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,359
And you notice he says,

175
00:11:56,359 --> 00:12:00,119
the arrow of the Lord's deliverance.

176
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:00,959
And then he says,

177
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,439
and the arrow of deliverance from Syria.

178
00:12:04,439 --> 00:12:06,079
Once again, as we've made note

179
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,039
throughout the life of Elisha,

180
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:10,759
many of his prophecies are very specific.

181
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:14,639
And that's because God is a very specific God

182
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,159
and he's omniscient, he knows all things.

183
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:20,359
And Elisha is his servant, his prophet,

184
00:12:20,359 --> 00:12:22,439
and he's speaking the word of the Lord.

185
00:12:22,439 --> 00:12:24,879
We find that the second of these object lessons

186
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:26,639
is found in verses 18 and 19

187
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,279
and it has to do with smiting the arrows.

188
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,959
It says this in verse number 18,

189
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:35,119
and he said, again, Elisha speaking to Joash,

190
00:12:35,119 --> 00:12:37,839
take the arrows and he took them.

191
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,199
And he said unto the king of Israel,

192
00:12:39,199 --> 00:12:41,799
smite upon the ground.

193
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:45,399
And he smote thrice and stayed.

194
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:47,759
And it's interesting response in verse number 19,

195
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:51,999
the Bible says, and the man of God was wroth with him

196
00:12:51,999 --> 00:12:56,999
and said, thou shouldest have smitten five or six times,

197
00:12:57,359 --> 00:13:02,239
then hast thou smitten Syria till thou hast consumed it.

198
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:07,239
Whereas now thou shalt smite Syria but thrice.

199
00:13:08,119 --> 00:13:11,119
So we find in the second object lesson

200
00:13:11,119 --> 00:13:13,159
that Elisha now says, take those arrows

201
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:15,919
and he tells them to smite the ground.

202
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:18,279
He tells them to smite upon the ground

203
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:20,639
and he smote thrice and stayed.

204
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,839
And we find that Elisha is angry with them

205
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:25,559
and he says, you should have smitten five or six times

206
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:28,599
and because you only did it three times,

207
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,879
your deliverance and your victory,

208
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:32,439
it should be but thrice,

209
00:13:32,439 --> 00:13:34,759
according to the end of verse number 19.

210
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:37,799
Again, we find that in this passage,

211
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:40,279
that Elisha in the final message

212
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:42,519
that he would use these object lessons

213
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:45,359
for the purpose of giving this prophecy

214
00:13:45,359 --> 00:13:47,079
of deliverance from Syria,

215
00:13:47,079 --> 00:13:49,359
but that it would be only thrice,

216
00:13:49,359 --> 00:13:51,719
three times that they would smite Syria.

217
00:13:51,719 --> 00:13:53,839
You notice here in verse number 19,

218
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,879
the final message is given.

219
00:13:55,879 --> 00:13:56,959
Skip over if you will,

220
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,959
we'll look at verses 20 and 21 here in just a moment,

221
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,239
but look at verses 22 through 25,

222
00:14:01,239 --> 00:14:04,679
where we see the fulfillment of this prophecy.

223
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:07,039
The Bible says, but Haziel, king of Syria,

224
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:10,239
oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz.

225
00:14:10,239 --> 00:14:12,479
We mentioned that in the beginning of chapter 13.

226
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,319
It says, and the Lord was gracious unto them

227
00:14:14,319 --> 00:14:17,039
and had compassion on them and had respect unto them

228
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:19,759
because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob

229
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:21,319
and would not destroy them,

230
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:26,159
neither cast he them from his presence as yet.

231
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:29,639
It's interesting, two final words to verse number 23,

232
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:33,319
for we know that eventually the nation of Israel

233
00:14:33,319 --> 00:14:36,879
would be taken captive by the Assyrians

234
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:41,279
and that is recorded for us later on in their history.

235
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,759
But at this particular time,

236
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:45,399
we find that the Lord continued to show grace

237
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:47,999
and mercy, compassion to his people.

238
00:14:47,999 --> 00:14:51,079
In verse 24, so Haziel, king of Syria, died

239
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:54,839
and Ben-Hadad, his son, reigned in his stead and Jehoash.

240
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:57,799
Now that's Joash that we've been speaking of.

241
00:14:57,799 --> 00:14:58,999
It's interesting if you study

242
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:01,959
through all of the history of what's going on,

243
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:04,519
there's actually a Joash that's king of Judah.

244
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:05,759
And so there's a distinction

245
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:07,359
that is given at this particular time

246
00:15:07,359 --> 00:15:11,479
in using the phraseology Jehoash as opposed to Joash

247
00:15:11,479 --> 00:15:14,279
because there was a Joash that was king of Judah.

248
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:16,159
And here the distinction being known

249
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:18,919
that it is speaking of the king of Israel.

250
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:22,599
In verse number 14, the distinction was not in name,

251
00:15:22,599 --> 00:15:25,079
but it said, and Joash, the king of Israel,

252
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:27,439
so that we could make sure that we're having

253
00:15:27,439 --> 00:15:29,479
the proper knowledge of who is being spoken of.

254
00:15:29,479 --> 00:15:32,319
Notice in verse 25, that he took again

255
00:15:32,319 --> 00:15:35,599
out of the hand of Ben-Hadad, the son of Haziel, the cities,

256
00:15:35,599 --> 00:15:37,759
which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz,

257
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:38,879
his father by war.

258
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:43,879
Notice what it says, three times did Joash beat him

259
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:47,839
and recovered the cities of Israel.

260
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,119
It's exactly what Elisha had prophesied

261
00:15:51,119 --> 00:15:55,639
in verses 17 through 19 with regard to this final message

262
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:58,399
that they would have, it was the Lord's deliverance,

263
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,039
it was the arrow of the Lord's deliverance,

264
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:02,439
and that they would have deliverance from Syria

265
00:16:02,439 --> 00:16:06,119
and that he should smite Syria but thrice.

266
00:16:06,119 --> 00:16:09,759
And that's exactly what happens in the fulfilled prophecy.

267
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,679
So we see a final meeting, a final message,

268
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,279
notice a final miracle.

269
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,439
It's interesting if you look at verses 20 and 21,

270
00:16:15,439 --> 00:16:17,679
the Bible tells us in verse number 20

271
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:20,279
that Elisha, he died and was buried.

272
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:23,279
It tells us that there's something that's taking place

273
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,119
at the same time, Elisha died, notice in verse 20,

274
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:28,959
and they buried him, and the bands of the Moabites

275
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,719
invaded the land at the coming in of the year,

276
00:16:31,719 --> 00:16:35,079
and it came to pass as they were burying a man.

277
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:37,199
So there's this man, he's not named for us here

278
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:41,119
in the passage of scripture, but he dies in battle.

279
00:16:41,119 --> 00:16:45,639
The Bible tells us that they spied a band of men,

280
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:50,639
and so they cast this man into the sepulcher of Elisha.

281
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,639
And it's interesting because the Bible tells us

282
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,119
at the end of verse number 21,

283
00:16:54,119 --> 00:16:56,679
and I've called it a final miracle, of course,

284
00:16:56,679 --> 00:17:00,679
God was in this and allowing this to happen

285
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:04,119
and giving to really the Joash

286
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:06,439
and the nation of Israel at this time

287
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:09,079
the fact that the prophecy would come to pass

288
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:11,679
as we've just read in verses 22 through 25.

289
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,679
And the Bible ends in verse number 21 and says,

290
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,159
and when the man was let down

291
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:20,319
and touched the bones of Elisha,

292
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:24,999
he revived and stood up on his feet.

293
00:17:24,999 --> 00:17:26,519
That's kind of interesting, isn't it?

294
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:28,839
That's not what you would expect, right?

295
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:33,079
You're casting this guy in, you see this band of soldiers,

296
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:35,279
the Bible tells us that this one was,

297
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:38,279
they were gonna bury this guy, they spied a band of men,

298
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:42,799
and so they cast him into the sepulcher of Elisha.

299
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:47,079
And when that man touches the bones of Elisha, he revives.

300
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:48,799
And he stands up and he's gonna get out.

301
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,319
That's amazing, right?

302
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,439
Not what you would expect, not what's going on.

303
00:17:52,439 --> 00:17:56,279
And we see really, again, a final miracle.

304
00:17:56,279 --> 00:17:58,359
Elisha, of course, his ministry was known

305
00:17:58,359 --> 00:18:00,039
for many miracles that took place.

306
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:02,039
We've studied through those miracles.

307
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,959
We've seen the power of God and the hand of God,

308
00:18:04,999 --> 00:18:08,479
and we've seen how God was helping his people

309
00:18:08,479 --> 00:18:10,679
understand the power that he had.

310
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:13,919
And we find here, even after the death of Elisha,

311
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:17,599
that God would allow this miraculous reviving

312
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:21,399
of this individual as he was cast into the sepulcher

313
00:18:21,399 --> 00:18:26,399
of Elisha to come to be revived and to stand upon his feet.

314
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:28,799
Now, as we think about this passage of Scripture,

315
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,999
we see a final meeting, a final message,

316
00:18:30,999 --> 00:18:32,440
and a final miracle.

317
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,919
I want you to think about the life of Elisha.

318
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:37,199
And I want you to think, as we've studied now

319
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:40,719
for so many weeks, and we understand that Elisha,

320
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:44,959
he ministered faithfully and courageously.

321
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:48,599
I want you to understand that Elisha served the Lord

322
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:51,639
during a time of great wickedness.

323
00:18:51,639 --> 00:18:55,039
We think about the condition of Israel as a nation,

324
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,959
and we think about the way in which he was serving.

325
00:18:57,959 --> 00:19:00,839
And, of course, Elijah served during a time

326
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,679
of great wickedness in the nation of Israel,

327
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,440
Ahab as being the king, married to Jezebel,

328
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,719
and all of the wickedness.

329
00:19:07,719 --> 00:19:10,519
And we made mention of several of those things.

330
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:13,039
But we find that when Elisha begins to reign,

331
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:17,519
or when he begins to serve, that Jehoram is the king,

332
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:20,279
as we find in the passage of Scripture

333
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:23,039
right after the translation of Elijah,

334
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:27,199
King Jehoram and King Jehu, King Jehoahaz,

335
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:28,679
and then King Joash.

336
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:32,159
Now, we're not sure exactly of how many years

337
00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:36,199
of Joash's reign that Elisha was ministering,

338
00:19:36,199 --> 00:19:39,639
but if you take the first three kings of Israel

339
00:19:39,639 --> 00:19:43,519
under whom Elisha was serving and ministering,

340
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:46,799
their three reigns total 57 years.

341
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:51,239
So Elisha ministered for nearly 60 years,

342
00:19:51,239 --> 00:19:54,839
and he ministered faithfully and courageously.

343
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:57,239
And we begin to read, as we've studied

344
00:19:57,239 --> 00:20:00,079
throughout these passages of Scripture.

345
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:04,119
begin to see how that he dealt with all sorts of things

346
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:07,319
and looking at the wickedness of Israel and their idolatry

347
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:09,439
and all of those things that are going on,

348
00:20:09,439 --> 00:20:14,559
and yet you see a man that faithfully and courageously served God.

349
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,679
A man who stood for the Lord.

350
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:22,599
A man who stood upon the truth and prophesied faithfully.

351
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:26,439
As I study the life of Elisha and as we conclude this evening,

352
00:20:26,439 --> 00:20:30,759
I believe that we ought to be not only encouraged by the life

353
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:35,519
and ministry of Elisha, but I believe we should be challenged.

354
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:39,239
I believe that as we study through the lives of those

355
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:41,639
that are recorded for us within the Word of God,

356
00:20:41,639 --> 00:20:44,279
but even those contemporaries that have gone before us

357
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:46,879
begin to think about their lives and their faithfulness

358
00:20:46,879 --> 00:20:50,119
and we begin to, yes, be encouraged by that,

359
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:53,239
but we ought to be challenged.

360
00:20:53,239 --> 00:20:56,839
I believe there are times in which we are tempted to think about

361
00:20:56,839 --> 00:21:01,199
the difficulties in which we have to serve.

362
00:21:01,199 --> 00:21:05,359
We begin to think about the landscape of the things that are going on

363
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:07,279
in our society, in our culture,

364
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:09,479
and we begin to think about the wickedness and say,

365
00:21:09,479 --> 00:21:14,279
man, it's so bad, it's so terrible, and it's so challenging.

366
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:17,199
Listen, there are many people that have gone before us

367
00:21:17,199 --> 00:21:20,599
that have served God faithfully and courageously

368
00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:23,479
in times of great wickedness,

369
00:21:23,479 --> 00:21:27,879
that dealt with great levels of adversity and oppression.

370
00:21:27,879 --> 00:21:33,239
We think about the way in which Elisha would stand and he would serve,

371
00:21:33,239 --> 00:21:38,719
and I say, oh, that God would enable us to have that same level of courage,

372
00:21:38,719 --> 00:21:44,799
that God would enable us to have that same level of faithfulness to serve Him.

373
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:48,399
As I think about the life of Elisha and it comes to its end here

374
00:21:48,399 --> 00:21:55,079
in 2 Kings 13, and we say it's a life that was used by God,

375
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:57,319
that he was a man that was surrendered to the Lord

376
00:21:57,319 --> 00:21:59,479
and to the work that God had for him,

377
00:21:59,479 --> 00:22:02,879
and I say, oh, that we too would be in that same position,

378
00:22:02,879 --> 00:22:06,519
that we would allow God to work in and through us.

379
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:08,719
We sang tonight about channels only,

380
00:22:08,719 --> 00:22:14,359
how appropriate to think about how Elisha was used of God as a channel,

381
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:18,679
and God used him, and God was glorified through his life,

382
00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:20,719
and I think about our lives today,

383
00:22:20,719 --> 00:22:23,959
and I'm mindful of two passages in the New Testament.

384
00:22:23,959 --> 00:22:26,199
Quickly going to make reference to them.

385
00:22:26,199 --> 00:22:30,799
Turn to the book of Ephesians, if you will, and chapter number 6.

386
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,159
I'm going to make reference here,

387
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,319
and then we'll make reference in 2 Timothy chapter number 3,

388
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:39,239
and then be done this evening and have our time of prayer.

389
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:42,039
But I want you to consider with me

390
00:22:42,039 --> 00:22:48,839
these many years of faithful ministry of Elisha,

391
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:53,719
and ask the Lord to help us to have the strength and courage

392
00:22:53,719 --> 00:22:57,479
to stand in days of adversity and great wickedness.

393
00:22:57,479 --> 00:23:00,759
The Bible says in Ephesians 6 and beginning in verse number 10,

394
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:05,319
Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and the power of His might.

395
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:07,759
Put on the whole armor of God,

396
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:13,119
that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.

397
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:15,519
For we wrestle not against flesh and blood,

398
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,439
but against principalities, against powers,

399
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:20,199
against the rulers of the darkness of this world,

400
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:23,199
against spiritual wickedness in high places.

401
00:23:23,199 --> 00:23:26,079
We are engaged in spiritual warfare, amen?

402
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:27,359
We see it all around us.

403
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:30,439
I mentioned to a couple of folks that I spoke to on the phone today,

404
00:23:30,439 --> 00:23:32,919
with just a little bit of spiritual discernment,

405
00:23:32,919 --> 00:23:35,079
you can easily acknowledge today

406
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:38,239
that we're living in great spiritual warfare.

407
00:23:38,239 --> 00:23:40,279
The Bible continues in verse number 13,

408
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:43,999
Wherefore, take unto you the whole armor of God,

409
00:23:43,999 --> 00:23:49,199
notice that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day,

410
00:23:49,199 --> 00:23:52,799
and having done all, to stand.

411
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:57,039
Stand therefore, having your loins girded out with truth,

412
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:59,359
and having on the breastplate of righteousness,

413
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:02,119
and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace,

414
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:04,439
above all, taking the shield of faith,

415
00:24:04,439 --> 00:24:08,599
wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked,

416
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:11,199
and take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit,

417
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:14,399
which is the Word of God.

418
00:24:14,399 --> 00:24:18,679
You notice on a number of occasions in these few verses of Scripture in Ephesians 6

419
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:21,199
that the word stand or withstand is used,

420
00:24:21,199 --> 00:24:23,559
and the importance of standing.

421
00:24:23,559 --> 00:24:25,319
I'm thankful as we've studied,

422
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:28,799
and really we began the study of the life of Elijah and Elisha

423
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,599
back in August of last year,

424
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:33,679
and we've studied through their lives on Wednesday evenings,

425
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:37,839
and we've had the opportunity to study the lives of these two great prophets,

426
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:41,959
and to see individuals that stood for the Lord,

427
00:24:41,959 --> 00:24:44,279
that took that stand.

428
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:46,359
And as New Testament believers,

429
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:49,519
we have this instruction in Ephesians 6

430
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:52,799
with regard to the spiritual warfare that we're engaged in,

431
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,599
and that we're to be strong in the Lord, and the power of His might,

432
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:57,719
to put on the whole armor of God.

433
00:24:57,719 --> 00:25:01,039
Why? So that we can stand in this evil day,

434
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:04,759
so that we can withstand in this evil day,

435
00:25:04,759 --> 00:25:12,399
and we understand that we have been given this responsibility to stand for truth.

436
00:25:12,399 --> 00:25:14,199
You look in our society today,

437
00:25:14,199 --> 00:25:18,919
and you see people all over the place that are folding.

438
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:20,599
They're not standing.

439
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:22,159
Amen?

440
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:23,119
You see it.

441
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:26,399
And I'm not saying that you have to be ugly about standing,

442
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:28,319
but you need to stand.

443
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:29,199
Amen?

444
00:25:29,199 --> 00:25:32,279
Truth is truth.

445
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:33,079
Amen?

446
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:36,799
In Romans, Paul asks the question as he's speaking there about the Jews,

447
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:38,399
you know, what can we do against the truth?

448
00:25:38,399 --> 00:25:40,679
You can't do anything against the truth.

449
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:42,519
Only for the truth.

450
00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:45,199
And the reality is that Jesus is the truth,

451
00:25:45,199 --> 00:25:48,399
and He's given us His Word which is truth.

452
00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:50,519
Oh, that we'd stand on it.

453
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:54,719
We don't have to cave in to the pressures of our society.

454
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:58,519
We don't need to be in a position where we feel like we have to be

455
00:25:58,519 --> 00:26:01,719
quote-unquote politically correct.

456
00:26:01,719 --> 00:26:06,119
I'd much rather be biblically correct than politically correct.

457
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:07,679
Amen?

458
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:16,479
I mean, to think about the fact that we would try to cater to the demands of a culture

459
00:26:16,479 --> 00:26:23,039
that we're living in, and at the very same time, not please our Savior.

460
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,119
See, sometimes we don't think about it that way.

461
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:28,799
I'd much rather please my Savior.

462
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:29,479
Amen?

463
00:26:29,479 --> 00:26:32,679
I'm going to stand before Him, by the way, and so are you.

464
00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:37,159
I'd much rather please Him than cave in to the pressures of this world.

465
00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:41,279
I'm thankful that Elijah and Elisha, they didn't cave in.

466
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,439
They stood boldly.

467
00:26:43,439 --> 00:26:46,119
They stood courageously.

468
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:47,559
Oh, that we would stand.

469
00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:51,479
Not only that we would stand even as we've studied so many of these lessons

470
00:26:51,479 --> 00:26:53,879
through the lives of these two prophets,

471
00:26:53,879 --> 00:26:57,119
but I think of this truth in 2 Timothy chapter number 3.

472
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:01,599
Not only that the New Testament principle of standing according to Ephesians 6,

473
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:05,799
but this word in 2 Timothy 3, continue.

474
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:07,519
Continue.

475
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:10,399
It's not a time to wave the white flag of surrender.

476
00:27:10,399 --> 00:27:12,039
It's not a time to give up.

477
00:27:12,039 --> 00:27:13,399
It's not a time to retreat.

478
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:16,679
It's not a time to, no, it's a time to continue.

479
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:18,079
Amen?

480
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:20,279
We find that in 2 Timothy chapter number 3,

481
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:23,719
we don't have the time this evening to read the entirety of the passage,

482
00:27:23,719 --> 00:27:27,439
so if you'd let me just read a few of these verses

483
00:27:27,439 --> 00:27:29,559
and give you kind of the overview.

484
00:27:29,559 --> 00:27:31,919
Paul begins it this way in verse number 1.

485
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,479
This know also.

486
00:27:35,479 --> 00:27:39,959
You find often throughout the Word of God that our God wants us to be informed.

487
00:27:39,959 --> 00:27:41,879
He doesn't want us to be ignorant.

488
00:27:41,879 --> 00:27:44,559
In fact, many times in the writings of Paul,

489
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:45,959
he'll use that phraseology,

490
00:27:45,959 --> 00:27:48,519
I would not that you be ignorant, brethren.

491
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:51,679
There are some, according to 2 Peter chapter number 3,

492
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:54,519
that were willfully ignorant.

493
00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:55,639
Amen?

494
00:27:55,639 --> 00:27:57,639
They were willingly ignorant of these things.

495
00:27:57,639 --> 00:27:59,199
Oh, I trust that we'd be informed.

496
00:27:59,199 --> 00:28:02,999
I remember what one evangelist said that was here many years ago,

497
00:28:02,999 --> 00:28:04,279
Brother Caldwell.

498
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:05,479
He said this, he said,

499
00:28:05,479 --> 00:28:09,959
the thing that bothers me the most is not somebody that doesn't know the truth,

500
00:28:09,959 --> 00:28:14,359
it's somebody that doesn't want to know the truth.

501
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,199
That's sad.

502
00:28:16,239 --> 00:28:20,799
Paul says, know this, be informed of this,

503
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:26,439
that in the last days perilous times shall come.

504
00:28:26,439 --> 00:28:28,359
For men shall be lovers of their own selves,

505
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:30,439
covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers,

506
00:28:30,439 --> 00:28:32,959
disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,

507
00:28:32,959 --> 00:28:34,879
without natural affection, truce breakers,

508
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:36,919
false accusers, incontinent, fierce,

509
00:28:36,919 --> 00:28:38,359
despisers of those that are good,

510
00:28:38,359 --> 00:28:39,759
traitors, heady, high-minded,

511
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:41,999
lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God,

512
00:28:41,999 --> 00:28:44,159
having a form of godliness,

513
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:48,039
but denying the power thereof from such turn away.

514
00:28:48,039 --> 00:28:48,879
What a list.

515
00:28:48,879 --> 00:28:52,479
We don't have time to go through all of these points this evening,

516
00:28:52,479 --> 00:28:54,799
but Paul's letting Timothy know,

517
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,039
here's the description,

518
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:58,799
here are the characteristics of these last days.

519
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,559
Skip down to verse number 12.

520
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:06,159
Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.

521
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:09,399
You say, I wish it wasn't there, but it is.

522
00:29:09,399 --> 00:29:11,799
Paul's letting Timothy know.

523
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:15,559
You don't live for God.

524
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:16,399
Persecution's gonna come.

525
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:17,599
What did Jesus say?

526
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:21,319
If they've hated me, they're gonna hate you.

527
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:25,679
Peter will later say, don't think it strange about this fiery trial.

528
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:26,719
Right?

529
00:29:26,719 --> 00:29:28,279
And here he says this,

530
00:29:28,279 --> 00:29:30,519
but evil men and seducers, verse 13,

531
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:33,479
shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.

532
00:29:33,479 --> 00:29:36,439
Now, after Paul gives all of that information,

533
00:29:36,439 --> 00:29:38,279
after Paul lets Timothy know,

534
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:40,279
here's how it's gonna be characterized,

535
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:41,359
here's what you're gonna deal with,

536
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:44,319
there's gonna be persecution if you live godly in Christ Jesus.

537
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:45,879
These men are gonna wax worse and worse,

538
00:29:45,879 --> 00:29:47,079
they're not gonna get better and better,

539
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:48,519
that's what you're gonna deal with.

540
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:52,599
And then, how would Paul then tell Timothy what to do with this?

541
00:29:52,599 --> 00:29:55,639
But, continue.

542
00:29:55,639 --> 00:29:57,759
Continue.

543
00:29:57,759 --> 00:29:59,159
You know all of this stuff,

544
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:00,159
but it's not that you...

545
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:04,239
retreat. It's not that you go hide. It's not that you give up. It's not that you

546
00:30:04,239 --> 00:30:09,119
know you continue. Continue in what? Continue thou in the things which thou

547
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:12,759
hast learned and has been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them.

548
00:30:12,759 --> 00:30:20,159
To make sure that it was clear for us, I'm believing that that Timothy had an

549
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:24,639
understanding of what Paul would be referring to. And we find that the

550
00:30:24,639 --> 00:30:30,279
continuation goes that from a child thou has known the Holy Scriptures, which

551
00:30:30,279 --> 00:30:33,679
are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in

552
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:38,199
Christ Jesus. All scripture is given by inspiration of God. It's profitable for

553
00:30:38,199 --> 00:30:41,599
doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the

554
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:45,519
man of God might be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works. And then

555
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:49,079
he tells them, preach the word in verse number two of chapter number four.

556
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:56,319
Continue, Timothy. So when I think about Elijah and Elisha, this this is our 34th

557
00:30:56,319 --> 00:31:02,999
lesson that we studied these prophets of God. We've seen so many wonderful things.

558
00:31:02,999 --> 00:31:10,279
But if we could finish our study of these prophets, Elisha in particular, over

559
00:31:10,279 --> 00:31:16,559
the last 17 or so of these lessons, that we'd understand that they they stood.

560
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:24,639
They stood. They didn't serve in a time in which the kings were promoting

561
00:31:24,639 --> 00:31:30,919
righteousness and cleaning out the false idols. They didn't serve in times of

562
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:38,519
where we see some that had served. They served in times of great wickedness. Yet

563
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:43,679
they stood. And they continued. They were faithful. One thing that I like about

564
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:48,839
both of these prophets is they were faithful unto the end. Faithful unto the

565
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:54,959
end. You know, God has called us to live a life of faithfulness until the end. But

566
00:31:54,959 --> 00:31:59,839
we talk much about wanting to finish well. In this same book, in 2nd Timothy,

567
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:03,079
you get into chapter 4 and you begin to see how Paul mentions about

568
00:32:03,079 --> 00:32:10,239
finishing, and how he had finished his race. It didn't happen by accident. All

569
00:32:10,239 --> 00:32:13,679
the way back in Acts chapter number 20, when Paul is speaking to the Ephesian

570
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:21,159
elders, he makes this statement that, I might finish my course with joy. You have

571
00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:27,079
to purpose to finish. If you're gonna stand, if you're gonna continue, oh, you

572
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:31,279
need to to follow the admonition of God in his word, that we put on the whole

573
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:35,479
armor of God and understand that we're to be strong in the Lord, the power

574
00:32:35,479 --> 00:32:39,159
of his might, so on and so forth, that we follow the truth of the Word of God. But

575
00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:44,959
there are so many pressures in our society today. But don't think for a

576
00:32:44,959 --> 00:32:49,239
moment that those that have gone before us, that faithfully and courageously

577
00:32:49,239 --> 00:32:55,399
served God, did not face similar pressures. The pressures are nothing new.

578
00:32:55,399 --> 00:33:02,119
The opposition, the work of God, has always been. But throughout history, you

579
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:08,759
get the privilege of reading about some some folks that stood and continued, even

580
00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:13,519
in the face of adversity. And I'm thankful that Elijah and Elisha are two

581
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:20,399
such prophets that stood and continued, and they serve faithfully unto the end.

582
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:25,079
Oh, that God would not only encourage us through the study of these two great

583
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:30,279
prophets, but challenge us that we would live in like manner. That we just

584
00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:35,079
determine, you know what? I want to be biblically correct. I want to stand, and I

585
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:39,399
want to continue. I want to be found faithful. Well done, thou good and

586
00:33:39,399 --> 00:33:43,399
faithful servant. Amen. Let's pray. Father, we love you. We thank you for loving us.

587
00:33:43,399 --> 00:33:48,799
Thank you for the lives of these two prophets of Israel. We thank you for the

588
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:53,039
privilege over so many months to now study their lives, and to trace their

589
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:58,079
steps, and to see, God, what it was that you were able to accomplish through them.

590
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:04,279
Lord, we know the times of great wickedness in which they served, and how

591
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:09,199
grateful we are that they stood, and they continued, and they were faithful unto

592
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:14,599
the end. Father, we understand that you've given us now a responsibility. This is

593
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:21,839
our time to serve you, to live for you. Before the service this evening, the

594
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:28,639
instrumentalists were playing, Living for Jesus. Oh, Father, I pray that you'd

595
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:37,519
help us to live for you. Lord, help us to stand. Help us, Lord, to continue. Help us

596
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:43,359
to not cave to the pressures of our society or our culture. Help us to live

597
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:48,239
for you, and to make a difference. I pray, God, that you would use us as channels.

598
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:55,959
Lord, that we would be clean vessels, fit for the Master's use. That, God, you alone

599
00:34:55,999 --> 00:34:59,439
would be honored and glorified through our lives. Well, thank you for the work

600
00:34:59,439 --> 00:35:04,519
that you'll do. For it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
