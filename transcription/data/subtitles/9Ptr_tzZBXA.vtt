00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.239
13 this evening and talk about someone that lived for the Lord, that walked with God and

00:00:06.239 --> 00:00:11.779
was used of the Lord mightily, Elisha would fit that bill.

00:00:11.779 --> 00:00:16.020
And I'm thankful over the past several months we've had the privilege to trace the steps

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:24.159
of Elisha and we understand that God has providentially preserved many of the events from Elisha's

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:26.559
life for our learning.

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:32.360
And what a blessing to be able to study these passages of Scripture, to be encouraged and

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.340
to be challenged through these studies.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.439
The reality is as we come to 2 Kings 13, we'll read of the death of Elisha and we understand

00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:48.360
from Hebrews 9 and verse 27, and as it's appointed unto man once to die, after this the judgment.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.080
And with that in mind and thinking about the truth of Psalm 90, that psalm has been ascribed

00:00:54.080 --> 00:01:00.919
to Moses and we find that in that passage of Scripture that it's recorded that we spend

00:01:00.919 --> 00:01:04.639
our years as a tale that is told.

00:01:04.639 --> 00:01:10.160
And therefore, I believe that Moses, obviously it's God's Word, he's the human author, he

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:16.400
rightly concludes and reminds us of the importance of numbering our days that we may apply our

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.519
hearts unto wisdom.

00:01:18.519 --> 00:01:23.220
It's always interesting to me to study the final days of someone's life and throughout

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:30.019
the Scriptures, God gives us the opportunity to study a number of great patriarchs and

00:01:30.019 --> 00:01:35.139
even in the New Testament as we had the opportunity to read of some of the disciples and the apostles

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:40.860
and see what God was doing in and through their lives and read some of those final days

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:47.739
and the final message, if you will, of what the Lord had done for them and what they desired

00:01:47.739 --> 00:01:51.900
to pass on to the future generation and what have you.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:58.739
Of course, we've seen even in our own history, we've seen the opportunity to have things

00:01:58.739 --> 00:02:04.819
recorded of those that were nearing the end of their life and to think about just what

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:05.819
was on their mind.

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:10.619
I think about David in particular and the desire that he had to instruct Solomon and

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.460
to give him counsel and direction with regard to the kingdom, with regard to his own life.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:21.880
Of course, as we would think about our study of Elijah and Elisha, we understand that his

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:28.679
death, as we studied there in 2 Kings 2, the translation, if you will, of Elijah and

00:02:28.679 --> 00:02:34.279
how Elisha was there and how they journeyed together in all that took place and Elijah

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:39.059
continuously said to Elisha, Terry here, and he said, no, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:45.059
and he kept following and of course, the Lord brought Elijah to heaven.

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:49.440
Here in 2 Kings 13, we read about Elisha and his death.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.720
It's interesting if we take the passage, begin reading with me in verse number 14,

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:54.720
if you will.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.080
The Bible says this, now, Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness, whereof he died and

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.279
then you skip down to verse number 20 and you find that the Bible says, and Elisha died

00:03:04.279 --> 00:03:05.360
and they buried him.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.320
If you're taking notes this evening, I simply have titled the message tonight, and Elisha

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.320
died, and Elisha died.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:19.639
Notice with me that the passage that is before us records for us a final meeting, a final

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:21.160
meeting.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.679
There's a meeting that is given to us here in verse number 14 and it's a meeting between

00:03:26.679 --> 00:03:31.639
Elisha, the prophet of God, and Joash, the king of Israel.

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:36.679
In fact, in the previous verses of scripture from verses 10 through 13, there really is

00:03:36.679 --> 00:03:43.020
a brief synopsis of the entire reign of Joash and then we see that the Bible then begins

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:49.240
to give us some of the details of those things that happened and here in verse number 14,

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:54.639
we find that the Bible tells us that Joash, upon hearing of Elisha's sickness, that there

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:57.940
was a meeting that took place between these two men.

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.160
It is interesting for us to be mindful of the fact, even before we read the fullness

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.000
of verse number 14 and kind of the description of what is given, it's important for us to

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.679
note that Joash, just as all of the kings of Israel, were wicked.

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:14.860
He was a wicked man.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:21.260
We find that after the divided kingdom, when you begin to look at Israel's history with

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.299
the northern kingdom, Israel, the southern Judah, you'll find that within the history

00:04:26.299 --> 00:04:28.980
of Judah, there were some good kings.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.700
There were some kings that they experienced revival under their ministries and we understand

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.700
as we study some of those things, but as you look through Israel's history and the northern

00:04:37.799 --> 00:04:40.799
tribes, there are no good kings.

00:04:40.799 --> 00:04:47.200
And the reality is that the Bible tells us in verse number 11 of 2 Kings 13, and he,

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:52.040
speaking of Joash, he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.959
He departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who made Israel sin, but

00:04:56.959 --> 00:04:59.640
he walked therein.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:05.440
And obviously, many of the kings of Israel are given to us with that description of following

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:11.179
after the sins of Jeroboam, and we've made note of that on several occasions.

00:05:11.179 --> 00:05:17.660
And we find here that Joash, he's a wicked man, he's following after the sins of Jeroboam.

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:24.380
However, as we note the greeting that is used here in verse number 14, it reveals to us

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:29.619
really the influence that Elisha had during this particular time.

00:05:29.619 --> 00:05:34.619
Notice in verse 14, now, Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness, whereof he died.

00:05:34.799 --> 00:05:42.239
And Joash, the king of Israel, came down unto him, and wept over his face, and said, O my

00:05:42.239 --> 00:05:49.239
father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof.

00:05:49.239 --> 00:05:50.720
That's an interesting greeting.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.000
We find that in this particular greeting and the words that are uttered by Joash, it would

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.920
be mindful for us to consider the fact that these are the same words that Elisha uttered

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.899
at the time of Elijah's translation.

00:06:03.899 --> 00:06:08.179
If you turn back to 2 Kings chapter number 2, and we will not go through the entirety

00:06:08.179 --> 00:06:15.640
of all that took place there in 2 Kings 2, however, we find that there was some discussion

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.480
that took place between Elijah and Elisha.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:24.760
And Elijah tells Elisha in verse number 10, Thou hast asked a hard thing, nevertheless,

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:30.299
if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee, but if not, it shall

00:06:30.299 --> 00:06:31.619
not be so.

00:06:31.619 --> 00:06:34.700
This was with regard to the double portion that he requested.

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:39.299
In verse number 11, It came to pass, as they still went on and talked, that, behold, there

00:06:39.299 --> 00:06:45.619
appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder.

00:06:45.619 --> 00:06:53.679
It says this, And Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven, and Elisha saw it, and he cried,

00:06:53.679 --> 00:07:01.000
My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.820
And he saw them no more.

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:06.839
It says that he took hold of his own clothes and rent them in two pieces, and of course

00:07:06.839 --> 00:07:13.000
we begin the life and ministry of Elisha after Elijah's translation.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.920
It's interesting as we begin to see the way in which Joash would approach and greet Elisha

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.799
here in 2 Kings 13.

00:07:21.799 --> 00:07:26.239
I mentioned already that it reveals the influence that Elisha had, but I also believe that it

00:07:26.239 --> 00:07:34.480
reveals to us that Joash understood not only the position that Elisha had as being a prophet

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:41.480
of God, but the way in which God's power had been used and had been evidenced in the life

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:42.799
of Elisha.

00:07:42.799 --> 00:07:46.079
Of course, we've studied many of the miracles of Elisha, and you study the miracles, you

00:07:46.079 --> 00:07:52.720
begin to see how God used Elisha in mighty ways, and no doubt that God is continuing

00:07:52.720 --> 00:08:00.380
to give His people Israel a witness and an opportunity to hear the truth of the Word

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:02.399
of God.

00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:08.040
I think about the time in which Ahab and Jehoshaphat made affinity and they were to go into battle

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:14.200
together and Ahab of course had called some false prophets over and Jehoshaphat inquired

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:20.040
were there not a prophet of God that we can inquire of, and in that passage of Scripture

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:25.160
Ahab reveals that there was one, but his name was Micaiah and he always prophesied that

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.640
which was evil with regard to Ahab.

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:33.359
It had something to do with the wickedness of Ahab, not with the prophecy of Micaiah.

00:08:33.359 --> 00:08:38.919
The reality is that we find that God would use Micaiah to give that voice and to give

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:44.200
that truth that was needed, and I'm thankful that God has always, as we look throughout

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:48.520
the history of Israel, we study the entirety of the Old Testament, you find that God always

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:53.559
sent prophets, there was a voice, there was truth, and we find that even Jeremiah on the

00:08:53.559 --> 00:08:58.640
eve of captivity of the Babylonians there of Judah, that he's prophesying and he's giving

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:00.400
the truth.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:07.320
We find here that Joash, though he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam, in this

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:14.559
final meeting it is revealed to us the influence that Elisha had and the fact that he, Joash,

00:09:14.559 --> 00:09:20.640
recognized the position that Elisha held as being a prophet of God.

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:24.559
Notice with me, not only a final meeting, but there's a final message.

00:09:24.559 --> 00:09:28.200
In verse number 15, the Bible says, "...and Elisha said unto him..."

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:33.859
In verses 15 through 19, this final message is revealed to us, and really we could call

00:09:33.859 --> 00:09:39.400
it a final prophecy if we'd like, and in this final message we find that really Elisha will

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:45.960
use two object lessons and then give a prophecy with regard to those object lessons.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:50.760
In verses 15 through 17, we see the first of these two object lessons, and it has to

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.039
do with shooting an arrow.

00:09:52.039 --> 00:09:58.080
Notice in verse 15, look at what Elisha says to Joash, "...take bow and arrows, and he took

00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.840
unto him bow and arrows.

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:00.039
And he..."

00:10:00.039 --> 00:10:02.199
He, Elisha, said to the king of Israel,

00:10:02.199 --> 00:10:03.319
that's Joash,

00:10:03.319 --> 00:10:06.419
put thine hand upon the bow.

00:10:06.419 --> 00:10:08.039
And he put his hand upon it.

00:10:08.039 --> 00:10:10.279
And Elisha put his hands upon the king's hands

00:10:10.279 --> 00:10:12.999
and he said, open the window eastward.

00:10:12.999 --> 00:10:14.319
And he opened it.

00:10:14.319 --> 00:10:16.359
Then Elisha said, shoot.

00:10:16.359 --> 00:10:17.639
And he shot.

00:10:17.639 --> 00:10:21.239
And he said, the arrow of the Lord's deliverance,

00:10:21.239 --> 00:10:23.559
the arrow of deliverance from Syria,

00:10:23.559 --> 00:10:25.999
for thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphac

00:10:25.999 --> 00:10:28.239
till thou have consumed them."

00:10:28.239 --> 00:10:30.759
Think about this first object lesson

00:10:30.759 --> 00:10:31.759
of shooting this arrow.

00:10:31.759 --> 00:10:33.639
And you see how step by step,

00:10:33.639 --> 00:10:36.119
Elisha took Joash through the process

00:10:36.119 --> 00:10:39.039
and Joash takes that bow and he takes those arrows.

00:10:39.039 --> 00:10:41.039
And the Bible tells us that Elisha

00:10:41.039 --> 00:10:43.399
then put his hands upon the king's hands.

00:10:43.399 --> 00:10:46.439
And he told him to open the window and to shoot.

00:10:46.439 --> 00:10:47.359
And he shot.

00:10:47.359 --> 00:10:50.319
And you find that Elisha then says,

00:10:50.319 --> 00:10:53.199
the arrow of the Lord's deliverance,

00:10:53.199 --> 00:10:54.919
there in verse number 17.

00:10:54.919 --> 00:10:57.359
If you look back into our passage of scripture

00:10:57.359 --> 00:10:59.239
at the beginning of chapter 13,

00:10:59.239 --> 00:11:01.599
you find that the Bible gives us an overview

00:11:01.599 --> 00:11:05.319
of the time in which Jehoahaz was king of Israel.

00:11:05.319 --> 00:11:06.759
And while he was king of Israel,

00:11:06.759 --> 00:11:08.399
the Bible tells us in verse number three

00:11:08.399 --> 00:11:11.879
that the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel

00:11:11.879 --> 00:11:14.319
and he delivered them into the hand of Haziel,

00:11:14.319 --> 00:11:17.119
king of Syria, in the hand of Ben-Hadad,

00:11:17.119 --> 00:11:19.679
the son of Haziel, all their days.

00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:21.719
And you begin to read through these verses of scripture

00:11:21.719 --> 00:11:25.719
and you find how that Syria had been once again

00:11:25.959 --> 00:11:27.399
oppressing Israel.

00:11:27.399 --> 00:11:30.119
It tells us at the end of verse number seven

00:11:30.119 --> 00:11:32.199
that the king of Syria had destroyed them

00:11:32.199 --> 00:11:35.719
and had made them like the dust by threshing.

00:11:35.719 --> 00:11:39.879
And so now we find that Elisha is now speaking to Joash.

00:11:39.879 --> 00:11:42.399
And Joash is the king after Jehoahaz.

00:11:42.399 --> 00:11:44.839
And we find there's still these problems with Syria

00:11:44.839 --> 00:11:46.319
and all these things are going on.

00:11:46.319 --> 00:11:48.559
And Elisha gives him an object lesson.

00:11:48.559 --> 00:11:49.919
And within that object lesson,

00:11:49.919 --> 00:11:51.439
he reminds him of the prophecy.

00:11:51.439 --> 00:11:53.959
The first mention there in verse number 17,

00:11:53.959 --> 00:11:55.119
the deliverance from Syria.

00:11:55.519 --> 00:11:56.359
And you notice he says,

00:11:56.359 --> 00:12:00.119
the arrow of the Lord's deliverance.

00:12:00.119 --> 00:12:00.959
And then he says,

00:12:00.959 --> 00:12:04.439
and the arrow of deliverance from Syria.

00:12:04.439 --> 00:12:06.079
Once again, as we've made note

00:12:06.079 --> 00:12:08.039
throughout the life of Elisha,

00:12:08.039 --> 00:12:10.759
many of his prophecies are very specific.

00:12:10.759 --> 00:12:14.639
And that's because God is a very specific God

00:12:14.639 --> 00:12:17.159
and he's omniscient, he knows all things.

00:12:17.159 --> 00:12:20.359
And Elisha is his servant, his prophet,

00:12:20.359 --> 00:12:22.439
and he's speaking the word of the Lord.

00:12:22.439 --> 00:12:24.879
We find that the second of these object lessons

00:12:24.919 --> 00:12:26.639
is found in verses 18 and 19

00:12:26.639 --> 00:12:29.279
and it has to do with smiting the arrows.

00:12:29.279 --> 00:12:30.959
It says this in verse number 18,

00:12:30.959 --> 00:12:35.119
and he said, again, Elisha speaking to Joash,

00:12:35.119 --> 00:12:37.839
take the arrows and he took them.

00:12:37.839 --> 00:12:39.199
And he said unto the king of Israel,

00:12:39.199 --> 00:12:41.799
smite upon the ground.

00:12:41.799 --> 00:12:45.399
And he smote thrice and stayed.

00:12:45.399 --> 00:12:47.759
And it's interesting response in verse number 19,

00:12:47.759 --> 00:12:51.999
the Bible says, and the man of God was wroth with him

00:12:51.999 --> 00:12:56.999
and said, thou shouldest have smitten five or six times,

00:12:57.359 --> 00:13:02.239
then hast thou smitten Syria till thou hast consumed it.

00:13:02.239 --> 00:13:07.239
Whereas now thou shalt smite Syria but thrice.

00:13:08.119 --> 00:13:11.119
So we find in the second object lesson

00:13:11.119 --> 00:13:13.159
that Elisha now says, take those arrows

00:13:13.159 --> 00:13:15.919
and he tells them to smite the ground.

00:13:15.919 --> 00:13:18.279
He tells them to smite upon the ground

00:13:18.279 --> 00:13:20.639
and he smote thrice and stayed.

00:13:20.639 --> 00:13:22.839
And we find that Elisha is angry with them

00:13:22.839 --> 00:13:25.559
and he says, you should have smitten five or six times

00:13:25.559 --> 00:13:28.599
and because you only did it three times,

00:13:28.599 --> 00:13:30.879
your deliverance and your victory,

00:13:30.879 --> 00:13:32.439
it should be but thrice,

00:13:32.439 --> 00:13:34.759
according to the end of verse number 19.

00:13:34.759 --> 00:13:37.799
Again, we find that in this passage,

00:13:37.799 --> 00:13:40.279
that Elisha in the final message

00:13:40.279 --> 00:13:42.519
that he would use these object lessons

00:13:42.519 --> 00:13:45.359
for the purpose of giving this prophecy

00:13:45.359 --> 00:13:47.079
of deliverance from Syria,

00:13:47.079 --> 00:13:49.359
but that it would be only thrice,

00:13:49.359 --> 00:13:51.719
three times that they would smite Syria.

00:13:51.719 --> 00:13:53.839
You notice here in verse number 19,

00:13:53.839 --> 00:13:55.879
the final message is given.

00:13:55.879 --> 00:13:56.959
Skip over if you will,

00:13:56.959 --> 00:13:58.959
we'll look at verses 20 and 21 here in just a moment,

00:13:58.959 --> 00:14:01.239
but look at verses 22 through 25,

00:14:01.239 --> 00:14:04.679
where we see the fulfillment of this prophecy.

00:14:04.679 --> 00:14:07.039
The Bible says, but Haziel, king of Syria,

00:14:07.039 --> 00:14:10.239
oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz.

00:14:10.239 --> 00:14:12.479
We mentioned that in the beginning of chapter 13.

00:14:12.479 --> 00:14:14.319
It says, and the Lord was gracious unto them

00:14:14.319 --> 00:14:17.039
and had compassion on them and had respect unto them

00:14:17.039 --> 00:14:19.759
because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob

00:14:19.759 --> 00:14:21.319
and would not destroy them,

00:14:21.319 --> 00:14:26.159
neither cast he them from his presence as yet.

00:14:26.159 --> 00:14:29.639
It's interesting, two final words to verse number 23,

00:14:29.639 --> 00:14:33.319
for we know that eventually the nation of Israel

00:14:33.319 --> 00:14:36.879
would be taken captive by the Assyrians

00:14:36.879 --> 00:14:41.279
and that is recorded for us later on in their history.

00:14:41.279 --> 00:14:42.759
But at this particular time,

00:14:42.759 --> 00:14:45.399
we find that the Lord continued to show grace

00:14:45.399 --> 00:14:47.999
and mercy, compassion to his people.

00:14:47.999 --> 00:14:51.079
In verse 24, so Haziel, king of Syria, died

00:14:51.079 --> 00:14:54.839
and Ben-Hadad, his son, reigned in his stead and Jehoash.

00:14:54.839 --> 00:14:57.799
Now that's Joash that we've been speaking of.

00:14:57.799 --> 00:14:58.999
It's interesting if you study

00:14:58.999 --> 00:15:01.959
through all of the history of what's going on,

00:15:01.959 --> 00:15:04.519
there's actually a Joash that's king of Judah.

00:15:04.519 --> 00:15:05.759
And so there's a distinction

00:15:05.759 --> 00:15:07.359
that is given at this particular time

00:15:07.359 --> 00:15:11.479
in using the phraseology Jehoash as opposed to Joash

00:15:11.479 --> 00:15:14.279
because there was a Joash that was king of Judah.

00:15:14.279 --> 00:15:16.159
And here the distinction being known

00:15:16.159 --> 00:15:18.919
that it is speaking of the king of Israel.

00:15:18.919 --> 00:15:22.599
In verse number 14, the distinction was not in name,

00:15:22.599 --> 00:15:25.079
but it said, and Joash, the king of Israel,

00:15:25.079 --> 00:15:27.439
so that we could make sure that we're having

00:15:27.439 --> 00:15:29.479
the proper knowledge of who is being spoken of.

00:15:29.479 --> 00:15:32.319
Notice in verse 25, that he took again

00:15:32.319 --> 00:15:35.599
out of the hand of Ben-Hadad, the son of Haziel, the cities,

00:15:35.599 --> 00:15:37.759
which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz,

00:15:37.759 --> 00:15:38.879
his father by war.

00:15:38.879 --> 00:15:43.879
Notice what it says, three times did Joash beat him

00:15:44.519 --> 00:15:47.839
and recovered the cities of Israel.

00:15:47.839 --> 00:15:51.119
It's exactly what Elisha had prophesied

00:15:51.119 --> 00:15:55.639
in verses 17 through 19 with regard to this final message

00:15:55.639 --> 00:15:58.399
that they would have, it was the Lord's deliverance,

00:15:58.399 --> 00:16:00.039
it was the arrow of the Lord's deliverance,

00:16:00.039 --> 00:16:02.439
and that they would have deliverance from Syria

00:16:02.439 --> 00:16:06.119
and that he should smite Syria but thrice.

00:16:06.119 --> 00:16:09.759
And that's exactly what happens in the fulfilled prophecy.

00:16:09.759 --> 00:16:11.679
So we see a final meeting, a final message,

00:16:11.679 --> 00:16:13.279
notice a final miracle.

00:16:13.279 --> 00:16:15.439
It's interesting if you look at verses 20 and 21,

00:16:15.439 --> 00:16:17.679
the Bible tells us in verse number 20

00:16:17.679 --> 00:16:20.279
that Elisha, he died and was buried.

00:16:20.279 --> 00:16:23.279
It tells us that there's something that's taking place

00:16:23.279 --> 00:16:26.119
at the same time, Elisha died, notice in verse 20,

00:16:26.119 --> 00:16:28.959
and they buried him, and the bands of the Moabites

00:16:28.959 --> 00:16:31.719
invaded the land at the coming in of the year,

00:16:31.719 --> 00:16:35.079
and it came to pass as they were burying a man.

00:16:35.079 --> 00:16:37.199
So there's this man, he's not named for us here

00:16:37.199 --> 00:16:41.119
in the passage of scripture, but he dies in battle.

00:16:41.119 --> 00:16:45.639
The Bible tells us that they spied a band of men,

00:16:45.639 --> 00:16:50.639
and so they cast this man into the sepulcher of Elisha.

00:16:50.759 --> 00:16:52.639
And it's interesting because the Bible tells us

00:16:52.639 --> 00:16:54.119
at the end of verse number 21,

00:16:54.119 --> 00:16:56.679
and I've called it a final miracle, of course,

00:16:56.679 --> 00:17:00.679
God was in this and allowing this to happen

00:17:00.679 --> 00:17:04.119
and giving to really the Joash

00:17:04.119 --> 00:17:06.439
and the nation of Israel at this time

00:17:06.439 --> 00:17:09.079
the fact that the prophecy would come to pass

00:17:09.079 --> 00:17:11.679
as we've just read in verses 22 through 25.

00:17:11.679 --> 00:17:13.679
And the Bible ends in verse number 21 and says,

00:17:13.679 --> 00:17:16.159
and when the man was let down

00:17:17.319 --> 00:17:20.319
and touched the bones of Elisha,

00:17:20.319 --> 00:17:24.999
he revived and stood up on his feet.

00:17:24.999 --> 00:17:26.519
That's kind of interesting, isn't it?

00:17:26.519 --> 00:17:28.839
That's not what you would expect, right?

00:17:28.839 --> 00:17:33.079
You're casting this guy in, you see this band of soldiers,

00:17:33.079 --> 00:17:35.279
the Bible tells us that this one was,

00:17:35.279 --> 00:17:38.279
they were gonna bury this guy, they spied a band of men,

00:17:38.279 --> 00:17:42.799
and so they cast him into the sepulcher of Elisha.

00:17:42.799 --> 00:17:47.079
And when that man touches the bones of Elisha, he revives.

00:17:47.079 --> 00:17:48.799
And he stands up and he's gonna get out.

00:17:48.799 --> 00:17:50.319
That's amazing, right?

00:17:50.319 --> 00:17:52.439
Not what you would expect, not what's going on.

00:17:52.439 --> 00:17:56.279
And we see really, again, a final miracle.

00:17:56.279 --> 00:17:58.359
Elisha, of course, his ministry was known

00:17:58.359 --> 00:18:00.039
for many miracles that took place.

00:18:00.039 --> 00:18:02.039
We've studied through those miracles.

00:18:02.039 --> 00:18:04.959
We've seen the power of God and the hand of God,

00:18:04.999 --> 00:18:08.479
and we've seen how God was helping his people

00:18:08.479 --> 00:18:10.679
understand the power that he had.

00:18:10.679 --> 00:18:13.919
And we find here, even after the death of Elisha,

00:18:13.919 --> 00:18:17.599
that God would allow this miraculous reviving

00:18:17.599 --> 00:18:21.399
of this individual as he was cast into the sepulcher

00:18:21.399 --> 00:18:26.399
of Elisha to come to be revived and to stand upon his feet.

00:18:27.239 --> 00:18:28.799
Now, as we think about this passage of Scripture,

00:18:28.799 --> 00:18:30.999
we see a final meeting, a final message,

00:18:30.999 --> 00:18:32.440
and a final miracle.

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:34.919
I want you to think about the life of Elisha.

00:18:34.919 --> 00:18:37.199
And I want you to think, as we've studied now

00:18:37.199 --> 00:18:40.719
for so many weeks, and we understand that Elisha,

00:18:40.719 --> 00:18:44.959
he ministered faithfully and courageously.

00:18:44.959 --> 00:18:48.599
I want you to understand that Elisha served the Lord

00:18:48.599 --> 00:18:51.639
during a time of great wickedness.

00:18:51.639 --> 00:18:55.039
We think about the condition of Israel as a nation,

00:18:55.039 --> 00:18:57.959
and we think about the way in which he was serving.

00:18:57.959 --> 00:19:00.839
And, of course, Elijah served during a time

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:03.679
of great wickedness in the nation of Israel,

00:19:03.679 --> 00:19:06.440
Ahab as being the king, married to Jezebel,

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:07.719
and all of the wickedness.

00:19:07.719 --> 00:19:10.519
And we made mention of several of those things.

00:19:10.519 --> 00:19:13.039
But we find that when Elisha begins to reign,

00:19:13.039 --> 00:19:17.519
or when he begins to serve, that Jehoram is the king,

00:19:17.519 --> 00:19:20.279
as we find in the passage of Scripture

00:19:20.279 --> 00:19:23.039
right after the translation of Elijah,

00:19:23.039 --> 00:19:27.199
King Jehoram and King Jehu, King Jehoahaz,

00:19:27.199 --> 00:19:28.679
and then King Joash.

00:19:28.679 --> 00:19:32.159
Now, we're not sure exactly of how many years

00:19:32.159 --> 00:19:36.199
of Joash's reign that Elisha was ministering,

00:19:36.199 --> 00:19:39.639
but if you take the first three kings of Israel

00:19:39.639 --> 00:19:43.519
under whom Elisha was serving and ministering,

00:19:43.519 --> 00:19:46.799
their three reigns total 57 years.

00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:51.239
So Elisha ministered for nearly 60 years,

00:19:51.239 --> 00:19:54.839
and he ministered faithfully and courageously.

00:19:54.839 --> 00:19:57.239
And we begin to read, as we've studied

00:19:57.239 --> 00:20:00.079
throughout these passages of Scripture.

00:20:00.079 --> 00:20:04.119
begin to see how that he dealt with all sorts of things

00:20:04.119 --> 00:20:07.319
and looking at the wickedness of Israel and their idolatry

00:20:07.319 --> 00:20:09.439
and all of those things that are going on,

00:20:09.439 --> 00:20:14.559
and yet you see a man that faithfully and courageously served God.

00:20:14.559 --> 00:20:16.679
A man who stood for the Lord.

00:20:16.679 --> 00:20:22.599
A man who stood upon the truth and prophesied faithfully.

00:20:22.599 --> 00:20:26.439
As I study the life of Elisha and as we conclude this evening,

00:20:26.439 --> 00:20:30.759
I believe that we ought to be not only encouraged by the life

00:20:30.759 --> 00:20:35.519
and ministry of Elisha, but I believe we should be challenged.

00:20:35.519 --> 00:20:39.239
I believe that as we study through the lives of those

00:20:39.239 --> 00:20:41.639
that are recorded for us within the Word of God,

00:20:41.639 --> 00:20:44.279
but even those contemporaries that have gone before us

00:20:44.279 --> 00:20:46.879
begin to think about their lives and their faithfulness

00:20:46.879 --> 00:20:50.119
and we begin to, yes, be encouraged by that,

00:20:50.119 --> 00:20:53.239
but we ought to be challenged.

00:20:53.239 --> 00:20:56.839
I believe there are times in which we are tempted to think about

00:20:56.839 --> 00:21:01.199
the difficulties in which we have to serve.

00:21:01.199 --> 00:21:05.359
We begin to think about the landscape of the things that are going on

00:21:05.359 --> 00:21:07.279
in our society, in our culture,

00:21:07.279 --> 00:21:09.479
and we begin to think about the wickedness and say,

00:21:09.479 --> 00:21:14.279
man, it's so bad, it's so terrible, and it's so challenging.

00:21:14.279 --> 00:21:17.199
Listen, there are many people that have gone before us

00:21:17.199 --> 00:21:20.599
that have served God faithfully and courageously

00:21:20.599 --> 00:21:23.479
in times of great wickedness,

00:21:23.479 --> 00:21:27.879
that dealt with great levels of adversity and oppression.

00:21:27.879 --> 00:21:33.239
We think about the way in which Elisha would stand and he would serve,

00:21:33.239 --> 00:21:38.719
and I say, oh, that God would enable us to have that same level of courage,

00:21:38.719 --> 00:21:44.799
that God would enable us to have that same level of faithfulness to serve Him.

00:21:44.799 --> 00:21:48.399
As I think about the life of Elisha and it comes to its end here

00:21:48.399 --> 00:21:55.079
in 2 Kings 13, and we say it's a life that was used by God,

00:21:55.079 --> 00:21:57.319
that he was a man that was surrendered to the Lord

00:21:57.319 --> 00:21:59.479
and to the work that God had for him,

00:21:59.479 --> 00:22:02.879
and I say, oh, that we too would be in that same position,

00:22:02.879 --> 00:22:06.519
that we would allow God to work in and through us.

00:22:06.519 --> 00:22:08.719
We sang tonight about channels only,

00:22:08.719 --> 00:22:14.359
how appropriate to think about how Elisha was used of God as a channel,

00:22:14.399 --> 00:22:18.679
and God used him, and God was glorified through his life,

00:22:18.679 --> 00:22:20.719
and I think about our lives today,

00:22:20.719 --> 00:22:23.959
and I'm mindful of two passages in the New Testament.

00:22:23.959 --> 00:22:26.199
Quickly going to make reference to them.

00:22:26.199 --> 00:22:30.799
Turn to the book of Ephesians, if you will, and chapter number 6.

00:22:30.799 --> 00:22:32.159
I'm going to make reference here,

00:22:32.159 --> 00:22:35.319
and then we'll make reference in 2 Timothy chapter number 3,

00:22:35.319 --> 00:22:39.239
and then be done this evening and have our time of prayer.

00:22:39.279 --> 00:22:42.039
But I want you to consider with me

00:22:42.039 --> 00:22:48.839
these many years of faithful ministry of Elisha,

00:22:48.839 --> 00:22:53.719
and ask the Lord to help us to have the strength and courage

00:22:53.719 --> 00:22:57.479
to stand in days of adversity and great wickedness.

00:22:57.479 --> 00:23:00.759
The Bible says in Ephesians 6 and beginning in verse number 10,

00:23:00.759 --> 00:23:05.319
Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and the power of His might.

00:23:05.319 --> 00:23:07.759
Put on the whole armor of God,

00:23:07.799 --> 00:23:13.119
that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.

00:23:13.119 --> 00:23:15.519
For we wrestle not against flesh and blood,

00:23:15.519 --> 00:23:17.439
but against principalities, against powers,

00:23:17.439 --> 00:23:20.199
against the rulers of the darkness of this world,

00:23:20.199 --> 00:23:23.199
against spiritual wickedness in high places.

00:23:23.199 --> 00:23:26.079
We are engaged in spiritual warfare, amen?

00:23:26.079 --> 00:23:27.359
We see it all around us.

00:23:27.359 --> 00:23:30.439
I mentioned to a couple of folks that I spoke to on the phone today,

00:23:30.439 --> 00:23:32.919
with just a little bit of spiritual discernment,

00:23:32.919 --> 00:23:35.079
you can easily acknowledge today

00:23:35.119 --> 00:23:38.239
that we're living in great spiritual warfare.

00:23:38.239 --> 00:23:40.279
The Bible continues in verse number 13,

00:23:40.279 --> 00:23:43.999
Wherefore, take unto you the whole armor of God,

00:23:43.999 --> 00:23:49.199
notice that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day,

00:23:49.199 --> 00:23:52.799
and having done all, to stand.

00:23:52.799 --> 00:23:57.039
Stand therefore, having your loins girded out with truth,

00:23:57.039 --> 00:23:59.359
and having on the breastplate of righteousness,

00:23:59.359 --> 00:24:02.119
and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace,

00:24:02.119 --> 00:24:04.439
above all, taking the shield of faith,

00:24:04.439 --> 00:24:08.599
wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked,

00:24:08.599 --> 00:24:11.199
and take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit,

00:24:11.199 --> 00:24:14.399
which is the Word of God.

00:24:14.399 --> 00:24:18.679
You notice on a number of occasions in these few verses of Scripture in Ephesians 6

00:24:18.679 --> 00:24:21.199
that the word stand or withstand is used,

00:24:21.199 --> 00:24:23.559
and the importance of standing.

00:24:23.559 --> 00:24:25.319
I'm thankful as we've studied,

00:24:25.319 --> 00:24:28.799
and really we began the study of the life of Elijah and Elisha

00:24:28.799 --> 00:24:30.599
back in August of last year,

00:24:30.599 --> 00:24:33.679
and we've studied through their lives on Wednesday evenings,

00:24:33.679 --> 00:24:37.839
and we've had the opportunity to study the lives of these two great prophets,

00:24:37.839 --> 00:24:41.959
and to see individuals that stood for the Lord,

00:24:41.959 --> 00:24:44.279
that took that stand.

00:24:44.279 --> 00:24:46.359
And as New Testament believers,

00:24:46.359 --> 00:24:49.519
we have this instruction in Ephesians 6

00:24:49.519 --> 00:24:52.799
with regard to the spiritual warfare that we're engaged in,

00:24:52.799 --> 00:24:55.599
and that we're to be strong in the Lord, and the power of His might,

00:24:55.599 --> 00:24:57.719
to put on the whole armor of God.

00:24:57.719 --> 00:25:01.039
Why? So that we can stand in this evil day,

00:25:01.039 --> 00:25:04.759
so that we can withstand in this evil day,

00:25:04.759 --> 00:25:12.399
and we understand that we have been given this responsibility to stand for truth.

00:25:12.399 --> 00:25:14.199
You look in our society today,

00:25:14.199 --> 00:25:18.919
and you see people all over the place that are folding.

00:25:18.919 --> 00:25:20.599
They're not standing.

00:25:20.599 --> 00:25:22.159
Amen?

00:25:22.159 --> 00:25:23.119
You see it.

00:25:23.119 --> 00:25:26.399
And I'm not saying that you have to be ugly about standing,

00:25:26.399 --> 00:25:28.319
but you need to stand.

00:25:28.319 --> 00:25:29.199
Amen?

00:25:29.199 --> 00:25:32.279
Truth is truth.

00:25:32.279 --> 00:25:33.079
Amen?

00:25:33.079 --> 00:25:36.799
In Romans, Paul asks the question as he's speaking there about the Jews,

00:25:36.799 --> 00:25:38.399
you know, what can we do against the truth?

00:25:38.399 --> 00:25:40.679
You can't do anything against the truth.

00:25:40.679 --> 00:25:42.519
Only for the truth.

00:25:42.519 --> 00:25:45.199
And the reality is that Jesus is the truth,

00:25:45.199 --> 00:25:48.399
and He's given us His Word which is truth.

00:25:48.399 --> 00:25:50.519
Oh, that we'd stand on it.

00:25:50.519 --> 00:25:54.719
We don't have to cave in to the pressures of our society.

00:25:54.719 --> 00:25:58.519
We don't need to be in a position where we feel like we have to be

00:25:58.519 --> 00:26:01.719
quote-unquote politically correct.

00:26:01.719 --> 00:26:06.119
I'd much rather be biblically correct than politically correct.

00:26:06.119 --> 00:26:07.679
Amen?

00:26:07.679 --> 00:26:16.479
I mean, to think about the fact that we would try to cater to the demands of a culture

00:26:16.479 --> 00:26:23.039
that we're living in, and at the very same time, not please our Savior.

00:26:23.039 --> 00:26:26.119
See, sometimes we don't think about it that way.

00:26:26.119 --> 00:26:28.799
I'd much rather please my Savior.

00:26:28.799 --> 00:26:29.479
Amen?

00:26:29.479 --> 00:26:32.679
I'm going to stand before Him, by the way, and so are you.

00:26:32.679 --> 00:26:37.159
I'd much rather please Him than cave in to the pressures of this world.

00:26:37.159 --> 00:26:41.279
I'm thankful that Elijah and Elisha, they didn't cave in.

00:26:41.279 --> 00:26:43.439
They stood boldly.

00:26:43.439 --> 00:26:46.119
They stood courageously.

00:26:46.119 --> 00:26:47.559
Oh, that we would stand.

00:26:47.559 --> 00:26:51.479
Not only that we would stand even as we've studied so many of these lessons

00:26:51.479 --> 00:26:53.879
through the lives of these two prophets,

00:26:53.879 --> 00:26:57.119
but I think of this truth in 2 Timothy chapter number 3.

00:26:57.119 --> 00:27:01.599
Not only that the New Testament principle of standing according to Ephesians 6,

00:27:01.599 --> 00:27:05.799
but this word in 2 Timothy 3, continue.

00:27:05.799 --> 00:27:07.519
Continue.

00:27:07.519 --> 00:27:10.399
It's not a time to wave the white flag of surrender.

00:27:10.399 --> 00:27:12.039
It's not a time to give up.

00:27:12.039 --> 00:27:13.399
It's not a time to retreat.

00:27:13.399 --> 00:27:16.679
It's not a time to, no, it's a time to continue.

00:27:16.679 --> 00:27:18.079
Amen?

00:27:18.079 --> 00:27:20.279
We find that in 2 Timothy chapter number 3,

00:27:20.279 --> 00:27:23.719
we don't have the time this evening to read the entirety of the passage,

00:27:23.719 --> 00:27:27.439
so if you'd let me just read a few of these verses

00:27:27.439 --> 00:27:29.559
and give you kind of the overview.

00:27:29.559 --> 00:27:31.919
Paul begins it this way in verse number 1.

00:27:31.919 --> 00:27:35.479
This know also.

00:27:35.479 --> 00:27:39.959
You find often throughout the Word of God that our God wants us to be informed.

00:27:39.959 --> 00:27:41.879
He doesn't want us to be ignorant.

00:27:41.879 --> 00:27:44.559
In fact, many times in the writings of Paul,

00:27:44.559 --> 00:27:45.959
he'll use that phraseology,

00:27:45.959 --> 00:27:48.519
I would not that you be ignorant, brethren.

00:27:48.599 --> 00:27:51.679
There are some, according to 2 Peter chapter number 3,

00:27:51.679 --> 00:27:54.519
that were willfully ignorant.

00:27:54.519 --> 00:27:55.639
Amen?

00:27:55.639 --> 00:27:57.639
They were willingly ignorant of these things.

00:27:57.639 --> 00:27:59.199
Oh, I trust that we'd be informed.

00:27:59.199 --> 00:28:02.999
I remember what one evangelist said that was here many years ago,

00:28:02.999 --> 00:28:04.279
Brother Caldwell.

00:28:04.279 --> 00:28:05.479
He said this, he said,

00:28:05.479 --> 00:28:09.959
the thing that bothers me the most is not somebody that doesn't know the truth,

00:28:09.959 --> 00:28:14.359
it's somebody that doesn't want to know the truth.

00:28:14.359 --> 00:28:16.199
That's sad.

00:28:16.239 --> 00:28:20.799
Paul says, know this, be informed of this,

00:28:20.799 --> 00:28:26.439
that in the last days perilous times shall come.

00:28:26.439 --> 00:28:28.359
For men shall be lovers of their own selves,

00:28:28.359 --> 00:28:30.439
covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers,

00:28:30.439 --> 00:28:32.959
disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,

00:28:32.959 --> 00:28:34.879
without natural affection, truce breakers,

00:28:34.879 --> 00:28:36.919
false accusers, incontinent, fierce,

00:28:36.919 --> 00:28:38.359
despisers of those that are good,

00:28:38.359 --> 00:28:39.759
traitors, heady, high-minded,

00:28:39.759 --> 00:28:41.999
lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God,

00:28:41.999 --> 00:28:44.159
having a form of godliness,

00:28:44.159 --> 00:28:48.039
but denying the power thereof from such turn away.

00:28:48.039 --> 00:28:48.879
What a list.

00:28:48.879 --> 00:28:52.479
We don't have time to go through all of these points this evening,

00:28:52.479 --> 00:28:54.799
but Paul's letting Timothy know,

00:28:54.799 --> 00:28:56.039
here's the description,

00:28:56.039 --> 00:28:58.799
here are the characteristics of these last days.

00:28:58.799 --> 00:29:00.559
Skip down to verse number 12.

00:29:00.559 --> 00:29:06.159
Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.

00:29:06.159 --> 00:29:09.399
You say, I wish it wasn't there, but it is.

00:29:09.399 --> 00:29:11.799
Paul's letting Timothy know.

00:29:11.799 --> 00:29:15.559
You don't live for God.

00:29:15.559 --> 00:29:16.399
Persecution's gonna come.

00:29:16.399 --> 00:29:17.599
What did Jesus say?

00:29:17.599 --> 00:29:21.319
If they've hated me, they're gonna hate you.

00:29:21.319 --> 00:29:25.679
Peter will later say, don't think it strange about this fiery trial.

00:29:25.679 --> 00:29:26.719
Right?

00:29:26.719 --> 00:29:28.279
And here he says this,

00:29:28.279 --> 00:29:30.519
but evil men and seducers, verse 13,

00:29:30.519 --> 00:29:33.479
shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.

00:29:33.479 --> 00:29:36.439
Now, after Paul gives all of that information,

00:29:36.439 --> 00:29:38.279
after Paul lets Timothy know,

00:29:38.279 --> 00:29:40.279
here's how it's gonna be characterized,

00:29:40.279 --> 00:29:41.359
here's what you're gonna deal with,

00:29:41.359 --> 00:29:44.319
there's gonna be persecution if you live godly in Christ Jesus.

00:29:44.319 --> 00:29:45.879
These men are gonna wax worse and worse,

00:29:45.879 --> 00:29:47.079
they're not gonna get better and better,

00:29:47.079 --> 00:29:48.519
that's what you're gonna deal with.

00:29:48.519 --> 00:29:52.599
And then, how would Paul then tell Timothy what to do with this?

00:29:52.599 --> 00:29:55.639
But, continue.

00:29:55.639 --> 00:29:57.759
Continue.

00:29:57.759 --> 00:29:59.159
You know all of this stuff,

00:29:59.159 --> 00:30:00.159
but it's not that you...

00:30:00.159 --> 00:30:04.239
retreat. It's not that you go hide. It's not that you give up. It's not that you

00:30:04.239 --> 00:30:09.119
know you continue. Continue in what? Continue thou in the things which thou

00:30:09.119 --> 00:30:12.759
hast learned and has been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them.

00:30:12.759 --> 00:30:20.159
To make sure that it was clear for us, I'm believing that that Timothy had an

00:30:20.159 --> 00:30:24.639
understanding of what Paul would be referring to. And we find that the

00:30:24.639 --> 00:30:30.279
continuation goes that from a child thou has known the Holy Scriptures, which

00:30:30.279 --> 00:30:33.679
are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in

00:30:33.679 --> 00:30:38.199
Christ Jesus. All scripture is given by inspiration of God. It's profitable for

00:30:38.199 --> 00:30:41.599
doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the

00:30:41.599 --> 00:30:45.519
man of God might be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works. And then

00:30:45.519 --> 00:30:49.079
he tells them, preach the word in verse number two of chapter number four.

00:30:49.079 --> 00:30:56.319
Continue, Timothy. So when I think about Elijah and Elisha, this this is our 34th

00:30:56.319 --> 00:31:02.999
lesson that we studied these prophets of God. We've seen so many wonderful things.

00:31:02.999 --> 00:31:10.279
But if we could finish our study of these prophets, Elisha in particular, over

00:31:10.279 --> 00:31:16.559
the last 17 or so of these lessons, that we'd understand that they they stood.

00:31:16.559 --> 00:31:24.639
They stood. They didn't serve in a time in which the kings were promoting

00:31:24.639 --> 00:31:30.919
righteousness and cleaning out the false idols. They didn't serve in times of

00:31:30.919 --> 00:31:38.519
where we see some that had served. They served in times of great wickedness. Yet

00:31:38.519 --> 00:31:43.679
they stood. And they continued. They were faithful. One thing that I like about

00:31:43.799 --> 00:31:48.839
both of these prophets is they were faithful unto the end. Faithful unto the

00:31:48.839 --> 00:31:54.959
end. You know, God has called us to live a life of faithfulness until the end. But

00:31:54.959 --> 00:31:59.839
we talk much about wanting to finish well. In this same book, in 2nd Timothy,

00:31:59.839 --> 00:32:03.079
you get into chapter 4 and you begin to see how Paul mentions about

00:32:03.079 --> 00:32:10.239
finishing, and how he had finished his race. It didn't happen by accident. All

00:32:10.239 --> 00:32:13.679
the way back in Acts chapter number 20, when Paul is speaking to the Ephesian

00:32:13.679 --> 00:32:21.159
elders, he makes this statement that, I might finish my course with joy. You have

00:32:21.159 --> 00:32:27.079
to purpose to finish. If you're gonna stand, if you're gonna continue, oh, you

00:32:27.079 --> 00:32:31.279
need to to follow the admonition of God in his word, that we put on the whole

00:32:31.279 --> 00:32:35.479
armor of God and understand that we're to be strong in the Lord, the power

00:32:35.479 --> 00:32:39.159
of his might, so on and so forth, that we follow the truth of the Word of God. But

00:32:39.159 --> 00:32:44.959
there are so many pressures in our society today. But don't think for a

00:32:44.959 --> 00:32:49.239
moment that those that have gone before us, that faithfully and courageously

00:32:49.239 --> 00:32:55.399
served God, did not face similar pressures. The pressures are nothing new.

00:32:55.399 --> 00:33:02.119
The opposition, the work of God, has always been. But throughout history, you

00:33:02.119 --> 00:33:08.759
get the privilege of reading about some some folks that stood and continued, even

00:33:08.839 --> 00:33:13.519
in the face of adversity. And I'm thankful that Elijah and Elisha are two

00:33:13.519 --> 00:33:20.399
such prophets that stood and continued, and they serve faithfully unto the end.

00:33:20.399 --> 00:33:25.079
Oh, that God would not only encourage us through the study of these two great

00:33:25.079 --> 00:33:30.279
prophets, but challenge us that we would live in like manner. That we just

00:33:30.279 --> 00:33:35.079
determine, you know what? I want to be biblically correct. I want to stand, and I

00:33:35.079 --> 00:33:39.399
want to continue. I want to be found faithful. Well done, thou good and

00:33:39.399 --> 00:33:43.399
faithful servant. Amen. Let's pray. Father, we love you. We thank you for loving us.

00:33:43.399 --> 00:33:48.799
Thank you for the lives of these two prophets of Israel. We thank you for the

00:33:48.799 --> 00:33:53.039
privilege over so many months to now study their lives, and to trace their

00:33:53.039 --> 00:33:58.079
steps, and to see, God, what it was that you were able to accomplish through them.

00:33:58.079 --> 00:34:04.279
Lord, we know the times of great wickedness in which they served, and how

00:34:04.319 --> 00:34:09.199
grateful we are that they stood, and they continued, and they were faithful unto

00:34:09.199 --> 00:34:14.599
the end. Father, we understand that you've given us now a responsibility. This is

00:34:14.599 --> 00:34:21.839
our time to serve you, to live for you. Before the service this evening, the

00:34:21.839 --> 00:34:28.639
instrumentalists were playing, Living for Jesus. Oh, Father, I pray that you'd

00:34:28.639 --> 00:34:37.519
help us to live for you. Lord, help us to stand. Help us, Lord, to continue. Help us

00:34:37.519 --> 00:34:43.359
to not cave to the pressures of our society or our culture. Help us to live

00:34:43.359 --> 00:34:48.239
for you, and to make a difference. I pray, God, that you would use us as channels.

00:34:48.239 --> 00:34:55.959
Lord, that we would be clean vessels, fit for the Master's use. That, God, you alone

00:34:55.999 --> 00:34:59.439
would be honored and glorified through our lives. Well, thank you for the work

00:34:59.439 --> 00:35:04.519
that you'll do. For it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
