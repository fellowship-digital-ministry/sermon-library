1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
came from. I mean, can you imagine that bass came out of

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:08,439
that guy? I mean, you know a young guy with a bass voice

3
00:00:08,479 --> 00:00:10,939
like that, that was amazing. What a great finish that was,

4
00:00:10,979 --> 00:00:13,680
amen. And I heard some of you Baptists back there tapping

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:17,920
your toes. Amen. Praise the Lord. I enjoyed that. I

6
00:00:17,959 --> 00:00:20,719
videoed that and I'm going to put it on my Facebook page so

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,420
that everybody can see the great music you folks have

8
00:00:24,459 --> 00:00:26,819
here. I appreciate so much your music. It's been a joy

9
00:00:26,819 --> 00:00:30,920
these last few days just to be able to sing the old hymns of

10
00:00:30,959 --> 00:00:33,819
the faith. And to have these young men tonight get up and

11
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:36,220
sing, they're really good. I'll tell you what, I think I

12
00:00:36,259 --> 00:00:40,060
ought to take them with me. I need some singers. You know

13
00:00:40,099 --> 00:00:42,740
some evangelists travel in a team and they have singers

14
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:46,900
with them, several of them do. And I've never had anybody

15
00:00:46,939 --> 00:00:49,939
travel with me to sing. Sometimes I try to sing, but

16
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:51,939
they always tell me, no don't sing Brother Meshon, just

17
00:00:51,979 --> 00:00:55,020
preach, amen. But I enjoyed that tonight, it was a

18
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,680
blessing. Just want to let you know before I preach tonight

19
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,880
how much we appreciate you folks. You've been a blessing

20
00:00:59,919 --> 00:01:02,880
to us over the years. And it's been good to be back here

21
00:01:02,919 --> 00:01:06,220
again and to meet some old friends after a few years of

22
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:09,260
not having been here. And then also too we've met some new

23
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,459
people that have been added to the church since we were last

24
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,839
here. And we have really enjoyed this week together

25
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,940
with you. It's been a blessing to spend time with the

26
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:20,900
pastor and his wife and his family. We've enjoyed that as

27
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,580
well. And we've eaten well over there, praise the Lord.

28
00:01:23,699 --> 00:01:28,180
Mrs. Pastor has been feeding us well. And so we are leaving

29
00:01:28,199 --> 00:01:31,040
here a little heavier than we came. But that's alright

30
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,639
because you know it's always a blessing to be able to sit

31
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,779
down and enjoy a good meal and just have fellowship around

32
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:39,319
the table with God's people. And we've enjoyed that. Also

33
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,080
too I want to let you know how much we appreciate your

34
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,019
support of our ministry. You've been faithful and we

35
00:01:43,059 --> 00:01:45,860
certainly appreciate that. And by the way let me say this, I

36
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,620
want to commend you, you are one of the few of our

37
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:51,959
supporting churches that sends us birthday cards, and

38
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,879
anniversary cards, and Christmas cards. And you keep

39
00:01:54,919 --> 00:01:57,959
up with those events in our lives. And that means a lot to

40
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:00,919
us because many times even though we have supporting

41
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:04,500
churches that we love and we appreciate sometimes we don't

42
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:08,160
always hear from our churches. And it's so good for us to be

43
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:11,240
able to hear from your church. And it means a lot, it really

44
00:02:11,259 --> 00:02:13,600
does. We have a church up in Alaska what they do is every

45
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:18,539
fifth Wednesday night they come to the Wednesday night

46
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,740
service. And what they do is everybody in the church

47
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:24,160
writes to missionaries. And they've been doing that now for

48
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:26,860
several years. I think the pastor told me for at least the

49
00:02:26,899 --> 00:02:31,300
last 25 or 30 years. And so we always get a nice card from

50
00:02:31,339 --> 00:02:33,639
them at different events and that's always been such a joy

51
00:02:33,679 --> 00:02:36,539
to us. So we appreciate that. And your support means a lot

52
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:38,740
to us because we couldn't stay on the road really without

53
00:02:38,779 --> 00:02:43,720
having some support from churches that we've known over

54
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:47,059
the years that we love, and they love us, and they've

55
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,720
helped us. And it's been a blessing because our ministry

56
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,000
has always been geared towards small churches. We don't

57
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:55,039
generally go into bigger churches. The largest church

58
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,179
that I think I've ever preached in was probably the weekend I

59
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:01,080
was there was about 1,500 in attendance. And I'm not used to

60
00:03:01,119 --> 00:03:05,320
that many people. And usually I'm preaching in churches that

61
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,020
run between 50 and 150. And we want to help the smaller

62
00:03:09,059 --> 00:03:11,300
churches. And we want to help the church planters. And I've

63
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,160
been involved in church planning. And I'm glad that

64
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:17,440
I've had the opportunity to do that. We planted a Spanish

65
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,360
speaking church in the inner city of San Diego. We started

66
00:03:20,399 --> 00:03:24,259
that church with a Mexican national. And that work is

67
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,699
doing well. And we're thankful for it. I understand that we're

68
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,740
getting ready to plant another church out of that one. So we

69
00:03:29,779 --> 00:03:32,339
support that work out of our home church. I think we still

70
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,779
do. And so we're glad for that. And I've helped other young

71
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,039
men as well and try to be an encouragement to them in church

72
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,619
planning. So you help us to help them. And you minister to

73
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:45,360
us and it helps us to minister to others. And by the way it

74
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:50,779
helps us to put gasoline in the tank. Amen. That SUV it doesn't

75
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,419
go down the road without gasoline. It is not electric.

76
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:57,759
And it is not hybrid. It's gas engine. And even though it's a

77
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,860
pretty thrifty little vehicle at the same time gasoline out in

78
00:04:01,899 --> 00:04:05,500
our area of the world is extremely expensive. So we're

79
00:04:05,539 --> 00:04:08,300
thankful for your support of our ministry and your partners with

80
00:04:08,339 --> 00:04:11,279
us. And we don't take that for granted. So thank you. We

81
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,740
appreciate it church. God bless you for it. And we want you to

82
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,059
know we love you and we appreciate you. Deuteronomy

83
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,760
chapter 6 in your Bible tonight. Now I am not feeling well and

84
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:22,540
I've been telling you that the last couple of days. I'm not

85
00:04:22,559 --> 00:04:26,640
shaking hands tonight I'm just blowing my nose. So forgive me

86
00:04:26,679 --> 00:04:29,779
for that. I had a bad day today. I got up I guess this morning

87
00:04:29,799 --> 00:04:33,040
about 5.30 and I thought I'd been hit by a truck. And

88
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:35,720
apparently this thing has moved from my chest down to my head.

89
00:04:35,739 --> 00:04:39,980
And so prayerfully I'll be able to get over this the next couple

90
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:42,619
of days. I'm glad I have a couple of days to rest. So thank

91
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:45,100
you for your prayers and we appreciate that so much.

92
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:48,339
Deuteronomy chapter 6 and if you will stand please with me out

93
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,420
of respect and reverence to the reading of God's holy, infallible

94
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,079
and earned inspired Word. Deuteronomy chapter 6 reading

95
00:04:54,119 --> 00:04:57,359
from the Old King James Bible. I'm going to read you can

96
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,720
follow along silently if you will please. In fact I think

97
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,119
what I'll do is I'm going to begin in verse 1 usually I start

98
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,100
in verse 4. But I'm going to begin in the very first verse of

99
00:05:05,119 --> 00:05:08,059
Deuteronomy 6. Now this was written to the children of

100
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,700
Israel. However what we're going to see here tonight in this

101
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,279
particular text has an application to us today. It has

102
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,459
an application to us as a church. It has an application to

103
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:21,459
us as individuals. And so what I'm going to read here even

104
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,160
though like I say it was written to the children of

105
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,959
Israel, the nation of Israel it has a definite application to

106
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,299
us in this period of time, in this dispensation. So beginning

107
00:05:30,339 --> 00:05:33,799
in verse 1 of chapter 6 I read this, Now these are the

108
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:36,540
commandments, the statutes and the judgments, which the Lord

109
00:05:36,579 --> 00:05:40,579
your God commanded to teach you, that ye might do them in

110
00:05:40,579 --> 00:05:44,220
the land whither you go to possess it, that thou mightest

111
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:48,160
fear the Lord thy God to keep all His statutes and His

112
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,899
commandments which I command thee, thou and thy son, and

113
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:56,200
thy sons' sons, all the days of thy life, and that thy days

114
00:05:56,239 --> 00:05:59,600
may be prolonged. Hear therefore, O Israel, and

115
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,140
observe to do it. Now it's the second time God says that

116
00:06:02,179 --> 00:06:04,220
there's something that needs to be done, you need to do it.

117
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:07,480
Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it, that it may

118
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:10,359
be well with thee. So I understand this to mean if you

119
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:13,839
don't do it it's not going to be well with you. See obedience

120
00:06:13,859 --> 00:06:17,799
is an important thing. Amen, would you agree with that? So

121
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:19,940
hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it, that it may

122
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:23,040
be well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily as the

123
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:26,279
Lord God of thy fathers hath promised thee in the land that

124
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:30,380
floweth with milk and honey. Verse 4, Hear O Israel, the

125
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:33,220
Lord our God is one Lord, and of course that's the doctrine

126
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:37,220
of monotheism. Verse 5, Now listen to this I want you to

127
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:42,019
see this, And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine

128
00:06:42,059 --> 00:06:47,959
heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might. And

129
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,459
these words which I commanded this day shall be in thine

130
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,100
heart. And thou shalt teach them diligently, by the way

131
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:58,339
enthusiastically, fervently. And thou shalt teach them

132
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:01,440
diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when

133
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,739
thou sittest in thine house, when thou walkest by the way,

134
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:11,339
when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. And thou

135
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:14,480
shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they

136
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:17,079
shall be as frontless between thine eyes. And thou shalt

137
00:07:17,119 --> 00:07:20,679
write them upon the post of thy house, and on thy gates.

138
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,059
Father, we thank you now for the reading of your precious

139
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:26,019
Word, as your blessing now to the preaching of your Word

140
00:07:26,059 --> 00:07:28,320
over the next several minutes. Now, God I need your help

141
00:07:28,359 --> 00:07:31,359
tonight, so please help me. I am a needy preacher, and I

142
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:33,660
cannot do this except you help me and strengthen me this

143
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:37,059
evening. So, I pray for your hand upon me as I attempt to

144
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,899
rightly divide the Word of truth. So, God meet with us

145
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,299
now, speak to us afresh tonight, and we'll thank you

146
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,640
for it. In Jesus' name and for His sake, amen. Thank you,

147
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,140
may you be seated. When I look at this passage of

148
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,640
Scripture one of the things that I see is this, God does

149
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:56,040
not want us to be half-hearted Christians. Now, I'm going

150
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:58,040
to say this tonight as I get started, I see a lot of

151
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:02,380
half-heartedness many times amongst God's people. Now,

152
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,700
God wants us to worship Him with the whole heart. He

153
00:08:04,739 --> 00:08:07,739
doesn't want us to be a half-hearted people. He

154
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:11,079
doesn't want to worship Him in a half-hearted way. And I

155
00:08:11,119 --> 00:08:13,119
really love what he says here in this passage of

156
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:15,279
Scripture how wonderful it is, and how practical it is as

157
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,160
well when you read down through this. And it makes it

158
00:08:18,179 --> 00:08:20,920
very personal when he says, "...and now shalt love the

159
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:23,000
Lord thy God with," what does it say? "...with all thine

160
00:08:23,019 --> 00:08:28,459
heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might." With

161
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,559
every fiber of being, everything that is within us

162
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:33,419
we ought to be loving the Lord. With all our heart, all

163
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:37,119
our soul, all our might. And that's what God says. And you

164
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:39,119
know the Christian that's not living that way is really

165
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:44,260
living a pretty miserable life. Wouldn't you think? But

166
00:08:44,299 --> 00:08:46,299
yet we see an awful lot of half-hearted Christianity

167
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:49,299
today. Now, I like to go into churches sometimes just

168
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:53,340
watch people. By the way let me say this, I like airports.

169
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:56,739
I really do, I enjoy airports. Now, I don't like

170
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,320
traveling, but I will say that I enjoy airports. You know

171
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:04,440
why? Because I'm an embedded people watcher. So, I like to

172
00:09:04,479 --> 00:09:07,179
watch people. So, I'll sit in airports and I'll watch

173
00:09:07,219 --> 00:09:10,719
people. You ever do that? And you say, well what's up with

174
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,119
this guy? You know I mean you try to figure out what

175
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:15,719
they're all about. You can't really do that, but I mean

176
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,760
it's kind of fun to try to think about it. You know and

177
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:21,659
you sometimes see a guy going through the airport with a

178
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:25,099
fairly attractive woman and this guy is not looking so

179
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:28,599
good. And you wonder how did they ever get together?

180
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:32,919
You know? I mean, and that's maybe not fair, maybe that's

181
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,059
not kind, but you know it's just the way you are when

182
00:09:36,099 --> 00:09:38,859
you're a people watcher. So, when I come into churches

183
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:43,140
sometimes I like to watch people. Now, certainly I'm

184
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:46,340
going to watch people when I'm preaching. Now, I'm

185
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,340
standing up here in the sacred desk where your pastor

186
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,440
stands all the time, and others that have preached

187
00:09:51,479 --> 00:09:54,919
here as well and have been extended the courtesy, the

188
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:58,280
privilege, the honor of preaching from his pulpit. And

189
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,159
I'm going to tell you what, I can see everything going

190
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:07,419
going on out here from this perch? I can see it all. And you know sometimes things show

191
00:10:07,419 --> 00:10:13,999
up on people's countenances that really sometimes disturb me. Now maybe they don't like my preaching

192
00:10:13,999 --> 00:10:17,659
or something, I don't know what it is. And then there are the people who like to sleep

193
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:24,059
during the preaching. Now I know that sometimes you come from work, you're tired, or like

194
00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:28,699
in our home church we have our morning prayer meeting at quarter to nine, we have the Sunday

195
00:10:28,699 --> 00:10:33,259
school hour at 9.30, we have the church service at 10.30, it ends up at around noon, and then

196
00:10:33,259 --> 00:10:38,839
we break and then we have lunch, and Filipinos man, gotta tell you, they eat the whole thing.

197
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:43,179
And so when you're done eating we come back in for the afternoon service at 1.30 and guess

198
00:10:43,179 --> 00:10:52,139
what happens? Everybody wants to take a nap. Now I can see all that from the pulpit. And

199
00:10:52,139 --> 00:11:01,499
I found this out. Some people can sleep with their eyes open. I mean I'm serious. I mean

200
00:11:01,499 --> 00:11:08,619
you can go down there and go like this and you know it's like the elevator's at the top

201
00:11:08,619 --> 00:11:13,979
but there's nobody home on that floor. I mean it's just one of those things. And so I watch

202
00:11:13,979 --> 00:11:20,099
people all the time. One of the things I really watch for is I watch during the course of

203
00:11:20,099 --> 00:11:24,819
the congregational singing, if I'm on the platform I like to watch people sing. And

204
00:11:24,819 --> 00:11:30,879
you can really kind of tell sort of what's going on in a church. And you can really kind

205
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:34,979
of tell what's going on in an individual's life by the way they respond to the singing

206
00:11:34,979 --> 00:11:40,539
of the old hymns of the faith. Dr. Ron Comfort told the preacher boys, in fact I was in the

207
00:11:40,539 --> 00:11:45,379
class when he said it, he said this, he said, now listen, he said, you fellas, you young

208
00:11:45,379 --> 00:11:49,459
fellas, and I was glad that he said that because I was the oldest guy in the classroom when

209
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:53,459
he said it, but he said, you young fellas, he said, when you go into your revival meetings,

210
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:57,299
your first revival meetings, one of the things you need to do is you need to sit on the platform

211
00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:01,539
during your preliminaries on the first day of the revival meeting and watch the people

212
00:12:01,539 --> 00:12:05,099
sing the old hymns of the faith and you can pretty much tell what kind of crowd you're

213
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:12,139
going to preach to that week. And I found that to be true. I found out that that's a

214
00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:16,979
factual thing. You can watch people when they sing, I mean how can you sing? There is a

215
00:12:16,979 --> 00:12:21,579
fountain filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's veins. How can you sing and can it be? How

216
00:12:21,579 --> 00:12:27,019
can you sing amazing grace? How can you sing anything that we sang tonight and not experience

217
00:12:27,019 --> 00:12:34,939
the joy of the Lord? And some people just kind of, you know, we Baptists, we've learned

218
00:12:34,939 --> 00:12:40,379
all the hymns, so we just kind of sing them by rote. You know, we just kind of go through

219
00:12:40,379 --> 00:12:43,139
the motions. You know what I'm saying? I'm not saying everybody does that, so don't think

220
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:46,979
this is a blanket indictment. I'm not trying to paint this with too broad a brush. I'm

221
00:12:46,979 --> 00:12:53,459
just saying that many times it's a litmus test. So you watch people and you say, wow,

222
00:12:53,459 --> 00:13:00,019
there's something missing. Half heart of Christianity will steal the joy of the Lord right out of

223
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:06,699
your heart. You know, I've heard people say, well that brother over there, man he stole

224
00:13:06,699 --> 00:13:13,179
my joy. Nobody can steal your joy. You've got to give it up. You've got to give it up.

225
00:13:13,179 --> 00:13:17,859
No one can take your joy from you. You have got to surrender it. And if you're living

226
00:13:17,859 --> 00:13:22,859
a half heart of Christian life, which is again a terrible way to live your life, if you're

227
00:13:22,859 --> 00:13:27,299
living a half heart of Christian life, I'm going to tell you right now, you're not going

228
00:13:27,299 --> 00:13:30,379
to enjoy being in the house of God. You're not going to enjoy singing the old hymns of

229
00:13:30,379 --> 00:13:33,619
the faith. You're not going to enjoy the preaching of the Word of God. You're not going to enjoy

230
00:13:33,619 --> 00:13:39,179
the fellowship of God's people because you're half hearted. Can you imagine serving the

231
00:13:39,179 --> 00:13:44,699
Lord with a half a heart? I mean, I would not, I'll tell you this right now, there's

232
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:49,139
been times, I've only said this, I've only done this twice. In my ministry over the years,

233
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:54,059
especially when I pastored, I told our people this. I said, let me tell you what. I said,

234
00:13:54,059 --> 00:13:58,419
if I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that I am not going into the pulpit filled with

235
00:13:58,419 --> 00:14:03,819
the Spirit of God, I'm not preaching. So if I get up one night and I say I'm not preaching

236
00:14:03,819 --> 00:14:07,259
tonight because I do not believe that I'm filled with the Spirit of God tonight for

237
00:14:07,259 --> 00:14:11,379
whatever reason it is, and I've only had that happen twice in my ministry, and then we have

238
00:14:11,379 --> 00:14:18,379
a prayer meeting. And, you know, I kind of felt half hearted sometimes. And God convicted

239
00:14:18,379 --> 00:14:23,739
me of that. I don't want to be a half hearted preacher. I don't want to be a half hearted

240
00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:30,739
soul winner. Amen? Hey, listen, I don't want to be a half hearted husband. I'm invested

241
00:14:32,059 --> 00:14:37,099
in this relationship. I mean, we've been, we're going on 59 years. I mean, there's an

242
00:14:37,099 --> 00:14:41,379
investment here. We've been husband and wife all these years, and I don't want to be a

243
00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:46,139
half hearted husband. Because the Word of God says that I'm to love my wife as Christ

244
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:52,179
also loved the church and gave himself for it. That requires that I give my all to her.

245
00:14:52,179 --> 00:14:57,579
And I have to, my heart should be in my marriage, and in my home, and in my family. So half

246
00:14:57,579 --> 00:15:04,339
hearted Christianity is definitely a downer. And I see too much of it today. You know where

247
00:15:04,339 --> 00:15:08,979
I saw some real wholehearted Christians was in the Philippines. Every time I, you go into

248
00:15:08,979 --> 00:15:13,979
a Filipino church in the Philippine islands, there's 743 islands there. We're seeing independent

249
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:18,539
Baptist churches planted all over that country of 100 million people now. Bible college is

250
00:15:18,539 --> 00:15:22,899
being started. Bible Institute is being started. Missionaries are being sent all over the world.

251
00:15:22,899 --> 00:15:26,459
They say within the next five to seven years, it'll be the number one missionary sending

252
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:31,899
nation on the face of the earth. And I mentioned it the other day, you can find Filipinos everywhere.

253
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:37,859
Now I know it's part of their culture. They're just a happy people. Amen. They're just a

254
00:15:37,859 --> 00:15:41,379
happy people. But I tell you what, when they come to church, man, they come to church all

255
00:15:41,379 --> 00:15:47,659
in. And here's a message that I preached years ago, and I haven't preached it for a while.

256
00:15:47,659 --> 00:15:50,819
Maybe they're all in or they're all out. There just doesn't seem to be anything in

257
00:15:50,819 --> 00:15:56,819
the middle. You know, when people get lackadaisical, they get lethargic, they get apathetic, and

258
00:15:56,819 --> 00:16:01,859
they just kind of go through the motions. And a guy told me one time, he said, oh, you

259
00:16:01,859 --> 00:16:06,619
know what? I come to church, he said, I hear you preach, but I've heard all that before.

260
00:16:06,619 --> 00:16:09,579
I said, oh really? He said, yeah, I've heard all that before. I know everything you said

261
00:16:09,579 --> 00:16:12,659
today. The message you just preached, he said, I've heard that all, I don't know how many

262
00:16:12,659 --> 00:16:18,059
times I've heard that. And I said, well, you need to hear it again. You didn't get

263
00:16:18,059 --> 00:16:22,939
it the first time. You didn't get it the second or third time. And now you're telling me you've

264
00:16:22,939 --> 00:16:26,699
heard all this before. Okay, well, if you've heard all this before, then my question for

265
00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:31,419
you is what are you doing with it? What are you doing with it? Unto whom much is given

266
00:16:31,419 --> 00:16:36,859
much is required. So listen, when God spreads a table for us in the wilderness, and we live

267
00:16:36,859 --> 00:16:41,299
in a wilderness today, friends, you know that's through a spiritual vacuum in this country.

268
00:16:41,299 --> 00:16:45,859
When God spreads a table before you in the wilderness, man, it's time to come and eat

269
00:16:45,859 --> 00:16:52,339
and get everything you can get. And I'll tell you this, the worst preacher, people say,

270
00:16:52,339 --> 00:16:55,459
well, you know what? I've heard some pretty bad preachers. Well, you know what? I don't,

271
00:16:55,459 --> 00:16:59,419
I've never heard a bad preacher. If they're preaching the Word of God, they're preaching

272
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:03,979
the old book, man. I don't care if they're dynamic. I don't care if they're charismatic.

273
00:17:03,979 --> 00:17:08,619
I don't care if they've got this great personality. If they're preaching the Word of God, then

274
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:15,619
praise the Lord. Amen. Jonathan Edwards in his day, that old pilgrim, that old Reformed

275
00:17:16,539 --> 00:17:21,379
theology guy, which I'm not a Reformed theology type, but that old pilgrim, Jonathan Edwards,

276
00:17:21,379 --> 00:17:25,859
when he preached that great message, Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God, and it actually

277
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:30,419
triggered the first great awakening in America, you know what? He didn't preach like I'm preaching

278
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:37,419
right now. He read his messages. He wrote them out meticulously and he read them. And

279
00:17:37,539 --> 00:17:42,099
I heard someone say that a lot of those guys back in those days used to read those things

280
00:17:42,099 --> 00:17:49,099
in almost just a dull tone. Now, but the thing is, it was full of the Word of God. So the

281
00:17:50,979 --> 00:17:55,499
Word of God is powerful, sharper than any two-edged sword, able to divide and sunder

282
00:17:55,499 --> 00:17:59,699
both bone and marrow. Let me tell you what, the Word of God is a powerful thing. So really

283
00:17:59,699 --> 00:18:02,819
when it comes down, it's not all based upon the way the message is delivered, it's the

284
00:18:02,819 --> 00:18:09,579
message itself and what it's based on. That should stimulate God's people. And they should

285
00:18:09,579 --> 00:18:14,379
rejoice over it. You know, I mean, half-hearted Christians, they come to church in a half-hearted

286
00:18:14,379 --> 00:18:19,859
manner and they're going to end up leaving the church with a half-hearted response. Well,

287
00:18:19,859 --> 00:18:26,099
I think we should come to church excited. Don't you? Now, I'm not suggesting we come

288
00:18:26,099 --> 00:18:30,379
into church like, you know, Bozo the Clown with a fake smile on her face and get Popeye

289
00:18:30,459 --> 00:18:33,979
bug-eyed, foam in the mouth, roll down the aisles, bounce off the wall kind of happy.

290
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:38,419
I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about coming to church with a whole heart and being

291
00:18:38,419 --> 00:18:42,579
ready to receive from God whatever it is He has for us. Amen? I'll tell you what, I want

292
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:47,459
to be a whole-hearted Christian. I want to be all in. I want to be totally invested.

293
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:52,139
I want to be completely and totally absorbed with my Christian life.

294
00:18:52,139 --> 00:18:54,899
Let's go back to the book of Revelation. I'm going to move along quickly tonight, so stick

295
00:18:54,899 --> 00:18:59,059
with me if you will please. Try not to go too off-long this evening, but I do want to

296
00:18:59,059 --> 00:19:04,099
share this. I want to go to Revelation chapter 3. Is everybody with me? Revelation chapter

297
00:19:04,099 --> 00:19:10,219
3 and verse 4. Now, I could actually go through all seven churches of Asia. And of course

298
00:19:10,219 --> 00:19:16,739
this was Asia Minor where these churches were located in what's now known today as Turkey.

299
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:21,299
And of course Laodicea was the last of the seven churches. And of course we know if you

300
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:27,299
even look at it geographically the churches were organized in somewhat of a circle. And

301
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:31,299
the Bible says that the Lord Jesus at one point was standing in the midst of the seven

302
00:19:31,299 --> 00:19:35,179
churches, the seven golden candlesticks. We'll talk about that in a little bit in a minute.

303
00:19:35,179 --> 00:19:39,659
But I want you to look at Revelation chapter 3 and verse 14. And we look at the church

304
00:19:39,659 --> 00:19:43,619
of Laodicea and I'm going to read down through this very quickly and then make some comments

305
00:19:43,619 --> 00:19:48,219
along the way. By the way, Laodicea was an interesting place. I did a little bit of study

306
00:19:48,219 --> 00:19:54,659
on the city of Laodicea and it was an interesting city. It was built by Antiochus II and he

307
00:19:54,739 --> 00:20:00,099
named it after his wife, interesting name, her name was Laodice. And he named it after

308
00:20:00,099 --> 00:20:00,099


309
00:20:00,099 --> 00:20:05,659
It was located on the River Ulysses and it's still located there obviously today in what

310
00:20:05,659 --> 00:20:06,659
is now today Turkey.

311
00:20:06,659 --> 00:20:08,379
I wrote this down so I didn't forget it.

312
00:20:08,379 --> 00:20:12,419
It was rich in Greek culture, it was the center of business, the center of science, the center

313
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:15,739
of millinery, and the center of medicine.

314
00:20:15,739 --> 00:20:16,739
And it had a great reputation.

315
00:20:16,739 --> 00:20:17,979
It was a wealthy city.

316
00:20:17,979 --> 00:20:20,339
It was a wealthy place.

317
00:20:20,339 --> 00:20:23,899
And by the way, there's evidence that there were, besides the church at Laodicea, there's

318
00:20:23,899 --> 00:20:25,899
evidence there was one other there as well.

319
00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:30,099
If you go there today, you can see the ruins of both churches.

320
00:20:30,099 --> 00:20:34,699
Those churches don't exist today, but you can see the ruins of both churches.

321
00:20:34,699 --> 00:20:41,499
And so this church at Laodicea was a very wealthy, very prosperous church at one time.

322
00:20:41,499 --> 00:20:42,499
But look at this.

323
00:20:42,499 --> 00:20:46,099
In Revelation chapter 3 and verse 14, I begin reading here.

324
00:20:46,099 --> 00:20:50,139
And under the angel Angelos, this was the pastor of the church, that's what it's speaking

325
00:20:50,139 --> 00:20:53,779
of, of the Laodiceans' rite.

326
00:20:53,779 --> 00:20:54,779
These things saith the Amen.

327
00:20:54,859 --> 00:20:57,859
Now, of course, we know the Amen is Jesus.

328
00:20:57,859 --> 00:20:58,859
Amen?

329
00:20:58,859 --> 00:21:04,139
These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation

330
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:05,139
of God.

331
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:06,139
Now, look at verse 15.

332
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:07,139
He says this.

333
00:21:07,139 --> 00:21:08,739
He said, I know thy works.

334
00:21:08,739 --> 00:21:09,739
I know thy works.

335
00:21:09,739 --> 00:21:13,859
Now, that ought to either bring consolation or conviction.

336
00:21:13,859 --> 00:21:14,859
I know thy works.

337
00:21:14,859 --> 00:21:17,939
Now, I'm going to say this.

338
00:21:17,939 --> 00:21:22,619
As I get into this text here, it's not a very long text, but as I get into it and share

339
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:25,339
some things along the way, I want you to know this tonight.

340
00:21:25,339 --> 00:21:28,579
God knows our works.

341
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:30,699
He knows what we're doing and why we're doing it.

342
00:21:30,699 --> 00:21:35,659
What motivates us, what causes us to do what we do, why we do what we do.

343
00:21:35,659 --> 00:21:36,859
I ask people this all the time.

344
00:21:36,859 --> 00:21:42,099
Why do you do what you do?

345
00:21:42,099 --> 00:21:48,099
I've seen people sing in the choir, for example, and I'll ask them sometimes, I mean, I just

346
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:49,099
do this.

347
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:50,299
I kind of probe once in a while.

348
00:21:50,299 --> 00:21:52,579
I kind of have a tendency to meddle a little bit.

349
00:21:52,579 --> 00:21:56,419
And sometimes when I suspect something's not quite right with somebody that's in the choir

350
00:21:56,419 --> 00:22:02,259
or any other area of ministry, I might ask them, why are you in the choir?

351
00:22:02,259 --> 00:22:04,139
Why do you want to sing in the choir?

352
00:22:04,139 --> 00:22:05,139
Amen.

353
00:22:05,139 --> 00:22:08,939
Well, that's a good answer right there.

354
00:22:08,939 --> 00:22:11,939
Why do you want to be part of the music program in the church?

355
00:22:11,939 --> 00:22:12,939
You know?

356
00:22:12,939 --> 00:22:15,059
Well, they give a lot of different answers.

357
00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:19,399
And just like he just got done saying, our brother said, because I love singing, amen.

358
00:22:19,499 --> 00:22:23,239
And he loves singing because he loves Jesus.

359
00:22:23,239 --> 00:22:24,519
It should be for him.

360
00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:29,039
I think that people should do what they do with a whole heart.

361
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,039
Not half-hearted, just going through the motions.

362
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:32,039
Okay.

363
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:36,079
Pastor says, brother, can you help me with something this week?

364
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:37,959
In fact, would you drive a Sunday school bus for me?

365
00:22:37,959 --> 00:22:41,999
Because I know you have a class B license and we need a driver this week.

366
00:22:41,999 --> 00:22:42,999
Okay.

367
00:22:42,999 --> 00:22:46,519
I really don't like to drive buses anymore.

368
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:47,999
I kind of gave that up.

369
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:48,999
Okay.

370
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:50,599
And why do they complain and moan about it?

371
00:22:50,599 --> 00:22:51,599
Well, why?

372
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:52,599
Because they're half-hearted.

373
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:56,519
When they say, hey, pastor, great.

374
00:22:56,519 --> 00:22:58,919
I'll be glad to do that.

375
00:22:58,919 --> 00:22:59,919
I'll be glad to do it.

376
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:01,479
Oh, would you sing this?

377
00:23:01,479 --> 00:23:02,839
You have people in the church that can sing.

378
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:05,399
We just heard some great singing tonight, amen?

379
00:23:05,399 --> 00:23:09,399
And so you say, now, brothers, would you sing a special this Sunday?

380
00:23:09,399 --> 00:23:11,599
No, if I have to.

381
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:14,759
Well, that's really half-hearted, isn't it?

382
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:18,519
It's really what it is.

383
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:22,039
And that's not the way that we should respond.

384
00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:25,919
When God asks us to do something, we should be in all in and we should do it with a whole

385
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:26,919
heart.

386
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:32,439
I want to serve God with a whole heart, don't you?

387
00:23:32,439 --> 00:23:34,959
What he couldn't do this week, I couldn't do what I'm doing.

388
00:23:34,959 --> 00:23:37,399
Whatever it is God's called you to do, you couldn't do it if you weren't doing it with

389
00:23:37,399 --> 00:23:39,159
a whole heart.

390
00:23:39,159 --> 00:23:41,239
Your heart would not be in it.

391
00:23:41,239 --> 00:23:42,519
You've heard that said many times.

392
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:44,519
Well, my heart's not in it.

393
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:47,519
Well, how come?

394
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:51,439
You know, I had a fellow tell me one time, well, I think I'm going to retire from the

395
00:23:51,439 --> 00:23:52,439
ministry.

396
00:23:52,439 --> 00:23:54,359
Oh, I said, is that right?

397
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:55,359
He said, yeah.

398
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:57,159
I said, well, man, you're only 55 years old.

399
00:23:57,159 --> 00:23:58,879
Why are you going to retire from the ministry?

400
00:23:58,879 --> 00:24:03,159
Well, he said, my heart's not just in it anymore.

401
00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:05,359
And I thought, now, hold on a minute.

402
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:08,439
Did God call you to the preaching ministry?

403
00:24:08,439 --> 00:24:12,239
Did God give you the gift of pastor, evangelist, teacher?

404
00:24:12,239 --> 00:24:14,479
Did God give you that gift?

405
00:24:14,479 --> 00:24:17,399
The gifts and the calling of God are without repentance.

406
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:20,759
Well, God didn't change his mind, but obviously you have.

407
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:23,919
And now you're telling me your heart's no longer in it.

408
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:28,179
I'm going to tell you what, that's not a good answer.

409
00:24:28,179 --> 00:24:30,879
Was your heart in it when you started preaching 25 years ago?

410
00:24:30,879 --> 00:24:33,879
Well, yeah, back then it seems like my heart was in it.

411
00:24:33,879 --> 00:24:36,359
And I said, okay, well, then how come it's not in it today?

412
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:38,319
I mean, you're 55 years old.

413
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:40,079
You got some good years left in you.

414
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:41,719
You ought to keep on preaching.

415
00:24:41,719 --> 00:24:42,719
Amen.

416
00:24:42,719 --> 00:24:46,439
Now, if he doesn't want to preach and he doesn't have the heart to preach for whatever reason,

417
00:24:46,479 --> 00:24:51,399
and I think there's something wrong with that, then maybe you ought to go get a job.

418
00:24:51,399 --> 00:24:54,399
Because he'll cause damage.

419
00:24:54,399 --> 00:24:59,119
So this thing of being half-hearted, or really having like, this guy, I have no heart at

420
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:00,119
all in this thing.

421
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:03,599
I mean, that's just a dangerous proposition.

422
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:07,519
So it says, under the angel of the church that led us to your right, these things said,

423
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:11,119
the amen, the faith, and the true witness, the beginning of the creation of God, he said,

424
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:16,879
I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot.

425
00:25:16,879 --> 00:25:22,759
I would thou were cold or hot, so then because thou art lukewarm, uh-oh, thou, I want you

426
00:25:22,759 --> 00:25:25,319
to see that word, lukewarm.

427
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:27,839
That's an interesting word, isn't it?

428
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:34,759
That word, lukewarm, comes from the Greek word, ameo, ameo.

429
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:39,639
So what it means is this, the word lukewarm in the Greek, the word ameo means this, and

430
00:25:39,639 --> 00:25:43,399
by the way, it can also mean from, it also can come from this word, kleoros, and it

431
00:25:43,399 --> 00:25:47,679
means half-hearted, tepid, or fluctuating, no zeal, lost appetite.

432
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,719
He says, he said this, he said, I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot.

433
00:25:51,719 --> 00:25:55,479
I would that thou were cold or hot, so because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot,

434
00:25:55,479 --> 00:25:59,399
I will spew thee out of my mouth.

435
00:25:59,399 --> 00:26:04,719
It's like, it's like in a medic, he said, listen, because you're lukewarm and you're

436
00:26:04,719 --> 00:26:08,039
not on fire, I'd rather have you, I'd rather have a cold or hot.

437
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:12,879
Because you're lukewarm, I'll spew you out of my mouth, it makes me sick.

438
00:26:12,879 --> 00:26:14,699
Lukewarm Christianity.

439
00:26:14,699 --> 00:26:22,199
So kleoros, that's a Greek word, means half-hearted, tepid, fluctuating, no zeal, lost appetite.

440
00:26:22,199 --> 00:26:27,639
To lose one's appetite for things of God really, to me, is a disaster.

441
00:26:27,639 --> 00:26:28,639
It really is.

442
00:26:28,639 --> 00:26:32,499
So he said, so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee

443
00:26:32,499 --> 00:26:34,039
out of my mouth.

444
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:39,759
So lukewarm, kleoros, and spew, along with the word lukewarm, also, it comes from a Greek

445
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:43,039
word, it just makes me sick, he said.

446
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:45,999
Because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods, and have need of nothing, and

447
00:26:45,999 --> 00:26:50,159
knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked.

448
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:52,239
He said, Dave, we don't need anything, man.

449
00:26:52,239 --> 00:26:55,679
We got this thing down pat, we know how to do ministry, we don't need you in it either.

450
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:01,719
He said, no, you're poor, you're blind, you're wretched, you're naked.

451
00:27:01,719 --> 00:27:06,519
He said, I counsel you to buy me gold, trident and fire, that thou mayest be rich, and white

452
00:27:06,519 --> 00:27:10,039
raiment that thou mayest be clothed, that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear,

453
00:27:10,039 --> 00:27:12,919
to anoint thine eyes with eye salve that thou mayest see.

454
00:27:12,919 --> 00:27:18,519
I think that's interesting because the city of Laodicea was known for its eye salve.

455
00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:22,179
It was famous for its school of medicine.

456
00:27:22,179 --> 00:27:24,559
And so he uses that as an illustration.

457
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:29,439
But the eye salve they needed was not the eye salve that came from the apothecary, it

458
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:30,759
was the eye salve of the Word of God.

459
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:34,319
You people need to get your focus back where it belongs.

460
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:38,119
You got an eyesight problem, you need to get your eyes back on Jesus.

461
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:41,439
Get your eyes off Jesus and you're going to have a problem with half-heartedness.

462
00:27:41,439 --> 00:27:47,479
So I counsel you to buy me gold, trident and fire, that thou mayest be rich, and white

463
00:27:47,479 --> 00:27:51,039
raiment that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear,

464
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:54,159
to anoint thine eyes with eye salve that thou mayest see.

465
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:57,779
He said, as many as I love, I rebuke and chasten.

466
00:27:57,779 --> 00:27:59,119
Be zealous therefore and repent.

467
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:01,559
And I like that word zealous.

468
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:02,559
That's a good word.

469
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:03,559
Amen.

470
00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:04,559
That's a good Bible word.

471
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:10,439
And by the way, we see over in Titus chapter 2 where the Bible says that we who are saved

472
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:12,999
by the grace of God ought to be zealous of good works.

473
00:28:12,999 --> 00:28:17,039
We ought to be zealous.

474
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:20,759
We ought to be excited about this thing of serving God.

475
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:25,119
I don't know about you, but I'm excited about being here in church tonight.

476
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:27,879
I've already enjoyed myself.

477
00:28:27,879 --> 00:28:28,879
I really have.

478
00:28:29,639 --> 00:28:33,239
I can go, hey, I'll tell you what, when you come to church meetings like this, whether

479
00:28:33,239 --> 00:28:36,839
it be Sunday school or Sunday morning service, Sunday evening service, or special meetings

480
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:40,119
like we're having this week, boy, that ought to be, that ought to be a blessing.

481
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:41,119
That ought to be a joy.

482
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:43,319
That ought to send you out of here with a little bit of a bounce in your step.

483
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:46,559
Boy, I got to be with God's people tonight.

484
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,359
I got to be in church tonight.

485
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:52,000
You know, it ought to promote zeal.

486
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I've said this all the time.

487
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,759
I said, man, we just need some people to get on fire for God.

488
00:28:55,759 --> 00:29:00,719
Man, if people get on fire for God and start serving the Lord all out, we could see a lot

489
00:29:00,719 --> 00:29:04,959
of things happen in our churches today.

490
00:29:04,959 --> 00:29:07,839
We had a program years ago, I can remember it started with Sword of the Lord.

491
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:11,359
I don't remember who started it, but they had a program called Win One, Disciple One

492
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:12,359
every year.

493
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:16,479
So if you would win one person, disciple that person every year, one a year, the church

494
00:29:16,479 --> 00:29:19,279
would double its size within one year.

495
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:22,199
If people had a zeal for souls.

496
00:29:22,199 --> 00:29:24,639
If people had a zeal for winning people to Christ.

497
00:29:25,399 --> 00:29:27,319
They'd be zealous of good works.

498
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:28,319
Amen?

499
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:31,479
I think that's a, it's just a joy to be zealous.

500
00:29:31,479 --> 00:29:34,599
I mean, think about the opposite.

501
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:40,679
You know, being, you know, kind of dead, you know.

502
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:46,919
Several years ago, there was a pastor who began to realize that his church was just

503
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:49,319
kind of spiritually sagging.

504
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:51,839
It was in really bad shape.

505
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:55,199
And he knew they needed a revival.

506
00:29:55,199 --> 00:29:59,319
And he had preached his heart out and he wasn't altogether sure exactly what it was going

507
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:00,159
to take to get there.

508
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:03,859
attention. So one Sunday morning he came into church and in his

509
00:30:03,899 --> 00:30:06,559
morning message he said, oh, by the way I want to announce

510
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:10,399
we're going to have a funeral tonight. And everybody thought

511
00:30:10,439 --> 00:30:12,699
a funeral tonight? Yeah, the evening service we have a

512
00:30:12,739 --> 00:30:16,039
funeral tonight so everybody will be here. And so everybody

513
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:18,639
left the church wondering who was the dead person? Who was

514
00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:22,119
the funeral? Who were they going to have a funeral for? So

515
00:30:22,139 --> 00:30:26,779
word got out all over town and no one knew who the deceased

516
00:30:26,819 --> 00:30:30,059
individual was and so they decided that we better come and

517
00:30:30,059 --> 00:30:34,619
see who it is. So the whole town showed up. It was standing

518
00:30:34,659 --> 00:30:38,559
room only in the church house. So when they came in the church

519
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:44,639
house there was a casket down here. Amen? Some of you may

520
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:48,939
already get this one. There's a casket down here. But the thing

521
00:30:48,979 --> 00:30:51,879
that was amazing about it is that the lid of the casket it

522
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,739
was turned around backwards so you were looking at the lid of

523
00:30:54,779 --> 00:30:57,859
the casket which was open. Ordinarily it would be the other

524
00:30:57,879 --> 00:31:01,119
way around so that when you filed past the casket you would

525
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:05,459
see the deceased. But he turned it around and so the casket

526
00:31:05,499 --> 00:31:09,259
sitting in the middle of the aisle just like this and the

527
00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:12,599
lid is up, the top is up on it and he said, now that

528
00:31:12,639 --> 00:31:15,899
everybody is here? He said, I want you all to come and just

529
00:31:15,939 --> 00:31:20,279
file past the casket and view the deceased. And so they all

530
00:31:20,299 --> 00:31:22,539
got up and they said, wow we're going to find out who this is

531
00:31:22,579 --> 00:31:26,279
now. And as they filed past the casket they looked into it and

532
00:31:26,499 --> 00:31:32,379
there was a mirror on the bottom of it. There was a mirror

533
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:36,519
on the bottom of it. And everybody saw themselves in the

534
00:31:36,539 --> 00:31:44,119
reflection. And he said this, he said, you are the deceased.

535
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:49,859
The church is dead and it needs to be revived. It needs to live

536
00:31:49,899 --> 00:31:52,259
again. It needs to be resurrected back to what it once

537
00:31:52,299 --> 00:31:54,939
was. And the zeal of the Lord needs to be back in the house

538
00:31:55,159 --> 00:31:58,859
of God. Now that was a pretty radical way of getting their

539
00:31:58,899 --> 00:32:03,099
attention, but it got their attention. And again I'm not

540
00:32:03,139 --> 00:32:05,939
saying that about this church tonight, I'm just saying this

541
00:32:05,979 --> 00:32:08,779
in a general statement that really in many churches today

542
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:14,379
we just need an awakening. We just need to be awakened. And

543
00:32:14,419 --> 00:32:16,779
we need to get back to the part to where we're not living a

544
00:32:16,819 --> 00:32:22,919
halfway Christian life. We're living all out for the Lord. So

545
00:32:22,939 --> 00:32:25,379
I thought that was a pretty good illustration. And of

546
00:32:25,399 --> 00:32:28,139
course here as we look further on the church at Laodicea we

547
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:30,879
see what ends up happening here. I'll just very quickly read

548
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:33,879
this in verse 19 it says, "'As many as I love I rebuke and

549
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,419
chasten.'" I like that. Somebody said, well you know

550
00:32:36,459 --> 00:32:37,959
what we're living in Laodicea in the period of the church

551
00:32:37,979 --> 00:32:39,879
age. Well yeah, but we can still repent and get right with

552
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:43,699
God. Amen. "'As many as I love I rebuke and chasten.'" And it

553
00:32:43,719 --> 00:32:46,159
said, "'Be zealous and repent. Behold I stand at the door and

554
00:32:46,199 --> 00:32:48,399
knock.'" That's an amazing thing. "'If any man hear my

555
00:32:48,439 --> 00:32:50,939
voice and open the door I will come in unto him and will sup

556
00:32:50,959 --> 00:32:52,639
with him and he with me.'" And of course we use that in Saul

557
00:32:52,719 --> 00:32:54,919
winning. But what Jesus is saying here is, hey listen you

558
00:32:54,959 --> 00:32:56,959
folks have locked me out of my church I want back in again.

559
00:32:56,999 --> 00:33:02,739
There he is knocking on the door, let me back in. He wants

560
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:09,379
back into his own church again. It's amazing. Psalm 86 and

561
00:33:09,399 --> 00:33:12,339
verse 12, "'I will praise the Lord my God with all my heart

562
00:33:12,379 --> 00:33:18,579
and I will glorify thy name forevermore.'" Joshua 22, 5,

563
00:33:18,619 --> 00:33:21,759
"'But take diligent he to do the commandment and the law

564
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:23,839
which Moses, the servant of the Lord, charged you to love

565
00:33:23,879 --> 00:33:26,879
the Lord your God and to walk in all His ways and to keep

566
00:33:26,919 --> 00:33:30,279
His commandments and to cleave unto Him and serve Him with

567
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:34,119
all your heart and with all your soul.'" 1 Samuel 12, 24,

568
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:37,159
"'Only fear the Lord and serve Him in truth with all your

569
00:33:37,199 --> 00:33:40,559
heart for consider how great things He hath done for you.'"

570
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:44,599
Psalm 91, "'I will praise thee O Lord with my whole heart I

571
00:33:44,639 --> 00:33:48,499
will show forth all thy marvelous works.'" Psalm 111,

572
00:33:48,639 --> 00:33:52,119
verse 1, "'Praise ye the Lord. I will praise the Lord with

573
00:33:52,139 --> 00:33:54,279
my whole heart in the assembly of the upright and in the

574
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:57,779
congregation.'" Psalm 119, 2, "'Blessed are they that keep

575
00:33:57,819 --> 00:34:01,759
His testimonies and seek Him with the whole heart.'" Psalm

576
00:34:01,779 --> 00:34:05,819
119, 10, "'With my whole heart have I sought thee O let me

577
00:34:05,859 --> 00:34:08,959
not wander from thy commandments.'" Psalm 119, 69,

578
00:34:08,999 --> 00:34:11,639
"'They are proud they have forged a lie against me but I

579
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:15,699
will keep thy precepts with my whole heart.'" Psalm 138,

580
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:18,079
verses 1 and 2, "'I will praise thee with my whole heart

581
00:34:18,099 --> 00:34:21,039
before the gods will I sing praise unto thee. I will

582
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:24,139
worship toward the Holy Temple and praise thy name for thy

583
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:26,919
loving kindness and for thy truth for thou hast magnified

584
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:31,519
thy word above all thy name.'" And what of the

585
00:34:31,559 --> 00:34:35,119
backslidden? What about the backslidden? Isaiah 1, verses

586
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:38,199
4 and 5, "'The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz which

587
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:41,159
he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of

588
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:45,139
Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah kings of Judah.'" Ah, sinful

589
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:47,639
nation of people laden with iniquity and the seed of

590
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:50,979
evildoers, children that are corruptors. "'They have

591
00:34:51,019 --> 00:34:52,879
forsaken the Lord, they have provoked the Holy One of

592
00:34:52,919 --> 00:34:57,179
Israel and in anger they are gone away backward. Why should

593
00:34:57,219 --> 00:35:00,319
you be stricken anymore? Will you revolt more and more? The

594
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:04,619
whole head is sick and the whole heart faint.'" See that's

595
00:35:04,659 --> 00:35:08,099
that principle that's the whole idea of half-heartedness.

596
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:11,639
Jeremiah chapter 3 and verse 10, "'And yet for all her

597
00:35:11,659 --> 00:35:14,599
treacherous sister Judah hath not turned unto me with her

598
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:17,059
whole heart, but faintedly saith the Lord.'" So when

599
00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:19,399
people are backslidden this is what they do, they no

600
00:35:19,439 --> 00:35:24,099
longer serve God with the whole heart. But Jeremiah 29

601
00:35:24,139 --> 00:35:27,139
verses 11-13 says this, "'For I know the thoughts that I

602
00:35:27,179 --> 00:35:29,619
think toward you, saith the Lord, thoughts of peace and

603
00:35:29,639 --> 00:35:32,479
not of evil, to give you an expected end. Then shall you

604
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:34,779
call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will

605
00:35:34,819 --> 00:35:37,219
hearken unto you. And ye shall seek me and find me, when

606
00:35:37,259 --> 00:35:43,199
ye shall search for me with all your heart.'" Amen. When

607
00:35:43,219 --> 00:35:45,559
you search for me with all your heart. What a wonderful

608
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:49,699
passage of Scripture that is. That's the cure by the way for

609
00:35:49,739 --> 00:35:52,699
half-heartedness is searching God with your whole heart.

610
00:35:52,739 --> 00:35:56,279
Pastor Stephen Becker of Regency Baptist Church in the

611
00:35:56,299 --> 00:35:59,239
Sacramento, California where he wrote this, and I preached

612
00:35:59,279 --> 00:36:02,839
for him not too long ago. He said this, he wrote this in a

613
00:36:02,879 --> 00:36:05,919
devotional he wrote for his church. He said, "'If you had

614
00:36:05,939 --> 00:36:08,059
to choose between a Christian that was cold and hardened

615
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:10,879
towards the Lord, one that was a middle of the road

616
00:36:10,899 --> 00:36:14,979
Christian, which one would you choose?' Our logic would

617
00:36:14,999 --> 00:36:17,639
certainly think that coming to church sometimes instead of

618
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:21,419
never coming is at least doing some good, right? Well I

619
00:36:21,439 --> 00:36:23,179
believe half-hearted Christianity is a battle of

620
00:36:23,219 --> 00:36:27,319
our era. This lukewarm lifestyle does more harm to

621
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:30,019
the faith than those who have completely turned away from

622
00:36:30,059 --> 00:36:34,459
the Lord. Some good is better than none, I agree. But what

623
00:36:34,499 --> 00:36:37,759
kind of an impact will this way of living make on future

624
00:36:37,879 --> 00:36:45,219
generations? That's a pregnant thought. King Amaziah was a

625
00:36:45,259 --> 00:36:49,459
half-hearted follower of the Lord. In 2 Chronicles 25.2 it

626
00:36:49,499 --> 00:36:52,299
reads this, "'And he did that which was right in the sight

627
00:36:52,339 --> 00:36:56,239
of the Lord, but not with a perfect heart. He did some

628
00:36:56,259 --> 00:36:59,399
good, but he certainly wasn't sold out on fire, dedicated

629
00:36:59,439 --> 00:37:03,379
and fervent in his service. Half is better than none, but

630
00:37:03,399 --> 00:37:05,839
in terms of what kind of future influence this will make it

631
00:37:05,959 --> 00:37:10,799
is detrimental.' There is a story of a man who wanted to

632
00:37:10,839 --> 00:37:13,299
sell his house for $2,000, you can't imagine a house for

633
00:37:13,339 --> 00:37:17,699
$2,000. Another man wanted very badly to buy it but

634
00:37:17,739 --> 00:37:21,539
couldn't afford it. After much bargaining the owner agreed to

635
00:37:21,579 --> 00:37:23,739
sell the house for half the original price with a catch

636
00:37:23,779 --> 00:37:26,879
that he would retain ownership of one small nail protruding

637
00:37:26,919 --> 00:37:30,979
from just over the door." I read that and I thought,

638
00:37:31,019 --> 00:37:34,919
what? After many years the original owner wanted the

639
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:39,839
house back, but the new owner was unwilling to sell. So,

640
00:37:39,879 --> 00:37:42,239
the first owner went out, found the carcass of a dead

641
00:37:42,279 --> 00:37:44,479
dog and hung it from the single nail he still owned.

642
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:49,719
Soon the house became unlivable and the family was

643
00:37:49,759 --> 00:37:52,519
forced to sell the house to the owner of the nail on his

644
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:56,759
terms. The moral of the story is this, give the devil just

645
00:37:56,799 --> 00:37:59,099
one small part of your life and he will make it impossible

646
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:07,559
for Christ's presence to live there. Huh? It's simple but

647
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:13,159
profound. So, the truth is this, there is no such thing

648
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:15,999
as a half-hearted Christian. You're either in or you're

649
00:38:16,039 --> 00:38:21,179
out. Pastor Becker says, surrender yourself fully to

650
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:23,839
the Lord and leave no part behind. Now that's important

651
00:38:23,879 --> 00:38:26,279
to leave no part behind. What part of us do we leave

652
00:38:26,499 --> 00:38:31,299
behind? You know, God doesn't want us to leave any part

653
00:38:31,339 --> 00:38:36,339
behind. He wants us to be in service to Him with all heart.

654
00:38:36,379 --> 00:38:44,779
And to be lukewarm is to be half-hearted. And Jesus said,

655
00:38:44,819 --> 00:38:52,519
a half-hearted Christianity makes me sick. Makes him sick

656
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:57,940
of heart. It breaks his heart when he sees that we are only

657
00:38:57,979 --> 00:39:02,079
living half way. No such thing as a half-way Christian. You

658
00:39:02,119 --> 00:39:03,979
know, I mean that's why I hear people say, well, you know

659
00:39:04,019 --> 00:39:06,179
God is kind of a half-way Christian. Listen, you're

660
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:09,559
either going to serve Him or you aren't. You're not going

661
00:39:09,579 --> 00:39:12,119
to serve Him and you're not walking the way you should.

662
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:17,059
Then the Bible says you're backslidden. Half-hearted

663
00:39:17,099 --> 00:39:20,759
Christianity is very damaging and detrimental to the cause

664
00:39:20,779 --> 00:39:24,440
of Christ. By the way, our children need to see that

665
00:39:24,479 --> 00:39:31,379
we're all in. We want our children to have a holy zeal

666
00:39:31,419 --> 00:39:34,119
for the things of God. We want them to want to live for

667
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:38,619
Jesus. If they don't see us do it then why would you be

668
00:39:38,659 --> 00:39:42,159
surprised when they don't do it? They need to see the

669
00:39:42,199 --> 00:39:47,500
sincerity of our Christianity, the zeal, the joy, the

670
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:51,079
happiness, the excitement, the enthusiasm. Not about you

671
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:56,779
but I'm just excited about being saved. You know, being

672
00:39:56,819 --> 00:40:00,119
saved to me that's an exciting thing.

673
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:03,679
I mean, you remember when you got saved?

674
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:05,279
You remember?

675
00:40:05,279 --> 00:40:11,959
You remember how excited you were?

676
00:40:11,959 --> 00:40:15,679
Someone said to me one time, oh, you Christians miss all the fun.

677
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:18,799
I said, no, the only thing I'm going to miss is going to hell.

678
00:40:18,799 --> 00:40:19,799
I don't have to go to hell.

679
00:40:19,799 --> 00:40:20,799
Amen?

680
00:40:20,799 --> 00:40:25,399
In fact, I'm not going to hell.

681
00:40:25,399 --> 00:40:31,719
Now that right there is enough to make you happy and joyful.

682
00:40:31,719 --> 00:40:36,039
People just, if someone said, well, you know what, brother, my son, it seems like people

683
00:40:36,039 --> 00:40:40,039
get saved and after about 18 months to two years, it kind of just wears off and it gets

684
00:40:40,039 --> 00:40:46,039
just, you know, just becomes the norm.

685
00:40:46,039 --> 00:40:47,039
Should never be that way.

686
00:40:47,039 --> 00:40:52,919
The longer you live, the more excited you should be.

687
00:40:52,919 --> 00:40:53,919
You know?

688
00:40:53,919 --> 00:40:59,759
The more that whole enthusiasm ought to be there, really should be.

689
00:40:59,759 --> 00:41:01,239
We don't want to be half hearted.

690
00:41:01,239 --> 00:41:08,439
Half hearted Christianity does not please the Lord.

691
00:41:08,439 --> 00:41:14,439
So David mentioned several times, I want to serve the Lord and live for him with a whole

692
00:41:14,439 --> 00:41:22,439
heart, with a whole heart, a whole heart.

693
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:29,679
I trust that God has used his word tonight to speak to you about this as he's spoken

694
00:41:29,679 --> 00:41:30,679
to me today.

695
00:41:30,679 --> 00:41:35,759
Let's all stand with our heads bowed and eyes closed tonight.

696
00:41:35,759 --> 00:41:40,359
With every head bowed and every eye closed tonight, as our sister comes to play the instrument,

697
00:41:40,359 --> 00:41:49,919
how's God spoken to you?

698
00:41:49,919 --> 00:41:50,919
Thou shalt love.

699
00:41:50,919 --> 00:41:50,919
