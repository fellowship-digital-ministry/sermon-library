WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800
came from. I mean, can you imagine that bass came out of

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.439
that guy? I mean, you know a young guy with a bass voice

00:00:08.479 --> 00:00:10.939
like that, that was amazing. What a great finish that was,

00:00:10.979 --> 00:00:13.680
amen. And I heard some of you Baptists back there tapping

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.920
your toes. Amen. Praise the Lord. I enjoyed that. I

00:00:17.959 --> 00:00:20.719
videoed that and I'm going to put it on my Facebook page so

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.420
that everybody can see the great music you folks have

00:00:24.459 --> 00:00:26.819
here. I appreciate so much your music. It's been a joy

00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:30.920
these last few days just to be able to sing the old hymns of

00:00:30.959 --> 00:00:33.819
the faith. And to have these young men tonight get up and

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.220
sing, they're really good. I'll tell you what, I think I

00:00:36.259 --> 00:00:40.060
ought to take them with me. I need some singers. You know

00:00:40.099 --> 00:00:42.740
some evangelists travel in a team and they have singers

00:00:42.759 --> 00:00:46.900
with them, several of them do. And I've never had anybody

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:49.939
travel with me to sing. Sometimes I try to sing, but

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:51.939
they always tell me, no don't sing Brother Meshon, just

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:55.020
preach, amen. But I enjoyed that tonight, it was a

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.680
blessing. Just want to let you know before I preach tonight

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.880
how much we appreciate you folks. You've been a blessing

00:00:59.919 --> 00:01:02.880
to us over the years. And it's been good to be back here

00:01:02.919 --> 00:01:06.220
again and to meet some old friends after a few years of

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.260
not having been here. And then also too we've met some new

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.459
people that have been added to the church since we were last

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.839
here. And we have really enjoyed this week together

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.940
with you. It's been a blessing to spend time with the

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:20.900
pastor and his wife and his family. We've enjoyed that as

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.580
well. And we've eaten well over there, praise the Lord.

00:01:23.699 --> 00:01:28.180
Mrs. Pastor has been feeding us well. And so we are leaving

00:01:28.199 --> 00:01:31.040
here a little heavier than we came. But that's alright

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.639
because you know it's always a blessing to be able to sit

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.779
down and enjoy a good meal and just have fellowship around

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:39.319
the table with God's people. And we've enjoyed that. Also

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.080
too I want to let you know how much we appreciate your

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.019
support of our ministry. You've been faithful and we

00:01:43.059 --> 00:01:45.860
certainly appreciate that. And by the way let me say this, I

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.620
want to commend you, you are one of the few of our

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.959
supporting churches that sends us birthday cards, and

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.879
anniversary cards, and Christmas cards. And you keep

00:01:54.919 --> 00:01:57.959
up with those events in our lives. And that means a lot to

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.919
us because many times even though we have supporting

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:04.500
churches that we love and we appreciate sometimes we don't

00:02:04.519 --> 00:02:08.160
always hear from our churches. And it's so good for us to be

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:11.240
able to hear from your church. And it means a lot, it really

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:13.600
does. We have a church up in Alaska what they do is every

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:18.539
fifth Wednesday night they come to the Wednesday night

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.740
service. And what they do is everybody in the church

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.160
writes to missionaries. And they've been doing that now for

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:26.860
several years. I think the pastor told me for at least the

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:31.300
last 25 or 30 years. And so we always get a nice card from

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:33.639
them at different events and that's always been such a joy

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:36.539
to us. So we appreciate that. And your support means a lot

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.740
to us because we couldn't stay on the road really without

00:02:38.779 --> 00:02:43.720
having some support from churches that we've known over

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:47.059
the years that we love, and they love us, and they've

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.720
helped us. And it's been a blessing because our ministry

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.000
has always been geared towards small churches. We don't

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:55.039
generally go into bigger churches. The largest church

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.179
that I think I've ever preached in was probably the weekend I

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.080
was there was about 1,500 in attendance. And I'm not used to

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:05.320
that many people. And usually I'm preaching in churches that

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.020
run between 50 and 150. And we want to help the smaller

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:11.300
churches. And we want to help the church planters. And I've

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.160
been involved in church planning. And I'm glad that

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:17.440
I've had the opportunity to do that. We planted a Spanish

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.360
speaking church in the inner city of San Diego. We started

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:24.259
that church with a Mexican national. And that work is

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.699
doing well. And we're thankful for it. I understand that we're

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.740
getting ready to plant another church out of that one. So we

00:03:29.779 --> 00:03:32.339
support that work out of our home church. I think we still

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.779
do. And so we're glad for that. And I've helped other young

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.039
men as well and try to be an encouragement to them in church

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.619
planning. So you help us to help them. And you minister to

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.360
us and it helps us to minister to others. And by the way it

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.779
helps us to put gasoline in the tank. Amen. That SUV it doesn't

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.419
go down the road without gasoline. It is not electric.

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:57.759
And it is not hybrid. It's gas engine. And even though it's a

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.860
pretty thrifty little vehicle at the same time gasoline out in

00:04:01.899 --> 00:04:05.500
our area of the world is extremely expensive. So we're

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:08.300
thankful for your support of our ministry and your partners with

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:11.279
us. And we don't take that for granted. So thank you. We

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.740
appreciate it church. God bless you for it. And we want you to

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.059
know we love you and we appreciate you. Deuteronomy

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.760
chapter 6 in your Bible tonight. Now I am not feeling well and

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.540
I've been telling you that the last couple of days. I'm not

00:04:22.559 --> 00:04:26.640
shaking hands tonight I'm just blowing my nose. So forgive me

00:04:26.679 --> 00:04:29.779
for that. I had a bad day today. I got up I guess this morning

00:04:29.799 --> 00:04:33.040
about 5.30 and I thought I'd been hit by a truck. And

00:04:33.079 --> 00:04:35.720
apparently this thing has moved from my chest down to my head.

00:04:35.739 --> 00:04:39.980
And so prayerfully I'll be able to get over this the next couple

00:04:40.019 --> 00:04:42.619
of days. I'm glad I have a couple of days to rest. So thank

00:04:42.839 --> 00:04:45.100
you for your prayers and we appreciate that so much.

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.339
Deuteronomy chapter 6 and if you will stand please with me out

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.420
of respect and reverence to the reading of God's holy, infallible

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.079
and earned inspired Word. Deuteronomy chapter 6 reading

00:04:54.119 --> 00:04:57.359
from the Old King James Bible. I'm going to read you can

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.720
follow along silently if you will please. In fact I think

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.119
what I'll do is I'm going to begin in verse 1 usually I start

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.100
in verse 4. But I'm going to begin in the very first verse of

00:05:05.119 --> 00:05:08.059
Deuteronomy 6. Now this was written to the children of

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.700
Israel. However what we're going to see here tonight in this

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.279
particular text has an application to us today. It has

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.459
an application to us as a church. It has an application to

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.459
us as individuals. And so what I'm going to read here even

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.160
though like I say it was written to the children of

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.959
Israel, the nation of Israel it has a definite application to

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.299
us in this period of time, in this dispensation. So beginning

00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:33.799
in verse 1 of chapter 6 I read this, Now these are the

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:36.540
commandments, the statutes and the judgments, which the Lord

00:05:36.579 --> 00:05:40.579
your God commanded to teach you, that ye might do them in

00:05:40.579 --> 00:05:44.220
the land whither you go to possess it, that thou mightest

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.160
fear the Lord thy God to keep all His statutes and His

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.899
commandments which I command thee, thou and thy son, and

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:56.200
thy sons' sons, all the days of thy life, and that thy days

00:05:56.239 --> 00:05:59.600
may be prolonged. Hear therefore, O Israel, and

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.140
observe to do it. Now it's the second time God says that

00:06:02.179 --> 00:06:04.220
there's something that needs to be done, you need to do it.

00:06:04.239 --> 00:06:07.480
Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it, that it may

00:06:07.519 --> 00:06:10.359
be well with thee. So I understand this to mean if you

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:13.839
don't do it it's not going to be well with you. See obedience

00:06:13.859 --> 00:06:17.799
is an important thing. Amen, would you agree with that? So

00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:19.940
hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it, that it may

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:23.040
be well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily as the

00:06:23.079 --> 00:06:26.279
Lord God of thy fathers hath promised thee in the land that

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.380
floweth with milk and honey. Verse 4, Hear O Israel, the

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:33.220
Lord our God is one Lord, and of course that's the doctrine

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:37.220
of monotheism. Verse 5, Now listen to this I want you to

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:42.019
see this, And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine

00:06:42.059 --> 00:06:47.959
heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might. And

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.459
these words which I commanded this day shall be in thine

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:54.100
heart. And thou shalt teach them diligently, by the way

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:58.339
enthusiastically, fervently. And thou shalt teach them

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:01.440
diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:04.739
thou sittest in thine house, when thou walkest by the way,

00:07:04.799 --> 00:07:11.339
when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. And thou

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:14.480
shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they

00:07:14.519 --> 00:07:17.079
shall be as frontless between thine eyes. And thou shalt

00:07:17.119 --> 00:07:20.679
write them upon the post of thy house, and on thy gates.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.059
Father, we thank you now for the reading of your precious

00:07:23.079 --> 00:07:26.019
Word, as your blessing now to the preaching of your Word

00:07:26.059 --> 00:07:28.320
over the next several minutes. Now, God I need your help

00:07:28.359 --> 00:07:31.359
tonight, so please help me. I am a needy preacher, and I

00:07:31.399 --> 00:07:33.660
cannot do this except you help me and strengthen me this

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:37.059
evening. So, I pray for your hand upon me as I attempt to

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.899
rightly divide the Word of truth. So, God meet with us

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.299
now, speak to us afresh tonight, and we'll thank you

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:45.640
for it. In Jesus' name and for His sake, amen. Thank you,

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:48.140
may you be seated. When I look at this passage of

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.640
Scripture one of the things that I see is this, God does

00:07:50.679 --> 00:07:56.040
not want us to be half-hearted Christians. Now, I'm going

00:07:56.079 --> 00:07:58.040
to say this tonight as I get started, I see a lot of

00:07:58.079 --> 00:08:02.380
half-heartedness many times amongst God's people. Now,

00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:04.700
God wants us to worship Him with the whole heart. He

00:08:04.739 --> 00:08:07.739
doesn't want us to be a half-hearted people. He

00:08:07.779 --> 00:08:11.079
doesn't want to worship Him in a half-hearted way. And I

00:08:11.119 --> 00:08:13.119
really love what he says here in this passage of

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:15.279
Scripture how wonderful it is, and how practical it is as

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:18.160
well when you read down through this. And it makes it

00:08:18.179 --> 00:08:20.920
very personal when he says, "...and now shalt love the

00:08:20.959 --> 00:08:23.000
Lord thy God with," what does it say? "...with all thine

00:08:23.019 --> 00:08:28.459
heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might." With

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.559
every fiber of being, everything that is within us

00:08:30.779 --> 00:08:33.419
we ought to be loving the Lord. With all our heart, all

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:37.119
our soul, all our might. And that's what God says. And you

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:39.119
know the Christian that's not living that way is really

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:44.260
living a pretty miserable life. Wouldn't you think? But

00:08:44.299 --> 00:08:46.299
yet we see an awful lot of half-hearted Christianity

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:49.299
today. Now, I like to go into churches sometimes just

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:53.340
watch people. By the way let me say this, I like airports.

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:56.739
I really do, I enjoy airports. Now, I don't like

00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:59.320
traveling, but I will say that I enjoy airports. You know

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:04.440
why? Because I'm an embedded people watcher. So, I like to

00:09:04.479 --> 00:09:07.179
watch people. So, I'll sit in airports and I'll watch

00:09:07.219 --> 00:09:10.719
people. You ever do that? And you say, well what's up with

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:13.119
this guy? You know I mean you try to figure out what

00:09:13.159 --> 00:09:15.719
they're all about. You can't really do that, but I mean

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:19.760
it's kind of fun to try to think about it. You know and

00:09:19.799 --> 00:09:21.659
you sometimes see a guy going through the airport with a

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:25.099
fairly attractive woman and this guy is not looking so

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:28.599
good. And you wonder how did they ever get together?

00:09:28.919 --> 00:09:32.919
You know? I mean, and that's maybe not fair, maybe that's

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:36.059
not kind, but you know it's just the way you are when

00:09:36.099 --> 00:09:38.859
you're a people watcher. So, when I come into churches

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:43.140
sometimes I like to watch people. Now, certainly I'm

00:09:43.159 --> 00:09:46.340
going to watch people when I'm preaching. Now, I'm

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:49.340
standing up here in the sacred desk where your pastor

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:51.440
stands all the time, and others that have preached

00:09:51.479 --> 00:09:54.919
here as well and have been extended the courtesy, the

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:58.280
privilege, the honor of preaching from his pulpit. And

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.159
I'm going to tell you what, I can see everything going

00:10:00.159 --> 00:10:07.419
going on out here from this perch? I can see it all. And you know sometimes things show

00:10:07.419 --> 00:10:13.999
up on people's countenances that really sometimes disturb me. Now maybe they don't like my preaching

00:10:13.999 --> 00:10:17.659
or something, I don't know what it is. And then there are the people who like to sleep

00:10:17.659 --> 00:10:24.059
during the preaching. Now I know that sometimes you come from work, you're tired, or like

00:10:24.059 --> 00:10:28.699
in our home church we have our morning prayer meeting at quarter to nine, we have the Sunday

00:10:28.699 --> 00:10:33.259
school hour at 9.30, we have the church service at 10.30, it ends up at around noon, and then

00:10:33.259 --> 00:10:38.839
we break and then we have lunch, and Filipinos man, gotta tell you, they eat the whole thing.

00:10:38.839 --> 00:10:43.179
And so when you're done eating we come back in for the afternoon service at 1.30 and guess

00:10:43.179 --> 00:10:52.139
what happens? Everybody wants to take a nap. Now I can see all that from the pulpit. And

00:10:52.139 --> 00:11:01.499
I found this out. Some people can sleep with their eyes open. I mean I'm serious. I mean

00:11:01.499 --> 00:11:08.619
you can go down there and go like this and you know it's like the elevator's at the top

00:11:08.619 --> 00:11:13.979
but there's nobody home on that floor. I mean it's just one of those things. And so I watch

00:11:13.979 --> 00:11:20.099
people all the time. One of the things I really watch for is I watch during the course of

00:11:20.099 --> 00:11:24.819
the congregational singing, if I'm on the platform I like to watch people sing. And

00:11:24.819 --> 00:11:30.879
you can really kind of tell sort of what's going on in a church. And you can really kind

00:11:30.879 --> 00:11:34.979
of tell what's going on in an individual's life by the way they respond to the singing

00:11:34.979 --> 00:11:40.539
of the old hymns of the faith. Dr. Ron Comfort told the preacher boys, in fact I was in the

00:11:40.539 --> 00:11:45.379
class when he said it, he said this, he said, now listen, he said, you fellas, you young

00:11:45.379 --> 00:11:49.459
fellas, and I was glad that he said that because I was the oldest guy in the classroom when

00:11:49.459 --> 00:11:53.459
he said it, but he said, you young fellas, he said, when you go into your revival meetings,

00:11:53.459 --> 00:11:57.299
your first revival meetings, one of the things you need to do is you need to sit on the platform

00:11:57.299 --> 00:12:01.539
during your preliminaries on the first day of the revival meeting and watch the people

00:12:01.539 --> 00:12:05.099
sing the old hymns of the faith and you can pretty much tell what kind of crowd you're

00:12:05.099 --> 00:12:12.139
going to preach to that week. And I found that to be true. I found out that that's a

00:12:12.139 --> 00:12:16.979
factual thing. You can watch people when they sing, I mean how can you sing? There is a

00:12:16.979 --> 00:12:21.579
fountain filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's veins. How can you sing and can it be? How

00:12:21.579 --> 00:12:27.019
can you sing amazing grace? How can you sing anything that we sang tonight and not experience

00:12:27.019 --> 00:12:34.939
the joy of the Lord? And some people just kind of, you know, we Baptists, we've learned

00:12:34.939 --> 00:12:40.379
all the hymns, so we just kind of sing them by rote. You know, we just kind of go through

00:12:40.379 --> 00:12:43.139
the motions. You know what I'm saying? I'm not saying everybody does that, so don't think

00:12:43.139 --> 00:12:46.979
this is a blanket indictment. I'm not trying to paint this with too broad a brush. I'm

00:12:46.979 --> 00:12:53.459
just saying that many times it's a litmus test. So you watch people and you say, wow,

00:12:53.459 --> 00:13:00.019
there's something missing. Half heart of Christianity will steal the joy of the Lord right out of

00:13:00.019 --> 00:13:06.699
your heart. You know, I've heard people say, well that brother over there, man he stole

00:13:06.699 --> 00:13:13.179
my joy. Nobody can steal your joy. You've got to give it up. You've got to give it up.

00:13:13.179 --> 00:13:17.859
No one can take your joy from you. You have got to surrender it. And if you're living

00:13:17.859 --> 00:13:22.859
a half heart of Christian life, which is again a terrible way to live your life, if you're

00:13:22.859 --> 00:13:27.299
living a half heart of Christian life, I'm going to tell you right now, you're not going

00:13:27.299 --> 00:13:30.379
to enjoy being in the house of God. You're not going to enjoy singing the old hymns of

00:13:30.379 --> 00:13:33.619
the faith. You're not going to enjoy the preaching of the Word of God. You're not going to enjoy

00:13:33.619 --> 00:13:39.179
the fellowship of God's people because you're half hearted. Can you imagine serving the

00:13:39.179 --> 00:13:44.699
Lord with a half a heart? I mean, I would not, I'll tell you this right now, there's

00:13:44.699 --> 00:13:49.139
been times, I've only said this, I've only done this twice. In my ministry over the years,

00:13:49.139 --> 00:13:54.059
especially when I pastored, I told our people this. I said, let me tell you what. I said,

00:13:54.059 --> 00:13:58.419
if I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that I am not going into the pulpit filled with

00:13:58.419 --> 00:14:03.819
the Spirit of God, I'm not preaching. So if I get up one night and I say I'm not preaching

00:14:03.819 --> 00:14:07.259
tonight because I do not believe that I'm filled with the Spirit of God tonight for

00:14:07.259 --> 00:14:11.379
whatever reason it is, and I've only had that happen twice in my ministry, and then we have

00:14:11.379 --> 00:14:18.379
a prayer meeting. And, you know, I kind of felt half hearted sometimes. And God convicted

00:14:18.379 --> 00:14:23.739
me of that. I don't want to be a half hearted preacher. I don't want to be a half hearted

00:14:23.739 --> 00:14:30.739
soul winner. Amen? Hey, listen, I don't want to be a half hearted husband. I'm invested

00:14:32.059 --> 00:14:37.099
in this relationship. I mean, we've been, we're going on 59 years. I mean, there's an

00:14:37.099 --> 00:14:41.379
investment here. We've been husband and wife all these years, and I don't want to be a

00:14:41.379 --> 00:14:46.139
half hearted husband. Because the Word of God says that I'm to love my wife as Christ

00:14:46.139 --> 00:14:52.179
also loved the church and gave himself for it. That requires that I give my all to her.

00:14:52.179 --> 00:14:57.579
And I have to, my heart should be in my marriage, and in my home, and in my family. So half

00:14:57.579 --> 00:15:04.339
hearted Christianity is definitely a downer. And I see too much of it today. You know where

00:15:04.339 --> 00:15:08.979
I saw some real wholehearted Christians was in the Philippines. Every time I, you go into

00:15:08.979 --> 00:15:13.979
a Filipino church in the Philippine islands, there's 743 islands there. We're seeing independent

00:15:13.979 --> 00:15:18.539
Baptist churches planted all over that country of 100 million people now. Bible college is

00:15:18.539 --> 00:15:22.899
being started. Bible Institute is being started. Missionaries are being sent all over the world.

00:15:22.899 --> 00:15:26.459
They say within the next five to seven years, it'll be the number one missionary sending

00:15:26.459 --> 00:15:31.899
nation on the face of the earth. And I mentioned it the other day, you can find Filipinos everywhere.

00:15:31.899 --> 00:15:37.859
Now I know it's part of their culture. They're just a happy people. Amen. They're just a

00:15:37.859 --> 00:15:41.379
happy people. But I tell you what, when they come to church, man, they come to church all

00:15:41.379 --> 00:15:47.659
in. And here's a message that I preached years ago, and I haven't preached it for a while.

00:15:47.659 --> 00:15:50.819
Maybe they're all in or they're all out. There just doesn't seem to be anything in

00:15:50.819 --> 00:15:56.819
the middle. You know, when people get lackadaisical, they get lethargic, they get apathetic, and

00:15:56.819 --> 00:16:01.859
they just kind of go through the motions. And a guy told me one time, he said, oh, you

00:16:01.859 --> 00:16:06.619
know what? I come to church, he said, I hear you preach, but I've heard all that before.

00:16:06.619 --> 00:16:09.579
I said, oh really? He said, yeah, I've heard all that before. I know everything you said

00:16:09.579 --> 00:16:12.659
today. The message you just preached, he said, I've heard that all, I don't know how many

00:16:12.659 --> 00:16:18.059
times I've heard that. And I said, well, you need to hear it again. You didn't get

00:16:18.059 --> 00:16:22.939
it the first time. You didn't get it the second or third time. And now you're telling me you've

00:16:22.939 --> 00:16:26.699
heard all this before. Okay, well, if you've heard all this before, then my question for

00:16:26.699 --> 00:16:31.419
you is what are you doing with it? What are you doing with it? Unto whom much is given

00:16:31.419 --> 00:16:36.859
much is required. So listen, when God spreads a table for us in the wilderness, and we live

00:16:36.859 --> 00:16:41.299
in a wilderness today, friends, you know that's through a spiritual vacuum in this country.

00:16:41.299 --> 00:16:45.859
When God spreads a table before you in the wilderness, man, it's time to come and eat

00:16:45.859 --> 00:16:52.339
and get everything you can get. And I'll tell you this, the worst preacher, people say,

00:16:52.339 --> 00:16:55.459
well, you know what? I've heard some pretty bad preachers. Well, you know what? I don't,

00:16:55.459 --> 00:16:59.419
I've never heard a bad preacher. If they're preaching the Word of God, they're preaching

00:16:59.419 --> 00:17:03.979
the old book, man. I don't care if they're dynamic. I don't care if they're charismatic.

00:17:03.979 --> 00:17:08.619
I don't care if they've got this great personality. If they're preaching the Word of God, then

00:17:08.619 --> 00:17:15.619
praise the Lord. Amen. Jonathan Edwards in his day, that old pilgrim, that old Reformed

00:17:16.539 --> 00:17:21.379
theology guy, which I'm not a Reformed theology type, but that old pilgrim, Jonathan Edwards,

00:17:21.379 --> 00:17:25.859
when he preached that great message, Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God, and it actually

00:17:25.859 --> 00:17:30.419
triggered the first great awakening in America, you know what? He didn't preach like I'm preaching

00:17:30.419 --> 00:17:37.419
right now. He read his messages. He wrote them out meticulously and he read them. And

00:17:37.539 --> 00:17:42.099
I heard someone say that a lot of those guys back in those days used to read those things

00:17:42.099 --> 00:17:49.099
in almost just a dull tone. Now, but the thing is, it was full of the Word of God. So the

00:17:50.979 --> 00:17:55.499
Word of God is powerful, sharper than any two-edged sword, able to divide and sunder

00:17:55.499 --> 00:17:59.699
both bone and marrow. Let me tell you what, the Word of God is a powerful thing. So really

00:17:59.699 --> 00:18:02.819
when it comes down, it's not all based upon the way the message is delivered, it's the

00:18:02.819 --> 00:18:09.579
message itself and what it's based on. That should stimulate God's people. And they should

00:18:09.579 --> 00:18:14.379
rejoice over it. You know, I mean, half-hearted Christians, they come to church in a half-hearted

00:18:14.379 --> 00:18:19.859
manner and they're going to end up leaving the church with a half-hearted response. Well,

00:18:19.859 --> 00:18:26.099
I think we should come to church excited. Don't you? Now, I'm not suggesting we come

00:18:26.099 --> 00:18:30.379
into church like, you know, Bozo the Clown with a fake smile on her face and get Popeye

00:18:30.459 --> 00:18:33.979
bug-eyed, foam in the mouth, roll down the aisles, bounce off the wall kind of happy.

00:18:33.979 --> 00:18:38.419
I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about coming to church with a whole heart and being

00:18:38.419 --> 00:18:42.579
ready to receive from God whatever it is He has for us. Amen? I'll tell you what, I want

00:18:42.579 --> 00:18:47.459
to be a whole-hearted Christian. I want to be all in. I want to be totally invested.

00:18:47.459 --> 00:18:52.139
I want to be completely and totally absorbed with my Christian life.

00:18:52.139 --> 00:18:54.899
Let's go back to the book of Revelation. I'm going to move along quickly tonight, so stick

00:18:54.899 --> 00:18:59.059
with me if you will please. Try not to go too off-long this evening, but I do want to

00:18:59.059 --> 00:19:04.099
share this. I want to go to Revelation chapter 3. Is everybody with me? Revelation chapter

00:19:04.099 --> 00:19:10.219
3 and verse 4. Now, I could actually go through all seven churches of Asia. And of course

00:19:10.219 --> 00:19:16.739
this was Asia Minor where these churches were located in what's now known today as Turkey.

00:19:16.739 --> 00:19:21.299
And of course Laodicea was the last of the seven churches. And of course we know if you

00:19:21.299 --> 00:19:27.299
even look at it geographically the churches were organized in somewhat of a circle. And

00:19:27.299 --> 00:19:31.299
the Bible says that the Lord Jesus at one point was standing in the midst of the seven

00:19:31.299 --> 00:19:35.179
churches, the seven golden candlesticks. We'll talk about that in a little bit in a minute.

00:19:35.179 --> 00:19:39.659
But I want you to look at Revelation chapter 3 and verse 14. And we look at the church

00:19:39.659 --> 00:19:43.619
of Laodicea and I'm going to read down through this very quickly and then make some comments

00:19:43.619 --> 00:19:48.219
along the way. By the way, Laodicea was an interesting place. I did a little bit of study

00:19:48.219 --> 00:19:54.659
on the city of Laodicea and it was an interesting city. It was built by Antiochus II and he

00:19:54.739 --> 00:20:00.099
named it after his wife, interesting name, her name was Laodice. And he named it after

00:20:00.099 --> 00:20:00.099


00:20:00.099 --> 00:20:05.659
It was located on the River Ulysses and it's still located there obviously today in what

00:20:05.659 --> 00:20:06.659
is now today Turkey.

00:20:06.659 --> 00:20:08.379
I wrote this down so I didn't forget it.

00:20:08.379 --> 00:20:12.419
It was rich in Greek culture, it was the center of business, the center of science, the center

00:20:12.419 --> 00:20:15.739
of millinery, and the center of medicine.

00:20:15.739 --> 00:20:16.739
And it had a great reputation.

00:20:16.739 --> 00:20:17.979
It was a wealthy city.

00:20:17.979 --> 00:20:20.339
It was a wealthy place.

00:20:20.339 --> 00:20:23.899
And by the way, there's evidence that there were, besides the church at Laodicea, there's

00:20:23.899 --> 00:20:25.899
evidence there was one other there as well.

00:20:26.299 --> 00:20:30.099
If you go there today, you can see the ruins of both churches.

00:20:30.099 --> 00:20:34.699
Those churches don't exist today, but you can see the ruins of both churches.

00:20:34.699 --> 00:20:41.499
And so this church at Laodicea was a very wealthy, very prosperous church at one time.

00:20:41.499 --> 00:20:42.499
But look at this.

00:20:42.499 --> 00:20:46.099
In Revelation chapter 3 and verse 14, I begin reading here.

00:20:46.099 --> 00:20:50.139
And under the angel Angelos, this was the pastor of the church, that's what it's speaking

00:20:50.139 --> 00:20:53.779
of, of the Laodiceans' rite.

00:20:53.779 --> 00:20:54.779
These things saith the Amen.

00:20:54.859 --> 00:20:57.859
Now, of course, we know the Amen is Jesus.

00:20:57.859 --> 00:20:58.859
Amen?

00:20:58.859 --> 00:21:04.139
These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation

00:21:04.139 --> 00:21:05.139
of God.

00:21:05.139 --> 00:21:06.139
Now, look at verse 15.

00:21:06.139 --> 00:21:07.139
He says this.

00:21:07.139 --> 00:21:08.739
He said, I know thy works.

00:21:08.739 --> 00:21:09.739
I know thy works.

00:21:09.739 --> 00:21:13.859
Now, that ought to either bring consolation or conviction.

00:21:13.859 --> 00:21:14.859
I know thy works.

00:21:14.859 --> 00:21:17.939
Now, I'm going to say this.

00:21:17.939 --> 00:21:22.619
As I get into this text here, it's not a very long text, but as I get into it and share

00:21:22.619 --> 00:21:25.339
some things along the way, I want you to know this tonight.

00:21:25.339 --> 00:21:28.579
God knows our works.

00:21:28.579 --> 00:21:30.699
He knows what we're doing and why we're doing it.

00:21:30.699 --> 00:21:35.659
What motivates us, what causes us to do what we do, why we do what we do.

00:21:35.659 --> 00:21:36.859
I ask people this all the time.

00:21:36.859 --> 00:21:42.099
Why do you do what you do?

00:21:42.099 --> 00:21:48.099
I've seen people sing in the choir, for example, and I'll ask them sometimes, I mean, I just

00:21:48.099 --> 00:21:49.099
do this.

00:21:49.099 --> 00:21:50.299
I kind of probe once in a while.

00:21:50.299 --> 00:21:52.579
I kind of have a tendency to meddle a little bit.

00:21:52.579 --> 00:21:56.419
And sometimes when I suspect something's not quite right with somebody that's in the choir

00:21:56.419 --> 00:22:02.259
or any other area of ministry, I might ask them, why are you in the choir?

00:22:02.259 --> 00:22:04.139
Why do you want to sing in the choir?

00:22:04.139 --> 00:22:05.139
Amen.

00:22:05.139 --> 00:22:08.939
Well, that's a good answer right there.

00:22:08.939 --> 00:22:11.939
Why do you want to be part of the music program in the church?

00:22:11.939 --> 00:22:12.939
You know?

00:22:12.939 --> 00:22:15.059
Well, they give a lot of different answers.

00:22:15.059 --> 00:22:19.399
And just like he just got done saying, our brother said, because I love singing, amen.

00:22:19.499 --> 00:22:23.239
And he loves singing because he loves Jesus.

00:22:23.239 --> 00:22:24.519
It should be for him.

00:22:24.519 --> 00:22:29.039
I think that people should do what they do with a whole heart.

00:22:29.039 --> 00:22:31.039
Not half-hearted, just going through the motions.

00:22:31.039 --> 00:22:32.039
Okay.

00:22:32.039 --> 00:22:36.079
Pastor says, brother, can you help me with something this week?

00:22:36.079 --> 00:22:37.959
In fact, would you drive a Sunday school bus for me?

00:22:37.959 --> 00:22:41.999
Because I know you have a class B license and we need a driver this week.

00:22:41.999 --> 00:22:42.999
Okay.

00:22:42.999 --> 00:22:46.519
I really don't like to drive buses anymore.

00:22:46.519 --> 00:22:47.999
I kind of gave that up.

00:22:47.999 --> 00:22:48.999
Okay.

00:22:49.599 --> 00:22:50.599
And why do they complain and moan about it?

00:22:50.599 --> 00:22:51.599
Well, why?

00:22:51.599 --> 00:22:52.599
Because they're half-hearted.

00:22:52.599 --> 00:22:56.519
When they say, hey, pastor, great.

00:22:56.519 --> 00:22:58.919
I'll be glad to do that.

00:22:58.919 --> 00:22:59.919
I'll be glad to do it.

00:22:59.919 --> 00:23:01.479
Oh, would you sing this?

00:23:01.479 --> 00:23:02.839
You have people in the church that can sing.

00:23:02.839 --> 00:23:05.399
We just heard some great singing tonight, amen?

00:23:05.399 --> 00:23:09.399
And so you say, now, brothers, would you sing a special this Sunday?

00:23:09.399 --> 00:23:11.599
No, if I have to.

00:23:11.599 --> 00:23:14.759
Well, that's really half-hearted, isn't it?

00:23:14.759 --> 00:23:18.519
It's really what it is.

00:23:18.519 --> 00:23:22.039
And that's not the way that we should respond.

00:23:22.039 --> 00:23:25.919
When God asks us to do something, we should be in all in and we should do it with a whole

00:23:25.919 --> 00:23:26.919
heart.

00:23:26.919 --> 00:23:32.439
I want to serve God with a whole heart, don't you?

00:23:32.439 --> 00:23:34.959
What he couldn't do this week, I couldn't do what I'm doing.

00:23:34.959 --> 00:23:37.399
Whatever it is God's called you to do, you couldn't do it if you weren't doing it with

00:23:37.399 --> 00:23:39.159
a whole heart.

00:23:39.159 --> 00:23:41.239
Your heart would not be in it.

00:23:41.239 --> 00:23:42.519
You've heard that said many times.

00:23:42.519 --> 00:23:44.519
Well, my heart's not in it.

00:23:44.519 --> 00:23:47.519
Well, how come?

00:23:47.519 --> 00:23:51.439
You know, I had a fellow tell me one time, well, I think I'm going to retire from the

00:23:51.439 --> 00:23:52.439
ministry.

00:23:52.439 --> 00:23:54.359
Oh, I said, is that right?

00:23:54.359 --> 00:23:55.359
He said, yeah.

00:23:55.359 --> 00:23:57.159
I said, well, man, you're only 55 years old.

00:23:57.159 --> 00:23:58.879
Why are you going to retire from the ministry?

00:23:58.879 --> 00:24:03.159
Well, he said, my heart's not just in it anymore.

00:24:03.159 --> 00:24:05.359
And I thought, now, hold on a minute.

00:24:05.359 --> 00:24:08.439
Did God call you to the preaching ministry?

00:24:08.439 --> 00:24:12.239
Did God give you the gift of pastor, evangelist, teacher?

00:24:12.239 --> 00:24:14.479
Did God give you that gift?

00:24:14.479 --> 00:24:17.399
The gifts and the calling of God are without repentance.

00:24:18.279 --> 00:24:20.759
Well, God didn't change his mind, but obviously you have.

00:24:20.759 --> 00:24:23.919
And now you're telling me your heart's no longer in it.

00:24:23.919 --> 00:24:28.179
I'm going to tell you what, that's not a good answer.

00:24:28.179 --> 00:24:30.879
Was your heart in it when you started preaching 25 years ago?

00:24:30.879 --> 00:24:33.879
Well, yeah, back then it seems like my heart was in it.

00:24:33.879 --> 00:24:36.359
And I said, okay, well, then how come it's not in it today?

00:24:36.359 --> 00:24:38.319
I mean, you're 55 years old.

00:24:38.319 --> 00:24:40.079
You got some good years left in you.

00:24:40.079 --> 00:24:41.719
You ought to keep on preaching.

00:24:41.719 --> 00:24:42.719
Amen.

00:24:42.719 --> 00:24:46.439
Now, if he doesn't want to preach and he doesn't have the heart to preach for whatever reason,

00:24:46.479 --> 00:24:51.399
and I think there's something wrong with that, then maybe you ought to go get a job.

00:24:51.399 --> 00:24:54.399
Because he'll cause damage.

00:24:54.399 --> 00:24:59.119
So this thing of being half-hearted, or really having like, this guy, I have no heart at

00:24:59.119 --> 00:25:00.119
all in this thing.

00:25:00.119 --> 00:25:03.599
I mean, that's just a dangerous proposition.

00:25:03.599 --> 00:25:07.519
So it says, under the angel of the church that led us to your right, these things said,

00:25:07.519 --> 00:25:11.119
the amen, the faith, and the true witness, the beginning of the creation of God, he said,

00:25:11.119 --> 00:25:16.879
I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot.

00:25:16.879 --> 00:25:22.759
I would thou were cold or hot, so then because thou art lukewarm, uh-oh, thou, I want you

00:25:22.759 --> 00:25:25.319
to see that word, lukewarm.

00:25:25.319 --> 00:25:27.839
That's an interesting word, isn't it?

00:25:27.839 --> 00:25:34.759
That word, lukewarm, comes from the Greek word, ameo, ameo.

00:25:34.759 --> 00:25:39.639
So what it means is this, the word lukewarm in the Greek, the word ameo means this, and

00:25:39.639 --> 00:25:43.399
by the way, it can also mean from, it also can come from this word, kleoros, and it

00:25:43.399 --> 00:25:47.679
means half-hearted, tepid, or fluctuating, no zeal, lost appetite.

00:25:47.679 --> 00:25:51.719
He says, he said this, he said, I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot.

00:25:51.719 --> 00:25:55.479
I would that thou were cold or hot, so because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot,

00:25:55.479 --> 00:25:59.399
I will spew thee out of my mouth.

00:25:59.399 --> 00:26:04.719
It's like, it's like in a medic, he said, listen, because you're lukewarm and you're

00:26:04.719 --> 00:26:08.039
not on fire, I'd rather have you, I'd rather have a cold or hot.

00:26:08.039 --> 00:26:12.879
Because you're lukewarm, I'll spew you out of my mouth, it makes me sick.

00:26:12.879 --> 00:26:14.699
Lukewarm Christianity.

00:26:14.699 --> 00:26:22.199
So kleoros, that's a Greek word, means half-hearted, tepid, fluctuating, no zeal, lost appetite.

00:26:22.199 --> 00:26:27.639
To lose one's appetite for things of God really, to me, is a disaster.

00:26:27.639 --> 00:26:28.639
It really is.

00:26:28.639 --> 00:26:32.499
So he said, so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee

00:26:32.499 --> 00:26:34.039
out of my mouth.

00:26:34.039 --> 00:26:39.759
So lukewarm, kleoros, and spew, along with the word lukewarm, also, it comes from a Greek

00:26:39.759 --> 00:26:43.039
word, it just makes me sick, he said.

00:26:43.039 --> 00:26:45.999
Because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods, and have need of nothing, and

00:26:45.999 --> 00:26:50.159
knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked.

00:26:50.159 --> 00:26:52.239
He said, Dave, we don't need anything, man.

00:26:52.239 --> 00:26:55.679
We got this thing down pat, we know how to do ministry, we don't need you in it either.

00:26:55.679 --> 00:27:01.719
He said, no, you're poor, you're blind, you're wretched, you're naked.

00:27:01.719 --> 00:27:06.519
He said, I counsel you to buy me gold, trident and fire, that thou mayest be rich, and white

00:27:06.519 --> 00:27:10.039
raiment that thou mayest be clothed, that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear,

00:27:10.039 --> 00:27:12.919
to anoint thine eyes with eye salve that thou mayest see.

00:27:12.919 --> 00:27:18.519
I think that's interesting because the city of Laodicea was known for its eye salve.

00:27:18.519 --> 00:27:22.179
It was famous for its school of medicine.

00:27:22.179 --> 00:27:24.559
And so he uses that as an illustration.

00:27:24.559 --> 00:27:29.439
But the eye salve they needed was not the eye salve that came from the apothecary, it

00:27:29.439 --> 00:27:30.759
was the eye salve of the Word of God.

00:27:30.759 --> 00:27:34.319
You people need to get your focus back where it belongs.

00:27:34.319 --> 00:27:38.119
You got an eyesight problem, you need to get your eyes back on Jesus.

00:27:38.119 --> 00:27:41.439
Get your eyes off Jesus and you're going to have a problem with half-heartedness.

00:27:41.439 --> 00:27:47.479
So I counsel you to buy me gold, trident and fire, that thou mayest be rich, and white

00:27:47.479 --> 00:27:51.039
raiment that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear,

00:27:51.039 --> 00:27:54.159
to anoint thine eyes with eye salve that thou mayest see.

00:27:54.159 --> 00:27:57.779
He said, as many as I love, I rebuke and chasten.

00:27:57.779 --> 00:27:59.119
Be zealous therefore and repent.

00:27:59.119 --> 00:28:01.559
And I like that word zealous.

00:28:01.559 --> 00:28:02.559
That's a good word.

00:28:02.559 --> 00:28:03.559
Amen.

00:28:03.559 --> 00:28:04.559
That's a good Bible word.

00:28:04.559 --> 00:28:10.439
And by the way, we see over in Titus chapter 2 where the Bible says that we who are saved

00:28:10.439 --> 00:28:12.999
by the grace of God ought to be zealous of good works.

00:28:12.999 --> 00:28:17.039
We ought to be zealous.

00:28:17.039 --> 00:28:20.759
We ought to be excited about this thing of serving God.

00:28:20.759 --> 00:28:25.119
I don't know about you, but I'm excited about being here in church tonight.

00:28:25.119 --> 00:28:27.879
I've already enjoyed myself.

00:28:27.879 --> 00:28:28.879
I really have.

00:28:29.639 --> 00:28:33.239
I can go, hey, I'll tell you what, when you come to church meetings like this, whether

00:28:33.239 --> 00:28:36.839
it be Sunday school or Sunday morning service, Sunday evening service, or special meetings

00:28:36.839 --> 00:28:40.119
like we're having this week, boy, that ought to be, that ought to be a blessing.

00:28:40.119 --> 00:28:41.119
That ought to be a joy.

00:28:41.119 --> 00:28:43.319
That ought to send you out of here with a little bit of a bounce in your step.

00:28:43.319 --> 00:28:46.559
Boy, I got to be with God's people tonight.

00:28:46.559 --> 00:28:49.359
I got to be in church tonight.

00:28:49.359 --> 00:28:52.000
You know, it ought to promote zeal.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.000
I've said this all the time.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.759
I said, man, we just need some people to get on fire for God.

00:28:55.759 --> 00:29:00.719
Man, if people get on fire for God and start serving the Lord all out, we could see a lot

00:29:00.719 --> 00:29:04.959
of things happen in our churches today.

00:29:04.959 --> 00:29:07.839
We had a program years ago, I can remember it started with Sword of the Lord.

00:29:07.839 --> 00:29:11.359
I don't remember who started it, but they had a program called Win One, Disciple One

00:29:11.359 --> 00:29:12.359
every year.

00:29:12.359 --> 00:29:16.479
So if you would win one person, disciple that person every year, one a year, the church

00:29:16.479 --> 00:29:19.279
would double its size within one year.

00:29:19.279 --> 00:29:22.199
If people had a zeal for souls.

00:29:22.199 --> 00:29:24.639
If people had a zeal for winning people to Christ.

00:29:25.399 --> 00:29:27.319
They'd be zealous of good works.

00:29:27.319 --> 00:29:28.319
Amen?

00:29:28.319 --> 00:29:31.479
I think that's a, it's just a joy to be zealous.

00:29:31.479 --> 00:29:34.599
I mean, think about the opposite.

00:29:34.599 --> 00:29:40.679
You know, being, you know, kind of dead, you know.

00:29:40.679 --> 00:29:46.919
Several years ago, there was a pastor who began to realize that his church was just

00:29:46.919 --> 00:29:49.319
kind of spiritually sagging.

00:29:49.319 --> 00:29:51.839
It was in really bad shape.

00:29:51.839 --> 00:29:55.199
And he knew they needed a revival.

00:29:55.199 --> 00:29:59.319
And he had preached his heart out and he wasn't altogether sure exactly what it was going

00:29:59.319 --> 00:30:00.159
to take to get there.

00:30:00.159 --> 00:30:03.859
attention. So one Sunday morning he came into church and in his

00:30:03.899 --> 00:30:06.559
morning message he said, oh, by the way I want to announce

00:30:06.599 --> 00:30:10.399
we're going to have a funeral tonight. And everybody thought

00:30:10.439 --> 00:30:12.699
a funeral tonight? Yeah, the evening service we have a

00:30:12.739 --> 00:30:16.039
funeral tonight so everybody will be here. And so everybody

00:30:16.079 --> 00:30:18.639
left the church wondering who was the dead person? Who was

00:30:18.679 --> 00:30:22.119
the funeral? Who were they going to have a funeral for? So

00:30:22.139 --> 00:30:26.779
word got out all over town and no one knew who the deceased

00:30:26.819 --> 00:30:30.059
individual was and so they decided that we better come and

00:30:30.059 --> 00:30:34.619
see who it is. So the whole town showed up. It was standing

00:30:34.659 --> 00:30:38.559
room only in the church house. So when they came in the church

00:30:38.599 --> 00:30:44.639
house there was a casket down here. Amen? Some of you may

00:30:44.679 --> 00:30:48.939
already get this one. There's a casket down here. But the thing

00:30:48.979 --> 00:30:51.879
that was amazing about it is that the lid of the casket it

00:30:51.919 --> 00:30:54.739
was turned around backwards so you were looking at the lid of

00:30:54.779 --> 00:30:57.859
the casket which was open. Ordinarily it would be the other

00:30:57.879 --> 00:31:01.119
way around so that when you filed past the casket you would

00:31:01.159 --> 00:31:05.459
see the deceased. But he turned it around and so the casket

00:31:05.499 --> 00:31:09.259
sitting in the middle of the aisle just like this and the

00:31:09.299 --> 00:31:12.599
lid is up, the top is up on it and he said, now that

00:31:12.639 --> 00:31:15.899
everybody is here? He said, I want you all to come and just

00:31:15.939 --> 00:31:20.279
file past the casket and view the deceased. And so they all

00:31:20.299 --> 00:31:22.539
got up and they said, wow we're going to find out who this is

00:31:22.579 --> 00:31:26.279
now. And as they filed past the casket they looked into it and

00:31:26.499 --> 00:31:32.379
there was a mirror on the bottom of it. There was a mirror

00:31:32.399 --> 00:31:36.519
on the bottom of it. And everybody saw themselves in the

00:31:36.539 --> 00:31:44.119
reflection. And he said this, he said, you are the deceased.

00:31:44.159 --> 00:31:49.859
The church is dead and it needs to be revived. It needs to live

00:31:49.899 --> 00:31:52.259
again. It needs to be resurrected back to what it once

00:31:52.299 --> 00:31:54.939
was. And the zeal of the Lord needs to be back in the house

00:31:55.159 --> 00:31:58.859
of God. Now that was a pretty radical way of getting their

00:31:58.899 --> 00:32:03.099
attention, but it got their attention. And again I'm not

00:32:03.139 --> 00:32:05.939
saying that about this church tonight, I'm just saying this

00:32:05.979 --> 00:32:08.779
in a general statement that really in many churches today

00:32:08.799 --> 00:32:14.379
we just need an awakening. We just need to be awakened. And

00:32:14.419 --> 00:32:16.779
we need to get back to the part to where we're not living a

00:32:16.819 --> 00:32:22.919
halfway Christian life. We're living all out for the Lord. So

00:32:22.939 --> 00:32:25.379
I thought that was a pretty good illustration. And of

00:32:25.399 --> 00:32:28.139
course here as we look further on the church at Laodicea we

00:32:28.179 --> 00:32:30.879
see what ends up happening here. I'll just very quickly read

00:32:30.919 --> 00:32:33.879
this in verse 19 it says, "'As many as I love I rebuke and

00:32:33.919 --> 00:32:36.419
chasten.'" I like that. Somebody said, well you know

00:32:36.459 --> 00:32:37.959
what we're living in Laodicea in the period of the church

00:32:37.979 --> 00:32:39.879
age. Well yeah, but we can still repent and get right with

00:32:39.919 --> 00:32:43.699
God. Amen. "'As many as I love I rebuke and chasten.'" And it

00:32:43.719 --> 00:32:46.159
said, "'Be zealous and repent. Behold I stand at the door and

00:32:46.199 --> 00:32:48.399
knock.'" That's an amazing thing. "'If any man hear my

00:32:48.439 --> 00:32:50.939
voice and open the door I will come in unto him and will sup

00:32:50.959 --> 00:32:52.639
with him and he with me.'" And of course we use that in Saul

00:32:52.719 --> 00:32:54.919
winning. But what Jesus is saying here is, hey listen you

00:32:54.959 --> 00:32:56.959
folks have locked me out of my church I want back in again.

00:32:56.999 --> 00:33:02.739
There he is knocking on the door, let me back in. He wants

00:33:02.759 --> 00:33:09.379
back into his own church again. It's amazing. Psalm 86 and

00:33:09.399 --> 00:33:12.339
verse 12, "'I will praise the Lord my God with all my heart

00:33:12.379 --> 00:33:18.579
and I will glorify thy name forevermore.'" Joshua 22, 5,

00:33:18.619 --> 00:33:21.759
"'But take diligent he to do the commandment and the law

00:33:21.899 --> 00:33:23.839
which Moses, the servant of the Lord, charged you to love

00:33:23.879 --> 00:33:26.879
the Lord your God and to walk in all His ways and to keep

00:33:26.919 --> 00:33:30.279
His commandments and to cleave unto Him and serve Him with

00:33:30.319 --> 00:33:34.119
all your heart and with all your soul.'" 1 Samuel 12, 24,

00:33:34.159 --> 00:33:37.159
"'Only fear the Lord and serve Him in truth with all your

00:33:37.199 --> 00:33:40.559
heart for consider how great things He hath done for you.'"

00:33:40.599 --> 00:33:44.599
Psalm 91, "'I will praise thee O Lord with my whole heart I

00:33:44.639 --> 00:33:48.499
will show forth all thy marvelous works.'" Psalm 111,

00:33:48.639 --> 00:33:52.119
verse 1, "'Praise ye the Lord. I will praise the Lord with

00:33:52.139 --> 00:33:54.279
my whole heart in the assembly of the upright and in the

00:33:54.319 --> 00:33:57.779
congregation.'" Psalm 119, 2, "'Blessed are they that keep

00:33:57.819 --> 00:34:01.759
His testimonies and seek Him with the whole heart.'" Psalm

00:34:01.779 --> 00:34:05.819
119, 10, "'With my whole heart have I sought thee O let me

00:34:05.859 --> 00:34:08.959
not wander from thy commandments.'" Psalm 119, 69,

00:34:08.999 --> 00:34:11.639
"'They are proud they have forged a lie against me but I

00:34:11.659 --> 00:34:15.699
will keep thy precepts with my whole heart.'" Psalm 138,

00:34:15.699 --> 00:34:18.079
verses 1 and 2, "'I will praise thee with my whole heart

00:34:18.099 --> 00:34:21.039
before the gods will I sing praise unto thee. I will

00:34:21.079 --> 00:34:24.139
worship toward the Holy Temple and praise thy name for thy

00:34:24.179 --> 00:34:26.919
loving kindness and for thy truth for thou hast magnified

00:34:26.939 --> 00:34:31.519
thy word above all thy name.'" And what of the

00:34:31.559 --> 00:34:35.119
backslidden? What about the backslidden? Isaiah 1, verses

00:34:35.159 --> 00:34:38.199
4 and 5, "'The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz which

00:34:38.219 --> 00:34:41.159
he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of

00:34:41.199 --> 00:34:45.139
Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah kings of Judah.'" Ah, sinful

00:34:45.139 --> 00:34:47.639
nation of people laden with iniquity and the seed of

00:34:47.679 --> 00:34:50.979
evildoers, children that are corruptors. "'They have

00:34:51.019 --> 00:34:52.879
forsaken the Lord, they have provoked the Holy One of

00:34:52.919 --> 00:34:57.179
Israel and in anger they are gone away backward. Why should

00:34:57.219 --> 00:35:00.319
you be stricken anymore? Will you revolt more and more? The

00:35:00.359 --> 00:35:04.619
whole head is sick and the whole heart faint.'" See that's

00:35:04.659 --> 00:35:08.099
that principle that's the whole idea of half-heartedness.

00:35:08.139 --> 00:35:11.639
Jeremiah chapter 3 and verse 10, "'And yet for all her

00:35:11.659 --> 00:35:14.599
treacherous sister Judah hath not turned unto me with her

00:35:14.599 --> 00:35:17.059
whole heart, but faintedly saith the Lord.'" So when

00:35:17.099 --> 00:35:19.399
people are backslidden this is what they do, they no

00:35:19.439 --> 00:35:24.099
longer serve God with the whole heart. But Jeremiah 29

00:35:24.139 --> 00:35:27.139
verses 11-13 says this, "'For I know the thoughts that I

00:35:27.179 --> 00:35:29.619
think toward you, saith the Lord, thoughts of peace and

00:35:29.639 --> 00:35:32.479
not of evil, to give you an expected end. Then shall you

00:35:32.519 --> 00:35:34.779
call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will

00:35:34.819 --> 00:35:37.219
hearken unto you. And ye shall seek me and find me, when

00:35:37.259 --> 00:35:43.199
ye shall search for me with all your heart.'" Amen. When

00:35:43.219 --> 00:35:45.559
you search for me with all your heart. What a wonderful

00:35:45.599 --> 00:35:49.699
passage of Scripture that is. That's the cure by the way for

00:35:49.739 --> 00:35:52.699
half-heartedness is searching God with your whole heart.

00:35:52.739 --> 00:35:56.279
Pastor Stephen Becker of Regency Baptist Church in the

00:35:56.299 --> 00:35:59.239
Sacramento, California where he wrote this, and I preached

00:35:59.279 --> 00:36:02.839
for him not too long ago. He said this, he wrote this in a

00:36:02.879 --> 00:36:05.919
devotional he wrote for his church. He said, "'If you had

00:36:05.939 --> 00:36:08.059
to choose between a Christian that was cold and hardened

00:36:08.079 --> 00:36:10.879
towards the Lord, one that was a middle of the road

00:36:10.899 --> 00:36:14.979
Christian, which one would you choose?' Our logic would

00:36:14.999 --> 00:36:17.639
certainly think that coming to church sometimes instead of

00:36:17.679 --> 00:36:21.419
never coming is at least doing some good, right? Well I

00:36:21.439 --> 00:36:23.179
believe half-hearted Christianity is a battle of

00:36:23.219 --> 00:36:27.319
our era. This lukewarm lifestyle does more harm to

00:36:27.359 --> 00:36:30.019
the faith than those who have completely turned away from

00:36:30.059 --> 00:36:34.459
the Lord. Some good is better than none, I agree. But what

00:36:34.499 --> 00:36:37.759
kind of an impact will this way of living make on future

00:36:37.879 --> 00:36:45.219
generations? That's a pregnant thought. King Amaziah was a

00:36:45.259 --> 00:36:49.459
half-hearted follower of the Lord. In 2 Chronicles 25.2 it

00:36:49.499 --> 00:36:52.299
reads this, "'And he did that which was right in the sight

00:36:52.339 --> 00:36:56.239
of the Lord, but not with a perfect heart. He did some

00:36:56.259 --> 00:36:59.399
good, but he certainly wasn't sold out on fire, dedicated

00:36:59.439 --> 00:37:03.379
and fervent in his service. Half is better than none, but

00:37:03.399 --> 00:37:05.839
in terms of what kind of future influence this will make it

00:37:05.959 --> 00:37:10.799
is detrimental.' There is a story of a man who wanted to

00:37:10.839 --> 00:37:13.299
sell his house for $2,000, you can't imagine a house for

00:37:13.339 --> 00:37:17.699
$2,000. Another man wanted very badly to buy it but

00:37:17.739 --> 00:37:21.539
couldn't afford it. After much bargaining the owner agreed to

00:37:21.579 --> 00:37:23.739
sell the house for half the original price with a catch

00:37:23.779 --> 00:37:26.879
that he would retain ownership of one small nail protruding

00:37:26.919 --> 00:37:30.979
from just over the door." I read that and I thought,

00:37:31.019 --> 00:37:34.919
what? After many years the original owner wanted the

00:37:35.039 --> 00:37:39.839
house back, but the new owner was unwilling to sell. So,

00:37:39.879 --> 00:37:42.239
the first owner went out, found the carcass of a dead

00:37:42.279 --> 00:37:44.479
dog and hung it from the single nail he still owned.

00:37:44.519 --> 00:37:49.719
Soon the house became unlivable and the family was

00:37:49.759 --> 00:37:52.519
forced to sell the house to the owner of the nail on his

00:37:52.559 --> 00:37:56.759
terms. The moral of the story is this, give the devil just

00:37:56.799 --> 00:37:59.099
one small part of your life and he will make it impossible

00:37:59.319 --> 00:38:07.559
for Christ's presence to live there. Huh? It's simple but

00:38:07.599 --> 00:38:13.159
profound. So, the truth is this, there is no such thing

00:38:13.199 --> 00:38:15.999
as a half-hearted Christian. You're either in or you're

00:38:16.039 --> 00:38:21.179
out. Pastor Becker says, surrender yourself fully to

00:38:21.199 --> 00:38:23.839
the Lord and leave no part behind. Now that's important

00:38:23.879 --> 00:38:26.279
to leave no part behind. What part of us do we leave

00:38:26.499 --> 00:38:31.299
behind? You know, God doesn't want us to leave any part

00:38:31.339 --> 00:38:36.339
behind. He wants us to be in service to Him with all heart.

00:38:36.379 --> 00:38:44.779
And to be lukewarm is to be half-hearted. And Jesus said,

00:38:44.819 --> 00:38:52.519
a half-hearted Christianity makes me sick. Makes him sick

00:38:52.599 --> 00:38:57.940
of heart. It breaks his heart when he sees that we are only

00:38:57.979 --> 00:39:02.079
living half way. No such thing as a half-way Christian. You

00:39:02.119 --> 00:39:03.979
know, I mean that's why I hear people say, well, you know

00:39:04.019 --> 00:39:06.179
God is kind of a half-way Christian. Listen, you're

00:39:06.219 --> 00:39:09.559
either going to serve Him or you aren't. You're not going

00:39:09.579 --> 00:39:12.119
to serve Him and you're not walking the way you should.

00:39:12.159 --> 00:39:17.059
Then the Bible says you're backslidden. Half-hearted

00:39:17.099 --> 00:39:20.759
Christianity is very damaging and detrimental to the cause

00:39:20.779 --> 00:39:24.440
of Christ. By the way, our children need to see that

00:39:24.479 --> 00:39:31.379
we're all in. We want our children to have a holy zeal

00:39:31.419 --> 00:39:34.119
for the things of God. We want them to want to live for

00:39:34.159 --> 00:39:38.619
Jesus. If they don't see us do it then why would you be

00:39:38.659 --> 00:39:42.159
surprised when they don't do it? They need to see the

00:39:42.199 --> 00:39:47.500
sincerity of our Christianity, the zeal, the joy, the

00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:51.079
happiness, the excitement, the enthusiasm. Not about you

00:39:51.119 --> 00:39:56.779
but I'm just excited about being saved. You know, being

00:39:56.819 --> 00:40:00.119
saved to me that's an exciting thing.

00:40:00.119 --> 00:40:03.679
I mean, you remember when you got saved?

00:40:03.679 --> 00:40:05.279
You remember?

00:40:05.279 --> 00:40:11.959
You remember how excited you were?

00:40:11.959 --> 00:40:15.679
Someone said to me one time, oh, you Christians miss all the fun.

00:40:15.679 --> 00:40:18.799
I said, no, the only thing I'm going to miss is going to hell.

00:40:18.799 --> 00:40:19.799
I don't have to go to hell.

00:40:19.799 --> 00:40:20.799
Amen?

00:40:20.799 --> 00:40:25.399
In fact, I'm not going to hell.

00:40:25.399 --> 00:40:31.719
Now that right there is enough to make you happy and joyful.

00:40:31.719 --> 00:40:36.039
People just, if someone said, well, you know what, brother, my son, it seems like people

00:40:36.039 --> 00:40:40.039
get saved and after about 18 months to two years, it kind of just wears off and it gets

00:40:40.039 --> 00:40:46.039
just, you know, just becomes the norm.

00:40:46.039 --> 00:40:47.039
Should never be that way.

00:40:47.039 --> 00:40:52.919
The longer you live, the more excited you should be.

00:40:52.919 --> 00:40:53.919
You know?

00:40:53.919 --> 00:40:59.759
The more that whole enthusiasm ought to be there, really should be.

00:40:59.759 --> 00:41:01.239
We don't want to be half hearted.

00:41:01.239 --> 00:41:08.439
Half hearted Christianity does not please the Lord.

00:41:08.439 --> 00:41:14.439
So David mentioned several times, I want to serve the Lord and live for him with a whole

00:41:14.439 --> 00:41:22.439
heart, with a whole heart, a whole heart.

00:41:23.439 --> 00:41:29.679
I trust that God has used his word tonight to speak to you about this as he's spoken

00:41:29.679 --> 00:41:30.679
to me today.

00:41:30.679 --> 00:41:35.759
Let's all stand with our heads bowed and eyes closed tonight.

00:41:35.759 --> 00:41:40.359
With every head bowed and every eye closed tonight, as our sister comes to play the instrument,

00:41:40.359 --> 00:41:49.919
how's God spoken to you?

00:41:49.919 --> 00:41:50.919
Thou shalt love.

00:41:50.919 --> 00:41:50.919
