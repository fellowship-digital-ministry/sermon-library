1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,039
the book of Micah chapter number six. We're going to look at some things in chapter number one as

2
00:00:05,039 --> 00:00:12,479
well. And so Micah chapter number six, Jonah, and then Micah. And so back there in the minor

3
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:19,440
prophets of your Bible, and what a great little book this is. Seven chapters, powerful message

4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:25,440
that God gives us here throughout this book. I've asked you to go to Micah six. I'll reference

5
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,920
part of what the Bible gives us in Micah chapter number one. In verse number one,

6
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:36,720
the Bible says this, the word of the Lord that came to Micah the Moresthi in the days of Jotham,

7
00:00:37,279 --> 00:00:46,880
Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem. Now,

8
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:53,840
verse number one is such a helpful verse for helping us to understand the timing of the book

9
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,799
that is before us. We'll be looking at chapter number six this evening. But as we look at the

10
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:05,279
first verse of this book, the Bible lays out for us the timing in which this one Micah is

11
00:01:05,279 --> 00:01:11,440
prophesying. The Bible tells us in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah. Now these are three

12
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:19,440
kings of Judah. Of course, we're very familiar with king Hezekiah. Ahaz was before him. And then

13
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:25,040
Jotham preceded Ahaz. And if you want to jot down maybe right in the beginning of your notes,

14
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,800
2 Kings chapter 15 through 20, if you really want to read about some of the things that were

15
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:36,959
happening during the time in which Micah was prophesying, that'd be a good place to go. We

16
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:41,519
don't have the time this evening to look at the entirety of those chapters over in 2 Kings,

17
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:47,120
but we find in chapters 15 through 20 that God gives us a record of those things that are

18
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:52,480
happening during the time of Micah's ministry. Now it's interesting at the end of the verse,

19
00:01:52,480 --> 00:02:00,160
the Bible says, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem. Oftentimes, as we study the

20
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:04,160
prophets, whether they be the major prophets or the minor prophets, we have the opportunity

21
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:09,679
really to see how they have a ministry particularly to either Israel or to Judah.

22
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:16,559
And we find that the Bible says here concerning Samaria and Jerusalem. Samaria is the city that

23
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,800
really is the capital of Israel, the tribes of the north. We've mentioned many times throughout

24
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:30,639
our study of the lives of Elijah and Elisha, the reference to Samaria, often a place in which

25
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:35,600
there was many references during their ministries. And of course, Jerusalem we're very familiar with

26
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:42,399
is the capital of Judah. As we begin to think about these truths that are laid out for us in

27
00:02:42,399 --> 00:02:48,000
chapter number one, we find that the Bible references the kings of Judah, not the kings of

28
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Israel. However, as we would look at the prophecy and we see that it's concerning Samaria and

29
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,240
Jerusalem, that many of those things contained within the book of Micah definitely would have

30
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:07,440
an immediate liking to what's going on in Israel, but we understand that Judah was just like her

31
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:13,279
wicked sister. Isaiah deals with that. Micah really would have been a contemporary of Isaiah.

32
00:03:13,279 --> 00:03:18,639
Isaiah, if you read about his life and ministry, you see the interaction that he had with Hezekiah.

33
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:23,679
And of course, Micah's reigning as a prophet during that same period of time. And so they

34
00:03:23,679 --> 00:03:27,919
would have been contemporaries one with the other. As we come to the sixth chapter, and I know we're

35
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:32,639
kind of not studying the entire book of Micah, but I want to focus in here on a passage of

36
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:37,440
Scripture here in Micah 6, verses one through eight. As we look at this passage of Scripture,

37
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,839
I'm going to read verse number eight, share with you the title, and then we'll get into the message

38
00:03:41,839 --> 00:03:48,399
this evening. The Bible says this, He hath showed thee, O man, what is good, and what doth the Lord

39
00:03:48,399 --> 00:03:56,639
require of thee, but to do justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God. I've simply

40
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:04,000
entitled the message this evening, what doth the Lord require of thee? We see that phrase in verse

41
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,240
number eight, what doth the Lord require of thee? We'll be looking at Micah 6, one through eight.

42
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:13,600
As the children of Israel were preparing to enter into the land of promise, God used Moses to prepare

43
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,519
them for the entry into the land. Of course, we study the book of Joshua, and we studied the book

44
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,880
of Joshua this year during the pandemic through those lessons that we titled, Journeying Through

45
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,519
Joshua. And as we took our journey through Joshua, in the beginning of those messages, we

46
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:33,440
dealt much with the preparation of Moses, how God would use Moses to prepare not only Joshua, but

47
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,440
the children of Israel, and the messages that are contained within the book of Deuteronomy.

48
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,559
What's interesting that in Deuteronomy chapter number 10, and really you could read the entirety

49
00:04:42,559 --> 00:04:48,399
of the tenth chapter and even the next several chapters, but I want to just reference Deuteronomy

50
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:54,320
10 verses 12 and 13. Here's what is said to the children of Israel as they're preparing to enter

51
00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:01,519
into the land of promise. And now Israel, what doth the Lord thy God require of thee? Sound familiar?

52
00:05:02,559 --> 00:05:06,480
We see it in Micah, right? We just read it there in verse number eight of chapter six.

53
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:12,720
What doth the Lord require of thee but to fear the Lord thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love

54
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,559
him, and to serve the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy soul, to keep the commandments

55
00:05:18,559 --> 00:05:24,559
of the Lord and his statutes which I commanded thee this day for thy good? Again, we could continue

56
00:05:24,559 --> 00:05:28,320
looking through the next several chapters of the book of Deuteronomy and see many references as to

57
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,359
what it was that Moses was encouraging the children of Israel to do, how they were to live as they

58
00:05:33,359 --> 00:05:38,799
would prepare for entering into the land of promise. It's interesting as you read the book of Ecclesiastes,

59
00:05:38,799 --> 00:05:44,959
Solomon is writing concerning those things under the sun. And it's a particular perspective that

60
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:49,760
Solomon has in writing the book of Ecclesiastes, and it's important for us to understand his

61
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:54,480
perspective. But I will say this, that when he gets to the end, remember one of the themes, one of the

62
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:59,440
thoughts, the phrases throughout the book of Ecclesiastes, vanity of vanities, right? It's all

63
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,799
vanity. We find that Solomon would come to the latter part of the book, and he comes to chapter

64
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:10,959
12 and verse number 13, and it says this, let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter.

65
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:22,720
Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man. We find that Moses, as he

66
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:28,160
was preparing the children of Israel for entrance into the land of promise, that he says here's what

67
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:34,720
the Lord thy God requires of thee. We find that Solomon, after he writes the book of Ecclesiastes,

68
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:40,079
of course he was a great king. Yes, he did not end his life as well as he started his life, and we

69
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:44,640
understand that. But we find that he says, let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter. He says,

70
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:50,559
this is the whole duty of man. What is it? Fear God and keep his commandments. Can I tell you,

71
00:06:50,559 --> 00:06:57,920
if you fear God, you will keep his commandments. Amen? We find that here, as we would look and come

72
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:06,160
to the book of Micah this evening, that we find that Micah reminds those to whom he is called to

73
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:12,720
minister of what the Lord required of them. Notice as we look at our text of Scripture, and we'll

74
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,880
dig into verse number eight and look at these three things particularly, but I want to give you

75
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:23,679
the essence of what's going on in this chapter. Notice as we begin in verse number one of Micah 6,

76
00:07:23,679 --> 00:07:30,480
the Bible says this, hear ye now what the Lord saith. As soon as you start with that type of an

77
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:35,200
introduction, you find that many of the prophets, they would use the terminology, thus saith the

78
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:44,160
Lord. And here Micah says, hear ye now what the Lord saith. Arise, contend thou before the mountains

79
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:52,640
and let the hills hear thy voice. Hear ye, O mountains, the Lord's controversy, and ye strong

80
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:58,959
foundations of the earth. Notice this, the end of verse number two, for the Lord hath a controversy

81
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:08,239
with his people, and he will plead with Israel, O my people, what have I done unto thee? And wherein

82
00:08:08,239 --> 00:08:15,519
have I wearied thee? Testify against me. We notice in these first few verses of chapter number six,

83
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:21,519
as this message is unfolding from Micah, that of course it's from the Lord, as we see in verse

84
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:27,440
number one, hear ye now what the Lord saith, that we're reminded here of the fact that God is laying

85
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:34,000
out for his people that he has a controversy with them, a dispute, a contention. We find that God

86
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:41,599
then goes into really looking at verses four and five of reminding the people not only what he did

87
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:48,159
for them, but why he did it. You know, often throughout the Old Testament in particular, but

88
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:53,039
certainly the truth is there for us in the New Testament, and it'll help us to see the parallels.

89
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:57,760
We find in the Old Testament, the Bible tells us often, in the message to the children of Israel,

90
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:04,239
they were to remember. Beware lest thou forget. It carries the same idea of remembering. We find that

91
00:09:04,239 --> 00:09:10,479
God would often tell them, in fact he gave them many things that would help them remember all

92
00:09:10,479 --> 00:09:16,479
that God had done for them. As New Testament believers, we find that the table before me says

93
00:09:16,479 --> 00:09:23,039
this do in remembrance of me. We find that as we observe the Lord's Supper, that we're being

94
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:29,679
reminded of what the Lord Jesus Christ did for us on the cross of Calvary. And we find that we are

95
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:34,559
given some things that we're to remember, and we find here that in verse number four, notice what

96
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:40,799
God says, for I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of

97
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:50,400
servants, and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam. O my people, remember now what Balak king

98
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:57,359
of Moab had consulted, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim unto Gilgal.

99
00:09:58,159 --> 00:09:59,919
Notice this, that ye may know

100
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:04,659
know the righteousness of the Lord."

101
00:10:04,659 --> 00:10:07,819
God is reminding His people

102
00:10:07,819 --> 00:10:09,399
of what He did for them.

103
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:10,899
It's good for us to be reminded

104
00:10:10,899 --> 00:10:13,019
of what God's done for us.

105
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:15,979
We find that as we look at the end of v. 5,

106
00:10:15,979 --> 00:10:18,059
the Bible says that you may know

107
00:10:18,059 --> 00:10:21,019
the righteousness of the Lord.

108
00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:23,799
I'm thankful that our God is righteous.

109
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:27,679
We understand that we, as saved people,

110
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:29,979
have had Christ's righteousness

111
00:10:29,979 --> 00:10:31,659
imputed upon our account

112
00:10:31,659 --> 00:10:33,439
and what a blessing that is.

113
00:10:33,439 --> 00:10:37,259
And we find that here as we look at this truth,

114
00:10:37,259 --> 00:10:40,879
the reality is that God has made known

115
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:43,939
His righteousness.

116
00:10:43,939 --> 00:10:45,779
We enter into the section here

117
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:48,279
in v. 6-7 leading up to the truth

118
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:50,879
in v. 8 that we'll examine this evening.

119
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:51,819
The Bible says,

120
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:54,239
"...wherewith shall I come before the Lord?"

121
00:10:54,239 --> 00:10:55,919
And so it's as if Israel is now

122
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:58,999
replying to that indictment, if you will,

123
00:10:58,999 --> 00:11:01,939
that God has given to His people

124
00:11:01,939 --> 00:11:04,019
the controversy, the dispute,

125
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:06,059
the contention that is mentioned.

126
00:11:06,059 --> 00:11:08,399
And now, the Bible says in v. 6,

127
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,719
"...wherewith shall I come before the Lord?

128
00:11:11,719 --> 00:11:14,239
And bow myself before the High God?

129
00:11:14,239 --> 00:11:16,479
Shall I come before Him with burnt offerings,

130
00:11:16,479 --> 00:11:18,959
with calves of a year old?"

131
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,559
You find that the answer really

132
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:21,919
that is given here

133
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:24,119
is an answer of an outward expression.

134
00:11:24,119 --> 00:11:25,479
Should I come with offerings

135
00:11:25,479 --> 00:11:27,159
or should I come with sacrifices?

136
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:28,499
You find that as you study

137
00:11:28,499 --> 00:11:29,839
some of the other prophets,

138
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,439
and you find that the people of God,

139
00:11:32,439 --> 00:11:34,399
they had brought offerings,

140
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,679
but God says, I don't want your offerings.

141
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:39,559
Why? Because your heart is far from Me.

142
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:41,799
You're just doing this outward expression.

143
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:44,359
You're just going through the motions, if you will.

144
00:11:44,359 --> 00:11:46,119
But I'm concerned about your heart.

145
00:11:46,119 --> 00:11:48,599
I want your heart.

146
00:11:48,599 --> 00:11:50,439
And they're asking about these offerings

147
00:11:50,439 --> 00:11:51,519
and these sacrifices.

148
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:52,679
Notice in v. 7,

149
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:54,359
"...will the Lord be pleased

150
00:11:54,359 --> 00:11:55,919
with thousands of rams

151
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:59,479
or with ten thousands of rivers of oil?

152
00:11:59,479 --> 00:12:03,079
Shall I give My firstborn for My transgression

153
00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:06,839
the fruit of My body for the sin of My soul?"

154
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:08,639
It's amazing how in v. 7,

155
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,159
it kind of hits them square between the eyes,

156
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:12,279
if you will.

157
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:14,519
Remember in v. 1 of Micah 1,

158
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:16,439
the Bible tells us that He was prophesying

159
00:12:16,439 --> 00:12:20,359
during the time of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah.

160
00:12:20,359 --> 00:12:22,719
The Bible tells us here in v. 7

161
00:12:22,719 --> 00:12:23,719
at the end of the verse,

162
00:12:23,719 --> 00:12:26,239
"...shall I give My firstborn for My transgression

163
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:28,639
the fruit of My body for the sin of My soul?"

164
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,719
In 2 Kings 16, again, I mentioned

165
00:12:30,719 --> 00:12:33,679
that really you'd look at chapters 15-20

166
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:35,959
in order to see the context of what's going on

167
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:38,359
during the time of Micah's ministry.

168
00:12:38,359 --> 00:12:41,479
But here in 2 Kings 16 and v. 3

169
00:12:41,479 --> 00:12:43,439
during the reign of Ahaz,

170
00:12:43,439 --> 00:12:45,759
here's how it's described.

171
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:48,399
The Bible speaks about Ahaz coming into power

172
00:12:48,439 --> 00:12:50,279
and that he did not that which was right

173
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:52,999
in the sight of the Lord his God like David his father.

174
00:12:52,999 --> 00:12:54,479
And it tells us in v. 3,

175
00:12:54,479 --> 00:12:56,319
"...but he walked in the way of the kings of Israel,

176
00:12:56,319 --> 00:13:00,279
yea, and made his son to pass through the fire

177
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:03,079
according to the abominations of the heathen

178
00:13:03,079 --> 00:13:08,079
whom the Lord cast out from before the children of Israel."

179
00:13:08,239 --> 00:13:13,239
Literally, Ahaz offered his son to Molech.

180
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:16,839
Specifically given the truth

181
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:19,599
of not performing these things,

182
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:21,879
this abomination before the Lord

183
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:24,479
in Leviticus 18 v. 21.

184
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:27,639
And we find that here,

185
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:30,199
Micah, of course, the prophet of God

186
00:13:30,199 --> 00:13:31,999
giving the word of the Lord.

187
00:13:31,999 --> 00:13:34,279
He's confronting the individuals.

188
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:36,399
He's confronting the people of God.

189
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,559
Israel and Judah.

190
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:41,679
And we find that here as we come to v. 8,

191
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:43,559
I love the way that the verse starts.

192
00:13:43,599 --> 00:13:47,039
It says, he hath showed thee.

193
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:51,319
Here's why I particularly find myself

194
00:13:51,319 --> 00:13:53,759
looking at v. 8 in those first few words.

195
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:56,999
You find this controversy that the Lord has.

196
00:13:56,999 --> 00:13:58,999
And the Lord brings Micah.

197
00:13:58,999 --> 00:14:02,039
Micah faithfully is giving this truth

198
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:04,799
to those that he's been called to minister.

199
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:08,039
And Micah says, the Lord has a controversy with you.

200
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:09,319
And it's as if the people say,

201
00:14:09,319 --> 00:14:10,839
okay, so what should we do about this?

202
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:12,799
Can we make some offerings?

203
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:13,879
Can we do some things?

204
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:16,199
Is there something we can do?

205
00:14:16,199 --> 00:14:19,199
And Micah says, he hath showed thee.

206
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,319
He hath showed thee.

207
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,639
And we find that as we understand,

208
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,159
even as we make mention today,

209
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:29,879
as New Testament believers,

210
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:32,519
having the entire whole canon,

211
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:34,719
the complete canon of Scripture,

212
00:14:34,719 --> 00:14:36,999
that we could speak to someone.

213
00:14:36,999 --> 00:14:39,079
Maybe if we want to use the illustration

214
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:41,319
this evening of salvation,

215
00:14:41,319 --> 00:14:45,199
we share with somebody that they're condemned already.

216
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:46,359
That's what the Bible teaches us

217
00:14:46,359 --> 00:14:48,119
in John 3.

218
00:14:48,119 --> 00:14:50,479
He that believeth not is condemned already.

219
00:14:50,479 --> 00:14:52,119
Someone wrote a Gospel tract.

220
00:14:52,119 --> 00:14:54,119
What is it that I have to do to go to hell?

221
00:14:54,119 --> 00:14:55,879
The answer is nothing.

222
00:14:55,879 --> 00:14:58,159
We're condemned already.

223
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:00,679
And so we bring this truth of salvation

224
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:02,759
and someone says, okay, what is it that I need to do?

225
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:03,719
Can I go to church more?

226
00:15:03,719 --> 00:15:04,639
Can I do this?

227
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,079
No, he hath already showed thee.

228
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,119
He's given us the plan of redemption.

229
00:15:08,119 --> 00:15:10,119
He's revealed to us in His Word

230
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,359
what it is that we are to do

231
00:15:12,359 --> 00:15:13,759
with regard to redemption.

232
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:15,439
We understand that.

233
00:15:15,439 --> 00:15:19,319
But we find here for these that Micah is prophesying to,

234
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:21,599
that Micah says, he hath showed thee,

235
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,279
oh man, what is good

236
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,679
and what doth the Lord require of thee?

237
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:28,559
Now we understand that this is not an exact quote

238
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:30,439
of everything that would be contained

239
00:15:30,439 --> 00:15:31,759
in the book of Deuteronomy

240
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,759
that we looked at in the 10th chapter

241
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,999
a few moments ago.

242
00:15:35,999 --> 00:15:37,999
I can't help but believe

243
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:40,679
that the recipients as they would have had

244
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:44,079
some level of knowledge of the books of Moses,

245
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,279
that when they hear that phraseology

246
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,559
of what the Lord required of them,

247
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:51,199
that perhaps there were some within the congregation

248
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,799
that would have been reminded of that truth

249
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:55,359
that was shared by Moses

250
00:15:55,359 --> 00:15:57,279
as the children of Israel would prepare

251
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,599
to enter into the land of promise.

252
00:15:59,599 --> 00:16:01,799
Remember as we've studied through the book of Deuteronomy

253
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:04,759
at various times over the years

254
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:06,719
that we found that the Bible reveals to us

255
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:10,039
that listen, the truth, it's not far off,

256
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:12,519
it's nigh unto thee.

257
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:16,879
And here God has faithfully, graciously given

258
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:21,079
a prophet to go and to share with the people.

259
00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:23,719
The Lord hath a controversy with thee.

260
00:16:23,719 --> 00:16:26,279
Notice, what is it?

261
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:28,919
He hath showed thee, oh man, what is good

262
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:31,199
and what doth the Lord require of thee?

263
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:34,519
Number one, to do justly.

264
00:16:35,479 --> 00:16:37,239
Number one, to do justly.

265
00:16:38,239 --> 00:16:39,679
The word justly carries with it

266
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:42,399
the idea of inconformity to law,

267
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,399
justice or propriety.

268
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,199
According to the truth and facts,

269
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:49,359
honestly, fairly, with integrity.

270
00:16:49,359 --> 00:16:52,639
We think about the call that is given here.

271
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,639
Number one, what is it that the Lord doth require

272
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:57,159
of thee to do justly?

273
00:16:57,159 --> 00:16:58,959
To do the right thing.

274
00:16:58,959 --> 00:16:59,959
To do right.

275
00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:03,759
In a world where so many are doing wrong.

276
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:05,919
Right?

277
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,559
You think about the nation of Israel

278
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,079
and you think about that which they've been

279
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:11,639
experienced with and of course we understand

280
00:17:11,639 --> 00:17:14,399
that even during the prophecy of Micah,

281
00:17:14,399 --> 00:17:16,119
because the Bible carries with us

282
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:19,559
the fact that it was Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah,

283
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:23,159
that's where would be the span of Micah's ministry,

284
00:17:23,159 --> 00:17:25,279
that Israel went into captivity

285
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:28,279
by the Assyrians during his ministry.

286
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:29,559
If you look at it historically,

287
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:32,999
you'll see that that's exactly what happened.

288
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,639
We find that here, as Micah would be prophesying,

289
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:38,839
he says to do justly.

290
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:41,359
You know, we speak often about those

291
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:42,399
that have gone before us

292
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:45,159
and we reference some great Bible characters

293
00:17:45,159 --> 00:17:46,839
of those that walked with God

294
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:49,319
in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation

295
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:50,959
and we understand that we're living

296
00:17:50,959 --> 00:17:52,879
in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation.

297
00:17:52,879 --> 00:17:54,599
We're living in the midst of a time

298
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:56,559
in which we find that the prophets of God

299
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:59,279
would prophesy to Israel and Judah

300
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:01,799
that they call good evil and evil good

301
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:03,559
and we understand those things,

302
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:06,159
but I'm thankful that we have the Word of God

303
00:18:06,159 --> 00:18:08,719
and that God shows us how it is

304
00:18:08,719 --> 00:18:10,079
that we can do justly,

305
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:12,959
that we can walk in a proper way.

306
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:14,039
We can do right.

307
00:18:15,879 --> 00:18:19,799
A preacher of yesteryear used to constantly say,

308
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:22,559
do right, do right.

309
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,399
And he'd have various things

310
00:18:24,399 --> 00:18:27,319
that he would attach to that statement,

311
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:30,999
but just pounding in the thought of doing right.

312
00:18:30,999 --> 00:18:32,799
But notice, the Bible says,

313
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,679
He hath showed thee, O man, what is good.

314
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,159
And what doth the Lord require of thee,

315
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:38,320
but to do justly?

316
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,919
And so as we find within context,

317
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:43,320
the Bible says that He hath showed thee, O man,

318
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,159
what is good.

319
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:45,719
Then He says to do justly.

320
00:18:45,719 --> 00:18:48,119
And so we understand that it's not doing good

321
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:51,239
based upon their own definition

322
00:18:51,239 --> 00:18:53,719
of what is good or what is just.

323
00:18:53,719 --> 00:18:55,000
See, there was a period of time

324
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,039
in the nation of Israel,

325
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:58,519
we know it as the period of the judges.

326
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:00,159
There was a time in which every man did that

327
00:19:00,159 --> 00:19:03,679
which was right, not according to God's Word,

328
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,760
but according to their own standard.

329
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,719
And we find that there no doubt

330
00:19:08,719 --> 00:19:10,959
is a time in which we're living today

331
00:19:10,959 --> 00:19:13,599
in which people say that they're doing right,

332
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:15,159
but they're their own authority,

333
00:19:15,159 --> 00:19:16,760
they're their own standard.

334
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,239
And God says here in His Word

335
00:19:19,239 --> 00:19:21,839
that He hath showed thee, O man, what is good.

336
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:23,279
And what doth the Lord require of thee,

337
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:24,959
but to do justly?

338
00:19:24,959 --> 00:19:28,159
So they were living in a very evil, corrupt time.

339
00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:30,079
In fact, if you look at some things here

340
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:31,359
within the book of Micah,

341
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:33,119
look back in chapter 3,

342
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:35,440
if you think about having some people

343
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,839
that were in places of doing just,

344
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:40,159
carrying out justice if you will,

345
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:41,919
that they were crooked.

346
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,559
The Bible tells us in Micah 3 and verse 11,

347
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,039
the heads thereof judge,

348
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:47,279
but notice what it says,

349
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:50,519
they judge for reward.

350
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:52,719
The priests thereof teach,

351
00:19:52,719 --> 00:19:55,559
but notice, they teach for hire.

352
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:57,440
The prophets thereof divine,

353
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,000
but notice, they divine for money.

354
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,360
Yet, will they lean upon the Lord and say,

355
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,719
is not the Lord among us?

356
00:20:06,719 --> 00:20:10,220
None evil can come upon us.

357
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:12,060
We find that here in v. 11,

358
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,720
that the heads thereof,

359
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,760
they were to judge, but not for reward.

360
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,639
The priests, they were to teach,

361
00:20:18,639 --> 00:20:20,520
but not for hire.

362
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,159
The prophets, they were to divine,

363
00:20:23,159 --> 00:20:25,120
but not for money.

364
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,000
We find that as we look at these verses,

365
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,360
really we could understand

366
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,559
really what is the motive?

367
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:31,719
What was the motive?

368
00:20:31,719 --> 00:20:33,680
What is it that's being dealt with here?

369
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,200
We notice in chapter 7,

370
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,279
in v. 3, it says this,

371
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:40,919
that they may do evil with both hands earnestly.

372
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:43,560
The prince asketh, and the judge asketh

373
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,360
for a reward.

374
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,720
The great man, he uttereth his mischievous desire,

375
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,159
so they wrap it up.

376
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,840
You notice that it says both the prince

377
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,319
and the judge,

378
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:58,240
that they asketh for a reward.

379
00:20:58,279 --> 00:21:00,200
It says that they may do evil

380
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,959
with both hands earnestly.

381
00:21:03,959 --> 00:21:06,480
It is God's instruction here

382
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,480
in the passage in Micah 6

383
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,360
when it's the indictment,

384
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,680
the controversy the Lord has with His people.

385
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,559
And He says, here's what you're to do.

386
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:15,440
Here's the answer.

387
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,800
Number one, do justly.

388
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,760
Do justly.

389
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:24,120
Number two, love mercy.

390
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,400
Love mercy.

391
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,080
I'm so thankful that our God is just.

392
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,120
And I'm so thankful that our God is merciful.

393
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,360
This evening, no doubt,

394
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,040
each of us have been the recipients

395
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,720
of God's mercy.

396
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,879
If you're saved this evening,

397
00:21:39,879 --> 00:21:42,480
we understand that it's not by our own works,

398
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,040
but by His mercy He hath begotten us.

399
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,040
This evening as we think about this

400
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,080
truth of loving mercy,

401
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,919
and we understand that as we look

402
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,319
at these first two points,

403
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:55,720
the important aspect of understanding

404
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,160
that these attributes that are mentioned,

405
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,959
the justice and the mercy,

406
00:21:59,959 --> 00:22:03,000
the fact that our God is a just judge,

407
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,120
that He is always doing that which is right.

408
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:11,919
Some could lay a charge against God

409
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:12,919
for doing something wrong,

410
00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:16,240
but it would not be a valid charge.

411
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,880
Our God always does that which is right.

412
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,720
Amen?

413
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,080
Always.

414
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,559
Every single time.

415
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:23,720
He's just.

416
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,000
He's righteous.

417
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,639
It's His character.

418
00:22:26,639 --> 00:22:30,119
His mercy endureth forever.

419
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:33,240
This evening I understand that I have received mercy,

420
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,399
but I wonder how often if we really think

421
00:22:35,399 --> 00:22:36,960
about this thing of loving mercy,

422
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,199
it really cares about the idea of being merciful.

423
00:22:39,199 --> 00:22:40,320
Showing mercy.

424
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,080
Showing it.

425
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,479
It's interesting in John chapter number one,

426
00:22:45,479 --> 00:22:47,360
and I know the word grace is used

427
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,240
in the passage of Scripture.

428
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,160
I want you to see that in John chapter number one,

429
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,240
the Bible speaks about this truth

430
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,520
with regard to the Lord Jesus Christ.

431
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,600
It says in verse number 14 of John one,

432
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,399
and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us.

433
00:23:02,399 --> 00:23:03,919
We beheld His glory.

434
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,399
The glory is of the only begotten of the Father,

435
00:23:06,399 --> 00:23:09,039
full of grace and truth.

436
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:12,039
Verse 17, for the law was given by Moses,

437
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:16,479
but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.

438
00:23:16,479 --> 00:23:18,639
That word grace there is a result

439
00:23:18,639 --> 00:23:20,880
of God's merciful kindness.

440
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:26,320
We find here that in Micah chapter number six,

441
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,960
he says here's what the Lord requires.

442
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,199
He's already shown this to you.

443
00:23:30,199 --> 00:23:32,080
This is what is good.

444
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,320
This is what's acceptable to God.

445
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,720
This is what He requires of me.

446
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,600
Number one, to do justly, to do right.

447
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,479
Number two, to love mercy.

448
00:23:39,479 --> 00:23:41,800
I think about this truth that's given to us

449
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:46,000
in these first two aspects of this list

450
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,800
that Micah provides in verse number eight,

451
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:51,479
and I am mindful of the truth of Ephesians 5

452
00:23:51,479 --> 00:23:52,399
in verse number 10,

453
00:23:52,399 --> 00:23:56,119
proving what is acceptable in the sight of the Lord.

454
00:23:56,119 --> 00:23:57,880
And the fact that we would understand

455
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:01,080
this truth of do justly.

456
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,679
Am I doing the right thing?

457
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,479
Do I have the pure motives?

458
00:24:06,479 --> 00:24:09,039
We find that in Ephesians 5 in verse number 10,

459
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:10,880
proving what is acceptable.

460
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,559
That word acceptable means well-pleasing.

461
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:14,320
How do we prove it?

462
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,720
You know the process of proving,

463
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,160
it was a term that was used often

464
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,760
with regard to the refining of metals.

465
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,880
The proving process.

466
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,040
We find that that was work.

467
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,040
We get into the Word of God.

468
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,920
We say what is it that pleases God?

469
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,079
What is it that's right?

470
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:34,119
Not based upon my standard,

471
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:36,839
but based upon God's standard.

472
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:38,799
He says do justly.

473
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,079
Love mercy.

474
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:44,079
By the way, we love receiving mercy, don't we?

475
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:47,720
Sometimes it's hard to show mercy.

476
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,079
Sometimes when we're in a situation,

477
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:54,160
man, I wish somebody would be merciful.

478
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,040
Maybe when I'm dealing with my own walk with the Lord,

479
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,559
I'm thankful, and I do,

480
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,160
I thank God every day that He's merciful.

481
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:05,760
And I thank God that I'm a recipient of His mercy.

482
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,600
But sometimes it's hard to show mercy.

483
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,880
Really the idea of loving mercy

484
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,880
is not simply loving to be the recipient of mercy,

485
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,279
but also showing mercy.

486
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:16,040
Notice finally,

487
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:20,200
and to walk humbly with thy God.

488
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,600
To walk humbly with thy God.

489
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,600
The word humble is such an important word.

490
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,679
We find it throughout the truth of God's Word.

491
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:33,279
This difference between pride and humility.

492
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:36,239
God resisteth the proud,

493
00:25:36,239 --> 00:25:38,720
but He gives grace unto the humble.

494
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,160
We find here that the Bible says

495
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,799
we're to walk humbly with thy God

496
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:45,320
in a humble manner, in a low state or condition.

497
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:48,440
Modest submissiveness is the idea of the word.

498
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,440
And I think about my walk with God.

499
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,000
I have asked myself this question

500
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,839
as I consider the message from Micah here

501
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:57,399
in Micah 6 and verse 8

502
00:25:57,399 --> 00:25:59,200
as he's ministering to these people

503
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,920
that God's called him to minister to.

504
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,720
And I question myself about my own walk.

505
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,399
Am I walking humbly with my God?

506
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:08,239
By the way, you can't give that instruction

507
00:26:08,239 --> 00:26:10,239
to a lost person.

508
00:26:10,239 --> 00:26:11,279
Right?

509
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:15,040
You have to establish the relationship.

510
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:18,720
Then, you find that you're going to walk with God.

511
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,040
And we understand this thing of walking humbly.

512
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:24,799
You know it's possible for us to get real prideful

513
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:27,760
about our position.

514
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,720
It really is.

515
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,720
It's easy for us to think

516
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,959
we're right and they're wrong.

517
00:26:34,959 --> 00:26:39,519
Until we remember that we were wrong one time too.

518
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:40,839
Right?

519
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,480
I mean, the grace of God.

520
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,519
Think about what He reminded them of

521
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:46,559
in verse number 4 of our text of Scripture.

522
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,720
I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt

523
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,559
and redeemed thee out of the house of servants

524
00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:54,600
and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.

525
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,119
And so we think about this truth.

526
00:26:56,119 --> 00:26:58,959
Listen, He redeemed us.

527
00:26:58,959 --> 00:27:00,040
Amen?

528
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,359
We're lost.

529
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:04,200
Undone.

530
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,640
But God's grace and His mercy.

531
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,839
Ephesians 2 talks about the fact that He's rich,

532
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,959
God who is rich in mercy.

533
00:27:10,959 --> 00:27:12,359
Amen?

534
00:27:12,359 --> 00:27:13,920
And we think about this truth

535
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,720
and we understand about the importance

536
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,720
of walking humbly with my God.

537
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,119
I thought about this.

538
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:22,079
Listen, because of our position in Christ,

539
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:25,040
we understand that there are many, many benefits

540
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,040
that we receive by our position in Christ.

541
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,959
And we understand that He's blessed us

542
00:27:28,959 --> 00:27:30,239
with all spiritual blessings.

543
00:27:30,239 --> 00:27:31,440
We're seated in the heavenlies.

544
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:37,200
I mean, it's an amazing truth to be a child of the King.

545
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:40,000
But we've got to be careful to understand

546
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,200
that because we're blessed with all of those things,

547
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,320
we still need to be humble in our approach

548
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,880
when we deal with others.

549
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,679
See, it's easy for us to think about,

550
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:55,160
well, I have this right and I have that right

551
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,440
and so on and so forth.

552
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,600
Walk humble.

553
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:05,079
Walk humbly with thy Lord, with thy God.

554
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:08,119
Think about the humility of our Savior.

555
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:14,200
Did He not exhibit great levels of humility?

556
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,799
In fact, when Paul is speaking about the truth

557
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:22,000
of this mind being you which is in Christ Jesus,

558
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,760
in the book of Philippians,

559
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,160
he's going through that process in the second chapter

560
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:29,119
and he's beginning to deal with some of that

561
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:30,200
which was going on.

562
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:34,640
If you look at the text immediately preceding

563
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:39,000
the apostle going into this example of humility

564
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,599
in the Lord Jesus Christ,

565
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:42,400
he says in Philippians 2,

566
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,760
let nothing be done through strife or vain glory,

567
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,919
but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other

568
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:49,840
better than themselves.

569
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,440
Looking not every man on his own things,

570
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,919
but every man also on the things of others.

571
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:55,799
Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus.

572
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:57,239
He goes through the whole process.

573
00:28:57,239 --> 00:29:01,400
We find that it talks about His incarnation

574
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:06,679
and all that is just the miracle of Christ's birth

575
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:09,440
and Him taking on the form of a man coming

576
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,840
and taking the form of a servant,

577
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,159
likeness of men.

578
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:14,000
We find that it says that He humbled Himself

579
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,479
and became obedient unto death,

580
00:29:15,479 --> 00:29:17,440
even the death of the cross.

581
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,599
Remember what Jesus did before He went to the cross

582
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:21,359
in John 13?

583
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:22,679
We know that it wasn't immediately,

584
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:24,400
it wasn't the last action that He did

585
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,440
before He went to the cross of Calvary,

586
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,239
but we understand that it was leading right up

587
00:29:28,239 --> 00:29:30,159
to the time in which Jesus would be arrested

588
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:32,320
in the garden and go to the cross of Calvary

589
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,400
and we find that it was there in John 13

590
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,799
that He washed the feet of the disciples.

591
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:40,200
What a great example of humility.

592
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,520
He said that He came to serve, to minister,

593
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:47,000
not to be ministered unto, but to minister, to serve.

594
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,960
We think about this thing of walking humbly with our God.

595
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:55,559
See, when we understand what God has given us to do,

596
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:57,799
then we understand, listen, the children of Israel

597
00:29:57,799 --> 00:30:00,119
during the time, really especially during the time

598
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:02,799
of Jotham and Ahaz.

599
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:08,539
During the time of Hezekiah and his reign as king, they experienced revival in Judah.

600
00:30:08,539 --> 00:30:12,519
We understand that during the time of Jotham and Ahaz, there's great wickedness that was

601
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:13,519
going on.

602
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:18,159
In fact, I've mentioned already how the Bible reveals to us in chapter 16 of 2 Kings how

603
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:19,719
that they were offering...

604
00:30:19,719 --> 00:30:31,359
Ahaz was guilty of giving his firstborn to the fires of Molech, wickedness.

605
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:34,599
The prophet says, the Lord hath a controversy with his people.

606
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:37,039
Okay, what do we do?

607
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:39,399
We bring some offerings?

608
00:30:39,399 --> 00:30:40,399
Do all these things?

609
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:42,479
Is that going to make God happy?

610
00:30:42,479 --> 00:30:49,879
He says, He hath showed thee, O man, what is good, and what doth the Lord require of

611
00:30:49,879 --> 00:30:51,079
thee?

612
00:30:51,079 --> 00:30:59,919
To do justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God.

613
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:04,119
Moses gave instruction to the children of Israel before they would enter the land of

614
00:31:04,119 --> 00:31:05,799
promise.

615
00:31:05,799 --> 00:31:13,919
Solomon finishes that great book that reveals to us some very important things.

616
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,159
He says, let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter.

617
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:17,159
Fear God, keep His commandments.

618
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:20,399
This is the whole duty of man.

619
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:27,879
So we understand that God has given us, I'm thankful that He's shown us what is right.

620
00:31:27,879 --> 00:31:32,839
And oh that God would help us to do right, to do justly.

621
00:31:32,879 --> 00:31:37,079
In a world that seems to be upside down, amen?

622
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:39,199
You're living in the same world I'm living, right?

623
00:31:39,199 --> 00:31:42,159
Man, it's crazy what's going on in our world today.

624
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:51,399
But God says, do right, do right, do justly, love mercy.

625
00:31:51,399 --> 00:31:57,559
I'm so thankful for God's mercy, oh that we would be merciful, and to walk humbly with

626
00:31:57,559 --> 00:31:59,319
thy God.

627
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:04,119
Amen, God resisteth the proud, gives grace unto the humble.

628
00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:08,559
Peter says that we're to be clothed with humility.

629
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:11,399
What a great truth there in 1 Peter chapter number 5.

630
00:32:11,399 --> 00:32:14,799
This evening, what doth the Lord require of thee?

631
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:18,119
Micah says this to those that he's called to minister.

632
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:22,199
Here's what God's shown us, three things, do justly, love mercy, walk humbly with thy

633
00:32:22,199 --> 00:32:23,199
God.

634
00:32:23,199 --> 00:32:26,639
Oh that we would learn lessons from this Old Testament prophet.

635
00:32:26,639 --> 00:32:35,440
I mean, he's prophesying in the 740, 750 BC, through the, right around the turn of

636
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,440
the century.

637
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,440
That's when he's prophesying.

638
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:42,279
But there's a lesson for us even still today, amen?

639
00:32:42,279 --> 00:32:43,639
What doth the Lord require of thee?

640
00:32:43,639 --> 00:32:46,080
Father, we pray that you'd help us.

641
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,199
Help us, Lord, to do justly.

642
00:32:49,199 --> 00:32:52,119
Help us, Lord, to love mercy.

643
00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:55,319
Help us, Lord, to walk humbly with our God.

644
00:32:55,319 --> 00:32:59,039
We thank you that you are our God.

645
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:01,599
We thank you that you're our shield and our buckler.

646
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:05,000
We thank you that you're our refuge, our hiding place.

647
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,039
We thank you that you're our strength.

648
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:09,039
You're our redeemer.

649
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:11,839
You are the creator of all things.

650
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:16,879
We thank you that you are King of kings, Lord of lords, the great I am.

651
00:33:16,879 --> 00:33:23,039
We thank you that you've given us thy word and contained therein you've taught us that

652
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,080
which would please thee.

653
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:28,959
And I pray, God, that you'd help us to be doers of the word.

654
00:33:28,959 --> 00:33:31,319
Help us to dig into the word of God.

655
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:37,639
Help us to not be influenced and persuaded by our society as to what they might call

656
00:33:37,639 --> 00:33:39,759
right.

657
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:45,119
Help us to prove what is acceptable in the sight of the Lord.

658
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:49,119
Help us, Lord, to love mercy.

659
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:54,639
Help us, God, to walk with you, but to walk humbly with you.

660
00:33:54,639 --> 00:33:59,639
Understanding is all because of the grace and mercy of God.

661
00:33:59,639 --> 00:34:04,159
Paul said, I am what I am, the grace of God.

662
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:08,399
We thank you and praise you for the work that you've done in our lives.

663
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:11,839
We pray, God, that you'd use us to make a difference in the lives of those that we come

664
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:18,359
in contact with, Lord, that they'd see Christ in us, the hope of glory.

665
00:34:18,359 --> 00:34:22,600
Well, thank you for all that you'll do, for it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
