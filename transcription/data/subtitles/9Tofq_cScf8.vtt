00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.039
the book of Micah chapter number six. We're going to look at some things in chapter number one as

00:00:05.039 --> 00:00:12.479
well. And so Micah chapter number six, Jonah, and then Micah. And so back there in the minor

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:19.440
prophets of your Bible, and what a great little book this is. Seven chapters, powerful message

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:25.440
that God gives us here throughout this book. I've asked you to go to Micah six. I'll reference

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.920
part of what the Bible gives us in Micah chapter number one. In verse number one,

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:36.720
the Bible says this, the word of the Lord that came to Micah the Moresthi in the days of Jotham,

00:00:37.279 --> 00:00:46.880
Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem. Now,

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.840
verse number one is such a helpful verse for helping us to understand the timing of the book

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.799
that is before us. We'll be looking at chapter number six this evening. But as we look at the

00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:05.279
first verse of this book, the Bible lays out for us the timing in which this one Micah is

00:01:05.279 --> 00:01:11.440
prophesying. The Bible tells us in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah. Now these are three

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:19.440
kings of Judah. Of course, we're very familiar with king Hezekiah. Ahaz was before him. And then

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.040
Jotham preceded Ahaz. And if you want to jot down maybe right in the beginning of your notes,

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.800
2 Kings chapter 15 through 20, if you really want to read about some of the things that were

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.959
happening during the time in which Micah was prophesying, that'd be a good place to go. We

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:41.519
don't have the time this evening to look at the entirety of those chapters over in 2 Kings,

00:01:41.519 --> 00:01:47.120
but we find in chapters 15 through 20 that God gives us a record of those things that are

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:52.480
happening during the time of Micah's ministry. Now it's interesting at the end of the verse,

00:01:52.480 --> 00:02:00.160
the Bible says, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem. Oftentimes, as we study the

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.160
prophets, whether they be the major prophets or the minor prophets, we have the opportunity

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.679
really to see how they have a ministry particularly to either Israel or to Judah.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:16.559
And we find that the Bible says here concerning Samaria and Jerusalem. Samaria is the city that

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.800
really is the capital of Israel, the tribes of the north. We've mentioned many times throughout

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:30.639
our study of the lives of Elijah and Elisha, the reference to Samaria, often a place in which

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:35.600
there was many references during their ministries. And of course, Jerusalem we're very familiar with

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:42.399
is the capital of Judah. As we begin to think about these truths that are laid out for us in

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:48.000
chapter number one, we find that the Bible references the kings of Judah, not the kings of

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Israel. However, as we would look at the prophecy and we see that it's concerning Samaria and

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.240
Jerusalem, that many of those things contained within the book of Micah definitely would have

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:07.440
an immediate liking to what's going on in Israel, but we understand that Judah was just like her

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.279
wicked sister. Isaiah deals with that. Micah really would have been a contemporary of Isaiah.

00:03:13.279 --> 00:03:18.639
Isaiah, if you read about his life and ministry, you see the interaction that he had with Hezekiah.

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:23.679
And of course, Micah's reigning as a prophet during that same period of time. And so they

00:03:23.679 --> 00:03:27.919
would have been contemporaries one with the other. As we come to the sixth chapter, and I know we're

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:32.639
kind of not studying the entire book of Micah, but I want to focus in here on a passage of

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:37.440
Scripture here in Micah 6, verses one through eight. As we look at this passage of Scripture,

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.839
I'm going to read verse number eight, share with you the title, and then we'll get into the message

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:48.399
this evening. The Bible says this, He hath showed thee, O man, what is good, and what doth the Lord

00:03:48.399 --> 00:03:56.639
require of thee, but to do justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God. I've simply

00:03:56.639 --> 00:04:04.000
entitled the message this evening, what doth the Lord require of thee? We see that phrase in verse

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.240
number eight, what doth the Lord require of thee? We'll be looking at Micah 6, one through eight.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:13.600
As the children of Israel were preparing to enter into the land of promise, God used Moses to prepare

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.519
them for the entry into the land. Of course, we study the book of Joshua, and we studied the book

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.880
of Joshua this year during the pandemic through those lessons that we titled, Journeying Through

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.519
Joshua. And as we took our journey through Joshua, in the beginning of those messages, we

00:04:27.519 --> 00:04:33.440
dealt much with the preparation of Moses, how God would use Moses to prepare not only Joshua, but

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.440
the children of Israel, and the messages that are contained within the book of Deuteronomy.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.559
What's interesting that in Deuteronomy chapter number 10, and really you could read the entirety

00:04:42.559 --> 00:04:48.399
of the tenth chapter and even the next several chapters, but I want to just reference Deuteronomy

00:04:48.399 --> 00:04:54.320
10 verses 12 and 13. Here's what is said to the children of Israel as they're preparing to enter

00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:01.519
into the land of promise. And now Israel, what doth the Lord thy God require of thee? Sound familiar?

00:05:02.559 --> 00:05:06.480
We see it in Micah, right? We just read it there in verse number eight of chapter six.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:12.720
What doth the Lord require of thee but to fear the Lord thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:18.559
him, and to serve the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy soul, to keep the commandments

00:05:18.559 --> 00:05:24.559
of the Lord and his statutes which I commanded thee this day for thy good? Again, we could continue

00:05:24.559 --> 00:05:28.320
looking through the next several chapters of the book of Deuteronomy and see many references as to

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:33.359
what it was that Moses was encouraging the children of Israel to do, how they were to live as they

00:05:33.359 --> 00:05:38.799
would prepare for entering into the land of promise. It's interesting as you read the book of Ecclesiastes,

00:05:38.799 --> 00:05:44.959
Solomon is writing concerning those things under the sun. And it's a particular perspective that

00:05:44.959 --> 00:05:49.760
Solomon has in writing the book of Ecclesiastes, and it's important for us to understand his

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:54.480
perspective. But I will say this, that when he gets to the end, remember one of the themes, one of the

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:59.440
thoughts, the phrases throughout the book of Ecclesiastes, vanity of vanities, right? It's all

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:04.799
vanity. We find that Solomon would come to the latter part of the book, and he comes to chapter

00:06:04.799 --> 00:06:10.959
12 and verse number 13, and it says this, let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:22.720
Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man. We find that Moses, as he

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:28.160
was preparing the children of Israel for entrance into the land of promise, that he says here's what

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:34.720
the Lord thy God requires of thee. We find that Solomon, after he writes the book of Ecclesiastes,

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:40.079
of course he was a great king. Yes, he did not end his life as well as he started his life, and we

00:06:40.079 --> 00:06:44.640
understand that. But we find that he says, let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter. He says,

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:50.559
this is the whole duty of man. What is it? Fear God and keep his commandments. Can I tell you,

00:06:50.559 --> 00:06:57.920
if you fear God, you will keep his commandments. Amen? We find that here, as we would look and come

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:06.160
to the book of Micah this evening, that we find that Micah reminds those to whom he is called to

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:12.720
minister of what the Lord required of them. Notice as we look at our text of Scripture, and we'll

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:16.880
dig into verse number eight and look at these three things particularly, but I want to give you

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:23.679
the essence of what's going on in this chapter. Notice as we begin in verse number one of Micah 6,

00:07:23.679 --> 00:07:30.480
the Bible says this, hear ye now what the Lord saith. As soon as you start with that type of an

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:35.200
introduction, you find that many of the prophets, they would use the terminology, thus saith the

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:44.160
Lord. And here Micah says, hear ye now what the Lord saith. Arise, contend thou before the mountains

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:52.640
and let the hills hear thy voice. Hear ye, O mountains, the Lord's controversy, and ye strong

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:58.959
foundations of the earth. Notice this, the end of verse number two, for the Lord hath a controversy

00:07:58.959 --> 00:08:08.239
with his people, and he will plead with Israel, O my people, what have I done unto thee? And wherein

00:08:08.239 --> 00:08:15.519
have I wearied thee? Testify against me. We notice in these first few verses of chapter number six,

00:08:15.519 --> 00:08:21.519
as this message is unfolding from Micah, that of course it's from the Lord, as we see in verse

00:08:21.519 --> 00:08:27.440
number one, hear ye now what the Lord saith, that we're reminded here of the fact that God is laying

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:34.000
out for his people that he has a controversy with them, a dispute, a contention. We find that God

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:41.599
then goes into really looking at verses four and five of reminding the people not only what he did

00:08:41.599 --> 00:08:48.159
for them, but why he did it. You know, often throughout the Old Testament in particular, but

00:08:48.159 --> 00:08:53.039
certainly the truth is there for us in the New Testament, and it'll help us to see the parallels.

00:08:53.039 --> 00:08:57.760
We find in the Old Testament, the Bible tells us often, in the message to the children of Israel,

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:04.239
they were to remember. Beware lest thou forget. It carries the same idea of remembering. We find that

00:09:04.239 --> 00:09:10.479
God would often tell them, in fact he gave them many things that would help them remember all

00:09:10.479 --> 00:09:16.479
that God had done for them. As New Testament believers, we find that the table before me says

00:09:16.479 --> 00:09:23.039
this do in remembrance of me. We find that as we observe the Lord's Supper, that we're being

00:09:23.039 --> 00:09:29.679
reminded of what the Lord Jesus Christ did for us on the cross of Calvary. And we find that we are

00:09:29.679 --> 00:09:34.559
given some things that we're to remember, and we find here that in verse number four, notice what

00:09:34.559 --> 00:09:40.799
God says, for I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of

00:09:40.799 --> 00:09:50.400
servants, and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam. O my people, remember now what Balak king

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:57.359
of Moab had consulted, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim unto Gilgal.

00:09:58.159 --> 00:09:59.919
Notice this, that ye may know

00:09:59.919 --> 00:10:04.659
know the righteousness of the Lord."

00:10:04.659 --> 00:10:07.819
God is reminding His people

00:10:07.819 --> 00:10:09.399
of what He did for them.

00:10:09.399 --> 00:10:10.899
It's good for us to be reminded

00:10:10.899 --> 00:10:13.019
of what God's done for us.

00:10:13.019 --> 00:10:15.979
We find that as we look at the end of v. 5,

00:10:15.979 --> 00:10:18.059
the Bible says that you may know

00:10:18.059 --> 00:10:21.019
the righteousness of the Lord.

00:10:21.019 --> 00:10:23.799
I'm thankful that our God is righteous.

00:10:23.799 --> 00:10:27.679
We understand that we, as saved people,

00:10:27.679 --> 00:10:29.979
have had Christ's righteousness

00:10:29.979 --> 00:10:31.659
imputed upon our account

00:10:31.659 --> 00:10:33.439
and what a blessing that is.

00:10:33.439 --> 00:10:37.259
And we find that here as we look at this truth,

00:10:37.259 --> 00:10:40.879
the reality is that God has made known

00:10:40.879 --> 00:10:43.939
His righteousness.

00:10:43.939 --> 00:10:45.779
We enter into the section here

00:10:45.779 --> 00:10:48.279
in v. 6-7 leading up to the truth

00:10:48.279 --> 00:10:50.879
in v. 8 that we'll examine this evening.

00:10:50.879 --> 00:10:51.819
The Bible says,

00:10:51.819 --> 00:10:54.239
"...wherewith shall I come before the Lord?"

00:10:54.239 --> 00:10:55.919
And so it's as if Israel is now

00:10:55.919 --> 00:10:58.999
replying to that indictment, if you will,

00:10:58.999 --> 00:11:01.939
that God has given to His people

00:11:01.939 --> 00:11:04.019
the controversy, the dispute,

00:11:04.019 --> 00:11:06.059
the contention that is mentioned.

00:11:06.059 --> 00:11:08.399
And now, the Bible says in v. 6,

00:11:08.399 --> 00:11:11.719
"...wherewith shall I come before the Lord?

00:11:11.719 --> 00:11:14.239
And bow myself before the High God?

00:11:14.239 --> 00:11:16.479
Shall I come before Him with burnt offerings,

00:11:16.479 --> 00:11:18.959
with calves of a year old?"

00:11:18.959 --> 00:11:20.559
You find that the answer really

00:11:20.559 --> 00:11:21.919
that is given here

00:11:21.919 --> 00:11:24.119
is an answer of an outward expression.

00:11:24.119 --> 00:11:25.479
Should I come with offerings

00:11:25.479 --> 00:11:27.159
or should I come with sacrifices?

00:11:27.159 --> 00:11:28.499
You find that as you study

00:11:28.499 --> 00:11:29.839
some of the other prophets,

00:11:29.839 --> 00:11:32.439
and you find that the people of God,

00:11:32.439 --> 00:11:34.399
they had brought offerings,

00:11:34.399 --> 00:11:36.679
but God says, I don't want your offerings.

00:11:36.679 --> 00:11:39.559
Why? Because your heart is far from Me.

00:11:39.559 --> 00:11:41.799
You're just doing this outward expression.

00:11:41.799 --> 00:11:44.359
You're just going through the motions, if you will.

00:11:44.359 --> 00:11:46.119
But I'm concerned about your heart.

00:11:46.119 --> 00:11:48.599
I want your heart.

00:11:48.599 --> 00:11:50.439
And they're asking about these offerings

00:11:50.439 --> 00:11:51.519
and these sacrifices.

00:11:51.519 --> 00:11:52.679
Notice in v. 7,

00:11:52.919 --> 00:11:54.359
"...will the Lord be pleased

00:11:54.359 --> 00:11:55.919
with thousands of rams

00:11:55.919 --> 00:11:59.479
or with ten thousands of rivers of oil?

00:11:59.479 --> 00:12:03.079
Shall I give My firstborn for My transgression

00:12:03.079 --> 00:12:06.839
the fruit of My body for the sin of My soul?"

00:12:06.839 --> 00:12:08.639
It's amazing how in v. 7,

00:12:08.639 --> 00:12:11.159
it kind of hits them square between the eyes,

00:12:11.159 --> 00:12:12.279
if you will.

00:12:12.279 --> 00:12:14.519
Remember in v. 1 of Micah 1,

00:12:14.519 --> 00:12:16.439
the Bible tells us that He was prophesying

00:12:16.439 --> 00:12:20.359
during the time of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah.

00:12:20.359 --> 00:12:22.719
The Bible tells us here in v. 7

00:12:22.719 --> 00:12:23.719
at the end of the verse,

00:12:23.719 --> 00:12:26.239
"...shall I give My firstborn for My transgression

00:12:26.239 --> 00:12:28.639
the fruit of My body for the sin of My soul?"

00:12:28.639 --> 00:12:30.719
In 2 Kings 16, again, I mentioned

00:12:30.719 --> 00:12:33.679
that really you'd look at chapters 15-20

00:12:33.679 --> 00:12:35.959
in order to see the context of what's going on

00:12:35.959 --> 00:12:38.359
during the time of Micah's ministry.

00:12:38.359 --> 00:12:41.479
But here in 2 Kings 16 and v. 3

00:12:41.479 --> 00:12:43.439
during the reign of Ahaz,

00:12:43.439 --> 00:12:45.759
here's how it's described.

00:12:45.759 --> 00:12:48.399
The Bible speaks about Ahaz coming into power

00:12:48.439 --> 00:12:50.279
and that he did not that which was right

00:12:50.279 --> 00:12:52.999
in the sight of the Lord his God like David his father.

00:12:52.999 --> 00:12:54.479
And it tells us in v. 3,

00:12:54.479 --> 00:12:56.319
"...but he walked in the way of the kings of Israel,

00:12:56.319 --> 00:13:00.279
yea, and made his son to pass through the fire

00:13:00.279 --> 00:13:03.079
according to the abominations of the heathen

00:13:03.079 --> 00:13:08.079
whom the Lord cast out from before the children of Israel."

00:13:08.239 --> 00:13:13.239
Literally, Ahaz offered his son to Molech.

00:13:13.359 --> 00:13:16.839
Specifically given the truth

00:13:16.839 --> 00:13:19.599
of not performing these things,

00:13:19.599 --> 00:13:21.879
this abomination before the Lord

00:13:21.879 --> 00:13:24.479
in Leviticus 18 v. 21.

00:13:26.039 --> 00:13:27.639
And we find that here,

00:13:27.639 --> 00:13:30.199
Micah, of course, the prophet of God

00:13:30.199 --> 00:13:31.999
giving the word of the Lord.

00:13:31.999 --> 00:13:34.279
He's confronting the individuals.

00:13:34.279 --> 00:13:36.399
He's confronting the people of God.

00:13:36.399 --> 00:13:38.559
Israel and Judah.

00:13:38.559 --> 00:13:41.679
And we find that here as we come to v. 8,

00:13:41.679 --> 00:13:43.559
I love the way that the verse starts.

00:13:43.599 --> 00:13:47.039
It says, he hath showed thee.

00:13:48.159 --> 00:13:51.319
Here's why I particularly find myself

00:13:51.319 --> 00:13:53.759
looking at v. 8 in those first few words.

00:13:53.759 --> 00:13:56.999
You find this controversy that the Lord has.

00:13:56.999 --> 00:13:58.999
And the Lord brings Micah.

00:13:58.999 --> 00:14:02.039
Micah faithfully is giving this truth

00:14:02.039 --> 00:14:04.799
to those that he's been called to minister.

00:14:04.799 --> 00:14:08.039
And Micah says, the Lord has a controversy with you.

00:14:08.039 --> 00:14:09.319
And it's as if the people say,

00:14:09.319 --> 00:14:10.839
okay, so what should we do about this?

00:14:10.839 --> 00:14:12.799
Can we make some offerings?

00:14:12.839 --> 00:14:13.879
Can we do some things?

00:14:13.879 --> 00:14:16.199
Is there something we can do?

00:14:16.199 --> 00:14:19.199
And Micah says, he hath showed thee.

00:14:20.159 --> 00:14:21.319
He hath showed thee.

00:14:22.399 --> 00:14:24.639
And we find that as we understand,

00:14:24.639 --> 00:14:27.159
even as we make mention today,

00:14:27.159 --> 00:14:29.879
as New Testament believers,

00:14:29.879 --> 00:14:32.519
having the entire whole canon,

00:14:32.519 --> 00:14:34.719
the complete canon of Scripture,

00:14:34.719 --> 00:14:36.999
that we could speak to someone.

00:14:36.999 --> 00:14:39.079
Maybe if we want to use the illustration

00:14:39.079 --> 00:14:41.319
this evening of salvation,

00:14:41.319 --> 00:14:45.199
we share with somebody that they're condemned already.

00:14:45.199 --> 00:14:46.359
That's what the Bible teaches us

00:14:46.359 --> 00:14:48.119
in John 3.

00:14:48.119 --> 00:14:50.479
He that believeth not is condemned already.

00:14:50.479 --> 00:14:52.119
Someone wrote a Gospel tract.

00:14:52.119 --> 00:14:54.119
What is it that I have to do to go to hell?

00:14:54.119 --> 00:14:55.879
The answer is nothing.

00:14:55.879 --> 00:14:58.159
We're condemned already.

00:14:58.159 --> 00:15:00.679
And so we bring this truth of salvation

00:15:00.679 --> 00:15:02.759
and someone says, okay, what is it that I need to do?

00:15:02.759 --> 00:15:03.719
Can I go to church more?

00:15:03.719 --> 00:15:04.639
Can I do this?

00:15:04.639 --> 00:15:06.079
No, he hath already showed thee.

00:15:06.079 --> 00:15:08.119
He's given us the plan of redemption.

00:15:08.119 --> 00:15:10.119
He's revealed to us in His Word

00:15:10.159 --> 00:15:12.359
what it is that we are to do

00:15:12.359 --> 00:15:13.759
with regard to redemption.

00:15:13.759 --> 00:15:15.439
We understand that.

00:15:15.439 --> 00:15:19.319
But we find here for these that Micah is prophesying to,

00:15:19.319 --> 00:15:21.599
that Micah says, he hath showed thee,

00:15:21.599 --> 00:15:23.279
oh man, what is good

00:15:23.279 --> 00:15:25.679
and what doth the Lord require of thee?

00:15:25.679 --> 00:15:28.559
Now we understand that this is not an exact quote

00:15:28.559 --> 00:15:30.439
of everything that would be contained

00:15:30.439 --> 00:15:31.759
in the book of Deuteronomy

00:15:31.759 --> 00:15:33.759
that we looked at in the 10th chapter

00:15:33.759 --> 00:15:35.999
a few moments ago.

00:15:35.999 --> 00:15:37.999
I can't help but believe

00:15:38.039 --> 00:15:40.679
that the recipients as they would have had

00:15:40.679 --> 00:15:44.079
some level of knowledge of the books of Moses,

00:15:44.079 --> 00:15:46.279
that when they hear that phraseology

00:15:46.279 --> 00:15:48.559
of what the Lord required of them,

00:15:48.559 --> 00:15:51.199
that perhaps there were some within the congregation

00:15:51.199 --> 00:15:53.799
that would have been reminded of that truth

00:15:53.799 --> 00:15:55.359
that was shared by Moses

00:15:55.359 --> 00:15:57.279
as the children of Israel would prepare

00:15:57.279 --> 00:15:59.599
to enter into the land of promise.

00:15:59.599 --> 00:16:01.799
Remember as we've studied through the book of Deuteronomy

00:16:01.799 --> 00:16:04.759
at various times over the years

00:16:04.759 --> 00:16:06.719
that we found that the Bible reveals to us

00:16:06.839 --> 00:16:10.039
that listen, the truth, it's not far off,

00:16:10.039 --> 00:16:12.519
it's nigh unto thee.

00:16:12.519 --> 00:16:16.879
And here God has faithfully, graciously given

00:16:16.879 --> 00:16:21.079
a prophet to go and to share with the people.

00:16:21.079 --> 00:16:23.719
The Lord hath a controversy with thee.

00:16:23.719 --> 00:16:26.279
Notice, what is it?

00:16:26.279 --> 00:16:28.919
He hath showed thee, oh man, what is good

00:16:28.919 --> 00:16:31.199
and what doth the Lord require of thee?

00:16:32.159 --> 00:16:34.519
Number one, to do justly.

00:16:35.479 --> 00:16:37.239
Number one, to do justly.

00:16:38.239 --> 00:16:39.679
The word justly carries with it

00:16:39.679 --> 00:16:42.399
the idea of inconformity to law,

00:16:42.399 --> 00:16:44.399
justice or propriety.

00:16:44.399 --> 00:16:46.199
According to the truth and facts,

00:16:46.199 --> 00:16:49.359
honestly, fairly, with integrity.

00:16:49.359 --> 00:16:52.639
We think about the call that is given here.

00:16:52.639 --> 00:16:55.639
Number one, what is it that the Lord doth require

00:16:55.639 --> 00:16:57.159
of thee to do justly?

00:16:57.159 --> 00:16:58.959
To do the right thing.

00:16:58.959 --> 00:16:59.959
To do right.

00:17:01.319 --> 00:17:03.759
In a world where so many are doing wrong.

00:17:04.559 --> 00:17:05.919
Right?

00:17:05.919 --> 00:17:07.559
You think about the nation of Israel

00:17:07.559 --> 00:17:09.079
and you think about that which they've been

00:17:09.079 --> 00:17:11.639
experienced with and of course we understand

00:17:11.639 --> 00:17:14.399
that even during the prophecy of Micah,

00:17:14.399 --> 00:17:16.119
because the Bible carries with us

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:19.559
the fact that it was Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah,

00:17:19.559 --> 00:17:23.159
that's where would be the span of Micah's ministry,

00:17:23.159 --> 00:17:25.279
that Israel went into captivity

00:17:25.279 --> 00:17:28.279
by the Assyrians during his ministry.

00:17:28.279 --> 00:17:29.559
If you look at it historically,

00:17:29.559 --> 00:17:32.999
you'll see that that's exactly what happened.

00:17:33.039 --> 00:17:36.639
We find that here, as Micah would be prophesying,

00:17:36.639 --> 00:17:38.839
he says to do justly.

00:17:38.839 --> 00:17:41.359
You know, we speak often about those

00:17:41.359 --> 00:17:42.399
that have gone before us

00:17:42.399 --> 00:17:45.159
and we reference some great Bible characters

00:17:45.159 --> 00:17:46.839
of those that walked with God

00:17:46.839 --> 00:17:49.319
in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation

00:17:49.319 --> 00:17:50.959
and we understand that we're living

00:17:50.959 --> 00:17:52.879
in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation.

00:17:52.879 --> 00:17:54.599
We're living in the midst of a time

00:17:54.599 --> 00:17:56.559
in which we find that the prophets of God

00:17:56.559 --> 00:17:59.279
would prophesy to Israel and Judah

00:17:59.279 --> 00:18:01.799
that they call good evil and evil good

00:18:01.839 --> 00:18:03.559
and we understand those things,

00:18:03.559 --> 00:18:06.159
but I'm thankful that we have the Word of God

00:18:06.159 --> 00:18:08.719
and that God shows us how it is

00:18:08.719 --> 00:18:10.079
that we can do justly,

00:18:10.079 --> 00:18:12.959
that we can walk in a proper way.

00:18:12.959 --> 00:18:14.039
We can do right.

00:18:15.879 --> 00:18:19.799
A preacher of yesteryear used to constantly say,

00:18:19.799 --> 00:18:22.559
do right, do right.

00:18:22.559 --> 00:18:24.399
And he'd have various things

00:18:24.399 --> 00:18:27.319
that he would attach to that statement,

00:18:27.319 --> 00:18:30.999
but just pounding in the thought of doing right.

00:18:30.999 --> 00:18:32.799
But notice, the Bible says,

00:18:32.799 --> 00:18:35.679
He hath showed thee, O man, what is good.

00:18:35.679 --> 00:18:37.159
And what doth the Lord require of thee,

00:18:37.159 --> 00:18:38.320
but to do justly?

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:40.919
And so as we find within context,

00:18:40.919 --> 00:18:43.320
the Bible says that He hath showed thee, O man,

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:44.159
what is good.

00:18:44.159 --> 00:18:45.719
Then He says to do justly.

00:18:45.719 --> 00:18:48.119
And so we understand that it's not doing good

00:18:48.119 --> 00:18:51.239
based upon their own definition

00:18:51.239 --> 00:18:53.719
of what is good or what is just.

00:18:53.719 --> 00:18:55.000
See, there was a period of time

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.039
in the nation of Israel,

00:18:56.039 --> 00:18:58.519
we know it as the period of the judges.

00:18:58.519 --> 00:19:00.159
There was a time in which every man did that

00:19:00.159 --> 00:19:03.679
which was right, not according to God's Word,

00:19:03.679 --> 00:19:06.760
but according to their own standard.

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:08.719
And we find that there no doubt

00:19:08.719 --> 00:19:10.959
is a time in which we're living today

00:19:10.959 --> 00:19:13.599
in which people say that they're doing right,

00:19:13.599 --> 00:19:15.159
but they're their own authority,

00:19:15.159 --> 00:19:16.760
they're their own standard.

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:19.239
And God says here in His Word

00:19:19.239 --> 00:19:21.839
that He hath showed thee, O man, what is good.

00:19:21.839 --> 00:19:23.279
And what doth the Lord require of thee,

00:19:23.279 --> 00:19:24.959
but to do justly?

00:19:24.959 --> 00:19:28.159
So they were living in a very evil, corrupt time.

00:19:28.159 --> 00:19:30.079
In fact, if you look at some things here

00:19:30.079 --> 00:19:31.359
within the book of Micah,

00:19:31.359 --> 00:19:33.119
look back in chapter 3,

00:19:33.119 --> 00:19:35.440
if you think about having some people

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:37.839
that were in places of doing just,

00:19:37.839 --> 00:19:40.159
carrying out justice if you will,

00:19:40.159 --> 00:19:41.919
that they were crooked.

00:19:41.919 --> 00:19:44.559
The Bible tells us in Micah 3 and verse 11,

00:19:44.559 --> 00:19:46.039
the heads thereof judge,

00:19:46.039 --> 00:19:47.279
but notice what it says,

00:19:47.279 --> 00:19:50.519
they judge for reward.

00:19:50.519 --> 00:19:52.719
The priests thereof teach,

00:19:52.719 --> 00:19:55.559
but notice, they teach for hire.

00:19:55.559 --> 00:19:57.440
The prophets thereof divine,

00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:00.000
but notice, they divine for money.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.360
Yet, will they lean upon the Lord and say,

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:06.719
is not the Lord among us?

00:20:06.719 --> 00:20:10.220
None evil can come upon us.

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:12.060
We find that here in v. 11,

00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:13.720
that the heads thereof,

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:16.760
they were to judge, but not for reward.

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:18.639
The priests, they were to teach,

00:20:18.639 --> 00:20:20.520
but not for hire.

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:23.159
The prophets, they were to divine,

00:20:23.159 --> 00:20:25.120
but not for money.

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:27.000
We find that as we look at these verses,

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.360
really we could understand

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:30.559
really what is the motive?

00:20:30.559 --> 00:20:31.719
What was the motive?

00:20:31.719 --> 00:20:33.680
What is it that's being dealt with here?

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:35.200
We notice in chapter 7,

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.279
in v. 3, it says this,

00:20:37.279 --> 00:20:40.919
that they may do evil with both hands earnestly.

00:20:40.919 --> 00:20:43.560
The prince asketh, and the judge asketh

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:45.360
for a reward.

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:48.720
The great man, he uttereth his mischievous desire,

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:52.159
so they wrap it up.

00:20:52.159 --> 00:20:54.840
You notice that it says both the prince

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:56.319
and the judge,

00:20:56.319 --> 00:20:58.240
that they asketh for a reward.

00:20:58.279 --> 00:21:00.200
It says that they may do evil

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:03.959
with both hands earnestly.

00:21:03.959 --> 00:21:06.480
It is God's instruction here

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:08.480
in the passage in Micah 6

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:10.360
when it's the indictment,

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:12.680
the controversy the Lord has with His people.

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:14.559
And He says, here's what you're to do.

00:21:14.559 --> 00:21:15.440
Here's the answer.

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:17.800
Number one, do justly.

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:20.760
Do justly.

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:24.120
Number two, love mercy.

00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:27.400
Love mercy.

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:31.080
I'm so thankful that our God is just.

00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:34.120
And I'm so thankful that our God is merciful.

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:35.360
This evening, no doubt,

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:37.040
each of us have been the recipients

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:38.720
of God's mercy.

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:39.879
If you're saved this evening,

00:21:39.879 --> 00:21:42.480
we understand that it's not by our own works,

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:46.040
but by His mercy He hath begotten us.

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:48.040
This evening as we think about this

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:50.080
truth of loving mercy,

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:51.919
and we understand that as we look

00:21:51.919 --> 00:21:53.319
at these first two points,

00:21:53.319 --> 00:21:55.720
the important aspect of understanding

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.160
that these attributes that are mentioned,

00:21:58.160 --> 00:21:59.959
the justice and the mercy,

00:21:59.959 --> 00:22:03.000
the fact that our God is a just judge,

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.120
that He is always doing that which is right.

00:22:08.839 --> 00:22:11.919
Some could lay a charge against God

00:22:11.919 --> 00:22:12.919
for doing something wrong,

00:22:12.919 --> 00:22:16.240
but it would not be a valid charge.

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:18.880
Our God always does that which is right.

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:19.720
Amen?

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:21.080
Always.

00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:22.559
Every single time.

00:22:22.559 --> 00:22:23.720
He's just.

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:25.000
He's righteous.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.639
It's His character.

00:22:26.639 --> 00:22:30.119
His mercy endureth forever.

00:22:30.119 --> 00:22:33.240
This evening I understand that I have received mercy,

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:35.399
but I wonder how often if we really think

00:22:35.399 --> 00:22:36.960
about this thing of loving mercy,

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:39.199
it really cares about the idea of being merciful.

00:22:39.199 --> 00:22:40.320
Showing mercy.

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:43.080
Showing it.

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:45.479
It's interesting in John chapter number one,

00:22:45.479 --> 00:22:47.360
and I know the word grace is used

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:49.240
in the passage of Scripture.

00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:52.160
I want you to see that in John chapter number one,

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:54.240
the Bible speaks about this truth

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:57.520
with regard to the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:59.600
It says in verse number 14 of John one,

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:02.399
and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us.

00:23:02.399 --> 00:23:03.919
We beheld His glory.

00:23:03.919 --> 00:23:06.399
The glory is of the only begotten of the Father,

00:23:06.399 --> 00:23:09.039
full of grace and truth.

00:23:09.039 --> 00:23:12.039
Verse 17, for the law was given by Moses,

00:23:12.039 --> 00:23:16.479
but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.

00:23:16.479 --> 00:23:18.639
That word grace there is a result

00:23:18.639 --> 00:23:20.880
of God's merciful kindness.

00:23:21.839 --> 00:23:26.320
We find here that in Micah chapter number six,

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:27.960
he says here's what the Lord requires.

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:30.199
He's already shown this to you.

00:23:30.199 --> 00:23:32.080
This is what is good.

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:33.320
This is what's acceptable to God.

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:34.720
This is what He requires of me.

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:37.600
Number one, to do justly, to do right.

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:39.479
Number two, to love mercy.

00:23:39.479 --> 00:23:41.800
I think about this truth that's given to us

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:46.000
in these first two aspects of this list

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.800
that Micah provides in verse number eight,

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:51.479
and I am mindful of the truth of Ephesians 5

00:23:51.479 --> 00:23:52.399
in verse number 10,

00:23:52.399 --> 00:23:56.119
proving what is acceptable in the sight of the Lord.

00:23:56.119 --> 00:23:57.880
And the fact that we would understand

00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:01.080
this truth of do justly.

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:03.679
Am I doing the right thing?

00:24:03.679 --> 00:24:06.479
Do I have the pure motives?

00:24:06.479 --> 00:24:09.039
We find that in Ephesians 5 in verse number 10,

00:24:09.039 --> 00:24:10.880
proving what is acceptable.

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:13.559
That word acceptable means well-pleasing.

00:24:13.559 --> 00:24:14.320
How do we prove it?

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:15.720
You know the process of proving,

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:17.160
it was a term that was used often

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:19.760
with regard to the refining of metals.

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:21.880
The proving process.

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:24.040
We find that that was work.

00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:26.040
We get into the Word of God.

00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:27.920
We say what is it that pleases God?

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:30.079
What is it that's right?

00:24:30.079 --> 00:24:34.119
Not based upon my standard,

00:24:34.119 --> 00:24:36.839
but based upon God's standard.

00:24:36.839 --> 00:24:38.799
He says do justly.

00:24:38.799 --> 00:24:40.079
Love mercy.

00:24:40.079 --> 00:24:44.079
By the way, we love receiving mercy, don't we?

00:24:44.119 --> 00:24:47.720
Sometimes it's hard to show mercy.

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:49.079
Sometimes when we're in a situation,

00:24:49.079 --> 00:24:54.160
man, I wish somebody would be merciful.

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:57.040
Maybe when I'm dealing with my own walk with the Lord,

00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:58.559
I'm thankful, and I do,

00:24:58.559 --> 00:25:01.160
I thank God every day that He's merciful.

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:05.760
And I thank God that I'm a recipient of His mercy.

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:08.600
But sometimes it's hard to show mercy.

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:09.880
Really the idea of loving mercy

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:12.880
is not simply loving to be the recipient of mercy,

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:14.279
but also showing mercy.

00:25:14.279 --> 00:25:16.040
Notice finally,

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:20.200
and to walk humbly with thy God.

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:22.600
To walk humbly with thy God.

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:25.600
The word humble is such an important word.

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:28.679
We find it throughout the truth of God's Word.

00:25:28.679 --> 00:25:33.279
This difference between pride and humility.

00:25:33.279 --> 00:25:36.239
God resisteth the proud,

00:25:36.239 --> 00:25:38.720
but He gives grace unto the humble.

00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:40.160
We find here that the Bible says

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:42.799
we're to walk humbly with thy God

00:25:42.799 --> 00:25:45.320
in a humble manner, in a low state or condition.

00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:48.440
Modest submissiveness is the idea of the word.

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:50.440
And I think about my walk with God.

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:53.000
I have asked myself this question

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.839
as I consider the message from Micah here

00:25:55.839 --> 00:25:57.399
in Micah 6 and verse 8

00:25:57.399 --> 00:25:59.200
as he's ministering to these people

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:00.920
that God's called him to minister to.

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:03.720
And I question myself about my own walk.

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:06.399
Am I walking humbly with my God?

00:26:06.399 --> 00:26:08.239
By the way, you can't give that instruction

00:26:08.239 --> 00:26:10.239
to a lost person.

00:26:10.239 --> 00:26:11.279
Right?

00:26:11.279 --> 00:26:15.040
You have to establish the relationship.

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:18.720
Then, you find that you're going to walk with God.

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:21.040
And we understand this thing of walking humbly.

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:24.799
You know it's possible for us to get real prideful

00:26:24.799 --> 00:26:27.760
about our position.

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:29.720
It really is.

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:31.720
It's easy for us to think

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:34.959
we're right and they're wrong.

00:26:34.959 --> 00:26:39.519
Until we remember that we were wrong one time too.

00:26:39.519 --> 00:26:40.839
Right?

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:42.480
I mean, the grace of God.

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:44.519
Think about what He reminded them of

00:26:44.519 --> 00:26:46.559
in verse number 4 of our text of Scripture.

00:26:46.559 --> 00:26:48.720
I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:51.559
and redeemed thee out of the house of servants

00:26:51.559 --> 00:26:54.600
and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.

00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:56.119
And so we think about this truth.

00:26:56.119 --> 00:26:58.959
Listen, He redeemed us.

00:26:58.959 --> 00:27:00.040
Amen?

00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:01.359
We're lost.

00:27:01.359 --> 00:27:04.200
Undone.

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:06.640
But God's grace and His mercy.

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:08.839
Ephesians 2 talks about the fact that He's rich,

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:10.959
God who is rich in mercy.

00:27:10.959 --> 00:27:12.359
Amen?

00:27:12.359 --> 00:27:13.920
And we think about this truth

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:15.720
and we understand about the importance

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:17.720
of walking humbly with my God.

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:19.119
I thought about this.

00:27:19.119 --> 00:27:22.079
Listen, because of our position in Christ,

00:27:22.079 --> 00:27:25.040
we understand that there are many, many benefits

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:27.040
that we receive by our position in Christ.

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:28.959
And we understand that He's blessed us

00:27:28.959 --> 00:27:30.239
with all spiritual blessings.

00:27:30.239 --> 00:27:31.440
We're seated in the heavenlies.

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:37.200
I mean, it's an amazing truth to be a child of the King.

00:27:37.239 --> 00:27:40.000
But we've got to be careful to understand

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:45.200
that because we're blessed with all of those things,

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:48.320
we still need to be humble in our approach

00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:49.880
when we deal with others.

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:52.679
See, it's easy for us to think about,

00:27:52.679 --> 00:27:55.160
well, I have this right and I have that right

00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:57.440
and so on and so forth.

00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:58.600
Walk humble.

00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:05.079
Walk humbly with thy Lord, with thy God.

00:28:05.119 --> 00:28:08.119
Think about the humility of our Savior.

00:28:08.119 --> 00:28:14.200
Did He not exhibit great levels of humility?

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:16.799
In fact, when Paul is speaking about the truth

00:28:16.799 --> 00:28:22.000
of this mind being you which is in Christ Jesus,

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.760
in the book of Philippians,

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:26.160
he's going through that process in the second chapter

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:29.119
and he's beginning to deal with some of that

00:28:29.119 --> 00:28:30.200
which was going on.

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:34.640
If you look at the text immediately preceding

00:28:34.679 --> 00:28:39.000
the apostle going into this example of humility

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.599
in the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:28:40.599 --> 00:28:42.400
he says in Philippians 2,

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:45.760
let nothing be done through strife or vain glory,

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:47.919
but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other

00:28:47.919 --> 00:28:49.840
better than themselves.

00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:51.440
Looking not every man on his own things,

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:52.919
but every man also on the things of others.

00:28:52.919 --> 00:28:55.799
Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus.

00:28:55.799 --> 00:28:57.239
He goes through the whole process.

00:28:57.239 --> 00:29:01.400
We find that it talks about His incarnation

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:06.679
and all that is just the miracle of Christ's birth

00:29:06.679 --> 00:29:09.440
and Him taking on the form of a man coming

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:10.840
and taking the form of a servant,

00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:12.159
likeness of men.

00:29:12.159 --> 00:29:14.000
We find that it says that He humbled Himself

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.479
and became obedient unto death,

00:29:15.479 --> 00:29:17.440
even the death of the cross.

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:19.599
Remember what Jesus did before He went to the cross

00:29:19.599 --> 00:29:21.359
in John 13?

00:29:21.359 --> 00:29:22.679
We know that it wasn't immediately,

00:29:22.679 --> 00:29:24.400
it wasn't the last action that He did

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:26.440
before He went to the cross of Calvary,

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:28.239
but we understand that it was leading right up

00:29:28.239 --> 00:29:30.159
to the time in which Jesus would be arrested

00:29:30.159 --> 00:29:32.320
in the garden and go to the cross of Calvary

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:34.400
and we find that it was there in John 13

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:37.799
that He washed the feet of the disciples.

00:29:37.799 --> 00:29:40.200
What a great example of humility.

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:43.520
He said that He came to serve, to minister,

00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:47.000
not to be ministered unto, but to minister, to serve.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.960
We think about this thing of walking humbly with our God.

00:29:50.919 --> 00:29:55.559
See, when we understand what God has given us to do,

00:29:55.559 --> 00:29:57.799
then we understand, listen, the children of Israel

00:29:57.799 --> 00:30:00.119
during the time, really especially during the time

00:30:00.119 --> 00:30:02.799
of Jotham and Ahaz.

00:30:02.799 --> 00:30:08.539
During the time of Hezekiah and his reign as king, they experienced revival in Judah.

00:30:08.539 --> 00:30:12.519
We understand that during the time of Jotham and Ahaz, there's great wickedness that was

00:30:12.519 --> 00:30:13.519
going on.

00:30:13.519 --> 00:30:18.159
In fact, I've mentioned already how the Bible reveals to us in chapter 16 of 2 Kings how

00:30:18.159 --> 00:30:19.719
that they were offering...

00:30:19.719 --> 00:30:31.359
Ahaz was guilty of giving his firstborn to the fires of Molech, wickedness.

00:30:31.359 --> 00:30:34.599
The prophet says, the Lord hath a controversy with his people.

00:30:34.599 --> 00:30:37.039
Okay, what do we do?

00:30:37.039 --> 00:30:39.399
We bring some offerings?

00:30:39.399 --> 00:30:40.399
Do all these things?

00:30:40.399 --> 00:30:42.479
Is that going to make God happy?

00:30:42.479 --> 00:30:49.879
He says, He hath showed thee, O man, what is good, and what doth the Lord require of

00:30:49.879 --> 00:30:51.079
thee?

00:30:51.079 --> 00:30:59.919
To do justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God.

00:30:59.919 --> 00:31:04.119
Moses gave instruction to the children of Israel before they would enter the land of

00:31:04.119 --> 00:31:05.799
promise.

00:31:05.799 --> 00:31:13.919
Solomon finishes that great book that reveals to us some very important things.

00:31:13.919 --> 00:31:16.159
He says, let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter.

00:31:16.159 --> 00:31:17.159
Fear God, keep His commandments.

00:31:17.159 --> 00:31:20.399
This is the whole duty of man.

00:31:20.399 --> 00:31:27.879
So we understand that God has given us, I'm thankful that He's shown us what is right.

00:31:27.879 --> 00:31:32.839
And oh that God would help us to do right, to do justly.

00:31:32.879 --> 00:31:37.079
In a world that seems to be upside down, amen?

00:31:37.079 --> 00:31:39.199
You're living in the same world I'm living, right?

00:31:39.199 --> 00:31:42.159
Man, it's crazy what's going on in our world today.

00:31:42.159 --> 00:31:51.399
But God says, do right, do right, do justly, love mercy.

00:31:51.399 --> 00:31:57.559
I'm so thankful for God's mercy, oh that we would be merciful, and to walk humbly with

00:31:57.559 --> 00:31:59.319
thy God.

00:31:59.319 --> 00:32:04.119
Amen, God resisteth the proud, gives grace unto the humble.

00:32:04.119 --> 00:32:08.559
Peter says that we're to be clothed with humility.

00:32:08.559 --> 00:32:11.399
What a great truth there in 1 Peter chapter number 5.

00:32:11.399 --> 00:32:14.799
This evening, what doth the Lord require of thee?

00:32:14.799 --> 00:32:18.119
Micah says this to those that he's called to minister.

00:32:18.119 --> 00:32:22.199
Here's what God's shown us, three things, do justly, love mercy, walk humbly with thy

00:32:22.199 --> 00:32:23.199
God.

00:32:23.199 --> 00:32:26.639
Oh that we would learn lessons from this Old Testament prophet.

00:32:26.639 --> 00:32:35.440
I mean, he's prophesying in the 740, 750 BC, through the, right around the turn of

00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:37.440
the century.

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:38.440
That's when he's prophesying.

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:42.279
But there's a lesson for us even still today, amen?

00:32:42.279 --> 00:32:43.639
What doth the Lord require of thee?

00:32:43.639 --> 00:32:46.080
Father, we pray that you'd help us.

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:49.199
Help us, Lord, to do justly.

00:32:49.199 --> 00:32:52.119
Help us, Lord, to love mercy.

00:32:52.119 --> 00:32:55.319
Help us, Lord, to walk humbly with our God.

00:32:55.319 --> 00:32:59.039
We thank you that you are our God.

00:32:59.039 --> 00:33:01.599
We thank you that you're our shield and our buckler.

00:33:01.599 --> 00:33:05.000
We thank you that you're our refuge, our hiding place.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.039
We thank you that you're our strength.

00:33:08.039 --> 00:33:09.039
You're our redeemer.

00:33:09.039 --> 00:33:11.839
You are the creator of all things.

00:33:11.839 --> 00:33:16.879
We thank you that you are King of kings, Lord of lords, the great I am.

00:33:16.879 --> 00:33:23.039
We thank you that you've given us thy word and contained therein you've taught us that

00:33:23.039 --> 00:33:25.080
which would please thee.

00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:28.959
And I pray, God, that you'd help us to be doers of the word.

00:33:28.959 --> 00:33:31.319
Help us to dig into the word of God.

00:33:31.319 --> 00:33:37.639
Help us to not be influenced and persuaded by our society as to what they might call

00:33:37.639 --> 00:33:39.759
right.

00:33:39.759 --> 00:33:45.119
Help us to prove what is acceptable in the sight of the Lord.

00:33:45.119 --> 00:33:49.119
Help us, Lord, to love mercy.

00:33:49.119 --> 00:33:54.639
Help us, God, to walk with you, but to walk humbly with you.

00:33:54.639 --> 00:33:59.639
Understanding is all because of the grace and mercy of God.

00:33:59.639 --> 00:34:04.159
Paul said, I am what I am, the grace of God.

00:34:04.159 --> 00:34:08.399
We thank you and praise you for the work that you've done in our lives.

00:34:08.399 --> 00:34:11.839
We pray, God, that you'd use us to make a difference in the lives of those that we come

00:34:11.839 --> 00:34:18.359
in contact with, Lord, that they'd see Christ in us, the hope of glory.

00:34:18.359 --> 00:34:22.600
Well, thank you for all that you'll do, for it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
