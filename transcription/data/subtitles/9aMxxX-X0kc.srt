1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,119
through 16 this morning, 2 Corinthians chapter 5, verses 14 through 16, and as you're turning

2
00:00:06,119 --> 00:00:10,920
there let me remind you that as we've studied in this fifth chapter of the book of 2 Corinthians

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,739
we've considered up to this point three very important truths.

4
00:00:15,739 --> 00:00:21,319
Number one, we dealt with the reality and the certainty of heaven, and what great truth

5
00:00:21,319 --> 00:00:26,920
that is as we look at the first eight verses of this chapter and we find that Paul uses

6
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:33,119
the phrase for we know, we are confident, we have this assurance to be absent from the

7
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:40,080
body is to be present with the Lord and what joy it brings to the heart of every true believer

8
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:45,439
that knows that they've been saved by the blood of Christ, that heaven is your home.

9
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:48,639
And there are many people today that are going around life and they're wondering, they don't

10
00:00:48,639 --> 00:00:53,360
know what's going to happen when they die, they're not sure, they know that death is

11
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:59,919
a certainty for all man will die, and we understand that, but the reality is that

12
00:00:59,919 --> 00:01:05,839
as believers, those that have been born again, that we have that reason to rejoice because

13
00:01:05,839 --> 00:01:08,839
we have the reality and certainty of heaven.

14
00:01:08,839 --> 00:01:12,760
We then dealt with verse number nine, and we dealt with the importance of living our

15
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,680
lives to please the Lord.

16
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,800
After Paul is talking about having that eternal perspective at the end of chapter four and

17
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:26,120
after he's talking about heaven and the certainty of heaven, he then talks about the importance

18
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:30,760
of living that we might please the Lord, wherefore we labor that whether present or absent, we

19
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:36,839
may be accepted of him and how important it is that we live to please our Savior.

20
00:01:36,839 --> 00:01:40,800
And then two weeks ago, we had a missionary last week, but two weeks ago, we looked at

21
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:45,480
verses 10 down through verse number 13, and we spoke of the subject of the judgment seat

22
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,160
of Christ.

23
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:53,000
And Paul understood that heaven was his home, and he had great confidence and certainty

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,599
of that truth, but we understand that he spoke about, to the church in Corinth, both in the

25
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:03,040
book of 1 Corinthians and then also here in the book of 2 Corinthians, about that bema

26
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,279
seat, that coming day, the judgment seat of the Lord.

27
00:02:07,279 --> 00:02:12,559
When we as believers were stand before him, we said, it's not a judgment, what is it not?

28
00:02:12,559 --> 00:02:17,479
It's not for our sin, but we understand that our works will be tried of what sort they

29
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:19,880
are and he knows our motives.

30
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:25,119
And we mentioned the importance of being able to receive crowns, not for any acknowledgement

31
00:02:25,119 --> 00:02:30,119
or recognition for ourselves, but so that God would receive all glory for he is the

32
00:02:30,119 --> 00:02:35,720
one that has saved us and he is the one who enables us and it will all be for his glory.

33
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:40,479
We come to verse 14 this morning and we find that we, as we continue through the text,

34
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:44,960
we're confronted with a truth that begs a question.

35
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,660
We're confronted with a truth that begs a question.

36
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:53,279
Notice in verse 14, the Bible says, for the love of Christ constraineth us, because we

37
00:02:53,279 --> 00:02:57,639
thus judge that if one died for all, then we're all dead.

38
00:02:57,639 --> 00:03:02,759
And that he died for all that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves,

39
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:06,639
but unto him which died for them and rose again.

40
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:12,000
Wherefore, henceforth, know we no man after the flesh, yea, though we have known Christ

41
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,800
after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more.

42
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:22,279
As we look at this passage of Scripture, these three verses, we find that it's a great truth

43
00:03:22,279 --> 00:03:26,520
that Jesus died for me and that he rose victoriously.

44
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,919
He conquered sin, death, and the grave.

45
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:34,000
There's no doubt in my mind this morning that the truth that Paul mentions in these verses

46
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,720
of Scripture would cause him to rejoice greatly, to understand what Christ did on our behalf,

47
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:45,320
to understand that he paid the debt that we owed that we could never pay, how he would

48
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,800
rejoice greatly.

49
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:52,080
But we find that as we look at the text, as Paul would reflect upon this wonderful truth,

50
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:58,919
he acknowledges the fact that we should therefore live for Jesus.

51
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:01,160
We should live for Jesus.

52
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:05,320
The title for the message this morning is posed as a question.

53
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:10,119
And I posed it the way that I did on purpose because I want every single one of us to ask

54
00:04:10,119 --> 00:04:15,199
ourselves the question, who am I living for?

55
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:17,200
Who am I living for?

56
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,920
Initially as I began to write out the title, I began to write it this way, who are you

57
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,920
living for?

58
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:26,880
But I thought, you know, I don't want to title it that way because I need to answer the question

59
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:33,000
myself personally, but I need each one of you to answer your question, who am I living

60
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
for?

61
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,880
See, if we ask the question, who are you living for, you know what it does?

62
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,359
It gets the attention off of us and on someone else.

63
00:04:40,359 --> 00:04:44,440
And by the way, we like it that way.

64
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,600
Let a man examine himself, I'd rather examine you than myself, you'd rather examine me than

65
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,600
yourself.

66
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,519
But we ask the question, who am I living for?

67
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:55,519
Who am I living for?

68
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,160
As we look at the text of Scripture this morning, if you're taking notes, number one, there's

69
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,279
a conflict that we must acknowledge, a conflict that we must acknowledge.

70
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:08,640
We'll begin looking at verse 15, we'll come back to verse 14 in just a moment.

71
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:13,480
But look with me at verse number 15 as we consider this morning this conflict that each

72
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,480
of us will face.

73
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,839
The Bible says in that he died for all, aren't you thankful for that?

74
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:22,679
He didn't die just for a certain group of people, he died for all and praise the Lord

75
00:05:22,679 --> 00:05:23,679
for that.

76
00:05:23,679 --> 00:05:30,959
And it says that they which live, notice this, should not henceforth live unto themselves,

77
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:36,320
but unto him which died for them and rose again.

78
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,320
So what is the conflict?

79
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:42,079
Well, the reality is that we can live unto ourselves.

80
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:47,279
He uses the phrase here that they should, that they which live should not henceforth,

81
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:50,359
notice this, live unto themselves.

82
00:05:50,359 --> 00:05:54,239
You know, this morning as we think about the question, who am I living for?

83
00:05:54,239 --> 00:05:58,519
There are many people that if they were honest in answering the question this morning, who

84
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:03,160
am I living for, that they would have to say, I'm living for myself.

85
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:08,600
I am living for my own pleasures, I'm living for those things that I think are gonna bring

86
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,760
me the greatest level of enjoyment and of pleasure on this earth.

87
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,420
They're living for themselves.

88
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:22,179
And I tell you that they live for themselves, not only for pleasure, but they live for position.

89
00:06:22,179 --> 00:06:23,880
What position can I have?

90
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,739
What place can I rise to?

91
00:06:25,739 --> 00:06:31,380
What level of prominence may I be able to achieve, to accomplish, to climb a ladder,

92
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,380
so to speak?

93
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:38,059
And we find that there's this conflict because you have the old flesh, you trusted Christ

94
00:06:38,059 --> 00:06:40,980
as your Savior, but you still have the old man.

95
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:44,700
And I'll say to you this morning that the old man still has desires.

96
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:51,500
The old man still has those desires and those realities that we face as human beings being

97
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,579
saved by the grace of God.

98
00:06:53,579 --> 00:07:00,739
There are times in which you, self, wants to be the king of your life.

99
00:07:00,739 --> 00:07:04,980
Many a preacher have said over the years that the greatest enemy that we have is the one

100
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:07,940
that we look in the mirror at every morning.

101
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:12,140
So often we think about the external foes and the external enemies, but the reality

102
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:16,459
is that we oftentimes are our own worst enemy.

103
00:07:16,459 --> 00:07:17,459
Why?

104
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:20,779
Because I want to live for myself.

105
00:07:20,779 --> 00:07:23,299
And in your flesh you want to live for yourself.

106
00:07:23,299 --> 00:07:25,459
You want to do the things that please you.

107
00:07:25,459 --> 00:07:27,140
You want to have that recognition.

108
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:31,059
Listen, why is pride spoken of so often in the Bible?

109
00:07:31,059 --> 00:07:32,820
Why is pride such an issue?

110
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:38,220
I believe it's a great sin that's prevalent in our communities, but even in our churches

111
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,420
pride is so prevalent.

112
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,420
Why?

113
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,220
Because it's a fleshly desire.

114
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:47,779
It feeds our flesh.

115
00:07:47,779 --> 00:07:51,899
We find that there are many that live for themselves and they're seeking to live for

116
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:54,279
comfort.

117
00:07:54,279 --> 00:08:00,579
They think that they may be able to gain some level of comfort by living for themselves

118
00:08:00,579 --> 00:08:02,700
and they just want to do what they want to do.

119
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:09,500
Have you ever heard somebody say, no one can tell me what to do?

120
00:08:09,619 --> 00:08:15,859
Many people live with that mantra, with that idea, but we find that the conflict that we

121
00:08:15,859 --> 00:08:23,339
must acknowledge is that there is this temptation, this reality of living for ourselves.

122
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:30,260
Even as saved people we can get into a rut, we can get into a process where we're living

123
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:37,299
for ourselves, but we find that in the text of Scripture it says that we should not henceforth

124
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:40,940
live unto themselves, but notice, but unto Him.

125
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:47,979
So we live for Jesus, we live to please Him, to honor Him, not me, but Christ.

126
00:08:47,979 --> 00:08:52,059
Remember what John the Baptist said, He must increase and I must decrease.

127
00:08:52,059 --> 00:08:56,940
Truly, John the Baptist had a great following, John the Baptist had a great position, John

128
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:01,500
the Baptist had a race to run and he's the forerunner of Christ and he's the one that

129
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:06,380
would say, behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world, and he had that

130
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:10,580
responsibility, there's a great number of people that followed him, he had many disciples,

131
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:15,340
but when Jesus came on the scene, when he pointed to Jesus, the one who would be the

132
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:19,419
Lamb that would take away the sin of the world, he said, I'm not even worthy to unloose this

133
00:09:19,419 --> 00:09:21,460
shoe latchet.

134
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:25,619
He says, as those religious leaders come to him and they begin to tell him about those

135
00:09:25,619 --> 00:09:33,619
that were following Jesus, that's the context in John chapter 3, he says, He must increase,

136
00:09:33,619 --> 00:09:34,619
but I must decrease.

137
00:09:34,859 --> 00:09:40,580
And see, we're living that life for Christ, we're, we're taking and following the pattern

138
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:45,500
that Jesus spoke of, turn over to Mark chapter number 8 if you will, and notice what Jesus

139
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:50,260
says in Mark chapter number 8.

140
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:55,140
Even as I mentioned Mark 8, some of you already have an idea of the passage that we're looking

141
00:09:55,140 --> 00:10:02,299
to as Jesus would call the people unto Himself, and we find at the end of the chapter, Mark

142
00:10:02,299 --> 00:10:09,459
chapter in verse 34, this great truth is given to us with regard to the crucified life, living

143
00:10:09,459 --> 00:10:12,259
for Jesus.

144
00:10:12,259 --> 00:10:17,579
The Bible says in verse number 34, and when he, Jesus, had called the people unto him

145
00:10:17,579 --> 00:10:24,099
with his disciples also, he said unto them, notice this, whosoever will come after me,

146
00:10:24,099 --> 00:10:31,779
let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.

147
00:10:31,779 --> 00:10:37,299
For whosoever will save his life shall lose it, but whosoever shall lose his life for

148
00:10:37,299 --> 00:10:40,419
my sake and the gospels the same shall save it.

149
00:10:40,419 --> 00:10:44,899
For what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul?

150
00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:47,099
What shall a man give in exchange for his soul?

151
00:10:47,099 --> 00:10:51,179
Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful

152
00:10:51,179 --> 00:10:55,219
generation, of him also shall the Son of Man be ashamed when he cometh in the glory of

153
00:10:55,219 --> 00:10:58,619
his Father with the holy angels.

154
00:10:58,619 --> 00:11:01,739
We can look at this text of Scripture from really two applications.

155
00:11:01,739 --> 00:11:04,459
Number one, if we talk about a lost man, what shall it profit a man if he gain the whole

156
00:11:04,459 --> 00:11:06,419
world and lose his own soul?

157
00:11:06,419 --> 00:11:08,899
There are many people that have that perspective in life.

158
00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:09,899
They've never been redeemed.

159
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:13,499
They're not saved people and they're living for all the pleasures that this world could

160
00:11:13,499 --> 00:11:14,499
afford.

161
00:11:14,499 --> 00:11:17,739
And by the way, Hebrews chapter number 11 does tell us that there's pleasure in sin

162
00:11:17,739 --> 00:11:19,999
for a season.

163
00:11:19,999 --> 00:11:20,999
Does it not?

164
00:11:20,999 --> 00:11:25,659
Moses had that experience and it speaks of it in Hebrews chapter number 11, and we find

165
00:11:25,659 --> 00:11:30,339
that he refused that and he was willing to suffer affliction with the people of God.

166
00:11:30,339 --> 00:11:31,339
Why?

167
00:11:31,339 --> 00:11:34,339
Because he was going to live not for the pleasures of the world, not for the pleasure of sin,

168
00:11:34,339 --> 00:11:37,119
but he's going to live for his God.

169
00:11:37,119 --> 00:11:41,059
We find here that as we look at this passage of Scripture and we could say of the lost

170
00:11:41,059 --> 00:11:45,339
person, listen, what does it matter if you gain all of these things?

171
00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:50,379
What does it matter if you're on the Forbes list of the most wealthy people in all of

172
00:11:50,379 --> 00:11:51,379
the world?

173
00:11:51,379 --> 00:11:58,019
What does it matter if you reach the number one position, but you're lost for all of eternity?

174
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:01,299
You suffer in the lake of fire.

175
00:12:01,299 --> 00:12:07,059
Because I say to you as Christians, there are times in which we too struggle with living

176
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,539
for ourselves instead of living for Him.

177
00:12:09,539 --> 00:12:13,619
And I make the application this morning, what does it matter if we, listen, if we've been

178
00:12:13,619 --> 00:12:18,419
saved by the grace of God, but yet we're living for those same types of things that the world's

179
00:12:18,419 --> 00:12:19,419
living for?

180
00:12:19,419 --> 00:12:24,299
And you say, but I'm going to heaven, yes, but you're going to go to heaven maybe empty-handed.

181
00:12:24,299 --> 00:12:27,979
You're going to go to heaven maybe accumulating a lot of things here on this earth and maybe

182
00:12:27,979 --> 00:12:32,059
having great position and title and so on and so forth, but you might stand at that

183
00:12:32,059 --> 00:12:36,599
judgment seat of Christ with nothing to offer your Savior.

184
00:12:36,599 --> 00:12:39,499
No crown to cast back at His feet.

185
00:12:39,499 --> 00:12:44,299
As we read, speaking of the judgment seat of Christ in our last message here in 2 Corinthians

186
00:12:44,299 --> 00:12:46,099
chapter number 5.

187
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:50,479
So the Lord gives us this great pattern here in Mark chapter number 8 in verse 34, He gives

188
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:52,899
us the, the progression, if you will.

189
00:12:52,899 --> 00:12:56,139
So often we talk about the importance of following Jesus.

190
00:12:56,139 --> 00:13:01,759
In fact, we sing songs about following Jesus, I will follow, follow on, all of these songs

191
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:05,579
that we sing and we understand the importance of following Jesus.

192
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:09,579
I have decided to follow Jesus.

193
00:13:09,579 --> 00:13:11,479
No turning back, no turning back.

194
00:13:11,479 --> 00:13:13,379
Is that not what the songwriter said?

195
00:13:13,379 --> 00:13:17,919
Is that not the song that we sing with children and VBS and so on and so forth?

196
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:24,459
But listen, as adult people, as senior saints, we ought to still be singing, I have decided

197
00:13:24,459 --> 00:13:26,659
to follow Jesus.

198
00:13:26,659 --> 00:13:28,159
Amen?

199
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:30,119
It's not just for the children's church.

200
00:13:30,119 --> 00:13:32,599
It's not just for the vacation Bible school kids.

201
00:13:32,599 --> 00:13:33,599
It's for us as well.

202
00:13:33,599 --> 00:13:36,319
I've decided to follow Jesus.

203
00:13:36,319 --> 00:13:40,719
After all that He's done for me, oh, that I would live for Him.

204
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:44,459
And we find that there are oftentimes people talking about following Jesus.

205
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:48,979
Listen, if you don't follow the prescribed pattern that's set forth in Mark 8 in verse

206
00:13:48,979 --> 00:13:54,259
34, you're going to struggle following Jesus because here's the reality is that you must

207
00:13:54,259 --> 00:13:57,839
first deny myself.

208
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:03,859
If you try following Jesus but you've never died to self, you're divided and you're going

209
00:14:03,859 --> 00:14:05,499
to struggle.

210
00:14:05,499 --> 00:14:08,219
It's going to be a battle every single day.

211
00:14:08,219 --> 00:14:09,219
Why?

212
00:14:09,219 --> 00:14:10,439
Because you've not died to self.

213
00:14:10,439 --> 00:14:12,179
And so guess what self wants?

214
00:14:12,179 --> 00:14:14,979
Self wants what self wants.

215
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:17,219
Amen?

216
00:14:17,219 --> 00:14:19,159
Self doesn't want to suffer.

217
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:20,679
Self wants convenience.

218
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:21,679
Self wants comfort.

219
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:22,679
Am I right?

220
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:27,679
And so we must deny ourselves.

221
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:30,879
Paul said it this way, I am crucified with Christ.

222
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:33,759
He said it this way, I die daily.

223
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:35,679
I've denied myself.

224
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:37,919
Not I, but Christ.

225
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:40,239
Not I, but Christ.

226
00:14:40,239 --> 00:14:43,479
We find that he says not only that we're to deny ourselves, but number two, he says

227
00:14:43,479 --> 00:14:47,239
that we're to take up his cross.

228
00:14:47,239 --> 00:14:49,479
Wow.

229
00:14:49,479 --> 00:14:57,699
The cross represents for us many things, but we find that the cross represents first death.

230
00:14:57,699 --> 00:15:01,239
I'm thankful that my Lord and Savior died upon that cross.

231
00:15:01,239 --> 00:15:04,000
This morning we have a cross in our baptistry.

232
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,039
Every time you come in here, you see that cross, but you'll notice that Jesus isn't

233
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:08,039
on that cross.

234
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:09,039
Why?

235
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:10,599
Because he's suffering sin, death, and the grave.

236
00:15:10,599 --> 00:15:11,599
Hallelujah.

237
00:15:11,599 --> 00:15:12,599
I serve a risen Savior.

238
00:15:12,599 --> 00:15:14,479
He's not on the cross anymore.

239
00:15:14,479 --> 00:15:19,440
At Christmas time, you'll see these little portrayals of Jesus in a manger at Bethlehem.

240
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,879
Listen, he's not there anymore either.

241
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,039
Hallelujah.

242
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:25,199
I'm thankful for the truth of the incarnation.

243
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:31,199
I'm thankful that Jesus became flesh, that he came to this world and he became flesh,

244
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:32,199
God in flesh.

245
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:33,559
I'm thankful for that.

246
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:38,279
I'm thankful that he went to the cross because it was necessary for my salvation, for your

247
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:40,000
salvation.

248
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,959
The incarnation and the crucifixion, they're great truths and realities.

249
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:51,679
They're absolutely essential to Christian faith and doctrine.

250
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:54,879
He's not in the manger and he's not on the cross.

251
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:58,679
He is seated at the right hand of the Father.

252
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:00,279
He's ascended.

253
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:04,559
He is waiting to come back for us, amen?

254
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:06,359
He is in his exalted position.

255
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:11,119
Listen, when he comes the second time, he's not coming as a babe in the manger.

256
00:16:11,119 --> 00:16:15,440
When he comes the second time, he's coming as the conquering king of Judah.

257
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,319
And hallelujah, that's my God.

258
00:16:18,319 --> 00:16:23,359
But I think about this thing of taking up our cross, it's dying to self.

259
00:16:23,359 --> 00:16:27,839
Many years ago, I think Holly and I, we've been married for 24 years, so it was somewhere

260
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:32,479
right after we got married, my mother-in-law had this idea that at Christmas time, that

261
00:16:32,479 --> 00:16:36,199
everyone would give a gift that was something that they made.

262
00:16:36,199 --> 00:16:40,000
Now, if any of you know me real well, I'm not real crafty.

263
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,639
And so all of a sudden, I'm sitting around and I'm thinking, so I'm supposed to make

264
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,359
something that I'm going to give to all of these people.

265
00:16:46,359 --> 00:16:50,359
What in the world am I going to do?

266
00:16:50,359 --> 00:16:55,099
And I began to think about it, I began to kind of pray about it, and what could I do?

267
00:16:55,099 --> 00:16:58,959
And I made a bookmark, I have a, it's not this bookmark, but it was a little bit bigger

268
00:16:58,959 --> 00:16:59,959
than this.

269
00:16:59,959 --> 00:17:02,559
I just had this in my coat pocket this morning.

270
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:07,759
But I made this bookmark, and I had Galatians 2.20 written out, typed out on one side,

271
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:14,119
and on the other side I had this phrase, dying to self is the prerequisite for the victorious

272
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:16,220
Christian life.

273
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:20,599
If you want victory in your life, you better die to self.

274
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:24,599
You've got to die to self.

275
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:32,539
Denying myself, taking up my cross, and then the Bible says, follow me, follow me.

276
00:17:32,539 --> 00:17:38,179
You know, when I've denied myself, when I've taken up my cross, I can follow Jesus, singular

277
00:17:38,179 --> 00:17:40,579
focus.

278
00:17:40,579 --> 00:17:41,940
God doesn't want a divided heart.

279
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:45,819
How many times we read about the kings that they, that they did this, but not with their

280
00:17:45,819 --> 00:17:49,559
whole heart, right?

281
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:53,699
You see this phraseology in the Bible, listen, God wants all of your heart.

282
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:54,699
He wants all of you.

283
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:55,699
He wants all of me.

284
00:17:55,699 --> 00:18:00,659
But when we look at this passage in 2 Corinthians chapter 5 and we seek to answer the question,

285
00:18:00,659 --> 00:18:02,259
who am I living for?

286
00:18:02,259 --> 00:18:05,059
We must acknowledge this morning that there's a conflict.

287
00:18:05,059 --> 00:18:08,779
We must acknowledge this morning that you struggle, that I struggle every day of our

288
00:18:08,779 --> 00:18:09,779
lives.

289
00:18:09,779 --> 00:18:13,859
Am I going to live for myself or am I going to live for Jesus?

290
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:18,419
And it's not something that you made a decision on some day in the past and said, I'm going

291
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:22,779
to live for Jesus, and then you never have to revisit that choice.

292
00:18:22,779 --> 00:18:26,739
Because the reality is that every day of your life, and in fact, many moments during the

293
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:30,619
days of your life, there's going to be something that comes up that you could make that decision,

294
00:18:30,619 --> 00:18:34,220
okay, I'm living for Jesus, but now I'm living for self.

295
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,659
I'm living for Jesus, and now I'm living for self.

296
00:18:36,659 --> 00:18:39,380
It can go back and forth.

297
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:45,820
The reality this morning is that we must see that there is this conflict, and even as saved

298
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:49,339
people, that we ought to know better.

299
00:18:49,339 --> 00:18:53,899
I think this morning, if we would be honest and if we would be willing to come and stand

300
00:18:53,899 --> 00:19:00,299
and give testimony, that each of us could say that at some time in my Christian life,

301
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:07,979
however long I've been saved, there has been at least one day that I didn't live for Jesus,

302
00:19:07,979 --> 00:19:14,659
that I was living for myself, that I was living for myself.

303
00:19:14,659 --> 00:19:15,940
We note the conflict.

304
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:18,659
Number two, I want you to consider some things.

305
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:22,219
There's a conflict, but then there's some consideration.

306
00:19:22,219 --> 00:19:26,919
Notice with me, really, three thoughts from these three verses of Scripture on what it

307
00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:28,380
is that we should consider.

308
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:32,539
Number one, we should consider Christ's love.

309
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:39,179
In verse number 14, the Bible says, for the love of Christ constraineth us.

310
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,859
That word literally means to hold together.

311
00:19:41,859 --> 00:19:45,940
It means to hold together lest it fall to pieces.

312
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:48,659
Now, think about that just for a moment.

313
00:19:48,659 --> 00:19:50,779
They would use it in binding of sheaf.

314
00:19:50,779 --> 00:19:55,700
They would use that phraseology, the same word and that same idea where they would bind

315
00:19:55,700 --> 00:20:00,299
them together and they would keep them together so that they would be held and pressed together

316
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,299
so that they wouldn't fall apart so they could be...

317
00:20:02,299 --> 00:20:05,039
easily transportable, and we find here that he says,

318
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,619
the love of Christ constraineth us.

319
00:20:07,619 --> 00:20:10,499
Yes, I believe that there's some aspect to this word

320
00:20:10,499 --> 00:20:13,099
also having that compelling feature

321
00:20:13,099 --> 00:20:15,899
and that motivation idea, and it's there

322
00:20:15,899 --> 00:20:18,699
and we understand that, but we see that here

323
00:20:18,699 --> 00:20:21,579
we must remember the love of Christ.

324
00:20:21,579 --> 00:20:23,919
Listen, it's his love that sent him to the cross.

325
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,499
It's the love that kept him on the cross.

326
00:20:26,499 --> 00:20:29,499
We find that for God so loved the world,

327
00:20:29,499 --> 00:20:32,019
but God commendeth his love toward us,

328
00:20:32,019 --> 00:20:34,579
and that while we're yet sinners, Christ died for us.

329
00:20:34,579 --> 00:20:36,779
The reality that Paul says to the church,

330
00:20:36,779 --> 00:20:39,419
to the folks in Rome, what can separate us

331
00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:41,939
from the love of God?

332
00:20:41,939 --> 00:20:46,579
Keep yourselves, Jude is telling us, in the love of God.

333
00:20:48,099 --> 00:20:49,779
What happened to the church at Ephesus?

334
00:20:49,779 --> 00:20:53,259
Well, they left their first love.

335
00:20:53,259 --> 00:20:56,899
This morning, are you reminded every day of your life

336
00:20:56,899 --> 00:21:00,419
that God loves you, and that it's the love of Christ

337
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:02,059
that constrains you?

338
00:21:03,939 --> 00:21:07,419
Listen, when we consider this truth, when we understand,

339
00:21:07,419 --> 00:21:09,899
listen, you ever hear somebody say,

340
00:21:09,899 --> 00:21:11,659
things are falling apart in my life?

341
00:21:11,659 --> 00:21:13,899
Somebody might say, my life is falling apart.

342
00:21:13,899 --> 00:21:17,019
Listen, it's God that keeps us together.

343
00:21:18,859 --> 00:21:22,739
It's the truth of God's word that we regularly go back to

344
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:26,219
that gives us the joy and the peace.

345
00:21:26,219 --> 00:21:27,299
It's his love.

346
00:21:28,219 --> 00:21:31,659
I'm thankful that he actively loves us.

347
00:21:32,819 --> 00:21:35,939
We sing the songs, we understand the importance

348
00:21:35,939 --> 00:21:37,699
of being reminded of God's love,

349
00:21:37,699 --> 00:21:42,699
and there's many songs that speak about God's love.

350
00:21:42,779 --> 00:21:46,259
And can it be, what a great song,

351
00:21:47,819 --> 00:21:52,819
that thou, my God, didst die for me.

352
00:21:52,939 --> 00:21:53,779
For me.

353
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:55,739
How can it be?

354
00:21:56,859 --> 00:21:59,099
Amazing love, for sure.

355
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:02,179
Jesus loves even me.

356
00:22:03,259 --> 00:22:05,259
Wonderful things in the Bible, I see.

357
00:22:06,259 --> 00:22:10,139
But this is the dearest, that Jesus loves me.

358
00:22:11,019 --> 00:22:13,139
I hope this morning you never get over the fact

359
00:22:13,139 --> 00:22:16,219
that God loves you, and that he loves you

360
00:22:16,219 --> 00:22:17,539
with an unconditional love.

361
00:22:17,539 --> 00:22:19,979
He loves you with an everlasting love.

362
00:22:19,979 --> 00:22:22,739
There's nothing that can separate you from God's love.

363
00:22:23,779 --> 00:22:26,899
And when you're reminded of God's love for you,

364
00:22:26,899 --> 00:22:30,939
it ought to compel you and motivate you to live for Jesus.

365
00:22:30,939 --> 00:22:33,499
We consider his love, we consider the fact

366
00:22:33,499 --> 00:22:34,659
that he died for us.

367
00:22:34,659 --> 00:22:37,579
We see it, it's the second truth that we see here

368
00:22:37,579 --> 00:22:41,459
in verse number 14 and 15, because we thus judge

369
00:22:41,459 --> 00:22:43,819
that if one, speaking of the Lord Jesus Christ,

370
00:22:43,819 --> 00:22:46,619
died for all, then we're all dead.

371
00:22:46,619 --> 00:22:48,379
We were all dead.

372
00:22:48,379 --> 00:22:49,379
You say, no, I was alive.

373
00:22:49,379 --> 00:22:51,139
No, you were dead spiritually.

374
00:22:51,139 --> 00:22:53,299
You were alive physically, but you were dead spiritually.

375
00:22:53,299 --> 00:22:55,979
And we understand that Paul mentions that in Ephesians 2.

376
00:22:55,979 --> 00:22:57,219
You don't need to turn there, but it says,

377
00:22:57,219 --> 00:22:59,219
and you hath he quickened to make alive

378
00:22:59,219 --> 00:23:01,699
who were dead in trespasses and sins.

379
00:23:01,699 --> 00:23:03,619
Ephesians 2 and verse number 1.

380
00:23:03,619 --> 00:23:04,459
I was dead.

381
00:23:06,579 --> 00:23:07,419
We were dead.

382
00:23:08,739 --> 00:23:11,659
In fact, Ephesians 2 goes on to continue mentioning

383
00:23:11,659 --> 00:23:14,899
we all had the same position.

384
00:23:14,899 --> 00:23:16,339
This was our conversation.

385
00:23:16,339 --> 00:23:17,739
There's nothing different about any of us.

386
00:23:18,099 --> 00:23:20,859
We were all dead in our trespasses and sins.

387
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:23,019
And so it says that he died for all.

388
00:23:23,019 --> 00:23:25,099
I'm so thankful for the Bible truth

389
00:23:25,099 --> 00:23:27,859
that God died for all the world.

390
00:23:27,859 --> 00:23:30,659
There are some that would teach that he only died

391
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,179
for a certain group of people.

392
00:23:32,179 --> 00:23:34,059
I do not find that biblically.

393
00:23:34,059 --> 00:23:37,739
You find that throughout the Bible that his death

394
00:23:37,739 --> 00:23:41,079
was substitutionary and is sufficient for all mankind.

395
00:23:41,079 --> 00:23:43,939
We find that the Bible says in 1 John 2,

396
00:23:43,939 --> 00:23:47,179
what a great verse of scripture that many people will take

397
00:23:47,179 --> 00:23:49,899
and they'll try to explain away other verses.

398
00:23:49,899 --> 00:23:52,779
But I come to 1 John 2 and I've had this conversation

399
00:23:52,779 --> 00:23:55,979
repeatedly with people where the Bible says this,

400
00:23:55,979 --> 00:23:58,419
that in verse number 2, and he, speaking of Christ,

401
00:23:58,419 --> 00:24:02,859
is the propitiation for our sins and not for ours only,

402
00:24:02,859 --> 00:24:06,259
but also for the sins of the whole world.

403
00:24:08,819 --> 00:24:11,339
He's our mercy seat, our covering.

404
00:24:11,339 --> 00:24:12,259
He took my place.

405
00:24:12,259 --> 00:24:15,839
He died for me and he died for you.

406
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:18,319
Listen this morning, when we consider the fact

407
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:22,679
that he died for me, shouldn't I at least live for him?

408
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,440
If he was willing to die for me,

409
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,239
if he was willing to die for you,

410
00:24:27,239 --> 00:24:29,759
shouldn't we at least live for him?

411
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:32,919
The third truth that we see is what is our view of Christ?

412
00:24:32,919 --> 00:24:34,839
In verse 16, it's a verse of scripture

413
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:37,720
that Paul is sharing with us here.

414
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,079
And he says, wherefore, henceforth,

415
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:41,359
know we no man after the flesh.

416
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:43,959
Yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh,

417
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:46,479
yet now henceforth, know we him no more.

418
00:24:46,479 --> 00:24:48,399
It can be a little confusing, this verse of scripture,

419
00:24:48,399 --> 00:24:50,199
but let me help you understand,

420
00:24:50,199 --> 00:24:52,759
as I've meditated upon this and thought through this

421
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:55,720
this week and previously, and just really looking

422
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,679
at what's taking place here, Paul is saying,

423
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:01,359
listen, my view of Christ has drastically changed

424
00:25:02,239 --> 00:25:06,639
from before I got saved to now that I am saved.

425
00:25:06,639 --> 00:25:09,919
See, Paul, there's little doubt in my mind

426
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:13,659
that Paul would have known who Jesus was.

427
00:25:14,399 --> 00:25:16,759
He would have known who Jesus was.

428
00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:21,119
He would have known Christ the man, Jesus Christ the man.

429
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:22,319
He would have known him.

430
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:27,479
Maybe he met him, maybe he heard of some miracles.

431
00:25:27,479 --> 00:25:29,679
We don't know, the Bible doesn't go into all the details,

432
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:31,879
but we do know that all the Jewish men

433
00:25:31,879 --> 00:25:34,359
would come to Jerusalem three times a year.

434
00:25:35,199 --> 00:25:36,879
Jesus was there regularly.

435
00:25:36,879 --> 00:25:38,799
And by the way, he performed miracles,

436
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:42,519
and Paul had trained at the feet of Gamaliel.

437
00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:45,039
Paul was a religious leader.

438
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:47,339
I don't know what interactions they had,

439
00:25:47,339 --> 00:25:50,199
but what I want you to understand that Paul,

440
00:25:50,199 --> 00:25:54,239
now that he's converted, he has a completely different view

441
00:25:54,239 --> 00:25:56,319
of who Jesus Christ is.

442
00:25:56,319 --> 00:25:59,599
Prior to his salvation, prior to his conversion

443
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:02,279
in Acts chapter nine, he just thought of Christ

444
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:03,159
as a mere man.

445
00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:06,519
He thought of Christ maybe as a phony, as a fake,

446
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:08,839
as an imposter, whatever he would have thought of.

447
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:11,720
Why, because he's going out to kill any of those

448
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:14,199
to imprison and to commit to death

449
00:26:14,199 --> 00:26:17,299
those that were of that way, Acts chapter nine.

450
00:26:18,479 --> 00:26:23,479
But now, but now he sees Christ in a whole different way.

451
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:27,239
He understands that what happened there

452
00:26:27,239 --> 00:26:31,000
at the cross of Calvary, he understands that at that cross

453
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,599
that Jesus was dying for him.

454
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:36,919
He would have been familiar with the fact

455
00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:39,720
that it was Barabbas that was supposed to die on that cross,

456
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:43,039
that the other two that were dying alongside Jesus,

457
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:44,879
that the third was for Barabbas,

458
00:26:44,879 --> 00:26:48,039
but no, the people said, release him and crucify Christ.

459
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:51,039
And I don't know what place Paul would have had

460
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:53,839
in all of that, but Paul now understands

461
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:58,079
that he died for me and he loves me.

462
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:00,599
And Paul's perspective, his view of Christ

463
00:27:00,599 --> 00:27:03,799
is completely transformed.

464
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:07,559
I wonder this morning, can you recall what you thought

465
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:10,679
about Jesus before you got saved?

466
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:14,399
Can you recall this morning your view of Christ

467
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:17,679
before you trusted him as your personal Lord and savior?

468
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,119
Depending on your background,

469
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:21,000
depending on how you had been taught,

470
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,000
you have varied ideas about who Jesus was or who he is.

471
00:27:26,239 --> 00:27:31,239
But now as a believer, man, I have a different view

472
00:27:32,239 --> 00:27:34,039
of who Christ is.

473
00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:38,919
He's not just mere man, he's God in flesh.

474
00:27:38,919 --> 00:27:41,440
He loves me and he died for me.

475
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,839
And so Paul is saying, listen, there's a conflict

476
00:27:44,839 --> 00:27:46,919
and we must acknowledge that this morning,

477
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:48,759
but there's some things to consider.

478
00:27:48,759 --> 00:27:51,919
I'm reminded of a song, you don't need to turn there,

479
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,639
but I just wanna read a couple of verses of this song.

480
00:27:54,639 --> 00:27:56,959
It's number 694 in our song book.

481
00:27:56,959 --> 00:27:59,119
You can turn there if you'd like.

482
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:03,759
And in this song, it is said that the one

483
00:28:04,479 --> 00:28:08,599
who wrote this song, that she went into a place

484
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:11,359
and had been struggling with really some of the things

485
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:14,479
she had been taught about salvation and Christianity.

486
00:28:14,479 --> 00:28:17,639
And she was struggling and having some doubts in her life

487
00:28:17,639 --> 00:28:19,159
is what the story says.

488
00:28:19,159 --> 00:28:24,159
And she went in and she saw a picture on the wall

489
00:28:24,239 --> 00:28:28,879
that was a depiction of the cross of Calvary.

490
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:34,000
And when she saw that, it had such a deep impact upon her

491
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,919
that she sat down and wrote this song.

492
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:39,760
I gave my life for thee.

493
00:28:41,959 --> 00:28:46,559
I gave my life for thee, my precious blood I shed,

494
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:51,559
that thou might ransom be and quickened from the dead.

495
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,880
I gave, I gave my life for thee.

496
00:28:56,719 --> 00:29:01,719
And she asked this question, what has thou given for me?

497
00:29:03,479 --> 00:29:06,279
Jesus, as she's writing this, it's Jesus that's saying,

498
00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:08,080
I gave my life for thee.

499
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,320
And then Jesus saying, what have you given for me?

500
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,440
The second verse, my father's house of light,

501
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,519
my glory circled throne.

502
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:19,959
I left for earthly night, for wandering sad and alone.

503
00:29:19,959 --> 00:29:21,359
He left the glory of heaven.

504
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:23,799
He's God.

505
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:24,640
He's God.

506
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:28,959
You read John 17, our memory verse for the month of March,

507
00:29:28,959 --> 00:29:30,880
2 Corinthians 8, 9.

508
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,239
He became poor for us.

509
00:29:33,239 --> 00:29:37,640
He left the throne of heaven, the glory that he had.

510
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:40,599
He said, I left, I left it all for thee.

511
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:45,239
Hast thou left aught for me?

512
00:29:45,239 --> 00:29:46,640
I know it's a song.

513
00:29:47,559 --> 00:29:49,719
It's not Bible, it's a song.

514
00:29:49,719 --> 00:29:53,080
But oh my, what a song it is.

515
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:56,320
The third verse, I suffered much for thee, did he not?

516
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,279
Peter speaks of in 1 Peter 5,

517
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:02,200
about being an eyewitness of the sufferings of Christ.

518
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:08,400
I suffered much for thee, more than thy tongue can tell."

519
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:12,080
Isn't that an interesting statement that the songwriter writes?

520
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,680
We can't fully understand all that Christ suffered for us.

521
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:22,200
The end verse of this 2 Corinthians 5 that we'll look at in a few weeks, He hath made

522
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:26,720
Him to be sin for us.

523
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:32,240
I can't fully comprehend that level of suffering.

524
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:41,040
Of bitterest agony, to rescue thee from hell, I've borne, I've borne it all for thee.

525
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:44,480
What hast thou borne for me?

526
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:52,280
Verse 4, and I have brought to thee, down from my home above, salvation full and free,

527
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:55,000
my pardon and my love.

528
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:00,800
I bring, I bring rich gifts to thee.

529
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:05,320
What hast thou brought to me?

530
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:11,400
What a song, what a song.

531
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:17,920
The songwriter understood something that we're preaching about here this morning.

532
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:23,200
In 2 Corinthians 5, 14-16, I don't know the exact verses of Scripture that God was using

533
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:28,240
in and through her life at the time of writing that song, but oh, when we look at this passage

534
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,920
as Paul is writing to this church in Corinth, we know some things about the church in Corinth.

535
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:41,120
Man, they're a church that needed to understand that they need to live for Christ.

536
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:47,720
The conflict, the consideration, I finish up this morning with a choice.

537
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:53,720
You know, the facts have been presented as Paul lays it out here.

538
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:57,240
We're all dead, but Christ died for us.

539
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:01,920
We should not live for ourselves, we should live for Him.

540
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:06,280
He loves us, He died for us, He offers this to us.

541
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:12,800
The facts are presented, but Paul now is going to kind of lay it out as we look at this passage.

542
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:17,160
He doesn't ask him the question, but I said that by way of introduction this morning,

543
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:21,760
I said that the truth that is given begs a question.

544
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,800
Who am I living for?

545
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,120
There's a choice to be made.

546
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,800
A choice that every child of God has to make.

547
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:32,400
Listen, there's a choice for salvation.

548
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,160
Amen?

549
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:40,880
He came to His own, His own received Him not, but as many as received Him, to them gave He power

550
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,880
to become the sons of God, John 1.

551
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:48,440
Listen, there's a choice on whether you're going to trust Christ as your Savior or not.

552
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:58,560
Many a time I've presented the gospel to individuals that said their choice was one of rejection.

553
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:02,320
How glorious it is when someone receives that gift.

554
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:08,040
But can I tell you this morning that that's a one-time decision that you make,

555
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,560
to trust Christ as your Savior.

556
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:13,520
He tells us that He gives us eternal life.

557
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,400
He tells us that we'll never perish.

558
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:19,360
He tells us that we're secure in the hand of God, that we have an inheritance that is

559
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,880
reserved in heaven for us.

560
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:27,680
I mean, the truth of eternal security is such a precious reality.

561
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:32,360
The choice that you now have as a believer, listen, if you've never been saved this morning,

562
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:36,280
your choice is to get saved, to trust Christ as your Savior.

563
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:40,560
But for every child of God this morning, you know what our choice is, our decision, is

564
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,520
our, who are we going to live for?

565
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:46,400
Am I living for myself?

566
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,640
Am I living for Jesus?

567
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,560
You know, there's some people that say, well, I want to offer another idea.

568
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,080
I'm living for my spouse.

569
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,680
I'm living for my children.

570
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:59,600
I'm living for my, no, no, you're to live for Jesus.

571
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,600
Amen?

572
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:04,160
Live for Jesus.

573
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:08,040
Paul had already made his choice.

574
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,920
Paul had already made his choice.

575
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:14,040
We sang the song this morning, who is on the Lord's side?

576
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:19,600
By the way, I love it when songs just mesh so well with the message.

577
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,920
Who is on the Lord's side?

578
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:25,760
You know who's speaking and that's Moses, all right?

579
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,680
Exodus chapter 32 takes place and all the sin, remember Aaron, they got that golden

580
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:34,160
calf and here be thy gods and so on and so forth and Joshua and Moses come down and

581
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:37,640
Joshua stands there and says, who is on the, or Moses said, who's on the Lord's side?

582
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:38,640
Let them come after me.

583
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:39,640
It was a choice.

584
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:43,920
It was a choice that they had to make.

585
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,320
This morning we have a choice.

586
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,400
Paul made his choice.

587
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,160
Paul had drawn the line in the sand.

588
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:51,040
Paul had boldly proclaimed and declared his choice.

589
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,040
How do we know that?

590
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:55,040
Galatians 2.20, I am crucified with Christ.

591
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,559
Nevertheless I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live

592
00:34:58,559 --> 00:34:59,559
in the flesh.

593
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:04,360
I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me.

594
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,920
Paul had made it known.

595
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:11,400
Paul says to the church in Philippi in Philippians 1.21, for to me to live is Christ and to die

596
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,720
is gain.

597
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:17,880
Paul as he writes here in 2 Corinthians chapter 5, he'd already spoken about heaven.

598
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,779
He'd already dealt with the reality and the certainty of heaven.

599
00:35:20,779 --> 00:35:25,080
He knew that he was going to go and be and live with the Lord for all of eternity.

600
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:29,920
But the question this morning is not, who are you going to live with for all of eternity?

601
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,120
For we know if we're saved that we will live with Christ.

602
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:40,800
The question this morning is this, will I live for Christ today?

603
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:45,080
I will live with him for eternity.

604
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:49,160
But will I live for him today?

605
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,960
What a question.

606
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:57,680
What a question.

607
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,320
Paul says for me to live is Christ.

608
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,680
Man, what is he saying?

609
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,680
It's not about me.

610
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,680
It's not about Paul.

611
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,680
It's not about what I want.

612
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:11,040
It's about what Christ wants.

613
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,480
It's about what pleases him.

614
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,680
Paul, you're going on another journey.

615
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,680
Paul, you're going over there.

616
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,880
Don't you know those people hate you?

617
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,880
They don't want to hear the gospel.

618
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:24,800
They're going to…Paul said, not me, but Christ.

619
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:29,000
Not me, but Christ.

620
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:35,400
And I want you to consider this morning the wonderful reality from this portion of Scripture

621
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:40,360
as we couple it all together, these first really sixteen verses.

622
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:44,440
We'll deal with verse seventeen next week, and it's a familiar verse of Scripture,

623
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:47,279
but we look at these first sixteen verses.

624
00:36:47,279 --> 00:36:50,320
And I've said it already, but I want it to just sink in this morning before we have

625
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,520
our time of invitation.

626
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:58,800
If you're saved this morning, you will live with Christ forever.

627
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,720
Do you believe that this morning?

628
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,360
I'm saying do you really believe that this morning?

629
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,360
There's like four amens.

630
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,559
I hope there's more that believe that this morning.

631
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:11,480
You're going to live with him forever.

632
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,480
How do we know that?

633
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,760
Well, John 14.

634
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,760
Let not your heart be troubled.

635
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,760
You believe in God.

636
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,760
Believe also in me.

637
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,760
In my Father's house are many mansions.

638
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,720
If it were not so, I would have told you.

639
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:25,800
I go to prepare a place for you that, and if I go, I'll come again and receive you.

640
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,800
What does it say?

641
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,640
And to myself, that where I am, there ye may be also.

642
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,559
Is that not what it says?

643
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:38,440
First Thessalonians chapter four, we're going to, then they which are alive and remain shall

644
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:41,440
be caught up to meet the Lord in the clouds, right?

645
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:45,240
So forever we will be with the Lord.

646
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,320
Is that not what the Bible teaches?

647
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,880
Do you believe that this morning?

648
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:52,840
If you're saved this morning, you're going to live with him forever.

649
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:56,680
Can't wait.

650
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:59,480
Hallelujah.

651
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:06,720
If you're not saved this morning, listen, if you're not saved this morning, you will

652
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:14,600
live separated from him forever in a place called the lake of fire.

653
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:19,880
It's often referred to as hell, but the Bible tells us that death and hell are cast in the

654
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,680
lake of fire.

655
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:25,440
That's the eternal place of judgment.

656
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:30,000
The Bible tells us of hell that it's a place where the worm dieth not.

657
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
It's not annihilation.

658
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,840
It's separation from God for all of eternity.

659
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,200
So if you're not saved this morning, today is the day of salvation.

660
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:44,280
In fact, Paul says that in second Corinthians chapter six, behold, today is the day of salvation.

661
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,919
If you're not saved today, the choice for you is to get saved.

662
00:38:48,919 --> 00:38:53,640
But if we believe this morning, and I shared the verses with you, that we will live with

663
00:38:53,640 --> 00:39:07,080
Christ forever, the question, the question is will you live for Christ today?

664
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:11,480
Will you live for Christ today?

665
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:20,880
You're going to live with Him forever, but will you live for Him today?

666
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,919
We got to ask ourselves the question, who am I living for?

667
00:39:24,919 --> 00:39:26,919
Who am I living for?

668
00:39:26,919 --> 00:39:28,440
I know where we stand today.

669
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:34,160
I know where we're located, and I understand the area that we're in in Northern Virginia

670
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:40,859
and the pressures of life and so many people living for so many different things and how

671
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:46,540
that can influence, the culture can influence a church.

672
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:51,540
And all of a sudden, we can get a little distracted on what I'm living for.

673
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:57,780
Oh, God wants to get our attention today.

674
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:59,700
Who am I living for?

675
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:00,700
I got to ask that.

676
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,220
Listen, I got to deal with this all week.

677
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:10,260
as God dealt with me. You get it just for 50 minutes. I had to deal with it all week.

678
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:15,940
And I hope you deal with it all next week. And the week after that, that we remember

679
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:25,820
who am I living for? Who am I living for? Because He saved me and I had to live for

680
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:32,060
Him. I shouldn't live for myself. I don't live for my wife. I don't live for my kids.

681
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:38,660
I love my wife. I love my kids. I love my, I got grandkids now. Love them. But I don't

682
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:44,980
live for them. I live for Jesus. And if I live for Jesus, I can be the husband and the

683
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:51,220
father and the grandfather that I'm supposed to be. But if I start living for them, everything

684
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:59,820
gets out of kilter. It gets all whacked out. I got to live for Jesus. Who am I living for?

685
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:06,120
Father we love you. Thank you for loving us. Thank you for the text of scripture. Thank

686
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:12,740
you for the reality that we'll live with you forever. If there's one that's not saved,

687
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:17,780
I pray that today they'd get saved. They'd recognize that you loved them and you died

688
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:25,180
for them. You took their place so that they could be saved. God, I ask that you would

689
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:33,860
help me and every other believer in this room, tuned in via live stream, that we would

690
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:41,380
search our hearts and honestly answer the question, who am I living for? Will I live

691
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:50,560
for Christ today? I'm thankful I'll live with you forever. Will I live for you today? Work

692
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:56,280
as only you can. We'll give you the honor and glory for it's in Christ's name we pray.

693
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:03,520
Would you stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed. Who am I living for?
