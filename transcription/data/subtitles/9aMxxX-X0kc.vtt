00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.119
through 16 this morning, 2 Corinthians chapter 5, verses 14 through 16, and as you're turning

00:00:06.119 --> 00:00:10.920
there let me remind you that as we've studied in this fifth chapter of the book of 2 Corinthians

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.739
we've considered up to this point three very important truths.

00:00:15.739 --> 00:00:21.319
Number one, we dealt with the reality and the certainty of heaven, and what great truth

00:00:21.319 --> 00:00:26.920
that is as we look at the first eight verses of this chapter and we find that Paul uses

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:33.119
the phrase for we know, we are confident, we have this assurance to be absent from the

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:40.080
body is to be present with the Lord and what joy it brings to the heart of every true believer

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.439
that knows that they've been saved by the blood of Christ, that heaven is your home.

00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:48.639
And there are many people today that are going around life and they're wondering, they don't

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:53.360
know what's going to happen when they die, they're not sure, they know that death is

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:59.919
a certainty for all man will die, and we understand that, but the reality is that

00:00:59.919 --> 00:01:05.839
as believers, those that have been born again, that we have that reason to rejoice because

00:01:05.839 --> 00:01:08.839
we have the reality and certainty of heaven.

00:01:08.839 --> 00:01:12.760
We then dealt with verse number nine, and we dealt with the importance of living our

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.680
lives to please the Lord.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.800
After Paul is talking about having that eternal perspective at the end of chapter four and

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.120
after he's talking about heaven and the certainty of heaven, he then talks about the importance

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.760
of living that we might please the Lord, wherefore we labor that whether present or absent, we

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:36.839
may be accepted of him and how important it is that we live to please our Savior.

00:01:36.839 --> 00:01:40.800
And then two weeks ago, we had a missionary last week, but two weeks ago, we looked at

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.480
verses 10 down through verse number 13, and we spoke of the subject of the judgment seat

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.160
of Christ.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:53.000
And Paul understood that heaven was his home, and he had great confidence and certainty

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.599
of that truth, but we understand that he spoke about, to the church in Corinth, both in the

00:01:58.599 --> 00:02:03.040
book of 1 Corinthians and then also here in the book of 2 Corinthians, about that bema

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.279
seat, that coming day, the judgment seat of the Lord.

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:12.559
When we as believers were stand before him, we said, it's not a judgment, what is it not?

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:17.479
It's not for our sin, but we understand that our works will be tried of what sort they

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:19.880
are and he knows our motives.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.119
And we mentioned the importance of being able to receive crowns, not for any acknowledgement

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:30.119
or recognition for ourselves, but so that God would receive all glory for he is the

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:35.720
one that has saved us and he is the one who enables us and it will all be for his glory.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.479
We come to verse 14 this morning and we find that we, as we continue through the text,

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:44.960
we're confronted with a truth that begs a question.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.660
We're confronted with a truth that begs a question.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.279
Notice in verse 14, the Bible says, for the love of Christ constraineth us, because we

00:02:53.279 --> 00:02:57.639
thus judge that if one died for all, then we're all dead.

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:02.759
And that he died for all that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves,

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:06.639
but unto him which died for them and rose again.

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:12.000
Wherefore, henceforth, know we no man after the flesh, yea, though we have known Christ

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.800
after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.279
As we look at this passage of Scripture, these three verses, we find that it's a great truth

00:03:22.279 --> 00:03:26.520
that Jesus died for me and that he rose victoriously.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.919
He conquered sin, death, and the grave.

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:34.000
There's no doubt in my mind this morning that the truth that Paul mentions in these verses

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.720
of Scripture would cause him to rejoice greatly, to understand what Christ did on our behalf,

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:45.320
to understand that he paid the debt that we owed that we could never pay, how he would

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.800
rejoice greatly.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:52.080
But we find that as we look at the text, as Paul would reflect upon this wonderful truth,

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:58.919
he acknowledges the fact that we should therefore live for Jesus.

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:01.160
We should live for Jesus.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.320
The title for the message this morning is posed as a question.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:10.119
And I posed it the way that I did on purpose because I want every single one of us to ask

00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:15.199
ourselves the question, who am I living for?

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:17.200
Who am I living for?

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.920
Initially as I began to write out the title, I began to write it this way, who are you

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:21.920
living for?

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.880
But I thought, you know, I don't want to title it that way because I need to answer the question

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:33.000
myself personally, but I need each one of you to answer your question, who am I living

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000
for?

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.880
See, if we ask the question, who are you living for, you know what it does?

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.359
It gets the attention off of us and on someone else.

00:04:40.359 --> 00:04:44.440
And by the way, we like it that way.

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.600
Let a man examine himself, I'd rather examine you than myself, you'd rather examine me than

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.600
yourself.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.519
But we ask the question, who am I living for?

00:04:54.519 --> 00:04:55.519
Who am I living for?

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.160
As we look at the text of Scripture this morning, if you're taking notes, number one, there's

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.279
a conflict that we must acknowledge, a conflict that we must acknowledge.

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:08.640
We'll begin looking at verse 15, we'll come back to verse 14 in just a moment.

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:13.480
But look with me at verse number 15 as we consider this morning this conflict that each

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.480
of us will face.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.839
The Bible says in that he died for all, aren't you thankful for that?

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:22.679
He didn't die just for a certain group of people, he died for all and praise the Lord

00:05:22.679 --> 00:05:23.679
for that.

00:05:23.679 --> 00:05:30.959
And it says that they which live, notice this, should not henceforth live unto themselves,

00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:36.320
but unto him which died for them and rose again.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.320
So what is the conflict?

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:42.079
Well, the reality is that we can live unto ourselves.

00:05:42.079 --> 00:05:47.279
He uses the phrase here that they should, that they which live should not henceforth,

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:50.359
notice this, live unto themselves.

00:05:50.359 --> 00:05:54.239
You know, this morning as we think about the question, who am I living for?

00:05:54.239 --> 00:05:58.519
There are many people that if they were honest in answering the question this morning, who

00:05:58.519 --> 00:06:03.160
am I living for, that they would have to say, I'm living for myself.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:08.600
I am living for my own pleasures, I'm living for those things that I think are gonna bring

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.760
me the greatest level of enjoyment and of pleasure on this earth.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.420
They're living for themselves.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:22.179
And I tell you that they live for themselves, not only for pleasure, but they live for position.

00:06:22.179 --> 00:06:23.880
What position can I have?

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.739
What place can I rise to?

00:06:25.739 --> 00:06:31.380
What level of prominence may I be able to achieve, to accomplish, to climb a ladder,

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:32.380
so to speak?

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:38.059
And we find that there's this conflict because you have the old flesh, you trusted Christ

00:06:38.059 --> 00:06:40.980
as your Savior, but you still have the old man.

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:44.700
And I'll say to you this morning that the old man still has desires.

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:51.500
The old man still has those desires and those realities that we face as human beings being

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.579
saved by the grace of God.

00:06:53.579 --> 00:07:00.739
There are times in which you, self, wants to be the king of your life.

00:07:00.739 --> 00:07:04.980
Many a preacher have said over the years that the greatest enemy that we have is the one

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:07.940
that we look in the mirror at every morning.

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:12.140
So often we think about the external foes and the external enemies, but the reality

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:16.459
is that we oftentimes are our own worst enemy.

00:07:16.459 --> 00:07:17.459
Why?

00:07:17.459 --> 00:07:20.779
Because I want to live for myself.

00:07:20.779 --> 00:07:23.299
And in your flesh you want to live for yourself.

00:07:23.299 --> 00:07:25.459
You want to do the things that please you.

00:07:25.459 --> 00:07:27.140
You want to have that recognition.

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:31.059
Listen, why is pride spoken of so often in the Bible?

00:07:31.059 --> 00:07:32.820
Why is pride such an issue?

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:38.220
I believe it's a great sin that's prevalent in our communities, but even in our churches

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:40.420
pride is so prevalent.

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:41.420
Why?

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:44.220
Because it's a fleshly desire.

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:47.779
It feeds our flesh.

00:07:47.779 --> 00:07:51.899
We find that there are many that live for themselves and they're seeking to live for

00:07:51.899 --> 00:07:54.279
comfort.

00:07:54.279 --> 00:08:00.579
They think that they may be able to gain some level of comfort by living for themselves

00:08:00.579 --> 00:08:02.700
and they just want to do what they want to do.

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:09.500
Have you ever heard somebody say, no one can tell me what to do?

00:08:09.619 --> 00:08:15.859
Many people live with that mantra, with that idea, but we find that the conflict that we

00:08:15.859 --> 00:08:23.339
must acknowledge is that there is this temptation, this reality of living for ourselves.

00:08:23.339 --> 00:08:30.260
Even as saved people we can get into a rut, we can get into a process where we're living

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:37.299
for ourselves, but we find that in the text of Scripture it says that we should not henceforth

00:08:37.299 --> 00:08:40.940
live unto themselves, but notice, but unto Him.

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:47.979
So we live for Jesus, we live to please Him, to honor Him, not me, but Christ.

00:08:47.979 --> 00:08:52.059
Remember what John the Baptist said, He must increase and I must decrease.

00:08:52.059 --> 00:08:56.940
Truly, John the Baptist had a great following, John the Baptist had a great position, John

00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:01.500
the Baptist had a race to run and he's the forerunner of Christ and he's the one that

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:06.380
would say, behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world, and he had that

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:10.580
responsibility, there's a great number of people that followed him, he had many disciples,

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:15.340
but when Jesus came on the scene, when he pointed to Jesus, the one who would be the

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:19.419
Lamb that would take away the sin of the world, he said, I'm not even worthy to unloose this

00:09:19.419 --> 00:09:21.460
shoe latchet.

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:25.619
He says, as those religious leaders come to him and they begin to tell him about those

00:09:25.619 --> 00:09:33.619
that were following Jesus, that's the context in John chapter 3, he says, He must increase,

00:09:33.619 --> 00:09:34.619
but I must decrease.

00:09:34.859 --> 00:09:40.580
And see, we're living that life for Christ, we're, we're taking and following the pattern

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:45.500
that Jesus spoke of, turn over to Mark chapter number 8 if you will, and notice what Jesus

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:50.260
says in Mark chapter number 8.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:55.140
Even as I mentioned Mark 8, some of you already have an idea of the passage that we're looking

00:09:55.140 --> 00:10:02.299
to as Jesus would call the people unto Himself, and we find at the end of the chapter, Mark

00:10:02.299 --> 00:10:09.459
chapter in verse 34, this great truth is given to us with regard to the crucified life, living

00:10:09.459 --> 00:10:12.259
for Jesus.

00:10:12.259 --> 00:10:17.579
The Bible says in verse number 34, and when he, Jesus, had called the people unto him

00:10:17.579 --> 00:10:24.099
with his disciples also, he said unto them, notice this, whosoever will come after me,

00:10:24.099 --> 00:10:31.779
let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.

00:10:31.779 --> 00:10:37.299
For whosoever will save his life shall lose it, but whosoever shall lose his life for

00:10:37.299 --> 00:10:40.419
my sake and the gospels the same shall save it.

00:10:40.419 --> 00:10:44.899
For what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul?

00:10:44.899 --> 00:10:47.099
What shall a man give in exchange for his soul?

00:10:47.099 --> 00:10:51.179
Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful

00:10:51.179 --> 00:10:55.219
generation, of him also shall the Son of Man be ashamed when he cometh in the glory of

00:10:55.219 --> 00:10:58.619
his Father with the holy angels.

00:10:58.619 --> 00:11:01.739
We can look at this text of Scripture from really two applications.

00:11:01.739 --> 00:11:04.459
Number one, if we talk about a lost man, what shall it profit a man if he gain the whole

00:11:04.459 --> 00:11:06.419
world and lose his own soul?

00:11:06.419 --> 00:11:08.899
There are many people that have that perspective in life.

00:11:08.899 --> 00:11:09.899
They've never been redeemed.

00:11:09.899 --> 00:11:13.499
They're not saved people and they're living for all the pleasures that this world could

00:11:13.499 --> 00:11:14.499
afford.

00:11:14.499 --> 00:11:17.739
And by the way, Hebrews chapter number 11 does tell us that there's pleasure in sin

00:11:17.739 --> 00:11:19.999
for a season.

00:11:19.999 --> 00:11:20.999
Does it not?

00:11:20.999 --> 00:11:25.659
Moses had that experience and it speaks of it in Hebrews chapter number 11, and we find

00:11:25.659 --> 00:11:30.339
that he refused that and he was willing to suffer affliction with the people of God.

00:11:30.339 --> 00:11:31.339
Why?

00:11:31.339 --> 00:11:34.339
Because he was going to live not for the pleasures of the world, not for the pleasure of sin,

00:11:34.339 --> 00:11:37.119
but he's going to live for his God.

00:11:37.119 --> 00:11:41.059
We find here that as we look at this passage of Scripture and we could say of the lost

00:11:41.059 --> 00:11:45.339
person, listen, what does it matter if you gain all of these things?

00:11:45.339 --> 00:11:50.379
What does it matter if you're on the Forbes list of the most wealthy people in all of

00:11:50.379 --> 00:11:51.379
the world?

00:11:51.379 --> 00:11:58.019
What does it matter if you reach the number one position, but you're lost for all of eternity?

00:11:58.019 --> 00:12:01.299
You suffer in the lake of fire.

00:12:01.299 --> 00:12:07.059
Because I say to you as Christians, there are times in which we too struggle with living

00:12:07.059 --> 00:12:09.539
for ourselves instead of living for Him.

00:12:09.539 --> 00:12:13.619
And I make the application this morning, what does it matter if we, listen, if we've been

00:12:13.619 --> 00:12:18.419
saved by the grace of God, but yet we're living for those same types of things that the world's

00:12:18.419 --> 00:12:19.419
living for?

00:12:19.419 --> 00:12:24.299
And you say, but I'm going to heaven, yes, but you're going to go to heaven maybe empty-handed.

00:12:24.299 --> 00:12:27.979
You're going to go to heaven maybe accumulating a lot of things here on this earth and maybe

00:12:27.979 --> 00:12:32.059
having great position and title and so on and so forth, but you might stand at that

00:12:32.059 --> 00:12:36.599
judgment seat of Christ with nothing to offer your Savior.

00:12:36.599 --> 00:12:39.499
No crown to cast back at His feet.

00:12:39.499 --> 00:12:44.299
As we read, speaking of the judgment seat of Christ in our last message here in 2 Corinthians

00:12:44.299 --> 00:12:46.099
chapter number 5.

00:12:46.099 --> 00:12:50.479
So the Lord gives us this great pattern here in Mark chapter number 8 in verse 34, He gives

00:12:50.479 --> 00:12:52.899
us the, the progression, if you will.

00:12:52.899 --> 00:12:56.139
So often we talk about the importance of following Jesus.

00:12:56.139 --> 00:13:01.759
In fact, we sing songs about following Jesus, I will follow, follow on, all of these songs

00:13:01.759 --> 00:13:05.579
that we sing and we understand the importance of following Jesus.

00:13:05.579 --> 00:13:09.579
I have decided to follow Jesus.

00:13:09.579 --> 00:13:11.479
No turning back, no turning back.

00:13:11.479 --> 00:13:13.379
Is that not what the songwriter said?

00:13:13.379 --> 00:13:17.919
Is that not the song that we sing with children and VBS and so on and so forth?

00:13:17.919 --> 00:13:24.459
But listen, as adult people, as senior saints, we ought to still be singing, I have decided

00:13:24.459 --> 00:13:26.659
to follow Jesus.

00:13:26.659 --> 00:13:28.159
Amen?

00:13:28.159 --> 00:13:30.119
It's not just for the children's church.

00:13:30.119 --> 00:13:32.599
It's not just for the vacation Bible school kids.

00:13:32.599 --> 00:13:33.599
It's for us as well.

00:13:33.599 --> 00:13:36.319
I've decided to follow Jesus.

00:13:36.319 --> 00:13:40.719
After all that He's done for me, oh, that I would live for Him.

00:13:40.719 --> 00:13:44.459
And we find that there are oftentimes people talking about following Jesus.

00:13:44.459 --> 00:13:48.979
Listen, if you don't follow the prescribed pattern that's set forth in Mark 8 in verse

00:13:48.979 --> 00:13:54.259
34, you're going to struggle following Jesus because here's the reality is that you must

00:13:54.259 --> 00:13:57.839
first deny myself.

00:13:57.839 --> 00:14:03.859
If you try following Jesus but you've never died to self, you're divided and you're going

00:14:03.859 --> 00:14:05.499
to struggle.

00:14:05.499 --> 00:14:08.219
It's going to be a battle every single day.

00:14:08.219 --> 00:14:09.219
Why?

00:14:09.219 --> 00:14:10.439
Because you've not died to self.

00:14:10.439 --> 00:14:12.179
And so guess what self wants?

00:14:12.179 --> 00:14:14.979
Self wants what self wants.

00:14:14.979 --> 00:14:17.219
Amen?

00:14:17.219 --> 00:14:19.159
Self doesn't want to suffer.

00:14:19.159 --> 00:14:20.679
Self wants convenience.

00:14:20.679 --> 00:14:21.679
Self wants comfort.

00:14:21.679 --> 00:14:22.679
Am I right?

00:14:22.679 --> 00:14:27.679
And so we must deny ourselves.

00:14:27.679 --> 00:14:30.879
Paul said it this way, I am crucified with Christ.

00:14:30.879 --> 00:14:33.759
He said it this way, I die daily.

00:14:33.759 --> 00:14:35.679
I've denied myself.

00:14:35.679 --> 00:14:37.919
Not I, but Christ.

00:14:37.919 --> 00:14:40.239
Not I, but Christ.

00:14:40.239 --> 00:14:43.479
We find that he says not only that we're to deny ourselves, but number two, he says

00:14:43.479 --> 00:14:47.239
that we're to take up his cross.

00:14:47.239 --> 00:14:49.479
Wow.

00:14:49.479 --> 00:14:57.699
The cross represents for us many things, but we find that the cross represents first death.

00:14:57.699 --> 00:15:01.239
I'm thankful that my Lord and Savior died upon that cross.

00:15:01.239 --> 00:15:04.000
This morning we have a cross in our baptistry.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.039
Every time you come in here, you see that cross, but you'll notice that Jesus isn't

00:15:07.039 --> 00:15:08.039
on that cross.

00:15:08.039 --> 00:15:09.039
Why?

00:15:09.039 --> 00:15:10.599
Because he's suffering sin, death, and the grave.

00:15:10.599 --> 00:15:11.599
Hallelujah.

00:15:11.599 --> 00:15:12.599
I serve a risen Savior.

00:15:12.599 --> 00:15:14.479
He's not on the cross anymore.

00:15:14.479 --> 00:15:19.440
At Christmas time, you'll see these little portrayals of Jesus in a manger at Bethlehem.

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:21.879
Listen, he's not there anymore either.

00:15:21.879 --> 00:15:23.039
Hallelujah.

00:15:23.039 --> 00:15:25.199
I'm thankful for the truth of the incarnation.

00:15:25.199 --> 00:15:31.199
I'm thankful that Jesus became flesh, that he came to this world and he became flesh,

00:15:31.199 --> 00:15:32.199
God in flesh.

00:15:32.199 --> 00:15:33.559
I'm thankful for that.

00:15:33.559 --> 00:15:38.279
I'm thankful that he went to the cross because it was necessary for my salvation, for your

00:15:38.519 --> 00:15:40.000
salvation.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.959
The incarnation and the crucifixion, they're great truths and realities.

00:15:45.959 --> 00:15:51.679
They're absolutely essential to Christian faith and doctrine.

00:15:51.679 --> 00:15:54.879
He's not in the manger and he's not on the cross.

00:15:54.879 --> 00:15:58.679
He is seated at the right hand of the Father.

00:15:58.679 --> 00:16:00.279
He's ascended.

00:16:00.279 --> 00:16:04.559
He is waiting to come back for us, amen?

00:16:04.559 --> 00:16:06.359
He is in his exalted position.

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:11.119
Listen, when he comes the second time, he's not coming as a babe in the manger.

00:16:11.119 --> 00:16:15.440
When he comes the second time, he's coming as the conquering king of Judah.

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:18.319
And hallelujah, that's my God.

00:16:18.319 --> 00:16:23.359
But I think about this thing of taking up our cross, it's dying to self.

00:16:23.359 --> 00:16:27.839
Many years ago, I think Holly and I, we've been married for 24 years, so it was somewhere

00:16:27.839 --> 00:16:32.479
right after we got married, my mother-in-law had this idea that at Christmas time, that

00:16:32.479 --> 00:16:36.199
everyone would give a gift that was something that they made.

00:16:36.199 --> 00:16:40.000
Now, if any of you know me real well, I'm not real crafty.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.639
And so all of a sudden, I'm sitting around and I'm thinking, so I'm supposed to make

00:16:42.639 --> 00:16:46.359
something that I'm going to give to all of these people.

00:16:46.359 --> 00:16:50.359
What in the world am I going to do?

00:16:50.359 --> 00:16:55.099
And I began to think about it, I began to kind of pray about it, and what could I do?

00:16:55.099 --> 00:16:58.959
And I made a bookmark, I have a, it's not this bookmark, but it was a little bit bigger

00:16:58.959 --> 00:16:59.959
than this.

00:16:59.959 --> 00:17:02.559
I just had this in my coat pocket this morning.

00:17:02.559 --> 00:17:07.759
But I made this bookmark, and I had Galatians 2.20 written out, typed out on one side,

00:17:07.759 --> 00:17:14.119
and on the other side I had this phrase, dying to self is the prerequisite for the victorious

00:17:14.119 --> 00:17:16.220
Christian life.

00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:20.599
If you want victory in your life, you better die to self.

00:17:20.599 --> 00:17:24.599
You've got to die to self.

00:17:24.599 --> 00:17:32.539
Denying myself, taking up my cross, and then the Bible says, follow me, follow me.

00:17:32.539 --> 00:17:38.179
You know, when I've denied myself, when I've taken up my cross, I can follow Jesus, singular

00:17:38.179 --> 00:17:40.579
focus.

00:17:40.579 --> 00:17:41.940
God doesn't want a divided heart.

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:45.819
How many times we read about the kings that they, that they did this, but not with their

00:17:45.819 --> 00:17:49.559
whole heart, right?

00:17:49.559 --> 00:17:53.699
You see this phraseology in the Bible, listen, God wants all of your heart.

00:17:53.699 --> 00:17:54.699
He wants all of you.

00:17:54.699 --> 00:17:55.699
He wants all of me.

00:17:55.699 --> 00:18:00.659
But when we look at this passage in 2 Corinthians chapter 5 and we seek to answer the question,

00:18:00.659 --> 00:18:02.259
who am I living for?

00:18:02.259 --> 00:18:05.059
We must acknowledge this morning that there's a conflict.

00:18:05.059 --> 00:18:08.779
We must acknowledge this morning that you struggle, that I struggle every day of our

00:18:08.779 --> 00:18:09.779
lives.

00:18:09.779 --> 00:18:13.859
Am I going to live for myself or am I going to live for Jesus?

00:18:13.859 --> 00:18:18.419
And it's not something that you made a decision on some day in the past and said, I'm going

00:18:18.419 --> 00:18:22.779
to live for Jesus, and then you never have to revisit that choice.

00:18:22.779 --> 00:18:26.739
Because the reality is that every day of your life, and in fact, many moments during the

00:18:26.739 --> 00:18:30.619
days of your life, there's going to be something that comes up that you could make that decision,

00:18:30.619 --> 00:18:34.220
okay, I'm living for Jesus, but now I'm living for self.

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:36.659
I'm living for Jesus, and now I'm living for self.

00:18:36.659 --> 00:18:39.380
It can go back and forth.

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:45.820
The reality this morning is that we must see that there is this conflict, and even as saved

00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:49.339
people, that we ought to know better.

00:18:49.339 --> 00:18:53.899
I think this morning, if we would be honest and if we would be willing to come and stand

00:18:53.899 --> 00:19:00.299
and give testimony, that each of us could say that at some time in my Christian life,

00:19:00.299 --> 00:19:07.979
however long I've been saved, there has been at least one day that I didn't live for Jesus,

00:19:07.979 --> 00:19:14.659
that I was living for myself, that I was living for myself.

00:19:14.659 --> 00:19:15.940
We note the conflict.

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:18.659
Number two, I want you to consider some things.

00:19:18.659 --> 00:19:22.219
There's a conflict, but then there's some consideration.

00:19:22.219 --> 00:19:26.919
Notice with me, really, three thoughts from these three verses of Scripture on what it

00:19:26.919 --> 00:19:28.380
is that we should consider.

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:32.539
Number one, we should consider Christ's love.

00:19:32.539 --> 00:19:39.179
In verse number 14, the Bible says, for the love of Christ constraineth us.

00:19:39.179 --> 00:19:41.859
That word literally means to hold together.

00:19:41.859 --> 00:19:45.940
It means to hold together lest it fall to pieces.

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:48.659
Now, think about that just for a moment.

00:19:48.659 --> 00:19:50.779
They would use it in binding of sheaf.

00:19:50.779 --> 00:19:55.700
They would use that phraseology, the same word and that same idea where they would bind

00:19:55.700 --> 00:20:00.299
them together and they would keep them together so that they would be held and pressed together

00:20:00.299 --> 00:20:02.299
so that they wouldn't fall apart so they could be...

00:20:02.299 --> 00:20:05.039
easily transportable, and we find here that he says,

00:20:05.039 --> 00:20:07.619
the love of Christ constraineth us.

00:20:07.619 --> 00:20:10.499
Yes, I believe that there's some aspect to this word

00:20:10.499 --> 00:20:13.099
also having that compelling feature

00:20:13.099 --> 00:20:15.899
and that motivation idea, and it's there

00:20:15.899 --> 00:20:18.699
and we understand that, but we see that here

00:20:18.699 --> 00:20:21.579
we must remember the love of Christ.

00:20:21.579 --> 00:20:23.919
Listen, it's his love that sent him to the cross.

00:20:23.919 --> 00:20:26.499
It's the love that kept him on the cross.

00:20:26.499 --> 00:20:29.499
We find that for God so loved the world,

00:20:29.499 --> 00:20:32.019
but God commendeth his love toward us,

00:20:32.019 --> 00:20:34.579
and that while we're yet sinners, Christ died for us.

00:20:34.579 --> 00:20:36.779
The reality that Paul says to the church,

00:20:36.779 --> 00:20:39.419
to the folks in Rome, what can separate us

00:20:39.419 --> 00:20:41.939
from the love of God?

00:20:41.939 --> 00:20:46.579
Keep yourselves, Jude is telling us, in the love of God.

00:20:48.099 --> 00:20:49.779
What happened to the church at Ephesus?

00:20:49.779 --> 00:20:53.259
Well, they left their first love.

00:20:53.259 --> 00:20:56.899
This morning, are you reminded every day of your life

00:20:56.899 --> 00:21:00.419
that God loves you, and that it's the love of Christ

00:21:00.459 --> 00:21:02.059
that constrains you?

00:21:03.939 --> 00:21:07.419
Listen, when we consider this truth, when we understand,

00:21:07.419 --> 00:21:09.899
listen, you ever hear somebody say,

00:21:09.899 --> 00:21:11.659
things are falling apart in my life?

00:21:11.659 --> 00:21:13.899
Somebody might say, my life is falling apart.

00:21:13.899 --> 00:21:17.019
Listen, it's God that keeps us together.

00:21:18.859 --> 00:21:22.739
It's the truth of God's word that we regularly go back to

00:21:22.739 --> 00:21:26.219
that gives us the joy and the peace.

00:21:26.219 --> 00:21:27.299
It's his love.

00:21:28.219 --> 00:21:31.659
I'm thankful that he actively loves us.

00:21:32.819 --> 00:21:35.939
We sing the songs, we understand the importance

00:21:35.939 --> 00:21:37.699
of being reminded of God's love,

00:21:37.699 --> 00:21:42.699
and there's many songs that speak about God's love.

00:21:42.779 --> 00:21:46.259
And can it be, what a great song,

00:21:47.819 --> 00:21:52.819
that thou, my God, didst die for me.

00:21:52.939 --> 00:21:53.779
For me.

00:21:54.659 --> 00:21:55.739
How can it be?

00:21:56.859 --> 00:21:59.099
Amazing love, for sure.

00:22:00.619 --> 00:22:02.179
Jesus loves even me.

00:22:03.259 --> 00:22:05.259
Wonderful things in the Bible, I see.

00:22:06.259 --> 00:22:10.139
But this is the dearest, that Jesus loves me.

00:22:11.019 --> 00:22:13.139
I hope this morning you never get over the fact

00:22:13.139 --> 00:22:16.219
that God loves you, and that he loves you

00:22:16.219 --> 00:22:17.539
with an unconditional love.

00:22:17.539 --> 00:22:19.979
He loves you with an everlasting love.

00:22:19.979 --> 00:22:22.739
There's nothing that can separate you from God's love.

00:22:23.779 --> 00:22:26.899
And when you're reminded of God's love for you,

00:22:26.899 --> 00:22:30.939
it ought to compel you and motivate you to live for Jesus.

00:22:30.939 --> 00:22:33.499
We consider his love, we consider the fact

00:22:33.499 --> 00:22:34.659
that he died for us.

00:22:34.659 --> 00:22:37.579
We see it, it's the second truth that we see here

00:22:37.579 --> 00:22:41.459
in verse number 14 and 15, because we thus judge

00:22:41.459 --> 00:22:43.819
that if one, speaking of the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:22:43.819 --> 00:22:46.619
died for all, then we're all dead.

00:22:46.619 --> 00:22:48.379
We were all dead.

00:22:48.379 --> 00:22:49.379
You say, no, I was alive.

00:22:49.379 --> 00:22:51.139
No, you were dead spiritually.

00:22:51.139 --> 00:22:53.299
You were alive physically, but you were dead spiritually.

00:22:53.299 --> 00:22:55.979
And we understand that Paul mentions that in Ephesians 2.

00:22:55.979 --> 00:22:57.219
You don't need to turn there, but it says,

00:22:57.219 --> 00:22:59.219
and you hath he quickened to make alive

00:22:59.219 --> 00:23:01.699
who were dead in trespasses and sins.

00:23:01.699 --> 00:23:03.619
Ephesians 2 and verse number 1.

00:23:03.619 --> 00:23:04.459
I was dead.

00:23:06.579 --> 00:23:07.419
We were dead.

00:23:08.739 --> 00:23:11.659
In fact, Ephesians 2 goes on to continue mentioning

00:23:11.659 --> 00:23:14.899
we all had the same position.

00:23:14.899 --> 00:23:16.339
This was our conversation.

00:23:16.339 --> 00:23:17.739
There's nothing different about any of us.

00:23:18.099 --> 00:23:20.859
We were all dead in our trespasses and sins.

00:23:20.859 --> 00:23:23.019
And so it says that he died for all.

00:23:23.019 --> 00:23:25.099
I'm so thankful for the Bible truth

00:23:25.099 --> 00:23:27.859
that God died for all the world.

00:23:27.859 --> 00:23:30.659
There are some that would teach that he only died

00:23:30.659 --> 00:23:32.179
for a certain group of people.

00:23:32.179 --> 00:23:34.059
I do not find that biblically.

00:23:34.059 --> 00:23:37.739
You find that throughout the Bible that his death

00:23:37.739 --> 00:23:41.079
was substitutionary and is sufficient for all mankind.

00:23:41.079 --> 00:23:43.939
We find that the Bible says in 1 John 2,

00:23:43.939 --> 00:23:47.179
what a great verse of scripture that many people will take

00:23:47.179 --> 00:23:49.899
and they'll try to explain away other verses.

00:23:49.899 --> 00:23:52.779
But I come to 1 John 2 and I've had this conversation

00:23:52.779 --> 00:23:55.979
repeatedly with people where the Bible says this,

00:23:55.979 --> 00:23:58.419
that in verse number 2, and he, speaking of Christ,

00:23:58.419 --> 00:24:02.859
is the propitiation for our sins and not for ours only,

00:24:02.859 --> 00:24:06.259
but also for the sins of the whole world.

00:24:08.819 --> 00:24:11.339
He's our mercy seat, our covering.

00:24:11.339 --> 00:24:12.259
He took my place.

00:24:12.259 --> 00:24:15.839
He died for me and he died for you.

00:24:15.839 --> 00:24:18.319
Listen this morning, when we consider the fact

00:24:18.319 --> 00:24:22.679
that he died for me, shouldn't I at least live for him?

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.440
If he was willing to die for me,

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.239
if he was willing to die for you,

00:24:27.239 --> 00:24:29.759
shouldn't we at least live for him?

00:24:29.759 --> 00:24:32.919
The third truth that we see is what is our view of Christ?

00:24:32.919 --> 00:24:34.839
In verse 16, it's a verse of scripture

00:24:34.839 --> 00:24:37.720
that Paul is sharing with us here.

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:39.079
And he says, wherefore, henceforth,

00:24:39.079 --> 00:24:41.359
know we no man after the flesh.

00:24:41.359 --> 00:24:43.959
Yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh,

00:24:44.079 --> 00:24:46.479
yet now henceforth, know we him no more.

00:24:46.479 --> 00:24:48.399
It can be a little confusing, this verse of scripture,

00:24:48.399 --> 00:24:50.199
but let me help you understand,

00:24:50.199 --> 00:24:52.759
as I've meditated upon this and thought through this

00:24:52.759 --> 00:24:55.720
this week and previously, and just really looking

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:57.679
at what's taking place here, Paul is saying,

00:24:57.679 --> 00:25:01.359
listen, my view of Christ has drastically changed

00:25:02.239 --> 00:25:06.639
from before I got saved to now that I am saved.

00:25:06.639 --> 00:25:09.919
See, Paul, there's little doubt in my mind

00:25:09.919 --> 00:25:13.659
that Paul would have known who Jesus was.

00:25:14.399 --> 00:25:16.759
He would have known who Jesus was.

00:25:16.759 --> 00:25:21.119
He would have known Christ the man, Jesus Christ the man.

00:25:21.119 --> 00:25:22.319
He would have known him.

00:25:24.399 --> 00:25:27.479
Maybe he met him, maybe he heard of some miracles.

00:25:27.479 --> 00:25:29.679
We don't know, the Bible doesn't go into all the details,

00:25:29.679 --> 00:25:31.879
but we do know that all the Jewish men

00:25:31.879 --> 00:25:34.359
would come to Jerusalem three times a year.

00:25:35.199 --> 00:25:36.879
Jesus was there regularly.

00:25:36.879 --> 00:25:38.799
And by the way, he performed miracles,

00:25:38.799 --> 00:25:42.519
and Paul had trained at the feet of Gamaliel.

00:25:42.519 --> 00:25:45.039
Paul was a religious leader.

00:25:45.039 --> 00:25:47.339
I don't know what interactions they had,

00:25:47.339 --> 00:25:50.199
but what I want you to understand that Paul,

00:25:50.199 --> 00:25:54.239
now that he's converted, he has a completely different view

00:25:54.239 --> 00:25:56.319
of who Jesus Christ is.

00:25:56.319 --> 00:25:59.599
Prior to his salvation, prior to his conversion

00:25:59.599 --> 00:26:02.279
in Acts chapter nine, he just thought of Christ

00:26:02.279 --> 00:26:03.159
as a mere man.

00:26:03.159 --> 00:26:06.519
He thought of Christ maybe as a phony, as a fake,

00:26:06.519 --> 00:26:08.839
as an imposter, whatever he would have thought of.

00:26:08.839 --> 00:26:11.720
Why, because he's going out to kill any of those

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:14.199
to imprison and to commit to death

00:26:14.199 --> 00:26:17.299
those that were of that way, Acts chapter nine.

00:26:18.479 --> 00:26:23.479
But now, but now he sees Christ in a whole different way.

00:26:24.519 --> 00:26:27.239
He understands that what happened there

00:26:27.239 --> 00:26:31.000
at the cross of Calvary, he understands that at that cross

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.599
that Jesus was dying for him.

00:26:35.119 --> 00:26:36.919
He would have been familiar with the fact

00:26:36.919 --> 00:26:39.720
that it was Barabbas that was supposed to die on that cross,

00:26:40.119 --> 00:26:43.039
that the other two that were dying alongside Jesus,

00:26:43.039 --> 00:26:44.879
that the third was for Barabbas,

00:26:44.879 --> 00:26:48.039
but no, the people said, release him and crucify Christ.

00:26:48.039 --> 00:26:51.039
And I don't know what place Paul would have had

00:26:51.039 --> 00:26:53.839
in all of that, but Paul now understands

00:26:53.839 --> 00:26:58.079
that he died for me and he loves me.

00:26:58.079 --> 00:27:00.599
And Paul's perspective, his view of Christ

00:27:00.599 --> 00:27:03.799
is completely transformed.

00:27:03.799 --> 00:27:07.559
I wonder this morning, can you recall what you thought

00:27:07.559 --> 00:27:10.679
about Jesus before you got saved?

00:27:10.679 --> 00:27:14.399
Can you recall this morning your view of Christ

00:27:14.399 --> 00:27:17.679
before you trusted him as your personal Lord and savior?

00:27:17.679 --> 00:27:19.119
Depending on your background,

00:27:19.119 --> 00:27:21.000
depending on how you had been taught,

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:26.000
you have varied ideas about who Jesus was or who he is.

00:27:26.239 --> 00:27:31.239
But now as a believer, man, I have a different view

00:27:32.239 --> 00:27:34.039
of who Christ is.

00:27:34.039 --> 00:27:38.919
He's not just mere man, he's God in flesh.

00:27:38.919 --> 00:27:41.440
He loves me and he died for me.

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:44.839
And so Paul is saying, listen, there's a conflict

00:27:44.839 --> 00:27:46.919
and we must acknowledge that this morning,

00:27:46.919 --> 00:27:48.759
but there's some things to consider.

00:27:48.759 --> 00:27:51.919
I'm reminded of a song, you don't need to turn there,

00:27:51.919 --> 00:27:54.639
but I just wanna read a couple of verses of this song.

00:27:54.639 --> 00:27:56.959
It's number 694 in our song book.

00:27:56.959 --> 00:27:59.119
You can turn there if you'd like.

00:27:59.119 --> 00:28:03.759
And in this song, it is said that the one

00:28:04.479 --> 00:28:08.599
who wrote this song, that she went into a place

00:28:08.599 --> 00:28:11.359
and had been struggling with really some of the things

00:28:11.359 --> 00:28:14.479
she had been taught about salvation and Christianity.

00:28:14.479 --> 00:28:17.639
And she was struggling and having some doubts in her life

00:28:17.639 --> 00:28:19.159
is what the story says.

00:28:19.159 --> 00:28:24.159
And she went in and she saw a picture on the wall

00:28:24.239 --> 00:28:28.879
that was a depiction of the cross of Calvary.

00:28:29.839 --> 00:28:34.000
And when she saw that, it had such a deep impact upon her

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.919
that she sat down and wrote this song.

00:28:37.279 --> 00:28:39.760
I gave my life for thee.

00:28:41.959 --> 00:28:46.559
I gave my life for thee, my precious blood I shed,

00:28:46.559 --> 00:28:51.559
that thou might ransom be and quickened from the dead.

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:55.880
I gave, I gave my life for thee.

00:28:56.719 --> 00:29:01.719
And she asked this question, what has thou given for me?

00:29:03.479 --> 00:29:06.279
Jesus, as she's writing this, it's Jesus that's saying,

00:29:06.279 --> 00:29:08.080
I gave my life for thee.

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:11.320
And then Jesus saying, what have you given for me?

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:13.440
The second verse, my father's house of light,

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:15.519
my glory circled throne.

00:29:15.519 --> 00:29:19.959
I left for earthly night, for wandering sad and alone.

00:29:19.959 --> 00:29:21.359
He left the glory of heaven.

00:29:22.799 --> 00:29:23.799
He's God.

00:29:23.799 --> 00:29:24.640
He's God.

00:29:25.599 --> 00:29:28.959
You read John 17, our memory verse for the month of March,

00:29:28.959 --> 00:29:30.880
2 Corinthians 8, 9.

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:33.239
He became poor for us.

00:29:33.239 --> 00:29:37.640
He left the throne of heaven, the glory that he had.

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:40.599
He said, I left, I left it all for thee.

00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:45.239
Hast thou left aught for me?

00:29:45.239 --> 00:29:46.640
I know it's a song.

00:29:47.559 --> 00:29:49.719
It's not Bible, it's a song.

00:29:49.719 --> 00:29:53.080
But oh my, what a song it is.

00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:56.320
The third verse, I suffered much for thee, did he not?

00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:59.279
Peter speaks of in 1 Peter 5,

00:29:59.279 --> 00:30:02.200
about being an eyewitness of the sufferings of Christ.

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:08.400
I suffered much for thee, more than thy tongue can tell."

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:12.080
Isn't that an interesting statement that the songwriter writes?

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:15.680
We can't fully understand all that Christ suffered for us.

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:22.200
The end verse of this 2 Corinthians 5 that we'll look at in a few weeks, He hath made

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:26.720
Him to be sin for us.

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:32.240
I can't fully comprehend that level of suffering.

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:41.040
Of bitterest agony, to rescue thee from hell, I've borne, I've borne it all for thee.

00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:44.480
What hast thou borne for me?

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:52.280
Verse 4, and I have brought to thee, down from my home above, salvation full and free,

00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:55.000
my pardon and my love.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:00.800
I bring, I bring rich gifts to thee.

00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:05.320
What hast thou brought to me?

00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:11.400
What a song, what a song.

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:17.920
The songwriter understood something that we're preaching about here this morning.

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:23.200
In 2 Corinthians 5, 14-16, I don't know the exact verses of Scripture that God was using

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:28.240
in and through her life at the time of writing that song, but oh, when we look at this passage

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:32.920
as Paul is writing to this church in Corinth, we know some things about the church in Corinth.

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:41.120
Man, they're a church that needed to understand that they need to live for Christ.

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:47.720
The conflict, the consideration, I finish up this morning with a choice.

00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:53.720
You know, the facts have been presented as Paul lays it out here.

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:57.240
We're all dead, but Christ died for us.

00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:01.920
We should not live for ourselves, we should live for Him.

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:06.280
He loves us, He died for us, He offers this to us.

00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:12.800
The facts are presented, but Paul now is going to kind of lay it out as we look at this passage.

00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:17.160
He doesn't ask him the question, but I said that by way of introduction this morning,

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:21.760
I said that the truth that is given begs a question.

00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:23.800
Who am I living for?

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:26.120
There's a choice to be made.

00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:28.800
A choice that every child of God has to make.

00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:32.400
Listen, there's a choice for salvation.

00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:35.160
Amen?

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:40.880
He came to His own, His own received Him not, but as many as received Him, to them gave He power

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:42.880
to become the sons of God, John 1.

00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:48.440
Listen, there's a choice on whether you're going to trust Christ as your Savior or not.

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:58.560
Many a time I've presented the gospel to individuals that said their choice was one of rejection.

00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:02.320
How glorious it is when someone receives that gift.

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:08.040
But can I tell you this morning that that's a one-time decision that you make,

00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:10.560
to trust Christ as your Savior.

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:13.520
He tells us that He gives us eternal life.

00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:15.400
He tells us that we'll never perish.

00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:19.360
He tells us that we're secure in the hand of God, that we have an inheritance that is

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:20.880
reserved in heaven for us.

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:27.680
I mean, the truth of eternal security is such a precious reality.

00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:32.360
The choice that you now have as a believer, listen, if you've never been saved this morning,

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:36.280
your choice is to get saved, to trust Christ as your Savior.

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:40.560
But for every child of God this morning, you know what our choice is, our decision, is

00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:43.520
our, who are we going to live for?

00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:46.400
Am I living for myself?

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:48.640
Am I living for Jesus?

00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:52.560
You know, there's some people that say, well, I want to offer another idea.

00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:54.080
I'm living for my spouse.

00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:55.680
I'm living for my children.

00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:59.600
I'm living for my, no, no, you're to live for Jesus.

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:00.600
Amen?

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:04.160
Live for Jesus.

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:08.040
Paul had already made his choice.

00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:09.920
Paul had already made his choice.

00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:14.040
We sang the song this morning, who is on the Lord's side?

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:19.600
By the way, I love it when songs just mesh so well with the message.

00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:20.920
Who is on the Lord's side?

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:25.760
You know who's speaking and that's Moses, all right?

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:29.680
Exodus chapter 32 takes place and all the sin, remember Aaron, they got that golden

00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:34.160
calf and here be thy gods and so on and so forth and Joshua and Moses come down and

00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:37.640
Joshua stands there and says, who is on the, or Moses said, who's on the Lord's side?

00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:38.640
Let them come after me.

00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:39.640
It was a choice.

00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:43.920
It was a choice that they had to make.

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:45.320
This morning we have a choice.

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:46.400
Paul made his choice.

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:48.160
Paul had drawn the line in the sand.

00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:51.040
Paul had boldly proclaimed and declared his choice.

00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:52.040
How do we know that?

00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:55.040
Galatians 2.20, I am crucified with Christ.

00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:58.559
Nevertheless I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live

00:34:58.559 --> 00:34:59.559
in the flesh.

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:04.360
I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me.

00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:05.920
Paul had made it known.

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:11.400
Paul says to the church in Philippi in Philippians 1.21, for to me to live is Christ and to die

00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:13.720
is gain.

00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:17.880
Paul as he writes here in 2 Corinthians chapter 5, he'd already spoken about heaven.

00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:20.779
He'd already dealt with the reality and the certainty of heaven.

00:35:20.779 --> 00:35:25.080
He knew that he was going to go and be and live with the Lord for all of eternity.

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:29.920
But the question this morning is not, who are you going to live with for all of eternity?

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:33.120
For we know if we're saved that we will live with Christ.

00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:40.800
The question this morning is this, will I live for Christ today?

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:45.080
I will live with him for eternity.

00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:49.160
But will I live for him today?

00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:51.960
What a question.

00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:57.680
What a question.

00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:59.320
Paul says for me to live is Christ.

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:01.680
Man, what is he saying?

00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:03.680
It's not about me.

00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:05.680
It's not about Paul.

00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:08.680
It's not about what I want.

00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:11.040
It's about what Christ wants.

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:13.480
It's about what pleases him.

00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:15.680
Paul, you're going on another journey.

00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:16.680
Paul, you're going over there.

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:17.880
Don't you know those people hate you?

00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:18.880
They don't want to hear the gospel.

00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:24.800
They're going to…Paul said, not me, but Christ.

00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:29.000
Not me, but Christ.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:35.400
And I want you to consider this morning the wonderful reality from this portion of Scripture

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:40.360
as we couple it all together, these first really sixteen verses.

00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:44.440
We'll deal with verse seventeen next week, and it's a familiar verse of Scripture,

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:47.279
but we look at these first sixteen verses.

00:36:47.279 --> 00:36:50.320
And I've said it already, but I want it to just sink in this morning before we have

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:52.520
our time of invitation.

00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:58.800
If you're saved this morning, you will live with Christ forever.

00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:01.720
Do you believe that this morning?

00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:04.360
I'm saying do you really believe that this morning?

00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:05.360
There's like four amens.

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:07.559
I hope there's more that believe that this morning.

00:37:07.559 --> 00:37:11.480
You're going to live with him forever.

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:12.480
How do we know that?

00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:14.760
Well, John 14.

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:15.760
Let not your heart be troubled.

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:16.760
You believe in God.

00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:17.760
Believe also in me.

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:18.760
In my Father's house are many mansions.

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:20.720
If it were not so, I would have told you.

00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:25.800
I go to prepare a place for you that, and if I go, I'll come again and receive you.

00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:26.800
What does it say?

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:30.640
And to myself, that where I am, there ye may be also.

00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:32.559
Is that not what it says?

00:37:32.559 --> 00:37:38.440
First Thessalonians chapter four, we're going to, then they which are alive and remain shall

00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:41.440
be caught up to meet the Lord in the clouds, right?

00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:45.240
So forever we will be with the Lord.

00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:46.320
Is that not what the Bible teaches?

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:47.880
Do you believe that this morning?

00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:52.840
If you're saved this morning, you're going to live with him forever.

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:56.680
Can't wait.

00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:59.480
Hallelujah.

00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:06.720
If you're not saved this morning, listen, if you're not saved this morning, you will

00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:14.600
live separated from him forever in a place called the lake of fire.

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:19.880
It's often referred to as hell, but the Bible tells us that death and hell are cast in the

00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:21.680
lake of fire.

00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:25.440
That's the eternal place of judgment.

00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:30.000
The Bible tells us of hell that it's a place where the worm dieth not.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.000
It's not annihilation.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.840
It's separation from God for all of eternity.

00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:37.200
So if you're not saved this morning, today is the day of salvation.

00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:44.280
In fact, Paul says that in second Corinthians chapter six, behold, today is the day of salvation.

00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:48.919
If you're not saved today, the choice for you is to get saved.

00:38:48.919 --> 00:38:53.640
But if we believe this morning, and I shared the verses with you, that we will live with

00:38:53.640 --> 00:39:07.080
Christ forever, the question, the question is will you live for Christ today?

00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:11.480
Will you live for Christ today?

00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:20.880
You're going to live with Him forever, but will you live for Him today?

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:24.919
We got to ask ourselves the question, who am I living for?

00:39:24.919 --> 00:39:26.919
Who am I living for?

00:39:26.919 --> 00:39:28.440
I know where we stand today.

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:34.160
I know where we're located, and I understand the area that we're in in Northern Virginia

00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:40.859
and the pressures of life and so many people living for so many different things and how

00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:46.540
that can influence, the culture can influence a church.

00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:51.540
And all of a sudden, we can get a little distracted on what I'm living for.

00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:57.780
Oh, God wants to get our attention today.

00:39:57.780 --> 00:39:59.700
Who am I living for?

00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:00.700
I got to ask that.

00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:02.220
Listen, I got to deal with this all week.

00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:10.260
as God dealt with me. You get it just for 50 minutes. I had to deal with it all week.

00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:15.940
And I hope you deal with it all next week. And the week after that, that we remember

00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:25.820
who am I living for? Who am I living for? Because He saved me and I had to live for

00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:32.060
Him. I shouldn't live for myself. I don't live for my wife. I don't live for my kids.

00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:38.660
I love my wife. I love my kids. I love my, I got grandkids now. Love them. But I don't

00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:44.980
live for them. I live for Jesus. And if I live for Jesus, I can be the husband and the

00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:51.220
father and the grandfather that I'm supposed to be. But if I start living for them, everything

00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:59.820
gets out of kilter. It gets all whacked out. I got to live for Jesus. Who am I living for?

00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:06.120
Father we love you. Thank you for loving us. Thank you for the text of scripture. Thank

00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:12.740
you for the reality that we'll live with you forever. If there's one that's not saved,

00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:17.780
I pray that today they'd get saved. They'd recognize that you loved them and you died

00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:25.180
for them. You took their place so that they could be saved. God, I ask that you would

00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:33.860
help me and every other believer in this room, tuned in via live stream, that we would

00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:41.380
search our hearts and honestly answer the question, who am I living for? Will I live

00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:50.560
for Christ today? I'm thankful I'll live with you forever. Will I live for you today? Work

00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:56.280
as only you can. We'll give you the honor and glory for it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:41:56.280 --> 00:42:03.520
Would you stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed. Who am I living for?
