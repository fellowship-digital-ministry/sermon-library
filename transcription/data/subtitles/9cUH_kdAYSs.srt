1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
is chapter 11, and I know that the bulletin says Revelation chapter 2, and that was my

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,840
plan at the beginning of last week, and as we went through the week, God kept pushing

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:17,120
me, pushing me towards 1 Corinthians 11. We're observing the Lord's Supper this evening,

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:23,159
and I want to take some time to study through this passage as we prepare this evening to

5
00:00:23,159 --> 00:00:28,120
observe the Lord's Supper. I believe that it's important to be reminded of some things

6
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:33,360
that God shows us here in this passage. Typically, we deal with verses 23 down through verse

7
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,639
number 31. I want to back it up and begin in verse 17 this evening, in 1 Corinthians

8
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:43,599
chapter number 11, beginning in verse number 17. Notice the Bible says now in this that

9
00:00:43,599 --> 00:00:48,599
I declare unto you, I praise you not, that you come together not for the better, but

10
00:00:48,599 --> 00:00:53,479
for the worse. For first of all, when you come together in the church, I hear that there

11
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:58,240
be divisions among you, and I partly believe it. For there must be also heresies among

12
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:03,599
you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you. When you come together,

13
00:01:03,599 --> 00:01:09,680
therefore, into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's Supper. For in eating, everyone

14
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,879
taketh before other his own supper, and one is hungry, and another is drunken. What? Have

15
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:21,040
ye not houses to eat and to drink in? Or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that

16
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:28,440
have not? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you in this? I praise you not. In

17
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:36,160
verse 17 and verse 22, you see repeated that phrase, I praise you not. The Apostle Paul

18
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:41,639
is dealing with a church that is a carnal church. In fact, we find that he mentions

19
00:01:41,639 --> 00:01:46,279
in verse number 18 that when they come together, that he heard that there were divisions. He

20
00:01:46,279 --> 00:01:50,639
says, I partly believe it. Of course, the Apostle Paul had been given a report about

21
00:01:50,639 --> 00:01:53,800
the things that were taking place in the church in Corinth, and if you were to go

22
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:58,279
all the way back to the beginning of the book, you find that he begins to call them out for

23
00:01:58,279 --> 00:02:02,639
those things, beginning in verse 10 of chapter number 1. In verse number 11, he says that

24
00:02:02,639 --> 00:02:08,919
there are contentions among you. And Paul was aware of the contentions and the divisions,

25
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:12,199
and he was aware of the fact that they were carnal. Remember, it's to this church that

26
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:15,919
the Apostle Paul says that I have many things to write to you, but I can't write them to

27
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:21,039
you because you're carnal. You can't receive them. You're not able to receive what I have

28
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:26,559
to give you. And so Paul, with regard to the instruction that we've so often referred to

29
00:02:26,559 --> 00:02:32,479
in this portion of Scripture as the instruction for the Lord's Supper, he begins with a very

30
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:40,119
strong correction to the church and tells them, I praise you not. They were not doing,

31
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:45,720
they were not observing the Lord's Supper in the manner in which they ought to be observing

32
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:51,320
the Lord's Supper. So then Paul begins to give them the instruction in verse number

33
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:58,119
23, of course, for us, the passage that guides us into the how, if you will, that we observe

34
00:02:58,119 --> 00:03:03,399
the Lord's Supper. And he says this, for I have received of the Lord that which also

35
00:03:03,399 --> 00:03:08,919
I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed, took

36
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:14,960
bread. We find that he begins to provide the instruction for us. And as we look at this

37
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:20,080
instruction that is here, we find that it's the most detailed instruction with regard

38
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,759
to this ordinance for the local church. And we understand that this, as we'd refer to

39
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:30,199
it as maybe a memorial, the Lord's Supper, that it is one of two ordinances that's given

40
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:37,199
to the New Testament church. This ordinance has a specific purpose, just as baptism has

41
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:44,080
a specific purpose. And we understand that just as so many other things have been taken

42
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:50,600
out of context, so also has the biblical teaching of the Lord's Supper been taken

43
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:55,639
out of context and misunderstood. It's been taught inappropriately. And so it's important

44
00:03:55,639 --> 00:04:00,520
that we understand the purpose, but that we do not misunderstand what God is giving to

45
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:06,240
us with regard to the Lord's Supper. We must guard against the Lord's Supper becoming simply

46
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:13,240
a religious activity. We must guard against it just becoming a religious activity.

47
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:20,880
You ever hear of the term rote religion? I mean, just going through the steps, if you

48
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:26,679
will, and just kind of on autopilot. How many of you know your ABCs? How many of you would

49
00:04:26,679 --> 00:04:31,480
we probably, if we're going to recite the ABCs tonight, probably almost all of us would

50
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:38,040
recite it the same way with the same tune because of how we learned it. It's rote. It's

51
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:44,359
rote learning. It's what it is. But we don't want to have rote religion, right? We don't

52
00:04:44,359 --> 00:04:49,200
just, it's not just a religious exercise. It's not just some religious exercise that

53
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:54,000
we observe the Lord's Supper on the whatever day or whatever it might be. No, this is a

54
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:01,000
sacred time for the local church. And it's so important and it's so vital that we understand

55
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,480
the instruction that God has given. Furthermore, we must understand that the elements of the

56
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:12,079
Lord's Supper do not have the power within them to save anyone. They do not have the

57
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:18,720
power within them to give anyone a certain extra special blessing. These elements are

58
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:25,720
elements that are representative of what or who the Lord Jesus Christ is, His body that

59
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:33,399
was broken for us, His blood that was shed for us. But these elements, the cracker, the

60
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:40,359
unleavened bread and the juice, the unfermented grape juice, those elements are never going

61
00:05:40,359 --> 00:05:45,279
to change into something other than what they are. They were put here, Holly prepared for

62
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:50,359
the Lord's Supper this afternoon and she put those elements here and those elements are

63
00:05:50,359 --> 00:05:56,480
always going to be what they were when she put them there. But they're a picture. They're

64
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:02,239
memorial. They're helping us to remember what Christ did. And so we find that as we go through

65
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:05,119
the text in verse number 24, the Bible says,

66
00:06:05,119 --> 00:06:09,679
And when he had given thanks, he break it and said,

67
00:06:09,679 --> 00:06:16,679
Take, eat. This is my body which is broken for you. This do in remembrance of me.

68
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:22,959
After the same manner also he took the cup and when he had supped, saying,

69
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:29,399
This cup is the New Testament in my blood. This do ye as oft as you drink it in remembrance

70
00:06:29,559 --> 00:06:36,559
of me. If I would think tonight of the Lord's Supper and the elements being a memorial and

71
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:43,920
a picture, first we must remember. You know, as human beings we're prone to forget. I mean,

72
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:48,359
I don't think any of us would come in here this evening and forget that Jesus died for

73
00:06:48,359 --> 00:06:54,279
us. But sometimes we don't remember with the same depth of appreciation that we ought to

74
00:06:54,480 --> 00:07:01,480
remember. We don't have the same level of remembrance every day of our lives with regard

75
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:08,480
to what Christ did. And I made this statement a number of months ago with regard to our

76
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,720
loving the Lord Jesus Christ as we should. And I said that if we'd take the time to read

77
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,279
the last couple of chapters of each of the gospel records that would go a long way in

78
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:25,320
impacting our lives and giving us a greater level of gratitude for what Christ did for

79
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:32,320
us. What does it do? It reminds us. Notice the price that was paid for my sin and for

80
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:40,320
your sin. The brutal death that the Lord Jesus Christ experienced on the cross of Calvary.

81
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:48,679
He said this is, as he talks about the bread, he said this is my body. Notice which is broken

82
00:07:48,679 --> 00:07:55,679
for you. We know that no bones were broken. And by the way, that's a fulfillment of prophecy

83
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:00,480
that not a bone would be broken. But we begin to think about all that the Lord suffered

84
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:05,839
on the cross and how his flesh was literally torn away and ripped away and all that took

85
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:12,839
place. And he says that it was for you. It was for me. We sing that song oftentimes.

86
00:08:13,119 --> 00:08:20,119
It's a song that we'll sing around the resurrection Easter season of it was for me. What a great

87
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:28,160
reminder. It was for me. He says this is my body which is broken for you. This do in remembrance

88
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:34,039
of me. Notice when he speaks about the cup representing the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ,

89
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:39,559
that sinless blood, the blood that needed to be shed for the remission of sins without

90
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:44,520
the shedding of blood. There is no remission. The Bible plainly tells us in Hebrews chapter

91
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:50,440
nine, we understand that all of the Old Testament just pictures that God gave us. We can go

92
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:57,080
back to Cain and Abel and we can understand the importance of the blood and we can understand

93
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,799
the pattern that was set forth of a of an offering and go even before Cain and Abel

94
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:08,559
and you can go to the garden and after the sin and entered into the world and after the

95
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:15,080
word there pronounces the judgment and they were clothed in leaves, right? They made themselves

96
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:21,059
coverings of leaves and it was not sufficient and what had to happen? Well, an animal had

97
00:09:21,059 --> 00:09:28,059
to lose its life and blood had to be shed so that God could provide for Adam and Eve

98
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:36,559
a covering of skin. We see throughout the Old Testament, you're reminded of the Passover

99
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:43,200
and the blood that had to be applied, the blood, the blood, the blood, the brazen altar.

100
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,799
I mean, every time that you would visit the tabernacle, every time that you would go to

101
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:52,760
the temple, the nation of Israel would be confronted upon immediately entering into

102
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:58,679
the tabernacle and then later the temple with the brazen altar where sacrifice was made,

103
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:00,000
that blood was required.

104
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:09,560
And Jesus shed his precious blood for us so that we could have eternal life.

105
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,060
It says, this cup is the New Testament in my blood.

106
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:15,979
This do you as often as you drink it in remembrance of me.

107
00:10:15,979 --> 00:10:18,639
We find that the Lord wants us to remember.

108
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:23,680
Not only does he want us to remember, but he wants us to expect his soon return.

109
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,559
The Bible says for as often in verse 26, as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you

110
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:33,000
do show the Lord's death till he come.

111
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,479
Obviously we understand that Jesus was buried in a borrowed tomb and he rose conquering

112
00:10:37,479 --> 00:10:38,680
sin, death and the grave.

113
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,119
We spoke about that a little bit this morning.

114
00:10:41,119 --> 00:10:44,959
We find that he's coming again and what a wonderful truth that is.

115
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:50,439
And every time we observe the Lord's supper, we show the Lord's death till he come.

116
00:10:50,439 --> 00:10:57,000
We're reminded of what Christ did for us personally on that cruel cross, but we're reminded and

117
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,919
we have that expectancy that Christ is going to come again.

118
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:07,599
And all what wonderful truth that is.

119
00:11:07,599 --> 00:11:10,720
We see that God provides this instruction.

120
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:16,000
And then as we move further into the text, we come to the portion that I really want

121
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,639
to focus our time on this evening.

122
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:25,040
In verses 27 through verse number 31, the Bible says this, wherefore, whosoever shall

123
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,879
eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body

124
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:37,319
and blood of the Lord, but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and

125
00:11:37,319 --> 00:11:42,879
drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation

126
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:46,839
to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.

127
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:52,319
For this cause, many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves,

128
00:11:52,319 --> 00:11:56,400
we should not be judged.

129
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:00,279
As we look at this portion of Scripture and really the title for the message this evening

130
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:05,480
is let a man examine himself from verse 28, we find in verse 27 and then again in verse

131
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,279
number 29 that God uses this word unworthily.

132
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:14,639
And it's a word that is so important for us to understand and the reality is that in of

133
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,880
ourselves none of us are worthy.

134
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:23,279
The reality is that none of us on our own merit, on our own worth can enter, can even

135
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:27,559
come close to the throne room of God.

136
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:29,800
Amen?

137
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:35,479
But I'm reminded of the wonderful truth that God gives us in 2 Corinthians 5 verse 21,

138
00:12:35,479 --> 00:12:41,660
for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness

139
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,160
of God in him.

140
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:48,160
And now as I approach the throne of God, as I enter into the presence of God, I'm doing

141
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:56,839
it not on my merit, not by my worth, but because I have been saved by the grace of God.

142
00:12:56,839 --> 00:12:59,720
And I have been clothed in his righteousness.

143
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:06,360
It's not my own righteousness, it is the righteousness of Christ that has been imputed upon me.

144
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:12,720
And so when we understand that truth, we must acknowledge that now as Paul is writing to

145
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,880
this church at Corinth and he speaks about this subject of being unworthy and eating

146
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:23,039
and drinking unworthily, I believe that what Paul is dealing with and what God wants us

147
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:28,839
to focus on this evening as we look at this truth and as we examine ourselves and prepare

148
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:33,440
ourselves for observing and partaking of the Lord's Supper, that it is important that we

149
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,699
have no unconfessed sin in our lives.

150
00:13:38,699 --> 00:13:44,460
It is unconfessed sin in the life of a believer that would lead the believer to being in a

151
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:49,460
place of verse 27 and verse 29 of being unworthy to partake.

152
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:53,979
Now I've said this for many years and it's worth repeating again this evening.

153
00:13:53,979 --> 00:13:59,100
The idea as we come to this portion of Scripture, as we prepare to observe the Lord's Supper

154
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:03,779
this evening, is not that I would sit in a pew, that I would examine myself and say,

155
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:08,380
yep, I have unconfessed sin in my life and so therefore I'm going to let the plate pass

156
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,580
me by.

157
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:18,279
The idea is not to be aware of the unworthiness and to stay in that state.

158
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:26,500
The idea of examination is for the Holy Spirit of God to expose and reveal sin in my life

159
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:34,140
that I would then confess that sin and have the promise that God gave of forgiveness.

160
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:41,660
It would be crazy to have known sin in the life of a believer and do nothing about it.

161
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:45,380
In fact, it says, whoso covereth this sin shall not prosper.

162
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:49,220
And we'll look at that verse here in the book of Proverbs as we go through the message this

163
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,220
evening.

164
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:57,260
As we begin to think about this idea and understanding that as believers we must determine to deal

165
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:03,859
with sin biblically, sin hinders my fellowship with my Savior.

166
00:15:03,859 --> 00:15:07,739
Sin will hinder your fellowship with your Savior.

167
00:15:07,739 --> 00:15:13,459
Sin will rob you of the joy that you can have in Christ.

168
00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:21,380
Do you remember what David said in Psalm 51, restore unto me the joy of thy salvation?

169
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:28,260
See David didn't have to get saved again, David just had to get right with God.

170
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:33,899
And David lost the joy of his salvation because of his sin.

171
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:39,220
By the way, David did not immediately confess his sin, did he?

172
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:43,739
He did just about everything a man could do to cover his sin.

173
00:15:43,739 --> 00:15:47,859
And it wasn't until Nathan the prophet of God having the message from God stood and

174
00:15:47,859 --> 00:15:53,940
said thou art the man that David confesses his sin and I'm thankful that God forgave

175
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,779
him.

176
00:15:55,779 --> 00:15:59,700
That's a great pattern for us this evening to understand the truth that our God is ready

177
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,820
to pardon and ready to forgive.

178
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:07,540
In this very book of 1 Corinthians as we would find that even prior to getting to the passage

179
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:12,380
that is before us this evening with regard to observing the Lord's Supper and the instruction

180
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:18,299
that the church needed to have and the importance of self-examination and the importance of

181
00:16:18,299 --> 00:16:23,100
eating and drinking worthily, we find that the Apostle Paul dealt with the subject of

182
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,100
sin.

183
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:27,820
We find that back, if you will, in 1 Corinthians chapter number 6.

184
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,820
Someone said this.

185
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:34,019
It's recorded a number of years ago that a member of a church said to the pastor after

186
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:38,380
the pastor preached on sin said, listen, sin in the life of a believer is different than

187
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:44,500
sin in the life of a lost person and the pastor said, yes, it's worse, it's worse.

188
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:49,579
What a perspective, what a proper perspective.

189
00:16:49,579 --> 00:16:53,980
In 1 Corinthians 6, the Bible says in verse 18, flee fornication.

190
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:58,540
Every sin that a man doeth is without the body, but he that committed fornication sinneth

191
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,820
against his own body.

192
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:04,820
Then notice verse 19 and 20, they're familiar verses of Scripture but worth reading this

193
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:05,820
evening.

194
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:06,820
What?

195
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:09,779
Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which you

196
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:12,420
have of God and you're not your own?

197
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:18,140
For you're bought with a price, therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit

198
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,140
which are God's.

199
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:24,619
In the 10th chapter of this book of 1 Corinthians, we find that the Apostle Paul beginning in

200
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:31,220
verse number 5 begins to share with the people there in Corinth about some Old Testament

201
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:36,380
examples and we find that he says of these beginning in verse number 5, but with many

202
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:42,859
of them God was not well pleased, for they were overthrown in the wilderness.

203
00:17:42,859 --> 00:17:47,820
Notice in verse 6, now these things were our examples to the intent we should not lust

204
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,899
after evil things as they also lusted.

205
00:17:50,899 --> 00:17:54,100
Neither be idolaters as were some of them.

206
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:58,820
As it is written, the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play.

207
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:02,820
Neither let us commit fornication as some of them committed and fell in one day three

208
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,440
and twenty thousand.

209
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:10,100
Neither let us tempt Christ as some of them also tempted and were destroyed of serpents.

210
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:15,140
Neither murmur he as some of them also murmured and were destroyed of the destroyer.

211
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:18,339
And I just want to pause here just for a moment because when we go through this list

212
00:18:18,339 --> 00:18:22,540
we can start out and talk about the examples in verse number 6 and we can come to verse

213
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:27,940
7 and say, okay, good, I pass, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not guilty of idolatry, I'm not,

214
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:28,940
I don't have any idols.

215
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:32,419
Now be careful because an idol is anything that we put before God.

216
00:18:32,419 --> 00:18:36,380
First John ends by saying, my little children, keep yourself from idols.

217
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:40,940
Not everything that was an idol for the children of Israel, when you think about these little

218
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:45,260
images and so on and so forth, and sometimes that's what comes to our mind when we think

219
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:50,460
of an idol, but an idol can be anything that's before God.

220
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:55,979
That in all things, according to Colossians 1, he, Christ, who is the head of the church,

221
00:18:55,979 --> 00:18:57,859
must have the preeminence.

222
00:18:57,859 --> 00:19:00,580
That's what the Bible teaches us.

223
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:04,799
And so we come to this one of idolatry and if we're not careful, we cannot understand

224
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:08,340
exactly what that is, we say, okay, I'm not guilty of idolatry.

225
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:12,619
We come to verse number 7 and 8 and we say, okay, I've not committed fornication, I've

226
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:16,020
not tempted Christ, but you come to verse number 10, neither murmur ye.

227
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:18,099
You know what murmuring is?

228
00:19:18,099 --> 00:19:20,299
It's complaining.

229
00:19:20,299 --> 00:19:25,700
If you somehow made it through verse 7, 8, and 9 and said, I'm not guilty of any of those,

230
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:33,859
you come to verse number 10, I'm pretty sure every single person is guilty of complaining.

231
00:19:33,859 --> 00:19:37,700
I said this to someone this morning, I don't know how many of you when you talk to people

232
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:42,780
about their salvation, you should have an opportunity to share the gospel.

233
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:47,659
I often will say, as I said to this man yesterday, I said, listen, the Bible says that all have

234
00:19:47,659 --> 00:19:48,659
sinned.

235
00:19:48,659 --> 00:19:50,460
Do you acknowledge that you're a sinner?

236
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:54,619
And he didn't say this yesterday, but many times over the years, people have said something

237
00:19:54,619 --> 00:19:57,700
like this to me, I've never murdered anybody.

238
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,940
And I'm like, man, that's good, I'm glad, amen?

239
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:04,380
And sometimes, as Christians, we almost take that same approach.

240
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:09,080
Well, I'm not really that bad, because I'm not like killing people, I'm not doing

241
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:15,000
X, Y, and Z, but the reality is that if you go back to the Old Testament and you read

242
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,440
about the situation with the fiery serpents, the Bible says that the people complained

243
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:25,820
and the Lord heard it, and He was displeased.

244
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:30,240
You know, when we complain, you know what, they complained about manna.

245
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,240
Did they not?

246
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,340
They loathed it, the Bible says.

247
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:39,460
They hated this manna, they despised it, but that was the provision of God.

248
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:46,700
Let me say it this way, that was the miraculous provision of God.

249
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:55,220
Sometimes we complain, and we must understand that our complaining displeases the Lord.

250
00:20:55,220 --> 00:21:01,020
In everything give thanks, for this is the will of God and Christ Jesus concerning you.

251
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:03,320
Is that not what the Scriptures teach us?

252
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,500
In everything give thanks.

253
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:10,160
Now in verse number 11, it says, all these things happened unto them for in samples,

254
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:14,620
and they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come.

255
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:18,800
Wherefore let him that thinketh, he standeth, take heed, lest he fall.

256
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:23,880
Verse 13, there hath no temptation taken you, but such as is common to man.

257
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:28,380
But God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you are able, but

258
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:35,380
will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that you may be able to bear it.

259
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:40,060
I'm thankful that our God is faithful, and I'm thankful that He provides a way to escape,

260
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:44,220
and we can look at the Scriptures, and we can look at examples, and we can find that

261
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:49,959
if you were to make a comparison between two Old Testament characters, one of Joseph

262
00:21:49,959 --> 00:21:55,800
and one of David, that Joseph looked for that escape route, that Joseph looked to get away

263
00:21:55,800 --> 00:22:02,000
from the temptation, that when Potiphar's wife, day by day, and finally came and kind

264
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:09,400
of cornered him, and had a, he, look, he left his coat, retained his character, his integrity.

265
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:18,619
He was lied about, he suffered, falsely accused, but before God, he was clean.

266
00:22:18,619 --> 00:22:19,619
Amen?

267
00:22:19,619 --> 00:22:20,619
Amen.

268
00:22:20,619 --> 00:22:29,300
David, on the other hand, when he inquired about Bathsheba, he was told who she was,

269
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:35,460
a man's wife, but he said, bring her to me anyway.

270
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:41,059
God provided a way of escape, but God doesn't make us escape.

271
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:43,220
God will provide the way to escape.

272
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,220
He is faithful.

273
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:46,220
The Bible says it right here.

274
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,199
God is faithful.

275
00:22:48,199 --> 00:22:49,740
God will provide the way to escape.

276
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,820
But you know what happens?

277
00:22:51,820 --> 00:23:01,619
Sometimes our flesh desires more the activity than it does the fleeing.

278
00:23:01,619 --> 00:23:03,699
Your flesh is strong.

279
00:23:03,699 --> 00:23:06,080
Your flesh is powerful.

280
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,839
Your flesh has an appetite, a desire.

281
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:11,339
And we find that God is faithful.

282
00:23:11,339 --> 00:23:15,500
We need to look for that escape route.

283
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:20,740
I think it was Pass the Pirate that put this song out years ago, put on your running shoes.

284
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:25,779
I mean, you just got to run.

285
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,860
He says, flee fornication.

286
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:31,660
Listen, there are some times you can find yourself in a position you just need to get

287
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,660
out.

288
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:33,660
Amen?

289
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,900
You just need to get out.

290
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:38,900
Notice with me in the book of Ephesians chapter 4.

291
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:45,139
Ephesians chapter 4, and this is really the statement that I made a moment ago where sometimes

292
00:23:45,139 --> 00:23:50,100
Christians and we think about, well, I'm not really doing, and we have in our minds

293
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:53,460
this list of the really bad sins.

294
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:56,460
And we think, well, like if we were doing these things, then that would really be a

295
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:00,220
problem and my fellowship would be hindered and I would.

296
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:03,580
But I want you to understand that as we come to Ephesians chapter 4 that God's teaching

297
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:09,660
us about this putting off and putting on principle that we find here and also in the book of

298
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:10,660
Colossians.

299
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:15,540
And you begin reading in verse number 21, it says, if so be that you have heard him

300
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:20,179
and have been taught by him as the truth is in Jesus, that you put off concerning the

301
00:24:20,179 --> 00:24:25,019
former conversation, the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lust and

302
00:24:25,019 --> 00:24:30,019
be renewed in the spirit of your mind and that you put on the new man, which after God

303
00:24:30,019 --> 00:24:33,059
has created in righteousness and true holiness.

304
00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:38,940
And so he gives this principle in verse 21 through 24 of putting off and putting on,

305
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:42,739
and then he's going to illustrate, he's going to give examples and application for what

306
00:24:42,739 --> 00:24:43,920
this looks like.

307
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:47,779
And I want you to understand that within the next several verses, he does not say stop

308
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:58,920
killing people, but he does say stop lying, stop stealing, stop being angry, stop speaking.

309
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,920
Look at it with me.

310
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:03,720
Verse 25, wherefore putting away lying?

311
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:09,040
Speak every man truth with his neighbor if we are members one of another.

312
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:17,920
It's really sad to me how in our nation today, there's a large percentage of people that

313
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:21,480
are just, they've come to the place, they're just okay with understanding that people are

314
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,519
not honest.

315
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:25,679
They've just accepted it.

316
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:30,720
You can read studies and statistics where they've just simply accepted the fact that

317
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:35,839
people do not speak truth.

318
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:36,839
That's just sad to me.

319
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:41,360
How many of you have heard somebody say, maybe your parents said, or you said it to your

320
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,720
children, honesty is the best policy.

321
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:49,040
You ever hear somebody say that or you said those words?

322
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:52,119
We could take it a step further and say it's the only policy.

323
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:55,660
I've told our children as they're growing up, listen, tell me the truth.

324
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:59,899
You might get in trouble for telling me the truth, but you're going to get in more trouble

325
00:25:59,899 --> 00:26:02,940
if you lie to me about it and then I find out.

326
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:03,940
Amen?

327
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:07,100
How many of you like being lied to?

328
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,260
Come on, anybody?

329
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:13,619
Oh, we don't like being lied to.

330
00:26:13,619 --> 00:26:20,059
So he says, in order to speak the truth, stop lying.

331
00:26:20,059 --> 00:26:24,179
That's the first thing that he talks about on the put off and put on.

332
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:26,000
That's the first thing.

333
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,980
Verse 26, be angry and sin not.

334
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:33,140
Let not the sun go down upon your wrath, neither give place to the devil.

335
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:37,619
Let him that stole steal no more, but rather let him labor, working with his hands the

336
00:26:37,619 --> 00:26:44,679
thing which is good that he may have to give to him that needeth.

337
00:26:44,679 --> 00:26:49,940
Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the

338
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:55,260
use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.

339
00:26:55,260 --> 00:27:03,700
We could park there for a little while, but our speech, you know, we can do more damage

340
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:07,779
with our tongue than you could even imagine.

341
00:27:07,779 --> 00:27:08,779
What does James say?

342
00:27:08,779 --> 00:27:14,580
It's a little member that kindleth a great fire.

343
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:18,100
Out of the same mouth should not proceed blessing and cursing.

344
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:21,540
I mean, it ought not be.

345
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:28,899
And we find that here he's talking about the importance of our words, not only removing

346
00:27:28,899 --> 00:27:33,860
certain things out of our vocabulary and certain things that we would not speak about, but

347
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:37,820
he says that we're to speak that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister

348
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:43,000
grace unto the hearers.

349
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:49,839
You can take out all the foul language and still speak ugly.

350
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:54,640
You can, but you ought not.

351
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,880
Minister grace.

352
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:02,839
Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby you're sealed on the day of redemption.

353
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:08,119
Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away.

354
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:14,920
Forgiveness from you with all malice, and be kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving

355
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:22,140
one another, even as God, for Christ's sake, hath forgiven you.

356
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:27,720
What a passage of Scripture that teaches about the sanctification of the believer, the putting

357
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:34,919
off and putting on, the importance of living a life that is pleasing in the sight of God.

358
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:40,119
As you continue into the fifth chapter, notice it says, be therefore followers of God as

359
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:46,080
dear children and walk in love as Christ also hath loved us and hath given himself for us

360
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,799
an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savor.

361
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:57,080
But fornication and uncleanness or covetousness let it not be once named among you as becometh

362
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:02,599
saints, neither filthiness nor foolish talking nor jesting which are not convenient, but

363
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:07,919
rather giving a thanks.

364
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:15,080
Eventually you come to verse 10 and it says, proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.

365
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:21,200
God's serious about his people being holy.

366
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:28,840
We see it repeated from the Old Testament into the New Testament, be holy for I am holy.

367
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:35,799
He says in Peter, in all manner of conversation, in every area of our lives, there's not a

368
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:41,479
sacred part of us and a secular part of us if we're saved by the grace of God.

369
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:42,479
Everything is sacred.

370
00:29:42,479 --> 00:29:44,159
It's to be holy.

371
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,159
Amen?

372
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:48,559
It's to be holy.

373
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:53,440
Psalm 19, if you will, we'll look at a couple of Old Testament passages and we'll wrap up

374
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,840
here in just a few moments.

375
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:55,960
But Psalm 19.

376
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:04,040
It's a familiar psalm that begins speaking about the heavens declaring the glory of God

377
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:09,640
and right in the middle there talking about the law of the Lord is perfect and I mean

378
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,000
what a great psalm.

379
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:22,080
We come to verses 12-14 as the psalm concludes and we find important truth for us pertaining

380
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,800
to the thought, the message this evening.

381
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:33,480
Verse 12, who can understand his errors, cleanse thou me from secret faults, keep back thy

382
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:43,280
servant also from presumptuous sins, let them not have dominion over me, then shall I be

383
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:48,720
upright and I shall be innocent from the great transgression.

384
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,560
Verse 12 talks about secret faults, verse 13 presumptuous sins and ends with the great

385
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,960
transgression.

386
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:59,920
It's interesting as you begin to look at verses 12 and 13 and you see how the Bible

387
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:06,680
says about these presumptuous sins, let them not have dominion over me.

388
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:14,320
Listen, sin will lead you into bondage, but here's the reality is that we, if we're saved

389
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:19,320
this evening, that we have been delivered from the bondage of sin.

390
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:26,240
I mean Romans chapter 6 clearly teaches that sin no longer has dominion over us, but when

391
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:32,160
we go back we become entangled again with what we had been delivered from.

392
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:36,680
Hebrews chapter 12 and verse number 1 talks about laying aside every weight and the sin

393
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:43,800
which doth so easily beset us and here in Psalm 19 it says that it would have dominion

394
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,760
over me.

395
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:55,360
Some have categorized verses 12 and 13 of sins of omission and sins of commission.

396
00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:00,800
The reality is that there were examples in the law as you would study through the Levitical

397
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:07,580
law that there were sins of omission and sins of commission, things of not doing something

398
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:12,040
that they just didn't know they were supposed to do or they had been ignorant of something

399
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:16,480
or sins that they knew they were committing something that was contrary to the law and

400
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:21,000
to the teaching and the reality is that for us this evening that we come to this place

401
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,320
and we have the whole canon of Scripture and we understand that we're to live lives that

402
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:31,160
are holy, that are clean, that are pure, that we say God help me here as we look at this

403
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:37,360
text to cleanse me from secret faults, to keep me from presumptuous sins.

404
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:42,160
That pride, you know pride is destructive.

405
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:45,760
Pride is so destructive.

406
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:49,800
Secret faults, again many have mentioned that as being sins of omission but I want

407
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:55,360
you to consider with me this evening as we could seek to try to make some level of application

408
00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:00,720
and take that phrase of secret faults and begin to apply it in a life today.

409
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:06,560
You know there are times in which people think, oh it's in secret, nobody knows about it.

410
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:10,640
But God does.

411
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,720
And you know what the secret sin does in the life of a believer?

412
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,280
It hinders their fellowship and robs them of their joy.

413
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:24,560
They might be able to hide it from every other believer that they know for a time, eventually

414
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:30,240
it will start being evident in their life like something's not right, can only play

415
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:39,160
the game for so long.

416
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:43,240
David thought he hid his sin, thought it was a secret.

417
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,240
God knew.

418
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,720
Achan thought he got away with it.

419
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,920
We're going to have another battle, we're going to get some spoil and I can bring those

420
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,720
things out and everyone's going to be fine.

421
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,320
But God knew.

422
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:04,680
Rachel thought she could take those idols, those images and hide them in the camel's

423
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:08,400
furniture in the tent and sit upon it.

424
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,840
But God all along knew all about it.

425
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:15,240
We can't hide anything from God.

426
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:20,600
Nothing can we hide from God.

427
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:31,560
Notice verse 14, let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable

428
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:40,600
in thy sight, O Lord, my strength and my Redeemer.

429
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:44,280
See the reality is that God hears all of my words.

430
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:47,200
God knows all of my thoughts.

431
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:51,240
God hears all of your words and he knows all of your thoughts.

432
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:59,040
You read the Gospels and many times the people were not saying anything verbally that Jesus

433
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,160
could hear but he knew their thoughts.

434
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:05,600
Why reason ye amongst yourselves?

435
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,880
How does he know what we're thinking?

436
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,440
Because he knows everything about us.

437
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:15,480
And the psalmist says let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable

438
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:19,080
in thy sight, O Lord, my strength and my Redeemer.

439
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:23,260
When I understand that he hears everything, he knows everything, it will have a great

440
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:26,360
impact on how I live my life.

441
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:29,560
Learning to live in the presence of God is what I call it.

442
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:32,100
That's what Joseph did.

443
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:37,280
You read in the book of Genesis in chapter 37 and you read and you understand the situation

444
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:41,660
that's unfolding, chapter 39, excuse me, and you read and you understand the situation

445
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:47,280
that's unfolding and you find there that Joseph, Mrs. Potiphar, she thought it was

446
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:55,200
the perfect opportunity but Joseph said how can I do this wickedness and sin against God?

447
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,240
He was in Egypt.

448
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,960
His dad wasn't there.

449
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:03,520
I don't think it would have mattered if his brothers were there but I think it would have

450
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:07,680
mattered if his dad was there, maybe from a human perspective.

451
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:12,640
But nobody was there humanly.

452
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,640
God was very present.

453
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:19,520
And so we learn to live in the presence of God.

454
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:26,520
Psalm 119 verses 9 through 11, a familiar passage, in fact I preached from this just

455
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:31,040
a few weeks ago in Psalm 119 and I'll just read it and we'll move on.

456
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:35,680
In verse 9 the Bible says, Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way?

457
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:40,640
By taking heed thereto according to thy word with my whole heart have I sought thee.

458
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:47,040
O let me not wander from thy commandments, thy word have I hid in mine heart that I might

459
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:52,080
not sin against thee.

460
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:57,160
I wonder this evening, what happens when we sin?

461
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,560
I mean how does it affect you?

462
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,760
Does it bother you?

463
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:10,080
Do you acknowledge that it hinders your fellowship and robs you of your joy?

464
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:13,400
Or we just kind of carry on through life and like, well everyone else is doing it.

465
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:18,000
I mean it's just kind of, it's not as bad as what some people are doing.

466
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,320
That's never been the litmus test.

467
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,940
That's never been the approach that God gives us in His Word.

468
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:31,340
I'm deeply concerned about my fellowship with my God because in His presence is fullness

469
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:34,920
of joy.

470
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:39,060
And I recognize as Dino Moody said that this book will keep you from sin or sin will keep

471
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,060
you from this book.

472
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:44,060
I've learned it to be the case.

473
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:47,740
The Bible says in Proverbs 28, I told you that we'd get to this verse of Scripture as

474
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:50,780
we conclude this evening.

475
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:52,220
I want you to read it with me tonight.

476
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:56,540
I want you to actually turn there and look at it.

477
00:37:56,540 --> 00:38:04,620
In Proverbs 28, I have the entire verse underlined in my Bible.

478
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:11,860
Some of you mark your Bible, some of you don't and that's a personal decision.

479
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:16,500
The Bible says, he that covereth his sins, what does your Bible say, what are the next

480
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,740
three words?

481
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:22,620
Shall not prosper.

482
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:25,380
Now we like the word shall, don't we?

483
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:30,420
I mean in Romans 10, 13, for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

484
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:34,260
We like that, don't we?

485
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:42,340
Here it says, he that covereth his sins shall not prosper.

486
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:55,540
It's a truth of God's Word that is not going to be nullified or voided.

487
00:38:55,540 --> 00:39:03,380
You say, I got away with it for a little while, you're not going to prosper, Bible truth,

488
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:10,340
you're not going to prosper, but I want you to see the verse continues and says, but whoso

489
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:20,540
confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy.

490
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:23,860
Which side of the equation would you rather be on?

491
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:27,380
I mean honestly tonight it's a simple question, I mean it's a no-brainer, right?

492
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:32,380
I mean as you look at the verse of Scripture, any individual would say, well obviously I

493
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:36,780
want to be the one that confesses and forsakes and I'm going to receive mercy.

494
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:40,940
I don't want to be in the side of the equation that I'm covering and not prospering, but

495
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:48,500
the reality is the human tendency is so frequent that we try to cover.

496
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:51,460
God knows about it.

497
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:55,300
You're not covering it from God.

498
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,020
You're not hiding it.

499
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:58,380
Hiding it from God.

500
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:01,340
Adam and Eve in the garden when they sinned.

501
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:02,720
They knew that they were naked.

502
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,920
They sowed those fig leaves and what did they do?

503
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:09,440
They tried to hide from God.

504
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:14,000
But you understand that God knew exactly where they were.

505
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,020
God knew exactly where they were.

506
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:21,140
The New Testament truth of 1 John 1

507
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:26,140
verse number nine, if we confess our sins,

508
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:31,180
he is faithful and just to forgive us

509
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:35,380
and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

510
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:39,540
Isn't that a wonderful promise of God's word?

511
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:48,820
And yet so often, God's people are guilty of covering

512
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,900
and hiding.

513
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:52,700
Thinking it's not really that bad.

514
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:56,700
It's not really that big of a deal.

515
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:00,020
I'm not doing x, y, and z.

516
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,660
Remember what Ephesians 4 dealt with.

517
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:06,780
Remember what we see about complaining.

518
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:08,120
God was not pleased.

519
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,580
I mean, surely God's not pleased with someone that murders,

520
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:14,420
but he's not pleased with someone that complains either.

521
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:18,700
And this evening, we must have this reset, if you will,

522
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:23,340
in our minds with regard to sin.

523
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:25,340
And we must come to the place this evening

524
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:29,180
as we look at this passage and let a man examine himself

525
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:32,220
and, Lord, search me and know me and show me

526
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:33,820
if there be any wicked way in me.

527
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:35,660
Lead me into the way everlasting.

528
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,860
And we'd come to that place where we say, listen,

529
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:41,620
there's no unconfessed sin in my life.

530
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:45,820
You're never going to reach a place of sinless perfection.

531
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:49,060
There were preachers of yesteryear that taught it.

532
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:51,260
I believe that it's wholly inaccurate

533
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:53,220
from what you read in God's word.

534
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:56,340
For God says in 1 John very plainly

535
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:58,260
that if we say that we have no sin,

536
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:02,300
that the truth is not in us, that we make him a liar.

537
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:05,300
But when we sin, we have an advocate with the Father,

538
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:07,460
Jesus Christ, the righteous.

539
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:10,780
And so we understand we're not going to ever become sinless.

540
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:14,060
But the reality is that we should be sinning less and less

541
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:16,620
as we walk closer and closer with God.

542
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:18,980
And we should have, and I'll use this term,

543
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:21,300
and I don't mean to use it inappropriately,

544
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:24,020
but we should have a short sin account with God.

545
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,380
What do I mean by that?

546
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:27,020
Well, the Holy Spirit, we should be walking

547
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:30,460
in such communion with God, abiding with him,

548
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:33,140
that when we sin, the Holy Spirit of God convicts us

549
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:36,100
and we immediately confess that and forsake that

550
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:38,660
and get that right and have that forgiveness

551
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:40,660
and have that restoration,

552
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:45,380
that restored fellowship and that joy.

553
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:49,300
See, this evening, this table that is before us

554
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:52,900
is a wonderful, wonderful table.

555
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:57,580
The Lord's Supper reminds us of what Jesus did for us

556
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:59,740
so that we could be saved.

557
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:03,160
It reminds us that Jesus is coming again.

558
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:08,740
It reminds us the importance of living holy lives.

559
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:11,500
Let a man examine himself.

560
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,940
For the invitation this evening,

561
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:17,220
it'll be the time of examination.

562
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:20,260
Oftentimes, I preach a different message on the evenings

563
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:21,780
of doing the Lord's Supper, and then we come

564
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:24,820
and look at this and we'll have a time of examination.

565
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:28,260
But for this evening, it'll be our invitation

566
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:31,260
that will serve as our time of examination.

567
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:34,020
And I wanna encourage you this evening

568
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:36,180
to let God have his way.

569
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:38,380
If there's someone confessing in your life,

570
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:41,500
he's done to Jesus, he's gracious and he's merciful,

571
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:43,180
he's promised to forgive.

572
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:47,580
He's a God who's ready to pardon, ready to forgive.

573
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:50,340
And I'm so grateful for that this evening.

574
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:51,660
And after we have our invitation,

575
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:54,620
we'll prepare for distribution of these elements

576
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:56,420
and observe the Lord's Supper this evening.

577
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:58,260
Father, we love you.

578
00:43:58,260 --> 00:43:59,540
We thank you for loving us.

579
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:04,220
Thank you for your word, the truth that's contained therein.

580
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:06,300
And I pray that in these moments of invitation,

581
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:09,100
you'd help us, Lord, to do business with you.

582
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:12,100
Lord, I pray that you'd have your will and way.

583
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:14,740
Lord, thank you that you're a gracious God.

584
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:16,020
You're rich in mercy.

585
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:20,540
Thank you that you're ready to pardon and ready to forgive.

586
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:21,780
In these moments of invitation,

587
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:24,260
I pray that you'd have your will and way.

588
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:25,180
We'll thank you for it.

589
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:26,540
In Christ's name, we pray.
