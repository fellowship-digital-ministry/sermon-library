WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
is chapter 11, and I know that the bulletin says Revelation chapter 2, and that was my

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.840
plan at the beginning of last week, and as we went through the week, God kept pushing

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.120
me, pushing me towards 1 Corinthians 11. We're observing the Lord's Supper this evening,

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:23.159
and I want to take some time to study through this passage as we prepare this evening to

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:28.120
observe the Lord's Supper. I believe that it's important to be reminded of some things

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:33.360
that God shows us here in this passage. Typically, we deal with verses 23 down through verse

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.639
number 31. I want to back it up and begin in verse 17 this evening, in 1 Corinthians

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:43.599
chapter number 11, beginning in verse number 17. Notice the Bible says now in this that

00:00:43.599 --> 00:00:48.599
I declare unto you, I praise you not, that you come together not for the better, but

00:00:48.599 --> 00:00:53.479
for the worse. For first of all, when you come together in the church, I hear that there

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:58.240
be divisions among you, and I partly believe it. For there must be also heresies among

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:03.599
you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you. When you come together,

00:01:03.599 --> 00:01:09.680
therefore, into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's Supper. For in eating, everyone

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.879
taketh before other his own supper, and one is hungry, and another is drunken. What? Have

00:01:14.879 --> 00:01:21.040
ye not houses to eat and to drink in? Or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:28.440
have not? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you in this? I praise you not. In

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:36.160
verse 17 and verse 22, you see repeated that phrase, I praise you not. The Apostle Paul

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.639
is dealing with a church that is a carnal church. In fact, we find that he mentions

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:46.279
in verse number 18 that when they come together, that he heard that there were divisions. He

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:50.639
says, I partly believe it. Of course, the Apostle Paul had been given a report about

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:53.800
the things that were taking place in the church in Corinth, and if you were to go

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.279
all the way back to the beginning of the book, you find that he begins to call them out for

00:01:58.279 --> 00:02:02.639
those things, beginning in verse 10 of chapter number 1. In verse number 11, he says that

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:08.919
there are contentions among you. And Paul was aware of the contentions and the divisions,

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:12.199
and he was aware of the fact that they were carnal. Remember, it's to this church that

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:15.919
the Apostle Paul says that I have many things to write to you, but I can't write them to

00:02:15.919 --> 00:02:21.039
you because you're carnal. You can't receive them. You're not able to receive what I have

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:26.559
to give you. And so Paul, with regard to the instruction that we've so often referred to

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:32.479
in this portion of Scripture as the instruction for the Lord's Supper, he begins with a very

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:40.119
strong correction to the church and tells them, I praise you not. They were not doing,

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:45.720
they were not observing the Lord's Supper in the manner in which they ought to be observing

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.320
the Lord's Supper. So then Paul begins to give them the instruction in verse number

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:58.119
23, of course, for us, the passage that guides us into the how, if you will, that we observe

00:02:58.119 --> 00:03:03.399
the Lord's Supper. And he says this, for I have received of the Lord that which also

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:08.919
I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed, took

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:14.960
bread. We find that he begins to provide the instruction for us. And as we look at this

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:20.080
instruction that is here, we find that it's the most detailed instruction with regard

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.759
to this ordinance for the local church. And we understand that this, as we'd refer to

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:30.199
it as maybe a memorial, the Lord's Supper, that it is one of two ordinances that's given

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:37.199
to the New Testament church. This ordinance has a specific purpose, just as baptism has

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:44.080
a specific purpose. And we understand that just as so many other things have been taken

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:50.600
out of context, so also has the biblical teaching of the Lord's Supper been taken

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.639
out of context and misunderstood. It's been taught inappropriately. And so it's important

00:03:55.639 --> 00:04:00.520
that we understand the purpose, but that we do not misunderstand what God is giving to

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:06.240
us with regard to the Lord's Supper. We must guard against the Lord's Supper becoming simply

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:13.240
a religious activity. We must guard against it just becoming a religious activity.

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:20.880
You ever hear of the term rote religion? I mean, just going through the steps, if you

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:26.679
will, and just kind of on autopilot. How many of you know your ABCs? How many of you would

00:04:26.679 --> 00:04:31.480
we probably, if we're going to recite the ABCs tonight, probably almost all of us would

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:38.040
recite it the same way with the same tune because of how we learned it. It's rote. It's

00:04:38.079 --> 00:04:44.359
rote learning. It's what it is. But we don't want to have rote religion, right? We don't

00:04:44.359 --> 00:04:49.200
just, it's not just a religious exercise. It's not just some religious exercise that

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:54.000
we observe the Lord's Supper on the whatever day or whatever it might be. No, this is a

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:01.000
sacred time for the local church. And it's so important and it's so vital that we understand

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.480
the instruction that God has given. Furthermore, we must understand that the elements of the

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:12.079
Lord's Supper do not have the power within them to save anyone. They do not have the

00:05:12.079 --> 00:05:18.720
power within them to give anyone a certain extra special blessing. These elements are

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:25.720
elements that are representative of what or who the Lord Jesus Christ is, His body that

00:05:26.399 --> 00:05:33.399
was broken for us, His blood that was shed for us. But these elements, the cracker, the

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:40.359
unleavened bread and the juice, the unfermented grape juice, those elements are never going

00:05:40.359 --> 00:05:45.279
to change into something other than what they are. They were put here, Holly prepared for

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:50.359
the Lord's Supper this afternoon and she put those elements here and those elements are

00:05:50.359 --> 00:05:56.480
always going to be what they were when she put them there. But they're a picture. They're

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:02.239
memorial. They're helping us to remember what Christ did. And so we find that as we go through

00:06:02.239 --> 00:06:05.119
the text in verse number 24, the Bible says,

00:06:05.119 --> 00:06:09.679
And when he had given thanks, he break it and said,

00:06:09.679 --> 00:06:16.679
Take, eat. This is my body which is broken for you. This do in remembrance of me.

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:22.959
After the same manner also he took the cup and when he had supped, saying,

00:06:22.959 --> 00:06:29.399
This cup is the New Testament in my blood. This do ye as oft as you drink it in remembrance

00:06:29.559 --> 00:06:36.559
of me. If I would think tonight of the Lord's Supper and the elements being a memorial and

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:43.920
a picture, first we must remember. You know, as human beings we're prone to forget. I mean,

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:48.359
I don't think any of us would come in here this evening and forget that Jesus died for

00:06:48.359 --> 00:06:54.279
us. But sometimes we don't remember with the same depth of appreciation that we ought to

00:06:54.480 --> 00:07:01.480
remember. We don't have the same level of remembrance every day of our lives with regard

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:08.480
to what Christ did. And I made this statement a number of months ago with regard to our

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.720
loving the Lord Jesus Christ as we should. And I said that if we'd take the time to read

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:19.279
the last couple of chapters of each of the gospel records that would go a long way in

00:07:19.279 --> 00:07:25.320
impacting our lives and giving us a greater level of gratitude for what Christ did for

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:32.320
us. What does it do? It reminds us. Notice the price that was paid for my sin and for

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:40.320
your sin. The brutal death that the Lord Jesus Christ experienced on the cross of Calvary.

00:07:42.279 --> 00:07:48.679
He said this is, as he talks about the bread, he said this is my body. Notice which is broken

00:07:48.679 --> 00:07:55.679
for you. We know that no bones were broken. And by the way, that's a fulfillment of prophecy

00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:00.480
that not a bone would be broken. But we begin to think about all that the Lord suffered

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:05.839
on the cross and how his flesh was literally torn away and ripped away and all that took

00:08:05.839 --> 00:08:12.839
place. And he says that it was for you. It was for me. We sing that song oftentimes.

00:08:13.119 --> 00:08:20.119
It's a song that we'll sing around the resurrection Easter season of it was for me. What a great

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:28.160
reminder. It was for me. He says this is my body which is broken for you. This do in remembrance

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:34.039
of me. Notice when he speaks about the cup representing the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:39.559
that sinless blood, the blood that needed to be shed for the remission of sins without

00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:44.520
the shedding of blood. There is no remission. The Bible plainly tells us in Hebrews chapter

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:50.440
nine, we understand that all of the Old Testament just pictures that God gave us. We can go

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:57.080
back to Cain and Abel and we can understand the importance of the blood and we can understand

00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:01.799
the pattern that was set forth of a of an offering and go even before Cain and Abel

00:09:01.799 --> 00:09:08.559
and you can go to the garden and after the sin and entered into the world and after the

00:09:08.559 --> 00:09:15.080
word there pronounces the judgment and they were clothed in leaves, right? They made themselves

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:21.059
coverings of leaves and it was not sufficient and what had to happen? Well, an animal had

00:09:21.059 --> 00:09:28.059
to lose its life and blood had to be shed so that God could provide for Adam and Eve

00:09:29.559 --> 00:09:36.559
a covering of skin. We see throughout the Old Testament, you're reminded of the Passover

00:09:36.919 --> 00:09:43.200
and the blood that had to be applied, the blood, the blood, the blood, the brazen altar.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:46.799
I mean, every time that you would visit the tabernacle, every time that you would go to

00:09:46.799 --> 00:09:52.760
the temple, the nation of Israel would be confronted upon immediately entering into

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:58.679
the tabernacle and then later the temple with the brazen altar where sacrifice was made,

00:09:58.679 --> 00:10:00.000
that blood was required.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:09.560
And Jesus shed his precious blood for us so that we could have eternal life.

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:12.060
It says, this cup is the New Testament in my blood.

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:15.979
This do you as often as you drink it in remembrance of me.

00:10:15.979 --> 00:10:18.639
We find that the Lord wants us to remember.

00:10:18.639 --> 00:10:23.680
Not only does he want us to remember, but he wants us to expect his soon return.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:27.559
The Bible says for as often in verse 26, as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you

00:10:27.559 --> 00:10:33.000
do show the Lord's death till he come.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.479
Obviously we understand that Jesus was buried in a borrowed tomb and he rose conquering

00:10:37.479 --> 00:10:38.680
sin, death and the grave.

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:41.119
We spoke about that a little bit this morning.

00:10:41.119 --> 00:10:44.959
We find that he's coming again and what a wonderful truth that is.

00:10:44.959 --> 00:10:50.439
And every time we observe the Lord's supper, we show the Lord's death till he come.

00:10:50.439 --> 00:10:57.000
We're reminded of what Christ did for us personally on that cruel cross, but we're reminded and

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:03.919
we have that expectancy that Christ is going to come again.

00:11:03.919 --> 00:11:07.599
And all what wonderful truth that is.

00:11:07.599 --> 00:11:10.720
We see that God provides this instruction.

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:16.000
And then as we move further into the text, we come to the portion that I really want

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.639
to focus our time on this evening.

00:11:18.639 --> 00:11:25.040
In verses 27 through verse number 31, the Bible says this, wherefore, whosoever shall

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:30.879
eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body

00:11:30.879 --> 00:11:37.319
and blood of the Lord, but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and

00:11:37.319 --> 00:11:42.879
drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation

00:11:42.879 --> 00:11:46.839
to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.

00:11:46.839 --> 00:11:52.319
For this cause, many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves,

00:11:52.319 --> 00:11:56.400
we should not be judged.

00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:00.279
As we look at this portion of Scripture and really the title for the message this evening

00:12:00.279 --> 00:12:05.480
is let a man examine himself from verse 28, we find in verse 27 and then again in verse

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:09.279
number 29 that God uses this word unworthily.

00:12:09.279 --> 00:12:14.639
And it's a word that is so important for us to understand and the reality is that in of

00:12:14.639 --> 00:12:17.880
ourselves none of us are worthy.

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:23.279
The reality is that none of us on our own merit, on our own worth can enter, can even

00:12:23.279 --> 00:12:27.559
come close to the throne room of God.

00:12:27.559 --> 00:12:29.800
Amen?

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:35.479
But I'm reminded of the wonderful truth that God gives us in 2 Corinthians 5 verse 21,

00:12:35.479 --> 00:12:41.660
for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:43.160
of God in him.

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:48.160
And now as I approach the throne of God, as I enter into the presence of God, I'm doing

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:56.839
it not on my merit, not by my worth, but because I have been saved by the grace of God.

00:12:56.839 --> 00:12:59.720
And I have been clothed in his righteousness.

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:06.360
It's not my own righteousness, it is the righteousness of Christ that has been imputed upon me.

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:12.720
And so when we understand that truth, we must acknowledge that now as Paul is writing to

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:17.880
this church at Corinth and he speaks about this subject of being unworthy and eating

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:23.039
and drinking unworthily, I believe that what Paul is dealing with and what God wants us

00:13:23.039 --> 00:13:28.839
to focus on this evening as we look at this truth and as we examine ourselves and prepare

00:13:28.839 --> 00:13:33.440
ourselves for observing and partaking of the Lord's Supper, that it is important that we

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:38.699
have no unconfessed sin in our lives.

00:13:38.699 --> 00:13:44.460
It is unconfessed sin in the life of a believer that would lead the believer to being in a

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:49.460
place of verse 27 and verse 29 of being unworthy to partake.

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:53.979
Now I've said this for many years and it's worth repeating again this evening.

00:13:53.979 --> 00:13:59.100
The idea as we come to this portion of Scripture, as we prepare to observe the Lord's Supper

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:03.779
this evening, is not that I would sit in a pew, that I would examine myself and say,

00:14:03.779 --> 00:14:08.380
yep, I have unconfessed sin in my life and so therefore I'm going to let the plate pass

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:09.580
me by.

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:18.279
The idea is not to be aware of the unworthiness and to stay in that state.

00:14:18.279 --> 00:14:26.500
The idea of examination is for the Holy Spirit of God to expose and reveal sin in my life

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:34.140
that I would then confess that sin and have the promise that God gave of forgiveness.

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:41.660
It would be crazy to have known sin in the life of a believer and do nothing about it.

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:45.380
In fact, it says, whoso covereth this sin shall not prosper.

00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:49.220
And we'll look at that verse here in the book of Proverbs as we go through the message this

00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:50.220
evening.

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:57.260
As we begin to think about this idea and understanding that as believers we must determine to deal

00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:03.859
with sin biblically, sin hinders my fellowship with my Savior.

00:15:03.859 --> 00:15:07.739
Sin will hinder your fellowship with your Savior.

00:15:07.739 --> 00:15:13.459
Sin will rob you of the joy that you can have in Christ.

00:15:13.459 --> 00:15:21.380
Do you remember what David said in Psalm 51, restore unto me the joy of thy salvation?

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:28.260
See David didn't have to get saved again, David just had to get right with God.

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:33.899
And David lost the joy of his salvation because of his sin.

00:15:33.899 --> 00:15:39.220
By the way, David did not immediately confess his sin, did he?

00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:43.739
He did just about everything a man could do to cover his sin.

00:15:43.739 --> 00:15:47.859
And it wasn't until Nathan the prophet of God having the message from God stood and

00:15:47.859 --> 00:15:53.940
said thou art the man that David confesses his sin and I'm thankful that God forgave

00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:55.779
him.

00:15:55.779 --> 00:15:59.700
That's a great pattern for us this evening to understand the truth that our God is ready

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:01.820
to pardon and ready to forgive.

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:07.540
In this very book of 1 Corinthians as we would find that even prior to getting to the passage

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:12.380
that is before us this evening with regard to observing the Lord's Supper and the instruction

00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:18.299
that the church needed to have and the importance of self-examination and the importance of

00:16:18.299 --> 00:16:23.100
eating and drinking worthily, we find that the Apostle Paul dealt with the subject of

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:24.100
sin.

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:27.820
We find that back, if you will, in 1 Corinthians chapter number 6.

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:28.820
Someone said this.

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:34.019
It's recorded a number of years ago that a member of a church said to the pastor after

00:16:34.019 --> 00:16:38.380
the pastor preached on sin said, listen, sin in the life of a believer is different than

00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:44.500
sin in the life of a lost person and the pastor said, yes, it's worse, it's worse.

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:49.579
What a perspective, what a proper perspective.

00:16:49.579 --> 00:16:53.980
In 1 Corinthians 6, the Bible says in verse 18, flee fornication.

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:58.540
Every sin that a man doeth is without the body, but he that committed fornication sinneth

00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:00.820
against his own body.

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:04.820
Then notice verse 19 and 20, they're familiar verses of Scripture but worth reading this

00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:05.820
evening.

00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:06.820
What?

00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:09.779
Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which you

00:17:09.779 --> 00:17:12.420
have of God and you're not your own?

00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:18.140
For you're bought with a price, therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:19.140
which are God's.

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:24.619
In the 10th chapter of this book of 1 Corinthians, we find that the Apostle Paul beginning in

00:17:24.619 --> 00:17:31.220
verse number 5 begins to share with the people there in Corinth about some Old Testament

00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:36.380
examples and we find that he says of these beginning in verse number 5, but with many

00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:42.859
of them God was not well pleased, for they were overthrown in the wilderness.

00:17:42.859 --> 00:17:47.820
Notice in verse 6, now these things were our examples to the intent we should not lust

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:50.899
after evil things as they also lusted.

00:17:50.899 --> 00:17:54.100
Neither be idolaters as were some of them.

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:58.820
As it is written, the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play.

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:02.820
Neither let us commit fornication as some of them committed and fell in one day three

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:04.440
and twenty thousand.

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:10.100
Neither let us tempt Christ as some of them also tempted and were destroyed of serpents.

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:15.140
Neither murmur he as some of them also murmured and were destroyed of the destroyer.

00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:18.339
And I just want to pause here just for a moment because when we go through this list

00:18:18.339 --> 00:18:22.540
we can start out and talk about the examples in verse number 6 and we can come to verse

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:27.940
7 and say, okay, good, I pass, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not guilty of idolatry, I'm not,

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:28.940
I don't have any idols.

00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:32.419
Now be careful because an idol is anything that we put before God.

00:18:32.419 --> 00:18:36.380
First John ends by saying, my little children, keep yourself from idols.

00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:40.940
Not everything that was an idol for the children of Israel, when you think about these little

00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:45.260
images and so on and so forth, and sometimes that's what comes to our mind when we think

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:50.460
of an idol, but an idol can be anything that's before God.

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:55.979
That in all things, according to Colossians 1, he, Christ, who is the head of the church,

00:18:55.979 --> 00:18:57.859
must have the preeminence.

00:18:57.859 --> 00:19:00.580
That's what the Bible teaches us.

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:04.799
And so we come to this one of idolatry and if we're not careful, we cannot understand

00:19:04.799 --> 00:19:08.340
exactly what that is, we say, okay, I'm not guilty of idolatry.

00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:12.619
We come to verse number 7 and 8 and we say, okay, I've not committed fornication, I've

00:19:12.619 --> 00:19:16.020
not tempted Christ, but you come to verse number 10, neither murmur ye.

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:18.099
You know what murmuring is?

00:19:18.099 --> 00:19:20.299
It's complaining.

00:19:20.299 --> 00:19:25.700
If you somehow made it through verse 7, 8, and 9 and said, I'm not guilty of any of those,

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:33.859
you come to verse number 10, I'm pretty sure every single person is guilty of complaining.

00:19:33.859 --> 00:19:37.700
I said this to someone this morning, I don't know how many of you when you talk to people

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:42.780
about their salvation, you should have an opportunity to share the gospel.

00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:47.659
I often will say, as I said to this man yesterday, I said, listen, the Bible says that all have

00:19:47.659 --> 00:19:48.659
sinned.

00:19:48.659 --> 00:19:50.460
Do you acknowledge that you're a sinner?

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:54.619
And he didn't say this yesterday, but many times over the years, people have said something

00:19:54.619 --> 00:19:57.700
like this to me, I've never murdered anybody.

00:19:57.700 --> 00:19:59.940
And I'm like, man, that's good, I'm glad, amen?

00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:04.380
And sometimes, as Christians, we almost take that same approach.

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:09.080
Well, I'm not really that bad, because I'm not like killing people, I'm not doing

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:15.000
X, Y, and Z, but the reality is that if you go back to the Old Testament and you read

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.440
about the situation with the fiery serpents, the Bible says that the people complained

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:25.820
and the Lord heard it, and He was displeased.

00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:30.240
You know, when we complain, you know what, they complained about manna.

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:31.240
Did they not?

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:33.340
They loathed it, the Bible says.

00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:39.460
They hated this manna, they despised it, but that was the provision of God.

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:46.700
Let me say it this way, that was the miraculous provision of God.

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:55.220
Sometimes we complain, and we must understand that our complaining displeases the Lord.

00:20:55.220 --> 00:21:01.020
In everything give thanks, for this is the will of God and Christ Jesus concerning you.

00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:03.320
Is that not what the Scriptures teach us?

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:05.500
In everything give thanks.

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:10.160
Now in verse number 11, it says, all these things happened unto them for in samples,

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:14.620
and they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come.

00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:18.800
Wherefore let him that thinketh, he standeth, take heed, lest he fall.

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:23.880
Verse 13, there hath no temptation taken you, but such as is common to man.

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:28.380
But God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you are able, but

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:35.380
will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that you may be able to bear it.

00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:40.060
I'm thankful that our God is faithful, and I'm thankful that He provides a way to escape,

00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:44.220
and we can look at the Scriptures, and we can look at examples, and we can find that

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:49.959
if you were to make a comparison between two Old Testament characters, one of Joseph

00:21:49.959 --> 00:21:55.800
and one of David, that Joseph looked for that escape route, that Joseph looked to get away

00:21:55.800 --> 00:22:02.000
from the temptation, that when Potiphar's wife, day by day, and finally came and kind

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:09.400
of cornered him, and had a, he, look, he left his coat, retained his character, his integrity.

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:18.619
He was lied about, he suffered, falsely accused, but before God, he was clean.

00:22:18.619 --> 00:22:19.619
Amen?

00:22:19.619 --> 00:22:20.619
Amen.

00:22:20.619 --> 00:22:29.300
David, on the other hand, when he inquired about Bathsheba, he was told who she was,

00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:35.460
a man's wife, but he said, bring her to me anyway.

00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:41.059
God provided a way of escape, but God doesn't make us escape.

00:22:41.059 --> 00:22:43.220
God will provide the way to escape.

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:44.220
He is faithful.

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:46.220
The Bible says it right here.

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:48.199
God is faithful.

00:22:48.199 --> 00:22:49.740
God will provide the way to escape.

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:51.820
But you know what happens?

00:22:51.820 --> 00:23:01.619
Sometimes our flesh desires more the activity than it does the fleeing.

00:23:01.619 --> 00:23:03.699
Your flesh is strong.

00:23:03.699 --> 00:23:06.080
Your flesh is powerful.

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:09.839
Your flesh has an appetite, a desire.

00:23:09.839 --> 00:23:11.339
And we find that God is faithful.

00:23:11.339 --> 00:23:15.500
We need to look for that escape route.

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:20.740
I think it was Pass the Pirate that put this song out years ago, put on your running shoes.

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:25.779
I mean, you just got to run.

00:23:25.779 --> 00:23:27.860
He says, flee fornication.

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:31.660
Listen, there are some times you can find yourself in a position you just need to get

00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:32.660
out.

00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:33.660
Amen?

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:35.900
You just need to get out.

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:38.900
Notice with me in the book of Ephesians chapter 4.

00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:45.139
Ephesians chapter 4, and this is really the statement that I made a moment ago where sometimes

00:23:45.139 --> 00:23:50.100
Christians and we think about, well, I'm not really doing, and we have in our minds

00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:53.460
this list of the really bad sins.

00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:56.460
And we think, well, like if we were doing these things, then that would really be a

00:23:56.460 --> 00:24:00.220
problem and my fellowship would be hindered and I would.

00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:03.580
But I want you to understand that as we come to Ephesians chapter 4 that God's teaching

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:09.660
us about this putting off and putting on principle that we find here and also in the book of

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:10.660
Colossians.

00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:15.540
And you begin reading in verse number 21, it says, if so be that you have heard him

00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:20.179
and have been taught by him as the truth is in Jesus, that you put off concerning the

00:24:20.179 --> 00:24:25.019
former conversation, the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lust and

00:24:25.019 --> 00:24:30.019
be renewed in the spirit of your mind and that you put on the new man, which after God

00:24:30.019 --> 00:24:33.059
has created in righteousness and true holiness.

00:24:33.059 --> 00:24:38.940
And so he gives this principle in verse 21 through 24 of putting off and putting on,

00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:42.739
and then he's going to illustrate, he's going to give examples and application for what

00:24:42.739 --> 00:24:43.920
this looks like.

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:47.779
And I want you to understand that within the next several verses, he does not say stop

00:24:47.779 --> 00:24:58.920
killing people, but he does say stop lying, stop stealing, stop being angry, stop speaking.

00:24:58.920 --> 00:24:59.920
Look at it with me.

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:03.720
Verse 25, wherefore putting away lying?

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:09.040
Speak every man truth with his neighbor if we are members one of another.

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:17.920
It's really sad to me how in our nation today, there's a large percentage of people that

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:21.480
are just, they've come to the place, they're just okay with understanding that people are

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:23.519
not honest.

00:25:23.519 --> 00:25:25.679
They've just accepted it.

00:25:25.679 --> 00:25:30.720
You can read studies and statistics where they've just simply accepted the fact that

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:35.839
people do not speak truth.

00:25:35.839 --> 00:25:36.839
That's just sad to me.

00:25:36.839 --> 00:25:41.360
How many of you have heard somebody say, maybe your parents said, or you said it to your

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:45.720
children, honesty is the best policy.

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:49.040
You ever hear somebody say that or you said those words?

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:52.119
We could take it a step further and say it's the only policy.

00:25:52.119 --> 00:25:55.660
I've told our children as they're growing up, listen, tell me the truth.

00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:59.899
You might get in trouble for telling me the truth, but you're going to get in more trouble

00:25:59.899 --> 00:26:02.940
if you lie to me about it and then I find out.

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:03.940
Amen?

00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:07.100
How many of you like being lied to?

00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:09.260
Come on, anybody?

00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:13.619
Oh, we don't like being lied to.

00:26:13.619 --> 00:26:20.059
So he says, in order to speak the truth, stop lying.

00:26:20.059 --> 00:26:24.179
That's the first thing that he talks about on the put off and put on.

00:26:24.179 --> 00:26:26.000
That's the first thing.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.980
Verse 26, be angry and sin not.

00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:33.140
Let not the sun go down upon your wrath, neither give place to the devil.

00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:37.619
Let him that stole steal no more, but rather let him labor, working with his hands the

00:26:37.619 --> 00:26:44.679
thing which is good that he may have to give to him that needeth.

00:26:44.679 --> 00:26:49.940
Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:55.260
use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.

00:26:55.260 --> 00:27:03.700
We could park there for a little while, but our speech, you know, we can do more damage

00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:07.779
with our tongue than you could even imagine.

00:27:07.779 --> 00:27:08.779
What does James say?

00:27:08.779 --> 00:27:14.580
It's a little member that kindleth a great fire.

00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:18.100
Out of the same mouth should not proceed blessing and cursing.

00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:21.540
I mean, it ought not be.

00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:28.899
And we find that here he's talking about the importance of our words, not only removing

00:27:28.899 --> 00:27:33.860
certain things out of our vocabulary and certain things that we would not speak about, but

00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:37.820
he says that we're to speak that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister

00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:43.000
grace unto the hearers.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:49.839
You can take out all the foul language and still speak ugly.

00:27:49.839 --> 00:27:54.640
You can, but you ought not.

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:56.880
Minister grace.

00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:02.839
Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby you're sealed on the day of redemption.

00:28:02.839 --> 00:28:08.119
Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away.

00:28:08.119 --> 00:28:14.920
Forgiveness from you with all malice, and be kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving

00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:22.140
one another, even as God, for Christ's sake, hath forgiven you.

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:27.720
What a passage of Scripture that teaches about the sanctification of the believer, the putting

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:34.919
off and putting on, the importance of living a life that is pleasing in the sight of God.

00:28:34.919 --> 00:28:40.119
As you continue into the fifth chapter, notice it says, be therefore followers of God as

00:28:40.119 --> 00:28:46.080
dear children and walk in love as Christ also hath loved us and hath given himself for us

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:49.799
an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savor.

00:28:49.799 --> 00:28:57.080
But fornication and uncleanness or covetousness let it not be once named among you as becometh

00:28:57.080 --> 00:29:02.599
saints, neither filthiness nor foolish talking nor jesting which are not convenient, but

00:29:02.599 --> 00:29:07.919
rather giving a thanks.

00:29:07.919 --> 00:29:15.080
Eventually you come to verse 10 and it says, proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:21.200
God's serious about his people being holy.

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:28.840
We see it repeated from the Old Testament into the New Testament, be holy for I am holy.

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:35.799
He says in Peter, in all manner of conversation, in every area of our lives, there's not a

00:29:35.799 --> 00:29:41.479
sacred part of us and a secular part of us if we're saved by the grace of God.

00:29:41.479 --> 00:29:42.479
Everything is sacred.

00:29:42.479 --> 00:29:44.159
It's to be holy.

00:29:44.159 --> 00:29:45.159
Amen?

00:29:45.159 --> 00:29:48.559
It's to be holy.

00:29:48.559 --> 00:29:53.440
Psalm 19, if you will, we'll look at a couple of Old Testament passages and we'll wrap up

00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:54.840
here in just a few moments.

00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:55.960
But Psalm 19.

00:29:55.960 --> 00:30:04.040
It's a familiar psalm that begins speaking about the heavens declaring the glory of God

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:09.640
and right in the middle there talking about the law of the Lord is perfect and I mean

00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:12.000
what a great psalm.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:22.080
We come to verses 12-14 as the psalm concludes and we find important truth for us pertaining

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:25.800
to the thought, the message this evening.

00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:33.480
Verse 12, who can understand his errors, cleanse thou me from secret faults, keep back thy

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:43.280
servant also from presumptuous sins, let them not have dominion over me, then shall I be

00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:48.720
upright and I shall be innocent from the great transgression.

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:53.560
Verse 12 talks about secret faults, verse 13 presumptuous sins and ends with the great

00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:54.960
transgression.

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:59.920
It's interesting as you begin to look at verses 12 and 13 and you see how the Bible

00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:06.680
says about these presumptuous sins, let them not have dominion over me.

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:14.320
Listen, sin will lead you into bondage, but here's the reality is that we, if we're saved

00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:19.320
this evening, that we have been delivered from the bondage of sin.

00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:26.240
I mean Romans chapter 6 clearly teaches that sin no longer has dominion over us, but when

00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:32.160
we go back we become entangled again with what we had been delivered from.

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:36.680
Hebrews chapter 12 and verse number 1 talks about laying aside every weight and the sin

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:43.800
which doth so easily beset us and here in Psalm 19 it says that it would have dominion

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:46.760
over me.

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:55.360
Some have categorized verses 12 and 13 of sins of omission and sins of commission.

00:31:55.360 --> 00:32:00.800
The reality is that there were examples in the law as you would study through the Levitical

00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:07.580
law that there were sins of omission and sins of commission, things of not doing something

00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:12.040
that they just didn't know they were supposed to do or they had been ignorant of something

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:16.480
or sins that they knew they were committing something that was contrary to the law and

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:21.000
to the teaching and the reality is that for us this evening that we come to this place

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.320
and we have the whole canon of Scripture and we understand that we're to live lives that

00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:31.160
are holy, that are clean, that are pure, that we say God help me here as we look at this

00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:37.360
text to cleanse me from secret faults, to keep me from presumptuous sins.

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:42.160
That pride, you know pride is destructive.

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:45.760
Pride is so destructive.

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:49.800
Secret faults, again many have mentioned that as being sins of omission but I want

00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:55.360
you to consider with me this evening as we could seek to try to make some level of application

00:32:55.360 --> 00:33:00.720
and take that phrase of secret faults and begin to apply it in a life today.

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:06.560
You know there are times in which people think, oh it's in secret, nobody knows about it.

00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:10.640
But God does.

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:14.720
And you know what the secret sin does in the life of a believer?

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:18.280
It hinders their fellowship and robs them of their joy.

00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:24.560
They might be able to hide it from every other believer that they know for a time, eventually

00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:30.240
it will start being evident in their life like something's not right, can only play

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:39.160
the game for so long.

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:43.240
David thought he hid his sin, thought it was a secret.

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:44.240
God knew.

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:48.720
Achan thought he got away with it.

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:52.920
We're going to have another battle, we're going to get some spoil and I can bring those

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:55.720
things out and everyone's going to be fine.

00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:58.320
But God knew.

00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:04.680
Rachel thought she could take those idols, those images and hide them in the camel's

00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:08.400
furniture in the tent and sit upon it.

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:11.840
But God all along knew all about it.

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:15.240
We can't hide anything from God.

00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:20.600
Nothing can we hide from God.

00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:31.560
Notice verse 14, let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable

00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:40.600
in thy sight, O Lord, my strength and my Redeemer.

00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:44.280
See the reality is that God hears all of my words.

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:47.200
God knows all of my thoughts.

00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:51.240
God hears all of your words and he knows all of your thoughts.

00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:59.040
You read the Gospels and many times the people were not saying anything verbally that Jesus

00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:02.160
could hear but he knew their thoughts.

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:05.600
Why reason ye amongst yourselves?

00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:07.880
How does he know what we're thinking?

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:10.440
Because he knows everything about us.

00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:15.480
And the psalmist says let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:19.080
in thy sight, O Lord, my strength and my Redeemer.

00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:23.260
When I understand that he hears everything, he knows everything, it will have a great

00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:26.360
impact on how I live my life.

00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:29.560
Learning to live in the presence of God is what I call it.

00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:32.100
That's what Joseph did.

00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:37.280
You read in the book of Genesis in chapter 37 and you read and you understand the situation

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:41.660
that's unfolding, chapter 39, excuse me, and you read and you understand the situation

00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:47.280
that's unfolding and you find there that Joseph, Mrs. Potiphar, she thought it was

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:55.200
the perfect opportunity but Joseph said how can I do this wickedness and sin against God?

00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:58.240
He was in Egypt.

00:35:58.240 --> 00:35:59.960
His dad wasn't there.

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:03.520
I don't think it would have mattered if his brothers were there but I think it would have

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:07.680
mattered if his dad was there, maybe from a human perspective.

00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:12.640
But nobody was there humanly.

00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:13.640
God was very present.

00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:19.520
And so we learn to live in the presence of God.

00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:26.520
Psalm 119 verses 9 through 11, a familiar passage, in fact I preached from this just

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:31.040
a few weeks ago in Psalm 119 and I'll just read it and we'll move on.

00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:35.680
In verse 9 the Bible says, Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way?

00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:40.640
By taking heed thereto according to thy word with my whole heart have I sought thee.

00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:47.040
O let me not wander from thy commandments, thy word have I hid in mine heart that I might

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:52.080
not sin against thee.

00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:57.160
I wonder this evening, what happens when we sin?

00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:59.560
I mean how does it affect you?

00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:02.760
Does it bother you?

00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:10.080
Do you acknowledge that it hinders your fellowship and robs you of your joy?

00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:13.400
Or we just kind of carry on through life and like, well everyone else is doing it.

00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:18.000
I mean it's just kind of, it's not as bad as what some people are doing.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.320
That's never been the litmus test.

00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:24.940
That's never been the approach that God gives us in His Word.

00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:31.340
I'm deeply concerned about my fellowship with my God because in His presence is fullness

00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:34.920
of joy.

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:39.060
And I recognize as Dino Moody said that this book will keep you from sin or sin will keep

00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:40.060
you from this book.

00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:44.060
I've learned it to be the case.

00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:47.740
The Bible says in Proverbs 28, I told you that we'd get to this verse of Scripture as

00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:50.780
we conclude this evening.

00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:52.220
I want you to read it with me tonight.

00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:56.540
I want you to actually turn there and look at it.

00:37:56.540 --> 00:38:04.620
In Proverbs 28, I have the entire verse underlined in my Bible.

00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:11.860
Some of you mark your Bible, some of you don't and that's a personal decision.

00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:16.500
The Bible says, he that covereth his sins, what does your Bible say, what are the next

00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:18.740
three words?

00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:22.620
Shall not prosper.

00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:25.380
Now we like the word shall, don't we?

00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:30.420
I mean in Romans 10, 13, for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:34.260
We like that, don't we?

00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:42.340
Here it says, he that covereth his sins shall not prosper.

00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:55.540
It's a truth of God's Word that is not going to be nullified or voided.

00:38:55.540 --> 00:39:03.380
You say, I got away with it for a little while, you're not going to prosper, Bible truth,

00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:10.340
you're not going to prosper, but I want you to see the verse continues and says, but whoso

00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:20.540
confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy.

00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:23.860
Which side of the equation would you rather be on?

00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:27.380
I mean honestly tonight it's a simple question, I mean it's a no-brainer, right?

00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:32.380
I mean as you look at the verse of Scripture, any individual would say, well obviously I

00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:36.780
want to be the one that confesses and forsakes and I'm going to receive mercy.

00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:40.940
I don't want to be in the side of the equation that I'm covering and not prospering, but

00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:48.500
the reality is the human tendency is so frequent that we try to cover.

00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:51.460
God knows about it.

00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:55.300
You're not covering it from God.

00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:56.020
You're not hiding it.

00:39:56.020 --> 00:39:58.380
Hiding it from God.

00:39:58.380 --> 00:40:01.340
Adam and Eve in the garden when they sinned.

00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:02.720
They knew that they were naked.

00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:04.920
They sowed those fig leaves and what did they do?

00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:09.440
They tried to hide from God.

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:14.000
But you understand that God knew exactly where they were.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:19.020
God knew exactly where they were.

00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:21.140
The New Testament truth of 1 John 1

00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:26.140
verse number nine, if we confess our sins,

00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:31.180
he is faithful and just to forgive us

00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:35.380
and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:39.540
Isn't that a wonderful promise of God's word?

00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:48.820
And yet so often, God's people are guilty of covering

00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:50.900
and hiding.

00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:52.700
Thinking it's not really that bad.

00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:56.700
It's not really that big of a deal.

00:40:56.700 --> 00:41:00.020
I'm not doing x, y, and z.

00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:01.660
Remember what Ephesians 4 dealt with.

00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:06.780
Remember what we see about complaining.

00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:08.120
God was not pleased.

00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:10.580
I mean, surely God's not pleased with someone that murders,

00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:14.420
but he's not pleased with someone that complains either.

00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:18.700
And this evening, we must have this reset, if you will,

00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:23.340
in our minds with regard to sin.

00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:25.340
And we must come to the place this evening

00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:29.180
as we look at this passage and let a man examine himself

00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:32.220
and, Lord, search me and know me and show me

00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:33.820
if there be any wicked way in me.

00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:35.660
Lead me into the way everlasting.

00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:37.860
And we'd come to that place where we say, listen,

00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:41.620
there's no unconfessed sin in my life.

00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:45.820
You're never going to reach a place of sinless perfection.

00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:49.060
There were preachers of yesteryear that taught it.

00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:51.260
I believe that it's wholly inaccurate

00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:53.220
from what you read in God's word.

00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:56.340
For God says in 1 John very plainly

00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:58.260
that if we say that we have no sin,

00:41:58.260 --> 00:42:02.300
that the truth is not in us, that we make him a liar.

00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:05.300
But when we sin, we have an advocate with the Father,

00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:07.460
Jesus Christ, the righteous.

00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:10.780
And so we understand we're not going to ever become sinless.

00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:14.060
But the reality is that we should be sinning less and less

00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:16.620
as we walk closer and closer with God.

00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:18.980
And we should have, and I'll use this term,

00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:21.300
and I don't mean to use it inappropriately,

00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:24.020
but we should have a short sin account with God.

00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:25.380
What do I mean by that?

00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:27.020
Well, the Holy Spirit, we should be walking

00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:30.460
in such communion with God, abiding with him,

00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:33.140
that when we sin, the Holy Spirit of God convicts us

00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:36.100
and we immediately confess that and forsake that

00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:38.660
and get that right and have that forgiveness

00:42:38.660 --> 00:42:40.660
and have that restoration,

00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:45.380
that restored fellowship and that joy.

00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:49.300
See, this evening, this table that is before us

00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:52.900
is a wonderful, wonderful table.

00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:57.580
The Lord's Supper reminds us of what Jesus did for us

00:42:57.580 --> 00:42:59.740
so that we could be saved.

00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:03.160
It reminds us that Jesus is coming again.

00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:08.740
It reminds us the importance of living holy lives.

00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:11.500
Let a man examine himself.

00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:13.940
For the invitation this evening,

00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:17.220
it'll be the time of examination.

00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:20.260
Oftentimes, I preach a different message on the evenings

00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:21.780
of doing the Lord's Supper, and then we come

00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:24.820
and look at this and we'll have a time of examination.

00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:28.260
But for this evening, it'll be our invitation

00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:31.260
that will serve as our time of examination.

00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:34.020
And I wanna encourage you this evening

00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:36.180
to let God have his way.

00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:38.380
If there's someone confessing in your life,

00:43:39.020 --> 00:43:41.500
he's done to Jesus, he's gracious and he's merciful,

00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:43.180
he's promised to forgive.

00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:47.580
He's a God who's ready to pardon, ready to forgive.

00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:50.340
And I'm so grateful for that this evening.

00:43:50.340 --> 00:43:51.660
And after we have our invitation,

00:43:51.660 --> 00:43:54.620
we'll prepare for distribution of these elements

00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:56.420
and observe the Lord's Supper this evening.

00:43:56.420 --> 00:43:58.260
Father, we love you.

00:43:58.260 --> 00:43:59.540
We thank you for loving us.

00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:04.220
Thank you for your word, the truth that's contained therein.

00:44:04.220 --> 00:44:06.300
And I pray that in these moments of invitation,

00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:09.100
you'd help us, Lord, to do business with you.

00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:12.100
Lord, I pray that you'd have your will and way.

00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:14.740
Lord, thank you that you're a gracious God.

00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:16.020
You're rich in mercy.

00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:20.540
Thank you that you're ready to pardon and ready to forgive.

00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:21.780
In these moments of invitation,

00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:24.260
I pray that you'd have your will and way.

00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:25.180
We'll thank you for it.

00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:26.540
In Christ's name, we pray.
