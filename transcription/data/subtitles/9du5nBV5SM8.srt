1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,099
number four this evening

2
00:00:02,099 --> 00:00:05,920
and i plan to preach this message last wednesday evening

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,880
uh... we were of course dealing with the power issue last wednesday night

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,600
and i'm not able to have services and we miss the opportunity to be here and

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,959
gathered together

6
00:00:16,959 --> 00:00:21,360
uh... but uh... thankful uh... that power of course has been restored

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,280
and uh... the long time but there's some folks in some of the parts of the

8
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:27,840
country that have had no power for a lengthy period of time

9
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,319
and uh... we ought to pray for those folks but uh... this evening i want to

10
00:00:31,319 --> 00:00:32,319
look at this

11
00:00:32,319 --> 00:00:35,319
single verse of scripture in james chapter number four

12
00:00:35,319 --> 00:00:38,799
and uh... before we get into the verse i want to remind you over the last several

13
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:41,000
weeks on sunday mornings

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,680
uh... we've been looking at that passage of scripture in colossians chapter

15
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,880
number three

16
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,319
now we've been dealing with colossians three really verses five through fourteen

17
00:00:49,319 --> 00:00:52,880
this past sunday morning we looked at verses fifteen through seventeen

18
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,279
and dealt with our behavior in the church house but in verses five through

19
00:00:56,279 --> 00:00:57,439
fourteen

20
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:01,279
we really spent three weeks examining that portion of scripture and it starts

21
00:01:01,279 --> 00:01:04,919
out with the apostle paul saying to the people at colossi

22
00:01:04,919 --> 00:01:09,199
mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth literally

23
00:01:09,199 --> 00:01:13,400
crucify your flesh that was the title of the message that i preached in

24
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,260
after we go through that portion of scripture look at all of those verses we

25
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,199
find

26
00:01:18,199 --> 00:01:22,360
that it's there in colossians three that the principle of putting off and putting

27
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,160
on

28
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,760
is given to us we find that the book of ephesians as well

29
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:30,120
but we see it laid out for us in colossians chapter number three

30
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:34,120
as we begin to focus upon that principle we understand the instruction that we've

31
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,080
been given

32
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,959
really to put off the old man with his fleshly deeds

33
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:41,639
you know your flesh has a desire

34
00:01:41,639 --> 00:01:43,400
we understand as we

35
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,400
uh... live in this world that after salvation

36
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:53,000
uh... our flesh still has a desire and we must learn to crucify our flesh

37
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,800
we must learn to put off the old man the flesh with his deeds

38
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,919
uh... we referred to it as being the old man with his grave clothes

39
00:02:01,919 --> 00:02:07,080
and we also understand that after we put off all these things that were to put on

40
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,679
all of these other things and as we begin to look at the put on

41
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:14,639
uh... principle and the truth there that were to put on the new man that we're to

42
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:16,520
walk in the spirit

43
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,119
i'm thankful for the promise that god has given us in galatians five that if

44
00:02:20,119 --> 00:02:21,520
we walk in the spirit

45
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,639
you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh

46
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:29,080
and what a blessing to know that with the power of god remember god's plan is

47
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,080
that we would be sanctified

48
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,119
that we would be conformed to the image of his dear son

49
00:02:34,119 --> 00:02:37,759
and as we go through that process of sanctification it's the putting off of

50
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:39,839
the old the putting on of the new

51
00:02:39,839 --> 00:02:44,960
and uh... what a blessing now as i think about those messages on sunday mornings

52
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,279
i am well aware of the fact that the enemy doesn't like that kind of

53
00:02:48,279 --> 00:02:49,839
preaching

54
00:02:50,679 --> 00:02:53,720
uh... the enemy don't like that kind of preaching why because he'd rather us

55
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:57,479
just go ahead and walk in the flesh and he'd rather us just go ahead and

56
00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:01,320
uh... flounder around and waste a bunch of time and so on and so forth

57
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:05,440
he's not probably he don't really have a whole lot of problems with the

58
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,960
of the nominal type of believer

59
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:12,119
and uh... just going through the motions and so when you preach messages a series

60
00:03:12,119 --> 00:03:14,520
such as this from colossians three

61
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:19,820
i find that the enemy doesn't like that kind of preaching and therefore i assume

62
00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:21,539
that the enemy has

63
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:23,979
or the enemy soon will

64
00:03:23,979 --> 00:03:30,220
increase his attack upon those who are desiring to be doers of the word

65
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:33,460
as soon as we decide that we're gonna start putting off all of these things

66
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,419
and putting on all these things and

67
00:03:35,419 --> 00:03:39,339
that the holy spirit of god is working through the preaching of the word of god

68
00:03:39,339 --> 00:03:42,979
and we determine that we're gonna walk in the spirit by the power of god not

69
00:03:42,979 --> 00:03:44,500
in our own power not in our own

70
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,699
might but through god's power

71
00:03:46,699 --> 00:03:50,899
uh... that we're going to to seek to be doers of the word and not hearers only you

72
00:03:50,899 --> 00:03:54,139
can expect that the enemy will intensify

73
00:03:54,139 --> 00:03:55,419
his attack

74
00:03:55,419 --> 00:03:59,600
and therefore the message this evening i trust will be a message

75
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,259
that will be both practical and applicable

76
00:04:02,259 --> 00:04:06,979
a message that will help us as we engage in spiritual warfare

77
00:04:06,979 --> 00:04:11,259
uh... the title if you're taking notes this evening for this message is simply

78
00:04:11,259 --> 00:04:12,259
this

79
00:04:12,259 --> 00:04:13,740
battle plan

80
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,020
for victory

81
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,420
battle plan

82
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,459
for victory

83
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:21,299
i'm thankful that the word of god tells us that we are more than conquerors

84
00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:23,140
through christ i'm thankful

85
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:26,299
that paul testifies in stands in great

86
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:30,820
uh... just uh... victory when he says thanks be to god which giveth us the

87
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,980
victory

88
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,820
through our lord jesus christ uh... john says this in first john

89
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,739
greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world

90
00:04:38,739 --> 00:04:40,059
we understand that

91
00:04:40,059 --> 00:04:43,660
uh... the word of god teaches us that we can

92
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:48,579
uh... be overcomers we can be valiant we can be conquerors in fact

93
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:52,140
uh... in first john two you don't need to turn there stay in james but in first

94
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,059
john two in verse number fourteen

95
00:04:54,059 --> 00:04:57,940
as john is addressing the young men in that verse halfway through the verse he

96
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:58,700
says

97
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,459
because you're strong

98
00:05:00,459 --> 00:05:03,940
but he's not speaking about physical strength because he says in the word of

99
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:06,500
god abideth in you

100
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,579
and ye have overcome

101
00:05:08,579 --> 00:05:09,899
the wicked one

102
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:15,140
oh what insight is given to us about being strong in the lord in the power of

103
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,140
his might

104
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:20,779
by that word of god abiding in us so the battle plan for victory

105
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:24,140
i believe is given to us here in james four

106
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,779
in verse number seven

107
00:05:25,779 --> 00:05:27,720
it's a familiar verse of scripture

108
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,660
it's a simple verse of scripture

109
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:33,260
but i hope again this evening that the message will be both practical and

110
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,260
applicable

111
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,019
that god would help us

112
00:05:36,059 --> 00:05:40,500
as we engage in spiritual warfare notice the bible says this in james four

113
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,980
in verse number seven

114
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,880
submit yourselves therefore to god

115
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,660
resist the devil

116
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,859
and he will flee

117
00:05:48,859 --> 00:05:50,500
from you

118
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,660
you're taking notes number one the principle of submitting

119
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:57,619
the principle of submitting the bible says submit yourselves therefore

120
00:05:57,619 --> 00:06:01,899
to god the word submit means to yield to obey to be subject to

121
00:06:01,899 --> 00:06:06,260
the word submit is synonymous with the word surrender and we often will use

122
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,059
that word surrender

123
00:06:08,059 --> 00:06:10,100
and speaking about in fact kimberly

124
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:14,260
uh... played on sunday morning for invitation i surrender all

125
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:19,420
and we understand the idea of this word submitting the bible says to us in james

126
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,380
excuse me in

127
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:25,220
uh... romans chapter number six the importance of whom we yield ourselves to

128
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:29,299
and we're to yield ourselves to god we are to submit to god

129
00:06:29,299 --> 00:06:32,899
see the reality is that this battle plan for victory

130
00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:38,739
begins not in my strength not in your strength but it begins in a submission

131
00:06:38,739 --> 00:06:41,220
to the omnipotent god

132
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,980
we need to be strong in the power of his might

133
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:48,019
and we find here that this principle of submitting is key

134
00:06:48,019 --> 00:06:49,660
we find it's the first step

135
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:54,040
uh... this evening you and i must recognize the lordship of the of the

136
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,459
lord jesus christ

137
00:06:55,459 --> 00:06:58,980
really in every area of our lives

138
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,100
and then submit completely

139
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:04,459
just come to that place of submission you know it's interesting to me

140
00:07:04,459 --> 00:07:08,459
uh... that this idea of submission really for the child of god

141
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:12,540
uh... at times seems to be a challenge it seems to be difficult for us to

142
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,500
really submit and surrender

143
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,579
to come to that place of yielding

144
00:07:16,579 --> 00:07:19,459
uh... oftentimes in our own lives we seek to

145
00:07:19,459 --> 00:07:24,299
to engage in warfare in our own power in our own might

146
00:07:24,299 --> 00:07:27,820
but remember we're told in ephesians that we wrestle not against flesh and

147
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:28,940
blood

148
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:32,380
thus we are to be strong enough in the power of god

149
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:36,500
uh... and to to go in his power it begins with the submission

150
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:40,019
i believe this evening that as we find the first reference here

151
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:44,220
uh... this this first aspect of this battle plan submit yourselves therefore

152
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,100
to god

153
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,579
that submission

154
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:49,579
think about this submission

155
00:07:49,579 --> 00:07:53,500
is an indication of humility

156
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,299
submission is an indication it really reveals

157
00:07:57,299 --> 00:07:59,100
our humility

158
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,700
which according to verse number six

159
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,179
leads to god's grace

160
00:08:04,179 --> 00:08:08,660
god's grace in this particular context is dealing with his enablement

161
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:12,579
uh... i'm thankful for god's saving grace but i'm also thankful for his

162
00:08:12,579 --> 00:08:13,619
enabling

163
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:16,420
and we find that the bible says in verse number six

164
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:21,299
but he speaking of god giveth more grace wherefore he saith

165
00:08:21,299 --> 00:08:23,660
god resisteth the proud

166
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:29,459
but giveth grace unto the humble submit yourselves therefore to god that act of

167
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:30,660
submission

168
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:34,539
reveals it's an indicator of our humility

169
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:37,979
and it's going to lead to god's grace his enablement

170
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:42,580
it's so critical it's so essential that we have the grace of god

171
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:47,219
uh... as we think about this battle plan for victory we need his enabling

172
00:08:47,219 --> 00:08:49,820
we need his power we need his might

173
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:53,979
we need to be strong in the lord and we find that it begins

174
00:08:53,979 --> 00:08:55,619
with submission

175
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:57,099
begins with submission

176
00:08:57,099 --> 00:09:01,739
i can't tell you how many times i've heard somebody misquote james four seven

177
00:09:01,739 --> 00:09:03,500
and here's how they misquote it

178
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,859
resist the devil and he will flee

179
00:09:06,859 --> 00:09:09,700
not what it says

180
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:13,859
you can try to resist as much as you want in your own power

181
00:09:13,859 --> 00:09:17,260
but you're no match for satan

182
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:19,739
but when you submit to god

183
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,979
and then you resist the devil

184
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:23,700
he will flee why

185
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,900
because satan's no match for you

186
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:30,619
when you're walking in the power of god

187
00:09:30,619 --> 00:09:34,859
and we must be careful to understand the importance of submission this evening

188
00:09:34,859 --> 00:09:36,979
it's the first step for victory

189
00:09:36,979 --> 00:09:40,340
uh... this battle plan for victory we see not only the principle of submitting

190
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,900
notice number two

191
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,900
the process of resisting

192
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,340
uh... the bible says

193
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:49,940
therefore submit yourselves therefore to god then notice it just says resist the

194
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:50,719
devil

195
00:09:50,719 --> 00:09:53,940
the word resist means to withstand it means to oppose

196
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:57,020
and i think about this idea of resist and as we look here in this particular

197
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,580
text of scripture

198
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:01,580
we say okay this is great i'm supposed to resist

199
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,280
We're supposed to resist the devil,

200
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,000
but my mind says how?

201
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,180
How do we resist them?

202
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,200
What do we do?

203
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,740
How is it that we are able to resist

204
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:13,060
the enemy Satan as he would come

205
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:16,780
and bring engaging in this spiritual warfare?

206
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,540
Well, I believe first of all,

207
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:23,660
we must put on the armor of God daily.

208
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,980
It is absolutely imperative

209
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,060
that we put on the armor of God.

210
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,220
Turn over to the book of Ephesians if you will.

211
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,680
I'm going to change your place here

212
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,620
and James will be back in just a few moments,

213
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,700
but I want you to notice in Ephesians 6

214
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,100
how that God gives us this truth

215
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,020
with regard to the armor of God.

216
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,780
Listen, it is absolutely imperative.

217
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,860
It would be foolish for someone

218
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,860
that is a soldier in an army

219
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:48,620
in a military campaign,

220
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,980
it would be foolish for them

221
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,900
to enter the battlefield without their armor.

222
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,660
Would it not?

223
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,860
There are certain elements that you would put on.

224
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,780
There are certain pieces of equipment

225
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,540
that you would be sure to put on

226
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:03,100
before you would go out and engage in battle.

227
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,500
Why? Because otherwise,

228
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,340
you'd be vulnerable to the enemy.

229
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,100
I saw a report just the other day

230
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,260
about an individual that was testifying

231
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,940
of just almost losing his life

232
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,660
by a sniper bullet,

233
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,940
but if it were not for his helmet,

234
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,180
he would have passed into eternity

235
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,260
in just a moment.

236
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,460
But that helmet,

237
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,660
I bet you that guy was happy

238
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,780
that he put on his armor.

239
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,620
Amen?

240
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,060
And so listen, in a spiritual sense,

241
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,300
we're engaged in battle.

242
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,820
If we were walking outside

243
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,620
and there's people shooting guns at us,

244
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,140
we're going to take some precaution.

245
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,700
We're going to do certain things, right?

246
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,420
We're going to make sure that we're going

247
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,100
with the armor that we can have.

248
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,460
Well, spiritually speaking,

249
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:48,380
you know that the enemy is firing his fiery darts.

250
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,180
We're engaged in spiritual warfare,

251
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:53,580
so how is it that I'm going to resist the devil?

252
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,460
Number one, I put on the armor of God.

253
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,660
Notice in Ephesians 6,

254
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:57,780
beginning in v. 10,

255
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:58,540
the Bible says,

256
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,820
finally, my brethren,

257
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,300
be strong in the Lord

258
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,540
and in the power of His might.

259
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,580
Put on, notice what it says,

260
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:08,420
the whole armor of God.

261
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,860
We don't select which pieces we think

262
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,900
are important for that particular day.

263
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,140
We don't go through and say,

264
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,180
you know what, that one,

265
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,500
I don't need that one,

266
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,940
but I think this one's important.

267
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:21,940
No, he says put on the whole armor of God.

268
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,500
Then notice he says this,

269
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,100
that ye may be able to stand

270
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,020
against the wiles of the devil.

271
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,700
Now I told you that the word resist

272
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,940
there in James 4,

273
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:34,700
in v. 7 means to withstand or to oppose.

274
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,420
We see here in v. 11,

275
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,780
the reference to that you may be able to stand

276
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,020
against the wiles of the devil.

277
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,860
Notice as we continue going through,

278
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,900
you'll make note of the word withstand.

279
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,380
In v. 12, the Bible says,

280
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:48,820
for we wrestle not against flesh and blood,

281
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,060
but against principalities,

282
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:50,900
against powers,

283
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,300
against the rulers of the darkness of this world,

284
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,860
against spiritual wickedness in high places.

285
00:12:55,940 --> 00:13:00,020
Wherefore, notice he's going to give this instruction again.

286
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:03,620
It's so imperative that we put on the whole armor of God

287
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:06,340
that he references it again in v. 13.

288
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:09,740
Wherefore, take unto you, again note,

289
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:12,060
the whole armor of God,

290
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,740
that ye may be able to what?

291
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:18,100
Withstand in the evil day.

292
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:21,580
And having done all to stand.

293
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,540
Stand therefore,

294
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:26,580
having your loins girt about with truth,

295
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:29,540
having on the breastplate of righteousness,

296
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:32,860
your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace,

297
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:36,580
above all, taking the shield of faith,

298
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,780
wherewith ye shall be able to quench,

299
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:42,540
notice, all the fiery darts of the wicked.

300
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,260
And take the helmet of salvation

301
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,300
and the sword of the Spirit,

302
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,780
which is the Word of God,

303
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:49,380
praying always with all prayer and supplication

304
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,300
in the Spirit,

305
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,620
and watching thereunto with all perseverance

306
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:55,420
and supplication for all saints.

307
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,820
I notice as we look at this list

308
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,060
that is provided to us with the armor of God,

309
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:03,940
it is imperative for us as the people of God,

310
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,020
if we want to resist the devil,

311
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,940
we understand the first step is that

312
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,460
that principle of submitting.

313
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,860
And I say, I am yielded.

314
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:12,700
I am submitting.

315
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,620
I am surrendering to God.

316
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,260
I'm not seeking to walk in my own power

317
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,700
by the pride that I might have.

318
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,540
No, I'm going to humble myself

319
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:24,300
and I'm going to submit myself

320
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,180
to the Lordship of Christ,

321
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:28,740
and I'm going to then resist the devil,

322
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,180
but I must follow the principle

323
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,780
of what it means to resist.

324
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,220
And the process, I believe,

325
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,460
begins with putting on the armor.

326
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,820
Right in the middle of all of this that is mentioned,

327
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,940
we find that, really, it's not in the middle,

328
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,300
it's towards the end that he talks about

329
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,220
the sword of the Spirit,

330
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,260
which is the Word of God.

331
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,860
I would say the second aspect of this process

332
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,500
that we would deal with for resisting

333
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,420
is that we must know this book.

334
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,140
We must know the Word of God.

335
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:01,300
It is absolutely essential for us

336
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,220
to know the Scriptures.

337
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,940
If there's a particular area in your life

338
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,180
in which you know that the enemy

339
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,320
seeks to attack on a regular basis,

340
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,340
maybe there's a particular weakness in your life,

341
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:17,420
I would counsel you to go find a bucket load of verses

342
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,300
that deal with that particular subject,

343
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,700
that topic, and just memorize them.

344
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,060
Commit them to memory.

345
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,540
Put them on index cards,

346
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,900
and put them in the dashboard of your vehicle,

347
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,260
on the mirror in your bathroom.

348
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,500
Put them all over the place.

349
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,340
Why?

350
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:33,280
Because you need to know the Word of God.

351
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,340
Because it's the only way,

352
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:38,140
that's the only offensive weapon that we have

353
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:40,340
when we put on this armor of God.

354
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,180
But then he says,

355
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,800
and take the sword of the Spirit,

356
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,780
which is the Word of God.

357
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:48,260
We understand that it's very unusual today

358
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,620
that we would fight with swords,

359
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,540
but at the time of this writing,

360
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,420
that was a very common practice

361
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,420
in how they would enter into battle.

362
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:58,540
It was absolutely necessary for a soldier

363
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,660
to be skillful with his sword.

364
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,780
Otherwise, it could end in defeat.

365
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:06,140
It could end in death.

366
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,620
And so in like manner,

367
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,540
as the people of God,

368
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:13,100
we must be skillful when it comes to the Word of God.

369
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:16,760
We must know how to combat the temptations that come

370
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,920
when the devil is seeking to tempt us.

371
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,180
We must know some verses of Scripture

372
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:25,880
that deal specifically with that temptation.

373
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,680
I'm thankful for the testimony of Joseph

374
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:32,200
when Potiphar's wife sought to,

375
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,240
on day-by-day basis,

376
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,700
sought to get him to commit sin

377
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:41,700
and commit just an awful, awful practice

378
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,720
of lying with her,

379
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,540
that he said,

380
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,560
how then shall I do this great wickedness

381
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,600
and sin against God?

382
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,200
He understood that it was a sin before God Almighty.

383
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,260
And this evening,

384
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,480
as we would understand the importance,

385
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,740
the process of resisting,

386
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,760
it's not just something that we say,

387
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,080
okay, I'm resisting.

388
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,400
What does that mean?

389
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,720
No, I'm actively resisting.

390
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,200
I'm putting on daily the whole armor of God.

391
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,280
I'm daily seeking to know this book

392
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,800
so that I can have an understanding of the Word of God

393
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,080
so that I can use skillfully the sword of the Spirit.

394
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:25,320
We find that back in James 4,

395
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,040
in verse 7,

396
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,720
there's the principle of submitting.

397
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,940
There's the process of resisting.

398
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,240
There's a promise to claim.

399
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:38,360
I love the last words of James 4,

400
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,460
in verse 7.

401
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,920
Because the Bible says this,

402
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:47,320
and he will flee from you.

403
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,640
Isn't that wonderful?

404
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,800
That's a promise.

405
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,200
Listen, God didn't say

406
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,480
all Scripture is given by inspiration of God, right?

407
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,600
God didn't say he might flee from you.

408
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,360
No, no, God's given us here

409
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,200
in this single verse of Scripture,

410
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,480
a battle plan for victory,

411
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,200
that when the devil seeks to tempt us,

412
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:10,040
when the devil seeks to come in and devour us,

413
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,400
he desires to do so.

414
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,720
Remember, Peter says that in 1 Peter 5,

415
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,400
when he likens the enemy to a lion

416
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,840
who walketh about seeking whom he may devour.

417
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,540
Again, in that text of Scripture,

418
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:24,720
in verse number 9 of 1 Peter chapter number 5,

419
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,120
notice what Peter says,

420
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:30,080
whom resists steadfast in the faith.

421
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,560
And again, we see that word resist, right?

422
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,520
So we understand this evening

423
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:37,119
that as we look at this battle plan for victory,

424
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:39,940
that God says, listen, it starts with submitting.

425
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,860
It starts with a submission.

426
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:45,460
And as you submit, you're revealing your humility

427
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:48,260
and it leads to the grace of God, His enabling.

428
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,100
And then you resist the devil.

429
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,179
You put on the whole armor of God.

430
00:18:52,179 --> 00:18:53,660
You know the Word of God.

431
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:56,860
You're able to use that sword of the Spirit skillfully.

432
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,860
And then you have a promise to claim

433
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:02,619
he will flee from you.

434
00:19:02,619 --> 00:19:04,460
That's wonderful.

435
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,700
He will flee from you.

436
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,700
I want you to think this evening,

437
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,140
as we look at this battle plan for victory,

438
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,179
and I want you to consider with me

439
00:19:14,179 --> 00:19:17,860
how this battle plan was implemented perfectly

440
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:20,500
in the life of the Lord Jesus Christ.

441
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,980
Take your Bibles and turn to the book of Luke,

442
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:24,179
if you will, in the fourth chapter.

443
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:25,980
In Luke chapter number 4,

444
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,960
God gives us a record of the temptation

445
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,660
of the Lord Jesus Christ in the wilderness.

446
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:34,420
And in these 13 verses of Luke chapter number 4,

447
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,980
verses 1 through 13,

448
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,580
I believe that it provides us

449
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:40,660
with a perfect implementation

450
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:43,820
by the Lord Jesus Christ of this battle plan

451
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:46,100
that we're speaking of this evening.

452
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,820
Notice with me as we started in James 4,

453
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,100
and we said that number one

454
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,580
was a principle of submitting.

455
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,980
Submit yourselves therefore to God.

456
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:58,500
Notice in Luke 4 in verse number 1,

457
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,340
the Bible says,

458
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,900
and Jesus, notice this,

459
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:05,200
being full of the Holy Ghost,

460
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,400
returned from Jordan,

461
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,600
and then, notice this,

462
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:13,400
was led by the Spirit into the wilderness.

463
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,700
He was led of the Spirit into the wilderness.

464
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:18,200
He did not go into the wilderness on His own accord.

465
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,000
Now, we understand that He is God,

466
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,200
but you understand that what Paul tells us

467
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,700
in the book of Philippians

468
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,200
is that the Lord Jesus Christ humbled Himself.

469
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,700
Remember that He took on Himself no reputation.

470
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,900
He took upon Himself the form of a servant.

471
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,200
He was made in the likeness of man.

472
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,600
He humbled Himself, became obedient unto death,

473
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,100
even the death of the cross.

474
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,800
And we see here that often the Lord Jesus Christ

475
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,700
would speak about always doing the will of the Father.

476
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,400
And here in this verse of Scripture,

477
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,300
in Luke 4 and verse number 1,

478
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,000
it tells us two important things

479
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,400
about the Lord Jesus Christ.

480
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,600
Again, we know that He's God,

481
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,300
but you understand that He's left us an example

482
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,300
that we should follow His steps.

483
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,500
And number one tells us

484
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,100
that He was full of the Holy Ghost.

485
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,200
And number two tells us

486
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,900
that He was led by the Spirit.

487
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,600
I believe that that reveals to us

488
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,700
a level of submission

489
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,400
on the part of the Lord Jesus Christ.

490
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,500
And I know there are some that would say,

491
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,100
how could He submit? He's God.

492
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,500
He is God.

493
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,100
It will make your head hurt

494
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,200
as you try to think about all of those things,

495
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,300
because the reality is that

496
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,900
as He humbled Himself and took upon Himself

497
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,100
the form of a servant,

498
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,600
the likeness of man,

499
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,300
there were certain things that He gave up.

500
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:36,300
He never gave up His deity in its entirety,

501
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,800
but we understand that He submitted to the will of God.

502
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,200
Remember, as He prayed in the garden,

503
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,600
nevertheless, not my will,

504
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,900
but thine will, right?

505
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:47,600
And so we find here that there's this first principle

506
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,900
that we see from James 4,

507
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,100
this first aspect of this battle plan.

508
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,300
The second aspect of this battle plan

509
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,500
that we mentioned in James 4

510
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,600
was the process of resisting.

511
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,000
And I talked about putting on the whole armor of God.

512
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,600
I talked about knowing the Word of God.

513
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,300
Notice, we won't take time to read the entirety

514
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,200
of the passage,

515
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,600
but I want you to note three verses of Scripture

516
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,700
in particular.

517
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,100
And notice in verse 4

518
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:13,500
that Jesus answered Him, the enemy,

519
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,200
the devil, Satan,

520
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,400
and said this,

521
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:22,400
It is written

522
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,100
that man shall not live by bread alone,

523
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,600
but by every word of God.

524
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,300
He's referencing a verse from the book of Deuteronomy.

525
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,500
He's using the Word of God

526
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:35,800
specifically with regard to the temptation

527
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,500
there in verse number 3.

528
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,400
The temptation was to command this stone

529
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,100
that it be made bread.

530
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,400
The Bible tells us that after those 40 days

531
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,600
that He was and hungered in verse number 2

532
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,400
because He did eat nothing.

533
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,800
And so Satan comes at that particular time

534
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,800
in that particular moment.

535
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,800
He says, hey, command that this stone be made bread.

536
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,500
Now could Jesus have done that?

537
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,800
Sure He could have done that.

538
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,300
But He said it is written,

539
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,100
man shall not live by bread alone,

540
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,200
but by every word of God.

541
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,000
He's resisting.

542
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,200
We find that in verse number 8

543
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,500
the Bible says this,

544
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,700
And Jesus answered and said unto him,

545
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,400
Get thee behind Me, Satan,

546
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,800
for it is written,

547
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,600
Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God,

548
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,300
and Him only shalt thou serve.

549
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,800
Again, He's referencing Old Testament

550
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,600
from the book of Deuteronomy.

551
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,100
He's using the Word of God.

552
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,400
And He's using it skillfully.

553
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,900
Why? Notice the temptation in verse number 7.

554
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,500
If thou therefore wilt worship Me,

555
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,900
all shall be thine.

556
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,400
If thou wilt worship Me.

557
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,200
And Jesus says it is written,

558
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,900
Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God,

559
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,800
and Him only shalt thou serve.

560
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,600
I'm thankful that obviously

561
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,200
the example that is given to us

562
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,500
is an example of using the Word of God skillfully.

563
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,800
The verse that is quoted

564
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,800
is directly relevant to the temptation

565
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,600
that is given.

566
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,700
It's not just some,

567
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,100
you know, Jesus wept.

568
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:14,000
I memorized John 11.35.

569
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,800
That's not going to help you

570
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,000
when the temptation comes.

571
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,500
I'm not suggesting that there aren't verses

572
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,600
that you ought to memorize,

573
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,100
that you memorize skillfully.

574
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:24,300
Notice, number 3,

575
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,400
in this process of resisting,

576
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,500
in verse number 12,

577
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,800
Jesus answering said unto him,

578
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,100
It is said.

579
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,200
He doesn't say it is written.

580
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,200
He says it is said.

581
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,500
It's the same idea.

582
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:39,500
Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.

583
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,200
Another reference from the book of Deuteronomy.

584
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,400
And so as we look at this battle plan

585
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,600
for victory that we find in James 4

586
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,500
and verse number 7

587
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,300
that we're seeking to make very practical

588
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,900
and applicable in our lives this evening,

589
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,700
and we look at that battle plan

590
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,600
and we break it up into these particular areas,

591
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,300
and then we look at the life of the Lord Jesus Christ.

592
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,500
He's our example.

593
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,400
He's the perfect example.

594
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,600
And we find this resisting

595
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,300
that is taking place in verses 2-12

596
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,100
where He's using the Word of God skillfully.

597
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,400
It is written.

598
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,700
It is written.

599
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,400
It is said.

600
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,900
When the enemy comes to you

601
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,500
and he begins to tempt you,

602
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:24,100
if you pull out some verses of Scripture,

603
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,700
what was the promise?

604
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,200
He will flee from you.

605
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,000
What happened in Luke 4?

606
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,400
We'll read verse number 13.

607
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,500
Remember we said it was a promise to claim?

608
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,900
Well, here in verse number 13,

609
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,300
the Bible says this,

610
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:38,200
And when the devil had ended all the temptation,

611
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,700
notice these words,

612
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:43,300
he departed from him.

613
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,500
I understand it says for a season.

614
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,000
And that also gives us insight

615
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,800
that we'll mention in just a moment.

616
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,700
But I want you to rejoice in that truth

617
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:54,500
where it says he departed from him.

618
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,100
Because the promise to claim in James 4-7,

619
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,000
Submit yourselves therefore to God,

620
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,200
resist the devil,

621
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,900
and he will flee from you.

622
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:08,200
You know that Satan, the devil,

623
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,000
he don't like messing with Christians

624
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,900
that are walking in the power of God

625
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:14,000
that know the Word of God.

626
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,400
He just doesn't.

627
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:22,500
He'd like to go have an easier opponent.

628
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,500
Someone that's walking in the flesh.

629
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,100
Someone that's carnal.

630
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:30,100
Someone that doesn't know the Word of God.

631
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,700
Much easier for him to have victory.

632
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:37,100
And so, when we take this model

633
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,400
that's been given to us

634
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,800
and we incorporate it,

635
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,100
we implement it in our lives,

636
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,900
we take the practical aspect

637
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,200
and apply the truth,

638
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,500
and we say daily,

639
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,800
I'm going to submit myself to God.

640
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,600
I understand his lordship

641
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,400
in every area of my life.

642
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,700
And I'm going to submit to his authority.

643
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,300
I'm going to follow his direction.

644
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,600
And as I do that,

645
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,600
I'm also going to resist the devil.

646
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,900
I'm going to put on the whole armor of God.

647
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,700
I'm not going to leave off certain pieces.

648
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,800
I'm not going to go out

649
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,400
and make myself vulnerable.

650
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,200
I'm going to put on all,

651
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,400
the whole armor of God.

652
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,500
I'm going to memorize the Word of God.

653
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,300
Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way?

654
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,500
By taking heed thereto according to thy word.

655
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,400
Thy word have I hid in mine heart

656
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,600
that I might not sin against thee.

657
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,400
Psalm 119 verses 9 and 11.

658
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,600
And we take this practical aspect

659
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,900
and we are resisting the enemy

660
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,500
and then we can claim the promise

661
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:33,600
that he will flee from you.

662
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,500
It's a wonderful truth of the Word of God.

663
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,800
At the end of verse number 13,

664
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,500
the Bible says,

665
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,300
for a season.

666
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,500
You understand this evening

667
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:46,600
that though you may have submitted to God today,

668
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,400
and though you may have resisted the devil today,

669
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,200
and though he may have fled from you today,

670
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:56,000
he may come back tomorrow.

671
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,400
Amen?

672
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,900
That's why it's a daily exercise.

673
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,400
This battle plan for victory

674
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,300
that we are daily engaged

675
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,800
in this spiritual warfare

676
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,700
and daily I have to submit

677
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,300
and daily I have to resist

678
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,000
and daily if I do those things,

679
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,200
he'll flee from me.

680
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,100
I don't know how long a season is

681
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:19,100
in my life, in your life.

682
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,400
But I know that the Bible says

683
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,600
that he departed from Him.

684
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,200
And that's precious.

685
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,700
We see the battle plan for victory

686
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,800
given to us in James 4

687
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,300
in verse number 7,

688
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,300
but we find here in Luke chapter number 4

689
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,700
how the Lord Jesus Christ

690
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,200
implemented perfectly

691
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,200
this plan that we've dealt with this evening.

692
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,900
I know that God would help us

693
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:43,700
as His people.

694
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,800
Listen, the Word of God is relevant.

695
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,300
The Word of God is practical.

696
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,400
We are to be doers of the Word.

697
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,300
And as we understand that we have an enemy

698
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,600
and we're engaged in this spiritual warfare,

699
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,500
I am rejoicing this evening

700
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:59,400
that God gives us a blueprint,

701
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,200
a battle plan for victory.

702
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,100
It's not something that's just kind of,

703
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:07,400
well, I think somehow if everything falls right,

704
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,800
you can have victory in your life.

705
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,700
No, no, no.

706
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:15,800
He's given us a process to follow.

707
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,000
I asked this question in recent days

708
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,300
to an individual.

709
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:22,000
How is it that we can make a decision

710
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,700
that would endure?

711
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,200
In other words, not to engage

712
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,300
in some type of sinful behavior.

713
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:32,100
A decision as the three Hebrew children

714
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,400
did in Daniel 3, not to bow.

715
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,900
How can we make a decision such as that

716
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:39,900
not to bow, not to sin?

717
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,000
It's when that decision is made

718
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,600
on the truth of the Word of God.

719
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,200
It is written.

720
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,100
See, God's Word doesn't change.

721
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,500
Aren't you thankful for that?

722
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:50,200
Can you imagine if God's Word changed?

723
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,900
Man, it'd be crazy.

724
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,200
But God's Word doesn't change.

725
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,600
It's a constant.

726
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,400
The society changes.

727
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,600
The culture changes.

728
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,600
What they say is right,

729
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,900
what they say is wrong changes.

730
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:01,900
But God's Word doesn't change.

731
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:07,680
word is steady, it's a constant. And as we hide the Word of God in our hearts and we

732
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:18,380
stand upon the principles of God's Word, God will enable us to have victory. Submit, resist,

733
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:25,020
and then claim that victory. The promise, He will flee from you. Let's pray. Father,

734
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:34,380
we love You. How we thank You for Your Word. And I pray this evening that You'd take this

735
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:47,060
simple message and help each one of us to apply it in our lives. We thank You for giving

736
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:57,300
us the truth, providing for us this blueprint or this battle plan for victory. We thank

737
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:05,140
You for the example of our Savior, as it's recorded in Luke 4. God, I pray that as we

738
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:15,360
engage in spiritual warfare, You'd help us to submit, help us to resist, and then help

739
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:23,720
us to rejoice as we see our enemy flee. Help us not to get prideful, help us not to get

740
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:36,400
overconfident, help us to continue daily submitting, lest we enter into that next conflict in the

741
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:43,560
power of our own flesh and fail miserably. Thank You for the opportunity to pray as a

742
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:48,080
church family. We pray that You'd bless our time, and we'll thank You for it. In Christ's

743
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,240
name we pray, amen. Anyone need a prayer?
