1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
Kings chapter number seven, and we'll be looking at verses three through ten, second

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:10,560
Kings seven verses three through ten, and we look at this passage of Scripture.

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:15,359
Of course, we've been studying the life of Elisha for a number of weeks now.

4
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:20,000
With studying the life of Elijah and Elisha, it's been a number of months, and so we've

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,139
thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity that God has given us to study his word and to study

6
00:00:25,139 --> 00:00:27,659
the lives of these great prophets.

7
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:34,479
You'll recall from last week, as we examined the prophecy of Elisha that opens up second

8
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:40,439
Kings chapter number seven, and we had dealt with the circumstances surrounding this prophecy.

9
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:44,479
If you look at the end of chapter number six, and you'll be mindful of the fact that the

10
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:50,520
Syrians had besieged Samaria, and they had been quite successful, and there was no food,

11
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,720
and they were in a desperate situation.

12
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:57,979
We find that they were hopeless and helpless, and they turned to cannibalism, and, I mean,

13
00:00:57,979 --> 00:01:03,459
it was just a terrible, terrible time in Samaria, and we find that the king determined that

14
00:01:03,459 --> 00:01:08,779
one of the things that they should do is kill Elisha, and I know that makes no sense, but

15
00:01:08,779 --> 00:01:13,940
that's what the king decided that they would do, and, of course, as the sixth chapter of

16
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:19,099
second Kings concludes, we begin to see that interaction that takes place, and Elisha stands

17
00:01:19,099 --> 00:01:24,400
up with great courage and confidence, and he declares this wonderful prophecy.

18
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,819
We called it a prophecy of provision.

19
00:01:27,819 --> 00:01:33,519
He said, hear ye the word of the Lord, and as we studied the first two verses of chapter

20
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:40,559
number seven, we made the point that we don't need to focus on the how as much as we need

21
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:46,300
to focus on the who, and you remember there was that one servant, a lord on whose hand

22
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:52,000
the king leaned, that said to the man of God, that said to Elisha, behold, if the Lord

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,720
would make windows in heaven, might this thing be?

24
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:00,040
He was trying to figure out how this could happen, and all Elisha knew was this is what

25
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:07,599
God said would happen, and therefore, we need to focus on the who, not so much the how.

26
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:12,399
In our lives, sometimes we get so caught up in how this is going to happen and how that's

27
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:16,300
going to happen and how God's going to do what God said He was going to do.

28
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:23,259
He's God, and He is perfectly able to carry out all that He said He would do, and we trust

29
00:02:23,259 --> 00:02:24,580
Him in that.

30
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:30,059
We concluded the prophecy of provision, and as we move forward into the text of Scripture,

31
00:02:30,059 --> 00:02:35,660
we begin this evening and look at verses three through ten, and we see that the text gives

32
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:40,820
us the account of these four leprous men.

33
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:42,720
The Bible says in verse number three,

34
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:48,619
And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate, and they said one to another,

35
00:02:48,619 --> 00:02:52,000
Why sit we here until we die?

36
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,720
If we say we will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and we shall die

37
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,720
there.

38
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,679
And if we sit still here, we die also.

39
00:03:01,679 --> 00:03:06,419
Now therefore come, and let us fall unto the host of the Syrians.

40
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:14,000
If they save us alive, we shall live, and if they kill us, we shall but die.

41
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,880
This evening as we study this passage of Scripture, I've simply entitled the message from verse

42
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,820
number three there, four leprous men.

43
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:22,820
Four leprous men.

44
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:26,440
I want you to consider a few things as we look at the passage this evening.

45
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,539
Consider first of all their discussion.

46
00:03:28,539 --> 00:03:33,360
In verse number three and four, I read those verses by way of introduction this evening,

47
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,419
and we find that God gives us a record of the discussion that these four men have.

48
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:43,020
Notice it says at the end of verse number three, they said one to another.

49
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:46,500
They begin to have this discussion, and they begin to look at their circumstances.

50
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,339
They understand all that is taking place, and we're aware of the fact as we read the

51
00:03:51,339 --> 00:03:59,399
sixth chapter of 2 Kings that the people within the city were suffering greatly.

52
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:06,139
These four leprous men, because of the fact that they had leprosy, their circumstances

53
00:04:06,139 --> 00:04:10,699
were even more grave than the circumstances of the people within the city.

54
00:04:10,699 --> 00:04:13,139
So we find that they begin to have this discussion.

55
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:14,940
Notice what they say.

56
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,359
What a great question at the end of verse number three.

57
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:18,359
They look at each other.

58
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:23,399
They say one to another, why sit we here until we die?

59
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:27,579
Basically they understood that because of their condition and because of the circumstances,

60
00:04:27,579 --> 00:04:32,179
that if they continued to do what they had been doing, that they were simply waiting

61
00:04:32,179 --> 00:04:33,700
to die.

62
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,899
There was no other possibility.

63
00:04:35,899 --> 00:04:40,059
There was no chance, little chance of survival, and they understood that they were going to

64
00:04:40,059 --> 00:04:42,339
sit there until they die.

65
00:04:42,339 --> 00:04:46,980
And so they have this conversation, this discussion amongst themselves, and notice what it says

66
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,459
in verse number four.

67
00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:54,540
If we say we will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and we shall die

68
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,540
there.

69
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:59,980
So they review their options, if you will, during this conversation, this discussion,

70
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:03,100
and we consider the discussion that they're having, and we find that they say, okay, if

71
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,059
we sit here, we're going to die.

72
00:05:05,059 --> 00:05:09,579
If we go into the city, we know that the city is having this great famine.

73
00:05:09,579 --> 00:05:14,019
We're aware of the circumstances, and so if we enter into the city, well, we're going

74
00:05:14,019 --> 00:05:15,779
to die there.

75
00:05:15,779 --> 00:05:18,940
So they continue as they reason and have this discussion.

76
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:22,299
They say if we sit still here, we die also.

77
00:05:22,299 --> 00:05:26,420
They'd already kind of understood that at the end of verse number three, and they repeat

78
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,420
that as an option.

79
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,579
Well, we can go back to the city, we're going to die.

80
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:32,100
We can stay here, we're going to die.

81
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:38,540
You continue reading in verse number four, and now therefore come and let us fall under

82
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:41,220
the host of the Syrians.

83
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,779
So now this is a different option.

84
00:05:43,779 --> 00:05:45,579
Go back to Samaria, die.

85
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:47,380
Stay here, die.

86
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,179
The Syrians are out there.

87
00:05:49,179 --> 00:05:51,140
They're the enemy.

88
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:54,179
They're the ones that have laid siege against the city.

89
00:05:54,179 --> 00:05:59,660
They're the reason that the city is in the condition that they're in.

90
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:04,779
They have been very successful from a military perspective, but notice what they say.

91
00:06:04,779 --> 00:06:07,260
Let us fall under the host of the Syrians.

92
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:14,779
If they save us alive, we shall live, and if they kill us, we shall but die.

93
00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:16,500
So consider this third option.

94
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:21,260
They say, as they have this discussion, we read it in verses three and four.

95
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,380
We understand that they outline the options.

96
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,339
They say, well, there's this third option.

97
00:06:25,339 --> 00:06:26,339
We can go to the Syrians.

98
00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:31,700
And it is possible that if we go to the Syrians, that they would save us alive, and therefore

99
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,420
we should live.

100
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:38,559
And if they kill us, well, that was the same option of going to Samaria and the same option

101
00:06:38,559 --> 00:06:45,220
of staying here, and so we should just go to the Syrians because that was the only potential

102
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:47,600
of survival.

103
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,500
So they have this discussion, and we see their logic.

104
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,500
We see their reason.

105
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:56,459
We see how they reason through the process, and as we consider their discussion, we then

106
00:06:56,459 --> 00:06:57,739
consider their decision.

107
00:06:57,739 --> 00:06:58,779
They made the decision.

108
00:06:58,779 --> 00:07:02,660
They said, let us go, and the Bible tells us in verse number five, number two if you're

109
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,980
taking notes this evening, consider their decision.

110
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:13,799
It says this, and they rose up in the twilight to go unto the camp of the Syrians.

111
00:07:13,799 --> 00:07:21,440
They were taking a certain risk, but they had gone through the risk assessment, if you

112
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,440
will.

113
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:26,359
They had gone through the entire process, and they had concluded that it was best for

114
00:07:26,359 --> 00:07:32,440
them to make the decision to fall unto the Syrians, and the Bible tells us that they

115
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:36,359
went to the camp of the Syrians, and it says when they were come to the uttermost part

116
00:07:36,359 --> 00:07:39,359
of the camp of Syria, behold, there was no man there.

117
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:45,160
So we find that they made the decision to go to the camp of the Syrians.

118
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,920
The reality this evening is that we all make decisions.

119
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,559
Sometimes we make decisions the way that these guys made decisions.

120
00:07:51,559 --> 00:07:55,880
We just kind of had a logic reason through it, write down all of the options, and if

121
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,920
I do this, well, then this is going to happen, and we kind of go through that process.

122
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:05,679
There are other times, and we use other means of going through the decision-making process,

123
00:08:05,679 --> 00:08:08,679
but we make decisions all the time.

124
00:08:08,679 --> 00:08:14,239
The fact of the matter is that decisions have consequences, and we find that the prophet

125
00:08:14,239 --> 00:08:19,920
of old said that they're in the valley of decision, and oh, we have decisions to make,

126
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,160
and every single day, we have decisions that we make.

127
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:28,519
Now, I will give you the reality is that some decisions are more weighty than other decisions.

128
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:32,559
I mean, there are some decisions that are just, you know, you don't think too much about

129
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,760
those decisions.

130
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,080
There are some things that we do in life that we already made the decision.

131
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,919
The die, if you will, the lot has already been cast, if you will, and we've made a decision

132
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:47,380
at some point in the past, and it's just a matter of following through with the decision,

133
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:51,479
but there are decisions that we face, and as we would look at the decision that they

134
00:08:51,479 --> 00:08:55,520
made, they said, we're going to go into the camp of the Syrians.

135
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:59,239
Now, we understand that there are going to be consequences for that decision.

136
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:01,700
Now, we look at the passage of Scripture.

137
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,119
Some of us are familiar with it.

138
00:09:03,119 --> 00:09:04,119
You've read ahead.

139
00:09:04,119 --> 00:09:05,119
You understand.

140
00:09:05,119 --> 00:09:07,880
You know what's going on, and you find that, man, those were great consequences.

141
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,200
I mean, they made the right decision.

142
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,960
You know, it's easy to say that somebody made the right decision afterwards, but when you're

143
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:20,039
the one making the decision, when you're in that process, and you understand the need

144
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:25,599
for wisdom and the need for godly counsel, and we understand that these men, these four,

145
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:31,119
they just spoke amongst themselves and had that discussion, but they made that decision,

146
00:09:31,119 --> 00:09:36,200
and as we consider their discussion and their decision, we then notice, number three, their

147
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,520
discovery.

148
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,159
We notice their discovery.

149
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:43,559
It's interesting that in verses six and seven, the Bible, the text of Scripture that is before

150
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:48,840
us, gives us insight as to what God did and how God worked.

151
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:55,039
Remember, the prophecy of Elisha was, hear ye the word of the Lord, thus saith the Lord,

152
00:09:55,039 --> 00:10:00,039
tomorrow, about this time, shall a measure of fine flour be sold.

153
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:04,219
for a shekel and two measures of barley for a shekel in the gate of Samaria."

154
00:10:04,219 --> 00:10:05,679
It was a specific prophecy.

155
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:08,539
We dealt with that, the content of the prophecy.

156
00:10:08,539 --> 00:10:14,559
We mentioned that last week and looked at the level of detail that was given and how

157
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:18,719
Elisha was very specific with regard to what was going to happen, when it was going to

158
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:21,399
happen, where it was going to happen.

159
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:23,439
And the question is, how is it going to happen?

160
00:10:23,439 --> 00:10:25,999
Well, God shows us what he does.

161
00:10:25,999 --> 00:10:30,199
And we don't always know how God is going to work, but we know that God is going to

162
00:10:30,199 --> 00:10:32,799
work and we can trust him to work.

163
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:35,919
We find in verses 6 and 7, the Bible says this,

164
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:44,519
For the Lord had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of

165
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:48,679
horses, even the noise of a great host.

166
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:51,639
So God made them hear something.

167
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:56,419
And he made them hear something that was a familiar sound, if you will.

168
00:10:56,419 --> 00:11:01,639
It was a sound that as they would reason together, they would conclude what they believed that

169
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:02,719
it was.

170
00:11:02,719 --> 00:11:08,579
It says that he made them hear a noise of chariots, a noise of horses, even the noise

171
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:12,199
of a great host.

172
00:11:12,199 --> 00:11:14,959
The Syrians said one to another,

173
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:24,079
Lo, the king of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites and the kings

174
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:28,279
of the Egyptians to come upon us.

175
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:32,459
These Syrians who had been so successful at laying siege against the city of Samaria,

176
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:34,319
they heard this noise.

177
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:35,759
God caused them.

178
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:38,199
God made them hear this noise.

179
00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:43,799
And they said, surely the king of Israel has hired the Hittites and the Egyptians.

180
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:51,279
And now these forces are coming upon us and against us, and therefore the Bible tells

181
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:58,559
us in verse number 7, wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents

182
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:04,159
and their horses and their asses, even the camp as it was, and fled for their life.

183
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:08,719
Now if you have a hard time understanding verse number 7, join the crowd.

184
00:12:08,719 --> 00:12:14,079
Because I would like to think if I was fleeing an approaching army, I'd get on my horse and

185
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:15,599
try to get away.

186
00:12:15,599 --> 00:12:17,159
But they left everything.

187
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:18,159
Why?

188
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:20,039
Because God was working.

189
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:24,879
You know that you find in the text of Scripture, not only here in 2 Kings, but various portions

190
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:28,119
of Scripture, how God caused the people to be confused.

191
00:12:28,119 --> 00:12:33,599
The very enemies of God with Gideon and the Midianites, you know that Gideon and his small

192
00:12:33,599 --> 00:12:37,799
army didn't kill them all, they turned their swords against each other.

193
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:40,039
God gives confusion.

194
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:46,759
We find that these individuals, this great host, the Syrians, they hear this sound and

195
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:52,439
they conclude that it's the Hittites and the Egyptians, and therefore they arose and they

196
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:53,759
fled.

197
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:59,439
They left their tents, their horses, their asses, the camp even as it was, and they fled

198
00:12:59,439 --> 00:13:00,439
for their life.

199
00:13:00,439 --> 00:13:03,679
So we come back to these four leprous men.

200
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:08,359
Isn't it interesting that as these four leprous men are having this discussion that God's

201
00:13:08,359 --> 00:13:09,359
working?

202
00:13:09,359 --> 00:13:11,999
God's always at work.

203
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:16,039
And these four leprous men are having their discussion, they're coming, they're reaching

204
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:20,799
their decision, and God has already been at work.

205
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:27,239
God has already had the Syrians hearing this great noise, and He's already given the prophecy

206
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:28,399
through Elisha.

207
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,879
Remember, He said tomorrow about this time.

208
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:39,639
God was working, and these Syrians, these great warriors, fled for their life.

209
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:42,239
We notice what they discovered.

210
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:45,879
The Bible tells us that they found that the camp of the Syrians was empty.

211
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:51,519
At the end of verse number 5, it says there was no man there.

212
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,599
Notice in verse number 8 as we find that they came to the camp of the Syrians and it was

213
00:13:55,599 --> 00:13:59,519
empty, it says, and when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp, they went

214
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,799
into one tent and did eat and drink and carried then silver and gold and raiment and went

215
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:07,999
and hid it, and came again and entered into another tent and carried then also and went

216
00:14:07,999 --> 00:14:08,999
and hid it.

217
00:14:08,999 --> 00:14:13,159
I mean, tent after tent, just nobody there.

218
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:14,159
Totally empty.

219
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:15,159
What did they discover?

220
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:16,839
Well, they found great spoil.

221
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:18,799
They found provision.

222
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:28,439
The Bible tells us in verse number 8 that they found sustenance, they did eat and drink.

223
00:14:28,439 --> 00:14:33,519
Now remember, the prophecy of Elisha was that tomorrow about this time a measure of

224
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,279
fine flour would be sold for a shekel, two measures of barley for a shekel in the gate

225
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:44,079
of Samaria, but yet we find prior to that, the siege had had such an impact on the food

226
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:50,039
industry, if I could call it that, there in Samaria during that time, that the Bible tells

227
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:55,399
us in verse number 25 of chapter 6 that an ass's head was sold for four score pieces

228
00:14:55,399 --> 00:15:02,759
of silver, 80 pieces of silver for the head of an unclean animal.

229
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:09,299
Then he says that a shekel would get you a measure of fine flour and two measures of

230
00:15:09,299 --> 00:15:10,299
barley.

231
00:15:10,299 --> 00:15:12,979
One shekel, one shekel.

232
00:15:12,979 --> 00:15:18,479
So for two shekels, you get actually something that would be worth eating, and it's just

233
00:15:18,479 --> 00:15:20,159
beyond their comprehension.

234
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:24,119
But now we find that in verse number 8, when these lepers come to the camp of the Syrians,

235
00:15:24,119 --> 00:15:28,879
they're finding tent after tent, they eat and drink, there's sustenance, there's food

236
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:29,879
available.

237
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:30,879
The Bible says they carried tents.

238
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:33,999
Notice they had silver and gold and raiment.

239
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:37,479
I mean, they had great spoil.

240
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:40,399
And it says that they went and hid it.

241
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,719
They came again and entered into another tent and carried tents also and went and hid it.

242
00:15:44,719 --> 00:15:48,999
Now I want to just get in the minds of these four guys just for a moment here in verse

243
00:15:48,999 --> 00:15:51,639
number 8 as they're going through this process.

244
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:56,639
I mean, I believe that they're absolutely astounded as to what they're finding.

245
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:02,919
Remember, in their logic, in their process of mitigating the risk and determining in

246
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:06,839
their risk assessment, should we go back to Samaria, should we stay here, or should we

247
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:12,119
go to the Syrians, they completely had the idea and the understanding that they would

248
00:16:12,119 --> 00:16:15,599
go to the Syrians and they would fall into the Syrians and then the Syrians, they would

249
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:18,759
actually see them and they would actually make a decision on whether they're going to

250
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:21,019
let them live or they're going to kill them.

251
00:16:21,019 --> 00:16:24,699
They didn't expect to get to the camp of the Syrians and have nobody there.

252
00:16:24,699 --> 00:16:28,659
And yet they arrive and there's no one.

253
00:16:28,659 --> 00:16:29,659
They're eating.

254
00:16:29,659 --> 00:16:31,059
I mean, can you imagine?

255
00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:35,419
I know that it's a dangerous thing, especially after you've fasted for a period of time or

256
00:16:35,419 --> 00:16:39,059
you've been in a situation where you've not been able to eat for a while and your mind

257
00:16:39,059 --> 00:16:43,119
thinks, I'm going to eat as much as I can, it's really hard on your body, it's a difficulty.

258
00:16:43,119 --> 00:16:47,539
But we find that they probably were just so overwhelmed with all of the things in the

259
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:50,659
Bible so that they go and they start hiding things.

260
00:16:50,659 --> 00:16:56,059
And it's interesting for they come to this conclusion as we read what's happening and

261
00:16:56,059 --> 00:17:00,979
we find that they're going in these tents and they're finding this substance and this

262
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:01,979
great spoil.

263
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:05,899
But then notice there's another discussion they have amongst themselves and they say

264
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:09,859
this in verse number nine, then they said one to another, notice these four words in

265
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:14,259
verse number nine, we do not well.

266
00:17:14,259 --> 00:17:16,579
We do not well.

267
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:19,779
Why did they conclude that they do not well?

268
00:17:19,899 --> 00:17:23,819
No, it says this, this day is a day of good tidings.

269
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:30,179
Notice this next phrase, and we hold our peace.

270
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:37,019
In other words, they come to, they reach the conclusion that they have found great spoil,

271
00:17:37,019 --> 00:17:42,499
they have found provision, they knew that the people of Samaria were starving.

272
00:17:42,499 --> 00:17:48,219
They knew that the seeds that had been laid against Samaria by the Syrians had had a great

273
00:17:48,339 --> 00:17:55,899
toll on the inhabitants of Samaria, and they understood that they now are in a place where

274
00:17:55,899 --> 00:18:02,419
they have good tidings that this is a wonderful day, there is substance available, the goods

275
00:18:02,419 --> 00:18:06,659
are here, and yet we hold our peace.

276
00:18:06,659 --> 00:18:12,819
They say this, if we tarry till the morning light, some mischief will come upon us.

277
00:18:12,819 --> 00:18:19,619
Now therefore come, that we may go and tell the king's household.

278
00:18:19,619 --> 00:18:25,019
They make this great discovery, and we notice the discovery that they make and how that

279
00:18:25,019 --> 00:18:30,979
they're taken care of as far as their needs are concerned, and these leprous men as they're

280
00:18:30,979 --> 00:18:36,419
there, and of course understanding some aspects of leprosy and understanding the nature of

281
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:40,859
that during this particular time, they now come to that place and they say we do not

282
00:18:40,859 --> 00:18:42,339
well.

283
00:18:42,339 --> 00:18:48,219
Today, this day, is a day of good tidings and we hold our peace, and I wonder as we

284
00:18:48,219 --> 00:18:52,940
look at the truth of verse number nine, and I understand contextually what these four

285
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:59,179
leprous men are saying, but I wonder this evening by way of application how often have

286
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:05,299
we come to the place in our lives where we might say we do not well.

287
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:10,899
We know that we're living in the midst of a time, and I'm not speaking about just today

288
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:15,219
being in the midst of a global pandemic, but I'm speaking about living in the midst of

289
00:19:15,219 --> 00:19:17,859
a lost and dying world.

290
00:19:17,859 --> 00:19:21,899
I'm speaking today about the fact that, you know, so many people are speaking about the

291
00:19:21,899 --> 00:19:28,719
fact that this number of people have died from coronavirus, and I understand the gravity

292
00:19:28,719 --> 00:19:36,559
of that situation, and I in no way, shape, or form do I seek to pretend that that's not

293
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:37,719
something that has happened.

294
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:38,719
It is.

295
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:42,000
People are dying, and it's a sad thing.

296
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,639
Death is sad, but death is a reality.

297
00:19:45,639 --> 00:19:48,619
As God's people, I had a conversation with someone just this week.

298
00:19:48,619 --> 00:19:52,639
As the people of God, I've asked countless people, I don't even know how many people

299
00:19:52,639 --> 00:19:58,079
I've asked in my life, in my time of being a believer, of saying something to somebody

300
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,079
like this.

301
00:19:59,079 --> 00:20:00,079
If you were to die today, are you...

302
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:04,479
100% sure you'd go to heaven. Why would I ask somebody that question? Because I

303
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:08,119
understand the reality of death. I understand the Bible says, as of the

304
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:12,359
point of unto man wants to die, but after this the judgment. I understand the

305
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:17,039
Bible says the wages of sin is death. I understand that. If you've come to our

306
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:21,799
church for any period of time, you understand that as well. And the reality

307
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:30,439
is that, again, I do not mean to lack sensitivity or to have some level of

308
00:20:30,439 --> 00:20:36,959
being callous towards the deaths of those from this COVID-19. It's a reality.

309
00:20:36,959 --> 00:20:42,519
But you understand that since January 1st of this year, if we were to take

310
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:46,639
basically the same time frame of what we've been dealing with, I know that it

311
00:20:46,639 --> 00:20:50,279
didn't start here in America at that time, at least by what they're telling us,

312
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:58,919
but if you just look at 2020, nearly 23 million people worldwide have died. 23

313
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:03,879
million people worldwide. Not from coronavirus, but just because of death.

314
00:21:03,879 --> 00:21:08,999
And you say, oh you're not being sensitive. I promise you I'm not trying

315
00:21:08,999 --> 00:21:15,199
to lack sensitivity. I'm simply speaking a truth that's a biblical truth. You

316
00:21:15,199 --> 00:21:21,279
understand what Solomon said? There's a time to be born, there's a time to die. In

317
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:28,079
fact, it's interesting and it's something that, you know, maybe sometimes we

318
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:33,319
shy away from this truth, but we know that it's a biblical truth and we find

319
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:37,959
that Solomon says this in Ecclesiastes 7 and verse number 2, it is better to go

320
00:21:37,959 --> 00:21:43,879
to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting, for that is the

321
00:21:43,879 --> 00:21:49,999
end of all men, and the living will lay it to his heart. Ecclesiastes 7 and verse

322
00:21:49,999 --> 00:21:56,359
number 2. See, the reality this evening is that if I don't die from coronavirus,

323
00:21:56,359 --> 00:22:04,359
I'm gonna die from something, right? So are you. It's the way it is. And as I look

324
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:08,839
to make application from this verse of Scripture in my life, if I

325
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:13,079
understand that, and we would often say even as I've shared the gospel with

326
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:17,959
people, countless people during my life as a believer, I've said to them, as is

327
00:22:17,959 --> 00:22:20,919
appointed unto man who wants to die, I've said to them, the wages of sin is death.

328
00:22:20,919 --> 00:22:27,079
And I've said something like this, that's the bad news, but can I tell you the good

329
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:32,079
news? What do they say? This day is a day of good tidings. What's the good news?

330
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:39,719
Jesus died for you. He conquered sin, death, and the grave. He died in your

331
00:22:39,719 --> 00:22:44,879
place. God made Him to be sin for us who knew no sin, that we might be made the

332
00:22:44,879 --> 00:22:51,199
righteousness of God in Him. We find that He is victorious, that He rose in victory

333
00:22:51,199 --> 00:22:56,199
on day three, and He's delivered us from the power of death. He's delivered us

334
00:22:56,199 --> 00:23:01,279
from the fear of death. Some might look at me, perhaps, or someone might look at

335
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:06,479
you as a believer and say, you just don't seem to have the understanding of all

336
00:23:06,479 --> 00:23:10,839
that's taking place, and you don't see the gravity of the situation. No, simply, I

337
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:15,159
don't have a fear of death. The Bible tells us in Hebrews 2 and verse number

338
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:19,359
15, and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to

339
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:24,639
bondage. I am thankful this evening to say I don't have that bondage. I don't

340
00:23:24,639 --> 00:23:28,919
have a fear of death. Now don't misunderstand me, I'm not hoping to die

341
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:33,839
this evening, but if I were, I'd be with my Savior. I said to my kids last week

342
00:23:33,959 --> 00:23:38,439
when we got the news that Mary Fenley had gone home to be with the Lord, I was

343
00:23:38,439 --> 00:23:43,519
reminded of a wonderful account and testimony of that great preacher of

344
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:48,999
yesteryear, D.L. Moody, and he said this, he said, one day you're going to read in the

345
00:23:48,999 --> 00:23:54,239
papers that D.L. Moody's dead. He said, you don't believe it, don't believe it for

346
00:23:54,239 --> 00:24:00,199
one second, because on that day D.L. Moody is more alive than he's ever been in his

347
00:24:00,199 --> 00:24:05,479
life. Praise the Lord. I said to my kids, Mary's left this earth, but man, she's

348
00:24:05,479 --> 00:24:11,159
more alive than she's ever been. She's got eternal life. She's transformed,

349
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:16,679
right? This mortal shall put on immortality, 1 Corinthians 15. I mean, do

350
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:20,679
we believe the book or not? Amen? To be asked of the body is to be present with the

351
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:24,559
Lord. What did Paul say? He said, I'm in a strait betwixt two, having desire to part

352
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:29,999
to be with him which is far better, Philippians 1. See, the reality this

353
00:24:29,999 --> 00:24:34,519
evening is that we look at all of these things are going on in our world today, I

354
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:39,399
really believe that what's happening is there's a greater awareness by a greater

355
00:24:39,399 --> 00:24:46,119
percentage of our population that death is a reality. And just a few months ago

356
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:52,719
they lived as if they were immortal. They had no thought of death or dying. I believe

357
00:24:52,719 --> 00:24:57,959
it gives us a unique opportunity. There are unique challenges because it's

358
00:24:57,959 --> 00:25:02,279
difficult talking to people because they're so like, stay away from me. But

359
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:09,599
the reality is that this thing that these men had discovered, that they

360
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:16,359
concluded we do not well because we hold our peace, the reality that we know the

361
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:22,239
truth of eternity and the power of the gospel, if we refrain from telling others

362
00:25:22,239 --> 00:25:27,919
we ought to come to the same conclusion that these men came to. We do not well.

363
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:33,399
It is our jobs, our mission, our responsibility to preach the gospel to

364
00:25:33,399 --> 00:25:39,399
every creature. I know contextually, again, if you want to call me or text me or

365
00:25:39,399 --> 00:25:44,559
email me about the context, I know what the context is. It's about the Syrians

366
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:49,239
and the Sumerians and the good and the spoil. We make application from God's

367
00:25:49,239 --> 00:25:54,479
Word, and I believe this evening that there's good application for us. What was

368
00:25:54,479 --> 00:26:01,639
the remedy? What was their conclusion? They didn't just say we do not well, but

369
00:26:01,639 --> 00:26:06,919
man, that tent has more food and more gold, let's go get some more. No, no. They

370
00:26:06,919 --> 00:26:13,079
recognized we do not well and therefore they changed their approach. Number four,

371
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:18,039
if you're taking notes, notice their declaration. In verse number 10 the Bible

372
00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:24,239
says this, so they came and called unto the porter of the city. So they

373
00:26:24,239 --> 00:26:28,399
were there and they were in a place where they said if we stay here we're

374
00:26:28,399 --> 00:26:32,399
gonna die, if we go to Sumeria we're gonna die, if we go to the Syrians we

375
00:26:32,399 --> 00:26:36,079
might die but they might keep us alive and so therefore let us go to the

376
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:39,959
Syrians and they go and they find that there's no one there and they find food

377
00:26:39,959 --> 00:26:44,079
and they find drink and they find raiment and they find gold and silver

378
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:47,999
and they say we do not well so they make this decision they turn back and

379
00:26:47,999 --> 00:26:54,119
they make a declaration they return to the city to deliver the glad tidings the

380
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:57,599
Bible says so they came and called to the port of their city and they told

381
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:02,959
them saying we came to the camp of the Syrians and behold there was no man

382
00:27:02,959 --> 00:27:08,199
there neither voice of man but horses tied and asses tied and the tents as

383
00:27:08,199 --> 00:27:14,359
they were I just wonder if the porter said can you repeat that you found what

384
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:19,799
are you sure the king by the way didn't believe it the king is told about what

385
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:24,439
happens in verse 11 and 12 the Bible says that the the porters he called the

386
00:27:24,439 --> 00:27:29,079
porters and they told it to the king's house and he said they've set a trap for

387
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:33,239
us they know that we're hungry and they've just set a trap and we'll deal

388
00:27:33,239 --> 00:27:37,399
with this text next Wednesday evening but I want you to understand their

389
00:27:37,399 --> 00:27:41,359
declaration notice their declaration they come I believe that they come with

390
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:47,159
great joy I believe that they come with with a level of excitement as they call

391
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:52,599
for the porters and or the porter of the city and they begin to declare to them

392
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:58,639
what they found what they saw what they experienced and I wonder this evening

393
00:27:58,639 --> 00:28:04,319
when we're telling others about the glad tidings about the gospel do they see a

394
00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:12,039
level of joy and excitement in our lives do they see a a transformed life do they

395
00:28:12,039 --> 00:28:17,079
see that that God's really made a difference in my life that that this

396
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:25,679
thing is real the power of a transformed life see they experience something and

397
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:31,199
because of their experience because of what they had found there in the camp

398
00:28:31,199 --> 00:28:37,559
of the Syrians I believe that this joy was obvious in their demeanor in their

399
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:42,159
speech and their approach and all that they said and I believe that that's why

400
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:47,399
the porter called to the king because he believed them he believed that he's

401
00:28:47,399 --> 00:28:51,559
telling the truth this wasn't a setup the Syrians had not got these four

402
00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:56,039
leprous men and called them and devised this plan I believe that there was a

403
00:28:56,039 --> 00:29:02,559
level of of belief by this on the part of the porter as he received this

404
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:10,359
message as we look at 2nd Kings 7 we see it begins with a prophecy of provision

405
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:15,599
we find that there's these four leprous men it's exciting to see how God is

406
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:21,599
working what God is doing how God worked what God did and we find that God is

407
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:26,319
always at work we find that these four leprous men not only were their lives

408
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:32,319
spared but they were able to bring glad tidings back to the city they were able

409
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:37,039
to tell the city the inhabitants of the city the people that were in despair the

410
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:40,599
people that were desperate that had turned to cannibalism they're able to go

411
00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:46,959
and deliver a message of hope they were hopeless and helpless the Bible speaks

412
00:29:46,959 --> 00:29:53,319
about the hope that we have as believers it's not a hope so kind of a I wish I

413
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:57,639
hope it happens kind of a the way the world would use the word but it's a it's

414
00:29:57,639 --> 00:30:01,759
an expectation based upon a revealed truth

415
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:07,479
Understand that God's told us this, he's given us his word, and he is to be trusted.

416
00:30:07,479 --> 00:30:14,079
This evening, four leprous men, we see their discussion, their decision, we then notice

417
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:19,839
their discovery, what a discovery it was, and then we notice their declaration.

418
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:23,039
They return to the city with glad tidings.

419
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:29,159
This evening, oh that God would help us to declare to those that he would allow us to

420
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:32,759
have contact with, the glad tidings.

421
00:30:32,759 --> 00:30:36,759
We sing the song, Jesus saves, Jesus saves.

422
00:30:36,759 --> 00:30:43,239
What a wonderful song it is, and oh it's precious to sing the song within the walls of this

423
00:30:43,239 --> 00:30:49,479
building that God has given us, but you know the world needs to know that Jesus saves.

424
00:30:49,479 --> 00:30:55,359
He is the only hope for America or for any other country around this world, Jesus is

425
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:56,359
the answer.

426
00:30:56,359 --> 00:30:59,879
Father, we love you this evening, we thank you for loving us.

427
00:30:59,879 --> 00:31:04,839
Lord, as we look at these four leprous men and we see contextually the account that takes

428
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:12,279
place and we understand the circumstances surrounding the battle between the Syrians

429
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:18,519
and the people of Israel, and we understand that the Syrians had besieged Samaria, and

430
00:31:18,519 --> 00:31:23,159
they had been quite successful, the people were starving and hungry, and then we begin

431
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:29,119
to read about these four leprous men, and while they were entertaining this idea of

432
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:35,999
going to the Syrians, you were at work, you allowed those great warriors to hear noise

433
00:31:35,999 --> 00:31:40,439
and to flee, and everything was left in the camp.

434
00:31:40,439 --> 00:31:50,119
God, we notice how they respond and understand that we do not well.

435
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:58,839
Lord, this evening I pray that we would have a measure of that spirit this evening.

436
00:31:58,839 --> 00:32:04,519
Lord, that you'd help us to understand that you've been so good to us.

437
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:13,239
If our gospel be hid, Paul said it is hid to them that are lost, 2 Corinthians 4.

438
00:32:13,239 --> 00:32:17,239
We sing the song with the little kids, this little light of mine, I'm going to let it

439
00:32:17,239 --> 00:32:21,519
shine, let it shine, let it shine, let it shine.

440
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:28,559
I wonder if the little kids see us letting our light shine, not just singing about it,

441
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:30,799
but actually doing it.

442
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:38,559
God help us, help us to deliver glad tidings.

443
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:42,999
Jesus saves, Jesus saves.

444
00:32:42,999 --> 00:32:44,759
We pray that you would bless our time of prayer.

445
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:47,219
We thank you for the privilege of prayer.

446
00:32:47,219 --> 00:32:49,739
We pray that you'd be honored and glorified through all we say and do.

447
00:32:49,739 --> 00:32:52,299
For it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
