WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400
Kings chapter number seven, and we'll be looking at verses three through ten, second

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:10.560
Kings seven verses three through ten, and we look at this passage of Scripture.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.359
Of course, we've been studying the life of Elisha for a number of weeks now.

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:20.000
With studying the life of Elijah and Elisha, it's been a number of months, and so we've

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.139
thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity that God has given us to study his word and to study

00:00:25.139 --> 00:00:27.659
the lives of these great prophets.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:34.479
You'll recall from last week, as we examined the prophecy of Elisha that opens up second

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:40.439
Kings chapter number seven, and we had dealt with the circumstances surrounding this prophecy.

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:44.479
If you look at the end of chapter number six, and you'll be mindful of the fact that the

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:50.520
Syrians had besieged Samaria, and they had been quite successful, and there was no food,

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.720
and they were in a desperate situation.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.979
We find that they were hopeless and helpless, and they turned to cannibalism, and, I mean,

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:03.459
it was just a terrible, terrible time in Samaria, and we find that the king determined that

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:08.779
one of the things that they should do is kill Elisha, and I know that makes no sense, but

00:01:08.779 --> 00:01:13.940
that's what the king decided that they would do, and, of course, as the sixth chapter of

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:19.099
second Kings concludes, we begin to see that interaction that takes place, and Elisha stands

00:01:19.099 --> 00:01:24.400
up with great courage and confidence, and he declares this wonderful prophecy.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.819
We called it a prophecy of provision.

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:33.519
He said, hear ye the word of the Lord, and as we studied the first two verses of chapter

00:01:33.519 --> 00:01:40.559
number seven, we made the point that we don't need to focus on the how as much as we need

00:01:40.559 --> 00:01:46.300
to focus on the who, and you remember there was that one servant, a lord on whose hand

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:52.000
the king leaned, that said to the man of God, that said to Elisha, behold, if the Lord

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.720
would make windows in heaven, might this thing be?

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.040
He was trying to figure out how this could happen, and all Elisha knew was this is what

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:07.599
God said would happen, and therefore, we need to focus on the who, not so much the how.

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:12.399
In our lives, sometimes we get so caught up in how this is going to happen and how that's

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:16.300
going to happen and how God's going to do what God said He was going to do.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:23.259
He's God, and He is perfectly able to carry out all that He said He would do, and we trust

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:24.580
Him in that.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.059
We concluded the prophecy of provision, and as we move forward into the text of Scripture,

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:35.660
we begin this evening and look at verses three through ten, and we see that the text gives

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.820
us the account of these four leprous men.

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:42.720
The Bible says in verse number three,

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.619
And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate, and they said one to another,

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:52.000
Why sit we here until we die?

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.720
If we say we will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and we shall die

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:58.720
there.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.679
And if we sit still here, we die also.

00:03:01.679 --> 00:03:06.419
Now therefore come, and let us fall unto the host of the Syrians.

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:14.000
If they save us alive, we shall live, and if they kill us, we shall but die.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.880
This evening as we study this passage of Scripture, I've simply entitled the message from verse

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.820
number three there, four leprous men.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:22.820
Four leprous men.

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.440
I want you to consider a few things as we look at the passage this evening.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.539
Consider first of all their discussion.

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:33.360
In verse number three and four, I read those verses by way of introduction this evening,

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.419
and we find that God gives us a record of the discussion that these four men have.

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:43.020
Notice it says at the end of verse number three, they said one to another.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.500
They begin to have this discussion, and they begin to look at their circumstances.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.339
They understand all that is taking place, and we're aware of the fact as we read the

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:59.399
sixth chapter of 2 Kings that the people within the city were suffering greatly.

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:06.139
These four leprous men, because of the fact that they had leprosy, their circumstances

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:10.699
were even more grave than the circumstances of the people within the city.

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:13.139
So we find that they begin to have this discussion.

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:14.940
Notice what they say.

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.359
What a great question at the end of verse number three.

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:18.359
They look at each other.

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:23.399
They say one to another, why sit we here until we die?

00:04:23.399 --> 00:04:27.579
Basically they understood that because of their condition and because of the circumstances,

00:04:27.579 --> 00:04:32.179
that if they continued to do what they had been doing, that they were simply waiting

00:04:32.179 --> 00:04:33.700
to die.

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.899
There was no other possibility.

00:04:35.899 --> 00:04:40.059
There was no chance, little chance of survival, and they understood that they were going to

00:04:40.059 --> 00:04:42.339
sit there until they die.

00:04:42.339 --> 00:04:46.980
And so they have this conversation, this discussion amongst themselves, and notice what it says

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.459
in verse number four.

00:04:48.459 --> 00:04:54.540
If we say we will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and we shall die

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:55.540
there.

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.980
So they review their options, if you will, during this conversation, this discussion,

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:03.100
and we consider the discussion that they're having, and we find that they say, okay, if

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.059
we sit here, we're going to die.

00:05:05.059 --> 00:05:09.579
If we go into the city, we know that the city is having this great famine.

00:05:09.579 --> 00:05:14.019
We're aware of the circumstances, and so if we enter into the city, well, we're going

00:05:14.019 --> 00:05:15.779
to die there.

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:18.940
So they continue as they reason and have this discussion.

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.299
They say if we sit still here, we die also.

00:05:22.299 --> 00:05:26.420
They'd already kind of understood that at the end of verse number three, and they repeat

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:27.420
that as an option.

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.579
Well, we can go back to the city, we're going to die.

00:05:29.579 --> 00:05:32.100
We can stay here, we're going to die.

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:38.540
You continue reading in verse number four, and now therefore come and let us fall under

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.220
the host of the Syrians.

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.779
So now this is a different option.

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:45.579
Go back to Samaria, die.

00:05:45.579 --> 00:05:47.380
Stay here, die.

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.179
The Syrians are out there.

00:05:49.179 --> 00:05:51.140
They're the enemy.

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:54.179
They're the ones that have laid siege against the city.

00:05:54.179 --> 00:05:59.660
They're the reason that the city is in the condition that they're in.

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:04.779
They have been very successful from a military perspective, but notice what they say.

00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:07.260
Let us fall under the host of the Syrians.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:14.779
If they save us alive, we shall live, and if they kill us, we shall but die.

00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:16.500
So consider this third option.

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:21.260
They say, as they have this discussion, we read it in verses three and four.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.380
We understand that they outline the options.

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.339
They say, well, there's this third option.

00:06:25.339 --> 00:06:26.339
We can go to the Syrians.

00:06:26.339 --> 00:06:31.700
And it is possible that if we go to the Syrians, that they would save us alive, and therefore

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.420
we should live.

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:38.559
And if they kill us, well, that was the same option of going to Samaria and the same option

00:06:38.559 --> 00:06:45.220
of staying here, and so we should just go to the Syrians because that was the only potential

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.600
of survival.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.500
So they have this discussion, and we see their logic.

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:51.500
We see their reason.

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:56.459
We see how they reason through the process, and as we consider their discussion, we then

00:06:56.459 --> 00:06:57.739
consider their decision.

00:06:57.739 --> 00:06:58.779
They made the decision.

00:06:58.779 --> 00:07:02.660
They said, let us go, and the Bible tells us in verse number five, number two if you're

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:05.980
taking notes this evening, consider their decision.

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:13.799
It says this, and they rose up in the twilight to go unto the camp of the Syrians.

00:07:13.799 --> 00:07:21.440
They were taking a certain risk, but they had gone through the risk assessment, if you

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:22.440
will.

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:26.359
They had gone through the entire process, and they had concluded that it was best for

00:07:26.359 --> 00:07:32.440
them to make the decision to fall unto the Syrians, and the Bible tells us that they

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:36.359
went to the camp of the Syrians, and it says when they were come to the uttermost part

00:07:36.359 --> 00:07:39.359
of the camp of Syria, behold, there was no man there.

00:07:39.359 --> 00:07:45.160
So we find that they made the decision to go to the camp of the Syrians.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.920
The reality this evening is that we all make decisions.

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.559
Sometimes we make decisions the way that these guys made decisions.

00:07:51.559 --> 00:07:55.880
We just kind of had a logic reason through it, write down all of the options, and if

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:59.920
I do this, well, then this is going to happen, and we kind of go through that process.

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:05.679
There are other times, and we use other means of going through the decision-making process,

00:08:05.679 --> 00:08:08.679
but we make decisions all the time.

00:08:08.679 --> 00:08:14.239
The fact of the matter is that decisions have consequences, and we find that the prophet

00:08:14.239 --> 00:08:19.920
of old said that they're in the valley of decision, and oh, we have decisions to make,

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:23.160
and every single day, we have decisions that we make.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:28.519
Now, I will give you the reality is that some decisions are more weighty than other decisions.

00:08:28.519 --> 00:08:32.559
I mean, there are some decisions that are just, you know, you don't think too much about

00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:33.760
those decisions.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:38.080
There are some things that we do in life that we already made the decision.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:42.919
The die, if you will, the lot has already been cast, if you will, and we've made a decision

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:47.380
at some point in the past, and it's just a matter of following through with the decision,

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:51.479
but there are decisions that we face, and as we would look at the decision that they

00:08:51.479 --> 00:08:55.520
made, they said, we're going to go into the camp of the Syrians.

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:59.239
Now, we understand that there are going to be consequences for that decision.

00:08:59.239 --> 00:09:01.700
Now, we look at the passage of Scripture.

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:03.119
Some of us are familiar with it.

00:09:03.119 --> 00:09:04.119
You've read ahead.

00:09:04.119 --> 00:09:05.119
You understand.

00:09:05.119 --> 00:09:07.880
You know what's going on, and you find that, man, those were great consequences.

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:10.200
I mean, they made the right decision.

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:14.960
You know, it's easy to say that somebody made the right decision afterwards, but when you're

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:20.039
the one making the decision, when you're in that process, and you understand the need

00:09:20.039 --> 00:09:25.599
for wisdom and the need for godly counsel, and we understand that these men, these four,

00:09:25.599 --> 00:09:31.119
they just spoke amongst themselves and had that discussion, but they made that decision,

00:09:31.119 --> 00:09:36.200
and as we consider their discussion and their decision, we then notice, number three, their

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.520
discovery.

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.159
We notice their discovery.

00:09:39.159 --> 00:09:43.559
It's interesting that in verses six and seven, the Bible, the text of Scripture that is before

00:09:43.559 --> 00:09:48.840
us, gives us insight as to what God did and how God worked.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:55.039
Remember, the prophecy of Elisha was, hear ye the word of the Lord, thus saith the Lord,

00:09:55.039 --> 00:10:00.039
tomorrow, about this time, shall a measure of fine flour be sold.

00:10:00.039 --> 00:10:04.219
for a shekel and two measures of barley for a shekel in the gate of Samaria."

00:10:04.219 --> 00:10:05.679
It was a specific prophecy.

00:10:05.679 --> 00:10:08.539
We dealt with that, the content of the prophecy.

00:10:08.539 --> 00:10:14.559
We mentioned that last week and looked at the level of detail that was given and how

00:10:14.559 --> 00:10:18.719
Elisha was very specific with regard to what was going to happen, when it was going to

00:10:18.719 --> 00:10:21.399
happen, where it was going to happen.

00:10:21.399 --> 00:10:23.439
And the question is, how is it going to happen?

00:10:23.439 --> 00:10:25.999
Well, God shows us what he does.

00:10:25.999 --> 00:10:30.199
And we don't always know how God is going to work, but we know that God is going to

00:10:30.199 --> 00:10:32.799
work and we can trust him to work.

00:10:32.799 --> 00:10:35.919
We find in verses 6 and 7, the Bible says this,

00:10:35.919 --> 00:10:44.519
For the Lord had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of

00:10:44.519 --> 00:10:48.679
horses, even the noise of a great host.

00:10:48.679 --> 00:10:51.639
So God made them hear something.

00:10:51.639 --> 00:10:56.419
And he made them hear something that was a familiar sound, if you will.

00:10:56.419 --> 00:11:01.639
It was a sound that as they would reason together, they would conclude what they believed that

00:11:01.639 --> 00:11:02.719
it was.

00:11:02.719 --> 00:11:08.579
It says that he made them hear a noise of chariots, a noise of horses, even the noise

00:11:08.579 --> 00:11:12.199
of a great host.

00:11:12.199 --> 00:11:14.959
The Syrians said one to another,

00:11:14.959 --> 00:11:24.079
Lo, the king of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites and the kings

00:11:24.079 --> 00:11:28.279
of the Egyptians to come upon us.

00:11:28.279 --> 00:11:32.459
These Syrians who had been so successful at laying siege against the city of Samaria,

00:11:32.459 --> 00:11:34.319
they heard this noise.

00:11:34.319 --> 00:11:35.759
God caused them.

00:11:35.759 --> 00:11:38.199
God made them hear this noise.

00:11:38.199 --> 00:11:43.799
And they said, surely the king of Israel has hired the Hittites and the Egyptians.

00:11:43.799 --> 00:11:51.279
And now these forces are coming upon us and against us, and therefore the Bible tells

00:11:51.279 --> 00:11:58.559
us in verse number 7, wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents

00:11:58.559 --> 00:12:04.159
and their horses and their asses, even the camp as it was, and fled for their life.

00:12:04.159 --> 00:12:08.719
Now if you have a hard time understanding verse number 7, join the crowd.

00:12:08.719 --> 00:12:14.079
Because I would like to think if I was fleeing an approaching army, I'd get on my horse and

00:12:14.079 --> 00:12:15.599
try to get away.

00:12:15.599 --> 00:12:17.159
But they left everything.

00:12:17.159 --> 00:12:18.159
Why?

00:12:18.159 --> 00:12:20.039
Because God was working.

00:12:20.039 --> 00:12:24.879
You know that you find in the text of Scripture, not only here in 2 Kings, but various portions

00:12:24.879 --> 00:12:28.119
of Scripture, how God caused the people to be confused.

00:12:28.119 --> 00:12:33.599
The very enemies of God with Gideon and the Midianites, you know that Gideon and his small

00:12:33.599 --> 00:12:37.799
army didn't kill them all, they turned their swords against each other.

00:12:37.799 --> 00:12:40.039
God gives confusion.

00:12:40.039 --> 00:12:46.759
We find that these individuals, this great host, the Syrians, they hear this sound and

00:12:46.759 --> 00:12:52.439
they conclude that it's the Hittites and the Egyptians, and therefore they arose and they

00:12:52.439 --> 00:12:53.759
fled.

00:12:53.759 --> 00:12:59.439
They left their tents, their horses, their asses, the camp even as it was, and they fled

00:12:59.439 --> 00:13:00.439
for their life.

00:13:00.439 --> 00:13:03.679
So we come back to these four leprous men.

00:13:03.679 --> 00:13:08.359
Isn't it interesting that as these four leprous men are having this discussion that God's

00:13:08.359 --> 00:13:09.359
working?

00:13:09.359 --> 00:13:11.999
God's always at work.

00:13:11.999 --> 00:13:16.039
And these four leprous men are having their discussion, they're coming, they're reaching

00:13:16.039 --> 00:13:20.799
their decision, and God has already been at work.

00:13:20.799 --> 00:13:27.239
God has already had the Syrians hearing this great noise, and He's already given the prophecy

00:13:27.239 --> 00:13:28.399
through Elisha.

00:13:28.399 --> 00:13:30.879
Remember, He said tomorrow about this time.

00:13:31.399 --> 00:13:39.639
God was working, and these Syrians, these great warriors, fled for their life.

00:13:39.639 --> 00:13:42.239
We notice what they discovered.

00:13:42.239 --> 00:13:45.879
The Bible tells us that they found that the camp of the Syrians was empty.

00:13:45.879 --> 00:13:51.519
At the end of verse number 5, it says there was no man there.

00:13:51.519 --> 00:13:55.599
Notice in verse number 8 as we find that they came to the camp of the Syrians and it was

00:13:55.599 --> 00:13:59.519
empty, it says, and when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp, they went

00:13:59.519 --> 00:14:03.799
into one tent and did eat and drink and carried then silver and gold and raiment and went

00:14:03.799 --> 00:14:07.999
and hid it, and came again and entered into another tent and carried then also and went

00:14:07.999 --> 00:14:08.999
and hid it.

00:14:08.999 --> 00:14:13.159
I mean, tent after tent, just nobody there.

00:14:13.159 --> 00:14:14.159
Totally empty.

00:14:14.159 --> 00:14:15.159
What did they discover?

00:14:15.159 --> 00:14:16.839
Well, they found great spoil.

00:14:16.839 --> 00:14:18.799
They found provision.

00:14:18.799 --> 00:14:28.439
The Bible tells us in verse number 8 that they found sustenance, they did eat and drink.

00:14:28.439 --> 00:14:33.519
Now remember, the prophecy of Elisha was that tomorrow about this time a measure of

00:14:33.519 --> 00:14:37.279
fine flour would be sold for a shekel, two measures of barley for a shekel in the gate

00:14:37.279 --> 00:14:44.079
of Samaria, but yet we find prior to that, the siege had had such an impact on the food

00:14:44.079 --> 00:14:50.039
industry, if I could call it that, there in Samaria during that time, that the Bible tells

00:14:50.039 --> 00:14:55.399
us in verse number 25 of chapter 6 that an ass's head was sold for four score pieces

00:14:55.399 --> 00:15:02.759
of silver, 80 pieces of silver for the head of an unclean animal.

00:15:02.759 --> 00:15:09.299
Then he says that a shekel would get you a measure of fine flour and two measures of

00:15:09.299 --> 00:15:10.299
barley.

00:15:10.299 --> 00:15:12.979
One shekel, one shekel.

00:15:12.979 --> 00:15:18.479
So for two shekels, you get actually something that would be worth eating, and it's just

00:15:18.479 --> 00:15:20.159
beyond their comprehension.

00:15:20.159 --> 00:15:24.119
But now we find that in verse number 8, when these lepers come to the camp of the Syrians,

00:15:24.119 --> 00:15:28.879
they're finding tent after tent, they eat and drink, there's sustenance, there's food

00:15:28.879 --> 00:15:29.879
available.

00:15:29.879 --> 00:15:30.879
The Bible says they carried tents.

00:15:30.879 --> 00:15:33.999
Notice they had silver and gold and raiment.

00:15:33.999 --> 00:15:37.479
I mean, they had great spoil.

00:15:37.479 --> 00:15:40.399
And it says that they went and hid it.

00:15:40.399 --> 00:15:44.719
They came again and entered into another tent and carried tents also and went and hid it.

00:15:44.719 --> 00:15:48.999
Now I want to just get in the minds of these four guys just for a moment here in verse

00:15:48.999 --> 00:15:51.639
number 8 as they're going through this process.

00:15:51.639 --> 00:15:56.639
I mean, I believe that they're absolutely astounded as to what they're finding.

00:15:56.639 --> 00:16:02.919
Remember, in their logic, in their process of mitigating the risk and determining in

00:16:02.919 --> 00:16:06.839
their risk assessment, should we go back to Samaria, should we stay here, or should we

00:16:06.839 --> 00:16:12.119
go to the Syrians, they completely had the idea and the understanding that they would

00:16:12.119 --> 00:16:15.599
go to the Syrians and they would fall into the Syrians and then the Syrians, they would

00:16:15.599 --> 00:16:18.759
actually see them and they would actually make a decision on whether they're going to

00:16:18.759 --> 00:16:21.019
let them live or they're going to kill them.

00:16:21.019 --> 00:16:24.699
They didn't expect to get to the camp of the Syrians and have nobody there.

00:16:24.699 --> 00:16:28.659
And yet they arrive and there's no one.

00:16:28.659 --> 00:16:29.659
They're eating.

00:16:29.659 --> 00:16:31.059
I mean, can you imagine?

00:16:31.059 --> 00:16:35.419
I know that it's a dangerous thing, especially after you've fasted for a period of time or

00:16:35.419 --> 00:16:39.059
you've been in a situation where you've not been able to eat for a while and your mind

00:16:39.059 --> 00:16:43.119
thinks, I'm going to eat as much as I can, it's really hard on your body, it's a difficulty.

00:16:43.119 --> 00:16:47.539
But we find that they probably were just so overwhelmed with all of the things in the

00:16:47.539 --> 00:16:50.659
Bible so that they go and they start hiding things.

00:16:50.659 --> 00:16:56.059
And it's interesting for they come to this conclusion as we read what's happening and

00:16:56.059 --> 00:17:00.979
we find that they're going in these tents and they're finding this substance and this

00:17:00.979 --> 00:17:01.979
great spoil.

00:17:01.979 --> 00:17:05.899
But then notice there's another discussion they have amongst themselves and they say

00:17:05.899 --> 00:17:09.859
this in verse number nine, then they said one to another, notice these four words in

00:17:09.859 --> 00:17:14.259
verse number nine, we do not well.

00:17:14.259 --> 00:17:16.579
We do not well.

00:17:16.579 --> 00:17:19.779
Why did they conclude that they do not well?

00:17:19.899 --> 00:17:23.819
No, it says this, this day is a day of good tidings.

00:17:23.819 --> 00:17:30.179
Notice this next phrase, and we hold our peace.

00:17:30.179 --> 00:17:37.019
In other words, they come to, they reach the conclusion that they have found great spoil,

00:17:37.019 --> 00:17:42.499
they have found provision, they knew that the people of Samaria were starving.

00:17:42.499 --> 00:17:48.219
They knew that the seeds that had been laid against Samaria by the Syrians had had a great

00:17:48.339 --> 00:17:55.899
toll on the inhabitants of Samaria, and they understood that they now are in a place where

00:17:55.899 --> 00:18:02.419
they have good tidings that this is a wonderful day, there is substance available, the goods

00:18:02.419 --> 00:18:06.659
are here, and yet we hold our peace.

00:18:06.659 --> 00:18:12.819
They say this, if we tarry till the morning light, some mischief will come upon us.

00:18:12.819 --> 00:18:19.619
Now therefore come, that we may go and tell the king's household.

00:18:19.619 --> 00:18:25.019
They make this great discovery, and we notice the discovery that they make and how that

00:18:25.019 --> 00:18:30.979
they're taken care of as far as their needs are concerned, and these leprous men as they're

00:18:30.979 --> 00:18:36.419
there, and of course understanding some aspects of leprosy and understanding the nature of

00:18:36.419 --> 00:18:40.859
that during this particular time, they now come to that place and they say we do not

00:18:40.859 --> 00:18:42.339
well.

00:18:42.339 --> 00:18:48.219
Today, this day, is a day of good tidings and we hold our peace, and I wonder as we

00:18:48.219 --> 00:18:52.940
look at the truth of verse number nine, and I understand contextually what these four

00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:59.179
leprous men are saying, but I wonder this evening by way of application how often have

00:18:59.179 --> 00:19:05.299
we come to the place in our lives where we might say we do not well.

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:10.899
We know that we're living in the midst of a time, and I'm not speaking about just today

00:19:10.899 --> 00:19:15.219
being in the midst of a global pandemic, but I'm speaking about living in the midst of

00:19:15.219 --> 00:19:17.859
a lost and dying world.

00:19:17.859 --> 00:19:21.899
I'm speaking today about the fact that, you know, so many people are speaking about the

00:19:21.899 --> 00:19:28.719
fact that this number of people have died from coronavirus, and I understand the gravity

00:19:28.719 --> 00:19:36.559
of that situation, and I in no way, shape, or form do I seek to pretend that that's not

00:19:36.559 --> 00:19:37.719
something that has happened.

00:19:37.719 --> 00:19:38.719
It is.

00:19:38.719 --> 00:19:42.000
People are dying, and it's a sad thing.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.639
Death is sad, but death is a reality.

00:19:45.639 --> 00:19:48.619
As God's people, I had a conversation with someone just this week.

00:19:48.619 --> 00:19:52.639
As the people of God, I've asked countless people, I don't even know how many people

00:19:52.639 --> 00:19:58.079
I've asked in my life, in my time of being a believer, of saying something to somebody

00:19:58.079 --> 00:19:59.079
like this.

00:19:59.079 --> 00:20:00.079
If you were to die today, are you...

00:20:00.079 --> 00:20:04.479
100% sure you'd go to heaven. Why would I ask somebody that question? Because I

00:20:04.479 --> 00:20:08.119
understand the reality of death. I understand the Bible says, as of the

00:20:08.119 --> 00:20:12.359
point of unto man wants to die, but after this the judgment. I understand the

00:20:12.359 --> 00:20:17.039
Bible says the wages of sin is death. I understand that. If you've come to our

00:20:17.039 --> 00:20:21.799
church for any period of time, you understand that as well. And the reality

00:20:21.799 --> 00:20:30.439
is that, again, I do not mean to lack sensitivity or to have some level of

00:20:30.439 --> 00:20:36.959
being callous towards the deaths of those from this COVID-19. It's a reality.

00:20:36.959 --> 00:20:42.519
But you understand that since January 1st of this year, if we were to take

00:20:42.519 --> 00:20:46.639
basically the same time frame of what we've been dealing with, I know that it

00:20:46.639 --> 00:20:50.279
didn't start here in America at that time, at least by what they're telling us,

00:20:50.279 --> 00:20:58.919
but if you just look at 2020, nearly 23 million people worldwide have died. 23

00:20:58.919 --> 00:21:03.879
million people worldwide. Not from coronavirus, but just because of death.

00:21:03.879 --> 00:21:08.999
And you say, oh you're not being sensitive. I promise you I'm not trying

00:21:08.999 --> 00:21:15.199
to lack sensitivity. I'm simply speaking a truth that's a biblical truth. You

00:21:15.199 --> 00:21:21.279
understand what Solomon said? There's a time to be born, there's a time to die. In

00:21:21.279 --> 00:21:28.079
fact, it's interesting and it's something that, you know, maybe sometimes we

00:21:28.079 --> 00:21:33.319
shy away from this truth, but we know that it's a biblical truth and we find

00:21:33.319 --> 00:21:37.959
that Solomon says this in Ecclesiastes 7 and verse number 2, it is better to go

00:21:37.959 --> 00:21:43.879
to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting, for that is the

00:21:43.879 --> 00:21:49.999
end of all men, and the living will lay it to his heart. Ecclesiastes 7 and verse

00:21:49.999 --> 00:21:56.359
number 2. See, the reality this evening is that if I don't die from coronavirus,

00:21:56.359 --> 00:22:04.359
I'm gonna die from something, right? So are you. It's the way it is. And as I look

00:22:04.359 --> 00:22:08.839
to make application from this verse of Scripture in my life, if I

00:22:08.839 --> 00:22:13.079
understand that, and we would often say even as I've shared the gospel with

00:22:13.079 --> 00:22:17.959
people, countless people during my life as a believer, I've said to them, as is

00:22:17.959 --> 00:22:20.919
appointed unto man who wants to die, I've said to them, the wages of sin is death.

00:22:20.919 --> 00:22:27.079
And I've said something like this, that's the bad news, but can I tell you the good

00:22:27.079 --> 00:22:32.079
news? What do they say? This day is a day of good tidings. What's the good news?

00:22:32.079 --> 00:22:39.719
Jesus died for you. He conquered sin, death, and the grave. He died in your

00:22:39.719 --> 00:22:44.879
place. God made Him to be sin for us who knew no sin, that we might be made the

00:22:44.879 --> 00:22:51.199
righteousness of God in Him. We find that He is victorious, that He rose in victory

00:22:51.199 --> 00:22:56.199
on day three, and He's delivered us from the power of death. He's delivered us

00:22:56.199 --> 00:23:01.279
from the fear of death. Some might look at me, perhaps, or someone might look at

00:23:01.279 --> 00:23:06.479
you as a believer and say, you just don't seem to have the understanding of all

00:23:06.479 --> 00:23:10.839
that's taking place, and you don't see the gravity of the situation. No, simply, I

00:23:10.839 --> 00:23:15.159
don't have a fear of death. The Bible tells us in Hebrews 2 and verse number

00:23:15.159 --> 00:23:19.359
15, and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to

00:23:19.359 --> 00:23:24.639
bondage. I am thankful this evening to say I don't have that bondage. I don't

00:23:24.639 --> 00:23:28.919
have a fear of death. Now don't misunderstand me, I'm not hoping to die

00:23:28.919 --> 00:23:33.839
this evening, but if I were, I'd be with my Savior. I said to my kids last week

00:23:33.959 --> 00:23:38.439
when we got the news that Mary Fenley had gone home to be with the Lord, I was

00:23:38.439 --> 00:23:43.519
reminded of a wonderful account and testimony of that great preacher of

00:23:43.519 --> 00:23:48.999
yesteryear, D.L. Moody, and he said this, he said, one day you're going to read in the

00:23:48.999 --> 00:23:54.239
papers that D.L. Moody's dead. He said, you don't believe it, don't believe it for

00:23:54.239 --> 00:24:00.199
one second, because on that day D.L. Moody is more alive than he's ever been in his

00:24:00.199 --> 00:24:05.479
life. Praise the Lord. I said to my kids, Mary's left this earth, but man, she's

00:24:05.479 --> 00:24:11.159
more alive than she's ever been. She's got eternal life. She's transformed,

00:24:11.159 --> 00:24:16.679
right? This mortal shall put on immortality, 1 Corinthians 15. I mean, do

00:24:16.679 --> 00:24:20.679
we believe the book or not? Amen? To be asked of the body is to be present with the

00:24:20.679 --> 00:24:24.559
Lord. What did Paul say? He said, I'm in a strait betwixt two, having desire to part

00:24:24.599 --> 00:24:29.999
to be with him which is far better, Philippians 1. See, the reality this

00:24:29.999 --> 00:24:34.519
evening is that we look at all of these things are going on in our world today, I

00:24:34.519 --> 00:24:39.399
really believe that what's happening is there's a greater awareness by a greater

00:24:39.399 --> 00:24:46.119
percentage of our population that death is a reality. And just a few months ago

00:24:46.119 --> 00:24:52.719
they lived as if they were immortal. They had no thought of death or dying. I believe

00:24:52.719 --> 00:24:57.959
it gives us a unique opportunity. There are unique challenges because it's

00:24:57.959 --> 00:25:02.279
difficult talking to people because they're so like, stay away from me. But

00:25:02.279 --> 00:25:09.599
the reality is that this thing that these men had discovered, that they

00:25:09.599 --> 00:25:16.359
concluded we do not well because we hold our peace, the reality that we know the

00:25:16.359 --> 00:25:22.239
truth of eternity and the power of the gospel, if we refrain from telling others

00:25:22.239 --> 00:25:27.919
we ought to come to the same conclusion that these men came to. We do not well.

00:25:27.919 --> 00:25:33.399
It is our jobs, our mission, our responsibility to preach the gospel to

00:25:33.399 --> 00:25:39.399
every creature. I know contextually, again, if you want to call me or text me or

00:25:39.399 --> 00:25:44.559
email me about the context, I know what the context is. It's about the Syrians

00:25:44.559 --> 00:25:49.239
and the Sumerians and the good and the spoil. We make application from God's

00:25:49.239 --> 00:25:54.479
Word, and I believe this evening that there's good application for us. What was

00:25:54.479 --> 00:26:01.639
the remedy? What was their conclusion? They didn't just say we do not well, but

00:26:01.639 --> 00:26:06.919
man, that tent has more food and more gold, let's go get some more. No, no. They

00:26:06.919 --> 00:26:13.079
recognized we do not well and therefore they changed their approach. Number four,

00:26:13.079 --> 00:26:18.039
if you're taking notes, notice their declaration. In verse number 10 the Bible

00:26:18.039 --> 00:26:24.239
says this, so they came and called unto the porter of the city. So they

00:26:24.239 --> 00:26:28.399
were there and they were in a place where they said if we stay here we're

00:26:28.399 --> 00:26:32.399
gonna die, if we go to Sumeria we're gonna die, if we go to the Syrians we

00:26:32.399 --> 00:26:36.079
might die but they might keep us alive and so therefore let us go to the

00:26:36.079 --> 00:26:39.959
Syrians and they go and they find that there's no one there and they find food

00:26:39.959 --> 00:26:44.079
and they find drink and they find raiment and they find gold and silver

00:26:44.079 --> 00:26:47.999
and they say we do not well so they make this decision they turn back and

00:26:47.999 --> 00:26:54.119
they make a declaration they return to the city to deliver the glad tidings the

00:26:54.119 --> 00:26:57.599
Bible says so they came and called to the port of their city and they told

00:26:57.599 --> 00:27:02.959
them saying we came to the camp of the Syrians and behold there was no man

00:27:02.959 --> 00:27:08.199
there neither voice of man but horses tied and asses tied and the tents as

00:27:08.199 --> 00:27:14.359
they were I just wonder if the porter said can you repeat that you found what

00:27:14.359 --> 00:27:19.799
are you sure the king by the way didn't believe it the king is told about what

00:27:19.799 --> 00:27:24.439
happens in verse 11 and 12 the Bible says that the the porters he called the

00:27:24.439 --> 00:27:29.079
porters and they told it to the king's house and he said they've set a trap for

00:27:29.079 --> 00:27:33.239
us they know that we're hungry and they've just set a trap and we'll deal

00:27:33.239 --> 00:27:37.399
with this text next Wednesday evening but I want you to understand their

00:27:37.399 --> 00:27:41.359
declaration notice their declaration they come I believe that they come with

00:27:41.359 --> 00:27:47.159
great joy I believe that they come with with a level of excitement as they call

00:27:47.159 --> 00:27:52.599
for the porters and or the porter of the city and they begin to declare to them

00:27:52.599 --> 00:27:58.639
what they found what they saw what they experienced and I wonder this evening

00:27:58.639 --> 00:28:04.319
when we're telling others about the glad tidings about the gospel do they see a

00:28:04.359 --> 00:28:12.039
level of joy and excitement in our lives do they see a a transformed life do they

00:28:12.039 --> 00:28:17.079
see that that God's really made a difference in my life that that this

00:28:17.079 --> 00:28:25.679
thing is real the power of a transformed life see they experience something and

00:28:25.679 --> 00:28:31.199
because of their experience because of what they had found there in the camp

00:28:31.199 --> 00:28:37.559
of the Syrians I believe that this joy was obvious in their demeanor in their

00:28:37.559 --> 00:28:42.159
speech and their approach and all that they said and I believe that that's why

00:28:42.159 --> 00:28:47.399
the porter called to the king because he believed them he believed that he's

00:28:47.399 --> 00:28:51.559
telling the truth this wasn't a setup the Syrians had not got these four

00:28:51.559 --> 00:28:56.039
leprous men and called them and devised this plan I believe that there was a

00:28:56.039 --> 00:29:02.559
level of of belief by this on the part of the porter as he received this

00:29:02.559 --> 00:29:10.359
message as we look at 2nd Kings 7 we see it begins with a prophecy of provision

00:29:10.359 --> 00:29:15.599
we find that there's these four leprous men it's exciting to see how God is

00:29:15.599 --> 00:29:21.599
working what God is doing how God worked what God did and we find that God is

00:29:21.599 --> 00:29:26.319
always at work we find that these four leprous men not only were their lives

00:29:26.319 --> 00:29:32.319
spared but they were able to bring glad tidings back to the city they were able

00:29:32.319 --> 00:29:37.039
to tell the city the inhabitants of the city the people that were in despair the

00:29:37.039 --> 00:29:40.599
people that were desperate that had turned to cannibalism they're able to go

00:29:40.599 --> 00:29:46.959
and deliver a message of hope they were hopeless and helpless the Bible speaks

00:29:46.959 --> 00:29:53.319
about the hope that we have as believers it's not a hope so kind of a I wish I

00:29:53.319 --> 00:29:57.639
hope it happens kind of a the way the world would use the word but it's a it's

00:29:57.639 --> 00:30:01.759
an expectation based upon a revealed truth

00:30:01.759 --> 00:30:07.479
Understand that God's told us this, he's given us his word, and he is to be trusted.

00:30:07.479 --> 00:30:14.079
This evening, four leprous men, we see their discussion, their decision, we then notice

00:30:14.079 --> 00:30:19.839
their discovery, what a discovery it was, and then we notice their declaration.

00:30:19.839 --> 00:30:23.039
They return to the city with glad tidings.

00:30:23.039 --> 00:30:29.159
This evening, oh that God would help us to declare to those that he would allow us to

00:30:29.159 --> 00:30:32.759
have contact with, the glad tidings.

00:30:32.759 --> 00:30:36.759
We sing the song, Jesus saves, Jesus saves.

00:30:36.759 --> 00:30:43.239
What a wonderful song it is, and oh it's precious to sing the song within the walls of this

00:30:43.239 --> 00:30:49.479
building that God has given us, but you know the world needs to know that Jesus saves.

00:30:49.479 --> 00:30:55.359
He is the only hope for America or for any other country around this world, Jesus is

00:30:55.359 --> 00:30:56.359
the answer.

00:30:56.359 --> 00:30:59.879
Father, we love you this evening, we thank you for loving us.

00:30:59.879 --> 00:31:04.839
Lord, as we look at these four leprous men and we see contextually the account that takes

00:31:04.839 --> 00:31:12.279
place and we understand the circumstances surrounding the battle between the Syrians

00:31:12.279 --> 00:31:18.519
and the people of Israel, and we understand that the Syrians had besieged Samaria, and

00:31:18.519 --> 00:31:23.159
they had been quite successful, the people were starving and hungry, and then we begin

00:31:23.159 --> 00:31:29.119
to read about these four leprous men, and while they were entertaining this idea of

00:31:29.119 --> 00:31:35.999
going to the Syrians, you were at work, you allowed those great warriors to hear noise

00:31:35.999 --> 00:31:40.439
and to flee, and everything was left in the camp.

00:31:40.439 --> 00:31:50.119
God, we notice how they respond and understand that we do not well.

00:31:50.119 --> 00:31:58.839
Lord, this evening I pray that we would have a measure of that spirit this evening.

00:31:58.839 --> 00:32:04.519
Lord, that you'd help us to understand that you've been so good to us.

00:32:04.519 --> 00:32:13.239
If our gospel be hid, Paul said it is hid to them that are lost, 2 Corinthians 4.

00:32:13.239 --> 00:32:17.239
We sing the song with the little kids, this little light of mine, I'm going to let it

00:32:17.239 --> 00:32:21.519
shine, let it shine, let it shine, let it shine.

00:32:21.519 --> 00:32:28.559
I wonder if the little kids see us letting our light shine, not just singing about it,

00:32:28.559 --> 00:32:30.799
but actually doing it.

00:32:30.799 --> 00:32:38.559
God help us, help us to deliver glad tidings.

00:32:38.559 --> 00:32:42.999
Jesus saves, Jesus saves.

00:32:42.999 --> 00:32:44.759
We pray that you would bless our time of prayer.

00:32:44.759 --> 00:32:47.219
We thank you for the privilege of prayer.

00:32:47.219 --> 00:32:49.739
We pray that you'd be honored and glorified through all we say and do.

00:32:49.739 --> 00:32:52.299
For it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
