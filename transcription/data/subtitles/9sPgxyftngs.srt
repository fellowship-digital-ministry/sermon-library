1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
chapter number 39 this evening, Genesis chapter number 39.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And if you look there and hold your place and turn back

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
to chapter number 37, I'll read just a couple of verses by way of

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
introduction from the 37th chapter. You remember chapter 38

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
almost serves as a parenthetical, if you will, dealing with the

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
situation there with Judah and Tamar. We looked at that in a

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
previous message, but it's been since chapter 37 that we looked at the life

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
of Joseph. And as we looked at that passage at the end of chapter

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
number 37, in fact, as we look there, that was all

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
the way back on July the 16th. And so it's August 20th

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
today. And so it's been several weeks since we've studied the latter part of

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Genesis chapter 37. Remember, it was in that passage of scripture that

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Jacob had given Joseph the responsibility to go and to check

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
on his brothers. And his brothers decided that they were going to kill him. And then they

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
thought that, well, instead of killing him, we'll sell him to be a

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
slave and they'll be able to make some money. And we find that

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
they did just that. And as you note at the end of the chapter, they come

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
back to their father, Jacob, and they bring that coat of many colors,

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
which was so obvious as to who that belonged to. Of course,

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Jacob gave that to Joseph. And as they

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
give this coat that they had dipped in the blood of a kid of

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
the goats that they killed, they said, this have we found. Know now

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
whether it be thy son's coat or no. At that particular time,

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
according to verse number 33, at the end of the verse, Jacob reached the

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
conclusion that I think the boys hoped that they would reach, that he would

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
reach, and that is that Joseph is without doubt rent in

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
pieces. He believed that Joseph was dead. But in

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
fact, Joseph was not dead. He was on his way to Egypt to become a

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
slave. And the Bible tells us in verse number 36, the Midianites

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
sold him, Joseph, into Egypt unto Potiphar,

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
an officer of Pharaoh's and captain of the guard.

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
As you begin verse number 1 of chapter 39, you read basically the same

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
statement where the Bible says that Joseph was brought down to Egypt

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmaelites,

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
which had brought him down thither.

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
The Bible says that the Lord was with Joseph, and he was a

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
prosperous man, and he was in the house of his master,

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
the Egyptian. This evening as we look at this portion of

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Scripture, the dialogue of Genesis chapter number 39 actually

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
reads pretty quickly. As you get into the chapter and you see what's going on,

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
it reads very quickly. However,

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I want to point out for us this evening, by way of introduction to this particular

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
chapter, that we would understand that the events that are recorded in Genesis

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
39 really don't happen quickly. The events in Genesis

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
chapter number 39 that Joseph served with

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Potiphar before the accusation of Potiphar's wife

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
and all of those things, he served there for about 10 years.

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And the reason that we know that, if you consider and just follow along with

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
this line of reasoning by way of introduction, again, it's just so

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
that we can understand his faithful service and that it was a lengthy time in

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
which he was there. According to Genesis chapter number 37, when we're first

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
introduced to Joseph, he's 17 years old. And we find

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
that those events go very quickly there with regard to

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
what's recorded in chapter 37. And then we find in Genesis chapter number

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
41, after the dreams of Pharaoh, and

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
they call for Joseph, Pharaoh calls for

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Joseph, and Joseph interprets the dreams and he provides him with

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
counsel after the interpretation. And we find that Pharaoh says

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
this is the one that we need to set in a place of leadership. And the

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Bible tells us in Genesis 41 and verse 46 that Joseph was

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
30 years old when he stood before Pharaoh, king of Egypt.

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And so we see that we would go from 17 to 30, from

64
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
chapter number 37 to chapter number 41, and we know that

65
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
within that period of time, Joseph was forgotten in prison

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
for two full years. According to Genesis 41 and verse

67
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
number 1, after he'd interpreted the dreams of the butler and the baker,

68
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
we find that he says to the butler, remember me,

69
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
and the butler forgot him, and it says that it was two

70
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
full years, and then that's when Pharaoh dreamed

71
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
a dream. And so as you look at this, some Bible scholars would say that it's as

72
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
much as 13 years that he would serve there. I think when you look at the calculations,

73
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
no doubt I think a conservative estimate would

74
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
be that Joseph was serving in the house of Potiphar for at least

75
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
10 years. Now, when you read Genesis chapter number 39, you may

76
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
not get that when you're just reading through it because it goes very quickly

77
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
as to what's taking place. Understand that Joseph did not

78
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
become the overseer to have the

79
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
position that he did after just one week of working for Potiphar.

80
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
He was a slave that was purchased, and so there's a period of time,

81
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
a process that goes through, and we find that Joseph is in that place.

82
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
We've titled the message this evening, as you look at the bulletin there,

83
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
the Lord was with Joseph, and I want to point out, as we look at Genesis

84
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
39, the statements that are made. We read verse number 2 already. Notice

85
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
the Bible says, and the Lord was with Joseph. Notice in

86
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
verse number 3, the Bible says, and his master, that's Potiphar, saw

87
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
that the Lord was with him. We'll come back to that thought here in just a moment as we get

88
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
into the message, and the Bible says that the Lord made all that he did to

89
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
prosper in his hand. Skip down, if you will, and look at verse number 21.

90
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
This is after the accusation and the imprisonment, and now Joseph

91
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
finds himself in prison, and the Bible says in verse number 21, but

92
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
the Lord was with Joseph, and showed him mercy and gave

93
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison. Again, in verse 23,

94
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
the Bible says that the keeper of the prison looked not to anything that was under his hand.

95
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Why? Because the Lord was with him, and that which he did,

96
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
the Lord made it to prosper. We see four times in really

97
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
a short period of time looking, as far as Bible

98
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
verses are concerned, 23 verses. You could read chapter 39

99
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
in just a few minutes, and that's just at a really leisurely

100
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
type of rate, and you read it in just a few minutes, and you find that

101
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
on four occasions, God points out to us the Holy Spirit of

102
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
God through the inspiration. We

103
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
find that four times the human penman writes that the

104
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Lord was with Joseph. Now that's precious to me.

105
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Why? Because the Lord's with us. He's with us.

106
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
See, we can begin to look at the passage of Scripture, and we can

107
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
see when Joseph is there in the house of Potiphar,

108
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
and he's made an overseer, and he has this position, even though

109
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
he's a servant, he attains this position, and he's working, and so on and so

110
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
forth, and we can say, okay, I can see the Lord with Joseph there.

111
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
But then Joseph is in prison after being falsely accused.

112
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
And even there, the Bible reminds us that the Lord is with

113
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
him. The Lord is with him. I would submit to you that even though the

114
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Holy Scripture does not tell us in these words

115
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
in chapter number 37, while Joseph was down in that pit,

116
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
God was with him. The Lord was with him.

117
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
See, this evening we have this wonderful promise from the book of Hebrews in the 13th

118
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
chapter, where the Bible says that God will never

119
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
leave us nor forsake us. Isn't that a wonderful

120
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Bible truth? It is a, it's said, I read

121
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
this years ago, that a preacher was preaching and made a comment about

122
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
that verse of Scripture and about it being a wonderful promise, and an elderly

123
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
saint of God interrupted the preacher and said, preacher, it's more than a promise,

124
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
it's a reality. And I'm thankful for that, amen? It's

125
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
definitely a promise, but it's a reality in our lives that the Lord is with us.

126
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And as we begin to think about that and using that as the title for our message this evening,

127
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I find that the truth that God is with us and the truth of how

128
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
the Lord was with Joseph, and Joseph was living in the

129
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
presence of God. See, the reality this evening

130
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
is that the Lord is with us whether we live every day aware

131
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
of that truth or not. What do I mean by that? Well,

132
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
every day of your life you can live being aware,

133
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
keenly aware of the fact that the Lord is with you.

134
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
And I would submit to you that as we live that way, that it will impact the way that we live

135
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
our lives. Why? Because the Lord is with us.

136
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I would say that we can go through life and sometimes get busy

137
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
and get distracted and maybe not really be mindful

138
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
of the fact, not that we've forgotten the truth, but not

139
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
really live in the presence of God.

140
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And we find this evening that the truth of this

141
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
statement that we read four times in this single chapter of

142
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
God's Word would reveal to us, and I believe that it impacts

143
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
us to understand there's great comfort in this truth.

144
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
God's with us. What did the psalmist say in Psalm 23?

145
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear

146
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
no evil. Why? For thou art

147
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
with me. Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort

148
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
me. And we find that the truth of God's

149
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
presence and being in, that the Lord is

150
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
with us and He's with us everywhere we go, it brings comfort.

151
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It really does. I'm so thankful that every place we go, we go with the Lord.

152
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It's comforting. Remember the truth of Jesus giving the Great Commission in Matthew 28,

153
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
the way that it's recorded there, and lo, I am with you always.

154
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Right? That's the promise that He gives at the end of the Great Commission,

155
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
as we often refer to it as in Matthew 28, 18 through 20.

156
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,000
And lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. Amen.

157
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,000
This evening, that truth, as comforting as it is, I believe this evening is also a convicting truth.

158
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
The Lord is with us.

159
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You know, there are certain things that we do in life as human beings.

160
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
There are tendencies that we have, and there are certain things that we will do,

161
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
and there are certain things that we will not do based upon whose presence we're in.

162
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Have you ever found that to be the case?

163
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
And we find that as we live life and we think about observing the behavior of children,

164
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
oftentimes we can see that children may behave a certain way in the presence of their parents,

165
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
while they may behave a different way in the absence of their parents.

166
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I have found, and no doubt you have found as well,

167
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,000
that there's an amazing impact that takes place on the highways of America

168
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,000
when there is the presence of a state trooper, a state police officer, a county police officer,

169
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
a sheriff or whomever it might be.

170
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:34,000
There is an impact that the presence of that particular vehicle has on those driving around you.

171
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Have you seen it to be the case? Absolutely.

172
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I'm driving down the road, many times it's happened, and I'm going the speed limit.

173
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I'm not breaking the law, and I'm driving,

174
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
and all of a sudden there's a police officer up ahead and people are slamming on their brakes,

175
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
and they're slowing down, and they're not even going the speed limit.

176
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
And I say something like this, you're at least allowed to drive the speed limit.

177
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Don't mind the fact that there's a police officer there.

178
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Like, you can still drive.

179
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
But what happens? Why do they hit their brakes?

180
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Well, for many of them, it's because they're speeding.

181
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
They don't want to get a ticket.

182
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:17,000
So the presence of that law enforcement officer has an impact on the behavior.

183
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
And this evening, listen, when we live in the presence of God,

184
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I believe that's why we read Genesis 39 the way that we do.

185
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
There's a great contrast between Genesis 39 and Genesis 38.

186
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:35,000
You understand this evening that Judah and Joseph are brothers.

187
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Their behavior, as is recorded in Genesis 38, and their behavior, as is recorded in Genesis 39, is so opposite.

188
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
And I believe that a key is the fact that the Bible tells us that Joseph was living,

189
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
he understood, he was aware of the presence of God Almighty.

190
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Understand with me that even as Joseph would live in a foreign land, in pagan territory,

191
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
that Joseph understood the presence of God.

192
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Whither can I flee from his presence?

193
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
What's the answer? I can't. I can't. I can't.

194
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
And by the way, that's comforting, and it's convicting.

195
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Though Joseph was sold into slavery, though he finds himself in Egypt land,

196
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
in a place that's idolatrous, polytheistic,

197
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
we find that Joseph was living in the very presence of God.

198
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,000
As we look at this chapter this evening, I want you to notice in the first several verses of Genesis 39,

199
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
number one, notice with me, Joseph the overseer.

200
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Joseph the overseer.

201
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
The Bible says in verse number two,

202
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And the Lord was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man,

203
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.

204
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
The Bible says that his master saw that the Lord was with him,

205
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
and that the Lord made all that he did to prosper in his hand.

206
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him,

207
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.

208
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house,

209
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
and over all that he had, that the Lord blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake,

210
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
and the blessing of the Lord was upon all that he had in the house and in the field.

211
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand, and knew not aught he had,

212
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
save the bread which he did eat, and Joseph was a goodly person,

213
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
and well favored.

214
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
In these first six verses of Genesis 39, we see Joseph as the overseer.

215
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I believe that as you look at this particular passage of Scripture,

216
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
you begin to see Joseph in this position,

217
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
that Joseph is walking with the Lord,

218
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
that Joseph is living according to the principles by which he had been taught.

219
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
And we've already looked at some things with regard to the character of Joseph

220
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
in previous messages,

221
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
and we find that the Bible tells us that the Lord was with Joseph in verse number two,

222
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
but I want you to notice the statement in verse number three,

223
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
when the Bible says that his master saw that the Lord was with him.

224
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Isn't that an interesting statement?

225
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
As you would think about Potiphar observing the life and the behavior of Joseph,

226
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,000
and Joseph a man that was living for and walking with the Lord his God,

227
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
the Bible tells us that the Lord is with him and that he was a prosperous man,

228
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
and now we find that the Bible says that Potiphar, this Egyptian man,

229
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
this man that was an officer of Pharaoh, he was captain of the guard,

230
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:32,000
he recognizes, he sees in Joseph that this was a man that the Lord was with.

231
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
That's impactful.

232
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It's important for us to understand as we look at this particular truth

233
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
and think about the observation that Pharaoh makes,

234
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
and looking at the life and the behavior,

235
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
and looking at the blessings, he reaches this conclusion that the Lord was with him,

236
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
and I wonder this evening that as we think about the life of Joseph,

237
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,000
and as even we would examine our own lives, I wonder if others can see that the Lord is with us.

238
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I wonder this evening how many people would look at your life and look at my life

239
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
and say the Lord is with them.

240
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Hold your place here and turn to the book of Acts in the fourth chapter, if you will,

241
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
and notice what the Bible tells us, a passage that many of us would be familiar with this evening,

242
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
but in Acts chapter number four, as we look at this portion of Scripture

243
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
and look at Peter standing up filled with the Holy Spirit of God,

244
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
speaking and giving answer to these religious leaders

245
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
in the early days of the church being established,

246
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:36,000
we find that Peter gets up and he's filled with the Holy Ghost according to verse number eight,

247
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
and in Acts chapter number four, the Bible tells us that he's really giving this message.

248
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Notice he says in verse number nine,

249
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
if we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man

250
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
by what means he has made whole, be it known unto you all and to all the people of Israel

251
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom he crucified,

252
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole.

253
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,000
This is the stone which was set at Nott of you builders, which has become the head of the corner.

254
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
In verse number 12, he makes it very, very plain to these religious leaders,

255
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
neither is there salvation in any other, for there is none other name under heaven

256
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
given among men whereby we must be saved.

257
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Notice verse 13, though.

258
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
The Bible says, now when they, that's the religious leaders,

259
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:32,000
those that had questioned the actions of and are examining the disciples,

260
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
the Bible says that when they saw the boldness of Peter and John

261
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marveled.

262
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Notice what the Bible says, they took knowledge of them that they had been with Jesus.

263
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Listen, I believe this evening that you, if you spend time with the Lord, it's going to be obvious.

264
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
It's going to be evident, it's going to come out, so to speak.

265
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Does that make sense this evening?

266
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:07,000
And we think about the truth of Joseph living in the presence of God and walking with the Lord,

267
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:14,000
and this Egyptian man, this man that is in this culture and in this society

268
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,000
that's a polytheistic, idolatrous nation, we find that he makes this statement

269
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:27,000
and he says that he saw that the Lord was with him.

270
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:36,000
We find that as Joseph is living there in Egypt, as he's serving there in Potiphar's house,

271
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
that Potiphar makes this observation, notice the end of verse number three,

272
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:46,000
and the Bible says that the Lord made all that he did to prosper in his hand.

273
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Understand with me this evening that this is not something that just happened by chance.

274
00:18:53,000 --> 00:19:00,000
There is a biblical truth, principle, that is established throughout God's word,

275
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:07,000
and that is that God's blessing and a favor is upon them that walk uprightly.

276
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Those in whom God delights.

277
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I understand that the New Testament tells us that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance,

278
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:23,000
and that is a biblical truth that we understand within the context of that truth that is being given,

279
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:31,000
but I would say, broadly speaking, God's blessing and God's favor is upon those who walk with God.

280
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Amen?

281
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
The Bible tells us later in the book of Deuteronomy, in the 11th chapter,

282
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
that Moses is standing before the children of Israel, and he says to them,

283
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I give you this day a blessing and a curse.

284
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:51,000
And we find here that the Bible says that the Lord made all that he did to prosper in his hand.

285
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Understand that it was not that Joseph was somehow just, man, he's just, everything he touches is gold.

286
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
You ever hear somebody use that phraseology?

287
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,980
It seems like everything they touch is just gold.

288
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:06,820
How about they just walk with God and God's blessing them?

289
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:10,619
And we see here with Joseph that as we look at his life

290
00:20:10,619 --> 00:20:13,939
and we look at the observation of this man Potiphar,

291
00:20:13,939 --> 00:20:17,899
that he says, I see his master saw that the Lord was

292
00:20:17,899 --> 00:20:22,180
with him and that the Lord made all that he did

293
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,860
to prosper in his hand.

294
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:27,100
In Deuteronomy 11, when the Bible speaks about that blessing

295
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:31,819
and that curse, it makes it abundantly clear as to the way

296
00:20:31,819 --> 00:20:34,939
by which we can receive either the blessing of the curse,

297
00:20:34,939 --> 00:20:37,380
a blessing if you obey the commandments of the Lord,

298
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,700
your God, which I command you this day,

299
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,340
and a curse if you will not obey the commandments

300
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,340
of the Lord, your God.

301
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:47,419
This evening, as we look at Joseph, the overseer,

302
00:20:47,419 --> 00:20:49,799
and as we look at this life of Joseph,

303
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:54,380
and we look at the observation of the master of Potiphar

304
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:57,779
and what he observed and what he saw in the life of Joseph,

305
00:20:57,779 --> 00:21:00,139
Joseph was a man that was walking with God

306
00:21:01,299 --> 00:21:04,540
and had God's favor upon his life.

307
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,639
Listen, this evening, do you want the blessing of God

308
00:21:06,639 --> 00:21:08,059
in your life?

309
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:10,500
You want God's favor in your life?

310
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,019
I do.

311
00:21:12,019 --> 00:21:14,080
I desire God's blessing in my life.

312
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,900
I desire God's favor.

313
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:21,900
I want God to be pleased with me, to delight in us.

314
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:25,860
And we find this evening that Joseph is in that position.

315
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,540
Notice that the result of this in verse number four,

316
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:32,980
the Bible says, and Joseph found grace in his sight.

317
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:36,059
And it says that he served him.

318
00:21:37,099 --> 00:21:40,339
I want you to think about that statement just for a moment

319
00:21:40,339 --> 00:21:42,540
and think about where Joseph is.

320
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:45,120
Think about the circumstances that have led

321
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,139
to Joseph being in this place as being a slave,

322
00:21:48,139 --> 00:21:51,879
a servant in the house of Potiphar.

323
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,040
He simply obeyed the commandment of his father

324
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:59,000
when his father said, go and check on your brothers.

325
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,860
Back in Genesis 37, we've studied through that portion

326
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,440
of scripture in previous weeks.

327
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,059
And we find that Joseph was simply obedient to that

328
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:08,520
which he had been told to do.

329
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,000
And he finds himself as soon as he arrives,

330
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,320
remember the brothers see him as he's coming

331
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,559
from a distance, that coat of many colors was a distinction.

332
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:19,740
And we find that they begin to conspire against him.

333
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:23,500
As soon as he arrives in their presence,

334
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,020
they're stripping him out of that coat of many colors

335
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,619
and they put him in that pit

336
00:22:27,619 --> 00:22:30,139
and they sell him into slavery.

337
00:22:31,899 --> 00:22:35,179
Joseph is here in this place.

338
00:22:35,179 --> 00:22:40,179
And the Bible says that he, Joseph, served him, Potiphar.

339
00:22:41,139 --> 00:22:43,179
I want you to think about that.

340
00:22:43,179 --> 00:22:45,740
Sometimes when circumstances don't go the way

341
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,539
that we'd like for them to go,

342
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:50,740
I think this evening we could say for Joseph,

343
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:53,740
if we were to look at it strictly from a human.

344
00:22:53,740 --> 00:23:18,740
Let me change batteries real quick.

345
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:19,940
Sorry, stand by.

346
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,259
This is a commercial.

347
00:23:24,339 --> 00:23:27,139
The people online have no idea what I'm saying.

348
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:28,339
Isn't that hilarious?

349
00:23:30,339 --> 00:23:32,539
They'll know in a second, we'll tell them.

350
00:23:32,539 --> 00:23:34,020
This was just a test for the gym

351
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,820
to see how long these batteries would last

352
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,860
and know that when there's one bar, I gotta change it.

353
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:38,899
Is that better?

354
00:23:38,899 --> 00:23:39,740
Am I on now?

355
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:40,559
Can you hear me?

356
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:41,500
All right, praise the Lord.

357
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,580
I ran out of batteries for the online audience.

358
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:47,380
And so we get that fixed up and back on, praise the Lord.

359
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:49,820
And what was I saying, Holly?

360
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:50,660
You don't know.

361
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:54,460
And the reality is that you let me know

362
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,259
that I ran out of batteries.

363
00:23:56,259 --> 00:23:58,220
But as we look here at this portion of scripture,

364
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,779
we would have a pity party.

365
00:23:59,779 --> 00:24:01,460
We would, woe is me.

366
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:03,419
Have you heard anyone make that kind of statement?

367
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:06,100
Man, they just get all kinds of sideways

368
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,940
and they just wanna give up on life.

369
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:10,820
And we hear this phrase a lot in our society today.

370
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,139
You hear it all the time.

371
00:24:12,139 --> 00:24:14,940
It's not fair.

372
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,579
You ever heard somebody say that?

373
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,899
Guess what I'll say?

374
00:24:18,899 --> 00:24:20,140
Life ain't fair.

375
00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:24,100
Whoever told you life was gonna be fair?

376
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:27,100
If you're looking at it strictly from a human perspective.

377
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,619
Understand how I'm saying that this evening

378
00:24:29,619 --> 00:24:33,220
because the reality is that my God and your God

379
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:36,579
is omniscient and omnipotent and he has a plan

380
00:24:36,579 --> 00:24:38,339
and we know that he's in control.

381
00:24:38,339 --> 00:24:41,299
And so we don't have to run around with this perspective

382
00:24:41,299 --> 00:24:43,540
that's so prevalent in our society today

383
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:45,579
of woe is me and this isn't fair

384
00:24:45,579 --> 00:24:46,980
and can I tell you what happened

385
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:49,899
and we just wanna fold our arms and have a pity party

386
00:24:49,899 --> 00:24:51,339
and do nothing.

387
00:24:52,459 --> 00:24:53,660
Joseph served him.

388
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:58,260
And I would submit to you that he served him cheerfully

389
00:24:59,579 --> 00:25:01,660
and he served him wholeheartedly.

390
00:25:02,579 --> 00:25:03,459
Why?

391
00:25:03,459 --> 00:25:06,100
Because of what he observed in Joseph.

392
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:09,140
There's no way this was the least of his servants.

393
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:12,179
There's no way that Joseph was at the bottom of the list

394
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:13,739
of the one that's always got a problem,

395
00:25:13,739 --> 00:25:14,820
the one that I always have to,

396
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,579
hey, hey, hey, what are you doing?

397
00:25:16,579 --> 00:25:17,660
Come on, let's go, let's go.

398
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:20,859
No, no, no, Joseph was serving cheerfully

399
00:25:20,859 --> 00:25:22,579
and wholeheartedly.

400
00:25:23,859 --> 00:25:24,859
Why do I say that?

401
00:25:24,859 --> 00:25:26,980
Well, the Bible tells us in verse number four

402
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:29,380
that he found grace in his sight.

403
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:32,980
It tells us that he made him, Potiphar made him Joseph,

404
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:36,579
overseer over his house.

405
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:39,220
Now that's a prominent position.

406
00:25:40,459 --> 00:25:43,339
And the Bible goes on to say that he,

407
00:25:43,339 --> 00:25:48,339
in all that he had, he put into his hand.

408
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:51,820
Now that's pretty significant.

409
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:54,380
That's not something that you just do

410
00:25:55,779 --> 00:25:58,100
without making some proper observations

411
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:02,059
as to the character and the integrity of the individual

412
00:26:02,059 --> 00:26:07,059
by whom you would place as being a steward or an overseer.

413
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:09,980
And this man, Potiphar, he puts these things,

414
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:12,220
he found, Joseph found grace in his sight,

415
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,700
he makes him overseer.

416
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,619
Notice the Bible says, and it came to pass

417
00:26:15,619 --> 00:26:18,700
from the time that he had made him overseer in his house.

418
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,660
Notice what the Bible says in verse number five.

419
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:23,100
And over all that he had,

420
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:27,899
that the Lord blessed the Egyptians' house

421
00:26:27,899 --> 00:26:29,820
for Joseph's sake.

422
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,579
Isn't that awesome?

423
00:26:31,579 --> 00:26:34,339
Joseph was so faithful and God's blessing

424
00:26:34,339 --> 00:26:36,339
was so obvious and so evident

425
00:26:36,339 --> 00:26:39,420
that even the house of this Egyptian Potiphar

426
00:26:39,459 --> 00:26:42,339
was blessed because of Joseph.

427
00:26:42,339 --> 00:26:43,980
And the Bible says the blessing of the Lord

428
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:48,980
was upon all that he had in the house and in the field.

429
00:26:52,299 --> 00:26:53,600
Verse number six.

430
00:26:57,019 --> 00:27:02,019
The extent by which Joseph had this place of stewardship

431
00:27:02,059 --> 00:27:05,660
or being overseer, it says that he, speaking of Potiphar,

432
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:10,619
left all that he had in Joseph's hand.

433
00:27:10,619 --> 00:27:11,980
And it says this.

434
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:15,859
And he knew not, ought he had,

435
00:27:15,859 --> 00:27:18,980
save the bread which he did eat.

436
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,420
Now, how many of you would be ready to put

437
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:24,619
that kind of trust and confidence in someone?

438
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:28,140
You'd have to make sure you knew who they were.

439
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,220
You'd have to make sure you understood

440
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:32,059
some things about their character, right?

441
00:27:32,059 --> 00:27:35,660
To the point where he said he didn't even know,

442
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:38,619
he knew not, ought he had,

443
00:27:38,619 --> 00:27:41,339
save the bread which he did eat.

444
00:27:42,339 --> 00:27:44,540
He committed it all to Joseph.

445
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:45,899
Why?

446
00:27:45,899 --> 00:27:47,299
Because Joseph was faithful.

447
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:50,100
Because Joseph was trustworthy.

448
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,339
Because Joseph was a man of integrity.

449
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:55,459
But remember why Joseph is there.

450
00:27:55,459 --> 00:27:58,140
And remember that Joseph is in this position

451
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:01,059
and he's been promoted to being overseer

452
00:28:01,059 --> 00:28:03,940
over the house of Potiphar, this man.

453
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:06,459
And the Bible concludes in the end of verse number six

454
00:28:06,459 --> 00:28:10,459
that Joseph was a goodly person and well-favored.

455
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:16,459
We see the blessing of God in the life of Joseph.

456
00:28:16,459 --> 00:28:18,820
I want you to look at a couple of New Testament principles

457
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:21,140
as we think about Joseph's behavior

458
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:23,140
in this position as being a servant

459
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:25,299
that was promoted to being an overseer.

460
00:28:25,299 --> 00:28:27,700
It's in the book of Ephesians, if you will.

461
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:28,739
And we'll look at Ephesians

462
00:28:28,739 --> 00:28:31,579
and Colossians sister passages of Scripture

463
00:28:31,579 --> 00:28:34,020
that really give the same truth

464
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,340
with a little different perspective on it.

465
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,900
And I think it's important that we look at both aspects

466
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:42,299
this evening of what's given to the church in Ephesus

467
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:44,140
and also the church in Colossae

468
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:48,500
when we consider this position, Joseph the overseer.

469
00:28:49,619 --> 00:28:52,400
He was purchased as a slave, as a servant.

470
00:28:54,419 --> 00:28:56,739
He did not have the whole canon of Scripture

471
00:28:56,739 --> 00:28:58,539
like you and I have.

472
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,219
Amen.

473
00:29:00,219 --> 00:29:02,739
In fact, he didn't even have the book of Genesis, right?

474
00:29:02,739 --> 00:29:05,900
I mean, he only had whatever had been passed down

475
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,880
from Adam and Abraham and so on and so forth.

476
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,859
And we find that Genesis,

477
00:29:10,859 --> 00:29:14,340
the book that we're studying here this evening

478
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:17,659
is recording his life written by Moses

479
00:29:17,659 --> 00:29:22,059
at some time way in the future from this particular event.

480
00:29:22,059 --> 00:29:24,739
And we find here that Joseph, however,

481
00:29:24,739 --> 00:29:29,739
was living a life that is consistent with biblical truth

482
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:32,140
that you and I have the privilege

483
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,580
of being able to study and be aware of.

484
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:37,659
Notice in Ephesians chapter number six,

485
00:29:37,659 --> 00:29:40,739
in Ephesians six and beginning in verse number five,

486
00:29:40,739 --> 00:29:42,419
notice what the Bible says.

487
00:29:42,419 --> 00:29:46,619
Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters

488
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:50,179
according to the flesh with fear and trembling

489
00:29:50,179 --> 00:29:51,919
in singleness of your heart.

490
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:55,840
Notice these words as unto Christ.

491
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,960
Now we so much this evening do not have a servant.

492
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:04,960
master type of relationship as Joseph did in Genesis 39.

493
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:09,000
He's promoted to being overseer,

494
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,200
but you'll see as the chapter progresses,

495
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,580
he's still a servant.

496
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:17,160
There was no place for him to even give a defense

497
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,600
when the accusation was brought forth.

498
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,800
Why he's still looked at as being a servant.

499
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,560
He's promoted as overseer,

500
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,400
but notice we don't have that servant master relationship

501
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,320
so often today in our society.

502
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,120
I've often looked at this portion,

503
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,320
the one in Colossians and dealing with the subject

504
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:36,740
of really an employer, employee type relationship

505
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:39,280
and understanding principles that would be applicable

506
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,520
to us today in our lives.

507
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,600
And notice that phrase at the end of verse number five,

508
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,120
as unto Christ.

509
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:52,120
Verse number six, not with I service as men pleasers,

510
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,920
but as the servants of Christ.

511
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,760
Notice the Bible says,

512
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:58,480
doing the will of God from the heart.

513
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,200
Anyone, don't say it out loud,

514
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,560
I'm not gonna get you up here and tell me names or anything,

515
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,400
but any of you ever work with anyone

516
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:10,800
that would be a man pleaser that would do a task

517
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,760
with I service?

518
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,880
What do you mean by that?

519
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,760
Someone that all of a sudden, the boss is coming

520
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,280
and they're going to look very dutiful

521
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,200
in doing what they're supposed to do, why?

522
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,340
Because the boss is here.

523
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:26,160
You've heard the phraseology, the terminology

524
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:30,520
that we'll use that idiom that when the cat's away,

525
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,800
what is it?

526
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,200
The mice will play, right?

527
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,200
You've heard that.

528
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,920
You've heard people say something like this,

529
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,680
it's good enough for government work.

530
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,840
That's not real popular here in Northern Virginia

531
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,680
because a whole lot of folks are government employees,

532
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,620
but you've heard the phrase, no doubt.

533
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:48,640
And some people would have that idea of mailing it in

534
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,320
and just kind of doing enough to get by.

535
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,880
No, that's not how God's people should work.

536
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:00,800
The Bible says that we do it as unto Christ.

537
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:05,120
The Bible says not with I service as men pleasers,

538
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,440
but as the servants of Christ doing the will of God

539
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,280
from the heart.

540
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:11,800
As I look at Joseph and I look at his testimony

541
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,880
in Genesis 39 verses one through six,

542
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,760
Joseph the overseer, I see that he's a man

543
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,720
that was doing the will of God from the heart.

544
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,120
He was serving the Lord.

545
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,280
He was understanding.

546
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:25,960
Listen, the circumstances that led to him being

547
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:29,160
in the house of Potiphar were outside of his control,

548
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,080
but he was gonna still live for God.

549
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,600
Sometimes the employer that you have

550
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,120
may not be the employer you wish you had.

551
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,560
Trying to choose my words carefully.

552
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,760
But if God has you in that place,

553
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,260
he has you there for a reason.

554
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:56,320
And you know God's people, Christians,

555
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:00,040
ought to be the hardest working people on the job.

556
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:05,840
We ought to have a testimony of being a hardworking person.

557
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,680
Why?

558
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,000
We do it as unto Christ.

559
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,360
We're not trying to just be men pleasers.

560
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:13,000
We're not just gonna act the part when the boss comes around.

561
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,040
Listen, if Joseph behaved that way,

562
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,760
I don't believe he would ever be promoted

563
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,320
to being overseer.

564
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,180
He never would be promoted to having

565
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:22,600
all of that responsibility that he had,

566
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,720
that Potiphar was willing to place all of those things

567
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,680
into the hands of Joseph.

568
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,820
Not a chance.

569
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,840
We find that the Bible tells us,

570
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:35,120
look over at the book of Colossians, if you will,

571
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:38,200
in chapter number three, same truth.

572
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:42,000
We'll see that there's a little different aspect

573
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,560
that's given that I think is important for us to understand

574
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,640
with regard to this subject matter.

575
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,880
In Colossians three and verse 22,

576
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,820
servants obey in all things your masters

577
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:52,660
according to the flesh.

578
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:55,200
Notice again, not with eye service as men pleasers,

579
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,720
but in singleness of heart, fearing God.

580
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,600
And then a verse that we're familiar with

581
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:05,600
in verse number 23, and whatsoever ye do, do it heartily.

582
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:11,520
Now, I used the phrase earlier that Joseph served him

583
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,680
as we find in the text of Scripture.

584
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:17,620
And I said this, that I believe that Joseph served him

585
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,860
cheerfully, and I said that I believe

586
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:22,180
he served him wholeheartedly.

587
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:24,100
And here we read that the Bible says,

588
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:27,840
whatsoever ye do, do it heartily.

589
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:34,060
You ever experience someone that's all in, that's working?

590
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:38,360
I mean, they're putting every ounce of effort into it.

591
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,580
They're doing it heartily.

592
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:44,160
I mean, not just trying to get by with the minimum.

593
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,840
They're doing it heartily.

594
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:50,360
And the Bible says this, in verse number 23,

595
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:54,400
notice the reason that these truths are given

596
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:59,400
to the people of God, that we do it as to the Lord,

597
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,960
and not unto men.

598
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,400
You know what happens sometimes?

599
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,940
Our perspective is wrong.

600
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,920
Sometimes our vision is blurred,

601
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,840
if I could use that terminology.

602
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,880
Sometimes, if we're not careful,

603
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,080
we think that we're working for this employer,

604
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:21,840
when as a child of God, we're really working for the Lord.

605
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:27,200
Listen, if Joseph is focused on Potiphar,

606
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,080
it's gonna be a whole lot more challenging

607
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,580
than if he's focused on God.

608
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,000
But when we're focused on God,

609
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,320
and we understand that we're doing whatsoever we're doing,

610
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,840
as to the Lord, and not unto men,

611
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:45,000
all of a sudden, our vision becomes clear,

612
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,360
and we no longer have that difficulty.

613
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,200
Why?

614
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,720
Because I'm focused on doing this for God.

615
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:57,920
And we begin to think about this truth, and this aspect,

616
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,960
and we think about it with regard to our service

617
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:05,280
for the Lord, and whatever place that we find ourselves in,

618
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,340
that we're doing it as unto the Lord.

619
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:09,420
When I was a Bible college student,

620
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:11,220
I remember having a job,

621
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:13,260
and I worked for Payless Shoe Store,

622
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,820
and some of you would remember that place,

623
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,220
it's not around anymore,

624
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:19,260
and we had all kinds of fun little statements about Payless,

625
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,380
and I probably know all of them,

626
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:24,260
and so I enjoyed being able to work there.

627
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:26,220
It paid my way through college.

628
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,900
But I remember making a recommendation

629
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:33,580
to the district supervisor with regard to hiring

630
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,900
another college student.

631
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,660
And they hired that college student

632
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:44,120
based upon my recommendation, and really, my work ethic.

633
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,540
No one would even know who the,

634
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,580
I don't even know if Holly would know

635
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:50,820
who the individual is,

636
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,940
but that individual went to work at Payless,

637
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:56,220
and was terrible worker.

638
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,060
I mean, terrible.

639
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:05,040
To the point that he got fired, and it looked bad on me.

640
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:09,380
And here's what the district supervisor,

641
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:11,660
the supervisor that hired the individual,

642
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,300
I don't want any more recommendations

643
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,920
of anyone from that place.

644
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,580
They began to have this perspective,

645
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:19,660
Christians are the worst people to hire.

646
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,540
I wouldn't wanna hire a Christian.

647
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,420
These are the words that I heard.

648
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,340
I've heard people in other contexts make that statement.

649
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:31,100
I've heard people that have rented out houses,

650
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,540
and have been taken advantage of,

651
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:34,620
not by lost people, but by Christians,

652
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,140
fellow church members.

653
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,700
It ought not be.

654
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:42,820
In reality, the truth is that the believer,

655
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:46,780
the Christian, oughta have that reputation

656
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:51,180
as being the hardest working person on the job, why?

657
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:53,180
Because they're doing it as unto the Lord.

658
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:56,380
And this evening, as we look at Joseph the overseer,

659
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:59,380
and we look at this perspective in these first six verses

660
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:01,460
of Genesis chapter number 39,

661
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:03,700
we see that God is with him.

662
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:07,580
I hope this evening that we are aware

663
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,820
of God's presence in our life.

664
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,800
I hope that we understand this evening

665
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:16,800
that I can't go anywhere without the Lord.

666
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,540
It's comforting, it's convicting.

667
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:23,820
I hope this evening that there are some people

668
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:26,920
that you work with, that you live by,

669
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,460
that you come in contact with,

670
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,780
that could look at your life and could look at my life

671
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:36,700
and say, the Lord is with them, the Lord's with them.

672
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:39,380
They may not say it exactly that way.

673
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:42,179
They may say, there's something different about that person.

674
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:44,420
And they don't know what it is,

675
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:46,380
they can't quite put their thumb on it,

676
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:47,920
that it's the Lord is with them,

677
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,820
but they can look and they can say,

678
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:52,460
something's different about that person.

679
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:54,059
What's different about you?

680
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:59,740
The Lord is my savior.

681
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:04,740
And listen, I don't work based upon the work ethic

682
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,980
of the culture in which I live

683
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:11,980
and the coworkers that I have.

684
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:14,440
No, I'm working as under the Lord.

685
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:20,740
By the way, when you do that, you please the Lord,

686
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:22,460
but you will face some backlash.

687
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:25,760
You have some other employees, coworkers,

688
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,580
that will maybe poke fun at,

689
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:30,179
why do you do all of these things

690
00:39:30,179 --> 00:39:33,619
and you're just trying to blah, blah, blah, whatever.

691
00:39:33,619 --> 00:39:35,260
No, we do it under the Lord.

692
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:40,580
I wonder this evening, the perspective that we have

693
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:43,980
with regard to the duties that God gives us.

694
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:46,100
And when we find ourselves in a position,

695
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:48,900
even as Joseph found himself in this position

696
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,500
in the house of Potiphar,

697
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,340
with some events and circumstances

698
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:54,300
that were outside of his control,

699
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,100
that he was a man that I believe,

700
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,540
as we look at the text of scripture,

701
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:59,940
served cheerfully in.

702
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:05,740
wholeheartedly. Oh, that God would help us. I would tell you this evening, and I think

703
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:10,420
for most of you, I know you well enough that you would tell me as well, that really nothing

704
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:16,020
has happened in my life or in your life that's as bad as what happened to Joseph in Genesis

705
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:25,260
37. But Joseph still kept a perspective that was God-honoring and allowed him to get in

706
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:32,220
the house of Potiphar and have a shining testimony for the Lord. As we continue studying through

707
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:37,860
Genesis 39, we'll find Joseph not only as the overseer, but we'll see Joseph as the

708
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:43,220
accused. And we'll notice that even in that portion of Scripture, that Joseph kept his

709
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:49,540
eyes on God and Joseph did what was right. This evening, I hope that God would help us

710
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:55,380
to gain this perspective of Joseph as the overseer and take some of these principles

711
00:40:55,380 --> 00:41:01,740
and apply them in our lives that we, too, might have the blessing and favor of God upon

712
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:07,740
our lives. Listen, God's blessing and favor doesn't come by accident. It doesn't come

713
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:16,060
by random chance. It comes as we humbly follow the Lord in obedience to His Word. And God's

714
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:24,740
blessing and God's favor is in our lives. Let me say this before we close. Not everything

715
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:31,860
that we look at in life as a blessing is truly a blessing. There are some things that you

716
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:35,660
could look at as a blessing that really could be a curse. And there are some things that

717
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:41,580
you could look at in life that you might think is a curse that's really a blessing. Our ways

718
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:49,319
are not His ways. Amen? His thoughts are not our thoughts. He transcends us. And sometimes

719
00:41:49,319 --> 00:41:56,180
if we're not careful, we have the perspective of our society when we're looking at and seeking

720
00:41:56,180 --> 00:42:03,380
to evaluate blessings and cursings, but we need to have God's perspective to understand

721
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:09,380
what's taking place. I'm so thankful that our God is a good God. He desires that we'd

722
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:16,460
walk with Him and that we'd serve Him. And He will bless as we walk in obedience to Him.

723
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:19,979
Let's pray together. Father, we love You. We thank You for loving us. We thank You for

724
00:42:19,979 --> 00:42:26,619
Your Word. Thank You for the example of Joseph. And as we see Joseph in these first few verses

725
00:42:26,619 --> 00:42:33,660
of Genesis 39 as the overseer, we're convicted by the testimony that Joseph has even in the

726
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:41,100
midst of all the circumstances that surround his being in this place. And God, I pray that

727
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:47,380
You'd help us to lift our eyes unto Thee. Lord, help us to have a proper biblical perspective

728
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:52,540
with regard to the place where You have us, to those circumstances that have brought us

729
00:42:52,540 --> 00:43:00,820
to the place that we are. Help us, Lord, to serve You. Lord, as unto Christ, not unto

730
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:07,139
men. Help us in our daily work as we find ourselves wherever we find ourselves that

731
00:43:07,139 --> 00:43:12,979
what we do is for You, Lord. Help us to have that perspective. Help us, Lord, to live our

732
00:43:12,979 --> 00:43:18,419
lives in such a way that Your blessing and Your favor would be upon us. And God, I pray

733
00:43:18,419 --> 00:43:24,580
that others would see it. Just as Potiphar observed the life of Joseph and saw that the

734
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:29,339
Lord was with him, I pray that others as they observe our lives would see that there's something

735
00:43:29,339 --> 00:43:34,660
different about us and that that difference is Christ. Would You move and work in these

736
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:39,100
moments of invitation? Lord, help us to be doers of the Word and not hearers only. And

737
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:41,940
we'll thank You for it. In Christ's name we pray.
