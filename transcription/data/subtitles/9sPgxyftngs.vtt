00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
chapter number 39 this evening, Genesis chapter number 39.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
And if you look there and hold your place and turn back

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
to chapter number 37, I'll read just a couple of verses by way of

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
introduction from the 37th chapter. You remember chapter 38

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
almost serves as a parenthetical, if you will, dealing with the

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
situation there with Judah and Tamar. We looked at that in a

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
previous message, but it's been since chapter 37 that we looked at the life

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
of Joseph. And as we looked at that passage at the end of chapter

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
number 37, in fact, as we look there, that was all

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
the way back on July the 16th. And so it's August 20th

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
today. And so it's been several weeks since we've studied the latter part of

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Genesis chapter 37. Remember, it was in that passage of scripture that

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Jacob had given Joseph the responsibility to go and to check

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
on his brothers. And his brothers decided that they were going to kill him. And then they

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
thought that, well, instead of killing him, we'll sell him to be a

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
slave and they'll be able to make some money. And we find that

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
they did just that. And as you note at the end of the chapter, they come

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
back to their father, Jacob, and they bring that coat of many colors,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
which was so obvious as to who that belonged to. Of course,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Jacob gave that to Joseph. And as they

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
give this coat that they had dipped in the blood of a kid of

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
the goats that they killed, they said, this have we found. Know now

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
whether it be thy son's coat or no. At that particular time,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
according to verse number 33, at the end of the verse, Jacob reached the

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
conclusion that I think the boys hoped that they would reach, that he would

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
reach, and that is that Joseph is without doubt rent in

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
pieces. He believed that Joseph was dead. But in

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
fact, Joseph was not dead. He was on his way to Egypt to become a

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
slave. And the Bible tells us in verse number 36, the Midianites

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
sold him, Joseph, into Egypt unto Potiphar,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
an officer of Pharaoh's and captain of the guard.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
As you begin verse number 1 of chapter 39, you read basically the same

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
statement where the Bible says that Joseph was brought down to Egypt

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmaelites,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
which had brought him down thither.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
The Bible says that the Lord was with Joseph, and he was a

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
prosperous man, and he was in the house of his master,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
the Egyptian. This evening as we look at this portion of

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Scripture, the dialogue of Genesis chapter number 39 actually

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
reads pretty quickly. As you get into the chapter and you see what's going on,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
it reads very quickly. However,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
I want to point out for us this evening, by way of introduction to this particular

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
chapter, that we would understand that the events that are recorded in Genesis

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
39 really don't happen quickly. The events in Genesis

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
chapter number 39 that Joseph served with

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Potiphar before the accusation of Potiphar's wife

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
and all of those things, he served there for about 10 years.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
And the reason that we know that, if you consider and just follow along with

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
this line of reasoning by way of introduction, again, it's just so

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
that we can understand his faithful service and that it was a lengthy time in

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
which he was there. According to Genesis chapter number 37, when we're first

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
introduced to Joseph, he's 17 years old. And we find

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
that those events go very quickly there with regard to

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
what's recorded in chapter 37. And then we find in Genesis chapter number

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
41, after the dreams of Pharaoh, and

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
they call for Joseph, Pharaoh calls for

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Joseph, and Joseph interprets the dreams and he provides him with

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
counsel after the interpretation. And we find that Pharaoh says

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
this is the one that we need to set in a place of leadership. And the

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Bible tells us in Genesis 41 and verse 46 that Joseph was

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
30 years old when he stood before Pharaoh, king of Egypt.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
And so we see that we would go from 17 to 30, from

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
chapter number 37 to chapter number 41, and we know that

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
within that period of time, Joseph was forgotten in prison

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
for two full years. According to Genesis 41 and verse

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
number 1, after he'd interpreted the dreams of the butler and the baker,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
we find that he says to the butler, remember me,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
and the butler forgot him, and it says that it was two

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
full years, and then that's when Pharaoh dreamed

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
a dream. And so as you look at this, some Bible scholars would say that it's as

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
much as 13 years that he would serve there. I think when you look at the calculations,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
no doubt I think a conservative estimate would

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
be that Joseph was serving in the house of Potiphar for at least

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
10 years. Now, when you read Genesis chapter number 39, you may

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
not get that when you're just reading through it because it goes very quickly

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
as to what's taking place. Understand that Joseph did not

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
become the overseer to have the

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
position that he did after just one week of working for Potiphar.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
He was a slave that was purchased, and so there's a period of time,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
a process that goes through, and we find that Joseph is in that place.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
We've titled the message this evening, as you look at the bulletin there,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
the Lord was with Joseph, and I want to point out, as we look at Genesis

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
39, the statements that are made. We read verse number 2 already. Notice

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
the Bible says, and the Lord was with Joseph. Notice in

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
verse number 3, the Bible says, and his master, that's Potiphar, saw

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
that the Lord was with him. We'll come back to that thought here in just a moment as we get

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
into the message, and the Bible says that the Lord made all that he did to

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
prosper in his hand. Skip down, if you will, and look at verse number 21.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
This is after the accusation and the imprisonment, and now Joseph

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
finds himself in prison, and the Bible says in verse number 21, but

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
the Lord was with Joseph, and showed him mercy and gave

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison. Again, in verse 23,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
the Bible says that the keeper of the prison looked not to anything that was under his hand.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Why? Because the Lord was with him, and that which he did,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
the Lord made it to prosper. We see four times in really

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
a short period of time looking, as far as Bible

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
verses are concerned, 23 verses. You could read chapter 39

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
in just a few minutes, and that's just at a really leisurely

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
type of rate, and you read it in just a few minutes, and you find that

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
on four occasions, God points out to us the Holy Spirit of

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
God through the inspiration. We

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
find that four times the human penman writes that the

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Lord was with Joseph. Now that's precious to me.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Why? Because the Lord's with us. He's with us.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
See, we can begin to look at the passage of Scripture, and we can

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
see when Joseph is there in the house of Potiphar,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
and he's made an overseer, and he has this position, even though

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
he's a servant, he attains this position, and he's working, and so on and so

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
forth, and we can say, okay, I can see the Lord with Joseph there.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
But then Joseph is in prison after being falsely accused.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
And even there, the Bible reminds us that the Lord is with

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
him. The Lord is with him. I would submit to you that even though the

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Holy Scripture does not tell us in these words

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
in chapter number 37, while Joseph was down in that pit,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000
God was with him. The Lord was with him.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
See, this evening we have this wonderful promise from the book of Hebrews in the 13th

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
chapter, where the Bible says that God will never

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
leave us nor forsake us. Isn't that a wonderful

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Bible truth? It is a, it's said, I read

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
this years ago, that a preacher was preaching and made a comment about

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
that verse of Scripture and about it being a wonderful promise, and an elderly

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
saint of God interrupted the preacher and said, preacher, it's more than a promise,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
it's a reality. And I'm thankful for that, amen? It's

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
definitely a promise, but it's a reality in our lives that the Lord is with us.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
And as we begin to think about that and using that as the title for our message this evening,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
I find that the truth that God is with us and the truth of how

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
the Lord was with Joseph, and Joseph was living in the

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000
presence of God. See, the reality this evening

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
is that the Lord is with us whether we live every day aware

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
of that truth or not. What do I mean by that? Well,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
every day of your life you can live being aware,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000
keenly aware of the fact that the Lord is with you.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
And I would submit to you that as we live that way, that it will impact the way that we live

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
our lives. Why? Because the Lord is with us.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
I would say that we can go through life and sometimes get busy

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000
and get distracted and maybe not really be mindful

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
of the fact, not that we've forgotten the truth, but not

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
really live in the presence of God.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
And we find this evening that the truth of this

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
statement that we read four times in this single chapter of

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
God's Word would reveal to us, and I believe that it impacts

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
us to understand there's great comfort in this truth.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
God's with us. What did the psalmist say in Psalm 23?

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
no evil. Why? For thou art

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
with me. Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
me. And we find that the truth of God's

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
presence and being in, that the Lord is

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
with us and He's with us everywhere we go, it brings comfort.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:08.000
It really does. I'm so thankful that every place we go, we go with the Lord.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.000
It's comforting. Remember the truth of Jesus giving the Great Commission in Matthew 28,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000
the way that it's recorded there, and lo, I am with you always.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Right? That's the promise that He gives at the end of the Great Commission,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
as we often refer to it as in Matthew 28, 18 through 20.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:32.000
And lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. Amen.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:38.000
This evening, that truth, as comforting as it is, I believe this evening is also a convicting truth.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
The Lord is with us.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
You know, there are certain things that we do in life as human beings.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
There are tendencies that we have, and there are certain things that we will do,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
and there are certain things that we will not do based upon whose presence we're in.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Have you ever found that to be the case?

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.000
And we find that as we live life and we think about observing the behavior of children,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000
oftentimes we can see that children may behave a certain way in the presence of their parents,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000
while they may behave a different way in the absence of their parents.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
I have found, and no doubt you have found as well,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:18.000
that there's an amazing impact that takes place on the highways of America

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:24.000
when there is the presence of a state trooper, a state police officer, a county police officer,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
a sheriff or whomever it might be.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:34.000
There is an impact that the presence of that particular vehicle has on those driving around you.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
Have you seen it to be the case? Absolutely.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000
I'm driving down the road, many times it's happened, and I'm going the speed limit.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
I'm not breaking the law, and I'm driving,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000
and all of a sudden there's a police officer up ahead and people are slamming on their brakes,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
and they're slowing down, and they're not even going the speed limit.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
And I say something like this, you're at least allowed to drive the speed limit.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Don't mind the fact that there's a police officer there.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
Like, you can still drive.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
But what happens? Why do they hit their brakes?

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Well, for many of them, it's because they're speeding.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
They don't want to get a ticket.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:17.000
So the presence of that law enforcement officer has an impact on the behavior.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
And this evening, listen, when we live in the presence of God,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
I believe that's why we read Genesis 39 the way that we do.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.000
There's a great contrast between Genesis 39 and Genesis 38.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:35.000
You understand this evening that Judah and Joseph are brothers.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Their behavior, as is recorded in Genesis 38, and their behavior, as is recorded in Genesis 39, is so opposite.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000
And I believe that a key is the fact that the Bible tells us that Joseph was living,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000
he understood, he was aware of the presence of God Almighty.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:03.000
Understand with me that even as Joseph would live in a foreign land, in pagan territory,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
that Joseph understood the presence of God.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Whither can I flee from his presence?

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
What's the answer? I can't. I can't. I can't.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
And by the way, that's comforting, and it's convicting.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Though Joseph was sold into slavery, though he finds himself in Egypt land,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
in a place that's idolatrous, polytheistic,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000
we find that Joseph was living in the very presence of God.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:34.000
As we look at this chapter this evening, I want you to notice in the first several verses of Genesis 39,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
number one, notice with me, Joseph the overseer.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Joseph the overseer.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
The Bible says in verse number two,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
And the Lord was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
The Bible says that his master saw that the Lord was with him,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
and that the Lord made all that he did to prosper in his hand.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000
and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000
And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.000
and over all that he had, that the Lord blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000
and the blessing of the Lord was upon all that he had in the house and in the field.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.000
And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand, and knew not aught he had,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
save the bread which he did eat, and Joseph was a goodly person,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
and well favored.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000
In these first six verses of Genesis 39, we see Joseph as the overseer.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
I believe that as you look at this particular passage of Scripture,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
you begin to see Joseph in this position,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
that Joseph is walking with the Lord,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.000
that Joseph is living according to the principles by which he had been taught.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000
And we've already looked at some things with regard to the character of Joseph

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
in previous messages,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000
and we find that the Bible tells us that the Lord was with Joseph in verse number two,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
but I want you to notice the statement in verse number three,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000
when the Bible says that his master saw that the Lord was with him.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
Isn't that an interesting statement?

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:08.000
As you would think about Potiphar observing the life and the behavior of Joseph,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.000
and Joseph a man that was living for and walking with the Lord his God,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
the Bible tells us that the Lord is with him and that he was a prosperous man,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000
and now we find that the Bible says that Potiphar, this Egyptian man,

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000
this man that was an officer of Pharaoh, he was captain of the guard,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:32.000
he recognizes, he sees in Joseph that this was a man that the Lord was with.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
That's impactful.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000
It's important for us to understand as we look at this particular truth

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
and think about the observation that Pharaoh makes,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
and looking at the life and the behavior,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000
and looking at the blessings, he reaches this conclusion that the Lord was with him,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000
and I wonder this evening that as we think about the life of Joseph,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:58.000
and as even we would examine our own lives, I wonder if others can see that the Lord is with us.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
I wonder this evening how many people would look at your life and look at my life

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.000
and say the Lord is with them.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Hold your place here and turn to the book of Acts in the fourth chapter, if you will,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.000
and notice what the Bible tells us, a passage that many of us would be familiar with this evening,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
but in Acts chapter number four, as we look at this portion of Scripture

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000
and look at Peter standing up filled with the Holy Spirit of God,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000
speaking and giving answer to these religious leaders

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000
in the early days of the church being established,

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:36.000
we find that Peter gets up and he's filled with the Holy Ghost according to verse number eight,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
and in Acts chapter number four, the Bible tells us that he's really giving this message.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Notice he says in verse number nine,

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000
if we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000
by what means he has made whole, be it known unto you all and to all the people of Israel

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000
that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom he crucified,

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000
whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.000
This is the stone which was set at Nott of you builders, which has become the head of the corner.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000
In verse number 12, he makes it very, very plain to these religious leaders,

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.000
neither is there salvation in any other, for there is none other name under heaven

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.000
given among men whereby we must be saved.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
Notice verse 13, though.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
The Bible says, now when they, that's the religious leaders,

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:32.000
those that had questioned the actions of and are examining the disciples,

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000
the Bible says that when they saw the boldness of Peter and John

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:41.000
and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marveled.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:47.000
Notice what the Bible says, they took knowledge of them that they had been with Jesus.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:54.000
Listen, I believe this evening that you, if you spend time with the Lord, it's going to be obvious.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000
It's going to be evident, it's going to come out, so to speak.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
Does that make sense this evening?

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:07.000
And we think about the truth of Joseph living in the presence of God and walking with the Lord,

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:14.000
and this Egyptian man, this man that is in this culture and in this society

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:20.000
that's a polytheistic, idolatrous nation, we find that he makes this statement

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:27.000
and he says that he saw that the Lord was with him.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:36.000
We find that as Joseph is living there in Egypt, as he's serving there in Potiphar's house,

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000
that Potiphar makes this observation, notice the end of verse number three,

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:46.000
and the Bible says that the Lord made all that he did to prosper in his hand.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:53.000
Understand with me this evening that this is not something that just happened by chance.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:19:00.000
There is a biblical truth, principle, that is established throughout God's word,

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:07.000
and that is that God's blessing and a favor is upon them that walk uprightly.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000
Those in whom God delights.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:16.000
I understand that the New Testament tells us that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance,

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:23.000
and that is a biblical truth that we understand within the context of that truth that is being given,

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:31.000
but I would say, broadly speaking, God's blessing and God's favor is upon those who walk with God.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000
Amen?

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000
The Bible tells us later in the book of Deuteronomy, in the 11th chapter,

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
that Moses is standing before the children of Israel, and he says to them,

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000
I give you this day a blessing and a curse.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:51.000
And we find here that the Bible says that the Lord made all that he did to prosper in his hand.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:58.000
Understand that it was not that Joseph was somehow just, man, he's just, everything he touches is gold.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000
You ever hear somebody use that phraseology?

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.980
It seems like everything they touch is just gold.

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:06.820
How about they just walk with God and God's blessing them?

00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:10.619
And we see here with Joseph that as we look at his life

00:20:10.619 --> 00:20:13.939
and we look at the observation of this man Potiphar,

00:20:13.939 --> 00:20:17.899
that he says, I see his master saw that the Lord was

00:20:17.899 --> 00:20:22.180
with him and that the Lord made all that he did

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:23.860
to prosper in his hand.

00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:27.100
In Deuteronomy 11, when the Bible speaks about that blessing

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:31.819
and that curse, it makes it abundantly clear as to the way

00:20:31.819 --> 00:20:34.939
by which we can receive either the blessing of the curse,

00:20:34.939 --> 00:20:37.380
a blessing if you obey the commandments of the Lord,

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:38.700
your God, which I command you this day,

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:41.340
and a curse if you will not obey the commandments

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:44.340
of the Lord, your God.

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:47.419
This evening, as we look at Joseph, the overseer,

00:20:47.419 --> 00:20:49.799
and as we look at this life of Joseph,

00:20:49.799 --> 00:20:54.380
and we look at the observation of the master of Potiphar

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:57.779
and what he observed and what he saw in the life of Joseph,

00:20:57.779 --> 00:21:00.139
Joseph was a man that was walking with God

00:21:01.299 --> 00:21:04.540
and had God's favor upon his life.

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:06.639
Listen, this evening, do you want the blessing of God

00:21:06.639 --> 00:21:08.059
in your life?

00:21:08.059 --> 00:21:10.500
You want God's favor in your life?

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:12.019
I do.

00:21:12.019 --> 00:21:14.080
I desire God's blessing in my life.

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:16.900
I desire God's favor.

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:21.900
I want God to be pleased with me, to delight in us.

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:25.860
And we find this evening that Joseph is in that position.

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:28.540
Notice that the result of this in verse number four,

00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:32.980
the Bible says, and Joseph found grace in his sight.

00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:36.059
And it says that he served him.

00:21:37.099 --> 00:21:40.339
I want you to think about that statement just for a moment

00:21:40.339 --> 00:21:42.540
and think about where Joseph is.

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:45.120
Think about the circumstances that have led

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:48.139
to Joseph being in this place as being a slave,

00:21:48.139 --> 00:21:51.879
a servant in the house of Potiphar.

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:55.040
He simply obeyed the commandment of his father

00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:59.000
when his father said, go and check on your brothers.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.860
Back in Genesis 37, we've studied through that portion

00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:03.440
of scripture in previous weeks.

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:07.059
And we find that Joseph was simply obedient to that

00:22:07.059 --> 00:22:08.520
which he had been told to do.

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:11.000
And he finds himself as soon as he arrives,

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.320
remember the brothers see him as he's coming

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:16.559
from a distance, that coat of many colors was a distinction.

00:22:16.559 --> 00:22:19.740
And we find that they begin to conspire against him.

00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:23.500
As soon as he arrives in their presence,

00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:26.020
they're stripping him out of that coat of many colors

00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:27.619
and they put him in that pit

00:22:27.619 --> 00:22:30.139
and they sell him into slavery.

00:22:31.899 --> 00:22:35.179
Joseph is here in this place.

00:22:35.179 --> 00:22:40.179
And the Bible says that he, Joseph, served him, Potiphar.

00:22:41.139 --> 00:22:43.179
I want you to think about that.

00:22:43.179 --> 00:22:45.740
Sometimes when circumstances don't go the way

00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:47.539
that we'd like for them to go,

00:22:48.539 --> 00:22:50.740
I think this evening we could say for Joseph,

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:53.740
if we were to look at it strictly from a human.

00:22:53.740 --> 00:23:18.740
Let me change batteries real quick.

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:19.940
Sorry, stand by.

00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:22.259
This is a commercial.

00:23:24.339 --> 00:23:27.139
The people online have no idea what I'm saying.

00:23:27.139 --> 00:23:28.339
Isn't that hilarious?

00:23:30.339 --> 00:23:32.539
They'll know in a second, we'll tell them.

00:23:32.539 --> 00:23:34.020
This was just a test for the gym

00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:35.820
to see how long these batteries would last

00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:37.860
and know that when there's one bar, I gotta change it.

00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:38.899
Is that better?

00:23:38.899 --> 00:23:39.740
Am I on now?

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:40.559
Can you hear me?

00:23:40.559 --> 00:23:41.500
All right, praise the Lord.

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:43.580
I ran out of batteries for the online audience.

00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:47.380
And so we get that fixed up and back on, praise the Lord.

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:49.820
And what was I saying, Holly?

00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:50.660
You don't know.

00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:54.460
And the reality is that you let me know

00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:56.259
that I ran out of batteries.

00:23:56.259 --> 00:23:58.220
But as we look here at this portion of scripture,

00:23:58.220 --> 00:23:59.779
we would have a pity party.

00:23:59.779 --> 00:24:01.460
We would, woe is me.

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:03.419
Have you heard anyone make that kind of statement?

00:24:03.419 --> 00:24:06.100
Man, they just get all kinds of sideways

00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:07.940
and they just wanna give up on life.

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:10.820
And we hear this phrase a lot in our society today.

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:12.139
You hear it all the time.

00:24:12.139 --> 00:24:14.940
It's not fair.

00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:16.579
You ever heard somebody say that?

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:18.899
Guess what I'll say?

00:24:18.899 --> 00:24:20.140
Life ain't fair.

00:24:21.179 --> 00:24:24.100
Whoever told you life was gonna be fair?

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:27.100
If you're looking at it strictly from a human perspective.

00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:29.619
Understand how I'm saying that this evening

00:24:29.619 --> 00:24:33.220
because the reality is that my God and your God

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:36.579
is omniscient and omnipotent and he has a plan

00:24:36.579 --> 00:24:38.339
and we know that he's in control.

00:24:38.339 --> 00:24:41.299
And so we don't have to run around with this perspective

00:24:41.299 --> 00:24:43.540
that's so prevalent in our society today

00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:45.579
of woe is me and this isn't fair

00:24:45.579 --> 00:24:46.980
and can I tell you what happened

00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:49.899
and we just wanna fold our arms and have a pity party

00:24:49.899 --> 00:24:51.339
and do nothing.

00:24:52.459 --> 00:24:53.660
Joseph served him.

00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:58.260
And I would submit to you that he served him cheerfully

00:24:59.579 --> 00:25:01.660
and he served him wholeheartedly.

00:25:02.579 --> 00:25:03.459
Why?

00:25:03.459 --> 00:25:06.100
Because of what he observed in Joseph.

00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:09.140
There's no way this was the least of his servants.

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:12.179
There's no way that Joseph was at the bottom of the list

00:25:12.179 --> 00:25:13.739
of the one that's always got a problem,

00:25:13.739 --> 00:25:14.820
the one that I always have to,

00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:16.579
hey, hey, hey, what are you doing?

00:25:16.579 --> 00:25:17.660
Come on, let's go, let's go.

00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:20.859
No, no, no, Joseph was serving cheerfully

00:25:20.859 --> 00:25:22.579
and wholeheartedly.

00:25:23.859 --> 00:25:24.859
Why do I say that?

00:25:24.859 --> 00:25:26.980
Well, the Bible tells us in verse number four

00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:29.380
that he found grace in his sight.

00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:32.980
It tells us that he made him, Potiphar made him Joseph,

00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:36.579
overseer over his house.

00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:39.220
Now that's a prominent position.

00:25:40.459 --> 00:25:43.339
And the Bible goes on to say that he,

00:25:43.339 --> 00:25:48.339
in all that he had, he put into his hand.

00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:51.820
Now that's pretty significant.

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:54.380
That's not something that you just do

00:25:55.779 --> 00:25:58.100
without making some proper observations

00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:02.059
as to the character and the integrity of the individual

00:26:02.059 --> 00:26:07.059
by whom you would place as being a steward or an overseer.

00:26:07.299 --> 00:26:09.980
And this man, Potiphar, he puts these things,

00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:12.220
he found, Joseph found grace in his sight,

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:13.700
he makes him overseer.

00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:15.619
Notice the Bible says, and it came to pass

00:26:15.619 --> 00:26:18.700
from the time that he had made him overseer in his house.

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:20.660
Notice what the Bible says in verse number five.

00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:23.100
And over all that he had,

00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:27.899
that the Lord blessed the Egyptians' house

00:26:27.899 --> 00:26:29.820
for Joseph's sake.

00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:31.579
Isn't that awesome?

00:26:31.579 --> 00:26:34.339
Joseph was so faithful and God's blessing

00:26:34.339 --> 00:26:36.339
was so obvious and so evident

00:26:36.339 --> 00:26:39.420
that even the house of this Egyptian Potiphar

00:26:39.459 --> 00:26:42.339
was blessed because of Joseph.

00:26:42.339 --> 00:26:43.980
And the Bible says the blessing of the Lord

00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:48.980
was upon all that he had in the house and in the field.

00:26:52.299 --> 00:26:53.600
Verse number six.

00:26:57.019 --> 00:27:02.019
The extent by which Joseph had this place of stewardship

00:27:02.059 --> 00:27:05.660
or being overseer, it says that he, speaking of Potiphar,

00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:10.619
left all that he had in Joseph's hand.

00:27:10.619 --> 00:27:11.980
And it says this.

00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:15.859
And he knew not, ought he had,

00:27:15.859 --> 00:27:18.980
save the bread which he did eat.

00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:20.420
Now, how many of you would be ready to put

00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:24.619
that kind of trust and confidence in someone?

00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:28.140
You'd have to make sure you knew who they were.

00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:29.220
You'd have to make sure you understood

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:32.059
some things about their character, right?

00:27:32.059 --> 00:27:35.660
To the point where he said he didn't even know,

00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:38.619
he knew not, ought he had,

00:27:38.619 --> 00:27:41.339
save the bread which he did eat.

00:27:42.339 --> 00:27:44.540
He committed it all to Joseph.

00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:45.899
Why?

00:27:45.899 --> 00:27:47.299
Because Joseph was faithful.

00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:50.100
Because Joseph was trustworthy.

00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:52.339
Because Joseph was a man of integrity.

00:27:52.339 --> 00:27:55.459
But remember why Joseph is there.

00:27:55.459 --> 00:27:58.140
And remember that Joseph is in this position

00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:01.059
and he's been promoted to being overseer

00:28:01.059 --> 00:28:03.940
over the house of Potiphar, this man.

00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:06.459
And the Bible concludes in the end of verse number six

00:28:06.459 --> 00:28:10.459
that Joseph was a goodly person and well-favored.

00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:16.459
We see the blessing of God in the life of Joseph.

00:28:16.459 --> 00:28:18.820
I want you to look at a couple of New Testament principles

00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:21.140
as we think about Joseph's behavior

00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:23.140
in this position as being a servant

00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:25.299
that was promoted to being an overseer.

00:28:25.299 --> 00:28:27.700
It's in the book of Ephesians, if you will.

00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:28.739
And we'll look at Ephesians

00:28:28.739 --> 00:28:31.579
and Colossians sister passages of Scripture

00:28:31.579 --> 00:28:34.020
that really give the same truth

00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:36.340
with a little different perspective on it.

00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:38.900
And I think it's important that we look at both aspects

00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:42.299
this evening of what's given to the church in Ephesus

00:28:42.299 --> 00:28:44.140
and also the church in Colossae

00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:48.500
when we consider this position, Joseph the overseer.

00:28:49.619 --> 00:28:52.400
He was purchased as a slave, as a servant.

00:28:54.419 --> 00:28:56.739
He did not have the whole canon of Scripture

00:28:56.739 --> 00:28:58.539
like you and I have.

00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:00.219
Amen.

00:29:00.219 --> 00:29:02.739
In fact, he didn't even have the book of Genesis, right?

00:29:02.739 --> 00:29:05.900
I mean, he only had whatever had been passed down

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:08.880
from Adam and Abraham and so on and so forth.

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:10.859
And we find that Genesis,

00:29:10.859 --> 00:29:14.340
the book that we're studying here this evening

00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:17.659
is recording his life written by Moses

00:29:17.659 --> 00:29:22.059
at some time way in the future from this particular event.

00:29:22.059 --> 00:29:24.739
And we find here that Joseph, however,

00:29:24.739 --> 00:29:29.739
was living a life that is consistent with biblical truth

00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:32.140
that you and I have the privilege

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:34.580
of being able to study and be aware of.

00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:37.659
Notice in Ephesians chapter number six,

00:29:37.659 --> 00:29:40.739
in Ephesians six and beginning in verse number five,

00:29:40.739 --> 00:29:42.419
notice what the Bible says.

00:29:42.419 --> 00:29:46.619
Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters

00:29:46.619 --> 00:29:50.179
according to the flesh with fear and trembling

00:29:50.179 --> 00:29:51.919
in singleness of your heart.

00:29:51.919 --> 00:29:55.840
Notice these words as unto Christ.

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:59.960
Now we so much this evening do not have a servant.

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:04.960
master type of relationship as Joseph did in Genesis 39.

00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:09.000
He's promoted to being overseer,

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.200
but you'll see as the chapter progresses,

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:12.580
he's still a servant.

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:17.160
There was no place for him to even give a defense

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:19.600
when the accusation was brought forth.

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:22.800
Why he's still looked at as being a servant.

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:24.560
He's promoted as overseer,

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:27.400
but notice we don't have that servant master relationship

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:29.320
so often today in our society.

00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:31.120
I've often looked at this portion,

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:33.320
the one in Colossians and dealing with the subject

00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:36.740
of really an employer, employee type relationship

00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:39.280
and understanding principles that would be applicable

00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:41.520
to us today in our lives.

00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:43.600
And notice that phrase at the end of verse number five,

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:47.120
as unto Christ.

00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:52.120
Verse number six, not with I service as men pleasers,

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:53.920
but as the servants of Christ.

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:54.760
Notice the Bible says,

00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:58.480
doing the will of God from the heart.

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:01.200
Anyone, don't say it out loud,

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:03.560
I'm not gonna get you up here and tell me names or anything,

00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:06.400
but any of you ever work with anyone

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:10.800
that would be a man pleaser that would do a task

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:12.760
with I service?

00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:13.880
What do you mean by that?

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:16.760
Someone that all of a sudden, the boss is coming

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:19.280
and they're going to look very dutiful

00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:21.200
in doing what they're supposed to do, why?

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:23.340
Because the boss is here.

00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:26.160
You've heard the phraseology, the terminology

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:30.520
that we'll use that idiom that when the cat's away,

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:31.800
what is it?

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:33.200
The mice will play, right?

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:34.200
You've heard that.

00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:35.920
You've heard people say something like this,

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:38.680
it's good enough for government work.

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:40.840
That's not real popular here in Northern Virginia

00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:43.680
because a whole lot of folks are government employees,

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:45.620
but you've heard the phrase, no doubt.

00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:48.640
And some people would have that idea of mailing it in

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:52.320
and just kind of doing enough to get by.

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:55.880
No, that's not how God's people should work.

00:31:57.560 --> 00:32:00.800
The Bible says that we do it as unto Christ.

00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:05.120
The Bible says not with I service as men pleasers,

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:07.440
but as the servants of Christ doing the will of God

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:08.280
from the heart.

00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:11.800
As I look at Joseph and I look at his testimony

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:13.880
in Genesis 39 verses one through six,

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:16.760
Joseph the overseer, I see that he's a man

00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:19.720
that was doing the will of God from the heart.

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:21.120
He was serving the Lord.

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:22.280
He was understanding.

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:25.960
Listen, the circumstances that led to him being

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:29.160
in the house of Potiphar were outside of his control,

00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:32.080
but he was gonna still live for God.

00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:36.600
Sometimes the employer that you have

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.120
may not be the employer you wish you had.

00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:44.560
Trying to choose my words carefully.

00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:48.760
But if God has you in that place,

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:50.260
he has you there for a reason.

00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:56.320
And you know God's people, Christians,

00:32:56.320 --> 00:33:00.040
ought to be the hardest working people on the job.

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:05.840
We ought to have a testimony of being a hardworking person.

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:06.680
Why?

00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:08.000
We do it as unto Christ.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.360
We're not trying to just be men pleasers.

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:13.000
We're not just gonna act the part when the boss comes around.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.040
Listen, if Joseph behaved that way,

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:16.760
I don't believe he would ever be promoted

00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:18.320
to being overseer.

00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:20.180
He never would be promoted to having

00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:22.600
all of that responsibility that he had,

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:25.720
that Potiphar was willing to place all of those things

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:27.680
into the hands of Joseph.

00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:28.820
Not a chance.

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:31.840
We find that the Bible tells us,

00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:35.120
look over at the book of Colossians, if you will,

00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:38.200
in chapter number three, same truth.

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:42.000
We'll see that there's a little different aspect

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.560
that's given that I think is important for us to understand

00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:47.640
with regard to this subject matter.

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:49.880
In Colossians three and verse 22,

00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:51.820
servants obey in all things your masters

00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:52.660
according to the flesh.

00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:55.200
Notice again, not with eye service as men pleasers,

00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:57.720
but in singleness of heart, fearing God.

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:00.600
And then a verse that we're familiar with

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:05.600
in verse number 23, and whatsoever ye do, do it heartily.

00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:11.520
Now, I used the phrase earlier that Joseph served him

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:14.680
as we find in the text of Scripture.

00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:17.620
And I said this, that I believe that Joseph served him

00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:19.860
cheerfully, and I said that I believe

00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:22.180
he served him wholeheartedly.

00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:24.100
And here we read that the Bible says,

00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:27.840
whatsoever ye do, do it heartily.

00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:34.060
You ever experience someone that's all in, that's working?

00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:38.360
I mean, they're putting every ounce of effort into it.

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:40.580
They're doing it heartily.

00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:44.160
I mean, not just trying to get by with the minimum.

00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:46.840
They're doing it heartily.

00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:50.360
And the Bible says this, in verse number 23,

00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:54.400
notice the reason that these truths are given

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:59.400
to the people of God, that we do it as to the Lord,

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:03.960
and not unto men.

00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:05.400
You know what happens sometimes?

00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:06.940
Our perspective is wrong.

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:10.920
Sometimes our vision is blurred,

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:12.840
if I could use that terminology.

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:14.880
Sometimes, if we're not careful,

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:18.080
we think that we're working for this employer,

00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:21.840
when as a child of God, we're really working for the Lord.

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:27.200
Listen, if Joseph is focused on Potiphar,

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.080
it's gonna be a whole lot more challenging

00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:32.580
than if he's focused on God.

00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:36.000
But when we're focused on God,

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.320
and we understand that we're doing whatsoever we're doing,

00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:41.840
as to the Lord, and not unto men,

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:45.000
all of a sudden, our vision becomes clear,

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.360
and we no longer have that difficulty.

00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:49.200
Why?

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:52.720
Because I'm focused on doing this for God.

00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:57.920
And we begin to think about this truth, and this aspect,

00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:00.960
and we think about it with regard to our service

00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:05.280
for the Lord, and whatever place that we find ourselves in,

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:07.340
that we're doing it as unto the Lord.

00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:09.420
When I was a Bible college student,

00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:11.220
I remember having a job,

00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:13.260
and I worked for Payless Shoe Store,

00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:14.820
and some of you would remember that place,

00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:16.220
it's not around anymore,

00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:19.260
and we had all kinds of fun little statements about Payless,

00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:21.380
and I probably know all of them,

00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:24.260
and so I enjoyed being able to work there.

00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:26.220
It paid my way through college.

00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:29.900
But I remember making a recommendation

00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:33.580
to the district supervisor with regard to hiring

00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:36.900
another college student.

00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:39.660
And they hired that college student

00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:44.120
based upon my recommendation, and really, my work ethic.

00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:47.540
No one would even know who the,

00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:48.580
I don't even know if Holly would know

00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:50.820
who the individual is,

00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:52.940
but that individual went to work at Payless,

00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:56.220
and was terrible worker.

00:36:57.780 --> 00:36:59.060
I mean, terrible.

00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:05.040
To the point that he got fired, and it looked bad on me.

00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:09.380
And here's what the district supervisor,

00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:11.660
the supervisor that hired the individual,

00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:13.300
I don't want any more recommendations

00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:14.920
of anyone from that place.

00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:17.580
They began to have this perspective,

00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:19.660
Christians are the worst people to hire.

00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:22.540
I wouldn't wanna hire a Christian.

00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:24.420
These are the words that I heard.

00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:28.340
I've heard people in other contexts make that statement.

00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:31.100
I've heard people that have rented out houses,

00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:32.540
and have been taken advantage of,

00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:34.620
not by lost people, but by Christians,

00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:36.140
fellow church members.

00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:38.700
It ought not be.

00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:42.820
In reality, the truth is that the believer,

00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:46.780
the Christian, oughta have that reputation

00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:51.180
as being the hardest working person on the job, why?

00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:53.180
Because they're doing it as unto the Lord.

00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:56.380
And this evening, as we look at Joseph the overseer,

00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:59.380
and we look at this perspective in these first six verses

00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:01.460
of Genesis chapter number 39,

00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:03.700
we see that God is with him.

00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:07.580
I hope this evening that we are aware

00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:09.820
of God's presence in our life.

00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:11.800
I hope that we understand this evening

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:16.800
that I can't go anywhere without the Lord.

00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:19.540
It's comforting, it's convicting.

00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:23.820
I hope this evening that there are some people

00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:26.920
that you work with, that you live by,

00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:29.460
that you come in contact with,

00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:31.780
that could look at your life and could look at my life

00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:36.700
and say, the Lord is with them, the Lord's with them.

00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:39.380
They may not say it exactly that way.

00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:42.179
They may say, there's something different about that person.

00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:44.420
And they don't know what it is,

00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:46.380
they can't quite put their thumb on it,

00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:47.920
that it's the Lord is with them,

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:49.820
but they can look and they can say,

00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:52.460
something's different about that person.

00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:54.059
What's different about you?

00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:59.740
The Lord is my savior.

00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:04.740
And listen, I don't work based upon the work ethic

00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:06.980
of the culture in which I live

00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:11.980
and the coworkers that I have.

00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:14.440
No, I'm working as under the Lord.

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:20.740
By the way, when you do that, you please the Lord,

00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:22.460
but you will face some backlash.

00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:25.760
You have some other employees, coworkers,

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:28.580
that will maybe poke fun at,

00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:30.179
why do you do all of these things

00:39:30.179 --> 00:39:33.619
and you're just trying to blah, blah, blah, whatever.

00:39:33.619 --> 00:39:35.260
No, we do it under the Lord.

00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:40.580
I wonder this evening, the perspective that we have

00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:43.980
with regard to the duties that God gives us.

00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:46.100
And when we find ourselves in a position,

00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:48.900
even as Joseph found himself in this position

00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:50.500
in the house of Potiphar,

00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:52.340
with some events and circumstances

00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:54.300
that were outside of his control,

00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:56.100
that he was a man that I believe,

00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:57.540
as we look at the text of scripture,

00:39:57.540 --> 00:39:59.940
served cheerfully in.

00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:05.740
wholeheartedly. Oh, that God would help us. I would tell you this evening, and I think

00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:10.420
for most of you, I know you well enough that you would tell me as well, that really nothing

00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:16.020
has happened in my life or in your life that's as bad as what happened to Joseph in Genesis

00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:25.260
37. But Joseph still kept a perspective that was God-honoring and allowed him to get in

00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:32.220
the house of Potiphar and have a shining testimony for the Lord. As we continue studying through

00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:37.860
Genesis 39, we'll find Joseph not only as the overseer, but we'll see Joseph as the

00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:43.220
accused. And we'll notice that even in that portion of Scripture, that Joseph kept his

00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:49.540
eyes on God and Joseph did what was right. This evening, I hope that God would help us

00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:55.380
to gain this perspective of Joseph as the overseer and take some of these principles

00:40:55.380 --> 00:41:01.740
and apply them in our lives that we, too, might have the blessing and favor of God upon

00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:07.740
our lives. Listen, God's blessing and favor doesn't come by accident. It doesn't come

00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:16.060
by random chance. It comes as we humbly follow the Lord in obedience to His Word. And God's

00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:24.740
blessing and God's favor is in our lives. Let me say this before we close. Not everything

00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:31.860
that we look at in life as a blessing is truly a blessing. There are some things that you

00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:35.660
could look at as a blessing that really could be a curse. And there are some things that

00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:41.580
you could look at in life that you might think is a curse that's really a blessing. Our ways

00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:49.319
are not His ways. Amen? His thoughts are not our thoughts. He transcends us. And sometimes

00:41:49.319 --> 00:41:56.180
if we're not careful, we have the perspective of our society when we're looking at and seeking

00:41:56.180 --> 00:42:03.380
to evaluate blessings and cursings, but we need to have God's perspective to understand

00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:09.380
what's taking place. I'm so thankful that our God is a good God. He desires that we'd

00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:16.460
walk with Him and that we'd serve Him. And He will bless as we walk in obedience to Him.

00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:19.979
Let's pray together. Father, we love You. We thank You for loving us. We thank You for

00:42:19.979 --> 00:42:26.619
Your Word. Thank You for the example of Joseph. And as we see Joseph in these first few verses

00:42:26.619 --> 00:42:33.660
of Genesis 39 as the overseer, we're convicted by the testimony that Joseph has even in the

00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:41.100
midst of all the circumstances that surround his being in this place. And God, I pray that

00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:47.380
You'd help us to lift our eyes unto Thee. Lord, help us to have a proper biblical perspective

00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:52.540
with regard to the place where You have us, to those circumstances that have brought us

00:42:52.540 --> 00:43:00.820
to the place that we are. Help us, Lord, to serve You. Lord, as unto Christ, not unto

00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:07.139
men. Help us in our daily work as we find ourselves wherever we find ourselves that

00:43:07.139 --> 00:43:12.979
what we do is for You, Lord. Help us to have that perspective. Help us, Lord, to live our

00:43:12.979 --> 00:43:18.419
lives in such a way that Your blessing and Your favor would be upon us. And God, I pray

00:43:18.419 --> 00:43:24.580
that others would see it. Just as Potiphar observed the life of Joseph and saw that the

00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:29.339
Lord was with him, I pray that others as they observe our lives would see that there's something

00:43:29.339 --> 00:43:34.660
different about us and that that difference is Christ. Would You move and work in these

00:43:34.660 --> 00:43:39.100
moments of invitation? Lord, help us to be doers of the Word and not hearers only. And

00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:41.940
we'll thank You for it. In Christ's name we pray.
