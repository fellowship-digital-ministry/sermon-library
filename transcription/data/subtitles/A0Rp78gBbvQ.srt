1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And we should stand in awe of Him because of His power being displayed.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And then the verse finishes this way.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Praise Him according to His excellent greatness.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We are to praise God because of who He is, His nature, His character,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
the fact that, yes, He has all power and all knowledge and wisdom,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and He's everywhere present.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
But we're to praise God because He is holy, because He is just and righteous,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and with Him is forgiveness, and He's ready to pardon and to forgive.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And He's a God who is full of compassion.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And often we see throughout the gospel records how the Lord Jesus Christ was moved with compassion.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And what a blessing to understand this morning

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and to be able to give God the glory and the praise that is due to His name

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
because of who He is and because of what He has done.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
A familiar psalm to many of us is Psalm 48 where the Bible begins,

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
and really it's a song that we sing in Psalm 48.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised,

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
in the city of our God and the mountain of His holiness.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth,

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
is Mount Zion on the sides of the north, the city of the great King.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And we see the rejoicing and the praising that begins in Psalm 48,

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
but I'm always reminded of verse 14 where the Bible says,

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
For this God is our God forever and ever.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
He will be our guide even unto death.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
What a blessing to know personally the God of the universe,

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
that He is my God and that He is interested in me as an individual.

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
He's interested in you as an individual.

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
He knows where you are.

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
He knows the difficulties.

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
We've been studying through 2 Corinthians.

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
This morning we'll be somewhere else, but we've been studying through 2 Corinthians.

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
This calendar year as we've dealt with the subject matter of the theme for our church,

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
His grace is sufficient.

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And we spoke about the wonderful promise that we read in 2 Corinthians chapter 12,

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
but then as we got into the first chapter,

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
we started dealing with the truth that with suffering comes comfort,

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
and our God knows what we're dealing with, and He loves us, and He comforts us,

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
and He comes alongside us, and He provides for us the encouragement that we need.

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And what a blessing that is.

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And then last week we looked at that passage of Scripture

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
where Paul was sharing with us such transparent experience

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
that he had with his relationship with the believers in Corinth

42
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
and how he had been misunderstood.

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And we asked the question, how do we respond when we're misunderstood?

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And God gives us and provides for us wonderful truth in His Word,

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
and He's interested in us as individuals, and He guides us.

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
If we'll allow Him, He will guide us.

47
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And what a blessing to understand that truth this morning.

48
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
We serve a wonderful Savior.

49
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
We study through the Scriptures, and especially the Gospel records,

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
and we have the opportunity to see the life and ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ.

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And as we have an opportunity to study through the Gospel records,

52
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
we see that our Savior moved with purpose,

53
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
and we find that He walked in humility and obedience.

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
We find that He was very purposed in all that He did,

55
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
and though there were many instances where multitudes would throng Him

56
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
and He would deal with feeding the thousands,

57
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
we find that many times throughout the Gospel records

58
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
that Jesus records for us His interaction with individuals.

59
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,000
And what a joy to consider this morning that our God is interested in us as individuals.

60
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
He loves the entire world.

61
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It's a global truth that every person that's walking upon the face of the earth today,

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
that God loves them and that God desires for them to be saved by His wonderful grace.

63
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
But we understand that He's interested in us as individuals.

64
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
He knows us personally.

65
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
He knows your thoughts.

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
He knows everything about you.

67
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And He says to us that we're to cast our care upon Him, for He careth for us.

68
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
The Lord Jesus Christ lived a perfect and a sinless life,

69
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:29,000
and He performed miracles and proved His deity that He indeed is God in flesh.

70
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And we find that His whole purpose of coming to this sin-cursed world

71
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
was to go to that cruel cross.

72
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
We understand that He was born to die.

73
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
We understand that even as Paul would say in the book of Galatians

74
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
that when the fullness of time was come,

75
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
God sent forth His Son for what purpose?

76
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
To go to a cross to redeem them.

77
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
How could He redeem us?

78
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Only through going to the cross and shedding His blood.

79
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Many times during His earthly ministry He shared with His disciples

80
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
about the plans and about the events that would transpire in days ahead.

81
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
And He talked to them openly about His going to Jerusalem

82
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
and dying upon the cross and being buried and then resurrecting.

83
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,000
They didn't always track and follow what Jesus was sharing,

84
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
but we understand that Jesus was providing them with truth.

85
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
We find that He gave them, in John chapter number 13,

86
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
as they're nearing His time to go to the cross,

87
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
He gives them a great example of servanthood

88
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
and being a servant when He washed the feet of the disciples

89
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
and gave them instruction.

90
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
And we find that we enter into the 14th chapter,

91
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
and Jesus begins this way in John 14.

92
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
In verse number one, He says,

93
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Let not your heart be troubled.

94
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
The reality is that all that Jesus had been explaining to His disciples

95
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
and all that was getting ready to transpire,

96
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:13,000
that Jesus knew the impact that these events would have upon His own disciples.

97
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
And He says, Let not your heart be troubled.

98
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Now, there are times in which we may be able to say to someone else,

99
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
we may be able to say, My heart's not troubled,

100
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
but God knows if our heart is troubled.

101
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And He says, Let not your heart be troubled.

102
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
And then He gives one of the most impactful promises

103
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
that we read with regard to His return.

104
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And He says to the disciples, and it's preserved for us today,

105
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
and it's been a passage of Scripture that's given great hope

106
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
and assurance and confidence to the people of God throughout the centuries.

107
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Jesus says, Let not your heart be troubled.

108
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You believe in God? Believe also in Me.

109
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
In My Father's house are many mansions.

110
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
If it were not so, I would have told you.

111
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I go, notice where He says, to prepare a place for you.

112
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
And I want to draw your attention to verse number three.

113
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
And if I go and prepare a place for you,

114
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I will come again and receive you unto Myself,

115
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
that where I am, there ye may be also.

116
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I want you to note those four words in verse number three

117
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
where Jesus says, I will come again.

118
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
This, as we remember this promise,

119
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
and we look at this passage for just a moment

120
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
by way of introduction this morning,

121
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
and we consider this thought that Jesus is coming again,

122
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
we find that He says, I will come again.

123
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
He didn't say, I might come again.

124
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
He didn't say, I may come again.

125
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
He said, I will.

126
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
There's an aspect of this promise that gives us this certainty,

127
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
this confidence.

128
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
And God wants us to be confident.

129
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
He wants us to be certain of His promise.

130
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
And we read last week in 2 Corinthians chapter number 1

131
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
as we were dealing with that passage of Scripture

132
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
where Paul was misunderstood,

133
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
where he spoke of the promises of God in 2 Corinthians 1.20.

134
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
And he says, for all the promises of God in Him are yea,

135
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
and in Him, amen, under the glory of God by us.

136
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
And he says, I will come again.

137
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
It's a certain truth.

138
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It's a certain promise that God has given to us.

139
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
But I want you to also notice that he says, I.

140
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I will come again.

141
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'm thankful for that certainty that I will.

142
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
But when I think about I, Jesus says,

143
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I personally am going to come again.

144
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
We'll look at it in just a few moments.

145
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
But in Acts 1, the angel said,

146
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
this same Jesus shall come in like manner.

147
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
We find that in 1 Thessalonians chapter 4,

148
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
the Bible says, the Lord Himself.

149
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
What a joy to know that Jesus is coming again.

150
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
We look at the truth of God's word,

151
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
and it's a promise that is so precious to us.

152
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And it's recorded over and over in references

153
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
that we have throughout the scriptures

154
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
with regard to this promise.

155
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I'm reminded of Hebrews chapter number 10

156
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
and verse number 37 where the Bible says,

157
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
for yet a little while,

158
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
and He that shall come will come

159
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
and will not tarry.

160
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Jesus came the first time right on time.

161
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
And He's going to come the second time right on time.

162
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
No one's going to delay His arrival.

163
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
No one is going to stay His coming.

164
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
No, we find that He's going to come.

165
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
The Bible says, yet a little while.

166
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I don't know.

167
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You don't know how long a while is.

168
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
But we know that God's timetable is perfect.

169
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
In fact, we find in Acts 1,

170
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
it's not for us to know the hour of His return.

171
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
He's given us marching orders,

172
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
and we'll look at some of those things in just a moment.

173
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,239
But what a joy to be reminded for yet a little while,

174
00:10:03,239 --> 00:10:08,140
and he that shall come will come and will not tarry.

175
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,039
In James chapter 5 and verse number 8,

176
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:13,939
the Bible says, be also patient.

177
00:10:13,939 --> 00:10:21,719
Establish your hearts for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.

178
00:10:21,719 --> 00:10:25,520
The Bible clearly teaches that Jesus is coming again.

179
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,719
I stand here today, and I believe that we're

180
00:10:27,719 --> 00:10:29,959
living in the last days.

181
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:33,880
In fact, as we had for our theme in 2024 continue,

182
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,279
and I had the privilege of preaching

183
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:38,880
through 1 and 2 Timothy on Sunday mornings,

184
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,439
and we came to 2 Timothy chapter 3,

185
00:10:41,439 --> 00:10:43,840
and this know also in the last days

186
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,319
there shall be perilous times.

187
00:10:45,319 --> 00:10:48,020
And God gives us all of that truth

188
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,979
with regard to the days in which we're living.

189
00:10:50,979 --> 00:10:53,759
And we understand that we're living in the last days.

190
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:56,380
And I believe this morning that Jesus

191
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:59,500
could return at any moment.

192
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:03,819
In fact, I believe that he could return before I finished

193
00:11:03,819 --> 00:11:06,180
the sermon this morning.

194
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,459
His return is imminent.

195
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:11,260
And we find that the Bible clearly teaches us

196
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:14,139
that Jesus is coming again.

197
00:11:14,139 --> 00:11:17,379
I've often, as I've considered that wonderful Bible promise,

198
00:11:17,379 --> 00:11:21,419
I've considered the question, are you ready?

199
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:23,540
When someone asks you the question, are you ready,

200
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:26,360
it's a question that requires context.

201
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,819
Am I ready for what?

202
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:33,319
And we find that this morning as we consider this truth

203
00:11:33,319 --> 00:11:36,879
that Jesus is coming again, I wonder this morning,

204
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:38,379
are we ready for his return?

205
00:11:38,379 --> 00:11:41,300
Are we ready that if today were the day,

206
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,900
are we ready to see our Savior face to face?

207
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,160
We find that the great passage of scripture

208
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,940
in 1 Thessalonians chapter 4 that is so familiar to us,

209
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,720
and I'll read it in just a moment,

210
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,519
and begin to just understand how God wants us

211
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:00,800
to be confident of this truth.

212
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,720
He wants us to be comforted by this truth.

213
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,779
In 1 Thessalonians 4, again, it's a familiar passage

214
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:09,320
of scripture, but there was much confusion

215
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,559
with regard to the timing of Christ's return

216
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:17,559
and the truth of this end times eschatology, if you will.

217
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,520
And we read in 1 and 2 Thessalonians much information

218
00:12:23,059 --> 00:12:26,660
that is given to us with regard to eschatology,

219
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:29,740
and as Paul, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God

220
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:32,899
is instructing the church at Thessalonica.

221
00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:36,199
Notice with me in 1 Thessalonians 4 and verse 13,

222
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,339
it begins this way,

223
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:42,779
but I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren,

224
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:45,059
concerning them which are asleep,

225
00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:50,059
that you sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.

226
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:54,919
For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again,

227
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:57,919
even so them also which sleep in Jesus

228
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:00,600
will God bring with him.

229
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:05,279
For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord,

230
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,160
that we which are alive and remain

231
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,559
unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them

232
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:12,440
which are asleep.

233
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,860
For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven

234
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:18,720
with a shout, the voice of the archangel,

235
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,479
with the trump of God and the dead in Christ

236
00:13:21,479 --> 00:13:23,339
shall rise first.

237
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:25,580
Then we which are alive and remain

238
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:28,100
shall be caught up together with them in the clouds

239
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:31,940
to meet the Lord in the air.

240
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,740
And notice these precious words,

241
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:38,740
and so shall we ever be with the Lord.

242
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:44,160
Wherefore, comfort one another with these words.

243
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,979
And oh, how comforting these words are

244
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,199
as God provides for us the order, if you will,

245
00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:52,399
of the resurrection that the dead in Christ

246
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,679
shall rise first at the end of verse 16.

247
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:56,399
Then we which are alive and remain

248
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,279
shall be, notice, caught up,

249
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:01,320
referring to and understanding this reference

250
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,720
to the rapture of the church.

251
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:08,720
And I hope, I hope that I'm alive during the rapture.

252
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,979
That'd be a wonderful thing.

253
00:14:10,979 --> 00:14:12,679
And it says to be caught up together,

254
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:14,080
notice, with them where?

255
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:18,339
In the clouds to meet the Lord in the air.

256
00:14:18,339 --> 00:14:20,700
And so shall we ever be with the Lord.

257
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,019
This is the reference of the rapture.

258
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:24,779
We're talking about Jesus coming again.

259
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:26,239
We understand that his return,

260
00:14:26,239 --> 00:14:28,179
there's these two aspects.

261
00:14:28,179 --> 00:14:30,220
There's the rapture of the church,

262
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:33,179
and then there's the return of the Lord Jesus Christ

263
00:14:33,179 --> 00:14:36,380
with his saints at the end of the tribulation.

264
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,420
We read that in Revelation chapter 19,

265
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,179
when he comes all the way back to earth

266
00:14:41,179 --> 00:14:44,019
and the battle of Armageddon and all that takes place.

267
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,640
And we read of that in Revelation 19,

268
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:50,339
but the focus of what we're dealing with this morning

269
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:52,779
is dealing with that aspect of the rapture,

270
00:14:52,779 --> 00:14:55,679
when the church, the believers,

271
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:57,459
we talk about what is the church?

272
00:14:57,459 --> 00:15:00,320
Well, the church is the body of believers.

273
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,000
How do I become a member of a church?

274
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,880
Well, I have to be saved by the grace of God.

275
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,679
I have to be baptized by immersion.

276
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:10,799
And I voluntarily join myself with a church

277
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:12,480
to carry out the great commission.

278
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:17,940
A church is made up of saved, baptized believers.

279
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,339
And we find that the church,

280
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:22,619
the believers will be raptured.

281
00:15:22,619 --> 00:15:24,820
We do not know the time of the rapture.

282
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,820
It will be sudden, it is imminent.

283
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,619
It'll be like, as we read in 1 Thessalonians 5,

284
00:15:30,619 --> 00:15:31,519
a thief in the night.

285
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,100
We'll deal with that in just a moment.

286
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,980
And we find that this event

287
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:39,579
is the next event on God's prophetic calendar.

288
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:47,480
What we believe must impact how we behave.

289
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,459
What we believe to be true

290
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:56,839
impacts how we live our day, how we behave.

291
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:02,019
The Bible clearly reveals to us this truth

292
00:16:02,019 --> 00:16:03,619
that it would impact our belief,

293
00:16:03,619 --> 00:16:04,660
that we would believe.

294
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:07,260
Remember already that Paul said in verse 13,

295
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,980
I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren.

296
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:12,420
He wants us, God wants us to be informed.

297
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,119
He says in verse number 15,

298
00:16:14,119 --> 00:16:16,799
this we say unto you by the word of the Lord.

299
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:19,959
This is not Paul just simply offering an opinion

300
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:22,079
to an answer that the church in Thessalonica

301
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:22,920
has posed to him.

302
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:27,160
No, this is God giving to his people truth

303
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,299
that would impact how we would live our lives

304
00:16:30,299 --> 00:16:33,440
because belief impacts behavior.

305
00:16:34,359 --> 00:16:36,000
So I ask myself the question,

306
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,799
and I ask you the question this morning as well,

307
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:40,619
how does the wonderful promise

308
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:45,640
that Jesus is coming again impact my daily behavior?

309
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,200
How does the wonderful promise

310
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:54,200
that Jesus is coming again impact your daily behavior?

311
00:16:55,859 --> 00:17:00,859
In 1 John 2, God gives us this record

312
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,799
that John, who by the way,

313
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:07,899
heard the words of Jesus spoken in John 14

314
00:17:07,899 --> 00:17:09,640
that we referenced a moment ago.

315
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:14,579
John was literally there and he heard Jesus say,

316
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:17,140
let not your heart be troubled.

317
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:20,279
He heard Jesus say, I'm going to prepare a place for you.

318
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:23,220
He heard Jesus say, I will come again

319
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,779
and receive you unto myself

320
00:17:24,779 --> 00:17:27,100
that where I am there you may be also.

321
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,420
John heard those precious words

322
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:32,700
and John was the one that God used

323
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,859
to record those precious words

324
00:17:35,859 --> 00:17:38,779
in the gospel of John that we read just a moment ago.

325
00:17:38,779 --> 00:17:41,839
So not only did he hear them verbally as they were spoken,

326
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:45,100
but he had the privilege of writing them

327
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,880
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God

328
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,399
to have for us the gospel of John.

329
00:17:50,399 --> 00:17:52,440
And then as he's writing this epistle

330
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,480
in 1 John 2, notice in verse 28,

331
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:02,600
John says, and now little children abide in him.

332
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:06,920
Notice it says that when he shall appear,

333
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:11,739
I believe that John had all of the confidence

334
00:18:11,739 --> 00:18:14,980
and assurance that any individual could have

335
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:17,339
that Jesus was coming again.

336
00:18:17,339 --> 00:18:19,579
He heard it spoken with his own ears.

337
00:18:19,579 --> 00:18:23,820
He knew that what Jesus said was true.

338
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,859
He knew that he could not lie, that he's God.

339
00:18:26,859 --> 00:18:30,579
And he says that when he shall appear,

340
00:18:30,579 --> 00:18:32,940
notice we may have confidence

341
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:37,940
and not be ashamed before him at his coming.

342
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,960
I'll be honest with you this morning,

343
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,359
this verse has always challenged me.

344
00:18:45,239 --> 00:18:48,919
This verse has always reminded me

345
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:52,440
that it is possible for a child of God

346
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:57,440
to be ashamed before him when he comes.

347
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,599
Oh, I don't want to be in that position.

348
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:03,020
Oh, this morning, I hope that you say,

349
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:05,219
I don't want to be in that position.

350
00:19:05,219 --> 00:19:06,580
I don't want to be embarrassed.

351
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:10,539
I don't want to be ashamed of my savior when he comes.

352
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:16,080
Notice in verse 29, if you know that he is righteous,

353
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,840
you know that everyone that do with righteousness

354
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,179
is born of him, enter the third chapter.

355
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:24,979
Behold, what matter of love

356
00:19:24,979 --> 00:19:27,020
the father hath bestowed upon us.

357
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:29,479
He's actually saying to start the service,

358
00:19:29,479 --> 00:19:31,880
Jesus loves even me.

359
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,559
Oh, what love the father hath bestowed upon us.

360
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:39,760
Notice that we should be called the sons of God.

361
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,539
Therefore the world knoweth us not

362
00:19:41,539 --> 00:19:42,719
because it knew him not.

363
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:47,719
Beloved, now are we the sons of God.

364
00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:51,400
And it doth not yet appear what we shall be,

365
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:55,119
but we know that again, notice the words,

366
00:19:55,119 --> 00:20:00,119
when he shall appear, we shall be.

367
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:06,839
we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is.

368
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:14,459
And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself,

369
00:20:14,459 --> 00:20:18,759
even as he is pure."

370
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,339
When you read verse number three,

371
00:20:20,339 --> 00:20:24,059
you're reminded of the truth that I mentioned a moment ago

372
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:27,599
that belief will impact behavior.

373
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:31,059
Every man that hath this hope, that believes this truth,

374
00:20:31,059 --> 00:20:35,059
that believes that Jesus is going to appear,

375
00:20:35,059 --> 00:20:37,859
that we shall be like Him,

376
00:20:37,859 --> 00:20:42,399
that that individual believer that has that hope,

377
00:20:42,399 --> 00:20:47,859
that he purifies himself because his Savior is pure.

378
00:20:47,859 --> 00:20:51,119
It impacts our behavior.

379
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:53,499
As I read verse two, I'm reminded

380
00:20:53,499 --> 00:20:56,039
of what we read in 1 Corinthians 15,

381
00:20:56,059 --> 00:20:57,899
and in a moment, until we can live an eye,

382
00:20:57,899 --> 00:21:02,819
and we read how that this mortal shall put on immortality

383
00:21:02,819 --> 00:21:06,079
and this corruption shall be put on incorruption,

384
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:08,619
that we shall be changed.

385
00:21:08,619 --> 00:21:09,459
What a blessing.

386
00:21:09,459 --> 00:21:13,459
We shall be like Him, it says in verse number two.

387
00:21:13,459 --> 00:21:15,159
We asked the question this morning,

388
00:21:15,159 --> 00:21:20,419
how does the promise that Jesus is coming again,

389
00:21:20,419 --> 00:21:22,559
how does that impact us?

390
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,019
How does it impact me daily?

391
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:30,539
Do I live each day with the awareness

392
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:34,419
that Jesus could come today?

393
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:38,419
I know that it's a truth that if you were to be asked

394
00:21:38,419 --> 00:21:41,259
this morning by an individual,

395
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:44,979
someday this week by some random person

396
00:21:44,979 --> 00:21:46,519
that just approaches you and says,

397
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:49,299
hey, listen, do you believe that Jesus is coming again?

398
00:21:49,299 --> 00:21:54,139
I think that each of us would without hesitation, yes.

399
00:21:54,139 --> 00:21:56,299
We believe it.

400
00:21:56,299 --> 00:22:00,379
We know it to be true.

401
00:22:00,379 --> 00:22:03,059
But we live in a busy world.

402
00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:06,299
We have so many responsibilities.

403
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:09,720
We're being pulled in so many different directions.

404
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:16,179
And the reality is that because of those circumstances,

405
00:22:16,179 --> 00:22:24,379
it may very well be that we could live days consecutively,

406
00:22:24,379 --> 00:22:31,419
weeks, months, without even considering

407
00:22:31,419 --> 00:22:36,619
that today could be the day.

408
00:22:36,619 --> 00:22:39,059
And so how would it impact us?

409
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:41,500
Just a few thoughts this morning.

410
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,220
Number one, if you're taking notes,

411
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:46,259
the promise of Christ's return

412
00:22:46,259 --> 00:22:51,259
should energize our service for him.

413
00:22:51,259 --> 00:22:53,099
What do I mean by that?

414
00:22:53,099 --> 00:22:56,259
Well, the reality is that I believe

415
00:22:56,259 --> 00:22:58,179
that Jesus is coming again,

416
00:22:58,179 --> 00:23:01,179
and you believe that Jesus is coming again,

417
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:02,779
and we read the scriptures,

418
00:23:02,779 --> 00:23:04,619
and there's so many references,

419
00:23:04,619 --> 00:23:06,459
many of which I've already looked to,

420
00:23:06,459 --> 00:23:09,580
and many more that we could examine this morning.

421
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:12,500
And we see that his return is imminent,

422
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,299
that he could come at any moment.

423
00:23:14,299 --> 00:23:17,819
And so that promise, that truth,

424
00:23:17,819 --> 00:23:21,259
should energize our service for him.

425
00:23:21,259 --> 00:23:25,500
The songwriter said it well when he said this,

426
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:29,580
work for the night is coming.

427
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,779
Work for the night is coming.

428
00:23:30,779 --> 00:23:33,179
Listen, Jesus is coming again,

429
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:36,899
and we have a service, a work to do for him.

430
00:23:36,899 --> 00:23:39,419
And this truth, this reality,

431
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:42,500
this promise should energize our service.

432
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,059
It should cause us to be more engaged

433
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:48,259
in doing the work that God has called us to do.

434
00:23:48,259 --> 00:23:51,819
I'm reminded of the truth of Ephesians 5,

435
00:23:51,819 --> 00:23:53,139
and verse number 16,

436
00:23:53,139 --> 00:23:56,779
where we're told that we are to redeem the time

437
00:23:56,779 --> 00:23:58,699
because the days are evil.

438
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,940
That we literally would make each day count,

439
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:06,699
that we would understand that the time

440
00:24:06,699 --> 00:24:08,259
that God has given to us,

441
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:11,019
that life is precious,

442
00:24:11,979 --> 00:24:15,299
that time is limited.

443
00:24:17,739 --> 00:24:21,299
And we're to redeem the time because the days are evil.

444
00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:23,820
I wanna remind you that Jesus said in Luke 19,

445
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:26,299
in verse number 13, he said this,

446
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:29,779
occupy till I come.

447
00:24:29,779 --> 00:24:31,139
He's talking to those 10 servants.

448
00:24:31,139 --> 00:24:32,619
There's a parable that is given to us

449
00:24:32,619 --> 00:24:34,699
in that passage of Scripture,

450
00:24:34,699 --> 00:24:36,699
but he uses those words at the end of that verse,

451
00:24:36,699 --> 00:24:40,299
occupy till I come.

452
00:24:40,299 --> 00:24:41,739
And what does that give us?

453
00:24:41,739 --> 00:24:43,459
The idea of doing a work,

454
00:24:43,459 --> 00:24:48,339
being busy about the work that he's given to us.

455
00:24:48,339 --> 00:24:50,419
And I believe this morning

456
00:24:50,419 --> 00:24:54,500
that the promise that Jesus could return today

457
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,100
should energize our service for him.

458
00:25:00,459 --> 00:25:02,899
Listen, this morning, I'm thankful

459
00:25:02,899 --> 00:25:05,339
that when Jesus appears,

460
00:25:05,339 --> 00:25:08,179
when the trumpet of the Lord shall sound

461
00:25:08,179 --> 00:25:10,820
and I'm raptured out of here

462
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:13,179
and I meet the Lord in the clouds,

463
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:14,979
if that happened today,

464
00:25:14,979 --> 00:25:18,619
then I'm gonna ever, I'll be forever with my Savior,

465
00:25:18,619 --> 00:25:20,579
the one who died for me.

466
00:25:20,579 --> 00:25:23,779
We sing so often about seeing him face to face

467
00:25:23,779 --> 00:25:25,540
and what a day that will be

468
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,419
and certainly it's gonna be a wonderful day.

469
00:25:27,419 --> 00:25:29,339
But I recognize this morning

470
00:25:29,339 --> 00:25:33,100
that once the rapture takes place,

471
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,380
once Jesus comes again,

472
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,899
I will never preach another sermon.

473
00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:41,899
I will never, I should say,

474
00:25:41,899 --> 00:25:45,419
the musician will never play another special,

475
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:49,260
the musician will never sing another special,

476
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,019
the nursery work,

477
00:25:51,019 --> 00:25:54,940
I mean, the work that God has given to us to do.

478
00:25:58,139 --> 00:25:59,820
I'm not gonna do it anymore.

479
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,260
Oh, we're gonna be in his presence

480
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,139
and we're gonna worship him for all of eternity.

481
00:26:03,139 --> 00:26:04,059
I mean, we're gonna,

482
00:26:04,059 --> 00:26:06,100
you look at Revelation 4 and 5

483
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,339
and what a scene it is.

484
00:26:08,339 --> 00:26:09,260
We're gonna be with him,

485
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:12,100
we're gonna worship him and it's wonderful.

486
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:15,299
But the work that he's given to us

487
00:26:15,299 --> 00:26:19,899
for this time, for this life will cease.

488
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,779
And so the promise of his return

489
00:26:23,779 --> 00:26:27,339
should energize our service for him,

490
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,500
that we make every effort

491
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:33,699
to do what he's equipped us to do

492
00:26:33,699 --> 00:26:38,059
and to be that good steward of his manifold grace.

493
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:42,220
Number two, the promise of Christ's return

494
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:47,220
should cause us to engage in evangelism.

495
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,299
Why do I say to engage in evangelism?

496
00:26:49,299 --> 00:26:50,459
Why do I make the distinction

497
00:26:50,459 --> 00:26:52,979
between engaging in evangelism

498
00:26:52,979 --> 00:26:55,100
versus energizing our service?

499
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:58,299
Because certainly there is a connection

500
00:26:58,299 --> 00:27:01,859
between the two that part of my service to Christ

501
00:27:01,859 --> 00:27:04,139
is evangelizing the world

502
00:27:04,139 --> 00:27:05,500
and we understand that.

503
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,220
But I focus specifically

504
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:09,299
on the second thought this morning

505
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:12,059
that his promise should cause us

506
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:14,619
to be engaged in evangelism

507
00:27:14,619 --> 00:27:18,899
because I'll never tell a sinner about Christ

508
00:27:18,899 --> 00:27:21,820
once the rapture takes place.

509
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,660
Oh, during the tribulation

510
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:27,139
there will be witnesses here upon the earth

511
00:27:27,139 --> 00:27:30,500
that many will be saved during the tribulation.

512
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,019
But recognize this morning

513
00:27:33,019 --> 00:27:34,940
that I'm not and you are not

514
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,299
any of those witnesses

515
00:27:36,299 --> 00:27:38,899
that the Bible gives us record of

516
00:27:38,899 --> 00:27:41,380
in the book of Revelation during the tribulation.

517
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,699
So if I'm going to engage in evangelism,

518
00:27:44,699 --> 00:27:47,979
I must do it before the return of Christ.

519
00:27:47,979 --> 00:27:51,260
I must do it before I lay down my life,

520
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:53,540
before I'm no longer here,

521
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:56,019
whether that's through rapture or through death,

522
00:27:56,019 --> 00:27:58,899
but I must engage in evangelism.

523
00:27:58,899 --> 00:28:01,579
Remember with me that after

524
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:04,820
the Lord Jesus Christ went to the cruel cross,

525
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:08,179
after He bled and suffered and died,

526
00:28:08,179 --> 00:28:11,299
after He paid for your sin and for my sin,

527
00:28:11,299 --> 00:28:13,220
that He went to that borrowed tomb.

528
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:15,220
And after three days,

529
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:17,459
He rose conquering sin, death, and the grave

530
00:28:17,459 --> 00:28:20,419
and what wonderful day that was

531
00:28:20,419 --> 00:28:23,579
and it's the reason that we meet on Sundays,

532
00:28:23,579 --> 00:28:24,779
the first day of the week.

533
00:28:24,779 --> 00:28:27,820
I mean, we serve a risen Savior, hallelujah.

534
00:28:29,299 --> 00:28:31,699
But I want to remind you that after His resurrection

535
00:28:31,699 --> 00:28:34,179
and during those days of His ministry

536
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:35,739
before He ascended to heaven,

537
00:28:35,739 --> 00:28:40,739
that He gave the Great Commission.

538
00:28:41,779 --> 00:28:46,099
The Great Commission remains today our mandate.

539
00:28:47,099 --> 00:28:50,859
The Great Commission that was given by Christ

540
00:28:50,859 --> 00:28:54,500
to the disciples continues to this very day

541
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:59,020
to be the mandate of Christ's church.

542
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,539
He said, I will build my church

543
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:03,059
and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.

544
00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:05,179
He said that His church is the pillar

545
00:29:05,179 --> 00:29:06,580
and ground of the truth.

546
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:11,539
He says that His people are to be engaged in evangelism,

547
00:29:11,539 --> 00:29:13,900
that we are to go forth and preach the gospel

548
00:29:14,099 --> 00:29:16,380
to every creature.

549
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,659
Let me remind you, we're familiar with Matthew.

550
00:29:18,659 --> 00:29:20,619
Let me remind you, 28,

551
00:29:20,619 --> 00:29:23,380
but let's look at Acts chapter one just for a moment.

552
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:25,339
And I want you to look at Acts chapter one

553
00:29:25,339 --> 00:29:27,779
and we, of course, are reminded

554
00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:29,700
that each of the gospel records

555
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:33,419
have a reference to the Great Commission.

556
00:29:33,419 --> 00:29:34,859
In the gospel of John,

557
00:29:34,859 --> 00:29:37,219
Jesus mentions how that He was sent

558
00:29:37,219 --> 00:29:39,460
and that He now sends us

559
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:42,539
and what a blessing to be sent by Christ.

560
00:29:42,539 --> 00:29:45,099
What a blessing, as the disciples would say

561
00:29:45,099 --> 00:29:45,979
in the book of Acts,

562
00:29:45,979 --> 00:29:47,419
that we are His witnesses,

563
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:50,460
that as we'll study in several weeks,

564
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,820
maybe months as we study

565
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:53,020
through the book of 2 Corinthians,

566
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,900
that I am an ambassador.

567
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:59,539
We've been given the ministry of reconciliation.

568
00:29:59,539 --> 00:30:07,119
In Acts 1, in verse number 6, the Bible says when they, therefore, were come together,

569
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:11,819
they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to

570
00:30:11,819 --> 00:30:12,819
Israel?

571
00:30:12,819 --> 00:30:17,299
And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father

572
00:30:17,299 --> 00:30:19,979
hath put in his own power.

573
00:30:19,979 --> 00:30:23,859
Understand that right now Israel's kind of been put on the back burner, if you will,

574
00:30:23,859 --> 00:30:25,699
and God is dealing with the church.

575
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:26,699
Why?

576
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:28,139
Because Israel rejected.

577
00:30:28,139 --> 00:30:34,379
He came to his own, but his own received him not, and they rejected Messiah, and the church

578
00:30:34,379 --> 00:30:40,299
has been, Gentiles were grafted, Jewish people, Israelites can still be saved today.

579
00:30:40,299 --> 00:30:43,239
They must be saved by the blood of Christ.

580
00:30:43,239 --> 00:30:47,539
They must recognize Jesus as their Messiah.

581
00:30:47,539 --> 00:30:53,899
But we find that during the tribulation, after the church is raptured, guess what, Jesus,

582
00:30:53,899 --> 00:31:00,579
God is now dealing front and center with Israel.

583
00:31:00,579 --> 00:31:04,399
And so he tells them, it's not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father

584
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:05,819
hath put in his own power.

585
00:31:05,819 --> 00:31:08,119
But notice how he answers the question.

586
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:12,819
They ask, and he says, it's not for you to know, but ye shall, verse 8, receive power

587
00:31:12,819 --> 00:31:17,499
after the Holy Ghost has come upon you, and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem

588
00:31:17,499 --> 00:31:21,579
and all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth.

589
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:25,859
And so he answers their question by saying, it's not for you to know, it's not for you

590
00:31:25,859 --> 00:31:27,939
to be concerned about, but ye shall be.

591
00:31:27,939 --> 00:31:30,299
This is what you should be focused on.

592
00:31:30,299 --> 00:31:32,379
This is what you should be concerned with.

593
00:31:32,379 --> 00:31:35,139
This is what your responsibility is.

594
00:31:35,139 --> 00:31:41,339
And when, verse number 8, he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up

595
00:31:41,339 --> 00:31:47,419
and a cloud received him out of their sight.

596
00:31:47,419 --> 00:31:53,579
As I read the Bible, there are several passages of Scripture, several events that I come to

597
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:58,219
that I say something like this to myself, man, I wish I was there for that.

598
00:31:58,219 --> 00:32:04,019
I mean, I just read a few days ago about the crossing of the Red Sea, oh man, I wish I

599
00:32:04,019 --> 00:32:05,259
was there to see that.

600
00:32:05,259 --> 00:32:09,799
I mean, you start looking through as you read the Bible and you read these great miracles

601
00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:14,459
and you read about God's power being displayed, you say, oh, I wish I could have seen that,

602
00:32:14,459 --> 00:32:17,139
I wish I was there to witness that.

603
00:32:17,139 --> 00:32:22,099
And here, as I come to Acts chapter 1, that's a thought that I have.

604
00:32:22,099 --> 00:32:28,819
Can you imagine being there, hearing the very words of Christ, and as he's speaking those

605
00:32:28,819 --> 00:32:34,139
words he's taken up and out of your sight.

606
00:32:34,139 --> 00:32:36,619
Wow.

607
00:32:36,619 --> 00:32:41,899
Verse 10, while they looked steadfastly toward heaven, as he went up, behold, two men stood

608
00:32:41,899 --> 00:32:44,139
by them in white apparel.

609
00:32:44,139 --> 00:32:50,459
God looked steadfastly toward heaven as well, and I think you would too.

610
00:32:50,459 --> 00:33:01,299
Notice what is said by these angels, ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven?

611
00:33:01,299 --> 00:33:09,819
This same Jesus, what did Jesus say in John 14, I will come again.

612
00:33:09,819 --> 00:33:17,219
This same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner

613
00:33:17,219 --> 00:33:23,339
as ye have seen him go into heaven.

614
00:33:23,339 --> 00:33:26,379
You think that impacted these disciples?

615
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:31,739
Oh, absolutely, absolutely.

616
00:33:31,739 --> 00:33:37,699
They see the ascension, they remember the words, but you shall receive power, you shall

617
00:33:37,699 --> 00:33:40,379
be witnesses unto me.

618
00:33:40,379 --> 00:33:47,299
They remember those words, they remember the ascension, and then they hear this same Jesus

619
00:33:47,299 --> 00:33:51,899
shall so come in like manner.

620
00:33:51,899 --> 00:34:01,419
Probably reminding them of what they heard before the crucifixion, I will come again.

621
00:34:01,419 --> 00:34:07,979
And we find that as you would trace the steps of the disciples through the book of Acts,

622
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:19,779
I am thoroughly convinced that the truth that was given to them in Acts 1 impacted how they

623
00:34:19,779 --> 00:34:22,939
behaved and what they did.

624
00:34:22,939 --> 00:34:29,059
The Bible says that they filled Jerusalem with their doctrine.

625
00:34:29,059 --> 00:34:34,099
The Bible says that they turned the world upside down.

626
00:34:34,099 --> 00:34:41,379
The Bible tells us that when the persecution came and intensified and reached that place

627
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:47,739
in Acts chapter 8 where the people were scattered, and remember, it wasn't the leaders that were

628
00:34:47,739 --> 00:34:52,379
scattered, no, the leaders of the church stayed in Jerusalem, it was the people that were

629
00:34:52,379 --> 00:34:53,379
scattered.

630
00:34:53,379 --> 00:34:57,999
It wasn't Peter and James that were scattered, it was the people.

631
00:34:57,999 --> 00:35:02,279
And when they were scattered abroad, the Bible says that they went everywhere preaching

632
00:35:02,279 --> 00:35:05,719
the word.

633
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:09,079
The Bible records the missionary journeys.

634
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:14,479
The Bible records for us as Paul would make that wonderful declaration that we're so familiar

635
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:20,439
with in Romans 1 and verse 16, I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, but you know he said

636
00:35:20,439 --> 00:35:25,479
prior to that truth that he's not ashamed, he said that he was ready.

637
00:35:25,479 --> 00:35:26,479
He was ready to do what?

638
00:35:26,959 --> 00:35:36,719
Well, he was ready to go to Rome, he was ready to go there and to preach the gospel.

639
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:42,119
Paul understood that Christ was going to return.

640
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:44,919
He didn't know when, just like we don't know when.

641
00:35:44,919 --> 00:35:51,919
But God used Paul to write many of the references that we've already acknowledged this morning,

642
00:35:51,919 --> 00:35:53,919
the verses of Scripture.

643
00:35:53,919 --> 00:35:59,879
Paul was aware of the truth and his belief impacted his behavior and he says I'm ready

644
00:35:59,879 --> 00:36:00,879
to preach the gospel.

645
00:36:00,879 --> 00:36:05,999
I mean, when you read about Paul on the missionary journeys and you read about his desire to

646
00:36:05,999 --> 00:36:13,639
go to regions beyond and to preach the gospel because he understood that he had to engage

647
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:16,379
people with the gospel.

648
00:36:16,379 --> 00:36:20,999
He had to engage in evangelism personally.

649
00:36:20,999 --> 00:36:25,839
Second Peter chapter three, if you take a moment in your Bible to turn there and oftentimes

650
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:33,999
we read or reference at least verse number nine with regard to the promise that is given

651
00:36:33,999 --> 00:36:39,799
to us there and the fact that God is not slack concerning his promise and I'm thankful for

652
00:36:39,799 --> 00:36:42,399
that and I know that you are as well.

653
00:36:42,399 --> 00:36:48,359
But I want to read the context here as we pick it up in verse number one in second Peter

654
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:53,359
chapter three and the Bible says this second epistle beloved I now write unto you in both

655
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:58,639
which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance.

656
00:36:58,639 --> 00:37:03,279
They may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets and of

657
00:37:03,279 --> 00:37:09,759
the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Savior knowing this first that there

658
00:37:09,759 --> 00:37:15,439
shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lust.

659
00:37:15,439 --> 00:37:19,159
Oh have we not seen that?

660
00:37:19,159 --> 00:37:23,119
Maybe we've experienced it, scoffers.

661
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:28,119
The Bible says that these scoffers that are walking after their own lust and here's the

662
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:36,079
reference contextually what they say in verse number four where is the promise of his coming?

663
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:40,799
For since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of

664
00:37:40,799 --> 00:37:47,479
the creation and notice what God tells us in verse number five for this they willingly

665
00:37:47,479 --> 00:37:49,119
are ignorant of.

666
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:56,199
They don't want to know the truth because they want to keep believing what they're believing.

667
00:37:56,199 --> 00:38:00,079
And it says that by the word of God the heavens were of old and the earth standing out of

668
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:04,439
the water and in the water whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water

669
00:38:04,439 --> 00:38:05,439
perished.

670
00:38:05,439 --> 00:38:06,439
You know what he references?

671
00:38:06,439 --> 00:38:07,439
The flood.

672
00:38:07,439 --> 00:38:08,439
The global flood.

673
00:38:08,439 --> 00:38:10,239
That's what's referenced.

674
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:13,559
How many people deny the flood?

675
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:15,679
Many.

676
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:19,839
Verse seven, but the heavens and the earth which are now by the same word are kept in

677
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:27,759
store reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.

678
00:38:27,759 --> 00:38:34,039
Read about the tribulation and God's wrath being poured out upon the wicked.

679
00:38:34,039 --> 00:38:39,119
But beloved, notice verse number eight, be not ignorant of this one thing that one day

680
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:44,000
is with the Lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day.

681
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,719
Our God is outside of time.

682
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:47,959
He's outside of time.

683
00:38:47,959 --> 00:38:51,320
He's eternal.

684
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:55,419
Though there are some that would say as he mentions in verse number four where's the

685
00:38:55,419 --> 00:38:58,320
promise of his coming?

686
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:02,239
He says don't be ignorant of this truth.

687
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:07,959
Don't be ignorant of the fact that that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years and

688
00:39:07,959 --> 00:39:09,519
a thousand years as one day.

689
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:13,639
Listen, Jesus is coming and he's going to come right on time.

690
00:39:13,639 --> 00:39:20,440
And it says in verse number nine, and what a blessing this verse is, the Lord is not

691
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:25,979
slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness.

692
00:39:25,979 --> 00:39:34,839
But notice what the Bible says, but as long suffering to usward, not willing that any

693
00:39:35,159 --> 00:39:44,159
should perish, but that all should come to repentance.

694
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:46,159
God is not slack concerning his promise.

695
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:50,440
He is going to come again, but he's long suffering.

696
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,440
Why is he long suffering?

697
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:57,440
Well, because he's not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.

698
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,479
With that understanding in, in

699
00:39:59,479 --> 00:40:05,399
2 Peter 3 and verse number 9, with the understanding of the heart of God, how that should impact

700
00:40:05,399 --> 00:40:07,999
us that God is long-suffering.

701
00:40:07,999 --> 00:40:11,119
He's not willing that any should perish, that all should come to repentance.

702
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:16,639
And when I understand the promise of Christ's return, that He says, I will come again, that

703
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:23,199
it should cause me, it should cause you to engage in evangelism.

704
00:40:23,199 --> 00:40:28,279
Because the reality is in verse number 10, but the day of the Lord will come as a thief

705
00:40:28,279 --> 00:40:32,679
in the night, that day is going to come.

706
00:40:32,679 --> 00:40:41,519
And I don't know the day and neither do you, but we do know that we have opportunity now

707
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:51,399
to engage in the gospel, to engage in evangelism, to share the gospel with some neighbor, coworker,

708
00:40:51,559 --> 00:40:59,359
relative, whomever it may be, that God would lead us into their path.

709
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:04,279
Interesting circumstances yesterday occurred, and I won't get into the details, but basically

710
00:41:04,279 --> 00:41:13,999
a little accident right outside of the church driveway here, and unique circumstances, but

711
00:41:13,999 --> 00:41:20,159
led to an opportunity to share gospel tracks and talk to one man about the Lord.

712
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:24,639
I could never orchestrate those circumstances.

713
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:29,039
The young man, who was 18 years old, is from another country.

714
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:38,279
He's here in this country studying at Virginia Tech, and he was just here literally heading

715
00:41:38,279 --> 00:41:45,639
to a bus stop to take a bus back, was able to share a gospel track with him.

716
00:41:45,639 --> 00:41:51,679
God gives us opportunities, but we must engage in evangelism.

717
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:59,959
We must understand this morning that the gospel is powerful, that people are dying and they

718
00:41:59,959 --> 00:42:01,799
need to hear the gospel.

719
00:42:01,799 --> 00:42:09,679
I believe that according to 2 Thessalonians, that those that have heard and have rejected,

720
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:11,319
God's going to send them strong delusion.

721
00:42:11,319 --> 00:42:13,759
They're not going to be able to say, okay, now I'm going to go ahead and get saved because

722
00:42:13,759 --> 00:42:14,759
the rapture took place.

723
00:42:14,879 --> 00:42:21,879
No, God's going to send them strong delusion, and we have an opportunity to give the gospel.

724
00:42:21,879 --> 00:42:29,839
We've all read, I hope, we've all read at some point Revelation chapter 20.

725
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:37,559
We've read about the great white throne judgment, how sad that passage of Scripture is, but

726
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:43,599
it records for us an event that will take place at least a thousand and seven years

727
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:47,919
from now, but it will take place.

728
00:42:47,919 --> 00:42:54,879
And this evening, or this morning, as I think about being engaged in evangelism, I want

729
00:42:54,879 --> 00:43:04,639
to be motivated by this promise of Christ's return to do more, to be more engaged, because

730
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:06,639
people need the gospel.

731
00:43:06,639 --> 00:43:09,999
People need to hear the truth of salvation.

732
00:43:09,999 --> 00:43:16,119
For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God, but we have this treasure in

733
00:43:16,119 --> 00:43:17,519
earthen vessels.

734
00:43:17,519 --> 00:43:22,639
If our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost, according to 2 Corinthians chapter

735
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:24,599
number 4.

736
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:28,399
So how does the promise, how does it impact us?

737
00:43:28,399 --> 00:43:34,159
Well, it should energize our service, should cause us to engage in evangelism.

738
00:43:34,159 --> 00:43:39,319
Chapter number 3 this morning, the promise of Christ's return should cause us to live

739
00:43:39,319 --> 00:43:43,799
with expectancy, live with expectancy.

740
00:43:43,799 --> 00:43:46,119
Here's the thought, today could be the day.

741
00:43:46,119 --> 00:43:51,999
I mean, when we live every day with that expectancy that Christ could return, that today could

742
00:43:51,999 --> 00:43:56,119
be the very day, that's going to change how I live today.

743
00:43:56,119 --> 00:43:59,239
It's going to change what I do today.

744
00:43:59,239 --> 00:44:06,039
It's going to impact, and we find that there should be this level of expectancy, and shall

745
00:44:06,039 --> 00:44:08,679
I also say excitement.

746
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:12,919
I mean, what a joy to know the truth of God's word.

747
00:44:12,919 --> 00:44:18,119
What a truth that the Lord himself shall descend from heaven, that we shall meet him in the

748
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:19,119
air.

749
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:23,839
I mean, I hope, as Brother Mershon often says, I'm not looking for the undertaker, but for

750
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:24,839
the upper taker.

751
00:44:24,839 --> 00:44:33,679
I mean, oh, I hope that I'm alive when the rapture takes place, and I live with expectancy.

752
00:44:33,679 --> 00:44:41,679
I think the enemy wants to lull us to sleep, to think, yeah, yeah, yeah, I know Christ

753
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:47,279
is going to come, but it's probably not going to happen anytime soon, and to kind of drive

754
00:44:47,279 --> 00:44:51,519
our stakes real deep and just, no, no, no.

755
00:44:51,519 --> 00:44:58,159
He is going to come, and it could be today, and I live with that expectancy.

756
00:44:58,159 --> 00:45:03,799
I read 1 Thessalonians 4, 13 through 18 earlier in the message, but I want to reference back

757
00:45:03,799 --> 00:45:11,079
to 1 Thessalonians chapter 5, and I want to share with you two truths that God gives us

758
00:45:11,079 --> 00:45:15,279
with regard to this idea of expectancy.

759
00:45:15,279 --> 00:45:18,159
In verse 1 of 1 Thessalonians 5, the Bible says,

760
00:45:19,159 --> 00:45:32,279
That's the one example.

761
00:45:32,279 --> 00:45:37,439
We read that just a moment ago in 2 Peter chapter 3 in verse number 10.

762
00:45:37,439 --> 00:45:44,439
This example that God is giving to us with regard to the imminence of His return and

763
00:45:44,439 --> 00:45:48,199
the expectancy that we should have, and then it says in verse number 3,

764
00:46:01,639 --> 00:46:07,839
I remember when Holly was expecting Juliana, and I remember having this thought when she

765
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:14,559
would say to me, I'm having some contractions, and I had zero interest, I mean not point

766
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:21,439
anything zero, zero, zero interest in delivering a baby at home or in the car.

767
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:25,119
And so when she said, I'm having contractions, and I've been timing them, and they're this

768
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:29,239
many minutes apart, I said, it sounds like it's time to go to the doctor.

769
00:46:29,239 --> 00:46:34,079
And we'd get in the car, we'd go to the hospital, and we learned, I think with Juliana, two

770
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:42,399
or three different times going to the hospital to find out that it was not really happening.

771
00:46:42,399 --> 00:46:48,479
I was teaching Sunday school the Sunday before Juliana was born on Monday.

772
00:46:48,479 --> 00:46:52,759
The entire time I'm teaching Sunday school, I can see Holly, and I can see in her countenance,

773
00:46:52,759 --> 00:46:55,879
and I can see that she's not feeling real well.

774
00:46:55,879 --> 00:46:56,879
And I'm really concerned.

775
00:46:56,879 --> 00:47:00,199
I'm trying to get through the lesson as quickly as I can to find out what needs to happen

776
00:47:00,199 --> 00:47:01,199
again.

777
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:06,399
I'm not interested in delivering a baby.

778
00:47:06,399 --> 00:47:08,999
We headed over to the hospital, and they said, no, not yet.

779
00:47:08,999 --> 00:47:09,999
Come back tomorrow.

780
00:47:09,999 --> 00:47:10,999
And they ended up inducing her.

781
00:47:10,999 --> 00:47:14,119
But, you know, there are many records you've read, no doubt.

782
00:47:14,119 --> 00:47:19,359
You've heard the stories of babies that are delivered on the side of the road as they're

783
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:22,439
driving on the way to the hospital, and so on and so forth.

784
00:47:22,439 --> 00:47:30,079
And listen, this thing, it says that, as travail upon a woman with child, it helps us to understand

785
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:35,799
this expectancy that we have, that Christ is soon going to return.

786
00:47:35,799 --> 00:47:40,839
In 1 Corinthians chapter 15, a passage that I referenced earlier, the Bible says it this

787
00:47:40,839 --> 00:47:46,199
way, in 1 Corinthians 15, in verse number 51, behold, I show you a mystery.

788
00:47:46,199 --> 00:47:52,839
We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an

789
00:47:52,839 --> 00:47:55,119
eye, at the last trump.

790
00:47:55,119 --> 00:48:00,239
For the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall

791
00:48:00,239 --> 00:48:01,599
be changed.

792
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:07,799
For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this moral must put on immortality.

793
00:48:07,799 --> 00:48:11,999
We find in a moment, the twinkling of an eye.

794
00:48:11,999 --> 00:48:17,119
See, the Lord has informed us of this glorious truth.

795
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:21,239
He wants us to believe that He's going to come again.

796
00:48:21,239 --> 00:48:27,639
He wants us to be assured of it, to be confident that Jesus is coming again.

797
00:48:27,639 --> 00:48:31,399
I mean, you can't talk me out of it, you can't convince me otherwise, why?

798
00:48:31,399 --> 00:48:35,839
Because I've got this book right here, I've read the book, I've read where Jesus said

799
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:40,719
where we started this morning, I will come again.

800
00:48:40,719 --> 00:48:51,039
I'm convinced, I believe, but my belief and your belief must have an impact on my behavior.

801
00:48:51,039 --> 00:48:58,159
It must impact how I live my day, how I live and lead my life.

802
00:48:58,159 --> 00:49:04,679
And I wonder this morning, when we rejoice that Jesus is coming again, and we should

803
00:49:04,679 --> 00:49:12,000
rejoice that Jesus is coming again, but I wonder this morning, am I living, are you

804
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:18,159
living with the thought that today could be the day?

805
00:49:18,159 --> 00:49:23,519
When I consider the wonderful promise that Jesus is coming again, does it energize my

806
00:49:23,519 --> 00:49:24,519
service?

807
00:49:24,519 --> 00:49:29,440
Does it come and say, I want to do more for Christ?

808
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:37,440
Do the words of the song, work for the night is coming, ring in my mind, because time is

809
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,839
limited.

810
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:46,119
It's precious, but it's limited, and it should energize my service.

811
00:49:46,119 --> 00:49:52,959
It should cause me to engage in evangelism, that I should be reminded that the command

812
00:49:52,959 --> 00:49:59,559
that Christ gave just prior to His ascension is the mandate for His church.

813
00:49:59,559 --> 00:50:04,799
church, that we're to go and preach the gospel to every creature, that we're to be engaged

814
00:50:04,799 --> 00:50:12,139
in evangelism, and then do I live with expectancy? I mean, today could be the day. What a great

815
00:50:12,139 --> 00:50:22,039
truth. As we live each day, help us to live with these four words in our mind, I will

816
00:50:22,039 --> 00:50:29,279
come again. Jesus is coming again. Are you ready? Are you ready? Are you saved? Do you

817
00:50:29,279 --> 00:50:34,159
know Christ as your personal Savior? I mean, you have recognized that you're a sinner,

818
00:50:34,159 --> 00:50:38,059
for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God, but you recognize that there's

819
00:50:38,059 --> 00:50:44,999
a penalty, a consequence for sin, for the wage of sin is death. Jesus died in your place.

820
00:50:44,999 --> 00:50:50,079
He died for you. And he offers to you the free gift, the wage of sin is death, but the

821
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:55,039
gift of God's eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord, for whosoever shall call upon the

822
00:50:55,039 --> 00:51:02,719
name of the Lord shall be saved. You recognize that you're a sinner and he is the only Savior,

823
00:51:02,719 --> 00:51:09,680
and you repent and you turn from your old ways of thinking of, I could be a good person,

824
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:13,000
or whatever your thoughts are with how you might be able to get to heaven, and recognize

825
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:17,479
it's not by works of righteousness which we have done. It's according to his mercy that

826
00:51:17,479 --> 00:51:31,319
it saved us, and what a joy for the promises given to us that Jesus came to save sinners.

827
00:51:31,319 --> 00:51:35,599
This morning, the first step for being ready for his return is that you're saved by the

828
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:39,559
grace of God, that you know, that you know, that you know. If you're to die today, that

829
00:51:39,559 --> 00:51:43,680
heaven is your home. Oh, if you don't know for sure that heaven is your home, we'd love

830
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:46,159
to be able to chat with you and be able to take a Bible and show you how you can know

831
00:51:46,159 --> 00:51:51,519
for sure that heaven is your home. You say, Pastor, I'm saved. I've been born again. Praise

832
00:51:51,519 --> 00:51:59,879
the Lord. I'm so thankful for that. Let the promise impact your behavior. Let what you

833
00:51:59,879 --> 00:52:07,319
believe impact how you live. Let our service be energized. Let us engage in evangelism,

834
00:52:07,319 --> 00:52:12,080
and let us live with expectancy. Shall we pray? Father, we love you. We thank you for

835
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:18,440
loving us. We thank you for your word. We thank you for the opportunity to open your

836
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:26,160
word and to have this technology, to have a live stream service. Lord, I do pray that

837
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:31,779
you would work in hearts and lives, that you would help us, Lord, to be responsive in this

838
00:52:31,779 --> 00:52:40,000
moment of invitation. Lord, that we would examine our own hearts and our own lives and

839
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:51,360
our daily behavior. As we examine, we desire to be able to correct whatever might be need

840
00:52:51,360 --> 00:53:00,880
of correction, in need of correction. God, we would allow this wonderful promise to impact

841
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:05,239
how we live each day. If there's one that's not saved, Lord, I pray that you'd give us

842
00:53:05,279 --> 00:53:11,440
an opportunity to talk with them about the gospel and about their need for Christ. I pray

843
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:15,319
