00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
And we should stand in awe of Him because of His power being displayed.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
And then the verse finishes this way.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Praise Him according to His excellent greatness.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We are to praise God because of who He is, His nature, His character,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
the fact that, yes, He has all power and all knowledge and wisdom,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and He's everywhere present.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
But we're to praise God because He is holy, because He is just and righteous,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and with Him is forgiveness, and He's ready to pardon and to forgive.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And He's a God who is full of compassion.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And often we see throughout the gospel records how the Lord Jesus Christ was moved with compassion.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And what a blessing to understand this morning

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and to be able to give God the glory and the praise that is due to His name

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
because of who He is and because of what He has done.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
A familiar psalm to many of us is Psalm 48 where the Bible begins,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and really it's a song that we sing in Psalm 48.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
in the city of our God and the mountain of His holiness.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
is Mount Zion on the sides of the north, the city of the great King.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And we see the rejoicing and the praising that begins in Psalm 48,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
but I'm always reminded of verse 14 where the Bible says,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
For this God is our God forever and ever.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
He will be our guide even unto death.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
What a blessing to know personally the God of the universe,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
that He is my God and that He is interested in me as an individual.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
He's interested in you as an individual.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
He knows where you are.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
He knows the difficulties.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
We've been studying through 2 Corinthians.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
This morning we'll be somewhere else, but we've been studying through 2 Corinthians.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000
This calendar year as we've dealt with the subject matter of the theme for our church,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
His grace is sufficient.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
And we spoke about the wonderful promise that we read in 2 Corinthians chapter 12,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
but then as we got into the first chapter,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
we started dealing with the truth that with suffering comes comfort,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
and our God knows what we're dealing with, and He loves us, and He comforts us,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
and He comes alongside us, and He provides for us the encouragement that we need.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
And what a blessing that is.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
And then last week we looked at that passage of Scripture

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
where Paul was sharing with us such transparent experience

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
that he had with his relationship with the believers in Corinth

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
and how he had been misunderstood.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And we asked the question, how do we respond when we're misunderstood?

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000
And God gives us and provides for us wonderful truth in His Word,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
and He's interested in us as individuals, and He guides us.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
If we'll allow Him, He will guide us.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
And what a blessing to understand that truth this morning.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
We serve a wonderful Savior.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
We study through the Scriptures, and especially the Gospel records,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
and we have the opportunity to see the life and ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
And as we have an opportunity to study through the Gospel records,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
we see that our Savior moved with purpose,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
and we find that He walked in humility and obedience.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
We find that He was very purposed in all that He did,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
and though there were many instances where multitudes would throng Him

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
and He would deal with feeding the thousands,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
we find that many times throughout the Gospel records

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
that Jesus records for us His interaction with individuals.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000
And what a joy to consider this morning that our God is interested in us as individuals.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
He loves the entire world.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
It's a global truth that every person that's walking upon the face of the earth today,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
that God loves them and that God desires for them to be saved by His wonderful grace.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
But we understand that He's interested in us as individuals.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
He knows us personally.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000
He knows your thoughts.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
He knows everything about you.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.000
And He says to us that we're to cast our care upon Him, for He careth for us.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
The Lord Jesus Christ lived a perfect and a sinless life,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:29.000
and He performed miracles and proved His deity that He indeed is God in flesh.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
And we find that His whole purpose of coming to this sin-cursed world

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
was to go to that cruel cross.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
We understand that He was born to die.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
We understand that even as Paul would say in the book of Galatians

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
that when the fullness of time was come,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
God sent forth His Son for what purpose?

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
To go to a cross to redeem them.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000
How could He redeem us?

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Only through going to the cross and shedding His blood.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Many times during His earthly ministry He shared with His disciples

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
about the plans and about the events that would transpire in days ahead.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
And He talked to them openly about His going to Jerusalem

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
and dying upon the cross and being buried and then resurrecting.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.000
They didn't always track and follow what Jesus was sharing,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
but we understand that Jesus was providing them with truth.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000
We find that He gave them, in John chapter number 13,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
as they're nearing His time to go to the cross,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
He gives them a great example of servanthood

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
and being a servant when He washed the feet of the disciples

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
and gave them instruction.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
And we find that we enter into the 14th chapter,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
and Jesus begins this way in John 14.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
In verse number one, He says,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Let not your heart be troubled.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.000
The reality is that all that Jesus had been explaining to His disciples

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
and all that was getting ready to transpire,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:13.000
that Jesus knew the impact that these events would have upon His own disciples.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
And He says, Let not your heart be troubled.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Now, there are times in which we may be able to say to someone else,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
we may be able to say, My heart's not troubled,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
but God knows if our heart is troubled.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
And He says, Let not your heart be troubled.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
And then He gives one of the most impactful promises

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
that we read with regard to His return.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
And He says to the disciples, and it's preserved for us today,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
and it's been a passage of Scripture that's given great hope

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000
and assurance and confidence to the people of God throughout the centuries.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Jesus says, Let not your heart be troubled.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
You believe in God? Believe also in Me.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
In My Father's house are many mansions.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
If it were not so, I would have told you.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:09.000
I go, notice where He says, to prepare a place for you.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
And I want to draw your attention to verse number three.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
And if I go and prepare a place for you,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
I will come again and receive you unto Myself,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
that where I am, there ye may be also.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
I want you to note those four words in verse number three

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
where Jesus says, I will come again.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
This, as we remember this promise,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
and we look at this passage for just a moment

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
by way of introduction this morning,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
and we consider this thought that Jesus is coming again,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000
we find that He says, I will come again.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
He didn't say, I might come again.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000
He didn't say, I may come again.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
He said, I will.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
There's an aspect of this promise that gives us this certainty,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
this confidence.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
And God wants us to be confident.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
He wants us to be certain of His promise.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
And we read last week in 2 Corinthians chapter number 1

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
as we were dealing with that passage of Scripture

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
where Paul was misunderstood,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
where he spoke of the promises of God in 2 Corinthians 1.20.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
And he says, for all the promises of God in Him are yea,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000
and in Him, amen, under the glory of God by us.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
And he says, I will come again.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000
It's a certain truth.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
It's a certain promise that God has given to us.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
But I want you to also notice that he says, I.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
I will come again.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000
I'm thankful for that certainty that I will.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
But when I think about I, Jesus says,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
I personally am going to come again.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000
We'll look at it in just a few moments.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
But in Acts 1, the angel said,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
this same Jesus shall come in like manner.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
We find that in 1 Thessalonians chapter 4,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
the Bible says, the Lord Himself.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000
What a joy to know that Jesus is coming again.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
We look at the truth of God's word,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
and it's a promise that is so precious to us.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000
And it's recorded over and over in references

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
that we have throughout the scriptures

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
with regard to this promise.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
I'm reminded of Hebrews chapter number 10

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
and verse number 37 where the Bible says,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
for yet a little while,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
and He that shall come will come

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
and will not tarry.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Jesus came the first time right on time.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
And He's going to come the second time right on time.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
No one's going to delay His arrival.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
No one is going to stay His coming.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
No, we find that He's going to come.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.000
The Bible says, yet a little while.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000
I don't know.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
You don't know how long a while is.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
But we know that God's timetable is perfect.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
In fact, we find in Acts 1,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
it's not for us to know the hour of His return.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
He's given us marching orders,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
and we'll look at some of those things in just a moment.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.239
But what a joy to be reminded for yet a little while,

00:10:03.239 --> 00:10:08.140
and he that shall come will come and will not tarry.

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:11.039
In James chapter 5 and verse number 8,

00:10:11.039 --> 00:10:13.939
the Bible says, be also patient.

00:10:13.939 --> 00:10:21.719
Establish your hearts for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.

00:10:21.719 --> 00:10:25.520
The Bible clearly teaches that Jesus is coming again.

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:27.719
I stand here today, and I believe that we're

00:10:27.719 --> 00:10:29.959
living in the last days.

00:10:29.959 --> 00:10:33.880
In fact, as we had for our theme in 2024 continue,

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.279
and I had the privilege of preaching

00:10:36.279 --> 00:10:38.880
through 1 and 2 Timothy on Sunday mornings,

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.439
and we came to 2 Timothy chapter 3,

00:10:41.439 --> 00:10:43.840
and this know also in the last days

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:45.319
there shall be perilous times.

00:10:45.319 --> 00:10:48.020
And God gives us all of that truth

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:50.979
with regard to the days in which we're living.

00:10:50.979 --> 00:10:53.759
And we understand that we're living in the last days.

00:10:53.759 --> 00:10:56.380
And I believe this morning that Jesus

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:59.500
could return at any moment.

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:03.819
In fact, I believe that he could return before I finished

00:11:03.819 --> 00:11:06.180
the sermon this morning.

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:08.459
His return is imminent.

00:11:08.459 --> 00:11:11.260
And we find that the Bible clearly teaches us

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.139
that Jesus is coming again.

00:11:14.139 --> 00:11:17.379
I've often, as I've considered that wonderful Bible promise,

00:11:17.379 --> 00:11:21.419
I've considered the question, are you ready?

00:11:21.419 --> 00:11:23.540
When someone asks you the question, are you ready,

00:11:24.279 --> 00:11:26.360
it's a question that requires context.

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:27.819
Am I ready for what?

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:33.319
And we find that this morning as we consider this truth

00:11:33.319 --> 00:11:36.879
that Jesus is coming again, I wonder this morning,

00:11:36.879 --> 00:11:38.379
are we ready for his return?

00:11:38.379 --> 00:11:41.300
Are we ready that if today were the day,

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:44.900
are we ready to see our Savior face to face?

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:49.160
We find that the great passage of scripture

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.940
in 1 Thessalonians chapter 4 that is so familiar to us,

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:54.720
and I'll read it in just a moment,

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:58.519
and begin to just understand how God wants us

00:11:58.519 --> 00:12:00.800
to be confident of this truth.

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:03.720
He wants us to be comforted by this truth.

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:06.779
In 1 Thessalonians 4, again, it's a familiar passage

00:12:06.779 --> 00:12:09.320
of scripture, but there was much confusion

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:12.559
with regard to the timing of Christ's return

00:12:12.559 --> 00:12:17.559
and the truth of this end times eschatology, if you will.

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:22.520
And we read in 1 and 2 Thessalonians much information

00:12:23.059 --> 00:12:26.660
that is given to us with regard to eschatology,

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:29.740
and as Paul, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:32.899
is instructing the church at Thessalonica.

00:12:32.899 --> 00:12:36.199
Notice with me in 1 Thessalonians 4 and verse 13,

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:38.339
it begins this way,

00:12:38.339 --> 00:12:42.779
but I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren,

00:12:42.779 --> 00:12:45.059
concerning them which are asleep,

00:12:45.059 --> 00:12:50.059
that you sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.

00:12:50.559 --> 00:12:54.919
For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again,

00:12:54.919 --> 00:12:57.919
even so them also which sleep in Jesus

00:12:57.919 --> 00:13:00.600
will God bring with him.

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:05.279
For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord,

00:13:05.279 --> 00:13:07.160
that we which are alive and remain

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:10.559
unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them

00:13:10.559 --> 00:13:12.440
which are asleep.

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:15.860
For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:18.720
with a shout, the voice of the archangel,

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:21.479
with the trump of God and the dead in Christ

00:13:21.479 --> 00:13:23.339
shall rise first.

00:13:23.339 --> 00:13:25.580
Then we which are alive and remain

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:28.100
shall be caught up together with them in the clouds

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:31.940
to meet the Lord in the air.

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:33.740
And notice these precious words,

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:38.740
and so shall we ever be with the Lord.

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:44.160
Wherefore, comfort one another with these words.

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:46.979
And oh, how comforting these words are

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.199
as God provides for us the order, if you will,

00:13:50.199 --> 00:13:52.399
of the resurrection that the dead in Christ

00:13:52.399 --> 00:13:54.679
shall rise first at the end of verse 16.

00:13:54.679 --> 00:13:56.399
Then we which are alive and remain

00:13:56.399 --> 00:13:58.279
shall be, notice, caught up,

00:13:58.279 --> 00:14:01.320
referring to and understanding this reference

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:03.720
to the rapture of the church.

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:08.720
And I hope, I hope that I'm alive during the rapture.

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.979
That'd be a wonderful thing.

00:14:10.979 --> 00:14:12.679
And it says to be caught up together,

00:14:12.679 --> 00:14:14.080
notice, with them where?

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:18.339
In the clouds to meet the Lord in the air.

00:14:18.339 --> 00:14:20.700
And so shall we ever be with the Lord.

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:23.019
This is the reference of the rapture.

00:14:23.019 --> 00:14:24.779
We're talking about Jesus coming again.

00:14:24.779 --> 00:14:26.239
We understand that his return,

00:14:26.239 --> 00:14:28.179
there's these two aspects.

00:14:28.179 --> 00:14:30.220
There's the rapture of the church,

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:33.179
and then there's the return of the Lord Jesus Christ

00:14:33.179 --> 00:14:36.380
with his saints at the end of the tribulation.

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:38.420
We read that in Revelation chapter 19,

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:41.179
when he comes all the way back to earth

00:14:41.179 --> 00:14:44.019
and the battle of Armageddon and all that takes place.

00:14:44.959 --> 00:14:46.640
And we read of that in Revelation 19,

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:50.339
but the focus of what we're dealing with this morning

00:14:50.339 --> 00:14:52.779
is dealing with that aspect of the rapture,

00:14:52.779 --> 00:14:55.679
when the church, the believers,

00:14:55.679 --> 00:14:57.459
we talk about what is the church?

00:14:57.459 --> 00:15:00.320
Well, the church is the body of believers.

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:02.000
How do I become a member of a church?

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.880
Well, I have to be saved by the grace of God.

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:07.679
I have to be baptized by immersion.

00:15:07.679 --> 00:15:10.799
And I voluntarily join myself with a church

00:15:10.799 --> 00:15:12.480
to carry out the great commission.

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:17.940
A church is made up of saved, baptized believers.

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:20.339
And we find that the church,

00:15:20.339 --> 00:15:22.619
the believers will be raptured.

00:15:22.619 --> 00:15:24.820
We do not know the time of the rapture.

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:27.820
It will be sudden, it is imminent.

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:30.619
It'll be like, as we read in 1 Thessalonians 5,

00:15:30.619 --> 00:15:31.519
a thief in the night.

00:15:31.519 --> 00:15:33.100
We'll deal with that in just a moment.

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:35.980
And we find that this event

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:39.579
is the next event on God's prophetic calendar.

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:47.480
What we believe must impact how we behave.

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.459
What we believe to be true

00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:56.839
impacts how we live our day, how we behave.

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:02.019
The Bible clearly reveals to us this truth

00:16:02.019 --> 00:16:03.619
that it would impact our belief,

00:16:03.619 --> 00:16:04.660
that we would believe.

00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:07.260
Remember already that Paul said in verse 13,

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.980
I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren.

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:12.420
He wants us, God wants us to be informed.

00:16:13.279 --> 00:16:14.119
He says in verse number 15,

00:16:14.119 --> 00:16:16.799
this we say unto you by the word of the Lord.

00:16:16.799 --> 00:16:19.959
This is not Paul just simply offering an opinion

00:16:19.959 --> 00:16:22.079
to an answer that the church in Thessalonica

00:16:22.079 --> 00:16:22.920
has posed to him.

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:27.160
No, this is God giving to his people truth

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:30.299
that would impact how we would live our lives

00:16:30.299 --> 00:16:33.440
because belief impacts behavior.

00:16:34.359 --> 00:16:36.000
So I ask myself the question,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.799
and I ask you the question this morning as well,

00:16:38.799 --> 00:16:40.619
how does the wonderful promise

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:45.640
that Jesus is coming again impact my daily behavior?

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:49.200
How does the wonderful promise

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:54.200
that Jesus is coming again impact your daily behavior?

00:16:55.859 --> 00:17:00.859
In 1 John 2, God gives us this record

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:03.799
that John, who by the way,

00:17:03.799 --> 00:17:07.899
heard the words of Jesus spoken in John 14

00:17:07.899 --> 00:17:09.640
that we referenced a moment ago.

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:14.579
John was literally there and he heard Jesus say,

00:17:14.579 --> 00:17:17.140
let not your heart be troubled.

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:20.279
He heard Jesus say, I'm going to prepare a place for you.

00:17:20.279 --> 00:17:23.220
He heard Jesus say, I will come again

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:24.779
and receive you unto myself

00:17:24.779 --> 00:17:27.100
that where I am there you may be also.

00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:29.420
John heard those precious words

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:32.700
and John was the one that God used

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:35.859
to record those precious words

00:17:35.859 --> 00:17:38.779
in the gospel of John that we read just a moment ago.

00:17:38.779 --> 00:17:41.839
So not only did he hear them verbally as they were spoken,

00:17:41.839 --> 00:17:45.100
but he had the privilege of writing them

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:47.880
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:50.399
to have for us the gospel of John.

00:17:50.399 --> 00:17:52.440
And then as he's writing this epistle

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:56.480
in 1 John 2, notice in verse 28,

00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:02.600
John says, and now little children abide in him.

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:06.920
Notice it says that when he shall appear,

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:11.739
I believe that John had all of the confidence

00:18:11.739 --> 00:18:14.980
and assurance that any individual could have

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:17.339
that Jesus was coming again.

00:18:17.339 --> 00:18:19.579
He heard it spoken with his own ears.

00:18:19.579 --> 00:18:23.820
He knew that what Jesus said was true.

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:26.859
He knew that he could not lie, that he's God.

00:18:26.859 --> 00:18:30.579
And he says that when he shall appear,

00:18:30.579 --> 00:18:32.940
notice we may have confidence

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:37.940
and not be ashamed before him at his coming.

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:41.960
I'll be honest with you this morning,

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:44.359
this verse has always challenged me.

00:18:45.239 --> 00:18:48.919
This verse has always reminded me

00:18:48.919 --> 00:18:52.440
that it is possible for a child of God

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:57.440
to be ashamed before him when he comes.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.599
Oh, I don't want to be in that position.

00:19:00.599 --> 00:19:03.020
Oh, this morning, I hope that you say,

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:05.219
I don't want to be in that position.

00:19:05.219 --> 00:19:06.580
I don't want to be embarrassed.

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:10.539
I don't want to be ashamed of my savior when he comes.

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:16.080
Notice in verse 29, if you know that he is righteous,

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:18.840
you know that everyone that do with righteousness

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:21.179
is born of him, enter the third chapter.

00:19:21.179 --> 00:19:24.979
Behold, what matter of love

00:19:24.979 --> 00:19:27.020
the father hath bestowed upon us.

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:29.479
He's actually saying to start the service,

00:19:29.479 --> 00:19:31.880
Jesus loves even me.

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:35.559
Oh, what love the father hath bestowed upon us.

00:19:35.559 --> 00:19:39.760
Notice that we should be called the sons of God.

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:41.539
Therefore the world knoweth us not

00:19:41.539 --> 00:19:42.719
because it knew him not.

00:19:42.719 --> 00:19:47.719
Beloved, now are we the sons of God.

00:19:47.799 --> 00:19:51.400
And it doth not yet appear what we shall be,

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:55.119
but we know that again, notice the words,

00:19:55.119 --> 00:20:00.119
when he shall appear, we shall be.

00:20:00.119 --> 00:20:06.839
we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is.

00:20:06.839 --> 00:20:14.459
And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself,

00:20:14.459 --> 00:20:18.759
even as he is pure."

00:20:18.759 --> 00:20:20.339
When you read verse number three,

00:20:20.339 --> 00:20:24.059
you're reminded of the truth that I mentioned a moment ago

00:20:24.059 --> 00:20:27.599
that belief will impact behavior.

00:20:27.599 --> 00:20:31.059
Every man that hath this hope, that believes this truth,

00:20:31.059 --> 00:20:35.059
that believes that Jesus is going to appear,

00:20:35.059 --> 00:20:37.859
that we shall be like Him,

00:20:37.859 --> 00:20:42.399
that that individual believer that has that hope,

00:20:42.399 --> 00:20:47.859
that he purifies himself because his Savior is pure.

00:20:47.859 --> 00:20:51.119
It impacts our behavior.

00:20:51.119 --> 00:20:53.499
As I read verse two, I'm reminded

00:20:53.499 --> 00:20:56.039
of what we read in 1 Corinthians 15,

00:20:56.059 --> 00:20:57.899
and in a moment, until we can live an eye,

00:20:57.899 --> 00:21:02.819
and we read how that this mortal shall put on immortality

00:21:02.819 --> 00:21:06.079
and this corruption shall be put on incorruption,

00:21:06.079 --> 00:21:08.619
that we shall be changed.

00:21:08.619 --> 00:21:09.459
What a blessing.

00:21:09.459 --> 00:21:13.459
We shall be like Him, it says in verse number two.

00:21:13.459 --> 00:21:15.159
We asked the question this morning,

00:21:15.159 --> 00:21:20.419
how does the promise that Jesus is coming again,

00:21:20.419 --> 00:21:22.559
how does that impact us?

00:21:22.559 --> 00:21:25.019
How does it impact me daily?

00:21:25.039 --> 00:21:30.539
Do I live each day with the awareness

00:21:30.539 --> 00:21:34.419
that Jesus could come today?

00:21:34.419 --> 00:21:38.419
I know that it's a truth that if you were to be asked

00:21:38.419 --> 00:21:41.259
this morning by an individual,

00:21:41.259 --> 00:21:44.979
someday this week by some random person

00:21:44.979 --> 00:21:46.519
that just approaches you and says,

00:21:46.519 --> 00:21:49.299
hey, listen, do you believe that Jesus is coming again?

00:21:49.299 --> 00:21:54.139
I think that each of us would without hesitation, yes.

00:21:54.139 --> 00:21:56.299
We believe it.

00:21:56.299 --> 00:22:00.379
We know it to be true.

00:22:00.379 --> 00:22:03.059
But we live in a busy world.

00:22:03.059 --> 00:22:06.299
We have so many responsibilities.

00:22:06.299 --> 00:22:09.720
We're being pulled in so many different directions.

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:16.179
And the reality is that because of those circumstances,

00:22:16.179 --> 00:22:24.379
it may very well be that we could live days consecutively,

00:22:24.379 --> 00:22:31.419
weeks, months, without even considering

00:22:31.419 --> 00:22:36.619
that today could be the day.

00:22:36.619 --> 00:22:39.059
And so how would it impact us?

00:22:39.059 --> 00:22:41.500
Just a few thoughts this morning.

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:43.220
Number one, if you're taking notes,

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:46.259
the promise of Christ's return

00:22:46.259 --> 00:22:51.259
should energize our service for him.

00:22:51.259 --> 00:22:53.099
What do I mean by that?

00:22:53.099 --> 00:22:56.259
Well, the reality is that I believe

00:22:56.259 --> 00:22:58.179
that Jesus is coming again,

00:22:58.179 --> 00:23:01.179
and you believe that Jesus is coming again,

00:23:01.179 --> 00:23:02.779
and we read the scriptures,

00:23:02.779 --> 00:23:04.619
and there's so many references,

00:23:04.619 --> 00:23:06.459
many of which I've already looked to,

00:23:06.459 --> 00:23:09.580
and many more that we could examine this morning.

00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:12.500
And we see that his return is imminent,

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:14.299
that he could come at any moment.

00:23:14.299 --> 00:23:17.819
And so that promise, that truth,

00:23:17.819 --> 00:23:21.259
should energize our service for him.

00:23:21.259 --> 00:23:25.500
The songwriter said it well when he said this,

00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:29.580
work for the night is coming.

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:30.779
Work for the night is coming.

00:23:30.779 --> 00:23:33.179
Listen, Jesus is coming again,

00:23:33.179 --> 00:23:36.899
and we have a service, a work to do for him.

00:23:36.899 --> 00:23:39.419
And this truth, this reality,

00:23:39.419 --> 00:23:42.500
this promise should energize our service.

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:45.059
It should cause us to be more engaged

00:23:45.059 --> 00:23:48.259
in doing the work that God has called us to do.

00:23:48.259 --> 00:23:51.819
I'm reminded of the truth of Ephesians 5,

00:23:51.819 --> 00:23:53.139
and verse number 16,

00:23:53.139 --> 00:23:56.779
where we're told that we are to redeem the time

00:23:56.779 --> 00:23:58.699
because the days are evil.

00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:02.940
That we literally would make each day count,

00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:06.699
that we would understand that the time

00:24:06.699 --> 00:24:08.259
that God has given to us,

00:24:08.739 --> 00:24:11.019
that life is precious,

00:24:11.979 --> 00:24:15.299
that time is limited.

00:24:17.739 --> 00:24:21.299
And we're to redeem the time because the days are evil.

00:24:21.299 --> 00:24:23.820
I wanna remind you that Jesus said in Luke 19,

00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:26.299
in verse number 13, he said this,

00:24:26.299 --> 00:24:29.779
occupy till I come.

00:24:29.779 --> 00:24:31.139
He's talking to those 10 servants.

00:24:31.139 --> 00:24:32.619
There's a parable that is given to us

00:24:32.619 --> 00:24:34.699
in that passage of Scripture,

00:24:34.699 --> 00:24:36.699
but he uses those words at the end of that verse,

00:24:36.699 --> 00:24:40.299
occupy till I come.

00:24:40.299 --> 00:24:41.739
And what does that give us?

00:24:41.739 --> 00:24:43.459
The idea of doing a work,

00:24:43.459 --> 00:24:48.339
being busy about the work that he's given to us.

00:24:48.339 --> 00:24:50.419
And I believe this morning

00:24:50.419 --> 00:24:54.500
that the promise that Jesus could return today

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:57.100
should energize our service for him.

00:25:00.459 --> 00:25:02.899
Listen, this morning, I'm thankful

00:25:02.899 --> 00:25:05.339
that when Jesus appears,

00:25:05.339 --> 00:25:08.179
when the trumpet of the Lord shall sound

00:25:08.179 --> 00:25:10.820
and I'm raptured out of here

00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:13.179
and I meet the Lord in the clouds,

00:25:13.179 --> 00:25:14.979
if that happened today,

00:25:14.979 --> 00:25:18.619
then I'm gonna ever, I'll be forever with my Savior,

00:25:18.619 --> 00:25:20.579
the one who died for me.

00:25:20.579 --> 00:25:23.779
We sing so often about seeing him face to face

00:25:23.779 --> 00:25:25.540
and what a day that will be

00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:27.419
and certainly it's gonna be a wonderful day.

00:25:27.419 --> 00:25:29.339
But I recognize this morning

00:25:29.339 --> 00:25:33.100
that once the rapture takes place,

00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:35.380
once Jesus comes again,

00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:37.899
I will never preach another sermon.

00:25:39.059 --> 00:25:41.899
I will never, I should say,

00:25:41.899 --> 00:25:45.419
the musician will never play another special,

00:25:45.419 --> 00:25:49.260
the musician will never sing another special,

00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:51.019
the nursery work,

00:25:51.019 --> 00:25:54.940
I mean, the work that God has given to us to do.

00:25:58.139 --> 00:25:59.820
I'm not gonna do it anymore.

00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:01.260
Oh, we're gonna be in his presence

00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:03.139
and we're gonna worship him for all of eternity.

00:26:03.139 --> 00:26:04.059
I mean, we're gonna,

00:26:04.059 --> 00:26:06.100
you look at Revelation 4 and 5

00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:08.339
and what a scene it is.

00:26:08.339 --> 00:26:09.260
We're gonna be with him,

00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:12.100
we're gonna worship him and it's wonderful.

00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:15.299
But the work that he's given to us

00:26:15.299 --> 00:26:19.899
for this time, for this life will cease.

00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:23.779
And so the promise of his return

00:26:23.779 --> 00:26:27.339
should energize our service for him,

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:29.500
that we make every effort

00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:33.699
to do what he's equipped us to do

00:26:33.699 --> 00:26:38.059
and to be that good steward of his manifold grace.

00:26:39.179 --> 00:26:42.220
Number two, the promise of Christ's return

00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:47.220
should cause us to engage in evangelism.

00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:49.299
Why do I say to engage in evangelism?

00:26:49.299 --> 00:26:50.459
Why do I make the distinction

00:26:50.459 --> 00:26:52.979
between engaging in evangelism

00:26:52.979 --> 00:26:55.100
versus energizing our service?

00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:58.299
Because certainly there is a connection

00:26:58.299 --> 00:27:01.859
between the two that part of my service to Christ

00:27:01.859 --> 00:27:04.139
is evangelizing the world

00:27:04.139 --> 00:27:05.500
and we understand that.

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:07.220
But I focus specifically

00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:09.299
on the second thought this morning

00:27:09.299 --> 00:27:12.059
that his promise should cause us

00:27:12.059 --> 00:27:14.619
to be engaged in evangelism

00:27:14.619 --> 00:27:18.899
because I'll never tell a sinner about Christ

00:27:18.899 --> 00:27:21.820
once the rapture takes place.

00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:23.660
Oh, during the tribulation

00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:27.139
there will be witnesses here upon the earth

00:27:27.139 --> 00:27:30.500
that many will be saved during the tribulation.

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:33.019
But recognize this morning

00:27:33.019 --> 00:27:34.940
that I'm not and you are not

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:36.299
any of those witnesses

00:27:36.299 --> 00:27:38.899
that the Bible gives us record of

00:27:38.899 --> 00:27:41.380
in the book of Revelation during the tribulation.

00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:44.699
So if I'm going to engage in evangelism,

00:27:44.699 --> 00:27:47.979
I must do it before the return of Christ.

00:27:47.979 --> 00:27:51.260
I must do it before I lay down my life,

00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:53.540
before I'm no longer here,

00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:56.019
whether that's through rapture or through death,

00:27:56.019 --> 00:27:58.899
but I must engage in evangelism.

00:27:58.899 --> 00:28:01.579
Remember with me that after

00:28:01.579 --> 00:28:04.820
the Lord Jesus Christ went to the cruel cross,

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:08.179
after He bled and suffered and died,

00:28:08.179 --> 00:28:11.299
after He paid for your sin and for my sin,

00:28:11.299 --> 00:28:13.220
that He went to that borrowed tomb.

00:28:14.059 --> 00:28:15.220
And after three days,

00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:17.459
He rose conquering sin, death, and the grave

00:28:17.459 --> 00:28:20.419
and what wonderful day that was

00:28:20.419 --> 00:28:23.579
and it's the reason that we meet on Sundays,

00:28:23.579 --> 00:28:24.779
the first day of the week.

00:28:24.779 --> 00:28:27.820
I mean, we serve a risen Savior, hallelujah.

00:28:29.299 --> 00:28:31.699
But I want to remind you that after His resurrection

00:28:31.699 --> 00:28:34.179
and during those days of His ministry

00:28:34.179 --> 00:28:35.739
before He ascended to heaven,

00:28:35.739 --> 00:28:40.739
that He gave the Great Commission.

00:28:41.779 --> 00:28:46.099
The Great Commission remains today our mandate.

00:28:47.099 --> 00:28:50.859
The Great Commission that was given by Christ

00:28:50.859 --> 00:28:54.500
to the disciples continues to this very day

00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:59.020
to be the mandate of Christ's church.

00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:00.539
He said, I will build my church

00:29:00.539 --> 00:29:03.059
and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.

00:29:03.059 --> 00:29:05.179
He said that His church is the pillar

00:29:05.179 --> 00:29:06.580
and ground of the truth.

00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:11.539
He says that His people are to be engaged in evangelism,

00:29:11.539 --> 00:29:13.900
that we are to go forth and preach the gospel

00:29:14.099 --> 00:29:16.380
to every creature.

00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:18.659
Let me remind you, we're familiar with Matthew.

00:29:18.659 --> 00:29:20.619
Let me remind you, 28,

00:29:20.619 --> 00:29:23.380
but let's look at Acts chapter one just for a moment.

00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:25.339
And I want you to look at Acts chapter one

00:29:25.339 --> 00:29:27.779
and we, of course, are reminded

00:29:27.779 --> 00:29:29.700
that each of the gospel records

00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:33.419
have a reference to the Great Commission.

00:29:33.419 --> 00:29:34.859
In the gospel of John,

00:29:34.859 --> 00:29:37.219
Jesus mentions how that He was sent

00:29:37.219 --> 00:29:39.460
and that He now sends us

00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:42.539
and what a blessing to be sent by Christ.

00:29:42.539 --> 00:29:45.099
What a blessing, as the disciples would say

00:29:45.099 --> 00:29:45.979
in the book of Acts,

00:29:45.979 --> 00:29:47.419
that we are His witnesses,

00:29:47.419 --> 00:29:50.460
that as we'll study in several weeks,

00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:51.820
maybe months as we study

00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:53.020
through the book of 2 Corinthians,

00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:54.900
that I am an ambassador.

00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:59.539
We've been given the ministry of reconciliation.

00:29:59.539 --> 00:30:07.119
In Acts 1, in verse number 6, the Bible says when they, therefore, were come together,

00:30:07.119 --> 00:30:11.819
they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to

00:30:11.819 --> 00:30:12.819
Israel?

00:30:12.819 --> 00:30:17.299
And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father

00:30:17.299 --> 00:30:19.979
hath put in his own power.

00:30:19.979 --> 00:30:23.859
Understand that right now Israel's kind of been put on the back burner, if you will,

00:30:23.859 --> 00:30:25.699
and God is dealing with the church.

00:30:25.699 --> 00:30:26.699
Why?

00:30:26.699 --> 00:30:28.139
Because Israel rejected.

00:30:28.139 --> 00:30:34.379
He came to his own, but his own received him not, and they rejected Messiah, and the church

00:30:34.379 --> 00:30:40.299
has been, Gentiles were grafted, Jewish people, Israelites can still be saved today.

00:30:40.299 --> 00:30:43.239
They must be saved by the blood of Christ.

00:30:43.239 --> 00:30:47.539
They must recognize Jesus as their Messiah.

00:30:47.539 --> 00:30:53.899
But we find that during the tribulation, after the church is raptured, guess what, Jesus,

00:30:53.899 --> 00:31:00.579
God is now dealing front and center with Israel.

00:31:00.579 --> 00:31:04.399
And so he tells them, it's not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father

00:31:04.399 --> 00:31:05.819
hath put in his own power.

00:31:05.819 --> 00:31:08.119
But notice how he answers the question.

00:31:08.119 --> 00:31:12.819
They ask, and he says, it's not for you to know, but ye shall, verse 8, receive power

00:31:12.819 --> 00:31:17.499
after the Holy Ghost has come upon you, and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem

00:31:17.499 --> 00:31:21.579
and all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth.

00:31:21.579 --> 00:31:25.859
And so he answers their question by saying, it's not for you to know, it's not for you

00:31:25.859 --> 00:31:27.939
to be concerned about, but ye shall be.

00:31:27.939 --> 00:31:30.299
This is what you should be focused on.

00:31:30.299 --> 00:31:32.379
This is what you should be concerned with.

00:31:32.379 --> 00:31:35.139
This is what your responsibility is.

00:31:35.139 --> 00:31:41.339
And when, verse number 8, he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up

00:31:41.339 --> 00:31:47.419
and a cloud received him out of their sight.

00:31:47.419 --> 00:31:53.579
As I read the Bible, there are several passages of Scripture, several events that I come to

00:31:53.579 --> 00:31:58.219
that I say something like this to myself, man, I wish I was there for that.

00:31:58.219 --> 00:32:04.019
I mean, I just read a few days ago about the crossing of the Red Sea, oh man, I wish I

00:32:04.019 --> 00:32:05.259
was there to see that.

00:32:05.259 --> 00:32:09.799
I mean, you start looking through as you read the Bible and you read these great miracles

00:32:09.799 --> 00:32:14.459
and you read about God's power being displayed, you say, oh, I wish I could have seen that,

00:32:14.459 --> 00:32:17.139
I wish I was there to witness that.

00:32:17.139 --> 00:32:22.099
And here, as I come to Acts chapter 1, that's a thought that I have.

00:32:22.099 --> 00:32:28.819
Can you imagine being there, hearing the very words of Christ, and as he's speaking those

00:32:28.819 --> 00:32:34.139
words he's taken up and out of your sight.

00:32:34.139 --> 00:32:36.619
Wow.

00:32:36.619 --> 00:32:41.899
Verse 10, while they looked steadfastly toward heaven, as he went up, behold, two men stood

00:32:41.899 --> 00:32:44.139
by them in white apparel.

00:32:44.139 --> 00:32:50.459
God looked steadfastly toward heaven as well, and I think you would too.

00:32:50.459 --> 00:33:01.299
Notice what is said by these angels, ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven?

00:33:01.299 --> 00:33:09.819
This same Jesus, what did Jesus say in John 14, I will come again.

00:33:09.819 --> 00:33:17.219
This same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner

00:33:17.219 --> 00:33:23.339
as ye have seen him go into heaven.

00:33:23.339 --> 00:33:26.379
You think that impacted these disciples?

00:33:26.379 --> 00:33:31.739
Oh, absolutely, absolutely.

00:33:31.739 --> 00:33:37.699
They see the ascension, they remember the words, but you shall receive power, you shall

00:33:37.699 --> 00:33:40.379
be witnesses unto me.

00:33:40.379 --> 00:33:47.299
They remember those words, they remember the ascension, and then they hear this same Jesus

00:33:47.299 --> 00:33:51.899
shall so come in like manner.

00:33:51.899 --> 00:34:01.419
Probably reminding them of what they heard before the crucifixion, I will come again.

00:34:01.419 --> 00:34:07.979
And we find that as you would trace the steps of the disciples through the book of Acts,

00:34:07.979 --> 00:34:19.779
I am thoroughly convinced that the truth that was given to them in Acts 1 impacted how they

00:34:19.779 --> 00:34:22.939
behaved and what they did.

00:34:22.939 --> 00:34:29.059
The Bible says that they filled Jerusalem with their doctrine.

00:34:29.059 --> 00:34:34.099
The Bible says that they turned the world upside down.

00:34:34.099 --> 00:34:41.379
The Bible tells us that when the persecution came and intensified and reached that place

00:34:41.379 --> 00:34:47.739
in Acts chapter 8 where the people were scattered, and remember, it wasn't the leaders that were

00:34:47.739 --> 00:34:52.379
scattered, no, the leaders of the church stayed in Jerusalem, it was the people that were

00:34:52.379 --> 00:34:53.379
scattered.

00:34:53.379 --> 00:34:57.999
It wasn't Peter and James that were scattered, it was the people.

00:34:57.999 --> 00:35:02.279
And when they were scattered abroad, the Bible says that they went everywhere preaching

00:35:02.279 --> 00:35:05.719
the word.

00:35:05.719 --> 00:35:09.079
The Bible records the missionary journeys.

00:35:09.079 --> 00:35:14.479
The Bible records for us as Paul would make that wonderful declaration that we're so familiar

00:35:14.479 --> 00:35:20.439
with in Romans 1 and verse 16, I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, but you know he said

00:35:20.439 --> 00:35:25.479
prior to that truth that he's not ashamed, he said that he was ready.

00:35:25.479 --> 00:35:26.479
He was ready to do what?

00:35:26.959 --> 00:35:36.719
Well, he was ready to go to Rome, he was ready to go there and to preach the gospel.

00:35:36.719 --> 00:35:42.119
Paul understood that Christ was going to return.

00:35:42.119 --> 00:35:44.919
He didn't know when, just like we don't know when.

00:35:44.919 --> 00:35:51.919
But God used Paul to write many of the references that we've already acknowledged this morning,

00:35:51.919 --> 00:35:53.919
the verses of Scripture.

00:35:53.919 --> 00:35:59.879
Paul was aware of the truth and his belief impacted his behavior and he says I'm ready

00:35:59.879 --> 00:36:00.879
to preach the gospel.

00:36:00.879 --> 00:36:05.999
I mean, when you read about Paul on the missionary journeys and you read about his desire to

00:36:05.999 --> 00:36:13.639
go to regions beyond and to preach the gospel because he understood that he had to engage

00:36:13.639 --> 00:36:16.379
people with the gospel.

00:36:16.379 --> 00:36:20.999
He had to engage in evangelism personally.

00:36:20.999 --> 00:36:25.839
Second Peter chapter three, if you take a moment in your Bible to turn there and oftentimes

00:36:25.839 --> 00:36:33.999
we read or reference at least verse number nine with regard to the promise that is given

00:36:33.999 --> 00:36:39.799
to us there and the fact that God is not slack concerning his promise and I'm thankful for

00:36:39.799 --> 00:36:42.399
that and I know that you are as well.

00:36:42.399 --> 00:36:48.359
But I want to read the context here as we pick it up in verse number one in second Peter

00:36:48.359 --> 00:36:53.359
chapter three and the Bible says this second epistle beloved I now write unto you in both

00:36:53.359 --> 00:36:58.639
which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance.

00:36:58.639 --> 00:37:03.279
They may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets and of

00:37:03.279 --> 00:37:09.759
the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Savior knowing this first that there

00:37:09.759 --> 00:37:15.439
shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lust.

00:37:15.439 --> 00:37:19.159
Oh have we not seen that?

00:37:19.159 --> 00:37:23.119
Maybe we've experienced it, scoffers.

00:37:23.119 --> 00:37:28.119
The Bible says that these scoffers that are walking after their own lust and here's the

00:37:28.119 --> 00:37:36.079
reference contextually what they say in verse number four where is the promise of his coming?

00:37:36.079 --> 00:37:40.799
For since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of

00:37:40.799 --> 00:37:47.479
the creation and notice what God tells us in verse number five for this they willingly

00:37:47.479 --> 00:37:49.119
are ignorant of.

00:37:49.119 --> 00:37:56.199
They don't want to know the truth because they want to keep believing what they're believing.

00:37:56.199 --> 00:38:00.079
And it says that by the word of God the heavens were of old and the earth standing out of

00:38:00.079 --> 00:38:04.439
the water and in the water whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water

00:38:04.439 --> 00:38:05.439
perished.

00:38:05.439 --> 00:38:06.439
You know what he references?

00:38:06.439 --> 00:38:07.439
The flood.

00:38:07.439 --> 00:38:08.439
The global flood.

00:38:08.439 --> 00:38:10.239
That's what's referenced.

00:38:10.239 --> 00:38:13.559
How many people deny the flood?

00:38:13.559 --> 00:38:15.679
Many.

00:38:15.679 --> 00:38:19.839
Verse seven, but the heavens and the earth which are now by the same word are kept in

00:38:19.839 --> 00:38:27.759
store reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.

00:38:27.759 --> 00:38:34.039
Read about the tribulation and God's wrath being poured out upon the wicked.

00:38:34.039 --> 00:38:39.119
But beloved, notice verse number eight, be not ignorant of this one thing that one day

00:38:39.119 --> 00:38:44.000
is with the Lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.719
Our God is outside of time.

00:38:46.719 --> 00:38:47.959
He's outside of time.

00:38:47.959 --> 00:38:51.320
He's eternal.

00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:55.419
Though there are some that would say as he mentions in verse number four where's the

00:38:55.419 --> 00:38:58.320
promise of his coming?

00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:02.239
He says don't be ignorant of this truth.

00:39:02.239 --> 00:39:07.959
Don't be ignorant of the fact that that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years and

00:39:07.959 --> 00:39:09.519
a thousand years as one day.

00:39:09.519 --> 00:39:13.639
Listen, Jesus is coming and he's going to come right on time.

00:39:13.639 --> 00:39:20.440
And it says in verse number nine, and what a blessing this verse is, the Lord is not

00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:25.979
slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness.

00:39:25.979 --> 00:39:34.839
But notice what the Bible says, but as long suffering to usward, not willing that any

00:39:35.159 --> 00:39:44.159
should perish, but that all should come to repentance.

00:39:44.159 --> 00:39:46.159
God is not slack concerning his promise.

00:39:46.159 --> 00:39:50.440
He is going to come again, but he's long suffering.

00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:51.440
Why is he long suffering?

00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:57.440
Well, because he's not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.

00:39:57.440 --> 00:39:59.479
With that understanding in, in

00:39:59.479 --> 00:40:05.399
2 Peter 3 and verse number 9, with the understanding of the heart of God, how that should impact

00:40:05.399 --> 00:40:07.999
us that God is long-suffering.

00:40:07.999 --> 00:40:11.119
He's not willing that any should perish, that all should come to repentance.

00:40:11.119 --> 00:40:16.639
And when I understand the promise of Christ's return, that He says, I will come again, that

00:40:16.639 --> 00:40:23.199
it should cause me, it should cause you to engage in evangelism.

00:40:23.199 --> 00:40:28.279
Because the reality is in verse number 10, but the day of the Lord will come as a thief

00:40:28.279 --> 00:40:32.679
in the night, that day is going to come.

00:40:32.679 --> 00:40:41.519
And I don't know the day and neither do you, but we do know that we have opportunity now

00:40:41.519 --> 00:40:51.399
to engage in the gospel, to engage in evangelism, to share the gospel with some neighbor, coworker,

00:40:51.559 --> 00:40:59.359
relative, whomever it may be, that God would lead us into their path.

00:40:59.359 --> 00:41:04.279
Interesting circumstances yesterday occurred, and I won't get into the details, but basically

00:41:04.279 --> 00:41:13.999
a little accident right outside of the church driveway here, and unique circumstances, but

00:41:13.999 --> 00:41:20.159
led to an opportunity to share gospel tracks and talk to one man about the Lord.

00:41:20.159 --> 00:41:24.639
I could never orchestrate those circumstances.

00:41:24.639 --> 00:41:29.039
The young man, who was 18 years old, is from another country.

00:41:29.039 --> 00:41:38.279
He's here in this country studying at Virginia Tech, and he was just here literally heading

00:41:38.279 --> 00:41:45.639
to a bus stop to take a bus back, was able to share a gospel track with him.

00:41:45.639 --> 00:41:51.679
God gives us opportunities, but we must engage in evangelism.

00:41:51.679 --> 00:41:59.959
We must understand this morning that the gospel is powerful, that people are dying and they

00:41:59.959 --> 00:42:01.799
need to hear the gospel.

00:42:01.799 --> 00:42:09.679
I believe that according to 2 Thessalonians, that those that have heard and have rejected,

00:42:09.679 --> 00:42:11.319
God's going to send them strong delusion.

00:42:11.319 --> 00:42:13.759
They're not going to be able to say, okay, now I'm going to go ahead and get saved because

00:42:13.759 --> 00:42:14.759
the rapture took place.

00:42:14.879 --> 00:42:21.879
No, God's going to send them strong delusion, and we have an opportunity to give the gospel.

00:42:21.879 --> 00:42:29.839
We've all read, I hope, we've all read at some point Revelation chapter 20.

00:42:29.839 --> 00:42:37.559
We've read about the great white throne judgment, how sad that passage of Scripture is, but

00:42:37.559 --> 00:42:43.599
it records for us an event that will take place at least a thousand and seven years

00:42:43.599 --> 00:42:47.919
from now, but it will take place.

00:42:47.919 --> 00:42:54.879
And this evening, or this morning, as I think about being engaged in evangelism, I want

00:42:54.879 --> 00:43:04.639
to be motivated by this promise of Christ's return to do more, to be more engaged, because

00:43:04.639 --> 00:43:06.639
people need the gospel.

00:43:06.639 --> 00:43:09.999
People need to hear the truth of salvation.

00:43:09.999 --> 00:43:16.119
For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God, but we have this treasure in

00:43:16.119 --> 00:43:17.519
earthen vessels.

00:43:17.519 --> 00:43:22.639
If our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost, according to 2 Corinthians chapter

00:43:22.639 --> 00:43:24.599
number 4.

00:43:24.599 --> 00:43:28.399
So how does the promise, how does it impact us?

00:43:28.399 --> 00:43:34.159
Well, it should energize our service, should cause us to engage in evangelism.

00:43:34.159 --> 00:43:39.319
Chapter number 3 this morning, the promise of Christ's return should cause us to live

00:43:39.319 --> 00:43:43.799
with expectancy, live with expectancy.

00:43:43.799 --> 00:43:46.119
Here's the thought, today could be the day.

00:43:46.119 --> 00:43:51.999
I mean, when we live every day with that expectancy that Christ could return, that today could

00:43:51.999 --> 00:43:56.119
be the very day, that's going to change how I live today.

00:43:56.119 --> 00:43:59.239
It's going to change what I do today.

00:43:59.239 --> 00:44:06.039
It's going to impact, and we find that there should be this level of expectancy, and shall

00:44:06.039 --> 00:44:08.679
I also say excitement.

00:44:08.679 --> 00:44:12.919
I mean, what a joy to know the truth of God's word.

00:44:12.919 --> 00:44:18.119
What a truth that the Lord himself shall descend from heaven, that we shall meet him in the

00:44:18.119 --> 00:44:19.119
air.

00:44:19.119 --> 00:44:23.839
I mean, I hope, as Brother Mershon often says, I'm not looking for the undertaker, but for

00:44:23.839 --> 00:44:24.839
the upper taker.

00:44:24.839 --> 00:44:33.679
I mean, oh, I hope that I'm alive when the rapture takes place, and I live with expectancy.

00:44:33.679 --> 00:44:41.679
I think the enemy wants to lull us to sleep, to think, yeah, yeah, yeah, I know Christ

00:44:41.679 --> 00:44:47.279
is going to come, but it's probably not going to happen anytime soon, and to kind of drive

00:44:47.279 --> 00:44:51.519
our stakes real deep and just, no, no, no.

00:44:51.519 --> 00:44:58.159
He is going to come, and it could be today, and I live with that expectancy.

00:44:58.159 --> 00:45:03.799
I read 1 Thessalonians 4, 13 through 18 earlier in the message, but I want to reference back

00:45:03.799 --> 00:45:11.079
to 1 Thessalonians chapter 5, and I want to share with you two truths that God gives us

00:45:11.079 --> 00:45:15.279
with regard to this idea of expectancy.

00:45:15.279 --> 00:45:18.159
In verse 1 of 1 Thessalonians 5, the Bible says,

00:45:19.159 --> 00:45:32.279
That's the one example.

00:45:32.279 --> 00:45:37.439
We read that just a moment ago in 2 Peter chapter 3 in verse number 10.

00:45:37.439 --> 00:45:44.439
This example that God is giving to us with regard to the imminence of His return and

00:45:44.439 --> 00:45:48.199
the expectancy that we should have, and then it says in verse number 3,

00:46:01.639 --> 00:46:07.839
I remember when Holly was expecting Juliana, and I remember having this thought when she

00:46:07.839 --> 00:46:14.559
would say to me, I'm having some contractions, and I had zero interest, I mean not point

00:46:14.559 --> 00:46:21.439
anything zero, zero, zero interest in delivering a baby at home or in the car.

00:46:21.439 --> 00:46:25.119
And so when she said, I'm having contractions, and I've been timing them, and they're this

00:46:25.119 --> 00:46:29.239
many minutes apart, I said, it sounds like it's time to go to the doctor.

00:46:29.239 --> 00:46:34.079
And we'd get in the car, we'd go to the hospital, and we learned, I think with Juliana, two

00:46:34.079 --> 00:46:42.399
or three different times going to the hospital to find out that it was not really happening.

00:46:42.399 --> 00:46:48.479
I was teaching Sunday school the Sunday before Juliana was born on Monday.

00:46:48.479 --> 00:46:52.759
The entire time I'm teaching Sunday school, I can see Holly, and I can see in her countenance,

00:46:52.759 --> 00:46:55.879
and I can see that she's not feeling real well.

00:46:55.879 --> 00:46:56.879
And I'm really concerned.

00:46:56.879 --> 00:47:00.199
I'm trying to get through the lesson as quickly as I can to find out what needs to happen

00:47:00.199 --> 00:47:01.199
again.

00:47:01.199 --> 00:47:06.399
I'm not interested in delivering a baby.

00:47:06.399 --> 00:47:08.999
We headed over to the hospital, and they said, no, not yet.

00:47:08.999 --> 00:47:09.999
Come back tomorrow.

00:47:09.999 --> 00:47:10.999
And they ended up inducing her.

00:47:10.999 --> 00:47:14.119
But, you know, there are many records you've read, no doubt.

00:47:14.119 --> 00:47:19.359
You've heard the stories of babies that are delivered on the side of the road as they're

00:47:19.359 --> 00:47:22.439
driving on the way to the hospital, and so on and so forth.

00:47:22.439 --> 00:47:30.079
And listen, this thing, it says that, as travail upon a woman with child, it helps us to understand

00:47:30.079 --> 00:47:35.799
this expectancy that we have, that Christ is soon going to return.

00:47:35.799 --> 00:47:40.839
In 1 Corinthians chapter 15, a passage that I referenced earlier, the Bible says it this

00:47:40.839 --> 00:47:46.199
way, in 1 Corinthians 15, in verse number 51, behold, I show you a mystery.

00:47:46.199 --> 00:47:52.839
We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an

00:47:52.839 --> 00:47:55.119
eye, at the last trump.

00:47:55.119 --> 00:48:00.239
For the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall

00:48:00.239 --> 00:48:01.599
be changed.

00:48:01.599 --> 00:48:07.799
For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this moral must put on immortality.

00:48:07.799 --> 00:48:11.999
We find in a moment, the twinkling of an eye.

00:48:11.999 --> 00:48:17.119
See, the Lord has informed us of this glorious truth.

00:48:17.119 --> 00:48:21.239
He wants us to believe that He's going to come again.

00:48:21.239 --> 00:48:27.639
He wants us to be assured of it, to be confident that Jesus is coming again.

00:48:27.639 --> 00:48:31.399
I mean, you can't talk me out of it, you can't convince me otherwise, why?

00:48:31.399 --> 00:48:35.839
Because I've got this book right here, I've read the book, I've read where Jesus said

00:48:35.839 --> 00:48:40.719
where we started this morning, I will come again.

00:48:40.719 --> 00:48:51.039
I'm convinced, I believe, but my belief and your belief must have an impact on my behavior.

00:48:51.039 --> 00:48:58.159
It must impact how I live my day, how I live and lead my life.

00:48:58.159 --> 00:49:04.679
And I wonder this morning, when we rejoice that Jesus is coming again, and we should

00:49:04.679 --> 00:49:12.000
rejoice that Jesus is coming again, but I wonder this morning, am I living, are you

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:18.159
living with the thought that today could be the day?

00:49:18.159 --> 00:49:23.519
When I consider the wonderful promise that Jesus is coming again, does it energize my

00:49:23.519 --> 00:49:24.519
service?

00:49:24.519 --> 00:49:29.440
Does it come and say, I want to do more for Christ?

00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:37.440
Do the words of the song, work for the night is coming, ring in my mind, because time is

00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:39.839
limited.

00:49:39.839 --> 00:49:46.119
It's precious, but it's limited, and it should energize my service.

00:49:46.119 --> 00:49:52.959
It should cause me to engage in evangelism, that I should be reminded that the command

00:49:52.959 --> 00:49:59.559
that Christ gave just prior to His ascension is the mandate for His church.

00:49:59.559 --> 00:50:04.799
church, that we're to go and preach the gospel to every creature, that we're to be engaged

00:50:04.799 --> 00:50:12.139
in evangelism, and then do I live with expectancy? I mean, today could be the day. What a great

00:50:12.139 --> 00:50:22.039
truth. As we live each day, help us to live with these four words in our mind, I will

00:50:22.039 --> 00:50:29.279
come again. Jesus is coming again. Are you ready? Are you ready? Are you saved? Do you

00:50:29.279 --> 00:50:34.159
know Christ as your personal Savior? I mean, you have recognized that you're a sinner,

00:50:34.159 --> 00:50:38.059
for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God, but you recognize that there's

00:50:38.059 --> 00:50:44.999
a penalty, a consequence for sin, for the wage of sin is death. Jesus died in your place.

00:50:44.999 --> 00:50:50.079
He died for you. And he offers to you the free gift, the wage of sin is death, but the

00:50:50.079 --> 00:50:55.039
gift of God's eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord, for whosoever shall call upon the

00:50:55.039 --> 00:51:02.719
name of the Lord shall be saved. You recognize that you're a sinner and he is the only Savior,

00:51:02.719 --> 00:51:09.680
and you repent and you turn from your old ways of thinking of, I could be a good person,

00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:13.000
or whatever your thoughts are with how you might be able to get to heaven, and recognize

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:17.479
it's not by works of righteousness which we have done. It's according to his mercy that

00:51:17.479 --> 00:51:31.319
it saved us, and what a joy for the promises given to us that Jesus came to save sinners.

00:51:31.319 --> 00:51:35.599
This morning, the first step for being ready for his return is that you're saved by the

00:51:35.599 --> 00:51:39.559
grace of God, that you know, that you know, that you know. If you're to die today, that

00:51:39.559 --> 00:51:43.680
heaven is your home. Oh, if you don't know for sure that heaven is your home, we'd love

00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:46.159
to be able to chat with you and be able to take a Bible and show you how you can know

00:51:46.159 --> 00:51:51.519
for sure that heaven is your home. You say, Pastor, I'm saved. I've been born again. Praise

00:51:51.519 --> 00:51:59.879
the Lord. I'm so thankful for that. Let the promise impact your behavior. Let what you

00:51:59.879 --> 00:52:07.319
believe impact how you live. Let our service be energized. Let us engage in evangelism,

00:52:07.319 --> 00:52:12.080
and let us live with expectancy. Shall we pray? Father, we love you. We thank you for

00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:18.440
loving us. We thank you for your word. We thank you for the opportunity to open your

00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:26.160
word and to have this technology, to have a live stream service. Lord, I do pray that

00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:31.779
you would work in hearts and lives, that you would help us, Lord, to be responsive in this

00:52:31.779 --> 00:52:40.000
moment of invitation. Lord, that we would examine our own hearts and our own lives and

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:51.360
our daily behavior. As we examine, we desire to be able to correct whatever might be need

00:52:51.360 --> 00:53:00.880
of correction, in need of correction. God, we would allow this wonderful promise to impact

00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:05.239
how we live each day. If there's one that's not saved, Lord, I pray that you'd give us

00:53:05.279 --> 00:53:11.440
an opportunity to talk with them about the gospel and about their need for Christ. I pray

00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:15.319
that you'd be glorified through every decision that's made, for it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:53:15.319 --> 00:53:16.399
Amen.
