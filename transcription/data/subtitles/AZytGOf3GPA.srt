1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,160
And a couple of weeks ago, of course, last week,

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,639
we had a missionary with us, Brother Josh Mead,

3
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:07,760
and thankful for the work that God is doing

4
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,039
in and through the Mead family there in Senegal.

5
00:00:10,039 --> 00:00:11,880
Thankful that God gives us an opportunity

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,680
to partner with them.

7
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,840
We dealt with, two weeks ago,

8
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,520
in 1 Timothy chapter two, verses nine through 15,

9
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,739
behavior in God's church, part one.

10
00:00:21,739 --> 00:00:25,319
This morning is behavior in God's church, part two.

11
00:00:25,319 --> 00:00:28,120
And we're looking at 1 Timothy three, verses one through 15.

12
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,959
And I wanna read to you verses 14 and 15

13
00:00:30,959 --> 00:00:32,580
by way of introduction this morning.

14
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,880
I read these verses by way of introduction

15
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,479
two weeks ago as well.

16
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:38,119
And the Bible says in verse 14,

17
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:42,119
these things write I unto you, unto thee.

18
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:44,880
And we know that God tells us in his word

19
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,759
that all scripture is given by inspiration of God

20
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:49,799
and it's profitable for us.

21
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:52,659
And God is using the apostle Paul

22
00:00:52,659 --> 00:00:55,139
to write under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God,

23
00:00:55,139 --> 00:00:58,000
a letter to Timothy, his own son of the faith,

24
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,680
a leader in the church.

25
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,400
He's there at the church at Ephesus.

26
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,400
We've already dealt with that

27
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,120
in 1 Timothy chapter number one.

28
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,760
So we understand where Timothy is

29
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,680
and we understand why God left Timothy there,

30
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,559
what his responsibility was there in Ephesus.

31
00:01:12,559 --> 00:01:14,360
There was false teaching.

32
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,080
There were all sorts of things going on.

33
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,360
And he was to give them the truth.

34
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,400
He was to preach sound doctrine.

35
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,319
We find that he had responsibilities

36
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:24,220
with helping the church.

37
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:27,220
And it says these things write I unto thee.

38
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:31,620
Notice the Bible says hoping to come unto thee shortly.

39
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:34,660
Paul's desire was to be able to go back to Ephesus,

40
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:38,059
this church that God allowed him on the missionary journey

41
00:01:38,059 --> 00:01:40,300
to see established and to help them.

42
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,839
But he's writing these things

43
00:01:41,839 --> 00:01:43,980
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God

44
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:48,660
until he can be present to instruct the church.

45
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,940
The church needed some instruction.

46
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:54,419
And so Paul is writing, in fact, in the fourth chapter,

47
00:01:54,419 --> 00:01:56,059
the memory verse of the month of April,

48
00:01:56,059 --> 00:01:59,739
till I come, give attendance to reading,

49
00:01:59,739 --> 00:02:01,900
to exhortation, to doctrine.

50
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,980
When Paul mentions till I come,

51
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:06,720
really you look at this verse in chapter number three

52
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,660
and verse number 14 when he says,

53
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:11,660
I'm hoping to come unto thee shortly

54
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:14,539
until I can get there, keep on doing these things,

55
00:02:14,539 --> 00:02:18,039
chapter four, but I'm writing you these things.

56
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:19,779
Notice verse number 15.

57
00:02:19,779 --> 00:02:21,779
He says, but if I tarry long.

58
00:02:21,779 --> 00:02:22,720
Now I'm thankful.

59
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,720
There are sometimes you hear somebody talk about Jesus

60
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,360
tarrying his coming.

61
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,759
The Bible says that Jesus said he will not tarry, amen?

62
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:33,580
So you hear, and I'm not trying to split hairs,

63
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:36,399
but when somebody says, if he tarries his coming,

64
00:02:36,399 --> 00:02:38,559
understand he's not going to, amen?

65
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:40,679
Jesus is coming right on time.

66
00:02:40,679 --> 00:02:43,039
By the way, I thought it was gonna be last week, hallelujah.

67
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:45,320
It didn't happen, we're still going, amen?

68
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,919
And we're still serving the Savior,

69
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:49,139
redeeming the time for the days are evil.

70
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:51,360
We understand all of that, but we're looking,

71
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,759
we're expecting to hear, come up hither, amen?

72
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:56,080
Praise the Lord.

73
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,639
Jesus is not gonna tarry his coming,

74
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:02,860
but Paul says, if I tarry long,

75
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:07,759
if my circumstances do not allow me to get there to Ephesus

76
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:11,639
the church is in need of some instruction,

77
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:13,119
so I'm writing these things.

78
00:03:13,119 --> 00:03:17,639
Notice why, that thou mayest know

79
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:22,039
how thou oughtest to behave thyself.

80
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:26,119
Notice the Bible says, in the house of God, amen?

81
00:03:26,119 --> 00:03:31,119
It's God's church, which is the church of the living God,

82
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:35,639
the pillar and ground of truth.

83
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:38,720
So thankful that Jesus Christ is truth.

84
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,100
I am the way, the truth, and the life,

85
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,559
but I'm so thankful that he's given us the Bible,

86
00:03:43,559 --> 00:03:44,520
which is truth.

87
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:46,759
He said, sanctify them through thy word.

88
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:49,960
Thy word is truth.

89
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,279
And what a blessing to understand the instruction

90
00:03:53,279 --> 00:03:56,380
that has been given, that thou mayest know

91
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:59,160
how thou oughtest to behave thyself.

92
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,820
And so there is proper behavior in God's house.

93
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:06,440
There is a behavior that is appropriate in God's house.

94
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:10,119
There is behavior that is inappropriate in God's house.

95
00:04:10,119 --> 00:04:10,960
Amen?

96
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,919
And we understand that.

97
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,520
We see in the day and age in which we're living,

98
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,639
I dealt with it a few weeks ago.

99
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:17,799
I mentioned the comment in one of the messages

100
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,959
about some things that have happened

101
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:23,519
in churches around our land

102
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:27,220
that are absolutely irreverent.

103
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:32,019
They are just absolutely inappropriate.

104
00:04:32,019 --> 00:04:35,839
God says, I'm using Paul to write this letter

105
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:38,399
so that you know how you ought to behave.

106
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:43,399
Now understand that God has preserved this letter

107
00:04:43,559 --> 00:04:47,179
of 1 Timothy for every church throughout the church age

108
00:04:47,179 --> 00:04:51,160
to have this instruction so that we would understand.

109
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,320
At the end of chapter number two,

110
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,640
as we dealt with last week,

111
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,720
we find that specifically that text of scripture

112
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,480
addresses women in the church.

113
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,320
As we move into chapter number three,

114
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,600
dealing with behavior in God's church,

115
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,000
we find that as we continue this study,

116
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,920
we discover that more instruction

117
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,019
is being provided to the local church.

118
00:05:09,019 --> 00:05:10,440
We understand that here,

119
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,480
God is going to give some instruction

120
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,600
with regard to the officers in the church,

121
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,760
to leadership in church.

122
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:22,359
Now we understand that the church was instituted by God.

123
00:05:22,359 --> 00:05:23,839
It's important to understand.

124
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,480
The church was instituted by God.

125
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,880
The church is not man's idea.

126
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,700
Amen?

127
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,279
The church didn't start with Constantine.

128
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:33,119
Amen?

129
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,200
The church is God's idea.

130
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:41,200
He, Jesus Christ, said I will build my church

131
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:46,679
and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it

132
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:47,839
in Matthew 16.

133
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,779
So the church is instituted by God,

134
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:55,799
but we also understand that God has graciously provided

135
00:05:55,799 --> 00:06:00,799
instruction for his church in his word.

136
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:02,399
How's the church to function?

137
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:03,880
How's the church to operate?

138
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,359
It's not man's institution.

139
00:06:05,359 --> 00:06:07,519
That man designed.

140
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:09,959
So it's not man's duty to determine

141
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:11,320
how a church is to function.

142
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,640
God provided that instruction.

143
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,920
By the way, we ought to be thankful for that.

144
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,760
Amen?

145
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,880
And we ought to go to the source that God gave us

146
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,440
and say here is the source and this dictates to us,

147
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,600
and yes, I choose that word on purpose

148
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,480
because God has the right to dictate

149
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,760
how his church is to function.

150
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,920
It's his church.

151
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:35,200
By the way, we understand that Jesus Christ gave himself

152
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,679
for the church.

153
00:06:36,679 --> 00:06:37,519
Amen?

154
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:39,119
Ephesians chapter number five.

155
00:06:39,119 --> 00:06:43,720
We understand that Jesus Christ is the head of the church.

156
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,000
Colossians chapter number one,

157
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,920
the book of Ephesians deals with that as well.

158
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,519
We understand that one day,

159
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:53,920
Jesus is coming back for his church

160
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,839
and then one day Jesus is coming back with his church.

161
00:06:57,839 --> 00:06:58,799
Amen?

162
00:06:58,799 --> 00:07:00,200
Hallelujah.

163
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,040
We're gonna come back, you read Revelation 19,

164
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,679
we're coming back with him.

165
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,200
Hallelujah.

166
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,959
And we find this morning that this era in which we're living

167
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:11,839
that some theologians have used the term

168
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:15,160
that we would say that we're living in the church age

169
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,839
or the church era.

170
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:19,160
And we find that in this particular time,

171
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,160
after the ascension of Jesus Christ

172
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,279
and before the rapture of the church,

173
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:26,000
that this time that is not known

174
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,040
exactly how long it will be,

175
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,359
we know the tribulation will be seven years,

176
00:07:30,359 --> 00:07:32,480
we know that the millennium will be a thousand years,

177
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:33,920
the church age,

178
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,480
we don't know how long it's going to begin or to be,

179
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:41,160
but during this era, this time of the church age,

180
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,959
God has designed it that the church is the organism

181
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:49,920
that God is using for this day and age.

182
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:52,359
The church is important.

183
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,440
It's the bride of Christ.

184
00:07:57,559 --> 00:08:00,559
Church is not something that we just do.

185
00:08:00,559 --> 00:08:02,440
Church is not something that we just kind of have

186
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,200
a membership like we do at some other place

187
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,600
where we just kind of belong to.

188
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,880
You know, I have a gym membership,

189
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,839
I ain't been there for like six months.

190
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:14,399
But I'm still a member.

191
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:15,640
I haven't been there in so long,

192
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,799
I took the key tag off my key.

193
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,559
And I saw just last week, they charged me.

194
00:08:21,559 --> 00:08:22,640
I said, I better start going

195
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,559
or cancel the membership, amen.

196
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,359
That's not church.

197
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,959
Church is the bride of Christ.

198
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:32,679
Church isn't just a club.

199
00:08:34,119 --> 00:08:35,679
Church isn't just a place where we come

200
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,880
and just kind of social gathering.

201
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,080
I'm thankful for the fellowship

202
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,799
of brothers and sisters in Christ, amen.

203
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,479
But understand the church is something different than that.

204
00:08:45,479 --> 00:08:47,039
Listen, you can get together during the week,

205
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:49,239
you can have fun and games and do that sort of thing.

206
00:08:49,239 --> 00:08:52,679
But when we come to church, we're coming to worship Christ.

207
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:54,919
We're coming to exalt the Lord Jesus Christ.

208
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:56,200
We understand we come together,

209
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,320
we gotta follow what God's pattern is

210
00:08:59,359 --> 00:09:03,320
that he's established in his word with regard to leadership.

211
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,239
And we see that instruction here.

212
00:09:05,239 --> 00:09:09,039
We are to be subject to Christ in all things.

213
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:12,599
As believers individually, but then as a church,

214
00:09:12,599 --> 00:09:14,039
we're to be subject to Christ.

215
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:16,080
We understand that he has instituted leadership

216
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,159
for his church.

217
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:19,039
We believe that the Bible clearly teaches

218
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:22,119
there are two offices in the local church.

219
00:09:22,119 --> 00:09:23,760
These offices are identified

220
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,159
and we find that qualifications

221
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:26,719
for those filling the position

222
00:09:26,719 --> 00:09:29,799
are clearly outlined in his word.

223
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:30,919
We find here this morning

224
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:32,679
in 1 Timothy chapter number three

225
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:34,280
and verses one through,

226
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,760
we're gonna go down through verse number 15,

227
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,760
but really down through verse number 13

228
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,119
are the two offices described, defined,

229
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:43,960
and we find that the qualifications are listed.

230
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,159
What are the two offices?

231
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:48,000
Well, we believe the Bible teaches very plainly and clearly

232
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
that there's the office of the pastor

233
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,840
and there's the office of a deacon.

234
00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:55,880
Those are the two offices that God has outlined.

235
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,719
Let me first address the matter of title.

236
00:09:58,719 --> 00:10:00,520
This is all by way of introduction.

237
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,400
The points are easy this morning,

238
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,600
but let me just deal with this this morning,

239
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,360
because unfortunately there are some that teach

240
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:12,700
that bishops and elders are different offices.

241
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,840
Okay, you may hear someone say that,

242
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,940
you may be exposed to that.

243
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:19,520
In fact, I've heard somebody that's very well known

244
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,420
on a radio broadcast in recent months

245
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:25,820
make a statement about the error of our Baptist brethren

246
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:28,720
that do not have elders and bishops.

247
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,180
And let me explain to you this morning

248
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:35,160
why we believe that the Bible teaches

249
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,440
that there's an office of pastor

250
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,800
and there's an office of deacon.

251
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,320
Why is it that God has provided us

252
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,560
with these different words, bishop and elder,

253
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,260
that we see in the New Testament?

254
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:51,400
I believe that God is giving those two words

255
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,960
to help us understand the role and responsibility

256
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:59,200
of the individual that fills the office.

257
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,760
Does that make sense this morning?

258
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,960
So we find that the word pastor,

259
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:07,120
the word elder, the word bishop,

260
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,360
those words are all words that are describing

261
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,600
the office of a pastor, the duties and responsibilities.

262
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,880
Why is it that we believe that?

263
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,720
Well, we believe that, remember as a Baptist,

264
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,860
we would say that the Bible is our sole authority

265
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,960
for faith and practice.

266
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:27,320
So as we determine what our polity will be,

267
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:31,000
the structure, the leadership organization

268
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,360
within a local church,

269
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:36,680
it's not just that we're following some man-made traditions.

270
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,760
No, we wanna go to what the Bible says

271
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,200
because the Bible is our sole authority

272
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,120
for faith and for practice.

273
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,160
The word bishop and the word elder

274
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,200
are used interchangeably in the New Testament.

275
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,480
And as those two words are used interchangeably

276
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,760
in the New Testament,

277
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,920
it helps us to explain and understand the work,

278
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,720
the duty of the one that's in that office.

279
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,360
I'm being a little technical this morning

280
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,300
by way of introduction,

281
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,680
but I hope that we understand the importance

282
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,200
of this principle this morning

283
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,080
because there is much confusion

284
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,760
that is out there this morning

285
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,960
with regard to church polity

286
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:17,560
or leadership structure in a local church.

287
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:21,000
Someone may say to you, well, who are your elders?

288
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,240
Well, our pastor is, no, but who are your elders?

289
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,480
They might wanna make that distinction.

290
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,840
And we understand biblically, again,

291
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,360
the word bishop and elder are used interchangeably.

292
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,840
Go over to the book of Acts, if you will.

293
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,440
Keep your place in 1 Timothy.

294
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,160
And we find that it's here that it uses the word bishop,

295
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,860
the office of a bishop.

296
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:41,240
But turn to the book of Acts in chapter number 20.

297
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,800
And I use this portion of scripture for two reasons.

298
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:48,640
One, Paul is writing to Timothy who's there in Ephesus.

299
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,800
And Acts chapter number 20 is a record

300
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,380
where Paul is having a communication and interaction

301
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:59,280
with the leaders of the church at Ephesus.

302
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,440
And so it's insightful

303
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,400
as we look at this passage of scripture.

304
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:06,320
In verse number 17, notice in Acts 20 and verse 17,

305
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,300
Paul is desiring to go to Jerusalem

306
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,560
to be there for Pentecost according to verse 16.

307
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,280
He does not have time to go to Ephesus.

308
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,340
But there's a message that he needs to deliver

309
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:18,820
to the leaders of the church at Ephesus.

310
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,260
Therefore he calls, according to verse 17,

311
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,500
it says, for Miletus, he sent to Ephesus

312
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,860
and called the elders of the church.

313
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,220
Do you see that in your Bible?

314
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:31,120
He called the elders of the church.

315
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,100
And then it says in verse 18,

316
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,440
and when they were come to him.

317
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,920
Now, if he called for the elders,

318
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,900
do you think the elders came?

319
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,320
Just kind of makes sense that they,

320
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,060
in verse number 18, that came

321
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,340
are the ones that were called for.

322
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,940
And those elders come and Paul begins,

323
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,300
it says that he said unto them.

324
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,720
Now we don't have time to read all of it.

325
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,660
We're not preaching from Acts 20 this morning,

326
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:56,660
but Paul begins to instruct these leaders

327
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:57,960
of the church at Ephesus,

328
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,500
as it's referred to in verse 17,

329
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,800
the elders of the church at Ephesus.

330
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,380
As we come down to verse number 28,

331
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:09,500
notice the charge as Paul is wrapping up his charge here,

332
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,700
this admonition to these church leaders.

333
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,140
He says in verse 28,

334
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:17,060
take heed therefore unto yourselves

335
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,740
and to all the flock over the witch,

336
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:24,540
the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers.

337
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,760
Now, do you see that word overseer?

338
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,720
That word is bishop.

339
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,060
It's translated overseer

340
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:35,220
because that's what bishop means, okay?

341
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,700
In the book of 1 Timothy chapter three,

342
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,220
when it says, if you desire an office of a bishop,

343
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:44,040
it's the same Greek word that we see here, overseer.

344
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,460
Okay, so he called for the elders,

345
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,140
but he says to the elders

346
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:53,560
that God hath made you overseers or the bishop.

347
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,380
Are we tracking?

348
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:58,480
To look, feed the church of God,

349
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,900
which he hath purchased with his own blood.

350
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,860
And we're gonna look at that last phrase,

351
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,060
to feed the church of God,

352
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,780
and really that helps us understand

353
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,780
some of the role of the pastor.

354
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:15,080
Again, the word that would be used only in our New Testament

355
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,500
in Ephesians four and verse number 11,

356
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,340
where he says, and he gave some apostles,

357
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:23,340
but then he says pastors and teachers.

358
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,340
It's the only place you're gonna find the word pastor

359
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,900
in the New Testament.

360
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,860
But you find that the pastor,

361
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:32,620
as we would outline the responsibility

362
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,220
and the word that is used there,

363
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:37,620
is the one that's shepherding or feeding the flock.

364
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:41,580
So the pastor has the responsibility

365
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:45,420
as the bishop of being the overseer.

366
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:49,220
There's a lot of matters that need to be overseen.

367
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,580
The elder, the principal official,

368
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,780
or the spiritually mature individual

369
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:56,060
that's shepherding the flock of God.

370
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:58,260
Notice as we look at this text in Acts 20,

371
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,700
but then turn to 1 Peter chapter five,

372
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,940
and notice what Peter says in 1 Peter chapter five.

373
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,540
Keeping in mind what we've just read there

374
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,420
in Acts chapter number 20,

375
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:13,620
Peter begins to address at the end of this letter

376
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:17,460
that he's writing, he addresses the elders specifically.

377
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:20,100
Notice in chapter five in verse number one.

378
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,220
1 Peter five in verse number one.

379
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:30,260
The Bible says, the elders which are among you I exhort.

380
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:33,580
Who am also an elder?

381
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,900
And a witness of the sufferings of Christ

382
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:40,220
and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed.

383
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,380
Notice what he says to the elder.

384
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,740
That's what he references.

385
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:48,740
Feed the flock of God, which is among you,

386
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:52,420
taking the oversight thereof.

387
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:56,220
Remember, the bishop is the overseer.

388
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,980
Taking the oversight thereof,

389
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:00,460
not by constraint but willingly,

390
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:03,420
not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind.

391
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:07,380
Neither as being lords over God's heritage,

392
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,980
but being in samples to the flock.

393
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:14,820
And when the chief shepherd shall appear, hallelujah.

394
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:17,220
He's the chief shepherd, he's the head of the church.

395
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:20,120
The word under shepherd is never used in the New Testament,

396
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,460
but we have used that terminology

397
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,620
to describe the office of the pastor.

398
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:27,780
That he's the under shepherd.

399
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,220
Why would we use,

400
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,540
why did the term get coined the under shepherd?

401
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:34,380
Well, because Christ is the chief shepherd.

402
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,500
So the pastor is the under shepherd because notice,

403
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,440
it says when the chief shepherd shall appear,

404
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,820
we shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.

405
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:46,380
Who is ye that Peter is referring to in verse number four?

406
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,580
Well, the elders that he's exhorting.

407
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:52,260
This is an opportunity to receive a crown,

408
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,060
a crown of glory that fadeth not away,

409
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:56,900
that's reserved for the one that fills that office

410
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:01,100
and fulfills it properly, biblically.

411
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:05,540
And so as we pay close attention to the words of scripture

412
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:09,780
and understand how God uses these terms interchangeably,

413
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:12,000
it helps us to understand as we come back

414
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,940
to 1 Timothy chapter number three,

415
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:17,340
it helps us to understand that these aren't different

416
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:20,420
offices, but they are words that are used

417
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:24,840
to describe the responsibility of the individual

418
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,320
that fills the office.

419
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,780
Are we tracking this morning?

420
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:33,700
As we come back to 1 Timothy chapter number three,

421
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:37,619
we pay close attention to the language that God uses

422
00:18:37,619 --> 00:18:42,619
in this passage because he's going to provide Paul,

423
00:18:42,619 --> 00:18:44,540
of course, all scripture is given by inspiration of God,

424
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,220
so God is using, it's God's word he's using,

425
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:50,300
Paul is writing to Timothy and he's providing him

426
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:55,300
with qualifications for the officers in his church.

427
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,619
The first one, if you're taking notes,

428
00:18:58,619 --> 00:19:00,660
the two points this morning are very easy,

429
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:04,260
the office of a bishop and the office of a deacon.

430
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,100
All right, those are the two points.

431
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,940
I'm not gonna say a whole lot about

432
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,780
those particular points, I'm gonna give you

433
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:13,340
some information, look at what the Bible says

434
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:17,540
in verse number one, this is a true saying.

435
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:20,500
Aren't you thankful that God's word is true?

436
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,020
Amen, this isn't just Paul coming up with,

437
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,900
you know, there's a structure problem,

438
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,980
an organizational issue, the org chart is off

439
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,580
and so I'm gonna give you my, no, no, no,

440
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,020
this is God's word, God's instruction.

441
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:34,460
He says it's a true saying, notice where he says

442
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:39,460
if a man desire the office of a bishop,

443
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:42,940
he desireth a good work.

444
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:46,059
It's a good work, it's an honorable work.

445
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:48,860
And the one, the man that would fill that position,

446
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:51,900
the office of a bishop, as it's noted here,

447
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,980
it is an honorable work and it is an honorable position.

448
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:58,780
And we find that as Paul is writing,

449
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,540
he says the office.

450
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:06,060
of a bishop. And so we have to understand again the office that is being spoken of

451
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:12,220
when we speak about this structure or this polity within the local church. He then says

452
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:22,140
in verse number two, a bishop then, notice this phrase, must be. Must be. The qualifications

453
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:27,580
that God is going to give, the requirements that are laid out in this portion of Scripture

454
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:34,460
are not just good ideas or good thoughts. These qualifications or requirements, I would say,

455
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:38,460
I've said it this way before, they're non-negotiable. It's not a situation where you say,

456
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:43,900
well, this person is just, man, they're a good orator. I mean, they have a bubbly personality

457
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:49,980
and they just seem to be able to draw people to themselves. And man, they just, they can organize

458
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:55,340
well and they're a natural born leader. Do you know none of what I just said is in First

459
00:20:55,340 --> 00:21:05,020
Timothy chapter three? It's not there. Now, is it good? Does God gift and equip those who He calls?

460
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:12,060
I believe He does. By the way, the Bible tells us the Holy Ghost, the Holy Spirit gives gifts

461
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:19,580
as He will. And God can equip the man. But the man must be qualified. Just because, I said this

462
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:24,140
in Sunday school, just because a man desires the office doesn't mean he's qualified for the office.

463
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:33,340
There's a list that's provided. The requirements, as we look here, are specific. I would say it this

464
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:37,740
way, they really deal with the character of the individual. Can I say to you this morning,

465
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:43,980
character matters? Can I say to you this morning, that as we look at this passage of Scripture

466
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:49,100
and we deal with the office of a bishop and the office of a deacon and we understand the structure

467
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:54,460
that God establishes for His church, that it's also important that we understand that these

468
00:21:54,460 --> 00:22:00,780
qualifications that are outlined are good things for every child of God to desire to be true of

469
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:10,460
them? Amen? God holds a high standard for His people. We represent the Lord Jesus Christ.

470
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:16,540
God holds a high standard for the one that would fill the office of a bishop or a deacon,

471
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:21,580
and it's outlined specifically. Why does God give the specifics? Why does God provide

472
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:28,860
us with these specifics? Well, because He wants us to understand as Timothy is there in Ephesus

473
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:33,740
seeking to set in order some things, just as we see with Titus, we're going to flip over to Titus

474
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:39,980
in just a moment, just as we see Titus is given that responsibility, that God has structure. By

475
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:46,540
the way, I'm thankful that our God is a God of order. Amen? He does all things decently

476
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:52,860
and in order. Our God is a God of order. Hold your place here, turn over just a few pages to the book

477
00:22:52,860 --> 00:23:00,140
of Titus, if you will, and notice in Titus chapter number 1, beginning in verse number 5, now Paul

478
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:03,500
is writing to Titus here, again under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God.

479
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:09,900
Titus is not in Ephesus and Timothy is not in Crete,

480
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:15,820
but Timothy in Ephesus has some things, responsibilities that he has to do, and Titus

481
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:21,820
in Crete has some responsibilities, some things he's supposed to fulfill, and interestingly enough,

482
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:26,300
there's some similarities between what's going on in Crete and what's going on in Ephesus,

483
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:34,140
and so God leaves these people, these servants there in order to set some things in order. Notice

484
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:40,940
in verse number 5 of Titus 1, for this cause left I thee in Crete. For what cause? That thou

485
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:48,620
shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, notice, and ordain elders in every city

486
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:55,420
as I have appointed thee. If any be blameless, and he gets into those particular qualifications.

487
00:23:55,420 --> 00:24:00,220
It's interesting that he says ordain elders in verse number 5, but then notice in verse number

488
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:06,300
7, for a bishop must be. Again, do you understand, as we've noted already over in the book of Acts,

489
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:11,340
and we've gone over the book of 1 Peter, that God uses those terms interchangeably.

490
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:17,180
We're not going to look at the entirety of Titus 1, 5 through 9, and look through those. We're

491
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:21,340
going to do that in chapter 3 of the book of 1 Timothy, but we find that the requirements are

492
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:27,020
specific, and God deals with, I would characterize it this way, he deals with not only the public

493
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:31,260
life of the one that would have the office of a bishop, but also the private life.

494
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:40,060
God is concerned about those who hold an office of leadership of authority in his church. And by

495
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:46,460
the way, he should be. He has every right to be. He has every right to list out the qualifications.

496
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:53,580
We find, the Bible says back in 1 Timothy chapter 3 and verse number 2, a bishop then must be

497
00:24:53,580 --> 00:25:00,460
blameless. I'm not going to give the explanation for every one of these. We'd be weeks in this

498
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:04,860
chapter. I don't have time. We're trying to get through 1 and 2 Timothy. I've taught through this

499
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:09,260
before, but understand the word blameless doesn't mean that someone can't blame you for something.

500
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:15,660
It means that you're in that place where it doesn't stick, right? You have a good report.

501
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:20,940
Listen, understand also, as we look through this passage of Scripture, that the bishop and also the

502
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:26,940
deacon, the level of qualification is not perfection. If it were perfection, then no one

503
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:33,260
would be qualified. Jesus Christ is the only one that's ever walked on this earth that's been perfect.

504
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:38,860
Amen? And some people are looking for a perfect pastor. They're looking for a perfect church.

505
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:47,740
And they're an imperfect person. And they're going to find an imperfect pastor, an imperfect church.

506
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:51,500
By the way, if you find a perfect church and you try to join it, you're going to mess it up

507
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:56,060
because you're not perfect. You say, I can't believe you'd say that.

508
00:25:56,620 --> 00:26:03,900
We're not perfect. Amen? None of us are perfect. But the character of the individual is what's

509
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:09,180
under the microscope. We find that he deals with the private life and the public life. He says they

510
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:16,620
must be blameless, the husband of one wife. There's been much discussion about that over the centuries

511
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:21,420
with regard to the understanding of this particular phrase, the husband of one wife. It's

512
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:26,220
said there of a deacon as well. And there's some that say, well, it just means one wife at one time.

513
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:33,580
I believe that it's a one woman man. It's not somebody that's given to all of these

514
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:41,660
inappropriate type of situations. God says that there's one man and one woman, one lifetime.

515
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:51,740
Amen? We find that he says husband of one wife, notice vigilant, sober, of good behavior,

516
00:26:53,260 --> 00:27:01,900
given to hospitality, apt to teach. Remember what he said? I'm going to pause just for a moment.

517
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:06,380
Remember what he said in verse 7 of chapter 1 about those false teachers they had swerved and

518
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:11,340
turned aside into vain jangling? He said, desiring to be teachers of the law, understanding neither

519
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:16,700
what they say nor whereof they affirm. So one of the qualifications, they're apt to teach,

520
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:22,940
not given to whine, no striker. That'd be a bad thing. You see the picture of your pastor on the

521
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:30,620
news because he got in a fight. No, no striker, not brawler. It says that in verse number 3 as well.

522
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:39,020
Not greedy, a filthy lucre, but patient, patient, not a brawler, not covetous.

523
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:43,660
So we look at verse 2 and 3 and we list very quick bullet points that are given,

524
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:48,380
and we find again that the scriptures are dealing with the character of the individual,

525
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:55,180
the private life, the public life. We find that he says of this one that would desire the office

526
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:59,660
of a bishop, that he desireth a good work, but then there's some qualifications, there's some

527
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:08,140
requirements. So Timothy, so Titus over in Crete, as you're going to put people in position of

528
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:14,540
leadership, understand that there's some criteria that must be met, that these are

529
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:20,380
non-negotiable, that these are requirements that God sets forth. We find that it says,

530
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:27,260
again, if we even look at those things in verse 2 and 3, that it's an examination process,

531
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:35,100
that a person, a man that desires that office, they ought to be willing to prove themselves.

532
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:42,540
It says in verse 4, one that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all

533
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:49,100
gravity, for if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church

534
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:55,820
of God? Noticing again the private life, he talks about one that ruleth well his own house. Let me

535
00:28:55,820 --> 00:29:01,660
say this, the children of a pastor are not going to be perfect either, just like your children

536
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:08,620
aren't perfect. You know that through the decades that there's been a problem in some of our

537
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:13,820
churches where there's an expectation of the children of a pastor that are different than

538
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:19,820
children of other people within the church. I'm thankful that as we've had the opportunity to

539
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:27,900
raise our family here that I personally never dealt with that, where someone, some group of

540
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:33,100
folks within our church would want to hold my children to a different, higher standard than

541
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:38,860
their children. The fact of the matter is that they're not going to be perfect, but notice what

542
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:43,980
the Bible says in verse number 5, for if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he

543
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:50,540
take care of the church of God? It's a very practical question that's laid out. You understand

544
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:54,860
that the pastor has the responsibility, as we outline here, some of these responsibilities

545
00:29:54,860 --> 00:30:00,380
that also give insight to the, some of these requirements that give insight to the responsibilities.

546
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:05,300
the pastors to take care of the church of God.

547
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:08,780
Paul makes this comment in 2 Corinthians as he's writing to the church in Corinth.

548
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:13,500
He talks about all of those things that came upon him daily, but then he says, or all of

549
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:19,100
the various trials and difficulties and persecutions that he faced, but then he says, and that

550
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:23,540
which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches.

551
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:27,140
The pastor has the responsibility to care for the church of God.

552
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:33,180
Qualifications continue, not a novice, why?

553
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:39,100
Lest being lifted up with pride, he fall into the condemnation of the devil.

554
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:45,020
Listen, we understand this morning that there's no particular time that's listed with regard

555
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:50,500
to how long a person, a man has to be saved before he can be a pastor, but the Bible clearly

556
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,780
says not a novice, amen?

557
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:58,100
And it gives us the reason why, again, as God, God didn't have to give us the reason

558
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:02,060
why, by the way, but He did graciously.

559
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:06,860
He tells them later in this book, lay hands on no man suddenly.

560
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:12,420
Some have believed that to believe not to ordain people hastily, not, you know, there

561
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:16,540
are times in which somebody's like, man, we haven't had a pastor for so long, just anybody

562
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:21,620
that's willing to fill the position, just somebody do it.

563
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:28,180
When I finished Bible college, I had the opportunity to preach for one of my professors

564
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:30,980
in a number of different churches.

565
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:36,580
Never, as I went to any of those churches, was I going as a potential candidate for any

566
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:37,580
of those churches.

567
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:42,620
I had just graduated from Bible college, but I was seeking to help him in a ministry that

568
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:45,860
he was doing, but also to get some experience with preaching.

569
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:48,300
It was a great opportunity.

570
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:51,340
There were a number of churches that he was working with that didn't have pastors, and

571
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:57,700
he would work with pastors and try to kind of pair the two together, if you will.

572
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:01,980
And I remember going to some churches, and Holly would travel with me, and as we would

573
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:05,420
travel to go to these churches, we would find that there were some churches that didn't

574
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:08,260
have a pastor for two or three years.

575
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:11,100
That's a tragic situation.

576
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:16,660
And unfortunately what happens in a church like that is sometimes 1 Timothy 3 kind of

577
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:21,220
gets set aside because we just want a pastor.

578
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,820
Usually they'd be willing to do it.

579
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:25,780
No, God sets forth requirements.

580
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:32,300
He gives us these qualifications, and it's important that we understand that God provides

581
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,300
these to us.

582
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:38,820
He says, moreover, notice verse number 7, he must, he uses that word again, have a good

583
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:43,340
report of them which are without.

584
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:44,340
Now that's interesting.

585
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:49,340
Remember, I've talked to you that it's dealing with the private life and the public life.

586
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:53,700
The pastor not only has a good report of those within, but it says, it actually doesn't

587
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:58,980
say that, but it says a good report of them without, lest he fall into reproach and the

588
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:02,620
snare of the devil.

589
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:10,260
The pastor ought not be known in the community as being a bad person, a wicked person.

590
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:14,580
In fact, it's always interesting to me, and I love the passage of Scripture in the book

591
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:23,080
of 1 Samuel where Saul's friend says, there is a man of God in this city, talking of Samuel.

592
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:26,740
That's how the pastor ought to be known, and I understand we live in a very big place,

593
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:33,780
lots of people, but back in the day in America, small community, small town America, the pastor

594
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,340
was known in the community.

595
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,340
Amen?

596
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:44,260
It ought to be known that there's a man of God in this town, in this city, in this community.

597
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:48,700
We find that he says that he must have a good report of them which are without, lest

598
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,740
he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.

599
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:55,520
I've not addressed specifically each one of these, go through them relatively quickly

600
00:33:55,520 --> 00:34:01,500
this morning, but it's understood that as we look at this list that's provided for the

601
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:07,020
office of a bishop, the pastor, again the word used interchangeably throughout the New

602
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:12,820
Testament of a pastor, a bishop, an elder, as to what the requirements are.

603
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:17,900
And he says likewise in verse number 8, we segue to the office of a deacon.

604
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:22,620
We see that reference in verse number 10 and also in verse number 13.

605
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:26,940
The Bible says to them that use the office of a deacon in verse number 10, and verse

606
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:32,260
number 13, for they that have used the office of a deacon.

607
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:35,760
I said this in Sunday school this morning, it's important that we understand that here

608
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,880
he's speaking about the office of a deacon.

609
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:45,000
The language here makes clear that these qualifications are necessary, not just desired.

610
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:52,040
We've said that of the bishop, the pastor, but it's true also of the deacon.

611
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:58,480
It's important that we note that the word deacon in its most plain form means a servant,

612
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,480
a minister.

613
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:04,960
In fact, many times in the New Testament, only here in fact, in 1 Timothy 3, is the

614
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,600
Greek word translated deacon.

615
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:11,520
Everywhere else it's translated either minister or servant or something with regard to that

616
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:16,000
kind of idea of ministering, of serving.

617
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:22,520
I said it in Sunday school that every deacon is a servant, is a minister.

618
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:26,640
But not every servant or minister is a deacon.

619
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,920
Does that make sense?

620
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,080
We're all to be servants of the Lord.

621
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,200
We're all to serve Christ.

622
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:38,120
We find that God establishes again as He's giving the order in the church that thou mayest

623
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:41,000
know how thou oughtest to behave thyself.

624
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,880
He's providing this structure and this order and He says there's an office of the pastor,

625
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:49,960
the bishop, the elder, but there's an office of a deacon.

626
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:53,560
By the way, we're not a deacon board run church.

627
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,840
Hallelujah.

628
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,240
We got three deacons.

629
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,240
But the deacons don't tell me what to do.

630
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:04,040
And I'm not saying that to be sarcastic, to be prideful or arrogant, but a deacon run

631
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,800
church is not biblical.

632
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,360
Amen?

633
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:14,320
The deacons don't tell me here's, no, that's, no, we have deacons that fit the qualifications

634
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,680
and I counsel with them.

635
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,920
By the way, that's just wise.

636
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,920
Amen?

637
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,320
We have church meetings.

638
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:24,440
We have one next Sunday night where the church makes decisions.

639
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:27,880
Just because I'm the pastor doesn't mean I just go rogue and make all the decisions.

640
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:32,440
That's not what the idea is, the overseer, but you understand there's some churches that

641
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:38,200
are board run churches all across our land.

642
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:42,440
And the deacons think that they have some level of authority over the pastor, over the

643
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,440
pulpit.

644
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:48,320
I've often said to people over the years, listen, no one's dictating to me, and again,

645
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,720
I hope you understand how I'm saying this.

646
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:53,780
I'm not saying it pridefully or arrogantly, what I preach.

647
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:58,060
The pulpit is an area that's kind of like reserved for the pastor.

648
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:59,420
Amen?

649
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:04,640
And I'm to preach the Word of God, to be instantencies and odysseys and to reprove, rebuke, to exhort

650
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:09,720
with all longsuffering, and we understand the time will come when they will not endure

651
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:12,940
sound doctrine.

652
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:18,280
We find here this morning that the deacons are not some ruling board in a church.

653
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:22,820
The deacons are servants or ministers.

654
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:23,860
Some people have the idea.

655
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:27,740
I remember in the church that I did my internship in after college, actually, I was still in

656
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:32,260
college when I was doing my internship, and I remember a man being voted on to be a deacon,

657
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:36,180
and he stood up and he made this comment, he said, you know, all my life I was attaining

658
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:37,180
to be a deacon.

659
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:41,740
I thought if I could just be a deacon, it was some prominent position within the church.

660
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:42,740
You know what I've learned?

661
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:46,420
I've learned that being a deacon is a servant, it's a minister.

662
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:48,020
That's what it is.

663
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:53,060
But there are qualifications for the one that has the office of a deacon.

664
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:58,420
Notice in verse number 8, likewise must the deacons be grave, not double-tongued.

665
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:02,180
By the way, that's an interesting phrase that we see much in our society today where somebody

666
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:06,020
says one thing to one person and another thing to another person with regard to deceiving

667
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,020
and what have you.

668
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:10,820
Not to be double-tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre.

669
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:15,380
It says of the pastor and also the deacon not to be greedy of filthy lucre, not to be

670
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,380
covetous.

671
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:22,060
And I've said often over the years, I don't do what I do for money.

672
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:26,780
You know, there are a lot of televangelists and big-name preachers in America today that

673
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:32,660
bring a bad name on all pastors, they really do, flying around in $50 million jets and

674
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:34,660
all this crazy stuff and what have you.

675
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:40,860
I mean, it's insane, not greedy of filthy lucre.

676
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:45,820
Notice holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience and let these also first

677
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,580
be proved.

678
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:52,180
Remember it said of a pastor not to be a novice, here it says of a deacon that they must first

679
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,180
be proved.

680
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:58,620
Then let them use, again we see the phrase in verse number 10, the office of a deacon

681
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:00,100
being found blameless.

682
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:05,260
Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderer, sober, faithful in all things.

683
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:10,120
Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children, their own houses well.

684
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:15,420
For they that have used, again notice the office of a deacon well, purchased to themselves

685
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:22,380
a good degree and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.

686
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:26,540
To be that servant, to be that minister, that deacon.

687
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:29,940
I'm thankful for the deacons that we have in our church.

688
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:33,300
There are some that believe that you must have deacons in order to be an established

689
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:37,180
New Testament church, but I would say it this way, if you don't have qualified men to be

690
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:42,180
a deacon, that you leave the office vacant.

691
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:46,260
It would be better to have the office vacant than to fill the office with someone who's

692
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:50,100
not qualified, amen?

693
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:54,060
And we find here this morning, it's very similar, in Acts chapter number 6, hold your place

694
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:58,220
here in 1 Timothy, but turn back to Acts 6 if you will, and we find that in Acts chapter

695
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:00,420
number 6, there's a situation.

696
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:04,140
that happens. Now, the word deacon is not used here. There are some that would argue

697
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:08,140
over Acts chapter number 6, whether it's the first deacons or not. But as we look at Acts

698
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:16,560
chapter number 6, it fits the context of understanding the responsibility in the office of a deacon.

699
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,420
And we look here in Acts chapter number 6. I've often said over the years, and it's a

700
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:24,000
good rule of practice, that you do not build doctrine from the book of Acts. The book of

701
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,020
Acts is a transitional book, okay? And in the early church in the first century, there

702
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:32,540
was a lot of transition that's taking place. You don't necessarily build doctrine from

703
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:37,180
the book of Acts, but as the Bible is continuing to be written and the instruction is given

704
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:41,880
to the local church, such as we find in 1 Timothy, as we're studying through this book,

705
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:47,260
we can go back to the book of Acts and see, as the instruction is provided and doctrine

706
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:53,300
is being built, how it's applied in the book of Acts. In Acts 6, it says, and in those

707
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:58,140
days, in verse number 1, and in those days when the number of the disciples was multiplied,

708
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:02,100
by the way, the church was growing, praise the Lord for that, there arose a murmuring

709
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:05,460
of the Grecians against the Hebrews. You know what? When a church grows, sometimes there

710
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:14,740
are problems. Hallelujah. You ever hear somebody say, growing pains? It happens. You know why?

711
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:17,560
Because not everyone that's going to be added to a church is going to come from the same

712
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:22,180
background that you've came from. Listen, it's a good thing when people visit church

713
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:27,960
that are lost. Amen? Not everybody that walks through that door is going to look like you

714
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:31,280
and talk like you and sound like you, but they need the truth of the gospel. They need

715
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:38,120
a church family, a church home. Amen? It says, because their widows were neglected of the

716
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:42,320
daily ministration, then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them and

717
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:46,360
said, it is not reason that we should leave the word of God and serve tables. It wasn't

718
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:50,300
so much that the church leadership, the pastor here, thought that they could, like, it's

719
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:55,760
beneath me to serve tables. No, it was that I have a responsibility to feed the flock

720
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:01,200
of God, to pray and to minister in the word, and if I'm cutting grass and serving tables

721
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:05,520
and mopping floors and changing this, then I'm not able to do what God has entrusted

722
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:10,040
me to do. Does that make sense? It doesn't mean that the pastor, listen, there was a

723
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:15,160
mess over in the fellowship hall on Sunday morning, Easter Sunday. We had the breakfast.

724
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:18,120
I walked through there. Some of you, I didn't do it so that somebody could see me, but there's

725
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:22,620
a mess. I went and got a broom and I was sweeping it up. Some of you saw me do it. I didn't

726
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:28,140
do it so that you would see me. It's not beneath me. The reality, though, is I've got to stand

727
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:33,140
behind this pulpit and feed the church of God. And so the leadership says it's not for

728
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:37,660
us to leave the word of God and serve tables. There's only so much time that an individual

729
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:40,340
has, so I've got to understand what my calling is.

730
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:45,700
Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report. First let them

731
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:51,220
be proved. You saw that in 1st Timothy chapter 3. It says this, full of the Holy Ghost and

732
00:42:51,220 --> 00:43:00,720
wisdom whom we may appoint over this business, but we will give ourselves continually to

733
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:06,560
prayer and to the ministry of the word. We find that the Bible says the saying pleased

734
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:10,240
the whole multitude and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost

735
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:14,880
and Philip and Proctorius and Nicanor and Timon and Parmenas and Nicholas, a proselyte

736
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,940
of Antioch, whom they set before the apostles and when they had prayed they laid their hands

737
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:23,400
on them and the word of God increased and the number of the disciples multiplied in

738
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:28,860
Jerusalem greatly and in great company the priests were obedient to the faith. Hallelujah.

739
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:33,980
You know what God did in Acts chapter number 6? He gave them direction for dealing with

740
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:39,100
this situation in the local church and then in the book of 1st Timothy, we find in the

741
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:42,740
book of Titus with regard to the pastor, but in the book of 1st Timothy with regard to

742
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:51,060
the deacon, he gives the instruction with regard to the office of a deacon. Why is

743
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:54,780
this important? Why do we spend a Sunday morning dealing with this passage of scripture? Well,

744
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:59,180
it's God's word and it's God's church and we must understand this morning that behavior

745
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:05,140
in God's church is important and we must behave appropriately. It's important that every local

746
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:11,140
church understands the leadership structure that God has ordained and that we adhere to

747
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:18,420
the leadership standards of conduct that are set forth in His word. It's absolutely imperative.

748
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:22,860
I am thankful. Again, I say this often, it's changing over the years because I'm getting

749
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:29,300
older just like you are, but I'm still a young man. But the reality is that I won't be here

750
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:36,460
forever. This is the way it is. I won't be here forever. And if I'm not here in this

751
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:41,340
position of a pastor and the Lord hasn't come back yet for a church, it'd be fine with

752
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:46,620
me if He came back while I'm still the pastor and we're all just raptured out of here. But

753
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:53,580
if I die before the rapture, if God moves me, whatever the case might be, I'm not the

754
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:57,660
pastor here anymore, guess what Fellowship Baptist Church has to do? They have to find

755
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:03,640
a new pastor. And guess what you need to do? You need to follow the biblical standards

756
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:12,200
that are set forth. Why? Because it's God's church. Amen? And God's church must be run.

757
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:16,720
It must follow what God has instituted in His word, the instruction that He's given.

758
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:22,120
It's God's church. He alone has the right to establish the standards of conduct that

759
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:29,240
must be upheld to qualify for said office. Well, so-and-so's a really good guy. I mean,

760
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:36,240
maybe they should be a deacon. Did you see a good guy in there? I'm not saying that they're

761
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:43,840
not a good guy. You have to be qualified biblically. Amen? The candidate of an office must be qualified

762
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:49,400
biblically before ever assuming the position of leadership within God's church. It'd be

763
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:54,360
a silly thing for someone to assume a position of leadership knowing that they've not qualified

764
00:45:54,360 --> 00:46:03,040
biblically. By the way, can I say this this morning? He said, if a man desire the office

765
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:08,160
of a bishop, he desires a good work, an honorable work. Can I tell you my experience when God

766
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:13,880
was calling me to be a pastor? I'd rather not. Just being honest with you. So God, somebody

767
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:22,160
else can do that. I can serve in whatever other capacity. I was afraid. But I also understand

768
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:27,440
the weight, the responsibility. You know what the Bible says in the book of Hebrews? It's

769
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:32,320
not a qualification. It gives us some insight to the duty of the pastor. He watches for

770
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:43,680
your souls. That is a weighty responsibility. It truly is. And so we find here that as God

771
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:49,400
calls and God equips that the man that would fill the position must be qualified. He must

772
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:53,400
adhere to the standards that are set forth, the standards of conduct. Furthermore, it's

773
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:57,640
important to understand that the individual that's in an office must remain qualified

774
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:03,040
lest they be removed from the office. Just because someone is a pastor doesn't mean they

775
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:07,960
should always be a pastor. You know, there's behavior that can disqualify a man from being

776
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:14,000
in the position of being a pastor or a deacon. There's behavior that can disqualify. Does

777
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,560
it mean he's not a Christian anymore? No. Does it mean that he can't serve God in some

778
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:23,880
capacity anymore? No. It just simply means that he's not qualified for those two offices.

779
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:28,280
Does that make sense this morning? And we still give an opportunity to serve, to be

780
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:34,240
used of God. Listen, as a local church, we believe and we teach and we practice that

781
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:39,300
our God is a forgiving God. And we understand restitution and reconciliation and what a

782
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:44,360
blessing that is. We've often said, as I even sat on an ordination council not long ago,

783
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:49,880
listen, church discipline, the idea of church discipline is not excommunication, but what?

784
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:58,640
It's that we would restore such in one. Restoration. But someone that's committed certain things,

785
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:04,600
behaved in certain manners, though they may still be used of the Lord, they may not qualify

786
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:12,400
for the office of a bishop or the office of a deacon. God's church, behavior in God's

787
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:18,720
church. Why does God outline all of these things? Well, because it's his church and

788
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:24,000
he can. And he says, here's how I want my church to function. Here's how I want the

789
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:29,400
leadership in my church to function. If you start a business, you know what you get to

790
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:35,400
do? You get to establish the organization chart. You do. You say, my name's going to

791
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:43,160
be at the top. Good luck. Everyone wants it until they get it. But what I say this

792
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:48,960
morning is that God instituted the church and he instructed the church and he said,

793
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:56,700
here are the two offices and here are the requirements for an individual, a man to fill

794
00:48:56,700 --> 00:49:03,800
either office. And it's imperative that we do God's work God's way. Wouldn't it be a

795
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:10,480
shame to think that this is God's church or to know that this is God's church and then

796
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:16,760
to ignore the teaching that he gives with regard to leadership qualifications and determine

797
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:24,920
that we're just going to do things our own way and then we lose God's favor. Don't we

798
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:32,440
want God's favor? I want God's favor, personally and corporately. And so, if God has instructed

799
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:37,960
us on how we're to be organized and what the offices are and who the individual that would

800
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:45,000
fill that office must meet a standard of conduct qualifications, we must know it and we must

801
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:51,080
adhere to it. Behavior in God's church. Let's pray. Father, we love you. We thank you for

802
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:58,360
loving us. We thank you for your word. This morning we deal with maybe some technical

803
00:49:58,360 --> 00:49:59,520
type of things.

804
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:04,540
But God, I pray that you'd help us to be sound in the faith, that we'd have an understanding

805
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:06,400
why we function the way that we do.

806
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,580
Why do we have a pastor?

807
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:10,880
Why do we have deacons?

808
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:13,240
Why are there qualifications?

809
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:14,240
Why does it even matter?

810
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:18,760
Lord, I pray that we'd be settled and ground in the faith, that we would be able to give

811
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:26,040
an answer as to why church leadership is functioning the way that it is.

812
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:29,080
God, I pray that you'd help us to walk worthy.

813
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:32,760
Lord, help us to please you and to honor you and to glorify you.

814
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:37,520
God, it is my desire that Fellowship Baptist Church would be used to be a lighthouse in

815
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:38,840
our community.

816
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:42,800
God, we see souls saved, lives changed.

817
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:50,760
God, that we would have your favor, your blessings upon us.

818
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:57,400
Father, I pray that if there's one not sure of heaven, we sang that song to start the

819
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,480
service this morning, are you saved?

820
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:04,440
Are you washed in the blood, saved by the blood of Christ?

821
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:09,480
Or if there's one that's not sure of heaven, I pray that today, Lord, they'd trust Christ

822
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:11,800
as their Savior.

823
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:14,200
Or maybe some that just need to thank God.

824
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:18,040
Thank you, Lord, for the structure that you've provided.

825
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:23,920
Lord, I pray that in this moment of invitation, you'd have your will in way, that you'd work

826
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:28,440
as only you can, that we'd thank you, Lord, for providing us with the guidance and the

827
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:34,760
leadership, that you did not leave this for us to figure out on our own.

828
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:37,100
We thank you for the instruction.

829
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:39,720
We pray that you'd help us to adhere to it.

830
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:42,720
And we'll thank you for what you'll do, for it's in Christ's name we pray.

831
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:43,720
Would you stand with me?

832
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:44,720
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

833
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:45,720
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano.

834
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:50,880
Maybe you want to come and just thank God this morning for the leadership, the direction

835
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,240
that He gives us in His Word.

836
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:56,280
Maybe this morning God has spoken to your heart through some other way.

837
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:57,280
Maybe you're not sure of heaven.

838
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,160
We'd love to take a Bible and show you how you can know for sure that heaven is your

839
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,160
home.

840
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,760
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
