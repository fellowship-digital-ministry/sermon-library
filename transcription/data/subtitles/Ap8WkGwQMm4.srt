1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
So thankful for the opportunity to be gathered together, thankful for the privilege of having

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:09,439
the Word of God, and I trust that you are as well.

3
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:13,319
And by way of introduction, I'm going to read the first several verses of Luke chapter 2,

4
00:00:13,319 --> 00:00:18,920
though we will focus this morning on verses 8 through 20 will be the focus of our message

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,200
this morning.

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:24,639
But by way of introduction, let me read these first seven verses to Luke chapter 2.

7
00:00:24,639 --> 00:00:29,319
The Bible says this, and it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from

8
00:00:29,319 --> 00:00:33,720
Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed.

9
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:38,720
And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.

10
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:42,419
And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.

11
00:00:42,419 --> 00:00:47,599
And Joseph also went up from Galilee out of the city of Nazareth into Judea, out of the

12
00:00:47,599 --> 00:00:52,880
city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of

13
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:59,959
David, to be taxed with Mary, his espoused wife, being great with child.

14
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:04,919
And so it was that while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should

15
00:01:04,919 --> 00:01:06,440
be delivered.

16
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:12,279
And she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid

17
00:01:12,279 --> 00:01:18,400
him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.

18
00:01:18,639 --> 00:01:23,040
Again, we'll focus on verses 8 through 20 in this passage of Scripture this morning,

19
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,080
but we understand that this is a special time of year when we take some time out of our

20
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,699
schedules, of course, to reflect upon the birth of our Savior.

21
00:01:31,699 --> 00:01:36,639
We understand that we live in a world in which they have commercialized holidays and they

22
00:01:36,639 --> 00:01:43,760
have sought to through their just materialism and other means, they've sought to reach people

23
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,959
and impact people.

24
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:50,120
And really, through that process, you lose the true meaning of those holidays.

25
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,680
And we understand that to be the case here with Christmas.

26
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,680
And the reality is that we do not know the date of the birth of our Savior.

27
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,800
It is uncertain as to the exact date.

28
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:06,000
However, we can rejoice greatly in the knowledge that each prophecy with regard to the coming

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,720
of Messiah has been fulfilled exactly as it had been given.

30
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:18,000
I would say this morning that the reality of Christ's birth is a settled matter historically.

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,520
I'm sure we could find some that would debate that, but I think by and large, it is a settled

32
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,919
truth of history that Christ was born.

33
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:32,919
Unfortunately, there are far too many, even those that would acknowledge the birth of

34
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:37,360
the Lord and Savior, our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, that they do not understand

35
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,759
why it is that Christ was born.

36
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:45,759
As we look at what the Scriptures teach us, obviously, within the passage here and other

37
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:52,160
portions of Scripture, we understand with great clarity as to the reason that Christ

38
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,160
was born.

39
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:58,479
Paul says it this way in the book of Galatians as he's writing to the believers in that region

40
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:05,919
in Galatians 4 and verses 4 and 5, but when the fullness of the time was come, God sent

41
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:10,800
forth His Son, made of a woman, made under the law, verse number 4.

42
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:19,080
Verse number 5 says, to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption

43
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,080
of sons.

44
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:26,199
I'm so thankful that not only do we have the reality, the truth with regard to the fact

45
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:32,160
that Christ was born, but through the pages of Scripture, we understand the reason that

46
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,759
Christ was born.

47
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:39,119
And we understand, listen, we are privileged, I use that terminology, we are blessed to

48
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:46,160
be able to have the truth with regard to not only has Jesus come, but why He has come.

49
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:52,880
Many in our world today, they do not understand the reason that Jesus Christ came to this

50
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,880
earth.

51
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,160
Why is it that He was born?

52
00:03:55,160 --> 00:04:00,199
There are people today in your neighborhood, in my neighborhood, that will have Christmas

53
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:05,880
decorations, that perhaps will even have a little manger scene that they will put somewhere

54
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:13,279
in their home, yet they have no true understanding as to the significance of this holiday that

55
00:04:13,279 --> 00:04:15,759
we seek to celebrate.

56
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:19,660
And that's a sad thing to me, that there's so many that are in darkness.

57
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:25,079
We understand that the enemy, the devil, seeks to keep people blinded, and no doubt the world

58
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:31,119
and the materialism and the commercialism has advanced the blindness of a great host

59
00:04:31,119 --> 00:04:35,019
of people, not only in this country, but around the world.

60
00:04:35,019 --> 00:04:39,480
As we look at the record that is given in Luke chapter number 2, verses 1 through 7,

61
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,859
of course we could look at other portions of Scripture this morning, but as we look

62
00:04:43,859 --> 00:04:49,920
at the record of Christ's birth in those first seven verses, we ought to rejoice in understanding

63
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:54,799
that these prophecies that we could read of in the Old Testament were fulfilled just as

64
00:04:54,799 --> 00:04:56,600
they had been given.

65
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:01,600
Not only do we rejoice in the record that has been provided to us, but as we continue

66
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,799
looking at verses 8 through 20 and really focusing this morning our attention upon these

67
00:05:06,799 --> 00:05:14,160
shepherds, I hope that as we examine and really try to relate to the shepherds this morning,

68
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,399
that God would challenge us through some lessons that we can learn from these shepherds.

69
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:24,399
I want to draw your attention as we look at this passage of Scripture in verse numberâ€”let's

70
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:27,640
look here in verse number 10, I'll give you the title for the message and we'll dig right

71
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,640
in.

72
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:33,480
The Bible says this in verse number 10, the angel said unto them, fear not, for behold,

73
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:40,119
I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.

74
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:44,920
This morning if you're taking notes, I've simply entitled the message, Good Tidings

75
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,519
of Great Joy.

76
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:49,220
Good Tidings of Great Joy.

77
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:53,640
As we dig in and trace the steps of these shepherds, I want you to notice as we look

78
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:57,799
at these shepherds just for a few moments this morning, number one, I want you to notice

79
00:05:57,799 --> 00:06:00,959
and consider with me that these shepherds were faithful.

80
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,279
They were faithful.

81
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:05,799
If we look at verses 8 and 9, let's look at just verse number 8, notice what the Bible

82
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:11,600
says here, and there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, notice what

83
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:17,079
it says, keeping watch over their flock by night.

84
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:22,640
As I first am introduced in the account that Luke gives us of the birth of our Savior,

85
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:27,640
we find that quickly the attention in these verses will turn to the shepherds and to the

86
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:32,480
announcement of the angel, and we will trace that through verse number 20, and as we begin

87
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:38,079
to notice these shepherds as we're introduced to these individuals, I would find them faithfully

88
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,279
fulfilling their responsibility.

89
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:44,160
They were faithful to do the work that they were supposed to be doing.

90
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,000
Now, I've never been in this particular regard a shepherd.

91
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,480
God calls pastors shepherds, obviously in a different context, but in this particular

92
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:59,679
context, as we think about these individuals and the responsibilities that they have, I'm

93
00:06:59,679 --> 00:07:04,880
mindful as I think about this night that these individuals, when they left their dwelling

94
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,959
place, when they said goodbye to their children, perhaps, as they went out to the fields that

95
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:16,119
night, this was the same as it had been maybe hundreds or perhaps even thousands of times

96
00:07:16,119 --> 00:07:17,359
before.

97
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:24,839
They were going out to watch over the flock, and sometimes as we begin to think about these

98
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:28,799
shepherds and we think about what they were doing, and it says that they were abiding

99
00:07:28,799 --> 00:07:33,679
in the field, notice at the end of verse number 8, keeping watch over their flock by night.

100
00:07:33,679 --> 00:07:39,799
Though we could say that this duty, as we look at them being faithful, what we would

101
00:07:39,799 --> 00:07:43,040
say is that this was an essential work that they were doing.

102
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:49,600
This was absolutely imperative that someone would fulfill this job, this responsibility

103
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,600
of watching over the flock by night.

104
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,600
Why?

105
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:57,320
Because the flock is vulnerable, and these shepherds had an important job, and faithfulness

106
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:01,239
was necessary on their part to do their job.

107
00:08:01,239 --> 00:08:05,000
And we find that they were faithful, of course, we understand the word of God speaks much

108
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
about faithfulness.

109
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,119
I'm thankful that God's word teaches us that our God is faithful.

110
00:08:11,119 --> 00:08:13,399
He is dependable, he is trustworthy.

111
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:20,679
I find that Paul often will rejoice and thank God for the express purpose that God is faithful.

112
00:08:20,679 --> 00:08:23,160
We sing, great is thy faithfulness.

113
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:27,839
We've experienced as individual believers this morning, we have experienced the faithfulness

114
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:30,119
of God.

115
00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:34,679
But you know that he expects us as his people to be faithful as well.

116
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:38,239
The Bible says in 1 Corinthians 4 and verse number 2, moreover, it's required in Stuart's

117
00:08:38,239 --> 00:08:40,599
that a man be found faithful.

118
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:44,640
I'm mindful of what the wise man said in Proverbs 20 and verse number 6, the latter

119
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,320
part of the verse, he says, but a faithful man, who can find?

120
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,280
And if you were to read through the book of Proverbs, and perhaps you would do a study

121
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:57,880
on a faithful man and on an unfaithful man, you would find the great truth that God gives

122
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,320
us in the importance of faithfulness.

123
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,119
When I look at these shepherds, when I'm first introduced to these shepherds in verse number

124
00:09:04,119 --> 00:09:08,919
8, the first thing that I notice, the first thing that I'm met with is the fact that they

125
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:09,919
were faithful.

126
00:09:10,239 --> 00:09:12,520
They were faithful.

127
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:18,840
I believe that though, as I mentioned a moment ago, they had probably hundreds or perhaps

128
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:24,799
thousands of times had this same kind of routine.

129
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:29,440
You go to work, you go through a routine when you leave the house, when you do whatever

130
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:35,119
you do, when the kids are saying bye and so on and so forth, and they had gone through

131
00:09:35,119 --> 00:09:38,080
this process, if they had families, right?

132
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,960
And we understand that they've gone through this process, but little did they know that

133
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:46,520
on this day, on this night, their life was going to change.

134
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,200
I mean, this is an amazing experience.

135
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,719
See, things were going to be different this night.

136
00:09:52,719 --> 00:09:57,239
These things that are going to unfold in these next few verses, they did not have the expectation

137
00:09:57,239 --> 00:10:00,000
that this is what was going to happen this particular night.

138
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,240
that particular night.

139
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,799
But they were faithful.

140
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:04,400
And because they were faithful,

141
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,400
they were in the place where they were supposed to be

142
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,579
in order to have the experience

143
00:10:09,579 --> 00:10:11,600
that they're going to have.

144
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,760
Amen?

145
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,319
I notice not only that these shepherds were faithful,

146
00:10:15,319 --> 00:10:17,079
but I would say this as we continue

147
00:10:17,079 --> 00:10:18,680
through the passage of Scripture,

148
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,440
I notice that these shepherds were attentive.

149
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,600
They were attentive.

150
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,520
Why do we say that?

151
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,319
Well, they listened to what the message was

152
00:10:25,319 --> 00:10:26,559
and they followed it.

153
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,360
And so there was some attentiveness

154
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,239
to that which was being communicated to them.

155
00:10:31,239 --> 00:10:33,360
Notice, they're there in the night.

156
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,360
They're watching over their flock by night.

157
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,799
And the Bible says in verse number nine,

158
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:41,360
and lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them

159
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,720
and the glory of the Lord shone round about them

160
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,759
and they were sore afraid.

161
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:49,000
Can you relate to these shepherds just for a moment?

162
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,360
I mean, they're out there.

163
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,959
They've done this many times.

164
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:54,439
They're watching over their flock by night.

165
00:10:54,439 --> 00:10:56,200
And then in a moment,

166
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,639
the Bible tells us that this angel of the Lord comes

167
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:02,080
and the glory of the Lord shone round about them.

168
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,360
You'd be fearful as well.

169
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,919
I mean, in this moment, I mean,

170
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:08,319
I hope this morning that as we look through this passage

171
00:11:08,319 --> 00:11:10,919
that we can begin to relate to these shepherds

172
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:13,480
and to understand what they experienced in this moment

173
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,720
and what they're dealing with.

174
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,080
And we find this scene that is explained to us here

175
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,680
in these verses of Scripture.

176
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,680
The Bible continues in verse number 10

177
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,160
and the angel says, fear not.

178
00:11:24,199 --> 00:11:28,680
I'm thankful that this was the first of the greeting

179
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,800
to these shepherds, fear not.

180
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,680
Why? Because they were sore afraid.

181
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,839
The angel said unto them, fear not.

182
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:41,839
Notice, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy,

183
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,120
which shall be to all people.

184
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,000
In Luke 2, in verse number 10,

185
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,080
the announcement is given to these shepherds

186
00:11:52,239 --> 00:11:54,000
that there was a message

187
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,080
that was going to be delivered to them.

188
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,720
Now, notice the way in which this message

189
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,000
is described for us in verse number 10.

190
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,080
The message is described, we use as our title this morning,

191
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:08,800
good tidings of great joy, good tidings of great joy.

192
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,320
Now, these shepherds, again, they're out there,

193
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,160
they're in the field,

194
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,279
they're watching over their flock by night.

195
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:16,800
This angel of the Lord appears and says, fear not,

196
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,759
and then says to these shepherds,

197
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:24,639
I'm bringing you good tidings of great joy.

198
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,720
Now, I think just that announcement

199
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,360
that perhaps they would be more attentive

200
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,559
because they understand that this message

201
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:33,360
that is going to be delivered to them

202
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,800
is a message of good tidings and great joy.

203
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,199
They're going to be attentive.

204
00:12:39,199 --> 00:12:42,440
And you know, the attentiveness that we would have

205
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,759
as we understand what's happening here

206
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:47,399
and we understand the Word of God

207
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,479
as the Word of God week after week,

208
00:12:49,479 --> 00:12:51,279
day after day in your personal life

209
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,800
as you read the Scriptures,

210
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,479
that we would be attentive to what thus saith the Lord.

211
00:12:56,479 --> 00:12:58,880
That as we open the pages of Scripture

212
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,479
that we would take note

213
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:02,399
and that we would focus our attention,

214
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,399
that we would eliminate the distraction

215
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,080
so that I can be attentive to what God has for me

216
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,039
because God has a message for you.

217
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,360
The angel had a message.

218
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,520
See, God had summons this angel to go

219
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,520
and to deliver this message to the shepherds

220
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:20,520
and as these shepherds are experiencing this moment

221
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,520
and this scene, the angel says,

222
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,839
I'm bringing you good tidings of great joy.

223
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,479
Notice what it says at the end of the verse,

224
00:13:28,479 --> 00:13:31,520
which shall be to all people.

225
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,759
Notice with me that in verse number 10,

226
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:40,360
it says, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy

227
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,360
which shall be to all people.

228
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,839
These shepherds, because of their faithfulness,

229
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:48,240
as we mentioned in our first point,

230
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,479
because they were in the place

231
00:13:49,479 --> 00:13:51,199
where they were supposed to be,

232
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,720
the angel comes and gives them this message.

233
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,240
They were privileged to receive this message.

234
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,800
But they understood right at the onset,

235
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:04,000
before the content of the message is even given to them,

236
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,080
as we'll find in verse number 11,

237
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,399
before the content of the message is given to them,

238
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:11,479
they are made keenly aware of the fact

239
00:14:11,479 --> 00:14:13,559
that this message that I'm giving you

240
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:16,160
is a message of good tidings of great joy,

241
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,959
but it's for all people.

242
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,399
This message isn't just for you.

243
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:25,119
This message isn't just to be contained by yourself,

244
00:14:25,119 --> 00:14:26,720
something that you keep to yourself.

245
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,519
No, this message of good tidings

246
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,799
or these good tidings of great joy,

247
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:35,000
this message that will be delivered to these shepherds,

248
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,079
it shall be to all people.

249
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,600
That's important for us to understand.

250
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:44,160
This morning as we think about the word gospel

251
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,959
and we'd understand the good news,

252
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,720
the gospel of Jesus Christ,

253
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,040
that this term good tidings

254
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,359
would be a synonymous term that would be used

255
00:14:54,359 --> 00:14:58,440
with what we often refer to as the good news or the gospel.

256
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,279
And we find that, listen, as God's people,

257
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,760
because you have been given the truth of the gospel,

258
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,799
you understand this morning that it's for all people.

259
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:10,079
It's not for us to keep to ourselves.

260
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:13,600
Someone said this, a theologian of yesteryear,

261
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,119
that Christianity is not a closed-mouth religion.

262
00:15:18,119 --> 00:15:20,600
Now, I don't like using the term religion

263
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,920
to describe Christianity.

264
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,559
I prefer to use the word relationship

265
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:26,200
because of some of the context

266
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,839
of what people will take with that term religion.

267
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:31,239
However, I agree with the theologian

268
00:15:31,239 --> 00:15:35,279
that we are not to be closed-mouthed about the gospel.

269
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,119
We've been given responsibility.

270
00:15:37,119 --> 00:15:39,200
And these shepherds, in like fashion,

271
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:41,720
as we have been entrusted with a message,

272
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:46,720
they are going to receive this message of great joy,

273
00:15:47,119 --> 00:15:49,799
but they understand at the very beginning,

274
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:52,440
before the message is actually even given to them,

275
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,959
that it shall be to all people.

276
00:15:53,959 --> 00:15:55,959
Note the message.

277
00:15:55,959 --> 00:16:00,959
Verse 11, for unto you is born this day

278
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,679
in the city of David a Savior,

279
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:07,200
which is Christ the Lord.

280
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,440
Isn't that a wonderful truth of the Word of God?

281
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,279
We read verses one through seven by way of introduction

282
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:16,480
as we dealt with the record of the birth of Christ.

283
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,920
And we understand, even as we read verses one through seven,

284
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,399
the sovereignty and the providence of God

285
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,720
and how that God would, at the appointed time,

286
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,959
let this one raise up and cause these taxes

287
00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:32,359
to be collected in these particular cities

288
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:35,200
so that Mary and Joseph were in the place

289
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,640
where they were supposed to be.

290
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:40,079
Why? Because the prophecies of the birth of Messiah,

291
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,559
that He would be born in Bethlehem.

292
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:44,839
And so we see that God is working

293
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:48,160
and the sovereignty of God is no doubt on display

294
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,119
in these first seven verses of Scripture.

295
00:16:50,119 --> 00:16:53,559
And we come and we understand that these shepherds

296
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:56,399
are receiving this powerful message,

297
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,040
this life-changing message with regard

298
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,880
to the birth of Messiah.

299
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:06,119
Notice, the place of the birth is announced

300
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:08,000
in the city of David.

301
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,359
In the city of David.

302
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,959
You understand that Jesus is the Messiah,

303
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:16,359
that He is God, that He is the Savior of the world.

304
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:19,399
I'm thankful this morning that I could stand and say

305
00:17:19,399 --> 00:17:21,399
that He is my Savior personally,

306
00:17:21,399 --> 00:17:24,119
that I have personally placed my faith and trust

307
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:26,519
in the finished work of Christ at Calvary.

308
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:28,519
And I trust that you have as well.

309
00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:29,559
And we could stand and say,

310
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:31,959
not only is He the Savior of the world, and He is,

311
00:17:31,959 --> 00:17:34,559
but He's my Savior personally.

312
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,480
And we find that the Bible continues not only

313
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,160
to give the truth with regard to the city

314
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,600
in which Christ was born and this announcement,

315
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,519
this message is being given to these shepherds.

316
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:46,880
It says in verse number 12,

317
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,559
and this shall be a sign unto you.

318
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,480
Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes,

319
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,119
lying in a manger.

320
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:00,959
Now, if you go back and look at verse number seven with me,

321
00:18:00,959 --> 00:18:02,480
we read it a moment ago.

322
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,559
The Bible says that she brought forth her firstborn son

323
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:08,119
and wrapped him in swaddling clothes

324
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:10,160
and laid him in a manger.

325
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,640
Notice this, because there was no room for them in the inn.

326
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,720
Why was there no room?

327
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,559
Well, there was a great influx of people in the city

328
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,880
for the purpose of paying these taxes.

329
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,320
And as they would come into the city,

330
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,320
as you notice, as we've read these verses already,

331
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,160
that they were to go into their city.

332
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,640
And they went to the city of David, which is Bethlehem.

333
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:34,520
And as they come, no doubt, great groups of people

334
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,640
would come for the purpose of fulfilling

335
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,119
that which was required.

336
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:39,320
And they come to this place,

337
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,520
there's no room for them in the inn.

338
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,840
And Mary gives birth and they're there.

339
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,400
She wraps our Savior in swaddling clothes

340
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,200
and lays him in a manger.

341
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,760
And the angel says to these shepherds

342
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,520
that this is the sign that will be unto you,

343
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:57,840
that ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes,

344
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,340
lying in a manger.

345
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:03,820
Now, notice the message in verses 11 and 12

346
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:06,619
that is given the content of this message.

347
00:19:06,619 --> 00:19:09,179
I'm thankful as we're speaking about these shepherds

348
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:11,460
that they were faithful, but they were attentive.

349
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,780
I mean, can you imagine the scene

350
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:17,380
as soon as the message is given in verses 11 and 12,

351
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,619
the Bible tells us in verses 13 and 14

352
00:19:19,619 --> 00:19:22,500
that there was this multitude of heavenly hosts.

353
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:26,260
Notice it says, and suddenly there was with the angel

354
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:29,260
a multitude of the heavenly hosts praising God

355
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:32,700
and saying, glory to God in the highest,

356
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:37,260
and on earth peace, goodwill toward men.

357
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,179
And it came to pass, verse 15,

358
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:43,460
as the angels were gone away from them into heaven.

359
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:47,739
So just think about the scene for a moment.

360
00:19:47,739 --> 00:19:50,099
They're out in the field being faithful,

361
00:19:50,099 --> 00:19:54,219
doing what they have done perhaps thousands of times before

362
00:19:54,219 --> 00:19:56,820
and an angel appears to them.

363
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,659
And in the moment they're fearful

364
00:19:58,659 --> 00:20:00,460
and the angel says, fear not.

365
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:03,260
but I bring you good tidings of great joy,

366
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,980
which shall be to all people.

367
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:08,380
For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior,

368
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:10,300
which is Christ the Lord."

369
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:13,000
And then talks about the sign that they would receive,

370
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,500
that they would find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes.

371
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,660
I mean, the excitement of the time.

372
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:20,380
But they were attentive to the message.

373
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,100
I'm thankful that they were attentive.

374
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:22,620
Why?

375
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:26,660
Because they couldn't say, can you repeat that to me?

376
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,300
Have you ever asked somebody something

377
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,940
and you've not really been giving your full attention?

378
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,180
You've not been attentive.

379
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,700
And someone's giving you directions.

380
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,500
And you kind of just wander a moment.

381
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,920
And they say, OK, have a nice day.

382
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,140
And you're like, can you repeat that?

383
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,020
I really wasn't paying attention.

384
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:43,140
Listen, as soon as the message that

385
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:47,620
is given to these shepherds is completed in verse number 12,

386
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:50,220
there's this multitude of this heavenly host

387
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,540
that's praising God.

388
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,580
And they're saying, glory to God in the highest.

389
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,540
On earth, peace, goodwill toward men.

390
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:58,820
And then they're gone, and the shepherds are left alone.

391
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,740
There's no repeat.

392
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,540
They had to be attentive.

393
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,620
And I'm thankful that they were attentive.

394
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:08,820
I'm thankful that these individuals, these messengers,

395
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:11,140
that on this night that they were faithful,

396
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:14,260
but I'm thankful that they were attentive to that which

397
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,900
had been delivered to them.

398
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:19,460
Again, as I begin to note here and think about the scene that

399
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:22,660
has unfolded before us, I think about the experience

400
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:25,540
of these shepherds and what a joyous experience it was,

401
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:27,700
no doubt.

402
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,100
And now, as I mentioned a moment ago,

403
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,600
they're left in verse number 15.

404
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,380
The Bible says, it came to pass as the angels were gone away

405
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,500
from them into heaven.

406
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,060
Now think about that.

407
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,660
I don't know how many shepherds it was.

408
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,780
It's plural, so it was more than one.

409
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,460
I don't know how many.

410
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:47,660
But can you imagine just for a moment being in this situation?

411
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:52,260
I mean, what has just happened is

412
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:55,540
so outside of the ordinary, something they'd never

413
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:57,580
experienced before.

414
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:01,060
They're there, and they didn't expect this to happen.

415
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,660
But because of being faithful, they're

416
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,400
in the place where they're supposed to be.

417
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,660
They receive this message.

418
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,040
They're attentive to the message.

419
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,500
And notice what they say.

420
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:12,740
Let us, look, it says this, the shepherds said one to another.

421
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,940
So there's a little conferring, if you will.

422
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:17,100
There's a little discussion that takes place.

423
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,420
They say one to another.

424
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:23,420
Notice, let us now go even unto Bethlehem

425
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:25,540
and see this thing which has come

426
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:31,460
to pass which the Lord hath made known unto us.

427
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:34,140
As we continue to trace the steps of the shepherds,

428
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,540
I find that they were faithful.

429
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,840
I find that they were attentive.

430
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,820
I find, number three, that they were obedient.

431
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,740
They were obedient.

432
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:44,260
They had been given this message,

433
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:46,540
and they had been given the truth

434
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:50,020
of that momentous occasion, what had happened

435
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:55,580
on this particular day, that the Son of God, the incarnation

436
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,060
that he was born.

437
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:59,500
Remember, as we look at the pages of scriptures,

438
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,620
we note it already in the book of Philippians,

439
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:04,460
but we note what Paul says in the book of,

440
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,740
I mentioned Galatians.

441
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,860
Notice in Philippians chapter number two,

442
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:11,780
as we consider the incarnation of our Savior,

443
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,820
the Bible tells us in Philippians chapter

444
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:16,860
number two, verses six through nine,

445
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,820
really down through verse number 11.

446
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:21,620
But notice in verse number six of Philippians chapter number

447
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:25,380
two, the Bible says, who being in the form of God,

448
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:29,100
thought it not robbery to be equal with God,

449
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,740
but made himself of no reputation,

450
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,460
and took upon him the form of a servant,

451
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:36,900
was made in the likeness of men, and being found in fashion

452
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:41,500
as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient unto death

453
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,300
even the death of the cross.

454
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,020
Wherefore, God also hath highly exalted him

455
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,500
and given him a name which is above every name.

456
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,740
The name of Jesus every knee should

457
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,980
bow of things in heaven, and things in earth,

458
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,180
and things under the earth.

459
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,780
And that every tongue should confess

460
00:23:55,780 --> 00:24:01,860
that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father.

461
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:06,260
The incarnation that we speak of and we remember,

462
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:10,300
especially at this time of year, these shepherds

463
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,700
had just been given the announcement

464
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:15,140
that Messiah has come.

465
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,700
And now the angel's gone.

466
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:19,260
I'm thankful that they were obedient.

467
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:23,380
They said, let us go, let us now go, even unto Bethlehem,

468
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,620
and see this thing which has come to pass,

469
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:29,780
notice where it says, which the Lord hath made known unto us.

470
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:32,820
Notice the first phrase of verse number 16.

471
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:36,820
And they came with haste.

472
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:39,660
The obedience of these shepherds was,

473
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,940
an immediate obedience.

474
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:44,540
I think about the excitement again of the moment.

475
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:46,420
I think about all that they had experienced

476
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:48,500
and what they had just been informed of.

477
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:53,260
And the angel departs and they say one to another, let us go.

478
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,740
And they go with haste.

479
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,740
And we find that as they are obedient,

480
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:02,900
that their obedience resulted in a special opportunity.

481
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,540
Notice the Bible tells us in verse number 16

482
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,100
that they came with haste, notice,

483
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:16,500
and found Mary and Joseph and the babe lying in a manger.

484
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,860
They found it just as they had been told.

485
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:22,500
The angel said, in verse number 11,

486
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,860
for unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior,

487
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,420
which is Christ the Lord.

488
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:29,620
The angel continued, this shall be a sign unto you,

489
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,860
you shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes,

490
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,540
lying in a manger.

491
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:36,940
See, they were going to find Messiah, the Son of God,

492
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:39,980
perhaps there had been other babies that were born that day.

493
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:42,020
Perhaps there'd be other parents that were rejoicing

494
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:44,100
in the birth of their children on that day.

495
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,860
But this is God in flesh.

496
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,580
This is the incarnation.

497
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,580
And we find that he says, the angel says,

498
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,700
go to the city of David.

499
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,500
They say, we're going to Bethlehem.

500
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,300
Why? That's the city of David.

501
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,500
The angel said, you're going to find the babe wrapped

502
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,660
in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.

503
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,780
And the Bible tells us in verse number 16

504
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:03,980
that they came with haste and they found Mary and Joseph

505
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:07,460
and the babe lying in a manger.

506
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:10,100
It says to us in verse number 17,

507
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:13,420
and when they had seen it,

508
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:15,660
they made known abroad the saying

509
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:19,540
which was told them concerning this child.

510
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,580
As I begin to think about their obedience,

511
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:25,580
I find that their obedience resulted in this special opportunity

512
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,380
that we find in verse number 16.

513
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:30,700
But I also, as I consider their obedience this morning,

514
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:33,660
I noticed that in verse number 17 that they were obedient

515
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:38,540
not only to go to the place where they were told that Messiah would be,

516
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:41,460
but they were obedient to proclaim the message

517
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,540
that they were supposed to proclaim.

518
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:46,700
See, because the message as it's contained for us in verse number 10,

519
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:51,100
the angel says, fear not, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy.

520
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:54,780
Remember, which shall be to all people.

521
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,420
Which shall be to all people.

522
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:59,540
And so now, as they have been entrusted with this message,

523
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,940
as they have received this message,

524
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:04,340
remember what they said at the end of verse number 15,

525
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:08,340
which the Lord hath made known unto us.

526
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,260
And so they had been entrusted with this message,

527
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:13,860
with this truth with regard to the birth of Messiah.

528
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,300
The Bible says that when they had seen it,

529
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,740
notice verse 17,

530
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:21,140
they made known abroad the saying

531
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,420
which was told them concerning this child.

532
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:25,260
What is it that they made known?

533
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:29,100
For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior,

534
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,180
which is Christ the Lord.

535
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,460
You know what they proclaimed?

536
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,460
The Messiah has been born.

537
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,820
Christ has been born.

538
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,500
That's the message that they proclaimed, no doubt.

539
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,580
Because it says here that they made abroad the saying

540
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:44,500
which was told them concerning this child.

541
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,260
Now you understand as we compare Scripture with Scripture,

542
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:49,380
begin to think about the names of Christ

543
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:52,180
and the significance of the birth of Christ.

544
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:55,300
You'll go back, hold your place there in Luke 2,

545
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,620
go back to Matthew 1 if you will,

546
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:59,340
as we understand the significance

547
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:02,820
these men would have been familiar with the Old Testament.

548
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:05,900
We think about the announcement of the peace

549
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:08,980
that had been given there in Luke 2

550
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:12,340
when they were singing and praising God on earth,

551
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:14,180
peace, goodwill toward men.

552
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:17,140
Remember Isaiah prophesied that his name shall be

553
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:21,500
the Prince of Peace was one of the names that was given.

554
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:25,300
But here in Matthew 1 in verse 18,

555
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:28,340
the Bible says now the birth of Jesus Christ

556
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:30,060
was on this wise.

557
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:32,500
When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph

558
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,580
before they came together,

559
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:36,059
she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.

560
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:38,140
Then Joseph, her husband being a just man

561
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:40,540
and not willing to make her a public example

562
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:43,260
was minded to put her away privily.

563
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,860
But while he thought on these things,

564
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:47,580
behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream

565
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,580
saying, Joseph, thou son of David,

566
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:52,340
fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife

567
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:54,660
for that which is conceived in hers of the Holy Ghost

568
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,780
and she shall bring forth a son

569
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:59,260
and thou shall call his name Jesus.

570
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,420
Why?

571
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:05,340
For he shall save his people from their sins.

572
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:09,179
Verse 22, now all this was done that it might be fulfilled

573
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:11,780
which was spoken to the Lord by the prophet saying,

574
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:14,420
behold, a virgin shall be with child

575
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,340
and shall bring forth a son

576
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:18,660
and they shall call his name Emmanuel

577
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:23,660
which being interpreted is God with us.

578
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:26,020
Then Joseph being raised from sleep

579
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,500
did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him

580
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,100
and took unto him his wife

581
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,820
and knew her not till she had brought forth

582
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:34,380
her firstborn son and he called his name Jesus.

583
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:37,380
Here in Matthew one, we see the name Jesus,

584
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,780
we see the name Emmanuel

585
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:40,380
and we understand the significance

586
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:45,020
as this angel then appears in Luke chapter number two

587
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:48,380
to these shepherds and shares with them

588
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:51,020
that Christ is born, he is the savior,

589
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:53,660
he is the Lord that they go forth.

590
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,220
Listen, his name is Jesus.

591
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,059
Why?

592
00:29:56,059 --> 00:29:58,500
For he shall save his people from their sins.

593
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,140
How is he gonna accomplish that?

594
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:03,920
through the cross, through the shed blood at Calvary,

595
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,240
his death, burial, and glorious resurrection.

596
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,200
That's how he's gonna accomplish the fact

597
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,280
that they would be saved from their sins.

598
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,400
His name shall be called Emmanuel

599
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,480
from Isaiah chapter number seven,

600
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,060
which is being interpreted God with us.

601
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:17,900
Why?

602
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:21,120
The incarnation, Jesus Christ is God in the flesh.

603
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,880
And we find the significance here of these names

604
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,920
that are mentioned in Matthew's gospel,

605
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:30,400
and we find these shepherds are now making abroad

606
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,100
the saying which was told them concerning this child.

607
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:38,620
The Bible says in verse number 18 of Luke chapter number two,

608
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:41,300
and all they that heard it wondered at those things

609
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,680
which were told them by the shepherds.

610
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,900
You know what I find in verse number 18

611
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:49,220
is proof or evidence of the fact

612
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:51,820
that they did talk to people

613
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:54,660
and give the truth that they had been given.

614
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:57,460
They delivered the message to people

615
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:00,640
that they had been entrusted with unto you.

616
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,540
It says there in verse number 10,

617
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,700
I bring you good tidings of great joy

618
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,340
which shall be to all people.

619
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:09,500
I'm not sure how many people they were able to find.

620
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,420
I'm not sure where they found the people.

621
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:13,820
I'm not sure of all that's going on,

622
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:15,940
but in my mind I see these shepherds

623
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,820
overwhelmed with excitement,

624
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:20,260
not only because of what they had experienced

625
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,420
out there in the field,

626
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,460
but now as they enter into the city

627
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,700
and they come to the manger

628
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:27,100
and they find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes

629
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:30,620
just as the angel had said they needed to tell somebody.

630
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,660
They were willing to tell anybody.

631
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:33,760
Amen?

632
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,600
Why?

633
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,620
Because of what they'd experienced

634
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,740
and what they had seen.

635
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:38,780
And the Bible says in verse number 18,

636
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:42,500
and all they that heard it wondered at those things

637
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,460
which were told them by the shepherds.

638
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:46,540
There were a group of people that heard

639
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:49,340
the message that the shepherds proclaimed.

640
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,500
They greatly wondered,

641
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,020
the Bible tells us in verse number 19,

642
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,300
but Mary kept all these things

643
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,740
and pondered them in her heart.

644
00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:00,540
I want you to think about the obedience of these shepherds.

645
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:03,300
And I want you to consider how their obedience

646
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,100
resulted in a special opportunity.

647
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,060
We started with their faithfulness

648
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:09,420
and how that because they were faithful,

649
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:11,900
they had the opportunity to receive that message

650
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,100
from the angel.

651
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,380
Can you imagine if one of them decided

652
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:17,660
they weren't gonna be there that night?

653
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:19,620
Man, that was the wrong night to call out.

654
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:20,700
You understand what I'm saying?

655
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,180
It was the wrong night to miss church.

656
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,020
It was the wrong day.

657
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:23,980
Listen, Thomas found out

658
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,300
it was the wrong night to miss church.

659
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,140
Why?

660
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:28,300
Because Jesus showed up, right?

661
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,780
Read it in John.

662
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:31,180
You find here these shepherds,

663
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:34,460
listen, I think they were happy that they were there.

664
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,820
They were faithful.

665
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,260
They were attentive.

666
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,060
They heard the message

667
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:41,220
and they were able to go in obedience

668
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:44,540
and go to exactly the place where they were supposed to go

669
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:46,340
because they had been attentive to the message.

670
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,340
Can you imagine?

671
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,220
What did they say again?

672
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,900
Where did they say we're supposed to go?

673
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,460
What are we supposed to find?

674
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:53,460
No, no, they were attentive.

675
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:56,340
Their obedience resulted in this special opportunity.

676
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,180
I ask you this question this morning,

677
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,860
what if they had disobeyed?

678
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:04,020
Or perhaps I ask it this way,

679
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,620
what if they simply delayed?

680
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:07,660
What if they said, you know what,

681
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:09,220
there's no urgency in obeying.

682
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:12,820
We can get around to it at some point.

683
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,500
We don't have to go right now.

684
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:17,340
I would submit to you that as you compare scripture

685
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,740
with scripture, go back to Matthew, if you will.

686
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:24,660
I believe, and if you disagree, we can talk later,

687
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,540
but I believe that if these shepherds

688
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:31,140
had just simply delayed their obedience,

689
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,180
that they would not have found Jesus

690
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:36,700
in that manger wrapped in swaddling clothes

691
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:39,620
because the Bible record tells us in Matthew

692
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:42,660
in chapter number two, we're introduced to the wise men.

693
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:45,380
The wise men come from far.

694
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:47,500
The Bible says that when they come into Jerusalem,

695
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:50,500
they say here, as we look at what's going on,

696
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,460
they say to Herod in verse number two,

697
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:54,300
where is he that is born king of the Jews?

698
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,940
For we have seen a star in the east

699
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,740
and are come to worship him.

700
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,460
Herod the king had heard,

701
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,340
when Herod the king had heard these things,

702
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:03,220
he was troubled and all Jerusalem with him.

703
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:06,260
Notice verse four of Matthew two.

704
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,780
And when he had gathered all the chief priests

705
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,260
and scribes of the people together,

706
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:11,580
he demanded of them where Christ should be born.

707
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,460
And they said unto him in Bethlehem of Judea,

708
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,460
for thus it is written by the prophet.

709
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:17,180
We understand that you go back to Micah

710
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:18,700
and you can read of that.

711
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:19,580
You understand the fulfillment of prophecy.

712
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,980
That's why I said in Luke chapter number two,

713
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,140
in those first seven verses,

714
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:25,660
you see the providence and sovereignty of God.

715
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:26,940
How did they end up in Bethlehem?

716
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:29,940
They weren't, that's not where they lived,

717
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,700
but they were there because of the taxing

718
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:32,740
and they had to go there.

719
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:33,580
And that's where he was born.

720
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:34,900
Notice in verse number six,

721
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:37,340
and thou Bethlehem, this is the record of Micah five

722
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:39,140
in verse number two in the land of Judah,

723
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:41,100
art not the least among the princes of Judah

724
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,780
for out of these shall come a governor

725
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,380
that shall rule my people Israel.

726
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:46,420
Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men

727
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,740
and inquired of them diligently,

728
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:49,260
what time the star appeared.

729
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,860
And he sent them to Bethlehem and said,

730
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:53,100
go and search diligently for the young child.

731
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,340
And when you have found him,

732
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:57,380
bring me word again that I may come and worship him also.

733
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,860
The Bible tells us in verse number nine,

734
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,940
when they had heard the king, they departed.

735
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,620
These wise men depart.

736
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:03,940
The Bible says in lo the star,

737
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:06,100
which they saw in the East went before them

738
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:09,180
till it came and stood over where the young child was.

739
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,280
Where was he?

740
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,060
Verse number 10, it says, when they saw the star,

741
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,540
they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.

742
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:15,940
And when they were come into, what does it say?

743
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:19,060
Does it say the house in your Bible?

744
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:21,420
It doesn't say the manger, does it?

745
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,620
Came into the house.

746
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:26,300
I believe this morning that if these shepherds

747
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:27,860
would have delayed their obedience,

748
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:30,660
they would not have found Jesus in the manger.

749
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,460
Jesus didn't stay in the manger long.

750
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,020
Why was he in the manger?

751
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,580
There was no room in the inn.

752
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:36,900
Why was there no room in the inn?

753
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,180
Because there are a lot of people in town

754
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,560
to pay their taxes.

755
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,420
By the way, if you came into town to pay taxes

756
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:42,460
and had to pay to stay in an inn,

757
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:44,540
you'd leave pretty quick.

758
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:46,340
Amen, you get your business transaction done

759
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,700
and you get back to your hometown.

760
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:49,540
Does that make sense?

761
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:51,140
I mean, it makes sense in my mind.

762
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,660
And so guess what happens?

763
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:55,580
There's room in the inn.

764
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:58,060
There's a place to stay.

765
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,780
They probably wouldn't have immediately,

766
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,980
and if you've given birth, you could relate.

767
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:03,580
You're probably not ready to take a journey

768
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:06,460
back to your hometown of Nazareth

769
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:10,260
by way of either walking or a camel or donkey.

770
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,960
Amen, I've never given birth,

771
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,060
but my wife has given birth three times.

772
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,660
I'm pretty confident that she would not

773
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,420
have been delighted if I said,

774
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:20,260
let's get on the camel and head back to town.

775
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,260
This is not gonna work.

776
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:24,140
I mean, I'm trying to just help us this morning

777
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,020
because what I'm trying to help us understand

778
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:29,700
is the importance of obedience, immediate obedience.

779
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:33,500
Had they delayed, see, their immediate obedience

780
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:37,140
resulted in an opportunity that was unlike

781
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:39,580
any other thing they'd ever experienced.

782
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:41,740
They get to the manger

783
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:45,500
because they immediately obeyed

784
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,260
what the angel of the Lord said.

785
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:50,220
They get to the manger and they find Mary

786
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:53,100
and they find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes.

787
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,100
We mentioned that they come to the house,

788
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,820
these wise men in verse number 11

789
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:57,860
of Matthew chapter number two.

790
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:00,260
Again, I don't believe that these shepherds

791
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,140
of chapter number two of the book of Luke

792
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:05,140
that they would have found Mary and Joseph

793
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:09,180
and the babe, Jesus Christ, our Savior, the Messiah,

794
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,060
the Savior of the world,

795
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:12,300
they would not have found Him lying in a manger.

796
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,660
And then what happens?

797
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:16,580
Can you imagine?

798
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:17,420
Just for a moment.

799
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:19,300
I mean, let's use our sanctified imaginations

800
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,220
just for a moment.

801
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,540
Now these shepherds, they delay their obedience.

802
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,780
They don't go to the city of Bethlehem.

803
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:27,020
They don't do what the angel had said.

804
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:30,060
They don't go and find what had been announced to them

805
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:31,580
and they delay their obedience

806
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:35,500
and perhaps they show up to this place, this manger,

807
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,220
but they do not find Mary.

808
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,380
They do not find Joseph

809
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:40,340
and they do not find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes.

810
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:41,660
What do they do?

811
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:42,780
Where do they go?

812
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:44,340
Who do they tell?

813
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,900
Do you understand what I'm saying?

814
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,700
Because now all of a sudden they're looking at each other

815
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,500
and saying one to another, now what?

816
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,220
How do we find them?

817
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:56,660
Because the sign that was given to them,

818
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:59,220
according to what verse number 11 says,

819
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,460
excuse me, verse number 12,

820
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:03,340
is that you shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes

821
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:05,420
lying in a manger.

822
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:08,740
That sign that the angel gave in verse number 12,

823
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:11,260
that was significant because it showed,

824
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:14,340
it demonstrated, it proved that this is the one

825
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:16,780
that I'm speaking of that is the Messiah,

826
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:21,500
that is the Savior, that is Christ the Lord.

827
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,380
Again, perhaps there were other babies

828
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:25,660
that were born that day.

829
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:30,260
And once Mary and Joseph and Jesus leave the manger,

830
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:32,140
how do you find them?

831
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:33,179
How do you find them?

832
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,460
I understand the context.

833
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,540
None of us are going to a manger to find Jesus.

834
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:39,140
I understand that.

835
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:41,420
But I wonder in our lives,

836
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:43,619
how important is obedience to us?

837
00:38:43,619 --> 00:38:46,260
I mean, immediate obedience.

838
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:48,900
I joked the other day with someone,

839
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:52,980
I do not have Alexa, I do not want Alexa.

840
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:55,299
I do not have whatever their other names are,

841
00:38:55,299 --> 00:38:57,460
I don't want them, Echo, this, that, blah, blah, blah.

842
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,100
I think they're spying on you, man.

843
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,420
If you don't agree, that's fine, we can talk later.

844
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:04,460
But if she's listening all the time,

845
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:05,780
it doesn't matter what I'm,

846
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:07,940
anyway, that's another story for another time.

847
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:10,739
But what I'm saying is I said to somebody,

848
00:39:10,739 --> 00:39:13,220
I was at someone's house, they have Alexa.

849
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,140
You know what's kind of funny about that thing?

850
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:16,220
You say, Alexa, do this, and she does.

851
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:19,859
Alexa, do that, and she does.

852
00:39:19,859 --> 00:39:22,140
And I said to the person, I asked him to do something,

853
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:24,220
it was my dad, I was messing with him.

854
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:26,780
And we were celebrating Christmas with him on Friday

855
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:29,580
because they're up in Rhode Island, New Hampshire,

856
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:30,940
and they left yesterday,

857
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:32,980
so we celebrated Christmas with him on Friday.

858
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:34,980
And I told him something, I said, you should do this,

859
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:39,020
and he just kind of, I said, Alexa listens better than you.

860
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:41,140
And I was just kind of joking with him.

861
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:44,460
But in that statement, there's a little bit of a truth

862
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:46,140
for us as Bible-believing Christians

863
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:50,260
that we ought to obey immediately to the voice of God.

864
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:52,859
Amen?

865
00:39:54,179 --> 00:39:59,179
I mean, I see these shepherds, they were faithful.

866
00:39:59,179 --> 00:40:00,619
As God's people.

867
00:40:00,619 --> 00:40:06,019
we're to be faithful. They were attentive. Can I tell you as God's people we better

868
00:40:06,019 --> 00:40:11,779
be attentive to the Word of God. We better zero in and focus in. Let's

869
00:40:11,779 --> 00:40:15,099
eliminate distractions. Let's understand what God's telling us. Why?

870
00:40:15,099 --> 00:40:18,099
Because then and only then are we going to be able to obey the way that we're

871
00:40:18,099 --> 00:40:23,899
supposed to. There are times no doubt that we leave our time of Bible reading,

872
00:40:23,899 --> 00:40:27,659
perhaps we leave our time of being in church and we can't tell you in a

873
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:32,219
half an hour what it was that we heard or read. Because we weren't attentive. So

874
00:40:32,219 --> 00:40:36,339
if we can't even rehearse what it is that we heard or that we read, how is it

875
00:40:36,339 --> 00:40:42,499
that we would even remotely think that we'd obey it? Is that logical? If I can't

876
00:40:42,499 --> 00:40:46,259
remember what I heard or what I read this morning, there's little

877
00:40:46,259 --> 00:40:53,019
chance that I'm obeying it. Right? And so the importance of attentiveness. These

878
00:40:53,019 --> 00:40:57,979
shepherds, they were attentive. We understand that the Bible talks about

879
00:40:57,979 --> 00:41:03,099
there in the Old Testament when you read the the account of the the remnant

880
00:41:03,099 --> 00:41:06,339
returning and you read about the preaching of Ezra and all those things

881
00:41:06,339 --> 00:41:11,739
how that the people were attentive. Man, they wanted to hear the Word of God. They

882
00:41:11,739 --> 00:41:16,299
wanted to get the truth of God's Word and they wanted to to listen as we

883
00:41:16,299 --> 00:41:20,179
understand that we're to be hearers of the Word. Why? So that we can be doers of

884
00:41:20,179 --> 00:41:23,739
the Word. Right? We're not to be hearers only, deceiving our own selves. We're to

885
00:41:23,739 --> 00:41:28,339
be doers of the Word. And you know when the best time is to implement the truth

886
00:41:28,339 --> 00:41:32,619
that you receive is immediately. As soon as you're confronted with truth. When you

887
00:41:32,619 --> 00:41:37,579
read your Bible this morning, if God used his Word in your life this morning to

888
00:41:37,579 --> 00:41:42,339
confront you, to challenge you in some area of your life, the best time is to

889
00:41:42,339 --> 00:41:45,939
immediately obey. Not, well, let me think about that. Let me see. Whatever. And then

890
00:41:45,939 --> 00:41:49,499
we begin to justify and reason and, you know, before long we just forget all

891
00:41:49,499 --> 00:41:57,699
about it. And these shepherds, because of their obedience, it resulted in

892
00:41:57,699 --> 00:42:05,379
this special opportunity to find, it says in verse number 16, and found Mary and

893
00:42:05,379 --> 00:42:12,979
Joseph and the babe lying in a manger. And when they had seen it, verse 17, can

894
00:42:12,979 --> 00:42:18,779
you imagine the excitement? I mean, honestly. They made known abroad the

895
00:42:18,779 --> 00:42:24,619
saying which was told them concerning this child. This morning, we look at the

896
00:42:24,619 --> 00:42:29,339
shepherds and we consider these things and we notice these aspects as we follow

897
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:33,819
their, the verses of Scripture and follow their night, this experience that they

898
00:42:33,819 --> 00:42:37,299
had. And I think we can relate to them. I think we can learn from them. I think we

899
00:42:37,299 --> 00:42:41,779
can be challenged by them. And I just wonder this morning, how obedient are we

900
00:42:41,779 --> 00:42:45,940
to follow the Lord and to proclaim the message? See, because not only did they

901
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:50,419
follow and go, but then they made known abroad the saying which was told them

902
00:42:50,419 --> 00:42:55,699
concerning this child. I remember, and perhaps you can recall this as well, we

903
00:42:55,699 --> 00:42:59,819
can think about some Bible characters, no doubt, that we could speak of this morning,

904
00:42:59,819 --> 00:43:04,339
that when they first encountered the Lord, their excitement to share with

905
00:43:04,339 --> 00:43:08,139
someone. I mentioned a moment ago about the shepherds, that they're willing to

906
00:43:08,139 --> 00:43:11,739
tell anyone. I mean, just anyone. They're just willing to, if you don't want to

907
00:43:11,739 --> 00:43:14,699
listen, I'm gonna find somebody else. Kind of an idea. You know what I'm saying? I

908
00:43:14,779 --> 00:43:20,379
think about the record in the book of John. You don't have to turn there, but

909
00:43:20,379 --> 00:43:24,739
in John chapter number one, the Bible records for us how that John the

910
00:43:24,739 --> 00:43:30,860
Baptist, as he was looking upon Jesus in verse number 36, as Jesus was walking

911
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:35,580
there, he said, behold the Lamb of God. And you understand that the disciples, there

912
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:40,220
were two of them there, that they followed Jesus. Jesus says, what seek ye?

913
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:45,339
And they say, they said unto him, Rabbi, which is to say, being interpreted, Master,

914
00:43:45,339 --> 00:43:50,819
where dwellest thou? He said, come and see. We find that as they go there, the Bible

915
00:43:50,819 --> 00:43:55,299
tells us of some amazing things that unfold. And the Bible tells us one of the

916
00:43:55,299 --> 00:44:00,299
two which heard John speak, followed him, was Andrew. You know what he did? He went

917
00:44:00,299 --> 00:44:05,139
and found his brother, Simon Peter, immediately. And what did he do? He

918
00:44:05,139 --> 00:44:11,940
brought him to Jesus. In verse number 42, Jesus speaks to Peter. And then the day

919
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:16,619
following, he would go to Galilee and he findeth Philip. And he says to Philip,

920
00:44:16,619 --> 00:44:21,540
follow me. Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter. What does it

921
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:26,619
say in verse 45? Philip findeth Nathanael. We could look at other accounts and

922
00:44:26,619 --> 00:44:30,540
records, but what I'm saying this morning is that just as these shepherds had a

923
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:36,859
desire, an overwhelming longing and yearning to tell somebody, to make known

924
00:44:36,859 --> 00:44:41,779
abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child, I wonder as God's

925
00:44:41,779 --> 00:44:50,739
people in 2020 how we are in this area. Are we just looking for anybody

926
00:44:50,739 --> 00:44:56,979
that would listen to us tell them about Jesus? I've changed my approach prior to

927
00:44:56,979 --> 00:45:02,500
2020, but for a long time what had been taught kind of in personal

928
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:05,899
evangelism, I was in college, and how I'd been taught even with people that I

929
00:45:05,899 --> 00:45:10,419
would go out on visitation with and so on and so forth, was this kind of

930
00:45:10,419 --> 00:45:14,820
approach of inviting people to church. And I understand that I'm not suggesting

931
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:19,059
that we shouldn't invite people to church, but a while back I changed my

932
00:45:19,059 --> 00:45:23,660
approach, probably two years ago now, and instead of inviting people to church, I

933
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:27,739
asked them if I can share with them what Jesus did for me. Can I just tell

934
00:45:27,739 --> 00:45:30,540
you what Jesus did for me? Can I tell you how he changed my life? Can I tell you

935
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:35,100
how he gave me joy and peace and direction? And Joseph was with me as my

936
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:38,820
door-knocking partner the very first time on that very first Saturday that I

937
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:44,380
changed my approach, and I would say this in about 15 or 20 doors that we knocked

938
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:48,940
that morning, I had more opportunity to share the gospel with people than in

939
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:54,100
months added together. Why? Because when you say, can I invite you to church,

940
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:58,380
people are gonna have an idea about church. Maybe they had a bad experience,

941
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:01,540
maybe they have a church, maybe they're bored in church, whatever it might be, it

942
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:05,579
doesn't matter. But when I say to them, can I tell you what Jesus did for me? Can I

943
00:46:05,579 --> 00:46:11,260
tell you how he changed my life? All of a sudden there's gonna be some, what did he

944
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:14,940
do for you? How did he change your life? And what I'm saying to you this

945
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:18,380
morning is that we ought to have some excitement about telling people about

946
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:24,220
what Jesus did for us, who he is, and what he has done. And we ought to be

947
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:27,820
willing to just, listen, we're gonna have people that say, no, I'm not interested.

948
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:33,019
That's okay. Don't get discouraged. Just find somebody that will listen. Anybody

949
00:46:33,019 --> 00:46:39,979
that will listen. Amen? And what a joy. Notice as we conclude the passage, I

950
00:46:39,979 --> 00:46:45,380
notice finally from verse number 20 that these shepherds were changed. They were

951
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:50,100
changed. I think about the excitement of these shepherds as they returned. The

952
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:55,299
Bible says in verse number 20, and the shepherds returned, glorifying and

953
00:46:55,299 --> 00:47:01,179
praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen as it was told

954
00:47:01,179 --> 00:47:10,179
unto them. I would argue this morning that this event, this passage of Scripture,

955
00:47:10,179 --> 00:47:14,660
these few verses of Scripture in verses 8 through 20, I would argue this morning

956
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:18,859
that this was a life-changing experience for these shepherds. I would argue this

957
00:47:18,859 --> 00:47:24,419
morning that these shepherds, that they would at every opportunity share this

958
00:47:24,419 --> 00:47:31,019
experience. I can, in my mind's just eye, in my imagination, I see these shepherds

959
00:47:31,019 --> 00:47:36,859
returning home. You ever go home and your wife or your children say, how was work?

960
00:47:36,859 --> 00:47:44,619
It was fine. It was okay. Right? Sometimes you say, how was work? And you say, what's

961
00:47:44,619 --> 00:47:50,260
for dinner? It's just better not talk about it. You know what I mean? How was work?

962
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:55,419
Let me tell you what happened. Maybe before they were even asked, how was it

963
00:47:55,419 --> 00:47:59,859
tonight? Let me tell you what happened. I mean, as they're entering into the door,

964
00:47:59,859 --> 00:48:04,699
they barely can contain themselves to be able to share with their families what

965
00:48:04,699 --> 00:48:10,260
God had shown them and what they had experienced. I think it changed them. I

966
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:16,940
know Christ changed me. And I understand that my experience and your experience

967
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:20,660
is different than this experience. But I'm trying to look at these shepherds

968
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:24,859
and try to be helped this morning. And the Bible says if any man be in Christ,

969
00:48:24,859 --> 00:48:30,979
he's a new creature. There's a transformation that takes place. And we

970
00:48:30,979 --> 00:48:35,099
think about the power of the gospel to change lives, and I think about these

971
00:48:35,099 --> 00:48:40,219
shepherds. I'm not sure, as we look at these individuals, we don't know

972
00:48:40,219 --> 00:48:43,739
their names. We don't know their family situations. We don't know anything

973
00:48:43,739 --> 00:48:47,539
about them other than the fact that they were faithful. They were where they were

974
00:48:47,539 --> 00:48:53,260
supposed to be. They were attentive. They listened to the message of the angel.

975
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:58,739
They were obedient. They said, what are we gonna do? Let's go. And they went with

976
00:48:58,739 --> 00:49:06,299
the taste. And they were changed. And this morning, as I think about their joy and

977
00:49:06,299 --> 00:49:13,140
their excitement, as I see it in verse number 20, I would say this. I hope it

978
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:18,940
never faded away. But I would say this morning, as we would be honest one with

979
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:23,700
another, that there are times in our lives when the joy seems to slip away. It

980
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:28,299
seems to fade, if you will. Maybe we don't have the same joy and excitement to

981
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:36,460
share Christ with others as we one day did. Maybe it's just kind of gotten just

982
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:42,460
normal, just regular, just I'm a Christian, I'm saved, I'm going to heaven. And maybe

983
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:47,500
we've lost the joy of it all. Do you understand what I'm saying? It's possible in

984
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:52,779
life, by the way. It's possible when some think, listen, we see it in life when

985
00:49:52,779 --> 00:49:58,500
people buy a new car. They're excited about that new car. They wash it, they

986
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:01,820
detail it, they whatever.

987
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:05,540
And it gets a little ding, they're all tight, right, you understand?

988
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:11,020
And then all of a sudden it's just a car that maybe you're still making payments on.

989
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:14,340
And that's even worse, you understand what I'm saying?

990
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:21,700
But what I'm saying is that don't let it be the case with Jesus that it just kind of gets,

991
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:28,060
it's just, yeah, He's my Savior, no, He changed my life.

992
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:32,660
I hope this morning that if we were to go out this afternoon and if somebody were to

993
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:37,260
give us the opportunity to share with them Christ, that they would see in us the level

994
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:41,940
of joy and excitement that would be at the same level as it was the first day we met

995
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:42,940
Him.

996
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:43,940
Why?

997
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:48,980
Because we understand every day afresh what He's done for us and how He's changed our

998
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:50,340
lives.

999
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:56,900
And that we would not get into the monotony of life and just lose the freshness and the

1000
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:58,540
excitement of it.

1001
00:50:58,540 --> 00:51:04,060
Let it not fade away, but help us each day of our lives to be mindful of what Christ

1002
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:07,580
did for us and who He is to us.

1003
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:14,100
The last couple of Wednesday evenings I've been teaching a lesson, Jesus is all the world

1004
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:15,100
to me.

1005
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:20,460
We sing the song, in our songbook it's number 100.

1006
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:26,260
Peter said, to them that believe He is precious, and He is precious.

1007
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:31,700
The songwriter said, He's a wonderful Savior to me, and He is.

1008
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:36,700
And as we've taught those lessons over the last couple of weeks and given a sampling

1009
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:42,140
of answers as to why Jesus is all the world to you, if someone came to you and said, you

1010
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:47,380
sang that song, you said that Jesus is all the world, why is He all the world to you?

1011
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:51,620
I hope that we'd be able to communicate it with joy and excitement, and that they would

1012
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:59,700
see the passion and the genuine aspect of what He did for me.

1013
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:03,020
This, listen, this is not religion.

1014
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:04,660
Religion's dead.

1015
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:07,900
It's dead orthodoxy, honestly.

1016
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:14,300
But I'm talking about a relationship with the God of heaven.

1017
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:18,260
These shepherds, their lives were changed.

1018
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:23,020
And on the day that you met the Lord Jesus Christ, the day in which you got saved, your

1019
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:24,940
life was changed.

1020
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:27,220
My life was changed.

1021
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:31,620
As I look at these shepherds, oh, I'm thankful for the good tidings of great joy.

1022
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:37,380
I'm thankful for the record of Christ's birth, that it's settled historically.

1023
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:43,060
He was born, but He was born to die.

1024
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:48,260
There are many today that would acknowledge, that would recognize the coming of Christ,

1025
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:49,260
that He was born.

1026
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:51,180
But they do not know why.

1027
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:56,260
They have no concept as to why Christ was born.

1028
00:52:56,260 --> 00:53:01,460
And we have been given the truth of the Word of God, not only with regard to the record

1029
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:05,340
of His coming, but with regard to the purpose of His coming.

1030
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:12,960
And as I examine the lives of these shepherds, I pray that God would help me to be faithful.

1031
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:15,880
I pray that God would help me to be attentive.

1032
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:18,740
I pray that God would help me to be obedient.

1033
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:21,920
And I know that I'm changed.

1034
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:27,240
And I hope this morning, my prayer for you this morning is in like manner, that God would

1035
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:32,920
challenge us through the reading of this, tracing the steps of these shepherds just

1036
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:36,560
for a little while in Luke 2, verses 8 through 20.

1037
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:37,560
Let's pray together.

1038
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:42,580
Father, thank You so much for the record of Your Word.

1039
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:57,100
And thank You for the privilege of being able to gather together to sing, to worship,

1040
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:58,740
to open Your Word.

1041
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:05,420
God, I pray that the Holy Spirit of God has taken the Word of God this morning and ministered

1042
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:12,140
to each individual as only He can.

1043
00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:21,380
God that somehow in our lives, we could take a few moments and relate to these shepherds.

1044
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:29,660
God help us to have the excitement as we go into a lost and dying world and proclaim the

1045
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:33,059
truth of Thy Word.

1046
00:54:33,059 --> 00:54:36,500
These good tidings of great joy which were given to these shepherds, it was intended

1047
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:39,500
to go to all people.

1048
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:44,660
We think about the gospel and we make the link and application for us this morning.

1049
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:51,140
We've been told to go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature.

1050
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:58,820
I pray that the evidence of a changed, transformed life would have a powerful impact upon those

1051
00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:02,300
that we would share this truth with.

1052
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:05,940
Would You have Your will and way in these next few moments?

1053
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:06,940
We'll thank You for it.

1054
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:07,940
In Christ's name we pray.

1055
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:09,980
Father, would You stand with me?

1056
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:12,020
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano as she does.

1057
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:13,500
The altar's open.

1058
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:15,119
You're free to make Your pew and altar.

1059
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:18,740
You're free to come up here to this old-fashioned altar.

1060
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:22,100
But would You let God have His way in your life?

1061
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:26,260
As we relate to the shepherds this morning, I pray that God would use His Word to change

1062
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:28,500
us as Kimberly plays.
