WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.360
So thankful for the opportunity to be gathered together, thankful for the privilege of having

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.439
the Word of God, and I trust that you are as well.

00:00:09.439 --> 00:00:13.319
And by way of introduction, I'm going to read the first several verses of Luke chapter 2,

00:00:13.319 --> 00:00:18.920
though we will focus this morning on verses 8 through 20 will be the focus of our message

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.200
this morning.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.639
But by way of introduction, let me read these first seven verses to Luke chapter 2.

00:00:24.639 --> 00:00:29.319
The Bible says this, and it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:33.720
Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.720
And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.419
And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.

00:00:42.419 --> 00:00:47.599
And Joseph also went up from Galilee out of the city of Nazareth into Judea, out of the

00:00:47.599 --> 00:00:52.880
city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:59.959
David, to be taxed with Mary, his espoused wife, being great with child.

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:04.919
And so it was that while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should

00:01:04.919 --> 00:01:06.440
be delivered.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:12.279
And she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid

00:01:12.279 --> 00:01:18.400
him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:23.040
Again, we'll focus on verses 8 through 20 in this passage of Scripture this morning,

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.080
but we understand that this is a special time of year when we take some time out of our

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.699
schedules, of course, to reflect upon the birth of our Savior.

00:01:31.699 --> 00:01:36.639
We understand that we live in a world in which they have commercialized holidays and they

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:43.760
have sought to through their just materialism and other means, they've sought to reach people

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:44.959
and impact people.

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:50.120
And really, through that process, you lose the true meaning of those holidays.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.680
And we understand that to be the case here with Christmas.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.680
And the reality is that we do not know the date of the birth of our Savior.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.800
It is uncertain as to the exact date.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:06.000
However, we can rejoice greatly in the knowledge that each prophecy with regard to the coming

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.720
of Messiah has been fulfilled exactly as it had been given.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:18.000
I would say this morning that the reality of Christ's birth is a settled matter historically.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.520
I'm sure we could find some that would debate that, but I think by and large, it is a settled

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.919
truth of history that Christ was born.

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:32.919
Unfortunately, there are far too many, even those that would acknowledge the birth of

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:37.360
the Lord and Savior, our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, that they do not understand

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.759
why it is that Christ was born.

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:45.759
As we look at what the Scriptures teach us, obviously, within the passage here and other

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:52.160
portions of Scripture, we understand with great clarity as to the reason that Christ

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.160
was born.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.479
Paul says it this way in the book of Galatians as he's writing to the believers in that region

00:02:58.479 --> 00:03:05.919
in Galatians 4 and verses 4 and 5, but when the fullness of the time was come, God sent

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:10.800
forth His Son, made of a woman, made under the law, verse number 4.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:19.080
Verse number 5 says, to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.080
of sons.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:26.199
I'm so thankful that not only do we have the reality, the truth with regard to the fact

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:32.160
that Christ was born, but through the pages of Scripture, we understand the reason that

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.759
Christ was born.

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:39.119
And we understand, listen, we are privileged, I use that terminology, we are blessed to

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:46.160
be able to have the truth with regard to not only has Jesus come, but why He has come.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:52.880
Many in our world today, they do not understand the reason that Jesus Christ came to this

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:53.880
earth.

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.160
Why is it that He was born?

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:00.199
There are people today in your neighborhood, in my neighborhood, that will have Christmas

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.880
decorations, that perhaps will even have a little manger scene that they will put somewhere

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:13.279
in their home, yet they have no true understanding as to the significance of this holiday that

00:04:13.279 --> 00:04:15.759
we seek to celebrate.

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:19.660
And that's a sad thing to me, that there's so many that are in darkness.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:25.079
We understand that the enemy, the devil, seeks to keep people blinded, and no doubt the world

00:04:25.079 --> 00:04:31.119
and the materialism and the commercialism has advanced the blindness of a great host

00:04:31.119 --> 00:04:35.019
of people, not only in this country, but around the world.

00:04:35.019 --> 00:04:39.480
As we look at the record that is given in Luke chapter number 2, verses 1 through 7,

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.859
of course we could look at other portions of Scripture this morning, but as we look

00:04:43.859 --> 00:04:49.920
at the record of Christ's birth in those first seven verses, we ought to rejoice in understanding

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.799
that these prophecies that we could read of in the Old Testament were fulfilled just as

00:04:54.799 --> 00:04:56.600
they had been given.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.600
Not only do we rejoice in the record that has been provided to us, but as we continue

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.799
looking at verses 8 through 20 and really focusing this morning our attention upon these

00:05:06.799 --> 00:05:14.160
shepherds, I hope that as we examine and really try to relate to the shepherds this morning,

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:19.399
that God would challenge us through some lessons that we can learn from these shepherds.

00:05:19.399 --> 00:05:24.399
I want to draw your attention as we look at this passage of Scripture in verse numberâ€”let's

00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:27.640
look here in verse number 10, I'll give you the title for the message and we'll dig right

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:28.640
in.

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:33.480
The Bible says this in verse number 10, the angel said unto them, fear not, for behold,

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:40.119
I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.

00:05:40.119 --> 00:05:44.920
This morning if you're taking notes, I've simply entitled the message, Good Tidings

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.519
of Great Joy.

00:05:46.519 --> 00:05:49.220
Good Tidings of Great Joy.

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:53.640
As we dig in and trace the steps of these shepherds, I want you to notice as we look

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:57.799
at these shepherds just for a few moments this morning, number one, I want you to notice

00:05:57.799 --> 00:06:00.959
and consider with me that these shepherds were faithful.

00:06:00.959 --> 00:06:02.279
They were faithful.

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:05.799
If we look at verses 8 and 9, let's look at just verse number 8, notice what the Bible

00:06:05.799 --> 00:06:11.600
says here, and there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, notice what

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:17.079
it says, keeping watch over their flock by night.

00:06:17.079 --> 00:06:22.640
As I first am introduced in the account that Luke gives us of the birth of our Savior,

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:27.640
we find that quickly the attention in these verses will turn to the shepherds and to the

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:32.480
announcement of the angel, and we will trace that through verse number 20, and as we begin

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:38.079
to notice these shepherds as we're introduced to these individuals, I would find them faithfully

00:06:38.079 --> 00:06:40.279
fulfilling their responsibility.

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:44.160
They were faithful to do the work that they were supposed to be doing.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:49.000
Now, I've never been in this particular regard a shepherd.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.480
God calls pastors shepherds, obviously in a different context, but in this particular

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:59.679
context, as we think about these individuals and the responsibilities that they have, I'm

00:06:59.679 --> 00:07:04.880
mindful as I think about this night that these individuals, when they left their dwelling

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:09.959
place, when they said goodbye to their children, perhaps, as they went out to the fields that

00:07:09.959 --> 00:07:16.119
night, this was the same as it had been maybe hundreds or perhaps even thousands of times

00:07:16.119 --> 00:07:17.359
before.

00:07:17.399 --> 00:07:24.839
They were going out to watch over the flock, and sometimes as we begin to think about these

00:07:24.839 --> 00:07:28.799
shepherds and we think about what they were doing, and it says that they were abiding

00:07:28.799 --> 00:07:33.679
in the field, notice at the end of verse number 8, keeping watch over their flock by night.

00:07:33.679 --> 00:07:39.799
Though we could say that this duty, as we look at them being faithful, what we would

00:07:39.799 --> 00:07:43.040
say is that this was an essential work that they were doing.

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:49.600
This was absolutely imperative that someone would fulfill this job, this responsibility

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.600
of watching over the flock by night.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:52.600
Why?

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:57.320
Because the flock is vulnerable, and these shepherds had an important job, and faithfulness

00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:01.239
was necessary on their part to do their job.

00:08:01.239 --> 00:08:05.000
And we find that they were faithful, of course, we understand the word of God speaks much

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000
about faithfulness.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.119
I'm thankful that God's word teaches us that our God is faithful.

00:08:11.119 --> 00:08:13.399
He is dependable, he is trustworthy.

00:08:13.399 --> 00:08:20.679
I find that Paul often will rejoice and thank God for the express purpose that God is faithful.

00:08:20.679 --> 00:08:23.160
We sing, great is thy faithfulness.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:27.839
We've experienced as individual believers this morning, we have experienced the faithfulness

00:08:27.839 --> 00:08:30.119
of God.

00:08:30.119 --> 00:08:34.679
But you know that he expects us as his people to be faithful as well.

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:38.239
The Bible says in 1 Corinthians 4 and verse number 2, moreover, it's required in Stuart's

00:08:38.239 --> 00:08:40.599
that a man be found faithful.

00:08:40.599 --> 00:08:44.640
I'm mindful of what the wise man said in Proverbs 20 and verse number 6, the latter

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:49.320
part of the verse, he says, but a faithful man, who can find?

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:52.280
And if you were to read through the book of Proverbs, and perhaps you would do a study

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:57.880
on a faithful man and on an unfaithful man, you would find the great truth that God gives

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.320
us in the importance of faithfulness.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:04.119
When I look at these shepherds, when I'm first introduced to these shepherds in verse number

00:09:04.119 --> 00:09:08.919
8, the first thing that I notice, the first thing that I'm met with is the fact that they

00:09:08.919 --> 00:09:09.919
were faithful.

00:09:10.239 --> 00:09:12.520
They were faithful.

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:18.840
I believe that though, as I mentioned a moment ago, they had probably hundreds or perhaps

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:24.799
thousands of times had this same kind of routine.

00:09:24.799 --> 00:09:29.440
You go to work, you go through a routine when you leave the house, when you do whatever

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:35.119
you do, when the kids are saying bye and so on and so forth, and they had gone through

00:09:35.119 --> 00:09:38.080
this process, if they had families, right?

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:41.960
And we understand that they've gone through this process, but little did they know that

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:46.520
on this day, on this night, their life was going to change.

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:49.200
I mean, this is an amazing experience.

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:52.719
See, things were going to be different this night.

00:09:52.719 --> 00:09:57.239
These things that are going to unfold in these next few verses, they did not have the expectation

00:09:57.239 --> 00:10:00.000
that this is what was going to happen this particular night.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.240
that particular night.

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.799
But they were faithful.

00:10:02.799 --> 00:10:04.400
And because they were faithful,

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.400
they were in the place where they were supposed to be

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.579
in order to have the experience

00:10:09.579 --> 00:10:11.600
that they're going to have.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:12.760
Amen?

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:15.319
I notice not only that these shepherds were faithful,

00:10:15.319 --> 00:10:17.079
but I would say this as we continue

00:10:17.079 --> 00:10:18.680
through the passage of Scripture,

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:21.440
I notice that these shepherds were attentive.

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:22.600
They were attentive.

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:23.520
Why do we say that?

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.319
Well, they listened to what the message was

00:10:25.319 --> 00:10:26.559
and they followed it.

00:10:26.559 --> 00:10:28.360
And so there was some attentiveness

00:10:28.399 --> 00:10:31.239
to that which was being communicated to them.

00:10:31.239 --> 00:10:33.360
Notice, they're there in the night.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.360
They're watching over their flock by night.

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:36.799
And the Bible says in verse number nine,

00:10:36.799 --> 00:10:41.360
and lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:44.720
and the glory of the Lord shone round about them

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.759
and they were sore afraid.

00:10:46.759 --> 00:10:49.000
Can you relate to these shepherds just for a moment?

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.360
I mean, they're out there.

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:51.959
They've done this many times.

00:10:51.959 --> 00:10:54.439
They're watching over their flock by night.

00:10:54.439 --> 00:10:56.200
And then in a moment,

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:59.639
the Bible tells us that this angel of the Lord comes

00:10:59.639 --> 00:11:02.080
and the glory of the Lord shone round about them.

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:04.360
You'd be fearful as well.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:05.919
I mean, in this moment, I mean,

00:11:05.919 --> 00:11:08.319
I hope this morning that as we look through this passage

00:11:08.319 --> 00:11:10.919
that we can begin to relate to these shepherds

00:11:10.919 --> 00:11:13.480
and to understand what they experienced in this moment

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:14.720
and what they're dealing with.

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:18.080
And we find this scene that is explained to us here

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:19.680
in these verses of Scripture.

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:21.680
The Bible continues in verse number 10

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.160
and the angel says, fear not.

00:11:24.199 --> 00:11:28.680
I'm thankful that this was the first of the greeting

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:30.800
to these shepherds, fear not.

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:33.680
Why? Because they were sore afraid.

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:36.839
The angel said unto them, fear not.

00:11:36.839 --> 00:11:41.839
Notice, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.120
which shall be to all people.

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:49.000
In Luke 2, in verse number 10,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.080
the announcement is given to these shepherds

00:11:52.239 --> 00:11:54.000
that there was a message

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.080
that was going to be delivered to them.

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:58.720
Now, notice the way in which this message

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:01.000
is described for us in verse number 10.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.080
The message is described, we use as our title this morning,

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:08.800
good tidings of great joy, good tidings of great joy.

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.320
Now, these shepherds, again, they're out there,

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:12.160
they're in the field,

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.279
they're watching over their flock by night.

00:12:14.279 --> 00:12:16.800
This angel of the Lord appears and says, fear not,

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:19.759
and then says to these shepherds,

00:12:19.759 --> 00:12:24.639
I'm bringing you good tidings of great joy.

00:12:24.639 --> 00:12:26.720
Now, I think just that announcement

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:29.360
that perhaps they would be more attentive

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.559
because they understand that this message

00:12:31.559 --> 00:12:33.360
that is going to be delivered to them

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:37.800
is a message of good tidings and great joy.

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.199
They're going to be attentive.

00:12:39.199 --> 00:12:42.440
And you know, the attentiveness that we would have

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:44.759
as we understand what's happening here

00:12:44.759 --> 00:12:47.399
and we understand the Word of God

00:12:47.399 --> 00:12:49.479
as the Word of God week after week,

00:12:49.479 --> 00:12:51.279
day after day in your personal life

00:12:51.279 --> 00:12:52.800
as you read the Scriptures,

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:56.479
that we would be attentive to what thus saith the Lord.

00:12:56.479 --> 00:12:58.880
That as we open the pages of Scripture

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:00.479
that we would take note

00:13:00.479 --> 00:13:02.399
and that we would focus our attention,

00:13:02.399 --> 00:13:04.399
that we would eliminate the distraction

00:13:04.399 --> 00:13:08.080
so that I can be attentive to what God has for me

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:10.039
because God has a message for you.

00:13:10.039 --> 00:13:11.360
The angel had a message.

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:14.520
See, God had summons this angel to go

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:16.520
and to deliver this message to the shepherds

00:13:16.559 --> 00:13:20.520
and as these shepherds are experiencing this moment

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:22.520
and this scene, the angel says,

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:25.839
I'm bringing you good tidings of great joy.

00:13:25.839 --> 00:13:28.479
Notice what it says at the end of the verse,

00:13:28.479 --> 00:13:31.520
which shall be to all people.

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:35.759
Notice with me that in verse number 10,

00:13:35.759 --> 00:13:40.360
it says, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:43.360
which shall be to all people.

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:46.839
These shepherds, because of their faithfulness,

00:13:46.839 --> 00:13:48.240
as we mentioned in our first point,

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:49.479
because they were in the place

00:13:49.479 --> 00:13:51.199
where they were supposed to be,

00:13:51.199 --> 00:13:53.720
the angel comes and gives them this message.

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:57.240
They were privileged to receive this message.

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:59.800
But they understood right at the onset,

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:04.000
before the content of the message is even given to them,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.080
as we'll find in verse number 11,

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:09.399
before the content of the message is given to them,

00:14:09.399 --> 00:14:11.479
they are made keenly aware of the fact

00:14:11.479 --> 00:14:13.559
that this message that I'm giving you

00:14:13.559 --> 00:14:16.160
is a message of good tidings of great joy,

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:18.959
but it's for all people.

00:14:18.959 --> 00:14:21.399
This message isn't just for you.

00:14:21.399 --> 00:14:25.119
This message isn't just to be contained by yourself,

00:14:25.119 --> 00:14:26.720
something that you keep to yourself.

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:29.519
No, this message of good tidings

00:14:29.519 --> 00:14:31.799
or these good tidings of great joy,

00:14:31.799 --> 00:14:35.000
this message that will be delivered to these shepherds,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.079
it shall be to all people.

00:14:38.079 --> 00:14:40.600
That's important for us to understand.

00:14:40.679 --> 00:14:44.160
This morning as we think about the word gospel

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.959
and we'd understand the good news,

00:14:46.959 --> 00:14:48.720
the gospel of Jesus Christ,

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:51.040
that this term good tidings

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:54.359
would be a synonymous term that would be used

00:14:54.359 --> 00:14:58.440
with what we often refer to as the good news or the gospel.

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:01.279
And we find that, listen, as God's people,

00:15:01.279 --> 00:15:04.760
because you have been given the truth of the gospel,

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:07.799
you understand this morning that it's for all people.

00:15:07.799 --> 00:15:10.079
It's not for us to keep to ourselves.

00:15:10.519 --> 00:15:13.600
Someone said this, a theologian of yesteryear,

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:18.119
that Christianity is not a closed-mouth religion.

00:15:18.119 --> 00:15:20.600
Now, I don't like using the term religion

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:21.920
to describe Christianity.

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:24.559
I prefer to use the word relationship

00:15:24.559 --> 00:15:26.200
because of some of the context

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:28.839
of what people will take with that term religion.

00:15:28.839 --> 00:15:31.239
However, I agree with the theologian

00:15:31.239 --> 00:15:35.279
that we are not to be closed-mouthed about the gospel.

00:15:35.279 --> 00:15:37.119
We've been given responsibility.

00:15:37.119 --> 00:15:39.200
And these shepherds, in like fashion,

00:15:39.239 --> 00:15:41.720
as we have been entrusted with a message,

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:46.720
they are going to receive this message of great joy,

00:15:47.119 --> 00:15:49.799
but they understand at the very beginning,

00:15:49.799 --> 00:15:52.440
before the message is actually even given to them,

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:53.959
that it shall be to all people.

00:15:53.959 --> 00:15:55.959
Note the message.

00:15:55.959 --> 00:16:00.959
Verse 11, for unto you is born this day

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:04.679
in the city of David a Savior,

00:16:04.679 --> 00:16:07.200
which is Christ the Lord.

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:10.440
Isn't that a wonderful truth of the Word of God?

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:13.279
We read verses one through seven by way of introduction

00:16:13.279 --> 00:16:16.480
as we dealt with the record of the birth of Christ.

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:19.920
And we understand, even as we read verses one through seven,

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:22.399
the sovereignty and the providence of God

00:16:22.399 --> 00:16:25.720
and how that God would, at the appointed time,

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:29.959
let this one raise up and cause these taxes

00:16:29.959 --> 00:16:32.359
to be collected in these particular cities

00:16:32.359 --> 00:16:35.200
so that Mary and Joseph were in the place

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.640
where they were supposed to be.

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:40.079
Why? Because the prophecies of the birth of Messiah,

00:16:40.079 --> 00:16:42.559
that He would be born in Bethlehem.

00:16:42.559 --> 00:16:44.839
And so we see that God is working

00:16:44.839 --> 00:16:48.160
and the sovereignty of God is no doubt on display

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.119
in these first seven verses of Scripture.

00:16:50.119 --> 00:16:53.559
And we come and we understand that these shepherds

00:16:53.559 --> 00:16:56.399
are receiving this powerful message,

00:16:56.399 --> 00:16:59.040
this life-changing message with regard

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:01.880
to the birth of Messiah.

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:06.119
Notice, the place of the birth is announced

00:17:06.119 --> 00:17:08.000
in the city of David.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.359
In the city of David.

00:17:09.359 --> 00:17:11.959
You understand that Jesus is the Messiah,

00:17:11.959 --> 00:17:16.359
that He is God, that He is the Savior of the world.

00:17:16.359 --> 00:17:19.399
I'm thankful this morning that I could stand and say

00:17:19.399 --> 00:17:21.399
that He is my Savior personally,

00:17:21.399 --> 00:17:24.119
that I have personally placed my faith and trust

00:17:24.119 --> 00:17:26.519
in the finished work of Christ at Calvary.

00:17:26.519 --> 00:17:28.519
And I trust that you have as well.

00:17:28.519 --> 00:17:29.559
And we could stand and say,

00:17:29.559 --> 00:17:31.959
not only is He the Savior of the world, and He is,

00:17:31.959 --> 00:17:34.559
but He's my Savior personally.

00:17:34.559 --> 00:17:37.480
And we find that the Bible continues not only

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:40.160
to give the truth with regard to the city

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.600
in which Christ was born and this announcement,

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:45.519
this message is being given to these shepherds.

00:17:45.519 --> 00:17:46.880
It says in verse number 12,

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:49.559
and this shall be a sign unto you.

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:55.480
Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes,

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:58.119
lying in a manger.

00:17:58.119 --> 00:18:00.959
Now, if you go back and look at verse number seven with me,

00:18:00.959 --> 00:18:02.480
we read it a moment ago.

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:05.559
The Bible says that she brought forth her firstborn son

00:18:05.559 --> 00:18:08.119
and wrapped him in swaddling clothes

00:18:08.119 --> 00:18:10.160
and laid him in a manger.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:14.640
Notice this, because there was no room for them in the inn.

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:15.720
Why was there no room?

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:18.559
Well, there was a great influx of people in the city

00:18:18.559 --> 00:18:20.880
for the purpose of paying these taxes.

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:22.320
And as they would come into the city,

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:25.320
as you notice, as we've read these verses already,

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:27.160
that they were to go into their city.

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:30.640
And they went to the city of David, which is Bethlehem.

00:18:30.679 --> 00:18:34.520
And as they come, no doubt, great groups of people

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:36.640
would come for the purpose of fulfilling

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:38.119
that which was required.

00:18:38.119 --> 00:18:39.320
And they come to this place,

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:41.520
there's no room for them in the inn.

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:44.840
And Mary gives birth and they're there.

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:47.400
She wraps our Savior in swaddling clothes

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:49.200
and lays him in a manger.

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:51.760
And the angel says to these shepherds

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:54.520
that this is the sign that will be unto you,

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:57.840
that ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes,

00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:59.340
lying in a manger.

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:03.820
Now, notice the message in verses 11 and 12

00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:06.619
that is given the content of this message.

00:19:06.619 --> 00:19:09.179
I'm thankful as we're speaking about these shepherds

00:19:09.179 --> 00:19:11.460
that they were faithful, but they were attentive.

00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:13.780
I mean, can you imagine the scene

00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:17.380
as soon as the message is given in verses 11 and 12,

00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:19.619
the Bible tells us in verses 13 and 14

00:19:19.619 --> 00:19:22.500
that there was this multitude of heavenly hosts.

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:26.260
Notice it says, and suddenly there was with the angel

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:29.260
a multitude of the heavenly hosts praising God

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:32.700
and saying, glory to God in the highest,

00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:37.260
and on earth peace, goodwill toward men.

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:39.179
And it came to pass, verse 15,

00:19:39.179 --> 00:19:43.460
as the angels were gone away from them into heaven.

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:47.739
So just think about the scene for a moment.

00:19:47.739 --> 00:19:50.099
They're out in the field being faithful,

00:19:50.099 --> 00:19:54.219
doing what they have done perhaps thousands of times before

00:19:54.219 --> 00:19:56.820
and an angel appears to them.

00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:58.659
And in the moment they're fearful

00:19:58.659 --> 00:20:00.460
and the angel says, fear not.

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:03.260
but I bring you good tidings of great joy,

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:04.980
which shall be to all people.

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:08.380
For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior,

00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:10.300
which is Christ the Lord."

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:13.000
And then talks about the sign that they would receive,

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.500
that they would find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes.

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:17.660
I mean, the excitement of the time.

00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:20.380
But they were attentive to the message.

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:22.100
I'm thankful that they were attentive.

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:22.620
Why?

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:26.660
Because they couldn't say, can you repeat that to me?

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:28.300
Have you ever asked somebody something

00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:30.940
and you've not really been giving your full attention?

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:32.180
You've not been attentive.

00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:33.700
And someone's giving you directions.

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:35.500
And you kind of just wander a moment.

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:36.920
And they say, OK, have a nice day.

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:39.140
And you're like, can you repeat that?

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:41.020
I really wasn't paying attention.

00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:43.140
Listen, as soon as the message that

00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:47.620
is given to these shepherds is completed in verse number 12,

00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:50.220
there's this multitude of this heavenly host

00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:51.540
that's praising God.

00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:53.580
And they're saying, glory to God in the highest.

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:55.540
On earth, peace, goodwill toward men.

00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:58.820
And then they're gone, and the shepherds are left alone.

00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:00.740
There's no repeat.

00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:02.540
They had to be attentive.

00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:04.620
And I'm thankful that they were attentive.

00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:08.820
I'm thankful that these individuals, these messengers,

00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:11.140
that on this night that they were faithful,

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:14.260
but I'm thankful that they were attentive to that which

00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:15.900
had been delivered to them.

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:19.460
Again, as I begin to note here and think about the scene that

00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:22.660
has unfolded before us, I think about the experience

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:25.540
of these shepherds and what a joyous experience it was,

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:27.700
no doubt.

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:30.100
And now, as I mentioned a moment ago,

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:32.600
they're left in verse number 15.

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:35.380
The Bible says, it came to pass as the angels were gone away

00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:37.500
from them into heaven.

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:39.060
Now think about that.

00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:40.660
I don't know how many shepherds it was.

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:42.780
It's plural, so it was more than one.

00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:44.460
I don't know how many.

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:47.660
But can you imagine just for a moment being in this situation?

00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:52.260
I mean, what has just happened is

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:55.540
so outside of the ordinary, something they'd never

00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:57.580
experienced before.

00:21:57.580 --> 00:22:01.060
They're there, and they didn't expect this to happen.

00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:02.660
But because of being faithful, they're

00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:04.400
in the place where they're supposed to be.

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:05.660
They receive this message.

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:07.040
They're attentive to the message.

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:08.500
And notice what they say.

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:12.740
Let us, look, it says this, the shepherds said one to another.

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:14.940
So there's a little conferring, if you will.

00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:17.100
There's a little discussion that takes place.

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:18.420
They say one to another.

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:23.420
Notice, let us now go even unto Bethlehem

00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:25.540
and see this thing which has come

00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:31.460
to pass which the Lord hath made known unto us.

00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:34.140
As we continue to trace the steps of the shepherds,

00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:35.540
I find that they were faithful.

00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:36.840
I find that they were attentive.

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:39.820
I find, number three, that they were obedient.

00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:41.740
They were obedient.

00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:44.260
They had been given this message,

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:46.540
and they had been given the truth

00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:50.020
of that momentous occasion, what had happened

00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:55.580
on this particular day, that the Son of God, the incarnation

00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:57.060
that he was born.

00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:59.500
Remember, as we look at the pages of scriptures,

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:01.620
we note it already in the book of Philippians,

00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:04.460
but we note what Paul says in the book of,

00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:05.740
I mentioned Galatians.

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:07.860
Notice in Philippians chapter number two,

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:11.780
as we consider the incarnation of our Savior,

00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:13.820
the Bible tells us in Philippians chapter

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:16.860
number two, verses six through nine,

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:18.820
really down through verse number 11.

00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:21.620
But notice in verse number six of Philippians chapter number

00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:25.380
two, the Bible says, who being in the form of God,

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:29.100
thought it not robbery to be equal with God,

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:31.740
but made himself of no reputation,

00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:33.460
and took upon him the form of a servant,

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:36.900
was made in the likeness of men, and being found in fashion

00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:41.500
as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient unto death

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:43.300
even the death of the cross.

00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:46.020
Wherefore, God also hath highly exalted him

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:48.500
and given him a name which is above every name.

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:50.740
The name of Jesus every knee should

00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:52.980
bow of things in heaven, and things in earth,

00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:54.180
and things under the earth.

00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:55.780
And that every tongue should confess

00:23:55.780 --> 00:24:01.860
that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father.

00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:06.260
The incarnation that we speak of and we remember,

00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:10.300
especially at this time of year, these shepherds

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:12.700
had just been given the announcement

00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:15.140
that Messiah has come.

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:16.700
And now the angel's gone.

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:19.260
I'm thankful that they were obedient.

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:23.380
They said, let us go, let us now go, even unto Bethlehem,

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:25.620
and see this thing which has come to pass,

00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:29.780
notice where it says, which the Lord hath made known unto us.

00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:32.820
Notice the first phrase of verse number 16.

00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:36.820
And they came with haste.

00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:39.660
The obedience of these shepherds was,

00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:41.940
an immediate obedience.

00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:44.540
I think about the excitement again of the moment.

00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:46.420
I think about all that they had experienced

00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:48.500
and what they had just been informed of.

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:53.260
And the angel departs and they say one to another, let us go.

00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:55.740
And they go with haste.

00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:57.740
And we find that as they are obedient,

00:24:57.740 --> 00:25:02.900
that their obedience resulted in a special opportunity.

00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:05.540
Notice the Bible tells us in verse number 16

00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:07.100
that they came with haste, notice,

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:16.500
and found Mary and Joseph and the babe lying in a manger.

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:19.860
They found it just as they had been told.

00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:22.500
The angel said, in verse number 11,

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:25.860
for unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior,

00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:27.420
which is Christ the Lord.

00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:29.620
The angel continued, this shall be a sign unto you,

00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:31.860
you shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes,

00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:33.540
lying in a manger.

00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:36.940
See, they were going to find Messiah, the Son of God,

00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:39.980
perhaps there had been other babies that were born that day.

00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:42.020
Perhaps there'd be other parents that were rejoicing

00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:44.100
in the birth of their children on that day.

00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:45.860
But this is God in flesh.

00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:47.580
This is the incarnation.

00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:49.580
And we find that he says, the angel says,

00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:50.700
go to the city of David.

00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:52.500
They say, we're going to Bethlehem.

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:54.300
Why? That's the city of David.

00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:56.500
The angel said, you're going to find the babe wrapped

00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:58.660
in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.

00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:00.780
And the Bible tells us in verse number 16

00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:03.980
that they came with haste and they found Mary and Joseph

00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:07.460
and the babe lying in a manger.

00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:10.100
It says to us in verse number 17,

00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:13.420
and when they had seen it,

00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:15.660
they made known abroad the saying

00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:19.540
which was told them concerning this child.

00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:21.580
As I begin to think about their obedience,

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:25.580
I find that their obedience resulted in this special opportunity

00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:27.380
that we find in verse number 16.

00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:30.700
But I also, as I consider their obedience this morning,

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:33.660
I noticed that in verse number 17 that they were obedient

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:38.540
not only to go to the place where they were told that Messiah would be,

00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:41.460
but they were obedient to proclaim the message

00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:43.540
that they were supposed to proclaim.

00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:46.700
See, because the message as it's contained for us in verse number 10,

00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:51.100
the angel says, fear not, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy.

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:54.780
Remember, which shall be to all people.

00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:56.420
Which shall be to all people.

00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:59.540
And so now, as they have been entrusted with this message,

00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:01.940
as they have received this message,

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:04.340
remember what they said at the end of verse number 15,

00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:08.340
which the Lord hath made known unto us.

00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:10.260
And so they had been entrusted with this message,

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:13.860
with this truth with regard to the birth of Messiah.

00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:16.300
The Bible says that when they had seen it,

00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:17.740
notice verse 17,

00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:21.140
they made known abroad the saying

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:23.420
which was told them concerning this child.

00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:25.260
What is it that they made known?

00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:29.100
For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior,

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:31.180
which is Christ the Lord.

00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:32.460
You know what they proclaimed?

00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:34.460
The Messiah has been born.

00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:35.820
Christ has been born.

00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:38.500
That's the message that they proclaimed, no doubt.

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:41.580
Because it says here that they made abroad the saying

00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:44.500
which was told them concerning this child.

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:47.260
Now you understand as we compare Scripture with Scripture,

00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:49.380
begin to think about the names of Christ

00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:52.180
and the significance of the birth of Christ.

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:55.300
You'll go back, hold your place there in Luke 2,

00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:57.620
go back to Matthew 1 if you will,

00:27:57.620 --> 00:27:59.340
as we understand the significance

00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:02.820
these men would have been familiar with the Old Testament.

00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:05.900
We think about the announcement of the peace

00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:08.980
that had been given there in Luke 2

00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:12.340
when they were singing and praising God on earth,

00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:14.180
peace, goodwill toward men.

00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:17.140
Remember Isaiah prophesied that his name shall be

00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:21.500
the Prince of Peace was one of the names that was given.

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:25.300
But here in Matthew 1 in verse 18,

00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:28.340
the Bible says now the birth of Jesus Christ

00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:30.060
was on this wise.

00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:32.500
When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph

00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:33.580
before they came together,

00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:36.059
she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.

00:28:36.059 --> 00:28:38.140
Then Joseph, her husband being a just man

00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:40.540
and not willing to make her a public example

00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:43.260
was minded to put her away privily.

00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:44.860
But while he thought on these things,

00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:47.580
behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream

00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:49.580
saying, Joseph, thou son of David,

00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:52.340
fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife

00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:54.660
for that which is conceived in hers of the Holy Ghost

00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:56.780
and she shall bring forth a son

00:28:56.780 --> 00:28:59.260
and thou shall call his name Jesus.

00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:00.420
Why?

00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:05.340
For he shall save his people from their sins.

00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:09.179
Verse 22, now all this was done that it might be fulfilled

00:29:09.179 --> 00:29:11.780
which was spoken to the Lord by the prophet saying,

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:14.420
behold, a virgin shall be with child

00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:16.340
and shall bring forth a son

00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:18.660
and they shall call his name Emmanuel

00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:23.660
which being interpreted is God with us.

00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:26.020
Then Joseph being raised from sleep

00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:27.500
did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:29.100
and took unto him his wife

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:30.820
and knew her not till she had brought forth

00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:34.380
her firstborn son and he called his name Jesus.

00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:37.380
Here in Matthew one, we see the name Jesus,

00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:38.780
we see the name Emmanuel

00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:40.380
and we understand the significance

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:45.020
as this angel then appears in Luke chapter number two

00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:48.380
to these shepherds and shares with them

00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:51.020
that Christ is born, he is the savior,

00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:53.660
he is the Lord that they go forth.

00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:55.220
Listen, his name is Jesus.

00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:56.059
Why?

00:29:56.059 --> 00:29:58.500
For he shall save his people from their sins.

00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:00.140
How is he gonna accomplish that?

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:03.920
through the cross, through the shed blood at Calvary,

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:06.240
his death, burial, and glorious resurrection.

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:08.200
That's how he's gonna accomplish the fact

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:10.280
that they would be saved from their sins.

00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:12.400
His name shall be called Emmanuel

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:14.480
from Isaiah chapter number seven,

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:17.060
which is being interpreted God with us.

00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:17.900
Why?

00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:21.120
The incarnation, Jesus Christ is God in the flesh.

00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:24.880
And we find the significance here of these names

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:26.920
that are mentioned in Matthew's gospel,

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:30.400
and we find these shepherds are now making abroad

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:33.100
the saying which was told them concerning this child.

00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:38.620
The Bible says in verse number 18 of Luke chapter number two,

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:41.300
and all they that heard it wondered at those things

00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:43.680
which were told them by the shepherds.

00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:45.900
You know what I find in verse number 18

00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:49.220
is proof or evidence of the fact

00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:51.820
that they did talk to people

00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:54.660
and give the truth that they had been given.

00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:57.460
They delivered the message to people

00:30:57.460 --> 00:31:00.640
that they had been entrusted with unto you.

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:02.540
It says there in verse number 10,

00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:04.700
I bring you good tidings of great joy

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:06.340
which shall be to all people.

00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:09.500
I'm not sure how many people they were able to find.

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:11.420
I'm not sure where they found the people.

00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:13.820
I'm not sure of all that's going on,

00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:15.940
but in my mind I see these shepherds

00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:17.820
overwhelmed with excitement,

00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:20.260
not only because of what they had experienced

00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:21.420
out there in the field,

00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:23.460
but now as they enter into the city

00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:24.700
and they come to the manger

00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:27.100
and they find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes

00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:30.620
just as the angel had said they needed to tell somebody.

00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:32.660
They were willing to tell anybody.

00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:33.760
Amen?

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:34.600
Why?

00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:35.620
Because of what they'd experienced

00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:36.740
and what they had seen.

00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:38.780
And the Bible says in verse number 18,

00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:42.500
and all they that heard it wondered at those things

00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:44.460
which were told them by the shepherds.

00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:46.540
There were a group of people that heard

00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:49.340
the message that the shepherds proclaimed.

00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:50.500
They greatly wondered,

00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:52.020
the Bible tells us in verse number 19,

00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:53.300
but Mary kept all these things

00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:55.740
and pondered them in her heart.

00:31:57.020 --> 00:32:00.540
I want you to think about the obedience of these shepherds.

00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:03.300
And I want you to consider how their obedience

00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:05.100
resulted in a special opportunity.

00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:07.060
We started with their faithfulness

00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:09.420
and how that because they were faithful,

00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:11.900
they had the opportunity to receive that message

00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:13.100
from the angel.

00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:15.380
Can you imagine if one of them decided

00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:17.660
they weren't gonna be there that night?

00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:19.620
Man, that was the wrong night to call out.

00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:20.700
You understand what I'm saying?

00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:22.180
It was the wrong night to miss church.

00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:23.020
It was the wrong day.

00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:23.980
Listen, Thomas found out

00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:25.300
it was the wrong night to miss church.

00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:26.140
Why?

00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:28.300
Because Jesus showed up, right?

00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:29.780
Read it in John.

00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:31.180
You find here these shepherds,

00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:34.460
listen, I think they were happy that they were there.

00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:35.820
They were faithful.

00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:37.260
They were attentive.

00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:39.060
They heard the message

00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:41.220
and they were able to go in obedience

00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:44.540
and go to exactly the place where they were supposed to go

00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:46.340
because they had been attentive to the message.

00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:47.340
Can you imagine?

00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:48.220
What did they say again?

00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:49.900
Where did they say we're supposed to go?

00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:51.460
What are we supposed to find?

00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:53.460
No, no, they were attentive.

00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:56.340
Their obedience resulted in this special opportunity.

00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:58.180
I ask you this question this morning,

00:32:58.180 --> 00:32:59.860
what if they had disobeyed?

00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:04.020
Or perhaps I ask it this way,

00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:05.620
what if they simply delayed?

00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:07.660
What if they said, you know what,

00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:09.220
there's no urgency in obeying.

00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:12.820
We can get around to it at some point.

00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:14.500
We don't have to go right now.

00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:17.340
I would submit to you that as you compare scripture

00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:19.740
with scripture, go back to Matthew, if you will.

00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:24.660
I believe, and if you disagree, we can talk later,

00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:26.540
but I believe that if these shepherds

00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:31.140
had just simply delayed their obedience,

00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:33.180
that they would not have found Jesus

00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:36.700
in that manger wrapped in swaddling clothes

00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:39.620
because the Bible record tells us in Matthew

00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:42.660
in chapter number two, we're introduced to the wise men.

00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:45.380
The wise men come from far.

00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:47.500
The Bible says that when they come into Jerusalem,

00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:50.500
they say here, as we look at what's going on,

00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:52.460
they say to Herod in verse number two,

00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:54.300
where is he that is born king of the Jews?

00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:55.940
For we have seen a star in the east

00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:57.740
and are come to worship him.

00:33:57.740 --> 00:33:59.460
Herod the king had heard,

00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:01.340
when Herod the king had heard these things,

00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:03.220
he was troubled and all Jerusalem with him.

00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:06.260
Notice verse four of Matthew two.

00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:07.780
And when he had gathered all the chief priests

00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:09.260
and scribes of the people together,

00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:11.580
he demanded of them where Christ should be born.

00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:13.460
And they said unto him in Bethlehem of Judea,

00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:15.460
for thus it is written by the prophet.

00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:17.180
We understand that you go back to Micah

00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:18.700
and you can read of that.

00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:19.580
You understand the fulfillment of prophecy.

00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:21.980
That's why I said in Luke chapter number two,

00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:23.140
in those first seven verses,

00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:25.660
you see the providence and sovereignty of God.

00:34:25.660 --> 00:34:26.940
How did they end up in Bethlehem?

00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:29.940
They weren't, that's not where they lived,

00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:31.700
but they were there because of the taxing

00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:32.740
and they had to go there.

00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:33.580
And that's where he was born.

00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:34.900
Notice in verse number six,

00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:37.340
and thou Bethlehem, this is the record of Micah five

00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:39.140
in verse number two in the land of Judah,

00:34:39.140 --> 00:34:41.100
art not the least among the princes of Judah

00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:42.780
for out of these shall come a governor

00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:44.380
that shall rule my people Israel.

00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:46.420
Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men

00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:47.740
and inquired of them diligently,

00:34:47.740 --> 00:34:49.260
what time the star appeared.

00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:50.860
And he sent them to Bethlehem and said,

00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:53.100
go and search diligently for the young child.

00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:54.340
And when you have found him,

00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:57.380
bring me word again that I may come and worship him also.

00:34:57.380 --> 00:34:58.860
The Bible tells us in verse number nine,

00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:00.940
when they had heard the king, they departed.

00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:02.620
These wise men depart.

00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:03.940
The Bible says in lo the star,

00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:06.100
which they saw in the East went before them

00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:09.180
till it came and stood over where the young child was.

00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:10.280
Where was he?

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:12.060
Verse number 10, it says, when they saw the star,

00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:13.540
they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.

00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:15.940
And when they were come into, what does it say?

00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:19.060
Does it say the house in your Bible?

00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:21.420
It doesn't say the manger, does it?

00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:22.620
Came into the house.

00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:26.300
I believe this morning that if these shepherds

00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:27.860
would have delayed their obedience,

00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:30.660
they would not have found Jesus in the manger.

00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:32.460
Jesus didn't stay in the manger long.

00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:34.020
Why was he in the manger?

00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:35.580
There was no room in the inn.

00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:36.900
Why was there no room in the inn?

00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:38.180
Because there are a lot of people in town

00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:39.560
to pay their taxes.

00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:41.420
By the way, if you came into town to pay taxes

00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:42.460
and had to pay to stay in an inn,

00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:44.540
you'd leave pretty quick.

00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:46.340
Amen, you get your business transaction done

00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:48.700
and you get back to your hometown.

00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:49.540
Does that make sense?

00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:51.140
I mean, it makes sense in my mind.

00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:53.660
And so guess what happens?

00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:55.580
There's room in the inn.

00:35:55.580 --> 00:35:58.060
There's a place to stay.

00:35:58.060 --> 00:35:59.780
They probably wouldn't have immediately,

00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:01.980
and if you've given birth, you could relate.

00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:03.580
You're probably not ready to take a journey

00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:06.460
back to your hometown of Nazareth

00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:10.260
by way of either walking or a camel or donkey.

00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:11.960
Amen, I've never given birth,

00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:14.060
but my wife has given birth three times.

00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:15.660
I'm pretty confident that she would not

00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:17.420
have been delighted if I said,

00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:20.260
let's get on the camel and head back to town.

00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:21.260
This is not gonna work.

00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:24.140
I mean, I'm trying to just help us this morning

00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:26.020
because what I'm trying to help us understand

00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:29.700
is the importance of obedience, immediate obedience.

00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:33.500
Had they delayed, see, their immediate obedience

00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:37.140
resulted in an opportunity that was unlike

00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:39.580
any other thing they'd ever experienced.

00:36:39.580 --> 00:36:41.740
They get to the manger

00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:45.500
because they immediately obeyed

00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:47.260
what the angel of the Lord said.

00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:50.220
They get to the manger and they find Mary

00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:53.100
and they find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes.

00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:55.100
We mentioned that they come to the house,

00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:56.820
these wise men in verse number 11

00:36:56.820 --> 00:36:57.860
of Matthew chapter number two.

00:36:57.860 --> 00:37:00.260
Again, I don't believe that these shepherds

00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:02.140
of chapter number two of the book of Luke

00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:05.140
that they would have found Mary and Joseph

00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:09.180
and the babe, Jesus Christ, our Savior, the Messiah,

00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:10.060
the Savior of the world,

00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:12.300
they would not have found Him lying in a manger.

00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:13.660
And then what happens?

00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:16.580
Can you imagine?

00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:17.420
Just for a moment.

00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:19.300
I mean, let's use our sanctified imaginations

00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:20.220
just for a moment.

00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:22.540
Now these shepherds, they delay their obedience.

00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:24.780
They don't go to the city of Bethlehem.

00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:27.020
They don't do what the angel had said.

00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:30.060
They don't go and find what had been announced to them

00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:31.580
and they delay their obedience

00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:35.500
and perhaps they show up to this place, this manger,

00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:37.220
but they do not find Mary.

00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:38.380
They do not find Joseph

00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:40.340
and they do not find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes.

00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:41.660
What do they do?

00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:42.780
Where do they go?

00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:44.340
Who do they tell?

00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:45.900
Do you understand what I'm saying?

00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:47.700
Because now all of a sudden they're looking at each other

00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:49.500
and saying one to another, now what?

00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:53.220
How do we find them?

00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:56.660
Because the sign that was given to them,

00:37:56.660 --> 00:37:59.220
according to what verse number 11 says,

00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:00.460
excuse me, verse number 12,

00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:03.340
is that you shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes

00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:05.420
lying in a manger.

00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:08.740
That sign that the angel gave in verse number 12,

00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:11.260
that was significant because it showed,

00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:14.340
it demonstrated, it proved that this is the one

00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:16.780
that I'm speaking of that is the Messiah,

00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:21.500
that is the Savior, that is Christ the Lord.

00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:23.380
Again, perhaps there were other babies

00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:25.660
that were born that day.

00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:30.260
And once Mary and Joseph and Jesus leave the manger,

00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:32.140
how do you find them?

00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:33.179
How do you find them?

00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:35.460
I understand the context.

00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:37.540
None of us are going to a manger to find Jesus.

00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:39.140
I understand that.

00:38:39.140 --> 00:38:41.420
But I wonder in our lives,

00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:43.619
how important is obedience to us?

00:38:43.619 --> 00:38:46.260
I mean, immediate obedience.

00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:48.900
I joked the other day with someone,

00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:52.980
I do not have Alexa, I do not want Alexa.

00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:55.299
I do not have whatever their other names are,

00:38:55.299 --> 00:38:57.460
I don't want them, Echo, this, that, blah, blah, blah.

00:38:57.460 --> 00:38:59.100
I think they're spying on you, man.

00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:01.420
If you don't agree, that's fine, we can talk later.

00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:04.460
But if she's listening all the time,

00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:05.780
it doesn't matter what I'm,

00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:07.940
anyway, that's another story for another time.

00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:10.739
But what I'm saying is I said to somebody,

00:39:10.739 --> 00:39:13.220
I was at someone's house, they have Alexa.

00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:14.140
You know what's kind of funny about that thing?

00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:16.220
You say, Alexa, do this, and she does.

00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:19.859
Alexa, do that, and she does.

00:39:19.859 --> 00:39:22.140
And I said to the person, I asked him to do something,

00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:24.220
it was my dad, I was messing with him.

00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:26.780
And we were celebrating Christmas with him on Friday

00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:29.580
because they're up in Rhode Island, New Hampshire,

00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:30.940
and they left yesterday,

00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:32.980
so we celebrated Christmas with him on Friday.

00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:34.980
And I told him something, I said, you should do this,

00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:39.020
and he just kind of, I said, Alexa listens better than you.

00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:41.140
And I was just kind of joking with him.

00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:44.460
But in that statement, there's a little bit of a truth

00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:46.140
for us as Bible-believing Christians

00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:50.260
that we ought to obey immediately to the voice of God.

00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:52.859
Amen?

00:39:54.179 --> 00:39:59.179
I mean, I see these shepherds, they were faithful.

00:39:59.179 --> 00:40:00.619
As God's people.

00:40:00.619 --> 00:40:06.019
we're to be faithful. They were attentive. Can I tell you as God's people we better

00:40:06.019 --> 00:40:11.779
be attentive to the Word of God. We better zero in and focus in. Let's

00:40:11.779 --> 00:40:15.099
eliminate distractions. Let's understand what God's telling us. Why?

00:40:15.099 --> 00:40:18.099
Because then and only then are we going to be able to obey the way that we're

00:40:18.099 --> 00:40:23.899
supposed to. There are times no doubt that we leave our time of Bible reading,

00:40:23.899 --> 00:40:27.659
perhaps we leave our time of being in church and we can't tell you in a

00:40:27.659 --> 00:40:32.219
half an hour what it was that we heard or read. Because we weren't attentive. So

00:40:32.219 --> 00:40:36.339
if we can't even rehearse what it is that we heard or that we read, how is it

00:40:36.339 --> 00:40:42.499
that we would even remotely think that we'd obey it? Is that logical? If I can't

00:40:42.499 --> 00:40:46.259
remember what I heard or what I read this morning, there's little

00:40:46.259 --> 00:40:53.019
chance that I'm obeying it. Right? And so the importance of attentiveness. These

00:40:53.019 --> 00:40:57.979
shepherds, they were attentive. We understand that the Bible talks about

00:40:57.979 --> 00:41:03.099
there in the Old Testament when you read the the account of the the remnant

00:41:03.099 --> 00:41:06.339
returning and you read about the preaching of Ezra and all those things

00:41:06.339 --> 00:41:11.739
how that the people were attentive. Man, they wanted to hear the Word of God. They

00:41:11.739 --> 00:41:16.299
wanted to get the truth of God's Word and they wanted to to listen as we

00:41:16.299 --> 00:41:20.179
understand that we're to be hearers of the Word. Why? So that we can be doers of

00:41:20.179 --> 00:41:23.739
the Word. Right? We're not to be hearers only, deceiving our own selves. We're to

00:41:23.739 --> 00:41:28.339
be doers of the Word. And you know when the best time is to implement the truth

00:41:28.339 --> 00:41:32.619
that you receive is immediately. As soon as you're confronted with truth. When you

00:41:32.619 --> 00:41:37.579
read your Bible this morning, if God used his Word in your life this morning to

00:41:37.579 --> 00:41:42.339
confront you, to challenge you in some area of your life, the best time is to

00:41:42.339 --> 00:41:45.939
immediately obey. Not, well, let me think about that. Let me see. Whatever. And then

00:41:45.939 --> 00:41:49.499
we begin to justify and reason and, you know, before long we just forget all

00:41:49.499 --> 00:41:57.699
about it. And these shepherds, because of their obedience, it resulted in

00:41:57.699 --> 00:42:05.379
this special opportunity to find, it says in verse number 16, and found Mary and

00:42:05.379 --> 00:42:12.979
Joseph and the babe lying in a manger. And when they had seen it, verse 17, can

00:42:12.979 --> 00:42:18.779
you imagine the excitement? I mean, honestly. They made known abroad the

00:42:18.779 --> 00:42:24.619
saying which was told them concerning this child. This morning, we look at the

00:42:24.619 --> 00:42:29.339
shepherds and we consider these things and we notice these aspects as we follow

00:42:29.339 --> 00:42:33.819
their, the verses of Scripture and follow their night, this experience that they

00:42:33.819 --> 00:42:37.299
had. And I think we can relate to them. I think we can learn from them. I think we

00:42:37.299 --> 00:42:41.779
can be challenged by them. And I just wonder this morning, how obedient are we

00:42:41.779 --> 00:42:45.940
to follow the Lord and to proclaim the message? See, because not only did they

00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:50.419
follow and go, but then they made known abroad the saying which was told them

00:42:50.419 --> 00:42:55.699
concerning this child. I remember, and perhaps you can recall this as well, we

00:42:55.699 --> 00:42:59.819
can think about some Bible characters, no doubt, that we could speak of this morning,

00:42:59.819 --> 00:43:04.339
that when they first encountered the Lord, their excitement to share with

00:43:04.339 --> 00:43:08.139
someone. I mentioned a moment ago about the shepherds, that they're willing to

00:43:08.139 --> 00:43:11.739
tell anyone. I mean, just anyone. They're just willing to, if you don't want to

00:43:11.739 --> 00:43:14.699
listen, I'm gonna find somebody else. Kind of an idea. You know what I'm saying? I

00:43:14.779 --> 00:43:20.379
think about the record in the book of John. You don't have to turn there, but

00:43:20.379 --> 00:43:24.739
in John chapter number one, the Bible records for us how that John the

00:43:24.739 --> 00:43:30.860
Baptist, as he was looking upon Jesus in verse number 36, as Jesus was walking

00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:35.580
there, he said, behold the Lamb of God. And you understand that the disciples, there

00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:40.220
were two of them there, that they followed Jesus. Jesus says, what seek ye?

00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:45.339
And they say, they said unto him, Rabbi, which is to say, being interpreted, Master,

00:43:45.339 --> 00:43:50.819
where dwellest thou? He said, come and see. We find that as they go there, the Bible

00:43:50.819 --> 00:43:55.299
tells us of some amazing things that unfold. And the Bible tells us one of the

00:43:55.299 --> 00:44:00.299
two which heard John speak, followed him, was Andrew. You know what he did? He went

00:44:00.299 --> 00:44:05.139
and found his brother, Simon Peter, immediately. And what did he do? He

00:44:05.139 --> 00:44:11.940
brought him to Jesus. In verse number 42, Jesus speaks to Peter. And then the day

00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:16.619
following, he would go to Galilee and he findeth Philip. And he says to Philip,

00:44:16.619 --> 00:44:21.540
follow me. Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter. What does it

00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:26.619
say in verse 45? Philip findeth Nathanael. We could look at other accounts and

00:44:26.619 --> 00:44:30.540
records, but what I'm saying this morning is that just as these shepherds had a

00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:36.859
desire, an overwhelming longing and yearning to tell somebody, to make known

00:44:36.859 --> 00:44:41.779
abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child, I wonder as God's

00:44:41.779 --> 00:44:50.739
people in 2020 how we are in this area. Are we just looking for anybody

00:44:50.739 --> 00:44:56.979
that would listen to us tell them about Jesus? I've changed my approach prior to

00:44:56.979 --> 00:45:02.500
2020, but for a long time what had been taught kind of in personal

00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:05.899
evangelism, I was in college, and how I'd been taught even with people that I

00:45:05.899 --> 00:45:10.419
would go out on visitation with and so on and so forth, was this kind of

00:45:10.419 --> 00:45:14.820
approach of inviting people to church. And I understand that I'm not suggesting

00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:19.059
that we shouldn't invite people to church, but a while back I changed my

00:45:19.059 --> 00:45:23.660
approach, probably two years ago now, and instead of inviting people to church, I

00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:27.739
asked them if I can share with them what Jesus did for me. Can I just tell

00:45:27.739 --> 00:45:30.540
you what Jesus did for me? Can I tell you how he changed my life? Can I tell you

00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:35.100
how he gave me joy and peace and direction? And Joseph was with me as my

00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:38.820
door-knocking partner the very first time on that very first Saturday that I

00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:44.380
changed my approach, and I would say this in about 15 or 20 doors that we knocked

00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:48.940
that morning, I had more opportunity to share the gospel with people than in

00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:54.100
months added together. Why? Because when you say, can I invite you to church,

00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:58.380
people are gonna have an idea about church. Maybe they had a bad experience,

00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:01.540
maybe they have a church, maybe they're bored in church, whatever it might be, it

00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:05.579
doesn't matter. But when I say to them, can I tell you what Jesus did for me? Can I

00:46:05.579 --> 00:46:11.260
tell you how he changed my life? All of a sudden there's gonna be some, what did he

00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:14.940
do for you? How did he change your life? And what I'm saying to you this

00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:18.380
morning is that we ought to have some excitement about telling people about

00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:24.220
what Jesus did for us, who he is, and what he has done. And we ought to be

00:46:24.220 --> 00:46:27.820
willing to just, listen, we're gonna have people that say, no, I'm not interested.

00:46:27.820 --> 00:46:33.019
That's okay. Don't get discouraged. Just find somebody that will listen. Anybody

00:46:33.019 --> 00:46:39.979
that will listen. Amen? And what a joy. Notice as we conclude the passage, I

00:46:39.979 --> 00:46:45.380
notice finally from verse number 20 that these shepherds were changed. They were

00:46:45.380 --> 00:46:50.100
changed. I think about the excitement of these shepherds as they returned. The

00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:55.299
Bible says in verse number 20, and the shepherds returned, glorifying and

00:46:55.299 --> 00:47:01.179
praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen as it was told

00:47:01.179 --> 00:47:10.179
unto them. I would argue this morning that this event, this passage of Scripture,

00:47:10.179 --> 00:47:14.660
these few verses of Scripture in verses 8 through 20, I would argue this morning

00:47:14.660 --> 00:47:18.859
that this was a life-changing experience for these shepherds. I would argue this

00:47:18.859 --> 00:47:24.419
morning that these shepherds, that they would at every opportunity share this

00:47:24.419 --> 00:47:31.019
experience. I can, in my mind's just eye, in my imagination, I see these shepherds

00:47:31.019 --> 00:47:36.859
returning home. You ever go home and your wife or your children say, how was work?

00:47:36.859 --> 00:47:44.619
It was fine. It was okay. Right? Sometimes you say, how was work? And you say, what's

00:47:44.619 --> 00:47:50.260
for dinner? It's just better not talk about it. You know what I mean? How was work?

00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:55.419
Let me tell you what happened. Maybe before they were even asked, how was it

00:47:55.419 --> 00:47:59.859
tonight? Let me tell you what happened. I mean, as they're entering into the door,

00:47:59.859 --> 00:48:04.699
they barely can contain themselves to be able to share with their families what

00:48:04.699 --> 00:48:10.260
God had shown them and what they had experienced. I think it changed them. I

00:48:10.260 --> 00:48:16.940
know Christ changed me. And I understand that my experience and your experience

00:48:16.940 --> 00:48:20.660
is different than this experience. But I'm trying to look at these shepherds

00:48:20.660 --> 00:48:24.859
and try to be helped this morning. And the Bible says if any man be in Christ,

00:48:24.859 --> 00:48:30.979
he's a new creature. There's a transformation that takes place. And we

00:48:30.979 --> 00:48:35.099
think about the power of the gospel to change lives, and I think about these

00:48:35.099 --> 00:48:40.219
shepherds. I'm not sure, as we look at these individuals, we don't know

00:48:40.219 --> 00:48:43.739
their names. We don't know their family situations. We don't know anything

00:48:43.739 --> 00:48:47.539
about them other than the fact that they were faithful. They were where they were

00:48:47.539 --> 00:48:53.260
supposed to be. They were attentive. They listened to the message of the angel.

00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:58.739
They were obedient. They said, what are we gonna do? Let's go. And they went with

00:48:58.739 --> 00:49:06.299
the taste. And they were changed. And this morning, as I think about their joy and

00:49:06.299 --> 00:49:13.140
their excitement, as I see it in verse number 20, I would say this. I hope it

00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:18.940
never faded away. But I would say this morning, as we would be honest one with

00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:23.700
another, that there are times in our lives when the joy seems to slip away. It

00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:28.299
seems to fade, if you will. Maybe we don't have the same joy and excitement to

00:49:28.299 --> 00:49:36.460
share Christ with others as we one day did. Maybe it's just kind of gotten just

00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:42.460
normal, just regular, just I'm a Christian, I'm saved, I'm going to heaven. And maybe

00:49:42.460 --> 00:49:47.500
we've lost the joy of it all. Do you understand what I'm saying? It's possible in

00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:52.779
life, by the way. It's possible when some think, listen, we see it in life when

00:49:52.779 --> 00:49:58.500
people buy a new car. They're excited about that new car. They wash it, they

00:49:58.500 --> 00:50:01.820
detail it, they whatever.

00:50:01.820 --> 00:50:05.540
And it gets a little ding, they're all tight, right, you understand?

00:50:05.540 --> 00:50:11.020
And then all of a sudden it's just a car that maybe you're still making payments on.

00:50:11.020 --> 00:50:14.340
And that's even worse, you understand what I'm saying?

00:50:14.340 --> 00:50:21.700
But what I'm saying is that don't let it be the case with Jesus that it just kind of gets,

00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:28.060
it's just, yeah, He's my Savior, no, He changed my life.

00:50:28.060 --> 00:50:32.660
I hope this morning that if we were to go out this afternoon and if somebody were to

00:50:32.660 --> 00:50:37.260
give us the opportunity to share with them Christ, that they would see in us the level

00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:41.940
of joy and excitement that would be at the same level as it was the first day we met

00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:42.940
Him.

00:50:42.940 --> 00:50:43.940
Why?

00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:48.980
Because we understand every day afresh what He's done for us and how He's changed our

00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:50.340
lives.

00:50:50.340 --> 00:50:56.900
And that we would not get into the monotony of life and just lose the freshness and the

00:50:56.900 --> 00:50:58.540
excitement of it.

00:50:58.540 --> 00:51:04.060
Let it not fade away, but help us each day of our lives to be mindful of what Christ

00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:07.580
did for us and who He is to us.

00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:14.100
The last couple of Wednesday evenings I've been teaching a lesson, Jesus is all the world

00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:15.100
to me.

00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:20.460
We sing the song, in our songbook it's number 100.

00:51:20.460 --> 00:51:26.260
Peter said, to them that believe He is precious, and He is precious.

00:51:26.620 --> 00:51:31.700
The songwriter said, He's a wonderful Savior to me, and He is.

00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:36.700
And as we've taught those lessons over the last couple of weeks and given a sampling

00:51:36.700 --> 00:51:42.140
of answers as to why Jesus is all the world to you, if someone came to you and said, you

00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:47.380
sang that song, you said that Jesus is all the world, why is He all the world to you?

00:51:47.380 --> 00:51:51.620
I hope that we'd be able to communicate it with joy and excitement, and that they would

00:51:51.620 --> 00:51:59.700
see the passion and the genuine aspect of what He did for me.

00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:03.020
This, listen, this is not religion.

00:52:03.020 --> 00:52:04.660
Religion's dead.

00:52:04.660 --> 00:52:07.900
It's dead orthodoxy, honestly.

00:52:07.900 --> 00:52:14.300
But I'm talking about a relationship with the God of heaven.

00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:18.260
These shepherds, their lives were changed.

00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:23.020
And on the day that you met the Lord Jesus Christ, the day in which you got saved, your

00:52:23.020 --> 00:52:24.940
life was changed.

00:52:24.940 --> 00:52:27.220
My life was changed.

00:52:27.220 --> 00:52:31.620
As I look at these shepherds, oh, I'm thankful for the good tidings of great joy.

00:52:31.620 --> 00:52:37.380
I'm thankful for the record of Christ's birth, that it's settled historically.

00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:43.060
He was born, but He was born to die.

00:52:43.060 --> 00:52:48.260
There are many today that would acknowledge, that would recognize the coming of Christ,

00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:49.260
that He was born.

00:52:49.260 --> 00:52:51.180
But they do not know why.

00:52:51.180 --> 00:52:56.260
They have no concept as to why Christ was born.

00:52:56.260 --> 00:53:01.460
And we have been given the truth of the Word of God, not only with regard to the record

00:53:01.460 --> 00:53:05.340
of His coming, but with regard to the purpose of His coming.

00:53:05.340 --> 00:53:12.960
And as I examine the lives of these shepherds, I pray that God would help me to be faithful.

00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:15.880
I pray that God would help me to be attentive.

00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:18.740
I pray that God would help me to be obedient.

00:53:18.740 --> 00:53:21.920
And I know that I'm changed.

00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:27.240
And I hope this morning, my prayer for you this morning is in like manner, that God would

00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:32.920
challenge us through the reading of this, tracing the steps of these shepherds just

00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:36.560
for a little while in Luke 2, verses 8 through 20.

00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:37.560
Let's pray together.

00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:42.580
Father, thank You so much for the record of Your Word.

00:53:42.580 --> 00:53:57.100
And thank You for the privilege of being able to gather together to sing, to worship,

00:53:57.100 --> 00:53:58.740
to open Your Word.

00:53:58.740 --> 00:54:05.420
God, I pray that the Holy Spirit of God has taken the Word of God this morning and ministered

00:54:05.420 --> 00:54:12.140
to each individual as only He can.

00:54:12.140 --> 00:54:21.380
God that somehow in our lives, we could take a few moments and relate to these shepherds.

00:54:21.380 --> 00:54:29.660
God help us to have the excitement as we go into a lost and dying world and proclaim the

00:54:29.660 --> 00:54:33.059
truth of Thy Word.

00:54:33.059 --> 00:54:36.500
These good tidings of great joy which were given to these shepherds, it was intended

00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:39.500
to go to all people.

00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:44.660
We think about the gospel and we make the link and application for us this morning.

00:54:44.660 --> 00:54:51.140
We've been told to go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature.

00:54:51.140 --> 00:54:58.820
I pray that the evidence of a changed, transformed life would have a powerful impact upon those

00:54:58.820 --> 00:55:02.300
that we would share this truth with.

00:55:02.300 --> 00:55:05.940
Would You have Your will and way in these next few moments?

00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:06.940
We'll thank You for it.

00:55:06.940 --> 00:55:07.940
In Christ's name we pray.

00:55:07.940 --> 00:55:09.980
Father, would You stand with me?

00:55:09.980 --> 00:55:12.020
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano as she does.

00:55:12.020 --> 00:55:13.500
The altar's open.

00:55:13.500 --> 00:55:15.119
You're free to make Your pew and altar.

00:55:15.119 --> 00:55:18.740
You're free to come up here to this old-fashioned altar.

00:55:18.740 --> 00:55:22.100
But would You let God have His way in your life?

00:55:22.100 --> 00:55:26.260
As we relate to the shepherds this morning, I pray that God would use His Word to change

00:55:26.260 --> 00:55:28.500
us as Kimberly plays.
