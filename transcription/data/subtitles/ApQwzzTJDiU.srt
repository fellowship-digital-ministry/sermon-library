1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,920
number three, and last week we finished up 1 Thessalonians 5, and as I told you at the

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:12,600
very beginning of this sermon series here on Wednesday evenings, that we would go through

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:18,440
the latter portion of 1 Thessalonians 5, and then skip over to 2 Thessalonians chapter

4
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,719
number three.

5
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:26,440
In both of these passages we find that there's concise instruction that is provided that

6
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:32,840
is worthy of our review and study, and of course, as you know, we've titled the series

7
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,479
here on Wednesday evening, Walk Worthy, Please God.

8
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:41,799
And this second letter to the believers in Thessalonica is written, it's really written

9
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:44,520
shortly after the first letter.

10
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,720
There's not a lot of time that lapses between the writing of the two letters.

11
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:53,040
I do want you to know, if you look at 2 Thessalonians chapter two, I know that you, I mentioned

12
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,680
already that it will be in chapter three, but look in chapter two, if you will, in

13
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,279
verse number one, because God gives us some insight with regard to the reason of this

14
00:01:01,279 --> 00:01:05,639
letter being written as quickly after the first letter was written as it is.

15
00:01:05,639 --> 00:01:11,599
It says this in verse number one, Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus

16
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:15,480
Christ and by our gathering together unto Him.

17
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:22,279
Notice what he says, that ye be not soon shaken in mind or be troubled neither by spirit nor

18
00:01:22,279 --> 00:01:30,919
by word nor by letter as from us, as that that day of Christ, as that the day of Christ

19
00:01:30,919 --> 00:01:32,440
is at hand.

20
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,599
Let no man deceive you by any means.

21
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:37,760
For that day, what day?

22
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:44,839
The day of Christ, that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and

23
00:01:44,839 --> 00:01:50,000
that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition.

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,440
So as we look at these first three verses of 2 Thessalonians chapter two, we understand

25
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:59,959
that there are some false teachers that were seeking to confuse and influence the believers

26
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:01,599
in Thessalonica.

27
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:07,680
It's interesting the means by which false teachers take and here specifically God gives

28
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:14,600
us insight in verse number two that Paul says this nor by letter as from us.

29
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:19,960
That's quite interesting because basically what we understand to be taking place is someone,

30
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:24,839
these false teachers, either an individual or a group, they sent a letter to the church

31
00:02:24,839 --> 00:02:31,720
at Thessalonica indicating that it was from Paul and giving teaching instruction that

32
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:39,160
was contrary to what Paul had previously given which caused for a great level of confusion.

33
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:44,720
And we find that the apostle Paul of course, God knowing all things, all scripture being

34
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,759
given by inspiration of God, we find that this second letter is sent and it's sent

35
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:51,880
for really a variety of reasons.

36
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,119
Number one, it would provide comfort.

37
00:02:54,119 --> 00:02:59,119
We find that it would provide correction and it would provide instruction and we see all

38
00:02:59,119 --> 00:03:04,880
three of those elements at work in 2 Thessalonians, just three chapters, and as you study through

39
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:11,639
the chapters you find that the apostle Paul is comforting, correcting, and instructing.

40
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:16,020
And all of those things are necessary by the way of the spiritual leader.

41
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:20,000
He says, let no man deceive you by any means in verse number three.

42
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,720
And we understand even as I preached on Sunday morning that there are those that lie in wait

43
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,559
to deceive and their cunning craftiness and all that they do.

44
00:03:29,559 --> 00:03:33,960
And we find that the apostle Paul is seeking under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of

45
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:39,919
God to provide the believers in Thessalonica some instruction and some correction and some

46
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:40,960
comfort.

47
00:03:41,279 --> 00:03:46,080
The closing section of the letter, the third chapter beginning in verse number six is similar

48
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:52,479
to the first letter in that the words that are provided, these words of instruction again,

49
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:56,839
are these concise statements that God gives to the church.

50
00:03:56,839 --> 00:04:00,240
Now, they're not as concise as they were in the first book.

51
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:07,399
In 1 Thessalonians chapter five, you look at that text of scripture and in some of them,

52
00:04:07,399 --> 00:04:12,320
verse 14, for instance, there were four pieces of instruction in one verse.

53
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:17,200
And you find in rejoice evermore, pray without ceasing and everything give thanks for this

54
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,559
is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you, despise not prophesies.

55
00:04:20,559 --> 00:04:22,679
I mean, it's just bam, bam, bam.

56
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:29,000
It's not quite as concise in the second letter, but we find that the instruction is given.

57
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,079
And obviously there's already been a first letter provided.

58
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:38,559
We've already studied that and that helps us understand some of what is now being written

59
00:04:38,559 --> 00:04:39,799
the second time.

60
00:04:39,799 --> 00:04:43,440
Now, as you consider verses seven through nine of our text this evening, you'll see

61
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,440
two truths.

62
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,839
We're going to look at verses six through 10, but let me just, by way of introduction,

63
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:55,320
read to you verses seven through nine and deal with two truths that God reveals to us.

64
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:02,000
Notice in verse number seven, Paul says this, for yourselves know how ye ought to follow

65
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:10,399
us, for we behave not ourselves disorderly among you, neither did we eat any man's bread

66
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:16,359
for naught, but wrought with labor and travail night and day that we might not be chargeable

67
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:18,420
to any of you.

68
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:25,679
Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an example unto you to follow this

69
00:05:25,679 --> 00:05:27,480
or follow us.

70
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,760
So we find that there are two truths that are revealed to us in these few verses of

71
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,040
Scripture.

72
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:38,299
Number one is this, the believers at Thessalonica had been previously instructed.

73
00:05:38,299 --> 00:05:44,440
He says for yourselves know how you ought to follow us, and we go back and you can understand

74
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:50,679
in the first letter how that Paul references back to the time that he was in Thessalonica

75
00:05:50,679 --> 00:05:56,920
ministering, but also in the content of the first letter of the first Thessalonians, the

76
00:05:57,079 --> 00:06:04,179
first letter to the church, we find that the instruction is provided, the truth is given.

77
00:06:04,179 --> 00:06:09,440
We find also in these verses of Scripture, not only had they been given truth and provided

78
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,380
with instruction, but the believers had an example to follow.

79
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:20,399
The apostle Paul says for we behave not ourselves in verse number seven disorderly among you.

80
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:26,519
He goes on to describe their behavior, their manner of living while they were there in

81
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:30,799
Thessalonica, and he says that it was to set forth an example.

82
00:06:30,799 --> 00:06:36,640
Notice in verse number nine, but to make ourselves an example unto you to follow us.

83
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:43,600
And so it's interesting to me, and I appreciate the way that God works and how God ministers

84
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,940
to his people.

85
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:50,700
He provides instruction, but then he also gives an example.

86
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:55,880
Some of us are able to learn very well just by reading something, others of us need to

87
00:06:56,239 --> 00:06:57,320
see it done, right?

88
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:01,519
There's different ways of learning, and we're not going to deal with that extensively this

89
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:06,359
evening, but I love the fact that God gives not only the instruction, but the apostle

90
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:09,440
Paul says we were an example to you as well.

91
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:15,200
And so as we look at this text of Scripture, the statement in verse number seven where

92
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:22,179
he says that we behave not ourselves disorderly among you, gives us some insight with regard

93
00:07:22,339 --> 00:07:28,579
to the subject matter that Paul is going to address in this text of Scripture, and that

94
00:07:28,579 --> 00:07:31,940
is this, those that were walking disorderly.

95
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:36,779
I've titled the message this evening, Disorderly Behavior.

96
00:07:36,779 --> 00:07:40,420
Disorderly Behavior, 2 Thessalonians 3 verses 6 through 10.

97
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:44,700
As we look at the portion of Scripture, the Bible says in verse number six, now we command

98
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,700
you.

99
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:49,859
Again, as we look at the first letter, we find that God would give this instruction,

100
00:07:49,859 --> 00:07:56,260
he says we beseech you in verse 12 of chapter 5, we exhort you in verse 14 of chapter 5,

101
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,859
I charge you in verse 27.

102
00:07:58,859 --> 00:08:04,500
And so we come to the third chapter, in verse number six, Paul says now we command you.

103
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,019
Now I like the language because it's not simply a suggestion.

104
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:14,059
You ever give someone a suggestion, expecting that they're going to receive it as a command?

105
00:08:14,059 --> 00:08:15,820
But it was a suggestion.

106
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:21,500
So you thought that when you suggested something, that it meant that they were going to do that

107
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,500
thing.

108
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:27,420
But it was just a suggestion, so they said, nah, I don't think I want to do that.

109
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:32,260
And the reality is that here, Paul is not making a suggestion, God's not making a suggestion,

110
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,460
he says now we command you.

111
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:42,179
And I like the clarity of the statement, I like the fact that there's no ambiguity, it's

112
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:43,179
clear.

113
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,260
So we command you what?

114
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:50,979
Now we command you brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves

115
00:08:50,979 --> 00:09:01,099
from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received

116
00:09:01,099 --> 00:09:02,340
of us.

117
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:05,979
We read verses seven through nine, I'll read them again, for yourselves know how you ought

118
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:10,580
to follow us, for we behave not ourselves disorderly among you, neither did we eat any

119
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:14,580
man's bread for naught, but wrought with labor and travail night and day, that we might

120
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,820
not be chargeable to any of you.

121
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:22,099
Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an example unto you to follow us.

122
00:09:22,099 --> 00:09:29,260
Now verse 10 says this, for even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any

123
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:33,859
should not work, neither should he eat.

124
00:09:33,859 --> 00:09:38,020
And so we look at this text of Scripture and we find that Paul is addressing those that

125
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:44,659
are walking disorderly, disorderly behavior is the content, the subject matter in verses

126
00:09:44,659 --> 00:09:46,099
six through 10.

127
00:09:46,099 --> 00:09:50,299
If you're taking notes, number one, identify disorderly behavior.

128
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:53,460
We need to learn how to identify disorderly behavior.

129
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:58,900
And it's important that as we look here at this text of Scripture, you notice in verse

130
00:09:58,900 --> 00:09:59,940
number six that there

131
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:04,980
were some within the church that were walking disorderly. It was not something

132
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:10,380
where the Apostle Paul was saying it may be at some point in your future that no

133
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:13,900
there were some that were walking disorderly and we see that in verse

134
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,860
number six it says that you withdraw yourselves from every brother that

135
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:21,740
walketh disorderly and so we find that we understand that of the church in

136
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:27,220
Thessalonica again a model church a good church but there were some that were

137
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:33,660
walking disorderly and so we find that we must be able to identify disorderly

138
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:39,900
behavior and Paul gives us some insight here there's at least one example in the

139
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:45,020
text of scripture that is provided to us with regard to the disorderly behavior

140
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:49,380
that is the subject by which the church in Thessalonica is dealing with in verse

141
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:56,340
number 10 the the disorderly behavior is a failure to work and notice he says for

142
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:59,860
even when we were with you this we commanded you so it was something that

143
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:06,180
had been previously commanded that if any would not work neither should he eat

144
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:15,700
now no work no food I know that's not popular today man and the reality is

145
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:20,020
that he's not referring to people that cannot work he's referring to people

146
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:25,100
that will not work all right there's a difference between those who cannot

147
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:30,139
legitimately they cannot work and those who just simply will not work there's a

148
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:36,100
difference and here what God is dealing with is those that will not work they

149
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:40,980
have the ability to work but they will not work and God says that listen if

150
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:46,540
they don't work there's no food and so the disorderly behavior has to be

151
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:51,980
identified now as we look at this text of scripture and we understand the

152
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:56,340
importance of identifying disorderly behavior we know that not only does it

153
00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:00,300
need to be identified but number two it needs to be corrected it needs to be

154
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:06,660
corrected now it's interesting the word disorderly in verse 6 and then again in

155
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:12,660
verse number 7 of 2nd Thessalonians 3 this word is given to us and this word

156
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:18,979
is is derived from the same Greek word that is translated unruly in the first

157
00:12:18,979 --> 00:12:23,820
letter and so in the first letter in 1st Thessalonians 5 in verse number 14

158
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:31,220
the Bible says this now we exhort you brethren warn them that are unruly I'm

159
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:34,220
not gonna read the rest of the verse because it's that phrase that is

160
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,820
pertinent to our subject matter this evening and he says warn them that are

161
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:42,300
unruly I taught on that a number of weeks ago and we find that here when he

162
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:47,860
speaks about those that are disorderly it's not the same word but it's derived

163
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:52,740
from the word that is translated unruly and so we understand there's a a

164
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:57,460
connection between unruly and disorderly almost being used synonymously if you

165
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:02,860
will and we find that here in chapter number 5 of the previous letter now

166
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:06,580
remember there's not a lot of time that passes between the writing of 1st

167
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:10,860
Thessalonians and the writing of 2nd Thessalonians and it seems as if when

168
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:16,220
you think about this correcting the the disorderly behavior there are at least

169
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:22,660
two possibilities at play here number one the believers in Thessalonica were

170
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:28,740
not warning the unruly or the disorderly they weren't warning them now I tend to

171
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:32,860
think that's not what was going on I tend to believe that what happened

172
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:38,300
because Paul had mentioned how that he believed that they would do what he

173
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:43,619
commanded them I believe really what was happening is that the unruly and the

174
00:13:43,619 --> 00:13:51,339
disorderly were not heeding the warning you know you can give a warning but you

175
00:13:51,339 --> 00:13:59,100
can't make the person heed it amen I told a story years ago and I think I've

176
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:03,020
told it twice from the pulpit there was a pastor and his wife leaving a church

177
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:05,900
in the south and they were leaving on a Sunday morning they were trying to

178
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:09,500
hustle to get somewhere for lunch or whatever they were doing and they came

179
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:13,900
to a railroad crossing the lights were flashing the bars were down and he said

180
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,739
I can make it he goes to try to go around the bars hit by a train both of

181
00:14:17,739 --> 00:14:23,580
them killed whose fault is it it's his fault the warning was there he just

182
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:28,260
didn't heed the warning right we've all been in circumstances and situations

183
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:32,500
where we have experienced times in our own lives where we did not heed the

184
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:37,559
warning or like man they warned me about that or that whatever there was a label

185
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:41,839
that warned about the potential of this happening and I didn't heed the warning

186
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,720
and now this is the consequence the result so I believe that really what's

187
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:52,040
happening here in Thessalonica was that the warnings were provided but they

188
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:57,760
simply weren't heeding the warning now we're gonna think about what's going on

189
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:03,440
and understand the context and obviously the the reason that Paul is writing to

190
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:08,320
these believers a second time so quickly those false teachers that were

191
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:13,799
seeking to confuse and to influence the believers here's what was happening we

192
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:18,440
saw in chapter 2 in verse number 2 they were telling him that the day of Christ

193
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:22,839
was at hand so here's what was happening as people were saying well we don't need

194
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:29,000
to work then we don't need to work and I remember I can't remember the year I

195
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,679
know that Harold Camping said 88 reasons that Christ has come back in

196
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:37,480
1988 and that didn't happen and so he had to write something else and I don't

197
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:42,119
know Harold Camping made all kinds of declarations with naming years he never

198
00:15:42,119 --> 00:15:47,640
read the part where it says no man know at the hour and anyhow he's he's no

199
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:53,519
longer alive but but he I think it was somewhere early in the 2000s he made

200
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,959
another huge declaration and there were people selling all of their goods there

201
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:01,640
are people quitting their jobs and they were doing all this stuff to go on the

202
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:07,160
road and and try to announce that Jesus is coming on this particular day and he

203
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:11,959
didn't and they didn't have anything and they didn't have a job and it was Harold

204
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:15,959
Camping didn't take care of him he didn't pay for all their expenses and it

205
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:20,959
was a real problem so what was happening here is because of this false teaching

206
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,720
it was influencing some people say well then we don't there's no need for us to

207
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:30,440
work no the principles that you you work you provide for your own you work

208
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:36,720
so that you could have and if you don't work you don't eat and so we find that

209
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,399
when we consider the text of Scripture and we couple it with what we've just

210
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:45,399
studied in 1st Thessalonians chapter number 5 that just because we're able to

211
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:50,720
identify disorderly behavior and even if we do our part to correct disorderly

212
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:57,040
behavior it doesn't mean that the the guilty party is going to respond

213
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:02,959
favorably right we agree with that and so we find that what's happening here is

214
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:09,880
the Apostle Paul is now going to provide us with the the next step and so if

215
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:15,480
you're taking notes number three separate from disorderly brethren now I

216
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:21,839
understand that that this is not easy nor is it typically desired but we find

217
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:25,600
that here in the text of Scripture Paul makes it extremely clear in verse number

218
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:32,279
six notice he says now we command you we made point of that earlier but he says

219
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:38,760
we command you brethren notice in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that ye

220
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:46,279
withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly and not after

221
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:53,640
the tradition which he received of us now later on in the text in a future

222
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:59,080
lesson we're gonna find that there's another truth of admonition that is

223
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:03,480
given to have no company with someone but that's someone who actually has some

224
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:09,959
doctrinal differences with regard to he says in verse 14 if any man obey not our

225
00:18:09,959 --> 00:18:15,440
word by this epistle note that man and have no company with him that he may be

226
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,480
ashamed we don't count him as an enemy according to verse 15 but admonish him

227
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:25,559
as a brother but the reality is that their separation here in verses six

228
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:31,519
through ten he's talking about these that have are guilty of being unruly or

229
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:37,359
disorderly in their behavior and Paul says that were to withdraw ourselves the

230
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:41,599
the word literally means to remove yourself it literally means to depart

231
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:46,679
from now understand with me this evening again that this is not easy nor is it

232
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:52,960
often desired but the instruction is clear and this is not a circumstance or

233
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,919
a situation where someone is disorderly on one occasion and we immediately say

234
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:03,760
I can't have any no they were warned they were corrected there was a measure

235
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:09,320
of time and by the way let me say this oftentimes if we're not careful when we

236
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:14,400
think about the circumstances in life we enjoy it greatly when individuals and

237
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:20,039
especially when God is long-suffering toward us but when others and God are

238
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:24,400
long-suffering towards others sometimes we don't have patience for that does

239
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,119
that make sense what I just said so I like it when God is long-suffering with

240
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:33,080
me I like it when people are long-suffering with me you ever interact

241
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,320
with somebody that has no patience with you and you're trying to work through

242
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:39,359
something so listen can you just be patient like I'm trying to and they're

243
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:43,559
just they don't want to hear it they're just and we we like when people are

244
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:49,080
long-suffering and patient with us but if we see somebody if we think that

245
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:53,679
there's somebody that's walking disorderly and we don't know all of the

246
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:58,200
the steps that have been taken sometimes we might come to the place of

247
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,799
why isn't that dealt with yet

248
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:06,959
Well, maybe you don't know how it's being dealt with, and the manner by which it's being

249
00:20:06,959 --> 00:20:12,339
dealt with, and the fact that there's a measure of longsuffering, that if you were in the

250
00:20:12,339 --> 00:20:17,679
circumstance and the situation, you would appreciate the longsuffering.

251
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:22,179
And so we find that this is not just immediate first offense, bam, you're done.

252
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:28,139
It's a situation where this is a behavior that has developed, and the warning has been

253
00:20:28,139 --> 00:20:31,459
given, but there's no heeding the warning.

254
00:20:31,459 --> 00:20:33,279
So what's the step?

255
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:34,279
Withdrawal.

256
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:35,279
Separate.

257
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:45,279
Now, remember, those behaving disorderly will influence others.

258
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:47,719
Amen?

259
00:20:47,719 --> 00:20:52,399
We've all at some point in our lives heard someone, and maybe we were the ones speaking

260
00:20:52,399 --> 00:20:55,239
the words about the bad apple.

261
00:20:55,239 --> 00:21:00,919
The bad apple doesn't make the, it's going to make the good apples bad if you keep it

262
00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:01,919
together.

263
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:04,799
The good apples, I don't care how many good apples you put in there, they're never going

264
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,159
to make the bad apple good.

265
00:21:07,159 --> 00:21:08,159
We've used that.

266
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,159
We've heard it.

267
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:18,459
But we find that biblically, God reveals to us the truth of influence, and those that

268
00:21:18,459 --> 00:21:25,679
are walking disorderly will have an influence on the body, on the church.

269
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:34,279
And therefore, we find that this command is given, that Paul is, I mean, he is clear.

270
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:36,679
There's no confusion.

271
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:39,239
He's making it extremely clear.

272
00:21:39,239 --> 00:21:41,359
God is providing us with this instruction.

273
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:44,759
Now look back, if you will, at 1 Corinthians chapter 15.

274
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:50,199
1 Corinthians chapter 15, see, the truth is not just something that your mom or grandma

275
00:21:50,199 --> 00:21:51,999
told you about the apple.

276
00:21:51,999 --> 00:21:54,199
It's a biblical foundation.

277
00:21:54,199 --> 00:22:00,119
It's a truth that God has given us in His Word with regard to relationships and with

278
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:03,559
regard to influence.

279
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:12,399
In 1 Corinthians 15, in verse number 33, it says this, be not deceived.

280
00:22:12,399 --> 00:22:17,559
Now anytime a verse starts with those words, you ought to pay close attention.

281
00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:18,719
Why?

282
00:22:18,719 --> 00:22:23,819
Because the enemy is a liar.

283
00:22:23,939 --> 00:22:25,939
He is a deceiver.

284
00:22:25,939 --> 00:22:27,659
Amen?

285
00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:30,939
And so here, God says, be not deceived.

286
00:22:30,939 --> 00:22:32,259
What is it?

287
00:22:32,259 --> 00:22:40,059
Evil communications corrupt good manners.

288
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:42,959
How many of you, I don't want you to raise your hand, but just answer it yourself if

289
00:22:42,959 --> 00:22:44,539
you have children.

290
00:22:44,539 --> 00:22:49,659
How many of you that had children wanted your children to have good friends?

291
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:51,539
Everybody.

292
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:54,539
You don't want your kids running around with the bad kids.

293
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:59,539
You don't want your kids being associated with, no, you want your, you're concerned

294
00:22:59,539 --> 00:23:04,259
about the company that your kids keep.

295
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:10,459
Does that just automatically stop when we turn 18 or 21 or 52 or 89 or whatever that,

296
00:23:10,459 --> 00:23:13,819
no, evil communications corrupt good manners.

297
00:23:13,819 --> 00:23:16,379
It is a biblical truth.

298
00:23:16,379 --> 00:23:20,579
In 1 Corinthians 5, in verse number 6, the Bible says a little leaven, leaveneth the

299
00:23:20,579 --> 00:23:23,759
whole lump.

300
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:29,419
The doctor tells you, and I don't say this lightly, so please understand, I understand

301
00:23:29,419 --> 00:23:36,019
the severity of it, but if the doctor were to tell you that you have cancer, well, just

302
00:23:36,019 --> 00:23:37,019
leave it.

303
00:23:37,019 --> 00:23:40,179
We're not going to do any, no, we want to get rid of it.

304
00:23:40,179 --> 00:23:41,299
Why?

305
00:23:41,299 --> 00:23:44,779
Because that cancer is going to spread.

306
00:23:44,779 --> 00:23:46,899
And so we want to get rid of it.

307
00:23:46,899 --> 00:23:53,979
And so we find that the biblical truths that are provided to us in 1 Corinthians 5, 1 Corinthians

308
00:23:53,979 --> 00:24:01,539
15 help us to understand that those that are behaving disorderly will have an influence

309
00:24:01,539 --> 00:24:03,499
on the church.

310
00:24:03,499 --> 00:24:09,339
They will have an influence on brothers and sisters in Christ, and so therefore Paul,

311
00:24:09,339 --> 00:24:14,499
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God, he says, listen, not only are we to identify

312
00:24:14,499 --> 00:24:22,979
disorderly behavior, we are to correct disorderly behavior, and depending on the response of

313
00:24:22,979 --> 00:24:30,699
the individual, then ultimately, if there's no positive response to the correction, to

314
00:24:30,699 --> 00:24:38,139
the warning that's provided, the next step is to separate from, to withdraw yourselves.

315
00:24:38,459 --> 00:24:48,459
Again, I'm not suggesting this evening that this is an easy step or a desired step.

316
00:24:48,459 --> 00:24:53,859
I understand relationships, and I understand that there are times in which we'll say, well,

317
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:59,579
we can just set aside those differences, we can just set aside these things, and we have

318
00:24:59,579 --> 00:25:04,539
to understand within the context of the church and hear what's taking place in the church

319
00:25:04,579 --> 00:25:08,899
in Thessalonica, that Paul speaks expressly under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of

320
00:25:08,899 --> 00:25:11,539
God of how to deal with these matters.

321
00:25:11,539 --> 00:25:15,699
I want you to turn to Colossians, and we'll be done this evening, we'll have our prayer

322
00:25:15,699 --> 00:25:20,699
time, but turn to the book of Colossians, if you will, in the first chapter.

323
00:25:20,699 --> 00:25:29,539
In Colossians chapter number 1, the end of the chapter, the Apostle Paul provides really,

324
00:25:29,539 --> 00:25:35,220
if you will, a philosophy of ministry and just his approach to ministry.

325
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:42,699
And he says this in verse 28, verse 27 talks about, with Christ in you, the hope of glory.

326
00:25:42,699 --> 00:25:47,579
He says, whom we preach, I just referenced the latter part of verse 27, because he begins

327
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:49,819
verse 28 by saying, whom we preach.

328
00:25:49,819 --> 00:25:53,919
We preach Christ, amen, 1 Corinthians.

329
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,979
We preach Christ, Christ crucified, Christ alone.

330
00:25:57,979 --> 00:26:02,899
He died for us, he was buried and he rose again, and we preach Christ.

331
00:26:02,899 --> 00:26:11,859
And Paul says, whom we preach, and then notice this, warning every man, and teaching every

332
00:26:11,859 --> 00:26:14,579
man in all wisdom.

333
00:26:14,579 --> 00:26:20,739
So we find that there's a preaching, a warning, and a teaching.

334
00:26:20,739 --> 00:26:26,019
And so sometimes what happens when there's someone that's disorderly, you warn them,

335
00:26:26,019 --> 00:26:27,500
but then what do you need to do?

336
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:34,440
You don't just stop with a warning, you then have to teach them what is appropriate.

337
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:39,019
We find, and we'll mention this again as we go further into 2 Thessalonians chapter 3,

338
00:26:39,019 --> 00:26:44,779
when he's dealing with the more doctrinal issue at the end of the text, the reality

339
00:26:44,779 --> 00:26:53,500
is that there's some people that can be led astray, you warn them and then you teach them.

340
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:56,299
Sometimes people don't want a warning.

341
00:26:56,299 --> 00:26:57,979
Sometimes people don't want to be taught.

342
00:26:57,979 --> 00:27:00,679
It's just the way it is.

343
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:04,979
It's a hard thing that you have to acknowledge.

344
00:27:04,979 --> 00:27:09,379
I remember Jason Caldwell making a statement when he was here preaching one time.

345
00:27:09,379 --> 00:27:13,779
He said, it breaks my heart that there are people that do not know the truth.

346
00:27:13,779 --> 00:27:14,779
I agree.

347
00:27:14,779 --> 00:27:20,019
He said, but what breaks my heart more than that is there are people who do not want to

348
00:27:20,019 --> 00:27:21,019
know the truth.

349
00:27:21,019 --> 00:27:22,019
Wow.

350
00:27:22,019 --> 00:27:26,139
There are people that just don't want the warning.

351
00:27:26,139 --> 00:27:28,220
There are people that just don't want the teaching.

352
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:33,619
But I want you to notice why Paul says we preach Christ, we preach Him whom we preach,

353
00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:36,979
warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, why?

354
00:27:36,979 --> 00:27:42,459
That we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus.

355
00:27:42,459 --> 00:27:44,699
Word perfect is complete.

356
00:27:44,699 --> 00:27:47,019
To be complete in Christ.

357
00:27:47,019 --> 00:27:51,899
See Paul understood that one day every believer would stand before Christ.

358
00:27:51,899 --> 00:27:53,379
Every man must appear before Christ.

359
00:27:53,379 --> 00:27:57,059
If you're saved by the grace of God, you will stand before Christ.

360
00:27:57,059 --> 00:28:01,679
And so why is Paul preaching and warning and teaching?

361
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:06,339
So that when that day comes, you will be prepared for it.

362
00:28:06,339 --> 00:28:08,659
Now will any of us ever be fully prepared?

363
00:28:08,659 --> 00:28:09,659
I think not.

364
00:28:09,659 --> 00:28:12,139
It's a fearful thing.

365
00:28:12,139 --> 00:28:22,099
It ought to cause us to seriously inspect self-examination and we'll stand before Christ

366
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,220
one day.

367
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:28,500
But Paul says that this is why we do what we do.

368
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:35,179
Where unto, verse 29, I also labor, striving according to His working which worketh in

369
00:28:35,179 --> 00:28:36,179
me mightily.

370
00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:40,859
I'm so thankful that God works in us and through us to accomplish His purpose, but you understand

371
00:28:40,859 --> 00:28:42,459
that it's still labor.

372
00:28:42,459 --> 00:28:48,779
He uses that word labor, he uses the word striving, that it communicates to us the labor

373
00:28:48,779 --> 00:28:49,779
that's involved.

374
00:28:49,779 --> 00:28:54,659
Now I want you to see in the fourth chapter what it said of Epaphras.

375
00:28:54,659 --> 00:28:59,419
Epaphras, our understanding of the church in Colossae, Paul never was there.

376
00:28:59,419 --> 00:29:03,339
He had no part in starting the church, he had no interaction with the believers in Colossae

377
00:29:03,339 --> 00:29:12,979
save this letter that God inspired and had Paul write to the church that's there in Colossae.

378
00:29:12,979 --> 00:29:17,820
And he writes to them, he hears about their salvation and testimony and about their walk

379
00:29:17,859 --> 00:29:19,899
according to the first chapter from Epaphras.

380
00:29:19,899 --> 00:29:24,059
It's our understanding that he's the pastor of the church.

381
00:29:24,059 --> 00:29:27,479
Notice what it says in verse 12 of Colossians 4 about Epaphras.

382
00:29:27,479 --> 00:29:30,419
He says, who is one of you a servant of Christ, saluteth you.

383
00:29:30,419 --> 00:29:37,940
Notice what it says, always laboring fervently for you in prayers that ye may stand perfect

384
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:42,299
and complete in all the will of God.

385
00:29:42,299 --> 00:29:43,659
Wow.

386
00:29:43,659 --> 00:29:53,940
What a blessing to have some spiritual leaders that have a concern about individual believers.

387
00:29:53,940 --> 00:30:01,779
I'm thankful that in my life I've had some spiritual leaders that cared about me.

388
00:30:01,779 --> 00:30:07,299
I understand there are times in which all of us need to be warned about something.

389
00:30:07,299 --> 00:30:10,019
None of us are perfect.

390
00:30:10,019 --> 00:30:15,899
And we ought to be humble in receiving that warning, and we ought to be responsive.

391
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:23,439
We ought to, if a warning has to be given, that we do follow the process of self-examination

392
00:30:23,439 --> 00:30:29,499
and see the legitimacy of the concern that is brought to us so that we can evaluate our

393
00:30:29,499 --> 00:30:33,019
own behavior and then correct it if it needs to be corrected.

394
00:30:33,019 --> 00:30:36,739
It's important that we take that response.

395
00:30:36,739 --> 00:30:41,659
These believers, unfortunately, that are being spoken of in 2 Thessalonians chapter 3 and

396
00:30:41,659 --> 00:30:48,179
verses 6 through 10, it appears, based upon the direction of the text and the step of

397
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:54,979
separation, withdraw yourselves, that these that were guilty simply weren't hearing the

398
00:30:54,979 --> 00:30:56,939
warning.

399
00:30:56,939 --> 00:30:59,419
They weren't heeding the warning.

400
00:30:59,419 --> 00:31:00,499
Find them that are unruly.

401
00:31:00,499 --> 00:31:03,419
They were told that in 1 Thessalonians 5 verse 14.

402
00:31:03,419 --> 00:31:05,499
I believe they did.

403
00:31:05,499 --> 00:31:10,059
And yet there were some that continued to walk disorderly.

404
00:31:10,059 --> 00:31:14,099
Paul said, no, they've been instructed.

405
00:31:14,099 --> 00:31:17,899
They've been given an example.

406
00:31:17,899 --> 00:31:22,179
And if they still won't heed, then you have to separate from them.

407
00:31:22,179 --> 00:31:27,499
And again, I'm not suggesting this evening that it's an easy thing or even a desired

408
00:31:27,499 --> 00:31:32,459
thing, but we need to be careful that we understand the power of influence.

409
00:31:32,459 --> 00:31:34,899
And he says, be not deceived.

410
00:31:34,899 --> 00:31:39,099
Evil communications will corrupt good manners.

411
00:31:39,099 --> 00:31:40,099
Let's pray together.

412
00:31:40,099 --> 00:31:41,099
Father, we love You.

413
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:42,099
We thank You for loving us.

414
00:31:42,099 --> 00:31:47,499
We thank You for the privilege of knowing You and having Your Word.

415
00:31:47,499 --> 00:31:50,619
We thank You for the truth that's contained therein.

416
00:31:50,619 --> 00:31:54,459
I pray, Lord, that You would help us to walk worthy, to please You.

417
00:31:54,459 --> 00:31:58,859
Lord, help us to walk in obedience to Your Word.

418
00:31:58,859 --> 00:32:00,499
Help us, Lord, as we pray tonight.

419
00:32:00,499 --> 00:32:01,819
We thank You for the privilege.

420
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:07,899
I pray that You would work through this season of corporate prayer that You'd be glorified

421
00:32:07,899 --> 00:32:10,539
and we'll thank You for it in Christ's name we pray.

422
00:32:10,539 --> 00:32:11,539
Amen.

423
00:32:11,539 --> 00:32:13,939
Anyone not get a prayer bulletin when you came in this evening?
