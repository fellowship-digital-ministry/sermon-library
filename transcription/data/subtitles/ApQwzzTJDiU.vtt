WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.920
number three, and last week we finished up 1 Thessalonians 5, and as I told you at the

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:12.600
very beginning of this sermon series here on Wednesday evenings, that we would go through

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:18.440
the latter portion of 1 Thessalonians 5, and then skip over to 2 Thessalonians chapter

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:19.719
number three.

00:00:19.719 --> 00:00:26.440
In both of these passages we find that there's concise instruction that is provided that

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:32.840
is worthy of our review and study, and of course, as you know, we've titled the series

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.479
here on Wednesday evening, Walk Worthy, Please God.

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:41.799
And this second letter to the believers in Thessalonica is written, it's really written

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:44.520
shortly after the first letter.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.720
There's not a lot of time that lapses between the writing of the two letters.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.040
I do want you to know, if you look at 2 Thessalonians chapter two, I know that you, I mentioned

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.680
already that it will be in chapter three, but look in chapter two, if you will, in

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.279
verse number one, because God gives us some insight with regard to the reason of this

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:05.639
letter being written as quickly after the first letter was written as it is.

00:01:05.639 --> 00:01:11.599
It says this in verse number one, Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus

00:01:11.599 --> 00:01:15.480
Christ and by our gathering together unto Him.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:22.279
Notice what he says, that ye be not soon shaken in mind or be troubled neither by spirit nor

00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:30.919
by word nor by letter as from us, as that that day of Christ, as that the day of Christ

00:01:30.919 --> 00:01:32.440
is at hand.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.599
Let no man deceive you by any means.

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:37.760
For that day, what day?

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:44.839
The day of Christ, that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and

00:01:44.839 --> 00:01:50.000
that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.440
So as we look at these first three verses of 2 Thessalonians chapter two, we understand

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.959
that there are some false teachers that were seeking to confuse and influence the believers

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:01.599
in Thessalonica.

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:07.680
It's interesting the means by which false teachers take and here specifically God gives

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:14.600
us insight in verse number two that Paul says this nor by letter as from us.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.960
That's quite interesting because basically what we understand to be taking place is someone,

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.839
these false teachers, either an individual or a group, they sent a letter to the church

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:31.720
at Thessalonica indicating that it was from Paul and giving teaching instruction that

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:39.160
was contrary to what Paul had previously given which caused for a great level of confusion.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.720
And we find that the apostle Paul of course, God knowing all things, all scripture being

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.759
given by inspiration of God, we find that this second letter is sent and it's sent

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:51.880
for really a variety of reasons.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.119
Number one, it would provide comfort.

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:59.119
We find that it would provide correction and it would provide instruction and we see all

00:02:59.119 --> 00:03:04.880
three of those elements at work in 2 Thessalonians, just three chapters, and as you study through

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:11.639
the chapters you find that the apostle Paul is comforting, correcting, and instructing.

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:16.020
And all of those things are necessary by the way of the spiritual leader.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.000
He says, let no man deceive you by any means in verse number three.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.720
And we understand even as I preached on Sunday morning that there are those that lie in wait

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.559
to deceive and their cunning craftiness and all that they do.

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:33.960
And we find that the apostle Paul is seeking under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:39.919
God to provide the believers in Thessalonica some instruction and some correction and some

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:40.960
comfort.

00:03:41.279 --> 00:03:46.080
The closing section of the letter, the third chapter beginning in verse number six is similar

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:52.479
to the first letter in that the words that are provided, these words of instruction again,

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:56.839
are these concise statements that God gives to the church.

00:03:56.839 --> 00:04:00.240
Now, they're not as concise as they were in the first book.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:07.399
In 1 Thessalonians chapter five, you look at that text of scripture and in some of them,

00:04:07.399 --> 00:04:12.320
verse 14, for instance, there were four pieces of instruction in one verse.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:17.200
And you find in rejoice evermore, pray without ceasing and everything give thanks for this

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.559
is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you, despise not prophesies.

00:04:20.559 --> 00:04:22.679
I mean, it's just bam, bam, bam.

00:04:22.679 --> 00:04:29.000
It's not quite as concise in the second letter, but we find that the instruction is given.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.079
And obviously there's already been a first letter provided.

00:04:33.079 --> 00:04:38.559
We've already studied that and that helps us understand some of what is now being written

00:04:38.559 --> 00:04:39.799
the second time.

00:04:39.799 --> 00:04:43.440
Now, as you consider verses seven through nine of our text this evening, you'll see

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.440
two truths.

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.839
We're going to look at verses six through 10, but let me just, by way of introduction,

00:04:48.839 --> 00:04:55.320
read to you verses seven through nine and deal with two truths that God reveals to us.

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:02.000
Notice in verse number seven, Paul says this, for yourselves know how ye ought to follow

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:10.399
us, for we behave not ourselves disorderly among you, neither did we eat any man's bread

00:05:10.399 --> 00:05:16.359
for naught, but wrought with labor and travail night and day that we might not be chargeable

00:05:16.359 --> 00:05:18.420
to any of you.

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:25.679
Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an example unto you to follow this

00:05:25.679 --> 00:05:27.480
or follow us.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.760
So we find that there are two truths that are revealed to us in these few verses of

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.040
Scripture.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:38.299
Number one is this, the believers at Thessalonica had been previously instructed.

00:05:38.299 --> 00:05:44.440
He says for yourselves know how you ought to follow us, and we go back and you can understand

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:50.679
in the first letter how that Paul references back to the time that he was in Thessalonica

00:05:50.679 --> 00:05:56.920
ministering, but also in the content of the first letter of the first Thessalonians, the

00:05:57.079 --> 00:06:04.179
first letter to the church, we find that the instruction is provided, the truth is given.

00:06:04.179 --> 00:06:09.440
We find also in these verses of Scripture, not only had they been given truth and provided

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:14.380
with instruction, but the believers had an example to follow.

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:20.399
The apostle Paul says for we behave not ourselves in verse number seven disorderly among you.

00:06:20.399 --> 00:06:26.519
He goes on to describe their behavior, their manner of living while they were there in

00:06:26.519 --> 00:06:30.799
Thessalonica, and he says that it was to set forth an example.

00:06:30.799 --> 00:06:36.640
Notice in verse number nine, but to make ourselves an example unto you to follow us.

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:43.600
And so it's interesting to me, and I appreciate the way that God works and how God ministers

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:44.940
to his people.

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:50.700
He provides instruction, but then he also gives an example.

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:55.880
Some of us are able to learn very well just by reading something, others of us need to

00:06:56.239 --> 00:06:57.320
see it done, right?

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:01.519
There's different ways of learning, and we're not going to deal with that extensively this

00:07:01.519 --> 00:07:06.359
evening, but I love the fact that God gives not only the instruction, but the apostle

00:07:06.359 --> 00:07:09.440
Paul says we were an example to you as well.

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:15.200
And so as we look at this text of Scripture, the statement in verse number seven where

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:22.179
he says that we behave not ourselves disorderly among you, gives us some insight with regard

00:07:22.339 --> 00:07:28.579
to the subject matter that Paul is going to address in this text of Scripture, and that

00:07:28.579 --> 00:07:31.940
is this, those that were walking disorderly.

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:36.779
I've titled the message this evening, Disorderly Behavior.

00:07:36.779 --> 00:07:40.420
Disorderly Behavior, 2 Thessalonians 3 verses 6 through 10.

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:44.700
As we look at the portion of Scripture, the Bible says in verse number six, now we command

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:45.700
you.

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:49.859
Again, as we look at the first letter, we find that God would give this instruction,

00:07:49.859 --> 00:07:56.260
he says we beseech you in verse 12 of chapter 5, we exhort you in verse 14 of chapter 5,

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.859
I charge you in verse 27.

00:07:58.859 --> 00:08:04.500
And so we come to the third chapter, in verse number six, Paul says now we command you.

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:08.019
Now I like the language because it's not simply a suggestion.

00:08:08.019 --> 00:08:14.059
You ever give someone a suggestion, expecting that they're going to receive it as a command?

00:08:14.059 --> 00:08:15.820
But it was a suggestion.

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:21.500
So you thought that when you suggested something, that it meant that they were going to do that

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:22.500
thing.

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:27.420
But it was just a suggestion, so they said, nah, I don't think I want to do that.

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:32.260
And the reality is that here, Paul is not making a suggestion, God's not making a suggestion,

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.460
he says now we command you.

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:42.179
And I like the clarity of the statement, I like the fact that there's no ambiguity, it's

00:08:42.179 --> 00:08:43.179
clear.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:44.260
So we command you what?

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:50.979
Now we command you brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves

00:08:50.979 --> 00:09:01.099
from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received

00:09:01.099 --> 00:09:02.340
of us.

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:05.979
We read verses seven through nine, I'll read them again, for yourselves know how you ought

00:09:05.979 --> 00:09:10.580
to follow us, for we behave not ourselves disorderly among you, neither did we eat any

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:14.580
man's bread for naught, but wrought with labor and travail night and day, that we might

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:16.820
not be chargeable to any of you.

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:22.099
Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an example unto you to follow us.

00:09:22.099 --> 00:09:29.260
Now verse 10 says this, for even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:33.859
should not work, neither should he eat.

00:09:33.859 --> 00:09:38.020
And so we look at this text of Scripture and we find that Paul is addressing those that

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:44.659
are walking disorderly, disorderly behavior is the content, the subject matter in verses

00:09:44.659 --> 00:09:46.099
six through 10.

00:09:46.099 --> 00:09:50.299
If you're taking notes, number one, identify disorderly behavior.

00:09:50.299 --> 00:09:53.460
We need to learn how to identify disorderly behavior.

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:58.900
And it's important that as we look here at this text of Scripture, you notice in verse

00:09:58.900 --> 00:09:59.940
number six that there

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:04.980
were some within the church that were walking disorderly. It was not something

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:10.380
where the Apostle Paul was saying it may be at some point in your future that no

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:13.900
there were some that were walking disorderly and we see that in verse

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:16.860
number six it says that you withdraw yourselves from every brother that

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:21.740
walketh disorderly and so we find that we understand that of the church in

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:27.220
Thessalonica again a model church a good church but there were some that were

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:33.660
walking disorderly and so we find that we must be able to identify disorderly

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:39.900
behavior and Paul gives us some insight here there's at least one example in the

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:45.020
text of scripture that is provided to us with regard to the disorderly behavior

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:49.380
that is the subject by which the church in Thessalonica is dealing with in verse

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:56.340
number 10 the the disorderly behavior is a failure to work and notice he says for

00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:59.860
even when we were with you this we commanded you so it was something that

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:06.180
had been previously commanded that if any would not work neither should he eat

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:15.700
now no work no food I know that's not popular today man and the reality is

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:20.020
that he's not referring to people that cannot work he's referring to people

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:25.100
that will not work all right there's a difference between those who cannot

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:30.139
legitimately they cannot work and those who just simply will not work there's a

00:11:30.139 --> 00:11:36.100
difference and here what God is dealing with is those that will not work they

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:40.980
have the ability to work but they will not work and God says that listen if

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:46.540
they don't work there's no food and so the disorderly behavior has to be

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:51.980
identified now as we look at this text of scripture and we understand the

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:56.340
importance of identifying disorderly behavior we know that not only does it

00:11:56.340 --> 00:12:00.300
need to be identified but number two it needs to be corrected it needs to be

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:06.660
corrected now it's interesting the word disorderly in verse 6 and then again in

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:12.660
verse number 7 of 2nd Thessalonians 3 this word is given to us and this word

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:18.979
is is derived from the same Greek word that is translated unruly in the first

00:12:18.979 --> 00:12:23.820
letter and so in the first letter in 1st Thessalonians 5 in verse number 14

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:31.220
the Bible says this now we exhort you brethren warn them that are unruly I'm

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:34.220
not gonna read the rest of the verse because it's that phrase that is

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:37.820
pertinent to our subject matter this evening and he says warn them that are

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:42.300
unruly I taught on that a number of weeks ago and we find that here when he

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:47.860
speaks about those that are disorderly it's not the same word but it's derived

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:52.740
from the word that is translated unruly and so we understand there's a a

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:57.460
connection between unruly and disorderly almost being used synonymously if you

00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:02.860
will and we find that here in chapter number 5 of the previous letter now

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:06.580
remember there's not a lot of time that passes between the writing of 1st

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:10.860
Thessalonians and the writing of 2nd Thessalonians and it seems as if when

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:16.220
you think about this correcting the the disorderly behavior there are at least

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:22.660
two possibilities at play here number one the believers in Thessalonica were

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:28.740
not warning the unruly or the disorderly they weren't warning them now I tend to

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:32.860
think that's not what was going on I tend to believe that what happened

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:38.300
because Paul had mentioned how that he believed that they would do what he

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:43.619
commanded them I believe really what was happening is that the unruly and the

00:13:43.619 --> 00:13:51.339
disorderly were not heeding the warning you know you can give a warning but you

00:13:51.339 --> 00:13:59.100
can't make the person heed it amen I told a story years ago and I think I've

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:03.020
told it twice from the pulpit there was a pastor and his wife leaving a church

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:05.900
in the south and they were leaving on a Sunday morning they were trying to

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:09.500
hustle to get somewhere for lunch or whatever they were doing and they came

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:13.900
to a railroad crossing the lights were flashing the bars were down and he said

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:17.739
I can make it he goes to try to go around the bars hit by a train both of

00:14:17.739 --> 00:14:23.580
them killed whose fault is it it's his fault the warning was there he just

00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:28.260
didn't heed the warning right we've all been in circumstances and situations

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:32.500
where we have experienced times in our own lives where we did not heed the

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:37.559
warning or like man they warned me about that or that whatever there was a label

00:14:37.559 --> 00:14:41.839
that warned about the potential of this happening and I didn't heed the warning

00:14:41.839 --> 00:14:46.720
and now this is the consequence the result so I believe that really what's

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:52.040
happening here in Thessalonica was that the warnings were provided but they

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:57.760
simply weren't heeding the warning now we're gonna think about what's going on

00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:03.440
and understand the context and obviously the the reason that Paul is writing to

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:08.320
these believers a second time so quickly those false teachers that were

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:13.799
seeking to confuse and to influence the believers here's what was happening we

00:15:13.799 --> 00:15:18.440
saw in chapter 2 in verse number 2 they were telling him that the day of Christ

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:22.839
was at hand so here's what was happening as people were saying well we don't need

00:15:22.839 --> 00:15:29.000
to work then we don't need to work and I remember I can't remember the year I

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.679
know that Harold Camping said 88 reasons that Christ has come back in

00:15:32.679 --> 00:15:37.480
1988 and that didn't happen and so he had to write something else and I don't

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:42.119
know Harold Camping made all kinds of declarations with naming years he never

00:15:42.119 --> 00:15:47.640
read the part where it says no man know at the hour and anyhow he's he's no

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:53.519
longer alive but but he I think it was somewhere early in the 2000s he made

00:15:53.519 --> 00:15:57.959
another huge declaration and there were people selling all of their goods there

00:15:57.959 --> 00:16:01.640
are people quitting their jobs and they were doing all this stuff to go on the

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:07.160
road and and try to announce that Jesus is coming on this particular day and he

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:11.959
didn't and they didn't have anything and they didn't have a job and it was Harold

00:16:11.959 --> 00:16:15.959
Camping didn't take care of him he didn't pay for all their expenses and it

00:16:15.959 --> 00:16:20.959
was a real problem so what was happening here is because of this false teaching

00:16:20.959 --> 00:16:24.720
it was influencing some people say well then we don't there's no need for us to

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:30.440
work no the principles that you you work you provide for your own you work

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:36.720
so that you could have and if you don't work you don't eat and so we find that

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:41.399
when we consider the text of Scripture and we couple it with what we've just

00:16:41.399 --> 00:16:45.399
studied in 1st Thessalonians chapter number 5 that just because we're able to

00:16:45.399 --> 00:16:50.720
identify disorderly behavior and even if we do our part to correct disorderly

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:57.040
behavior it doesn't mean that the the guilty party is going to respond

00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:02.959
favorably right we agree with that and so we find that what's happening here is

00:17:02.959 --> 00:17:09.880
the Apostle Paul is now going to provide us with the the next step and so if

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:15.480
you're taking notes number three separate from disorderly brethren now I

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:21.839
understand that that this is not easy nor is it typically desired but we find

00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:25.600
that here in the text of Scripture Paul makes it extremely clear in verse number

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:32.279
six notice he says now we command you we made point of that earlier but he says

00:17:32.279 --> 00:17:38.760
we command you brethren notice in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that ye

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:46.279
withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly and not after

00:17:46.279 --> 00:17:53.640
the tradition which he received of us now later on in the text in a future

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:59.080
lesson we're gonna find that there's another truth of admonition that is

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:03.480
given to have no company with someone but that's someone who actually has some

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:09.959
doctrinal differences with regard to he says in verse 14 if any man obey not our

00:18:09.959 --> 00:18:15.440
word by this epistle note that man and have no company with him that he may be

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:19.480
ashamed we don't count him as an enemy according to verse 15 but admonish him

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:25.559
as a brother but the reality is that their separation here in verses six

00:18:25.559 --> 00:18:31.519
through ten he's talking about these that have are guilty of being unruly or

00:18:31.519 --> 00:18:37.359
disorderly in their behavior and Paul says that were to withdraw ourselves the

00:18:37.359 --> 00:18:41.599
the word literally means to remove yourself it literally means to depart

00:18:41.599 --> 00:18:46.679
from now understand with me this evening again that this is not easy nor is it

00:18:46.679 --> 00:18:52.960
often desired but the instruction is clear and this is not a circumstance or

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:57.919
a situation where someone is disorderly on one occasion and we immediately say

00:18:57.919 --> 00:19:03.760
I can't have any no they were warned they were corrected there was a measure

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:09.320
of time and by the way let me say this oftentimes if we're not careful when we

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:14.400
think about the circumstances in life we enjoy it greatly when individuals and

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:20.039
especially when God is long-suffering toward us but when others and God are

00:19:20.039 --> 00:19:24.400
long-suffering towards others sometimes we don't have patience for that does

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:29.119
that make sense what I just said so I like it when God is long-suffering with

00:19:29.119 --> 00:19:33.080
me I like it when people are long-suffering with me you ever interact

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:35.320
with somebody that has no patience with you and you're trying to work through

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:39.359
something so listen can you just be patient like I'm trying to and they're

00:19:39.359 --> 00:19:43.559
just they don't want to hear it they're just and we we like when people are

00:19:43.559 --> 00:19:49.080
long-suffering and patient with us but if we see somebody if we think that

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:53.679
there's somebody that's walking disorderly and we don't know all of the

00:19:53.679 --> 00:19:58.200
the steps that have been taken sometimes we might come to the place of

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:01.799
why isn't that dealt with yet

00:20:01.799 --> 00:20:06.959
Well, maybe you don't know how it's being dealt with, and the manner by which it's being

00:20:06.959 --> 00:20:12.339
dealt with, and the fact that there's a measure of longsuffering, that if you were in the

00:20:12.339 --> 00:20:17.679
circumstance and the situation, you would appreciate the longsuffering.

00:20:17.679 --> 00:20:22.179
And so we find that this is not just immediate first offense, bam, you're done.

00:20:22.179 --> 00:20:28.139
It's a situation where this is a behavior that has developed, and the warning has been

00:20:28.139 --> 00:20:31.459
given, but there's no heeding the warning.

00:20:31.459 --> 00:20:33.279
So what's the step?

00:20:33.279 --> 00:20:34.279
Withdrawal.

00:20:34.279 --> 00:20:35.279
Separate.

00:20:35.279 --> 00:20:45.279
Now, remember, those behaving disorderly will influence others.

00:20:45.279 --> 00:20:47.719
Amen?

00:20:47.719 --> 00:20:52.399
We've all at some point in our lives heard someone, and maybe we were the ones speaking

00:20:52.399 --> 00:20:55.239
the words about the bad apple.

00:20:55.239 --> 00:21:00.919
The bad apple doesn't make the, it's going to make the good apples bad if you keep it

00:21:00.919 --> 00:21:01.919
together.

00:21:01.919 --> 00:21:04.799
The good apples, I don't care how many good apples you put in there, they're never going

00:21:04.799 --> 00:21:07.159
to make the bad apple good.

00:21:07.159 --> 00:21:08.159
We've used that.

00:21:08.159 --> 00:21:10.159
We've heard it.

00:21:10.159 --> 00:21:18.459
But we find that biblically, God reveals to us the truth of influence, and those that

00:21:18.459 --> 00:21:25.679
are walking disorderly will have an influence on the body, on the church.

00:21:25.679 --> 00:21:34.279
And therefore, we find that this command is given, that Paul is, I mean, he is clear.

00:21:34.279 --> 00:21:36.679
There's no confusion.

00:21:36.679 --> 00:21:39.239
He's making it extremely clear.

00:21:39.239 --> 00:21:41.359
God is providing us with this instruction.

00:21:41.359 --> 00:21:44.759
Now look back, if you will, at 1 Corinthians chapter 15.

00:21:44.759 --> 00:21:50.199
1 Corinthians chapter 15, see, the truth is not just something that your mom or grandma

00:21:50.199 --> 00:21:51.999
told you about the apple.

00:21:51.999 --> 00:21:54.199
It's a biblical foundation.

00:21:54.199 --> 00:22:00.119
It's a truth that God has given us in His Word with regard to relationships and with

00:22:00.119 --> 00:22:03.559
regard to influence.

00:22:03.559 --> 00:22:12.399
In 1 Corinthians 15, in verse number 33, it says this, be not deceived.

00:22:12.399 --> 00:22:17.559
Now anytime a verse starts with those words, you ought to pay close attention.

00:22:17.559 --> 00:22:18.719
Why?

00:22:18.719 --> 00:22:23.819
Because the enemy is a liar.

00:22:23.939 --> 00:22:25.939
He is a deceiver.

00:22:25.939 --> 00:22:27.659
Amen?

00:22:27.659 --> 00:22:30.939
And so here, God says, be not deceived.

00:22:30.939 --> 00:22:32.259
What is it?

00:22:32.259 --> 00:22:40.059
Evil communications corrupt good manners.

00:22:40.059 --> 00:22:42.959
How many of you, I don't want you to raise your hand, but just answer it yourself if

00:22:42.959 --> 00:22:44.539
you have children.

00:22:44.539 --> 00:22:49.659
How many of you that had children wanted your children to have good friends?

00:22:49.659 --> 00:22:51.539
Everybody.

00:22:51.539 --> 00:22:54.539
You don't want your kids running around with the bad kids.

00:22:54.539 --> 00:22:59.539
You don't want your kids being associated with, no, you want your, you're concerned

00:22:59.539 --> 00:23:04.259
about the company that your kids keep.

00:23:04.259 --> 00:23:10.459
Does that just automatically stop when we turn 18 or 21 or 52 or 89 or whatever that,

00:23:10.459 --> 00:23:13.819
no, evil communications corrupt good manners.

00:23:13.819 --> 00:23:16.379
It is a biblical truth.

00:23:16.379 --> 00:23:20.579
In 1 Corinthians 5, in verse number 6, the Bible says a little leaven, leaveneth the

00:23:20.579 --> 00:23:23.759
whole lump.

00:23:23.759 --> 00:23:29.419
The doctor tells you, and I don't say this lightly, so please understand, I understand

00:23:29.419 --> 00:23:36.019
the severity of it, but if the doctor were to tell you that you have cancer, well, just

00:23:36.019 --> 00:23:37.019
leave it.

00:23:37.019 --> 00:23:40.179
We're not going to do any, no, we want to get rid of it.

00:23:40.179 --> 00:23:41.299
Why?

00:23:41.299 --> 00:23:44.779
Because that cancer is going to spread.

00:23:44.779 --> 00:23:46.899
And so we want to get rid of it.

00:23:46.899 --> 00:23:53.979
And so we find that the biblical truths that are provided to us in 1 Corinthians 5, 1 Corinthians

00:23:53.979 --> 00:24:01.539
15 help us to understand that those that are behaving disorderly will have an influence

00:24:01.539 --> 00:24:03.499
on the church.

00:24:03.499 --> 00:24:09.339
They will have an influence on brothers and sisters in Christ, and so therefore Paul,

00:24:09.339 --> 00:24:14.499
under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God, he says, listen, not only are we to identify

00:24:14.499 --> 00:24:22.979
disorderly behavior, we are to correct disorderly behavior, and depending on the response of

00:24:22.979 --> 00:24:30.699
the individual, then ultimately, if there's no positive response to the correction, to

00:24:30.699 --> 00:24:38.139
the warning that's provided, the next step is to separate from, to withdraw yourselves.

00:24:38.459 --> 00:24:48.459
Again, I'm not suggesting this evening that this is an easy step or a desired step.

00:24:48.459 --> 00:24:53.859
I understand relationships, and I understand that there are times in which we'll say, well,

00:24:53.859 --> 00:24:59.579
we can just set aside those differences, we can just set aside these things, and we have

00:24:59.579 --> 00:25:04.539
to understand within the context of the church and hear what's taking place in the church

00:25:04.579 --> 00:25:08.899
in Thessalonica, that Paul speaks expressly under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of

00:25:08.899 --> 00:25:11.539
God of how to deal with these matters.

00:25:11.539 --> 00:25:15.699
I want you to turn to Colossians, and we'll be done this evening, we'll have our prayer

00:25:15.699 --> 00:25:20.699
time, but turn to the book of Colossians, if you will, in the first chapter.

00:25:20.699 --> 00:25:29.539
In Colossians chapter number 1, the end of the chapter, the Apostle Paul provides really,

00:25:29.539 --> 00:25:35.220
if you will, a philosophy of ministry and just his approach to ministry.

00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:42.699
And he says this in verse 28, verse 27 talks about, with Christ in you, the hope of glory.

00:25:42.699 --> 00:25:47.579
He says, whom we preach, I just referenced the latter part of verse 27, because he begins

00:25:47.579 --> 00:25:49.819
verse 28 by saying, whom we preach.

00:25:49.819 --> 00:25:53.919
We preach Christ, amen, 1 Corinthians.

00:25:53.919 --> 00:25:57.979
We preach Christ, Christ crucified, Christ alone.

00:25:57.979 --> 00:26:02.899
He died for us, he was buried and he rose again, and we preach Christ.

00:26:02.899 --> 00:26:11.859
And Paul says, whom we preach, and then notice this, warning every man, and teaching every

00:26:11.859 --> 00:26:14.579
man in all wisdom.

00:26:14.579 --> 00:26:20.739
So we find that there's a preaching, a warning, and a teaching.

00:26:20.739 --> 00:26:26.019
And so sometimes what happens when there's someone that's disorderly, you warn them,

00:26:26.019 --> 00:26:27.500
but then what do you need to do?

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:34.440
You don't just stop with a warning, you then have to teach them what is appropriate.

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:39.019
We find, and we'll mention this again as we go further into 2 Thessalonians chapter 3,

00:26:39.019 --> 00:26:44.779
when he's dealing with the more doctrinal issue at the end of the text, the reality

00:26:44.779 --> 00:26:53.500
is that there's some people that can be led astray, you warn them and then you teach them.

00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:56.299
Sometimes people don't want a warning.

00:26:56.299 --> 00:26:57.979
Sometimes people don't want to be taught.

00:26:57.979 --> 00:27:00.679
It's just the way it is.

00:27:00.679 --> 00:27:04.979
It's a hard thing that you have to acknowledge.

00:27:04.979 --> 00:27:09.379
I remember Jason Caldwell making a statement when he was here preaching one time.

00:27:09.379 --> 00:27:13.779
He said, it breaks my heart that there are people that do not know the truth.

00:27:13.779 --> 00:27:14.779
I agree.

00:27:14.779 --> 00:27:20.019
He said, but what breaks my heart more than that is there are people who do not want to

00:27:20.019 --> 00:27:21.019
know the truth.

00:27:21.019 --> 00:27:22.019
Wow.

00:27:22.019 --> 00:27:26.139
There are people that just don't want the warning.

00:27:26.139 --> 00:27:28.220
There are people that just don't want the teaching.

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:33.619
But I want you to notice why Paul says we preach Christ, we preach Him whom we preach,

00:27:33.619 --> 00:27:36.979
warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, why?

00:27:36.979 --> 00:27:42.459
That we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus.

00:27:42.459 --> 00:27:44.699
Word perfect is complete.

00:27:44.699 --> 00:27:47.019
To be complete in Christ.

00:27:47.019 --> 00:27:51.899
See Paul understood that one day every believer would stand before Christ.

00:27:51.899 --> 00:27:53.379
Every man must appear before Christ.

00:27:53.379 --> 00:27:57.059
If you're saved by the grace of God, you will stand before Christ.

00:27:57.059 --> 00:28:01.679
And so why is Paul preaching and warning and teaching?

00:28:01.679 --> 00:28:06.339
So that when that day comes, you will be prepared for it.

00:28:06.339 --> 00:28:08.659
Now will any of us ever be fully prepared?

00:28:08.659 --> 00:28:09.659
I think not.

00:28:09.659 --> 00:28:12.139
It's a fearful thing.

00:28:12.139 --> 00:28:22.099
It ought to cause us to seriously inspect self-examination and we'll stand before Christ

00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:23.220
one day.

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:28.500
But Paul says that this is why we do what we do.

00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:35.179
Where unto, verse 29, I also labor, striving according to His working which worketh in

00:28:35.179 --> 00:28:36.179
me mightily.

00:28:36.179 --> 00:28:40.859
I'm so thankful that God works in us and through us to accomplish His purpose, but you understand

00:28:40.859 --> 00:28:42.459
that it's still labor.

00:28:42.459 --> 00:28:48.779
He uses that word labor, he uses the word striving, that it communicates to us the labor

00:28:48.779 --> 00:28:49.779
that's involved.

00:28:49.779 --> 00:28:54.659
Now I want you to see in the fourth chapter what it said of Epaphras.

00:28:54.659 --> 00:28:59.419
Epaphras, our understanding of the church in Colossae, Paul never was there.

00:28:59.419 --> 00:29:03.339
He had no part in starting the church, he had no interaction with the believers in Colossae

00:29:03.339 --> 00:29:12.979
save this letter that God inspired and had Paul write to the church that's there in Colossae.

00:29:12.979 --> 00:29:17.820
And he writes to them, he hears about their salvation and testimony and about their walk

00:29:17.859 --> 00:29:19.899
according to the first chapter from Epaphras.

00:29:19.899 --> 00:29:24.059
It's our understanding that he's the pastor of the church.

00:29:24.059 --> 00:29:27.479
Notice what it says in verse 12 of Colossians 4 about Epaphras.

00:29:27.479 --> 00:29:30.419
He says, who is one of you a servant of Christ, saluteth you.

00:29:30.419 --> 00:29:37.940
Notice what it says, always laboring fervently for you in prayers that ye may stand perfect

00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:42.299
and complete in all the will of God.

00:29:42.299 --> 00:29:43.659
Wow.

00:29:43.659 --> 00:29:53.940
What a blessing to have some spiritual leaders that have a concern about individual believers.

00:29:53.940 --> 00:30:01.779
I'm thankful that in my life I've had some spiritual leaders that cared about me.

00:30:01.779 --> 00:30:07.299
I understand there are times in which all of us need to be warned about something.

00:30:07.299 --> 00:30:10.019
None of us are perfect.

00:30:10.019 --> 00:30:15.899
And we ought to be humble in receiving that warning, and we ought to be responsive.

00:30:15.899 --> 00:30:23.439
We ought to, if a warning has to be given, that we do follow the process of self-examination

00:30:23.439 --> 00:30:29.499
and see the legitimacy of the concern that is brought to us so that we can evaluate our

00:30:29.499 --> 00:30:33.019
own behavior and then correct it if it needs to be corrected.

00:30:33.019 --> 00:30:36.739
It's important that we take that response.

00:30:36.739 --> 00:30:41.659
These believers, unfortunately, that are being spoken of in 2 Thessalonians chapter 3 and

00:30:41.659 --> 00:30:48.179
verses 6 through 10, it appears, based upon the direction of the text and the step of

00:30:48.179 --> 00:30:54.979
separation, withdraw yourselves, that these that were guilty simply weren't hearing the

00:30:54.979 --> 00:30:56.939
warning.

00:30:56.939 --> 00:30:59.419
They weren't heeding the warning.

00:30:59.419 --> 00:31:00.499
Find them that are unruly.

00:31:00.499 --> 00:31:03.419
They were told that in 1 Thessalonians 5 verse 14.

00:31:03.419 --> 00:31:05.499
I believe they did.

00:31:05.499 --> 00:31:10.059
And yet there were some that continued to walk disorderly.

00:31:10.059 --> 00:31:14.099
Paul said, no, they've been instructed.

00:31:14.099 --> 00:31:17.899
They've been given an example.

00:31:17.899 --> 00:31:22.179
And if they still won't heed, then you have to separate from them.

00:31:22.179 --> 00:31:27.499
And again, I'm not suggesting this evening that it's an easy thing or even a desired

00:31:27.499 --> 00:31:32.459
thing, but we need to be careful that we understand the power of influence.

00:31:32.459 --> 00:31:34.899
And he says, be not deceived.

00:31:34.899 --> 00:31:39.099
Evil communications will corrupt good manners.

00:31:39.099 --> 00:31:40.099
Let's pray together.

00:31:40.099 --> 00:31:41.099
Father, we love You.

00:31:41.099 --> 00:31:42.099
We thank You for loving us.

00:31:42.099 --> 00:31:47.499
We thank You for the privilege of knowing You and having Your Word.

00:31:47.499 --> 00:31:50.619
We thank You for the truth that's contained therein.

00:31:50.619 --> 00:31:54.459
I pray, Lord, that You would help us to walk worthy, to please You.

00:31:54.459 --> 00:31:58.859
Lord, help us to walk in obedience to Your Word.

00:31:58.859 --> 00:32:00.499
Help us, Lord, as we pray tonight.

00:32:00.499 --> 00:32:01.819
We thank You for the privilege.

00:32:01.819 --> 00:32:07.899
I pray that You would work through this season of corporate prayer that You'd be glorified

00:32:07.899 --> 00:32:10.539
and we'll thank You for it in Christ's name we pray.

00:32:10.539 --> 00:32:11.539
Amen.

00:32:11.539 --> 00:32:13.939
Anyone not get a prayer bulletin when you came in this evening?
