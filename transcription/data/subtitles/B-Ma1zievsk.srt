1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,460
Chapter number one this evening,

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:05,340
you're looking at a couple of verses of Scripture here.

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,179
First Corinthians chapter number one,

4
00:00:07,179 --> 00:00:10,560
as you're turning there, I would say this evening,

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,020
there is little doubt in my mind

6
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:17,020
that you have experienced conflict in your life.

7
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,059
Do you agree with that?

8
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:19,860
You've had conflict at some point,

9
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:22,360
at some level in your life,

10
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:25,659
you have experienced conflict.

11
00:00:25,659 --> 00:00:28,280
We find that relationships, no doubt,

12
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:30,360
are an important part of life.

13
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,740
I'm thankful for relationships, it's a blessing.

14
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:38,200
But at times, relationships can be impacted adversely.

15
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,779
There can be conflict in relationships.

16
00:00:40,779 --> 00:00:44,500
We find that as we begin to think about that subject

17
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,740
this evening and thinking about relationships

18
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,959
and conflict and what have you,

19
00:00:48,959 --> 00:00:50,799
two questions come to my mind,

20
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:54,459
and one is this, how do we respond to conflict?

21
00:00:54,459 --> 00:00:57,139
And then really a better, more appropriate question

22
00:00:57,159 --> 00:00:59,659
would be how do we resolve conflict?

23
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:03,700
I have found in life, as we look at the headlines

24
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,739
and the things going on in our society today,

25
00:01:06,739 --> 00:01:09,199
that there is a real lack of ability

26
00:01:09,199 --> 00:01:12,660
on the part of this generation to resolve conflict.

27
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:17,500
And our conflict resolution skills are lacking,

28
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,800
if I could put it that way, this evening.

29
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,300
And we find that as we think about that truth

30
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:27,000
and the inability for so many to resolve conflict,

31
00:01:27,739 --> 00:01:29,160
we would find that that's not really something new

32
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,459
for this generation.

33
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,419
The problem that all of us have when we deal with conflict

34
00:01:34,419 --> 00:01:36,540
is the old man, the flesh.

35
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,220
And the flesh can be revived very quickly,

36
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:43,639
and the flesh has its own desires

37
00:01:43,639 --> 00:01:47,959
and has its own just way of dealing with things.

38
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:49,599
And that's why it's so important

39
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:50,760
that we understand the truth,

40
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:54,800
that God tells us that we are to crucify our flesh,

41
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,559
we are to mortify our members,

42
00:01:57,559 --> 00:01:59,160
is what we read in the book of Colossians.

43
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,099
We find that the Bible promises us

44
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:03,819
that if we walk in the spirit,

45
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:07,839
we shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh.

46
00:02:07,839 --> 00:02:10,259
And I'm so thankful for the ability,

47
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:13,279
the opportunity that we have as the people of God

48
00:02:13,279 --> 00:02:14,960
to walk in the spirit.

49
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:19,119
And what a blessing that God has given us that opportunity.

50
00:02:19,119 --> 00:02:22,000
As you begin to read the book of 1 Corinthians,

51
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,399
this book, we find it is written to a local church.

52
00:02:25,399 --> 00:02:28,360
We find that there's conflict within this local church.

53
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,880
There are many words that we've used

54
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,399
to describe the church in Corinth.

55
00:02:32,399 --> 00:02:35,320
And we find that as you study through the book,

56
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,940
you'll find a number of the issues

57
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,339
in which they're dealing with.

58
00:02:38,339 --> 00:02:41,020
Some of the problems that are in Corinth,

59
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,839
there's spiritual immaturity that is there,

60
00:02:43,839 --> 00:02:45,759
there's division and contention,

61
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:48,360
there's jealousy, there's envy.

62
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,039
We find that there's legal issues that are dealt with,

63
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:53,240
there are marital issues that are dealt with.

64
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,839
I mean, you just start talking about a church

65
00:02:54,839 --> 00:02:55,919
that has problems.

66
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:59,320
The church at Corinth is a church that has problems.

67
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,679
But you know why it's a church that has problems?

68
00:03:00,679 --> 00:03:01,880
Because it has people.

69
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,000
Has people.

70
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,779
And all those people come from a different background.

71
00:03:07,779 --> 00:03:11,119
All those people have different backgrounds

72
00:03:11,119 --> 00:03:12,039
as they come together.

73
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:15,479
What is the bond that joins us as Christ?

74
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:19,199
And we are thankful for that bond that we have in Christ.

75
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,800
But the reality is that we all have different personalities

76
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,300
and different backgrounds and ways of thinking

77
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,320
and operating and so on and so forth.

78
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,199
And we find that in Christ,

79
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:32,800
those things are to be set aside as we strive for unity.

80
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,360
We find that this church here that has the conflict,

81
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,679
we find that it's described in our text of Scripture

82
00:03:38,679 --> 00:03:42,779
in verses 10 and 11 as divisions and contentions.

83
00:03:42,779 --> 00:03:45,039
I find that as we look at this text of Scripture,

84
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:46,600
look at it with me there in verse number 10,

85
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,520
notice the Apostle Paul gets through

86
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,919
the introductory statements up through verse number nine

87
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:52,759
and he says this in verse 10.

88
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:55,279
"'Now I beseech you, brethren,

89
00:03:56,259 --> 00:03:58,919
"'by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,

90
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:01,639
"'that you all speak the same thing

91
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:05,779
"'and that there be no divisions among you,

92
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:09,300
"'but that you be perfectly joined together

93
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:13,800
"'in the same mind and in the same judgment.

94
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:18,799
"'For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren,

95
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,600
"'by them which are of the house of Chloe,

96
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,839
"'that there are contentions among you.'"

97
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:28,899
So we read of divisions and contentions,

98
00:04:28,899 --> 00:04:31,760
thus the title for the message this evening.

99
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,679
As we look at these two verses of Scripture,

100
00:04:33,679 --> 00:04:35,420
we find very quickly,

101
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,559
we discover a couple of important truths.

102
00:04:37,559 --> 00:04:41,359
Number one is that Paul is made aware of the problem.

103
00:04:41,359 --> 00:04:43,760
Notice he says that he's beseeching them

104
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,519
and then he tells them in verse number 11,

105
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:49,640
"'For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren,

106
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,760
"'by them which are of the house of Chloe,

107
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,079
"'that there are contentions among you.'"

108
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:58,040
And so we find that the Apostle Paul, a spiritual leader,

109
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,920
God used the Apostle Paul to go to the city of Corinth

110
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,119
to see this church established.

111
00:05:04,119 --> 00:05:09,119
God would now use Paul to write this letter back to them.

112
00:05:09,119 --> 00:05:11,880
Of course, 2 Corinthians being written to them as well.

113
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,959
We find that the Apostle Paul has been made aware

114
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:19,399
of an issue that's taking place at the church at Corinth.

115
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:24,399
And the reality is that I commend the house of Chloe

116
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:28,119
for making Paul aware of this situation.

117
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:31,239
And they no doubt had some concern

118
00:05:31,239 --> 00:05:34,079
with regard to the division and contention.

119
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:37,239
They were concerned for a measure of unity.

120
00:05:37,239 --> 00:05:39,839
And so Paul was made aware of the problem,

121
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,760
but I'm thankful that as Paul was made aware of the problem

122
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,480
that then Paul addresses the problem.

123
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,079
And we find that he addresses it.

124
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:50,440
Notice in verse number 11, he says,

125
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,079
"'I beseech you.'"

126
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:55,040
And he uses this terminology, this verbiage

127
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,679
to show the importance, this call to unity.

128
00:05:58,679 --> 00:06:01,720
He says, "'Brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,

129
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,399
"'notice that you all speak the same thing

130
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:09,160
"'and that there be no divisions among you,

131
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,679
"'but that you be perfectly joined together

132
00:06:11,679 --> 00:06:15,279
"'in the same mind and in the same judgment.'"

133
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:17,359
He then says at the end of verse number 11,

134
00:06:17,359 --> 00:06:19,920
"'that there are contentions among you.'"

135
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,880
We find that he gives some insight in the next few verses

136
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,000
with regard to the source of some

137
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,839
of this contention and division.

138
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:29,119
He says, "'Now this I say that every one of you sayeth,

139
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:31,760
"'I am of Paul, and I have Apollos,

140
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,519
"'and I have Cephas, and I have Christ.

141
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,000
"'Is Christ divided?

142
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,320
"'Was Paul crucified for you?

143
00:06:38,359 --> 00:06:40,839
"'Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?''

144
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:42,600
As we begin to see, and we're not gonna harp

145
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,079
on that portion too much,

146
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:47,839
but we see that these things are causing this division.

147
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:49,839
There's a group of people in the church that's over here

148
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:54,079
that says, well, we, this group, we associate,

149
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:56,239
we're identifying, we're of Paul.

150
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,959
And then there's a group over here that says,

151
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:01,160
well, you guys are of Paul, and that's fine,

152
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,519
but we, we're of Apollos.

153
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:08,079
We're of Cephas, or Peter.

154
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:09,839
I'm of Christ.

155
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:12,799
And you begin to get this division and this contention

156
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:16,119
and how that they would look down upon one another

157
00:07:16,119 --> 00:07:18,640
and begin to operate.

158
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,359
Obviously, there's spiritual immaturity,

159
00:07:20,359 --> 00:07:23,359
there's carnality that we read of as we continue studying

160
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:24,640
through the book of 1 Corinthians,

161
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:28,119
but we find that Paul, he addresses the problem.

162
00:07:28,119 --> 00:07:31,320
He seeks to resolve the problem.

163
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,440
He wants them to understand the importance

164
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,480
of having unity.

165
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,760
The circumstances here in the church at Corinth,

166
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,600
I would say, are unfortunate.

167
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,600
They're unfortunate circumstances,

168
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,359
because what happens is when a church, a family,

169
00:07:47,359 --> 00:07:50,720
any group of people that are in a relationship

170
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,279
have divisions and contentions,

171
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:55,320
the problem is that we can't go forward

172
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,399
the way that we're supposed to.

173
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:59,880
The church in Corinth was not able to really do

174
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,799
all that God had commissioned them to do

175
00:08:02,799 --> 00:08:06,519
because of these divisions and these contentions.

176
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,959
By the way, that's the goal of the enemy.

177
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:11,959
That's the goal of the enemy.

178
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:14,279
And we find that the circumstances are unfortunate,

179
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:16,279
yet we find that still today,

180
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:19,160
churches and families continue with conflict,

181
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,119
and if that conflict is not resolved properly

182
00:08:22,119 --> 00:08:24,279
and biblically, we find that it will lead

183
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:26,040
to divisions and contentions,

184
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:30,519
and we find that the flesh will thrive in the,

185
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:32,840
I mean, it's just a terrible situation.

186
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,760
Look at two verses of Scripture with me,

187
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,039
one in the Old Testament, one in the New.

188
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,359
Look at Psalm 133 and verse number one.

189
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,359
Psalm 133 and verse number one.

190
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:47,919
Then we'll look over at the New Testament

191
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:49,760
book of Ephesians.

192
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,440
Then I wanna give you five thoughts this evening,

193
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,640
seeking to be extremely biblical,

194
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,479
and I would say extremely practical this evening.

195
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:02,520
What do we do when there's conflict?

196
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,320
How do we resolve conflict?

197
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:09,159
Notice what God says, because God's plan

198
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:13,239
and God's desire is unity, unity.

199
00:09:13,239 --> 00:09:15,320
By the way, unity is a wonderful thing.

200
00:09:16,239 --> 00:09:17,880
It really is.

201
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,760
If you have a relationship, listen,

202
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,039
husbands and wives, it's a good thing

203
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:24,280
when you're in unity one with another.

204
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,960
It's not pleasant when there's contention and division.

205
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,159
I mean, I don't like it.

206
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:31,159
I don't like contention, I don't like division.

207
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:33,039
I like unity.

208
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,440
I don't like to be in a situation

209
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,159
where there's some relationship in life,

210
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:41,640
whether it's a work relationship,

211
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,479
whether it's just a relationship in the neighborhood,

212
00:09:43,479 --> 00:09:46,200
maybe it's a church member relationship,

213
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,479
whatever the relationship is,

214
00:09:47,479 --> 00:09:50,200
I don't like it when you are in a situation,

215
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,400
you see somebody and you feel like

216
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,760
you have to try to avoid them.

217
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,599
Why?

218
00:09:53,599 --> 00:09:56,280
Because there's conflict, there's contention,

219
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,799
there's division.

220
00:09:57,799 --> 00:09:59,440
That's not God's intent.

221
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,980
Notice what the Bible says in Psalm 133 and verse number 1.

222
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:11,140
Behold, how good and how pleasant it is

223
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:17,980
for brethren to dwell together in unity.

224
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:23,000
Notice how he describes it as being good and pleasant.

225
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,660
Good and pleasant.

226
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:28,380
For brethren to dwell together in unity.

227
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,660
Notice what the New Testament says in the book of Ephesians.

228
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:34,980
I want you to understand there's a great difference when you think about the Old Testament and

229
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:41,460
think about the children of Israel and all that's taking place there and God giving that

230
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:46,660
truth to the children of Israel and understanding their situation.

231
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:51,420
But then when you look at the book of Ephesians, you begin to see, and Paul makes mention of

232
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:58,260
the mystery of the church and how the church is this organism, it's a living organism,

233
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,620
this organization many have called it.

234
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:03,300
We think about the church as a body of believers.

235
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,020
The church is not a building.

236
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,060
The building is the place where we meet.

237
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,620
Often we say we're going to church.

238
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:14,160
But what makes this place church is that the brethren assemble.

239
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:20,380
We could assemble anywhere and we would say we're having church because the church is

240
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,220
the body of believers that have assembled.

241
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:28,600
The local church, as we would say fellowship Baptist church, is this group of believers

242
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:34,260
that have voluntarily, voluntarily, no one forced anyone, by the way if it's forced it's

243
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:39,940
a problem, it's a voluntarily join themselves together for the purpose of carrying out the

244
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,779
Great Commission.

245
00:11:41,779 --> 00:11:43,020
That's the purpose.

246
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:48,180
And we find, however, that the church has made up the mystery, that which is being spoken

247
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:53,459
of, of Jews and Gentiles.

248
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:56,020
Now I want you to just think about that just for a second.

249
00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:01,900
There's conflict from the start between Jews and Gentiles.

250
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,819
You can read of it in the Scriptures.

251
00:12:03,819 --> 00:12:09,820
You can read and you can understand as you study historically and you look at those historical

252
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:15,020
writings, you can read of the divisions, the contentions, the conflict, if you will, between

253
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,540
Jews and Gentiles.

254
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:21,660
To be very plain this evening, the Jews hated the Gentiles.

255
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,660
Just the way it was.

256
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:28,900
Jesus said, I must needs go through Samaria in John chapter number 4.

257
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:34,540
That was a problem for many Jewish people because the Samaritans were a hated people.

258
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:41,580
But Jesus went because they needed the gospel, they needed the truth.

259
00:12:41,619 --> 00:12:47,979
So what was it that would bind, that would be that common bond between Jews and Gentiles

260
00:12:47,979 --> 00:12:54,180
in this thing called the church would be Jesus Christ.

261
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:59,860
And I'm so thankful that in Christ we are brothers and sisters in Christ.

262
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:04,900
We have different backgrounds, we have different upbringings, different cultures and manners

263
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,260
and so on and so forth.

264
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:09,460
But what we have in common is Christ.

265
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:14,059
And notice what he says in Ephesians 4 in verse number 3.

266
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:24,220
He says this, endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace.

267
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:28,779
You know, when there's unity, there's peace.

268
00:13:28,779 --> 00:13:30,540
He uses that word endeavoring.

269
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:33,460
That word endeavor is an interesting word.

270
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,720
It means, it carries with it a few thoughts.

271
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:41,240
One is to make haste, to be diligent, to labor.

272
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:46,440
Now think about the context of what we're reading here.

273
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:54,000
He says endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace.

274
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,360
That we are laboring, we are being diligent, we are making haste.

275
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,360
For what purpose?

276
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:06,639
To have, to keep, to maintain the unity of the spirit.

277
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,400
That God would give us that unity that we were to have.

278
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:18,600
It's the idea of laboring for something, desiring to have it and being diligent to get it.

279
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,040
Endeavoring.

280
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:27,799
And God says that should be our approach when it comes to this idea of conflict, here unity.

281
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:32,100
We're endeavoring for unity, we're striving for it.

282
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:36,320
So when conflict arises, how do we respond?

283
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,040
What do we do?

284
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:42,480
Five thoughts this evening, biblical, I believe extremely practical.

285
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,760
Number one, recognize the real enemy.

286
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,760
Recognize the real enemy.

287
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:54,559
Go over to the book of 1 Peter, if you will, in chapter number five.

288
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:59,239
I'm going to tell you this evening, this is super practical, super basic truth.

289
00:14:59,239 --> 00:15:05,519
You know sometimes it's the basics that we really need.

290
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:13,000
In 1 Peter chapter number five, in verse number eight, a verse of scripture that we are familiar

291
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,839
with, the Bible says this, be sober, be vigilant.

292
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:21,440
Is your adversary the devil?

293
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,320
As a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour.

294
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,799
Whom resist steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished

295
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:33,559
in your brethren that are in the world.

296
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:38,880
I believe when conflict would arise in your life or in my life, it's important that first

297
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,679
we recognize who the real enemy is.

298
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:43,720
The real enemy is Satan.

299
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:48,320
Husbands, your wife is not your enemy.

300
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,920
Satan is your enemy.

301
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,519
Wives, your husband is not your enemy.

302
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:54,000
Satan is your enemy.

303
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,640
Children, your parents are not your enemy.

304
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:01,519
Parents, your children are not your enemy, right?

305
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,880
We have an enemy and it's Satan.

306
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,399
Church member, a fellow church member is not your enemy.

307
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:11,959
Satan is your enemy.

308
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:17,440
And it is absolutely important for us, I would say it's imperative for us at the time when

309
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:24,559
conflict would arise, that we take a step back and we recognize, we take the situation

310
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:27,760
and we say, the enemy is at work here.

311
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,559
And the enemy is not you, the enemy is Satan.

312
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:31,559
You know what Satan likes to do?

313
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:32,559
He likes to divide.

314
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:33,559
You know what Satan is?

315
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:41,080
He's a liar, the father of it, he's a murderer, deceiver, he's the accuser of the brethren.

316
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,640
He's a defeated foe, but he's active.

317
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:50,760
And what he wants to do in any local church is he wants to cause conflict between members.

318
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:55,480
What he wants to do in any home is cause conflict between the members of that home.

319
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,480
Why?

320
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,440
Because he hates everything that God loves.

321
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:06,040
And he wants there to be conflict because he wants there to be division and contention.

322
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:11,000
He wants there to be infighting and so many things going internally that we forget about

323
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,200
what God has really instructed us to do.

324
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:19,000
I believe it's imperative that when we begin to think about the subject of conflict in

325
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,799
your life and in my life, that we must recognize the real enemy and that is Satan.

326
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:27,880
Number two, we must resist the enemy.

327
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,399
We must resist the devil.

328
00:17:29,399 --> 00:17:33,519
We see in verse number nine, the Bible says, whom resists steadfast in the faith.

329
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:35,440
Turn to the book of James, if you will.

330
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,160
In the fourth chapter of the book of James, we see again in this portion of Scripture

331
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,040
the importance of resisting the devil.

332
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:48,119
We understand here that there is a truth that is given that is essential for us to

333
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:53,880
understand in James 4 and verse number seven, where the Bible begins by saying, submit yourselves

334
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,839
therefore to God.

335
00:17:56,839 --> 00:17:59,160
Submit yourselves therefore to God.

336
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:08,360
Then after we're submitted to God, he says, resist the devil and he will flee from you.

337
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,360
Isn't that a wonderful promise?

338
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,239
I mean, we sang this morning, standing on the promises.

339
00:18:13,239 --> 00:18:17,640
Oh, there are so many promises and we can thank God for the promises that he's given

340
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,200
us in his word, but this promise right here, when he says, submit yourselves therefore

341
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:27,080
to God, resist the devil and he will flee from you.

342
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,640
I like that promise.

343
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,880
I'm thankful that God has given us that promise.

344
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,799
We must recognize who the real enemy is.

345
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:38,080
We must resist the devil.

346
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,599
Look over at the book of Ephesians, if you will, in the fourth chapter.

347
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:47,960
We started here in chapter three at the endeavoring, excuse me, chapter four, endeavoring to keep

348
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,000
the unity of the spirit in verse number three there.

349
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,359
But we find that as we move forward through the chapter, Ephesians chapter number four,

350
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:59,039
we find that God continues to give us instruction.

351
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,280
It's interesting what he says, and I'm going to get back to verse number 26 here in just

352
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,280
a moment.

353
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,400
But look, if you will, at verse number 27.

354
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:10,840
The Bible says this in Ephesians 4 and verse 27, neither give place to the devil.

355
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,239
Neither give place to the devil.

356
00:19:13,239 --> 00:19:16,679
You know, often we talk about the devil having a stronghold.

357
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:21,119
A preacher said it this way, that really all Satan's looking for is a toehold so they get

358
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:24,799
a foothold so they can get a stronghold.

359
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,599
And listen, we need to give no place to the devil.

360
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:29,039
We need to acknowledge who he is.

361
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,440
We need to acknowledge that he is the real enemy.

362
00:19:31,479 --> 00:19:36,159
And when the conflict arises, when something is said, when someone does whatever it might

363
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:41,400
be, we recognize who the real enemy is and then we resist the enemy.

364
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,919
We say, no, not today, right?

365
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:48,400
Like get thee behind me, Satan.

366
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,479
I stood out in the foyer this morning and I told that young girl that that's what she

367
00:19:51,479 --> 00:19:55,640
needed to say to Satan because God is true and Satan is a liar.

368
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:59,440
And when Satan comes and tries to whisper to her that you're really not saved, I said,

369
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,400
You need to believe what God said.

370
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,800
He said that, listen, if you believe that He's the only Savior and that you're a sinner

371
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:09,040
and you called out to Him for salvation, He promised that He would save you.

372
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,140
So what do you say to the enemy?

373
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:13,360
Get thee behind me, Satan.

374
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,680
We find this evening when we have conflict in our lives that we have to recognize that

375
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,980
the devil is the real enemy.

376
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:23,160
He wants you to think that it's your spouse.

377
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,840
He wants you to think it's your child.

378
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,000
He wants you to think it's a fellow church member.

379
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,360
But the reality is that it's the devil, Satan himself, he's the enemy.

380
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:36,480
He's the accuser of the brethren and we must resist the devil.

381
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:45,080
I would say this, number three, number three, we must review what we know to be true.

382
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:48,480
We must review what we know to be true.

383
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,480
What do I mean by that?

384
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:55,680
Well, I know that Holly loves me.

385
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,920
I know that I love Holly.

386
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:04,240
So if Holly were to say something to me that I took maybe as being inappropriate, something

387
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,920
that was cutting, I need to review what I know to be true.

388
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:12,360
I need to review that I know that she loves me.

389
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,279
That changes things.

390
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:15,680
It helps us in our perspective.

391
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:19,000
Notice in the book of Philippians, chapter number four, we'll look at a couple of verses

392
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,400
and really they deal with my, these two points, number four, three and four.

393
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,680
But look at the book of Philippians, if you will, in chapter number four, Philippians

394
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,639
chapter number four.

395
00:21:31,639 --> 00:21:37,880
You know, what you know to be true should permeate your mind.

396
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:42,560
The Bible says in Philippians four and verse number eight, finally brethren, what sort

397
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,760
of things are true?

398
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,740
What sort of things are honest?

399
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,760
What sort of things are just?

400
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,400
What sort of things are pure?

401
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,180
What sort of things are lovely?

402
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,279
What sort of things are of good report?

403
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:58,600
If there be any virtue and if there be any praise, notice what he says, think on these

404
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,800
things.

405
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,220
Think on these things.

406
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:07,520
So when that individual says something, when something happens, we must review what we

407
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,160
know to be true.

408
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:14,639
No doubt in your life and in my life there's been a time that you've said something that

409
00:22:14,639 --> 00:22:17,880
maybe didn't come out exactly the way that you intended for it to come out.

410
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,139
Has it ever happened?

411
00:22:20,139 --> 00:22:26,580
And we find here that when you think about conflict, there are times and I've had opportunity,

412
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:31,740
I'll use that word, over the years to sit and to have counseling sessions with people

413
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,139
and so on and so forth.

414
00:22:33,139 --> 00:22:38,460
And at times you sit there and you're thinking, this is so insignificant.

415
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:41,979
But it became such a huge matter.

416
00:22:41,979 --> 00:22:43,820
Why?

417
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,139
Because they were thinking about the wrong thing.

418
00:22:46,139 --> 00:22:47,979
They didn't really recognize who the enemy was.

419
00:22:47,979 --> 00:22:49,279
They didn't resist the enemy.

420
00:22:49,419 --> 00:22:52,119
They didn't review in their mind what they knew to be true.

421
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:56,919
But they were thinking about these other things and they took them and twisted them and so

422
00:22:56,919 --> 00:22:57,919
on and so forth.

423
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,839
We see that Paul says, think on these things.

424
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:04,839
Notice over in the book of 2 Corinthians chapter number 10.

425
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:11,800
2 Corinthians chapter number 10.

426
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:20,360
Notice what the Bible says in verse number 3.

427
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,919
Second Corinthians 10 and verse number 3, for though we walk in the flesh, we do not

428
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:24,400
war after the flesh.

429
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,760
For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through the God to the pulling

430
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:33,479
down of strongholds, casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself

431
00:23:33,479 --> 00:23:38,400
against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience

432
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,400
of Christ.

433
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:43,740
You know what happens sometimes when there's a conflict?

434
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:47,199
Not only do we not review what we know to be true, number three, but if you're taking

435
00:23:47,199 --> 00:23:55,240
notes number four, sometimes what we do, and I've put it this way in my notes, is the action

436
00:23:55,240 --> 00:24:00,760
that we must take is that we must refuse to continuously replay the event.

437
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:03,500
Refuse to continuously replay the event.

438
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:08,000
Sometimes what happens when we're, have some kind of a conflict is instead of thinking

439
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,119
about and reminding ourselves, reviewing in our mind what we know to be true, we just

440
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:16,320
keep replaying something in our mind that happened.

441
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,320
I can't believe that happened that way that it happened.

442
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:23,760
Whatever it is that happened and we keep replaying that thing in our mind and we think, we're

443
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,279
thinking about it, we're thinking about it, we're thinking about it, and we're getting

444
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,480
more and more angry and, right?

445
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:36,080
I'm trying to be very helpful this evening because we all face conflict in life.

446
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:43,720
Listen, there are people that don't know how to handle conflict in our world today, seriously.

447
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:50,320
Two days ago, some guy went and shot five people because they asked him to be quiet.

448
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,320
That's nuts.

449
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,320
It's insane.

450
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,320
Would you agree?

451
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,320
That's not how you resolve conflict.

452
00:24:54,320 --> 00:25:05,320
And if we're not careful, sometimes we can think, well, the conflict is just loss of

453
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,160
people, lost people.

454
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,920
Paul's writing to a church.

455
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,000
He calls them brethren.

456
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:18,839
There's conflict in the church at Corinth, and we'd be foolish to say that I don't have

457
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:21,360
any conflict in my life whatsoever.

458
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:27,760
No, there's conflict, and how do we deal with the conflict?

459
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,440
We find that he says that we're to bring into captivity every thought to the obedience of

460
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,839
Christ.

461
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:39,040
Sometimes we can just permeate and just kind of like that percolator, that coffee is percolating

462
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:42,799
and we just allow that thing to replant our mind and replant our mind and replant our

463
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,000
mind.

464
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,399
We're getting upset and we're getting angry and it's just boiling over.

465
00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:49,880
No.

466
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:54,040
We must review what we know to be true in that situation.

467
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:58,080
Listen, I'm sure in your life and in my, I asked in Sunday school this morning, I said,

468
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,320
how many of you are thankful when God is long suffering to you?

469
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,320
Just about everybody raised their hand.

470
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:06,200
I said, now how many of you don't understand when God's long suffering to somebody else?

471
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,360
It's hard, right?

472
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:12,239
But when God's long suffering to us, we're thankful that God's long suffering.

473
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:16,279
Listen, I'm thankful when somebody could be gracious to me.

474
00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:22,760
If I say something, if I do something, there's a measure of grace that's extended, right?

475
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:26,360
And we ought to be responsive in the same manner.

476
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:31,080
We find here that there are times in which we just allow something to replay in our minds

477
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,320
and it's a dangerous thing.

478
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:37,239
Listen, the enemy is going to use that.

479
00:26:37,239 --> 00:26:40,779
The enemy is going to use that and it's not a good thing.

480
00:26:40,779 --> 00:26:48,080
Number five this evening, I would say this, resolve the conflict quickly.

481
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,480
Resolve the conflict quickly.

482
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:55,959
See, we read in Ephesians 4 and verse number 3 where he said that we're endeavoring and

483
00:26:55,959 --> 00:26:59,119
I talked about making haste, be diligent, labor.

484
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:04,360
And we go back to the book of Ephesians and that fourth chapter and we see this as endeavoring

485
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:10,080
to keep the unity of the spirit and the bond of peace and this laboring for something and

486
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,600
diligent and laboring for it, making haste for it.

487
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:18,320
We come to the end of the text of Scripture in Ephesians chapter number 4 and very quickly

488
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:23,279
all of this back and forth things are going on of put off this and put on that and the

489
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:29,279
importance of walking not as other Gentiles walk and walking as believers.

490
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:35,360
But we come to verse number 26 of Ephesians chapter number 4 and we read verse 27 already

491
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:41,480
but when you put them together in context, notice what the Bible says, be angry and sin

492
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,480
not.

493
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:49,959
If you'd be honest this evening, that is a very hard thing to do because you know what

494
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:52,320
many people do when they're angry?

495
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,399
They sin.

496
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:56,279
They sin.

497
00:27:56,279 --> 00:28:01,399
So here we find that the Scriptures tell us be angry and sin not.

498
00:28:01,399 --> 00:28:07,040
Anger is an emotion that we have as people, as human beings, it's an emotion that we have.

499
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:10,119
Could we say this evening there are times in the life and ministry of the Lord Jesus

500
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:11,920
Christ that he was angry?

501
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:15,320
Sure, but yet he's without sin.

502
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,559
It can be done.

503
00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:20,040
You can be angry and sin not.

504
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,119
The problem for many of us is we have no idea how to do that.

505
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:27,519
But he says be angry and sin not.

506
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:35,780
The point where he resolved the conflict quickly, notice what he says, let not the sun go down

507
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:38,700
upon your wrath.

508
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:45,559
Let not the sun go down upon your wrath, neither give place to the devil.

509
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:51,720
Resolving conflict quickly that we would understand in relationships that we have in

510
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:54,840
life that the real enemy is Satan.

511
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,039
We're not each other's enemy.

512
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:58,039
I don't think so.

513
00:28:58,039 --> 00:28:59,840
I don't consider you an enemy.

514
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,080
I hope you don't consider me an enemy.

515
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,200
I hope you don't consider the people sitting next to you an enemy.

516
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,840
We have an enemy.

517
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,919
We have a common enemy.

518
00:29:08,919 --> 00:29:14,039
And what our common enemy wants us to do is he wants us to think that someone other than

519
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:16,640
him is the enemy.

520
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:22,119
He wants you to start getting in your mind that somebody else is your enemy and he wants

521
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:28,559
you to replace some things and so on and so forth and he wants there to be that division,

522
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,119
those contentions.

523
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:37,679
And as the people of God, we've been warned in God's Word as to how the enemy works, how

524
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:38,940
he operates.

525
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:42,080
The Bible tells us as Paul is writing to the believers in 2 Corinthians, he says we're

526
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,799
not ignorant of his devices.

527
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,520
We know how Satan operates.

528
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:49,359
We know what he seeks to do.

529
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:54,720
And we find this evening that as we look at this thought in 1 Corinthians 1 and verses

530
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:59,520
10 and 11 and we see how Paul is made aware of what's going on in the church of course.

531
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:04,880
4th and then Paul addresses it, I mean he hits it, he faces it head on. He says we need

532
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,600
to address this thing, we need to deal with this thing, we need to resolve this thing

533
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:14,880
because it's not good for there to be contention and division. We must have unity and unity

534
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:22,200
is possible. It is possible to resolve conflict in a manner in which God is honored. I would

535
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:31,880
say this, it requires humility, it requires humility. Many times it requires someone saying

536
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:42,600
I was wrong, I'm sorry. Those are two phrases that many times pride will keep an individual

537
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:46,800
from saying because they don't want to acknowledge that they are wrong, they don't want to acknowledge

538
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:55,600
that they're sorry. That's your flesh. But we find that as we give no place to our flesh,

539
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:01,320
as we're walking in the Spirit, we're understanding what the enemy is really trying to do and

540
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:06,720
how the enemy is trying to work. Listen, Satan knows that his time is short. We'd be crazy

541
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:12,920
to think that he wouldn't try to cause some contention or division amongst our congregation.

542
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:20,120
We'd be nuts to think that. The enemy is active. He wants to do all that he can do

543
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:27,080
to cause contention and division in your home, amongst your family, and in our church. Five

544
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:34,480
very simple, biblical, I believe practical tips if I could call them that this evening

545
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:42,440
of how we can resolve conflict. He says, let not the sun go down upon your wrath, neither

546
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:49,520
give place to the devil. I believe that as we would consider that statement there in

547
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:59,720
verse 26 and 27, what happens oftentimes is we just kind of muse upon it. It festers up.

548
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:06,040
It gets bigger. It becomes a larger problem. You ever heard the expression, don't make

549
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:12,400
a mountain out of a? You've heard it. You know it. People talk about it. But you know

550
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:20,280
what? Sometimes we're really good at making mountains out of molehills. It's our flesh.

551
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:24,720
So this evening, as we think about this church in Corinth and so many things we could say

552
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:29,640
about this church in Corinth, so many lessons that we learn, I'm thankful that God chose

553
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:37,520
to record for us in His Word the situation in Corinth. I believe that many churches throughout

554
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:46,400
church history can be helped by what we read that the church in Corinth dealt with this

555
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:52,840
evening. What do we do when conflict comes? How do we respond? How do we resolve conflict?

556
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:59,520
I hope tonight just some basic biblical thoughts that we could apply in our lives, in our homes

557
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:04,520
in our church, in our relationships, wherever those relationships might be, that would enable

558
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:12,160
us to resolve conflict, that we could have unity. It is a good thing. It is a pleasant

559
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:18,680
thing is what the psalmist said in Psalm 133, for brethren to dwell together in unity. Let's

560
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:25,200
pray together. Father, we love You. We thank You for loving us. Thank You for Your Word,

561
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:35,120
for the truth that's contained therein. Really a simple thought this evening. It's so necessary

562
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:45,960
in our lives. I pray that tonight, Lord, You would help us, each of us, Lord, as Your people.

563
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:55,320
Lord, I pray that You would allow us to have unity in our homes, in our church, in our

564
00:33:55,320 --> 00:34:00,760
relationships. Lord, help us to walk in the Spirit so that we would not fulfill the lust

565
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:12,720
of the flesh. Lord, help us to be clothed in humility. Help us, God, to recognize who

566
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:28,960
the real enemy is. And help us to place our efforts not towards one another in contending

567
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:39,200
and dividing, but help us to resist the enemy, steadfastly, as Peter said. I pray that You'd

568
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:43,920
move and work in hearts and lives as only You can. We'll thank You for it. In Christ's

569
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:48,000
name we pray. Would you stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed. Kimberly's going

570
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:55,440
to play quietly on the piano just for a moment, giving opportunity to respond. As Kimberly

571
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,880
plays, the altar is open.
