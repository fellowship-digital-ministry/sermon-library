00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.460
Chapter number one this evening,

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.340
you're looking at a couple of verses of Scripture here.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.179
First Corinthians chapter number one,

00:00:07.179 --> 00:00:10.560
as you're turning there, I would say this evening,

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.020
there is little doubt in my mind

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.020
that you have experienced conflict in your life.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.059
Do you agree with that?

00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:19.860
You've had conflict at some point,

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.360
at some level in your life,

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.659
you have experienced conflict.

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:28.280
We find that relationships, no doubt,

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:30.360
are an important part of life.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.740
I'm thankful for relationships, it's a blessing.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:38.200
But at times, relationships can be impacted adversely.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.779
There can be conflict in relationships.

00:00:40.779 --> 00:00:44.500
We find that as we begin to think about that subject

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.740
this evening and thinking about relationships

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.959
and conflict and what have you,

00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:50.799
two questions come to my mind,

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:54.459
and one is this, how do we respond to conflict?

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:57.139
And then really a better, more appropriate question

00:00:57.159 --> 00:00:59.659
would be how do we resolve conflict?

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:03.700
I have found in life, as we look at the headlines

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.739
and the things going on in our society today,

00:01:06.739 --> 00:01:09.199
that there is a real lack of ability

00:01:09.199 --> 00:01:12.660
on the part of this generation to resolve conflict.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:17.500
And our conflict resolution skills are lacking,

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.800
if I could put it that way, this evening.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.300
And we find that as we think about that truth

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.000
and the inability for so many to resolve conflict,

00:01:27.739 --> 00:01:29.160
we would find that that's not really something new

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.459
for this generation.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.419
The problem that all of us have when we deal with conflict

00:01:34.419 --> 00:01:36.540
is the old man, the flesh.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.220
And the flesh can be revived very quickly,

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.639
and the flesh has its own desires

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:47.959
and has its own just way of dealing with things.

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:49.599
And that's why it's so important

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:50.760
that we understand the truth,

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.800
that God tells us that we are to crucify our flesh,

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.559
we are to mortify our members,

00:01:57.559 --> 00:01:59.160
is what we read in the book of Colossians.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.099
We find that the Bible promises us

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:03.819
that if we walk in the spirit,

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:07.839
we shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh.

00:02:07.839 --> 00:02:10.259
And I'm so thankful for the ability,

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.279
the opportunity that we have as the people of God

00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:14.960
to walk in the spirit.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.119
And what a blessing that God has given us that opportunity.

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:22.000
As you begin to read the book of 1 Corinthians,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.399
this book, we find it is written to a local church.

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:28.360
We find that there's conflict within this local church.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.880
There are many words that we've used

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.399
to describe the church in Corinth.

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:35.320
And we find that as you study through the book,

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.940
you'll find a number of the issues

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.339
in which they're dealing with.

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:41.020
Some of the problems that are in Corinth,

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.839
there's spiritual immaturity that is there,

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:45.759
there's division and contention,

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:48.360
there's jealousy, there's envy.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.039
We find that there's legal issues that are dealt with,

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:53.240
there are marital issues that are dealt with.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.839
I mean, you just start talking about a church

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:55.919
that has problems.

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:59.320
The church at Corinth is a church that has problems.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.679
But you know why it's a church that has problems?

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:01.880
Because it has people.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.000
Has people.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.779
And all those people come from a different background.

00:03:07.779 --> 00:03:11.119
All those people have different backgrounds

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:12.039
as they come together.

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:15.479
What is the bond that joins us as Christ?

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:19.199
And we are thankful for that bond that we have in Christ.

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:21.800
But the reality is that we all have different personalities

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.300
and different backgrounds and ways of thinking

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.320
and operating and so on and so forth.

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.199
And we find that in Christ,

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:32.800
those things are to be set aside as we strive for unity.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.360
We find that this church here that has the conflict,

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.679
we find that it's described in our text of Scripture

00:03:38.679 --> 00:03:42.779
in verses 10 and 11 as divisions and contentions.

00:03:42.779 --> 00:03:45.039
I find that as we look at this text of Scripture,

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:46.600
look at it with me there in verse number 10,

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.520
notice the Apostle Paul gets through

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.919
the introductory statements up through verse number nine

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:52.759
and he says this in verse 10.

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:55.279
"'Now I beseech you, brethren,

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:58.919
"'by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:01.639
"'that you all speak the same thing

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:05.779
"'and that there be no divisions among you,

00:04:05.779 --> 00:04:09.300
"'but that you be perfectly joined together

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.800
"'in the same mind and in the same judgment.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.799
"'For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren,

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.600
"'by them which are of the house of Chloe,

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.839
"'that there are contentions among you.'"

00:04:26.839 --> 00:04:28.899
So we read of divisions and contentions,

00:04:28.899 --> 00:04:31.760
thus the title for the message this evening.

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.679
As we look at these two verses of Scripture,

00:04:33.679 --> 00:04:35.420
we find very quickly,

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.559
we discover a couple of important truths.

00:04:37.559 --> 00:04:41.359
Number one is that Paul is made aware of the problem.

00:04:41.359 --> 00:04:43.760
Notice he says that he's beseeching them

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:45.519
and then he tells them in verse number 11,

00:04:45.519 --> 00:04:49.640
"'For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren,

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.760
"'by them which are of the house of Chloe,

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.079
"'that there are contentions among you.'"

00:04:54.079 --> 00:04:58.040
And so we find that the Apostle Paul, a spiritual leader,

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.920
God used the Apostle Paul to go to the city of Corinth

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.119
to see this church established.

00:05:04.119 --> 00:05:09.119
God would now use Paul to write this letter back to them.

00:05:09.119 --> 00:05:11.880
Of course, 2 Corinthians being written to them as well.

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.959
We find that the Apostle Paul has been made aware

00:05:15.959 --> 00:05:19.399
of an issue that's taking place at the church at Corinth.

00:05:19.399 --> 00:05:24.399
And the reality is that I commend the house of Chloe

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.119
for making Paul aware of this situation.

00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:31.239
And they no doubt had some concern

00:05:31.239 --> 00:05:34.079
with regard to the division and contention.

00:05:34.079 --> 00:05:37.239
They were concerned for a measure of unity.

00:05:37.239 --> 00:05:39.839
And so Paul was made aware of the problem,

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:42.760
but I'm thankful that as Paul was made aware of the problem

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.480
that then Paul addresses the problem.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.079
And we find that he addresses it.

00:05:49.079 --> 00:05:50.440
Notice in verse number 11, he says,

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.079
"'I beseech you.'"

00:05:52.079 --> 00:05:55.040
And he uses this terminology, this verbiage

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.679
to show the importance, this call to unity.

00:05:58.679 --> 00:06:01.720
He says, "'Brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.399
"'notice that you all speak the same thing

00:06:04.399 --> 00:06:09.160
"'and that there be no divisions among you,

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.679
"'but that you be perfectly joined together

00:06:11.679 --> 00:06:15.279
"'in the same mind and in the same judgment.'"

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:17.359
He then says at the end of verse number 11,

00:06:17.359 --> 00:06:19.920
"'that there are contentions among you.'"

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:22.880
We find that he gives some insight in the next few verses

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.000
with regard to the source of some

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.839
of this contention and division.

00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:29.119
He says, "'Now this I say that every one of you sayeth,

00:06:29.119 --> 00:06:31.760
"'I am of Paul, and I have Apollos,

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.519
"'and I have Cephas, and I have Christ.

00:06:34.519 --> 00:06:36.000
"'Is Christ divided?

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.320
"'Was Paul crucified for you?

00:06:38.359 --> 00:06:40.839
"'Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?''

00:06:40.839 --> 00:06:42.600
As we begin to see, and we're not gonna harp

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.079
on that portion too much,

00:06:44.079 --> 00:06:47.839
but we see that these things are causing this division.

00:06:47.839 --> 00:06:49.839
There's a group of people in the church that's over here

00:06:49.839 --> 00:06:54.079
that says, well, we, this group, we associate,

00:06:54.079 --> 00:06:56.239
we're identifying, we're of Paul.

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:58.959
And then there's a group over here that says,

00:06:58.959 --> 00:07:01.160
well, you guys are of Paul, and that's fine,

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.519
but we, we're of Apollos.

00:07:05.519 --> 00:07:08.079
We're of Cephas, or Peter.

00:07:08.839 --> 00:07:09.839
I'm of Christ.

00:07:09.839 --> 00:07:12.799
And you begin to get this division and this contention

00:07:12.799 --> 00:07:16.119
and how that they would look down upon one another

00:07:16.119 --> 00:07:18.640
and begin to operate.

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.359
Obviously, there's spiritual immaturity,

00:07:20.359 --> 00:07:23.359
there's carnality that we read of as we continue studying

00:07:23.359 --> 00:07:24.640
through the book of 1 Corinthians,

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:28.119
but we find that Paul, he addresses the problem.

00:07:28.119 --> 00:07:31.320
He seeks to resolve the problem.

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:34.440
He wants them to understand the importance

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:37.480
of having unity.

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.760
The circumstances here in the church at Corinth,

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.600
I would say, are unfortunate.

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:44.600
They're unfortunate circumstances,

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.359
because what happens is when a church, a family,

00:07:47.359 --> 00:07:50.720
any group of people that are in a relationship

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.279
have divisions and contentions,

00:07:53.279 --> 00:07:55.320
the problem is that we can't go forward

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.399
the way that we're supposed to.

00:07:57.399 --> 00:07:59.880
The church in Corinth was not able to really do

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:02.799
all that God had commissioned them to do

00:08:02.799 --> 00:08:06.519
because of these divisions and these contentions.

00:08:06.519 --> 00:08:08.959
By the way, that's the goal of the enemy.

00:08:10.279 --> 00:08:11.959
That's the goal of the enemy.

00:08:11.959 --> 00:08:14.279
And we find that the circumstances are unfortunate,

00:08:14.279 --> 00:08:16.279
yet we find that still today,

00:08:16.279 --> 00:08:19.160
churches and families continue with conflict,

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:22.119
and if that conflict is not resolved properly

00:08:22.119 --> 00:08:24.279
and biblically, we find that it will lead

00:08:24.279 --> 00:08:26.040
to divisions and contentions,

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:30.519
and we find that the flesh will thrive in the,

00:08:30.519 --> 00:08:32.840
I mean, it's just a terrible situation.

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:35.760
Look at two verses of Scripture with me,

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.039
one in the Old Testament, one in the New.

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:40.359
Look at Psalm 133 and verse number one.

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:44.359
Psalm 133 and verse number one.

00:08:46.679 --> 00:08:47.919
Then we'll look over at the New Testament

00:08:47.919 --> 00:08:49.760
book of Ephesians.

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.440
Then I wanna give you five thoughts this evening,

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:55.640
seeking to be extremely biblical,

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:58.479
and I would say extremely practical this evening.

00:08:59.799 --> 00:09:02.520
What do we do when there's conflict?

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:05.320
How do we resolve conflict?

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:09.159
Notice what God says, because God's plan

00:09:09.159 --> 00:09:13.239
and God's desire is unity, unity.

00:09:13.239 --> 00:09:15.320
By the way, unity is a wonderful thing.

00:09:16.239 --> 00:09:17.880
It really is.

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.760
If you have a relationship, listen,

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:22.039
husbands and wives, it's a good thing

00:09:22.039 --> 00:09:24.280
when you're in unity one with another.

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:26.960
It's not pleasant when there's contention and division.

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.159
I mean, I don't like it.

00:09:28.159 --> 00:09:31.159
I don't like contention, I don't like division.

00:09:31.159 --> 00:09:33.039
I like unity.

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:35.440
I don't like to be in a situation

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:39.159
where there's some relationship in life,

00:09:39.159 --> 00:09:41.640
whether it's a work relationship,

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.479
whether it's just a relationship in the neighborhood,

00:09:43.479 --> 00:09:46.200
maybe it's a church member relationship,

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.479
whatever the relationship is,

00:09:47.479 --> 00:09:50.200
I don't like it when you are in a situation,

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.400
you see somebody and you feel like

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:52.760
you have to try to avoid them.

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:53.599
Why?

00:09:53.599 --> 00:09:56.280
Because there's conflict, there's contention,

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.799
there's division.

00:09:57.799 --> 00:09:59.440
That's not God's intent.

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:02.980
Notice what the Bible says in Psalm 133 and verse number 1.

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:11.140
Behold, how good and how pleasant it is

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:17.980
for brethren to dwell together in unity.

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:23.000
Notice how he describes it as being good and pleasant.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.660
Good and pleasant.

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:28.380
For brethren to dwell together in unity.

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:31.660
Notice what the New Testament says in the book of Ephesians.

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:34.980
I want you to understand there's a great difference when you think about the Old Testament and

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:41.460
think about the children of Israel and all that's taking place there and God giving that

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:46.660
truth to the children of Israel and understanding their situation.

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:51.420
But then when you look at the book of Ephesians, you begin to see, and Paul makes mention of

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:58.260
the mystery of the church and how the church is this organism, it's a living organism,

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.620
this organization many have called it.

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:03.300
We think about the church as a body of believers.

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:05.020
The church is not a building.

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:07.060
The building is the place where we meet.

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:09.620
Often we say we're going to church.

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:14.160
But what makes this place church is that the brethren assemble.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:20.380
We could assemble anywhere and we would say we're having church because the church is

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:23.220
the body of believers that have assembled.

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:28.600
The local church, as we would say fellowship Baptist church, is this group of believers

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:34.260
that have voluntarily, voluntarily, no one forced anyone, by the way if it's forced it's

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:39.940
a problem, it's a voluntarily join themselves together for the purpose of carrying out the

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:41.779
Great Commission.

00:11:41.779 --> 00:11:43.020
That's the purpose.

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:48.180
And we find, however, that the church has made up the mystery, that which is being spoken

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:53.459
of, of Jews and Gentiles.

00:11:53.459 --> 00:11:56.020
Now I want you to just think about that just for a second.

00:11:56.020 --> 00:12:01.900
There's conflict from the start between Jews and Gentiles.

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:03.819
You can read of it in the Scriptures.

00:12:03.819 --> 00:12:09.820
You can read and you can understand as you study historically and you look at those historical

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:15.020
writings, you can read of the divisions, the contentions, the conflict, if you will, between

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:17.540
Jews and Gentiles.

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:21.660
To be very plain this evening, the Jews hated the Gentiles.

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:23.660
Just the way it was.

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:28.900
Jesus said, I must needs go through Samaria in John chapter number 4.

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:34.540
That was a problem for many Jewish people because the Samaritans were a hated people.

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:41.580
But Jesus went because they needed the gospel, they needed the truth.

00:12:41.619 --> 00:12:47.979
So what was it that would bind, that would be that common bond between Jews and Gentiles

00:12:47.979 --> 00:12:54.180
in this thing called the church would be Jesus Christ.

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:59.860
And I'm so thankful that in Christ we are brothers and sisters in Christ.

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:04.900
We have different backgrounds, we have different upbringings, different cultures and manners

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:06.260
and so on and so forth.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.460
But what we have in common is Christ.

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:14.059
And notice what he says in Ephesians 4 in verse number 3.

00:13:14.059 --> 00:13:24.220
He says this, endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace.

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:28.779
You know, when there's unity, there's peace.

00:13:28.779 --> 00:13:30.540
He uses that word endeavoring.

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:33.460
That word endeavor is an interesting word.

00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:35.720
It means, it carries with it a few thoughts.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:41.240
One is to make haste, to be diligent, to labor.

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:46.440
Now think about the context of what we're reading here.

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:54.000
He says endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.360
That we are laboring, we are being diligent, we are making haste.

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:00.360
For what purpose?

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:06.639
To have, to keep, to maintain the unity of the spirit.

00:14:06.639 --> 00:14:10.400
That God would give us that unity that we were to have.

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:18.600
It's the idea of laboring for something, desiring to have it and being diligent to get it.

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.040
Endeavoring.

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:27.799
And God says that should be our approach when it comes to this idea of conflict, here unity.

00:14:27.799 --> 00:14:32.100
We're endeavoring for unity, we're striving for it.

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:36.320
So when conflict arises, how do we respond?

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:38.040
What do we do?

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:42.480
Five thoughts this evening, biblical, I believe extremely practical.

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:47.760
Number one, recognize the real enemy.

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:48.760
Recognize the real enemy.

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:54.559
Go over to the book of 1 Peter, if you will, in chapter number five.

00:14:54.559 --> 00:14:59.239
I'm going to tell you this evening, this is super practical, super basic truth.

00:14:59.239 --> 00:15:05.519
You know sometimes it's the basics that we really need.

00:15:05.519 --> 00:15:13.000
In 1 Peter chapter number five, in verse number eight, a verse of scripture that we are familiar

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.839
with, the Bible says this, be sober, be vigilant.

00:15:18.839 --> 00:15:21.440
Is your adversary the devil?

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:26.320
As a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour.

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:29.799
Whom resist steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished

00:15:29.799 --> 00:15:33.559
in your brethren that are in the world.

00:15:33.559 --> 00:15:38.880
I believe when conflict would arise in your life or in my life, it's important that first

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:41.679
we recognize who the real enemy is.

00:15:41.679 --> 00:15:43.720
The real enemy is Satan.

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:48.320
Husbands, your wife is not your enemy.

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:49.920
Satan is your enemy.

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:52.519
Wives, your husband is not your enemy.

00:15:52.519 --> 00:15:54.000
Satan is your enemy.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.640
Children, your parents are not your enemy.

00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:01.519
Parents, your children are not your enemy, right?

00:16:01.519 --> 00:16:04.880
We have an enemy and it's Satan.

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:09.399
Church member, a fellow church member is not your enemy.

00:16:09.399 --> 00:16:11.959
Satan is your enemy.

00:16:11.959 --> 00:16:17.440
And it is absolutely important for us, I would say it's imperative for us at the time when

00:16:17.559 --> 00:16:24.559
conflict would arise, that we take a step back and we recognize, we take the situation

00:16:24.559 --> 00:16:27.760
and we say, the enemy is at work here.

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:30.559
And the enemy is not you, the enemy is Satan.

00:16:30.559 --> 00:16:31.559
You know what Satan likes to do?

00:16:31.559 --> 00:16:32.559
He likes to divide.

00:16:32.559 --> 00:16:33.559
You know what Satan is?

00:16:33.559 --> 00:16:41.080
He's a liar, the father of it, he's a murderer, deceiver, he's the accuser of the brethren.

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:44.640
He's a defeated foe, but he's active.

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:50.760
And what he wants to do in any local church is he wants to cause conflict between members.

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:55.480
What he wants to do in any home is cause conflict between the members of that home.

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:56.480
Why?

00:16:56.480 --> 00:17:00.440
Because he hates everything that God loves.

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:06.040
And he wants there to be conflict because he wants there to be division and contention.

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:11.000
He wants there to be infighting and so many things going internally that we forget about

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.200
what God has really instructed us to do.

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:19.000
I believe it's imperative that when we begin to think about the subject of conflict in

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.799
your life and in my life, that we must recognize the real enemy and that is Satan.

00:17:24.799 --> 00:17:27.880
Number two, we must resist the enemy.

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:29.399
We must resist the devil.

00:17:29.399 --> 00:17:33.519
We see in verse number nine, the Bible says, whom resists steadfast in the faith.

00:17:33.519 --> 00:17:35.440
Turn to the book of James, if you will.

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:39.160
In the fourth chapter of the book of James, we see again in this portion of Scripture

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:42.040
the importance of resisting the devil.

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:48.119
We understand here that there is a truth that is given that is essential for us to

00:17:48.119 --> 00:17:53.880
understand in James 4 and verse number seven, where the Bible begins by saying, submit yourselves

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:56.839
therefore to God.

00:17:56.839 --> 00:17:59.160
Submit yourselves therefore to God.

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:08.360
Then after we're submitted to God, he says, resist the devil and he will flee from you.

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:10.360
Isn't that a wonderful promise?

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:13.239
I mean, we sang this morning, standing on the promises.

00:18:13.239 --> 00:18:17.640
Oh, there are so many promises and we can thank God for the promises that he's given

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:21.200
us in his word, but this promise right here, when he says, submit yourselves therefore

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:27.080
to God, resist the devil and he will flee from you.

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:28.640
I like that promise.

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:32.880
I'm thankful that God has given us that promise.

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:35.799
We must recognize who the real enemy is.

00:18:35.799 --> 00:18:38.080
We must resist the devil.

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:41.599
Look over at the book of Ephesians, if you will, in the fourth chapter.

00:18:41.599 --> 00:18:47.960
We started here in chapter three at the endeavoring, excuse me, chapter four, endeavoring to keep

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:51.000
the unity of the spirit in verse number three there.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.359
But we find that as we move forward through the chapter, Ephesians chapter number four,

00:18:55.359 --> 00:18:59.039
we find that God continues to give us instruction.

00:18:59.039 --> 00:19:02.280
It's interesting what he says, and I'm going to get back to verse number 26 here in just

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:03.280
a moment.

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:05.400
But look, if you will, at verse number 27.

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:10.840
The Bible says this in Ephesians 4 and verse 27, neither give place to the devil.

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:13.239
Neither give place to the devil.

00:19:13.239 --> 00:19:16.679
You know, often we talk about the devil having a stronghold.

00:19:16.679 --> 00:19:21.119
A preacher said it this way, that really all Satan's looking for is a toehold so they get

00:19:21.119 --> 00:19:24.799
a foothold so they can get a stronghold.

00:19:24.799 --> 00:19:27.599
And listen, we need to give no place to the devil.

00:19:27.599 --> 00:19:29.039
We need to acknowledge who he is.

00:19:29.039 --> 00:19:31.440
We need to acknowledge that he is the real enemy.

00:19:31.479 --> 00:19:36.159
And when the conflict arises, when something is said, when someone does whatever it might

00:19:36.159 --> 00:19:41.400
be, we recognize who the real enemy is and then we resist the enemy.

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:43.919
We say, no, not today, right?

00:19:43.919 --> 00:19:48.400
Like get thee behind me, Satan.

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:51.479
I stood out in the foyer this morning and I told that young girl that that's what she

00:19:51.479 --> 00:19:55.640
needed to say to Satan because God is true and Satan is a liar.

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:59.440
And when Satan comes and tries to whisper to her that you're really not saved, I said,

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:01.400
You need to believe what God said.

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:04.800
He said that, listen, if you believe that He's the only Savior and that you're a sinner

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:09.040
and you called out to Him for salvation, He promised that He would save you.

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:11.140
So what do you say to the enemy?

00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:13.360
Get thee behind me, Satan.

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:17.680
We find this evening when we have conflict in our lives that we have to recognize that

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:20.980
the devil is the real enemy.

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:23.160
He wants you to think that it's your spouse.

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:24.840
He wants you to think it's your child.

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:27.000
He wants you to think it's a fellow church member.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.360
But the reality is that it's the devil, Satan himself, he's the enemy.

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:36.480
He's the accuser of the brethren and we must resist the devil.

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:45.080
I would say this, number three, number three, we must review what we know to be true.

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:48.480
We must review what we know to be true.

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:51.480
What do I mean by that?

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:55.680
Well, I know that Holly loves me.

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:57.920
I know that I love Holly.

00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:04.240
So if Holly were to say something to me that I took maybe as being inappropriate, something

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:08.920
that was cutting, I need to review what I know to be true.

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:12.360
I need to review that I know that she loves me.

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:14.279
That changes things.

00:21:14.279 --> 00:21:15.680
It helps us in our perspective.

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:19.000
Notice in the book of Philippians, chapter number four, we'll look at a couple of verses

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:24.400
and really they deal with my, these two points, number four, three and four.

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:28.680
But look at the book of Philippians, if you will, in chapter number four, Philippians

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:31.639
chapter number four.

00:21:31.639 --> 00:21:37.880
You know, what you know to be true should permeate your mind.

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:42.560
The Bible says in Philippians four and verse number eight, finally brethren, what sort

00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:44.760
of things are true?

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:46.740
What sort of things are honest?

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:48.760
What sort of things are just?

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:50.400
What sort of things are pure?

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:52.180
What sort of things are lovely?

00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:53.279
What sort of things are of good report?

00:21:53.279 --> 00:21:58.600
If there be any virtue and if there be any praise, notice what he says, think on these

00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:00.800
things.

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:03.220
Think on these things.

00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:07.520
So when that individual says something, when something happens, we must review what we

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:10.160
know to be true.

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:14.639
No doubt in your life and in my life there's been a time that you've said something that

00:22:14.639 --> 00:22:17.880
maybe didn't come out exactly the way that you intended for it to come out.

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:20.139
Has it ever happened?

00:22:20.139 --> 00:22:26.580
And we find here that when you think about conflict, there are times and I've had opportunity,

00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:31.740
I'll use that word, over the years to sit and to have counseling sessions with people

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:33.139
and so on and so forth.

00:22:33.139 --> 00:22:38.460
And at times you sit there and you're thinking, this is so insignificant.

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:41.979
But it became such a huge matter.

00:22:41.979 --> 00:22:43.820
Why?

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:46.139
Because they were thinking about the wrong thing.

00:22:46.139 --> 00:22:47.979
They didn't really recognize who the enemy was.

00:22:47.979 --> 00:22:49.279
They didn't resist the enemy.

00:22:49.419 --> 00:22:52.119
They didn't review in their mind what they knew to be true.

00:22:52.119 --> 00:22:56.919
But they were thinking about these other things and they took them and twisted them and so

00:22:56.919 --> 00:22:57.919
on and so forth.

00:22:57.919 --> 00:23:01.839
We see that Paul says, think on these things.

00:23:01.839 --> 00:23:04.839
Notice over in the book of 2 Corinthians chapter number 10.

00:23:04.839 --> 00:23:11.800
2 Corinthians chapter number 10.

00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:20.360
Notice what the Bible says in verse number 3.

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:22.919
Second Corinthians 10 and verse number 3, for though we walk in the flesh, we do not

00:23:22.919 --> 00:23:24.400
war after the flesh.

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:28.760
For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through the God to the pulling

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:33.479
down of strongholds, casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself

00:23:33.479 --> 00:23:38.400
against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:39.400
of Christ.

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:43.740
You know what happens sometimes when there's a conflict?

00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:47.199
Not only do we not review what we know to be true, number three, but if you're taking

00:23:47.199 --> 00:23:55.240
notes number four, sometimes what we do, and I've put it this way in my notes, is the action

00:23:55.240 --> 00:24:00.760
that we must take is that we must refuse to continuously replay the event.

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:03.500
Refuse to continuously replay the event.

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:08.000
Sometimes what happens when we're, have some kind of a conflict is instead of thinking

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:13.119
about and reminding ourselves, reviewing in our mind what we know to be true, we just

00:24:13.119 --> 00:24:16.320
keep replaying something in our mind that happened.

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:19.320
I can't believe that happened that way that it happened.

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:23.760
Whatever it is that happened and we keep replaying that thing in our mind and we think, we're

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:27.279
thinking about it, we're thinking about it, we're thinking about it, and we're getting

00:24:27.279 --> 00:24:29.480
more and more angry and, right?

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:36.080
I'm trying to be very helpful this evening because we all face conflict in life.

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:43.720
Listen, there are people that don't know how to handle conflict in our world today, seriously.

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:50.320
Two days ago, some guy went and shot five people because they asked him to be quiet.

00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:51.320
That's nuts.

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:52.320
It's insane.

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:53.320
Would you agree?

00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:54.320
That's not how you resolve conflict.

00:24:54.320 --> 00:25:05.320
And if we're not careful, sometimes we can think, well, the conflict is just loss of

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:07.160
people, lost people.

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:08.920
Paul's writing to a church.

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:11.000
He calls them brethren.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:18.839
There's conflict in the church at Corinth, and we'd be foolish to say that I don't have

00:25:18.839 --> 00:25:21.360
any conflict in my life whatsoever.

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:27.760
No, there's conflict, and how do we deal with the conflict?

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:31.440
We find that he says that we're to bring into captivity every thought to the obedience of

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.839
Christ.

00:25:33.839 --> 00:25:39.040
Sometimes we can just permeate and just kind of like that percolator, that coffee is percolating

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:42.799
and we just allow that thing to replant our mind and replant our mind and replant our

00:25:42.799 --> 00:25:44.000
mind.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.399
We're getting upset and we're getting angry and it's just boiling over.

00:25:48.399 --> 00:25:49.880
No.

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:54.040
We must review what we know to be true in that situation.

00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:58.080
Listen, I'm sure in your life and in my, I asked in Sunday school this morning, I said,

00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:01.320
how many of you are thankful when God is long suffering to you?

00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:02.320
Just about everybody raised their hand.

00:26:02.799 --> 00:26:06.200
I said, now how many of you don't understand when God's long suffering to somebody else?

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:08.360
It's hard, right?

00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:12.239
But when God's long suffering to us, we're thankful that God's long suffering.

00:26:12.239 --> 00:26:16.279
Listen, I'm thankful when somebody could be gracious to me.

00:26:16.279 --> 00:26:22.760
If I say something, if I do something, there's a measure of grace that's extended, right?

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:26.360
And we ought to be responsive in the same manner.

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:31.080
We find here that there are times in which we just allow something to replay in our minds

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:33.320
and it's a dangerous thing.

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:37.239
Listen, the enemy is going to use that.

00:26:37.239 --> 00:26:40.779
The enemy is going to use that and it's not a good thing.

00:26:40.779 --> 00:26:48.080
Number five this evening, I would say this, resolve the conflict quickly.

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:50.480
Resolve the conflict quickly.

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:55.959
See, we read in Ephesians 4 and verse number 3 where he said that we're endeavoring and

00:26:55.959 --> 00:26:59.119
I talked about making haste, be diligent, labor.

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:04.360
And we go back to the book of Ephesians and that fourth chapter and we see this as endeavoring

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:10.080
to keep the unity of the spirit and the bond of peace and this laboring for something and

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:13.600
diligent and laboring for it, making haste for it.

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:18.320
We come to the end of the text of Scripture in Ephesians chapter number 4 and very quickly

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:23.279
all of this back and forth things are going on of put off this and put on that and the

00:27:23.279 --> 00:27:29.279
importance of walking not as other Gentiles walk and walking as believers.

00:27:29.279 --> 00:27:35.360
But we come to verse number 26 of Ephesians chapter number 4 and we read verse 27 already

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:41.480
but when you put them together in context, notice what the Bible says, be angry and sin

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:42.480
not.

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:49.959
If you'd be honest this evening, that is a very hard thing to do because you know what

00:27:49.959 --> 00:27:52.320
many people do when they're angry?

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:54.399
They sin.

00:27:54.399 --> 00:27:56.279
They sin.

00:27:56.279 --> 00:28:01.399
So here we find that the Scriptures tell us be angry and sin not.

00:28:01.399 --> 00:28:07.040
Anger is an emotion that we have as people, as human beings, it's an emotion that we have.

00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:10.119
Could we say this evening there are times in the life and ministry of the Lord Jesus

00:28:10.119 --> 00:28:11.920
Christ that he was angry?

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:15.320
Sure, but yet he's without sin.

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:17.559
It can be done.

00:28:17.559 --> 00:28:20.040
You can be angry and sin not.

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:23.119
The problem for many of us is we have no idea how to do that.

00:28:23.119 --> 00:28:27.519
But he says be angry and sin not.

00:28:27.519 --> 00:28:35.780
The point where he resolved the conflict quickly, notice what he says, let not the sun go down

00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:38.700
upon your wrath.

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:45.559
Let not the sun go down upon your wrath, neither give place to the devil.

00:28:45.559 --> 00:28:51.720
Resolving conflict quickly that we would understand in relationships that we have in

00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:54.840
life that the real enemy is Satan.

00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:57.039
We're not each other's enemy.

00:28:57.039 --> 00:28:58.039
I don't think so.

00:28:58.039 --> 00:28:59.840
I don't consider you an enemy.

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:02.080
I hope you don't consider me an enemy.

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:05.200
I hope you don't consider the people sitting next to you an enemy.

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:06.840
We have an enemy.

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:08.919
We have a common enemy.

00:29:08.919 --> 00:29:14.039
And what our common enemy wants us to do is he wants us to think that someone other than

00:29:14.039 --> 00:29:16.640
him is the enemy.

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:22.119
He wants you to start getting in your mind that somebody else is your enemy and he wants

00:29:22.119 --> 00:29:28.559
you to replace some things and so on and so forth and he wants there to be that division,

00:29:28.559 --> 00:29:31.119
those contentions.

00:29:31.119 --> 00:29:37.679
And as the people of God, we've been warned in God's Word as to how the enemy works, how

00:29:37.679 --> 00:29:38.940
he operates.

00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:42.080
The Bible tells us as Paul is writing to the believers in 2 Corinthians, he says we're

00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:44.799
not ignorant of his devices.

00:29:44.799 --> 00:29:46.520
We know how Satan operates.

00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:49.359
We know what he seeks to do.

00:29:49.359 --> 00:29:54.720
And we find this evening that as we look at this thought in 1 Corinthians 1 and verses

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:59.520
10 and 11 and we see how Paul is made aware of what's going on in the church of course.

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:04.880
4th and then Paul addresses it, I mean he hits it, he faces it head on. He says we need

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:08.600
to address this thing, we need to deal with this thing, we need to resolve this thing

00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:14.880
because it's not good for there to be contention and division. We must have unity and unity

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:22.200
is possible. It is possible to resolve conflict in a manner in which God is honored. I would

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:31.880
say this, it requires humility, it requires humility. Many times it requires someone saying

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:42.600
I was wrong, I'm sorry. Those are two phrases that many times pride will keep an individual

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:46.800
from saying because they don't want to acknowledge that they are wrong, they don't want to acknowledge

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:55.600
that they're sorry. That's your flesh. But we find that as we give no place to our flesh,

00:30:55.600 --> 00:31:01.320
as we're walking in the Spirit, we're understanding what the enemy is really trying to do and

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:06.720
how the enemy is trying to work. Listen, Satan knows that his time is short. We'd be crazy

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:12.920
to think that he wouldn't try to cause some contention or division amongst our congregation.

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:20.120
We'd be nuts to think that. The enemy is active. He wants to do all that he can do

00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:27.080
to cause contention and division in your home, amongst your family, and in our church. Five

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:34.480
very simple, biblical, I believe practical tips if I could call them that this evening

00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:42.440
of how we can resolve conflict. He says, let not the sun go down upon your wrath, neither

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:49.520
give place to the devil. I believe that as we would consider that statement there in

00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:59.720
verse 26 and 27, what happens oftentimes is we just kind of muse upon it. It festers up.

00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:06.040
It gets bigger. It becomes a larger problem. You ever heard the expression, don't make

00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:12.400
a mountain out of a? You've heard it. You know it. People talk about it. But you know

00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:20.280
what? Sometimes we're really good at making mountains out of molehills. It's our flesh.

00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:24.720
So this evening, as we think about this church in Corinth and so many things we could say

00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:29.640
about this church in Corinth, so many lessons that we learn, I'm thankful that God chose

00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:37.520
to record for us in His Word the situation in Corinth. I believe that many churches throughout

00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:46.400
church history can be helped by what we read that the church in Corinth dealt with this

00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:52.840
evening. What do we do when conflict comes? How do we respond? How do we resolve conflict?

00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:59.520
I hope tonight just some basic biblical thoughts that we could apply in our lives, in our homes

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:04.520
in our church, in our relationships, wherever those relationships might be, that would enable

00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:12.160
us to resolve conflict, that we could have unity. It is a good thing. It is a pleasant

00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:18.680
thing is what the psalmist said in Psalm 133, for brethren to dwell together in unity. Let's

00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:25.200
pray together. Father, we love You. We thank You for loving us. Thank You for Your Word,

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:35.120
for the truth that's contained therein. Really a simple thought this evening. It's so necessary

00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:45.960
in our lives. I pray that tonight, Lord, You would help us, each of us, Lord, as Your people.

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:55.320
Lord, I pray that You would allow us to have unity in our homes, in our church, in our

00:33:55.320 --> 00:34:00.760
relationships. Lord, help us to walk in the Spirit so that we would not fulfill the lust

00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:12.720
of the flesh. Lord, help us to be clothed in humility. Help us, God, to recognize who

00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:28.960
the real enemy is. And help us to place our efforts not towards one another in contending

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:39.200
and dividing, but help us to resist the enemy, steadfastly, as Peter said. I pray that You'd

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:43.920
move and work in hearts and lives as only You can. We'll thank You for it. In Christ's

00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:56.880
