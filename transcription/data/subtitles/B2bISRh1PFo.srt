1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
one and very thankful for the opportunity to be gathered together in

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:09,439
the Lord's house this morning. Thankful for the blessings already and what

3
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:14,159
wonderful songs that we have the privilege of singing this morning.

4
00:00:14,159 --> 00:00:21,639
Oh Lord send a revival and the songwriter said let it begin in me and

5
00:00:21,639 --> 00:00:26,819
what a wonderful prayer that is and then we sing that wonderful hymn nothing

6
00:00:26,819 --> 00:00:32,139
between. I hope that this morning you can say that there's nothing between my

7
00:00:32,139 --> 00:00:38,939
soul and my Savior and I'm so thankful that we have a God who is gracious and

8
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:43,139
merciful and as it's said in the Old Testament on more than one occasion that

9
00:00:43,139 --> 00:00:49,099
there is that he is ready to pardon and ready to forgive that with thee there is

10
00:00:49,099 --> 00:00:54,659
forgiveness. John said it this way if any if we confess our sins that he is

11
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:59,659
faithful and just to forgive us and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness and

12
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:04,900
what a blessed truth and so thankful for the Word of God and that God has

13
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:10,660
allowed us to have the Bible. Of course Brother Mershawn was scheduled to

14
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:15,599
preach this morning and this evening and throughout the week as well and I am

15
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:20,139
thankful that I normally don't have an opportunity to preach during a revival

16
00:01:20,139 --> 00:01:25,540
meeting and I typically have the opportunity ahead of in preparation of a

17
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:30,860
revival meeting preaching a series of messages on preparation for revival and

18
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:34,419
then possibly after revival meeting preaching and so I'm thankful this

19
00:01:34,419 --> 00:01:38,580
morning for the opportunity and I really saw the face of the Lord with regard to

20
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:43,379
the passage to preach and what have you just trusted to be a blessing to you

21
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:47,459
this morning. I mentioned already after our first song that we have that

22
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:52,860
question are we revival ready or are we revival resistant. Unfortunately there

23
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,860
are some folks that are just kind of like in that mindset of just leave me

24
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,940
alone I'm okay with how things are I'm kind of status quo I'm not interested in

25
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:04,620
getting my toes stepped on I don't want preaching that's gonna sit in my lap so

26
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,980
on and so forth and there are others that say I want to be revival ready I

27
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:14,419
want God to work in my heart in my life I understand that when the Word of God

28
00:02:14,419 --> 00:02:19,339
is preached and the Holy Spirit of God uses the Word of God to convict me that

29
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:24,699
that's a good thing amen and I'm so thankful for the ministry of God's Word

30
00:02:24,699 --> 00:02:30,179
that it has the ability to at the very same time not only convict me but

31
00:02:30,179 --> 00:02:35,059
comfort me and it's an amazing truth that we see within the Word of God and

32
00:02:35,059 --> 00:02:39,860
this morning as I think about revival and I think about the the truth of

33
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:44,740
revival and the opportunity to study historically revivals that you can read

34
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:49,419
in in the history of not only our nation but other nations that experienced

35
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:52,820
revival if you go back to the Old Testament and you read about some of the

36
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:58,500
revivals during the Judah's history Israel the ten tribes of the north they

37
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,539
never really after the divided kingdom there is no real record of any revival

38
00:03:02,539 --> 00:03:08,220
they had bad wicked Kings and idolatry really was was rampant there and so on

39
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:12,059
and so forth but there in Judah every once in a while you'd see where a king

40
00:03:12,059 --> 00:03:16,500
comes along that was a good king that believed in the power of the Word of God

41
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:21,259
and was open to the message of the prophets and you would see revival and

42
00:03:21,259 --> 00:03:25,339
something that's interesting and really if you think about my mind this morning

43
00:03:25,339 --> 00:03:29,580
specifically thinking about the time of Jehoshaphat and his reign and some of

44
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,539
the revival that took place during his reign you can think of Josiah as well

45
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:39,899
and something that you see consistent is not only the preaching of the Word of

46
00:03:39,899 --> 00:03:44,899
God in fact during Josiah's time you see that they were cleaning out the temple

47
00:03:44,899 --> 00:03:50,179
and they found the Word of the Lord and they read it and of course the response

48
00:03:50,179 --> 00:03:54,940
to the to the reading of the Word of God and we see that something that is

49
00:03:54,940 --> 00:04:00,820
consistent we think about revival is this subject of cleansing this this

50
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:04,539
truth you see within the scriptures of the Old Testament during the period of

51
00:04:04,539 --> 00:04:10,860
those revivals how that the the temple needed to be cleansed why because it had

52
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:14,699
been polluted and you would see that there were times in which there were

53
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:20,500
some some wicked Kings and there was idolatrous worship that was taking place

54
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:25,660
and the the temple was polluted and you'd find that one of the very first

55
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:29,940
things that would happen is a cleansing of the temple and it reminds me as we

56
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:33,980
would think about the truth of that in the Old Testament we think about the

57
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:38,540
ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ and you understand that on two occasions

58
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:42,339
once in the beginning of his ministry and once right near the end of his

59
00:04:42,339 --> 00:04:47,700
ministry publicly speaking during that period of time you find that Jesus went

60
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:52,420
to the temple and he cleansed the temple once in the beginning of his ministry

61
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:57,459
once at the end of his ministry we find that for New Testament believers this

62
00:04:57,459 --> 00:05:02,540
morning if you have trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal Savior

63
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:06,820
you've been bought with a price that is the precious blood of Christ we're not

64
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:13,940
our own we belong to him and the Bible tells us that we are the temple of the

65
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:18,739
Holy Ghost and what a blessed truth we find that the Word of God reveals to us

66
00:05:18,739 --> 00:05:24,339
the truth with regard to the indwelling of the Spirit of God and also the

67
00:05:24,339 --> 00:05:28,019
filling of the Spirit of God we think about the indwelling of the Spirit of

68
00:05:28,019 --> 00:05:32,299
God we find that both that Paul deals with it both with the believers in

69
00:05:32,299 --> 00:05:36,540
Corinth and also with the believers in Ephesus that the indwelling of the

70
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:41,179
Spirit of God that is the earnest of our salvation that is the proof of our

71
00:05:41,179 --> 00:05:46,779
redemption and what a blessed truth that is but we find that as we go through our

72
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:51,980
lives this important aspect and we think about the cleansing aspect and we'll get

73
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:56,420
to it as we get in the message this morning that only comes as a result of

74
00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:02,059
some examination some examination and so this morning as we look at this passage

75
00:06:02,059 --> 00:06:07,220
of Scripture I really want to focus upon the what I would call the discipline of

76
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:11,619
self-examination the matter of self-examination I believe is of

77
00:06:11,619 --> 00:06:19,059
significant importance however I would say this morning that far too often in

78
00:06:19,059 --> 00:06:26,459
2020 broadly speaking in Christian circles it is a discipline that is far

79
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:32,739
too often ignored this morning we understand as we observe the Lord's

80
00:06:32,739 --> 00:06:38,380
Supper we have the the table there and it says this do in remembrance of me and

81
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:43,980
so often as we think about the table and the Lord's Supper and that ordinance

82
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:49,019
that he gave us yes it's a table it's a memorial it's a table of remembrance but

83
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:53,980
we find that the Bible says in 1st Corinthians 11 let a man examine himself

84
00:06:53,980 --> 00:07:00,420
this process of self-examination in fact Paul says not only the believers as he

85
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:04,540
writes that first epistle in 1st Corinthians chapter 11 but again in the

86
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:09,299
book of 2nd Corinthians he says examine yourselves and so this morning I've

87
00:07:09,299 --> 00:07:14,179
simply used that as our title examine yourselves notice what the Bible says

88
00:07:14,179 --> 00:07:19,459
Peter here in 1st Peter 1 in verse number 13 the Bible says this wherefore

89
00:07:19,459 --> 00:07:27,059
gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that

90
00:07:27,059 --> 00:07:32,380
is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ notice verse

91
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:40,179
14 as obedient children not fashioning yourselves according to the former lust

92
00:07:40,179 --> 00:07:51,299
in your ignorance but as he which hath called you is holy so be ye holy in all

93
00:07:51,299 --> 00:08:00,019
manner of conversation because it is written be holy for I am holy I'm so

94
00:08:00,019 --> 00:08:05,140
thankful that we serve a holy God in fact as we think about the holiness of

95
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:10,019
God on display throughout the scriptures we find that probably one of the great

96
00:08:10,179 --> 00:08:14,260
passages of scripture where you're confronted with the holiness of God is

97
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:19,100
when you see Isaiah in the sixth chapter in the year that King Uzziah died the

98
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:25,380
Bible tells us that Isaiah saw the Lord high holy and lifted up and his train

99
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:30,380
did fill the temple the Bible goes on to explain to us that vision of use of

100
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:34,940
Isaiah in Isaiah chapter number six where the Bible says that he sees the

101
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:42,979
angels and they're crying out holy holy holy our God is holy he says there to

102
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:46,780
the the children of Israel in the book of Leviticus and really this is a quote

103
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:53,179
from Leviticus you find that he says this truth of being holy because he is

104
00:08:53,179 --> 00:08:58,340
holy and as we begin to consider the passage of scripture begin to consider

105
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:02,500
the preparation if you will for revival and being in a place where we are

106
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:07,460
revival ready I believe that this process of self-examination is of great

107
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:13,260
importance I thought this week as I was preparing and I was meditating and just

108
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:17,500
musing upon the the subject matter that I believe the Lord led me to to preach

109
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:24,140
this morning I had recollection and some of you no doubt can understand the

110
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:29,940
pressures that an organization feels in the subsequent preparation that they go

111
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:35,419
through when they're facing an audit in fact there are times in which when I

112
00:09:35,419 --> 00:09:38,539
worked in the corporate world that when they would announce that there was an

113
00:09:38,539 --> 00:09:43,940
audit coming you kind of wish that you were on vacation that week because it's

114
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:49,059
something that was not always a pleasant experience there were a number of

115
00:09:49,059 --> 00:09:55,299
pressures that would be upon not only the management team but also upon the

116
00:09:55,299 --> 00:10:01,859
individuals within that organization you would find that all of a sudden

117
00:10:01,859 --> 00:10:04,019
then there'd be a certain amount of preparation

118
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:06,179
that the employees would go through

119
00:10:06,179 --> 00:10:10,439
in preparing for that audit.

120
00:10:10,439 --> 00:10:12,539
This morning, as I can recall,

121
00:10:12,539 --> 00:10:14,979
times in which I interacted with auditors

122
00:10:14,979 --> 00:10:16,859
over the years,

123
00:10:16,859 --> 00:10:19,259
I believe that there are valuable lessons

124
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:22,139
that we can learn from their work

125
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:24,419
that will be of assistance to us,

126
00:10:24,419 --> 00:10:26,539
to me, to you,

127
00:10:26,539 --> 00:10:28,499
as we consider the subject matter

128
00:10:28,499 --> 00:10:31,219
to examine ourselves.

129
00:10:31,219 --> 00:10:34,139
See, the reality this morning

130
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:36,419
is that for an organization

131
00:10:36,419 --> 00:10:39,699
that has properly fulfilled

132
00:10:39,699 --> 00:10:42,299
all of their responsibilities,

133
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:44,059
the announcement of an audit

134
00:10:44,059 --> 00:10:46,459
does not really bring that great

135
00:10:46,459 --> 00:10:48,219
of an amount of pressure.

136
00:10:48,219 --> 00:10:49,979
Why? Because you've already been doing

137
00:10:49,979 --> 00:10:52,339
what you're supposed to do.

138
00:10:52,339 --> 00:10:54,219
The problem is when you're not doing

139
00:10:54,219 --> 00:10:56,139
the things that you're supposed to do,

140
00:10:56,139 --> 00:10:58,699
when you're not following the protocols

141
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:00,059
and so on and so forth,

142
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:02,619
when you find out that there's an audit scheduled,

143
00:11:02,619 --> 00:11:07,139
there is a very high level of stress.

144
00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:08,339
And this morning,

145
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:11,219
for a company to go through a process

146
00:11:11,219 --> 00:11:13,699
of having an outside company come in

147
00:11:13,699 --> 00:11:15,299
and perform an audit,

148
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:18,179
if they have been going through

149
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:21,259
proper channels and proper processes

150
00:11:21,259 --> 00:11:23,979
as they go through their daily routine,

151
00:11:23,979 --> 00:11:26,179
they don't have to stress over it.

152
00:11:26,179 --> 00:11:27,619
And this morning, I tell you,

153
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:32,139
one day we're going to stand before God.

154
00:11:32,139 --> 00:11:34,859
We're going to stand before God.

155
00:11:34,859 --> 00:11:36,219
And the reality this morning

156
00:11:36,219 --> 00:11:39,779
is that I so much look forward to the day

157
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:43,299
that I will see my Savior face to face.

158
00:11:43,299 --> 00:11:45,659
But the very thought of standing before

159
00:11:45,659 --> 00:11:47,419
the Lord God Almighty

160
00:11:47,419 --> 00:11:49,019
at the bema seat of Christ,

161
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:51,459
the judgment seat of Christ,

162
00:11:51,459 --> 00:11:54,219
is something that as we would consider

163
00:11:54,219 --> 00:11:55,419
the subject matter,

164
00:11:55,419 --> 00:11:57,979
would lead us to this process

165
00:11:57,979 --> 00:12:00,419
of self-examination.

166
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:01,539
Why?

167
00:12:01,539 --> 00:12:04,179
Because if I just neglect this whole process,

168
00:12:04,179 --> 00:12:06,139
this whole discipline,

169
00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:08,059
then one day I'm going to stand before the Lord

170
00:12:08,059 --> 00:12:10,899
and I'm not going to quite be prepared.

171
00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:12,499
I don't know that any of us

172
00:12:12,499 --> 00:12:16,379
could be fully prepared.

173
00:12:16,379 --> 00:12:17,899
But the truth of God's Word

174
00:12:17,899 --> 00:12:20,339
with regard to examine yourselves

175
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:22,219
and self-examination

176
00:12:22,219 --> 00:12:24,499
will go a long way to help us

177
00:12:24,499 --> 00:12:26,259
to be in a place

178
00:12:26,259 --> 00:12:29,619
where we are ready for that day.

179
00:12:29,619 --> 00:12:31,379
Let me share a few thoughts with you.

180
00:12:31,379 --> 00:12:33,579
Number one, this morning if you're taking notes,

181
00:12:33,579 --> 00:12:35,659
and I'm going to use four R's

182
00:12:35,659 --> 00:12:37,219
to alliterate it this morning

183
00:12:37,219 --> 00:12:38,499
in this fashion.

184
00:12:38,499 --> 00:12:40,139
Number one is review.

185
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:41,339
What does the auditor do

186
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:42,499
as soon as they come in?

187
00:12:42,499 --> 00:12:44,859
They begin to take all of the documentation, right?

188
00:12:44,859 --> 00:12:46,459
They begin this thorough review.

189
00:12:46,459 --> 00:12:47,979
And so, as I begin to think about

190
00:12:47,979 --> 00:12:49,899
this process of examine yourselves,

191
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:51,299
this self-examination,

192
00:12:51,299 --> 00:12:53,699
this discipline that we're referring to this morning,

193
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:54,779
I say, well, first of all,

194
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:57,059
there has to be a review.

195
00:12:57,059 --> 00:12:59,619
That review, I say, how do we do it?

196
00:12:59,619 --> 00:13:00,699
Well, first of all,

197
00:13:00,699 --> 00:13:02,779
we must understand that it has to be

198
00:13:02,779 --> 00:13:06,379
an honest and a thorough review.

199
00:13:06,379 --> 00:13:08,299
It must be honest.

200
00:13:08,299 --> 00:13:09,819
It must be thorough.

201
00:13:09,819 --> 00:13:11,139
It must be a situation.

202
00:13:11,139 --> 00:13:12,419
Notice what Peter says here,

203
00:13:12,419 --> 00:13:13,899
and we'll reference this often

204
00:13:13,899 --> 00:13:15,579
throughout our message this morning,

205
00:13:15,579 --> 00:13:17,179
that in verse number 14 he says,

206
00:13:17,179 --> 00:13:19,579
as obedient children,

207
00:13:19,579 --> 00:13:21,219
in verse number 15 he says,

208
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:26,139
so be holy in all manner of conversation.

209
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:27,539
So there must be a review,

210
00:13:27,539 --> 00:13:29,379
and the review must be honest

211
00:13:29,379 --> 00:13:31,339
and it must be thorough.

212
00:13:31,339 --> 00:13:33,579
When I consider the review

213
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:36,139
and I consider how it is that we would review

214
00:13:36,139 --> 00:13:39,059
our own lives as we would examine ourselves,

215
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:41,219
I find this morning that the standard

216
00:13:41,219 --> 00:13:44,699
for the review must be the Word of God.

217
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:46,539
It is not valid that we would use

218
00:13:46,539 --> 00:13:48,699
somebody else's life as the standard

219
00:13:48,699 --> 00:13:50,899
by which we would examine ourselves.

220
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:52,939
No, it must be the Word of God.

221
00:13:52,939 --> 00:13:54,779
The prophet said that the Word of God

222
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:55,979
was like a plumb line,

223
00:13:55,979 --> 00:13:58,379
and that's how they were going to be judged.

224
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,339
And this morning as we would consider

225
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,179
the power of God's Word

226
00:14:02,179 --> 00:14:03,819
and the truth of God's Word,

227
00:14:03,819 --> 00:14:05,539
we find that it is this book

228
00:14:05,539 --> 00:14:06,899
that must be the standard

229
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:09,819
by which we examine ourselves.

230
00:14:09,819 --> 00:14:13,059
An auditor has a standard.

231
00:14:13,059 --> 00:14:15,139
They come in with some type of,

232
00:14:15,139 --> 00:14:16,979
if you're having a financial audit,

233
00:14:16,979 --> 00:14:19,939
they have certain protocols

234
00:14:19,939 --> 00:14:21,500
and certain standards by which

235
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,099
they're going to audit that company by.

236
00:14:24,099 --> 00:14:25,859
And this morning as God's people,

237
00:14:25,859 --> 00:14:28,979
I say this is the standard.

238
00:14:28,979 --> 00:14:30,579
The very Word of God.

239
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:32,500
As Baptist people, we have said for years,

240
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,699
in fact, for years,

241
00:14:33,699 --> 00:14:35,379
Baptist people have been referred to

242
00:14:35,379 --> 00:14:37,019
as people of the book.

243
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:39,019
By the way, that's a good terminology.

244
00:14:39,019 --> 00:14:40,019
Amen?

245
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:41,819
And we find that as Baptist people,

246
00:14:41,819 --> 00:14:43,699
we would say that the Bible

247
00:14:43,699 --> 00:14:48,500
is our sole authority for faith and practice.

248
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,659
This morning, the Word of God

249
00:14:49,699 --> 00:14:50,899
must be the standard by which

250
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:52,099
we examine ourselves.

251
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,859
Notice, if you want to take,

252
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:55,459
and we're going to look at a number of passages

253
00:14:55,459 --> 00:14:57,459
this morning, but look back a few pages

254
00:14:57,459 --> 00:15:00,259
in your Bible at James 1 if you will.

255
00:15:00,259 --> 00:15:02,979
In James 1, the Bible's referring to a verse

256
00:15:02,979 --> 00:15:05,339
that we often reference as verse 22

257
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:06,579
of being doers of the Word

258
00:15:06,579 --> 00:15:08,579
and not hearers, only deceiving your own selves.

259
00:15:08,579 --> 00:15:10,339
But I want you to focus and look

260
00:15:10,339 --> 00:15:12,459
at what the Bible says in verse 25.

261
00:15:12,459 --> 00:15:13,699
The Bible says this,

262
00:15:13,699 --> 00:15:19,939
but whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty.

263
00:15:19,939 --> 00:15:22,019
I'm thankful that God describes His Word

264
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:23,299
in that manner.

265
00:15:23,299 --> 00:15:25,299
It is the perfect law of liberty.

266
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,299
And the Bible says,

267
00:15:26,299 --> 00:15:29,139
whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty,

268
00:15:29,139 --> 00:15:30,139
notice what it says,

269
00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:33,859
and continueth therein.

270
00:15:33,859 --> 00:15:35,979
He being not a forgetful hearer,

271
00:15:35,979 --> 00:15:38,859
but a doer of the work,

272
00:15:38,859 --> 00:15:42,899
this man shall be blessed in his deed.

273
00:15:42,939 --> 00:15:44,779
We say that the Bible is our sole authority

274
00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:46,859
for faith, what we believe,

275
00:15:46,859 --> 00:15:49,659
and practice, the things that we do.

276
00:15:49,659 --> 00:15:51,419
And as we would go through the process

277
00:15:51,419 --> 00:15:52,979
of self-examination,

278
00:15:52,979 --> 00:15:54,259
we find that the Bible says,

279
00:15:54,259 --> 00:15:55,339
and you don't need to turn there,

280
00:15:55,339 --> 00:15:58,139
but Paul as he's writing to the believers in Ephesus,

281
00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:00,139
and he's speaking to them about their walk,

282
00:16:00,139 --> 00:16:02,099
and really in chapters 4 and 5,

283
00:16:02,099 --> 00:16:03,979
he references five different areas

284
00:16:03,979 --> 00:16:06,459
with regard to the walk of the believer.

285
00:16:06,459 --> 00:16:07,859
And he says this,

286
00:16:07,859 --> 00:16:11,939
proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.

287
00:16:11,939 --> 00:16:14,859
In Ephesians 5, in verse 10.

288
00:16:14,859 --> 00:16:18,419
This morning, the Word of God must be the standard.

289
00:16:18,419 --> 00:16:20,219
It absolutely must be the standard.

290
00:16:20,219 --> 00:16:21,579
So we understand how.

291
00:16:21,579 --> 00:16:22,539
It must be honest.

292
00:16:22,539 --> 00:16:24,419
It must be thorough.

293
00:16:24,419 --> 00:16:26,179
We understand that there's a standard,

294
00:16:26,179 --> 00:16:28,500
and for us this morning as the people of God,

295
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,579
that standard is the Word of God.

296
00:16:30,579 --> 00:16:34,259
By the way, I'm thankful that God's Word hasn't changed.

297
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:36,899
I'm thankful that we're not looking for a revision.

298
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:38,699
For an updated version.

299
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:41,619
I'm thankful that God is eternal,

300
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:43,739
and He has given us a book

301
00:16:43,739 --> 00:16:48,339
that is applicable and relevant today.

302
00:16:48,339 --> 00:16:49,179
So many people that say,

303
00:16:49,179 --> 00:16:50,459
oh, it's so old.

304
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:52,619
Yeah, but the author is eternal.

305
00:16:52,619 --> 00:16:53,779
Amen?

306
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:55,179
What a joy.

307
00:16:55,179 --> 00:16:57,699
It's the Word of God that's the standard.

308
00:16:57,699 --> 00:17:00,059
This morning we ask ourselves, why?

309
00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:01,419
Why do I go through this?

310
00:17:01,419 --> 00:17:03,459
Why do you think we should go through

311
00:17:03,459 --> 00:17:05,500
a process of examining ourselves?

312
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,979
Why do we have to have this discipline?

313
00:17:07,979 --> 00:17:09,819
Can I say to you very simply

314
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:12,619
that Paul says in Romans 14 and verse number 12,

315
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:15,459
so that every one of us

316
00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:19,539
shall give account of himself to God.

317
00:17:21,739 --> 00:17:24,059
What does a steward do?

318
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:26,739
He's responsible for the things

319
00:17:26,739 --> 00:17:27,939
that have been entrusted to him,

320
00:17:27,939 --> 00:17:31,500
but he also is called to give an account regularly.

321
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,779
Or at least he should be.

322
00:17:33,779 --> 00:17:35,099
We're stewards.

323
00:17:36,099 --> 00:17:40,059
And this morning, in Romans 14 and verse number 12,

324
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,419
as Paul is referencing,

325
00:17:41,419 --> 00:17:42,659
and there are a number of chapters

326
00:17:42,659 --> 00:17:44,139
and a number of references

327
00:17:44,139 --> 00:17:46,859
to the fact that we will give an account

328
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:48,099
and stand before the Lord,

329
00:17:48,099 --> 00:17:50,259
but I understand how Paul says it

330
00:17:50,259 --> 00:17:51,379
in this particular text,

331
00:17:51,379 --> 00:17:54,739
so then every one of us,

332
00:17:54,739 --> 00:17:56,099
if you're a believer this morning,

333
00:17:56,099 --> 00:17:58,139
if you've trusted the Lord Jesus Christ,

334
00:17:58,139 --> 00:17:59,739
you can rejoice in the fact

335
00:17:59,739 --> 00:18:02,539
that the second death has no power over you.

336
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:04,339
You can rejoice this morning

337
00:18:04,379 --> 00:18:05,619
that you will not stand

338
00:18:05,619 --> 00:18:07,339
at the great white throne judgment

339
00:18:07,339 --> 00:18:09,459
and what blessed truth that is.

340
00:18:09,459 --> 00:18:11,739
However, as a child of God,

341
00:18:11,739 --> 00:18:14,099
we will give an account

342
00:18:14,099 --> 00:18:19,099
and we give that account of himself to God.

343
00:18:19,339 --> 00:18:20,979
Wow.

344
00:18:20,979 --> 00:18:22,979
I hope this morning you see the seriousness

345
00:18:22,979 --> 00:18:24,179
of the subject matter.

346
00:18:25,259 --> 00:18:26,299
You understand this morning

347
00:18:26,299 --> 00:18:29,579
that you're not giving an account for someone else.

348
00:18:29,579 --> 00:18:31,459
I preached a message two Wednesday nights ago.

349
00:18:31,459 --> 00:18:33,979
Search me, oh God.

350
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:34,820
Why?

351
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,019
Because I'm not gonna stand

352
00:18:36,019 --> 00:18:37,619
and give an account for someone else.

353
00:18:37,619 --> 00:18:39,820
I'm standing and giving an account for myself.

354
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:42,940
Now as a pastor, I will give an account.

355
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:45,979
I'm told as one of my responsibilities in Hebrews

356
00:18:45,979 --> 00:18:48,500
that I watch for your souls.

357
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,659
And it's very interesting what the writer says

358
00:18:51,659 --> 00:18:55,140
there in Hebrews with regard to that subject matter.

359
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:58,940
The Bible says in Hebrews 13 and verse 17,

360
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,700
obey them that have the rule over you

361
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,899
and submit yourselves for they watch for your souls,

362
00:19:04,779 --> 00:19:08,140
notice this, as they must give account

363
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,500
that they may do it,

364
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:14,059
notice what it says, with joy and not with grief.

365
00:19:14,059 --> 00:19:15,500
But then it says this,

366
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,619
for that is unprofitable for you.

367
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:22,899
We understand the subject matter this morning

368
00:19:22,899 --> 00:19:24,500
dealing with the Bema Seat of Christ

369
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,459
and the examine ourselves

370
00:19:26,459 --> 00:19:29,619
because the reality is that every one of us

371
00:19:29,619 --> 00:19:33,659
shall give account of himself to God.

372
00:19:34,419 --> 00:19:35,940
That word shall, we like when it's in the context

373
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,179
of like Romans 10, 13,

374
00:19:37,179 --> 00:19:38,779
for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord

375
00:19:38,779 --> 00:19:41,619
shall be saved, we say praise the Lord.

376
00:19:41,619 --> 00:19:44,739
He shall come, we say praise the Lord.

377
00:19:44,739 --> 00:19:47,459
You shall give account.

378
00:19:47,459 --> 00:19:48,739
It's certain.

379
00:19:48,739 --> 00:19:50,459
I remember there were times,

380
00:19:50,459 --> 00:19:52,859
the very first audit that I remember

381
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:56,779
when I worked for Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation,

382
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:58,619
I had not been there very long

383
00:19:58,619 --> 00:20:00,380
and unfortunately there were some practices

384
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:01,659
that had taken place.

385
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:04,079
prior to my arrival that weren't really

386
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:06,139
within the way in which things

387
00:20:06,139 --> 00:20:07,579
were supposed to be conducted

388
00:20:07,579 --> 00:20:08,799
and so on and so forth.

389
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,139
And I remember having this thought

390
00:20:11,139 --> 00:20:12,979
and really everyone within our department

391
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:13,779
had the thought,

392
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:16,439
I hope they don't talk to me.

393
00:20:16,439 --> 00:20:18,559
I'm hoping that they just pass right past

394
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,679
where I am and they go to somebody else

395
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:22,379
to talk to that someone else

396
00:20:22,379 --> 00:20:24,259
can give an account.

397
00:20:24,259 --> 00:20:25,759
Can I tell you biblically speaking

398
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:26,879
the matter of the subject

399
00:20:26,879 --> 00:20:28,659
that's before us this morning?

400
00:20:28,659 --> 00:20:31,459
You're going to give an account.

401
00:20:31,459 --> 00:20:32,899
It's certain.

402
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:35,099
So therefore, we must go through

403
00:20:35,099 --> 00:20:36,859
this review process.

404
00:20:36,859 --> 00:20:38,339
It behooves us.

405
00:20:38,339 --> 00:20:40,459
It is advantageous for us.

406
00:20:40,459 --> 00:20:41,819
I think this way.

407
00:20:41,819 --> 00:20:44,419
My understanding of the truth

408
00:20:44,419 --> 00:20:48,539
leads me to this process.

409
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:52,299
We understand that truth impacts.

410
00:20:52,299 --> 00:20:53,099
Amen?

411
00:20:53,099 --> 00:20:54,779
I've often said over the years

412
00:20:54,779 --> 00:20:56,699
that truth, that belief,

413
00:20:56,699 --> 00:20:58,699
will impact our behavior.

414
00:20:58,699 --> 00:21:00,819
If I understand the truth

415
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:02,259
that is before us this morning

416
00:21:02,259 --> 00:21:03,699
and I understand the fact

417
00:21:03,699 --> 00:21:05,259
that I will stand before the Lord,

418
00:21:05,259 --> 00:21:06,779
then it leads me to this process

419
00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:08,419
that has an impact and effect

420
00:21:08,419 --> 00:21:11,259
upon my behavior.

421
00:21:11,259 --> 00:21:12,299
So number one, I review.

422
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:14,699
Number two, recognize.

423
00:21:14,699 --> 00:21:16,139
What do I mean by recognize?

424
00:21:16,139 --> 00:21:17,939
Well, the purpose of reviewing

425
00:21:17,939 --> 00:21:20,019
is so that we can properly identify

426
00:21:20,019 --> 00:21:23,419
areas that need to be addressed.

427
00:21:23,419 --> 00:21:25,259
Remember, we're doing a thorough

428
00:21:25,259 --> 00:21:26,859
and honest evaluation

429
00:21:26,859 --> 00:21:28,299
and a thorough and honest review.

430
00:21:28,299 --> 00:21:29,419
We're using the Word of God

431
00:21:29,419 --> 00:21:30,419
as our standard.

432
00:21:30,459 --> 00:21:31,859
And we understand that,

433
00:21:31,859 --> 00:21:33,099
as we've mentioned already

434
00:21:33,099 --> 00:21:34,059
on two occasions,

435
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:36,019
that in 1 Peter 1 and verse 15,

436
00:21:36,019 --> 00:21:36,459
he says,

437
00:21:36,459 --> 00:21:37,899
So be ye holy.

438
00:21:37,899 --> 00:21:39,259
Notice the phrase,

439
00:21:39,259 --> 00:21:41,979
in all manner of conversation.

440
00:21:41,979 --> 00:21:44,579
I had a Bible college professor

441
00:21:44,579 --> 00:21:46,699
that was a real sharp fella.

442
00:21:46,699 --> 00:21:48,299
And he said, listen, fellas,

443
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:49,219
all means all.

444
00:21:49,219 --> 00:21:51,299
And that's all that all means.

445
00:21:51,299 --> 00:21:53,819
And he would say that regularly.

446
00:21:53,819 --> 00:21:55,419
And the reality is that

447
00:21:55,419 --> 00:21:56,779
when we look at the passage

448
00:21:56,779 --> 00:21:57,499
of Scripture, he says,

449
00:21:57,499 --> 00:21:59,859
all manner of conversation,

450
00:21:59,939 --> 00:22:01,059
the whole of it,

451
00:22:01,059 --> 00:22:03,299
every aspect of it,

452
00:22:03,299 --> 00:22:04,339
and what is it?

453
00:22:04,339 --> 00:22:05,659
The manner of conversation.

454
00:22:05,659 --> 00:22:06,819
That's our manner of life.

455
00:22:06,819 --> 00:22:07,979
That's our conduct.

456
00:22:07,979 --> 00:22:10,459
That's our behavior.

457
00:22:10,459 --> 00:22:12,579
And so begin to boil down

458
00:22:12,579 --> 00:22:14,299
and look at what God is saying.

459
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:15,899
And we understand that He says

460
00:22:15,899 --> 00:22:16,939
that we're to be holy

461
00:22:16,939 --> 00:22:19,139
in all manner of conversation.

462
00:22:19,139 --> 00:22:20,939
Now, we understand this morning

463
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:23,979
that Peter is writing to believers.

464
00:22:23,979 --> 00:22:25,059
He's writing to people

465
00:22:25,059 --> 00:22:26,699
that are saved.

466
00:22:26,699 --> 00:22:27,699
They've been justified.

467
00:22:27,739 --> 00:22:30,019
He tells to those believers

468
00:22:30,019 --> 00:22:31,659
in chapter 1 and verse 5

469
00:22:31,659 --> 00:22:35,779
that they are kept by the power of God.

470
00:22:35,779 --> 00:22:37,539
That they have a treasure,

471
00:22:37,539 --> 00:22:40,059
an inheritance that's incorruptible,

472
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:40,979
that's undefiled,

473
00:22:40,979 --> 00:22:42,619
that's fadeth not away,

474
00:22:42,619 --> 00:22:44,259
that's reserved in heaven for them.

475
00:22:44,259 --> 00:22:46,939
I mean, he's writing to believers.

476
00:22:46,939 --> 00:22:47,859
But he says, listen,

477
00:22:47,859 --> 00:22:48,899
you're to be holy

478
00:22:48,899 --> 00:22:51,579
in all manner of conversation.

479
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:52,779
Can I tell you this morning

480
00:22:52,779 --> 00:22:55,539
that God cares how we live?

481
00:22:55,539 --> 00:22:57,299
He does.

482
00:22:57,299 --> 00:22:58,579
Paul says this to the believers

483
00:22:58,579 --> 00:23:01,139
in Thessalonica in 1 Thessalonians 4

484
00:23:01,139 --> 00:23:05,019
that you know how you ought to behave.

485
00:23:05,019 --> 00:23:07,139
That you know how you ought to walk.

486
00:23:07,139 --> 00:23:08,739
I believe that's exactly how he says it there

487
00:23:08,739 --> 00:23:10,699
in 1 Thessalonians 4.

488
00:23:10,699 --> 00:23:14,419
That you know how you ought to walk.

489
00:23:14,419 --> 00:23:16,939
Again, we don't walk in a certain way

490
00:23:16,939 --> 00:23:19,299
so that we can keep our salvation.

491
00:23:19,299 --> 00:23:21,139
We don't walk, live in a certain way

492
00:23:21,139 --> 00:23:23,859
so that we can earn our salvation.

493
00:23:23,859 --> 00:23:26,299
That was settled on the cross of Calvary.

494
00:23:26,299 --> 00:23:28,619
Jesus Christ said it is finished.

495
00:23:28,619 --> 00:23:30,619
He was buried and He rose in victory

496
00:23:30,619 --> 00:23:32,739
conquering sin, death, and the grave.

497
00:23:32,739 --> 00:23:36,619
But He is concerned about how we live our lives.

498
00:23:36,619 --> 00:23:37,579
Listen, this morning,

499
00:23:37,579 --> 00:23:39,339
there is not a sacred part of you

500
00:23:39,339 --> 00:23:41,419
and a secular part of you.

501
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:43,259
All of you has been redeemed

502
00:23:43,259 --> 00:23:45,419
by the blood of Christ.

503
00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:47,899
Aren't you thankful for that by the way?

504
00:23:47,899 --> 00:23:49,699
And he says that we're to be holy

505
00:23:49,699 --> 00:23:53,139
in all manner of conversation.

506
00:23:53,139 --> 00:23:54,339
It's not a situation where you say,

507
00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:56,379
I'm in this place now

508
00:23:56,379 --> 00:23:58,139
and so I can behave this way.

509
00:23:58,139 --> 00:23:59,659
I'm over here in this place

510
00:23:59,659 --> 00:24:01,019
around these people and I behave this way.

511
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:01,859
No, no, no.

512
00:24:01,859 --> 00:24:05,899
We're to be holy in all manner of conversation.

513
00:24:05,899 --> 00:24:07,699
Now, admittedly this morning,

514
00:24:07,699 --> 00:24:09,979
there's no way I could exhaust a list

515
00:24:09,979 --> 00:24:12,179
of all manner of conversation.

516
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:14,699
But I'm gonna try to help us this morning

517
00:24:14,699 --> 00:24:18,779
to pinpoint a few areas that ought to be reviewed,

518
00:24:18,779 --> 00:24:20,739
that ought to be considered.

519
00:24:20,739 --> 00:24:22,579
Now, listen, let me tell you this

520
00:24:22,579 --> 00:24:24,299
before I even get into the verses.

521
00:24:25,059 --> 00:24:26,539
God already stepped on my toes.

522
00:24:28,179 --> 00:24:31,259
I anticipate that He's gonna step on my toes again

523
00:24:31,259 --> 00:24:33,539
as I deliver it to you this morning.

524
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:37,339
Don't get mad when God steps on your toes.

525
00:24:37,339 --> 00:24:38,419
It's a good thing.

526
00:24:40,299 --> 00:24:42,379
Because He's confronting us

527
00:24:42,379 --> 00:24:43,419
and He's helping us to live.

528
00:24:43,419 --> 00:24:45,459
Listen, I'm saying this morning

529
00:24:45,459 --> 00:24:46,659
that the standard is the Word of God.

530
00:24:46,659 --> 00:24:49,259
I'm gonna show you what God's Word says.

531
00:24:50,259 --> 00:24:52,499
I cannot give you an exhaustive list

532
00:24:52,539 --> 00:24:54,579
of what all manner of conversation is.

533
00:24:54,579 --> 00:24:56,539
We'd be here forever trying to go through

534
00:24:56,539 --> 00:24:59,219
every little detail of our lives.

535
00:24:59,219 --> 00:25:00,779
But let me give you a sampling.

536
00:25:02,579 --> 00:25:06,139
We think about this truth that I am bought with a price.

537
00:25:06,139 --> 00:25:09,459
Remember, Paul says it this way in 1 Corinthians 6.

538
00:25:09,459 --> 00:25:10,459
What?

539
00:25:10,459 --> 00:25:12,179
No ye not?

540
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:15,259
I mean, he's going to these believers

541
00:25:15,259 --> 00:25:17,259
in the book of 1 Corinthians

542
00:25:17,259 --> 00:25:19,459
with regard to all of their carnality

543
00:25:19,459 --> 00:25:21,099
and all of the things that are going on.

544
00:25:21,099 --> 00:25:21,939
And he says, what?

545
00:25:21,939 --> 00:25:24,939
No ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost

546
00:25:24,939 --> 00:25:26,499
which is in you, which you have of God.

547
00:25:26,499 --> 00:25:28,099
You're not your own.

548
00:25:28,099 --> 00:25:29,619
You're bought with a price.

549
00:25:29,619 --> 00:25:32,099
Therefore, glorify God in your body

550
00:25:32,099 --> 00:25:35,259
and in your spirit, which are God's.

551
00:25:35,259 --> 00:25:38,619
Let me just point out a few things this morning.

552
00:25:38,619 --> 00:25:41,379
When we think about this recognition,

553
00:25:41,379 --> 00:25:43,299
we've reviewed and we recognize,

554
00:25:43,299 --> 00:25:45,379
well, what is it, preacher, that I should review?

555
00:25:45,379 --> 00:25:48,059
Number one, we should review what I read.

556
00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:49,699
What I read.

557
00:25:49,699 --> 00:25:50,619
What am I reading?

558
00:25:51,699 --> 00:25:53,859
What am I putting into my mind?

559
00:25:53,859 --> 00:25:56,939
The first three that I have in my notes this morning,

560
00:25:56,939 --> 00:26:00,699
what I read, what I watch, and what I listen to.

561
00:26:01,539 --> 00:26:05,299
The reason why I have those three in my list this morning

562
00:26:05,299 --> 00:26:06,619
that I believe the Lord led me

563
00:26:06,619 --> 00:26:09,019
to those three things to begin with

564
00:26:09,019 --> 00:26:11,819
is because we must recognize this morning

565
00:26:11,819 --> 00:26:15,179
how those three things affect my thoughts.

566
00:26:16,179 --> 00:26:21,179
What I read, what I watch, and what I listen to.

567
00:26:23,259 --> 00:26:26,019
The reality this morning is that

568
00:26:26,019 --> 00:26:28,699
when we begin to use the Word of God

569
00:26:28,699 --> 00:26:31,139
and we think about what He tells us

570
00:26:31,139 --> 00:26:32,739
with regard to our thought life

571
00:26:32,739 --> 00:26:35,779
and we understand how that these three areas

572
00:26:35,779 --> 00:26:38,099
will impact my thinking,

573
00:26:38,099 --> 00:26:40,979
we find that Paul says this to the believers in Philippi

574
00:26:40,979 --> 00:26:42,659
in Philippians 4 and verse number eight,

575
00:26:42,899 --> 00:26:45,619
finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true,

576
00:26:45,619 --> 00:26:46,979
whatsoever things are honest,

577
00:26:46,979 --> 00:26:48,499
whatsoever things are just,

578
00:26:48,499 --> 00:26:49,739
whatsoever things are pure,

579
00:26:49,739 --> 00:26:50,859
whatsoever things are lovely,

580
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:52,259
whatsoever things are of good report,

581
00:26:52,259 --> 00:26:54,419
if there be any virtue and if there be any praise,

582
00:26:54,419 --> 00:26:57,859
think on these things.

583
00:26:57,859 --> 00:26:59,619
In 2 Corinthians 10 and verse number five,

584
00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:01,899
he says that we're to bring into captivity

585
00:27:01,899 --> 00:27:05,459
every thought to the obedience of Christ.

586
00:27:06,379 --> 00:27:09,579
How's my thought life being impacted by what I'm reading?

587
00:27:09,579 --> 00:27:12,539
How's my thought life being impacted by what I'm watching?

588
00:27:13,419 --> 00:27:14,259
The psalmist said,

589
00:27:14,259 --> 00:27:15,899
I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes.

590
00:27:15,899 --> 00:27:17,779
How's my thought life being impacted

591
00:27:17,779 --> 00:27:19,539
by the things I listen to?

592
00:27:19,539 --> 00:27:20,659
You ever been in a situation

593
00:27:20,659 --> 00:27:21,739
where you get into somebody's car

594
00:27:21,739 --> 00:27:23,699
and they turn off the music real quick?

595
00:27:25,859 --> 00:27:28,259
They must have some level of understanding

596
00:27:28,259 --> 00:27:29,859
that what they had been listening to

597
00:27:29,859 --> 00:27:32,059
probably isn't good for your presence.

598
00:27:32,059 --> 00:27:34,019
What about God's presence?

599
00:27:35,379 --> 00:27:38,819
I'm thankful this morning that our God is omnipotent.

600
00:27:38,819 --> 00:27:40,019
He has all power.

601
00:27:40,019 --> 00:27:42,059
I'm thankful this morning that our God is omniscient,

602
00:27:42,059 --> 00:27:43,579
that He knows all things.

603
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:45,979
And I'm thankful this morning that our God is omnipresent,

604
00:27:45,979 --> 00:27:47,699
that He is everywhere present.

605
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:51,939
And that truth of God's omnipresence is a comforting truth.

606
00:27:51,939 --> 00:27:53,939
I will never leave thee nor forsake thee.

607
00:27:53,939 --> 00:27:55,819
I am with thee.

608
00:27:55,819 --> 00:27:57,619
It's also a convicting truth.

609
00:27:57,619 --> 00:27:59,259
He's always with us.

610
00:28:01,259 --> 00:28:02,539
If it wouldn't be appropriate

611
00:28:02,539 --> 00:28:05,139
if God were sitting next to you physically, bodily

612
00:28:05,139 --> 00:28:08,099
to hear, read, or watch something,

613
00:28:08,099 --> 00:28:10,019
then you ought not be doing it.

614
00:28:10,019 --> 00:28:11,499
Amen?

615
00:28:11,539 --> 00:28:13,379
It's very simple.

616
00:28:13,379 --> 00:28:14,419
What does the Word of God say?

617
00:28:14,419 --> 00:28:18,499
How do those things impact my thoughts?

618
00:28:18,499 --> 00:28:20,779
Am I bringing every thought into captivity?

619
00:28:20,779 --> 00:28:24,099
Am I able to have that honest and thorough evaluation

620
00:28:24,099 --> 00:28:25,659
and say, hey, look, this thing right here

621
00:28:25,659 --> 00:28:26,739
I shouldn't be listening to.

622
00:28:26,739 --> 00:28:28,579
This thing right here I shouldn't be reading.

623
00:28:28,579 --> 00:28:30,819
This thing right here I shouldn't be watching.

624
00:28:30,819 --> 00:28:31,659
Why?

625
00:28:31,659 --> 00:28:34,500
Because it doesn't pass the test of Philippians 4.8.

626
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:37,179
If you're taking notes,

627
00:28:37,179 --> 00:28:39,419
not only would I read, watch, and listen to,

628
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:41,259
I want you to consider your speech.

629
00:28:42,139 --> 00:28:44,379
I said this on Wednesday night a couple of weeks ago

630
00:28:44,379 --> 00:28:45,819
when I talked about search me, oh God,

631
00:28:45,819 --> 00:28:49,459
and I mentioned that often we kind of look at it

632
00:28:49,459 --> 00:28:50,779
from this lens.

633
00:28:50,779 --> 00:28:53,579
We begin to think about our standing before God.

634
00:28:53,579 --> 00:28:54,979
Well, I'm not a murderer.

635
00:28:54,979 --> 00:28:57,979
I'm not a, and we start naming these big things

636
00:28:57,979 --> 00:28:59,619
that we're not.

637
00:28:59,619 --> 00:29:01,139
I said this on that Wednesday night.

638
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:02,500
I'm glad that you're not.

639
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,339
Amen?

640
00:29:03,339 --> 00:29:05,019
I'm glad you've not murdered anyone.

641
00:29:05,019 --> 00:29:06,379
I mean, that's a blessing.

642
00:29:06,379 --> 00:29:08,579
I'd have to visit you in prison, you know?

643
00:29:08,579 --> 00:29:11,500
But the reality is that when you look at the walk

644
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,219
when God deals with it,

645
00:29:13,219 --> 00:29:16,139
when he deals with it with the believers in Ephesus,

646
00:29:16,139 --> 00:29:20,379
he doesn't say, don't kill anybody.

647
00:29:20,379 --> 00:29:22,579
He says, speak the truth.

648
00:29:24,219 --> 00:29:25,500
Stop lying.

649
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,500
That's what he says.

650
00:29:27,659 --> 00:29:29,819
And we think about our speech,

651
00:29:29,819 --> 00:29:31,699
and the first aspect that I think about

652
00:29:31,699 --> 00:29:35,139
is that of speaking the truth in Ephesians 4 in verse 15,

653
00:29:35,139 --> 00:29:36,579
but speaking the truth in love

654
00:29:36,579 --> 00:29:38,379
may grow up into him in all things

655
00:29:39,059 --> 00:29:40,139
which is the head, even Christ.

656
00:29:40,139 --> 00:29:42,219
You know, we live in a place, we live in a time,

657
00:29:42,219 --> 00:29:44,299
we live in an era where unfortunately,

658
00:29:44,299 --> 00:29:46,779
speaking the truth does not have the value

659
00:29:46,779 --> 00:29:47,940
that it once had.

660
00:29:51,219 --> 00:29:53,579
But as God's people, we're to speak the truth.

661
00:29:54,539 --> 00:29:56,779
He says later in this same chapter

662
00:29:56,779 --> 00:30:00,619
in Ephesians 4, and as you go through the passage

663
00:30:00,619 --> 00:30:01,459
and you look,

664
00:30:01,459 --> 00:30:02,919
He says in verse number 25,

665
00:30:02,919 --> 00:30:05,119
"'Wherefore, putting away lying,

666
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:07,499
speak every man truth with his neighbor,

667
00:30:07,499 --> 00:30:10,299
for we are members one of another.'"

668
00:30:10,299 --> 00:30:12,919
We're to speak the truth.

669
00:30:12,919 --> 00:30:15,619
Not being a gossip.

670
00:30:15,619 --> 00:30:17,879
It's kind of funny how gossip works within church.

671
00:30:17,879 --> 00:30:20,219
It's typically, it works kind of this way.

672
00:30:20,219 --> 00:30:22,979
I have a prayer request for you.

673
00:30:22,979 --> 00:30:25,699
And all we really want to do is gossip about something.

674
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:27,679
And we kind of put the facade on

675
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:28,979
that it's a prayer request.

676
00:30:28,979 --> 00:30:32,759
We don't spiritualize it.

677
00:30:32,759 --> 00:30:35,539
Now, it might be a legitimate prayer request

678
00:30:35,539 --> 00:30:37,079
that may not be gossip,

679
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:40,019
but we've got to be careful.

680
00:30:40,019 --> 00:30:43,879
What about the situation where we gossip

681
00:30:43,879 --> 00:30:45,959
because we think, oh man, this thing happened

682
00:30:45,959 --> 00:30:47,119
and somebody needs to know about it.

683
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:48,239
Maybe we don't say it's a prayer request,

684
00:30:48,239 --> 00:30:50,239
but we just feel like we've got to point out

685
00:30:50,239 --> 00:30:54,279
somebody else's issue.

686
00:30:54,279 --> 00:30:56,639
I think about the fact that we're to

687
00:30:56,639 --> 00:30:57,679
praise God.

688
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:58,879
My speech.

689
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:04,059
Is my speech characterized by complaining

690
00:31:04,059 --> 00:31:05,579
and murmuring?

691
00:31:05,579 --> 00:31:08,899
Or is it characterized of praising and thanking?

692
00:31:08,899 --> 00:31:10,659
You know what Paul says in the book of Philippians?

693
00:31:10,659 --> 00:31:12,939
If you want to turn over there to the book of Philippians

694
00:31:12,939 --> 00:31:15,019
in chapter 2.

695
00:31:15,019 --> 00:31:16,579
It's a really interesting verse.

696
00:31:16,579 --> 00:31:19,579
We so often talk about the truth of

697
00:31:19,579 --> 00:31:21,259
in everything give thanks.

698
00:31:21,259 --> 00:31:22,299
And those are great verses.

699
00:31:22,299 --> 00:31:23,819
Those are very appropriate.

700
00:31:23,819 --> 00:31:24,899
And they speak to our heart.

701
00:31:24,899 --> 00:31:27,379
And they give us the fact that in everything

702
00:31:27,379 --> 00:31:28,059
we're to give thanks.

703
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:30,319
This is the will of God in Christ Jesus

704
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:31,279
concerning you.

705
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:32,679
But I want you to notice how Paul says

706
00:31:32,679 --> 00:31:33,679
of the believers in Philippi.

707
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:35,079
In chapter number 2 of Philippians

708
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:36,399
in verse number 14.

709
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:37,439
He says this.

710
00:31:37,439 --> 00:31:42,319
Do all things without murmurings

711
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:44,279
and disputings.

712
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:46,799
I've often told you that I like the word murmur

713
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:48,719
probably more than I like the word complain

714
00:31:48,719 --> 00:31:52,159
because murmur just sounds bad.

715
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:53,599
Often in the Old Testament

716
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:56,399
they were guilty of murmuring.

717
00:31:56,419 --> 00:31:58,219
You find that the word is used often

718
00:31:58,219 --> 00:31:58,939
in the Old Testament.

719
00:31:58,939 --> 00:32:01,139
You find that they were murmuring in their tents.

720
00:32:01,139 --> 00:32:01,979
That's their homes.

721
00:32:01,979 --> 00:32:02,939
That's where they lived.

722
00:32:02,939 --> 00:32:05,579
You think about the influence upon their children

723
00:32:05,579 --> 00:32:06,659
in the next generation

724
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:09,599
because all they heard was murmur and murmur.

725
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:12,179
We hate this bread.

726
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:14,739
They murmured all the time.

727
00:32:14,739 --> 00:32:18,139
See, Paul says do all things.

728
00:32:18,139 --> 00:32:21,019
Okay, that's pretty inclusive, is it not?

729
00:32:21,019 --> 00:32:22,699
I mean everything, right?

730
00:32:22,719 --> 00:32:29,719
I mean all things without murmurings and disputings.

731
00:32:29,719 --> 00:32:34,019
How is my speech characterized?

732
00:32:34,019 --> 00:32:36,599
I think about the way in which our speech

733
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:40,359
could be used to sow discord.

734
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:42,999
The Bible speaks about unity in the church of God

735
00:32:42,999 --> 00:32:45,039
and I'm so thankful that we can have unity

736
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:48,379
because we embrace the same truth.

737
00:32:48,379 --> 00:32:49,759
Paul said to the believers in Ephesus

738
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:51,959
that we're endeavoring to keep the unity

739
00:32:51,979 --> 00:32:54,699
of the Spirit and the bond of peace.

740
00:32:54,699 --> 00:32:56,259
But it's interesting as you would think about

741
00:32:56,259 --> 00:32:58,659
the subject matter of sowing discord.

742
00:32:58,659 --> 00:33:01,339
God says in Proverbs 6,

743
00:33:01,339 --> 00:33:04,379
how we can sow discord is absolutely with our mouth,

744
00:33:04,379 --> 00:33:05,659
with our speech,

745
00:33:05,659 --> 00:33:08,699
and it says that God hates it.

746
00:33:08,699 --> 00:33:10,339
He hates it.

747
00:33:10,339 --> 00:33:12,299
That's serious language.

748
00:33:12,299 --> 00:33:15,939
Yea, these six things that the Lord hate,

749
00:33:15,939 --> 00:33:18,419
yea, seven is an abomination.

750
00:33:18,419 --> 00:33:20,739
Proverbs 6, verse 14,

751
00:33:20,739 --> 00:33:22,559
and then you look at verses 16 through 19.

752
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:24,159
We don't have time to go there this morning.

753
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:26,719
It is interesting that speaking the truth

754
00:33:26,719 --> 00:33:29,599
also is in that same text of scripture.

755
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:30,579
He hates lying.

756
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:34,839
By the way, it's part of the Ten Commandments.

757
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:35,839
We speak the truth.

758
00:33:36,999 --> 00:33:39,399
So again, we kind of go through this process

759
00:33:39,399 --> 00:33:40,879
saying well I'm not really that bad

760
00:33:40,879 --> 00:33:42,519
because I haven't done all these things,

761
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:44,279
but really when we think about the people of God

762
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:47,119
and we think about all manner of conversation being holy,

763
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:49,279
he's not just concerned about these big areas,

764
00:33:49,299 --> 00:33:51,779
he's concerned about every area.

765
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:54,019
Notice with me, not only my speech,

766
00:33:54,019 --> 00:33:56,239
but I think about my associations.

767
00:33:57,239 --> 00:33:58,139
My associations.

768
00:33:58,139 --> 00:33:59,059
Notice what Paul says.

769
00:33:59,059 --> 00:34:00,619
Turn to the book of 2 Corinthians, if you will,

770
00:34:00,619 --> 00:34:01,979
in chapter number six.

771
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:04,419
It's interesting because really

772
00:34:04,419 --> 00:34:05,739
in this same passage of scripture

773
00:34:05,739 --> 00:34:07,979
in 2 Corinthians 6, 14 through chapter seven

774
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:09,299
in verse number one,

775
00:34:09,299 --> 00:34:11,539
you can see really the entirety of the message

776
00:34:11,539 --> 00:34:13,059
that we're preaching this morning

777
00:34:13,059 --> 00:34:14,939
with regard to this process.

778
00:34:14,939 --> 00:34:15,779
Number one, review.

779
00:34:15,779 --> 00:34:17,319
Number two, recognize.

780
00:34:17,319 --> 00:34:19,059
Notice what he says in verse number 14

781
00:34:19,879 --> 00:34:20,699
of 2 Corinthians 6.

782
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:23,279
Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers.

783
00:34:23,279 --> 00:34:25,879
For what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness?

784
00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:27,999
What communion hath light with darkness?

785
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:30,559
What concord hath Christ with Belial?

786
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:34,079
Or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?

787
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:35,719
These questions are posed this way

788
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:39,499
to help the believer understand there's no union.

789
00:34:39,499 --> 00:34:42,759
There's no association that should be made.

790
00:34:42,759 --> 00:34:44,119
And he says this in verse 16.

791
00:34:44,119 --> 00:34:46,999
What agreement hath the temple of God with idols?

792
00:34:47,939 --> 00:34:50,339
For ye are the temple of the living God.

793
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:52,459
As God hath said, I will dwell in them and walk in them

794
00:34:52,459 --> 00:34:54,379
and I will be their God and they shall be my people.

795
00:34:54,379 --> 00:34:57,539
Wherefore, based upon this principle, what are you to do?

796
00:34:57,539 --> 00:35:00,699
Come out from among them and be ye separate,

797
00:35:00,699 --> 00:35:01,899
saith the Lord.

798
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:03,899
He then gives these wonderful promises.

799
00:35:03,899 --> 00:35:05,739
He says this, and touch not the unclean thing

800
00:35:05,739 --> 00:35:08,939
and I will receive you and will be a father unto you

801
00:35:08,939 --> 00:35:10,459
and you shall be my sons and daughters,

802
00:35:10,459 --> 00:35:11,699
saith the Lord Almighty.

803
00:35:11,699 --> 00:35:13,739
You understand that at the end of verse number 17

804
00:35:13,739 --> 00:35:16,619
in verse 18, again, Paul's writing to the church

805
00:35:16,959 --> 00:35:19,119
in Corinth, he's writing to believers there in Corinth,

806
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:21,199
and what he's saying to them is not that you're gonna be

807
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:24,879
saved, it's that you're gonna have that fellowship.

808
00:35:24,879 --> 00:35:26,559
Because you've done these things,

809
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:27,879
you've come out from among them

810
00:35:27,879 --> 00:35:28,879
and you've been ye separate.

811
00:35:28,879 --> 00:35:31,679
Listen, when I'm living a life of sin,

812
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:33,239
when I'm allowing sin in my life

813
00:35:33,239 --> 00:35:35,319
and I'm not examining, I'm not dealing with it,

814
00:35:35,319 --> 00:35:38,879
my fellowship with my God is hindered.

815
00:35:38,879 --> 00:35:40,559
He's still my God.

816
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:42,399
I'm thankful for that.

817
00:35:42,399 --> 00:35:46,819
He's still my Savior, but my fellowship is hindered.

818
00:35:46,819 --> 00:35:51,819
We find that he says that these associations are important

819
00:35:53,419 --> 00:35:56,659
and we're not to be, be ye not unequally yoked

820
00:35:56,659 --> 00:36:00,059
together with unbelievers, and he goes through the list.

821
00:36:00,059 --> 00:36:01,819
I think about what I read, what I watch,

822
00:36:01,819 --> 00:36:04,459
what I listen to, my speech, my associations.

823
00:36:04,459 --> 00:36:07,219
I would say this, what about my attire?

824
00:36:07,219 --> 00:36:08,899
It's kind of interesting because so often

825
00:36:08,899 --> 00:36:12,439
it's a subject matter that people don't like to deal with.

826
00:36:12,439 --> 00:36:13,599
But you know something that's interesting,

827
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:14,599
I was thinking about it this week

828
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:16,899
and I actually heard somebody on American Family Radio

829
00:36:16,899 --> 00:36:19,079
deal with it, and it was quite interesting

830
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:21,119
how they dealt with it, and they even addressed it

831
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:23,759
in the same manner, that for some reason

832
00:36:23,759 --> 00:36:26,679
in our churches today, we don't like to talk about attire.

833
00:36:26,679 --> 00:36:28,919
But you know, every company I ever worked with

834
00:36:28,919 --> 00:36:32,039
or worked for had a dress code.

835
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:32,939
Every single one.

836
00:36:34,039 --> 00:36:36,799
Every school that I went to had a dress code.

837
00:36:36,799 --> 00:36:39,979
Now they varied, admittedly.

838
00:36:39,979 --> 00:36:42,499
Something that's a super interesting study,

839
00:36:43,379 --> 00:36:45,299
and I say that it's a super interesting study

840
00:36:45,299 --> 00:36:47,419
from my perspective, you might have no interest

841
00:36:47,419 --> 00:36:49,779
in it whatsoever, you might think it's just dumb,

842
00:36:49,779 --> 00:36:51,579
and that's fine, you can have your opinion,

843
00:36:51,579 --> 00:36:53,299
I'm entitled to my opinion.

844
00:36:53,299 --> 00:36:56,499
But a fascinating study to me was when I went to England

845
00:36:56,499 --> 00:36:59,539
when my brother lived there a couple of years ago,

846
00:36:59,539 --> 00:37:01,099
he was there for three years and we had the privilege

847
00:37:01,099 --> 00:37:03,639
of going and visiting, it was an interesting,

848
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:05,179
fascinating study to study some things

849
00:37:05,279 --> 00:37:06,479
about the royal family.

850
00:37:07,759 --> 00:37:09,839
And you know the royal family has an extremely

851
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:11,219
detailed dress code.

852
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:13,419
I mean, big time.

853
00:37:14,259 --> 00:37:16,079
Go look it up, it's fascinating.

854
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:19,579
And it's not just for females, it's for males as well.

855
00:37:19,579 --> 00:37:21,079
I mean, you're part of the royal family.

856
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:23,099
There's a certain expectation.

857
00:37:23,099 --> 00:37:24,599
Can I tell you this morning that you're part

858
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:27,059
of a greater royal family?

859
00:37:27,059 --> 00:37:30,099
Here's what Peter says, we're in 1 Peter chapter number one

860
00:37:30,099 --> 00:37:32,079
for our text of scripture this morning,

861
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:34,679
but I want you to understand that Peter will go on to say

862
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:36,899
in chapter number two in verse number nine,

863
00:37:36,899 --> 00:37:41,199
but ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood,

864
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:43,539
and a holy nation, a peculiar people that you should

865
00:37:43,539 --> 00:37:46,119
show forth the praises of him who hath called you

866
00:37:46,119 --> 00:37:48,619
out of darkness into his marvelous light.

867
00:37:48,619 --> 00:37:50,699
What a joy to understand.

868
00:37:50,699 --> 00:37:53,659
I think about the Old Testament example in 2 Samuel

869
00:37:53,659 --> 00:37:57,239
where David said I want to show the kindness of the Lord.

870
00:37:57,239 --> 00:37:59,939
Are there any left of the house of Jonathan?

871
00:37:59,939 --> 00:38:01,979
And there was one Mephibosheth, but he was down

872
00:38:01,979 --> 00:38:03,799
in Lodabar and he says bring him to me.

873
00:38:03,819 --> 00:38:07,699
I'm gonna make him as one of the king's sons.

874
00:38:07,699 --> 00:38:09,079
If you've been saved this morning,

875
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:12,759
you are adopted by the king of kings and lord of lords.

876
00:38:12,759 --> 00:38:16,219
Our father is the god of the universe

877
00:38:16,219 --> 00:38:19,779
and we are his children and we are part of a royal family.

878
00:38:19,779 --> 00:38:22,139
And can I tell you that the Bible deals with attire.

879
00:38:22,139 --> 00:38:23,619
The Bible addresses it.

880
00:38:23,619 --> 00:38:26,279
Notice with me in 1 Timothy chapter number one,

881
00:38:26,279 --> 00:38:28,799
notice what Paul is telling Timothy here

882
00:38:28,799 --> 00:38:31,159
in the passage of scripture and he's dealing with things

883
00:38:31,159 --> 00:38:35,399
with regard to the church and all that's going on there.

884
00:38:35,399 --> 00:38:37,479
I said chapter number one, sorry, chapter number two.

885
00:38:37,479 --> 00:38:39,439
And I want you to notice in chapter number two

886
00:38:39,439 --> 00:38:43,079
in verses nine and 10, notice what he says.

887
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:46,099
In like manner also that women adorn themselves

888
00:38:46,099 --> 00:38:49,939
in modest apparel with shamefacedness and sobriety,

889
00:38:49,939 --> 00:38:52,739
not with braided hair or gold or pearls or costly array,

890
00:38:52,739 --> 00:38:56,539
but which becometh women professing godliness

891
00:38:56,539 --> 00:38:58,219
with good works.

892
00:38:58,219 --> 00:39:00,019
I understand that the era in which we live in

893
00:39:00,019 --> 00:39:03,039
is a different era than when the Bible was written.

894
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:04,219
It's very interesting, by the way,

895
00:39:04,219 --> 00:39:05,659
if you read in the book of Proverbs

896
00:39:05,659 --> 00:39:07,499
and really look at the Old Testament,

897
00:39:07,499 --> 00:39:09,419
in Proverbs chapter number seven in particular,

898
00:39:09,419 --> 00:39:12,579
it talks about the attire of an harlot.

899
00:39:12,579 --> 00:39:14,539
Won't deal with that whole subject matter this morning,

900
00:39:14,539 --> 00:39:18,059
but the reality is that their attire was sending a message.

901
00:39:18,959 --> 00:39:21,819
And this morning, we have two daughters and I have a wife,

902
00:39:21,819 --> 00:39:24,259
praise the Lord, and I got a son

903
00:39:24,259 --> 00:39:25,779
and I'm thankful for all of them.

904
00:39:25,779 --> 00:39:27,819
But I've said to my girls often,

905
00:39:27,819 --> 00:39:29,979
listen, the subject matter of modesty

906
00:39:29,979 --> 00:39:32,019
is an important subject matter.

907
00:39:32,019 --> 00:39:34,219
And I understand that as teenage girls,

908
00:39:34,219 --> 00:39:36,219
you wanna, and I've said this to them,

909
00:39:36,219 --> 00:39:38,779
you wanna be cute, you wanna wear something that's cute,

910
00:39:38,779 --> 00:39:42,739
but you cannot, you cannot, you must not

911
00:39:42,739 --> 00:39:45,659
sacrifice modesty for cuteness.

912
00:39:47,779 --> 00:39:49,939
It's just not appropriate.

913
00:39:49,939 --> 00:39:52,699
And so therefore, we find that as we would go through

914
00:39:52,699 --> 00:39:54,979
this evaluation, we're reviewing,

915
00:39:54,979 --> 00:39:56,459
we're saying all manner of conversation,

916
00:39:56,459 --> 00:39:58,019
I wanna recognize some things.

917
00:39:58,019 --> 00:40:01,019
And so I think about my attire, I think about my finances.

918
00:40:01,019 --> 00:40:03,679
I heard a preacher just last week, I was at a preacher's meeting,

919
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:08,439
he said this, give me your checkbook and I'll tell you what's important to you.

920
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:13,199
I think about finances. God's Word says a lot about finances, by the way.

921
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:21,239
You know, in Malachi, they were receiving rebuke because they were robbing God.

922
00:40:21,239 --> 00:40:24,499
How are we robbing God? In tithes and offerings.

923
00:40:24,499 --> 00:40:27,039
God goes on to say, prove me.

924
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:29,719
Luke says, give and it shall be given.

925
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:31,759
And he goes through that whole process.

926
00:40:31,759 --> 00:40:34,919
Listen, we don't give so that we can get something from God.

927
00:40:34,919 --> 00:40:39,639
We give because we recognize all of it already belongs to God.

928
00:40:39,639 --> 00:40:41,639
And He's been so very good to us.

929
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:43,839
And what a privilege to be able to give back to Him.

930
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:47,899
I think about what Jesus said in Matthew chapter number 6.

931
00:40:47,899 --> 00:40:54,399
In Matthew chapter number 6, verses 20 and 21, Jesus says this.

932
00:40:54,399 --> 00:40:58,119
I'll read verse number 19 along with it.

933
00:40:58,139 --> 00:41:02,679
In Matthew 6, verses 19 through 21.

934
00:41:02,679 --> 00:41:06,819
Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt,

935
00:41:06,819 --> 00:41:11,319
and where thieves break through and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven,

936
00:41:11,319 --> 00:41:15,499
where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal.

937
00:41:15,499 --> 00:41:21,659
For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.

938
00:41:21,659 --> 00:41:25,039
I want God to evaluate my finances.

939
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:28,159
I think about this, my prayer life.

940
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:31,259
The sin of prayerlessness.

941
00:41:31,259 --> 00:41:33,199
The fact of the matter is that Samuel says this.

942
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:36,879
You don't need to turn there, but it's a powerful statement that Samuel makes.

943
00:41:36,879 --> 00:41:40,119
Of course, he's grieved in his heart because the nation wants a king.

944
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:42,559
And he goes through that whole process and God gives him instruction.

945
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:45,719
Of course, we understand that Saul is anointed to be the first king of Israel.

946
00:41:45,719 --> 00:41:48,839
But Samuel says this in 1 Samuel 12, in verse number 23.

947
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:52,839
Moreover, ask for me, God forbid, that I should sin against the Lord in ceasing to

948
00:41:52,839 --> 00:41:55,759
pray for you.

949
00:41:55,759 --> 00:41:56,759
The sin of prayerlessness.

950
00:41:56,759 --> 00:41:57,759
We're busy.

951
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:58,759
We don't have time.

952
00:41:58,759 --> 00:42:03,439
How's my prayer life?

953
00:42:03,439 --> 00:42:07,679
See I want to be able to recognize these things as I review and I'm recognizing, okay, God,

954
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:08,679
I need some work there.

955
00:42:08,679 --> 00:42:09,679
Okay, God, I need some work here.

956
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:11,399
Okay, God, there's a problem here.

957
00:42:11,399 --> 00:42:12,399
There's a problem there.

958
00:42:12,399 --> 00:42:15,199
I want to be able to recognize those problems.

959
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:19,679
I think about my being engaged in sharing my faith.

960
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:21,879
God says that we are ambassadors.

961
00:42:21,879 --> 00:42:24,039
We are his representatives.

962
00:42:24,039 --> 00:42:27,439
God says that we're to go and preach the gospel to every creature.

963
00:42:27,439 --> 00:42:30,879
I don't know how you feel right now, but I know I feel, I shared with somebody on the

964
00:42:30,879 --> 00:42:37,039
phone last night, I feel so twisted up inside that I can't go freely knock on somebody's

965
00:42:37,039 --> 00:42:40,199
door and share the gospel with them.

966
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:45,039
Because we're living during a time where people, I don't think, are very kind towards me knocking

967
00:42:45,039 --> 00:42:48,719
on their door with all of the current pandemic and everything that's going on.

968
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:52,559
And we're trying to be aware of those things and be wise with regard to those things.

969
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:56,319
But man, I love being able to engage people and speaking with them about the gospel.

970
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:59,119
Admittedly, I don't do it as often as I should.

971
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:03,839
But can I tell you when something's removed from us, it gives us that much of a greater

972
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:07,599
appreciation and longing for it.

973
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:10,119
How's my witnessing?

974
00:43:10,119 --> 00:43:15,399
I really think this, when I consider all of these things, and again, it's not an exhaustive

975
00:43:15,399 --> 00:43:16,399
list.

976
00:43:16,399 --> 00:43:18,719
You can add plenty of things to it.

977
00:43:18,719 --> 00:43:20,959
But really, I boil down the principle to being this.

978
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:24,559
It's a principle that you find in Ephesians 4 and also in Colossians 3.

979
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:29,499
And it's this principle, put off, put on.

980
00:43:29,499 --> 00:43:30,839
Because of who I am.

981
00:43:30,839 --> 00:43:32,399
Because I've been redeemed.

982
00:43:32,399 --> 00:43:35,039
Because I'm adopted into the family of God.

983
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:36,919
Because I am part of his family.

984
00:43:36,919 --> 00:43:38,119
I am his child.

985
00:43:38,119 --> 00:43:42,879
Here's some things I'm going to, this is how I'm going to behave, be holy in all manner

986
00:43:42,879 --> 00:43:43,879
of conversation.

987
00:43:43,879 --> 00:43:49,239
So as we go through our process, we have reviewed, we've recognized, okay, here's some things

988
00:43:49,239 --> 00:43:50,519
I need to deal with.

989
00:43:50,519 --> 00:43:53,359
And we come to number three, resolve.

990
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:54,359
Resolve it.

991
00:43:54,359 --> 00:43:55,839
I mean, deal with it.

992
00:43:55,839 --> 00:44:00,599
The reality is that we don't identify it just so that we can say, yeah, there's a problem

993
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:01,599
there.

994
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:04,919
We identify it so that we can resolve it.

995
00:44:04,919 --> 00:44:08,279
One thing that I said often when I worked in the corporate world, and it carries right

996
00:44:08,279 --> 00:44:13,479
over into the church work, is that there are a lot of problem identifiers and very few

997
00:44:13,479 --> 00:44:15,479
problem solvers.

998
00:44:15,479 --> 00:44:17,399
Amen?

999
00:44:17,399 --> 00:44:20,339
I mean, you find it all over the world.

1000
00:44:20,339 --> 00:44:24,759
This morning, I made a commitment when I worked in the corporate world that I might not have

1001
00:44:24,759 --> 00:44:29,499
the right answer to the problem, but I would never take a problem to my boss without also

1002
00:44:29,499 --> 00:44:31,319
taking a solution.

1003
00:44:31,319 --> 00:44:33,359
It may not be the solution that they take.

1004
00:44:33,799 --> 00:44:37,759
It might be dumb, but I'm going to try my best to come up with a solution.

1005
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:38,759
Why?

1006
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:41,479
Because I didn't want to just be a problem identifier.

1007
00:44:41,479 --> 00:44:46,519
So this morning, if I go through this process of self-examination, if I'm reviewing, if

1008
00:44:46,519 --> 00:44:50,719
I'm recognizing some areas now, I need to resolve those things.

1009
00:44:50,719 --> 00:44:53,199
I need to deal with it.

1010
00:44:53,199 --> 00:44:58,399
God in His grace and His mercy has allowed it to be exposed, has allowed it to be revealed.

1011
00:44:58,399 --> 00:44:59,399
Why?

1012
00:44:59,399 --> 00:45:01,959
So that I would deal with it.

1013
00:45:01,959 --> 00:45:04,599
It's a reference back to what we said in the very beginning of the message with regard

1014
00:45:04,599 --> 00:45:07,879
to the revivals in Judah.

1015
00:45:07,879 --> 00:45:12,159
They heard the word of the Lord, and Josiah responded, he said, there's some things we

1016
00:45:12,159 --> 00:45:13,159
need to change.

1017
00:45:13,159 --> 00:45:17,039
Jehoshaphat said, there's some things that need to be cleansed, there's some things that

1018
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:18,759
need to be done.

1019
00:45:18,759 --> 00:45:23,199
And this morning, I say, I want to resolve the issues.

1020
00:45:23,199 --> 00:45:25,839
I want to confess and forsake.

1021
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:27,759
I think about a great example.

1022
00:45:27,759 --> 00:45:31,039
Come to the book of Acts in chapter 19, if you will.

1023
00:45:31,039 --> 00:45:37,199
Here in Acts chapter 19, really what we're seeing is the revival in Ephesus.

1024
00:45:37,199 --> 00:45:42,399
I mean, it's a powerful passage of Scripture, but I want you to see and consider with me

1025
00:45:42,399 --> 00:45:48,119
this morning the example of this church, and I want you to see how they resolved the issues,

1026
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:53,239
how the word of the Lord went forth, and how they responded as they were able to identify

1027
00:45:53,239 --> 00:45:55,639
some things that needed to be addressed.

1028
00:45:55,639 --> 00:45:59,199
Verse number 17 in Acts 19, the Bible says, and this was known to all the Jews and Greeks

1029
00:45:59,199 --> 00:46:01,479
also dwelling at Ephesus.

1030
00:46:01,479 --> 00:46:07,319
And fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified, and many that

1031
00:46:07,319 --> 00:46:11,199
believed came and confessed and showed their deeds.

1032
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:16,639
Notice verse 19, many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together.

1033
00:46:16,639 --> 00:46:17,839
What did they do?

1034
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:23,239
And burned them before all men.

1035
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:27,519
They counted the price of them and found it 15,000 pieces of silver.

1036
00:46:27,519 --> 00:46:30,279
And look at the result of what happened.

1037
00:46:30,279 --> 00:46:34,959
So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.

1038
00:46:34,959 --> 00:46:38,179
I'm thankful they resolved the issues.

1039
00:46:38,179 --> 00:46:41,519
That they didn't just have their toes stepped on and say, well, that's okay, that's just

1040
00:46:41,519 --> 00:46:42,839
what the preacher thinks.

1041
00:46:42,839 --> 00:46:46,239
That's just Paul getting on his little thing and whatever, we'll just keep on going along.

1042
00:46:46,239 --> 00:46:50,759
Well, then the word of God's not going to grow and multiply and prevail.

1043
00:46:50,759 --> 00:46:55,039
Because God, listen, I believe that God wants to send revival, but the question is are we

1044
00:46:55,039 --> 00:46:57,079
revival ready?

1045
00:46:57,079 --> 00:46:59,399
The question is, is there anything?

1046
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:01,159
There's nothing between my soul and my Savior's.

1047
00:47:01,159 --> 00:47:06,439
There's something that I know that God has confronted me about from His word, and I say,

1048
00:47:06,439 --> 00:47:07,439
yeah, I'm not going to deal with that.

1049
00:47:07,439 --> 00:47:10,759
I like that more than this, and whatever the situation is, no.

1050
00:47:10,759 --> 00:47:11,759
We say, I surrender.

1051
00:47:11,759 --> 00:47:12,759
I'm giving it all to God.

1052
00:47:12,759 --> 00:47:16,759
I want God's favor and God's blessing.

1053
00:47:16,759 --> 00:47:23,319
Nothing, nothing is worth forfeiting His blessing and His favor.

1054
00:47:23,319 --> 00:47:25,119
Nothing is worth it.

1055
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:29,599
And this morning, I see that the Bible says that they burned them before all men.

1056
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:31,199
I remember when my dad got saved.

1057
00:47:31,199 --> 00:47:34,399
Now young people in here, you're probably not going to remember cassette tapes, but

1058
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:36,399
y'all older folks, you remember cassette tapes.

1059
00:47:36,399 --> 00:47:37,399
You remember A-tracks.

1060
00:47:37,399 --> 00:47:38,759
I don't even remember those things.

1061
00:47:38,759 --> 00:47:39,759
And then records.

1062
00:47:39,759 --> 00:47:40,959
I remember the first time Breonna saw a record.

1063
00:47:40,959 --> 00:47:42,439
She said, what in the world is that?

1064
00:47:42,439 --> 00:47:44,479
I said, you play music on that thing.

1065
00:47:44,479 --> 00:47:45,999
And she's like, really?

1066
00:47:46,239 --> 00:47:52,559
I said, it's like a big CD, but it holds only a fraction of what a CD holds, you know?

1067
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:56,959
But the reality is, I remember when my dad got saved, and I remember he had a bunch of

1068
00:47:56,959 --> 00:48:04,639
tapes of music that somehow, through the preaching of the Word of God and the Spirit of God,

1069
00:48:04,639 --> 00:48:08,039
convicting him that that music wasn't appropriate for a believer.

1070
00:48:08,039 --> 00:48:09,039
Am I right?

1071
00:48:09,039 --> 00:48:10,039
Okay.

1072
00:48:10,039 --> 00:48:12,079
I remember what he did.

1073
00:48:12,159 --> 00:48:16,159
He took all those cassette tapes, and he didn't take them down to somewhere and sell them

1074
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:20,599
and try to get money for them, though he could have.

1075
00:48:20,599 --> 00:48:22,799
But what he thought was that it's not right for me.

1076
00:48:22,799 --> 00:48:28,039
I don't want to give that to somebody else, even if I'm going to profit from it.

1077
00:48:28,039 --> 00:48:31,559
I remember him taking those cassette tapes, and young people, you've got to realize how

1078
00:48:31,559 --> 00:48:35,399
that all that stuff would come out of the cassette tape, right?

1079
00:48:35,399 --> 00:48:36,879
It was always a mess, man.

1080
00:48:36,879 --> 00:48:39,559
You try to get pencils and fix it and what have you.

1081
00:48:39,559 --> 00:48:42,519
But he took all those things, and I remember him tearing them all up and throwing them

1082
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:43,519
in the garbage.

1083
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:48,519
He didn't burn them, but he disposed of them.

1084
00:48:48,519 --> 00:48:52,439
And he disposed of them in such a way that even if he had second thoughts later and said,

1085
00:48:52,439 --> 00:48:55,919
well, I really like that one song, I think I'm going to go back and get it, he's going

1086
00:48:55,919 --> 00:49:00,079
to have to pay money to buy it again, amen, because he destroyed it.

1087
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:04,119
And I'm saying to you that when I look at what happened here in Ephesus, this is a proper

1088
00:49:04,119 --> 00:49:05,119
response.

1089
00:49:05,719 --> 00:49:11,399
They said, we don't want to just have the issue identified, we want to resolve it.

1090
00:49:11,399 --> 00:49:15,119
We don't want to just recognize it, we want to deal with it.

1091
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:20,559
I think about what we read in 2 Corinthians 6, we read the latter part of the chapter,

1092
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:25,999
but in chapter number 7 and verse number 1, the Bible says this, Paul's instruction to

1093
00:49:25,999 --> 00:49:32,439
the believers in Corinth was simply this, cleanse yourselves from all filthiness of

1094
00:49:32,439 --> 00:49:36,279
the flesh and spirit.

1095
00:49:36,279 --> 00:49:39,799
I'm thankful for the ministry of the Word of God.

1096
00:49:39,799 --> 00:49:43,879
Paul deals with it in the book of Ephesians, how that we are cleansed.

1097
00:49:43,879 --> 00:49:48,879
Notice in Ephesians 5 and verse 26, that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing

1098
00:49:48,879 --> 00:49:51,679
of water by the Word.

1099
00:49:51,679 --> 00:50:00,679
See, I believe that when we resolve the issue, that we also need to put in some protections.

1100
00:50:00,679 --> 00:50:01,179
We need to make...

1101
00:50:01,179 --> 00:50:07,619
ourselves accountable. I think of a company that has an audit. The auditor

1102
00:50:07,619 --> 00:50:11,099
comes in, the auditor reviews, the auditor recognizes some areas that have

1103
00:50:11,099 --> 00:50:14,499
problems, and the auditor says, hey these things need to be resolved, and by the

1104
00:50:14,499 --> 00:50:21,739
way, you need to put some things in place to prevent this from happening again. And

1105
00:50:21,739 --> 00:50:25,339
so for us as God's people, when we're gonna resolve something, I believe that

1106
00:50:25,339 --> 00:50:29,919
there is an important aspect of accountability and establishing some

1107
00:50:29,919 --> 00:50:36,079
protections in our life, in our lives. This morning we go through the process

1108
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:41,519
of examine yourselves, this process of self-examination. We review, we recognize,

1109
00:50:41,519 --> 00:50:45,999
we resolve, and I want you to consider with me the result this this morning, the

1110
00:50:45,999 --> 00:50:51,039
result of going through this process. The Bible tells us, as I mentioned already in

1111
00:50:51,039 --> 00:50:56,559
Romans chapter 14 and verse number 12, so then every one of us shall give account

1112
00:50:56,559 --> 00:51:02,039
of himself to God. In my mind this morning, and I hope that you can follow

1113
00:51:02,039 --> 00:51:09,839
my logic, that we come full circle. As to the why of the review, we come full circle

1114
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:15,439
back to the result of the process, is that now God's people can be properly

1115
00:51:15,439 --> 00:51:22,519
prepared to give an account. I think it's advantageous that someone would care

1116
00:51:22,519 --> 00:51:28,479
enough, that God would care enough to give us in his Word the truth that we

1117
00:51:28,479 --> 00:51:33,879
will stand before him, but also the manner in which we can be prepared to

1118
00:51:33,879 --> 00:51:38,719
stand before him. Admittedly, I don't know that any of us would say, I'm fully

1119
00:51:38,719 --> 00:51:44,719
prepared, I'm gonna, I'm ready to do it right now, because it's a fearful thing.

1120
00:51:44,719 --> 00:51:49,599
But this morning, I want you to consider, we don't have time, we're out of time

1121
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:53,839
this morning, but I want you to consider something that God tells us in his Word

1122
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:58,959
here in Ephesians 5. We read about the cleansing in verse number 26, in verse

1123
00:51:58,959 --> 00:52:01,999
number 27 he says that he might present it to himself, he's speaking about the

1124
00:52:01,999 --> 00:52:07,319
church, a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but

1125
00:52:07,319 --> 00:52:12,119
that it should be holy and without blemish. We read the same truth in the

1126
00:52:12,119 --> 00:52:17,839
book of Colossians, we reference James 1 as being the fact that we're to use the

1127
00:52:18,239 --> 00:52:24,879
Word of God as the standard by which we do the review, the process by which we

1128
00:52:24,879 --> 00:52:29,599
review our lives, the standard must be the Word of God. But a couple of verses

1129
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:33,759
later in the book of James in the first chapter, in verse number 27, it says pure

1130
00:52:33,759 --> 00:52:38,239
religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, to visit the

1131
00:52:38,239 --> 00:52:42,839
fatherless and widows in their affliction and to keep himself unspotted

1132
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:49,319
from the world. John says in first John 2, love not the world, neither the things

1133
00:52:49,319 --> 00:52:53,519
that are in the world. I think about this and we'll close here, turn to the book of

1134
00:52:53,519 --> 00:53:02,599
Revelation if you will, in chapter number 19. At the end of chapter 19, really I'll

1135
00:53:02,599 --> 00:53:06,519
say the middle portion of chapter 19, is you see the return of Christ, the advent

1136
00:53:06,519 --> 00:53:12,839
of Christ, when he comes back with us, with his bride. See in Revelation

1137
00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:15,959
chapter number 4, you see the picture of the rapture where the church is caught

1138
00:53:15,959 --> 00:53:20,519
up and you find the tribulation period recorded and revealed in those next

1139
00:53:20,519 --> 00:53:23,839
several chapters throughout the book of Revelation and all of the judgments that

1140
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:27,479
are poured out. You come to chapter 19 and there's a reference that we're

1141
00:53:27,479 --> 00:53:31,919
going to deal with with regard to the marriage supper of the Lamb and then you

1142
00:53:31,919 --> 00:53:35,999
look at the advent of Christ, that he comes back not as the Lamb of God but as

1143
00:53:35,999 --> 00:53:41,439
the Lion of the tribe of Judah and he comes back and we come with them and of

1144
00:53:41,439 --> 00:53:45,359
course we understand that he's going to establish his millennial reign and what

1145
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:49,439
a joy that is, but I want you to focus just for a moment this morning on this

1146
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:55,479
truth with regard to the marriage supper of the Lamb. In verse number

1147
00:53:55,479 --> 00:53:59,959
seven, now you understand biblically speaking that God refers to himself as

1148
00:53:59,959 --> 00:54:03,399
the Bridegroom, the Lord Jesus Christ is the Bridegroom and the church is the

1149
00:54:03,399 --> 00:54:08,079
Bride. We just looked at that just a moment ago in Ephesians 5 and we see

1150
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:12,239
that that example, that relationship is referenced many times

1151
00:54:12,239 --> 00:54:16,119
throughout the scriptures and now we come to Revelation 19 in verse number

1152
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:21,659
7 and the Bible says, let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the

1153
00:54:21,659 --> 00:54:27,399
marriage of the Lamb is come. It's going to happen one day, we don't know when

1154
00:54:27,399 --> 00:54:30,759
it's going to happen but we know it's going to happen, but I want you to notice

1155
00:54:30,759 --> 00:54:35,879
the latter part of the verse. The Bible says, and his wife, who's his wife? It's the

1156
00:54:35,879 --> 00:54:44,759
church, the church is the Bride. His wife hath made herself ready. Now we

1157
00:54:44,759 --> 00:54:49,639
understand marriages here upon our earth and we understand the process in which

1158
00:54:49,639 --> 00:54:53,599
goes through for a marriage ceremony and we understand the preparation of the

1159
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:58,359
bride for the wedding ceremony. I've never gone through the preparation but

1160
00:54:58,359 --> 00:55:00,639
there are plenty of times that I've been at weddings when you're kind of waiting

1161
00:55:00,639 --> 00:55:03,679
around and saying, I wonder if this thing is going to happen or not. She's almost

1162
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:07,519
ready, you know, this kind of message gets sent back and what have you. She's

1163
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:13,519
preparing herself, she's readying herself for the ceremony. I wonder this morning

1164
00:55:13,519 --> 00:55:18,959
how the Bride of Christ, the church, the church is made up of believers,

1165
00:55:18,959 --> 00:55:23,119
individual believers, how are we preparing ourselves, how are we readying

1166
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:28,239
ourselves for that marriage supper of the Lamb? I believe this morning that we

1167
00:55:28,239 --> 00:55:33,159
must examine ourselves. We must go through this process. I have to go

1168
00:55:33,159 --> 00:55:38,199
through this process. I am sharing with you this morning my heart because I want

1169
00:55:38,199 --> 00:55:41,679
you to go through this process because the reality is you're gonna stand before

1170
00:55:41,679 --> 00:55:50,999
Christ one day. And I wonder this morning, as John says in first John, he talks

1171
00:55:50,999 --> 00:55:58,119
about the fact that we have this confidence that he is going to appear, we

1172
00:55:58,119 --> 00:56:02,439
know that he's going to appear, but he mentions how that there could be some

1173
00:56:02,439 --> 00:56:08,039
that could be ashamed before him it is coming. And then of course he talks about

1174
00:56:08,039 --> 00:56:12,039
in chapter 3 and verse number 3, and every man that hath this hope, what hope?

1175
00:56:12,039 --> 00:56:17,419
The fact that he's going to come. We have that hope in us, we purify himself even

1176
00:56:17,419 --> 00:56:23,299
as he is pure. Peter said this in first Peter, that we're to be obedient children,

1177
00:56:23,299 --> 00:56:28,179
not fashioning ourselves according to our former lust, but he says that we're

1178
00:56:28,179 --> 00:56:34,899
to be holy in all manner of conversation. God's concerned how we live our lives,

1179
00:56:34,899 --> 00:56:40,739
and because we've been redeemed, because we've been bought with the precious

1180
00:56:40,739 --> 00:56:46,819
blood of Christ, we have instruction on how we're to behave, how we're to walk, in

1181
00:56:46,819 --> 00:56:52,699
this morning, I want to encourage you, examine yourself. I want to encourage

1182
00:56:52,699 --> 00:56:57,619
myself, examine ourselves. I want you to know I'm not preaching this message to

1183
00:56:57,619 --> 00:57:02,939
you, I'm preaching this message for all of us. God's already stepped on my toes,

1184
00:57:02,939 --> 00:57:09,739
and I hope this morning that God, the Holy Spirit, would use his word to really

1185
00:57:09,739 --> 00:57:15,739
help us come to that quiet place and say, Lord, I need to examine myself. And it

1186
00:57:15,739 --> 00:57:20,779
needs to be honest, and it needs to be thorough, and the standard by which I

1187
00:57:20,779 --> 00:57:27,539
review and examine my life has got to be your word. And God, as I go through this

1188
00:57:27,539 --> 00:57:33,019
process, I want to recognize the areas of deficiency, the areas of sin in my life,

1189
00:57:33,019 --> 00:57:37,179
the areas of things that need to be changed, and God, I'm gonna resolve those

1190
00:57:37,179 --> 00:57:43,019
things with your help, by your grace, so that the result is that I can be

1191
00:57:43,019 --> 00:57:48,659
prepared to give an account. Because as Paul said to the believers in Rome, we're

1192
00:57:48,659 --> 00:57:55,939
going to give an account of himself to God. Let's pray. Father, we love you, we

1193
00:57:55,939 --> 00:58:02,219
thank you for loving us. God, I thank you for your word this morning and the truth

1194
00:58:02,219 --> 00:58:09,299
contained therein. Lord, I pray that the Holy Spirit of God would speak to hearts

1195
00:58:09,299 --> 00:58:17,099
through your precious word. Help us this morning, God, to be doers of the word.

1196
00:58:17,099 --> 00:58:27,819
Help us, God, to be thankful that your word confronts us. I pray that we would

1197
00:58:27,819 --> 00:58:36,459
respond properly. Help me, Lord. Help each one that's present this morning. We want

1198
00:58:36,459 --> 00:58:44,019
to be revival ready. More than that, I understand this morning, one day I'll

1199
00:58:44,019 --> 00:58:52,859
stand before you. God, I want to be prepared for that day. And I trust that

1200
00:58:52,859 --> 00:58:58,819
each one that's present this morning has the same heart attitude. We pray that

1201
00:58:58,819 --> 00:59:03,259
you'd have your will in way, that you'd work as only you can. It's in Christ's name we

1202
00:59:03,259 --> 00:59:06,979
pray. Would you stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed. I'm not going to go

1203
00:59:06,979 --> 00:59:10,339
through a series of questions this morning. I'm just going to ask you to say

1204
00:59:10,339 --> 00:59:16,059
yes to God. Just respond. Julianna is going to play quietly on the piano. As

1205
00:59:16,059 --> 00:59:24,499
she does, the altar's open. Make your seat an altar. Let God have his way in your

1206
00:59:24,499 --> 00:59:29,139
heart and life as Julianna plays.
