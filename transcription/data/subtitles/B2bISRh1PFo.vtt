WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.360
one and very thankful for the opportunity to be gathered together in

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.439
the Lord's house this morning. Thankful for the blessings already and what

00:00:09.439 --> 00:00:14.159
wonderful songs that we have the privilege of singing this morning.

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:21.639
Oh Lord send a revival and the songwriter said let it begin in me and

00:00:21.639 --> 00:00:26.819
what a wonderful prayer that is and then we sing that wonderful hymn nothing

00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:32.139
between. I hope that this morning you can say that there's nothing between my

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:38.939
soul and my Savior and I'm so thankful that we have a God who is gracious and

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:43.139
merciful and as it's said in the Old Testament on more than one occasion that

00:00:43.139 --> 00:00:49.099
there is that he is ready to pardon and ready to forgive that with thee there is

00:00:49.099 --> 00:00:54.659
forgiveness. John said it this way if any if we confess our sins that he is

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:59.659
faithful and just to forgive us and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness and

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:04.900
what a blessed truth and so thankful for the Word of God and that God has

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:10.660
allowed us to have the Bible. Of course Brother Mershawn was scheduled to

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.599
preach this morning and this evening and throughout the week as well and I am

00:01:15.599 --> 00:01:20.139
thankful that I normally don't have an opportunity to preach during a revival

00:01:20.139 --> 00:01:25.540
meeting and I typically have the opportunity ahead of in preparation of a

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.860
revival meeting preaching a series of messages on preparation for revival and

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.419
then possibly after revival meeting preaching and so I'm thankful this

00:01:34.419 --> 00:01:38.580
morning for the opportunity and I really saw the face of the Lord with regard to

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.379
the passage to preach and what have you just trusted to be a blessing to you

00:01:43.379 --> 00:01:47.459
this morning. I mentioned already after our first song that we have that

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:52.860
question are we revival ready or are we revival resistant. Unfortunately there

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.860
are some folks that are just kind of like in that mindset of just leave me

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.940
alone I'm okay with how things are I'm kind of status quo I'm not interested in

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.620
getting my toes stepped on I don't want preaching that's gonna sit in my lap so

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.980
on and so forth and there are others that say I want to be revival ready I

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:14.419
want God to work in my heart in my life I understand that when the Word of God

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:19.339
is preached and the Holy Spirit of God uses the Word of God to convict me that

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:24.699
that's a good thing amen and I'm so thankful for the ministry of God's Word

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:30.179
that it has the ability to at the very same time not only convict me but

00:02:30.179 --> 00:02:35.059
comfort me and it's an amazing truth that we see within the Word of God and

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:39.860
this morning as I think about revival and I think about the the truth of

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.740
revival and the opportunity to study historically revivals that you can read

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.419
in in the history of not only our nation but other nations that experienced

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:52.820
revival if you go back to the Old Testament and you read about some of the

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:58.500
revivals during the Judah's history Israel the ten tribes of the north they

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.539
never really after the divided kingdom there is no real record of any revival

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:08.220
they had bad wicked Kings and idolatry really was was rampant there and so on

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.059
and so forth but there in Judah every once in a while you'd see where a king

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:16.500
comes along that was a good king that believed in the power of the Word of God

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.259
and was open to the message of the prophets and you would see revival and

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:25.339
something that's interesting and really if you think about my mind this morning

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:29.580
specifically thinking about the time of Jehoshaphat and his reign and some of

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.539
the revival that took place during his reign you can think of Josiah as well

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:39.899
and something that you see consistent is not only the preaching of the Word of

00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:44.899
God in fact during Josiah's time you see that they were cleaning out the temple

00:03:44.899 --> 00:03:50.179
and they found the Word of the Lord and they read it and of course the response

00:03:50.179 --> 00:03:54.940
to the to the reading of the Word of God and we see that something that is

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.820
consistent we think about revival is this subject of cleansing this this

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:04.539
truth you see within the scriptures of the Old Testament during the period of

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:10.860
those revivals how that the the temple needed to be cleansed why because it had

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.699
been polluted and you would see that there were times in which there were

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:20.500
some some wicked Kings and there was idolatrous worship that was taking place

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.660
and the the temple was polluted and you'd find that one of the very first

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.940
things that would happen is a cleansing of the temple and it reminds me as we

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.980
would think about the truth of that in the Old Testament we think about the

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.540
ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ and you understand that on two occasions

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.339
once in the beginning of his ministry and once right near the end of his

00:04:42.339 --> 00:04:47.700
ministry publicly speaking during that period of time you find that Jesus went

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:52.420
to the temple and he cleansed the temple once in the beginning of his ministry

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:57.459
once at the end of his ministry we find that for New Testament believers this

00:04:57.459 --> 00:05:02.540
morning if you have trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal Savior

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:06.820
you've been bought with a price that is the precious blood of Christ we're not

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:13.940
our own we belong to him and the Bible tells us that we are the temple of the

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.739
Holy Ghost and what a blessed truth we find that the Word of God reveals to us

00:05:18.739 --> 00:05:24.339
the truth with regard to the indwelling of the Spirit of God and also the

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:28.019
filling of the Spirit of God we think about the indwelling of the Spirit of

00:05:28.019 --> 00:05:32.299
God we find that both that Paul deals with it both with the believers in

00:05:32.299 --> 00:05:36.540
Corinth and also with the believers in Ephesus that the indwelling of the

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:41.179
Spirit of God that is the earnest of our salvation that is the proof of our

00:05:41.179 --> 00:05:46.779
redemption and what a blessed truth that is but we find that as we go through our

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:51.980
lives this important aspect and we think about the cleansing aspect and we'll get

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:56.420
to it as we get in the message this morning that only comes as a result of

00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:02.059
some examination some examination and so this morning as we look at this passage

00:06:02.059 --> 00:06:07.220
of Scripture I really want to focus upon the what I would call the discipline of

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:11.619
self-examination the matter of self-examination I believe is of

00:06:11.619 --> 00:06:19.059
significant importance however I would say this morning that far too often in

00:06:19.059 --> 00:06:26.459
2020 broadly speaking in Christian circles it is a discipline that is far

00:06:26.459 --> 00:06:32.739
too often ignored this morning we understand as we observe the Lord's

00:06:32.739 --> 00:06:38.380
Supper we have the the table there and it says this do in remembrance of me and

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:43.980
so often as we think about the table and the Lord's Supper and that ordinance

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:49.019
that he gave us yes it's a table it's a memorial it's a table of remembrance but

00:06:49.019 --> 00:06:53.980
we find that the Bible says in 1st Corinthians 11 let a man examine himself

00:06:53.980 --> 00:07:00.420
this process of self-examination in fact Paul says not only the believers as he

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:04.540
writes that first epistle in 1st Corinthians chapter 11 but again in the

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:09.299
book of 2nd Corinthians he says examine yourselves and so this morning I've

00:07:09.299 --> 00:07:14.179
simply used that as our title examine yourselves notice what the Bible says

00:07:14.179 --> 00:07:19.459
Peter here in 1st Peter 1 in verse number 13 the Bible says this wherefore

00:07:19.459 --> 00:07:27.059
gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that

00:07:27.059 --> 00:07:32.380
is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ notice verse

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:40.179
14 as obedient children not fashioning yourselves according to the former lust

00:07:40.179 --> 00:07:51.299
in your ignorance but as he which hath called you is holy so be ye holy in all

00:07:51.299 --> 00:08:00.019
manner of conversation because it is written be holy for I am holy I'm so

00:08:00.019 --> 00:08:05.140
thankful that we serve a holy God in fact as we think about the holiness of

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:10.019
God on display throughout the scriptures we find that probably one of the great

00:08:10.179 --> 00:08:14.260
passages of scripture where you're confronted with the holiness of God is

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:19.100
when you see Isaiah in the sixth chapter in the year that King Uzziah died the

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:25.380
Bible tells us that Isaiah saw the Lord high holy and lifted up and his train

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:30.380
did fill the temple the Bible goes on to explain to us that vision of use of

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:34.940
Isaiah in Isaiah chapter number six where the Bible says that he sees the

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:42.979
angels and they're crying out holy holy holy our God is holy he says there to

00:08:42.979 --> 00:08:46.780
the the children of Israel in the book of Leviticus and really this is a quote

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:53.179
from Leviticus you find that he says this truth of being holy because he is

00:08:53.179 --> 00:08:58.340
holy and as we begin to consider the passage of scripture begin to consider

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:02.500
the preparation if you will for revival and being in a place where we are

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:07.460
revival ready I believe that this process of self-examination is of great

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:13.260
importance I thought this week as I was preparing and I was meditating and just

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:17.500
musing upon the the subject matter that I believe the Lord led me to to preach

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:24.140
this morning I had recollection and some of you no doubt can understand the

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:29.940
pressures that an organization feels in the subsequent preparation that they go

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:35.419
through when they're facing an audit in fact there are times in which when I

00:09:35.419 --> 00:09:38.539
worked in the corporate world that when they would announce that there was an

00:09:38.539 --> 00:09:43.940
audit coming you kind of wish that you were on vacation that week because it's

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:49.059
something that was not always a pleasant experience there were a number of

00:09:49.059 --> 00:09:55.299
pressures that would be upon not only the management team but also upon the

00:09:55.299 --> 00:10:01.859
individuals within that organization you would find that all of a sudden

00:10:01.859 --> 00:10:04.019
then there'd be a certain amount of preparation

00:10:04.019 --> 00:10:06.179
that the employees would go through

00:10:06.179 --> 00:10:10.439
in preparing for that audit.

00:10:10.439 --> 00:10:12.539
This morning, as I can recall,

00:10:12.539 --> 00:10:14.979
times in which I interacted with auditors

00:10:14.979 --> 00:10:16.859
over the years,

00:10:16.859 --> 00:10:19.259
I believe that there are valuable lessons

00:10:19.259 --> 00:10:22.139
that we can learn from their work

00:10:22.139 --> 00:10:24.419
that will be of assistance to us,

00:10:24.419 --> 00:10:26.539
to me, to you,

00:10:26.539 --> 00:10:28.499
as we consider the subject matter

00:10:28.499 --> 00:10:31.219
to examine ourselves.

00:10:31.219 --> 00:10:34.139
See, the reality this morning

00:10:34.139 --> 00:10:36.419
is that for an organization

00:10:36.419 --> 00:10:39.699
that has properly fulfilled

00:10:39.699 --> 00:10:42.299
all of their responsibilities,

00:10:42.299 --> 00:10:44.059
the announcement of an audit

00:10:44.059 --> 00:10:46.459
does not really bring that great

00:10:46.459 --> 00:10:48.219
of an amount of pressure.

00:10:48.219 --> 00:10:49.979
Why? Because you've already been doing

00:10:49.979 --> 00:10:52.339
what you're supposed to do.

00:10:52.339 --> 00:10:54.219
The problem is when you're not doing

00:10:54.219 --> 00:10:56.139
the things that you're supposed to do,

00:10:56.139 --> 00:10:58.699
when you're not following the protocols

00:10:58.699 --> 00:11:00.059
and so on and so forth,

00:11:00.059 --> 00:11:02.619
when you find out that there's an audit scheduled,

00:11:02.619 --> 00:11:07.139
there is a very high level of stress.

00:11:07.139 --> 00:11:08.339
And this morning,

00:11:08.339 --> 00:11:11.219
for a company to go through a process

00:11:11.219 --> 00:11:13.699
of having an outside company come in

00:11:13.699 --> 00:11:15.299
and perform an audit,

00:11:15.299 --> 00:11:18.179
if they have been going through

00:11:18.179 --> 00:11:21.259
proper channels and proper processes

00:11:21.259 --> 00:11:23.979
as they go through their daily routine,

00:11:23.979 --> 00:11:26.179
they don't have to stress over it.

00:11:26.179 --> 00:11:27.619
And this morning, I tell you,

00:11:27.659 --> 00:11:32.139
one day we're going to stand before God.

00:11:32.139 --> 00:11:34.859
We're going to stand before God.

00:11:34.859 --> 00:11:36.219
And the reality this morning

00:11:36.219 --> 00:11:39.779
is that I so much look forward to the day

00:11:39.779 --> 00:11:43.299
that I will see my Savior face to face.

00:11:43.299 --> 00:11:45.659
But the very thought of standing before

00:11:45.659 --> 00:11:47.419
the Lord God Almighty

00:11:47.419 --> 00:11:49.019
at the bema seat of Christ,

00:11:49.019 --> 00:11:51.459
the judgment seat of Christ,

00:11:51.459 --> 00:11:54.219
is something that as we would consider

00:11:54.219 --> 00:11:55.419
the subject matter,

00:11:55.419 --> 00:11:57.979
would lead us to this process

00:11:57.979 --> 00:12:00.419
of self-examination.

00:12:00.419 --> 00:12:01.539
Why?

00:12:01.539 --> 00:12:04.179
Because if I just neglect this whole process,

00:12:04.179 --> 00:12:06.139
this whole discipline,

00:12:06.139 --> 00:12:08.059
then one day I'm going to stand before the Lord

00:12:08.059 --> 00:12:10.899
and I'm not going to quite be prepared.

00:12:10.899 --> 00:12:12.499
I don't know that any of us

00:12:12.499 --> 00:12:16.379
could be fully prepared.

00:12:16.379 --> 00:12:17.899
But the truth of God's Word

00:12:17.899 --> 00:12:20.339
with regard to examine yourselves

00:12:20.339 --> 00:12:22.219
and self-examination

00:12:22.219 --> 00:12:24.499
will go a long way to help us

00:12:24.499 --> 00:12:26.259
to be in a place

00:12:26.259 --> 00:12:29.619
where we are ready for that day.

00:12:29.619 --> 00:12:31.379
Let me share a few thoughts with you.

00:12:31.379 --> 00:12:33.579
Number one, this morning if you're taking notes,

00:12:33.579 --> 00:12:35.659
and I'm going to use four R's

00:12:35.659 --> 00:12:37.219
to alliterate it this morning

00:12:37.219 --> 00:12:38.499
in this fashion.

00:12:38.499 --> 00:12:40.139
Number one is review.

00:12:40.139 --> 00:12:41.339
What does the auditor do

00:12:41.339 --> 00:12:42.499
as soon as they come in?

00:12:42.499 --> 00:12:44.859
They begin to take all of the documentation, right?

00:12:44.859 --> 00:12:46.459
They begin this thorough review.

00:12:46.459 --> 00:12:47.979
And so, as I begin to think about

00:12:47.979 --> 00:12:49.899
this process of examine yourselves,

00:12:49.899 --> 00:12:51.299
this self-examination,

00:12:51.299 --> 00:12:53.699
this discipline that we're referring to this morning,

00:12:53.739 --> 00:12:54.779
I say, well, first of all,

00:12:54.779 --> 00:12:57.059
there has to be a review.

00:12:57.059 --> 00:12:59.619
That review, I say, how do we do it?

00:12:59.619 --> 00:13:00.699
Well, first of all,

00:13:00.699 --> 00:13:02.779
we must understand that it has to be

00:13:02.779 --> 00:13:06.379
an honest and a thorough review.

00:13:06.379 --> 00:13:08.299
It must be honest.

00:13:08.299 --> 00:13:09.819
It must be thorough.

00:13:09.819 --> 00:13:11.139
It must be a situation.

00:13:11.139 --> 00:13:12.419
Notice what Peter says here,

00:13:12.419 --> 00:13:13.899
and we'll reference this often

00:13:13.899 --> 00:13:15.579
throughout our message this morning,

00:13:15.579 --> 00:13:17.179
that in verse number 14 he says,

00:13:17.179 --> 00:13:19.579
as obedient children,

00:13:19.579 --> 00:13:21.219
in verse number 15 he says,

00:13:21.259 --> 00:13:26.139
so be holy in all manner of conversation.

00:13:26.139 --> 00:13:27.539
So there must be a review,

00:13:27.539 --> 00:13:29.379
and the review must be honest

00:13:29.379 --> 00:13:31.339
and it must be thorough.

00:13:31.339 --> 00:13:33.579
When I consider the review

00:13:33.579 --> 00:13:36.139
and I consider how it is that we would review

00:13:36.139 --> 00:13:39.059
our own lives as we would examine ourselves,

00:13:39.059 --> 00:13:41.219
I find this morning that the standard

00:13:41.219 --> 00:13:44.699
for the review must be the Word of God.

00:13:44.699 --> 00:13:46.539
It is not valid that we would use

00:13:46.539 --> 00:13:48.699
somebody else's life as the standard

00:13:48.699 --> 00:13:50.899
by which we would examine ourselves.

00:13:50.899 --> 00:13:52.939
No, it must be the Word of God.

00:13:52.939 --> 00:13:54.779
The prophet said that the Word of God

00:13:54.779 --> 00:13:55.979
was like a plumb line,

00:13:55.979 --> 00:13:58.379
and that's how they were going to be judged.

00:13:58.379 --> 00:14:00.339
And this morning as we would consider

00:14:00.339 --> 00:14:02.179
the power of God's Word

00:14:02.179 --> 00:14:03.819
and the truth of God's Word,

00:14:03.819 --> 00:14:05.539
we find that it is this book

00:14:05.539 --> 00:14:06.899
that must be the standard

00:14:06.899 --> 00:14:09.819
by which we examine ourselves.

00:14:09.819 --> 00:14:13.059
An auditor has a standard.

00:14:13.059 --> 00:14:15.139
They come in with some type of,

00:14:15.139 --> 00:14:16.979
if you're having a financial audit,

00:14:16.979 --> 00:14:19.939
they have certain protocols

00:14:19.939 --> 00:14:21.500
and certain standards by which

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:24.099
they're going to audit that company by.

00:14:24.099 --> 00:14:25.859
And this morning as God's people,

00:14:25.859 --> 00:14:28.979
I say this is the standard.

00:14:28.979 --> 00:14:30.579
The very Word of God.

00:14:30.579 --> 00:14:32.500
As Baptist people, we have said for years,

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:33.699
in fact, for years,

00:14:33.699 --> 00:14:35.379
Baptist people have been referred to

00:14:35.379 --> 00:14:37.019
as people of the book.

00:14:37.019 --> 00:14:39.019
By the way, that's a good terminology.

00:14:39.019 --> 00:14:40.019
Amen?

00:14:40.019 --> 00:14:41.819
And we find that as Baptist people,

00:14:41.819 --> 00:14:43.699
we would say that the Bible

00:14:43.699 --> 00:14:48.500
is our sole authority for faith and practice.

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:49.659
This morning, the Word of God

00:14:49.699 --> 00:14:50.899
must be the standard by which

00:14:50.899 --> 00:14:52.099
we examine ourselves.

00:14:52.099 --> 00:14:53.859
Notice, if you want to take,

00:14:53.859 --> 00:14:55.459
and we're going to look at a number of passages

00:14:55.459 --> 00:14:57.459
this morning, but look back a few pages

00:14:57.459 --> 00:15:00.259
in your Bible at James 1 if you will.

00:15:00.259 --> 00:15:02.979
In James 1, the Bible's referring to a verse

00:15:02.979 --> 00:15:05.339
that we often reference as verse 22

00:15:05.339 --> 00:15:06.579
of being doers of the Word

00:15:06.579 --> 00:15:08.579
and not hearers, only deceiving your own selves.

00:15:08.579 --> 00:15:10.339
But I want you to focus and look

00:15:10.339 --> 00:15:12.459
at what the Bible says in verse 25.

00:15:12.459 --> 00:15:13.699
The Bible says this,

00:15:13.699 --> 00:15:19.939
but whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty.

00:15:19.939 --> 00:15:22.019
I'm thankful that God describes His Word

00:15:22.019 --> 00:15:23.299
in that manner.

00:15:23.299 --> 00:15:25.299
It is the perfect law of liberty.

00:15:25.299 --> 00:15:26.299
And the Bible says,

00:15:26.299 --> 00:15:29.139
whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty,

00:15:29.139 --> 00:15:30.139
notice what it says,

00:15:30.139 --> 00:15:33.859
and continueth therein.

00:15:33.859 --> 00:15:35.979
He being not a forgetful hearer,

00:15:35.979 --> 00:15:38.859
but a doer of the work,

00:15:38.859 --> 00:15:42.899
this man shall be blessed in his deed.

00:15:42.939 --> 00:15:44.779
We say that the Bible is our sole authority

00:15:44.779 --> 00:15:46.859
for faith, what we believe,

00:15:46.859 --> 00:15:49.659
and practice, the things that we do.

00:15:49.659 --> 00:15:51.419
And as we would go through the process

00:15:51.419 --> 00:15:52.979
of self-examination,

00:15:52.979 --> 00:15:54.259
we find that the Bible says,

00:15:54.259 --> 00:15:55.339
and you don't need to turn there,

00:15:55.339 --> 00:15:58.139
but Paul as he's writing to the believers in Ephesus,

00:15:58.139 --> 00:16:00.139
and he's speaking to them about their walk,

00:16:00.139 --> 00:16:02.099
and really in chapters 4 and 5,

00:16:02.099 --> 00:16:03.979
he references five different areas

00:16:03.979 --> 00:16:06.459
with regard to the walk of the believer.

00:16:06.459 --> 00:16:07.859
And he says this,

00:16:07.859 --> 00:16:11.939
proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.

00:16:11.939 --> 00:16:14.859
In Ephesians 5, in verse 10.

00:16:14.859 --> 00:16:18.419
This morning, the Word of God must be the standard.

00:16:18.419 --> 00:16:20.219
It absolutely must be the standard.

00:16:20.219 --> 00:16:21.579
So we understand how.

00:16:21.579 --> 00:16:22.539
It must be honest.

00:16:22.539 --> 00:16:24.419
It must be thorough.

00:16:24.419 --> 00:16:26.179
We understand that there's a standard,

00:16:26.179 --> 00:16:28.500
and for us this morning as the people of God,

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:30.579
that standard is the Word of God.

00:16:30.579 --> 00:16:34.259
By the way, I'm thankful that God's Word hasn't changed.

00:16:34.259 --> 00:16:36.899
I'm thankful that we're not looking for a revision.

00:16:36.899 --> 00:16:38.699
For an updated version.

00:16:38.699 --> 00:16:41.619
I'm thankful that God is eternal,

00:16:41.699 --> 00:16:43.739
and He has given us a book

00:16:43.739 --> 00:16:48.339
that is applicable and relevant today.

00:16:48.339 --> 00:16:49.179
So many people that say,

00:16:49.179 --> 00:16:50.459
oh, it's so old.

00:16:50.459 --> 00:16:52.619
Yeah, but the author is eternal.

00:16:52.619 --> 00:16:53.779
Amen?

00:16:53.779 --> 00:16:55.179
What a joy.

00:16:55.179 --> 00:16:57.699
It's the Word of God that's the standard.

00:16:57.699 --> 00:17:00.059
This morning we ask ourselves, why?

00:17:00.059 --> 00:17:01.419
Why do I go through this?

00:17:01.419 --> 00:17:03.459
Why do you think we should go through

00:17:03.459 --> 00:17:05.500
a process of examining ourselves?

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:07.979
Why do we have to have this discipline?

00:17:07.979 --> 00:17:09.819
Can I say to you very simply

00:17:09.859 --> 00:17:12.619
that Paul says in Romans 14 and verse number 12,

00:17:12.619 --> 00:17:15.459
so that every one of us

00:17:15.459 --> 00:17:19.539
shall give account of himself to God.

00:17:21.739 --> 00:17:24.059
What does a steward do?

00:17:24.059 --> 00:17:26.739
He's responsible for the things

00:17:26.739 --> 00:17:27.939
that have been entrusted to him,

00:17:27.939 --> 00:17:31.500
but he also is called to give an account regularly.

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:32.779
Or at least he should be.

00:17:33.779 --> 00:17:35.099
We're stewards.

00:17:36.099 --> 00:17:40.059
And this morning, in Romans 14 and verse number 12,

00:17:40.059 --> 00:17:41.419
as Paul is referencing,

00:17:41.419 --> 00:17:42.659
and there are a number of chapters

00:17:42.659 --> 00:17:44.139
and a number of references

00:17:44.139 --> 00:17:46.859
to the fact that we will give an account

00:17:46.859 --> 00:17:48.099
and stand before the Lord,

00:17:48.099 --> 00:17:50.259
but I understand how Paul says it

00:17:50.259 --> 00:17:51.379
in this particular text,

00:17:51.379 --> 00:17:54.739
so then every one of us,

00:17:54.739 --> 00:17:56.099
if you're a believer this morning,

00:17:56.099 --> 00:17:58.139
if you've trusted the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:17:58.139 --> 00:17:59.739
you can rejoice in the fact

00:17:59.739 --> 00:18:02.539
that the second death has no power over you.

00:18:02.539 --> 00:18:04.339
You can rejoice this morning

00:18:04.379 --> 00:18:05.619
that you will not stand

00:18:05.619 --> 00:18:07.339
at the great white throne judgment

00:18:07.339 --> 00:18:09.459
and what blessed truth that is.

00:18:09.459 --> 00:18:11.739
However, as a child of God,

00:18:11.739 --> 00:18:14.099
we will give an account

00:18:14.099 --> 00:18:19.099
and we give that account of himself to God.

00:18:19.339 --> 00:18:20.979
Wow.

00:18:20.979 --> 00:18:22.979
I hope this morning you see the seriousness

00:18:22.979 --> 00:18:24.179
of the subject matter.

00:18:25.259 --> 00:18:26.299
You understand this morning

00:18:26.299 --> 00:18:29.579
that you're not giving an account for someone else.

00:18:29.579 --> 00:18:31.459
I preached a message two Wednesday nights ago.

00:18:31.459 --> 00:18:33.979
Search me, oh God.

00:18:33.979 --> 00:18:34.820
Why?

00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:36.019
Because I'm not gonna stand

00:18:36.019 --> 00:18:37.619
and give an account for someone else.

00:18:37.619 --> 00:18:39.820
I'm standing and giving an account for myself.

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:42.940
Now as a pastor, I will give an account.

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:45.979
I'm told as one of my responsibilities in Hebrews

00:18:45.979 --> 00:18:48.500
that I watch for your souls.

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:51.659
And it's very interesting what the writer says

00:18:51.659 --> 00:18:55.140
there in Hebrews with regard to that subject matter.

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:58.940
The Bible says in Hebrews 13 and verse 17,

00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:00.700
obey them that have the rule over you

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:03.899
and submit yourselves for they watch for your souls,

00:19:04.779 --> 00:19:08.140
notice this, as they must give account

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:10.500
that they may do it,

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:14.059
notice what it says, with joy and not with grief.

00:19:14.059 --> 00:19:15.500
But then it says this,

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:17.619
for that is unprofitable for you.

00:19:21.059 --> 00:19:22.899
We understand the subject matter this morning

00:19:22.899 --> 00:19:24.500
dealing with the Bema Seat of Christ

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:26.459
and the examine ourselves

00:19:26.459 --> 00:19:29.619
because the reality is that every one of us

00:19:29.619 --> 00:19:33.659
shall give account of himself to God.

00:19:34.419 --> 00:19:35.940
That word shall, we like when it's in the context

00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:37.179
of like Romans 10, 13,

00:19:37.179 --> 00:19:38.779
for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord

00:19:38.779 --> 00:19:41.619
shall be saved, we say praise the Lord.

00:19:41.619 --> 00:19:44.739
He shall come, we say praise the Lord.

00:19:44.739 --> 00:19:47.459
You shall give account.

00:19:47.459 --> 00:19:48.739
It's certain.

00:19:48.739 --> 00:19:50.459
I remember there were times,

00:19:50.459 --> 00:19:52.859
the very first audit that I remember

00:19:54.299 --> 00:19:56.779
when I worked for Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation,

00:19:56.779 --> 00:19:58.619
I had not been there very long

00:19:58.619 --> 00:20:00.380
and unfortunately there were some practices

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:01.659
that had taken place.

00:20:01.659 --> 00:20:04.079
prior to my arrival that weren't really

00:20:04.079 --> 00:20:06.139
within the way in which things

00:20:06.139 --> 00:20:07.579
were supposed to be conducted

00:20:07.579 --> 00:20:08.799
and so on and so forth.

00:20:08.799 --> 00:20:11.139
And I remember having this thought

00:20:11.139 --> 00:20:12.979
and really everyone within our department

00:20:12.979 --> 00:20:13.779
had the thought,

00:20:13.779 --> 00:20:16.439
I hope they don't talk to me.

00:20:16.439 --> 00:20:18.559
I'm hoping that they just pass right past

00:20:18.559 --> 00:20:20.679
where I am and they go to somebody else

00:20:20.679 --> 00:20:22.379
to talk to that someone else

00:20:22.379 --> 00:20:24.259
can give an account.

00:20:24.259 --> 00:20:25.759
Can I tell you biblically speaking

00:20:25.759 --> 00:20:26.879
the matter of the subject

00:20:26.879 --> 00:20:28.659
that's before us this morning?

00:20:28.659 --> 00:20:31.459
You're going to give an account.

00:20:31.459 --> 00:20:32.899
It's certain.

00:20:32.899 --> 00:20:35.099
So therefore, we must go through

00:20:35.099 --> 00:20:36.859
this review process.

00:20:36.859 --> 00:20:38.339
It behooves us.

00:20:38.339 --> 00:20:40.459
It is advantageous for us.

00:20:40.459 --> 00:20:41.819
I think this way.

00:20:41.819 --> 00:20:44.419
My understanding of the truth

00:20:44.419 --> 00:20:48.539
leads me to this process.

00:20:48.539 --> 00:20:52.299
We understand that truth impacts.

00:20:52.299 --> 00:20:53.099
Amen?

00:20:53.099 --> 00:20:54.779
I've often said over the years

00:20:54.779 --> 00:20:56.699
that truth, that belief,

00:20:56.699 --> 00:20:58.699
will impact our behavior.

00:20:58.699 --> 00:21:00.819
If I understand the truth

00:21:00.859 --> 00:21:02.259
that is before us this morning

00:21:02.259 --> 00:21:03.699
and I understand the fact

00:21:03.699 --> 00:21:05.259
that I will stand before the Lord,

00:21:05.259 --> 00:21:06.779
then it leads me to this process

00:21:06.779 --> 00:21:08.419
that has an impact and effect

00:21:08.419 --> 00:21:11.259
upon my behavior.

00:21:11.259 --> 00:21:12.299
So number one, I review.

00:21:12.299 --> 00:21:14.699
Number two, recognize.

00:21:14.699 --> 00:21:16.139
What do I mean by recognize?

00:21:16.139 --> 00:21:17.939
Well, the purpose of reviewing

00:21:17.939 --> 00:21:20.019
is so that we can properly identify

00:21:20.019 --> 00:21:23.419
areas that need to be addressed.

00:21:23.419 --> 00:21:25.259
Remember, we're doing a thorough

00:21:25.259 --> 00:21:26.859
and honest evaluation

00:21:26.859 --> 00:21:28.299
and a thorough and honest review.

00:21:28.299 --> 00:21:29.419
We're using the Word of God

00:21:29.419 --> 00:21:30.419
as our standard.

00:21:30.459 --> 00:21:31.859
And we understand that,

00:21:31.859 --> 00:21:33.099
as we've mentioned already

00:21:33.099 --> 00:21:34.059
on two occasions,

00:21:34.059 --> 00:21:36.019
that in 1 Peter 1 and verse 15,

00:21:36.019 --> 00:21:36.459
he says,

00:21:36.459 --> 00:21:37.899
So be ye holy.

00:21:37.899 --> 00:21:39.259
Notice the phrase,

00:21:39.259 --> 00:21:41.979
in all manner of conversation.

00:21:41.979 --> 00:21:44.579
I had a Bible college professor

00:21:44.579 --> 00:21:46.699
that was a real sharp fella.

00:21:46.699 --> 00:21:48.299
And he said, listen, fellas,

00:21:48.299 --> 00:21:49.219
all means all.

00:21:49.219 --> 00:21:51.299
And that's all that all means.

00:21:51.299 --> 00:21:53.819
And he would say that regularly.

00:21:53.819 --> 00:21:55.419
And the reality is that

00:21:55.419 --> 00:21:56.779
when we look at the passage

00:21:56.779 --> 00:21:57.499
of Scripture, he says,

00:21:57.499 --> 00:21:59.859
all manner of conversation,

00:21:59.939 --> 00:22:01.059
the whole of it,

00:22:01.059 --> 00:22:03.299
every aspect of it,

00:22:03.299 --> 00:22:04.339
and what is it?

00:22:04.339 --> 00:22:05.659
The manner of conversation.

00:22:05.659 --> 00:22:06.819
That's our manner of life.

00:22:06.819 --> 00:22:07.979
That's our conduct.

00:22:07.979 --> 00:22:10.459
That's our behavior.

00:22:10.459 --> 00:22:12.579
And so begin to boil down

00:22:12.579 --> 00:22:14.299
and look at what God is saying.

00:22:14.299 --> 00:22:15.899
And we understand that He says

00:22:15.899 --> 00:22:16.939
that we're to be holy

00:22:16.939 --> 00:22:19.139
in all manner of conversation.

00:22:19.139 --> 00:22:20.939
Now, we understand this morning

00:22:20.939 --> 00:22:23.979
that Peter is writing to believers.

00:22:23.979 --> 00:22:25.059
He's writing to people

00:22:25.059 --> 00:22:26.699
that are saved.

00:22:26.699 --> 00:22:27.699
They've been justified.

00:22:27.739 --> 00:22:30.019
He tells to those believers

00:22:30.019 --> 00:22:31.659
in chapter 1 and verse 5

00:22:31.659 --> 00:22:35.779
that they are kept by the power of God.

00:22:35.779 --> 00:22:37.539
That they have a treasure,

00:22:37.539 --> 00:22:40.059
an inheritance that's incorruptible,

00:22:40.059 --> 00:22:40.979
that's undefiled,

00:22:40.979 --> 00:22:42.619
that's fadeth not away,

00:22:42.619 --> 00:22:44.259
that's reserved in heaven for them.

00:22:44.259 --> 00:22:46.939
I mean, he's writing to believers.

00:22:46.939 --> 00:22:47.859
But he says, listen,

00:22:47.859 --> 00:22:48.899
you're to be holy

00:22:48.899 --> 00:22:51.579
in all manner of conversation.

00:22:51.579 --> 00:22:52.779
Can I tell you this morning

00:22:52.779 --> 00:22:55.539
that God cares how we live?

00:22:55.539 --> 00:22:57.299
He does.

00:22:57.299 --> 00:22:58.579
Paul says this to the believers

00:22:58.579 --> 00:23:01.139
in Thessalonica in 1 Thessalonians 4

00:23:01.139 --> 00:23:05.019
that you know how you ought to behave.

00:23:05.019 --> 00:23:07.139
That you know how you ought to walk.

00:23:07.139 --> 00:23:08.739
I believe that's exactly how he says it there

00:23:08.739 --> 00:23:10.699
in 1 Thessalonians 4.

00:23:10.699 --> 00:23:14.419
That you know how you ought to walk.

00:23:14.419 --> 00:23:16.939
Again, we don't walk in a certain way

00:23:16.939 --> 00:23:19.299
so that we can keep our salvation.

00:23:19.299 --> 00:23:21.139
We don't walk, live in a certain way

00:23:21.139 --> 00:23:23.859
so that we can earn our salvation.

00:23:23.859 --> 00:23:26.299
That was settled on the cross of Calvary.

00:23:26.299 --> 00:23:28.619
Jesus Christ said it is finished.

00:23:28.619 --> 00:23:30.619
He was buried and He rose in victory

00:23:30.619 --> 00:23:32.739
conquering sin, death, and the grave.

00:23:32.739 --> 00:23:36.619
But He is concerned about how we live our lives.

00:23:36.619 --> 00:23:37.579
Listen, this morning,

00:23:37.579 --> 00:23:39.339
there is not a sacred part of you

00:23:39.339 --> 00:23:41.419
and a secular part of you.

00:23:41.419 --> 00:23:43.259
All of you has been redeemed

00:23:43.259 --> 00:23:45.419
by the blood of Christ.

00:23:45.419 --> 00:23:47.899
Aren't you thankful for that by the way?

00:23:47.899 --> 00:23:49.699
And he says that we're to be holy

00:23:49.699 --> 00:23:53.139
in all manner of conversation.

00:23:53.139 --> 00:23:54.339
It's not a situation where you say,

00:23:54.659 --> 00:23:56.379
I'm in this place now

00:23:56.379 --> 00:23:58.139
and so I can behave this way.

00:23:58.139 --> 00:23:59.659
I'm over here in this place

00:23:59.659 --> 00:24:01.019
around these people and I behave this way.

00:24:01.019 --> 00:24:01.859
No, no, no.

00:24:01.859 --> 00:24:05.899
We're to be holy in all manner of conversation.

00:24:05.899 --> 00:24:07.699
Now, admittedly this morning,

00:24:07.699 --> 00:24:09.979
there's no way I could exhaust a list

00:24:09.979 --> 00:24:12.179
of all manner of conversation.

00:24:12.179 --> 00:24:14.699
But I'm gonna try to help us this morning

00:24:14.699 --> 00:24:18.779
to pinpoint a few areas that ought to be reviewed,

00:24:18.779 --> 00:24:20.739
that ought to be considered.

00:24:20.739 --> 00:24:22.579
Now, listen, let me tell you this

00:24:22.579 --> 00:24:24.299
before I even get into the verses.

00:24:25.059 --> 00:24:26.539
God already stepped on my toes.

00:24:28.179 --> 00:24:31.259
I anticipate that He's gonna step on my toes again

00:24:31.259 --> 00:24:33.539
as I deliver it to you this morning.

00:24:33.539 --> 00:24:37.339
Don't get mad when God steps on your toes.

00:24:37.339 --> 00:24:38.419
It's a good thing.

00:24:40.299 --> 00:24:42.379
Because He's confronting us

00:24:42.379 --> 00:24:43.419
and He's helping us to live.

00:24:43.419 --> 00:24:45.459
Listen, I'm saying this morning

00:24:45.459 --> 00:24:46.659
that the standard is the Word of God.

00:24:46.659 --> 00:24:49.259
I'm gonna show you what God's Word says.

00:24:50.259 --> 00:24:52.499
I cannot give you an exhaustive list

00:24:52.539 --> 00:24:54.579
of what all manner of conversation is.

00:24:54.579 --> 00:24:56.539
We'd be here forever trying to go through

00:24:56.539 --> 00:24:59.219
every little detail of our lives.

00:24:59.219 --> 00:25:00.779
But let me give you a sampling.

00:25:02.579 --> 00:25:06.139
We think about this truth that I am bought with a price.

00:25:06.139 --> 00:25:09.459
Remember, Paul says it this way in 1 Corinthians 6.

00:25:09.459 --> 00:25:10.459
What?

00:25:10.459 --> 00:25:12.179
No ye not?

00:25:12.179 --> 00:25:15.259
I mean, he's going to these believers

00:25:15.259 --> 00:25:17.259
in the book of 1 Corinthians

00:25:17.259 --> 00:25:19.459
with regard to all of their carnality

00:25:19.459 --> 00:25:21.099
and all of the things that are going on.

00:25:21.099 --> 00:25:21.939
And he says, what?

00:25:21.939 --> 00:25:24.939
No ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost

00:25:24.939 --> 00:25:26.499
which is in you, which you have of God.

00:25:26.499 --> 00:25:28.099
You're not your own.

00:25:28.099 --> 00:25:29.619
You're bought with a price.

00:25:29.619 --> 00:25:32.099
Therefore, glorify God in your body

00:25:32.099 --> 00:25:35.259
and in your spirit, which are God's.

00:25:35.259 --> 00:25:38.619
Let me just point out a few things this morning.

00:25:38.619 --> 00:25:41.379
When we think about this recognition,

00:25:41.379 --> 00:25:43.299
we've reviewed and we recognize,

00:25:43.299 --> 00:25:45.379
well, what is it, preacher, that I should review?

00:25:45.379 --> 00:25:48.059
Number one, we should review what I read.

00:25:48.059 --> 00:25:49.699
What I read.

00:25:49.699 --> 00:25:50.619
What am I reading?

00:25:51.699 --> 00:25:53.859
What am I putting into my mind?

00:25:53.859 --> 00:25:56.939
The first three that I have in my notes this morning,

00:25:56.939 --> 00:26:00.699
what I read, what I watch, and what I listen to.

00:26:01.539 --> 00:26:05.299
The reason why I have those three in my list this morning

00:26:05.299 --> 00:26:06.619
that I believe the Lord led me

00:26:06.619 --> 00:26:09.019
to those three things to begin with

00:26:09.019 --> 00:26:11.819
is because we must recognize this morning

00:26:11.819 --> 00:26:15.179
how those three things affect my thoughts.

00:26:16.179 --> 00:26:21.179
What I read, what I watch, and what I listen to.

00:26:23.259 --> 00:26:26.019
The reality this morning is that

00:26:26.019 --> 00:26:28.699
when we begin to use the Word of God

00:26:28.699 --> 00:26:31.139
and we think about what He tells us

00:26:31.139 --> 00:26:32.739
with regard to our thought life

00:26:32.739 --> 00:26:35.779
and we understand how that these three areas

00:26:35.779 --> 00:26:38.099
will impact my thinking,

00:26:38.099 --> 00:26:40.979
we find that Paul says this to the believers in Philippi

00:26:40.979 --> 00:26:42.659
in Philippians 4 and verse number eight,

00:26:42.899 --> 00:26:45.619
finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true,

00:26:45.619 --> 00:26:46.979
whatsoever things are honest,

00:26:46.979 --> 00:26:48.499
whatsoever things are just,

00:26:48.499 --> 00:26:49.739
whatsoever things are pure,

00:26:49.739 --> 00:26:50.859
whatsoever things are lovely,

00:26:50.859 --> 00:26:52.259
whatsoever things are of good report,

00:26:52.259 --> 00:26:54.419
if there be any virtue and if there be any praise,

00:26:54.419 --> 00:26:57.859
think on these things.

00:26:57.859 --> 00:26:59.619
In 2 Corinthians 10 and verse number five,

00:26:59.619 --> 00:27:01.899
he says that we're to bring into captivity

00:27:01.899 --> 00:27:05.459
every thought to the obedience of Christ.

00:27:06.379 --> 00:27:09.579
How's my thought life being impacted by what I'm reading?

00:27:09.579 --> 00:27:12.539
How's my thought life being impacted by what I'm watching?

00:27:13.419 --> 00:27:14.259
The psalmist said,

00:27:14.259 --> 00:27:15.899
I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes.

00:27:15.899 --> 00:27:17.779
How's my thought life being impacted

00:27:17.779 --> 00:27:19.539
by the things I listen to?

00:27:19.539 --> 00:27:20.659
You ever been in a situation

00:27:20.659 --> 00:27:21.739
where you get into somebody's car

00:27:21.739 --> 00:27:23.699
and they turn off the music real quick?

00:27:25.859 --> 00:27:28.259
They must have some level of understanding

00:27:28.259 --> 00:27:29.859
that what they had been listening to

00:27:29.859 --> 00:27:32.059
probably isn't good for your presence.

00:27:32.059 --> 00:27:34.019
What about God's presence?

00:27:35.379 --> 00:27:38.819
I'm thankful this morning that our God is omnipotent.

00:27:38.819 --> 00:27:40.019
He has all power.

00:27:40.019 --> 00:27:42.059
I'm thankful this morning that our God is omniscient,

00:27:42.059 --> 00:27:43.579
that He knows all things.

00:27:43.579 --> 00:27:45.979
And I'm thankful this morning that our God is omnipresent,

00:27:45.979 --> 00:27:47.699
that He is everywhere present.

00:27:47.699 --> 00:27:51.939
And that truth of God's omnipresence is a comforting truth.

00:27:51.939 --> 00:27:53.939
I will never leave thee nor forsake thee.

00:27:53.939 --> 00:27:55.819
I am with thee.

00:27:55.819 --> 00:27:57.619
It's also a convicting truth.

00:27:57.619 --> 00:27:59.259
He's always with us.

00:28:01.259 --> 00:28:02.539
If it wouldn't be appropriate

00:28:02.539 --> 00:28:05.139
if God were sitting next to you physically, bodily

00:28:05.139 --> 00:28:08.099
to hear, read, or watch something,

00:28:08.099 --> 00:28:10.019
then you ought not be doing it.

00:28:10.019 --> 00:28:11.499
Amen?

00:28:11.539 --> 00:28:13.379
It's very simple.

00:28:13.379 --> 00:28:14.419
What does the Word of God say?

00:28:14.419 --> 00:28:18.499
How do those things impact my thoughts?

00:28:18.499 --> 00:28:20.779
Am I bringing every thought into captivity?

00:28:20.779 --> 00:28:24.099
Am I able to have that honest and thorough evaluation

00:28:24.099 --> 00:28:25.659
and say, hey, look, this thing right here

00:28:25.659 --> 00:28:26.739
I shouldn't be listening to.

00:28:26.739 --> 00:28:28.579
This thing right here I shouldn't be reading.

00:28:28.579 --> 00:28:30.819
This thing right here I shouldn't be watching.

00:28:30.819 --> 00:28:31.659
Why?

00:28:31.659 --> 00:28:34.500
Because it doesn't pass the test of Philippians 4.8.

00:28:36.339 --> 00:28:37.179
If you're taking notes,

00:28:37.179 --> 00:28:39.419
not only would I read, watch, and listen to,

00:28:39.419 --> 00:28:41.259
I want you to consider your speech.

00:28:42.139 --> 00:28:44.379
I said this on Wednesday night a couple of weeks ago

00:28:44.379 --> 00:28:45.819
when I talked about search me, oh God,

00:28:45.819 --> 00:28:49.459
and I mentioned that often we kind of look at it

00:28:49.459 --> 00:28:50.779
from this lens.

00:28:50.779 --> 00:28:53.579
We begin to think about our standing before God.

00:28:53.579 --> 00:28:54.979
Well, I'm not a murderer.

00:28:54.979 --> 00:28:57.979
I'm not a, and we start naming these big things

00:28:57.979 --> 00:28:59.619
that we're not.

00:28:59.619 --> 00:29:01.139
I said this on that Wednesday night.

00:29:01.139 --> 00:29:02.500
I'm glad that you're not.

00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:03.339
Amen?

00:29:03.339 --> 00:29:05.019
I'm glad you've not murdered anyone.

00:29:05.019 --> 00:29:06.379
I mean, that's a blessing.

00:29:06.379 --> 00:29:08.579
I'd have to visit you in prison, you know?

00:29:08.579 --> 00:29:11.500
But the reality is that when you look at the walk

00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:13.219
when God deals with it,

00:29:13.219 --> 00:29:16.139
when he deals with it with the believers in Ephesus,

00:29:16.139 --> 00:29:20.379
he doesn't say, don't kill anybody.

00:29:20.379 --> 00:29:22.579
He says, speak the truth.

00:29:24.219 --> 00:29:25.500
Stop lying.

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:26.500
That's what he says.

00:29:27.659 --> 00:29:29.819
And we think about our speech,

00:29:29.819 --> 00:29:31.699
and the first aspect that I think about

00:29:31.699 --> 00:29:35.139
is that of speaking the truth in Ephesians 4 in verse 15,

00:29:35.139 --> 00:29:36.579
but speaking the truth in love

00:29:36.579 --> 00:29:38.379
may grow up into him in all things

00:29:39.059 --> 00:29:40.139
which is the head, even Christ.

00:29:40.139 --> 00:29:42.219
You know, we live in a place, we live in a time,

00:29:42.219 --> 00:29:44.299
we live in an era where unfortunately,

00:29:44.299 --> 00:29:46.779
speaking the truth does not have the value

00:29:46.779 --> 00:29:47.940
that it once had.

00:29:51.219 --> 00:29:53.579
But as God's people, we're to speak the truth.

00:29:54.539 --> 00:29:56.779
He says later in this same chapter

00:29:56.779 --> 00:30:00.619
in Ephesians 4, and as you go through the passage

00:30:00.619 --> 00:30:01.459
and you look,

00:30:01.459 --> 00:30:02.919
He says in verse number 25,

00:30:02.919 --> 00:30:05.119
"'Wherefore, putting away lying,

00:30:05.119 --> 00:30:07.499
speak every man truth with his neighbor,

00:30:07.499 --> 00:30:10.299
for we are members one of another.'"

00:30:10.299 --> 00:30:12.919
We're to speak the truth.

00:30:12.919 --> 00:30:15.619
Not being a gossip.

00:30:15.619 --> 00:30:17.879
It's kind of funny how gossip works within church.

00:30:17.879 --> 00:30:20.219
It's typically, it works kind of this way.

00:30:20.219 --> 00:30:22.979
I have a prayer request for you.

00:30:22.979 --> 00:30:25.699
And all we really want to do is gossip about something.

00:30:25.699 --> 00:30:27.679
And we kind of put the facade on

00:30:27.679 --> 00:30:28.979
that it's a prayer request.

00:30:28.979 --> 00:30:32.759
We don't spiritualize it.

00:30:32.759 --> 00:30:35.539
Now, it might be a legitimate prayer request

00:30:35.539 --> 00:30:37.079
that may not be gossip,

00:30:37.079 --> 00:30:40.019
but we've got to be careful.

00:30:40.019 --> 00:30:43.879
What about the situation where we gossip

00:30:43.879 --> 00:30:45.959
because we think, oh man, this thing happened

00:30:45.959 --> 00:30:47.119
and somebody needs to know about it.

00:30:47.119 --> 00:30:48.239
Maybe we don't say it's a prayer request,

00:30:48.239 --> 00:30:50.239
but we just feel like we've got to point out

00:30:50.239 --> 00:30:54.279
somebody else's issue.

00:30:54.279 --> 00:30:56.639
I think about the fact that we're to

00:30:56.639 --> 00:30:57.679
praise God.

00:30:57.679 --> 00:30:58.879
My speech.

00:30:58.899 --> 00:31:04.059
Is my speech characterized by complaining

00:31:04.059 --> 00:31:05.579
and murmuring?

00:31:05.579 --> 00:31:08.899
Or is it characterized of praising and thanking?

00:31:08.899 --> 00:31:10.659
You know what Paul says in the book of Philippians?

00:31:10.659 --> 00:31:12.939
If you want to turn over there to the book of Philippians

00:31:12.939 --> 00:31:15.019
in chapter 2.

00:31:15.019 --> 00:31:16.579
It's a really interesting verse.

00:31:16.579 --> 00:31:19.579
We so often talk about the truth of

00:31:19.579 --> 00:31:21.259
in everything give thanks.

00:31:21.259 --> 00:31:22.299
And those are great verses.

00:31:22.299 --> 00:31:23.819
Those are very appropriate.

00:31:23.819 --> 00:31:24.899
And they speak to our heart.

00:31:24.899 --> 00:31:27.379
And they give us the fact that in everything

00:31:27.379 --> 00:31:28.059
we're to give thanks.

00:31:28.079 --> 00:31:30.319
This is the will of God in Christ Jesus

00:31:30.319 --> 00:31:31.279
concerning you.

00:31:31.279 --> 00:31:32.679
But I want you to notice how Paul says

00:31:32.679 --> 00:31:33.679
of the believers in Philippi.

00:31:33.679 --> 00:31:35.079
In chapter number 2 of Philippians

00:31:35.079 --> 00:31:36.399
in verse number 14.

00:31:36.399 --> 00:31:37.439
He says this.

00:31:37.439 --> 00:31:42.319
Do all things without murmurings

00:31:42.319 --> 00:31:44.279
and disputings.

00:31:44.279 --> 00:31:46.799
I've often told you that I like the word murmur

00:31:46.799 --> 00:31:48.719
probably more than I like the word complain

00:31:48.719 --> 00:31:52.159
because murmur just sounds bad.

00:31:52.159 --> 00:31:53.599
Often in the Old Testament

00:31:53.599 --> 00:31:56.399
they were guilty of murmuring.

00:31:56.419 --> 00:31:58.219
You find that the word is used often

00:31:58.219 --> 00:31:58.939
in the Old Testament.

00:31:58.939 --> 00:32:01.139
You find that they were murmuring in their tents.

00:32:01.139 --> 00:32:01.979
That's their homes.

00:32:01.979 --> 00:32:02.939
That's where they lived.

00:32:02.939 --> 00:32:05.579
You think about the influence upon their children

00:32:05.579 --> 00:32:06.659
in the next generation

00:32:06.659 --> 00:32:09.599
because all they heard was murmur and murmur.

00:32:09.599 --> 00:32:12.179
We hate this bread.

00:32:12.179 --> 00:32:14.739
They murmured all the time.

00:32:14.739 --> 00:32:18.139
See, Paul says do all things.

00:32:18.139 --> 00:32:21.019
Okay, that's pretty inclusive, is it not?

00:32:21.019 --> 00:32:22.699
I mean everything, right?

00:32:22.719 --> 00:32:29.719
I mean all things without murmurings and disputings.

00:32:29.719 --> 00:32:34.019
How is my speech characterized?

00:32:34.019 --> 00:32:36.599
I think about the way in which our speech

00:32:36.599 --> 00:32:40.359
could be used to sow discord.

00:32:40.359 --> 00:32:42.999
The Bible speaks about unity in the church of God

00:32:42.999 --> 00:32:45.039
and I'm so thankful that we can have unity

00:32:45.039 --> 00:32:48.379
because we embrace the same truth.

00:32:48.379 --> 00:32:49.759
Paul said to the believers in Ephesus

00:32:49.759 --> 00:32:51.959
that we're endeavoring to keep the unity

00:32:51.979 --> 00:32:54.699
of the Spirit and the bond of peace.

00:32:54.699 --> 00:32:56.259
But it's interesting as you would think about

00:32:56.259 --> 00:32:58.659
the subject matter of sowing discord.

00:32:58.659 --> 00:33:01.339
God says in Proverbs 6,

00:33:01.339 --> 00:33:04.379
how we can sow discord is absolutely with our mouth,

00:33:04.379 --> 00:33:05.659
with our speech,

00:33:05.659 --> 00:33:08.699
and it says that God hates it.

00:33:08.699 --> 00:33:10.339
He hates it.

00:33:10.339 --> 00:33:12.299
That's serious language.

00:33:12.299 --> 00:33:15.939
Yea, these six things that the Lord hate,

00:33:15.939 --> 00:33:18.419
yea, seven is an abomination.

00:33:18.419 --> 00:33:20.739
Proverbs 6, verse 14,

00:33:20.739 --> 00:33:22.559
and then you look at verses 16 through 19.

00:33:22.559 --> 00:33:24.159
We don't have time to go there this morning.

00:33:24.159 --> 00:33:26.719
It is interesting that speaking the truth

00:33:26.719 --> 00:33:29.599
also is in that same text of scripture.

00:33:29.599 --> 00:33:30.579
He hates lying.

00:33:31.839 --> 00:33:34.839
By the way, it's part of the Ten Commandments.

00:33:34.839 --> 00:33:35.839
We speak the truth.

00:33:36.999 --> 00:33:39.399
So again, we kind of go through this process

00:33:39.399 --> 00:33:40.879
saying well I'm not really that bad

00:33:40.879 --> 00:33:42.519
because I haven't done all these things,

00:33:42.519 --> 00:33:44.279
but really when we think about the people of God

00:33:44.279 --> 00:33:47.119
and we think about all manner of conversation being holy,

00:33:47.119 --> 00:33:49.279
he's not just concerned about these big areas,

00:33:49.299 --> 00:33:51.779
he's concerned about every area.

00:33:51.779 --> 00:33:54.019
Notice with me, not only my speech,

00:33:54.019 --> 00:33:56.239
but I think about my associations.

00:33:57.239 --> 00:33:58.139
My associations.

00:33:58.139 --> 00:33:59.059
Notice what Paul says.

00:33:59.059 --> 00:34:00.619
Turn to the book of 2 Corinthians, if you will,

00:34:00.619 --> 00:34:01.979
in chapter number six.

00:34:03.359 --> 00:34:04.419
It's interesting because really

00:34:04.419 --> 00:34:05.739
in this same passage of scripture

00:34:05.739 --> 00:34:07.979
in 2 Corinthians 6, 14 through chapter seven

00:34:07.979 --> 00:34:09.299
in verse number one,

00:34:09.299 --> 00:34:11.539
you can see really the entirety of the message

00:34:11.539 --> 00:34:13.059
that we're preaching this morning

00:34:13.059 --> 00:34:14.939
with regard to this process.

00:34:14.939 --> 00:34:15.779
Number one, review.

00:34:15.779 --> 00:34:17.319
Number two, recognize.

00:34:17.319 --> 00:34:19.059
Notice what he says in verse number 14

00:34:19.879 --> 00:34:20.699
of 2 Corinthians 6.

00:34:20.699 --> 00:34:23.279
Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers.

00:34:23.279 --> 00:34:25.879
For what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness?

00:34:25.879 --> 00:34:27.999
What communion hath light with darkness?

00:34:27.999 --> 00:34:30.559
What concord hath Christ with Belial?

00:34:30.559 --> 00:34:34.079
Or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?

00:34:34.079 --> 00:34:35.719
These questions are posed this way

00:34:35.719 --> 00:34:39.499
to help the believer understand there's no union.

00:34:39.499 --> 00:34:42.759
There's no association that should be made.

00:34:42.759 --> 00:34:44.119
And he says this in verse 16.

00:34:44.119 --> 00:34:46.999
What agreement hath the temple of God with idols?

00:34:47.939 --> 00:34:50.339
For ye are the temple of the living God.

00:34:50.339 --> 00:34:52.459
As God hath said, I will dwell in them and walk in them

00:34:52.459 --> 00:34:54.379
and I will be their God and they shall be my people.

00:34:54.379 --> 00:34:57.539
Wherefore, based upon this principle, what are you to do?

00:34:57.539 --> 00:35:00.699
Come out from among them and be ye separate,

00:35:00.699 --> 00:35:01.899
saith the Lord.

00:35:01.899 --> 00:35:03.899
He then gives these wonderful promises.

00:35:03.899 --> 00:35:05.739
He says this, and touch not the unclean thing

00:35:05.739 --> 00:35:08.939
and I will receive you and will be a father unto you

00:35:08.939 --> 00:35:10.459
and you shall be my sons and daughters,

00:35:10.459 --> 00:35:11.699
saith the Lord Almighty.

00:35:11.699 --> 00:35:13.739
You understand that at the end of verse number 17

00:35:13.739 --> 00:35:16.619
in verse 18, again, Paul's writing to the church

00:35:16.959 --> 00:35:19.119
in Corinth, he's writing to believers there in Corinth,

00:35:19.119 --> 00:35:21.199
and what he's saying to them is not that you're gonna be

00:35:21.199 --> 00:35:24.879
saved, it's that you're gonna have that fellowship.

00:35:24.879 --> 00:35:26.559
Because you've done these things,

00:35:26.559 --> 00:35:27.879
you've come out from among them

00:35:27.879 --> 00:35:28.879
and you've been ye separate.

00:35:28.879 --> 00:35:31.679
Listen, when I'm living a life of sin,

00:35:31.679 --> 00:35:33.239
when I'm allowing sin in my life

00:35:33.239 --> 00:35:35.319
and I'm not examining, I'm not dealing with it,

00:35:35.319 --> 00:35:38.879
my fellowship with my God is hindered.

00:35:38.879 --> 00:35:40.559
He's still my God.

00:35:40.559 --> 00:35:42.399
I'm thankful for that.

00:35:42.399 --> 00:35:46.819
He's still my Savior, but my fellowship is hindered.

00:35:46.819 --> 00:35:51.819
We find that he says that these associations are important

00:35:53.419 --> 00:35:56.659
and we're not to be, be ye not unequally yoked

00:35:56.659 --> 00:36:00.059
together with unbelievers, and he goes through the list.

00:36:00.059 --> 00:36:01.819
I think about what I read, what I watch,

00:36:01.819 --> 00:36:04.459
what I listen to, my speech, my associations.

00:36:04.459 --> 00:36:07.219
I would say this, what about my attire?

00:36:07.219 --> 00:36:08.899
It's kind of interesting because so often

00:36:08.899 --> 00:36:12.439
it's a subject matter that people don't like to deal with.

00:36:12.439 --> 00:36:13.599
But you know something that's interesting,

00:36:13.599 --> 00:36:14.599
I was thinking about it this week

00:36:14.599 --> 00:36:16.899
and I actually heard somebody on American Family Radio

00:36:16.899 --> 00:36:19.079
deal with it, and it was quite interesting

00:36:19.079 --> 00:36:21.119
how they dealt with it, and they even addressed it

00:36:21.119 --> 00:36:23.759
in the same manner, that for some reason

00:36:23.759 --> 00:36:26.679
in our churches today, we don't like to talk about attire.

00:36:26.679 --> 00:36:28.919
But you know, every company I ever worked with

00:36:28.919 --> 00:36:32.039
or worked for had a dress code.

00:36:32.039 --> 00:36:32.939
Every single one.

00:36:34.039 --> 00:36:36.799
Every school that I went to had a dress code.

00:36:36.799 --> 00:36:39.979
Now they varied, admittedly.

00:36:39.979 --> 00:36:42.499
Something that's a super interesting study,

00:36:43.379 --> 00:36:45.299
and I say that it's a super interesting study

00:36:45.299 --> 00:36:47.419
from my perspective, you might have no interest

00:36:47.419 --> 00:36:49.779
in it whatsoever, you might think it's just dumb,

00:36:49.779 --> 00:36:51.579
and that's fine, you can have your opinion,

00:36:51.579 --> 00:36:53.299
I'm entitled to my opinion.

00:36:53.299 --> 00:36:56.499
But a fascinating study to me was when I went to England

00:36:56.499 --> 00:36:59.539
when my brother lived there a couple of years ago,

00:36:59.539 --> 00:37:01.099
he was there for three years and we had the privilege

00:37:01.099 --> 00:37:03.639
of going and visiting, it was an interesting,

00:37:03.639 --> 00:37:05.179
fascinating study to study some things

00:37:05.279 --> 00:37:06.479
about the royal family.

00:37:07.759 --> 00:37:09.839
And you know the royal family has an extremely

00:37:09.839 --> 00:37:11.219
detailed dress code.

00:37:12.079 --> 00:37:13.419
I mean, big time.

00:37:14.259 --> 00:37:16.079
Go look it up, it's fascinating.

00:37:17.119 --> 00:37:19.579
And it's not just for females, it's for males as well.

00:37:19.579 --> 00:37:21.079
I mean, you're part of the royal family.

00:37:21.079 --> 00:37:23.099
There's a certain expectation.

00:37:23.099 --> 00:37:24.599
Can I tell you this morning that you're part

00:37:24.599 --> 00:37:27.059
of a greater royal family?

00:37:27.059 --> 00:37:30.099
Here's what Peter says, we're in 1 Peter chapter number one

00:37:30.099 --> 00:37:32.079
for our text of scripture this morning,

00:37:32.079 --> 00:37:34.679
but I want you to understand that Peter will go on to say

00:37:35.199 --> 00:37:36.899
in chapter number two in verse number nine,

00:37:36.899 --> 00:37:41.199
but ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood,

00:37:41.199 --> 00:37:43.539
and a holy nation, a peculiar people that you should

00:37:43.539 --> 00:37:46.119
show forth the praises of him who hath called you

00:37:46.119 --> 00:37:48.619
out of darkness into his marvelous light.

00:37:48.619 --> 00:37:50.699
What a joy to understand.

00:37:50.699 --> 00:37:53.659
I think about the Old Testament example in 2 Samuel

00:37:53.659 --> 00:37:57.239
where David said I want to show the kindness of the Lord.

00:37:57.239 --> 00:37:59.939
Are there any left of the house of Jonathan?

00:37:59.939 --> 00:38:01.979
And there was one Mephibosheth, but he was down

00:38:01.979 --> 00:38:03.799
in Lodabar and he says bring him to me.

00:38:03.819 --> 00:38:07.699
I'm gonna make him as one of the king's sons.

00:38:07.699 --> 00:38:09.079
If you've been saved this morning,

00:38:09.079 --> 00:38:12.759
you are adopted by the king of kings and lord of lords.

00:38:12.759 --> 00:38:16.219
Our father is the god of the universe

00:38:16.219 --> 00:38:19.779
and we are his children and we are part of a royal family.

00:38:19.779 --> 00:38:22.139
And can I tell you that the Bible deals with attire.

00:38:22.139 --> 00:38:23.619
The Bible addresses it.

00:38:23.619 --> 00:38:26.279
Notice with me in 1 Timothy chapter number one,

00:38:26.279 --> 00:38:28.799
notice what Paul is telling Timothy here

00:38:28.799 --> 00:38:31.159
in the passage of scripture and he's dealing with things

00:38:31.159 --> 00:38:35.399
with regard to the church and all that's going on there.

00:38:35.399 --> 00:38:37.479
I said chapter number one, sorry, chapter number two.

00:38:37.479 --> 00:38:39.439
And I want you to notice in chapter number two

00:38:39.439 --> 00:38:43.079
in verses nine and 10, notice what he says.

00:38:43.079 --> 00:38:46.099
In like manner also that women adorn themselves

00:38:46.099 --> 00:38:49.939
in modest apparel with shamefacedness and sobriety,

00:38:49.939 --> 00:38:52.739
not with braided hair or gold or pearls or costly array,

00:38:52.739 --> 00:38:56.539
but which becometh women professing godliness

00:38:56.539 --> 00:38:58.219
with good works.

00:38:58.219 --> 00:39:00.019
I understand that the era in which we live in

00:39:00.019 --> 00:39:03.039
is a different era than when the Bible was written.

00:39:03.039 --> 00:39:04.219
It's very interesting, by the way,

00:39:04.219 --> 00:39:05.659
if you read in the book of Proverbs

00:39:05.659 --> 00:39:07.499
and really look at the Old Testament,

00:39:07.499 --> 00:39:09.419
in Proverbs chapter number seven in particular,

00:39:09.419 --> 00:39:12.579
it talks about the attire of an harlot.

00:39:12.579 --> 00:39:14.539
Won't deal with that whole subject matter this morning,

00:39:14.539 --> 00:39:18.059
but the reality is that their attire was sending a message.

00:39:18.959 --> 00:39:21.819
And this morning, we have two daughters and I have a wife,

00:39:21.819 --> 00:39:24.259
praise the Lord, and I got a son

00:39:24.259 --> 00:39:25.779
and I'm thankful for all of them.

00:39:25.779 --> 00:39:27.819
But I've said to my girls often,

00:39:27.819 --> 00:39:29.979
listen, the subject matter of modesty

00:39:29.979 --> 00:39:32.019
is an important subject matter.

00:39:32.019 --> 00:39:34.219
And I understand that as teenage girls,

00:39:34.219 --> 00:39:36.219
you wanna, and I've said this to them,

00:39:36.219 --> 00:39:38.779
you wanna be cute, you wanna wear something that's cute,

00:39:38.779 --> 00:39:42.739
but you cannot, you cannot, you must not

00:39:42.739 --> 00:39:45.659
sacrifice modesty for cuteness.

00:39:47.779 --> 00:39:49.939
It's just not appropriate.

00:39:49.939 --> 00:39:52.699
And so therefore, we find that as we would go through

00:39:52.699 --> 00:39:54.979
this evaluation, we're reviewing,

00:39:54.979 --> 00:39:56.459
we're saying all manner of conversation,

00:39:56.459 --> 00:39:58.019
I wanna recognize some things.

00:39:58.019 --> 00:40:01.019
And so I think about my attire, I think about my finances.

00:40:01.019 --> 00:40:03.679
I heard a preacher just last week, I was at a preacher's meeting,

00:40:03.679 --> 00:40:08.439
he said this, give me your checkbook and I'll tell you what's important to you.

00:40:08.439 --> 00:40:13.199
I think about finances. God's Word says a lot about finances, by the way.

00:40:13.199 --> 00:40:21.239
You know, in Malachi, they were receiving rebuke because they were robbing God.

00:40:21.239 --> 00:40:24.499
How are we robbing God? In tithes and offerings.

00:40:24.499 --> 00:40:27.039
God goes on to say, prove me.

00:40:27.039 --> 00:40:29.719
Luke says, give and it shall be given.

00:40:29.839 --> 00:40:31.759
And he goes through that whole process.

00:40:31.759 --> 00:40:34.919
Listen, we don't give so that we can get something from God.

00:40:34.919 --> 00:40:39.639
We give because we recognize all of it already belongs to God.

00:40:39.639 --> 00:40:41.639
And He's been so very good to us.

00:40:41.639 --> 00:40:43.839
And what a privilege to be able to give back to Him.

00:40:43.839 --> 00:40:47.899
I think about what Jesus said in Matthew chapter number 6.

00:40:47.899 --> 00:40:54.399
In Matthew chapter number 6, verses 20 and 21, Jesus says this.

00:40:54.399 --> 00:40:58.119
I'll read verse number 19 along with it.

00:40:58.139 --> 00:41:02.679
In Matthew 6, verses 19 through 21.

00:41:02.679 --> 00:41:06.819
Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt,

00:41:06.819 --> 00:41:11.319
and where thieves break through and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven,

00:41:11.319 --> 00:41:15.499
where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal.

00:41:15.499 --> 00:41:21.659
For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.

00:41:21.659 --> 00:41:25.039
I want God to evaluate my finances.

00:41:25.039 --> 00:41:28.159
I think about this, my prayer life.

00:41:28.159 --> 00:41:31.259
The sin of prayerlessness.

00:41:31.259 --> 00:41:33.199
The fact of the matter is that Samuel says this.

00:41:33.199 --> 00:41:36.879
You don't need to turn there, but it's a powerful statement that Samuel makes.

00:41:36.879 --> 00:41:40.119
Of course, he's grieved in his heart because the nation wants a king.

00:41:40.119 --> 00:41:42.559
And he goes through that whole process and God gives him instruction.

00:41:42.559 --> 00:41:45.719
Of course, we understand that Saul is anointed to be the first king of Israel.

00:41:45.719 --> 00:41:48.839
But Samuel says this in 1 Samuel 12, in verse number 23.

00:41:48.839 --> 00:41:52.839
Moreover, ask for me, God forbid, that I should sin against the Lord in ceasing to

00:41:52.839 --> 00:41:55.759
pray for you.

00:41:55.759 --> 00:41:56.759
The sin of prayerlessness.

00:41:56.759 --> 00:41:57.759
We're busy.

00:41:57.759 --> 00:41:58.759
We don't have time.

00:41:58.759 --> 00:42:03.439
How's my prayer life?

00:42:03.439 --> 00:42:07.679
See I want to be able to recognize these things as I review and I'm recognizing, okay, God,

00:42:07.679 --> 00:42:08.679
I need some work there.

00:42:08.679 --> 00:42:09.679
Okay, God, I need some work here.

00:42:09.679 --> 00:42:11.399
Okay, God, there's a problem here.

00:42:11.399 --> 00:42:12.399
There's a problem there.

00:42:12.399 --> 00:42:15.199
I want to be able to recognize those problems.

00:42:15.199 --> 00:42:19.679
I think about my being engaged in sharing my faith.

00:42:19.679 --> 00:42:21.879
God says that we are ambassadors.

00:42:21.879 --> 00:42:24.039
We are his representatives.

00:42:24.039 --> 00:42:27.439
God says that we're to go and preach the gospel to every creature.

00:42:27.439 --> 00:42:30.879
I don't know how you feel right now, but I know I feel, I shared with somebody on the

00:42:30.879 --> 00:42:37.039
phone last night, I feel so twisted up inside that I can't go freely knock on somebody's

00:42:37.039 --> 00:42:40.199
door and share the gospel with them.

00:42:40.199 --> 00:42:45.039
Because we're living during a time where people, I don't think, are very kind towards me knocking

00:42:45.039 --> 00:42:48.719
on their door with all of the current pandemic and everything that's going on.

00:42:48.719 --> 00:42:52.559
And we're trying to be aware of those things and be wise with regard to those things.

00:42:52.559 --> 00:42:56.319
But man, I love being able to engage people and speaking with them about the gospel.

00:42:56.319 --> 00:42:59.119
Admittedly, I don't do it as often as I should.

00:42:59.119 --> 00:43:03.839
But can I tell you when something's removed from us, it gives us that much of a greater

00:43:03.839 --> 00:43:07.599
appreciation and longing for it.

00:43:07.599 --> 00:43:10.119
How's my witnessing?

00:43:10.119 --> 00:43:15.399
I really think this, when I consider all of these things, and again, it's not an exhaustive

00:43:15.399 --> 00:43:16.399
list.

00:43:16.399 --> 00:43:18.719
You can add plenty of things to it.

00:43:18.719 --> 00:43:20.959
But really, I boil down the principle to being this.

00:43:20.959 --> 00:43:24.559
It's a principle that you find in Ephesians 4 and also in Colossians 3.

00:43:24.559 --> 00:43:29.499
And it's this principle, put off, put on.

00:43:29.499 --> 00:43:30.839
Because of who I am.

00:43:30.839 --> 00:43:32.399
Because I've been redeemed.

00:43:32.399 --> 00:43:35.039
Because I'm adopted into the family of God.

00:43:35.039 --> 00:43:36.919
Because I am part of his family.

00:43:36.919 --> 00:43:38.119
I am his child.

00:43:38.119 --> 00:43:42.879
Here's some things I'm going to, this is how I'm going to behave, be holy in all manner

00:43:42.879 --> 00:43:43.879
of conversation.

00:43:43.879 --> 00:43:49.239
So as we go through our process, we have reviewed, we've recognized, okay, here's some things

00:43:49.239 --> 00:43:50.519
I need to deal with.

00:43:50.519 --> 00:43:53.359
And we come to number three, resolve.

00:43:53.359 --> 00:43:54.359
Resolve it.

00:43:54.359 --> 00:43:55.839
I mean, deal with it.

00:43:55.839 --> 00:44:00.599
The reality is that we don't identify it just so that we can say, yeah, there's a problem

00:44:00.599 --> 00:44:01.599
there.

00:44:01.599 --> 00:44:04.919
We identify it so that we can resolve it.

00:44:04.919 --> 00:44:08.279
One thing that I said often when I worked in the corporate world, and it carries right

00:44:08.279 --> 00:44:13.479
over into the church work, is that there are a lot of problem identifiers and very few

00:44:13.479 --> 00:44:15.479
problem solvers.

00:44:15.479 --> 00:44:17.399
Amen?

00:44:17.399 --> 00:44:20.339
I mean, you find it all over the world.

00:44:20.339 --> 00:44:24.759
This morning, I made a commitment when I worked in the corporate world that I might not have

00:44:24.759 --> 00:44:29.499
the right answer to the problem, but I would never take a problem to my boss without also

00:44:29.499 --> 00:44:31.319
taking a solution.

00:44:31.319 --> 00:44:33.359
It may not be the solution that they take.

00:44:33.799 --> 00:44:37.759
It might be dumb, but I'm going to try my best to come up with a solution.

00:44:37.759 --> 00:44:38.759
Why?

00:44:38.759 --> 00:44:41.479
Because I didn't want to just be a problem identifier.

00:44:41.479 --> 00:44:46.519
So this morning, if I go through this process of self-examination, if I'm reviewing, if

00:44:46.519 --> 00:44:50.719
I'm recognizing some areas now, I need to resolve those things.

00:44:50.719 --> 00:44:53.199
I need to deal with it.

00:44:53.199 --> 00:44:58.399
God in His grace and His mercy has allowed it to be exposed, has allowed it to be revealed.

00:44:58.399 --> 00:44:59.399
Why?

00:44:59.399 --> 00:45:01.959
So that I would deal with it.

00:45:01.959 --> 00:45:04.599
It's a reference back to what we said in the very beginning of the message with regard

00:45:04.599 --> 00:45:07.879
to the revivals in Judah.

00:45:07.879 --> 00:45:12.159
They heard the word of the Lord, and Josiah responded, he said, there's some things we

00:45:12.159 --> 00:45:13.159
need to change.

00:45:13.159 --> 00:45:17.039
Jehoshaphat said, there's some things that need to be cleansed, there's some things that

00:45:17.039 --> 00:45:18.759
need to be done.

00:45:18.759 --> 00:45:23.199
And this morning, I say, I want to resolve the issues.

00:45:23.199 --> 00:45:25.839
I want to confess and forsake.

00:45:25.839 --> 00:45:27.759
I think about a great example.

00:45:27.759 --> 00:45:31.039
Come to the book of Acts in chapter 19, if you will.

00:45:31.039 --> 00:45:37.199
Here in Acts chapter 19, really what we're seeing is the revival in Ephesus.

00:45:37.199 --> 00:45:42.399
I mean, it's a powerful passage of Scripture, but I want you to see and consider with me

00:45:42.399 --> 00:45:48.119
this morning the example of this church, and I want you to see how they resolved the issues,

00:45:48.119 --> 00:45:53.239
how the word of the Lord went forth, and how they responded as they were able to identify

00:45:53.239 --> 00:45:55.639
some things that needed to be addressed.

00:45:55.639 --> 00:45:59.199
Verse number 17 in Acts 19, the Bible says, and this was known to all the Jews and Greeks

00:45:59.199 --> 00:46:01.479
also dwelling at Ephesus.

00:46:01.479 --> 00:46:07.319
And fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified, and many that

00:46:07.319 --> 00:46:11.199
believed came and confessed and showed their deeds.

00:46:11.199 --> 00:46:16.639
Notice verse 19, many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together.

00:46:16.639 --> 00:46:17.839
What did they do?

00:46:17.839 --> 00:46:23.239
And burned them before all men.

00:46:23.239 --> 00:46:27.519
They counted the price of them and found it 15,000 pieces of silver.

00:46:27.519 --> 00:46:30.279
And look at the result of what happened.

00:46:30.279 --> 00:46:34.959
So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.

00:46:34.959 --> 00:46:38.179
I'm thankful they resolved the issues.

00:46:38.179 --> 00:46:41.519
That they didn't just have their toes stepped on and say, well, that's okay, that's just

00:46:41.519 --> 00:46:42.839
what the preacher thinks.

00:46:42.839 --> 00:46:46.239
That's just Paul getting on his little thing and whatever, we'll just keep on going along.

00:46:46.239 --> 00:46:50.759
Well, then the word of God's not going to grow and multiply and prevail.

00:46:50.759 --> 00:46:55.039
Because God, listen, I believe that God wants to send revival, but the question is are we

00:46:55.039 --> 00:46:57.079
revival ready?

00:46:57.079 --> 00:46:59.399
The question is, is there anything?

00:46:59.399 --> 00:47:01.159
There's nothing between my soul and my Savior's.

00:47:01.159 --> 00:47:06.439
There's something that I know that God has confronted me about from His word, and I say,

00:47:06.439 --> 00:47:07.439
yeah, I'm not going to deal with that.

00:47:07.439 --> 00:47:10.759
I like that more than this, and whatever the situation is, no.

00:47:10.759 --> 00:47:11.759
We say, I surrender.

00:47:11.759 --> 00:47:12.759
I'm giving it all to God.

00:47:12.759 --> 00:47:16.759
I want God's favor and God's blessing.

00:47:16.759 --> 00:47:23.319
Nothing, nothing is worth forfeiting His blessing and His favor.

00:47:23.319 --> 00:47:25.119
Nothing is worth it.

00:47:25.119 --> 00:47:29.599
And this morning, I see that the Bible says that they burned them before all men.

00:47:29.599 --> 00:47:31.199
I remember when my dad got saved.

00:47:31.199 --> 00:47:34.399
Now young people in here, you're probably not going to remember cassette tapes, but

00:47:34.399 --> 00:47:36.399
y'all older folks, you remember cassette tapes.

00:47:36.399 --> 00:47:37.399
You remember A-tracks.

00:47:37.399 --> 00:47:38.759
I don't even remember those things.

00:47:38.759 --> 00:47:39.759
And then records.

00:47:39.759 --> 00:47:40.959
I remember the first time Breonna saw a record.

00:47:40.959 --> 00:47:42.439
She said, what in the world is that?

00:47:42.439 --> 00:47:44.479
I said, you play music on that thing.

00:47:44.479 --> 00:47:45.999
And she's like, really?

00:47:46.239 --> 00:47:52.559
I said, it's like a big CD, but it holds only a fraction of what a CD holds, you know?

00:47:52.559 --> 00:47:56.959
But the reality is, I remember when my dad got saved, and I remember he had a bunch of

00:47:56.959 --> 00:48:04.639
tapes of music that somehow, through the preaching of the Word of God and the Spirit of God,

00:48:04.639 --> 00:48:08.039
convicting him that that music wasn't appropriate for a believer.

00:48:08.039 --> 00:48:09.039
Am I right?

00:48:09.039 --> 00:48:10.039
Okay.

00:48:10.039 --> 00:48:12.079
I remember what he did.

00:48:12.159 --> 00:48:16.159
He took all those cassette tapes, and he didn't take them down to somewhere and sell them

00:48:16.159 --> 00:48:20.599
and try to get money for them, though he could have.

00:48:20.599 --> 00:48:22.799
But what he thought was that it's not right for me.

00:48:22.799 --> 00:48:28.039
I don't want to give that to somebody else, even if I'm going to profit from it.

00:48:28.039 --> 00:48:31.559
I remember him taking those cassette tapes, and young people, you've got to realize how

00:48:31.559 --> 00:48:35.399
that all that stuff would come out of the cassette tape, right?

00:48:35.399 --> 00:48:36.879
It was always a mess, man.

00:48:36.879 --> 00:48:39.559
You try to get pencils and fix it and what have you.

00:48:39.559 --> 00:48:42.519
But he took all those things, and I remember him tearing them all up and throwing them

00:48:42.519 --> 00:48:43.519
in the garbage.

00:48:43.519 --> 00:48:48.519
He didn't burn them, but he disposed of them.

00:48:48.519 --> 00:48:52.439
And he disposed of them in such a way that even if he had second thoughts later and said,

00:48:52.439 --> 00:48:55.919
well, I really like that one song, I think I'm going to go back and get it, he's going

00:48:55.919 --> 00:49:00.079
to have to pay money to buy it again, amen, because he destroyed it.

00:49:00.079 --> 00:49:04.119
And I'm saying to you that when I look at what happened here in Ephesus, this is a proper

00:49:04.119 --> 00:49:05.119
response.

00:49:05.719 --> 00:49:11.399
They said, we don't want to just have the issue identified, we want to resolve it.

00:49:11.399 --> 00:49:15.119
We don't want to just recognize it, we want to deal with it.

00:49:15.119 --> 00:49:20.559
I think about what we read in 2 Corinthians 6, we read the latter part of the chapter,

00:49:20.559 --> 00:49:25.999
but in chapter number 7 and verse number 1, the Bible says this, Paul's instruction to

00:49:25.999 --> 00:49:32.439
the believers in Corinth was simply this, cleanse yourselves from all filthiness of

00:49:32.439 --> 00:49:36.279
the flesh and spirit.

00:49:36.279 --> 00:49:39.799
I'm thankful for the ministry of the Word of God.

00:49:39.799 --> 00:49:43.879
Paul deals with it in the book of Ephesians, how that we are cleansed.

00:49:43.879 --> 00:49:48.879
Notice in Ephesians 5 and verse 26, that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing

00:49:48.879 --> 00:49:51.679
of water by the Word.

00:49:51.679 --> 00:50:00.679
See, I believe that when we resolve the issue, that we also need to put in some protections.

00:50:00.679 --> 00:50:01.179
We need to make...

00:50:01.179 --> 00:50:07.619
ourselves accountable. I think of a company that has an audit. The auditor

00:50:07.619 --> 00:50:11.099
comes in, the auditor reviews, the auditor recognizes some areas that have

00:50:11.099 --> 00:50:14.499
problems, and the auditor says, hey these things need to be resolved, and by the

00:50:14.499 --> 00:50:21.739
way, you need to put some things in place to prevent this from happening again. And

00:50:21.739 --> 00:50:25.339
so for us as God's people, when we're gonna resolve something, I believe that

00:50:25.339 --> 00:50:29.919
there is an important aspect of accountability and establishing some

00:50:29.919 --> 00:50:36.079
protections in our life, in our lives. This morning we go through the process

00:50:36.079 --> 00:50:41.519
of examine yourselves, this process of self-examination. We review, we recognize,

00:50:41.519 --> 00:50:45.999
we resolve, and I want you to consider with me the result this this morning, the

00:50:45.999 --> 00:50:51.039
result of going through this process. The Bible tells us, as I mentioned already in

00:50:51.039 --> 00:50:56.559
Romans chapter 14 and verse number 12, so then every one of us shall give account

00:50:56.559 --> 00:51:02.039
of himself to God. In my mind this morning, and I hope that you can follow

00:51:02.039 --> 00:51:09.839
my logic, that we come full circle. As to the why of the review, we come full circle

00:51:09.839 --> 00:51:15.439
back to the result of the process, is that now God's people can be properly

00:51:15.439 --> 00:51:22.519
prepared to give an account. I think it's advantageous that someone would care

00:51:22.519 --> 00:51:28.479
enough, that God would care enough to give us in his Word the truth that we

00:51:28.479 --> 00:51:33.879
will stand before him, but also the manner in which we can be prepared to

00:51:33.879 --> 00:51:38.719
stand before him. Admittedly, I don't know that any of us would say, I'm fully

00:51:38.719 --> 00:51:44.719
prepared, I'm gonna, I'm ready to do it right now, because it's a fearful thing.

00:51:44.719 --> 00:51:49.599
But this morning, I want you to consider, we don't have time, we're out of time

00:51:49.599 --> 00:51:53.839
this morning, but I want you to consider something that God tells us in his Word

00:51:53.839 --> 00:51:58.959
here in Ephesians 5. We read about the cleansing in verse number 26, in verse

00:51:58.959 --> 00:52:01.999
number 27 he says that he might present it to himself, he's speaking about the

00:52:01.999 --> 00:52:07.319
church, a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but

00:52:07.319 --> 00:52:12.119
that it should be holy and without blemish. We read the same truth in the

00:52:12.119 --> 00:52:17.839
book of Colossians, we reference James 1 as being the fact that we're to use the

00:52:18.239 --> 00:52:24.879
Word of God as the standard by which we do the review, the process by which we

00:52:24.879 --> 00:52:29.599
review our lives, the standard must be the Word of God. But a couple of verses

00:52:29.599 --> 00:52:33.759
later in the book of James in the first chapter, in verse number 27, it says pure

00:52:33.759 --> 00:52:38.239
religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, to visit the

00:52:38.239 --> 00:52:42.839
fatherless and widows in their affliction and to keep himself unspotted

00:52:42.879 --> 00:52:49.319
from the world. John says in first John 2, love not the world, neither the things

00:52:49.319 --> 00:52:53.519
that are in the world. I think about this and we'll close here, turn to the book of

00:52:53.519 --> 00:53:02.599
Revelation if you will, in chapter number 19. At the end of chapter 19, really I'll

00:53:02.599 --> 00:53:06.519
say the middle portion of chapter 19, is you see the return of Christ, the advent

00:53:06.519 --> 00:53:12.839
of Christ, when he comes back with us, with his bride. See in Revelation

00:53:12.839 --> 00:53:15.959
chapter number 4, you see the picture of the rapture where the church is caught

00:53:15.959 --> 00:53:20.519
up and you find the tribulation period recorded and revealed in those next

00:53:20.519 --> 00:53:23.839
several chapters throughout the book of Revelation and all of the judgments that

00:53:23.839 --> 00:53:27.479
are poured out. You come to chapter 19 and there's a reference that we're

00:53:27.479 --> 00:53:31.919
going to deal with with regard to the marriage supper of the Lamb and then you

00:53:31.919 --> 00:53:35.999
look at the advent of Christ, that he comes back not as the Lamb of God but as

00:53:35.999 --> 00:53:41.439
the Lion of the tribe of Judah and he comes back and we come with them and of

00:53:41.439 --> 00:53:45.359
course we understand that he's going to establish his millennial reign and what

00:53:45.359 --> 00:53:49.439
a joy that is, but I want you to focus just for a moment this morning on this

00:53:49.439 --> 00:53:55.479
truth with regard to the marriage supper of the Lamb. In verse number

00:53:55.479 --> 00:53:59.959
seven, now you understand biblically speaking that God refers to himself as

00:53:59.959 --> 00:54:03.399
the Bridegroom, the Lord Jesus Christ is the Bridegroom and the church is the

00:54:03.399 --> 00:54:08.079
Bride. We just looked at that just a moment ago in Ephesians 5 and we see

00:54:08.079 --> 00:54:12.239
that that example, that relationship is referenced many times

00:54:12.239 --> 00:54:16.119
throughout the scriptures and now we come to Revelation 19 in verse number

00:54:16.119 --> 00:54:21.659
7 and the Bible says, let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the

00:54:21.659 --> 00:54:27.399
marriage of the Lamb is come. It's going to happen one day, we don't know when

00:54:27.399 --> 00:54:30.759
it's going to happen but we know it's going to happen, but I want you to notice

00:54:30.759 --> 00:54:35.879
the latter part of the verse. The Bible says, and his wife, who's his wife? It's the

00:54:35.879 --> 00:54:44.759
church, the church is the Bride. His wife hath made herself ready. Now we

00:54:44.759 --> 00:54:49.639
understand marriages here upon our earth and we understand the process in which

00:54:49.639 --> 00:54:53.599
goes through for a marriage ceremony and we understand the preparation of the

00:54:53.599 --> 00:54:58.359
bride for the wedding ceremony. I've never gone through the preparation but

00:54:58.359 --> 00:55:00.639
there are plenty of times that I've been at weddings when you're kind of waiting

00:55:00.639 --> 00:55:03.679
around and saying, I wonder if this thing is going to happen or not. She's almost

00:55:03.679 --> 00:55:07.519
ready, you know, this kind of message gets sent back and what have you. She's

00:55:07.519 --> 00:55:13.519
preparing herself, she's readying herself for the ceremony. I wonder this morning

00:55:13.519 --> 00:55:18.959
how the Bride of Christ, the church, the church is made up of believers,

00:55:18.959 --> 00:55:23.119
individual believers, how are we preparing ourselves, how are we readying

00:55:23.119 --> 00:55:28.239
ourselves for that marriage supper of the Lamb? I believe this morning that we

00:55:28.239 --> 00:55:33.159
must examine ourselves. We must go through this process. I have to go

00:55:33.159 --> 00:55:38.199
through this process. I am sharing with you this morning my heart because I want

00:55:38.199 --> 00:55:41.679
you to go through this process because the reality is you're gonna stand before

00:55:41.679 --> 00:55:50.999
Christ one day. And I wonder this morning, as John says in first John, he talks

00:55:50.999 --> 00:55:58.119
about the fact that we have this confidence that he is going to appear, we

00:55:58.119 --> 00:56:02.439
know that he's going to appear, but he mentions how that there could be some

00:56:02.439 --> 00:56:08.039
that could be ashamed before him it is coming. And then of course he talks about

00:56:08.039 --> 00:56:12.039
in chapter 3 and verse number 3, and every man that hath this hope, what hope?

00:56:12.039 --> 00:56:17.419
The fact that he's going to come. We have that hope in us, we purify himself even

00:56:17.419 --> 00:56:23.299
as he is pure. Peter said this in first Peter, that we're to be obedient children,

00:56:23.299 --> 00:56:28.179
not fashioning ourselves according to our former lust, but he says that we're

00:56:28.179 --> 00:56:34.899
to be holy in all manner of conversation. God's concerned how we live our lives,

00:56:34.899 --> 00:56:40.739
and because we've been redeemed, because we've been bought with the precious

00:56:40.739 --> 00:56:46.819
blood of Christ, we have instruction on how we're to behave, how we're to walk, in

00:56:46.819 --> 00:56:52.699
this morning, I want to encourage you, examine yourself. I want to encourage

00:56:52.699 --> 00:56:57.619
myself, examine ourselves. I want you to know I'm not preaching this message to

00:56:57.619 --> 00:57:02.939
you, I'm preaching this message for all of us. God's already stepped on my toes,

00:57:02.939 --> 00:57:09.739
and I hope this morning that God, the Holy Spirit, would use his word to really

00:57:09.739 --> 00:57:15.739
help us come to that quiet place and say, Lord, I need to examine myself. And it

00:57:15.739 --> 00:57:20.779
needs to be honest, and it needs to be thorough, and the standard by which I

00:57:20.779 --> 00:57:27.539
review and examine my life has got to be your word. And God, as I go through this

00:57:27.539 --> 00:57:33.019
process, I want to recognize the areas of deficiency, the areas of sin in my life,

00:57:33.019 --> 00:57:37.179
the areas of things that need to be changed, and God, I'm gonna resolve those

00:57:37.179 --> 00:57:43.019
things with your help, by your grace, so that the result is that I can be

00:57:43.019 --> 00:57:48.659
prepared to give an account. Because as Paul said to the believers in Rome, we're

00:57:48.659 --> 00:57:55.939
going to give an account of himself to God. Let's pray. Father, we love you, we

00:57:55.939 --> 00:58:02.219
thank you for loving us. God, I thank you for your word this morning and the truth

00:58:02.219 --> 00:58:09.299
contained therein. Lord, I pray that the Holy Spirit of God would speak to hearts

00:58:09.299 --> 00:58:17.099
through your precious word. Help us this morning, God, to be doers of the word.

00:58:17.099 --> 00:58:27.819
Help us, God, to be thankful that your word confronts us. I pray that we would

00:58:27.819 --> 00:58:36.459
respond properly. Help me, Lord. Help each one that's present this morning. We want

00:58:36.459 --> 00:58:44.019
to be revival ready. More than that, I understand this morning, one day I'll

00:58:44.019 --> 00:58:52.859
stand before you. God, I want to be prepared for that day. And I trust that

00:58:52.859 --> 00:58:58.819
each one that's present this morning has the same heart attitude. We pray that

00:58:58.819 --> 00:59:03.259
you'd have your will in way, that you'd work as only you can. It's in Christ's name we

00:59:03.259 --> 00:59:06.979
pray. Would you stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed. I'm not going to go

00:59:06.979 --> 00:59:10.339
through a series of questions this morning. I'm just going to ask you to say

00:59:10.339 --> 00:59:16.059
yes to God. Just respond. Julianna is going to play quietly on the piano. As

00:59:16.059 --> 00:59:24.499
she does, the altar's open. Make your seat an altar. Let God have his way in your

00:59:24.499 --> 00:59:29.139
heart and life as Julianna plays.
