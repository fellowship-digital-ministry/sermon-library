1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
Acts chapter number 18 this evening.

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,159
As we continue to prepare for our missions conference,

3
00:00:05,159 --> 00:00:09,060
it starts on Saturday with our opportunity

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:12,279
to have our international banquet dinner

5
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:13,180
and looking forward to it.

6
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,600
I love missions conference.

7
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,720
I just really do.

8
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,180
I love revival meetings,

9
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:20,879
but there's something special about the missions conference

10
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:24,360
that almost has a mix of revival meeting

11
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,399
and also the exposure and the awareness

12
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:30,879
of world evangelization and the importance

13
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:33,240
of fulfilling our responsibility

14
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,840
and how we can be co-laborers together.

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,240
It's just an exciting time.

16
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,319
I absolutely love missions conference

17
00:00:39,319 --> 00:00:42,279
and I'm looking forward to with great anticipation

18
00:00:42,279 --> 00:00:44,180
of what God is going to do.

19
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:48,720
I find it vitally important that we are prepared spiritually

20
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,560
when we enter into these special meetings.

21
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,599
I was sharing with somebody even this afternoon

22
00:00:53,599 --> 00:00:56,400
that the first year, year and a half of pastoring,

23
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:00,680
I would always feel very conflicted

24
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,000
when we were entering into a season of a special meeting,

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,199
a missions conference or revival meeting,

26
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:09,239
and I felt like as I was praying about what to preach

27
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:10,959
that the Holy Spirit of God was leading me

28
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:13,819
into a direction with regard to preaching,

29
00:01:13,819 --> 00:01:16,400
but then I felt like I can't preach on those subjects

30
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,879
because that's what they're going to preach on.

31
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:21,559
That's what the evangelist is gonna be preaching on.

32
00:01:21,559 --> 00:01:23,559
That's what the missionary is gonna be preaching on

33
00:01:23,559 --> 00:01:26,080
and I would feel somewhat conflicted

34
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,639
and have this internal struggle, if you will,

35
00:01:29,639 --> 00:01:31,040
and I remember having a conversation

36
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,800
with Brother Palmer, Sean, a great friend, mentor of mine,

37
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,680
and he said this.

38
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,800
He worked in evangelism for years, he still does,

39
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,919
and he says, you know, the more work that a pastor does

40
00:01:40,919 --> 00:01:43,639
in preparing the congregation for a special meeting,

41
00:01:43,639 --> 00:01:46,519
the greater work that God is able to accomplish.

42
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:48,599
He said, what I found throughout the years of ministry

43
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:51,540
is that a church can either be revival resistant

44
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,919
or revival ready, and I thought that was quite interesting

45
00:01:54,919 --> 00:01:57,360
and it really gave me a sense of relief.

46
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,239
Of course, I desired to follow the leadership

47
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:00,080
of the Holy Spirit of God.

48
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,160
It was my brain that was getting in the way

49
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,400
and causing the conflict on whether I should

50
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,760
or shouldn't preach on those particular things,

51
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,080
and if you've not preached before,

52
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,039
you might not understand that,

53
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:12,679
but that's just something occasionally that you deal with,

54
00:02:12,679 --> 00:02:17,179
and so I desire personally, but I desire for our church

55
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:19,800
to be prepared for the special meetings.

56
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,199
I've talked to missionaries before

57
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:22,600
that they enter into a church

58
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:25,440
and they're telling me these firsthand accounts,

59
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,259
and so I'm just believing

60
00:02:27,259 --> 00:02:29,600
that what they're telling me is true,

61
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,059
and they enter into a church, they enter in,

62
00:02:33,059 --> 00:02:35,559
and there will be some members that will be standing

63
00:02:35,559 --> 00:02:37,399
in the foyer area, maybe on a porch

64
00:02:37,399 --> 00:02:38,960
or whatever the greeting area is

65
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,539
that the particular church has,

66
00:02:40,539 --> 00:02:43,600
and the members will say, oh, how are you today?

67
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,559
You know, what are you doing here?

68
00:02:44,559 --> 00:02:45,399
And they're like, well, we're here

69
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:47,479
for the missions conference,

70
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:48,919
and the members of the church are like,

71
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,839
oh, we're having a missions conference.

72
00:02:50,839 --> 00:02:53,600
They walk into the church and there's no sign whatsoever

73
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,380
that missions conference is gonna take place,

74
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:58,679
there's no flags or any kind of decor

75
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,240
that would give indication,

76
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:04,119
and missionaries have shared that type of story with me,

77
00:03:04,119 --> 00:03:06,960
and I just wonder in that situation,

78
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:11,960
no doubt that there's little to no spiritual preparation

79
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,759
on the part of the people to be ready

80
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:19,600
for what God is going to do in and through those services.

81
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,559
Over the last few weeks, we've looked at some things

82
00:03:21,559 --> 00:03:25,800
on Sunday night with regard to God has a plan.

83
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,059
We studied that, we understood that in the life of Moses.

84
00:03:29,059 --> 00:03:31,220
God's plan includes his people,

85
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:34,679
and what a blessing to know that God would use us.

86
00:03:34,679 --> 00:03:37,500
In fact, it's often overwhelming to think

87
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:42,339
that God would use us to accomplish his plan on this earth.

88
00:03:42,339 --> 00:03:45,039
Last week on Sunday night, we talked about we have a place,

89
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:47,279
and every man must be in his place.

90
00:03:47,279 --> 00:03:48,919
You have a place, I have a place,

91
00:03:49,279 --> 00:03:50,320
and we need to be in our place.

92
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,320
We need to be doing what God has called us to do,

93
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,960
and of course this morning, bringing people to Jesus,

94
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,600
looking at that passage in Mark chapter number two.

95
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,460
I hope to encourage you this evening from Acts 18,

96
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,039
we look in this portion of scripture,

97
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:07,100
and God provides us really with the timing

98
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,500
right as we enter into the beginning

99
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,059
of this portion of scripture

100
00:04:10,059 --> 00:04:13,000
with regard to Paul's second missionary journey

101
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,720
and his arrival in Corinth.

102
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,239
Now the Bible says in verse number one of Acts 18,

103
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,799
after these things, now understand that those three words,

104
00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:26,359
they convey a large message to us.

105
00:04:26,359 --> 00:04:30,519
After these things, well, what are these things?

106
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:31,359
We find that the Bible,

107
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,880
and we'll answer that question in just a moment,

108
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,040
but it says after these things,

109
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:39,040
Paul departed from Athens, notice, and came to Corinth.

110
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,040
The Bible tells us in verse number 10,

111
00:04:43,119 --> 00:04:44,959
for I am with thee.

112
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:47,359
You remember the promise that God gave to Moses?

113
00:04:47,359 --> 00:04:50,160
Certainly, I will be with thee.

114
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,440
God says to Paul, for I am with thee,

115
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,959
and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee.

116
00:04:55,959 --> 00:05:00,959
Notice the statement, for I have much people in this city.

117
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,559
I'm gonna preach a message this evening

118
00:05:02,559 --> 00:05:04,239
that I've simply entitled from verse number 10,

119
00:05:04,239 --> 00:05:07,799
I have much people in this city.

120
00:05:07,799 --> 00:05:09,160
As we look at the text of scripture,

121
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,420
we find that God provides us with timing,

122
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:14,040
that Paul departs from Athens and he arrives,

123
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,320
he came to Corinth.

124
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,019
We understand the second missionary journey,

125
00:05:17,019 --> 00:05:19,660
it begins at the end of Acts chapter 15.

126
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:22,320
At the end of Acts chapter 15, beginning in verse number 36,

127
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,140
and throughout the first several verses of chapter 16,

128
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:28,079
we find that Paul, on this second missionary journey,

129
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:31,019
his desire is to follow up with the churches

130
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:34,559
that were established during the first missionary journey.

131
00:05:34,559 --> 00:05:37,040
And we find that as those churches, what a great pattern,

132
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,959
by the way, of follow up and the importance

133
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:41,119
of following up with those churches,

134
00:05:41,119 --> 00:05:42,839
and they've been established,

135
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:44,359
and he goes back to minister,

136
00:05:44,359 --> 00:05:47,359
and we find that that portion of scripture covers that.

137
00:05:47,359 --> 00:05:50,359
We enter into verse number 11 of Acts chapter 16,

138
00:05:50,359 --> 00:05:52,239
and down through verse number 40,

139
00:05:52,239 --> 00:05:56,299
and God provides us with a record of the work at Philippi.

140
00:05:56,299 --> 00:05:59,839
Of course, we are familiar with the book of Philippians,

141
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:03,160
and the church that was established there in Philippi,

142
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,559
and we're mindful of the events

143
00:06:05,559 --> 00:06:07,720
with regard to the ministry in Philippi.

144
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,000
Of course, Paul and Silas, they were imprisoned,

145
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,359
and they're singing, and they're praising God,

146
00:06:13,359 --> 00:06:17,359
and at midnight, God delivers them miraculously,

147
00:06:17,359 --> 00:06:20,899
and the jailer, sirs, what must I do to be saved?

148
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:23,519
I mean, God was working and using them,

149
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:25,640
and how wonderful it is.

150
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,359
We enter into the 17th chapter,

151
00:06:28,359 --> 00:06:29,959
and we find that in Acts 17,

152
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:34,200
it begins with Paul and company going to Thessalonica.

153
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,239
As best we can tell, Paul and company

154
00:06:36,239 --> 00:06:37,839
are not in Thessalonica very long.

155
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:40,200
There's some opposition that comes up,

156
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,279
and of course, everywhere that Paul went preaching

157
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:46,320
with those that were with him and part of the team,

158
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,779
they always were met with conflict and controversy.

159
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:53,660
By the way, God's work is always going to be opposed.

160
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,440
We see that throughout history,

161
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,380
as you look throughout the scriptures,

162
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,760
God's work is regularly opposed,

163
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,440
and so they're there in Thessalonica.

164
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,200
They go over to Berea, and then we find

165
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:08,519
that Paul is transported down to Athens,

166
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:11,519
and we find that as Paul is moved down to Athens,

167
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:14,600
because of the trouble there in Thessalonica and Berea,

168
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,739
we find that Paul, really, if you were to look

169
00:07:16,739 --> 00:07:19,160
at the text of scripture there in chapter 17,

170
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,160
it seems as if Paul is going there

171
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,100
to have some type of rest, if you will,

172
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,820
some reprieve from all that's been taking place,

173
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,799
but we find that Paul, in Acts chapter number 17,

174
00:07:29,799 --> 00:07:32,839
the Bible tells us that he notices a city.

175
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:35,880
The city is Athens, and what the Bible tells us

176
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,959
about what he observed was that it was a city

177
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:42,480
that was wholly, entirely given to idolatry.

178
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,839
As he saw all of their images

179
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:47,679
and various things that they had there,

180
00:07:47,679 --> 00:07:50,519
we find that their superstition was there,

181
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:53,239
and we find that he found this altar,

182
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:55,359
and the altar that he mentioned specifically

183
00:07:55,359 --> 00:07:59,359
was an altar that had the inscription to the unknown God.

184
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:04,160
The Bible tells us that Paul, that he was stirred up

185
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,799
because he saw that this city was wholly given to idolatry,

186
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,239
and I hope this evening that just as Paul was stirred,

187
00:08:11,239 --> 00:08:14,200
that we too would be stirred, but we must understand

188
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,839
that the stirring must be followed up with some action.

189
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:22,760
It's not enough to just be stirred, to have that impact.

190
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,760
No, we must allow the Lord to use us

191
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,880
and allow that stirring to bring forth action in our lives,

192
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,459
and so he was stirred.

193
00:08:30,459 --> 00:08:33,640
The great statement of verse number 23 of Acts 17

194
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:38,640
is when he says, him declare I unto you.

195
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,000
What a great privilege we have

196
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,799
to declare the Lord Jesus Christ to a lost and dying world.

197
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:46,679
You know, there are some people

198
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:48,260
that you'll come in contact with

199
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:51,080
that they've only ever heard the name of our Savior

200
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,479
in a negative context.

201
00:08:53,479 --> 00:08:56,000
They've only ever heard the name of our Savior

202
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,320
used as a swear word.

203
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,039
They do not know our wonderful Savior,

204
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:06,400
and we have the privilege of declaring him to them.

205
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,799
It's awesome.

206
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:11,400
We find that after they're there in Athens

207
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,080
for a short period of time,

208
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,640
the stirring led to preaching, to declaring,

209
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,039
to making known the one true God,

210
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:21,359
and we come to Acts chapter number 18,

211
00:09:21,359 --> 00:09:23,559
and the Bible says after these things,

212
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:26,479
Paul departed from Athens and came to Corinth.

213
00:09:26,479 --> 00:09:27,960
Paul continues to serve the Lord.

214
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,200
He continues to move forward.

215
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,320
He continues to follow the path

216
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,440
that God has established for him.

217
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,799
He understood that God was not finished with him,

218
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:38,159
that God was still interested in using him,

219
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:39,799
and we look at the passage of scripture,

220
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:41,479
and it says in verse number two,

221
00:09:41,479 --> 00:09:44,960
notice it says, and found a certain Jew named Aquila,

222
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,200
born in Pontus, lately come from Italy

223
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,880
with his wife Priscilla,

224
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,179
because that Claudius had commanded all Jews

225
00:09:52,179 --> 00:09:55,880
to depart from Rome and came unto them.

226
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,320
And because he was of the same craft,

227
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,760
he abode with them and wrought,

228
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,559
for by their occupation they were.

229
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:02,239
tent makers.

230
00:10:02,239 --> 00:10:07,519
And notice in verse 4, and he reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath and persuaded

231
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,679
the Jews and the Greeks.

232
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:14,639
As we look at this passage of Scripture and we speak on this subject, for I have much

233
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:19,159
people in this city, if you're taking notes, number one, I want you to notice the passion

234
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:20,159
of Paul.

235
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:22,919
The passion of Paul.

236
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:28,159
This morning during the invitation, if I'm not mistaken, Kimberly played A Passion for

237
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:29,659
Souls.

238
00:10:29,659 --> 00:10:33,579
And I was running in the back to get changed for the baptismal and all that was taking

239
00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:37,739
place, but I could hear the piano, and man, I love that song.

240
00:10:37,739 --> 00:10:44,359
And in that song, the songwriter says, Jesus, I long to be winning.

241
00:10:44,359 --> 00:10:48,019
Men who are lost and constantly sinning.

242
00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:54,419
He talks about having this passion for souls, oh, that this passion that it would be mine,

243
00:10:54,419 --> 00:10:56,239
that God would give us that passion.

244
00:10:56,239 --> 00:11:01,159
We find in the life of the Apostle Paul a man who was passionate, a man that displayed

245
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:05,399
through his actions this passion to reach the lost with the gospel.

246
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:09,959
I believe that Paul longed to see souls saved.

247
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:11,519
So what does he do when he gets to Corinth?

248
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,639
Well, he begins to preach.

249
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:18,559
He follows the same pattern in which he's established on these missionary journeys of

250
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:19,559
going.

251
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:24,559
We find it in verse number 4, he enters into the synagogue and he's there every Sabbath.

252
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:29,040
And notice the Bible says that he's persuading the Jews and the Greeks.

253
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:35,959
We find that the Bible says in verse 5, and when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia,

254
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:43,000
Paul was pressed in the spirit and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ.

255
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
And it's very interesting because back in chapter 17, we find that the Bible tells us

256
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,439
in verse number 3, verse 2, that he's there in the Sabbath in Thessalonica and he's reasoning

257
00:11:54,479 --> 00:11:57,239
with them out of the scriptures, the Old Testament.

258
00:11:57,239 --> 00:12:01,559
And it says in verse number 3, opening and alleging that Christ must needs have suffered

259
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:07,599
and risen again from the dead and that this Jesus whom I preach unto you is Christ.

260
00:12:07,599 --> 00:12:11,959
And so here in chapter number 18 in verse number 5, the Bible says that he testified

261
00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:16,479
to the Jews that Jesus was Christ.

262
00:12:16,479 --> 00:12:18,399
What is the significance of this?

263
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:25,479
Well, the reality is that they understood who Jesus was as a man.

264
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:28,759
The things that Jesus did were not done in secret.

265
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:31,679
Jesus in fact says that.

266
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:36,599
We understand that Paul makes that known to Agrippa when he's standing before Agrippa.

267
00:12:36,599 --> 00:12:37,720
You know these things.

268
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,279
They were not done in a corner.

269
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,839
They were not done secretly.

270
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:45,399
The miracles, listen, his fame was noised abroad.

271
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:47,839
They knew who Jesus was.

272
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:56,160
They knew this person, Jesus, but they did not understand that he was Messiah, that he

273
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,160
was Christ.

274
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:03,559
In fact, still even today, we would understand even as Romans speaks about the blindness

275
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:09,199
that has happened in part to the Jews, that there are many Jews today that are still looking

276
00:13:09,199 --> 00:13:10,319
for Messiah.

277
00:13:10,319 --> 00:13:14,959
They reject that Jesus Christ is the Messiah.

278
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:22,720
So we find that Paul, as he's preaching Jesus, God incarnate, Jehovah is salvation, but he

279
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:29,880
is the Christ, the anointed one, the Messiah, the Son of God, and he's making and alleging,

280
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,919
he's taking from the Scriptures and giving that truth.

281
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:38,319
He's passionate about people knowing the truth.

282
00:13:38,319 --> 00:13:40,039
You know, we ought to have some passion.

283
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:43,639
We ought to have some passion.

284
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:48,720
You know, the reality is that if you don't really believe what you're saying, it's likely

285
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,959
that the person you're talking to isn't really going to believe what you're saying either.

286
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:55,119
Have you ever had somebody try to sell you something that you could tell they weren't

287
00:13:55,119 --> 00:13:56,759
really convinced on using themselves?

288
00:13:56,759 --> 00:13:58,559
They're just trying to sell a product.

289
00:13:58,559 --> 00:13:59,559
They're trying to make a living.

290
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:05,599
They're trying to sell something, like, listen, man, you're not going to buy this thing either,

291
00:14:05,599 --> 00:14:07,080
but we ought to have some passion.

292
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:10,599
I remember a young man telling me, probably the first year I was here, he thought it was

293
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:11,599
cool.

294
00:14:11,599 --> 00:14:14,959
You know, like, teenagers, they think they're cool, and he's like, yeah, man, the Bible's

295
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:15,959
just boring.

296
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:17,720
That's what he says to me.

297
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:21,200
And I said, well, do you think when I'm preaching, do you think that I think the Bible's boring?

298
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,320
Oh, no.

299
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,919
I don't think that you think the Bible's boring.

300
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:25,720
I mean, you seem excited about it.

301
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,600
We ought to have some passion.

302
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,040
I'm not saying that we ought to be flying around from the rafters and what have you,

303
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:37,279
but we ought to be passionate about what Christ has given us to do.

304
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:43,639
Paul, he knew, I mentioned it this morning, he knew what God did in his life, and he believed

305
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:49,119
that God was still at work, and he was able to still save others.

306
00:14:49,119 --> 00:14:55,239
The Bible says in verse 6, when they opposed themselves and blasphemed, he shook his raiment

307
00:14:55,239 --> 00:14:58,399
and said unto them, your blood be upon your own heads.

308
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,119
I am clean.

309
00:15:00,119 --> 00:15:02,040
From henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles.

310
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,040
I love verse 6.

311
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,000
You really could build a whole message on verse number 6.

312
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,919
The gospel is the power of God and salvation to the Jew first, but also the Greek, and

313
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:16,040
you understand that he went to the Jews, but the Jews, they opposed themselves, they blasphemed,

314
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,040
so what does he do?

315
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,320
He shakes off his raiment, and he says, your blood be upon you.

316
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,440
Notice where he says, I am clean.

317
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,519
He's going to say this in Acts chapter number 20, where he talks about, in fact, turn over

318
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:27,519
there.

319
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,200
Notice what he says in Acts chapter 20 as he's talking to the church leaders of the

320
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,160
church at Ephesus.

321
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:38,799
He says in verse number 26 of Acts chapter 20, wherefore I take you to record this day

322
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:42,239
that I am pure from the blood of all men.

323
00:15:42,239 --> 00:15:47,519
Now understand with me this evening that there are some commentators in Bible, theologians

324
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:53,839
and what have you, that would say to you, they would make it as if Paul had no knowledge

325
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,799
of the book of Ezekiel when he was writing these things.

326
00:15:56,799 --> 00:15:59,720
Paul was extremely aware of the Old Testament.

327
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,279
He was a master in the Old Testament.

328
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,600
He was trained at the feet of Gamaliel.

329
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,600
He knew the Old Testament.

330
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,639
You know what the Old Testament talks about?

331
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,399
It talks about Ezekiel being a watchman.

332
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:15,559
And as the watchman, he had a responsibility to warn.

333
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:22,799
That warning being given, the watchman has no control on the response of the warned.

334
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:31,279
He has a responsibility to warn, but he has no part in how they respond to that warning.

335
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:36,079
And God tells Ezekiel that if you warn, then you're free.

336
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,760
You don't have any blood on your hands.

337
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,839
You've done what you're supposed to do.

338
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:45,480
Now if they don't listen, that's on them.

339
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:50,399
If you fail to warn, the blood's on your hands.

340
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:55,720
Ezekiel 3 and 33, you can look at both passages and you can see that God deals with that.

341
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,799
So now for Paul, of course we understand in the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, he says

342
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:00,799
I am clean.

343
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,359
He says your blood be upon your own heads, I am clean.

344
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:09,239
I don't know how somebody cannot see the book of Ezekiel in that statement.

345
00:17:09,239 --> 00:17:13,119
I don't understand in Acts chapter number 20 when he says I am pure from the blood of

346
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:18,119
all men, that why does he say, well if you look at the passage, he says listen, for the

347
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:22,839
space of three years I ceased not to warn everyone night and day with tears.

348
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:24,079
He was doing what he was supposed to do.

349
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:28,160
He had passion about what he was doing.

350
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,440
Paul says in the book of Romans, if you look at the ninth chapter and also at the tenth

351
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:36,480
chapter of the book of Romans, you find some wonderful statements that the apostle Paul

352
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,739
makes with regard to his desire for people to be saved.

353
00:17:41,739 --> 00:17:45,799
In Romans chapter number nine, in verse number two he says, in verse one, I say the truth

354
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:50,320
in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost, that I have

355
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:55,600
great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart, for I could wish that myself were accursed

356
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,720
from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen, according to the flesh.

357
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,919
Verse number one of chapter ten, brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel

358
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,760
is that they might be saved.

359
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,399
Paul had passion.

360
00:18:13,399 --> 00:18:16,839
Paul was called of God, he was commissioned of God.

361
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:23,799
Paul understood what his responsibility was and he sought to fulfill with passion what

362
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:25,959
God called him to do.

363
00:18:25,959 --> 00:18:31,679
We find that he says to these individuals that I am free, he says, your blood be upon

364
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:36,200
your own heads, back in chapter 18 in verse number six, I am clean from henceforth I will

365
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,239
go unto the Gentiles.

366
00:18:37,239 --> 00:18:42,039
By the way, I'm thankful because I'm a Gentile.

367
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:46,440
In fact, I think probably all of us here tonight are Gentiles.

368
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,159
The reality is that we've been graft in.

369
00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:52,279
What a wonderful biblical truth.

370
00:18:52,279 --> 00:18:57,159
We were wild branches, but we are graft in, hallelujah.

371
00:18:57,159 --> 00:19:00,440
And he says that he's going to turn to the Gentiles, remember it was the Jews that said

372
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,559
crucify him.

373
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:06,719
It was the Jews that rejected, it was the Jews that continued to even here in this text

374
00:19:06,719 --> 00:19:09,159
oppose themselves and blaspheme.

375
00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:13,260
And Paul says from henceforth I'm going to the Gentiles.

376
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:18,919
We find this evening that even through these ministries, these missionary journeys that

377
00:19:18,919 --> 00:19:24,159
eventually the gospel gets to Europe and even through that if you trace the timeline

378
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:29,719
and you see how the gospel gets here even to America so many centuries later through

379
00:19:29,719 --> 00:19:34,020
that process of that passion and what a joy, what a blessing.

380
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:39,559
See this evening, this passage of scripture encourages me, we ought to have passion.

381
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:42,719
But can I tell you this evening, you ought not be discouraged if somebody doesn't want

382
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:44,640
to hear it.

383
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,260
It's outside of your control.

384
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:50,580
The only thing that we're responsible for is giving the truth.

385
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:53,500
It's all we're responsible for.

386
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:57,859
I told you before about the guy at Aldi that ripped up the tract in my face and some of

387
00:19:57,859 --> 00:20:00,619
the other folks in our church have had the same experience with the same.

388
00:20:00,619 --> 00:20:08,459
same guy. I'm not mad at that guy. I feel sorry for that guy. He says, you're sure this

389
00:20:08,459 --> 00:20:13,019
is for me? Oh yeah, it's for you. I want you to read it. He comes right in my face and

390
00:20:13,019 --> 00:20:20,139
rips it in half, throws it in the trash. I'm not mad at him. I'm not responsible for how

391
00:20:20,139 --> 00:20:27,579
he responds, but I am responsible for giving the truth. And here we find that Paul, he

392
00:20:27,579 --> 00:20:33,179
served Christ with passion, and we see it. Notice in verse number 7, he departed fence

393
00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:37,739
and entered into a certain man's house named Justice, one that worshiped God, whose house

394
00:20:37,739 --> 00:20:42,499
joined hard to the synagogue. And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed

395
00:20:42,499 --> 00:20:48,539
on the Lord, notice, with all his house. Well, I'm sure that was exciting. It's exciting

396
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:54,499
when you get to lead somebody to Christ. It's exciting when somebody wants to hear the message.

397
00:20:54,499 --> 00:20:58,619
Sometimes we come to the place where, because we've received so many rejections, and I'll

398
00:20:58,619 --> 00:21:02,499
just speak for myself, that when I say to somebody, hey, could I take a Bible and show

399
00:21:02,499 --> 00:21:06,219
you how you could know for sure that heaven's your home, that I'm surprised when they say

400
00:21:06,219 --> 00:21:11,619
yes. Because I hear no so many times. Ah, you know, it's okay. Joseph and I were out

401
00:21:11,619 --> 00:21:16,579
knocking doors a few weeks ago, and man, I thought for sure this guy is a younger fella.

402
00:21:16,579 --> 00:21:20,659
And man, he acknowledged he was lost. He acknowledged that he could die at any moment.

403
00:21:20,659 --> 00:21:27,019
He had no clue and no peace. And I said, listen, can I tell you that God has the answers,

404
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:31,859
that His Word tells us we can know, that heaven is our home, if I could take the Bible in

405
00:21:31,859 --> 00:21:36,019
just a few moments and show you how you could know for sure that heaven's your home, would

406
00:21:36,019 --> 00:21:42,219
you be willing to take a few minutes? He said, nah, I'm okay. And I thought, you've got to

407
00:21:42,219 --> 00:21:51,819
be kidding me. But then somebody says yes. You know, I'd like for you to show me how

408
00:21:51,819 --> 00:21:59,779
I could know for sure that heaven's my home. And it's exciting. When in that moment a miracle

409
00:21:59,779 --> 00:22:06,379
takes place, a new birth. They were dead spiritually on their way to a Christless eternity like

410
00:22:06,379 --> 00:22:12,179
a fire, but they're born again, they're made alive, they're quickened, and they're heaven-bound.

411
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:18,940
It's absolutely amazing. We find that the Bible tells us that there were those that

412
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:23,659
trusted Christ, they believed on the Lord, but then notice it continues in verse number

413
00:22:23,659 --> 00:22:32,619
eight, and many of the Corinthians, hearing, believed and were baptized. And there was

414
00:22:32,619 --> 00:22:40,259
a work going on there in Corinth. Paul was passionate. Paul was preaching the Word and

415
00:22:40,339 --> 00:22:46,220
he was giving the truth and the Holy Spirit of God was actively working and people are

416
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:52,819
being saved and they're being baptized. And man, it's exciting. We see the passion of

417
00:22:52,819 --> 00:22:59,179
Paul. Number two, I want you to see the promises of God. As we look at verse nine and ten,

418
00:22:59,179 --> 00:23:05,299
I want you to consider with me these wonderful promises that God gives to His servant, Paul.

419
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:10,259
The Bible says, then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision. It's amazing to

420
00:23:10,259 --> 00:23:15,500
me when I read verses nine and ten and I think about the encouragement that Paul would have

421
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:19,779
received from these promises. And then I'm reminded this evening that we have a whole

422
00:23:19,779 --> 00:23:25,580
Bible full of promises that God intends for us to have and to claim and to be encouraged

423
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:35,699
by. And here we find that God says to Paul, be not afraid, but speak and hold not thy

424
00:23:35,699 --> 00:23:44,659
peace. Why? Notice, for I am with thee. We focused on that for a little while a couple

425
00:23:44,659 --> 00:23:53,220
of weeks ago in Exodus chapter number three, when God gave that promise to Moses, certainly

426
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:57,619
I will be with thee. You know, He gave that promise to Moses. He gave that promise to

427
00:23:57,619 --> 00:24:03,299
Joshua. You read Joshua chapter one. He gave that promise to Jeremiah. He gave that promise,

428
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:08,860
I mean, over and over. He gives it here to Paul. But you know, He gave that promise as

429
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:20,220
He gave the Great Commission. And He said, lo, I am with you always. What a joy to understand

430
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:26,679
this promise. Paul, yes, Silas and Timotheus came according to verse number five from Macedonia.

431
00:24:26,679 --> 00:24:32,260
But Paul, though there could be encouragement by having those co-laborers, by having those

432
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:37,579
partners to do the work of the ministry with together, the greatest encouragement is when

433
00:24:37,579 --> 00:24:46,179
God Himself says to Paul, I am with thee. No man, notice, shall set on thee to hurt

434
00:24:46,179 --> 00:24:54,139
thee. Wow. Praise the Lord. This is a, in verse number ten we see the promise and reality

435
00:24:54,139 --> 00:25:01,779
of His presence. We find in verse number ten the promise, the reality of His protection.

436
00:25:01,779 --> 00:25:09,179
I'm thankful that God gives the protection. The horse is prepared for the day of battle,

437
00:25:09,179 --> 00:25:19,220
but safety is of the Lord. And He tells Paul, listen, Paul, he was not someone that was

438
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:25,059
unfamiliar with opposition. I mentioned this morning how in Acts chapter fourteen he stoned

439
00:25:25,059 --> 00:25:31,959
and left for dead. So Paul understood what it was to deal with being imprisoned and being

440
00:25:31,959 --> 00:25:38,940
beaten and all that takes place. But God says here to Paul, He says, be not afraid but speak

441
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:44,859
and hold not thy peace, for I am with thee and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee.

442
00:25:44,859 --> 00:25:52,419
But then I want you to notice what He says, for I have much people in this city. What

443
00:25:52,419 --> 00:25:57,339
city is it that God is speaking of when He gives this promise? Well, it's the city of

444
00:25:57,339 --> 00:26:05,500
Corinth. The city of Corinth. A city that is known for its immorality. A city that is known

445
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:12,739
for its idolatry. A city that is pagan. A city that you could almost look at and say

446
00:26:12,739 --> 00:26:18,660
there's no purpose of going here. They're not going to want to listen. God says I have

447
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:26,579
much people in this city. Can I tell you this evening, I understand the historical context

448
00:26:26,579 --> 00:26:31,279
and promise that's given here, but I would submit to you this evening that God has much

449
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:39,119
people in this city. In this region. The Bible says that God is not willing that any should

450
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:45,919
perish but that all should come to repentance. The Bible in the context of that truth in

451
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:50,880
2 Peter chapter 3 is when there are those that are scoffing and mocking about the return

452
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:56,880
of Christ, the promise of His coming. Where is? That's the question that they're asking.

453
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:02,079
All things continue as they have been. They're willingly ignorant, the Bible says, of these

454
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:07,720
things. They have ignored the truth. They don't want to be confronted with the truth.

455
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:12,359
And then the wonderful truth that is given to us in verse number 9, the Lord has not

456
00:27:12,359 --> 00:27:16,959
slack concerning His promise. As some men cannot slackness. Or to us-ward. As some men

457
00:27:16,959 --> 00:27:23,359
cannot slackness. He's long-suffering to us-ward. Not willing that any should perish but that

458
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:29,359
all should come to repentance. Listen, we live in a county that has like 1.2 million

459
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:35,600
people. I believe God has people in this city that need to hear the gospel that need to

460
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:42,679
be saved. In this county. We're surrounded by counties that have populations in the millions

461
00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:49,199
as well. There's a lot of people. We know that. We live here. We know that. I was talking

462
00:27:49,199 --> 00:27:53,320
to someone, a church planter, and they were speaking about the place in which they're

463
00:27:53,320 --> 00:28:00,959
ministering and there's like 16,000 people in the whole county. And 16,000 people in

464
00:28:00,959 --> 00:28:05,079
the whole county. I said, we got Walmart that has 16,000 people, man. Not really. I know

465
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:08,839
that Walmart doesn't have that many people. But you almost could think, Costco might,

466
00:28:08,839 --> 00:28:18,079
you know, on a Saturday morning. But the reality is that we have so many people. If we're not

467
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:29,639
careful, people can get in our way. People can become a problem. They're hindering me.

468
00:28:29,639 --> 00:28:36,760
I can't get to where I want to get to. But they're, as I said this morning, they're souls.

469
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:44,359
And I believe this evening that God has people in this city. He has us here for a purpose.

470
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:48,000
If God was done saving people, if the last person was saved that's going to be saved,

471
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:54,679
we'd be in heaven. We'd be in heaven. But we're not in heaven. How many of you know

472
00:28:54,679 --> 00:29:00,520
we're not in heaven? Hallelujah, man. I am not in heaven right now. All right? Somebody

473
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:04,799
was talking to me last week and I said, listen, I'm just telling you one thing. We are not

474
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:15,039
in heaven right now. I can guarantee you this is not heaven. Amen? So God has people.

475
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:22,140
He has us as His people that He says we're His ambassadors. Paul was the representative.

476
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:29,119
He was the servant. But Paul receives this promise, this word of encouragement from God,

477
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:38,119
I have much people in this city. And I can't help but believe this evening that there's

478
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:42,599
some people that need to be reached in our communities, in your neighborhood and I don't

479
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:47,080
really have a neighborhood, but in this neighborhood. There's people that need to be reached, people

480
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:51,880
that need to be saved. I was talking to a pastor friend that teaches a Bible Institute

481
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:57,039
class a few weeks ago and he was telling me about a project that he gave to the students

482
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,279
to do in the project. That was actually quite interesting.

483
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:05,079
There's a project that they had where they had a responsibility to talk with someone,

484
00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:11,399
a coworker, a neighbor, a relative, whoever it might be, and ask them as part of an assignment

485
00:30:11,399 --> 00:30:16,919
that they had, that they had a responsibility in this assignment to share their testimony

486
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:17,919
with a stranger.

487
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:23,119
It's kind of a good idea, right?

488
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:24,119
Unique approach.

489
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:25,879
Like, hey, we're going to share our testimony with a stranger.

490
00:30:25,879 --> 00:30:28,199
And it's a class that we're taking.

491
00:30:28,199 --> 00:30:30,919
It's a graded assignment.

492
00:30:30,919 --> 00:30:35,959
And so the students in the class, they met with different people and coworkers, and they

493
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:41,379
said, hey, listen, I got a requirement for a class that I'm taking, and I got to sit

494
00:30:41,379 --> 00:30:44,439
down with somebody and share my testimony with them.

495
00:30:44,439 --> 00:30:49,439
Would you be willing to meet with me so that I could share my testimony with you?

496
00:30:49,439 --> 00:30:51,959
I like, that's pretty neat.

497
00:30:51,959 --> 00:30:55,599
And one of the students comes back that's actually an assistant pastor at a church that's

498
00:30:55,599 --> 00:31:02,079
taking some night classes, and he comes back, an assistant pastor, and he didn't do the

499
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:06,359
assignment, just like pastors to not do what they're supposed to do, amen?

500
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:08,399
But he didn't do it.

501
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:13,079
And the pastor that's the teacher, the professor, he says, why didn't he do it?

502
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:15,439
He said, I don't know any lost people.

503
00:31:15,439 --> 00:31:17,859
That's what he said.

504
00:31:17,859 --> 00:31:20,299
I don't know any lost people.

505
00:31:20,299 --> 00:31:25,559
So the pastor, and if you knew who he was, you'd laugh at this, how he responded.

506
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:29,979
He called the pastor that this guy worked for, and he said, I just want to congratulate

507
00:31:29,979 --> 00:31:32,019
you.

508
00:31:32,019 --> 00:31:35,459
And the pastor that's receiving the call says, what are you congratulating me on?

509
00:31:35,459 --> 00:31:38,739
He said, you have reached everybody in your community.

510
00:31:38,739 --> 00:31:41,519
I just want to, I don't know how you've done it.

511
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:45,299
We still have thousands of people that we're trying to reach, but you evidently have reached

512
00:31:45,299 --> 00:31:50,119
everybody in your community, and I just want to congratulate you and find out, obviously

513
00:31:50,939 --> 00:31:55,299
they've not reached everybody in their community, amen?

514
00:31:55,299 --> 00:32:00,699
But the reality this evening is that God's given us some promises.

515
00:32:00,699 --> 00:32:02,619
He's promised that His Word is effective.

516
00:32:02,619 --> 00:32:03,879
He's promised that it'll be with us.

517
00:32:03,879 --> 00:32:08,639
He's promised that the Holy Spirit will work, and we need to claim those promises just as

518
00:32:08,639 --> 00:32:10,279
Paul would here.

519
00:32:10,279 --> 00:32:13,779
We close this evening, number three, if you're taking notes.

520
00:32:13,779 --> 00:32:15,239
We see the passion of Paul.

521
00:32:15,239 --> 00:32:16,719
We see the promises of God.

522
00:32:16,719 --> 00:32:19,139
Number three, the persistence of Paul.

523
00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:25,939
I love verse number 11, the final verse of our text this evening.

524
00:32:25,939 --> 00:32:29,539
The Bible says, and he, what does it say?

525
00:32:29,539 --> 00:32:30,819
Continued.

526
00:32:30,819 --> 00:32:34,159
Our theme for this year is continue.

527
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:37,039
Our theme for our missions conference is going to be continue.

528
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:41,079
There have been a number of years since I've pastored here that we've had a different theme

529
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:45,639
for our missions conference than we do for our annual theme, but as I was praying about

530
00:32:45,639 --> 00:32:52,519
it this year, I just had a piece from the Lord of keeping the theme consistent because

531
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:58,759
the idea is that we need to continue in the area of missions as well, home and abroad,

532
00:32:58,759 --> 00:32:59,759
continue.

533
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:04,999
And here the Bible says he continued there.

534
00:33:04,999 --> 00:33:05,999
Where's there?

535
00:33:05,999 --> 00:33:06,999
Where there's Corinth.

536
00:33:06,999 --> 00:33:09,999
He continued where God had him for that season.

537
00:33:09,999 --> 00:33:14,159
Paul, of course, we know he went to a number of different places.

538
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:18,559
God used him in a great way on his missionary journeys, but it says that he continued there

539
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:23,039
a year and six months, 18 months.

540
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:24,679
He continued in Corinth.

541
00:33:24,679 --> 00:33:28,519
I think the promises, by the way, of verse 9 and 10, went a long way to helping Paul

542
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:32,159
to continue because he understood the promises.

543
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:41,359
He believed what God told him and he continued there a year and six months, 18 months that

544
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:42,359
he's there.

545
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:44,799
And I want you to see what he's doing.

546
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:49,559
He's teaching the Word of God among them.

547
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:51,199
He's teaching the Word of God among them.

548
00:33:51,199 --> 00:33:53,359
Souls, no doubt, are being saved.

549
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:58,859
We read in verse number 8 how in Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed

550
00:33:58,859 --> 00:34:02,079
in the Lord with all his house and many of the Corinthians hearing believed and were

551
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:03,199
baptized in.

552
00:34:03,199 --> 00:34:08,679
So the truth of God's Word is going forth and Paul, as he continues there for this 18

553
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,999
months, he's teaching the Word of God among them.

554
00:34:10,999 --> 00:34:16,079
And not only are souls being saved, but souls are being discipled.

555
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:21,779
Sometimes we do not deal with the entirety of the Great Commission.

556
00:34:21,779 --> 00:34:26,999
The Great Commission has three aspects.

557
00:34:26,999 --> 00:34:32,999
We give them the gospel, they get saved, if that's their response, we can't make them

558
00:34:32,999 --> 00:34:33,999
get saved.

559
00:34:34,999 --> 00:34:41,479
But if they get saved, they're to be baptized, and then we're to teach them all things, right?

560
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:43,839
Whatsoever I've commanded you.

561
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:47,559
That aspect of discipleship is absolutely imperative.

562
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:48,919
It cannot be ignored.

563
00:34:48,919 --> 00:34:55,339
It cannot be something that we do not focus on and that we do not make a big deal out

564
00:34:55,339 --> 00:34:56,339
of.

565
00:34:56,339 --> 00:34:57,339
Why?

566
00:34:57,339 --> 00:35:03,239
Because people that are not discipled are forever babes.

567
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:12,279
We understand how tragic it is when someone leaves a newborn baby at some place, a police

568
00:35:12,279 --> 00:35:16,679
station, a fire department, a hospital, emergency room, whatever it may be.

569
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:20,479
We've read in the news over years of tragic events such as that.

570
00:35:20,479 --> 00:35:25,479
We have heartfelt sorrow in those types of conditions.

571
00:35:25,479 --> 00:35:31,579
But I would submit to you that as spiritually speaking, if we do not focus on the aspect

572
00:35:31,579 --> 00:35:36,819
of discipleship, we're failing not only to do what God's commanded us to do, but we're

573
00:35:36,819 --> 00:35:44,539
leaving people ill-equipped to do what God has called them to do, to be what God has

574
00:35:44,539 --> 00:35:47,519
called them to be.

575
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:50,939
Discipleship is something that takes work, it's something that takes commitment.

576
00:35:50,939 --> 00:35:54,819
There must be someone that's willing to do the discipling and someone that's willing

577
00:35:54,819 --> 00:36:00,659
to be discipled, someone that has the level of humility that I need to be taught, somebody

578
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:05,739
that understands, as Paul would say to the believers in Thessalonica, that you're lacking

579
00:36:05,739 --> 00:36:08,899
in some areas and you need to perfect that which is lacking.

580
00:36:08,899 --> 00:36:09,899
And what a joy.

581
00:36:09,899 --> 00:36:16,059
Listen, this evening, 20-some years after I've gotten saved by the grace of God, I understand

582
00:36:16,059 --> 00:36:21,499
tonight as 27 years ago I got saved, I've been discipled since I got saved.

583
00:36:21,499 --> 00:36:24,939
And I'm thankful for that discipleship, that teaching, that training.

584
00:36:24,939 --> 00:36:29,819
I'm thankful that someone was willing to invest in me and teach me because I did not know

585
00:36:29,819 --> 00:36:32,339
then what I know now.

586
00:36:32,339 --> 00:36:40,979
And I would not know now what I know now if someone was not willing to disciple.

587
00:36:40,979 --> 00:36:47,619
The work of the ministry is outlined for us here in Acts 18, and I want you to consider

588
00:36:47,619 --> 00:36:54,059
as we think about this missions conference and our part in world evangelization, and

589
00:36:54,059 --> 00:36:59,179
yes, we want to pick up new missionaries, we want to continue to send missionaries abroad

590
00:36:59,299 --> 00:37:03,419
so that they can do in these fields where we're calling them to, or where they're called

591
00:37:03,419 --> 00:37:06,199
of God to go, that we're partnering with them.

592
00:37:06,199 --> 00:37:10,099
We want to see in the Netherlands a church established where souls are being saved, the

593
00:37:10,099 --> 00:37:13,219
Word of God is being preached, and people are being discipled.

594
00:37:13,219 --> 00:37:17,939
We want to see that in Spain and all of these other fields, but we must not lose sight of

595
00:37:17,939 --> 00:37:20,659
the fact that it has to be done here as well.

596
00:37:20,659 --> 00:37:24,739
It has to be done here as well.

597
00:37:24,739 --> 00:37:31,739
It starts in Jerusalem, and this, as we make application, this is our Jerusalem.

598
00:37:31,739 --> 00:37:36,759
He says both, it's to be all at the same time, and we strategically approach that through

599
00:37:36,759 --> 00:37:39,939
supporting missionaries that are going around the globe.

600
00:37:39,939 --> 00:37:44,139
And I hope that by the end of the missions conference next week that we'll be able to

601
00:37:44,139 --> 00:37:48,539
partner with two brand new missionaries and be able to support them financially and add

602
00:37:48,539 --> 00:37:53,619
them to our list as missionaries of the Fellowship Baptist Church that we've partnered with and

603
00:37:53,619 --> 00:37:57,899
we can begin supporting them financially and praying for them, and I trust that that

604
00:37:57,899 --> 00:38:01,099
will be what happens.

605
00:38:01,099 --> 00:38:06,299
But we never can lose sight of the fact that that over there does not replace what we're

606
00:38:06,299 --> 00:38:10,699
supposed to be doing here.

607
00:38:10,699 --> 00:38:15,419
It's not enough to just put money in an offering plate or to pray for a missionary and say,

608
00:38:15,419 --> 00:38:19,659
okay, I've done my part, both.

609
00:38:19,659 --> 00:38:27,979
God said He had much people in that city, the city of Corinth, a wicked, immoral, idolatrous

610
00:38:27,979 --> 00:38:32,739
people, but they needed to be saved by the grace of God.

611
00:38:32,739 --> 00:38:35,179
You say, do you know how bad our county is?

612
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:37,459
Do you know all the problems we have?

613
00:38:37,459 --> 00:38:41,499
There's a lot of them, but they're sinners that need to be saved.

614
00:38:41,499 --> 00:38:45,459
Why would we, and I know I've said this before, it's hard enough to get a saved person to

615
00:38:45,459 --> 00:38:47,079
act like a saved person.

616
00:38:47,079 --> 00:38:50,959
You're never going to get a lost person to act like a saved person.

617
00:38:50,959 --> 00:38:51,959
They don't understand the Scripture.

618
00:38:51,959 --> 00:38:54,759
They don't have the Holy Spirit of God living within them.

619
00:38:54,759 --> 00:38:56,439
They need to be saved.

620
00:38:56,439 --> 00:39:02,119
This evening, God has a work for us and this is our place.

621
00:39:02,119 --> 00:39:05,239
This is where God has us.

622
00:39:05,239 --> 00:39:14,519
I believe that God wants to use us to reach people with the gospel for His glory, not

623
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:19,919
for any of our glory, but for His glory.

624
00:39:19,919 --> 00:39:22,759
God said I have much people in this city.

625
00:39:22,759 --> 00:39:23,759
Let's pray.

626
00:39:23,759 --> 00:39:24,759
Father, we love You.

627
00:39:24,759 --> 00:39:25,879
We thank You for loving us.

628
00:39:25,879 --> 00:39:32,239
We thank You for Your Word and the truth contained therein and I pray, God, that You would help

629
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:40,879
us to serve You passionately.

630
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:45,479
Help us to claim the promises that You've given us.

631
00:39:45,479 --> 00:39:46,479
Help us to continue.

632
00:39:46,479 --> 00:39:49,279
We see the persistence of Paul.

633
00:39:49,279 --> 00:39:51,079
Help us not to give up or to give in.

634
00:39:51,079 --> 00:39:55,719
Help us not to be overwhelmed.

635
00:39:55,719 --> 00:39:56,719
Lord help us to continue.

636
00:39:56,719 --> 00:40:00,319
I pray that You'd move and work in hearts and lives as only

637
00:40:00,319 --> 00:40:04,639
you can. We'll give you the honor and glory for it. For it's in Christ's name we pray.
