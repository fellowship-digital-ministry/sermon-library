00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
Acts chapter number 18 this evening.

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.159
As we continue to prepare for our missions conference,

00:00:05.159 --> 00:00:09.060
it starts on Saturday with our opportunity

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.279
to have our international banquet dinner

00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:13.180
and looking forward to it.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:14.600
I love missions conference.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.720
I just really do.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.180
I love revival meetings,

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.879
but there's something special about the missions conference

00:00:20.879 --> 00:00:24.360
that almost has a mix of revival meeting

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.399
and also the exposure and the awareness

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:30.879
of world evangelization and the importance

00:00:30.879 --> 00:00:33.240
of fulfilling our responsibility

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.840
and how we can be co-laborers together.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.240
It's just an exciting time.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.319
I absolutely love missions conference

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:42.279
and I'm looking forward to with great anticipation

00:00:42.279 --> 00:00:44.180
of what God is going to do.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.720
I find it vitally important that we are prepared spiritually

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.560
when we enter into these special meetings.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.599
I was sharing with somebody even this afternoon

00:00:53.599 --> 00:00:56.400
that the first year, year and a half of pastoring,

00:00:57.119 --> 00:01:00.680
I would always feel very conflicted

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.000
when we were entering into a season of a special meeting,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.199
a missions conference or revival meeting,

00:01:06.199 --> 00:01:09.239
and I felt like as I was praying about what to preach

00:01:09.239 --> 00:01:10.959
that the Holy Spirit of God was leading me

00:01:10.959 --> 00:01:13.819
into a direction with regard to preaching,

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:16.400
but then I felt like I can't preach on those subjects

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.879
because that's what they're going to preach on.

00:01:18.879 --> 00:01:21.559
That's what the evangelist is gonna be preaching on.

00:01:21.559 --> 00:01:23.559
That's what the missionary is gonna be preaching on

00:01:23.559 --> 00:01:26.080
and I would feel somewhat conflicted

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.639
and have this internal struggle, if you will,

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:31.040
and I remember having a conversation

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.800
with Brother Palmer, Sean, a great friend, mentor of mine,

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.680
and he said this.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.800
He worked in evangelism for years, he still does,

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.919
and he says, you know, the more work that a pastor does

00:01:40.919 --> 00:01:43.639
in preparing the congregation for a special meeting,

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:46.519
the greater work that God is able to accomplish.

00:01:46.519 --> 00:01:48.599
He said, what I found throughout the years of ministry

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:51.540
is that a church can either be revival resistant

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.919
or revival ready, and I thought that was quite interesting

00:01:54.919 --> 00:01:57.360
and it really gave me a sense of relief.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.239
Of course, I desired to follow the leadership

00:01:59.239 --> 00:02:00.080
of the Holy Spirit of God.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.160
It was my brain that was getting in the way

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.400
and causing the conflict on whether I should

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.760
or shouldn't preach on those particular things,

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.080
and if you've not preached before,

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.039
you might not understand that,

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.679
but that's just something occasionally that you deal with,

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:17.179
and so I desire personally, but I desire for our church

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:19.800
to be prepared for the special meetings.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.199
I've talked to missionaries before

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:22.600
that they enter into a church

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:25.440
and they're telling me these firsthand accounts,

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.259
and so I'm just believing

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:29.600
that what they're telling me is true,

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.059
and they enter into a church, they enter in,

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:35.559
and there will be some members that will be standing

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:37.399
in the foyer area, maybe on a porch

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:38.960
or whatever the greeting area is

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.539
that the particular church has,

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:43.600
and the members will say, oh, how are you today?

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.559
You know, what are you doing here?

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:45.399
And they're like, well, we're here

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:47.479
for the missions conference,

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:48.919
and the members of the church are like,

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:50.839
oh, we're having a missions conference.

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:53.600
They walk into the church and there's no sign whatsoever

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.380
that missions conference is gonna take place,

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.679
there's no flags or any kind of decor

00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:00.240
that would give indication,

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.119
and missionaries have shared that type of story with me,

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:06.960
and I just wonder in that situation,

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.960
no doubt that there's little to no spiritual preparation

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.759
on the part of the people to be ready

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:19.600
for what God is going to do in and through those services.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.559
Over the last few weeks, we've looked at some things

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:25.800
on Sunday night with regard to God has a plan.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.059
We studied that, we understood that in the life of Moses.

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:31.220
God's plan includes his people,

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.679
and what a blessing to know that God would use us.

00:03:34.679 --> 00:03:37.500
In fact, it's often overwhelming to think

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.339
that God would use us to accomplish his plan on this earth.

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:45.039
Last week on Sunday night, we talked about we have a place,

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:47.279
and every man must be in his place.

00:03:47.279 --> 00:03:48.919
You have a place, I have a place,

00:03:49.279 --> 00:03:50.320
and we need to be in our place.

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.320
We need to be doing what God has called us to do,

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.960
and of course this morning, bringing people to Jesus,

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.600
looking at that passage in Mark chapter number two.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.460
I hope to encourage you this evening from Acts 18,

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.039
we look in this portion of scripture,

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:07.100
and God provides us really with the timing

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.500
right as we enter into the beginning

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.059
of this portion of scripture

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:13.000
with regard to Paul's second missionary journey

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.720
and his arrival in Corinth.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.239
Now the Bible says in verse number one of Acts 18,

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:21.799
after these things, now understand that those three words,

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:26.359
they convey a large message to us.

00:04:26.359 --> 00:04:30.519
After these things, well, what are these things?

00:04:30.519 --> 00:04:31.359
We find that the Bible,

00:04:31.359 --> 00:04:32.880
and we'll answer that question in just a moment,

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.040
but it says after these things,

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:39.040
Paul departed from Athens, notice, and came to Corinth.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.040
The Bible tells us in verse number 10,

00:04:43.119 --> 00:04:44.959
for I am with thee.

00:04:44.959 --> 00:04:47.359
You remember the promise that God gave to Moses?

00:04:47.359 --> 00:04:50.160
Certainly, I will be with thee.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.440
God says to Paul, for I am with thee,

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.959
and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee.

00:04:55.959 --> 00:05:00.959
Notice the statement, for I have much people in this city.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.559
I'm gonna preach a message this evening

00:05:02.559 --> 00:05:04.239
that I've simply entitled from verse number 10,

00:05:04.239 --> 00:05:07.799
I have much people in this city.

00:05:07.799 --> 00:05:09.160
As we look at the text of scripture,

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.420
we find that God provides us with timing,

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:14.040
that Paul departs from Athens and he arrives,

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.320
he came to Corinth.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.019
We understand the second missionary journey,

00:05:17.019 --> 00:05:19.660
it begins at the end of Acts chapter 15.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.320
At the end of Acts chapter 15, beginning in verse number 36,

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.140
and throughout the first several verses of chapter 16,

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:28.079
we find that Paul, on this second missionary journey,

00:05:28.079 --> 00:05:31.019
his desire is to follow up with the churches

00:05:31.019 --> 00:05:34.559
that were established during the first missionary journey.

00:05:34.559 --> 00:05:37.040
And we find that as those churches, what a great pattern,

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.959
by the way, of follow up and the importance

00:05:38.959 --> 00:05:41.119
of following up with those churches,

00:05:41.119 --> 00:05:42.839
and they've been established,

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:44.359
and he goes back to minister,

00:05:44.359 --> 00:05:47.359
and we find that that portion of scripture covers that.

00:05:47.359 --> 00:05:50.359
We enter into verse number 11 of Acts chapter 16,

00:05:50.359 --> 00:05:52.239
and down through verse number 40,

00:05:52.239 --> 00:05:56.299
and God provides us with a record of the work at Philippi.

00:05:56.299 --> 00:05:59.839
Of course, we are familiar with the book of Philippians,

00:05:59.839 --> 00:06:03.160
and the church that was established there in Philippi,

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.559
and we're mindful of the events

00:06:05.559 --> 00:06:07.720
with regard to the ministry in Philippi.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.000
Of course, Paul and Silas, they were imprisoned,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.359
and they're singing, and they're praising God,

00:06:13.359 --> 00:06:17.359
and at midnight, God delivers them miraculously,

00:06:17.359 --> 00:06:20.899
and the jailer, sirs, what must I do to be saved?

00:06:20.899 --> 00:06:23.519
I mean, God was working and using them,

00:06:23.519 --> 00:06:25.640
and how wonderful it is.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.359
We enter into the 17th chapter,

00:06:28.359 --> 00:06:29.959
and we find that in Acts 17,

00:06:29.959 --> 00:06:34.200
it begins with Paul and company going to Thessalonica.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.239
As best we can tell, Paul and company

00:06:36.239 --> 00:06:37.839
are not in Thessalonica very long.

00:06:37.839 --> 00:06:40.200
There's some opposition that comes up,

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.279
and of course, everywhere that Paul went preaching

00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:46.320
with those that were with him and part of the team,

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.779
they always were met with conflict and controversy.

00:06:49.779 --> 00:06:53.660
By the way, God's work is always going to be opposed.

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:55.440
We see that throughout history,

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.380
as you look throughout the scriptures,

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:59.760
God's work is regularly opposed,

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.440
and so they're there in Thessalonica.

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.200
They go over to Berea, and then we find

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:08.519
that Paul is transported down to Athens,

00:07:08.519 --> 00:07:11.519
and we find that as Paul is moved down to Athens,

00:07:11.519 --> 00:07:14.600
because of the trouble there in Thessalonica and Berea,

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.739
we find that Paul, really, if you were to look

00:07:16.739 --> 00:07:19.160
at the text of scripture there in chapter 17,

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.160
it seems as if Paul is going there

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.100
to have some type of rest, if you will,

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:26.820
some reprieve from all that's been taking place,

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:29.799
but we find that Paul, in Acts chapter number 17,

00:07:29.799 --> 00:07:32.839
the Bible tells us that he notices a city.

00:07:32.839 --> 00:07:35.880
The city is Athens, and what the Bible tells us

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:37.959
about what he observed was that it was a city

00:07:38.399 --> 00:07:42.480
that was wholly, entirely given to idolatry.

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:45.839
As he saw all of their images

00:07:45.839 --> 00:07:47.679
and various things that they had there,

00:07:47.679 --> 00:07:50.519
we find that their superstition was there,

00:07:50.519 --> 00:07:53.239
and we find that he found this altar,

00:07:53.239 --> 00:07:55.359
and the altar that he mentioned specifically

00:07:55.359 --> 00:07:59.359
was an altar that had the inscription to the unknown God.

00:08:00.279 --> 00:08:04.160
The Bible tells us that Paul, that he was stirred up

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.799
because he saw that this city was wholly given to idolatry,

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:11.239
and I hope this evening that just as Paul was stirred,

00:08:11.239 --> 00:08:14.200
that we too would be stirred, but we must understand

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.839
that the stirring must be followed up with some action.

00:08:17.839 --> 00:08:22.760
It's not enough to just be stirred, to have that impact.

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:25.760
No, we must allow the Lord to use us

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.880
and allow that stirring to bring forth action in our lives,

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:30.459
and so he was stirred.

00:08:30.459 --> 00:08:33.640
The great statement of verse number 23 of Acts 17

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:38.640
is when he says, him declare I unto you.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.000
What a great privilege we have

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.799
to declare the Lord Jesus Christ to a lost and dying world.

00:08:45.799 --> 00:08:46.679
You know, there are some people

00:08:46.679 --> 00:08:48.260
that you'll come in contact with

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.080
that they've only ever heard the name of our Savior

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:53.479
in a negative context.

00:08:53.479 --> 00:08:56.000
They've only ever heard the name of our Savior

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.320
used as a swear word.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:02.039
They do not know our wonderful Savior,

00:09:02.039 --> 00:09:06.400
and we have the privilege of declaring him to them.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:07.799
It's awesome.

00:09:07.799 --> 00:09:11.400
We find that after they're there in Athens

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.080
for a short period of time,

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:15.640
the stirring led to preaching, to declaring,

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:18.039
to making known the one true God,

00:09:18.039 --> 00:09:21.359
and we come to Acts chapter number 18,

00:09:21.359 --> 00:09:23.559
and the Bible says after these things,

00:09:23.559 --> 00:09:26.479
Paul departed from Athens and came to Corinth.

00:09:26.479 --> 00:09:27.960
Paul continues to serve the Lord.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.200
He continues to move forward.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.320
He continues to follow the path

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.440
that God has established for him.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.799
He understood that God was not finished with him,

00:09:35.799 --> 00:09:38.159
that God was still interested in using him,

00:09:38.159 --> 00:09:39.799
and we look at the passage of scripture,

00:09:39.799 --> 00:09:41.479
and it says in verse number two,

00:09:41.479 --> 00:09:44.960
notice it says, and found a certain Jew named Aquila,

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:47.200
born in Pontus, lately come from Italy

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.880
with his wife Priscilla,

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:52.179
because that Claudius had commanded all Jews

00:09:52.179 --> 00:09:55.880
to depart from Rome and came unto them.

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:57.320
And because he was of the same craft,

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.760
he abode with them and wrought,

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:00.559
for by their occupation they were.

00:10:00.559 --> 00:10:02.239
tent makers.

00:10:02.239 --> 00:10:07.519
And notice in verse 4, and he reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath and persuaded

00:10:07.519 --> 00:10:09.679
the Jews and the Greeks.

00:10:09.679 --> 00:10:14.639
As we look at this passage of Scripture and we speak on this subject, for I have much

00:10:14.639 --> 00:10:19.159
people in this city, if you're taking notes, number one, I want you to notice the passion

00:10:19.159 --> 00:10:20.159
of Paul.

00:10:20.159 --> 00:10:22.919
The passion of Paul.

00:10:22.919 --> 00:10:28.159
This morning during the invitation, if I'm not mistaken, Kimberly played A Passion for

00:10:28.159 --> 00:10:29.659
Souls.

00:10:29.659 --> 00:10:33.579
And I was running in the back to get changed for the baptismal and all that was taking

00:10:33.579 --> 00:10:37.739
place, but I could hear the piano, and man, I love that song.

00:10:37.739 --> 00:10:44.359
And in that song, the songwriter says, Jesus, I long to be winning.

00:10:44.359 --> 00:10:48.019
Men who are lost and constantly sinning.

00:10:48.019 --> 00:10:54.419
He talks about having this passion for souls, oh, that this passion that it would be mine,

00:10:54.419 --> 00:10:56.239
that God would give us that passion.

00:10:56.239 --> 00:11:01.159
We find in the life of the Apostle Paul a man who was passionate, a man that displayed

00:11:01.159 --> 00:11:05.399
through his actions this passion to reach the lost with the gospel.

00:11:05.399 --> 00:11:09.959
I believe that Paul longed to see souls saved.

00:11:09.959 --> 00:11:11.519
So what does he do when he gets to Corinth?

00:11:11.519 --> 00:11:13.639
Well, he begins to preach.

00:11:13.639 --> 00:11:18.559
He follows the same pattern in which he's established on these missionary journeys of

00:11:18.559 --> 00:11:19.559
going.

00:11:19.559 --> 00:11:24.559
We find it in verse number 4, he enters into the synagogue and he's there every Sabbath.

00:11:24.879 --> 00:11:29.040
And notice the Bible says that he's persuading the Jews and the Greeks.

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:35.959
We find that the Bible says in verse 5, and when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia,

00:11:35.959 --> 00:11:43.000
Paul was pressed in the spirit and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.000
And it's very interesting because back in chapter 17, we find that the Bible tells us

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:54.439
in verse number 3, verse 2, that he's there in the Sabbath in Thessalonica and he's reasoning

00:11:54.479 --> 00:11:57.239
with them out of the scriptures, the Old Testament.

00:11:57.239 --> 00:12:01.559
And it says in verse number 3, opening and alleging that Christ must needs have suffered

00:12:01.559 --> 00:12:07.599
and risen again from the dead and that this Jesus whom I preach unto you is Christ.

00:12:07.599 --> 00:12:11.959
And so here in chapter number 18 in verse number 5, the Bible says that he testified

00:12:11.959 --> 00:12:16.479
to the Jews that Jesus was Christ.

00:12:16.479 --> 00:12:18.399
What is the significance of this?

00:12:18.399 --> 00:12:25.479
Well, the reality is that they understood who Jesus was as a man.

00:12:25.479 --> 00:12:28.759
The things that Jesus did were not done in secret.

00:12:28.759 --> 00:12:31.679
Jesus in fact says that.

00:12:31.679 --> 00:12:36.599
We understand that Paul makes that known to Agrippa when he's standing before Agrippa.

00:12:36.599 --> 00:12:37.720
You know these things.

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:39.279
They were not done in a corner.

00:12:39.279 --> 00:12:40.839
They were not done secretly.

00:12:40.839 --> 00:12:45.399
The miracles, listen, his fame was noised abroad.

00:12:45.399 --> 00:12:47.839
They knew who Jesus was.

00:12:47.839 --> 00:12:56.160
They knew this person, Jesus, but they did not understand that he was Messiah, that he

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.160
was Christ.

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:03.559
In fact, still even today, we would understand even as Romans speaks about the blindness

00:13:03.559 --> 00:13:09.199
that has happened in part to the Jews, that there are many Jews today that are still looking

00:13:09.199 --> 00:13:10.319
for Messiah.

00:13:10.319 --> 00:13:14.959
They reject that Jesus Christ is the Messiah.

00:13:15.039 --> 00:13:22.720
So we find that Paul, as he's preaching Jesus, God incarnate, Jehovah is salvation, but he

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:29.880
is the Christ, the anointed one, the Messiah, the Son of God, and he's making and alleging,

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:33.919
he's taking from the Scriptures and giving that truth.

00:13:33.919 --> 00:13:38.319
He's passionate about people knowing the truth.

00:13:38.319 --> 00:13:40.039
You know, we ought to have some passion.

00:13:40.039 --> 00:13:43.639
We ought to have some passion.

00:13:43.639 --> 00:13:48.720
You know, the reality is that if you don't really believe what you're saying, it's likely

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:51.959
that the person you're talking to isn't really going to believe what you're saying either.

00:13:51.959 --> 00:13:55.119
Have you ever had somebody try to sell you something that you could tell they weren't

00:13:55.119 --> 00:13:56.759
really convinced on using themselves?

00:13:56.759 --> 00:13:58.559
They're just trying to sell a product.

00:13:58.559 --> 00:13:59.559
They're trying to make a living.

00:13:59.559 --> 00:14:05.599
They're trying to sell something, like, listen, man, you're not going to buy this thing either,

00:14:05.599 --> 00:14:07.080
but we ought to have some passion.

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:10.599
I remember a young man telling me, probably the first year I was here, he thought it was

00:14:10.599 --> 00:14:11.599
cool.

00:14:11.599 --> 00:14:14.959
You know, like, teenagers, they think they're cool, and he's like, yeah, man, the Bible's

00:14:14.959 --> 00:14:15.959
just boring.

00:14:15.959 --> 00:14:17.720
That's what he says to me.

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:21.200
And I said, well, do you think when I'm preaching, do you think that I think the Bible's boring?

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.320
Oh, no.

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:23.919
I don't think that you think the Bible's boring.

00:14:23.919 --> 00:14:25.720
I mean, you seem excited about it.

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:27.600
We ought to have some passion.

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:32.040
I'm not saying that we ought to be flying around from the rafters and what have you,

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:37.279
but we ought to be passionate about what Christ has given us to do.

00:14:37.279 --> 00:14:43.639
Paul, he knew, I mentioned it this morning, he knew what God did in his life, and he believed

00:14:43.639 --> 00:14:49.119
that God was still at work, and he was able to still save others.

00:14:49.119 --> 00:14:55.239
The Bible says in verse 6, when they opposed themselves and blasphemed, he shook his raiment

00:14:55.239 --> 00:14:58.399
and said unto them, your blood be upon your own heads.

00:14:58.399 --> 00:15:00.119
I am clean.

00:15:00.119 --> 00:15:02.040
From henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles.

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:03.040
I love verse 6.

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:07.000
You really could build a whole message on verse number 6.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.919
The gospel is the power of God and salvation to the Jew first, but also the Greek, and

00:15:10.919 --> 00:15:16.040
you understand that he went to the Jews, but the Jews, they opposed themselves, they blasphemed,

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:17.040
so what does he do?

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:20.320
He shakes off his raiment, and he says, your blood be upon you.

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.440
Notice where he says, I am clean.

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:26.519
He's going to say this in Acts chapter number 20, where he talks about, in fact, turn over

00:15:26.519 --> 00:15:27.519
there.

00:15:27.519 --> 00:15:31.200
Notice what he says in Acts chapter 20 as he's talking to the church leaders of the

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.160
church at Ephesus.

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:38.799
He says in verse number 26 of Acts chapter 20, wherefore I take you to record this day

00:15:38.799 --> 00:15:42.239
that I am pure from the blood of all men.

00:15:42.239 --> 00:15:47.519
Now understand with me this evening that there are some commentators in Bible, theologians

00:15:47.519 --> 00:15:53.839
and what have you, that would say to you, they would make it as if Paul had no knowledge

00:15:53.839 --> 00:15:56.799
of the book of Ezekiel when he was writing these things.

00:15:56.799 --> 00:15:59.720
Paul was extremely aware of the Old Testament.

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:02.279
He was a master in the Old Testament.

00:16:02.399 --> 00:16:05.600
He was trained at the feet of Gamaliel.

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:06.600
He knew the Old Testament.

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:08.639
You know what the Old Testament talks about?

00:16:08.639 --> 00:16:11.399
It talks about Ezekiel being a watchman.

00:16:11.399 --> 00:16:15.559
And as the watchman, he had a responsibility to warn.

00:16:15.559 --> 00:16:22.799
That warning being given, the watchman has no control on the response of the warned.

00:16:22.799 --> 00:16:31.279
He has a responsibility to warn, but he has no part in how they respond to that warning.

00:16:31.279 --> 00:16:36.079
And God tells Ezekiel that if you warn, then you're free.

00:16:36.079 --> 00:16:37.760
You don't have any blood on your hands.

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:39.839
You've done what you're supposed to do.

00:16:39.839 --> 00:16:45.480
Now if they don't listen, that's on them.

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:50.399
If you fail to warn, the blood's on your hands.

00:16:50.399 --> 00:16:55.720
Ezekiel 3 and 33, you can look at both passages and you can see that God deals with that.

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:59.799
So now for Paul, of course we understand in the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, he says

00:16:59.799 --> 00:17:00.799
I am clean.

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:04.359
He says your blood be upon your own heads, I am clean.

00:17:04.359 --> 00:17:09.239
I don't know how somebody cannot see the book of Ezekiel in that statement.

00:17:09.239 --> 00:17:13.119
I don't understand in Acts chapter number 20 when he says I am pure from the blood of

00:17:13.119 --> 00:17:18.119
all men, that why does he say, well if you look at the passage, he says listen, for the

00:17:18.119 --> 00:17:22.839
space of three years I ceased not to warn everyone night and day with tears.

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:24.079
He was doing what he was supposed to do.

00:17:24.079 --> 00:17:28.160
He had passion about what he was doing.

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:32.440
Paul says in the book of Romans, if you look at the ninth chapter and also at the tenth

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:36.480
chapter of the book of Romans, you find some wonderful statements that the apostle Paul

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:41.739
makes with regard to his desire for people to be saved.

00:17:41.739 --> 00:17:45.799
In Romans chapter number nine, in verse number two he says, in verse one, I say the truth

00:17:45.799 --> 00:17:50.320
in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost, that I have

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:55.600
great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart, for I could wish that myself were accursed

00:17:55.600 --> 00:18:00.720
from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen, according to the flesh.

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:05.919
Verse number one of chapter ten, brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel

00:18:05.919 --> 00:18:09.760
is that they might be saved.

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:13.399
Paul had passion.

00:18:13.399 --> 00:18:16.839
Paul was called of God, he was commissioned of God.

00:18:16.839 --> 00:18:23.799
Paul understood what his responsibility was and he sought to fulfill with passion what

00:18:24.079 --> 00:18:25.959
God called him to do.

00:18:25.959 --> 00:18:31.679
We find that he says to these individuals that I am free, he says, your blood be upon

00:18:31.679 --> 00:18:36.200
your own heads, back in chapter 18 in verse number six, I am clean from henceforth I will

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:37.239
go unto the Gentiles.

00:18:37.239 --> 00:18:42.039
By the way, I'm thankful because I'm a Gentile.

00:18:42.039 --> 00:18:46.440
In fact, I think probably all of us here tonight are Gentiles.

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:49.159
The reality is that we've been graft in.

00:18:49.159 --> 00:18:52.279
What a wonderful biblical truth.

00:18:52.279 --> 00:18:57.159
We were wild branches, but we are graft in, hallelujah.

00:18:57.159 --> 00:19:00.440
And he says that he's going to turn to the Gentiles, remember it was the Jews that said

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:01.559
crucify him.

00:19:01.559 --> 00:19:06.719
It was the Jews that rejected, it was the Jews that continued to even here in this text

00:19:06.719 --> 00:19:09.159
oppose themselves and blaspheme.

00:19:09.159 --> 00:19:13.260
And Paul says from henceforth I'm going to the Gentiles.

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:18.919
We find this evening that even through these ministries, these missionary journeys that

00:19:18.919 --> 00:19:24.159
eventually the gospel gets to Europe and even through that if you trace the timeline

00:19:24.159 --> 00:19:29.719
and you see how the gospel gets here even to America so many centuries later through

00:19:29.719 --> 00:19:34.020
that process of that passion and what a joy, what a blessing.

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:39.559
See this evening, this passage of scripture encourages me, we ought to have passion.

00:19:39.559 --> 00:19:42.719
But can I tell you this evening, you ought not be discouraged if somebody doesn't want

00:19:42.719 --> 00:19:44.640
to hear it.

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:47.260
It's outside of your control.

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:50.580
The only thing that we're responsible for is giving the truth.

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:53.500
It's all we're responsible for.

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:57.859
I told you before about the guy at Aldi that ripped up the tract in my face and some of

00:19:57.859 --> 00:20:00.619
the other folks in our church have had the same experience with the same.

00:20:00.619 --> 00:20:08.459
same guy. I'm not mad at that guy. I feel sorry for that guy. He says, you're sure this

00:20:08.459 --> 00:20:13.019
is for me? Oh yeah, it's for you. I want you to read it. He comes right in my face and

00:20:13.019 --> 00:20:20.139
rips it in half, throws it in the trash. I'm not mad at him. I'm not responsible for how

00:20:20.139 --> 00:20:27.579
he responds, but I am responsible for giving the truth. And here we find that Paul, he

00:20:27.579 --> 00:20:33.179
served Christ with passion, and we see it. Notice in verse number 7, he departed fence

00:20:33.179 --> 00:20:37.739
and entered into a certain man's house named Justice, one that worshiped God, whose house

00:20:37.739 --> 00:20:42.499
joined hard to the synagogue. And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed

00:20:42.499 --> 00:20:48.539
on the Lord, notice, with all his house. Well, I'm sure that was exciting. It's exciting

00:20:48.539 --> 00:20:54.499
when you get to lead somebody to Christ. It's exciting when somebody wants to hear the message.

00:20:54.499 --> 00:20:58.619
Sometimes we come to the place where, because we've received so many rejections, and I'll

00:20:58.619 --> 00:21:02.499
just speak for myself, that when I say to somebody, hey, could I take a Bible and show

00:21:02.499 --> 00:21:06.219
you how you could know for sure that heaven's your home, that I'm surprised when they say

00:21:06.219 --> 00:21:11.619
yes. Because I hear no so many times. Ah, you know, it's okay. Joseph and I were out

00:21:11.619 --> 00:21:16.579
knocking doors a few weeks ago, and man, I thought for sure this guy is a younger fella.

00:21:16.579 --> 00:21:20.659
And man, he acknowledged he was lost. He acknowledged that he could die at any moment.

00:21:20.659 --> 00:21:27.019
He had no clue and no peace. And I said, listen, can I tell you that God has the answers,

00:21:27.019 --> 00:21:31.859
that His Word tells us we can know, that heaven is our home, if I could take the Bible in

00:21:31.859 --> 00:21:36.019
just a few moments and show you how you could know for sure that heaven's your home, would

00:21:36.019 --> 00:21:42.219
you be willing to take a few minutes? He said, nah, I'm okay. And I thought, you've got to

00:21:42.219 --> 00:21:51.819
be kidding me. But then somebody says yes. You know, I'd like for you to show me how

00:21:51.819 --> 00:21:59.779
I could know for sure that heaven's my home. And it's exciting. When in that moment a miracle

00:21:59.779 --> 00:22:06.379
takes place, a new birth. They were dead spiritually on their way to a Christless eternity like

00:22:06.379 --> 00:22:12.179
a fire, but they're born again, they're made alive, they're quickened, and they're heaven-bound.

00:22:12.179 --> 00:22:18.940
It's absolutely amazing. We find that the Bible tells us that there were those that

00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:23.659
trusted Christ, they believed on the Lord, but then notice it continues in verse number

00:22:23.659 --> 00:22:32.619
eight, and many of the Corinthians, hearing, believed and were baptized. And there was

00:22:32.619 --> 00:22:40.259
a work going on there in Corinth. Paul was passionate. Paul was preaching the Word and

00:22:40.339 --> 00:22:46.220
he was giving the truth and the Holy Spirit of God was actively working and people are

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:52.819
being saved and they're being baptized. And man, it's exciting. We see the passion of

00:22:52.819 --> 00:22:59.179
Paul. Number two, I want you to see the promises of God. As we look at verse nine and ten,

00:22:59.179 --> 00:23:05.299
I want you to consider with me these wonderful promises that God gives to His servant, Paul.

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:10.259
The Bible says, then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision. It's amazing to

00:23:10.259 --> 00:23:15.500
me when I read verses nine and ten and I think about the encouragement that Paul would have

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:19.779
received from these promises. And then I'm reminded this evening that we have a whole

00:23:19.779 --> 00:23:25.580
Bible full of promises that God intends for us to have and to claim and to be encouraged

00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:35.699
by. And here we find that God says to Paul, be not afraid, but speak and hold not thy

00:23:35.699 --> 00:23:44.659
peace. Why? Notice, for I am with thee. We focused on that for a little while a couple

00:23:44.659 --> 00:23:53.220
of weeks ago in Exodus chapter number three, when God gave that promise to Moses, certainly

00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:57.619
I will be with thee. You know, He gave that promise to Moses. He gave that promise to

00:23:57.619 --> 00:24:03.299
Joshua. You read Joshua chapter one. He gave that promise to Jeremiah. He gave that promise,

00:24:03.299 --> 00:24:08.860
I mean, over and over. He gives it here to Paul. But you know, He gave that promise as

00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:20.220
He gave the Great Commission. And He said, lo, I am with you always. What a joy to understand

00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:26.679
this promise. Paul, yes, Silas and Timotheus came according to verse number five from Macedonia.

00:24:26.679 --> 00:24:32.260
But Paul, though there could be encouragement by having those co-laborers, by having those

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:37.579
partners to do the work of the ministry with together, the greatest encouragement is when

00:24:37.579 --> 00:24:46.179
God Himself says to Paul, I am with thee. No man, notice, shall set on thee to hurt

00:24:46.179 --> 00:24:54.139
thee. Wow. Praise the Lord. This is a, in verse number ten we see the promise and reality

00:24:54.139 --> 00:25:01.779
of His presence. We find in verse number ten the promise, the reality of His protection.

00:25:01.779 --> 00:25:09.179
I'm thankful that God gives the protection. The horse is prepared for the day of battle,

00:25:09.179 --> 00:25:19.220
but safety is of the Lord. And He tells Paul, listen, Paul, he was not someone that was

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:25.059
unfamiliar with opposition. I mentioned this morning how in Acts chapter fourteen he stoned

00:25:25.059 --> 00:25:31.959
and left for dead. So Paul understood what it was to deal with being imprisoned and being

00:25:31.959 --> 00:25:38.940
beaten and all that takes place. But God says here to Paul, He says, be not afraid but speak

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:44.859
and hold not thy peace, for I am with thee and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee.

00:25:44.859 --> 00:25:52.419
But then I want you to notice what He says, for I have much people in this city. What

00:25:52.419 --> 00:25:57.339
city is it that God is speaking of when He gives this promise? Well, it's the city of

00:25:57.339 --> 00:26:05.500
Corinth. The city of Corinth. A city that is known for its immorality. A city that is known

00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:12.739
for its idolatry. A city that is pagan. A city that you could almost look at and say

00:26:12.739 --> 00:26:18.660
there's no purpose of going here. They're not going to want to listen. God says I have

00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:26.579
much people in this city. Can I tell you this evening, I understand the historical context

00:26:26.579 --> 00:26:31.279
and promise that's given here, but I would submit to you this evening that God has much

00:26:32.279 --> 00:26:39.119
people in this city. In this region. The Bible says that God is not willing that any should

00:26:39.119 --> 00:26:45.919
perish but that all should come to repentance. The Bible in the context of that truth in

00:26:45.919 --> 00:26:50.880
2 Peter chapter 3 is when there are those that are scoffing and mocking about the return

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:56.880
of Christ, the promise of His coming. Where is? That's the question that they're asking.

00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:02.079
All things continue as they have been. They're willingly ignorant, the Bible says, of these

00:27:02.079 --> 00:27:07.720
things. They have ignored the truth. They don't want to be confronted with the truth.

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:12.359
And then the wonderful truth that is given to us in verse number 9, the Lord has not

00:27:12.359 --> 00:27:16.959
slack concerning His promise. As some men cannot slackness. Or to us-ward. As some men

00:27:16.959 --> 00:27:23.359
cannot slackness. He's long-suffering to us-ward. Not willing that any should perish but that

00:27:23.359 --> 00:27:29.359
all should come to repentance. Listen, we live in a county that has like 1.2 million

00:27:29.359 --> 00:27:35.600
people. I believe God has people in this city that need to hear the gospel that need to

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:42.679
be saved. In this county. We're surrounded by counties that have populations in the millions

00:27:42.679 --> 00:27:49.199
as well. There's a lot of people. We know that. We live here. We know that. I was talking

00:27:49.199 --> 00:27:53.320
to someone, a church planter, and they were speaking about the place in which they're

00:27:53.320 --> 00:28:00.959
ministering and there's like 16,000 people in the whole county. And 16,000 people in

00:28:00.959 --> 00:28:05.079
the whole county. I said, we got Walmart that has 16,000 people, man. Not really. I know

00:28:05.079 --> 00:28:08.839
that Walmart doesn't have that many people. But you almost could think, Costco might,

00:28:08.839 --> 00:28:18.079
you know, on a Saturday morning. But the reality is that we have so many people. If we're not

00:28:18.079 --> 00:28:29.639
careful, people can get in our way. People can become a problem. They're hindering me.

00:28:29.639 --> 00:28:36.760
I can't get to where I want to get to. But they're, as I said this morning, they're souls.

00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:44.359
And I believe this evening that God has people in this city. He has us here for a purpose.

00:28:44.359 --> 00:28:48.000
If God was done saving people, if the last person was saved that's going to be saved,

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:54.679
we'd be in heaven. We'd be in heaven. But we're not in heaven. How many of you know

00:28:54.679 --> 00:29:00.520
we're not in heaven? Hallelujah, man. I am not in heaven right now. All right? Somebody

00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:04.799
was talking to me last week and I said, listen, I'm just telling you one thing. We are not

00:29:04.799 --> 00:29:15.039
in heaven right now. I can guarantee you this is not heaven. Amen? So God has people.

00:29:15.039 --> 00:29:22.140
He has us as His people that He says we're His ambassadors. Paul was the representative.

00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:29.119
He was the servant. But Paul receives this promise, this word of encouragement from God,

00:29:29.119 --> 00:29:38.119
I have much people in this city. And I can't help but believe this evening that there's

00:29:38.119 --> 00:29:42.599
some people that need to be reached in our communities, in your neighborhood and I don't

00:29:42.599 --> 00:29:47.080
really have a neighborhood, but in this neighborhood. There's people that need to be reached, people

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:51.880
that need to be saved. I was talking to a pastor friend that teaches a Bible Institute

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:57.039
class a few weeks ago and he was telling me about a project that he gave to the students

00:29:57.039 --> 00:30:00.279
to do in the project. That was actually quite interesting.

00:30:00.279 --> 00:30:05.079
There's a project that they had where they had a responsibility to talk with someone,

00:30:05.079 --> 00:30:11.399
a coworker, a neighbor, a relative, whoever it might be, and ask them as part of an assignment

00:30:11.399 --> 00:30:16.919
that they had, that they had a responsibility in this assignment to share their testimony

00:30:16.919 --> 00:30:17.919
with a stranger.

00:30:17.919 --> 00:30:23.119
It's kind of a good idea, right?

00:30:23.119 --> 00:30:24.119
Unique approach.

00:30:24.119 --> 00:30:25.879
Like, hey, we're going to share our testimony with a stranger.

00:30:25.879 --> 00:30:28.199
And it's a class that we're taking.

00:30:28.199 --> 00:30:30.919
It's a graded assignment.

00:30:30.919 --> 00:30:35.959
And so the students in the class, they met with different people and coworkers, and they

00:30:35.959 --> 00:30:41.379
said, hey, listen, I got a requirement for a class that I'm taking, and I got to sit

00:30:41.379 --> 00:30:44.439
down with somebody and share my testimony with them.

00:30:44.439 --> 00:30:49.439
Would you be willing to meet with me so that I could share my testimony with you?

00:30:49.439 --> 00:30:51.959
I like, that's pretty neat.

00:30:51.959 --> 00:30:55.599
And one of the students comes back that's actually an assistant pastor at a church that's

00:30:55.599 --> 00:31:02.079
taking some night classes, and he comes back, an assistant pastor, and he didn't do the

00:31:02.079 --> 00:31:06.359
assignment, just like pastors to not do what they're supposed to do, amen?

00:31:06.359 --> 00:31:08.399
But he didn't do it.

00:31:08.399 --> 00:31:13.079
And the pastor that's the teacher, the professor, he says, why didn't he do it?

00:31:13.079 --> 00:31:15.439
He said, I don't know any lost people.

00:31:15.439 --> 00:31:17.859
That's what he said.

00:31:17.859 --> 00:31:20.299
I don't know any lost people.

00:31:20.299 --> 00:31:25.559
So the pastor, and if you knew who he was, you'd laugh at this, how he responded.

00:31:25.559 --> 00:31:29.979
He called the pastor that this guy worked for, and he said, I just want to congratulate

00:31:29.979 --> 00:31:32.019
you.

00:31:32.019 --> 00:31:35.459
And the pastor that's receiving the call says, what are you congratulating me on?

00:31:35.459 --> 00:31:38.739
He said, you have reached everybody in your community.

00:31:38.739 --> 00:31:41.519
I just want to, I don't know how you've done it.

00:31:41.519 --> 00:31:45.299
We still have thousands of people that we're trying to reach, but you evidently have reached

00:31:45.299 --> 00:31:50.119
everybody in your community, and I just want to congratulate you and find out, obviously

00:31:50.939 --> 00:31:55.299
they've not reached everybody in their community, amen?

00:31:55.299 --> 00:32:00.699
But the reality this evening is that God's given us some promises.

00:32:00.699 --> 00:32:02.619
He's promised that His Word is effective.

00:32:02.619 --> 00:32:03.879
He's promised that it'll be with us.

00:32:03.879 --> 00:32:08.639
He's promised that the Holy Spirit will work, and we need to claim those promises just as

00:32:08.639 --> 00:32:10.279
Paul would here.

00:32:10.279 --> 00:32:13.779
We close this evening, number three, if you're taking notes.

00:32:13.779 --> 00:32:15.239
We see the passion of Paul.

00:32:15.239 --> 00:32:16.719
We see the promises of God.

00:32:16.719 --> 00:32:19.139
Number three, the persistence of Paul.

00:32:19.159 --> 00:32:25.939
I love verse number 11, the final verse of our text this evening.

00:32:25.939 --> 00:32:29.539
The Bible says, and he, what does it say?

00:32:29.539 --> 00:32:30.819
Continued.

00:32:30.819 --> 00:32:34.159
Our theme for this year is continue.

00:32:34.159 --> 00:32:37.039
Our theme for our missions conference is going to be continue.

00:32:37.039 --> 00:32:41.079
There have been a number of years since I've pastored here that we've had a different theme

00:32:41.079 --> 00:32:45.639
for our missions conference than we do for our annual theme, but as I was praying about

00:32:45.639 --> 00:32:52.519
it this year, I just had a piece from the Lord of keeping the theme consistent because

00:32:52.519 --> 00:32:58.759
the idea is that we need to continue in the area of missions as well, home and abroad,

00:32:58.759 --> 00:32:59.759
continue.

00:32:59.759 --> 00:33:04.999
And here the Bible says he continued there.

00:33:04.999 --> 00:33:05.999
Where's there?

00:33:05.999 --> 00:33:06.999
Where there's Corinth.

00:33:06.999 --> 00:33:09.999
He continued where God had him for that season.

00:33:09.999 --> 00:33:14.159
Paul, of course, we know he went to a number of different places.

00:33:14.159 --> 00:33:18.559
God used him in a great way on his missionary journeys, but it says that he continued there

00:33:18.559 --> 00:33:23.039
a year and six months, 18 months.

00:33:23.039 --> 00:33:24.679
He continued in Corinth.

00:33:24.679 --> 00:33:28.519
I think the promises, by the way, of verse 9 and 10, went a long way to helping Paul

00:33:28.519 --> 00:33:32.159
to continue because he understood the promises.

00:33:32.159 --> 00:33:41.359
He believed what God told him and he continued there a year and six months, 18 months that

00:33:41.359 --> 00:33:42.359
he's there.

00:33:42.359 --> 00:33:44.799
And I want you to see what he's doing.

00:33:44.799 --> 00:33:49.559
He's teaching the Word of God among them.

00:33:49.559 --> 00:33:51.199
He's teaching the Word of God among them.

00:33:51.199 --> 00:33:53.359
Souls, no doubt, are being saved.

00:33:53.359 --> 00:33:58.859
We read in verse number 8 how in Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed

00:33:58.859 --> 00:34:02.079
in the Lord with all his house and many of the Corinthians hearing believed and were

00:34:02.079 --> 00:34:03.199
baptized in.

00:34:03.199 --> 00:34:08.679
So the truth of God's Word is going forth and Paul, as he continues there for this 18

00:34:08.679 --> 00:34:10.999
months, he's teaching the Word of God among them.

00:34:10.999 --> 00:34:16.079
And not only are souls being saved, but souls are being discipled.

00:34:16.079 --> 00:34:21.779
Sometimes we do not deal with the entirety of the Great Commission.

00:34:21.779 --> 00:34:26.999
The Great Commission has three aspects.

00:34:26.999 --> 00:34:32.999
We give them the gospel, they get saved, if that's their response, we can't make them

00:34:32.999 --> 00:34:33.999
get saved.

00:34:34.999 --> 00:34:41.479
But if they get saved, they're to be baptized, and then we're to teach them all things, right?

00:34:41.479 --> 00:34:43.839
Whatsoever I've commanded you.

00:34:43.839 --> 00:34:47.559
That aspect of discipleship is absolutely imperative.

00:34:47.559 --> 00:34:48.919
It cannot be ignored.

00:34:48.919 --> 00:34:55.339
It cannot be something that we do not focus on and that we do not make a big deal out

00:34:55.339 --> 00:34:56.339
of.

00:34:56.339 --> 00:34:57.339
Why?

00:34:57.339 --> 00:35:03.239
Because people that are not discipled are forever babes.

00:35:03.239 --> 00:35:12.279
We understand how tragic it is when someone leaves a newborn baby at some place, a police

00:35:12.279 --> 00:35:16.679
station, a fire department, a hospital, emergency room, whatever it may be.

00:35:16.679 --> 00:35:20.479
We've read in the news over years of tragic events such as that.

00:35:20.479 --> 00:35:25.479
We have heartfelt sorrow in those types of conditions.

00:35:25.479 --> 00:35:31.579
But I would submit to you that as spiritually speaking, if we do not focus on the aspect

00:35:31.579 --> 00:35:36.819
of discipleship, we're failing not only to do what God's commanded us to do, but we're

00:35:36.819 --> 00:35:44.539
leaving people ill-equipped to do what God has called them to do, to be what God has

00:35:44.539 --> 00:35:47.519
called them to be.

00:35:47.519 --> 00:35:50.939
Discipleship is something that takes work, it's something that takes commitment.

00:35:50.939 --> 00:35:54.819
There must be someone that's willing to do the discipling and someone that's willing

00:35:54.819 --> 00:36:00.659
to be discipled, someone that has the level of humility that I need to be taught, somebody

00:36:00.659 --> 00:36:05.739
that understands, as Paul would say to the believers in Thessalonica, that you're lacking

00:36:05.739 --> 00:36:08.899
in some areas and you need to perfect that which is lacking.

00:36:08.899 --> 00:36:09.899
And what a joy.

00:36:09.899 --> 00:36:16.059
Listen, this evening, 20-some years after I've gotten saved by the grace of God, I understand

00:36:16.059 --> 00:36:21.499
tonight as 27 years ago I got saved, I've been discipled since I got saved.

00:36:21.499 --> 00:36:24.939
And I'm thankful for that discipleship, that teaching, that training.

00:36:24.939 --> 00:36:29.819
I'm thankful that someone was willing to invest in me and teach me because I did not know

00:36:29.819 --> 00:36:32.339
then what I know now.

00:36:32.339 --> 00:36:40.979
And I would not know now what I know now if someone was not willing to disciple.

00:36:40.979 --> 00:36:47.619
The work of the ministry is outlined for us here in Acts 18, and I want you to consider

00:36:47.619 --> 00:36:54.059
as we think about this missions conference and our part in world evangelization, and

00:36:54.059 --> 00:36:59.179
yes, we want to pick up new missionaries, we want to continue to send missionaries abroad

00:36:59.299 --> 00:37:03.419
so that they can do in these fields where we're calling them to, or where they're called

00:37:03.419 --> 00:37:06.199
of God to go, that we're partnering with them.

00:37:06.199 --> 00:37:10.099
We want to see in the Netherlands a church established where souls are being saved, the

00:37:10.099 --> 00:37:13.219
Word of God is being preached, and people are being discipled.

00:37:13.219 --> 00:37:17.939
We want to see that in Spain and all of these other fields, but we must not lose sight of

00:37:17.939 --> 00:37:20.659
the fact that it has to be done here as well.

00:37:20.659 --> 00:37:24.739
It has to be done here as well.

00:37:24.739 --> 00:37:31.739
It starts in Jerusalem, and this, as we make application, this is our Jerusalem.

00:37:31.739 --> 00:37:36.759
He says both, it's to be all at the same time, and we strategically approach that through

00:37:36.759 --> 00:37:39.939
supporting missionaries that are going around the globe.

00:37:39.939 --> 00:37:44.139
And I hope that by the end of the missions conference next week that we'll be able to

00:37:44.139 --> 00:37:48.539
partner with two brand new missionaries and be able to support them financially and add

00:37:48.539 --> 00:37:53.619
them to our list as missionaries of the Fellowship Baptist Church that we've partnered with and

00:37:53.619 --> 00:37:57.899
we can begin supporting them financially and praying for them, and I trust that that

00:37:57.899 --> 00:38:01.099
will be what happens.

00:38:01.099 --> 00:38:06.299
But we never can lose sight of the fact that that over there does not replace what we're

00:38:06.299 --> 00:38:10.699
supposed to be doing here.

00:38:10.699 --> 00:38:15.419
It's not enough to just put money in an offering plate or to pray for a missionary and say,

00:38:15.419 --> 00:38:19.659
okay, I've done my part, both.

00:38:19.659 --> 00:38:27.979
God said He had much people in that city, the city of Corinth, a wicked, immoral, idolatrous

00:38:27.979 --> 00:38:32.739
people, but they needed to be saved by the grace of God.

00:38:32.739 --> 00:38:35.179
You say, do you know how bad our county is?

00:38:35.179 --> 00:38:37.459
Do you know all the problems we have?

00:38:37.459 --> 00:38:41.499
There's a lot of them, but they're sinners that need to be saved.

00:38:41.499 --> 00:38:45.459
Why would we, and I know I've said this before, it's hard enough to get a saved person to

00:38:45.459 --> 00:38:47.079
act like a saved person.

00:38:47.079 --> 00:38:50.959
You're never going to get a lost person to act like a saved person.

00:38:50.959 --> 00:38:51.959
They don't understand the Scripture.

00:38:51.959 --> 00:38:54.759
They don't have the Holy Spirit of God living within them.

00:38:54.759 --> 00:38:56.439
They need to be saved.

00:38:56.439 --> 00:39:02.119
This evening, God has a work for us and this is our place.

00:39:02.119 --> 00:39:05.239
This is where God has us.

00:39:05.239 --> 00:39:14.519
I believe that God wants to use us to reach people with the gospel for His glory, not

00:39:14.519 --> 00:39:19.919
for any of our glory, but for His glory.

00:39:19.919 --> 00:39:22.759
God said I have much people in this city.

00:39:22.759 --> 00:39:23.759
Let's pray.

00:39:23.759 --> 00:39:24.759
Father, we love You.

00:39:24.759 --> 00:39:25.879
We thank You for loving us.

00:39:25.879 --> 00:39:32.239
We thank You for Your Word and the truth contained therein and I pray, God, that You would help

00:39:32.239 --> 00:39:40.879
us to serve You passionately.

00:39:40.879 --> 00:39:45.479
Help us to claim the promises that You've given us.

00:39:45.479 --> 00:39:46.479
Help us to continue.

00:39:46.479 --> 00:39:49.279
We see the persistence of Paul.

00:39:49.279 --> 00:39:51.079
Help us not to give up or to give in.

00:39:51.079 --> 00:39:55.719
Help us not to be overwhelmed.

00:39:55.719 --> 00:39:56.719
Lord help us to continue.

00:39:56.719 --> 00:40:00.319
I pray that You'd move and work in hearts and lives as only

00:40:00.319 --> 00:40:04.639
you can. We'll give you the honor and glory for it. For it's in Christ's name we pray.
