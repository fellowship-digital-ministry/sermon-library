1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,119
chapter number three this morning, 1 Peter chapter number three, this Sunday is often

2
00:00:06,119 --> 00:00:12,399
referred to as Palm Sunday. And of course, you would recognize that with regard to the

3
00:00:12,399 --> 00:00:18,280
triumphal entry of the Lord Jesus Christ. And as we look at this portion of scripture

4
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:24,920
this morning, I want to remind us of a great truth that the Bible reveals to us. As you

5
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:31,040
study the pages of scripture, you'll find a truth, a teaching, a principle that we often

6
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:38,639
use the phrase to refer to it as the substitutionary atonement. And we see this principle revealed

7
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:44,520
in the Old Testament and we find the perfect fulfillment with the Lord Jesus Christ when

8
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:51,200
He took my place, when He took your place on the cross of Calvary. This morning, as

9
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:57,240
we look at 1 Peter 3 and verse number 18, the Bible says this, for Christ also hath

10
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:05,040
once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust. You see that there? That's how it's worded,

11
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,279
that substitutionary atonement in the text that we're looking at this morning, the just

12
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:15,160
for the unjust. Who's the just? Well, that's the Lord Jesus Christ. Who's the unjust? All

13
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:25,839
of us. He took our place. Notice when it says that He might bring us to God, being

14
00:01:25,839 --> 00:01:33,599
put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit. We find that the Bible says it

15
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:40,279
this way in 2 Corinthians 5 and verse 21, for He hath made Him, that's God the Father,

16
00:01:40,279 --> 00:01:48,800
made Him, God the Son, to be sin for us who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness

17
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:55,080
of God in Him, the substitutionary atonement. You think about the Old Testament. You think

18
00:01:55,080 --> 00:02:00,120
about the sacrifices. You think about Adam and Eve in the garden. You think about the

19
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:05,639
animal that was slain so that the coverings could be provided. See, because those fig

20
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:11,600
leaves, those aprons of fig leaves were not sufficient, and we find that there was a,

21
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:17,360
the blood was required, there was an animal that was sacrificed. You think about the offering

22
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,759
that takes place of Cain and Abel, and of course, one that's appropriate, one that's

23
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:27,880
inappropriate, the one that comes with the blood is the accepted offering. You think

24
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:34,720
about Abraham as he would sacrifice his son Isaac on Mount Moriah, and God provides a

25
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,000
sanctuary. You think about the Exodus as the children of Israel would leave the land

26
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
of Egypt in that final plague, the death of the firstborn. You think about the blood that

27
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,960
had to be applied. And then they were to observe the Passover annually, not only so that they

28
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:57,399
would remember what happened in Egypt and how God brought them out, but so that they

29
00:02:57,399 --> 00:03:05,279
would look forward by faith to one day, Christ, our Passover. We find this morning that as

30
00:03:05,279 --> 00:03:10,919
we would think about and understand the timing historically of the events that transpired

31
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:16,600
nearly 2,000 years ago now, we find that the Lord Jesus Christ on this particular Sunday

32
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:21,559
that we would see on our calendars and reference in our minds as being Palm Sunday and the

33
00:03:21,559 --> 00:03:26,619
triumphal entry of the Lord Jesus Christ, you would hear the shouts of the people as

34
00:03:26,619 --> 00:03:31,380
it's recorded in John's Gospel in the 12th chapter in verse number 13 when they say,

35
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:38,460
Hosanna, blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord. But just a

36
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:49,300
few short days after His triumphal entry, those people that were shouting, Hosanna,

37
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:58,220
now the shouts that can be heard are, crucify Him! Crucify Him! You think about just in

38
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:05,500
a few days how things change so dramatically. But the events of the crucifixion were not

39
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:10,320
a surprise to the Lord Jesus Christ. He knew that it was for that cause, that purpose,

40
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:17,820
this hour that He came to this sin-cursed world. The incarnation, the entire purpose

41
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:23,579
of Jesus becoming flesh and God taking on the form of human nature was so that He could

42
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:30,579
die in our place, the substitutionary atonement. So you know an angel could not die for you

43
00:04:30,579 --> 00:04:36,980
or for me. I can't die for you and you can't die for me to pay for my sin. It required

44
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:43,619
that God in flesh, the Lord Jesus Christ, took our place, the substitutionary atonement.

45
00:04:43,619 --> 00:04:50,660
I titled the message this morning, He Took My Place. No doubt as you are familiar with

46
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:56,220
the account in the Gospels, you'll be familiar with a man's name by Barabbas. You understand

47
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:02,619
that he was a man that was a criminal, that was sentenced to death. And truly as you think

48
00:05:02,619 --> 00:05:07,940
about the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ and as we have in our mind's eye the understanding

49
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:17,299
of Jesus crucified and on either side a thief. In a very real way, that cross was the cross

50
00:05:17,299 --> 00:05:25,059
for Barabbas. But in a spiritual application this morning, that cross was my cross and

51
00:05:25,059 --> 00:05:33,079
that cross was your cross. But God loved us so much that He took my place. It's amazing.

52
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:38,760
As we look here at our text of Scripture, the Bible says in verse 18, for Christ also

53
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:45,880
hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God,

54
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:50,640
being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit. If you're taking notes this

55
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:56,380
morning, I want you to notice with me first of all the record of His suffering. The record

56
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:00,839
of His suffering. The Bible tells us here in this text of Scripture that Christ also

57
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:05,799
hath once suffered. I want you to notice that within the book of 1 Peter, if you go

58
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:10,760
back to the second chapter, perhaps on the same page in your Bible, on verse number 21,

59
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:16,320
the Bible says this, in 1 Peter 2 and verse 21, for even here unto where ye called, notice

60
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:24,559
what the Bible says, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example that ye should

61
00:06:24,559 --> 00:06:31,619
follow His steps. He goes on to say this, who did no sin, neither was guile found in

62
00:06:31,619 --> 00:06:39,700
His mouth. The just for the unjust. The substitutionary atonement. You find that Peter would say this

63
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:44,019
in 1 Peter chapter number 5 and verse number 1, notice what he says, the elders which are

64
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:50,940
among you, I exhort whom also an elder, notice what he says here, and a witness of the sufferings

65
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:55,980
of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed. It's interesting to

66
00:06:55,980 --> 00:07:00,459
me that here in the book of 1 Peter, we find that in chapter number 2, he mentions about

67
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:05,260
the fact that Christ suffered for us, leaving us an example that we should follow His steps.

68
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:10,579
The Bible tells us in the third chapter that Christ hath also suffered for sins. We find

69
00:07:10,579 --> 00:07:15,700
that Peter will then, the human penman of this particular book, says listen, I was a

70
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:22,500
witness of the sufferings of Christ. Hold your place here in the book of 1 Peter, but

71
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,940
turn over to the gospel of Luke, if you will. We're going to look at two portions of Scripture,

72
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:33,420
one in Luke and one in Matthew. As we think about the record of His suffering, the record

73
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:37,500
of His suffering, in Luke chapter number 22, if you would turn there, and then we'll turn

74
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:43,899
to Matthew chapter 26 and 27, but I want you to notice that God provides us with a record

75
00:07:43,899 --> 00:07:51,899
here of the suffering of the Lord Jesus Christ. Remember, He's God. He's God, but He suffered

76
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:59,779
greatly. It's amazing what He endured on the cross of Calvary. It's amazing when you think

77
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:08,779
about the love that is displayed at Calvary. Here in Luke's gospel in the 22nd chapter

78
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:14,980
in verse number 54, notice what the Bible says, they took, then took they Him and led

79
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:20,859
Him and brought Him into the high priest's house, that's Caiaphas' house, and it says

80
00:08:20,859 --> 00:08:27,779
this, and Peter followed afar off. Now you'll recall with me that in 1 Peter 5 verse 1,

81
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:32,739
a verse that we just read, that Peter says that I was a witness of the sufferings of

82
00:08:32,739 --> 00:08:37,219
Christ. When we come to Luke's gospel, we find here that the Bible tells us that when

83
00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:42,500
they take Jesus after the events in the Garden of Gethsemane, after He was betrayed with

84
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:48,219
a kiss, and we find that He's arrested, that they take Him to the house of Caiaphas. And

85
00:08:48,219 --> 00:08:54,859
the Bible tells us that Peter followed afar off. But I want you to think about what Peter

86
00:08:54,859 --> 00:09:02,520
witnessed. As you continue reading, the Bible says in this passage of Scripture, we of course

87
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:07,200
read about his denial, but I want you to skip down to verse 63 and just look at these three

88
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,159
verses and I want you to see the suffering of Christ. The Bible says the men that held

89
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:19,840
Jesus mocked Him and smoked Him. When they had blindfolded Him, they struck Him on the

90
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:29,760
face and asked Him saying, prophesy, who is it that smoked thee? Many other things blasphemously

91
00:09:29,859 --> 00:09:39,659
spake they against Him. This is God Almighty, the Lord Jesus Christ, God in flesh. He suffered.

92
00:09:39,659 --> 00:09:44,020
The record is given to us of His sufferings and we see it here and we find that Peter

93
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:50,179
says I'm a witness of His sufferings and we find that God's given us a record of His sufferings.

94
00:09:50,179 --> 00:09:54,260
And we find here as you think about them mocking Him and smiting Him and you think about the

95
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:59,859
fact that they blindfolded Him and then they strike Him, they say prophesy, who is it

96
00:09:59,859 --> 00:10:00,020
that...

97
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:03,620
Is that smoke they?

98
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:07,700
Wow, what a scene.

99
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,240
Look over at Matthew's Gospel,

100
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,780
if you will, Matthew 26.

101
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:13,980
We'll read one verse in chapter 26

102
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:18,820
and then skip over to chapter 27.

103
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:29,720
In Matthew 26,

104
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,680
people bring Jesus and they say

105
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,600
that He's guilty of death.

106
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,840
I want you to notice in verse 67,

107
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:42,640
the Bible says this.

108
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,640
In Matthew 26 and verse 67,

109
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,280
notice what the Bible says.

110
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:52,320
Then did they spit in His face

111
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,440
and buffeted Him,

112
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,760
and others smote Him with the palms

113
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,960
of their hands.

114
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,000
We find the same record that we see

115
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,520
in Luke's Gospel where it says

116
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,400
in verse 68,

117
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,840
prophesy unto us thou Christ,

118
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:08,520
who is He that smote thee.

119
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,640
We find here that in this verse of Scripture,

120
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,520
the Bible says they spit in His face

121
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:17,320
and they buffeted Him.

122
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,120
He took my place.

123
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:26,120
You look in chapter 27 and look at verse 26.

124
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,280
In chapter 27 beginning in verse 26,

125
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,760
the Bible says this.

126
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,680
Then released He Barabbas unto them,

127
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,240
and when He had scourged Jesus,

128
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,520
He delivered Him to be crucified.

129
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,000
That scourging is to be whipped,

130
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,080
and now if you think about the process

131
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,240
and time and what's happened

132
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,080
and Jesus being arrested there

133
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,320
in the Garden of Gethsemane

134
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,280
and going to the house of Caiaphas

135
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,080
as we've just read those references

136
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,880
and all that He endured there

137
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,400
at the house of Caiaphas,

138
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,960
and then after He'd spent the night there

139
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,120
in the house of Caiaphas,

140
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,120
they take Him to Pilate

141
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,520
to be judged of Pilate,

142
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,960
and that's where we pick it up here

143
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,080
in this portion of Scripture.

144
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,880
You find that in chapter 27

145
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,120
beginning in verse number 26,

146
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,680
it says that He delivered Him

147
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,520
to be crucified after they'd whipped Him

148
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,360
and crucified Him,

149
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,840
and look at verse 27.

150
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,160
The Bible says then the soldiers

151
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,600
of the governor took Jesus

152
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,880
into the common hall

153
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,960
and gathered unto Him

154
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,480
the whole band of soldiers

155
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,480
and they stripped Him

156
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,520
and put on Him a scarlet robe.

157
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,280
When they had plaited a crown of thorns,

158
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,040
they put it upon His head

159
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,480
and a reed in His right hand

160
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,000
and they bowed the knee before Him

161
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,560
and mocked Him saying,

162
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,520
Hail, King of the Jews.

163
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,240
They spit upon Him

164
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,600
and took the reed and smote Him on the head.

165
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,280
And after they had mocked Him,

166
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,040
they took the robe off from Him

167
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,640
and put His own raiment on Him

168
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:44,640
and led Him away to crucify Him.

169
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,640
And as they came out,

170
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,120
they found a man of Cyrene,

171
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,160
Simon by name.

172
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,160
Him they compelled to bear His cross.

173
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,440
They were come unto a place called Golgotha,

174
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,160
as to say a place of a skull.

175
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,680
They gave Him vinegar to drink

176
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,720
mingled with gall

177
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,280
and when He had tasted thereof,

178
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,280
He would not drink

179
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,200
and they crucified Him.

180
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,120
Parted His garments,

181
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,840
casting lots that it might be fulfilled

182
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,480
which was spoken by the prophet.

183
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,120
They parted My garments among them

184
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,840
and upon My vesture did they cast lots.

185
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,640
And sitting down,

186
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,440
they watched Him there.

187
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:20,040
Can you imagine?

188
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:25,640
They sat down and they watched Him.

189
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:29,720
The Romans sought to,

190
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,320
in a really strange way,

191
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,880
become experts of crucifixion.

192
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,720
To master that process.

193
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,720
So that they can inflict

194
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,160
as much torment and pain

195
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,120
on the individual that's being crucified.

196
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,840
So that the death could be as long

197
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,800
and drawn out as possible.

198
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,680
So they didn't want it to just be a fast death.

199
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,200
They wanted it to be a torturous death.

200
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,400
And they did all that they could

201
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,440
to try to master,

202
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,000
to become experts at this process of crucifixion.

203
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,680
And here Jesus is on the cross

204
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,320
and the Bible says that they sat down

205
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,400
and they watched Him there.

206
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,880
And notice it says in verse 37,

207
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,120
they set up over His head

208
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,240
His accusation written,

209
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:09,360
this is Jesus the King of the Jews.

210
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,640
I want you to think about this scene

211
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,200
as the record of His suffering

212
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,360
is given to us

213
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,120
and we begin to read

214
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,720
these portions of Scripture.

215
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,560
No doubt for many of us this morning,

216
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,680
familiar passages of Scripture.

217
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,960
I took time this week

218
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,680
as I was meditating upon

219
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,000
the portions of Scripture

220
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,600
and as I was meditating upon

221
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,520
all this taking place

222
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,040
and I took the time

223
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,800
even this morning to go back

224
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,480
and look at some pictures

225
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,520
that I took while I stood

226
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,560
in what is believed to be

227
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:41,800
the house of Caiaphas.

228
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,560
And you see the place

229
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,280
where Jesus suffered.

230
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,480
Brother Sammy, you've been there.

231
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:53,400
It's amazing.

232
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,120
He took my place.

233
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,800
He took your place.

234
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,640
Why? Because He loves you.

235
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,880
I stood at the place,

236
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,720
the hidden gate as it's called,

237
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,840
where Jesus would have stood

238
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,400
before Pilate believing

239
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,400
that that's where it took place.

240
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,800
You think about all the things

241
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,680
that you've read in the Bible,

242
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,800
all of these portions

243
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,160
that I've just read to you,

244
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,960
and you're standing there.

245
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,680
And the very real truth

246
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,240
of what God did

247
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,000
for undeserving sinners.

248
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,680
It's amazing.

249
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,760
When we're in the house of Caiaphas,

250
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,040
I have a video of singing

251
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,080
amazing love.

252
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:47,560
How can it be?

253
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,000
It's powerful.

254
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,840
You don't have to be there

255
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,600
as I had the privilege of being there

256
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,880
to see the record of His sufferings.

257
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,040
But I'll tell you this morning

258
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,400
that God records for us

259
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:04,240
this truth of the substitutionary atonement.

260
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,240
And He tells us that Christ,

261
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,440
as we read in our portion of Scripture

262
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,120
there in 1 Peter 3,

263
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,680
the way that He words it there,

264
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:18,880
for Christ also hath once suffered.

265
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,760
The record of His suffering.

266
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,160
But I want you to understand this morning

267
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,560
the reason for His suffering.

268
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,360
If we say number one

269
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,520
is the record of His suffering,

270
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,360
number two this morning

271
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,360
would be the reason for His suffering.

272
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,760
And it's those two words

273
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,200
in verse 18 of 1 Peter 3

274
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:35,960
where the Bible says,

275
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:41,880
for Christ also hath once suffered four sins.

276
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,160
That's the reason for His suffering.

277
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,920
The reason.

278
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,640
Though God created man perfect

279
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,080
in a perfect environment.

280
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:54,280
You read the record of the Genesis account

281
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,280
and the creation of the world

282
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,760
and the creation of mankind,

283
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,320
you find that God created man perfect

284
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,160
in His own image.

285
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,440
But the Bible goes on to tell us

286
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,680
in Genesis 3,

287
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,240
the record is given where man sinned

288
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:11,400
and sin entered into the world.

289
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,600
Now that did not surprise God.

290
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,680
God knew that man would sin.

291
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,280
In fact, the Bible teaches us

292
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,120
that Jesus is the Lamb of God

293
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,200
that's slain before the foundation of the world.

294
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:28,080
Why? Because He knew that man would sin.

295
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,560
That's why Jesus could say,

296
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,840
for this cause, for this reason,

297
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,120
came I into the world.

298
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,360
That's why Paul could say

299
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,920
that this is a faithful saying

300
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,240
and worthy of all acceptation

301
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,120
that Christ Jesus came into the world

302
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,160
to save sinners.

303
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,600
We see the record of His suffering,

304
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,720
but we understand this morning

305
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,720
the reason for His suffering is for sins.

306
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,360
Notice the consequence of sin

307
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,520
there in the garden.

308
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,120
The consequence of that action

309
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,080
when they ate of that fruit of the tree

310
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,480
that was forbidden.

311
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,080
We find that the Bible tells us

312
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,680
that single action has had an impact

313
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,120
on all of humanity.

314
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,520
In Romans chapter number five,

315
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,520
if you want to take the time to turn there,

316
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,120
the Bible reveals to us

317
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,320
in that portion of Scripture

318
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,480
this truth that we're dealing with this morning,

319
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,680
the reason for Christ's suffering.

320
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:21,200
And we find here that the Bible teaches us

321
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,920
and reveals to us this truth of sin

322
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:27,200
being passed to all mankind, all humanity.

323
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,560
Listen, it's a universal condition.

324
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,880
We're all sinners.

325
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,559
Some are saved by the grace of God

326
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,360
and some are still lost.

327
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,040
We're all sinners.

328
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,480
Someone asked the question,

329
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:42,360
what makes you a sinner?

330
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,920
Is it because you sin?

331
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,960
No.

332
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,080
Though that could be true that you could say that,

333
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,960
but the real truth, the root of the matter

334
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:53,360
is that we sin because we're sinners.

335
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,520
And in Romans five and verse number 12,

336
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,840
the Bible says it this way,

337
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,640
wherefore as by one man, sin entered into the world.

338
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,920
That's Adam.

339
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,640
Genesis three.

340
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,600
The Bible says, and death by sin.

341
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,119
Remember Jesus said, if you eat, you're gonna die.

342
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,040
It's a spiritual death.

343
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,119
The Bible says, so death passed upon all men

344
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:23,280
for that all have sinned.

345
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,720
It's a universal condition.

346
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,480
There's nothing unique about you or me

347
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,720
that we, oh, I can't believe I'm a sinner.

348
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,800
We're all sinners.

349
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,960
It's a universal condition.

350
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,559
But I'm thankful that if you go on to read

351
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:37,480
the entirety of Romans chapter number five,

352
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,480
that there's a great comparison that takes place

353
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:43,520
between one man, Adam, and one man, the Lord Jesus Christ,

354
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,640
and how that Adam's transgression,

355
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,880
in fact, it impacted all mankind,

356
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,000
all of humanity that were born sinners.

357
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,800
But Jesus Christ, born of a virgin, free from sin,

358
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,960
he did no sin.

359
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,559
There's no guile found in his mouth.

360
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:00,000
He's perfect, he's the just, that through his sacrifice.

361
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,279
sacrifice, mankind can be redeemed.

362
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:04,840
It's amazing.

363
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,920
The Bible tells us in this portion of Scripture in verse number 8, but God commended His love

364
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:14,479
toward us and that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.

365
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:16,440
Christ died for us.

366
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:21,159
Sin requires a payment.

367
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:22,559
Sin requires a payment.

368
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:31,120
And the only acceptable payment for sin is the precious blood of the Lord Jesus Christ.

369
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,880
So I'm trying to be a good person.

370
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,200
It's commendable to try to be a good person.

371
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,759
When you look in society, it's commendable.

372
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:46,400
Almost everyone I talk to when I ask them, are you a sinner, I've never murdered anyone.

373
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:53,560
And I'm like, I'm really happy to hear that.

374
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:57,080
Sin is transgression of the law.

375
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,919
And sin requires payment.

376
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,000
Look over to the book of Romans if you, or excuse me, Hebrews if you will, chapter number

377
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
9.

378
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,919
Look at Hebrews chapter number 9.

379
00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:12,500
We think about this truth of sin requiring a payment, the reason for his suffering.

380
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,580
We read the record of his suffering.

381
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:18,459
We read what took place there at the house of Caiaphas.

382
00:21:18,459 --> 00:21:23,500
We read what took place before Pilate and as they led him to the place called Golgotha,

383
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,699
the place of a skull to be crucified.

384
00:21:25,699 --> 00:21:29,940
We've read those portions and we see the record of Christ's suffering, but we see the reason

385
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,699
is for sins.

386
00:21:31,699 --> 00:21:36,800
See the Bible says this in Hebrews 9 and verse 22, and almost all things are by the law purged

387
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,800
with blood.

388
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:43,839
The Bible actually says, and without shedding of blood is no remission.

389
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:49,400
The Bible goes on to say, if you pick it up in the 10th chapter in verse number 1, and

390
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:55,599
this is just a precious verse, the Bible says, for the law having a shadow of good things

391
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:56,599
to come.

392
00:21:56,599 --> 00:21:58,120
And really that's exactly what it is.

393
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,440
It's a shadow of good things to come.

394
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:04,120
You read the Old Testament, you read about the prophecies, you read all of the things

395
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:07,160
within the law and all of the sacrificial systems.

396
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:11,199
People get bogged down in the book of Leviticus and they say, what is all of this talking

397
00:22:11,199 --> 00:22:12,199
about?

398
00:22:12,199 --> 00:22:18,639
And you find that it's wonderful, beautiful pictures of how Jesus would fulfill all of

399
00:22:18,639 --> 00:22:23,119
those sacrifices and all of those offerings.

400
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:28,160
We find, the Bible says, that the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the

401
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,759
very image of the things.

402
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:32,720
Listen, you know what a shadow is?

403
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:40,880
You can't hug a shadow, but you can see a shadow, there's a substance in it.

404
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:46,240
And it says here that it's a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the

405
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:52,960
things can never, with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually, make

406
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,860
the comers thereunto perfect.

407
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:58,039
They offered blood sacrifices, they offered them repeatedly.

408
00:22:58,039 --> 00:23:02,639
If you have in your mind's eye a picture of the tabernacle and then you fast forward

409
00:23:02,639 --> 00:23:06,880
to the temple and you see the offerings and you think about the tabernacle in particular

410
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,360
and you'd come and the first piece of furniture, there's only one entrance by the way to the

411
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:16,240
tabernacle because there's only one way to God and that's through the Lord Jesus Christ.

412
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,839
We find that through that one entrance, the very first piece of furniture that you would

413
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:21,839
come to is the brazen altar.

414
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:22,839
And why?

415
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:26,240
Because sacrifice is required.

416
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,160
Sacrifices had to be shed.

417
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:37,000
We find that they offered sacrifices, they offered sacrifices year by year, daily, but

418
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,399
those sacrifices could never make the comers thereunto perfect.

419
00:23:42,399 --> 00:23:46,520
Notice it says, for then would they not have ceased to be offered?

420
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:51,479
I mean, it's a simple understanding that if they could, if they could accomplish, if they

421
00:23:51,479 --> 00:23:55,919
could achieve, then there'd be no more need for those sacrifices.

422
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:00,440
But it says, because the worshipers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins,

423
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:05,000
but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year.

424
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,979
Notice verse 4, for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take

425
00:24:09,979 --> 00:24:14,479
away sins.

426
00:24:14,479 --> 00:24:18,000
But it pictured one who would.

427
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,760
By faith they could look forward with anticipation that one day Messiah is going to come.

428
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:31,040
And Messiah, again, as Paul refers to him as he's talking to the church in Corinth,

429
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,959
Christ, our Passover.

430
00:24:33,959 --> 00:24:39,079
And we find that here as you continue to read, look at verse number 11 of chapter 10.

431
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:44,000
The Bible says, and every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes

432
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,600
the same sacrifices, notice where it says, which can never take away sins.

433
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:54,720
Can you imagine the responsibility, the role of the priest?

434
00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:00,100
Every day, continually.

435
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:04,899
These sacrifices, these offerings, but they could never take away sins.

436
00:25:04,899 --> 00:25:09,959
They were a reminder that the people had sinned and they were a reminder that Messiah would

437
00:25:09,959 --> 00:25:11,119
come one day.

438
00:25:11,239 --> 00:25:15,920
And then we read in verse number 12, the shadow passing away in the very image of the Lord

439
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,040
Jesus Christ.

440
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:23,279
Here in verse number 12 it says, but this man, the Lord Jesus Christ, see the book of

441
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:28,600
Hebrews is all about exalting Christ and how Christ is better, how Christ is superior.

442
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:32,440
He's better than the angels, he's better than Moses, he's better than, he's better than

443
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,440
everything.

444
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,720
He's better than the, than the priesthood.

445
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,160
He's better than the sacrifice they make.

446
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:49,600
And it says that this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, hallelujah,

447
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:53,799
sat down on the right hand of God.

448
00:25:53,799 --> 00:26:00,519
Those people that put Jesus on the cross to crucify him, they sat down and watched him

449
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:03,519
as he was paying for your sin and for my sin.

450
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:09,119
But Jesus, after he had made that one sacrifice for sins forever, after he rose conquering

451
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:14,720
sin, death, and the grave, hallelujah, he sat, the Bible says, on the right hand of

452
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,720
God.

453
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,640
The Bible tells us that he ever lives to make intercession for us.

454
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,959
The Bible tells us he's coming again and oh, how we look for his appearing.

455
00:26:22,959 --> 00:26:27,880
But I want you to see here in the text of Scripture that even as Peter would say in

456
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:35,559
chapter 3 and verse number 18, for Christ also hath once suffered for sins.

457
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:42,119
Listen, that one sacrifice was good forever, accepted by God Almighty because it was a

458
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:45,600
perfect sacrifice, sinless sacrifice.

459
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:50,160
So when we look at the passage of Scripture and we're reminded of what transpires this

460
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:55,839
week and we think about this day, Palm Sunday, the triumphal entry and the people shouting

461
00:26:55,839 --> 00:27:01,160
out Hosanna and all that's taking place, and then just a few days pass and they're

462
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:06,600
crying out, crucify him, crucify him, and we notice the record of his suffering, but

463
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:11,399
we're reminded this morning of the reason for his suffering.

464
00:27:11,399 --> 00:27:19,160
I hope that when you read the gospel accounts, when you read of Christ's suffering, that

465
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,440
you understand that he did it for you.

466
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,519
He took my place.

467
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:28,839
He paid a debt that he did not owe.

468
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:32,640
He paid my debt that I could not pay.

469
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:39,399
There's nothing that you could ever do to pay for your sin, it's just not possible.

470
00:27:39,399 --> 00:27:41,440
But Jesus paid it all.

471
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,839
Isn't that wonderful?

472
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:46,000
All to him I owe.

473
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Sin had left a crimson stain, but what does it say?

474
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,519
He washed it white as snow.

475
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:57,640
Think about the truth of Isaiah, come, let us reason together.

476
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:04,279
Oh, they had sins, they were scarlet, so I'll make them white.

477
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:09,839
We think about the truth of the record and the reason, but I want you to think this morning

478
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:17,279
finally as we look at this portion in 1 Peter 3, number 3, the result of his suffering,

479
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:18,760
the result of his suffering.

480
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,559
Notice how Peter mentions it here in 1 Peter 3 and verse 18.

481
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,359
I love the terminology that is used.

482
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:27,839
Obviously, Peter's writing under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God, but the Bible says

483
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:34,719
this, that for Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, and then

484
00:28:34,719 --> 00:28:44,119
notice this phrase, that he, Christ, might bring us, sinners, to God.

485
00:28:44,119 --> 00:28:49,640
That's the result, the miracle of reconciliation.

486
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:54,799
It's a word that perhaps we don't use very often outside of the context of church and

487
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:59,880
the biblical truth of reconciliation, but oh, what a beautiful word it is, a word that

488
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:06,640
we ought to be familiar with in our vocabulary and understanding this word, reconciliation.

489
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,640
This is what it means.

490
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:18,380
It means the means by which sinners are reconciled and brought into a state of favor with God.

491
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:21,739
What was their natural estrangement or enmity?

492
00:29:21,739 --> 00:29:23,619
What was the natural estrangement or enmity?

493
00:29:23,619 --> 00:29:27,099
You were born.

494
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:31,580
You were born, and you were born at enmity with God.

495
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,739
Why?

496
00:29:32,739 --> 00:29:35,119
Because you're a sinner.

497
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:36,500
But don't think it's something strange.

498
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,500
We're all sinners.

499
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,820
You say, well, that's terrible.

500
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:42,460
No, we all are.

501
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:51,299
Every single person that's born, outside of the Lord Jesus Christ, virgin birth, we're

502
00:29:51,299 --> 00:29:54,580
all sinners.

503
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:57,140
And the Bible says that we were at enmity.

504
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:59,620
But what did he do?

505
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:08,340
He died, he suffered that he might bring us to God, reconciliation.

506
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:12,780
That means by which sinners are reconciled and notice what it says, brought into a state

507
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:16,620
of favor with God.

508
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:21,900
See the book of Romans words it this way, in Romans chapter number 5 and verse number

509
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:24,620
1, again a verse that many of us would be familiar with.

510
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:29,540
In Romans 5 and verse number 1 teaches us about this peace with God and it says, therefore

511
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:34,500
being justified by faith, we have peace with God.

512
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,780
It's not a period there.

513
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:39,500
It then says through our Lord Jesus Christ.

514
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:43,140
The only way to have peace with God is through Jesus.

515
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,620
So this idea of reconciliation this morning.

516
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:50,420
So you have to understand that sinners are at enmity with God.

517
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,260
Why did Jesus go to the cross?

518
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,260
Why did he suffer the way that he did?

519
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:57,020
Why did he suffer such torment and agony?

520
00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:02,340
Why did he go through all of those things that he might bring us to God?

521
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:08,380
It was the only way that mankind could be reconciled.

522
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:11,940
There's no other way, no other hope.

523
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:19,580
I'm thankful that though we read those portions of scripture, the house of Caiaphas and before

524
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:26,780
Pilate at Golgotha, I'm thankful that John 19 and verse number 30 records this statement

525
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:32,420
of Jesus Christ when he said, it is finished.

526
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:34,260
Hallelujah.

527
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,760
He paid the price.

528
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:42,740
As we go through this week and we obviously come up to next Sunday, Resurrection Sunday

529
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:48,980
and oh, what a precious truth that our God lives and that he conquered sin, death and

530
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:49,980
the grave.

531
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:53,980
But understand with me this morning that as we go through this week and we're reminded

532
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:59,100
of his suffering, all that he endured for us, he took my place.

533
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:02,060
He took your place.

534
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:07,700
Ephesians chapter number one talks to us about the fact that he brought our eternal salvation

535
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:11,900
with his precious blood.

536
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:16,140
If you look at Ephesians chapter number one, you'll notice within the text of scripture

537
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:20,900
how that God reveals to us in that portion the plan for redemption, that there's only

538
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:23,540
one way for man to be redeemed.

539
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:28,180
So often people would misinterpret Ephesians chapter number one and they would love to

540
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:32,660
run through this portion of scripture and talk about election and foreknowledge and

541
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:35,300
all of these things in Calvinistic doctrine.

542
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:39,740
But understand with me this morning in a very real way that Ephesians chapter number one

543
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:46,940
is not talking about, it is not talking about the who of salvation.

544
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:51,260
Ephesians chapter number one is talking about the how of salvation.

545
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,740
And there's a great difference.

546
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:54,820
And what do I mean by that?

547
00:32:54,820 --> 00:33:01,260
As you study Ephesians chapter number one, you find that God did in fact, in his foreknowledge,

548
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:08,380
he did determine and it's predetermined that there's only one way for man to be saved.

549
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:10,900
How will mankind be saved?

550
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:13,420
Through Jesus Christ.

551
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:16,180
Ephesians one is not talking about the who of salvation.

552
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:18,060
It's the how.

553
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,980
You talk to somebody about how did you get saved?

554
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,860
Well there's only one way to get saved.

555
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:22,860
Amen?

556
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,860
There's only one way.

557
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,660
What did Jesus say to Nicodemus?

558
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:30,740
Ye must be born again.

559
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:37,540
And though the circumstances surrounding your conversion and your salvation may differ from

560
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:42,660
one person to another, the similarity between each and every one of us that have a testimony

561
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:46,620
of salvation is that there must have been a time in your life that you recognized you

562
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:50,020
were a sinner.

563
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:54,460
And you recognize that your sin carried with it a penalty.

564
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:59,100
For the wages of sin is death.

565
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,660
And you recognize, yes, that's me, I'm a sinner.

566
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:04,720
And yes, I'm guilty and I owe this payment.

567
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,920
But you recognize that Jesus paid it all.

568
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,560
He took my place.

569
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,520
He said I'll pay that debt for you.

570
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,680
Because I love you.

571
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,600
The just for the unjust.

572
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:21,960
And he went to that cross of Calvary and he suffered and he bled and he died.

573
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:26,720
We know that he was buried in a borrowed tomb and we know that he rose conquering sin, death

574
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:30,960
and the grave and how glorious that is.

575
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:35,520
And this morning, the way of salvation, we understand it's only through Jesus.

576
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:42,720
We recognize I'm a sinner and I'm guilty and there's a penalty, but Jesus paid the price.

577
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:46,160
And now what I must do is accept the free gift of eternal life.

578
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:54,480
See, because the Bible says, for the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal

579
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,520
life through Jesus Christ, our Lord.

580
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:01,880
I'm so thankful for that little word, but, conjunction.

581
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:10,440
For the wage of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ,

582
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,240
our Lord.

583
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:16,520
This morning there's a great difference between a wage and a gift.

584
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,520
We understand that.

585
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,760
We know what it is to work for a wage.

586
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,120
We labor.

587
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:27,400
At the end of your pay period, your employer does not come to you and say, here's a gift

588
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,400
for you.

589
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,760
No, I earned that, right?

590
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,760
It's a wage.

591
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:39,080
If I say to you, hey Tim, I need you to wash my car and I'll give you, you know, 20 bucks.

592
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:44,000
That's cheap, by the way, nowadays, but it's a wage.

593
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,520
You had to work for it.

594
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,880
You can't work for your salvation.

595
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:53,240
You can't work for a gift.

596
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,000
You know what you do with a gift?

597
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,840
You have two things.

598
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:01,360
You receive it or you reject it.

599
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:07,160
It is absolutely possible for people to reject gifts.

600
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:14,040
Though it's not common within our culture to reject a gift, so many people reject the

601
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,040
gift that God offers.

602
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:19,280
God says, I have a gift for you.

603
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,200
The gift that I have for you is eternal life.

604
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,200
I paid for it.

605
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:28,880
I didn't just make a down payment on it and then you have to somehow earn the rest.

606
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,880
No, no, no.

607
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:35,520
I paid for all of it and it's free and it's yours.

608
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,160
If you want it, you just receive it.

609
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:44,760
The Bible says, for whosoever, I love that word because you can put your name in there

610
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:50,760
and anybody you talk to can put their name in there, for whosoever shall call upon the

611
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:55,360
name of the Lord shall be saved.

612
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:58,120
We sang this morning, He's a wonderful Savior to me.

613
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,120
Hallelujah.

614
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:02,680
I remember the day I got saved.

615
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:08,560
Precious, precious day in my life.

616
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,280
And He's a wonderful Savior to me.

617
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:18,840
But the truth is that you can sing if you've been saved, He's a wonderful Savior to me.

618
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:27,640
And someone that you talk to this week or this month that's never been saved, God loves

619
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:34,800
them and will save them and then they too can sing, He's a wonderful Savior to me.

620
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,800
Wow.

621
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:44,280
I think about what the Bible says in the book of Hebrews, so often I'm guilty of quoting

622
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:51,160
just the first few words of Hebrews 12 in verse number 2.

623
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:57,640
In fact, in the year 2020, our theme for our church was looking unto Jesus from this particular

624
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:01,320
verse of Scripture and I preach through the book of Hebrews.

625
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:07,760
But we find here in Hebrews 12 and verse number 2 that the Bible says, looking unto Jesus,

626
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:12,120
the author and finisher of our faith.

627
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:20,440
And then notice these words, who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross,

628
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:26,360
despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.

629
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:31,799
I want you to understand this morning that though His suffering was great, He willingly

630
00:38:31,799 --> 00:38:37,720
suffered for you because He understood what the result would be.

631
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:44,040
He understood that the only way for you, for me, for any human being to be reconciled

632
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:49,739
to God was if He died in our place, was the only way.

633
00:38:49,739 --> 00:38:58,679
That's what God had predetermined and the Bible says that He might bring us to God.

634
00:38:58,679 --> 00:39:03,720
After salvation, we understand, the Bible teaches us this morning, the wonderful truth

635
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:11,280
that Jesus is my Savior, that He's, God is my Father, that I have that access directly

636
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:19,679
to the throne room of heaven that we can cry out, Abba, Father, wow, precious, that He

637
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:23,160
might bring us to God.

638
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:29,559
The Bible continues and says, being put to death in the flesh but quickened by the Spirit,

639
00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:33,640
I'm thankful that the grave could not hold Him.

640
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,960
Aren't you thankful?

641
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,200
Next week, we'll sing some wonderful songs about the resurrection.

642
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:41,440
Oh, what wonderful songs there are.

643
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:45,040
I love that one, Up from the Grave Heroes.

644
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,440
Oh, what a great song.

645
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:54,559
I think about the music of that song, the way God has gifted our musicians to play that

646
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:57,160
song and you sing through the verses.

647
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:03,400
verse of that song, but then it builds up to that chorus, up from the grave He arose.

648
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:14,180
Man, that'd make you shout. Rejoice and glorify our God. See, He suffered for us. The record

649
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:19,840
is given. The reason is understood. It's because you're a sinner and I'm a sinner. And the

650
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:29,080
result is that man can be reconciled to God. Yes, as we look at this portion of Scripture,

651
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:34,520
we can thank God for the truth that He took my place. I hope this morning that as we have

652
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:39,560
in just a moment of time of invitation, I hope this morning that if you're saved, you've

653
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:43,640
trusted Christ as your Savior, you've been born again, I hope that you take some time

654
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:52,520
and thank God for salvation. That He took your place. Maybe this morning there's one

655
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:58,400
that's not sure of heaven. You could not say with certainty this morning that heaven is

656
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,720
your home. There's never been a time in your life where you understood that you were a

657
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:06,400
sinner and that Christ is the only Savior. Maybe you've been trusting in some works

658
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:11,520
that you could do, maybe some other philosophy. Maybe, I don't know what the other thing might

659
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:15,600
be, but you understood for the very first time today that Jesus said, I am the way,

660
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:21,280
the truth, and the life. No man cometh unto the Father but by me. And for the very first

661
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,600
time you might have understood, or maybe for the thousandth time, but you've rejected

662
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:33,840
it over and over, but you now understand that He took my place, He died for me. And He said

663
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:44,440
that He might bring us to God this morning. I would say that today is the day of salvation.

664
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:51,640
But I want to make this final appeal to you this morning. As we have this time of invitation,

665
00:41:51,640 --> 00:42:00,680
I wonder if you'd make a commitment, not to me, but to God. That this week, that some

666
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:07,400
would refer to as a holy week and all the events that took place, would you make a commitment

667
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:15,760
to God this week that you'll tell somebody that He took their place? See, it's wonderful

668
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:21,080
to know that He took my place, but He didn't reveal that to you so that you just keep it

669
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:27,320
to yourself. Maybe this week, maybe a neighbor that you've been praying for in the month

670
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:32,440
of March had that opportunity to go and talk to them and say, I just wanted to let you

671
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:40,880
know that Jesus took your place. He loved you so much that He died for you. The just

672
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:47,840
for the unjust. And would you this week really pray that God would give you an opportunity,

673
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:53,200
make a commitment to the Lord. I'm going to tell somebody how much God loves them and

674
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:59,480
how God took their place so that they might have salvation, that they could be reconciled

675
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:04,880
to be brought back to God. This morning, wonderful thought that's on my mind. I shared it with

676
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:11,960
a couple of preacher friends. The simple title of the song that we sing, Hallelujah, What

677
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:17,440
a Savior. I really don't know what else to say when you think about all these truths

678
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:24,040
other than Hallelujah, What a Savior. Let's pray together. Father, we love You. God, we

679
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:30,080
thank You for loving us. We thank You for the privilege that You've given us this morning

680
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:35,680
to gather together. God, we thank You for Your Word, the truth of Your Word, the power

681
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:42,640
of Your Word. God, I pray that each and every one that's here that has been saved, they've

682
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:49,760
been redeemed with the precious blood of Christ, that God, You would help us to rejoice

683
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:56,840
in our salvation. Father, if there's one that's never been saved, I pray that this morning

684
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:03,720
they would understand how much You love them and how You died for them so that they might

685
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:10,880
have eternal life, be reconciled. I pray, God, that You'd help each one of us that are

686
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:21,840
saved to make that commitment, not to some person, but God, to You. We'd take the truth

687
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:29,560
of the gospel, we'd share it with somebody this week, to tell them how You took their

688
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:37,800
place on that cruel cross. The story doesn't end there. We're so thankful for the resurrection.

689
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:45,240
God, I pray that You'd use us this week, that You might be glorified. Move and work

690
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:51,040
in these moments as only You can. We'll thank You for it in Christ's name we pray. Would

691
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,520
You stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.
