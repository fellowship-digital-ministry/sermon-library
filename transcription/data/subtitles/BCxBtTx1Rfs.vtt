00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.119
chapter number three this morning, 1 Peter chapter number three, this Sunday is often

00:00:06.119 --> 00:00:12.399
referred to as Palm Sunday. And of course, you would recognize that with regard to the

00:00:12.399 --> 00:00:18.280
triumphal entry of the Lord Jesus Christ. And as we look at this portion of scripture

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:24.920
this morning, I want to remind us of a great truth that the Bible reveals to us. As you

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:31.040
study the pages of scripture, you'll find a truth, a teaching, a principle that we often

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:38.639
use the phrase to refer to it as the substitutionary atonement. And we see this principle revealed

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:44.520
in the Old Testament and we find the perfect fulfillment with the Lord Jesus Christ when

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:51.200
He took my place, when He took your place on the cross of Calvary. This morning, as

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:57.240
we look at 1 Peter 3 and verse number 18, the Bible says this, for Christ also hath

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:05.040
once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust. You see that there? That's how it's worded,

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.279
that substitutionary atonement in the text that we're looking at this morning, the just

00:01:10.279 --> 00:01:15.160
for the unjust. Who's the just? Well, that's the Lord Jesus Christ. Who's the unjust? All

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:25.839
of us. He took our place. Notice when it says that He might bring us to God, being

00:01:25.839 --> 00:01:33.599
put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit. We find that the Bible says it

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:40.279
this way in 2 Corinthians 5 and verse 21, for He hath made Him, that's God the Father,

00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:48.800
made Him, God the Son, to be sin for us who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:55.080
of God in Him, the substitutionary atonement. You think about the Old Testament. You think

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.120
about the sacrifices. You think about Adam and Eve in the garden. You think about the

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:05.639
animal that was slain so that the coverings could be provided. See, because those fig

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.600
leaves, those aprons of fig leaves were not sufficient, and we find that there was a,

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.360
the blood was required, there was an animal that was sacrificed. You think about the offering

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.759
that takes place of Cain and Abel, and of course, one that's appropriate, one that's

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:27.880
inappropriate, the one that comes with the blood is the accepted offering. You think

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:34.720
about Abraham as he would sacrifice his son Isaac on Mount Moriah, and God provides a

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.000
sanctuary. You think about the Exodus as the children of Israel would leave the land

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000
of Egypt in that final plague, the death of the firstborn. You think about the blood that

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.960
had to be applied. And then they were to observe the Passover annually, not only so that they

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:57.399
would remember what happened in Egypt and how God brought them out, but so that they

00:02:57.399 --> 00:03:05.279
would look forward by faith to one day, Christ, our Passover. We find this morning that as

00:03:05.279 --> 00:03:10.919
we would think about and understand the timing historically of the events that transpired

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:16.600
nearly 2,000 years ago now, we find that the Lord Jesus Christ on this particular Sunday

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.559
that we would see on our calendars and reference in our minds as being Palm Sunday and the

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:26.619
triumphal entry of the Lord Jesus Christ, you would hear the shouts of the people as

00:03:26.619 --> 00:03:31.380
it's recorded in John's Gospel in the 12th chapter in verse number 13 when they say,

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:38.460
Hosanna, blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord. But just a

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:49.300
few short days after His triumphal entry, those people that were shouting, Hosanna,

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:58.220
now the shouts that can be heard are, crucify Him! Crucify Him! You think about just in

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:05.500
a few days how things change so dramatically. But the events of the crucifixion were not

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.320
a surprise to the Lord Jesus Christ. He knew that it was for that cause, that purpose,

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:17.820
this hour that He came to this sin-cursed world. The incarnation, the entire purpose

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:23.579
of Jesus becoming flesh and God taking on the form of human nature was so that He could

00:04:23.579 --> 00:04:30.579
die in our place, the substitutionary atonement. So you know an angel could not die for you

00:04:30.579 --> 00:04:36.980
or for me. I can't die for you and you can't die for me to pay for my sin. It required

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:43.619
that God in flesh, the Lord Jesus Christ, took our place, the substitutionary atonement.

00:04:43.619 --> 00:04:50.660
I titled the message this morning, He Took My Place. No doubt as you are familiar with

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:56.220
the account in the Gospels, you'll be familiar with a man's name by Barabbas. You understand

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:02.619
that he was a man that was a criminal, that was sentenced to death. And truly as you think

00:05:02.619 --> 00:05:07.940
about the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ and as we have in our mind's eye the understanding

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:17.299
of Jesus crucified and on either side a thief. In a very real way, that cross was the cross

00:05:17.299 --> 00:05:25.059
for Barabbas. But in a spiritual application this morning, that cross was my cross and

00:05:25.059 --> 00:05:33.079
that cross was your cross. But God loved us so much that He took my place. It's amazing.

00:05:33.079 --> 00:05:38.760
As we look here at our text of Scripture, the Bible says in verse 18, for Christ also

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:45.880
hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God,

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.640
being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit. If you're taking notes this

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:56.380
morning, I want you to notice with me first of all the record of His suffering. The record

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:00.839
of His suffering. The Bible tells us here in this text of Scripture that Christ also

00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:05.799
hath once suffered. I want you to notice that within the book of 1 Peter, if you go

00:06:05.799 --> 00:06:10.760
back to the second chapter, perhaps on the same page in your Bible, on verse number 21,

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:16.320
the Bible says this, in 1 Peter 2 and verse 21, for even here unto where ye called, notice

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:24.559
what the Bible says, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example that ye should

00:06:24.559 --> 00:06:31.619
follow His steps. He goes on to say this, who did no sin, neither was guile found in

00:06:31.619 --> 00:06:39.700
His mouth. The just for the unjust. The substitutionary atonement. You find that Peter would say this

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:44.019
in 1 Peter chapter number 5 and verse number 1, notice what he says, the elders which are

00:06:44.019 --> 00:06:50.940
among you, I exhort whom also an elder, notice what he says here, and a witness of the sufferings

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:55.980
of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed. It's interesting to

00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:00.459
me that here in the book of 1 Peter, we find that in chapter number 2, he mentions about

00:07:00.459 --> 00:07:05.260
the fact that Christ suffered for us, leaving us an example that we should follow His steps.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:10.579
The Bible tells us in the third chapter that Christ hath also suffered for sins. We find

00:07:10.579 --> 00:07:15.700
that Peter will then, the human penman of this particular book, says listen, I was a

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:22.500
witness of the sufferings of Christ. Hold your place here in the book of 1 Peter, but

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:26.940
turn over to the gospel of Luke, if you will. We're going to look at two portions of Scripture,

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:33.420
one in Luke and one in Matthew. As we think about the record of His suffering, the record

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:37.500
of His suffering, in Luke chapter number 22, if you would turn there, and then we'll turn

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:43.899
to Matthew chapter 26 and 27, but I want you to notice that God provides us with a record

00:07:43.899 --> 00:07:51.899
here of the suffering of the Lord Jesus Christ. Remember, He's God. He's God, but He suffered

00:07:51.899 --> 00:07:59.779
greatly. It's amazing what He endured on the cross of Calvary. It's amazing when you think

00:07:59.779 --> 00:08:08.779
about the love that is displayed at Calvary. Here in Luke's gospel in the 22nd chapter

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:14.980
in verse number 54, notice what the Bible says, they took, then took they Him and led

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:20.859
Him and brought Him into the high priest's house, that's Caiaphas' house, and it says

00:08:20.859 --> 00:08:27.779
this, and Peter followed afar off. Now you'll recall with me that in 1 Peter 5 verse 1,

00:08:27.779 --> 00:08:32.739
a verse that we just read, that Peter says that I was a witness of the sufferings of

00:08:32.739 --> 00:08:37.219
Christ. When we come to Luke's gospel, we find here that the Bible tells us that when

00:08:37.219 --> 00:08:42.500
they take Jesus after the events in the Garden of Gethsemane, after He was betrayed with

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:48.219
a kiss, and we find that He's arrested, that they take Him to the house of Caiaphas. And

00:08:48.219 --> 00:08:54.859
the Bible tells us that Peter followed afar off. But I want you to think about what Peter

00:08:54.859 --> 00:09:02.520
witnessed. As you continue reading, the Bible says in this passage of Scripture, we of course

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:07.200
read about his denial, but I want you to skip down to verse 63 and just look at these three

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:12.159
verses and I want you to see the suffering of Christ. The Bible says the men that held

00:09:12.159 --> 00:09:19.840
Jesus mocked Him and smoked Him. When they had blindfolded Him, they struck Him on the

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:29.760
face and asked Him saying, prophesy, who is it that smoked thee? Many other things blasphemously

00:09:29.859 --> 00:09:39.659
spake they against Him. This is God Almighty, the Lord Jesus Christ, God in flesh. He suffered.

00:09:39.659 --> 00:09:44.020
The record is given to us of His sufferings and we see it here and we find that Peter

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:50.179
says I'm a witness of His sufferings and we find that God's given us a record of His sufferings.

00:09:50.179 --> 00:09:54.260
And we find here as you think about them mocking Him and smiting Him and you think about the

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:59.859
fact that they blindfolded Him and then they strike Him, they say prophesy, who is it

00:09:59.859 --> 00:10:00.020
that...

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:03.620
Is that smoke they?

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:07.700
Wow, what a scene.

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:09.240
Look over at Matthew's Gospel,

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:11.780
if you will, Matthew 26.

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:13.980
We'll read one verse in chapter 26

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:18.820
and then skip over to chapter 27.

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:29.720
In Matthew 26,

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:31.680
people bring Jesus and they say

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:34.600
that He's guilty of death.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:37.840
I want you to notice in verse 67,

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:42.640
the Bible says this.

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:44.640
In Matthew 26 and verse 67,

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:48.280
notice what the Bible says.

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:52.320
Then did they spit in His face

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.440
and buffeted Him,

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:57.760
and others smote Him with the palms

00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:58.960
of their hands.

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:01.000
We find the same record that we see

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.520
in Luke's Gospel where it says

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:03.400
in verse 68,

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:04.840
prophesy unto us thou Christ,

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:08.520
who is He that smote thee.

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.640
We find here that in this verse of Scripture,

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:12.520
the Bible says they spit in His face

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:17.320
and they buffeted Him.

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:20.120
He took my place.

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:26.120
You look in chapter 27 and look at verse 26.

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:28.280
In chapter 27 beginning in verse 26,

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:29.760
the Bible says this.

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:31.680
Then released He Barabbas unto them,

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:33.240
and when He had scourged Jesus,

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:35.520
He delivered Him to be crucified.

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:37.000
That scourging is to be whipped,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.080
and now if you think about the process

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:40.240
and time and what's happened

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:42.080
and Jesus being arrested there

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:43.320
in the Garden of Gethsemane

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:45.280
and going to the house of Caiaphas

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.080
as we've just read those references

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:48.880
and all that He endured there

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:50.400
at the house of Caiaphas,

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:52.960
and then after He'd spent the night there

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:54.120
in the house of Caiaphas,

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:56.120
they take Him to Pilate

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:57.520
to be judged of Pilate,

00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:58.960
and that's where we pick it up here

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:01.080
in this portion of Scripture.

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:02.880
You find that in chapter 27

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:04.120
beginning in verse number 26,

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.680
it says that He delivered Him

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.520
to be crucified after they'd whipped Him

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:08.360
and crucified Him,

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:09.840
and look at verse 27.

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:11.160
The Bible says then the soldiers

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.600
of the governor took Jesus

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:13.880
into the common hall

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:14.960
and gathered unto Him

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:16.480
the whole band of soldiers

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:17.480
and they stripped Him

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:19.520
and put on Him a scarlet robe.

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:21.280
When they had plaited a crown of thorns,

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:23.040
they put it upon His head

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:24.480
and a reed in His right hand

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.000
and they bowed the knee before Him

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.560
and mocked Him saying,

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:30.520
Hail, King of the Jews.

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:32.240
They spit upon Him

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:35.600
and took the reed and smote Him on the head.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.280
And after they had mocked Him,

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:39.040
they took the robe off from Him

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:40.640
and put His own raiment on Him

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:44.640
and led Him away to crucify Him.

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:45.640
And as they came out,

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.120
they found a man of Cyrene,

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:49.160
Simon by name.

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:52.160
Him they compelled to bear His cross.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.440
They were come unto a place called Golgotha,

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:57.160
as to say a place of a skull.

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:58.680
They gave Him vinegar to drink

00:12:58.680 --> 00:12:59.720
mingled with gall

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:02.280
and when He had tasted thereof,

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:03.280
He would not drink

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:05.200
and they crucified Him.

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.120
Parted His garments,

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.840
casting lots that it might be fulfilled

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:09.480
which was spoken by the prophet.

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:11.120
They parted My garments among them

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:13.840
and upon My vesture did they cast lots.

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:14.640
And sitting down,

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:16.440
they watched Him there.

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:20.040
Can you imagine?

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:25.640
They sat down and they watched Him.

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:29.720
The Romans sought to,

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:32.320
in a really strange way,

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.880
become experts of crucifixion.

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:37.720
To master that process.

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:38.720
So that they can inflict

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:40.160
as much torment and pain

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.120
on the individual that's being crucified.

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.840
So that the death could be as long

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:45.800
and drawn out as possible.

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:47.680
So they didn't want it to just be a fast death.

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:51.200
They wanted it to be a torturous death.

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.400
And they did all that they could

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:53.440
to try to master,

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:57.000
to become experts at this process of crucifixion.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.680
And here Jesus is on the cross

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:00.320
and the Bible says that they sat down

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.400
and they watched Him there.

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:02.880
And notice it says in verse 37,

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:04.120
they set up over His head

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.240
His accusation written,

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:09.360
this is Jesus the King of the Jews.

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:11.640
I want you to think about this scene

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:13.200
as the record of His suffering

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.360
is given to us

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:16.120
and we begin to read

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:17.720
these portions of Scripture.

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.560
No doubt for many of us this morning,

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:22.680
familiar passages of Scripture.

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:23.960
I took time this week

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:25.680
as I was meditating upon

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:27.000
the portions of Scripture

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.600
and as I was meditating upon

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:29.520
all this taking place

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:31.040
and I took the time

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:32.800
even this morning to go back

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:34.480
and look at some pictures

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.520
that I took while I stood

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:37.560
in what is believed to be

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:41.800
the house of Caiaphas.

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:44.560
And you see the place

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:47.280
where Jesus suffered.

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:49.480
Brother Sammy, you've been there.

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:53.400
It's amazing.

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:55.120
He took my place.

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:56.800
He took your place.

00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:00.640
Why? Because He loves you.

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:02.880
I stood at the place,

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:05.720
the hidden gate as it's called,

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:06.840
where Jesus would have stood

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:08.400
before Pilate believing

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:11.400
that that's where it took place.

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:13.800
You think about all the things

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:15.680
that you've read in the Bible,

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:16.800
all of these portions

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:19.160
that I've just read to you,

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:22.960
and you're standing there.

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:25.680
And the very real truth

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:28.240
of what God did

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:31.000
for undeserving sinners.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.680
It's amazing.

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:37.760
When we're in the house of Caiaphas,

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:41.040
I have a video of singing

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:43.080
amazing love.

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:47.560
How can it be?

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:49.000
It's powerful.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.840
You don't have to be there

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:52.600
as I had the privilege of being there

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:56.880
to see the record of His sufferings.

00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:58.040
But I'll tell you this morning

00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:00.400
that God records for us

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:04.240
this truth of the substitutionary atonement.

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:07.240
And He tells us that Christ,

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:09.440
as we read in our portion of Scripture

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:11.120
there in 1 Peter 3,

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:12.680
the way that He words it there,

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:18.880
for Christ also hath once suffered.

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:20.760
The record of His suffering.

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:22.160
But I want you to understand this morning

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:25.560
the reason for His suffering.

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:26.360
If we say number one

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:27.520
is the record of His suffering,

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:28.360
number two this morning

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:31.360
would be the reason for His suffering.

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:32.760
And it's those two words

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:35.200
in verse 18 of 1 Peter 3

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:35.960
where the Bible says,

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:41.880
for Christ also hath once suffered four sins.

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:44.160
That's the reason for His suffering.

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:45.920
The reason.

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:48.640
Though God created man perfect

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:51.080
in a perfect environment.

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:54.280
You read the record of the Genesis account

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:56.280
and the creation of the world

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:57.760
and the creation of mankind,

00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:00.320
you find that God created man perfect

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:02.160
in His own image.

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:03.440
But the Bible goes on to tell us

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:04.680
in Genesis 3,

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:07.240
the record is given where man sinned

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:11.400
and sin entered into the world.

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:14.600
Now that did not surprise God.

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:17.680
God knew that man would sin.

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:19.280
In fact, the Bible teaches us

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:21.120
that Jesus is the Lamb of God

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:24.200
that's slain before the foundation of the world.

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:28.080
Why? Because He knew that man would sin.

00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:29.560
That's why Jesus could say,

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:31.840
for this cause, for this reason,

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:35.120
came I into the world.

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:36.360
That's why Paul could say

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:37.920
that this is a faithful saying

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.240
and worthy of all acceptation

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:41.120
that Christ Jesus came into the world

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:44.160
to save sinners.

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:45.600
We see the record of His suffering,

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:46.720
but we understand this morning

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:49.720
the reason for His suffering is for sins.

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:52.360
Notice the consequence of sin

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:53.520
there in the garden.

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.120
The consequence of that action

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:58.080
when they ate of that fruit of the tree

00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:59.480
that was forbidden.

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:01.080
We find that the Bible tells us

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:04.680
that single action has had an impact

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:06.120
on all of humanity.

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:08.520
In Romans chapter number five,

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:10.520
if you want to take the time to turn there,

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:12.120
the Bible reveals to us

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:13.320
in that portion of Scripture

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:15.480
this truth that we're dealing with this morning,

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:17.680
the reason for Christ's suffering.

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:21.200
And we find here that the Bible teaches us

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:23.920
and reveals to us this truth of sin

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:27.200
being passed to all mankind, all humanity.

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:29.560
Listen, it's a universal condition.

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:30.880
We're all sinners.

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:34.559
Some are saved by the grace of God

00:18:34.559 --> 00:18:36.360
and some are still lost.

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:38.040
We're all sinners.

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:39.480
Someone asked the question,

00:18:41.119 --> 00:18:42.360
what makes you a sinner?

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:43.920
Is it because you sin?

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:44.960
No.

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:47.080
Though that could be true that you could say that,

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:49.960
but the real truth, the root of the matter

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:53.360
is that we sin because we're sinners.

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:56.520
And in Romans five and verse number 12,

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:57.840
the Bible says it this way,

00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:02.640
wherefore as by one man, sin entered into the world.

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:03.920
That's Adam.

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:05.640
Genesis three.

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:08.600
The Bible says, and death by sin.

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:11.119
Remember Jesus said, if you eat, you're gonna die.

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:15.040
It's a spiritual death.

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:19.119
The Bible says, so death passed upon all men

00:19:19.119 --> 00:19:23.280
for that all have sinned.

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:24.720
It's a universal condition.

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:27.480
There's nothing unique about you or me

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:29.720
that we, oh, I can't believe I'm a sinner.

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:30.800
We're all sinners.

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:33.960
It's a universal condition.

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:35.559
But I'm thankful that if you go on to read

00:19:35.559 --> 00:19:37.480
the entirety of Romans chapter number five,

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:39.480
that there's a great comparison that takes place

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:43.520
between one man, Adam, and one man, the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:45.640
and how that Adam's transgression,

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:47.880
in fact, it impacted all mankind,

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:50.000
all of humanity that were born sinners.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.800
But Jesus Christ, born of a virgin, free from sin,

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:54.960
he did no sin.

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.559
There's no guile found in his mouth.

00:19:56.559 --> 00:20:00.000
He's perfect, he's the just, that through his sacrifice.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.279
sacrifice, mankind can be redeemed.

00:20:03.279 --> 00:20:04.840
It's amazing.

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:08.920
The Bible tells us in this portion of Scripture in verse number 8, but God commended His love

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:14.479
toward us and that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.

00:20:14.479 --> 00:20:16.440
Christ died for us.

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:21.159
Sin requires a payment.

00:20:21.159 --> 00:20:22.559
Sin requires a payment.

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:31.120
And the only acceptable payment for sin is the precious blood of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:34.880
So I'm trying to be a good person.

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:38.200
It's commendable to try to be a good person.

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:42.759
When you look in society, it's commendable.

00:20:42.759 --> 00:20:46.400
Almost everyone I talk to when I ask them, are you a sinner, I've never murdered anyone.

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:53.560
And I'm like, I'm really happy to hear that.

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:57.080
Sin is transgression of the law.

00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:59.919
And sin requires payment.

00:20:59.919 --> 00:21:03.000
Look over to the book of Romans if you, or excuse me, Hebrews if you will, chapter number

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.000
9.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.919
Look at Hebrews chapter number 9.

00:21:06.919 --> 00:21:12.500
We think about this truth of sin requiring a payment, the reason for his suffering.

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:14.580
We read the record of his suffering.

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:18.459
We read what took place there at the house of Caiaphas.

00:21:18.459 --> 00:21:23.500
We read what took place before Pilate and as they led him to the place called Golgotha,

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:25.699
the place of a skull to be crucified.

00:21:25.699 --> 00:21:29.940
We've read those portions and we see the record of Christ's suffering, but we see the reason

00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:31.699
is for sins.

00:21:31.699 --> 00:21:36.800
See the Bible says this in Hebrews 9 and verse 22, and almost all things are by the law purged

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:37.800
with blood.

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:43.839
The Bible actually says, and without shedding of blood is no remission.

00:21:43.839 --> 00:21:49.400
The Bible goes on to say, if you pick it up in the 10th chapter in verse number 1, and

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:55.599
this is just a precious verse, the Bible says, for the law having a shadow of good things

00:21:55.599 --> 00:21:56.599
to come.

00:21:56.599 --> 00:21:58.120
And really that's exactly what it is.

00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:00.440
It's a shadow of good things to come.

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:04.120
You read the Old Testament, you read about the prophecies, you read all of the things

00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:07.160
within the law and all of the sacrificial systems.

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:11.199
People get bogged down in the book of Leviticus and they say, what is all of this talking

00:22:11.199 --> 00:22:12.199
about?

00:22:12.199 --> 00:22:18.639
And you find that it's wonderful, beautiful pictures of how Jesus would fulfill all of

00:22:18.639 --> 00:22:23.119
those sacrifices and all of those offerings.

00:22:23.119 --> 00:22:28.160
We find, the Bible says, that the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:29.759
very image of the things.

00:22:29.759 --> 00:22:32.720
Listen, you know what a shadow is?

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:40.880
You can't hug a shadow, but you can see a shadow, there's a substance in it.

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:46.240
And it says here that it's a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:52.960
things can never, with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually, make

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:54.860
the comers thereunto perfect.

00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:58.039
They offered blood sacrifices, they offered them repeatedly.

00:22:58.039 --> 00:23:02.639
If you have in your mind's eye a picture of the tabernacle and then you fast forward

00:23:02.639 --> 00:23:06.880
to the temple and you see the offerings and you think about the tabernacle in particular

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:11.360
and you'd come and the first piece of furniture, there's only one entrance by the way to the

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:16.240
tabernacle because there's only one way to God and that's through the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:19.839
We find that through that one entrance, the very first piece of furniture that you would

00:23:19.839 --> 00:23:21.839
come to is the brazen altar.

00:23:21.839 --> 00:23:22.839
And why?

00:23:22.839 --> 00:23:26.240
Because sacrifice is required.

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:30.160
Sacrifices had to be shed.

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:37.000
We find that they offered sacrifices, they offered sacrifices year by year, daily, but

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:42.399
those sacrifices could never make the comers thereunto perfect.

00:23:42.399 --> 00:23:46.520
Notice it says, for then would they not have ceased to be offered?

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:51.479
I mean, it's a simple understanding that if they could, if they could accomplish, if they

00:23:51.479 --> 00:23:55.919
could achieve, then there'd be no more need for those sacrifices.

00:23:55.919 --> 00:24:00.440
But it says, because the worshipers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins,

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:05.000
but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.979
Notice verse 4, for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take

00:24:09.979 --> 00:24:14.479
away sins.

00:24:14.479 --> 00:24:18.000
But it pictured one who would.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:24.760
By faith they could look forward with anticipation that one day Messiah is going to come.

00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:31.040
And Messiah, again, as Paul refers to him as he's talking to the church in Corinth,

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:33.959
Christ, our Passover.

00:24:33.959 --> 00:24:39.079
And we find that here as you continue to read, look at verse number 11 of chapter 10.

00:24:39.079 --> 00:24:44.000
The Bible says, and every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.600
the same sacrifices, notice where it says, which can never take away sins.

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:54.720
Can you imagine the responsibility, the role of the priest?

00:24:54.720 --> 00:25:00.100
Every day, continually.

00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:04.899
These sacrifices, these offerings, but they could never take away sins.

00:25:04.899 --> 00:25:09.959
They were a reminder that the people had sinned and they were a reminder that Messiah would

00:25:09.959 --> 00:25:11.119
come one day.

00:25:11.239 --> 00:25:15.920
And then we read in verse number 12, the shadow passing away in the very image of the Lord

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:17.040
Jesus Christ.

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:23.279
Here in verse number 12 it says, but this man, the Lord Jesus Christ, see the book of

00:25:23.279 --> 00:25:28.600
Hebrews is all about exalting Christ and how Christ is better, how Christ is superior.

00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:32.440
He's better than the angels, he's better than Moses, he's better than, he's better than

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:33.440
everything.

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:35.720
He's better than the, than the priesthood.

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:38.160
He's better than the sacrifice they make.

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:49.600
And it says that this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, hallelujah,

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:53.799
sat down on the right hand of God.

00:25:53.799 --> 00:26:00.519
Those people that put Jesus on the cross to crucify him, they sat down and watched him

00:26:00.519 --> 00:26:03.519
as he was paying for your sin and for my sin.

00:26:03.519 --> 00:26:09.119
But Jesus, after he had made that one sacrifice for sins forever, after he rose conquering

00:26:09.119 --> 00:26:14.720
sin, death, and the grave, hallelujah, he sat, the Bible says, on the right hand of

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:15.720
God.

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:18.640
The Bible tells us that he ever lives to make intercession for us.

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:22.959
The Bible tells us he's coming again and oh, how we look for his appearing.

00:26:22.959 --> 00:26:27.880
But I want you to see here in the text of Scripture that even as Peter would say in

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:35.559
chapter 3 and verse number 18, for Christ also hath once suffered for sins.

00:26:35.559 --> 00:26:42.119
Listen, that one sacrifice was good forever, accepted by God Almighty because it was a

00:26:42.119 --> 00:26:45.600
perfect sacrifice, sinless sacrifice.

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:50.160
So when we look at the passage of Scripture and we're reminded of what transpires this

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:55.839
week and we think about this day, Palm Sunday, the triumphal entry and the people shouting

00:26:55.839 --> 00:27:01.160
out Hosanna and all that's taking place, and then just a few days pass and they're

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:06.600
crying out, crucify him, crucify him, and we notice the record of his suffering, but

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:11.399
we're reminded this morning of the reason for his suffering.

00:27:11.399 --> 00:27:19.160
I hope that when you read the gospel accounts, when you read of Christ's suffering, that

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:21.440
you understand that he did it for you.

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:24.519
He took my place.

00:27:24.519 --> 00:27:28.839
He paid a debt that he did not owe.

00:27:28.839 --> 00:27:32.640
He paid my debt that I could not pay.

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:39.399
There's nothing that you could ever do to pay for your sin, it's just not possible.

00:27:39.399 --> 00:27:41.440
But Jesus paid it all.

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.839
Isn't that wonderful?

00:27:43.839 --> 00:27:46.000
All to him I owe.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000
Sin had left a crimson stain, but what does it say?

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.519
He washed it white as snow.

00:27:53.519 --> 00:27:57.640
Think about the truth of Isaiah, come, let us reason together.

00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:04.279
Oh, they had sins, they were scarlet, so I'll make them white.

00:28:04.279 --> 00:28:09.839
We think about the truth of the record and the reason, but I want you to think this morning

00:28:09.839 --> 00:28:17.279
finally as we look at this portion in 1 Peter 3, number 3, the result of his suffering,

00:28:17.279 --> 00:28:18.760
the result of his suffering.

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:21.559
Notice how Peter mentions it here in 1 Peter 3 and verse 18.

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:24.359
I love the terminology that is used.

00:28:24.359 --> 00:28:27.839
Obviously, Peter's writing under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God, but the Bible says

00:28:27.839 --> 00:28:34.719
this, that for Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, and then

00:28:34.719 --> 00:28:44.119
notice this phrase, that he, Christ, might bring us, sinners, to God.

00:28:44.119 --> 00:28:49.640
That's the result, the miracle of reconciliation.

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:54.799
It's a word that perhaps we don't use very often outside of the context of church and

00:28:54.799 --> 00:28:59.880
the biblical truth of reconciliation, but oh, what a beautiful word it is, a word that

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:06.640
we ought to be familiar with in our vocabulary and understanding this word, reconciliation.

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:07.640
This is what it means.

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:18.380
It means the means by which sinners are reconciled and brought into a state of favor with God.

00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:21.739
What was their natural estrangement or enmity?

00:29:21.739 --> 00:29:23.619
What was the natural estrangement or enmity?

00:29:23.619 --> 00:29:27.099
You were born.

00:29:27.099 --> 00:29:31.580
You were born, and you were born at enmity with God.

00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:32.739
Why?

00:29:32.739 --> 00:29:35.119
Because you're a sinner.

00:29:35.119 --> 00:29:36.500
But don't think it's something strange.

00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:37.500
We're all sinners.

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:39.820
You say, well, that's terrible.

00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:42.460
No, we all are.

00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:51.299
Every single person that's born, outside of the Lord Jesus Christ, virgin birth, we're

00:29:51.299 --> 00:29:54.580
all sinners.

00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:57.140
And the Bible says that we were at enmity.

00:29:57.140 --> 00:29:59.620
But what did he do?

00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:08.340
He died, he suffered that he might bring us to God, reconciliation.

00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:12.780
That means by which sinners are reconciled and notice what it says, brought into a state

00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:16.620
of favor with God.

00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:21.900
See the book of Romans words it this way, in Romans chapter number 5 and verse number

00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:24.620
1, again a verse that many of us would be familiar with.

00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:29.540
In Romans 5 and verse number 1 teaches us about this peace with God and it says, therefore

00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:34.500
being justified by faith, we have peace with God.

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:35.780
It's not a period there.

00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:39.500
It then says through our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:43.140
The only way to have peace with God is through Jesus.

00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:45.620
So this idea of reconciliation this morning.

00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:50.420
So you have to understand that sinners are at enmity with God.

00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:52.260
Why did Jesus go to the cross?

00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:54.260
Why did he suffer the way that he did?

00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:57.020
Why did he suffer such torment and agony?

00:30:57.020 --> 00:31:02.340
Why did he go through all of those things that he might bring us to God?

00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:08.380
It was the only way that mankind could be reconciled.

00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:11.940
There's no other way, no other hope.

00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:19.580
I'm thankful that though we read those portions of scripture, the house of Caiaphas and before

00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:26.780
Pilate at Golgotha, I'm thankful that John 19 and verse number 30 records this statement

00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:32.420
of Jesus Christ when he said, it is finished.

00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:34.260
Hallelujah.

00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:36.760
He paid the price.

00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:42.740
As we go through this week and we obviously come up to next Sunday, Resurrection Sunday

00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:48.980
and oh, what a precious truth that our God lives and that he conquered sin, death and

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:49.980
the grave.

00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:53.980
But understand with me this morning that as we go through this week and we're reminded

00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:59.100
of his suffering, all that he endured for us, he took my place.

00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:02.060
He took your place.

00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:07.700
Ephesians chapter number one talks to us about the fact that he brought our eternal salvation

00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:11.900
with his precious blood.

00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:16.140
If you look at Ephesians chapter number one, you'll notice within the text of scripture

00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:20.900
how that God reveals to us in that portion the plan for redemption, that there's only

00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:23.540
one way for man to be redeemed.

00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:28.180
So often people would misinterpret Ephesians chapter number one and they would love to

00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:32.660
run through this portion of scripture and talk about election and foreknowledge and

00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:35.300
all of these things in Calvinistic doctrine.

00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:39.740
But understand with me this morning in a very real way that Ephesians chapter number one

00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:46.940
is not talking about, it is not talking about the who of salvation.

00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:51.260
Ephesians chapter number one is talking about the how of salvation.

00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:53.740
And there's a great difference.

00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:54.820
And what do I mean by that?

00:32:54.820 --> 00:33:01.260
As you study Ephesians chapter number one, you find that God did in fact, in his foreknowledge,

00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:08.380
he did determine and it's predetermined that there's only one way for man to be saved.

00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:10.900
How will mankind be saved?

00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:13.420
Through Jesus Christ.

00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:16.180
Ephesians one is not talking about the who of salvation.

00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:18.060
It's the how.

00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:19.980
You talk to somebody about how did you get saved?

00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:21.860
Well there's only one way to get saved.

00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:22.860
Amen?

00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:24.860
There's only one way.

00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:26.660
What did Jesus say to Nicodemus?

00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:30.740
Ye must be born again.

00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:37.540
And though the circumstances surrounding your conversion and your salvation may differ from

00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:42.660
one person to another, the similarity between each and every one of us that have a testimony

00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:46.620
of salvation is that there must have been a time in your life that you recognized you

00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:50.020
were a sinner.

00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:54.460
And you recognize that your sin carried with it a penalty.

00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:59.100
For the wages of sin is death.

00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:01.660
And you recognize, yes, that's me, I'm a sinner.

00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:04.720
And yes, I'm guilty and I owe this payment.

00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:07.920
But you recognize that Jesus paid it all.

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:10.560
He took my place.

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:13.520
He said I'll pay that debt for you.

00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:15.680
Because I love you.

00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:17.600
The just for the unjust.

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:21.960
And he went to that cross of Calvary and he suffered and he bled and he died.

00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:26.720
We know that he was buried in a borrowed tomb and we know that he rose conquering sin, death

00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:30.960
and the grave and how glorious that is.

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:35.520
And this morning, the way of salvation, we understand it's only through Jesus.

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:42.720
We recognize I'm a sinner and I'm guilty and there's a penalty, but Jesus paid the price.

00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:46.160
And now what I must do is accept the free gift of eternal life.

00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:54.480
See, because the Bible says, for the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal

00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:57.520
life through Jesus Christ, our Lord.

00:34:57.520 --> 00:35:01.880
I'm so thankful for that little word, but, conjunction.

00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:10.440
For the wage of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ,

00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:12.240
our Lord.

00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:16.520
This morning there's a great difference between a wage and a gift.

00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:18.520
We understand that.

00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:20.760
We know what it is to work for a wage.

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:22.120
We labor.

00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:27.400
At the end of your pay period, your employer does not come to you and say, here's a gift

00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:28.400
for you.

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:31.760
No, I earned that, right?

00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:32.760
It's a wage.

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:39.080
If I say to you, hey Tim, I need you to wash my car and I'll give you, you know, 20 bucks.

00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:44.000
That's cheap, by the way, nowadays, but it's a wage.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.520
You had to work for it.

00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:49.880
You can't work for your salvation.

00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:53.240
You can't work for a gift.

00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:55.000
You know what you do with a gift?

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.840
You have two things.

00:35:56.840 --> 00:36:01.360
You receive it or you reject it.

00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:07.160
It is absolutely possible for people to reject gifts.

00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:14.040
Though it's not common within our culture to reject a gift, so many people reject the

00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:15.040
gift that God offers.

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:19.280
God says, I have a gift for you.

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:22.200
The gift that I have for you is eternal life.

00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:23.200
I paid for it.

00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:28.880
I didn't just make a down payment on it and then you have to somehow earn the rest.

00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:29.880
No, no, no.

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:35.520
I paid for all of it and it's free and it's yours.

00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:37.160
If you want it, you just receive it.

00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:44.760
The Bible says, for whosoever, I love that word because you can put your name in there

00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:50.760
and anybody you talk to can put their name in there, for whosoever shall call upon the

00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:55.360
name of the Lord shall be saved.

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:58.120
We sang this morning, He's a wonderful Savior to me.

00:36:58.120 --> 00:36:59.120
Hallelujah.

00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:02.680
I remember the day I got saved.

00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:08.560
Precious, precious day in my life.

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:11.280
And He's a wonderful Savior to me.

00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:18.840
But the truth is that you can sing if you've been saved, He's a wonderful Savior to me.

00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:27.640
And someone that you talk to this week or this month that's never been saved, God loves

00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:34.800
them and will save them and then they too can sing, He's a wonderful Savior to me.

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:35.800
Wow.

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:44.280
I think about what the Bible says in the book of Hebrews, so often I'm guilty of quoting

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:51.160
just the first few words of Hebrews 12 in verse number 2.

00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:57.640
In fact, in the year 2020, our theme for our church was looking unto Jesus from this particular

00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:01.320
verse of Scripture and I preach through the book of Hebrews.

00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:07.760
But we find here in Hebrews 12 and verse number 2 that the Bible says, looking unto Jesus,

00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:12.120
the author and finisher of our faith.

00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:20.440
And then notice these words, who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross,

00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:26.360
despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.

00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:31.799
I want you to understand this morning that though His suffering was great, He willingly

00:38:31.799 --> 00:38:37.720
suffered for you because He understood what the result would be.

00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:44.040
He understood that the only way for you, for me, for any human being to be reconciled

00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:49.739
to God was if He died in our place, was the only way.

00:38:49.739 --> 00:38:58.679
That's what God had predetermined and the Bible says that He might bring us to God.

00:38:58.679 --> 00:39:03.720
After salvation, we understand, the Bible teaches us this morning, the wonderful truth

00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:11.280
that Jesus is my Savior, that He's, God is my Father, that I have that access directly

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:19.679
to the throne room of heaven that we can cry out, Abba, Father, wow, precious, that He

00:39:19.679 --> 00:39:23.160
might bring us to God.

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:29.559
The Bible continues and says, being put to death in the flesh but quickened by the Spirit,

00:39:29.559 --> 00:39:33.640
I'm thankful that the grave could not hold Him.

00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:34.960
Aren't you thankful?

00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:38.200
Next week, we'll sing some wonderful songs about the resurrection.

00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:41.440
Oh, what wonderful songs there are.

00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:45.040
I love that one, Up from the Grave Heroes.

00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:47.440
Oh, what a great song.

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:54.559
I think about the music of that song, the way God has gifted our musicians to play that

00:39:54.559 --> 00:39:57.160
song and you sing through the verses.

00:39:57.160 --> 00:40:03.400
verse of that song, but then it builds up to that chorus, up from the grave He arose.

00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:14.180
Man, that'd make you shout. Rejoice and glorify our God. See, He suffered for us. The record

00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:19.840
is given. The reason is understood. It's because you're a sinner and I'm a sinner. And the

00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:29.080
result is that man can be reconciled to God. Yes, as we look at this portion of Scripture,

00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:34.520
we can thank God for the truth that He took my place. I hope this morning that as we have

00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:39.560
in just a moment of time of invitation, I hope this morning that if you're saved, you've

00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:43.640
trusted Christ as your Savior, you've been born again, I hope that you take some time

00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:52.520
and thank God for salvation. That He took your place. Maybe this morning there's one

00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:58.400
that's not sure of heaven. You could not say with certainty this morning that heaven is

00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:01.720
your home. There's never been a time in your life where you understood that you were a

00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:06.400
sinner and that Christ is the only Savior. Maybe you've been trusting in some works

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:11.520
that you could do, maybe some other philosophy. Maybe, I don't know what the other thing might

00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:15.600
be, but you understood for the very first time today that Jesus said, I am the way,

00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:21.280
the truth, and the life. No man cometh unto the Father but by me. And for the very first

00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:25.600
time you might have understood, or maybe for the thousandth time, but you've rejected

00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:33.840
it over and over, but you now understand that He took my place, He died for me. And He said

00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:44.440
that He might bring us to God this morning. I would say that today is the day of salvation.

00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:51.640
But I want to make this final appeal to you this morning. As we have this time of invitation,

00:41:51.640 --> 00:42:00.680
I wonder if you'd make a commitment, not to me, but to God. That this week, that some

00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:07.400
would refer to as a holy week and all the events that took place, would you make a commitment

00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:15.760
to God this week that you'll tell somebody that He took their place? See, it's wonderful

00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:21.080
to know that He took my place, but He didn't reveal that to you so that you just keep it

00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:27.320
to yourself. Maybe this week, maybe a neighbor that you've been praying for in the month

00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:32.440
of March had that opportunity to go and talk to them and say, I just wanted to let you

00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:40.880
know that Jesus took your place. He loved you so much that He died for you. The just

00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:47.840
for the unjust. And would you this week really pray that God would give you an opportunity,

00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:53.200
make a commitment to the Lord. I'm going to tell somebody how much God loves them and

00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:59.480
how God took their place so that they might have salvation, that they could be reconciled

00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:04.880
to be brought back to God. This morning, wonderful thought that's on my mind. I shared it with

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:11.960
a couple of preacher friends. The simple title of the song that we sing, Hallelujah, What

00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:17.440
a Savior. I really don't know what else to say when you think about all these truths

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:24.040
other than Hallelujah, What a Savior. Let's pray together. Father, we love You. God, we

00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:30.080
thank You for loving us. We thank You for the privilege that You've given us this morning

00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:35.680
to gather together. God, we thank You for Your Word, the truth of Your Word, the power

00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:42.640
of Your Word. God, I pray that each and every one that's here that has been saved, they've

00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:49.760
been redeemed with the precious blood of Christ, that God, You would help us to rejoice

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:56.840
in our salvation. Father, if there's one that's never been saved, I pray that this morning

00:43:56.840 --> 00:44:03.720
they would understand how much You love them and how You died for them so that they might

00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:10.880
have eternal life, be reconciled. I pray, God, that You'd help each one of us that are

00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:21.840
saved to make that commitment, not to some person, but God, to You. We'd take the truth

00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:29.560
of the gospel, we'd share it with somebody this week, to tell them how You took their

00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:37.800
place on that cruel cross. The story doesn't end there. We're so thankful for the resurrection.

00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:45.240
God, I pray that You'd use us this week, that You might be glorified. Move and work

00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:51.040
in these moments as only You can. We'll thank You for it in Christ's name we pray. Would

00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:52.520
You stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.
