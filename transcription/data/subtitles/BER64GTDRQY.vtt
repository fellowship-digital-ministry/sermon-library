WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.159
And in those two messages, I dealt with behavior in God's church.

00:00:05.159 --> 00:00:08.619
I'm so thankful that the church is God's, that he's the head of the church, that he

00:00:08.619 --> 00:00:14.119
instituted the church, that he's instructed the church, that the church is God's idea.

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:19.040
And what a blessing to understand that, what a privilege it is to know the truth and to

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.000
be part of a local church.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.159
I'm so thankful for the local church and what the local church has done in my life.

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:31.799
I'm thankful that it was a local church, that God used a member of a local church to

00:00:31.799 --> 00:00:34.080
bring the gospel to my family.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.639
I'm so thankful that it was a local church that my dad and my mom went to, and they got

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:43.119
saved by the grace of God, and they started to grow, and they started bringing my brother

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:47.639
and I to church, and we eventually got saved as well and began to grow.

00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:52.200
And the local church has made such a difference in my life.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.119
Got to think about the privilege for these almost 13 years that God has given me to be

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:59.119
a pastor of a local church.

00:00:59.119 --> 00:01:05.120
What a unique privilege and a unique responsibility that God has entrusted me with, and I thank

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.199
him regularly for the opportunity.

00:01:08.199 --> 00:01:14.220
I'm thankful that the local church is not an organization as much as it's an organism.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.760
It's a living church, it's the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.

00:01:20.839 --> 00:01:26.480
And what a blessing to be involved with and to be engaged in the ministry of the local church.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.839
God has no backup plan for this era.

00:01:29.839 --> 00:01:33.800
His plan for this era is the local church.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.279
And he is the one that is the head of the church.

00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:38.680
He's the one that said, this is my church.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:45.300
He said, I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.860
What a blessing to be a part of the local New Testament church.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.459
As we think about the local church, when we think about behavior in God's church, we looked

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:58.620
at those two lessons and dealt with the instruction that God gives.

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:59.620
Why?

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.839
Because there's a proper way to behave in the house of God.

00:02:03.839 --> 00:02:08.580
Not everything that's called worship today in 2024 is really worship.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.860
There's a lot of things that happen today and all around this globe on a Sunday in the

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:21.740
name of quote-unquote religion that is not aligned with worship according to what God

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.419
has set forth in his word.

00:02:24.419 --> 00:02:28.360
If you go back to the Old Testament, the children of Israel could not approach God any old way

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.179
they wanted to approach God.

00:02:30.179 --> 00:02:34.380
They had to approach God on God's terms, God's way.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.380
Amen?

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.259
And so much so is the case for the local church.

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:43.779
God has instructed his church, and we know that there's proper behavior.

00:02:43.779 --> 00:02:48.860
And what a blessing it is to understand the instruction that God has given.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.979
As we come to verse number 16 of chapter number 3, the Bible says this, what a great, powerful

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:55.419
verse of Scripture.

00:02:55.419 --> 00:03:01.660
There is so much in one verse of Scripture that is before us this morning.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:11.979
The Bible says, and without controversy, great is the mystery of godliness.

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:19.899
God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:28.259
the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:30.380
Isn't that a powerful verse of Scripture?

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.259
I mean, we look at this verse of Scripture and we see all that is contained therein.

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:39.779
There are some theologians of yesteryear that have the idea, the belief that 1 Timothy 3

00:03:39.779 --> 00:03:45.979
and verse number 16 stood as maybe an anthem or a hymn for the local church, if you will,

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:51.660
and it was something that would be readily understood and they would sing it and they

00:03:51.660 --> 00:04:00.039
would rejoice in the truth that is found in this very just concise verse of Scripture.

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:03.460
But how powerful this verse of Scripture is.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:07.139
I notice that the Bible begins, without controversy.

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:09.059
I'm so thankful for settled truth.

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:10.059
Amen?

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:15.460
I'm so thankful that God said He, Jesus, He said, I am the way, the truth, and the life.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.619
No man cometh unto the Father but by me.

00:04:17.619 --> 00:04:20.619
But then He said, sanctify them by thy word.

00:04:20.619 --> 00:04:24.000
Thy word is truth.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
What a blessing to have God's word.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.739
What a blessing that God inspired His word, all Scripture is given by inspiration of God,

00:04:32.739 --> 00:04:38.980
but then to understand that God providentially preserved His word so that every generation

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.420
of believers would have the word of God.

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:43.420
What a blessing.

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:49.500
See, inspiration without preservation is, it's a great doctrinal truth, but the reality

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:54.540
is that we don't have the originals, but I don't need the originals because God promised

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:59.980
to preserve His word, and He has.

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:07.579
And His word is truth, and truth settles everything.

00:05:07.579 --> 00:05:13.179
And the verse starts, and without controversy.

00:05:13.179 --> 00:05:18.940
There was a settled truth that was understood amongst the early church, amongst the first

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:25.220
century believers, that is outlined in this verse of Scripture, really those points, if

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.940
you will, of this great mystery of godliness.

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.980
We find that it's without controversy.

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:35.660
Does it mean that there's no one that disagrees?

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.179
That's not what it means at all.

00:05:38.179 --> 00:05:42.140
There's always going to be false teachers, false prophets as there were in the Old Testament,

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:43.940
false teachers in the New Testament.

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:50.140
We find that even today, and John says this in 1 John, that the spirit of antichrist is

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:51.420
already here.

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:56.459
We understand that one day the antichrist will appear, but the spirit of antichrist

00:05:56.459 --> 00:05:57.779
is already at work.

00:05:57.779 --> 00:06:00.140
We find that there's many false teachers.

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:06.660
It doesn't mean that there's not someone that would stand in opposition to the truth.

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:11.059
It just simply means that for those of us that know the truth, there's no controversy.

00:06:11.059 --> 00:06:16.619
Isn't it awesome to be settled, knowing what you believe?

00:06:16.619 --> 00:06:21.940
I mean, just being able to have Bible verses that you can go to and say, somebody says,

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.100
hey, what do you believe about this?

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:26.859
Listen, it doesn't matter what I believe, it matters what God said.

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:33.779
I believe what God said, and that makes me a believer, a follower of truth, but the reality

00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:37.299
is that what God said settles it all.

00:06:37.299 --> 00:06:41.040
Listen, I didn't always believe like I believe today, and you probably didn't always believe

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.040
like you believe today.

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:45.260
There are probably some things that were different in your worldview, that were different in

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:46.260
your perspective.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:47.260
Why?

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:48.899
Because you were living void of this book.

00:06:48.899 --> 00:06:53.299
You didn't know the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal Savior, and then after you got saved,

00:06:53.299 --> 00:06:57.779
the Holy Spirit of God dwells within you, the Word of God becomes real to you, and

00:06:57.779 --> 00:07:05.179
you begin to study it and to know it, and the Holy Spirit of God convinces you of truth.

00:07:05.179 --> 00:07:08.100
And hallelujah, hallelujah.

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:16.459
I'm so thankful this morning, without controversy, great is the mystery of godliness.

00:07:16.459 --> 00:07:19.940
This morning we're going to look through this verse of Scripture, and I'm going to give

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:24.260
you four thoughts this morning, really, as we just step through the outline.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:29.100
Number one, if you're taking notes, the incarnation of Christ.

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.179
Number one, the incarnation of Christ.

00:07:31.179 --> 00:07:34.859
The Bible says, great is the mystery of Godliness, and without controversy, great is the mystery

00:07:34.859 --> 00:07:35.859
of godliness.

00:07:35.859 --> 00:07:41.380
Notice this, God was manifest in the flesh.

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:44.299
I dealt with this verse of Scripture in Sunday school a few weeks ago because many of the

00:07:44.299 --> 00:07:47.779
modern translations move the word God and just put He.

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:51.299
Listen, it was God who was manifest in the flesh.

00:07:51.299 --> 00:07:53.179
Jesus is 100% God.

00:07:53.179 --> 00:07:58.500
He is the God, man, and we find that it's absolutely important and it's imperative that

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:03.220
we understand, listen, these modern translations, many times, though they claim we're not changing

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:04.619
doctrine, you know what they go after?

00:08:04.619 --> 00:08:07.739
The deity of Christ in so many places.

00:08:07.739 --> 00:08:16.179
We find here that the Bible says God was manifest in the flesh, the incarnation of the Lord

00:08:16.179 --> 00:08:17.179
Jesus Christ.

00:08:17.579 --> 00:08:20.140
That's the gospel of John, if you will.

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:22.140
The gospel of John.

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:26.220
We could look at Matthew's gospel as well, really, you could look at Matthew, Luke, you

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:28.579
could look at so many places this morning.

00:08:28.579 --> 00:08:34.340
We're going to look at John chapter number one, and one of the precious portions of Scripture

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:44.059
that record for us and reveal to us the incarnation of Christ, that God was manifest in the flesh.

00:08:44.059 --> 00:08:47.659
Notice the Bible begins in John chapter one and verse number one, in the beginning was

00:08:47.659 --> 00:08:53.419
the Word, the Word was with God, the Word was God.

00:08:53.419 --> 00:08:59.260
The same was in the beginning with God, all things were made by Him, and without Him was

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.940
not anything made that was made.

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:06.900
In Him was life, the life was the light of men.

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:10.619
The light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not.

00:09:10.619 --> 00:09:13.299
It was a man sent from God, whose name was John.

00:09:13.299 --> 00:09:18.500
The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the light, that all men through him might

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:19.500
believe.

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:25.020
He was not that light, but was sent to bear witness of that light, that was the true light,

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:27.979
which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.

00:09:27.979 --> 00:09:32.460
He was in the world, and the world was made by Him, and the world knew Him not.

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:37.179
He came unto His own, and His own received Him not.

00:09:37.179 --> 00:09:43.460
Verse 12, but as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God,

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:50.219
even to them who believe on His name, which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of

00:09:50.219 --> 00:09:52.979
the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.

00:09:52.979 --> 00:10:00.059
Notice verse 14, and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory.

00:10:00.059 --> 00:10:06.819
His glory, the glory is of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.

00:10:06.819 --> 00:10:11.979
John bare witness of Him and cried, saying, This was He of whom I spake, He that cometh

00:10:11.979 --> 00:10:15.779
after me is preferred before me.

00:10:15.779 --> 00:10:16.779
Why?

00:10:16.779 --> 00:10:19.699
For He was before me.

00:10:19.699 --> 00:10:22.579
That's a great statement of Scripture.

00:10:22.579 --> 00:10:26.419
In fact, I just read a lot of great statements of Scripture.

00:10:26.419 --> 00:10:29.219
But I want you to understand, the Bible says the beginning was the Word, and the Word was

00:10:29.219 --> 00:10:34.259
made flesh and dwelt among us, if you look at verse 1 and then look at verse 14.

00:10:34.259 --> 00:10:38.999
We find that in verse number 15 that John, this is John the Baptist, he's bearing witness

00:10:38.999 --> 00:10:40.939
the forerunner of Christ.

00:10:40.939 --> 00:10:47.779
And we find that John says this, this is, this was He of whom I spake, He that cometh

00:10:47.779 --> 00:10:48.779
after me.

00:10:48.779 --> 00:10:51.419
What is he referring to when he says after me?

00:10:51.419 --> 00:10:57.699
Well chronologically, John the Baptist was older, physically speaking, than the Lord

00:10:57.699 --> 00:11:00.179
Jesus Christ, amen?

00:11:00.179 --> 00:11:05.739
And we find that he says, He that cometh after me, speaking about a chronological order,

00:11:05.739 --> 00:11:10.860
if you will, is preferred before me.

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:16.379
And then notice the statement, for He was before me.

00:11:16.379 --> 00:11:19.579
How was it that He was before him if He was born after him?

00:11:19.579 --> 00:11:22.860
Well, because He's the eternal God.

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:26.939
God was manifest in the flesh.

00:11:26.939 --> 00:11:29.579
It's an amazing truth of God's Word.

00:11:29.579 --> 00:11:32.059
It's one that must be accepted by faith.

00:11:32.059 --> 00:11:37.739
It's one by which God gives us great truth, and He provides us with various portions of

00:11:37.739 --> 00:11:45.659
Scripture to prove to us the deity, the incarnation of Christ, that He is the God-man.

00:11:45.659 --> 00:11:49.220
He's a hundred percent God, and a hundred percent man.

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:52.979
Some have referred to it as the hyperstatic union, and we understand this morning that

00:11:52.979 --> 00:11:57.939
as we look at this truth, why did God have to come in the form of a man?

00:11:57.939 --> 00:12:01.699
Well, so that He could die for the sins of humanity.

00:12:01.699 --> 00:12:06.779
It was the only way that man could be redeemed.

00:12:06.779 --> 00:12:11.059
It was predetermined before the foundation of the world, according to Ephesians 1, according

00:12:11.059 --> 00:12:20.739
to 1 Peter, that Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God, God in flesh, that He would be our substitute

00:12:20.739 --> 00:12:21.739
on that cross.

00:12:21.739 --> 00:12:25.500
And we'll get to that in just a few moments in this verse of Scripture in 1 Timothy 3

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:31.940
and verse 16, but we find that it begins with the incarnation, that God was manifest in

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:32.940
the flesh.

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:36.419
Listen, if He's not man, why is He asleep on the boat?

00:12:36.419 --> 00:12:42.459
If He's not God, how could He stand and say, peace, be still?

00:12:42.459 --> 00:12:46.539
He's the God-man, the incarnation.

00:12:46.539 --> 00:12:49.979
Philippians chapter 2 says it this way.

00:12:49.979 --> 00:12:57.979
Philippians chapter 2, where Mark was preaching from chapter 3 last Sunday evening, and what

00:12:57.979 --> 00:12:59.500
a great book this is.

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:02.739
I know that we've spoken much about this book.

00:13:02.739 --> 00:13:09.199
We find that in chapter number 2, beginning in verse number 5, the Bible says, let this

00:13:09.199 --> 00:13:14.860
mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus, who being in the form of God, thought it not

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:21.739
proper to be equal with God, but notice it says, but made Himself of no reputation, verse

00:13:21.739 --> 00:13:30.419
number 7, and took upon Him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men.

00:13:30.419 --> 00:13:34.099
You know, He left the glories of heaven.

00:13:34.099 --> 00:13:41.959
John 17 speaks about the glory that He had with the Father before, because of the eternality

00:13:41.959 --> 00:13:49.279
of Christ, but He left the glories of heaven and was robed in flesh.

00:13:49.279 --> 00:13:52.039
God was manifest in the flesh.

00:13:52.039 --> 00:13:58.319
Notice He was made in the likeness of men, verse 8, and being found in fashion as a man,

00:13:58.319 --> 00:14:05.959
He humbled Himself and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.

00:14:05.959 --> 00:14:11.119
Wherefore, verse number 9, God also hath highly exalted Him and given Him a name which is

00:14:11.119 --> 00:14:16.600
above every name, that in the name of Jesus, what a wonderful name it is, every knee should

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:20.440
bow of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth, and that every

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:29.119
tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, the glory of God the Father, hallelujah.

00:14:29.119 --> 00:14:32.919
Often I've said of that passage of Scripture, it's not a matter of if, it's a matter of

00:14:32.919 --> 00:14:34.380
when.

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:37.839
Every tongue will confess, every knee will bow.

00:14:37.839 --> 00:14:40.399
When that takes place makes all the difference.

00:14:40.399 --> 00:14:43.919
If you do it on this side of eternity, man, for all of eternity, you'll be with Jesus

00:14:43.919 --> 00:14:44.919
in heaven.

00:14:44.919 --> 00:14:45.919
You'll be with your Savior.

00:14:45.919 --> 00:14:49.079
But if you do it at the great white throne judgment, you'll be cast in the lake of fire.

00:14:49.079 --> 00:14:51.480
You will confess.

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:53.440
You'll just be in the lake of fire for all of eternity.

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:54.440
How sad.

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:55.440
You don't have to.

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:56.440
You can confess now.

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:59.919
Believe that God was manifest in the flesh for you.

00:14:59.919 --> 00:15:01.739
He is Lord.

00:15:01.739 --> 00:15:06.880
Back in 1 Timothy 3 and verse 16, number one, we see the incarnation of Christ.

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:09.600
Number two, we see the resurrection of Christ.

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:14.480
In 1 Timothy 3, 16, and without controversy, great is the mystery of godliness.

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:21.260
God was manifest in the flesh, and then notice this, justified in the spirit, seen of angels.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:24.079
This would refer to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:15:24.079 --> 00:15:27.880
In Romans chapter one, we won't take the time to read the account in Matthew.

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:30.619
Look if you will at Romans chapter number one.

00:15:30.619 --> 00:15:35.399
We can look again at all four gospel records and see the record that is provided of the

00:15:35.399 --> 00:15:37.399
resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:15:37.399 --> 00:15:40.880
I'm thankful that he died in my place.

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:45.600
I'm thankful that he was buried, but he rose, conquering sin, death, and the grave.

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:48.540
We just celebrated Easter just a few weeks ago, of course.

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:54.320
Every Sunday that we worship, that we gather, is because we serve a risen Savior.

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.339
Because we serve a risen Savior.

00:15:56.339 --> 00:16:03.859
That particular Sunday is a focused Sunday, if you will, on that wonderful reality.

00:16:03.859 --> 00:16:07.839
We find here in Romans chapter number one, in verse number four, it says, well let me

00:16:07.839 --> 00:16:12.459
back up to verse number three, concerning his son Jesus Christ, our Lord, which was

00:16:12.459 --> 00:16:14.940
made of the seed of David according to the flesh.

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:19.940
We just mentioned about the incarnation, but then notice it says in verse number four,

00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:27.540
and declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, how?

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:30.899
By the resurrection from the dead.

00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:35.700
Listen, if Jesus went through all of his earthly ministry, and he said all the things that

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:39.700
he said, and then he was crucified on that cross, and he was buried in that tomb, and

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:44.179
he stayed there, then he's a fraud.

00:16:44.179 --> 00:16:47.899
Because he said, destroy this temple, and in three days I'll rise it up.

00:16:47.899 --> 00:16:51.299
He said multiple times to his disciples, I need to go to Jerusalem, and I'm going to

00:16:51.299 --> 00:16:55.100
go there, and they're going to kill me, they're going to crucify me, but I'm going to rise

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:57.100
again.

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:58.779
He said that multiple times.

00:16:58.779 --> 00:17:05.139
That's why the angels there at the tomb, they said, he's not here, for he is risen as he

00:17:05.139 --> 00:17:14.820
said, hallelujah, and he is declared to be the Son of God with power, how?

00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:18.299
By the resurrection from the dead.

00:17:18.299 --> 00:17:20.459
He conquered sin, death, and the grave.

00:17:20.459 --> 00:17:25.700
He tore the bars away as we sing that wonderful song, and what a joy it is to know that we

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:27.579
serve a risen Savior.

00:17:27.579 --> 00:17:31.100
Notice what the Bible says in 1 Corinthians chapter 15, turn over there if you will.

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:35.380
We could take and look at the entirety of this chapter, and what a powerful chapter

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:36.380
it is.

00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:39.500
For sake of time, we're just going to read the first several verses, but in 1 Corinthians

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:46.739
15, often referred to as the resurrection chapter, what a great chapter it is.

00:17:46.739 --> 00:17:52.660
Paul says this in verse number one, moreover brethren, I declare unto you the gospel, which

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:57.540
I preached unto you, which also you have received, and wherein ye stand, by which also ye are

00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:03.579
saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.

00:18:03.579 --> 00:18:08.260
For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:13.339
for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that he was buried, and that he rose again

00:18:13.339 --> 00:18:18.899
the third day according to the Scriptures, that he was seen of Cephas, and of the twelve.

00:18:18.899 --> 00:18:23.260
After that he was seen of about five hundred brethren at once, of whom the greater part

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:26.639
remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep.

00:18:26.639 --> 00:18:30.119
After that he was seen of James, then of all the apostles, and last of all he was seen

00:18:30.119 --> 00:18:34.919
of me also, as of one born out of due time.

00:18:34.919 --> 00:18:39.640
Isn't it wonderful to think about the truth of the resurrection and to understand the

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:43.039
gospel as it's declared here in this passage?

00:18:43.039 --> 00:18:48.640
And Paul will go on to say that if Christ be not risen from the dead, then our preaching

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:56.400
is in vain, our faith is in vain, but he declares in verse number 20, but now is Christ risen

00:18:56.440 --> 00:19:01.599
from the dead and become the firstfruits of them that slept.

00:19:01.599 --> 00:19:06.400
Listen, I have the hope of the resurrection because he is the resurrection and the life.

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:10.880
He conquered sin, death, and the grave, and I have great confidence, listen, I'm hoping

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:15.279
that I live until the rapture of the church, that I hear the trumpet of the Lord, and I'll

00:19:15.279 --> 00:19:19.719
be caught up together with him in the clouds to be with him for all of eternity, but the

00:19:19.719 --> 00:19:22.840
reality is that I might not live until the rapture.

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:29.239
I hope that I do, but I know this, that if I die before the rapture, that to be absent

00:19:29.239 --> 00:19:30.960
from the body is to be present with the Lord.

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:35.039
I have confidence and hope and security that I will be with my Savior.

00:19:35.039 --> 00:19:39.840
Oh, they're going to bury my body somewhere, and then someday, the Bible says, the dead

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:42.520
in Christ shall rise first.

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:44.919
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.

00:19:44.919 --> 00:19:47.479
What a joy.

00:19:47.479 --> 00:19:50.760
Listen, I was talking to Bart at the funeral service.

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:53.239
He said, listen, I want you all to have a pizza party when I die.

00:19:53.239 --> 00:19:54.719
I want you to just rejoice.

00:19:54.719 --> 00:20:00.159
Listen, I'm telling you what, man, when I die, man, it's going to be a time of

00:20:00.159 --> 00:20:03.199
of rejoicing, why?

00:20:03.199 --> 00:20:04.599
I understand that we sorrow,

00:20:04.599 --> 00:20:08.479
we sorrow not as others which have no hope though, amen.

00:20:08.479 --> 00:20:09.639
Why, I'm gonna be with my Lord,

00:20:09.639 --> 00:20:11.599
I'm gonna be a completely whole.

00:20:11.599 --> 00:20:13.079
It's like what D.L. Moody said, he said,

00:20:13.079 --> 00:20:15.119
someday you're gonna read in the papers.

00:20:15.119 --> 00:20:16.699
Now today we don't read papers too much,

00:20:16.699 --> 00:20:17.719
some of you still get in the paper,

00:20:17.719 --> 00:20:18.799
but a lot of us don't.

00:20:18.799 --> 00:20:20.559
You're gonna read in the paper, he said,

00:20:20.559 --> 00:20:23.519
that's all they had by means of communication.

00:20:23.519 --> 00:20:26.559
He said, you're gonna read that D.L. Moody is dead.

00:20:26.559 --> 00:20:29.039
He said, don't you believe it for a second.

00:20:29.039 --> 00:20:30.359
He said, because in that moment,

00:20:30.359 --> 00:20:31.759
when you read that headline,

00:20:31.759 --> 00:20:35.519
D.L. Moody will be more alive than he's ever been.

00:20:35.519 --> 00:20:38.559
Hallelujah, what a joy.

00:20:38.559 --> 00:20:39.679
We serve our risen Savior.

00:20:39.679 --> 00:20:42.839
Notice what it says over in Revelation chapter one,

00:20:42.839 --> 00:20:44.619
Revelation chapter number one.

00:20:51.439 --> 00:20:55.319
The Bible says in verse 17, Revelation one,

00:20:55.319 --> 00:20:58.719
when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead.

00:20:59.439 --> 00:21:02.599
He laid his right hand upon me saying unto me, fear not.

00:21:02.599 --> 00:21:05.599
I am the first and the last.

00:21:06.439 --> 00:21:10.639
I am he that liveth, notice this, and was dead.

00:21:11.719 --> 00:21:16.719
Behold, I am alive forevermore, amen.

00:21:17.279 --> 00:21:20.579
And have the keys of hell and of death.

00:21:20.579 --> 00:21:22.699
See, Jesus tasted death for every man.

00:21:24.719 --> 00:21:26.339
He went to that cruel cross,

00:21:27.179 --> 00:21:32.179
but he made one sacrifice for sins forever, one sacrifice.

00:21:35.819 --> 00:21:37.739
And it was an accepted sacrifice,

00:21:37.739 --> 00:21:40.299
and it's proven through his resurrection.

00:21:41.579 --> 00:21:44.899
Without controversy, great is the mystery of godliness.

00:21:44.899 --> 00:21:48.539
God was manifest in the flesh, the incarnation.

00:21:48.539 --> 00:21:50.979
He was justified in the spirit,

00:21:50.979 --> 00:21:53.059
seen of angels, the resurrection.

00:21:53.059 --> 00:21:55.939
Number three this morning, we see not only the incarnation,

00:21:55.939 --> 00:21:58.099
the resurrection, but I want you to see number three,

00:21:58.099 --> 00:22:00.299
the proclamation of the gospel.

00:22:00.299 --> 00:22:03.299
The Bible says this in verse number 16,

00:22:03.299 --> 00:22:07.219
that he was justified in the spirit, seen of angels,

00:22:07.219 --> 00:22:12.219
and then notice this, preached unto the Gentiles.

00:22:12.339 --> 00:22:17.339
And then it says this, believed on in the world.

00:22:17.459 --> 00:22:19.299
I begin to look at this phraseology

00:22:19.299 --> 00:22:21.499
and thinking about the proclamation of the gospel,

00:22:21.499 --> 00:22:25.699
and the reality is that this truth of preaching the gospel

00:22:25.699 --> 00:22:30.579
started and it's not yet ended, amen.

00:22:30.579 --> 00:22:31.979
We're still proclaiming the gospel.

00:22:31.979 --> 00:22:33.419
That's what we're to be busy about doing

00:22:33.419 --> 00:22:36.859
is proclaiming the glorious gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:22:36.859 --> 00:22:38.899
It is the cornerstone of our faith

00:22:38.899 --> 00:22:41.179
that he rose from the dead,

00:22:41.179 --> 00:22:43.619
but we understand that Paul says in that chapter

00:22:43.619 --> 00:22:48.099
in 1 Corinthians 15, I declare unto you the gospel.

00:22:48.099 --> 00:22:49.939
The gospel is the good news.

00:22:51.219 --> 00:22:54.699
The gospel is the best news, amen.

00:22:54.699 --> 00:22:59.179
Listen, the world's full of enough bad news, amen.

00:22:59.179 --> 00:23:00.699
You don't have to go real far.

00:23:01.859 --> 00:23:04.459
In fact, you can go real far in strolling

00:23:04.459 --> 00:23:06.459
and just get bad news and bad news and bad news

00:23:06.459 --> 00:23:08.059
and bad news and bad news.

00:23:08.939 --> 00:23:11.499
But I'm gonna tell you what, we got the best news ever.

00:23:12.379 --> 00:23:14.259
The best news, the gospel.

00:23:14.259 --> 00:23:15.619
And we see that the Bible says

00:23:15.619 --> 00:23:17.459
that he was preached unto the Gentiles,

00:23:17.459 --> 00:23:19.819
he's believed on in the world.

00:23:19.819 --> 00:23:22.439
I'm thankful that the gospel is powerful.

00:23:22.439 --> 00:23:24.459
I'm thankful that people, listen,

00:23:25.219 --> 00:23:26.099
each one of us that are here this morning

00:23:26.099 --> 00:23:27.459
that are saved by the grace of God,

00:23:27.459 --> 00:23:31.219
we are evidence that the gospel was preached

00:23:31.219 --> 00:23:36.219
and believed on in the world, hallelujah.

00:23:36.739 --> 00:23:39.139
This morning, we think about the proclamation of the gospel.

00:23:39.139 --> 00:23:39.979
There are some today that say,

00:23:39.979 --> 00:23:41.099
well, it just doesn't work anymore.

00:23:41.099 --> 00:23:42.539
No, no, no, it does work.

00:23:42.539 --> 00:23:45.779
The gospel is still the power of God unto salvation

00:23:45.779 --> 00:23:47.259
to this very moment.

00:23:47.259 --> 00:23:50.819
The gospel is still the only message

00:23:50.819 --> 00:23:54.739
that we as a church are commanded to distribute,

00:23:54.739 --> 00:23:57.059
to give, and to give freely.

00:23:58.419 --> 00:24:00.259
What a joy to share the gospel.

00:24:01.539 --> 00:24:03.339
Oftentimes, when we think about the gospel,

00:24:03.339 --> 00:24:08.339
it starts in a negative type of way that we're sinners.

00:24:08.379 --> 00:24:11.219
Well, it's just a human truth.

00:24:11.219 --> 00:24:15.499
It's a condition that affects, that impacts all of humanity.

00:24:16.979 --> 00:24:18.379
And it's one of those things,

00:24:18.379 --> 00:24:21.619
oftentimes I try to share with someone like,

00:24:21.619 --> 00:24:24.859
hey, listen, we're all in the same boat together.

00:24:24.859 --> 00:24:26.059
We're all sinners.

00:24:27.259 --> 00:24:29.939
I happen to be a sinner saved by grace

00:24:29.939 --> 00:24:33.899
that now not so much referred to as a sinner, but a saint.

00:24:33.899 --> 00:24:35.499
Not because of anything special in me,

00:24:35.499 --> 00:24:39.219
but because of him, Christ in me, the hope of glory.

00:24:40.059 --> 00:24:41.059
What a joy.

00:24:42.139 --> 00:24:44.859
This morning, we see that that message

00:24:44.859 --> 00:24:48.459
that begins with the humanity,

00:24:48.459 --> 00:24:51.219
the condition of humanity being lost sinners,

00:24:51.219 --> 00:24:53.299
but it talks about the fact that,

00:24:53.299 --> 00:24:55.539
that yes, the wages of sin is death,

00:24:55.539 --> 00:24:57.619
but what a great conjunction,

00:24:57.619 --> 00:25:01.059
the gift of God is eternal life

00:25:01.059 --> 00:25:04.019
through Jesus Christ, our Lord.

00:25:04.019 --> 00:25:06.459
What a great truth.

00:25:06.459 --> 00:25:09.419
We find that the Bible tells us in Matthew chapter 28

00:25:09.419 --> 00:25:11.179
that Jesus stands there.

00:25:11.179 --> 00:25:13.779
He had told his disciples after his resurrection

00:25:13.779 --> 00:25:15.099
to meet him there.

00:25:16.219 --> 00:25:19.099
He's there in Galilee and we find that they're there

00:25:19.099 --> 00:25:24.099
and the scene is set for us in Matthew chapter 28,

00:25:24.259 --> 00:25:26.339
beginning in verse 16.

00:25:26.339 --> 00:25:28.979
It says, then the 11 disciples went away into Galilee,

00:25:28.979 --> 00:25:32.539
into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.

00:25:32.539 --> 00:25:34.499
Thank God for their obedience.

00:25:35.579 --> 00:25:38.099
And the Bible says, and when they saw him,

00:25:39.339 --> 00:25:40.819
they worshiped him.

00:25:41.779 --> 00:25:43.179
By the way, when you see Jesus,

00:25:43.539 --> 00:25:44.859
all you're gonna do is what John did over there

00:25:44.859 --> 00:25:48.219
in Revelation one, you're gonna fall at his face,

00:25:48.219 --> 00:25:49.819
at his feet.

00:25:49.819 --> 00:25:51.459
You're just gonna worship him.

00:25:51.459 --> 00:25:53.419
Notice here, the verse says in verse 17,

00:25:53.419 --> 00:25:56.619
but some doubted, but some doubted.

00:25:56.619 --> 00:25:59.459
You know, so often we can be critical of those who doubt.

00:26:01.059 --> 00:26:02.499
We can be critical.

00:26:02.499 --> 00:26:07.419
But you know, it's our responsibility

00:26:07.419 --> 00:26:10.339
to come alongside and to help them.

00:26:10.339 --> 00:26:12.019
We've been studying in 1 Thessalonians.

00:26:12.019 --> 00:26:12.939
I don't want you to turn there,

00:26:13.699 --> 00:26:16.859
but we've been studying now for weeks on Wednesday evening.

00:26:16.859 --> 00:26:19.499
The Bible tells us that not only are we to warn them

00:26:19.499 --> 00:26:23.299
that are unruly, but we're to comfort the feeble-minded,

00:26:23.299 --> 00:26:26.779
support the weak and be patient toward all men.

00:26:28.299 --> 00:26:31.019
There are some that doubt, that struggle.

00:26:31.019 --> 00:26:34.619
And here we find that they worshiped him, some doubted.

00:26:34.619 --> 00:26:39.219
We often refer to Thomas from John's gospel,

00:26:39.219 --> 00:26:41.779
doubting Thomas, unless I see.

00:26:43.259 --> 00:26:46.579
Verse 18, notice what Jesus says as they're gathered.

00:26:46.579 --> 00:26:48.379
And Jesus came and spake unto them saying,

00:26:48.379 --> 00:26:53.379
"'All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.

00:26:53.419 --> 00:26:55.259
"'Go ye therefore and teach all nations,

00:26:55.259 --> 00:26:57.739
"'baptizing them in the name of the Father

00:26:57.739 --> 00:26:58.979
"'or the Son or the Holy Ghost,

00:26:58.979 --> 00:27:00.339
"'teaching them to observe all things

00:27:00.339 --> 00:27:02.379
"'whatsoever I've commanded you.

00:27:02.379 --> 00:27:03.619
"'And lo, I am with you always,

00:27:03.619 --> 00:27:05.859
"'even unto the end of the world.

00:27:05.859 --> 00:27:06.859
"'Amen.'"

00:27:08.019 --> 00:27:10.979
We note here in the text of Scripture,

00:27:10.979 --> 00:27:13.659
Matthew chapter 28, that we're to go,

00:27:13.659 --> 00:27:16.819
the Bible says, to all nations.

00:27:16.819 --> 00:27:18.939
We find that the Bible says in Mark 16,

00:27:18.939 --> 00:27:21.699
preach the gospel to every creature.

00:27:21.699 --> 00:27:24.379
We find that the Bible tells us in Acts chapter one,

00:27:24.379 --> 00:27:26.379
that we're to go to Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria,

00:27:26.379 --> 00:27:28.659
the uttermost part of the world.

00:27:28.659 --> 00:27:31.819
We find that the gospel is for all people.

00:27:31.819 --> 00:27:35.059
What a blessing to know that God loves the world.

00:27:35.059 --> 00:27:36.979
He loves all people.

00:27:36.979 --> 00:27:38.979
We find that as we look specifically

00:27:38.979 --> 00:27:39.979
at the text of Scripture,

00:27:39.979 --> 00:27:42.939
the Bible says he's preached unto the Gentiles.

00:27:42.939 --> 00:27:45.059
You understand that he came into his own,

00:27:45.059 --> 00:27:47.059
we read John chapter number one,

00:27:47.059 --> 00:27:49.979
and his own received him not.

00:27:49.979 --> 00:27:50.859
John chapter number one,

00:27:50.859 --> 00:27:54.979
that's referring to the children of Israel, the Israelites.

00:27:54.979 --> 00:27:58.059
And we find that even in John chapter number one,

00:27:58.059 --> 00:28:01.099
we read of that in John chapter number 10,

00:28:01.099 --> 00:28:03.499
when Jesus is speaking about being the good shepherd,

00:28:03.499 --> 00:28:05.899
he speaks of a group of sheep,

00:28:05.899 --> 00:28:08.159
and then he talks about another group.

00:28:08.159 --> 00:28:10.519
The second group that he talks about is the Gentiles,

00:28:10.519 --> 00:28:12.119
what he's talking about.

00:28:12.119 --> 00:28:13.519
And we find here this morning,

00:28:13.519 --> 00:28:15.719
that as the Bible reveals to us

00:28:15.719 --> 00:28:17.479
that he's preached unto the Gentiles,

00:28:17.479 --> 00:28:19.399
understand with me this morning,

00:28:19.399 --> 00:28:21.999
that he came to his own and his own received him not.

00:28:21.999 --> 00:28:25.119
No, it was they that stood and said, crucify him.

00:28:25.119 --> 00:28:28.199
We have no other king, crucify him.

00:28:30.199 --> 00:28:32.599
He came unto his own, his own received him not.

00:28:33.599 --> 00:28:35.479
The Bible teaches us in the book of Romans,

00:28:35.479 --> 00:28:38.000
I don't have time to develop the entirety of the theology

00:28:38.839 --> 00:28:40.359
this morning, but the Bible teaches about the Gentiles

00:28:40.359 --> 00:28:45.359
being graft in, the wild branch being graft in.

00:28:46.399 --> 00:28:49.719
What a joy that the gospel then came to the Gentiles.

00:28:49.719 --> 00:28:52.559
By the way, it was always God's plan in the Old Testament,

00:28:52.559 --> 00:28:54.079
the children of Israel had a responsibility

00:28:54.079 --> 00:28:56.799
to make God known to all the world.

00:28:56.799 --> 00:28:58.539
They failed miserably,

00:28:58.539 --> 00:29:01.239
just as the church has failed miserably.

00:29:01.239 --> 00:29:02.879
But the reality this morning

00:29:02.879 --> 00:29:04.639
is that he's preached unto the Gentiles.

00:29:04.639 --> 00:29:07.699
Does it mean that the gospel doesn't work for the Jews?

00:29:08.399 --> 00:29:09.219
No, the Bible says for the gospel

00:29:09.219 --> 00:29:10.579
is the power of God unto salvation

00:29:10.579 --> 00:29:12.399
to everyone that believeth,

00:29:12.399 --> 00:29:14.219
to the Jew first and also to the Greek,

00:29:14.219 --> 00:29:15.659
Romans one and verse 16.

00:29:15.659 --> 00:29:18.259
And we find this morning that the Bible tells us

00:29:18.259 --> 00:29:22.659
that blindness has happened in part to the Jews, to Israel.

00:29:22.659 --> 00:29:24.019
And we see that.

00:29:25.539 --> 00:29:27.619
We see that Israel has rejected Messiah.

00:29:27.619 --> 00:29:31.239
In fact, today, Israel is looking for Messiah.

00:29:31.239 --> 00:29:34.139
They reject Jesus Christ as being Messiah.

00:29:34.139 --> 00:29:35.539
And as a whole,

00:29:35.539 --> 00:29:38.779
speaking with a very broad paintbrush this morning,

00:29:38.779 --> 00:29:42.679
Israel today is looking for their Messiah.

00:29:42.679 --> 00:29:45.259
In fact, you can read of various things

00:29:45.259 --> 00:29:46.699
that are taking place in Israel

00:29:46.699 --> 00:29:48.940
just within the last couple of weeks.

00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:50.859
The Levites, they were singing, right?

00:29:50.859 --> 00:29:54.579
They were getting ready for singing in the temple.

00:29:54.579 --> 00:29:56.219
It was just a couple of weeks ago,

00:29:56.219 --> 00:29:58.059
that was in the news and it's happening.

00:29:58.059 --> 00:30:00.019
And you understand about all of the

00:30:00.019 --> 00:30:02.859
pieces of furniture and all the things that they're doing.

00:30:02.859 --> 00:30:04.579
Why, they're looking for their Messiah.

00:30:04.579 --> 00:30:08.179
Their Messiah came, but they rejected him.

00:30:09.699 --> 00:30:14.579
We find that today the gospel is effective for all people,

00:30:14.579 --> 00:30:16.539
Jew or Gentile.

00:30:16.539 --> 00:30:18.779
But we see specifically that it says preached

00:30:18.779 --> 00:30:22.219
unto the Gentiles because we see this mystery of the church

00:30:22.219 --> 00:30:25.459
where Paul is giving the instruction of the church here

00:30:25.459 --> 00:30:28.339
in 1 Timothy 2 and 3 that thou mayest know

00:30:28.339 --> 00:30:30.259
how thou oughtest to behave thyself.

00:30:30.259 --> 00:30:32.339
We've dealt with that the last couple of weeks,

00:30:32.339 --> 00:30:34.859
but we find that he gives in the book of Ephesians

00:30:34.859 --> 00:30:37.579
beautifully this mystery of the church,

00:30:37.579 --> 00:30:40.179
how the church would be this entity,

00:30:40.179 --> 00:30:42.819
that this organism that is made up,

00:30:42.819 --> 00:30:45.459
it's a living organism, it's a living body

00:30:45.459 --> 00:30:48.579
that's made up of Jews and Gentiles.

00:30:48.579 --> 00:30:52.059
We are in Christ, hallelujah.

00:30:52.059 --> 00:30:55.139
It's wonderful to understand that.

00:30:56.099 --> 00:30:58.419
This morning, we need to be busy about preaching

00:30:58.419 --> 00:31:00.899
the gospel to every creature.

00:31:00.899 --> 00:31:02.979
In Acts chapter number eight and verse number four,

00:31:02.979 --> 00:31:04.339
I won't take the time to turn there,

00:31:04.339 --> 00:31:09.339
but the intensity of the persecution reaches a high level.

00:31:10.019 --> 00:31:12.659
We find that Stephen had been martyred.

00:31:12.659 --> 00:31:15.019
They'd already gone through the process of imprisoning

00:31:15.019 --> 00:31:17.099
and threatening and all those types of things.

00:31:17.099 --> 00:31:19.819
And the enemy has attacked from without,

00:31:19.819 --> 00:31:22.379
the enemy has attacked from within.

00:31:22.379 --> 00:31:26.059
Stephen is stoned in chapter number seven.

00:31:26.059 --> 00:31:27.939
And we find that we come to chapter number eight

00:31:27.939 --> 00:31:31.019
and that persecution is just intensifying

00:31:31.019 --> 00:31:32.779
so much so that the Bible says

00:31:32.779 --> 00:31:35.659
that the believers in Jerusalem were scattered.

00:31:36.979 --> 00:31:38.739
Now, through that scattering,

00:31:38.739 --> 00:31:41.379
the Bible tells us in Acts eight and verse number four,

00:31:41.379 --> 00:31:43.019
that they that were scattered abroad

00:31:43.019 --> 00:31:47.419
went everywhere preaching the word.

00:31:48.739 --> 00:31:51.739
That's what they were commanded to do in Acts chapter number one.

00:31:52.539 --> 00:31:55.419
Was to go everywhere and preach the gospel.

00:31:55.419 --> 00:31:58.379
Thomas, excuse me, Philip is found preaching

00:31:58.379 --> 00:32:01.219
in various places, he ends up in Samaria,

00:32:01.219 --> 00:32:02.979
he ends up at the Ethiopian eunuch

00:32:02.979 --> 00:32:04.579
and you see all that's taking place.

00:32:04.579 --> 00:32:09.019
And you find that the gospel is going forth.

00:32:09.019 --> 00:32:10.939
So much so that as you continue to read

00:32:10.939 --> 00:32:13.659
through the book of Acts, the Bible says of those

00:32:13.659 --> 00:32:17.819
that would be in opposition to the church of God,

00:32:17.819 --> 00:32:21.859
that they say these that have turned the world upside down

00:32:21.859 --> 00:32:23.579
have come hither also.

00:32:25.139 --> 00:32:27.379
Man, they did what they were commanded to do.

00:32:28.899 --> 00:32:31.379
Notice what the Bible says in Revelation five.

00:32:32.739 --> 00:32:36.139
Revelation five is a beautiful scene

00:32:38.419 --> 00:32:42.659
where God just for a moment opens up the curtains of heaven

00:32:42.659 --> 00:32:46.099
if you will, and allows John to see this vision

00:32:46.099 --> 00:32:49.699
and allows commands really instructs John to write this

00:32:49.739 --> 00:32:52.419
and has preserved it for us.

00:32:52.419 --> 00:32:56.299
When I read that truth in 1st Timothy 3.16

00:32:56.299 --> 00:32:59.259
of the proclamation of the gospel that Jesus,

00:32:59.259 --> 00:33:01.859
the one who is God, the incarnation,

00:33:01.859 --> 00:33:04.179
the one who died, who rose conquering sin,

00:33:04.179 --> 00:33:06.379
death and the grave, that he has preached

00:33:06.379 --> 00:33:11.339
unto the Gentiles, that he has believed on in the world.

00:33:11.339 --> 00:33:13.659
And you come to Revelation chapter number five

00:33:13.659 --> 00:33:16.859
and the Bible says in verse number nine,

00:33:16.859 --> 00:33:19.579
notice and they sung a new song

00:33:21.659 --> 00:33:25.059
saying thou art worthy to take the book,

00:33:25.059 --> 00:33:29.739
to open the seals thereof, notice for thou was slain

00:33:29.739 --> 00:33:34.739
and has redeemed us to God by thy blood.

00:33:34.979 --> 00:33:38.739
And then notice this phrase, out of every kindred

00:33:38.739 --> 00:33:43.019
and tongue and people and nation

00:33:43.019 --> 00:33:48.019
and has made us unto our God, kings and priests

00:33:50.099 --> 00:33:53.739
and we shall reign on the earth.

00:33:53.739 --> 00:33:55.419
That's really looking forward to the millennial reign

00:33:55.419 --> 00:33:58.199
of Christ in verse number 10.

00:33:58.199 --> 00:34:01.619
But in verse nine, did you notice when we read this truth

00:34:01.619 --> 00:34:04.219
of the proclamation of the gospel that he was preached

00:34:04.219 --> 00:34:07.499
unto the Gentiles that he was believed on in the world

00:34:07.499 --> 00:34:09.779
that there in verse number nine, the Bible says

00:34:10.059 --> 00:34:13.459
that thou was slain and has redeemed us to God

00:34:13.459 --> 00:34:17.699
by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue

00:34:17.699 --> 00:34:20.579
and people and nation.

00:34:20.579 --> 00:34:23.139
Heaven's gonna be a wonderful place.

00:34:23.139 --> 00:34:25.579
First and foremost, because Jesus is gonna be there,

00:34:25.579 --> 00:34:26.739
our savior is gonna be there,

00:34:26.739 --> 00:34:28.639
we're gonna be in his presence.

00:34:28.639 --> 00:34:31.419
But can you imagine the throng of people

00:34:31.419 --> 00:34:33.779
around the throne room of God?

00:34:33.779 --> 00:34:38.019
From every, the Bible says tongue and kindred

00:34:38.019 --> 00:34:40.499
and tongue and people and nation.

00:34:40.499 --> 00:34:42.879
Hallelujah, hallelujah.

00:34:44.179 --> 00:34:46.879
We find this morning that it's this gospel message

00:34:46.879 --> 00:34:50.479
that is still to be proclaimed.

00:34:52.099 --> 00:34:56.459
His last command is our first priority.

00:34:58.099 --> 00:35:01.939
You know, as we preach the gospel, we're obeying Christ.

00:35:01.939 --> 00:35:03.419
We're sowing the seed of the gospel

00:35:03.419 --> 00:35:05.259
as we're commanded to do so.

00:35:05.259 --> 00:35:07.599
And we're honoring the Lord.

00:35:07.599 --> 00:35:09.239
We're bringing glory to God.

00:35:10.459 --> 00:35:11.939
It's God who gives the increase.

00:35:11.939 --> 00:35:15.199
The Bible says that some plant, some water,

00:35:15.199 --> 00:35:16.439
but God gives the increase.

00:35:16.439 --> 00:35:19.079
In fact, as Paul is sharing that very truth

00:35:19.079 --> 00:35:22.599
with the believers in Corinth, he's saying this, who am I?

00:35:23.639 --> 00:35:26.039
Some of you are saying I'm of Paul, I'm of Cephas

00:35:26.039 --> 00:35:27.399
and so on and so forth.

00:35:27.399 --> 00:35:29.639
And there's this division, but who am I?

00:35:29.639 --> 00:35:34.039
All we are are co-laborers, co-workers with Christ.

00:35:34.879 --> 00:35:39.879
And some of us sow the seed and some of us get to water,

00:35:39.959 --> 00:35:42.559
but it's God who gives the increase.

00:35:42.559 --> 00:35:45.359
And it may be that God would allow you to speak to someone

00:35:45.359 --> 00:35:46.799
and share the gospel with them

00:35:46.799 --> 00:35:49.319
and they may bow their head and trust Christ

00:35:49.319 --> 00:35:50.159
as their savior.

00:35:50.159 --> 00:35:53.239
And what glorious, glorious truth that is.

00:35:53.239 --> 00:35:55.439
The Bible says that he was preached

00:35:55.439 --> 00:35:58.959
under the Gentiles, believed on in the world.

00:35:58.959 --> 00:36:00.999
It's a wonderful thing if you've ever had the opportunity

00:36:00.999 --> 00:36:01.999
to share the gospel with someone

00:36:01.999 --> 00:36:04.279
and see them bow their head and trust Christ.

00:36:04.279 --> 00:36:06.079
It's a wonderful, glorious thing.

00:36:06.079 --> 00:36:08.239
Apart from your own personal salvation,

00:36:08.239 --> 00:36:10.999
it's probably the highest spiritual excitement

00:36:10.999 --> 00:36:12.239
that you'll ever enjoy.

00:36:13.559 --> 00:36:15.799
When somebody else bows their head

00:36:15.799 --> 00:36:18.039
and asks Christ to save them.

00:36:18.039 --> 00:36:22.279
And in a moment, they were dead,

00:36:22.279 --> 00:36:25.199
but they've been made alive, quickened.

00:36:25.199 --> 00:36:28.199
It's amazing, it's an amazing truth.

00:36:28.199 --> 00:36:30.999
The proclamation of the gospel, the gospel still works.

00:36:31.999 --> 00:36:33.879
The gospel still works.

00:36:33.879 --> 00:36:36.879
There are some today that are trying to water it down.

00:36:36.879 --> 00:36:38.239
There are some today that are trying to come

00:36:38.239 --> 00:36:42.239
with a new message, trying to be more inclusive

00:36:42.239 --> 00:36:44.839
and what have you, whatever terms you wanna use.

00:36:44.839 --> 00:36:47.639
Understand this morning, the gospel still works.

00:36:48.639 --> 00:36:53.639
And it is only the gospel that works to transform a life

00:36:54.999 --> 00:36:59.479
that someone could pass from death unto life.

00:36:59.479 --> 00:37:02.199
It's only through the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:37:02.199 --> 00:37:03.719
Number four, if you're taking notes back

00:37:03.719 --> 00:37:05.599
in 1 Timothy 3 and verse 16,

00:37:05.599 --> 00:37:08.359
the Bible says, and without controversy,

00:37:08.359 --> 00:37:10.479
great is the mystery of godliness.

00:37:10.479 --> 00:37:14.119
God was manifest in the flesh, his incarnation,

00:37:14.119 --> 00:37:17.479
justified in the spirit, seen of angels, his resurrection,

00:37:17.479 --> 00:37:20.239
preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world,

00:37:20.239 --> 00:37:22.639
the proclamation of the gospel.

00:37:22.639 --> 00:37:27.639
And then it ends with this, received up into glory.

00:37:27.839 --> 00:37:31.199
Number four this morning, I see the ascension of Christ,

00:37:31.199 --> 00:37:32.199
the ascension of Christ.

00:37:32.199 --> 00:37:34.759
Turn over to Acts chapter number one, if you will.

00:37:36.119 --> 00:37:40.559
Be honest with you, Acts chapter one is the first 11 verses

00:37:40.559 --> 00:37:44.119
of this passage are just precious verses.

00:37:44.119 --> 00:37:48.239
I love going and reading these verses and putting my mind,

00:37:48.239 --> 00:37:50.839
if you will, in that sanctified imagination

00:37:50.839 --> 00:37:52.839
of being in the presence of Jesus

00:37:52.839 --> 00:37:54.719
after he'd risen from the dead,

00:37:54.719 --> 00:37:58.519
after he'd walked on this earth and had given instruction.

00:37:58.519 --> 00:38:02.159
And now it comes to this ascension.

00:38:02.159 --> 00:38:05.679
The scene in Acts chapter number one is just magnificent.

00:38:06.519 --> 00:38:09.279
We find that the Bible says in verse number six,

00:38:09.279 --> 00:38:12.399
when they therefore were come together,

00:38:12.399 --> 00:38:15.479
they asked of him saying, Lord,

00:38:15.479 --> 00:38:20.399
wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?

00:38:20.399 --> 00:38:22.159
Isn't it funny how people are still asking

00:38:22.159 --> 00:38:24.599
the same question all these years later?

00:38:25.439 --> 00:38:26.759
They forgot to read the next verse

00:38:26.759 --> 00:38:28.719
because Jesus gave an answer.

00:38:28.719 --> 00:38:30.479
People still asking the same question

00:38:30.479 --> 00:38:32.599
that Jesus already answered.

00:38:32.599 --> 00:38:37.199
Here's what Jesus said, it is not for you to know

00:38:37.199 --> 00:38:39.199
the times or the seasons which the father

00:38:39.199 --> 00:38:40.199
hath put in his own power.

00:38:40.199 --> 00:38:41.879
You know why I keep asking the same question

00:38:41.879 --> 00:38:43.159
that we already have an answer to?

00:38:43.159 --> 00:38:44.639
Because we want to know.

00:38:46.199 --> 00:38:47.839
And we're not real good at taking a,

00:38:47.839 --> 00:38:49.879
it's not for you to know.

00:38:49.879 --> 00:38:51.199
Don't you know who I am?

00:38:52.079 --> 00:38:54.559
God said, it's not for you to know.

00:38:55.519 --> 00:38:56.839
And so guess what?

00:38:56.839 --> 00:38:59.759
He's revealed to us what he wants us to know

00:38:59.759 --> 00:39:01.439
and what he wants us to do.

00:39:01.439 --> 00:39:02.999
That we don't need to be so concerned

00:39:02.999 --> 00:39:04.959
and so focused on what he's already told us,

00:39:04.959 --> 00:39:06.319
it's not for you to know.

00:39:08.799 --> 00:39:11.759
Verse eight, but ye shall receive power.

00:39:11.759 --> 00:39:14.639
After that the Holy Ghost has come upon you

00:39:14.639 --> 00:39:17.639
and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem

00:39:17.639 --> 00:39:19.639
and all Judean and Sumerian

00:39:19.639 --> 00:39:23.639
unto the uttermost part of the earth.

00:39:23.639 --> 00:39:25.879
And when he had spoken these things,

00:39:25.879 --> 00:39:28.519
can you imagine being there?

00:39:29.439 --> 00:39:32.479
They ask a question and Jesus gives them an answer

00:39:32.479 --> 00:39:34.599
and then he gives them the gospel,

00:39:34.599 --> 00:39:36.319
or excuse me, the great commission again

00:39:36.319 --> 00:39:37.559
in verse number eight.

00:39:37.559 --> 00:39:39.239
And then as he spoke these things,

00:39:39.239 --> 00:39:42.559
the Bible says, while they beheld,

00:39:42.559 --> 00:39:47.559
he was taken up and a cloud received him

00:39:48.799 --> 00:39:52.919
out of their sight.

00:39:53.039 --> 00:39:55.319
And I know for most of us here this morning,

00:39:55.319 --> 00:39:58.039
you've read this, you know about this.

00:39:58.039 --> 00:40:00.479
Yep, it's the ascension and just keep on moving.

00:40:00.479 --> 00:40:05.639
But I hope this morning you could look at this as if you were a disciple that day and it's the first time you ever read

00:40:05.639 --> 00:40:06.879
this I

00:40:06.879 --> 00:40:10.559
Remember, listen, I remember the first time I ever read some things in the Bible. I

00:40:11.319 --> 00:40:14.959
Don't know how many times I've read the Bible through at this point in my life

00:40:15.079 --> 00:40:20.119
But I remember the first time I ever read some of the amazing things in God's Word

00:40:20.119 --> 00:40:26.279
I remember being in Bible college and sitting there in my class and hearing the professor and I'm like I have never heard this before

00:40:26.519 --> 00:40:33.959
This is absolutely amazing and I'm looking at some other students. I'm saying did you did you did you they're like you didn't know

00:40:34.479 --> 00:40:36.479
No, man, I had no idea

00:40:36.759 --> 00:40:38.759
This is awesome

00:40:39.959 --> 00:40:41.959
But unfortunately

00:40:41.999 --> 00:40:44.359
There were some that had kind of gotten over it

00:40:45.519 --> 00:40:50.719
Listen, if we're not careful as Christians we can get over it. Oh, yeah. I know that I've heard that

00:40:51.119 --> 00:40:53.119
Jesus

00:40:53.359 --> 00:41:00.319
Is speaking to them and while he's speaking to them he starts ascending out of their sight

00:41:02.319 --> 00:41:04.319
The Bible says that a cloud

00:41:04.999 --> 00:41:10.719
Received him out of their sight. Can you imagine you've never seen anything like this before?

00:41:12.239 --> 00:41:14.559
Hello, I've never seen anything like this before

00:41:15.519 --> 00:41:22.559
In my sanctified imagination I have I've stood with the disciples here in Acts chapter 1 and I've tried to picture myself being there

00:41:23.279 --> 00:41:29.279
And the Bible says that in verse number 10 while they look steadfastly toward heaven. Yep. That's what I would have been doing, too

00:41:30.719 --> 00:41:32.719
Such an amazing

00:41:33.399 --> 00:41:35.399
spectacular

00:41:35.439 --> 00:41:39.239
Event that is recorded and they're standing gazing up into heaven. I

00:41:39.239 --> 00:41:45.559
Mean, I don't know the Bible doesn't tell us of any conversation. Perhaps it's just silent

00:41:46.199 --> 00:41:48.799
as they behold him going up into heaven

00:41:49.679 --> 00:41:56.079
the Bible says that as they stood there looking steadfastly notice it says

00:41:56.599 --> 00:41:59.119
Behold two men stood by them in white apparel

00:41:59.759 --> 00:42:04.879
And notice the message it says which also said ye men of Galilee

00:42:04.879 --> 00:42:06.879
Ye men of Galilee

00:42:07.439 --> 00:42:10.439
Why stand ye gazing up into heaven? Well

00:42:11.519 --> 00:42:15.159
Seriously, because Jesus he was just talking to us

00:42:16.159 --> 00:42:23.039
And he is saying you're asking me why I'm looking up into heaven. This is amazing. This is spectacular

00:42:26.799 --> 00:42:29.959
This same Jesus

00:42:30.239 --> 00:42:32.239
Which

00:42:32.479 --> 00:42:34.799
Has taken up from you into heaven

00:42:35.599 --> 00:42:36.999
notice this

00:42:36.999 --> 00:42:40.639
shall so come in like manner as

00:42:41.159 --> 00:42:43.159
You have seen him go

00:42:43.639 --> 00:42:45.399
into heaven

00:42:45.399 --> 00:42:47.079
Wow

00:42:47.079 --> 00:42:50.279
What a message from these two men in white apparel. I believe angels

00:42:50.679 --> 00:42:55.519
What a message from these men that stood there and said to these disciples

00:42:56.479 --> 00:42:59.479
Hey, what are you doing? Why stand you gazing up into heaven?

00:43:00.079 --> 00:43:02.079
And then they give this great truth

00:43:02.079 --> 00:43:07.759
See, I think that there's several things that we can note in this passage of Scripture number one

00:43:08.999 --> 00:43:10.999
Jesus had given them instruction

00:43:11.479 --> 00:43:14.999
What was the instruction to go and preach the gospel to every creature?

00:43:15.999 --> 00:43:19.439
That there to be but you shall receive power after that

00:43:19.439 --> 00:43:22.919
The Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be witnesses in me both in Jerusalem and all

00:43:23.199 --> 00:43:25.399
Judaean and Samaritan to the uttermost part of the earth

00:43:26.079 --> 00:43:32.879
He gave them that final instruction and then he departs out of their sight and the angels they these two men they say

00:43:33.039 --> 00:43:36.759
Why are you standing gazing up into heaven? You have your marching orders?

00:43:38.559 --> 00:43:45.679
Almost as if to say get to it. Listen, we have our marching orders. They'd be busy about proclaiming the gospel of Jesus Christ

00:43:46.799 --> 00:43:48.799
But then he says this same Jesus

00:43:49.799 --> 00:43:57.879
Hallelujah for the the truth of the Ascension it's interesting to me that first Timothy 3 16 ends with the Ascension of Jesus Christ

00:43:58.679 --> 00:44:01.359
But of course this morning and I believe

00:44:01.799 --> 00:44:08.679
Even for Timothy and for Paul and for those that would read this letter throughout the centuries that the Ascension of Jesus Christ

00:44:09.279 --> 00:44:10.799
reminds us of

00:44:10.799 --> 00:44:16.319
His return the very truth that he ascended and they watched him leave the earth

00:44:16.439 --> 00:44:22.399
The Bible says that they were told this same Jesus which has taken up from you into heaven shall

00:44:22.599 --> 00:44:26.479
So come in like manner as you have seen him going to heaven

00:44:27.199 --> 00:44:29.199
Didn't tell him when he was gonna come

00:44:29.559 --> 00:44:31.079
He just said he was gonna come

00:44:31.079 --> 00:44:35.719
Remember Jesus said let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me and my father's house are many mansions

00:44:35.999 --> 00:44:40.039
If it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you

00:44:40.199 --> 00:44:42.719
And then he says this if I go and prepare a place for you

00:44:42.799 --> 00:44:44.799
I will come again and

00:44:44.919 --> 00:44:46.919
Receive you into myself that where I am

00:44:47.159 --> 00:44:53.759
There ye may be also in John 14 verses 1 through 3 what a great truth of God's Word

00:44:53.999 --> 00:44:59.479
Jesus said I will come again these angels these men these messengers

00:44:59.479 --> 00:45:06.819
They say this same Jesus you've watched him you've beheld as he disappeared out of your sight. He's coming again

00:45:08.559 --> 00:45:10.559
Hallelujah, I don't know when he's coming

00:45:12.919 --> 00:45:14.839
The scoffers

00:45:14.839 --> 00:45:16.839
according to 2nd Peter chapter 3

00:45:17.159 --> 00:45:19.159
By the way, there's a lot of scoffers

00:45:19.759 --> 00:45:26.119
They say where is the promise of his coming? Where's the promise of his turn? I mean everything just continues as it always has been

00:45:27.399 --> 00:45:34.079
You know, what's interesting about the text of Scripture in 2nd Timothy or 2nd Peter chapter 3 it says of this they are willingly

00:45:35.239 --> 00:45:36.599
ignorant

00:45:36.599 --> 00:45:39.359
It's not that God hasn't given the truth. They just don't want the truth

00:45:40.559 --> 00:45:42.559
They'd rather be in darkness

00:45:42.839 --> 00:45:44.839
to be in ignorance

00:45:44.919 --> 00:45:47.919
This they're willingly ignorant. I remember a preacher said this

00:45:49.199 --> 00:45:55.519
It disturbs me greatly when someone does not know truth and I desire greatly for them to know truth

00:45:56.199 --> 00:45:58.759
But what disturbs me even greater than that is

00:45:59.519 --> 00:46:01.919
When I meet someone who does not want to know the truth

00:46:03.359 --> 00:46:05.439
Wow, what a powerful statement

00:46:06.239 --> 00:46:09.559
There are people that just want to be ignorant. They just they're willingly ignorant

00:46:09.559 --> 00:46:14.759
They don't want to know but here's the wonderful truth the response in 2nd Peter chapter number 3

00:46:15.879 --> 00:46:18.199
The Lord is not slack

00:46:18.799 --> 00:46:21.799
Concerning his promise as some men count slackness

00:46:22.319 --> 00:46:26.719
But as long suffering to us word not willing that any should perish

00:46:27.239 --> 00:46:34.599
But that all should come to repentance. I don't know when Jesus is coming back. I know

00:46:35.839 --> 00:46:38.579
That as we look at this portion of Scripture this morning

00:46:38.579 --> 00:46:39.579
I

00:46:39.579 --> 00:46:41.579
Know the incarnation. I

00:46:41.859 --> 00:46:49.219
Know the resurrection. I know that his gospel has been proclaimed and I know he ascended to heaven and

00:46:49.979 --> 00:46:52.699
I know he's coming back. I just don't know the hour

00:46:53.419 --> 00:46:58.059
And neither do you I know we can say often I think it's getting close

00:46:58.619 --> 00:47:00.899
We can look at various things. I don't know

00:47:01.979 --> 00:47:06.859
But the wonderful thing about this promise is that it should motivate us to live godly

00:47:07.859 --> 00:47:13.619
The Bible says in 1st John if you look at chapters 2 and 3 the end of chapter 2 the beginning of chapter number 3

00:47:13.619 --> 00:47:17.579
The Bible says that we could be ashamed of him at his appearing. I

00:47:18.619 --> 00:47:21.339
Don't want to be ashamed of Christ at his appearing

00:47:22.619 --> 00:47:27.459
Who will be ashamed of him at his appearing? Well those that aren't doing what they're supposed to do

00:47:28.979 --> 00:47:35.419
Have a picture in your mind of the little boy with his hand in the cookie jar when mom comes around the corner

00:47:36.379 --> 00:47:43.099
He's caught he's ashamed typically he's happy to see mama, but not on that occasion

00:47:44.859 --> 00:47:46.859
Amen I

00:47:47.099 --> 00:47:53.979
Don't want to be ashamed of Christ at his appearing it goes on to say in the third chapter that every man that hath this hope

00:47:54.619 --> 00:47:56.619
See because we shall be like him

00:47:57.139 --> 00:48:05.059
We see him we shall be like him every man that hath this hope was he do he purifies himself even as he is pure

00:48:06.019 --> 00:48:08.019
We need to be about the father's business

00:48:08.539 --> 00:48:14.299
We look at this verse of Scripture. What a powerful verse 1st, Timothy 316. I mean a

00:48:15.499 --> 00:48:19.659
single verse of Scripture that that just captures so much

00:48:20.739 --> 00:48:23.859
no wonder there are theologians that would

00:48:25.779 --> 00:48:31.259
Believe and they would suggest that this verse of Scripture would serve as a

00:48:31.939 --> 00:48:34.839
Hymn or an anthem perhaps it did. I don't know

00:48:35.979 --> 00:48:40.659
But one thing I know is that the truth of this verse of Scripture is

00:48:41.459 --> 00:48:45.699
Comforting it's encouraging and it's motivating

00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:47.899
this morning

00:48:47.899 --> 00:48:49.179
without

00:48:49.179 --> 00:48:51.179
Controversy listen, it's settled truth

00:48:52.219 --> 00:48:53.779
settled truth

00:48:53.779 --> 00:48:58.299
God was great as the mystery of Godliness. God was manifest in the flesh

00:48:58.940 --> 00:49:03.979
Aren't you so thankful that God left the throne room of heaven came to the sin-cursed world?

00:49:04.579 --> 00:49:07.299
So that he could take your place in my place on a cruel cross

00:49:08.099 --> 00:49:09.979
He wasn't just

00:49:09.979 --> 00:49:15.419
Manifest in the flesh, but he was justified in the spirit scene of angels. He rose conquering sin death in the grave

00:49:15.419 --> 00:49:17.419
He is alive forevermore

00:49:18.579 --> 00:49:20.579
preached unto the Gentiles

00:49:20.940 --> 00:49:27.659
Believed on in the world. I'm evidence your evidence this morning that the gospel works

00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:31.079
the gospel works and then it says

00:49:31.820 --> 00:49:33.500
received up

00:49:33.500 --> 00:49:34.859
into glory

00:49:34.859 --> 00:49:38.299
That's where he is right now. You see at the right-hand throne of the Father

00:49:38.899 --> 00:49:43.679
The Bible tells us that he ever liveth to make intercession for us in Hebrews chapter 7

00:49:46.820 --> 00:49:49.299
At just the right time

00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:52.380
God's time

00:49:52.419 --> 00:49:58.739
the next event on the prophetic the prophetic calendar is for Jesus to come back and

00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:01.940
we'll

00:50:01.940 --> 00:50:06.900
hear that? I mean, it's going to be in a moment in the twinkling of an eye, but the Bible

00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:13.700
says that the voice of the archangel, right, the trump of God, you read in Revelation 4,

00:50:13.700 --> 00:50:21.580
come up hither. What a joy. Listen, we serve a great God this morning. We ought to rejoice

00:50:21.580 --> 00:50:28.460
in knowing the truth, but we ought to be motivated to proclaim the truth because there's a lost

00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:32.860
and dying world. There are people that we come in contact with every day of our lives

00:50:32.860 --> 00:50:38.620
that they don't know the truth that we've just looked at this morning. They can't rejoice

00:50:38.620 --> 00:50:44.300
in the same way in which we rejoice this morning. They don't have the assurance that we have

00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:52.060
this morning. So it's our duty, it's our responsibility to lead them to Christ, to take for them,

00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:57.940
to them, excuse me, the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. And we leave it in God's hands.

00:50:57.940 --> 00:51:04.180
Some plant, some water, God gives the increase. Let's pray together. Father, we love you.

00:51:04.180 --> 00:51:08.160
We thank you so much for loving us. We thank you for the privilege of being able to gather

00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:17.459
together this morning. We thank you for this verse of Scripture. I think about this single

00:51:17.459 --> 00:51:36.139
statement, that's my God. That's my God. You came. You died. You rose. You instructed.

00:51:36.139 --> 00:51:43.459
You ascended. One day you're coming back. You intercede for us now. You're our advocate,

00:51:44.459 --> 00:51:50.260
our intercessor. What a joy. God, if there's one here this morning that's not sure of heaven,

00:51:50.260 --> 00:51:54.220
they've never trusted Christ as their Savior, I pray that today would be the day of their

00:51:54.220 --> 00:52:00.980
salvation. Lord, they'd trust Christ alone for their soul's salvation. I pray for every

00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:05.340
child of God, Lord, would this verse of Scripture not only encourage us, but would it motivate

00:52:05.340 --> 00:52:11.180
us to get busy about the work that you've called us to do? I pray that in these moments

00:52:11.180 --> 00:52:14.699
of invitation that you'd have your will and way, that you'd move and work in hearts and

00:52:14.699 --> 00:52:19.300
lives as only you can. We'll give you the honor and glory for all that you'll do. For

00:52:19.300 --> 00:52:20.900
it's in Christ's name we pray. Would you stand
