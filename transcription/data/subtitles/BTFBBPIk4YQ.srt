1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,599
First Thessalonians chapter number three.

2
00:00:04,599 --> 00:00:07,079
Of course, we just completed our revival meeting.

3
00:00:07,079 --> 00:00:09,159
We took some testimonies this evening.

4
00:00:09,159 --> 00:00:13,779
And typically when you have a meeting like what we just concluded, you find that there

5
00:00:13,779 --> 00:00:15,720
are decisions that are made.

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:22,700
In fact, if you spent any time praying in advance of the meeting, one of the points

7
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:28,799
on that special prayer list that I distributed was that there would be decisions made.

8
00:00:28,799 --> 00:00:35,680
And I know that as we come to every service, as we enter into our personal time with the

9
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,400
Lord, as we go to the Word of God, we ought to be ready to make decisions each and every

10
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,639
day of our lives, that we would make decisions that I'll say, yes, Lord, yes, even as we

11
00:00:44,639 --> 00:00:50,680
sang that chorus throughout the revival meeting, that I want to agree with God that when the

12
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:56,040
Holy Spirit of God speaks to my heart through the precious Word of God, that my answer is

13
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,119
going to be yes.

14
00:00:57,159 --> 00:01:02,439
And there are going to be some decisions that we make, decisions of things that we need

15
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:08,319
to do that we have not been doing, decisions that need to be made of stopping, ceasing

16
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:12,120
to do some things that perhaps we have been doing.

17
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:17,800
I believe that as people, the people of God respond to the Word of God, that that's a

18
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,559
good thing, amen?

19
00:01:19,559 --> 00:01:26,400
And it's a precious thing when God works in your heart, when God uses His Word, whether

20
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,040
it's in your personal time with the Lord or it's a public setting like this, whether

21
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:37,040
it's a church service that's a typical weekly scheduled church service or whether it's a

22
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:44,680
special meeting, when God would speak to your heart through His precious Word, that's precious.

23
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,360
And I'm so thankful that God uses His Word.

24
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,080
At times, the decisions that are made are known publicly.

25
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:58,360
There are times in which people will make some type of public decision and they'll announce

26
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:03,959
what that decision may be, but most times we find that it's regularly, it's often the

27
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:09,479
case that those decisions are personal decisions that are not made public, that are just known

28
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,600
by the individual.

29
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,960
And not only by the individual, but of course by God.

30
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,559
God knows the decisions that we're making.

31
00:02:17,559 --> 00:02:24,800
And I think often as I begin to consider special meetings, I think about teen camps,

32
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,720
revival meetings, missions, conferences, just even church services.

33
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,720
Every service that we have on Sundays, Sunday morning, Sunday evening, Wednesday we have

34
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,880
our prayer meeting, but on Sunday morning and Sunday evening we conclude our services

35
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,039
with a time of invitation.

36
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:44,119
Why do we do that?

37
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:47,320
Because it gives an opportunity for people to respond.

38
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,919
It gives people an opportunity to make a decision.

39
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:54,600
I think about the wonderful song, Who is on the Lord's Side, right?

40
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,800
That's an account from the life of Moses.

41
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,919
I mean, he drew a line in the sand, right?

42
00:02:58,919 --> 00:02:59,919
Who's on the Lord's side?

43
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:01,240
Let him come over here.

44
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:09,160
And we find that the reality is that there are times in which decisions are short-lived.

45
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,520
They're soon forgotten about.

46
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:17,160
And it's my desire in my life personally, but also in the life of God's people, that

47
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,759
the decisions that are made are decisions that endure.

48
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:26,000
Decisions that will stand the test of time, that will stand the attack of the enemy.

49
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,639
We must understand this evening that the enemy, our enemy, your enemy, our common enemy, he

50
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:36,080
is not interested in you making any decisions for God.

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,759
And as soon as you make that decision, you can mark it down, you can be confident that

52
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:47,399
there will become attacks, there will be pressures that you begin to face with regard to those

53
00:03:47,399 --> 00:03:49,960
decisions that you've made.

54
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,960
And so how is it, as we would look at this passage of Scripture, I believe that the Apostle

55
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:59,440
Paul, he had a great care and concern for the people that God enabled him to minister

56
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,440
to.

57
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,039
If you read in 2 Corinthians, in chapter number 11, he speaks about all of the things that

58
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:10,080
he's endured, and he finishes up that section, that statement, by saying, and above all these

59
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,279
things, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches.

60
00:04:14,279 --> 00:04:18,720
You'll note that in the life of the Apostle Paul, after they finished the first missionary

61
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,920
journey, if you were to go back in Acts chapter number 14 and see how they circled back to

62
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:27,920
each of those cities that God enabled them to go to, that as they met with those individuals,

63
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:32,040
they encouraged them to continue.

64
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,839
Just because Paul was leaving, just because he wasn't going to be there, they put leadership

65
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:40,399
in place, but the encouragement, the challenge was continue.

66
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:44,000
I think about Paul writing to Timothy under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God

67
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,559
in 2 Timothy chapter number 3, and as Paul is giving Timothy all of the information with

68
00:04:49,559 --> 00:04:56,799
regard to these days, the last days, the perilous times, and all that would take place.

69
00:04:56,799 --> 00:04:57,959
But continue thou.

70
00:04:58,679 --> 00:05:04,559
He had a desire that Timothy, his son in the faith, that as he would take that baton, spiritually

71
00:05:04,559 --> 00:05:11,480
speaking, and pass it to a next generation, that Timothy would embrace and he would endure

72
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,320
the difficulties.

73
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:18,640
He would endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ, and he would press forward.

74
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:23,200
And I believe that Paul had that concern, and we see it here in 1 Thessalonians chapter

75
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,679
number 3, the title tonight, Decisions That Endure.

76
00:05:26,679 --> 00:05:30,519
If you're taking notes, number one, Paul was concerned.

77
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:32,359
Let's look at the first eight verses here.

78
00:05:32,359 --> 00:05:34,119
Notice what the Bible says,

79
00:05:34,119 --> 00:05:41,519
Wherefore, when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone,

80
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:46,279
and sent Timotheus, our brother and minister of God, and our fellow laborer in the gospel

81
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:52,079
of Christ, to establish you and to comfort you concerning your faith, that no man should

82
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:54,559
be moved by these afflictions.

83
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:59,000
For yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto.

84
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,959
For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulation,

85
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:09,600
even as it came to pass, and ye know.

86
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:15,760
For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means

87
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:20,359
the tempter have tempted you, and our labor be in vain.

88
00:06:20,359 --> 00:06:27,600
But now, when, notice, Timotheus came from you unto us and brought us good tidings of

89
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,799
your faith and charity, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly

90
00:06:32,799 --> 00:06:35,200
to see us, and we also to see you.

91
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:41,239
Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by

92
00:06:41,239 --> 00:06:42,600
your faith.

93
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,519
For now we live, if we stand fast in the Lord.

94
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:50,119
Notice, why is it that I would say Paul was concerned?

95
00:06:50,119 --> 00:06:54,200
It's interesting that in verse 1, and again in verse number 5, you see this phrase.

96
00:06:54,200 --> 00:07:00,239
In verse number 1 it says, wherefore, when we, it's the plural aspect here, but when

97
00:07:00,239 --> 00:07:03,959
we could no longer forbear.

98
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:06,000
We could no longer forbear.

99
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,320
And then down in verse number 5, notice what he says, for this cause, when I could no longer

100
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,320
forbear.

101
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:17,760
Paul says we collectively as the missionary team, the individuals that ministered in this

102
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:21,600
city of Thessalonica, we no longer could forbear.

103
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:26,720
And then he says personally in verse number 5, I could no longer forbear.

104
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,959
He could not refrain.

105
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:35,459
He could not keep from desiring to find out what was going on, the no longer being able

106
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:36,459
to forbear.

107
00:07:36,459 --> 00:07:42,760
What they did, the response to that, was they sent Timotheus for a purpose.

108
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:49,799
And it was Paul's concern that brought him to a place of no longer being able to forbear,

109
00:07:49,799 --> 00:07:56,480
but needing to send someone, a representative, one from the team, that would go and find

110
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:00,119
out, examine, see the state of the believers.

111
00:08:00,119 --> 00:08:01,880
How are they doing?

112
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,920
Because we ministered there, and as we ministered there, there were souls that got saved.

113
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:10,799
There were decisions that were made, and we warned them about tribulation and trials that

114
00:08:10,799 --> 00:08:11,799
would come.

115
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:16,480
Paul had some concern that with all of these things that they're experiencing, that perhaps

116
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:21,920
our labor has been in vain, and he could no longer forbear.

117
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,880
He's concerned for the brethren at Thessalonica.

118
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:33,960
Notice what it says in verse number 3, that no man should be moved by these afflictions.

119
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:38,039
So we know that there were some difficulties, some afflictions that they were dealing with.

120
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:42,840
And by the way, you understand that we also face difficulties, amen?

121
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,400
We face trials and troubles and afflictions.

122
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:51,919
And Paul says this, yea, all those that live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.

123
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:56,760
And we find that Jesus said in the book of John, hey listen, if they hate you, don't

124
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,359
be surprised because they hated me, amen?

125
00:09:00,359 --> 00:09:04,880
And the time's going to come where they're going to seek to do you harm.

126
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,440
In fact, in John chapter number 16, you don't need to turn there, but it's interesting as

127
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,039
to note what Jesus says.

128
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:15,479
He said the time is going to come, I'm telling you these things so that when it comes, you'll

129
00:09:15,479 --> 00:09:17,119
know that I've told you these things.

130
00:09:17,119 --> 00:09:21,359
They shall put you out of the synagogues, yea, the time cometh that whosoever killeth

131
00:09:21,359 --> 00:09:24,119
you will think that he doeth God's service.

132
00:09:24,119 --> 00:09:28,280
And these things will they do unto you because they have not known the Father nor me.

133
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:33,679
John 16, verses 2 and 3, he tells them in verse number 4, but these things have I told

134
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:40,719
you that when the time shall come, ye may remember that I told you of them.

135
00:09:40,719 --> 00:09:45,400
And so we find that, listen, there are going to be difficulties and afflictions and persecutions

136
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:49,200
and trials that we endure, troubles in our lives.

137
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,559
It's important for us to understand, even as I may note by way of introduction, that

138
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:59,559
it seems as if when you make that decision for God, when the Holy Spirit of God is using

139
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:00,559
the word of God, it seems as if you're making that decision for God when the Holy Spirit

140
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:00,559


141
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:03,399
of God in your life and you come to that place of decision

142
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:05,399
and you make that right decision,

143
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:10,639
it seems as if that the trials really start coming, right?

144
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:13,499
That's been my experience in life.

145
00:10:13,499 --> 00:10:15,079
You make a decision that you're going

146
00:10:15,079 --> 00:10:17,719
to give some money for a Samoan Bible project,

147
00:10:17,719 --> 00:10:21,359
and then all of a sudden you got an auto repair that came up.

148
00:10:21,359 --> 00:10:22,839
And you say, man, alive.

149
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:24,799
I mean, I made that decision.

150
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:25,759
It was by faith.

151
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:27,519
I believe God wanted me to do this,

152
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,799
and now I have this situation.

153
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,439
He's in control of all those things, amen?

154
00:10:33,439 --> 00:10:36,919
And we could use a whole host of examples this evening,

155
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:39,679
but the reality is that when you make a decision,

156
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:42,319
I'm going to continue moving forward for Christ.

157
00:10:42,319 --> 00:10:46,199
I'm going to be more vocal in my witness.

158
00:10:46,199 --> 00:10:49,279
I'm going to seek to reach my neighbors and my co-workers.

159
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,079
I'm going to be the ambassador that God's called me to be.

160
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,999
You can rest assured there's going to be some opposition.

161
00:10:54,999 --> 00:10:57,399
There's going to be some trials, some affliction,

162
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:00,159
some hardship that you're going to deal with.

163
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,679
You might get called in the office.

164
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:04,720
Hey, you're not allowed to do that.

165
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,599
You can't do this.

166
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,879
You can't do that.

167
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,519
You understand.

168
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:10,839
I can't tell you how many times as I've

169
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:13,159
gone door knocking in northern Virginia over the years

170
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:16,199
that people say, I'm going to call the police on you.

171
00:11:16,199 --> 00:11:19,680
I love it when Brother Mark is my partner.

172
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,639
He's right here, man.

173
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:22,199
Call him.

174
00:11:22,199 --> 00:11:24,680
But the reality is that, listen, there's

175
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,879
going to be opposition.

176
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:31,360
The question is what happens in our lives with that decision

177
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,919
that we made.

178
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:35,479
Is that decision going to endure?

179
00:11:35,479 --> 00:11:40,199
Or is the affliction, the trial, the trouble, the opposition,

180
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:43,759
is it going to cause us to falter, to waver, to flounder,

181
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:49,360
to say, well, maybe I wasn't supposed

182
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,959
to make that decision?

183
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:55,639
Because we can rest assured that the trials, the afflictions,

184
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:57,239
are going to come.

185
00:11:57,239 --> 00:11:58,819
Note at the end of verse number three,

186
00:11:58,819 --> 00:12:00,639
Paul says, for yourselves know that we

187
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,439
are appointed thereunto.

188
00:12:03,439 --> 00:12:05,239
Notice what Paul says in verse number five,

189
00:12:05,239 --> 00:12:08,040
gives us further insight.

190
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,119
He says that when he could no longer forbear,

191
00:12:10,119 --> 00:12:11,720
I sent to know your faith.

192
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:15,639
Notice what he says, lest by some means

193
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:18,919
the tempter have tempted you.

194
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:20,759
Who's the tempter?

195
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:24,279
Satan, the enemy, right?

196
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:29,720
Lest by some means the tempter have tempted you.

197
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:35,000
And notice what Paul says, and our labor be in vain.

198
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I really don't think it was a situation where

199
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Paul was so concerned about his labor being in vain

200
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,279
in the sense of he wouldn't have as many periodicals written

201
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,639
about the work that he did, and so on and so forth.

202
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:49,539
I think it was more because he was concerned

203
00:12:49,539 --> 00:12:53,080
about the souls of men.

204
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:56,440
And we find that as these individuals would

205
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,599
make the decisions to serve God, you

206
00:12:58,599 --> 00:13:00,399
understand they're living in a culture that

207
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,080
is against Christianity.

208
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,279
They're against biblical Christianity.

209
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:06,039
It's not going to be commonly supported.

210
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:08,559
It's not going to be an easy road, so to speak.

211
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:10,440
And we find that they make these decisions.

212
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,759
And Paul says the afflictions in verse number three,

213
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:16,239
but then in verse number five, he says, lest by some means

214
00:13:16,239 --> 00:13:18,479
the tempter have tempted you.

215
00:13:18,479 --> 00:13:21,000
Listen, the enemy is seeking whom he may devour,

216
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
but he's also tempting people.

217
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,919
And he's seeking to cause you to not make those decisions

218
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:32,440
or not to fulfill the decisions that God, the Holy Spirit of God,

219
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,599
impressed upon your heart to make.

220
00:13:35,599 --> 00:13:38,360
So Paul is concerned.

221
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:42,639
I believe that his concern is appropriate.

222
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,039
I believe that as a spiritual leader,

223
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:50,599
it would be a common concern amongst those

224
00:13:50,599 --> 00:13:53,440
that you would have the privilege of being able to lead,

225
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,880
that they would continue and that they would serve God

226
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,279
faithfully, that they would finish their race,

227
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,559
that they would finish their course.

228
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:04,319
See, the desire for me as a spiritual leader,

229
00:14:04,319 --> 00:14:07,000
I believe the desire for Paul as a spiritual leader

230
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,759
was, number one, that we would finish our course with joy.

231
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:12,679
He says that in Acts 20 and verse number 24,

232
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:14,080
but none of these things move me,

233
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,360
neither count on my life dear unto myself,

234
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,239
that I might finish my course with joy.

235
00:14:19,239 --> 00:14:21,359
But it wasn't just that Paul was concerned

236
00:14:21,359 --> 00:14:23,440
about finishing his course with joy,

237
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,679
he desired that those that he ministered to also

238
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:29,600
finish their course with joy.

239
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,000
There are times in which in dealing

240
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,399
with spiritual leadership, and you

241
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:35,399
could think of it in various contexts,

242
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:38,040
you could think about it as parents with children,

243
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:42,000
and you think about the aspect of spiritual leadership,

244
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,919
there are times in which you wish you could

245
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:46,880
make a decision for someone.

246
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,880
You ever been there?

247
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,279
You say, man, I wish I could make this decision for you,

248
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:53,880
but you understand you can't.

249
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,600
And it's one of the hardest things in life

250
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,559
to watch somebody make a wrong decision.

251
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,440
It really is.

252
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,799
It's hard.

253
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:04,279
And what can you do?

254
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:05,799
You can pray.

255
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:08,600
I can't make the decision for them.

256
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,919
I can't make the decision for you.

257
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:13,000
I can just pray.

258
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,720
I can just pray.

259
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,559
And when you see someone making those decisions,

260
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:18,959
and you understand that, listen,

261
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:23,679
they're going to stand before God by themselves.

262
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:25,639
Now, I'm going to stand before God by myself,

263
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:27,919
but one of the responsibilities that I have as a pastor

264
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:29,839
is that I watch for your souls.

265
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,839
That's a heavy, heavy load.

266
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,200
And if God did not call me to pastor,

267
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,399
I wouldn't want anything to do with it.

268
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,839
I'm just being honest with you.

269
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:42,679
It's a call that God placed on your life,

270
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:44,040
and you take that responsibility,

271
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:45,359
and you understand the seriousness

272
00:15:45,359 --> 00:15:47,760
of the soberness of it.

273
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,519
But Paul has a concern.

274
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:50,720
Why is it that he says,

275
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,679
it's interesting, I mentioned it by way of introduction,

276
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:57,079
but it's amazing and I think it's worth reading.

277
00:15:57,079 --> 00:16:00,480
In 2 Corinthians 11, turn over there if you will,

278
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,160
and I want you to notice what Paul says.

279
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,200
It's just so impactful to me

280
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:09,639
when I read these words of the Apostle Paul

281
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:13,519
beginning in v. 22 of 2 Corinthians 11.

282
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:15,200
He says, are they Hebrews? So am I.

283
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,559
Are they Israelites? So am I.

284
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:18,959
Are they the seed of Abraham? So am I.

285
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,320
Are they ministers of Christ? I speak as a fool. I am more.

286
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,399
Notice what he says, in labors more abundant,

287
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:27,720
in stripes above measure,

288
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:32,160
in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft.

289
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:37,200
Of the Jews, five times received I forty stripes, save one.

290
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,160
Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned.

291
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,959
Thrice I suffered shipwreck.

292
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,440
A night and a day I have been in the deep.

293
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,160
Wow.

294
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,480
In journeyings often, in perils of waters,

295
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,639
in perils of robbers,

296
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:53,320
in perils by my own countrymen,

297
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,519
in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city,

298
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,839
in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea,

299
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,160
in perils among the brethren,

300
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,559
in weariness and painfulness,

301
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:02,559
in watchings often, in hunger and thirst,

302
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:06,559
in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.

303
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,760
Wow.

304
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,119
It's interesting that in chapter 4,

305
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:12,519
you know how Paul refers to all these things?

306
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:15,160
Light, affliction.

307
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,079
That's but for a moment.

308
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:20,799
That's a perspective that will help us in our lives.

309
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,919
But I want you to notice what he says in verse 28.

310
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,919
Beside those things that are without,

311
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:29,959
that which cometh upon me daily,

312
00:17:29,959 --> 00:17:33,760
the care of all the churches.

313
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,720
Paul had a concern,

314
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,519
and I believe it was an appropriate concern

315
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:39,959
for these believers in Thessalonica.

316
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:43,839
His concern that they should not be moved

317
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:46,880
by these afflictions.

318
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,040
We all know some that started the race

319
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,880
and they're no longer in the race.

320
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,239
We know people that have become casualties along the way.

321
00:17:57,239 --> 00:18:00,880
People that perhaps you used to sit next to in church

322
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,880
that you heard give testimony

323
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,839
and responded and made decisions,

324
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:07,919
but when the fire was turned up, so to speak,

325
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:09,600
there was some kind of affliction,

326
00:18:09,639 --> 00:18:12,679
some sort of temptation from the tempter that came,

327
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:15,480
and it got them sideways.

328
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,119
And they were moved.

329
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:20,359
Demas hath forsaken me,

330
00:18:20,359 --> 00:18:21,919
having loved this present world.

331
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:25,559
Is that not what Paul says in 2 Timothy?

332
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:27,880
So as we begin to notice the concern,

333
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,880
I believe it's an appropriate concern

334
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,880
for a spiritual leader to have that concern

335
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,719
for the people that God has called them to minister to

336
00:18:34,719 --> 00:18:37,000
that they would continue.

337
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,960
I want you to notice that Paul was comforted.

338
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,119
He was concerned as we pointed out in these verses,

339
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:46,679
but I want you to see how that Paul was comforted.

340
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:49,320
I want you to notice that because of this concern,

341
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,039
because he could no longer forbear,

342
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:52,640
we notice that in verse 2,

343
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,359
the Bible says that we sent Timotheus,

344
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:56,200
our brother and minister of God,

345
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,359
and our fellow laborer in the Gospel of Christ

346
00:18:58,359 --> 00:19:00,279
to establish you and to comfort you

347
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:02,080
concerning your faith.

348
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,840
And so Timothy was given with a specific purpose.

349
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,559
He was sent, excuse me, with a specific purpose.

350
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:11,000
He was given this mission to go back to Thessalonica.

351
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
If you notice back at the end of chapter number two,

352
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,840
you'll begin to see with some things that were going on.

353
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,960
In fact, if you go back to Acts 17,

354
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,440
you understand the way that the persecution

355
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,440
came into the city of Thessalonica.

356
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,559
Those from the previous cities where they had been

357
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,119
did not like what was going on.

358
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:28,239
And they shuffled Paul away.

359
00:19:28,239 --> 00:19:31,400
And it was in that time that he saw the city of Athens

360
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,760
that was wholly given to idolatry and so on and so forth.

361
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,279
And we find that here,

362
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:38,520
Paul says we could no longer forbear,

363
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,039
so we send Timothy.

364
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:41,919
And Timothy has a purpose.

365
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:46,239
There is a specific reason in sending Timothy.

366
00:19:46,239 --> 00:19:47,520
It was to establish you

367
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,000
and to comfort you concerning your faith.

368
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,400
Isn't it interesting that there are times

369
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,159
in which you might try to comfort somebody else

370
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:54,279
and you're comforted?

371
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,559
You try to be a blessing to somebody and you're blessed?

372
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,000
You try to be an encouragement to someone

373
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,080
and you're encouraged?

374
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,400
Man, it's exciting when that happens.

375
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,880
We find that the Bible says that Timothy was sent.

376
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:12,880
Notice in verse number six, the concern, remember, was that their labor was in vain.

377
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,800
The concern was that they were moved by the afflictions that the tempter have tempted

378
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,800
them.

379
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:23,560
But he says, but now, in verse number six, when Timotheus came from you unto us.

380
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:27,240
So Timothy fulfilled that purpose that he had been given.

381
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:31,640
He had gone and he went and he discovered what was going on.

382
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,520
And the Bible says that he returned to Paul.

383
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:41,520
It says that he came from you unto us and brought us good tidings of your faith.

384
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:46,760
Don't you think Paul was comforted with this report that he received from Timothy?

385
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:51,720
As Timothy would return with this report, this good tidings of their faith, no doubt

386
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:55,280
this caused Paul to not only be comforted but to be encouraged.

387
00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:00,000
I find that the Bible says not only the good tidings of your faith and charity and that

388
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:06,400
you have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us as we also to see you.

389
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,760
I mean, can you imagine the joy as Paul received that report?

390
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:17,600
Now, understand, we're reading something that's taken place a couple thousand years ago almost.

391
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,880
But when Paul sent Timothy, he had a genuine concern.

392
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:27,240
And he did not know what the report was going to be, right?

393
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,600
Is that correct?

394
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,400
He didn't know what Timothy was going to find when he went to Thessalonica.

395
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:37,080
He didn't know if he was going to find a group of people that continued and were faithful

396
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,080
and were steadfast.

397
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:43,080
He didn't know what the report was going to be.

398
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:50,800
And I believe that there was a level of anxiousness maybe awaiting the report.

399
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:55,640
We understand what it is to wait for someone to give us a report on something, do we not?

400
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:00,560
And sometimes that anxiety can build up where we're anxiously awaiting the response.

401
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,720
We want to know.

402
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,160
And the response comes.

403
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:11,080
Timothy returns and he says, it is well.

404
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,240
It is well.

405
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,080
Good tidings of your faith and charity.

406
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,400
They have good remembrance of us always.

407
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:28,360
He says this, therefore, notice verse number seven, brethren, we were comforted over you

408
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:31,200
in all our affliction and distress by your faith.

409
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,520
Can you see how serious this concern was for Paul as he mentions in verse number seven?

410
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:40,680
And we see that he was comforted with this report.

411
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:46,080
This report that Timothy brought back that they continued, that they endured, that they

412
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:53,320
were steadfast, brought great joy and excitement to the life and the heart of the apostle Paul.

413
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:57,880
And I believe that as Paul received that report, and you notice in verse number 80, he says,

414
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:01,560
for now we live if we stand fast in the Lord.

415
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:06,600
That idea of standing fast and enduring those hardships, enduring those afflictions and

416
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,600
continuing and being steadfast.

417
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:13,960
I just think this evening that as I look at this portion of Scripture that there are some

418
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:22,120
keys, one in particular that I want to look at as to how it was that these believers in

419
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:25,040
Thessalonica could continue.

420
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:29,700
How was it that this report was brought back?

421
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,600
These decisions were made when Paul was there.

422
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:37,400
See, if we're not careful at times, decisions can be made out of emotions only.

423
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,080
We can make an emotional decision.

424
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,840
I remember when I was in Bible college, the Bible college I went to was always trying

425
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,960
to raise money for something, and they had all sorts of things, and they had this big

426
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,480
dinner once a year.

427
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,680
I can't remember what they called it, but some kind of dinner, and they tried to raise

428
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:56,760
money and so on and so forth, and they would have different groups from the college sing.

429
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:00,880
I was never part of one of those groups, and they would do various things and have all

430
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,920
sorts of presentations about the college, and they would ask people to be willing to

431
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:11,080
give some type of contribution, donation to the cause to help underwrite, if you will,

432
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:15,720
underwrite the tuition cost and so on and so forth.

433
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:20,520
And I remember at one of those particular meetings, I can't remember what year it was

434
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:24,600
that I was in school, and I remember in one of those we went back, and I remember that

435
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:31,280
week in chapel hearing about a very large contribution that was promised.

436
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,920
And man, the faculty was excited.

437
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:39,200
I mean, they were excited about it, and it never came to pass.

438
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:44,000
And it was extremely disappointing to the faculty, and as they had, of course, it would

439
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,080
be very awkward to have to follow up with an individual that made a promise and then

440
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:52,120
didn't fulfill the promise, and, hey, listen, you know, you said you were going to do this

441
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:57,720
so on and so forth, and man, we could really use that, and they said, you know, I just,

442
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:02,160
it was just such an emotional time, and I was just so, man, I love what you're doing,

443
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,240
but I don't have that kind of money.

444
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,160
That wasn't very helpful.

445
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:11,240
It was an emotional decision, but it didn't do anything for anybody.

446
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:16,400
And that's a funny illustration, but the reality is there are times that we're in a preaching

447
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:21,080
service that we can just make an emotional response.

448
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:26,360
And I would say this, typically, emotional decisions don't last.

449
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:29,720
They just really don't.

450
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:35,280
Typically, you'll find that the circumstances change.

451
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,720
The afflictions come.

452
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:41,240
It's no longer as exciting.

453
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:46,120
You no longer have everyone kind of cheering for you, and so those emotional decisions

454
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:49,120
rarely do they last.

455
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:54,440
Far better that we would make decisions that would endure, decisions that are not emotional,

456
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:58,120
but decisions that are based upon the Word of God.

457
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,120
Why?

458
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,200
Because the Word of God is eternal.

459
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,400
The Word of God is unchanging.

460
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:07,880
You understand this evening that God's Word is settled in heaven forever.

461
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,880
It's never going to change.

462
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:14,760
Listen, there are people that try to change it all the time, but God's Word is settled.

463
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:19,360
And when we make decisions based upon the Word of God, I believe that those decisions

464
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,560
can endure.

465
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:26,360
That's why I think it's so imperative that we preach the Word of God, because if we just

466
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:30,640
preach opinions and ideas, and this is my perspective, and so on and so forth, then

467
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:35,280
you're going to be asked to make a decision based upon my opinion.

468
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:39,600
And my opinion might change, if it's just that, my opinion.

469
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,840
But why is it that Paul says to Timothy, preach the Word?

470
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:46,280
Because as we preach the Word of God, God's Word doesn't change, and the Holy Spirit of

471
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:50,520
God uses the Word of God in the heart of the people of God, and when the people of God

472
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:57,320
respond to the Word of God and make a decision based upon, here's what God said, God doesn't

473
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,320
change.

474
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,640
He's immutable.

475
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,120
He's the same yesterday and today and forever.

476
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:07,200
He says that He changes not, and His Word doesn't change.

477
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,520
It's forever settled.

478
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:12,140
Notice back in chapter number two, maybe it's on the same page for you, but it's a page

479
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,200
back for me.

480
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,660
Turn back to chapter number two and look at verse number 13.

481
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:21,660
Notice how Paul is rejoicing in verse number 13 of 1 Thessalonians chapter number two.

482
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:25,180
It says this, for this cause also, thank we God without ceasing.

483
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:29,580
What was it that would cause Paul to say, we were rejoicing and we were thanking God

484
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:32,180
without ceasing for this thing?

485
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:37,260
It's this, because when you received the Word of God, which He heard of us, you received

486
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:44,460
it not as the Word of men, but as it is in truth.

487
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:51,020
The Word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe.

488
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:54,780
Man, God's Word works in our hearts, does it not?

489
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,260
And Paul is rejoicing.

490
00:27:56,260 --> 00:28:02,740
He says that because of this very thing, it causes me to rejoice and to thank God without

491
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:07,580
ceasing that we came in and we preached the Word of God, and when we preached the Word

492
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:11,100
of God, you received it as it is.

493
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:16,380
The Word of God, not the Word of men, not somebody's opinion, but you received it as

494
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:21,340
it is, and it works.

495
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:27,740
It works effectually in you that believe.

496
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:35,020
And I believe this evening that one of the keys, the most important key to a decision

497
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:39,260
that endures is making a decision based upon the Word of God.

498
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:44,860
I think about Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, or the book of Daniel.

499
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:47,420
Most of us are familiar with the portion of Scripture.

500
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:51,500
We don't have time this evening to go there and to read that.

501
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:56,900
We remember that Nebuchadnezzar set up that great image and said he was going to play

502
00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:01,380
all the music and everyone's going to bow down and worship.

503
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,700
Those guys made a decision.

504
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,619
Actually everybody made a decision.

505
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:08,980
The majority of the people made a decision that they were going to bow down, right?

506
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:09,980
Why?

507
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:12,420
Because it was better for them.

508
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,660
If not, what was the consequence?

509
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:16,540
You're going to go into the fiery furnace.

510
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:21,860
But these three Hebrew children, they made a decision that they were not going to bow.

511
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:29,020
Is it not the case that that decision was immediately challenged, right?

512
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:33,739
There were some that said, hey, these guys, they didn't bow down.

513
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:37,020
Nebuchadnezzar, in all of his anger, he says, okay, here's what I'm going to do.

514
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:42,220
I'm going to play the music again, give you another opportunity.

515
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:45,059
I don't care how long you play the music.

516
00:29:45,059 --> 00:29:47,100
That's my version.

517
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:50,299
If you read Daniel 3, it's not what it says, amen?

518
00:29:50,299 --> 00:29:52,500
That's just how I like to look at it.

519
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:56,580
Listen, they said, we're not careful to answer thee in this manner.

520
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,580
They understood he was the king.

521
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,720
They understood his power.

522
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,100
But they were looking to the king of kings.

523
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,700
They were looking to the Lord God Omnipotent.

524
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:06,700
And you know what God says in His Word?

525
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:09,420
You're not to bow down to any image.

526
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:12,900
You're not to have any idols.

527
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:17,700
No doubt these three Hebrew children were familiar with those admonitions that were

528
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:22,620
found in the Pentateuch and they would have a level of knowledge of what God said with

529
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:23,700
regard to this.

530
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,260
And they said, listen, we're not going to bow down.

531
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,260
Why?

532
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:35,060
Because God's Word clearly states that we cannot do this.

533
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:38,060
And therefore, we're not going to bow.

534
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:43,660
All right, we're going to turn on the fire, the furnace, seven times hotter.

535
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:46,820
The guys that threw them in, die, right?

536
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:49,300
We're familiar with the text of Scripture.

537
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:53,740
All the way up into the, listen, they were bound, the Bible tells us.

538
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,500
I don't know what you would do in that situation.

539
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,700
I don't know what I would do in that situation.

540
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:02,740
I would hope and pray that I would not have bowed, that I would just continue to go into

541
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:05,940
that fiery furnace like those three Hebrew children did.

542
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:09,180
I know it's easy for us to say, we can do it.

543
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:14,500
It's a different thing when you're getting wrapped up and the fire is burning, man.

544
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,420
Right?

545
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:23,540
And all the way up until that point, they could have changed their decision.

546
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:26,940
And they could have said, all right, all right, Nebuchadnezzar, just play it one more

547
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:29,180
time and we'll bow.

548
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:33,540
Wouldn't that have been awful?

549
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:36,540
I mean, honestly.

550
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:41,300
Daniel 3 probably wouldn't even be in our Bibles, especially not the way it's written

551
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:50,220
in our Bibles, but how do you make a decision like that, that endures that fire, that level

552
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:53,380
of affliction?

553
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:56,820
It must be made upon this book.

554
00:31:56,820 --> 00:32:01,460
And when you make a decision based upon this book, you can just kind of sit back and say,

555
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:04,620
I've already made my decision that's based upon a biblical principle.

556
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:07,860
I'm not going to change.

557
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:11,100
You're just so narrow-minded.

558
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,380
I just believe the book.

559
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,920
Amen?

560
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,620
You just need another perspective.

561
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,220
You need to get up with the times.

562
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,220
No, no.

563
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:21,660
You just need to follow the book.

564
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,860
Amen?

565
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:26,300
The culture wants us to cave.

566
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,940
Churches all across America are caving.

567
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:33,660
You just ride around and see what's going on at some of these churches.

568
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:39,500
It's sickening for them to even call themselves a church.

569
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,860
It doesn't matter what the culture says.

570
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:46,820
It doesn't matter the pressures that would face in Thessalonica.

571
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:51,100
They had the Word of God and they made a decision that was based upon the Word of God.

572
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:56,180
And so when Paul has this concern, he says, I can no longer forbear.

573
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,260
I need to know.

574
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,780
I need to find out how you're doing.

575
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:04,900
And I sent Timothy to find out and I was concerned because of the afflictions and I was concerned

576
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,500
because of the tempter.

577
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:09,180
And I thought that perhaps our labor was in vain.

578
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:15,060
And then Timothy returns with this good report of good tidings.

579
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,300
You know what I found, Paul?

580
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,140
I found that they're still serving.

581
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:20,860
I found that they're still doing what they're supposed to do.

582
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:24,500
Remember, it was in chapter number one that Paul said that from you sounded out the Word

583
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,820
of the Lord.

584
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:30,220
They were faithful to do what they were called to do.

585
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:37,860
This evening, I know that we've made decisions, not only during the revival meeting, but perhaps

586
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,900
this morning.

587
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:44,060
Perhaps in your own personal devotions this week, you made some decisions.

588
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:50,760
We must ensure that those decisions are based upon the Word of God because it never changes.

589
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,920
And I offer this suggestion in closing.

590
00:33:53,920 --> 00:34:01,580
I believe that the key to a decision that will endure is to make it based upon the Word

591
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:02,580
of God.

592
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:10,560
But I also believe that a helpful suggestion would be this, to have an accountability partner.

593
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:15,160
To make known to someone that you can trust and someone that you can confide in, perhaps

594
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:19,120
the decision that you made.

595
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:25,800
Notice that the Bible tells us back in 1 Thessalonians 2, that it tells us in verse number two that

596
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:29,880
Timothy was going to establish you.

597
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:34,240
And you think about that, how that someone, an accountability partner, can help establish

598
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:37,600
us, help encourage us.

599
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,360
Notice what it says in verse number 10.

600
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:43,040
He says, and perfect that which is lacking in your faith.

601
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:49,360
See, there are times as brethren, as brothers and sisters in Christ, that we can confide

602
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:54,440
in someone and we can have an accountability partner that can help us, that can help keep

603
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,440
us.

604
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,240
Hey listen, I've made this decision based upon the Word of God and I, with God's help

605
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:04,320
and by God's grace, I intend to do this and man, would you pray for me and would you encourage

606
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,480
me and would you help me, would you hold me accountable?

607
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:12,160
You know, being accountable is much different than getting counsel.

608
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,640
Getting counsel is basically having somebody answer your questions.

609
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:20,680
Being accountable is you answering someone else's questions.

610
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,960
Be accountable to someone.

611
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,160
Maybe it's a husband, he needs to be accountable to a wife, a wife to a husband, maybe a child

612
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:30,120
to a parent, maybe just a brother to a brother in Christ.

613
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:33,280
Hey listen, God's working in my heart.

614
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:39,120
It's not to make ourselves look good at some decision that we've made, but it's in humility,

615
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:43,200
in understanding that we have an enemy that wants to attack and bring affliction and trouble

616
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:48,960
and trial and get us detoured from that decision that we made and we say, would you partner

617
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,960
with me?

618
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:56,080
Would you be this accountability partner to pray with me and to check up on me and to

619
00:35:56,080 --> 00:36:02,560
ensure that God is going to do what, that I'm going to do what I've committed to God

620
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,560
to do?

621
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:08,000
It's not a bad thing to have an accountability partner.

622
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,080
They can help establish us.

623
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:17,440
They can help to perfect that which is lacking in our faith, requires humility to have an

624
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:23,080
accountability partner, but I believe that it's, I believe it's a good suggestion.

625
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:29,200
Again, the greatest key to a decision that endures is that it's based upon a biblical

626
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:33,560
truth because God's Word is never going to change.

627
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:41,320
That ought to cause us to rejoice, but maybe, maybe you've been down the road long enough

628
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:48,720
in your Christian journey that you've made some decisions and they've just been short-lived.

629
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:54,600
It seems like at the next meeting, the next time you visit that passage of scripture that

630
00:36:54,600 --> 00:37:00,440
God works again in that same way and you're making that same decision again.

631
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:06,240
You say, what happened in the time in between, the months that passed?

632
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,880
Why was that decision short-lived?

633
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,300
What happened?

634
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:14,720
If it was a good decision that was based upon the Word of God, maybe there's an opportunity

635
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:21,840
for an accountability partner to help that, bridge that gap, to help see that thing endure.

636
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,080
Paul was concerned, but Paul was comforted.

637
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:30,360
It's encouraging when you hear of others that continue, that allow God to have His

638
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,840
way in their lives.

639
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:37,800
I hope that God would help us to have decisions that endure.

640
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,800
Let's pray.

641
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,800
Father, we love you.

642
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,840
We thank you for loving us.

643
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:46,400
I thank you for the opportunity that we had last week to have revival meeting and I thank

644
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,400
you for the messages that we heard.

645
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,560
I thank you for how you worked in my heart and my life.

646
00:37:51,560 --> 00:38:01,400
I thank you for decisions that were made and though we do not know many of those decisions,

647
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:06,680
not public in nature, more private, I pray that those decisions have not been made out

648
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:11,520
of emotion, but those decisions have been made based upon, founded upon the Word of

649
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,960
God.

650
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:21,720
It's my prayer that decisions would not be short-lived, but decisions would endure.

651
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:24,600
God I pray that you'd help us tonight.

652
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:29,400
I pray that as we'd reflect back over the last week and even as we look forward in our

653
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:34,720
walk with you as we consider future decisions that will be made, God would you help us to

654
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:41,120
make those decisions based upon biblical truth.

655
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:46,160
Perhaps tonight there's some that need to seek out, prayerfully seek out an accountability

656
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:53,800
partner, someone that can help them, humanly speaking.

657
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,800
Pray with them.

658
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,800
Partner with them.

659
00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:01,160
Lord, I pray that you would move and work as only you can and we'll be careful to give

660
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,160
you the glory.

661
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,160
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

662
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:03,160
