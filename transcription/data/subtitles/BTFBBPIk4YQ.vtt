00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.599
First Thessalonians chapter number three.

00:00:04.599 --> 00:00:07.079
Of course, we just completed our revival meeting.

00:00:07.079 --> 00:00:09.159
We took some testimonies this evening.

00:00:09.159 --> 00:00:13.779
And typically when you have a meeting like what we just concluded, you find that there

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:15.720
are decisions that are made.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:22.700
In fact, if you spent any time praying in advance of the meeting, one of the points

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:28.799
on that special prayer list that I distributed was that there would be decisions made.

00:00:28.799 --> 00:00:35.680
And I know that as we come to every service, as we enter into our personal time with the

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.400
Lord, as we go to the Word of God, we ought to be ready to make decisions each and every

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.639
day of our lives, that we would make decisions that I'll say, yes, Lord, yes, even as we

00:00:44.639 --> 00:00:50.680
sang that chorus throughout the revival meeting, that I want to agree with God that when the

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:56.040
Holy Spirit of God speaks to my heart through the precious Word of God, that my answer is

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.119
going to be yes.

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:02.439
And there are going to be some decisions that we make, decisions of things that we need

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:08.319
to do that we have not been doing, decisions that need to be made of stopping, ceasing

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:12.120
to do some things that perhaps we have been doing.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.800
I believe that as people, the people of God respond to the Word of God, that that's a

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.559
good thing, amen?

00:01:19.559 --> 00:01:26.400
And it's a precious thing when God works in your heart, when God uses His Word, whether

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.040
it's in your personal time with the Lord or it's a public setting like this, whether

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:37.040
it's a church service that's a typical weekly scheduled church service or whether it's a

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:44.680
special meeting, when God would speak to your heart through His precious Word, that's precious.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.360
And I'm so thankful that God uses His Word.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.080
At times, the decisions that are made are known publicly.

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:58.360
There are times in which people will make some type of public decision and they'll announce

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.959
what that decision may be, but most times we find that it's regularly, it's often the

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:09.479
case that those decisions are personal decisions that are not made public, that are just known

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.600
by the individual.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.960
And not only by the individual, but of course by God.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.559
God knows the decisions that we're making.

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:24.800
And I think often as I begin to consider special meetings, I think about teen camps,

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.720
revival meetings, missions, conferences, just even church services.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.720
Every service that we have on Sundays, Sunday morning, Sunday evening, Wednesday we have

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.880
our prayer meeting, but on Sunday morning and Sunday evening we conclude our services

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.039
with a time of invitation.

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:44.119
Why do we do that?

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:47.320
Because it gives an opportunity for people to respond.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.919
It gives people an opportunity to make a decision.

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:54.600
I think about the wonderful song, Who is on the Lord's Side, right?

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.800
That's an account from the life of Moses.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.919
I mean, he drew a line in the sand, right?

00:02:58.919 --> 00:02:59.919
Who's on the Lord's side?

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:01.240
Let him come over here.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:09.160
And we find that the reality is that there are times in which decisions are short-lived.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.520
They're soon forgotten about.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:17.160
And it's my desire in my life personally, but also in the life of God's people, that

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.759
the decisions that are made are decisions that endure.

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:26.000
Decisions that will stand the test of time, that will stand the attack of the enemy.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.639
We must understand this evening that the enemy, our enemy, your enemy, our common enemy, he

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:36.080
is not interested in you making any decisions for God.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.759
And as soon as you make that decision, you can mark it down, you can be confident that

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:47.399
there will become attacks, there will be pressures that you begin to face with regard to those

00:03:47.399 --> 00:03:49.960
decisions that you've made.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.960
And so how is it, as we would look at this passage of Scripture, I believe that the Apostle

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:59.440
Paul, he had a great care and concern for the people that God enabled him to minister

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.440
to.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.039
If you read in 2 Corinthians, in chapter number 11, he speaks about all of the things that

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:10.080
he's endured, and he finishes up that section, that statement, by saying, and above all these

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.279
things, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches.

00:04:14.279 --> 00:04:18.720
You'll note that in the life of the Apostle Paul, after they finished the first missionary

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.920
journey, if you were to go back in Acts chapter number 14 and see how they circled back to

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:27.920
each of those cities that God enabled them to go to, that as they met with those individuals,

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.040
they encouraged them to continue.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.839
Just because Paul was leaving, just because he wasn't going to be there, they put leadership

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:40.399
in place, but the encouragement, the challenge was continue.

00:04:40.399 --> 00:04:44.000
I think about Paul writing to Timothy under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.559
in 2 Timothy chapter number 3, and as Paul is giving Timothy all of the information with

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:56.799
regard to these days, the last days, the perilous times, and all that would take place.

00:04:56.799 --> 00:04:57.959
But continue thou.

00:04:58.679 --> 00:05:04.559
He had a desire that Timothy, his son in the faith, that as he would take that baton, spiritually

00:05:04.559 --> 00:05:11.480
speaking, and pass it to a next generation, that Timothy would embrace and he would endure

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.320
the difficulties.

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:18.640
He would endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ, and he would press forward.

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:23.200
And I believe that Paul had that concern, and we see it here in 1 Thessalonians chapter

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.679
number 3, the title tonight, Decisions That Endure.

00:05:26.679 --> 00:05:30.519
If you're taking notes, number one, Paul was concerned.

00:05:30.519 --> 00:05:32.359
Let's look at the first eight verses here.

00:05:32.359 --> 00:05:34.119
Notice what the Bible says,

00:05:34.119 --> 00:05:41.519
Wherefore, when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone,

00:05:41.519 --> 00:05:46.279
and sent Timotheus, our brother and minister of God, and our fellow laborer in the gospel

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:52.079
of Christ, to establish you and to comfort you concerning your faith, that no man should

00:05:52.079 --> 00:05:54.559
be moved by these afflictions.

00:05:54.559 --> 00:05:59.000
For yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.959
For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulation,

00:06:04.959 --> 00:06:09.600
even as it came to pass, and ye know.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:15.760
For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:20.359
the tempter have tempted you, and our labor be in vain.

00:06:20.359 --> 00:06:27.600
But now, when, notice, Timotheus came from you unto us and brought us good tidings of

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.799
your faith and charity, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly

00:06:32.799 --> 00:06:35.200
to see us, and we also to see you.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:41.239
Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by

00:06:41.239 --> 00:06:42.600
your faith.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.519
For now we live, if we stand fast in the Lord.

00:06:46.519 --> 00:06:50.119
Notice, why is it that I would say Paul was concerned?

00:06:50.119 --> 00:06:54.200
It's interesting that in verse 1, and again in verse number 5, you see this phrase.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:07:00.239
In verse number 1 it says, wherefore, when we, it's the plural aspect here, but when

00:07:00.239 --> 00:07:03.959
we could no longer forbear.

00:07:03.959 --> 00:07:06.000
We could no longer forbear.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.320
And then down in verse number 5, notice what he says, for this cause, when I could no longer

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.320
forbear.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:17.760
Paul says we collectively as the missionary team, the individuals that ministered in this

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:21.600
city of Thessalonica, we no longer could forbear.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:26.720
And then he says personally in verse number 5, I could no longer forbear.

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:27.959
He could not refrain.

00:07:27.959 --> 00:07:35.459
He could not keep from desiring to find out what was going on, the no longer being able

00:07:35.459 --> 00:07:36.459
to forbear.

00:07:36.459 --> 00:07:42.760
What they did, the response to that, was they sent Timotheus for a purpose.

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:49.799
And it was Paul's concern that brought him to a place of no longer being able to forbear,

00:07:49.799 --> 00:07:56.480
but needing to send someone, a representative, one from the team, that would go and find

00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:00.119
out, examine, see the state of the believers.

00:08:00.119 --> 00:08:01.880
How are they doing?

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:05.920
Because we ministered there, and as we ministered there, there were souls that got saved.

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:10.799
There were decisions that were made, and we warned them about tribulation and trials that

00:08:10.799 --> 00:08:11.799
would come.

00:08:11.839 --> 00:08:16.480
Paul had some concern that with all of these things that they're experiencing, that perhaps

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:21.920
our labor has been in vain, and he could no longer forbear.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:24.880
He's concerned for the brethren at Thessalonica.

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:33.960
Notice what it says in verse number 3, that no man should be moved by these afflictions.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:38.039
So we know that there were some difficulties, some afflictions that they were dealing with.

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:42.840
And by the way, you understand that we also face difficulties, amen?

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.400
We face trials and troubles and afflictions.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:51.919
And Paul says this, yea, all those that live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.

00:08:51.919 --> 00:08:56.760
And we find that Jesus said in the book of John, hey listen, if they hate you, don't

00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:00.359
be surprised because they hated me, amen?

00:09:00.359 --> 00:09:04.880
And the time's going to come where they're going to seek to do you harm.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:09.440
In fact, in John chapter number 16, you don't need to turn there, but it's interesting as

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.039
to note what Jesus says.

00:09:11.039 --> 00:09:15.479
He said the time is going to come, I'm telling you these things so that when it comes, you'll

00:09:15.479 --> 00:09:17.119
know that I've told you these things.

00:09:17.119 --> 00:09:21.359
They shall put you out of the synagogues, yea, the time cometh that whosoever killeth

00:09:21.359 --> 00:09:24.119
you will think that he doeth God's service.

00:09:24.119 --> 00:09:28.280
And these things will they do unto you because they have not known the Father nor me.

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:33.679
John 16, verses 2 and 3, he tells them in verse number 4, but these things have I told

00:09:33.679 --> 00:09:40.719
you that when the time shall come, ye may remember that I told you of them.

00:09:40.719 --> 00:09:45.400
And so we find that, listen, there are going to be difficulties and afflictions and persecutions

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:49.200
and trials that we endure, troubles in our lives.

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:53.559
It's important for us to understand, even as I may note by way of introduction, that

00:09:53.559 --> 00:09:59.559
it seems as if when you make that decision for God, when the Holy Spirit of God is using

00:09:59.559 --> 00:10:00.559
the word of God, it seems as if you're making that decision for God when the Holy Spirit

00:10:00.559 --> 00:10:00.559


00:10:00.559 --> 00:10:03.399
of God in your life and you come to that place of decision

00:10:03.399 --> 00:10:05.399
and you make that right decision,

00:10:05.399 --> 00:10:10.639
it seems as if that the trials really start coming, right?

00:10:10.639 --> 00:10:13.499
That's been my experience in life.

00:10:13.499 --> 00:10:15.079
You make a decision that you're going

00:10:15.079 --> 00:10:17.719
to give some money for a Samoan Bible project,

00:10:17.719 --> 00:10:21.359
and then all of a sudden you got an auto repair that came up.

00:10:21.359 --> 00:10:22.839
And you say, man, alive.

00:10:22.839 --> 00:10:24.799
I mean, I made that decision.

00:10:24.799 --> 00:10:25.759
It was by faith.

00:10:25.759 --> 00:10:27.519
I believe God wanted me to do this,

00:10:27.519 --> 00:10:29.799
and now I have this situation.

00:10:30.399 --> 00:10:33.439
He's in control of all those things, amen?

00:10:33.439 --> 00:10:36.919
And we could use a whole host of examples this evening,

00:10:36.919 --> 00:10:39.679
but the reality is that when you make a decision,

00:10:39.679 --> 00:10:42.319
I'm going to continue moving forward for Christ.

00:10:42.319 --> 00:10:46.199
I'm going to be more vocal in my witness.

00:10:46.199 --> 00:10:49.279
I'm going to seek to reach my neighbors and my co-workers.

00:10:49.279 --> 00:10:52.079
I'm going to be the ambassador that God's called me to be.

00:10:52.079 --> 00:10:54.999
You can rest assured there's going to be some opposition.

00:10:54.999 --> 00:10:57.399
There's going to be some trials, some affliction,

00:10:57.399 --> 00:11:00.159
some hardship that you're going to deal with.

00:11:00.159 --> 00:11:01.679
You might get called in the office.

00:11:01.679 --> 00:11:04.720
Hey, you're not allowed to do that.

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:05.599
You can't do this.

00:11:05.599 --> 00:11:06.879
You can't do that.

00:11:06.879 --> 00:11:08.519
You understand.

00:11:08.519 --> 00:11:10.839
I can't tell you how many times as I've

00:11:10.839 --> 00:11:13.159
gone door knocking in northern Virginia over the years

00:11:13.159 --> 00:11:16.199
that people say, I'm going to call the police on you.

00:11:16.199 --> 00:11:19.680
I love it when Brother Mark is my partner.

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:20.639
He's right here, man.

00:11:20.639 --> 00:11:22.199
Call him.

00:11:22.199 --> 00:11:24.680
But the reality is that, listen, there's

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:26.879
going to be opposition.

00:11:26.879 --> 00:11:31.360
The question is what happens in our lives with that decision

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:32.919
that we made.

00:11:32.919 --> 00:11:35.479
Is that decision going to endure?

00:11:35.479 --> 00:11:40.199
Or is the affliction, the trial, the trouble, the opposition,

00:11:40.199 --> 00:11:43.759
is it going to cause us to falter, to waver, to flounder,

00:11:43.759 --> 00:11:49.360
to say, well, maybe I wasn't supposed

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:51.959
to make that decision?

00:11:51.959 --> 00:11:55.639
Because we can rest assured that the trials, the afflictions,

00:11:55.639 --> 00:11:57.239
are going to come.

00:11:57.239 --> 00:11:58.819
Note at the end of verse number three,

00:11:58.819 --> 00:12:00.639
Paul says, for yourselves know that we

00:12:00.639 --> 00:12:03.439
are appointed thereunto.

00:12:03.439 --> 00:12:05.239
Notice what Paul says in verse number five,

00:12:05.239 --> 00:12:08.040
gives us further insight.

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:10.119
He says that when he could no longer forbear,

00:12:10.119 --> 00:12:11.720
I sent to know your faith.

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:15.639
Notice what he says, lest by some means

00:12:15.639 --> 00:12:18.919
the tempter have tempted you.

00:12:18.919 --> 00:12:20.759
Who's the tempter?

00:12:20.759 --> 00:12:24.279
Satan, the enemy, right?

00:12:24.279 --> 00:12:29.720
Lest by some means the tempter have tempted you.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:35.000
And notice what Paul says, and our labor be in vain.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
I really don't think it was a situation where

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Paul was so concerned about his labor being in vain

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.279
in the sense of he wouldn't have as many periodicals written

00:12:45.279 --> 00:12:47.639
about the work that he did, and so on and so forth.

00:12:47.639 --> 00:12:49.539
I think it was more because he was concerned

00:12:49.539 --> 00:12:53.080
about the souls of men.

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:56.440
And we find that as these individuals would

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:58.599
make the decisions to serve God, you

00:12:58.599 --> 00:13:00.399
understand they're living in a culture that

00:13:00.399 --> 00:13:02.080
is against Christianity.

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:04.279
They're against biblical Christianity.

00:13:04.279 --> 00:13:06.039
It's not going to be commonly supported.

00:13:06.039 --> 00:13:08.559
It's not going to be an easy road, so to speak.

00:13:08.559 --> 00:13:10.440
And we find that they make these decisions.

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:13.759
And Paul says the afflictions in verse number three,

00:13:13.759 --> 00:13:16.239
but then in verse number five, he says, lest by some means

00:13:16.239 --> 00:13:18.479
the tempter have tempted you.

00:13:18.479 --> 00:13:21.000
Listen, the enemy is seeking whom he may devour,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
but he's also tempting people.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.919
And he's seeking to cause you to not make those decisions

00:13:27.919 --> 00:13:32.440
or not to fulfill the decisions that God, the Holy Spirit of God,

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:35.599
impressed upon your heart to make.

00:13:35.599 --> 00:13:38.360
So Paul is concerned.

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:42.639
I believe that his concern is appropriate.

00:13:42.639 --> 00:13:45.039
I believe that as a spiritual leader,

00:13:45.039 --> 00:13:50.599
it would be a common concern amongst those

00:13:50.599 --> 00:13:53.440
that you would have the privilege of being able to lead,

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:56.880
that they would continue and that they would serve God

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:59.279
faithfully, that they would finish their race,

00:13:59.279 --> 00:14:01.559
that they would finish their course.

00:14:01.559 --> 00:14:04.319
See, the desire for me as a spiritual leader,

00:14:04.319 --> 00:14:07.000
I believe the desire for Paul as a spiritual leader

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.759
was, number one, that we would finish our course with joy.

00:14:09.759 --> 00:14:12.679
He says that in Acts 20 and verse number 24,

00:14:12.679 --> 00:14:14.080
but none of these things move me,

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:16.360
neither count on my life dear unto myself,

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:19.239
that I might finish my course with joy.

00:14:19.239 --> 00:14:21.359
But it wasn't just that Paul was concerned

00:14:21.359 --> 00:14:23.440
about finishing his course with joy,

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:26.679
he desired that those that he ministered to also

00:14:26.679 --> 00:14:29.600
finish their course with joy.

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:32.000
There are times in which in dealing

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.399
with spiritual leadership, and you

00:14:33.399 --> 00:14:35.399
could think of it in various contexts,

00:14:35.399 --> 00:14:38.040
you could think about it as parents with children,

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:42.000
and you think about the aspect of spiritual leadership,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.919
there are times in which you wish you could

00:14:44.919 --> 00:14:46.880
make a decision for someone.

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:47.880
You ever been there?

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:50.279
You say, man, I wish I could make this decision for you,

00:14:50.279 --> 00:14:53.880
but you understand you can't.

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:55.600
And it's one of the hardest things in life

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:58.559
to watch somebody make a wrong decision.

00:14:58.559 --> 00:15:00.440
It really is.

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:02.799
It's hard.

00:15:02.799 --> 00:15:04.279
And what can you do?

00:15:04.279 --> 00:15:05.799
You can pray.

00:15:05.799 --> 00:15:08.600
I can't make the decision for them.

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:10.919
I can't make the decision for you.

00:15:10.919 --> 00:15:13.000
I can just pray.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.720
I can just pray.

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:17.559
And when you see someone making those decisions,

00:15:17.559 --> 00:15:18.959
and you understand that, listen,

00:15:18.959 --> 00:15:23.679
they're going to stand before God by themselves.

00:15:23.679 --> 00:15:25.639
Now, I'm going to stand before God by myself,

00:15:25.639 --> 00:15:27.919
but one of the responsibilities that I have as a pastor

00:15:27.919 --> 00:15:29.839
is that I watch for your souls.

00:15:29.839 --> 00:15:33.839
That's a heavy, heavy load.

00:15:33.839 --> 00:15:36.200
And if God did not call me to pastor,

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:38.399
I wouldn't want anything to do with it.

00:15:38.399 --> 00:15:40.839
I'm just being honest with you.

00:15:40.839 --> 00:15:42.679
It's a call that God placed on your life,

00:15:42.679 --> 00:15:44.040
and you take that responsibility,

00:15:44.079 --> 00:15:45.359
and you understand the seriousness

00:15:45.359 --> 00:15:47.760
of the soberness of it.

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:49.519
But Paul has a concern.

00:15:49.519 --> 00:15:50.720
Why is it that he says,

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:53.679
it's interesting, I mentioned it by way of introduction,

00:15:53.679 --> 00:15:57.079
but it's amazing and I think it's worth reading.

00:15:57.079 --> 00:16:00.480
In 2 Corinthians 11, turn over there if you will,

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:03.160
and I want you to notice what Paul says.

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:05.200
It's just so impactful to me

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:09.639
when I read these words of the Apostle Paul

00:16:09.639 --> 00:16:13.519
beginning in v. 22 of 2 Corinthians 11.

00:16:13.559 --> 00:16:15.200
He says, are they Hebrews? So am I.

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.559
Are they Israelites? So am I.

00:16:16.559 --> 00:16:18.959
Are they the seed of Abraham? So am I.

00:16:18.959 --> 00:16:22.320
Are they ministers of Christ? I speak as a fool. I am more.

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:25.399
Notice what he says, in labors more abundant,

00:16:25.399 --> 00:16:27.720
in stripes above measure,

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:32.160
in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft.

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:37.200
Of the Jews, five times received I forty stripes, save one.

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:40.160
Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned.

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:41.959
Thrice I suffered shipwreck.

00:16:41.959 --> 00:16:44.440
A night and a day I have been in the deep.

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:47.160
Wow.

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:49.480
In journeyings often, in perils of waters,

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:51.639
in perils of robbers,

00:16:51.639 --> 00:16:53.320
in perils by my own countrymen,

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:55.519
in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city,

00:16:55.519 --> 00:16:57.839
in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea,

00:16:57.839 --> 00:16:59.160
in perils among the brethren,

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:00.559
in weariness and painfulness,

00:17:00.559 --> 00:17:02.559
in watchings often, in hunger and thirst,

00:17:02.559 --> 00:17:06.559
in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.

00:17:06.559 --> 00:17:07.760
Wow.

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:10.119
It's interesting that in chapter 4,

00:17:10.119 --> 00:17:12.519
you know how Paul refers to all these things?

00:17:12.519 --> 00:17:15.160
Light, affliction.

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:17.079
That's but for a moment.

00:17:17.079 --> 00:17:20.799
That's a perspective that will help us in our lives.

00:17:20.799 --> 00:17:23.919
But I want you to notice what he says in verse 28.

00:17:23.919 --> 00:17:26.919
Beside those things that are without,

00:17:26.919 --> 00:17:29.959
that which cometh upon me daily,

00:17:29.959 --> 00:17:33.760
the care of all the churches.

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:35.720
Paul had a concern,

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:37.519
and I believe it was an appropriate concern

00:17:37.519 --> 00:17:39.959
for these believers in Thessalonica.

00:17:39.959 --> 00:17:43.839
His concern that they should not be moved

00:17:43.839 --> 00:17:46.880
by these afflictions.

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:49.040
We all know some that started the race

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:52.880
and they're no longer in the race.

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:57.239
We know people that have become casualties along the way.

00:17:57.239 --> 00:18:00.880
People that perhaps you used to sit next to in church

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.880
that you heard give testimony

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:04.839
and responded and made decisions,

00:18:04.839 --> 00:18:07.919
but when the fire was turned up, so to speak,

00:18:07.919 --> 00:18:09.600
there was some kind of affliction,

00:18:09.639 --> 00:18:12.679
some sort of temptation from the tempter that came,

00:18:12.679 --> 00:18:15.480
and it got them sideways.

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:18.119
And they were moved.

00:18:18.119 --> 00:18:20.359
Demas hath forsaken me,

00:18:20.359 --> 00:18:21.919
having loved this present world.

00:18:21.919 --> 00:18:25.559
Is that not what Paul says in 2 Timothy?

00:18:25.559 --> 00:18:27.880
So as we begin to notice the concern,

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:29.880
I believe it's an appropriate concern

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:31.880
for a spiritual leader to have that concern

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:34.719
for the people that God has called them to minister to

00:18:34.719 --> 00:18:37.000
that they would continue.

00:18:37.039 --> 00:18:39.960
I want you to notice that Paul was comforted.

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:42.119
He was concerned as we pointed out in these verses,

00:18:42.119 --> 00:18:46.679
but I want you to see how that Paul was comforted.

00:18:46.679 --> 00:18:49.320
I want you to notice that because of this concern,

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:51.039
because he could no longer forbear,

00:18:51.039 --> 00:18:52.640
we notice that in verse 2,

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:54.359
the Bible says that we sent Timotheus,

00:18:54.359 --> 00:18:56.200
our brother and minister of God,

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:58.359
and our fellow laborer in the Gospel of Christ

00:18:58.359 --> 00:19:00.279
to establish you and to comfort you

00:19:00.279 --> 00:19:02.080
concerning your faith.

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:04.840
And so Timothy was given with a specific purpose.

00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:07.559
He was sent, excuse me, with a specific purpose.

00:19:07.559 --> 00:19:11.000
He was given this mission to go back to Thessalonica.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000
If you notice back at the end of chapter number two,

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.840
you'll begin to see with some things that were going on.

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:17.960
In fact, if you go back to Acts 17,

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:20.440
you understand the way that the persecution

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:22.440
came into the city of Thessalonica.

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:24.559
Those from the previous cities where they had been

00:19:24.559 --> 00:19:26.119
did not like what was going on.

00:19:26.119 --> 00:19:28.239
And they shuffled Paul away.

00:19:28.239 --> 00:19:31.400
And it was in that time that he saw the city of Athens

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:34.760
that was wholly given to idolatry and so on and so forth.

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:36.279
And we find that here,

00:19:36.279 --> 00:19:38.520
Paul says we could no longer forbear,

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:40.039
so we send Timothy.

00:19:40.039 --> 00:19:41.919
And Timothy has a purpose.

00:19:41.919 --> 00:19:46.239
There is a specific reason in sending Timothy.

00:19:46.239 --> 00:19:47.520
It was to establish you

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:50.000
and to comfort you concerning your faith.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.400
Isn't it interesting that there are times

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:53.159
in which you might try to comfort somebody else

00:19:53.159 --> 00:19:54.279
and you're comforted?

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:58.559
You try to be a blessing to somebody and you're blessed?

00:19:58.559 --> 00:20:00.000
You try to be an encouragement to someone

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.080
and you're encouraged?

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:04.400
Man, it's exciting when that happens.

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:07.880
We find that the Bible says that Timothy was sent.

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:12.880
Notice in verse number six, the concern, remember, was that their labor was in vain.

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:17.800
The concern was that they were moved by the afflictions that the tempter have tempted

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:18.800
them.

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:23.560
But he says, but now, in verse number six, when Timotheus came from you unto us.

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:27.240
So Timothy fulfilled that purpose that he had been given.

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:31.640
He had gone and he went and he discovered what was going on.

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:34.520
And the Bible says that he returned to Paul.

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:41.520
It says that he came from you unto us and brought us good tidings of your faith.

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:46.760
Don't you think Paul was comforted with this report that he received from Timothy?

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:51.720
As Timothy would return with this report, this good tidings of their faith, no doubt

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:55.280
this caused Paul to not only be comforted but to be encouraged.

00:20:55.280 --> 00:21:00.000
I find that the Bible says not only the good tidings of your faith and charity and that

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:06.400
you have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us as we also to see you.

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:10.760
I mean, can you imagine the joy as Paul received that report?

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:17.600
Now, understand, we're reading something that's taken place a couple thousand years ago almost.

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:21.880
But when Paul sent Timothy, he had a genuine concern.

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:27.240
And he did not know what the report was going to be, right?

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:28.600
Is that correct?

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:32.400
He didn't know what Timothy was going to find when he went to Thessalonica.

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:37.080
He didn't know if he was going to find a group of people that continued and were faithful

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:39.080
and were steadfast.

00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:43.080
He didn't know what the report was going to be.

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:50.800
And I believe that there was a level of anxiousness maybe awaiting the report.

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:55.640
We understand what it is to wait for someone to give us a report on something, do we not?

00:21:55.640 --> 00:22:00.560
And sometimes that anxiety can build up where we're anxiously awaiting the response.

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:03.720
We want to know.

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:06.160
And the response comes.

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:11.080
Timothy returns and he says, it is well.

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:14.240
It is well.

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:18.080
Good tidings of your faith and charity.

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:21.400
They have good remembrance of us always.

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:28.360
He says this, therefore, notice verse number seven, brethren, we were comforted over you

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:31.200
in all our affliction and distress by your faith.

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:36.520
Can you see how serious this concern was for Paul as he mentions in verse number seven?

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:40.680
And we see that he was comforted with this report.

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:46.080
This report that Timothy brought back that they continued, that they endured, that they

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:53.320
were steadfast, brought great joy and excitement to the life and the heart of the apostle Paul.

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:57.880
And I believe that as Paul received that report, and you notice in verse number 80, he says,

00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:01.560
for now we live if we stand fast in the Lord.

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:06.600
That idea of standing fast and enduring those hardships, enduring those afflictions and

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:08.600
continuing and being steadfast.

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:13.960
I just think this evening that as I look at this portion of Scripture that there are some

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:22.120
keys, one in particular that I want to look at as to how it was that these believers in

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:25.040
Thessalonica could continue.

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:29.700
How was it that this report was brought back?

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:31.600
These decisions were made when Paul was there.

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:37.400
See, if we're not careful at times, decisions can be made out of emotions only.

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:40.080
We can make an emotional decision.

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:43.840
I remember when I was in Bible college, the Bible college I went to was always trying

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:47.960
to raise money for something, and they had all sorts of things, and they had this big

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:49.480
dinner once a year.

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:52.680
I can't remember what they called it, but some kind of dinner, and they tried to raise

00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:56.760
money and so on and so forth, and they would have different groups from the college sing.

00:23:56.760 --> 00:24:00.880
I was never part of one of those groups, and they would do various things and have all

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:05.920
sorts of presentations about the college, and they would ask people to be willing to

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:11.080
give some type of contribution, donation to the cause to help underwrite, if you will,

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:15.720
underwrite the tuition cost and so on and so forth.

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:20.520
And I remember at one of those particular meetings, I can't remember what year it was

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:24.600
that I was in school, and I remember in one of those we went back, and I remember that

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:31.280
week in chapel hearing about a very large contribution that was promised.

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:32.920
And man, the faculty was excited.

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:39.200
I mean, they were excited about it, and it never came to pass.

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:44.000
And it was extremely disappointing to the faculty, and as they had, of course, it would

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.080
be very awkward to have to follow up with an individual that made a promise and then

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:52.120
didn't fulfill the promise, and, hey, listen, you know, you said you were going to do this

00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:57.720
so on and so forth, and man, we could really use that, and they said, you know, I just,

00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:02.160
it was just such an emotional time, and I was just so, man, I love what you're doing,

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:05.240
but I don't have that kind of money.

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:07.160
That wasn't very helpful.

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:11.240
It was an emotional decision, but it didn't do anything for anybody.

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:16.400
And that's a funny illustration, but the reality is there are times that we're in a preaching

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:21.080
service that we can just make an emotional response.

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:26.360
And I would say this, typically, emotional decisions don't last.

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:29.720
They just really don't.

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:35.280
Typically, you'll find that the circumstances change.

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:37.720
The afflictions come.

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:41.240
It's no longer as exciting.

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:46.120
You no longer have everyone kind of cheering for you, and so those emotional decisions

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:49.120
rarely do they last.

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:54.440
Far better that we would make decisions that would endure, decisions that are not emotional,

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:58.120
but decisions that are based upon the Word of God.

00:25:58.120 --> 00:25:59.120
Why?

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:01.200
Because the Word of God is eternal.

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:03.400
The Word of God is unchanging.

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:07.880
You understand this evening that God's Word is settled in heaven forever.

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:08.880
It's never going to change.

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:14.760
Listen, there are people that try to change it all the time, but God's Word is settled.

00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:19.360
And when we make decisions based upon the Word of God, I believe that those decisions

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:21.560
can endure.

00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:26.360
That's why I think it's so imperative that we preach the Word of God, because if we just

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:30.640
preach opinions and ideas, and this is my perspective, and so on and so forth, then

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:35.280
you're going to be asked to make a decision based upon my opinion.

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:39.600
And my opinion might change, if it's just that, my opinion.

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:42.840
But why is it that Paul says to Timothy, preach the Word?

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:46.280
Because as we preach the Word of God, God's Word doesn't change, and the Holy Spirit of

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:50.520
God uses the Word of God in the heart of the people of God, and when the people of God

00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:57.320
respond to the Word of God and make a decision based upon, here's what God said, God doesn't

00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:58.320
change.

00:26:58.320 --> 00:26:59.640
He's immutable.

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:02.120
He's the same yesterday and today and forever.

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:07.200
He says that He changes not, and His Word doesn't change.

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:08.520
It's forever settled.

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:12.140
Notice back in chapter number two, maybe it's on the same page for you, but it's a page

00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:13.200
back for me.

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:16.660
Turn back to chapter number two and look at verse number 13.

00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:21.660
Notice how Paul is rejoicing in verse number 13 of 1 Thessalonians chapter number two.

00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:25.180
It says this, for this cause also, thank we God without ceasing.

00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:29.580
What was it that would cause Paul to say, we were rejoicing and we were thanking God

00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:32.180
without ceasing for this thing?

00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:37.260
It's this, because when you received the Word of God, which He heard of us, you received

00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:44.460
it not as the Word of men, but as it is in truth.

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:51.020
The Word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe.

00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:54.780
Man, God's Word works in our hearts, does it not?

00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:56.260
And Paul is rejoicing.

00:27:56.260 --> 00:28:02.740
He says that because of this very thing, it causes me to rejoice and to thank God without

00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:07.580
ceasing that we came in and we preached the Word of God, and when we preached the Word

00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:11.100
of God, you received it as it is.

00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:16.380
The Word of God, not the Word of men, not somebody's opinion, but you received it as

00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:21.340
it is, and it works.

00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:27.740
It works effectually in you that believe.

00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:35.020
And I believe this evening that one of the keys, the most important key to a decision

00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:39.260
that endures is making a decision based upon the Word of God.

00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:44.860
I think about Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, or the book of Daniel.

00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:47.420
Most of us are familiar with the portion of Scripture.

00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:51.500
We don't have time this evening to go there and to read that.

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:56.900
We remember that Nebuchadnezzar set up that great image and said he was going to play

00:28:56.900 --> 00:29:01.380
all the music and everyone's going to bow down and worship.

00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:02.700
Those guys made a decision.

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:05.619
Actually everybody made a decision.

00:29:05.619 --> 00:29:08.980
The majority of the people made a decision that they were going to bow down, right?

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:09.980
Why?

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:12.420
Because it was better for them.

00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:13.660
If not, what was the consequence?

00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:16.540
You're going to go into the fiery furnace.

00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:21.860
But these three Hebrew children, they made a decision that they were not going to bow.

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:29.020
Is it not the case that that decision was immediately challenged, right?

00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:33.739
There were some that said, hey, these guys, they didn't bow down.

00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:37.020
Nebuchadnezzar, in all of his anger, he says, okay, here's what I'm going to do.

00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:42.220
I'm going to play the music again, give you another opportunity.

00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:45.059
I don't care how long you play the music.

00:29:45.059 --> 00:29:47.100
That's my version.

00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:50.299
If you read Daniel 3, it's not what it says, amen?

00:29:50.299 --> 00:29:52.500
That's just how I like to look at it.

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:56.580
Listen, they said, we're not careful to answer thee in this manner.

00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:57.580
They understood he was the king.

00:29:57.580 --> 00:29:59.720
They understood his power.

00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:01.100
But they were looking to the king of kings.

00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:03.700
They were looking to the Lord God Omnipotent.

00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:06.700
And you know what God says in His Word?

00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:09.420
You're not to bow down to any image.

00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:12.900
You're not to have any idols.

00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:17.700
No doubt these three Hebrew children were familiar with those admonitions that were

00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:22.620
found in the Pentateuch and they would have a level of knowledge of what God said with

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:23.700
regard to this.

00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:26.260
And they said, listen, we're not going to bow down.

00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:27.260
Why?

00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:35.060
Because God's Word clearly states that we cannot do this.

00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:38.060
And therefore, we're not going to bow.

00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:43.660
All right, we're going to turn on the fire, the furnace, seven times hotter.

00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:46.820
The guys that threw them in, die, right?

00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:49.300
We're familiar with the text of Scripture.

00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:53.740
All the way up into the, listen, they were bound, the Bible tells us.

00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:55.500
I don't know what you would do in that situation.

00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:57.700
I don't know what I would do in that situation.

00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:02.740
I would hope and pray that I would not have bowed, that I would just continue to go into

00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:05.940
that fiery furnace like those three Hebrew children did.

00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:09.180
I know it's easy for us to say, we can do it.

00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:14.500
It's a different thing when you're getting wrapped up and the fire is burning, man.

00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:16.420
Right?

00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:23.540
And all the way up until that point, they could have changed their decision.

00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:26.940
And they could have said, all right, all right, Nebuchadnezzar, just play it one more

00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:29.180
time and we'll bow.

00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:33.540
Wouldn't that have been awful?

00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:36.540
I mean, honestly.

00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:41.300
Daniel 3 probably wouldn't even be in our Bibles, especially not the way it's written

00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:50.220
in our Bibles, but how do you make a decision like that, that endures that fire, that level

00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:53.380
of affliction?

00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:56.820
It must be made upon this book.

00:31:56.820 --> 00:32:01.460
And when you make a decision based upon this book, you can just kind of sit back and say,

00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:04.620
I've already made my decision that's based upon a biblical principle.

00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:07.860
I'm not going to change.

00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:11.100
You're just so narrow-minded.

00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:13.380
I just believe the book.

00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:14.920
Amen?

00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:16.620
You just need another perspective.

00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:18.220
You need to get up with the times.

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:19.220
No, no.

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:21.660
You just need to follow the book.

00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:22.860
Amen?

00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:26.300
The culture wants us to cave.

00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:28.940
Churches all across America are caving.

00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:33.660
You just ride around and see what's going on at some of these churches.

00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:39.500
It's sickening for them to even call themselves a church.

00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:42.860
It doesn't matter what the culture says.

00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:46.820
It doesn't matter the pressures that would face in Thessalonica.

00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:51.100
They had the Word of God and they made a decision that was based upon the Word of God.

00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:56.180
And so when Paul has this concern, he says, I can no longer forbear.

00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:57.260
I need to know.

00:32:57.260 --> 00:32:59.780
I need to find out how you're doing.

00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:04.900
And I sent Timothy to find out and I was concerned because of the afflictions and I was concerned

00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:06.500
because of the tempter.

00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:09.180
And I thought that perhaps our labor was in vain.

00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:15.060
And then Timothy returns with this good report of good tidings.

00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:16.300
You know what I found, Paul?

00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:18.140
I found that they're still serving.

00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:20.860
I found that they're still doing what they're supposed to do.

00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:24.500
Remember, it was in chapter number one that Paul said that from you sounded out the Word

00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:25.820
of the Lord.

00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:30.220
They were faithful to do what they were called to do.

00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:37.860
This evening, I know that we've made decisions, not only during the revival meeting, but perhaps

00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:39.900
this morning.

00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:44.060
Perhaps in your own personal devotions this week, you made some decisions.

00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:50.760
We must ensure that those decisions are based upon the Word of God because it never changes.

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:53.920
And I offer this suggestion in closing.

00:33:53.920 --> 00:34:01.580
I believe that the key to a decision that will endure is to make it based upon the Word

00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:02.580
of God.

00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:10.560
But I also believe that a helpful suggestion would be this, to have an accountability partner.

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:15.160
To make known to someone that you can trust and someone that you can confide in, perhaps

00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:19.120
the decision that you made.

00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:25.800
Notice that the Bible tells us back in 1 Thessalonians 2, that it tells us in verse number two that

00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:29.880
Timothy was going to establish you.

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:34.240
And you think about that, how that someone, an accountability partner, can help establish

00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:37.600
us, help encourage us.

00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:39.360
Notice what it says in verse number 10.

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:43.040
He says, and perfect that which is lacking in your faith.

00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:49.360
See, there are times as brethren, as brothers and sisters in Christ, that we can confide

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:54.440
in someone and we can have an accountability partner that can help us, that can help keep

00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:55.440
us.

00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:59.240
Hey listen, I've made this decision based upon the Word of God and I, with God's help

00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:04.320
and by God's grace, I intend to do this and man, would you pray for me and would you encourage

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:07.480
me and would you help me, would you hold me accountable?

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:12.160
You know, being accountable is much different than getting counsel.

00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:15.640
Getting counsel is basically having somebody answer your questions.

00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:20.680
Being accountable is you answering someone else's questions.

00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:22.960
Be accountable to someone.

00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:26.160
Maybe it's a husband, he needs to be accountable to a wife, a wife to a husband, maybe a child

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:30.120
to a parent, maybe just a brother to a brother in Christ.

00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:33.280
Hey listen, God's working in my heart.

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:39.120
It's not to make ourselves look good at some decision that we've made, but it's in humility,

00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:43.200
in understanding that we have an enemy that wants to attack and bring affliction and trouble

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:48.960
and trial and get us detoured from that decision that we made and we say, would you partner

00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:49.960
with me?

00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:56.080
Would you be this accountability partner to pray with me and to check up on me and to

00:35:56.080 --> 00:36:02.560
ensure that God is going to do what, that I'm going to do what I've committed to God

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:03.560
to do?

00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:08.000
It's not a bad thing to have an accountability partner.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.080
They can help establish us.

00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:17.440
They can help to perfect that which is lacking in our faith, requires humility to have an

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:23.080
accountability partner, but I believe that it's, I believe it's a good suggestion.

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:29.200
Again, the greatest key to a decision that endures is that it's based upon a biblical

00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:33.560
truth because God's Word is never going to change.

00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:41.320
That ought to cause us to rejoice, but maybe, maybe you've been down the road long enough

00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:48.720
in your Christian journey that you've made some decisions and they've just been short-lived.

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:54.600
It seems like at the next meeting, the next time you visit that passage of scripture that

00:36:54.600 --> 00:37:00.440
God works again in that same way and you're making that same decision again.

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:06.240
You say, what happened in the time in between, the months that passed?

00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:08.880
Why was that decision short-lived?

00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:10.300
What happened?

00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:14.720
If it was a good decision that was based upon the Word of God, maybe there's an opportunity

00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:21.840
for an accountability partner to help that, bridge that gap, to help see that thing endure.

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:24.080
Paul was concerned, but Paul was comforted.

00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:30.360
It's encouraging when you hear of others that continue, that allow God to have His

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:31.840
way in their lives.

00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:37.800
I hope that God would help us to have decisions that endure.

00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:38.800
Let's pray.

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:39.800
Father, we love you.

00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:41.840
We thank you for loving us.

00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:46.400
I thank you for the opportunity that we had last week to have revival meeting and I thank

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:49.400
you for the messages that we heard.

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:51.560
I thank you for how you worked in my heart and my life.

00:37:51.560 --> 00:38:01.400
I thank you for decisions that were made and though we do not know many of those decisions,

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:06.680
not public in nature, more private, I pray that those decisions have not been made out

00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:11.520
of emotion, but those decisions have been made based upon, founded upon the Word of

00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:14.960
God.

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:21.720
It's my prayer that decisions would not be short-lived, but decisions would endure.

00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:24.600
God I pray that you'd help us tonight.

00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:29.400
I pray that as we'd reflect back over the last week and even as we look forward in our

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:34.720
walk with you as we consider future decisions that will be made, God would you help us to

00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:41.120
make those decisions based upon biblical truth.

00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:46.160
Perhaps tonight there's some that need to seek out, prayerfully seek out an accountability

00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:53.800
partner, someone that can help them, humanly speaking.

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:54.800
Pray with them.

00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:55.800
Partner with them.

00:38:55.800 --> 00:39:01.160
Lord, I pray that you would move and work as only you can and we'll be careful to give

00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:02.160
you the glory.

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:03.160
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:03.160
