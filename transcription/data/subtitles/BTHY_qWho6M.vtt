00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.800
This morning, as we're here in Matthew chapter number 15, I want to examine an interaction

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:15.079
that takes place between a desperate mother and the Lord Jesus Christ during His earthly

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:16.079
ministry.

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:20.680
Obviously, as we read through the Gospel accounts, we have the privilege of reading about the

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.979
life and ministry of our wonderful Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:00:25.979 --> 00:00:31.020
Many times throughout the Gospel accounts, we have the privilege of seeing those interactions

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.979
that are captured in the ways in which the Lord ministered in individual families and

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:37.119
to individuals.

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:42.259
We find that there are many times in which He ministered to great multitudes of people.

00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:46.979
There are times in which the Gospel accounts record for us the interactions between the

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:52.060
Lord and the religious leaders, the scribes and the Pharisees and the Sadducees and all

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.060
of those interactions.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:59.020
And there's so much content that is given to us in the four Gospel records with regard

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.900
to the life and ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.559
And we find in the text of Scripture that we're looking at this morning that this particular

00:01:06.559 --> 00:01:11.300
interaction is recorded by Matthew and by Mark.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.779
And we'll look at both passages of Scripture this morning.

00:01:14.779 --> 00:01:19.760
Let me read for you the Matthew passage first, and we'll hold our spot here, and then look

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.220
over at the Mark passage.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.940
And I will let you know at the very beginning of the message that we will be going back

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.660
and forth between Matthew and Mark, so you will want to hold your place in each of those

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:36.940
locations so that you can quickly pass back and forth to look at the passage.

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.220
I will also mention this, the interaction that is recorded for us in these two passages

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:48.099
of Scripture is an interaction between a desperate mother and the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:54.459
So there's obviously going to be some application to mothers, in particular dealing with Mother's

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:55.459
Day.

00:01:55.459 --> 00:02:00.339
But we also find that the truth that is given in this passage of Scripture is truth that

00:02:00.339 --> 00:02:03.699
is applicable for every child of God.

00:02:03.699 --> 00:02:06.940
And I hope that it will be a blessing to you this morning.

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.500
Matthew chapter number 15, begin looking in verse number 21.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.500
The Bible says,

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.259
Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coast of Tyre and Sidon.

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:21.580
And behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coast, and cried unto him, saying,

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.259
Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son of David!

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:30.460
My daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.139
But he answered her not a word.

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:39.820
And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away, for she crieth after us.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.860
But he answered and said, I am not sent, but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.899
Then came she, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.

00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:54.139
But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:56.000
to dogs.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.619
And she said, Truth, Lord!

00:02:59.619 --> 00:03:03.820
Yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their master's table.

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:11.419
Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith!

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:15.059
Be it unto thee, even as thou wilt.

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:18.820
And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:23.619
Turn to the book of Mark, if you will, in chapter number 7.

00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:25.300
Mark chapter number 7.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.979
Look at verses 24 through 30.

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:28.979
Record the same interaction.

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:35.100
Of course, a few different details that are provided to us in Mark's gospel in chapter

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.660
7, beginning in verse number 24.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:42.779
The Bible says, And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon,

00:03:42.779 --> 00:03:48.740
and entered into a house, and would have no man know it, but he could not be hid.

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.979
Oh, there's a whole message that could be preached on that statement, but he could not

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:53.979
be hid.

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:58.339
It will not be the focus of our attention this morning, but what a powerful truth is

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:59.940
contained therein.

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:06.500
Verse 25, For a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him,

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.699
and came and fell at his feet.

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:13.179
The woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by nation, and she besought him that he would

00:04:13.179 --> 00:04:16.739
cast forth the devil out of her daughter.

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:22.980
But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled, for it is not me to take

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.380
the children's bread and to cast it unto the dogs.

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:33.299
And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord.

00:04:33.299 --> 00:04:36.859
Let the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs.

00:04:36.859 --> 00:04:44.299
And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way, The devil is gone out of thy daughter.

00:04:44.299 --> 00:04:51.660
She was come to her house, and found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.339
As you look at the passages of Scripture that are before us this morning, again, I mentioned

00:04:55.339 --> 00:05:00.380
that we'll go back and forth between the Matthew account and the Mark account, but you'll notice

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:06.619
that in Matthew chapter 15, that first passage that we read, in verse number 25, the Bible

00:05:06.619 --> 00:05:13.339
records for us, really, the level of desperation, as I mentioned, that this is a desperate mother.

00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:20.019
She says this in verse number 25, at the end of the verse, Lord, help me.

00:05:20.019 --> 00:05:24.500
That's the title for the message this morning, Lord, help me.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:29.019
I believe that as we look at the passage of Scripture, that perhaps, though I'm not a

00:05:29.019 --> 00:05:34.980
mother, obviously, I believe that many mothers could probably understand the times in which

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.279
they need help from the Lord.

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:41.980
With dealing with various responsibilities of being a mom, and all of those things that

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:46.220
go with it, there are times in which you need to depend upon the Lord, and I'm so thankful

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.799
that the Lord is our helper.

00:05:48.799 --> 00:05:53.660
Not only would we think about the truth of that statement with regard to moms, but we

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:58.899
understand as every child of God, what a blessing to know that my help cometh from the Lord,

00:05:58.899 --> 00:06:00.500
which made heaven and earth.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:07.179
What a blessing to know that we can boldly declare and say, the Lord is my helper.

00:06:07.179 --> 00:06:13.220
We find that she makes this declaration at the end of verse number 25, Lord, help me,

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:16.339
and we've used that for our title this morning.

00:06:16.339 --> 00:06:20.700
Just a few simple points this morning, but I want you to notice, first of all, with me,

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.779
notice what she recognized.

00:06:22.779 --> 00:06:27.140
As we look at this desperate mother, we begin to unfold the interaction that is recorded

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:32.019
by Matthew and by Mark, I believe that at the very beginning, we begin to notice what

00:06:32.019 --> 00:06:33.739
she recognized.

00:06:33.739 --> 00:06:37.980
We find that in Mark's account in chapter number seven and verse number 25, the Bible

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:42.500
gives us this insight when it says, for a certain woman whose young daughter had an

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:48.940
unclean spirit, notice these three words, heard of him.

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:49.940
Who's him?

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.260
That's Jesus.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:52.660
That's the Messiah.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:55.220
That's God in flesh.

00:06:55.299 --> 00:06:57.739
And we find that she heard of him.

00:06:57.739 --> 00:07:02.380
The thing that is interesting to understand as we look at this truth in verse number 25

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:08.100
is that we are informed of the truth that she heard of him, though we are not told how

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:09.500
she heard of him.

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:14.579
The Bible does not tell us how it was that she received word of the Messiah being in

00:07:14.579 --> 00:07:15.579
this location.

00:07:15.579 --> 00:07:20.019
You understand, even as I mentioned in verse number 24, that when he went to the borders

00:07:20.019 --> 00:07:23.820
of Tyre and Sidon, that he entered into a house, and the Bible says that he would have

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:27.420
no man know it, but he could not be hid.

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:34.299
And then the Bible tells us about this certain woman, and it tells us that she heard of him

00:07:34.299 --> 00:07:37.500
and came and fell at his feet.

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:42.380
We begin to understand that she heard, and we don't need to know.

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:49.500
God didn't choose to tell us how she heard of the master, but we can rejoice in understanding

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:52.140
that she heard of the master.

00:07:52.459 --> 00:07:57.779
Oh, what a great challenge to each of us this morning of being faithful to tell others about

00:07:57.779 --> 00:07:59.179
our wonderful Savior.

00:07:59.179 --> 00:08:05.220
We sing so often how that He's a wonderful Savior to me, and He is, and we rejoice in

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:09.859
His goodness and His mercy and all of His attributes, and the reality is that there's

00:08:09.859 --> 00:08:16.059
a world of hurting people that have simply never even heard of Him.

00:08:16.059 --> 00:08:18.579
And oh, how we need to be faithful.

00:08:18.579 --> 00:08:25.820
We were having conversation in recent days and discussing the blessedness of just all

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:31.540
that our Savior does for us, and just how we can have the peace of God which passeth

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:37.340
all understanding, and just His grace and His mercy and all of those things, and I'm

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:43.059
looking at the passage this morning, and I'm rejoicing that she heard of Him.

00:08:43.059 --> 00:08:51.219
We notice that this hearing of the master is important, but the reality is what she

00:08:51.219 --> 00:08:56.380
does with what she hears is of significant importance.

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:59.419
Oh, there were many that heard of Him.

00:08:59.419 --> 00:09:06.700
There were many that heard of Jesus, that heard of this one Messiah, but there were

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:12.820
some that responded and they went and they sought Him and they heard of Him.

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:17.460
There were others that dismissed it, and the reality today is that what we do with

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:20.260
what we've heard is of significant importance.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:24.099
In fact, through our study of the book of Hebrews, we've mentioned that a number of

00:09:24.099 --> 00:09:30.219
times in recent weeks with regard to the warning passages that are given to us about the importance

00:09:30.219 --> 00:09:35.659
of hearing and doing and the importance of being a doer of the Word.

00:09:35.659 --> 00:09:39.780
But we find that she heard of Him, and I want you to notice what she recognized.

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:40.780
Notice this.

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:46.659
I believe first it's clear to us through both of these passages of Scripture that she recognized

00:09:46.659 --> 00:09:52.260
that Jesus is the Christ, that He is the Messiah.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.219
Now that's important for us to understand at the very beginning of the message this

00:09:55.219 --> 00:10:00.099
morning because what she recognized will have a...

00:10:00.099 --> 00:10:05.519
major impact and influence on how she will behave. And we find that she

00:10:05.519 --> 00:10:11.259
recognized that he's God in flesh. She recognized that he is the Messiah.

00:10:11.259 --> 00:10:17.039
Notice back in the Matthew passage in chapter 15 and verse number 22 as she

00:10:17.039 --> 00:10:22.499
first comes, notice now we understand that this is a Gentile. This is not a

00:10:22.499 --> 00:10:27.819
Jewish woman. She's a Gentile, a Greek, a Syrophoenician, the Bible tells us in

00:10:27.819 --> 00:10:33.179
Mark's Gospel. And we find that she comes and notice what she says in verse

00:10:33.179 --> 00:10:41.379
number 22, have mercy on me. Notice these words, O Lord, thou son of David. She had

00:10:41.379 --> 00:10:45.339
heard some truth. She had heard some prophecy from the Old Testament, the

00:10:45.339 --> 00:10:49.559
fulfillment of that prophecy in the person of Jesus Christ. And she

00:10:49.559 --> 00:10:54.019
understood that he was the Messiah. You understand that this truth, O Lord, thou

00:10:54.019 --> 00:10:59.699
son of David, that is a Jewish approach that one would have to the Lord, the

00:10:59.699 --> 00:11:06.559
Messiah. But she is a Greek. She comes to the Lord Jesus Christ understanding, even

00:11:06.559 --> 00:11:13.479
by the way that she referred to him, that he is the Messiah. In fact, as we look at

00:11:13.479 --> 00:11:18.639
the passage of Scripture, we find that on three occasions in Matthew's account, the

00:11:18.639 --> 00:11:27.959
Bible records where she calls him Lord. We find that there in verse number 25 of

00:11:27.959 --> 00:11:33.479
our passage of Scripture, excuse me, in verse number 22, she says, O Lord, thou son

00:11:33.479 --> 00:11:39.639
of David. Notice in verse number 25, Lord, help me. Notice again in verse number 27,

00:11:39.639 --> 00:11:46.039
she said, truth, Lord. And we find that she's recognizing through the statement

00:11:46.039 --> 00:11:50.559
and through how she would refer to the Lord Jesus Christ, that he is the Lord,

00:11:50.559 --> 00:11:56.439
that he is Messiah. We find that the Apostle Paul dealt with this subject as

00:11:56.439 --> 00:12:01.359
he was preaching, and we often have made reference to the messages that God gives

00:12:01.359 --> 00:12:05.559
us in the book of Acts. And we find that when the Apostle Paul went to Thessalonica

00:12:05.559 --> 00:12:10.759
in Acts chapter number 17, the Bible tells us that he first went into the

00:12:10.759 --> 00:12:15.799
synagogue. This was his manner. This was his typical approach as he went to

00:12:15.799 --> 00:12:21.519
the cities that God would allow him to minister in. The Bible tells us that when

00:12:21.519 --> 00:12:26.039
he arrived in Thessalonica that there was a synagogue of the Jews, and Paul, as

00:12:26.039 --> 00:12:30.959
his manner was in verse 2 of Acts 17, says that he went in unto them and three

00:12:30.959 --> 00:12:35.839
Sabbath days reasoned with them out of the Scriptures. Notice in verse number

00:12:35.839 --> 00:12:41.679
3 of Acts 17, opening and alleging that Christ must needs have suffered and

00:12:41.679 --> 00:12:49.839
risen again from the dead, and that this Jesus whom I preach unto you is Christ.

00:12:49.839 --> 00:12:56.599
Why is it that the Apostle Paul used the words, the names, of Christ that he did

00:12:56.599 --> 00:13:02.239
in the manner in which he did? We find that he's there in the synagogue, and

00:13:02.239 --> 00:13:08.919
Jesus, the name of Jesus, that name gives us the understanding that Jehovah is

00:13:08.919 --> 00:13:15.479
salvation, that God incarnate. These individuals, many of them, of course, they

00:13:15.479 --> 00:13:20.639
would have had a knowledge of the person Jesus. They would have known this

00:13:20.639 --> 00:13:25.999
historical figure, this one who we're reading about his life and ministry in

00:13:25.999 --> 00:13:30.079
these gospel accounts here this morning, and they would have had a certain

00:13:30.079 --> 00:13:36.519
awareness and knowledge of Jesus, but notice he says, this Jesus whom I preach

00:13:36.639 --> 00:13:46.239
unto you is Christ. The name Christ means the Anointed One, the Messiah, the Son of

00:13:46.239 --> 00:13:51.279
God. And so what was Paul doing there in Thessalonica is he was connecting the

00:13:51.279 --> 00:13:55.559
points, and he says in the Old Testament there were some prophecies with regard

00:13:55.559 --> 00:14:01.199
to the Messiah. This one Jesus that you're aware of, that you know, the one

00:14:01.199 --> 00:14:06.079
who lived a sinless perfect life, the one who went to the cross of Calvary, he was

00:14:06.119 --> 00:14:13.039
buried and he rose in victory, he, that Jesus, he is the Christ. He's the Messiah.

00:14:13.039 --> 00:14:18.439
He's the fulfillment. We find in Philippians chapter number 2 in verses

00:14:18.439 --> 00:14:25.399
9 through 11 that the Bible gives us a wonderful truth with regard to the name

00:14:25.399 --> 00:14:30.319
of Jesus. The Bible says there in Philippians 2 in verse 9 that the name

00:14:30.319 --> 00:14:38.919
of Jesus every knee, every knee should bow of things in heaven, things in earth,

00:14:38.919 --> 00:14:45.679
and things under the earth, and that every tongue, every tongue should confess

00:14:45.679 --> 00:14:52.479
that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.

00:14:52.479 --> 00:14:58.039
Remember when the Apostle Paul, his name was Saul at the time of his conversion

00:14:58.039 --> 00:15:06.439
in Acts chapter 9, who art thou Lord? And then he says, Lord what wilt thou have

00:15:06.439 --> 00:15:15.559
me to do? We find for this desperate mother in this interaction between her

00:15:15.559 --> 00:15:20.839
and the Lord Jesus Christ, we find what she recognized first, that that Jesus is

00:15:20.839 --> 00:15:26.839
the Christ, that he is the Messiah. Notice next that she recognized that he was

00:15:26.839 --> 00:15:32.559
worthy of worship. She recognized that he was worthy of worship. Back in the

00:15:32.559 --> 00:15:37.599
account that Matthew gives us in chapter 15 in verse number 25, the Bible says,

00:15:37.599 --> 00:15:45.519
Then came she, notice, and worshipped him, saying, Lord help me. He is

00:15:45.519 --> 00:15:51.479
worthy of our worship. We ought to worship the Lord. We seek to worship him

00:15:51.479 --> 00:15:55.359
even here this morning. We've worshipped him through our singing and through our

00:15:55.359 --> 00:16:00.199
giving, and now as we open up the Scriptures, we seek to exalt and

00:16:00.199 --> 00:16:04.519
magnify our wonderful Savior and to worship him, understanding that he is

00:16:04.519 --> 00:16:09.879
worthy of worship. I believe that as Mark would tell us in the end of chapter, or

00:16:09.879 --> 00:16:14.119
the end of verse number 25 in his account, when it says that she heard

00:16:14.119 --> 00:16:20.639
of him and came and fell at his feet. It doesn't use the terminology that she

00:16:20.639 --> 00:16:25.799
worshipped, but we find that she did indeed worship the Lord, and in that

00:16:25.799 --> 00:16:30.159
position of falling to her feet, we find that many throughout the Scriptures, when

00:16:30.159 --> 00:16:35.399
they would worship, they would be fallen at the feet of the Lord. I want you to

00:16:35.399 --> 00:16:39.119
understand, even as we were preaching through the book of Hebrews, that Jesus

00:16:39.119 --> 00:16:44.519
is God, and that's why he accepts worship. We had spoken about the fact that Christ

00:16:44.519 --> 00:16:49.799
is superior than the angels, and we spent time in Hebrews 1 and 2 dealing with and

00:16:49.799 --> 00:16:55.239
developing and proving that truth from the Word of God, and understanding the

00:16:55.239 --> 00:17:01.319
distinction between angels and the Lord Jesus Christ, and we made one of those

00:17:01.319 --> 00:17:08.759
points that the angels worship, but that Jesus himself is worshipped. Why? Because

00:17:08.759 --> 00:17:15.239
he's God. If he were not God, he would not have permitted this woman to worship him.

00:17:15.359 --> 00:17:21.639
No doubt. The angel didn't let John worship him. The angel said, no, no, no.

00:17:21.639 --> 00:17:29.559
Worship God. John the Baptist was quick to say, I'm not he, right? They wanted to

00:17:29.559 --> 00:17:36.799
know, are you the one? No, I'm not. We find that she recognized, number one, that

00:17:36.799 --> 00:17:41.079
Jesus is the Christ, number two, that he is worthy of worship, number three, I

00:17:41.159 --> 00:17:49.119
believe that she recognized that he has all power. He has all power. Indeed, he is

00:17:49.119 --> 00:17:53.999
the Lord God omnipotent. He says at the end of chapter Matthew, in chapter number

00:17:53.999 --> 00:18:00.199
28, after his ascension, yeah, after his resurrection and before his ascension, we

00:18:00.199 --> 00:18:05.399
find that he made this declaration as he was giving the disciples the great

00:18:05.399 --> 00:18:13.199
commission, all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. I believe that

00:18:13.199 --> 00:18:19.319
this desperate mother that had this interaction with the Lord Jesus Christ, I

00:18:19.319 --> 00:18:23.719
believe that she recognized at least these three things. Number one, that he is

00:18:23.719 --> 00:18:28.639
the Christ. This morning, have you recognized that? Not just for the mothers,

00:18:28.639 --> 00:18:35.039
but for everyone. Have we recognized that Jesus is in fact God in flesh, that he is

00:18:35.039 --> 00:18:41.039
the Messiah, he's the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecy, that he is God?

00:18:41.039 --> 00:18:46.880
Have we recognized that he's worthy of worship? Do we worship him? In John

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:53.599
chapter 4, we find that we're to worship him in spirit and in truth. Have you

00:18:53.599 --> 00:18:58.039
recognized this morning that he has all power? See, as we notice what she

00:18:58.039 --> 00:19:01.599
recognized, it brings us to our second thought this morning. I want you to

00:19:01.599 --> 00:19:06.319
notice what she requested. What she requested. I've mentioned a couple of

00:19:06.319 --> 00:19:10.319
times already this morning that this was a desperate mother. We find that her

00:19:10.319 --> 00:19:15.399
reason for being desperate was that her daughter was grievously vexed with a

00:19:15.399 --> 00:19:23.880
devil. I can't even imagine the desperation of this woman. The Bible says

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:28.919
that she says in verse number 22, my daughter is grievously vexed with a

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:34.959
devil. In Mark's account in chapter number 7, we find that the Bible tells us in

00:19:34.959 --> 00:19:39.440
verse number 26 that she was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by nation, and she

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:46.559
besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter. We're told

00:19:46.559 --> 00:19:50.599
in verse number 25 that it was a young daughter. We're not told the age of this

00:19:50.599 --> 00:19:55.199
daughter. We're not told the age of the woman that comes. But the Bible tells us

00:19:55.199 --> 00:19:58.159
that it was a young daughter, and the Bible tells us that she was grievously

00:19:58.159 --> 00:20:02.319
vexed with a devil.

00:20:02.319 --> 00:20:05.239
thus leading to this woman's desperation.

00:20:05.239 --> 00:20:09.199
When we understand what she recognized about Jesus,

00:20:09.199 --> 00:20:15.579
we will understand that it is the basis for what she requests.

00:20:15.579 --> 00:20:17.419
We noticed what she's recognized.

00:20:17.419 --> 00:20:19.739
Now, notice what she requested.

00:20:19.739 --> 00:20:23.659
By the way, if she did not recognize that He was Lord

00:20:23.659 --> 00:20:28.579
and that He was worthy of worship and that He was all-powerful,

00:20:28.579 --> 00:20:32.779
there's no reason that she would make the request that she makes.

00:20:32.779 --> 00:20:35.719
But because she understood,

00:20:35.719 --> 00:20:37.619
just because she heard of Him,

00:20:37.619 --> 00:20:40.439
she goes and she understood some things,

00:20:40.439 --> 00:20:42.099
she recognized some things,

00:20:42.099 --> 00:20:43.819
and therefore she comes,

00:20:43.819 --> 00:20:46.419
and knowing that He's God in flesh

00:20:46.419 --> 00:20:48.999
and knowing that He has all-power,

00:20:48.999 --> 00:20:55.059
she comes with a passionate plea for deliverance.

00:20:55.059 --> 00:20:57.479
Lord, help me.

00:20:57.479 --> 00:21:02.699
We've mentioned that there as our title in Matthew 15 and verse 25.

00:21:02.699 --> 00:21:06.359
I believe that as we would look at the passage of Scripture

00:21:06.359 --> 00:21:08.099
and notice what she requested,

00:21:08.099 --> 00:21:13.719
that she had faith, she believed that God was able.

00:21:13.719 --> 00:21:18.499
I don't think there was any part of her that had any doubt whatsoever

00:21:18.499 --> 00:21:23.299
that Jesus was able to fulfill her request.

00:21:23.299 --> 00:21:25.239
She believed.

00:21:25.239 --> 00:21:27.559
She recognized that He was God.

00:21:27.559 --> 00:21:29.359
She recognized He was worthy of worship.

00:21:29.359 --> 00:21:31.519
She recognized that He had all-power,

00:21:31.519 --> 00:21:34.619
and therefore, based upon her recognition,

00:21:34.619 --> 00:21:37.499
she then goes and she makes this request,

00:21:37.499 --> 00:21:41.639
Lord, I know You can do something about this.

00:21:41.639 --> 00:21:44.519
There's no one else to go to.

00:21:44.519 --> 00:21:48.459
See, this morning, in your life and in my life,

00:21:48.459 --> 00:21:51.279
what we recognize about our Savior

00:21:51.279 --> 00:21:56.419
will have a great impact and influence on what we request from our Savior.

00:21:56.419 --> 00:22:00.059
See, the reality is that a missionary of yesteryear,

00:22:00.059 --> 00:22:04.139
he said that we're to expect great things from God.

00:22:04.139 --> 00:22:06.639
We're to attempt great things for God.

00:22:06.639 --> 00:22:11.659
The reality is that we can read various accounts of those that have gone before us

00:22:11.659 --> 00:22:13.299
and we can see their prayers,

00:22:13.299 --> 00:22:16.859
and we can see how God answered and how God worked.

00:22:16.859 --> 00:22:19.439
Our God is able.

00:22:19.619 --> 00:22:26.419
We find that this woman, she was specific and she was persistent.

00:22:26.419 --> 00:22:30.919
In fact, her persistence, because the Lord Jesus Christ answered her not a word,

00:22:30.919 --> 00:22:33.539
according to Matthew 15 and verse 23,

00:22:33.539 --> 00:22:36.059
the disciples, they besought Him and said,

00:22:36.059 --> 00:22:39.539
send her away for she crieth after us.

00:22:39.539 --> 00:22:41.239
She was persistent.

00:22:41.239 --> 00:22:43.919
What caused her to be persistent?

00:22:43.919 --> 00:22:45.659
What she recognized.

00:22:45.659 --> 00:22:47.639
She was desperate. She needed help.

00:22:47.639 --> 00:22:50.319
And she knew that Jesus was the One.

00:22:50.319 --> 00:22:53.799
She knew that He could do something.

00:22:53.799 --> 00:22:56.839
And as we think about the interaction that takes place,

00:22:56.839 --> 00:23:01.039
I'll mention this and not the main focus of our message this morning,

00:23:01.039 --> 00:23:02.999
but certainly important to point out,

00:23:02.999 --> 00:23:07.839
when we understand the interaction between this woman and the Lord Jesus Christ

00:23:07.839 --> 00:23:10.559
and how that He answered her not a word initially

00:23:10.559 --> 00:23:11.639
and then said to her,

00:23:11.639 --> 00:23:15.119
I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel,

00:23:15.119 --> 00:23:18.399
and then said it is not meant to take the children's bread

00:23:18.399 --> 00:23:20.479
and to cast it to dogs.

00:23:20.479 --> 00:23:24.839
We'd understand that what the Lord is dealing with here in the text of Scripture,

00:23:24.839 --> 00:23:29.039
both in Matthew and Mark as He's revealing to us the truth that we've often said,

00:23:29.039 --> 00:23:34.519
as Paul would declare that the Gospel to the Jew first and also to the Greek.

00:23:34.519 --> 00:23:40.319
And we find that Jesus came first to the Jews, to Israel, to the household of Israel.

00:23:40.319 --> 00:23:44.119
And we understand that in the plan of God because He's omniscient,

00:23:44.119 --> 00:23:47.199
He's Alpha and Omega, He's eternal, He knows all things,

00:23:47.199 --> 00:23:50.079
that as Paul would deal with in the book of Romans,

00:23:50.079 --> 00:23:52.919
that the Gentiles were graft in.

00:23:52.919 --> 00:23:59.439
We understand that the nation of Israel rejected the Lord Jesus Christ as being Messiah.

00:23:59.439 --> 00:24:05.079
And we find that Jesus is dealing with that very truth here in Matthew and Mark.

00:24:05.079 --> 00:24:07.879
It's interesting if you look in John chapter number 10,

00:24:07.879 --> 00:24:09.759
I'll just make quick reference to it,

00:24:09.759 --> 00:24:11.399
but in John chapter number 10,

00:24:11.399 --> 00:24:15.719
when we deal with the passage of Scripture that deals with the Lord being our shepherd,

00:24:15.719 --> 00:24:20.719
that He is the good shepherd and as the good shepherd He giveth His life for the sheep.

00:24:20.719 --> 00:24:25.719
You'll know in verse number 1 of John 10 that Jesus says,

00:24:25.719 --> 00:24:27.719
Verily, verily, I say unto you,

00:24:27.719 --> 00:24:33.439
He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way,

00:24:33.439 --> 00:24:34.999
the same as a thief and a robber,

00:24:34.999 --> 00:24:38.159
but he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.

00:24:38.159 --> 00:24:39.159
Notice in verse 3,

00:24:39.159 --> 00:24:41.959
Unto him the porter openeth, and the sheep hear his voice,

00:24:41.959 --> 00:24:45.679
and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.

00:24:45.679 --> 00:24:49.119
And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them.

00:24:49.119 --> 00:24:50.719
The sheep follow them, why?

00:24:50.719 --> 00:24:52.399
For they know his voice.

00:24:52.399 --> 00:24:55.759
And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him,

00:24:55.759 --> 00:25:00.399
for they know not the voice of a stranger, or of strangers, excuse me.

00:25:00.399 --> 00:25:03.679
Now skip down and look at verse number 16.

00:25:03.679 --> 00:25:04.679
The Lord says this,

00:25:04.679 --> 00:25:10.759
And other sheep have I, or I have, which are not of this fold,

00:25:10.759 --> 00:25:13.999
them also must I bring, and they shall hear my voice,

00:25:13.999 --> 00:25:18.559
and there shall be one fold and one shepherd.

00:25:18.559 --> 00:25:20.559
In John 10, verses 1 through 5,

00:25:20.559 --> 00:25:23.719
he's speaking about the nation of Israel, the sheep there.

00:25:23.719 --> 00:25:27.079
And then when he talks about the other sheep I have in verse number 16,

00:25:27.079 --> 00:25:29.079
he's speaking about Gentiles.

00:25:29.079 --> 00:25:30.759
And we know the mystery of the church.

00:25:30.759 --> 00:25:34.159
Remember, as we studied the book of Ephesians last year,

00:25:34.159 --> 00:25:36.519
Paul would talk about the mystery.

00:25:36.519 --> 00:25:42.719
And that mystery of the church is how the church is made up of Jews and Gentiles.

00:25:42.719 --> 00:25:44.119
And what a blessing.

00:25:44.119 --> 00:25:48.159
We understand that the church is not spiritual Israel.

00:25:48.159 --> 00:25:50.799
It's an entity in of itself.

00:25:50.799 --> 00:25:55.199
And God said, the Lord Jesus Christ said that he would build his church.

00:25:55.199 --> 00:25:57.159
The gates of hell shall not prevail against it.

00:25:57.159 --> 00:26:01.559
So it's important to just kind of know that dialogue that's going back and forth

00:26:01.559 --> 00:26:05.879
between this desperate mother and the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:26:05.879 --> 00:26:11.919
He's giving instruction with regard to he first came to the house of Israel,

00:26:11.919 --> 00:26:15.039
and she, of course, as being a Gentile,

00:26:15.039 --> 00:26:17.399
most of, many of, I should say,

00:26:17.399 --> 00:26:23.439
the Gentile nations were often referred to as dogs from the Jewish people.

00:26:23.439 --> 00:26:26.919
And that's the reason for the terminology that is used.

00:26:26.919 --> 00:26:29.279
She understood that, by the way.

00:26:29.319 --> 00:26:31.679
She was responded and she said,

00:26:31.679 --> 00:26:35.199
truth, Lord, yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their master's table.

00:26:35.199 --> 00:26:42.359
And dealing with a physical illustration as well as the spiritual that the Lord is giving.

00:26:42.359 --> 00:26:44.999
But as we go back to what she requested,

00:26:44.999 --> 00:26:51.159
we understand this truth this morning that belief impacts behavior.

00:26:51.159 --> 00:26:52.879
Belief impacts behavior.

00:26:52.879 --> 00:26:58.359
What you believe to be true about God is evidence through your behavior.

00:26:58.359 --> 00:27:02.239
As mothers, as we think about this desperate mother,

00:27:02.239 --> 00:27:06.599
but really not just for mothers, for all of us this morning,

00:27:06.599 --> 00:27:11.679
what we request from our God reveals to us what we really believe about our God.

00:27:11.679 --> 00:27:16.319
Do we really believe that he's able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think?

00:27:16.319 --> 00:27:18.839
If we were to have our prayers,

00:27:18.839 --> 00:27:23.439
if we were to have the prayers that we prayed in this last week,

00:27:23.439 --> 00:27:26.439
that they had been recorded and played back to us,

00:27:26.439 --> 00:27:33.119
what would our prayers reveal to us about what we believe about God?

00:27:33.119 --> 00:27:36.319
What is it that we've requested that would prove

00:27:36.319 --> 00:27:39.959
that we believe that our God is the Lord God Omnipotent?

00:27:39.959 --> 00:27:46.839
To believe that He is able to answer and to show us great and mighty things which we know not.

00:27:46.839 --> 00:27:48.239
I wonder this morning.

00:27:48.239 --> 00:27:50.759
See, when we look at what she requested,

00:27:50.759 --> 00:27:53.999
it's born out of what she recognized.

00:27:53.999 --> 00:27:57.759
I'm so thankful that our God is the Lord God Almighty.

00:27:57.759 --> 00:28:02.039
I'm so thankful this morning that our God is a very present help

00:28:02.039 --> 00:28:04.199
as we see that she comes and says,

00:28:04.199 --> 00:28:06.959
Lord, help me. He's able to help.

00:28:06.959 --> 00:28:09.399
I don't know what your situation is today.

00:28:09.399 --> 00:28:12.239
I don't know what circumstance you're dealing with today,

00:28:12.239 --> 00:28:15.959
but I know this, God is able.

00:28:15.959 --> 00:28:17.439
He's able.

00:28:17.439 --> 00:28:19.599
He is a very present help.

00:28:19.599 --> 00:28:21.999
He has the answers.

00:28:21.999 --> 00:28:25.479
Listen, we're living through this global pandemic

00:28:25.479 --> 00:28:27.479
and there's all sorts of things that are going on.

00:28:27.479 --> 00:28:30.159
And if you pay attention to some things that are out there,

00:28:30.159 --> 00:28:35.519
you find that there's an increase of some very disturbing trends

00:28:35.519 --> 00:28:40.119
of socio-type of things that are going on in our society.

00:28:40.119 --> 00:28:48.959
As you begin to look at those things, you find that Jesus is the answer.

00:28:49.079 --> 00:28:53.679
Her daughter was grievously vexed with the devil.

00:28:53.679 --> 00:28:56.839
She said, only Jesus can help.

00:28:56.839 --> 00:28:58.719
Why? Because He's greater.

00:28:58.719 --> 00:29:01.159
He's greater.

00:29:01.159 --> 00:29:04.919
Maybe there's a mom that says,

00:29:04.919 --> 00:29:07.679
I'm having some difficulties with a child.

00:29:07.679 --> 00:29:11.559
Not that they're grievously vexed with the devil,

00:29:11.559 --> 00:29:15.199
but they're having some challenges, some difficulties.

00:29:15.199 --> 00:29:17.039
Whatever those difficulties might be,

00:29:17.039 --> 00:29:20.399
can I tell you that Jesus can help?

00:29:20.399 --> 00:29:25.439
Oh, it's fine and good to seek counsel,

00:29:25.439 --> 00:29:29.959
talk to other mothers about their experiences.

00:29:29.959 --> 00:29:31.679
It's fine to read books.

00:29:31.679 --> 00:29:34.319
There's some really good books that are out there.

00:29:34.319 --> 00:29:39.839
But can I tell you that none of that will help like Jesus will?

00:29:39.839 --> 00:29:41.999
See, when we go to God in prayer,

00:29:41.999 --> 00:29:45.519
and God is able to work in the heart of that child,

00:29:45.519 --> 00:29:47.839
and God is able to work through those circumstances,

00:29:47.839 --> 00:29:50.959
He's able to do what we cannot do.

00:29:50.959 --> 00:29:53.039
Sometimes we get so frustrated. Why?

00:29:53.039 --> 00:29:59.919
Because we're trying to fix something that only God can fix.

00:29:59.919 --> 00:30:02.399
And how it reveals to us our dependence.

00:30:02.399 --> 00:30:04.799
dependence on Him.

00:30:04.799 --> 00:30:06.939
See, that's a humbling thing.

00:30:06.939 --> 00:30:08.039
Because many times we think,

00:30:08.039 --> 00:30:09.799
man, I can do this.

00:30:09.799 --> 00:30:12.719
I want to be able to fix this situation.

00:30:12.719 --> 00:30:15.719
No, no, Lord, I need Your help.

00:30:15.719 --> 00:30:17.339
Lord, I'm doing the best I can do,

00:30:17.339 --> 00:30:19.119
but God, would You work and do

00:30:19.119 --> 00:30:21.679
what only You can do?

00:30:21.679 --> 00:30:23.559
See, we don't want just an outward

00:30:23.559 --> 00:30:25.819
form of compliance.

00:30:25.819 --> 00:30:28.619
We want a heart that is conformed

00:30:28.619 --> 00:30:30.499
to the image of Christ.

00:30:30.499 --> 00:30:32.859
A life that is seeking to serve

00:30:32.859 --> 00:30:36.199
the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:30:36.199 --> 00:30:37.439
I remember hearing that story,

00:30:37.439 --> 00:30:39.439
and I doubt that it's true,

00:30:39.439 --> 00:30:41.239
though some have said the story

00:30:41.239 --> 00:30:43.119
as if it were true.

00:30:43.119 --> 00:30:45.179
Maybe it is. I don't know.

00:30:45.179 --> 00:30:46.879
But there's a story about a little girl

00:30:46.879 --> 00:30:49.819
that was told to have a seat,

00:30:49.819 --> 00:30:51.119
and she wouldn't have a seat.

00:30:51.119 --> 00:30:52.899
And defiant, she's not going to sit down.

00:30:52.899 --> 00:30:54.119
She's not going to sit down.

00:30:54.119 --> 00:30:57.359
And through a struggle that ensued,

00:30:57.359 --> 00:30:59.919
we find that eventually,

00:30:59.919 --> 00:31:02.319
the parent was victorious

00:31:02.319 --> 00:31:05.319
and the child finally sat down.

00:31:05.319 --> 00:31:07.459
And then said, I'm sitting on the outside,

00:31:07.459 --> 00:31:10.379
but on the inside, I'm standing up.

00:31:10.379 --> 00:31:12.979
That's not what we're looking for.

00:31:12.979 --> 00:31:14.619
We're not just looking for a matter

00:31:14.619 --> 00:31:16.779
of conformance.

00:31:16.779 --> 00:31:18.919
We're looking for a changed heart.

00:31:18.919 --> 00:31:21.839
And only Jesus can change a heart.

00:31:21.839 --> 00:31:25.279
Only Jesus could cause this devil

00:31:25.279 --> 00:31:26.559
that had vexed this girl.

00:31:26.559 --> 00:31:28.439
This girl was demon-possessed,

00:31:28.439 --> 00:31:31.519
and because Jesus is God,

00:31:31.519 --> 00:31:36.459
He could cause that devil to be departed.

00:31:36.459 --> 00:31:39.139
He's the only one.

00:31:39.139 --> 00:31:42.779
We find what she recognized.

00:31:42.779 --> 00:31:44.779
Number two, what she requested.

00:31:44.779 --> 00:31:46.459
Notice finally with me this morning

00:31:46.459 --> 00:31:49.939
what she received.

00:31:49.939 --> 00:31:51.699
Look at Matthew.

00:31:51.699 --> 00:31:53.079
Actually, turn to Mark.

00:31:53.079 --> 00:31:54.699
I want to look at what Mark says

00:31:54.699 --> 00:32:00.099
in Matthew 7, verses 29 and 30.

00:32:00.099 --> 00:32:03.139
Notice the Bible says this in Mark 7,

00:32:03.139 --> 00:32:04.199
verse 29,

00:32:04.199 --> 00:32:07.139
"...and He said unto her,

00:32:07.139 --> 00:32:10.379
for this saying, go thy way."

00:32:10.379 --> 00:32:12.539
Notice this phrase.

00:32:12.539 --> 00:32:17.879
The devil is gone out of thy daughter.

00:32:17.879 --> 00:32:19.219
You know what she received?

00:32:19.219 --> 00:32:22.839
She received a promise of deliverance.

00:32:22.859 --> 00:32:25.439
She received the Word of God.

00:32:25.439 --> 00:32:28.639
She received the promise from God in flesh.

00:32:28.639 --> 00:32:30.219
And she had this interaction

00:32:30.219 --> 00:32:31.479
with the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:32:31.479 --> 00:32:33.759
This is an account that actually happened

00:32:33.759 --> 00:32:35.379
during his life in ministry.

00:32:35.379 --> 00:32:37.739
He went to this place to tire and sight in,

00:32:37.739 --> 00:32:40.219
and this desperate mother heard of Him

00:32:40.219 --> 00:32:42.759
and sought Him and fell at His feet,

00:32:42.759 --> 00:32:44.859
and she recognized who He was

00:32:44.859 --> 00:32:46.539
and what power He possessed

00:32:46.539 --> 00:32:48.279
and that He was worthy of worship.

00:32:48.279 --> 00:32:50.119
And she said, Lord, help me.

00:32:50.119 --> 00:32:52.059
And the situation is known

00:32:52.079 --> 00:32:54.119
that her daughter is grievously vexed

00:32:54.119 --> 00:32:56.339
with a devil,

00:32:56.339 --> 00:32:58.839
and we find that Jesus says,

00:32:58.839 --> 00:33:02.959
for this thy saying, go thy way.

00:33:02.959 --> 00:33:07.379
The devil is gone out of thy daughter.

00:33:07.379 --> 00:33:09.359
Isn't that a blessed truth?

00:33:09.359 --> 00:33:10.659
I mean, can you imagine?

00:33:10.659 --> 00:33:13.639
Put yourself within the context of this account.

00:33:13.639 --> 00:33:16.859
Can you imagine the level of desperation

00:33:16.859 --> 00:33:17.939
of this mother?

00:33:17.939 --> 00:33:19.739
It's hard for us to fathom,

00:33:19.739 --> 00:33:22.679
but beyond any human comprehension

00:33:22.679 --> 00:33:24.179
of what she was dealing with

00:33:24.179 --> 00:33:27.179
and the severity of the situation,

00:33:27.179 --> 00:33:28.879
and she comes to the Lord

00:33:28.879 --> 00:33:31.299
and she's specific and she's persistent.

00:33:31.299 --> 00:33:32.779
She says, Lord, help me.

00:33:32.779 --> 00:33:36.219
And Jesus says,

00:33:36.219 --> 00:33:39.019
the devil is gone out of thy daughter.

00:33:39.019 --> 00:33:42.999
Oh man, I can't imagine how she must have felt.

00:33:42.999 --> 00:33:45.419
I can't imagine the joy that swelled up

00:33:45.419 --> 00:33:47.679
within the emotions of this woman

00:33:47.679 --> 00:33:52.399
in rejoicing at the promise of deliverance.

00:33:52.399 --> 00:33:54.199
The fact that this Messiah,

00:33:54.199 --> 00:33:56.759
that Jesus, He said,

00:33:56.759 --> 00:33:59.799
the devil is gone out of thy daughter.

00:33:59.799 --> 00:34:01.839
Over in Matthew's account,

00:34:01.839 --> 00:34:04.799
we find that the Bible told us there,

00:34:04.799 --> 00:34:06.879
O woman, great is thy faith.

00:34:06.879 --> 00:34:11.959
Notice, be it unto thee even as thou wilt.

00:34:11.959 --> 00:34:16.999
Be it unto thee even as thou wilt.

00:34:16.999 --> 00:34:19.359
We find that there was a promise of deliverance.

00:34:19.359 --> 00:34:22.159
Can I tell you the promise of deliverance

00:34:22.159 --> 00:34:25.079
is followed up by a restored daughter.

00:34:25.079 --> 00:34:26.699
In verse 30, notice it says,

00:34:26.699 --> 00:34:29.759
and when she was come to her house,

00:34:29.759 --> 00:34:32.319
I'm not sure the distance

00:34:32.319 --> 00:34:34.759
of how far she traveled.

00:34:34.759 --> 00:34:37.799
In my mind's eye, in my sanctified imagination,

00:34:37.799 --> 00:34:42.239
I believe that she probably went in haste.

00:34:42.239 --> 00:34:45.439
I believe that she went to this place Tyre and Sidon

00:34:45.439 --> 00:34:47.159
as Jesus entered into this house

00:34:47.159 --> 00:34:48.959
and as she had heard of Him and came,

00:34:48.959 --> 00:34:50.799
I believe that she left her house

00:34:50.799 --> 00:34:53.119
and went in haste to see the Savior.

00:34:53.119 --> 00:34:54.439
I mean, this was an urgent matter.

00:34:54.439 --> 00:34:57.559
It was a pressing thing.

00:34:57.559 --> 00:35:02.599
And I believe that she returned to her house in haste.

00:35:02.599 --> 00:35:06.159
I mean, she was claiming the promise of God.

00:35:06.159 --> 00:35:08.279
She was holding on to the very words

00:35:08.279 --> 00:35:10.559
that God had spoken to her.

00:35:10.559 --> 00:35:13.559
The devil is gone out of thy daughter.

00:35:13.639 --> 00:35:17.199
The Bible says that she returned to her house

00:35:17.199 --> 00:35:18.999
when she was come to her house.

00:35:18.999 --> 00:35:22.959
She found the devil gone out

00:35:22.959 --> 00:35:26.719
and her daughter laid upon the bed.

00:35:26.719 --> 00:35:28.359
Matthew says this,

00:35:28.359 --> 00:35:30.319
and her daughter was made whole,

00:35:30.319 --> 00:35:32.279
notice this phrase,

00:35:32.279 --> 00:35:36.079
from that very hour.

00:35:36.079 --> 00:35:37.679
Can you imagine?

00:35:37.679 --> 00:35:40.719
The joy, the rejoicing

00:35:40.719 --> 00:35:42.119
that must have taken place

00:35:42.159 --> 00:35:44.239
when we understand what she received.

00:35:44.239 --> 00:35:46.399
And she had received exactly what it was

00:35:46.399 --> 00:35:47.799
that she requested.

00:35:47.799 --> 00:35:51.119
And we find that this desperate mother,

00:35:51.119 --> 00:35:53.039
that she comes to the Savior

00:35:53.039 --> 00:35:56.039
and now she leaves from where he is

00:35:56.039 --> 00:35:57.999
and she returns to her home

00:35:57.999 --> 00:36:00.679
and she finds that her daughter was made whole

00:36:00.679 --> 00:36:02.239
from that very hour.

00:36:03.759 --> 00:36:04.799
I believe this is something

00:36:04.799 --> 00:36:06.759
they probably talked about for a while.

00:36:08.119 --> 00:36:08.959
Don't you?

00:36:09.919 --> 00:36:14.919
I mean, something that would not soon be forgotten.

00:36:16.399 --> 00:36:18.359
To see how God worked,

00:36:18.359 --> 00:36:19.879
what He did,

00:36:19.879 --> 00:36:23.839
could only be explained as God did it.

00:36:23.839 --> 00:36:25.239
There was nothing she could do.

00:36:25.239 --> 00:36:27.719
There was nothing anyone else could do.

00:36:27.719 --> 00:36:30.439
But the Lord Jesus Christ, God in flesh,

00:36:30.439 --> 00:36:34.399
He was able to deliver this her daughter

00:36:34.399 --> 00:36:37.799
who had been grievously vexed with a devil.

00:36:37.999 --> 00:36:40.359
Notice that she is commended for her faith

00:36:40.359 --> 00:36:43.639
in our account in Matthew 15, 28.

00:36:43.639 --> 00:36:44.479
The Bible says,

00:36:44.479 --> 00:36:49.479
a woman, great is thy faith.

00:36:49.479 --> 00:36:50.399
I wonder this morning,

00:36:50.399 --> 00:36:52.639
how many of us,

00:36:52.639 --> 00:36:55.839
would the Lord Jesus Christ say of us,

00:36:55.839 --> 00:36:58.359
great is thy faith?

00:36:59.759 --> 00:37:02.279
I'm not asking if you think you have great faith.

00:37:02.279 --> 00:37:03.839
I'm not asking if someone else,

00:37:03.839 --> 00:37:05.439
humanly speaking,

00:37:05.439 --> 00:37:07.799
thinks that you have great faith.

00:37:07.799 --> 00:37:10.959
But I'm wondering if Jesus would say of me,

00:37:10.959 --> 00:37:13.799
I'm wondering if Jesus would say of you,

00:37:13.799 --> 00:37:16.319
great is thy faith.

00:37:17.239 --> 00:37:18.999
She just believed God.

00:37:19.919 --> 00:37:21.919
She just believed,

00:37:21.919 --> 00:37:25.159
and she didn't hear half as what we've heard.

00:37:25.159 --> 00:37:25.999
Amen?

00:37:25.999 --> 00:37:28.039
We have the whole canon of Scripture.

00:37:29.759 --> 00:37:31.719
But she believed.

00:37:31.719 --> 00:37:35.359
And Jesus says, great is thy faith.

00:37:36.999 --> 00:37:41.999
Quickly, as we look at this passage of Scripture,

00:37:42.079 --> 00:37:45.479
we consider the interaction that took place

00:37:45.479 --> 00:37:47.279
between this desperate mother

00:37:48.439 --> 00:37:50.399
and the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:37:50.399 --> 00:37:53.159
I wonder this morning where we can relate.

00:37:53.159 --> 00:37:54.359
I wonder this morning,

00:37:54.359 --> 00:37:56.119
not just for the moms,

00:37:56.119 --> 00:37:58.519
but yes, to the moms,

00:37:58.519 --> 00:38:00.039
to all of us this morning,

00:38:01.039 --> 00:38:03.839
have we recognized that Jesus is the Messiah,

00:38:03.839 --> 00:38:05.799
that He is the Christ?

00:38:05.799 --> 00:38:07.279
Have we placed our faith and trust

00:38:07.279 --> 00:38:09.639
in the finished work of Christ at Calvary,

00:38:09.639 --> 00:38:11.079
that He died according to the Scriptures,

00:38:11.079 --> 00:38:11.919
He was buried,

00:38:11.919 --> 00:38:15.199
and He rose on the third day according to the Scriptures?

00:38:15.199 --> 00:38:16.479
Have you been saved?

00:38:17.319 --> 00:38:18.239
Can I tell you this morning

00:38:18.239 --> 00:38:20.519
that if you've not trusted Christ as your Savior,

00:38:20.519 --> 00:38:22.199
today is the day of salvation.

00:38:23.199 --> 00:38:24.439
Don't put it off.

00:38:25.719 --> 00:38:28.119
No man knoweth what a day may bring forth.

00:38:30.639 --> 00:38:32.359
And we find that she recognized

00:38:32.359 --> 00:38:33.839
that He is Messiah, that He is Lord.

00:38:33.839 --> 00:38:35.519
She recognized He's worthy of worship.

00:38:35.519 --> 00:38:38.279
I wonder, how are we worshiping the Lord?

00:38:40.079 --> 00:38:42.199
She recognized that He had all power.

00:38:43.919 --> 00:38:45.479
And the basis of her request

00:38:45.479 --> 00:38:48.919
was what she recognized this morning.

00:38:48.919 --> 00:38:51.719
Are we begging God, pleading with God?

00:38:51.719 --> 00:38:56.119
I see the passion of this woman, this mother.

00:38:56.119 --> 00:38:59.839
I see that she, with persistence and being specific,

00:39:00.639 --> 00:39:04.279
she had passion in seeking the Lord.

00:39:04.279 --> 00:39:07.319
I wonder, the Bible says the effectual fervent prayer

00:39:07.319 --> 00:39:09.559
of a righteous man availeth much.

00:39:09.559 --> 00:39:13.719
Are we wrestling in prayer?

00:39:13.719 --> 00:39:15.799
Are we seeking the face of God?

00:39:15.799 --> 00:39:18.039
Are we believing that He is able?

00:39:18.039 --> 00:39:20.079
Are we asking Him for some things

00:39:20.079 --> 00:39:23.759
that could only be done by Him

00:39:24.719 --> 00:39:27.079
so that we can see that God did it?

00:39:27.079 --> 00:39:29.239
You know, our kids need to see God working.

00:39:30.399 --> 00:39:33.999
I imagine the interaction

00:39:33.999 --> 00:39:37.479
between this mom and her daughter.

00:39:37.479 --> 00:39:42.319
I imagine her telling her daughter of this account

00:39:42.319 --> 00:39:44.079
probably more than once.

00:39:45.839 --> 00:39:48.519
When you were, we don't know how old, young daughter,

00:39:50.239 --> 00:39:52.439
you'd been grievously vexed with the devil.

00:39:54.439 --> 00:39:56.439
And there was nothing we could do.

00:39:57.479 --> 00:39:59.399
There are other accounts in the Gospels

00:39:59.479 --> 00:40:01.719
of those that were demon-possessed.

00:40:01.719 --> 00:40:02.559
How terrible!

00:40:02.559 --> 00:40:17.559
We find, she said, but Jesus, I heard of Him, and I went, and He cast out the devil.

00:40:17.559 --> 00:40:23.559
Oh, I believe it was a day that, if we could use the term, was a memorial of sorts.

00:40:23.559 --> 00:40:28.559
A day to constantly remember what Jesus did.

00:40:28.559 --> 00:40:34.559
In our lives, our kids, others, they need to know what Jesus did.

00:40:34.559 --> 00:40:36.559
How we've prayed about things.

00:40:36.559 --> 00:40:42.559
How we've exercised faith, believing that He is able.

00:40:42.559 --> 00:40:47.559
What we recognize about God will impact what we request.

00:40:47.559 --> 00:40:51.559
And can I tell you that if we don't request, we're not receiving.

00:40:51.559 --> 00:40:53.559
Right?

00:40:53.559 --> 00:40:55.559
We're not receiving if we're not asking.

00:40:55.559 --> 00:40:59.559
Our God is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think.

00:40:59.559 --> 00:41:03.559
The Bible says, call unto Me, and I will answer thee,

00:41:03.559 --> 00:41:06.559
and show thee great and mighty things which thou knowest not.

00:41:06.559 --> 00:41:09.559
She received because she requested.

00:41:09.559 --> 00:41:12.559
She requested because she recognized.

00:41:12.559 --> 00:41:16.559
And this morning, I hope that we recognize some things about our Savior,

00:41:16.559 --> 00:41:23.559
and that it has a noticeable impact and influence in our behavior.

00:41:23.559 --> 00:41:26.559
Lord, help me.

00:41:26.559 --> 00:41:29.559
Father, we thank You and we love You.

00:41:29.559 --> 00:41:34.559
We thank You for the truth of Thy Word.

00:41:34.559 --> 00:41:38.559
This interaction that's been recorded by Matthew and Mark

00:41:38.559 --> 00:41:46.559
regarding this day in which this desperate mother came

00:41:46.559 --> 00:41:49.559
to the house where Jesus was.

00:41:49.559 --> 00:41:53.559
We know that it really happened.

00:41:53.559 --> 00:41:58.559
And we now, almost 2,000 years later, are rejoicing

00:41:58.559 --> 00:42:03.559
in the work that was accomplished on this day.

00:42:03.559 --> 00:42:07.559
But as we begin to examine the passage of Scripture,

00:42:07.559 --> 00:42:12.559
we begin to notice what this desperate mother recognized

00:42:12.559 --> 00:42:16.559
and what she requested, what she received.

00:42:16.559 --> 00:42:20.559
Oh, how we're challenged in our own walk with Thee today.

00:42:20.559 --> 00:42:26.559
God, I pray that if there'd be one that's tuned in this morning

00:42:26.559 --> 00:42:30.559
that does not know the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal Savior,

00:42:30.559 --> 00:42:33.559
they've never recognized that Jesus is the Messiah,

00:42:33.559 --> 00:42:40.559
that this Jesus is the Christ, that He is God in flesh.

00:42:40.559 --> 00:42:43.559
Oh God, it's our prayer that they'd get that settled today.

00:42:43.559 --> 00:42:46.559
They would not allow for another moment to go by

00:42:46.559 --> 00:42:49.559
without knowing for sure that heaven is their home.

00:42:49.559 --> 00:42:53.559
God, help us to be mindful of the fact that You have all power.

00:42:53.559 --> 00:42:55.559
There's nothing beyond Your control.

00:42:55.559 --> 00:42:59.559
Nothing too difficult for Thee.

00:42:59.559 --> 00:43:01.559
Oh, but you don't understand my child.

00:43:01.559 --> 00:43:05.559
You don't understand God.

00:43:05.559 --> 00:43:12.559
And I don't say that without any concern or without any compassion.

00:43:12.559 --> 00:43:16.559
I simply say it because it's true.

00:43:16.559 --> 00:43:18.559
Our God is able.

00:43:18.559 --> 00:43:21.559
Our God is able.

00:43:21.559 --> 00:43:25.559
Oh Lord, I pray that You'd help us.

00:43:25.559 --> 00:43:27.559
Help us to depend upon Thee.

00:43:27.559 --> 00:43:30.559
Help us to seek Thee.

00:43:30.559 --> 00:43:33.559
In the moment of invitation and the quietness of the moment,

00:43:33.559 --> 00:43:37.559
Lord, I pray that You'd work in my heart and the hearts of those that are present,

00:43:37.559 --> 00:43:40.559
those that have tuned in via live stream.

00:43:40.559 --> 00:43:44.559
God, that You would do a work that we'd sit back and say,

00:43:44.559 --> 00:43:47.559
look at what God did.

00:43:47.559 --> 00:43:49.559
That You alone would be glorified.

00:43:49.559 --> 00:43:51.559
Well, thank You for all that You'll do.

00:43:51.559 --> 00:43:53.559
For it's in Christ's name we pray.
