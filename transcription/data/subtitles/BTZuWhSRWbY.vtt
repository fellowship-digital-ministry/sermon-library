00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.099
And I'll be finishing up this chapter this morning Colossians 1 be looking at verses 24 down through verse number 29

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:12.560
And as you know as we've been studying the book of Colossians the Apostle Paul never

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.399
personally ministered in the city of Colossae and

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:24.920
Therefore he did not know the believers that he was writing to personally nor did the believers in Colossae know him

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.440
personally no doubt there was some understanding that

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:34.439
Paul had about these believers and these believers had heard about the Apostle Paul

00:00:34.439 --> 00:00:35.360
of course

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:42.799
we know as we study the portion of Scripture in the beginning of this book and other portions of Scripture with that that a

00:00:43.279 --> 00:00:49.599
Paphras was the man that God used that was the minister there in the church at Colossae and

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.279
He was a fellow prisoner of Paul's and they knew one another a fellow servant

00:00:55.279 --> 00:01:01.279
he refers to him as in other portions of Scripture and as we understand the relationship between Paul and

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.559
Epaphras it is through this relationship that Paul

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:11.599
Learns about these believers in Colossae as soon as he found out about these believers in Colossae

00:01:11.599 --> 00:01:16.080
We find that the Apostle Paul is burdened for them. He is concerned for them

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.120
He desires to minister to them and God would use the Apostle Paul

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:25.279
Under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God to pen the words of this book the book of Colossians

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:32.919
That would be sent to these believers. We understand also and we've made this known as we began studying this book that in Colossae

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.160
The the false teachers were there and they were active

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.040
We know that the Bible warns about false prophets in the Old Testament

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.480
The Bible tells us about false teachers in the New Testament

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.199
We understand that just as there were false prophets in the first century

00:01:48.199 --> 00:01:53.199
There continue to be false prophets even until this day and these false teachers

00:01:53.199 --> 00:01:59.080
They were active in the church in Colossae and we would understand that as they were active there

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.080
That one of the things that they would do is they would attack the truth of the Word of God

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:10.119
But they would also attack the servants of God and in attacking the servants of God

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.880
We understand that Paul himself would come under the attack of these false

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.320
Teachers and as they would attack the false teachers and attack the truth that they would proclaim

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.320
We find that they were seeking to discredit Paul personally if we'd understand the passage here

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.960
They seek to discredit Paul and to promote themselves

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.080
There's something interesting about false teachers and that is that they're seeking

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.360
Gain for themselves and we find that it was John the Baptist that said

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:44.679
He must increase but I must decrease and the Apostle Paul was concerned about

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:50.240
Promoting and proclaiming the gospel of Jesus Christ and

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.080
Exalting our Lord and Savior and we see that that's what he was about

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.639
He wasn't about finding recognition for himself getting a big name for himself and all of these sort of things

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:04.800
No, he wanted to preach Christ and exalt Christ because he understood

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:11.600
The the importance of that he understood that all that he was was because of the grace of God

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:18.679
Amen, and all we are is because of the grace of God. We sing amazing grace and what a wonderful

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.679
familiar

00:03:20.679 --> 00:03:22.759
favorite for many him that is

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.919
Amazing grace. I mean God's grace is amazing

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:31.520
It's abundant and we are what we are Paul said I am what I am by the grace of God

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:39.600
So if we look at this chapter Colossians chapter 1 if we were to quickly overview this first chapter and we'll finish it this morning

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:46.600
But we find that Paul in the beginning section of Colossians 1. What is he doing? He's encouraging these believers

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:51.800
He's writing to them and he's encouraging them. He's telling them how he heard about their faith

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:57.699
He heard that they had trust at Christ as their Savior and from that day. He began to pray for them and he

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.020
Encourages them by telling them how

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.539
Specifically he is praying for them. We've studied that portion of Scripture

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:11.059
I will not review it this morning, but we find that Paul through those first

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:18.260
That's that first section of Colossians 1 he's encouraging the believers and then we find that he exalts the Lord Jesus Christ

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:25.059
beginning in verse number 15 and following we studied the passage a couple of weeks ago and we find how that the Apostle Paul would

00:04:25.059 --> 00:04:32.339
Exalt the Lord Jesus Christ and how important it is in our lives that we exalt our Savior. It's not about us

00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:33.899
It's not about

00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:36.179
Even our church. It's about the Lord

00:04:36.179 --> 00:04:43.579
It's about people knowing that Jesus Christ is the only way to heaven that he is the only Savior for mankind

00:04:43.899 --> 00:04:47.019
And we seek to preach that truth

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.700
now as we end

00:04:49.739 --> 00:04:57.179
This chapter really if I would summarize what Paul does here is he begins to explain his ministry

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:04.579
He explains his ministry and in so doing I believe that he's seeking of course under the inspiration of Holy Spirit to

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:12.380
Give truth to these believers and Colossi to understand the ministry that he has the philosophy of ministry

00:05:12.739 --> 00:05:16.459
That he has and and really set it apart

00:05:16.459 --> 00:05:17.820
It is it is

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:25.299
distinctly different than these false teachers that had invaded the church and that were promoting their false teaching and they were

00:05:25.299 --> 00:05:32.380
Promoting themselves. And so Paul is going to take a few verses at the end of this chapter and explain his ministry

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:37.260
I simply have titled the message this morning the ministry of Paul the ministry of Paul

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.899
Let's dig right in verse number 24 says this

00:05:40.899 --> 00:05:48.459
Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in

00:05:48.619 --> 00:05:52.119
My flesh for his body's sake which is the church

00:05:52.859 --> 00:05:55.500
Whereof I am made a minister

00:05:56.299 --> 00:06:02.980
According to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the Word of God

00:06:03.739 --> 00:06:07.500
Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations

00:06:07.899 --> 00:06:12.660
But is now made manifest to his saints to whom God would make known

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:15.940
What is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles?

00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:19.980
Which is Christ in you the hope of glory

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.420
verse 28 whom we preach

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:31.019
Warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.500
Where unto I also labor

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:38.859
Striving according to his working which worketh in me

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:41.260
mightily

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.420
Number one if you're taking notes this morning

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:49.980
I want you to notice that Paul was enlisted into the ministry Paul was enlisted in the ministry. He uses two phrases

00:06:50.739 --> 00:06:52.019
Really? It's the same phrase

00:06:52.019 --> 00:06:57.019
He just repeats it at the end of verse number 23 and at the beginning of verse number 25

00:06:57.339 --> 00:07:04.859
Notice what he says at the end of verse number 23 Paul says this whereof I Paul am made a minister

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:08.140
He then says in verse number 25

00:07:08.459 --> 00:07:10.700
Whereof I am made a minister

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:15.100
See the Apostle Paul understood the call of God upon his life

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:21.980
He understood that he'd been enlisted in the ministry of the gospel the ministry of Jesus Christ and what a great privilege

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:26.459
It was for the Apostle Paul to be enlisted into the ministry

00:07:26.459 --> 00:07:32.660
We understand that as Paul would share with the believers in Colossae now his ministry

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:40.420
No doubt in my mind that the Apostle Paul in his mind races back to his conversion and we understand it in Acts chapter

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:41.420
number 9

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:49.459
And and here's what's interesting about the passage of Scripture is that after Jesus tells Paul Saul at the time

00:07:49.619 --> 00:07:55.579
Who he was I am Jesus whom thou persecutest that Paul Saul at the time

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:57.980
Responds by saying Lord

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:02.739
What will thou have me to do?

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:07.420
What will thou have me to do now? That's a good question

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:13.299
It's a question that every child of God should ask their Lord and Savior

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:18.739
You've saved my soul. You've changed my eternal destiny now Lord

00:08:19.019 --> 00:08:21.420
What is it that you would have me to do?

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.220
We find that in Acts 9 in verse number 6

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:26.980
That is the record that is given of the Apostle Paul

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:33.299
Saul at that time asking that question when he is sharing his testimony in Acts chapter number 22

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:38.340
He says that Jesus said this to him and it's recorded in Acts 22 in verse number 21

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:44.539
He says depart for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:46.460
In the book of Galatians

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:50.900
we find that Paul would refer to himself as being the Gentile to the

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:56.500
Uncircumcision or to the Gentiles and Peter to the circumcision or to the Jews we find

00:08:56.780 --> 00:09:03.140
That Paul would use this phraseology as he's speaking to these believers in Colossae and help them

00:09:03.419 --> 00:09:08.299
Understand that he was in the ministry because he had been called by God

00:09:09.059 --> 00:09:12.140
Go back if you will to Acts 26 and read with me

00:09:13.099 --> 00:09:19.340
Paul's testimony in Acts chapter number 26. He once again is sharing his testimony

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:24.419
We find this a couple of times in the book of Acts in this particular context

00:09:24.419 --> 00:09:29.619
we find that Paul is speaking before Agrippa and in verse number 14

00:09:31.219 --> 00:09:32.979
Look at verse number 13 with me

00:09:32.979 --> 00:09:35.659
It says this at midday when they were on their way to Damascus

00:09:35.659 --> 00:09:39.700
Oh King I saw on the way a light from heaven above the brightness of the Sun

00:09:40.179 --> 00:09:45.820
Shining round about me and then which journeyed with me and when we were all fallen to the earth

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:48.780
I heard a voice speaking unto me and saying in the Hebrew tongue

00:09:49.419 --> 00:09:50.700
Saul

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:51.780
Saul

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:59.739
Why persecuted thou me it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks and I said who art thou?

00:09:59.739 --> 00:10:06.339
Lord, and he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest. In Acts 9 is the record of

00:10:06.339 --> 00:10:10.659
this immediate event and that's where verse number 6 tells us that Saul then

00:10:10.659 --> 00:10:16.779
says, Lord what wilt thou have me to do? Notice in verse 16 of Acts 26, but rise

00:10:16.779 --> 00:10:22.219
and stand upon thy feet, for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose.

00:10:22.219 --> 00:10:30.139
Notice this phrase, to make thee a minister and a witness, both of these

00:10:30.139 --> 00:10:33.979
things which thou hast seen and of those things in the which I will appear unto

00:10:33.979 --> 00:10:39.019
thee, delivering thee from the people and from the Gentiles unto whom now I send

00:10:39.019 --> 00:10:43.979
thee, to open their eyes and to turn them from darkness to light and from the

00:10:43.979 --> 00:10:48.099
power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and

00:10:48.099 --> 00:10:53.459
inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me. Now

00:10:53.459 --> 00:10:58.539
notice what Paul says. He shares his testimony with Agrippa as to the call

00:10:58.539 --> 00:11:02.899
that was placed upon his life, and in verse number 19 he says, Whereupon, O King

00:11:02.899 --> 00:11:10.899
Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision. Paul understood that he

00:11:10.899 --> 00:11:16.859
was enlisted into the ministry, that he had this ministry, and we find that as we

00:11:16.859 --> 00:11:20.339
go back to the book of Colossians and as he's speaking to these believers in

00:11:20.339 --> 00:11:24.339
Colossae and as he's rehearsing for them and helping them to understand, again

00:11:24.339 --> 00:11:29.139
remember, the false teachers would seek to attack the person of the Apostle Paul.

00:11:29.139 --> 00:11:34.179
They don't want them to, those false teachers, they don't want the believers

00:11:34.179 --> 00:11:39.019
in the church in Colossae to listen to what Paul would say, they don't want them

00:11:39.019 --> 00:11:43.659
to follow what the Apostle Paul would teach and proclaim, and so they seek to

00:11:43.659 --> 00:11:48.379
discredit Paul. He's in prison, by the way. You're gonna listen to a man that's

00:11:48.379 --> 00:11:53.059
in prison? I mean, can you understand what these false teachers may say? And Paul

00:11:53.059 --> 00:11:57.219
says, I want you to understand that I'm a minister. I've been enlisted into the

00:11:57.219 --> 00:12:01.379
ministry. Notice what he says in verse number 20, we mentioned in verse 23 and

00:12:01.379 --> 00:12:05.339
verse number 25 back in Colossians 1, that he says, I am made a minister. Notice

00:12:05.339 --> 00:12:10.779
what he says in verse number 24, he says this, Who now rejoice in my sufferings

00:12:10.779 --> 00:12:18.419
for you. That's a powerful statement. The Apostle Paul had once persecuted the

00:12:18.419 --> 00:12:22.859
church. We understand his name was Saul at that time. He'd once persecuted the

00:12:22.859 --> 00:12:29.659
church, but now he was suffering for the church. And the Bible says here in verse

00:12:29.659 --> 00:12:34.099
number 24, Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you. I want you to think

00:12:34.099 --> 00:12:38.099
about this when Paul says in Philippians 3 and verse number 10, that I may know

00:12:38.099 --> 00:12:43.219
him in the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings,

00:12:43.219 --> 00:12:48.979
being made conformable unto his death. Paul is now suffering, but he's not

00:12:48.979 --> 00:12:54.019
suffering as an evildoer. He's not suffering as one that has broken

00:12:54.019 --> 00:12:59.979
the law of God or of man. He's suffering because he has fulfilled the ministry

00:12:59.979 --> 00:13:05.139
that God has given him. And because of his faithfulness in preaching the Word

00:13:05.139 --> 00:13:10.619
of God, because he would travel from city to city, the Jews hated him because

00:13:10.619 --> 00:13:15.459
of that message that he proclaimed, and that message is that Jesus is the

00:13:15.459 --> 00:13:20.539
Savior, he is the Messiah, he is the Anointed One. And they hated him because

00:13:20.539 --> 00:13:26.819
of that. And Paul is now in prison, and he's saying to these believers in Colossae,

00:13:26.819 --> 00:13:32.539
I am in this place, I am having, I'm enduring these sufferings, but I want you

00:13:32.539 --> 00:13:38.379
to know that I'm rejoicing in them. I'm rejoicing. Philippians is a sister book

00:13:38.379 --> 00:13:41.579
that was written during the same time period when Paul was in prison, and

00:13:41.579 --> 00:13:45.579
really the theme and the thought of the book of Philippians is rejoice, be

00:13:45.579 --> 00:13:52.379
joyful. Rejoice in the Lord always. And again, I say rejoice. Philippians 4 and

00:13:52.379 --> 00:13:59.499
verse number 4. And Paul here is saying to these believers in Colossae that he's

00:13:59.499 --> 00:14:03.039
rejoicing in his sufferings, he says these sufferings are for you, he says,

00:14:03.039 --> 00:14:06.659
and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for

00:14:06.659 --> 00:14:11.019
his body's sake, which is the church. Understand that in verse number 24 he's

00:14:11.019 --> 00:14:16.299
speaking again about the suffering that he's enduring because of his ministry

00:14:16.299 --> 00:14:22.899
for the gospel's sake, for the church, the advancement of the church. We find that

00:14:22.899 --> 00:14:29.259
here the Apostle Paul, as he's sharing with these believers about this really

00:14:29.259 --> 00:14:35.339
perspective, it really would encourage us, but it would also convict us. Because

00:14:35.339 --> 00:14:39.579
the reality is that we too have been enlisted into the ministry. We've been

00:14:39.579 --> 00:14:46.019
enlisted in the ministry. Now, our place of service is going to vary, no doubt. We

00:14:46.019 --> 00:14:51.940
find that as we have been enlisted, each one of us have a specific task, but all

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:57.339
for the glory of God. It's all for the glory of God. And Paul had a specific

00:14:57.339 --> 00:15:02.419
task, he had a specific aspect of ministry that he was enlisted into, and

00:15:02.419 --> 00:15:08.819
and he sought to fulfill that ministry. And in so doing, as we understand that

00:15:08.819 --> 00:15:13.099
we've been enlisted into the ministry, that we too are servants of the Lord,

00:15:13.099 --> 00:15:17.699
just as Paul is a servant of the Lord, that we too may face difficulty and

00:15:17.699 --> 00:15:23.579
hardship. Paul says this to Timothy in 2nd Timothy chapter number 3, he says in

00:15:23.579 --> 00:15:28.940
verse number 12, "'Yea, all those who live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer

00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:33.699
persecution.'" Peter, as he's writing to those believers that are suffering

00:15:33.699 --> 00:15:40.380
greatly because of the evil, wicked Emperor Nero and his desire to attack

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:44.779
and stamp out Christianity, we find that Peter would say in 1st Peter 4 and

00:15:44.779 --> 00:15:48.899
verse number 12, "'Think it not strange concerning the fiery trial that's coming

00:15:48.899 --> 00:15:54.339
upon you.'" The reality is that Peter would say to those believers that he's

00:15:54.339 --> 00:15:58.059
writing to that are scattered abroad because of the persecution, the

00:15:58.059 --> 00:16:07.179
hardship, he says, "'Rejoice! I mean, happy are ye.'" And you say, really? Yeah. In Acts 5

00:16:07.179 --> 00:16:13.139
in verse number 41, after the disciples were beaten and sent out and said, "'Don't

00:16:13.139 --> 00:16:17.339
preach in his name any longer,' they were singing and rejoicing that they were

00:16:17.339 --> 00:16:25.619
counted worthy to suffer shame for his namesake." Wow. Paul says, I want you to

00:16:25.619 --> 00:16:29.779
understand, believers in Colossae, I've been enlisted into the ministry, I've

00:16:29.779 --> 00:16:34.779
been called by God, and I'm seeking to fulfill the ministry. That's where we

00:16:34.779 --> 00:16:38.979
enter into our next point, number two, if you will, Paul explains his ministry. Not

00:16:38.979 --> 00:16:42.419
only was he enlisted in the ministry, but now he's going to explain his ministry.

00:16:42.419 --> 00:16:48.859
In verse number 25, notice what he says, "'Whereof I am made a minister,' notice this

00:16:48.859 --> 00:16:55.259
phrase, "'according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you to

00:16:55.259 --> 00:17:00.419
fulfill the Word of God.'" That word, dispensation, is a word that really means

00:17:00.419 --> 00:17:06.059
stewardship. This responsibility, if you will, this being a steward, has been

00:17:06.059 --> 00:17:11.139
placed upon the Apostle Paul, this dispensation of God which is given to me

00:17:11.139 --> 00:17:15.940
for you. Paul understood that he had been given this responsibility, and I

00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:20.179
believe that as we look at verse number 25, that really Paul recognizes this as

00:17:20.179 --> 00:17:25.419
both a privilege and a responsibility. Notice the phrase in verse number 25

00:17:25.419 --> 00:17:33.819
where it says this, "'which is given to me for you.'" Which is given to me for you.

00:17:33.819 --> 00:17:39.739
What is the privilege? It was given to him. Which is given to me, what is the

00:17:39.739 --> 00:17:46.380
responsibility? For you. Which is given to me for you. You understand this

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:51.059
morning I preached, I think maybe even this year at Christmas, but I know I've

00:17:51.059 --> 00:17:55.899
preached it in years past, when you look at the account of those shepherds that

00:17:55.899 --> 00:18:01.179
received the good news of glad tidings, which is to you but it shall be to all

00:18:01.179 --> 00:18:05.259
people, is what the Scriptures tell us, and they were to go and proclaim that

00:18:05.259 --> 00:18:09.099
message, and they did, and we find that for us as we would look here at the

00:18:09.099 --> 00:18:13.979
truth that Paul is relaying to these believers in Colossae, is that this

00:18:13.979 --> 00:18:20.979
ministry, as I seek to explain the ministry, it was given to me for you. You

00:18:20.979 --> 00:18:27.819
know that the gospel wasn't brought to you just to keep to yourself? Really. What

00:18:27.819 --> 00:18:32.700
a great joy to understand that the gospel has been given to us, but what

00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:38.260
great responsibility is ours to take that message and proclaim it to a lost

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:44.859
and dying world. And we find that Paul desires, no doubt, to be faithful to this

00:18:44.859 --> 00:18:48.539
ministry that had been given to him. Notice at the end of verse number 25, he

00:18:48.539 --> 00:18:53.820
says, to fulfill the Word of God, to complete that which had been given to

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:58.779
him, to make known that which had been previously unknown. Look in verses 26 and

00:18:58.779 --> 00:19:05.459
27, he says, even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations,

00:19:05.539 --> 00:19:11.380
but is now made manifest to his saints. What is this mystery that Paul would

00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:17.039
speak of in verse number 27? It says, to whom God would make known what is the

00:19:17.039 --> 00:19:23.059
riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in

00:19:23.059 --> 00:19:31.700
you, the hope of glory. Wow, what a great opportunity that Paul had to make known

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:37.099
the truth of the gospel and to understand this truth that Gentiles

00:19:37.099 --> 00:19:43.380
could be heirs of salvation, and that we have the privilege of having this truth

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:50.580
that has now been delivered to us as well. Christ in you, the hope of glory. And

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:57.299
Paul says, I desire to be faithful to that which God has given me to do. We

00:19:57.299 --> 00:20:02.099
find that in 1 Corinthians 4 and verse number 27,

00:20:02.099 --> 00:20:10.979
Number two, the Bible says moreover is required in stewards that a man be found faithful.

00:20:10.979 --> 00:20:16.659
By the way, it was God that used Paul to pen those words as well to the church in Corinth.

00:20:16.659 --> 00:20:21.579
And Paul, as he would now be sharing with these believers in Colossae, many years had

00:20:21.579 --> 00:20:25.879
passed between the writing of 1 Corinthians and the writing of Colossians.

00:20:25.879 --> 00:20:31.019
And Paul is saying, I desire to be faithful to what God has given me to do.

00:20:31.019 --> 00:20:35.039
I understand that this is a matter of stewardship.

00:20:35.039 --> 00:20:36.999
And then notice how he explains it.

00:20:36.999 --> 00:20:42.639
Really, there's a threefold aspect of ministry that Paul will unload to these believers in

00:20:42.639 --> 00:20:44.439
Colossae in verse number 28.

00:20:44.439 --> 00:20:50.279
He begins to unwrap his ministry and to explain to them this ministry that God has given.

00:20:50.279 --> 00:20:57.199
Notice the first aspect in verse 28, whom we preach, whom we preach.

00:20:57.199 --> 00:21:02.779
The first aspect of the ministry that Paul would share with these believers in Colossae

00:21:02.779 --> 00:21:06.539
is the responsibility to preach the gospel, to preach Christ.

00:21:06.539 --> 00:21:14.459
You end verse number 27 by saying, Christ in you, the hope of glory, whom we preach.

00:21:14.459 --> 00:21:19.819
The word preach means to announce, to declare, to make known, to publish.

00:21:19.819 --> 00:21:24.699
We think about the songs that speak about published glad tidings, to make known the

00:21:24.699 --> 00:21:27.479
gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:21:27.479 --> 00:21:34.119
And Paul says that the first aspect of the ministry that God has entrusted to me, I've

00:21:34.119 --> 00:21:38.999
been enlisted in this ministry, and I want to explain to you that, number one, we preach

00:21:38.999 --> 00:21:41.399
Christ whom we preach.

00:21:41.399 --> 00:21:47.559
You know, God has chosen that He would use preaching, the foolishness of preaching.

00:21:47.559 --> 00:21:52.479
In the book of 1 Corinthians, in chapter number 1, Paul says this in verse 21, and then again

00:21:52.479 --> 00:21:57.739
in verse number 23, as he would speak about preaching, and preaching the truth of the

00:21:57.739 --> 00:21:58.739
Word of God.

00:21:58.739 --> 00:22:03.339
In fact, Paul would say this in 1 Corinthians 1 and verse 17, for Christ sent me not to

00:22:03.339 --> 00:22:11.339
baptize, but to preach the gospel, not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ

00:22:11.339 --> 00:22:13.339
should be made of none effect.

00:22:13.339 --> 00:22:14.339
What's he saying?

00:22:14.339 --> 00:22:16.299
I want to preach in the power of the Holy Spirit of God.

00:22:16.299 --> 00:22:18.299
We'll get to that in just a moment, by the way.

00:22:18.759 --> 00:22:22.439
He's saying that we're preaching Christ.

00:22:22.439 --> 00:22:27.959
Verse 21 of 1 Corinthians 1, for after that, in the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom

00:22:27.959 --> 00:22:37.879
knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.

00:22:37.879 --> 00:22:44.079
For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom, but we preach Christ, crucified

00:22:44.299 --> 00:22:48.539
unto the Jews a stumbling block, and unto the Greeks foolishness.

00:22:48.539 --> 00:22:53.739
But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ, the power of God, and

00:22:53.739 --> 00:22:55.419
the wisdom of God.

00:22:55.419 --> 00:22:57.339
I'm thankful for preaching.

00:22:57.339 --> 00:23:02.579
I enjoy preaching, but I enjoy hearing good preaching, amen?

00:23:02.579 --> 00:23:10.419
I enjoy hearing someone open and publish and proclaim the truth of the Word of God to preach

00:23:10.419 --> 00:23:12.299
God's Word.

00:23:12.299 --> 00:23:17.599
Paul says, as he would explain his ministry to these believers in Colossae, he says, number

00:23:17.599 --> 00:23:18.599
one, whom we preach.

00:23:18.599 --> 00:23:25.959
Notice number two, back in Colossians 1, in verse number 28, notice this phrase, warning

00:23:25.959 --> 00:23:27.959
every man.

00:23:27.959 --> 00:23:30.199
Warning every man.

00:23:30.199 --> 00:23:35.399
This is a vital aspect of ministry, warning.

00:23:35.399 --> 00:23:40.879
The reality this morning is that when we live life, if we were to speak to just any ordinary

00:23:40.939 --> 00:23:47.539
people that we came into contact with, the reality is that we are accustomed to warnings.

00:23:47.539 --> 00:23:49.139
There are warnings all around.

00:23:49.139 --> 00:23:53.259
You go to your house this afternoon, and I guarantee you that if you take some products

00:23:53.259 --> 00:23:58.739
out of the sink, cupboard below your sink, that cabinet there, you're going to find some

00:23:58.739 --> 00:24:03.899
warning labels on the back of a number of those products, right?

00:24:03.899 --> 00:24:07.259
Lawyers like those warning labels, right?

00:24:07.259 --> 00:24:12.899
The consumers, we're supposed to be helped by those warning labels.

00:24:12.899 --> 00:24:15.579
You drive, there are warning signs.

00:24:15.579 --> 00:24:20.619
I remember years ago, we drove down to South Carolina as a family, and there was a sign

00:24:20.619 --> 00:24:24.799
up that said, warning, bridge out ahead.

00:24:24.799 --> 00:24:30.739
You know, I was happy for that warning sign because if it wasn't there, I might not be

00:24:30.739 --> 00:24:32.019
here.

00:24:32.019 --> 00:24:33.019
You understand?

00:24:33.019 --> 00:24:35.379
There are warnings.

00:24:35.379 --> 00:24:37.819
We're accustomed to warnings.

00:24:37.819 --> 00:24:45.979
In fact, many of us come to a place in our lives where we've learned to appreciate warnings.

00:24:45.979 --> 00:24:50.619
But there's something interesting about warnings biblically speaking.

00:24:50.619 --> 00:24:54.499
All of a sudden, people get all kinds of concern when the preacher decides to give warnings

00:24:54.499 --> 00:24:58.899
from the Word of God, honestly.

00:24:58.899 --> 00:25:04.419
But the reality is that this is a vital aspect of ministry.

00:25:04.459 --> 00:25:08.259
And Paul says, warning every man.

00:25:08.259 --> 00:25:15.579
We should learn to appreciate the warnings of God's Word declared by God's man, truly.

00:25:15.579 --> 00:25:16.579
I am thankful.

00:25:16.579 --> 00:25:21.859
Listen, I understand this morning that this book that we hold dear and precious to us,

00:25:21.859 --> 00:25:25.459
it is a living book, and it is a book that is profitable.

00:25:25.459 --> 00:25:27.059
The Scriptures teach us that.

00:25:27.059 --> 00:25:31.439
But contained within this book are many warnings.

00:25:31.439 --> 00:25:34.639
And we're warned about many things.

00:25:34.639 --> 00:25:39.999
And the Apostle Paul is understanding this vital aspect of ministry, and he's saying,

00:25:39.999 --> 00:25:40.999
warning every man.

00:25:40.999 --> 00:25:42.119
Now, the ministry doesn't end there.

00:25:42.119 --> 00:25:43.399
It doesn't end with warnings.

00:25:43.399 --> 00:25:47.319
We're going to see the fullness of verse number 28 in just a moment, but we understand the

00:25:47.319 --> 00:25:49.239
importance of warnings.

00:25:49.239 --> 00:25:57.759
Listen, if you had a polluted water source, would you not want somebody to warn you?

00:25:57.759 --> 00:26:04.599
If someone had gone and purposefully contaminated your water supply, would you not want somebody

00:26:04.599 --> 00:26:06.279
to warn you?

00:26:06.279 --> 00:26:08.999
Would you get mad at them for warning you?

00:26:08.999 --> 00:26:11.439
I hope not.

00:26:11.439 --> 00:26:14.639
I'm going to drink it because I want to drink it, bless God.

00:26:14.639 --> 00:26:17.559
You understand what I'm saying?

00:26:17.559 --> 00:26:21.779
But all of a sudden, when a preacher gets up and wants to give a warning from the Word

00:26:21.779 --> 00:26:27.639
of God, all of a sudden, we don't like warnings anymore.

00:26:27.639 --> 00:26:28.639
Here's what Paul says.

00:26:28.639 --> 00:26:36.999
Turn to the book of 1 Corinthians, if you will, in chapter number 4.

00:26:36.999 --> 00:26:39.399
I think it was back in November.

00:26:39.399 --> 00:26:45.599
I had a late notice of preaching a message for a teen rally, and the teens that were

00:26:45.599 --> 00:26:49.599
there from our church will remember I preached from this passage of Scripture in 1 Corinthians

00:26:49.599 --> 00:26:50.599
4.

00:26:50.599 --> 00:26:54.479
I do not have time to develop the entire thought here, but I want to draw your attention to

00:26:54.479 --> 00:26:56.599
verse number 14.

00:26:56.599 --> 00:27:02.239
Paul loved these people in Corinth that he had the privilege of ministering to.

00:27:02.239 --> 00:27:08.799
Paul says in 1 Corinthians 4, in verse number 14, I write not these things to shame you,

00:27:08.799 --> 00:27:14.439
but as my beloved sons, I warn you.

00:27:14.439 --> 00:27:17.479
As my beloved sons, I warn you.

00:27:17.479 --> 00:27:23.559
See, we come to a place in our lives, biblically speaking, we think about the spiritual aspect

00:27:23.559 --> 00:27:27.559
of warnings, that we come to a place where we should appreciate the warnings that God

00:27:27.559 --> 00:27:34.559
gives us, and the warnings that a preacher, a pastor, an evangelist, a missionary would

00:27:34.559 --> 00:27:40.279
like to proclaim from the Word of God, because God's given us these things to warn us, and

00:27:40.279 --> 00:27:43.399
I'm so thankful for the Word of God.

00:27:43.399 --> 00:27:47.439
I was sharing with Holly just the other day, actually it was on Friday evening, we were

00:27:47.439 --> 00:27:51.639
chatting as we were driving somewhere, and as we were chatting, I shared with her how

00:27:51.639 --> 00:27:57.439
thankful I am for the Word of God, and how through the truth of God's Word, we have

00:27:57.439 --> 00:28:04.399
God revealing to us that which pleases Him, and that which displeases Him.

00:28:04.399 --> 00:28:09.199
In fact, further on in 1 Corinthians, in chapter number 10, Paul will use the illustration

00:28:09.199 --> 00:28:12.719
of some Old Testament examples, I believe there are five examples there if I remember

00:28:12.719 --> 00:28:17.199
correctly, and he says with many of them, God was not well pleased.

00:28:18.199 --> 00:28:23.319
If we would take the examples that Paul gives in that passage of Scripture, and he concludes

00:28:23.319 --> 00:28:27.239
and says, God was not pleased with this behavior, we should take note and say, well then I ought

00:28:27.239 --> 00:28:29.999
not do that, amen?

00:28:29.999 --> 00:28:33.559
Because if it didn't please God then, it's not going to please God now.

00:28:33.559 --> 00:28:40.000
Psalms, you don't have to turn there, but in Psalm 19, in verse number 11, as the psalmist

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:45.739
would declare not only the creation, the glory of creation, and how the heavens declare the

00:28:45.739 --> 00:28:49.819
glory of God, he'll get into the Word of God, the law of the Lord, and he says in verse

00:28:49.819 --> 00:28:57.539
number 11 of Psalm 19, moreover by them, speaking of the words of God, the law of God, is thy

00:28:57.539 --> 00:29:05.699
servant warned, and in keeping of them there is great reward.

00:29:05.699 --> 00:29:10.179
Paul says as he's explaining the ministry that God had entrusted to him, he says first

00:29:10.179 --> 00:29:13.179
of all, we preach Christ.

00:29:13.179 --> 00:29:15.339
Number two, we warn every man.

00:29:15.339 --> 00:29:20.899
Number three, back in Colossians 1 and verse 28, teaching every man.

00:29:20.899 --> 00:29:29.339
Notice what it says, whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom.

00:29:29.339 --> 00:29:32.279
Really this is a fulfillment of the Great Commission.

00:29:32.279 --> 00:29:37.139
We're going to the world and preach the gospel to every creature, baptizing them and teaching

00:29:37.139 --> 00:29:40.019
them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded thee.

00:29:40.019 --> 00:29:44.380
That's what the Lord Jesus Christ said in the fullness of the Great Commission in Matthew

00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:47.059
28, verses 19 and 20.

00:29:47.059 --> 00:29:52.739
We find that here, Paul would share with these believers in Colossae that he was seeking

00:29:52.739 --> 00:29:57.979
not simply to preach the gospel and to warn the believers or to warn every man, but also

00:29:57.979 --> 00:29:59.739
to teach every man.

00:29:59.739 --> 00:30:02.139
It is critical for us to teach the whole counsel of God.

00:30:02.139 --> 00:30:09.699
God. It is absolutely imperative that God's people know God's Word. It really is. God

00:30:09.699 --> 00:30:16.459
has given us this precious book, but not to sit on a shelf and collect dust. Someone said,

00:30:16.459 --> 00:30:21.019
I don't remember who it was, someone said that thumbprints in the Bible are more precious

00:30:21.019 --> 00:30:27.899
than footprints on the moon, and I like that. Let the Bible get into us and affect us and

00:30:27.899 --> 00:30:34.779
impact us and change us, because the Word of God is profitable. Paul says, I'm desiring

00:30:34.779 --> 00:30:39.839
part of this ministry that's been entrusted to me is not only preaching Christ and warning

00:30:39.839 --> 00:30:46.419
every man, but teaching every man in all wisdom. You know that wisdom comes from God. We're

00:30:46.419 --> 00:30:52.659
not looking for sensual wisdom, we're looking for heavenly wisdom. The Bible tells us that

00:30:52.659 --> 00:30:56.659
if any man lack wisdom, let him ask of God, which giveth all men liberally and upbraideth

00:30:56.659 --> 00:31:02.819
not. We understand that Proverbs would speak much about the subject of wisdom and knowledge.

00:31:02.819 --> 00:31:08.739
I'm thankful that our God is the all-wise God, the omniscient God. And we find that

00:31:08.739 --> 00:31:14.699
Paul says that he's desiring here to teach every man. You don't need to turn there, but

00:31:14.699 --> 00:31:18.499
you might want to note it in your notes there if you're taking notes. Nehemiah chapter number

00:31:18.499 --> 00:31:25.819
8, and it's really a great outline for a simple outline that is so important and just precious

00:31:25.819 --> 00:31:32.619
with regard to the purpose and the model of preaching and teaching. In Nehemiah 8,

00:31:32.619 --> 00:31:37.179
the Bible speaks about how they came and they were teaching the Word of God. And in verse

00:31:37.179 --> 00:31:45.059
number 8, the Bible says, so they read in the book in the law of God distinctly. Listen,

00:31:45.059 --> 00:31:50.139
if a church ain't using the Bible, it is not a church worth going to. I'm being serious

00:31:50.139 --> 00:31:58.179
with you. It really doesn't matter what I think. My thoughts are not that important,

00:31:58.179 --> 00:32:04.539
honestly. It matters what God says. And there are a lot of churches in our nation and our

00:32:04.539 --> 00:32:11.419
world that have set aside the Word of God. No, no. It says in Nehemiah 8, in verse number

00:32:11.419 --> 00:32:19.939
8, so they read in the book in the law of God distinctly and gave the sense, explained

00:32:19.939 --> 00:32:26.579
it, taught it, and caused them, who's them? The listeners, those that were gathered,

00:32:26.579 --> 00:32:34.199
to understand the reading. What a great outline and model for teaching and preaching the Word

00:32:34.199 --> 00:32:42.379
of God. And Paul says, these three aspects of ministry whom we preach, warning every

00:32:42.379 --> 00:32:48.059
man and teaching every man in all wisdom, and we can ask ourselves, why, Paul? Why are

00:32:48.059 --> 00:32:53.939
you doing this? Paul, this is the reason that you're in the place that you're in.

00:32:53.939 --> 00:33:01.139
This is why you're suffering the way that you're suffering. Why is it? What is the goal?

00:33:01.139 --> 00:33:11.579
What is the purpose? Notice the end of verse number 28, that we may present every man perfect

00:33:11.579 --> 00:33:20.419
in Christ Jesus. What a great goal. What a great purpose of ministry. You could understand

00:33:20.419 --> 00:33:25.099
this morning as we look at this passage of Scripture and as Paul is explaining the ministry

00:33:25.099 --> 00:33:31.139
that God has entrusted, has enlisted him in, that as Paul would explain this to the believers

00:33:31.139 --> 00:33:36.699
in Colossae, that this varied greatly from those false teachers that were so active there

00:33:36.699 --> 00:33:42.339
in that region. They were not doing what they were doing so that they could present

00:33:42.339 --> 00:33:51.299
every man perfect in Christ Jesus, but Paul says, let me help you understand the ministry.

00:33:51.299 --> 00:33:55.379
Let me help you understand why I'm doing... First of all, I want to be a good steward

00:33:55.379 --> 00:34:03.739
of what God has entrusted to me. And here's what God has entrusted me with to preach Christ,

00:34:03.739 --> 00:34:13.619
to warn every man, to teach every man, so that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus.

00:34:13.619 --> 00:34:19.859
You'll notice in verse number 28 that the phrase every man is used three times. Isn't that precious?

00:34:19.859 --> 00:34:24.899
Paul was not seeking to just go and minister to some elite group of people. No, he's going

00:34:24.899 --> 00:34:31.099
to every man. I don't believe as I study the life of the Apostle Paul and trace the pages

00:34:31.099 --> 00:34:34.899
of Scripture and follow his life, I don't believe there was an individual that he was

00:34:34.899 --> 00:34:43.059
not willing to minister to. Every man. God is no respecter of persons. He told us to

00:34:43.059 --> 00:34:47.499
go and preach the gospel to every creature. And what a great privilege and blessing it

00:34:47.499 --> 00:34:56.179
is to preach Christ. And notice what he says, to present every man perfect in Christ Jesus.

00:34:56.179 --> 00:35:01.179
By the way, the only way for us to be perfect in Christ Jesus is to be saved. Remember as

00:35:01.179 --> 00:35:06.099
we studied there in the previous passage of Scripture in the book of Colossians, when

00:35:06.099 --> 00:35:10.259
he was speaking after he had shared with them how he was praying for them to know the will

00:35:10.259 --> 00:35:14.499
of God and to do the will of God, he spoke to them about rejoicing and thanking God for

00:35:14.499 --> 00:35:19.739
their salvation, their redemption. And he said this in verse number 12, giving thanks

00:35:19.739 --> 00:35:25.059
unto the Father which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints

00:35:25.059 --> 00:35:31.219
in life. And we said this, that it was God, it was Christ that qualified us for heaven.

00:35:31.219 --> 00:35:37.259
You can't qualify yourself for heaven and neither can I. But when I am washed in the

00:35:37.259 --> 00:35:43.059
blood, when I have trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as my personal Savior and His perfect

00:35:43.059 --> 00:35:49.619
righteousness has been imputed upon me, has been placed upon my account, I can stand perfect

00:35:49.619 --> 00:35:56.619
in Christ Jesus. It carries with it the idea of being complete. Complete. Notice what he

00:35:58.979 --> 00:36:02.619
says in Colossians 2 in verse number 10, the passage in which we've used as our theme for

00:36:02.619 --> 00:36:09.619
this year, and ye are complete in Him, which is the head of all principality and power.

00:36:10.939 --> 00:36:17.939
Paul says, my goal, the reason that I do what I do, the reason that I am perfect in Christ

00:36:19.739 --> 00:36:23.739
Jesus, the reason that I am seeking to fulfill this ministry that's been entrusted to me

00:36:23.739 --> 00:36:30.739
is because I desire to present every man perfect in Christ Jesus. You know, souls are dying.

00:36:31.419 --> 00:36:37.739
People often ask, why do you do the things you do? Why is it that you insist on making

00:36:37.739 --> 00:36:42.199
a big deal out of preaching the gospel? Why aren't you more involved in doing some other

00:36:42.199 --> 00:36:47.099
kind of community services and so on and so forth? If the community service doesn't include

00:36:47.419 --> 00:36:53.579
preaching Christ, we have fallen short of what our mission is. I'm not suggesting that

00:36:53.579 --> 00:36:57.979
we don't help someone. I'm not suggesting that we don't participate in that type of

00:36:57.979 --> 00:37:04.779
an activity, but if we neglect sharing Christ as part of that, we have missed what our purpose

00:37:04.779 --> 00:37:11.779
is. Amen? Anybody can give somebody some food, but only a saved person can give somebody

00:37:12.219 --> 00:37:18.099
the truth of the gospel. Again, I'm not suggesting, and for those that want to send me criticism

00:37:18.099 --> 00:37:22.939
online from watching online, the Lord bless you. I'll read your email. I probably won't

00:37:22.939 --> 00:37:29.419
respond. However, it's not our job to simply do those things. I'm not saying we shouldn't

00:37:29.419 --> 00:37:36.419
participate, but we must be careful to give the gospel because people are dying. People

00:37:36.859 --> 00:37:43.859
are dying. The only way for them to go to heaven is if they trust Christ as their Savior.

00:37:44.459 --> 00:37:49.939
We believe that, do we not? We don't believe all roads lead to heaven. We don't believe

00:37:49.939 --> 00:37:54.499
as long as you're sincere, you'll get to heaven. We don't believe be a good person. We don't

00:37:54.499 --> 00:38:01.059
believe if the priest gives you some rites before you die. No, no, we don't believe that.

00:38:01.059 --> 00:38:05.659
Salvation is only in one man, and that's the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God. There's

00:38:05.659 --> 00:38:12.139
no other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved. Paul says, this

00:38:12.139 --> 00:38:19.139
is what motivates me. This is what keeps me going. This is the ministry to preach Christ,

00:38:22.019 --> 00:38:28.339
to warn every man, to teach every man, so that we might present every man perfect in

00:38:28.339 --> 00:38:35.339
Christ Jesus. It's a unique ministry. It's a blessed ministry, and we find that there

00:38:35.539 --> 00:38:40.659
is consistency amongst the goal. We see Paul sharing this in verse 28 of chapter 1. We'll

00:38:40.659 --> 00:38:45.099
get to this in several months, but I want you to look over quickly at chapter 4 and

00:38:45.099 --> 00:38:50.859
verse 12. Paul is making his concluding remarks in this portion of Scripture, and he's beginning

00:38:50.859 --> 00:38:57.059
to speak again about Epaphras. Of course, this man was, as best we can tell, probably

00:38:57.059 --> 00:39:02.219
the pastor of this church in Colossae, and we find that the Bible would tell us about

00:39:02.219 --> 00:39:06.979
Epaphras. Notice in verse number 12 of Colossians 4, Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant

00:39:06.979 --> 00:39:13.979
of Christ, saluteth you. Notice what the Bible says, always laboring fervently. Isn't that

00:39:15.579 --> 00:39:22.579
some unique wording? Always laboring fervently for you in prayers. Why? That you may stand

00:39:22.579 --> 00:39:29.579
for you in prayers. Why? That you may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.

00:39:34.699 --> 00:39:40.619
Paul says, this ministry that's been given to me, that I've been enlisted in this ministry,

00:39:40.619 --> 00:39:45.059
as I would explain it to you, it's to make known Christ, it's to preach Christ, it's

00:39:45.059 --> 00:39:51.019
to warn every man, teach every man that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus.

00:39:51.019 --> 00:39:56.259
Now notice quickly with me, as we finish this morning, verse 29, Paul was enabled for

00:39:56.259 --> 00:40:00.739
the ministry. He understood that he was enlisted in the ministry. He was able to explain what

00:40:00.739 --> 00:40:01.739
the ministry is.

00:40:01.739 --> 00:40:02.999
that he had been given,

00:40:02.999 --> 00:40:05.379
and now he's going to share with these believers

00:40:05.379 --> 00:40:08.119
how he had been enabled for the ministry.

00:40:08.119 --> 00:40:08.959
In v. 29,

00:40:08.959 --> 00:40:12.699
"...whereunto I also labor,

00:40:12.699 --> 00:40:17.059
striving according to his working,

00:40:17.059 --> 00:40:20.939
which worketh in me mightily."

00:40:20.939 --> 00:40:22.799
Paul acknowledged that he could not

00:40:22.799 --> 00:40:25.299
fulfill the ministry in his own power,

00:40:25.299 --> 00:40:27.739
and he rejoiced in the power of God

00:40:27.739 --> 00:40:31.459
that was working in and through him.

00:40:31.459 --> 00:40:33.699
Jesus said to his disciples,

00:40:33.699 --> 00:40:36.519
without me, you can do nothing.

00:40:36.519 --> 00:40:39.519
He said to his disciples before he would ascend to heaven

00:40:39.519 --> 00:40:41.199
that they should receive power

00:40:41.199 --> 00:40:43.319
after the Holy Ghost has come upon you.

00:40:43.319 --> 00:40:45.199
Then you shall be witnesses unto me

00:40:45.199 --> 00:40:46.959
both in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria,

00:40:46.959 --> 00:40:48.519
the uttermost part of the earth.

00:40:48.519 --> 00:40:50.279
And we find that it's so imperative

00:40:50.279 --> 00:40:51.879
that we understand this morning

00:40:51.879 --> 00:40:55.399
that we do not seek to fulfill this ministry

00:40:55.399 --> 00:40:57.079
that has been given to us

00:40:57.079 --> 00:40:59.119
just as Paul would not seek to fulfill

00:40:59.119 --> 00:41:01.439
the ministry in his own power and his own strength,

00:41:01.439 --> 00:41:03.099
but that we do it through the power

00:41:03.099 --> 00:41:04.899
of the Holy Spirit of God

00:41:04.899 --> 00:41:07.699
through His enablement.

00:41:07.699 --> 00:41:11.019
It's an amazing truth of the Word of God

00:41:11.019 --> 00:41:14.759
that God would call us into the ministry,

00:41:14.759 --> 00:41:16.099
that He would enlist us,

00:41:16.099 --> 00:41:18.899
He would give us some level of responsibility

00:41:18.899 --> 00:41:21.339
in serving Him, of being His servant,

00:41:21.339 --> 00:41:25.059
and then He would equip us for service,

00:41:25.059 --> 00:41:28.419
and then He would reward us for serving Him.

00:41:28.419 --> 00:41:30.379
Isn't that amazing?

00:41:30.379 --> 00:41:31.599
He says, I'm going to call you to this,

00:41:31.599 --> 00:41:32.959
I'm going to explain to you how to do it,

00:41:32.959 --> 00:41:34.259
I'm going to enable you to do it,

00:41:34.259 --> 00:41:36.559
and then I'm going to reward you if you do it.

00:41:36.559 --> 00:41:38.179
It's amazing.

00:41:38.179 --> 00:41:40.279
And what a great privilege.

00:41:40.279 --> 00:41:41.599
Paul said, I know that in me

00:41:41.599 --> 00:41:44.519
that is in my flesh will have no good thing.

00:41:44.519 --> 00:41:47.919
But he knew that as he would be surrendered to God,

00:41:47.919 --> 00:41:51.019
as he would live that crucified life

00:41:51.019 --> 00:41:53.219
that he speaks of in Galatians 2 and verse number 20,

00:41:53.219 --> 00:41:55.839
as Christ would live in and through him

00:41:55.839 --> 00:41:59.599
and empower him for the work of the ministry.

00:41:59.599 --> 00:42:02.419
He's saying to these believers in Colossae,

00:42:02.419 --> 00:42:05.919
it is Christ in you, the hope of glory,

00:42:05.919 --> 00:42:07.819
but it's Christ in me, the Holy Spirit of God

00:42:07.819 --> 00:42:10.259
that enables me for this ministry.

00:42:10.259 --> 00:42:12.619
Paul, how can you rejoice in prison?

00:42:12.619 --> 00:42:15.539
How can you rejoice in your sufferings?

00:42:15.539 --> 00:42:17.339
Because of the power of God.

00:42:17.339 --> 00:42:18.939
Because of the power of God.

00:42:18.939 --> 00:42:20.779
Notice with me what Paul says

00:42:20.779 --> 00:42:23.779
back in 1 Corinthians 15.

00:42:23.779 --> 00:42:27.379
And we'll close with a passage in the book of 1 Peter.

00:42:27.379 --> 00:42:35.259
And look here at what Paul says in 1 Corinthians 15.

00:42:35.259 --> 00:42:37.679
Of course, we know this chapter in 1 Corinthians 15

00:42:37.679 --> 00:42:39.799
as being the great chapter of the resurrection

00:42:39.799 --> 00:42:41.559
and what a great chapter it is.

00:42:41.559 --> 00:42:43.559
And so thankful for the passage.

00:42:43.559 --> 00:42:45.319
It's a lengthy passage of Scripture,

00:42:45.319 --> 00:42:48.239
but how powerful and impactful it is.

00:42:48.239 --> 00:42:50.359
Notice what Paul says of himself

00:42:50.359 --> 00:42:51.919
in verse number 9.

00:42:51.919 --> 00:42:54.599
He says, for I am the least of the apostles,

00:42:54.599 --> 00:42:56.399
that I'm not meant to be called an apostle

00:42:56.419 --> 00:42:59.539
because I persecuted the church of God.

00:42:59.539 --> 00:43:02.859
But by the grace of God, I am what I am.

00:43:02.859 --> 00:43:04.859
And His grace which was bestowed upon me

00:43:04.859 --> 00:43:06.419
was not in vain,

00:43:06.419 --> 00:43:08.619
but I labored more abundantly than they all.

00:43:08.619 --> 00:43:11.179
Yet not I, but the grace of God

00:43:11.179 --> 00:43:12.659
which was with me.

00:43:12.659 --> 00:43:13.819
He says, I am what I am.

00:43:13.819 --> 00:43:16.179
He says, but by the grace of God, I am what I am.

00:43:16.179 --> 00:43:18.259
Christ working in and through him

00:43:18.259 --> 00:43:22.419
and the power, the enabling for the ministry.

00:43:22.419 --> 00:43:24.019
And here's the wonderful thing this morning

00:43:24.039 --> 00:43:26.919
as we look at Paul rehearsing and explaining

00:43:26.919 --> 00:43:29.919
to the believers in Colossae about his ministry

00:43:29.919 --> 00:43:32.119
and how he had been enlisted into the ministry.

00:43:32.119 --> 00:43:33.879
And as he explains the ministry

00:43:33.879 --> 00:43:36.559
and then speaks about how he was enabled for the ministry.

00:43:36.559 --> 00:43:39.119
This morning, each of us have been given

00:43:39.119 --> 00:43:41.099
a responsibility to serve Christ.

00:43:43.319 --> 00:43:47.979
Our task will vary, but our goal is to please God.

00:43:49.119 --> 00:43:51.599
And we find that as our individual tasks

00:43:51.599 --> 00:43:54.419
would vary based upon the spiritual gifts

00:43:54.419 --> 00:43:57.019
that have been given to us,

00:43:57.019 --> 00:43:58.859
that as we would seek to fulfill those,

00:43:58.859 --> 00:44:00.819
we'd understand that I've been enlisted.

00:44:00.819 --> 00:44:04.659
I'm a soldier in the army.

00:44:04.659 --> 00:44:08.039
We sing and talk about being a soldier in the army.

00:44:09.139 --> 00:44:12.339
And we are soldiers in the Lord's army.

00:44:12.339 --> 00:44:14.459
And as a soldier in the Lord's army,

00:44:14.459 --> 00:44:15.459
I've been enlisted.

00:44:15.459 --> 00:44:19.239
I hope that we can explain why we do the things that we do.

00:44:19.239 --> 00:44:20.079
People have asked me,

00:44:20.779 --> 00:44:24.539
why do you care if I get saved?

00:44:24.539 --> 00:44:26.199
What does it matter to you?

00:44:27.279 --> 00:44:30.099
The real answer is that it doesn't do anything for me

00:44:30.099 --> 00:44:31.439
if you get saved or not.

00:44:32.479 --> 00:44:33.879
Because I'm going to heaven.

00:44:34.879 --> 00:44:35.999
Amen?

00:44:35.999 --> 00:44:37.659
And if I've given you the gospel,

00:44:37.659 --> 00:44:39.859
I fulfilled my responsibility.

00:44:40.719 --> 00:44:42.599
But I want you to be able to spend eternity

00:44:42.599 --> 00:44:43.819
in heaven as well.

00:44:44.699 --> 00:44:46.299
Because I know that the Bible says

00:44:46.299 --> 00:44:49.419
there's only two places, heaven and the lake of fire.

00:44:50.459 --> 00:44:53.139
And so what is it that would cause us

00:44:53.139 --> 00:44:54.439
to continue to press on?

00:44:54.439 --> 00:44:56.859
And no, it's not that we're going to get anything,

00:44:56.859 --> 00:44:59.979
that there's any advantage to us personally.

00:44:59.979 --> 00:45:02.099
But we understand the stakes are high.

00:45:03.779 --> 00:45:06.019
And then we understand that we too

00:45:06.019 --> 00:45:08.679
have been enabled for the ministry.

00:45:09.739 --> 00:45:11.639
Look over in 1 Peter 4 if you will.

00:45:11.639 --> 00:45:13.559
We'll close here.

00:45:13.559 --> 00:45:15.399
In 1 Peter 4,

00:45:17.099 --> 00:45:19.259
we mentioned earlier about verse 12

00:45:19.259 --> 00:45:21.559
where he speaks about that fiery trial.

00:45:21.559 --> 00:45:22.739
But in the preceding verses,

00:45:22.739 --> 00:45:24.799
he's going to speak to these believers

00:45:24.799 --> 00:45:27.819
about their ministry.

00:45:32.799 --> 00:45:35.159
We find that Paul was enabled for the ministry

00:45:35.159 --> 00:45:37.279
and he speaks to the believers in Colossae about that

00:45:37.279 --> 00:45:39.239
and we too have been enabled.

00:45:39.239 --> 00:45:40.799
It says here in verse number 10

00:45:40.799 --> 00:45:43.399
of 1 Peter 4,

00:45:43.399 --> 00:45:46.679
as every man hath received the gift,

00:45:47.679 --> 00:45:50.639
he's speaking to believers.

00:45:50.639 --> 00:45:52.019
If you've been saved this morning,

00:45:52.019 --> 00:45:54.059
if you've trusted Christ as your Savior,

00:45:54.059 --> 00:45:55.699
on the authority of the Word of God,

00:45:55.699 --> 00:45:58.539
you've been given a spiritual gift.

00:45:58.539 --> 00:46:00.459
If you say I have no idea what it is,

00:46:00.459 --> 00:46:02.539
please talk to me because you should find out what it is

00:46:02.539 --> 00:46:03.619
because if you don't know what it is,

00:46:03.619 --> 00:46:06.599
you're not using it.

00:46:06.599 --> 00:46:10.019
And you've been given it to use

00:46:10.019 --> 00:46:12.379
for the glory of God.

00:46:12.379 --> 00:46:14.619
It says here, as every man hath received the gift,

00:46:14.619 --> 00:46:20.159
even so, minister the same one to another.

00:46:20.159 --> 00:46:21.439
Notice what it says,

00:46:21.439 --> 00:46:25.639
as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.

00:46:25.639 --> 00:46:26.999
See, that's what Paul understood.

00:46:26.999 --> 00:46:28.619
He understood the dispensation of God.

00:46:28.619 --> 00:46:30.879
This stewardship that's been given to him

00:46:30.879 --> 00:46:33.279
in Colossians 1 that we spoke about earlier.

00:46:33.279 --> 00:46:35.039
And we find that it says here

00:46:35.039 --> 00:46:36.759
that Peter's saying that as we minister

00:46:36.759 --> 00:46:37.759
the same one to another,

00:46:37.759 --> 00:46:41.399
as good stewards of the manifold grace of God,

00:46:41.399 --> 00:46:43.199
if any man speak,

00:46:43.219 --> 00:46:45.859
let him speak as the oracles of God.

00:46:45.859 --> 00:46:48.579
If any man minister, notice this phrase,

00:46:48.579 --> 00:46:53.379
let him do it as of the ability

00:46:53.379 --> 00:46:57.619
which God giveth,

00:46:57.619 --> 00:47:00.619
that God in all things may be glorified

00:47:00.619 --> 00:47:02.699
through Jesus Christ to whom be praise

00:47:02.699 --> 00:47:05.019
and dominion forever and ever.

00:47:05.019 --> 00:47:06.339
Amen.

00:47:06.339 --> 00:47:08.179
It's all for the glory of God.

00:47:08.179 --> 00:47:11.939
But we minister, it says here,

00:47:11.959 --> 00:47:14.799
let him do it as of the ability which God giveth.

00:47:14.799 --> 00:47:16.639
You know, God enables you.

00:47:16.639 --> 00:47:19.439
He gives you the ability to serve him.

00:47:19.439 --> 00:47:22.159
You know, when we minister,

00:47:22.159 --> 00:47:23.519
there's only so many spiritual gifts

00:47:23.519 --> 00:47:28.479
and we're not in competition one with another.

00:47:28.479 --> 00:47:31.059
We're seeking to do the ministry

00:47:31.059 --> 00:47:34.199
as God has enabled us,

00:47:34.199 --> 00:47:39.039
as of the ability that God giveth.

00:47:39.039 --> 00:47:41.239
And the problem in Corinth,

00:47:41.899 --> 00:47:42.739
because there's a whole lot of them,

00:47:42.739 --> 00:47:44.699
so I shouldn't say the problem because there's a lot,

00:47:44.699 --> 00:47:46.739
but one of the problems in Corinth

00:47:46.739 --> 00:47:49.499
is that they were comparing themselves among themselves.

00:47:52.339 --> 00:47:54.559
Paul says, it's not wise.

00:47:55.859 --> 00:47:57.479
See, because I'm not in competition with you,

00:47:57.479 --> 00:47:59.779
you're not in competition with me.

00:47:59.779 --> 00:48:02.099
We're doing it as of the ability that God gives.

00:48:02.099 --> 00:48:05.419
We understand and recognize the manifold grace of God

00:48:05.419 --> 00:48:08.539
that's been given to us in his enabling.

00:48:08.539 --> 00:48:13.499
And we seek that in all things he would be glorified.

00:48:13.499 --> 00:48:16.239
And Paul explains this ministry

00:48:16.239 --> 00:48:19.559
that God had given him to the believers in Colossae.

00:48:19.559 --> 00:48:21.019
And I hope this morning

00:48:21.019 --> 00:48:23.359
that not only would we have a better understanding

00:48:23.359 --> 00:48:25.439
maybe of Paul's perspective,

00:48:25.439 --> 00:48:26.799
but that we would understand this morning

00:48:26.799 --> 00:48:29.359
that we too have been given a ministry.

00:48:29.359 --> 00:48:32.359
We too have been given a responsibility.

00:48:32.359 --> 00:48:34.719
And I hope that we could explain it.

00:48:34.719 --> 00:48:36.279
And I hope that we'd understand this morning

00:48:36.279 --> 00:48:38.479
that it's not my power,

00:48:39.379 --> 00:48:40.819
it's in Christ in me

00:48:41.739 --> 00:48:44.019
and how he works in and through us

00:48:44.019 --> 00:48:46.499
as we are filled with and controlled

00:48:46.499 --> 00:48:48.059
by the Holy Spirit of God.

00:48:49.259 --> 00:48:51.899
Paul was a faithful servant of the Lord.

00:48:53.659 --> 00:48:56.579
And he understood that because of his faithful service

00:48:56.579 --> 00:48:58.699
to the Lord, that there were some rewards for him.

00:48:58.699 --> 00:49:01.879
He speaks of that in 2 Timothy chapter number four.

00:49:01.879 --> 00:49:05.339
This morning, sometimes we hold Paul up and say,

00:49:05.339 --> 00:49:06.419
oh, look at Paul.

00:49:07.399 --> 00:49:09.239
Paul said he is the chief of sinners.

00:49:10.439 --> 00:49:11.699
But if we would be,

00:49:15.159 --> 00:49:19.279
if we would understand and we would be as willing

00:49:19.279 --> 00:49:23.319
as Paul was to just surrender to God,

00:49:23.319 --> 00:49:28.319
say, Lord, use me, use me for your honor and for your glory.

00:49:28.519 --> 00:49:30.319
I believe this morning that he will.

00:49:31.319 --> 00:49:33.399
And if we say to the Lord,

00:49:33.399 --> 00:49:36.079
as Paul did when he was still Saul,

00:49:36.739 --> 00:49:41.739
Lord, what will thou have me to do?

00:49:43.099 --> 00:49:45.179
God will reveal it to us

00:49:45.179 --> 00:49:47.659
and he'll use us for his honor and his glory

00:49:47.659 --> 00:49:49.619
so that souls might be saved,

00:49:49.619 --> 00:49:54.259
so that the gospel of Jesus Christ would go far and wide.

00:49:54.259 --> 00:49:56.299
And that's our responsibility.

00:49:56.299 --> 00:49:57.339
And what a great joy.

00:49:57.339 --> 00:49:58.179
Let's pray.

00:49:58.179 --> 00:49:59.179
Father, we love you.

00:49:59.179 --> 00:50:01.059
We thank you for loving us.

00:50:01.059 --> 00:50:02.379
We thank you for the work.

00:50:02.379 --> 00:50:10.019
of God, the truth contained therein, Lord, I pray that this morning you've helped us.

00:50:10.019 --> 00:50:16.579
We've had just a few moments to examine this portion of Scripture and understand the ministry

00:50:16.579 --> 00:50:20.779
that you gave to the Apostle Paul.

00:50:20.779 --> 00:50:24.619
We're thankful for his example and for his testimony.

00:50:24.619 --> 00:50:26.579
We're challenged by it.

00:50:26.579 --> 00:50:34.779
And I pray, God, that this morning you would help us to have like perspective, desiring

00:50:34.779 --> 00:50:38.499
to fulfill that which you have called us to do.

00:50:38.499 --> 00:50:42.339
It's our desire that you alone would be glorified.

00:50:42.339 --> 00:50:48.539
We do not seek the applause of man, the recognition of man.

00:50:48.539 --> 00:50:53.299
We seek that you alone would be exalted.

00:50:53.299 --> 00:50:57.499
I pray that in these few moments of invitation that you'd have your will in way, if there's

00:50:57.499 --> 00:51:02.219
one amongst us that does not know you as their personal Lord and Savior, they've never trusted

00:51:02.219 --> 00:51:03.739
Christ as their Savior.

00:51:03.739 --> 00:51:08.979
It's our prayer this morning that they would trust Christ, that they'd get it settled.

00:51:08.979 --> 00:51:13.979
Perhaps there's one this morning that has struggled with the idea of their service for

00:51:13.979 --> 00:51:16.019
you.

00:51:16.019 --> 00:51:20.579
Where it is that they could get involved and fulfill the work that you have called them

00:51:20.579 --> 00:51:21.779
to do.

00:51:22.259 --> 00:51:30.819
Lord, I pray that you would give them clarity and direction.

00:51:30.819 --> 00:51:34.939
Perhaps there's some amongst us that need to just fully surrender.

00:51:34.939 --> 00:51:36.099
I surrender all.

00:51:36.099 --> 00:51:39.499
Lord, what would thou have me to do?

00:51:39.499 --> 00:51:42.499
Maybe there's a young person, maybe an older person.

00:51:42.499 --> 00:51:47.339
God, you've been working in their heart and life about ministry, full-time ministry, missions

00:51:47.339 --> 00:51:49.619
or some other aspect of ministry.

00:51:50.379 --> 00:51:53.499
Oh God, I pray that you'd work and move.

00:51:53.499 --> 00:51:56.619
You said that the harvest is plenteous, but the labors are few.

00:51:56.619 --> 00:52:00.019
Pray therefore, Lord of the harvest, that you would send forth laborers.

00:52:00.019 --> 00:52:05.979
God, perhaps you'd call one from our midst to serve you in that capacity.

00:52:05.979 --> 00:52:08.979
Oh, how we would rejoice.

00:52:08.979 --> 00:52:11.459
I pray that you'd have your will in way, for it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:52:11.459 --> 00:52:12.459
Would you stand with me?

00:52:12.459 --> 00:52:14.139
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

00:52:14.139 --> 00:52:17.019
Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano.

00:52:17.019 --> 00:52:23.859
During this time, it's our way of closing a service to give you an opportunity to respond

00:52:23.859 --> 00:52:25.499
to the Word of God.

00:52:25.499 --> 00:52:29.339
If you want to use your pew as an altar, feel free to do so.

00:52:29.339 --> 00:52:33.539
If you want to come to this old-fashioned altar, as Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
