00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.460
If you would to pray for the summer door family and Kimberly's grandfather went home to be with the Lord this morning

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:11.539
And so that was brother Dave some of our dad and so if you would pray for the family

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:16.540
I know they would certainly appreciate that. I've had some communication with the summer door last night and then again today

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.620
And so if you would pray for them, I know they would certainly appreciate that

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.959
we thank the Lord for the truth of heaven amen and

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.659
To be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord and brother summer

00:00:28.219 --> 00:00:34.740
Saved man, and so we saw or not as others which have no hope first Thessalonians chapter number five this evening

00:00:35.259 --> 00:00:37.599
first Thessalonians chapter number five

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.139
And they'll be looking at verse number 14 once again

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:47.380
And as we've started a series seven weeks ago now looking at the instruction

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.979
That's provided at the end of the book of first Thessalonians

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:55.580
and then we'll also move over to the end of the book of second Thessalonians and to this model church a

00:00:55.779 --> 00:01:00.500
Good church a serving church a a church that believed in

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:08.180
Practiced what New Testament churches are to do we find that they receive instruction as I've mentioned multiple times

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:15.620
The instruction is concise and it is applicable and I am thankful that God's Word is profitable for us

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.980
I'm thankful that it is easy to understand and apply in our lives

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.180
I hope that as we've studied here tonight being lesson number seven

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.220
I hope that we have been active in applying these principles in our lives

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.860
We find that as we come this evening to the fourth commandment really that is found in verse number 14

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.739
We find that it begins with this exhortation now

00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:47.300
We exhort you remember verse 12 it started with and we beseech you and now we find in verse 14 now we exhort you brethren

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:51.980
Remember, he says warn them that are unruly comfort the feeble-minded

00:01:52.699 --> 00:01:57.500
Support the weak and then this evening. We'll look at this thought be patient

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.139
Toward all men as we begin to think about these

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.339
Instructions that God gives in this portion of Scripture. We find that these

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:13.660
Instructions require that we would be engaged in other words. There's some action that we need to take

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:17.460
There's something we need to do when we think about those that are unruly

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:24.419
They need to be warned and that's an action. That's an active. It's not a passive type of thing

00:02:24.419 --> 00:02:27.619
It's an active involvement warning those that are unruly

00:02:28.179 --> 00:02:34.820
Comforting those that are feeble-minded those that are easily discouraged those that have little faith if you will that we would be

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:39.500
Encouraging them that we would be comforting them and then as we looked at last week

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.259
Supporting the weak and we said this that some might be weak physically

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:45.839
But we're really most concerned about those that would be weak

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:52.220
spiritually and some are weak spiritually just because they're new babes in Christ and they're just growing and they're

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.619
They're not mature believers

00:02:54.619 --> 00:03:02.380
and we need to come alongside them and and support them and help them grow and be involved in that process of

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:08.259
discipleship and we find that there are some that are weak spiritually because they're just not growing and

00:03:08.779 --> 00:03:13.699
They've not taken heed remember as Paul writes to those in the book of Hebrews

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:19.500
He said at the time that you ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you and so he was not speaking that

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.500
to really

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:29.059
Commending them for that. He was correcting them for that as we look at the verse this evening and look at the last phrase

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:32.500
Verse number 14 when the Bible says be patient

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:34.500
Toward all men

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:40.380
I've used that as the title this evening just as I have with each of these thoughts over the last several weeks and begin to

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.220
Think about this verse of Scripture and these instructions and we come to this final one

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.220
It's probably the most complicated

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:54.380
As we would understand this truth of be patient toward all men. Have you ever witnessed someone who lacked patience?

00:03:55.899 --> 00:04:02.100
No doubt you've you've witnessed someone that's lacked patience. Let me ask you this. Have you ever lacked patience?

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:03.940
Sure, we have

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.699
Sure, we have right and we could ask ourselves that this way this evening

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:14.619
Is it even possible that we could be patient toward all men that we could be patient toward people?

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.459
Because some people say this have you ever heard someone say this people drive me crazy

00:04:19.059 --> 00:04:23.739
People annoy me people bother me you hear people make those types of statements

00:04:24.739 --> 00:04:30.179
Unfortunately, and I've said it from this pulpit before I seek to correct it when I hear somebody in ministry

00:04:30.179 --> 00:04:32.140
Say it because it really bothers me

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:39.140
but I've heard many people over the years that are in ministry say something like this the ministry would be great if it wasn't for

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:44.940
people and I cannot stand that comment and here's why there's no ministry if there's no people and

00:04:45.299 --> 00:04:53.179
I believe that the person that would make that statement needs to really evaluate themselves and get in line with the scripture

00:04:53.619 --> 00:04:58.739
And not have that perspective. I understand that at times some are trying to be funny

00:04:58.739 --> 00:05:00.459
I don't think it's a laughing matter

00:05:00.459 --> 00:05:07.660
I think it's a serious thing in this evening when we begin to look at this statement when the Bible says be patient toward all

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:08.540
men

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.540
understand with me that God never

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:17.700
Instructs us his children to do something that he will not enable us to be able to do

00:05:17.899 --> 00:05:20.739
He does not give us commands. He does not give us instructions

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:25.019
That we are incapable of fulfilling now

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:30.019
I might not be capable of fulfilling it in my own power and my own strength in our own

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:37.220
Flesh in fact in my flesh and probably in your flesh as well. We're not gonna be patient toward all men

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:38.859
Amen

00:05:38.859 --> 00:05:43.540
but through the help of God with God's grace and with his help with the power of

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:48.059
The Holy Spirit of God as we are commanded to be filled with the Spirit of God

00:05:48.299 --> 00:05:52.339
We're commanded to walk in the Spirit so that we do not fulfill the lust of the flesh

00:05:52.540 --> 00:06:00.260
Then we find that God would enable us to be able to fulfill the instruction that he gives to be patient

00:06:00.739 --> 00:06:02.100
toward all

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.380
men

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.140
The word patient means to be long-suffering

00:06:06.339 --> 00:06:10.260
It means to be slow to anger not easily provoked

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:15.540
It carries with it the idea of being calm under the sufferance of injuries or offenses

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:19.260
it also carries with it the idea of not being revengeful and

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.100
And here God says

00:06:22.859 --> 00:06:24.820
Be patient

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:29.100
Toward all men. Why would God tell us that because God knows us?

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:35.019
Amen, God's the one that created us and he knows the sinful condition of man

00:06:35.019 --> 00:06:37.019
Of course after the garden the fall of man

00:06:37.019 --> 00:06:44.059
He understands and the reality is that many of us struggle in the area of being patient or being long-suffering

00:06:45.059 --> 00:06:50.420
Some have said and maybe you've heard it maybe you've said it you should never pray for patience

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:55.779
You ever hear somebody say that maybe you've been guilty of saying that I've heard preachers say you shouldn't pray for patience

00:06:55.899 --> 00:06:59.940
Because then the trials come and that's how God's gonna help you get patience

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:05.940
I've heard people say that and the reality is that the the truth as we look at the word patient and

00:07:06.299 --> 00:07:10.260
Understanding that it means to be long-suffering. It is a it's it's

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:17.339
Described as we look at Galatians 5 in fact turned there as the fruit of the Spirit notice in Galatians 5

00:07:17.339 --> 00:07:21.859
and as I look at the truth in Galatians 5 when the Bible says the fruit of

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:24.140
the Spirit now

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:26.260
It does not say but the fruits

00:07:26.899 --> 00:07:30.500
plural of the Spirit it says but the fruit of

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:32.739
the Spirit now

00:07:32.739 --> 00:07:36.619
I believe that that's important for us to understand because as the

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:43.100
Next phrase is given to us and all of these words are given in verse 22 and 23 of Galatians 5

00:07:43.339 --> 00:07:46.059
We find that the fruit of the Spirit is

00:07:46.779 --> 00:07:52.980
Described with all of these words these terms. It's not that I have the fruit of the Spirit

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:57.739
I just don't have that one. Do you understand what I'm saying? And so we find here this evening

00:07:57.739 --> 00:08:00.579
This is the fruit of the Spirit. Have you ever described something?

00:08:00.579 --> 00:08:04.660
maybe you've used a number of of words and describing something you had a

00:08:05.299 --> 00:08:09.579
Good dinner and you used a number of words to describe that dinner

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:13.019
But it's all describing the same piece of meat or the same

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:18.899
Side salad that you had or whatever. It might be and here we find this is but the fruit of the Spirit is

00:08:20.179 --> 00:08:21.619
love

00:08:21.619 --> 00:08:23.019
joy

00:08:23.019 --> 00:08:26.019
Peace notice what it says long

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:31.380
Suffering you see it. They're not making it up. It's right there in verse 22

00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:34.179
gentleness goodness

00:08:34.179 --> 00:08:35.659
faith

00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:36.859
meekness

00:08:36.859 --> 00:08:41.700
Temperance against such there is no law in verse number 16

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:47.580
It says this I say then walk in the Spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:53.059
And then God gives us this wonderful truth in verse 17 that all of us have proven to be

00:08:53.739 --> 00:08:58.979
Absolutely true. The Bible says the flesh lusteth against the spirit

00:08:58.979 --> 00:09:00.460
Have you experienced that in your life?

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:06.659
The flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and these are notice what it says

00:09:07.179 --> 00:09:09.979
Contrary the one to the other

00:09:10.539 --> 00:09:13.700
So that you cannot do the things that you would remember Paul

00:09:13.739 --> 00:09:19.500
He says the things that I would I do not the things that I would not that I do and we find here that he

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:22.059
Says but the fruit of the Spirit were to walk in the spirit

00:09:22.059 --> 00:09:24.900
So we do not fulfill the lust of the flesh in verse 16

00:09:25.299 --> 00:09:32.820
The fruit of the Spirit is described in verse 22 in verse 23 and then the Bible says in verse 24 and they that are

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:35.460
Christ noticed have crucified what?

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:37.659
the flesh

00:09:37.659 --> 00:09:42.460
With the affections and lust if we live in the spirit

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:45.500
Let us also walk in the spirit

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:52.219
And so we find as we look at this truth of be patient toward all men that it's we're not going to be patient

00:09:52.219 --> 00:09:56.460
Toward all men in our own power own strength and your flesh and in my flesh

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:59.979
We must be filled with the Spirit of God. We must walk

00:09:59.979 --> 00:10:04.859
in the Spirit. We find that the Bible tells us, we begin to understand here

00:10:04.859 --> 00:10:09.159
where it says, love, joy, peace, long-suffering, and we think about the

00:10:09.159 --> 00:10:13.579
truth of charity or love. You know what the Bible says in 1 Corinthians 13

00:10:13.579 --> 00:10:19.139
about love or charity? It says this, charity suffereth long. You know what

00:10:19.139 --> 00:10:24.099
that word is? It's the same word that's translated long-suffering. Same word.

00:10:24.099 --> 00:10:28.419
Charity in 1 Corinthians 13 and verse number 4 is described this way, it

00:10:28.419 --> 00:10:35.979
suffereth long. You know we're instructed to love one another. John 13

00:10:35.979 --> 00:10:40.659
records it this way, if you would turn there in John 13. The Bible says this,

00:10:40.659 --> 00:10:45.379
Jesus of course as we know is going to provide this command after he'd washed

00:10:45.379 --> 00:10:49.859
the feet of the disciples and then of course he's explaining to them about his

00:10:49.859 --> 00:10:53.739
soon going to the cross of Calvary and all the things that are going to take

00:10:53.739 --> 00:11:00.939
place and he says this in verse number 34 of John chapter 13, he says a new

00:11:00.939 --> 00:11:07.139
commandment I give unto you. What is this? That you love one another as I have

00:11:07.139 --> 00:11:12.499
loved you that you also love one another. So we understand that we're to love as

00:11:12.499 --> 00:11:18.099
Christ loved and he says this in verse 35, by this, by what? By this love that we

00:11:18.139 --> 00:11:23.699
have one toward another. By this shall all men know that you are my disciples

00:11:23.699 --> 00:11:29.739
if you have love one to another. We find that the Bible tells us that Jesus gives

00:11:29.739 --> 00:11:33.859
this command that we're to love one another. We find that the Bible tells us

00:11:33.859 --> 00:11:37.619
if you want to jot it down we won't turn there but in 1 Peter 4 and verse

00:11:37.619 --> 00:11:43.459
number 8 the Bible says that we're to have fervent charity among yourselves.

00:11:43.619 --> 00:11:48.299
Fervent charity, this love, but the Bible describes charity or love in 1

00:11:48.299 --> 00:11:53.939
Corinthians 13 as it suffereth long. And so this evening as we begin to

00:11:53.939 --> 00:11:59.299
understand and try to unwrap if you will this truth that is given to us in

00:11:59.299 --> 00:12:04.499
1 Thessalonians 5 and verse number 14 where the Bible says be patient toward

00:12:04.499 --> 00:12:09.579
all men. I think honestly tonight if we'd each be transparent and honest this is

00:12:09.579 --> 00:12:14.099
an area in which we struggle with. People can really kind of get on our

00:12:14.099 --> 00:12:19.739
nerves, right? I mean be transparent tonight don't leave me up here on an

00:12:19.739 --> 00:12:24.699
island by myself, amen? And the reality is people can, they can be annoying from

00:12:24.699 --> 00:12:30.739
time to time. I can be annoying, amen? You can be annoying. We all can but but he

00:12:30.739 --> 00:12:38.339
says be patient toward all men. I want to go over and consider an example that we

00:12:38.339 --> 00:12:43.099
read of in Matthew chapter 18. Look in Matthew 18 if you will with me tonight

00:12:43.099 --> 00:12:47.859
and here's the reality and begin to think about this instruction where the

00:12:47.859 --> 00:12:53.819
Bible says be patient toward all men. We could find ourselves if we're not

00:12:53.819 --> 00:12:57.579
careful being patient with certain people and then lacking patience with

00:12:57.579 --> 00:13:03.699
others. We could find ourselves in a position where we desire for others to

00:13:03.739 --> 00:13:09.979
be patient toward us while we are not demonstrating patience toward others. But

00:13:09.979 --> 00:13:13.259
again we must recognize and we must understand that this is not something

00:13:13.259 --> 00:13:16.499
that you're going to conjure up in your own flesh. It's not something that you're

00:13:16.499 --> 00:13:19.819
just gonna, you know, sometimes oh well they're just patient. I mean they were

00:13:19.819 --> 00:13:26.819
just blessed with patience. Be patient toward all men. It's a command but I can

00:13:26.819 --> 00:13:31.739
only do it through the help of God and we find that the fruit of the Holy

00:13:31.859 --> 00:13:34.939
Spirit is described as being long-suffering. Notice with me in

00:13:34.939 --> 00:13:40.419
Matthew 18 and we're gonna pick it up in verse 21. Notice what the Bible says.

00:13:40.419 --> 00:13:45.699
Then came Peter to him and said, Lord how off shall my brother sin against me and

00:13:45.699 --> 00:13:52.699
I forgive him till seven times. Now honestly what Peter is saying here was

00:13:52.699 --> 00:13:59.019
looked at by that particular era and those others that would be in that

00:13:59.019 --> 00:14:04.859
arena of time and culture. Really he was being quite generous and saying till

00:14:04.859 --> 00:14:09.299
seven times because it was only thought that maybe two or three times you might

00:14:09.299 --> 00:14:13.739
forgive someone. But Peter says till seven times and Jesus says we are

00:14:13.739 --> 00:14:19.219
familiar. I say not unto thee until seven times but until seventy times seven. You

00:14:19.219 --> 00:14:23.419
see that in verse 22. Now I've said this before and you understand this. It is not

00:14:23.419 --> 00:14:28.619
the idea that Jesus was teaching that you keep a record book and when they get

00:14:28.619 --> 00:14:33.539
to 490 offenses you're off the hook. You don't have to forgive him anymore, right?

00:14:33.539 --> 00:14:38.419
That's not the idea. By the way I'm thankful that my God and your God

00:14:38.419 --> 00:14:43.699
forgives. Notice what he says in verse 23. Therefore is the kingdom of heaven

00:14:43.699 --> 00:14:48.339
likened to a certain king which would take account of his servants and when he

00:14:48.339 --> 00:14:55.779
had begun to reckon one was brought unto him which owed him ten thousand talents.

00:14:56.339 --> 00:15:02.019
Now really this particular amount that is mentioned in verse 24 is really

00:15:02.019 --> 00:15:07.099
beyond the ability to ever repay and the Bible says that this is what he owed but

00:15:07.099 --> 00:15:12.099
for as much notice in verse 25 as he had not to pay, he had no way to pay, it says

00:15:12.099 --> 00:15:17.339
his Lord commanded him to be sold and his wife and children and all that he had in

00:15:17.339 --> 00:15:22.739
payment to be made. The reality is that even if they were sold that it would not

00:15:22.859 --> 00:15:27.819
satisfy the entirety of the debt but we find that that would have been within

00:15:27.819 --> 00:15:35.979
the rights legally to do. And I want you to notice in verse 26 the Bible says

00:15:35.979 --> 00:15:41.979
this, the servant therefore fell down and worshipped him saying, look, notice what he says,

00:15:41.979 --> 00:15:56.739
Lord have what? Have patience with me and I will pay thee all. Now I really don't

00:15:56.739 --> 00:15:59.779
think he ever would have been able to pay all when you understand the amount

00:15:59.779 --> 00:16:04.059
of ten thousand talents but we find that really what I want to focus on this

00:16:04.059 --> 00:16:08.299
evening as we look at this thought of be patient toward all men is that this man

00:16:08.299 --> 00:16:12.139
understanding his circumstances, understanding the condition, understanding

00:16:12.139 --> 00:16:23.299
what was at stake, he falls down and he says have patience with me. No doubt we

00:16:23.299 --> 00:16:28.059
can relate with this man where we want others to be patient with us. Just be

00:16:28.059 --> 00:16:34.819
patient. Notice verse 27, then the Lord of that servant was moved with compassion.

00:16:35.819 --> 00:16:43.259
Notice what the Bible says, and loosed him and forgave him the debt. Isn't that

00:16:43.259 --> 00:16:49.059
amazing? But I want you to see this is an interesting passage of

00:16:49.059 --> 00:16:55.979
Scripture that helps us to see really the tendency of humanity. The same

00:16:55.979 --> 00:16:59.059
servant, you notice it says the same servant, right? Is that what your Bible

00:16:59.059 --> 00:17:03.899
says? The same servant. So this one that just had this situation unfold in his

00:17:03.939 --> 00:17:08.219
life, this situation where ten thousand talents are owed, he cannot pay, it's

00:17:08.219 --> 00:17:12.979
impossible. The master says okay we're gonna sell you and your family and we're

00:17:12.979 --> 00:17:16.899
gonna take care of the debt and he says he falls on his knees as Lord be

00:17:16.899 --> 00:17:23.019
patient with me. This same servant that was forgiven where the Bible says that

00:17:23.019 --> 00:17:27.819
he had compassion, the Lord, the master had compassion and loosed him and

00:17:27.819 --> 00:17:32.659
forgave him the debt. The Bible says that the same servant went out and what does

00:17:32.659 --> 00:17:41.539
he do? Well he finds his fellow servant which owed him a hundred pence. A hundred

00:17:41.539 --> 00:17:48.139
pence is nothing compared to ten thousand talents. I mean just a very

00:17:48.139 --> 00:17:54.419
insignificant amount compared to the ten thousand talents. And I want you to

00:17:54.419 --> 00:18:01.179
notice that the Bible says that he, this same servant that had just experienced

00:18:02.139 --> 00:18:07.539
he laid hands on him. On who? On this fellow servant that owed him a hundred

00:18:07.539 --> 00:18:13.339
pence and he took him by the throat. Notice what he said, pay me that thou

00:18:13.339 --> 00:18:18.379
owest. And I want you to see it. Many of us are familiar with this but I want you

00:18:18.379 --> 00:18:22.339
to see it and I hope it will help us today. The Bible says that his fellow

00:18:22.339 --> 00:18:28.739
servant fell down at his feet. Is this not the same thing that he did? Notice

00:18:28.739 --> 00:18:39.539
what he says, and he besought him. What did he say? Have patience with me and I

00:18:39.539 --> 00:18:49.619
will pay thee all. It's the same exact thing that this servant said to his

00:18:49.619 --> 00:19:00.019
master. Is it not? Have patience with me. Have patience with me. And it says that

00:19:00.019 --> 00:19:10.659
the first four words of verse number 30, and he would not. And he would not. He

00:19:10.659 --> 00:19:14.139
would not what? He would not have patience. He would not allow for this

00:19:14.139 --> 00:19:20.019
man to have a season, an opportunity to be able to earn the money to be able to

00:19:20.019 --> 00:19:25.579
pay back the debt. He did not forgive the debt and excuse it all like he had

00:19:25.579 --> 00:19:29.419
experienced and what he had received. He didn't even have enough compassion to

00:19:29.419 --> 00:19:36.820
have enough patience to let this servant work to pay it off. The Bible says that

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:45.659
he cast him into prison till he should pay the debt. I understand that we could look at

00:19:45.659 --> 00:19:52.139
this passage of Scripture and we could make many applications and understand

00:19:52.139 --> 00:19:56.820
this evening that as we look at this particular passage in light of the truth

00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:59.419
of 1 Thessalonians 5 and verse number 14.

00:19:59.419 --> 00:20:03.419
so often that when we consider the thought of patience,

00:20:03.419 --> 00:20:05.919
when we consider the thought of being long-suffering,

00:20:05.919 --> 00:20:10.119
we're here, God gives us clearly this instruction

00:20:10.119 --> 00:20:11.819
to the local church, he says,

00:20:11.819 --> 00:20:14.219
now we exhort you, brethren.

00:20:14.219 --> 00:20:17.219
And he says, warn them that are unruly.

00:20:17.219 --> 00:20:19.419
And no doubt, that's a necessity,

00:20:19.419 --> 00:20:21.619
that's something that needs to happen.

00:20:21.619 --> 00:20:23.919
I said this a few weeks ago,

00:20:23.919 --> 00:20:26.419
ignoring the problem of the unruly

00:20:26.419 --> 00:20:28.519
is not going to resolve the problem,

00:20:28.719 --> 00:20:31.419
it's just going to make the situation worse.

00:20:31.419 --> 00:20:34.219
It has to be addressed, it has to be dealt with,

00:20:34.219 --> 00:20:37.319
and God in his sovereignty and his omniscience,

00:20:37.319 --> 00:20:40.219
he knew that local churches would deal with some

00:20:40.219 --> 00:20:41.319
that would be unruly.

00:20:41.319 --> 00:20:44.119
I'm thankful that it's not all the time

00:20:44.119 --> 00:20:46.719
that people and all the people are unruly,

00:20:46.719 --> 00:20:49.119
but you find that God gives the instruction.

00:20:49.119 --> 00:20:51.219
When there are those that are unruly,

00:20:51.219 --> 00:20:53.719
they need to be warned.

00:20:53.719 --> 00:20:55.519
Why would we warn the unruly?

00:20:55.519 --> 00:20:57.319
Well, so they could correct their behavior,

00:20:57.419 --> 00:20:59.319
so that they could be pleasing to the Lord,

00:20:59.319 --> 00:21:02.719
because one day they're going to stand before Christ.

00:21:02.719 --> 00:21:04.619
And you want to be able to, as Paul says

00:21:04.619 --> 00:21:05.719
in the book of Colossians,

00:21:05.719 --> 00:21:08.119
that they would be able to be presented perfect

00:21:08.119 --> 00:21:11.019
or complete before the Lord.

00:21:11.019 --> 00:21:13.919
And so we find that, warn them that are unruly,

00:21:13.919 --> 00:21:15.519
comfort the feeble-minded.

00:21:15.519 --> 00:21:17.219
You know, there are some people that it just becomes

00:21:17.219 --> 00:21:19.819
almost more natural to be an encourager

00:21:19.819 --> 00:21:21.919
and to be able to encourage others.

00:21:21.919 --> 00:21:24.119
I said this, that there are times in which

00:21:24.119 --> 00:21:26.019
we are the one doing the encouragement,

00:21:26.119 --> 00:21:27.419
and times in which we're the ones

00:21:27.419 --> 00:21:29.019
that need the encouragement.

00:21:29.019 --> 00:21:32.319
And no doubt, I'm thankful that Barnabas was a man,

00:21:32.319 --> 00:21:34.819
that he was a son of consolation,

00:21:34.819 --> 00:21:36.719
a comforter and encourager.

00:21:36.719 --> 00:21:38.819
I'm thankful that this was true

00:21:38.819 --> 00:21:40.619
in the life of the Apostle Paul,

00:21:40.619 --> 00:21:43.419
that he had someone that would come and encourage him.

00:21:44.819 --> 00:21:48.119
Remember, he said, as we studied that portion of Scripture,

00:21:48.119 --> 00:21:52.719
how God chose to comfort him by the coming of Titus,

00:21:52.819 --> 00:21:55.819
and how God will use us as individuals

00:21:55.819 --> 00:21:59.219
to comfort those that need the comfort to come

00:21:59.219 --> 00:22:02.919
and to get close to them and speak to them,

00:22:04.019 --> 00:22:05.719
to comfort them.

00:22:05.719 --> 00:22:08.419
We find that there are some that need to be supported.

00:22:08.419 --> 00:22:11.419
Support the weak, support the weak.

00:22:11.419 --> 00:22:13.119
There are some that are just weak.

00:22:15.019 --> 00:22:19.419
Some receive a phone call, they have a doctor's visit,

00:22:19.419 --> 00:22:22.019
they have a, I mean, you just fill in the blank.

00:22:22.019 --> 00:22:24.219
Life can take a turn in a moment.

00:22:26.119 --> 00:22:28.919
You can get devastating news,

00:22:28.919 --> 00:22:31.819
and you have no idea how that might impact you,

00:22:31.819 --> 00:22:33.019
how it might affect you.

00:22:34.619 --> 00:22:36.919
We ought not, as we think about these truths

00:22:36.919 --> 00:22:39.619
of warn them and comfort them and support them,

00:22:39.619 --> 00:22:41.619
those that are unruly, those that are feeble-minded,

00:22:41.619 --> 00:22:44.119
those that are weak, we understand it's not judge them,

00:22:44.119 --> 00:22:46.319
it's not criticize them, it's not condemn them,

00:22:46.319 --> 00:22:48.919
it's not, no, it's an active engagement

00:22:48.919 --> 00:22:52.819
of trying to help them grow in Christ.

00:22:52.819 --> 00:22:56.519
But then he says, be patient toward all men.

00:22:57.819 --> 00:22:59.919
I think in verse number 14,

00:23:02.619 --> 00:23:05.219
naturally speaking, the one that's the hardest

00:23:05.219 --> 00:23:08.919
is the final, be patient toward all men.

00:23:11.119 --> 00:23:13.719
But we find that with the help of God,

00:23:14.559 --> 00:23:16.619
as we're truly walking in the Spirit,

00:23:16.619 --> 00:23:18.819
as we're filled with the Spirit of God,

00:23:19.519 --> 00:23:23.619
as we've crucified the flesh and the affections thereof,

00:23:23.619 --> 00:23:28.019
we can demonstrate this godly patience,

00:23:28.019 --> 00:23:31.919
this long-suffering, this attitude

00:23:31.919 --> 00:23:34.819
that we find demonstrated here

00:23:34.819 --> 00:23:37.619
in this portion of Scripture in 1 Thessalonians

00:23:37.619 --> 00:23:41.019
where God says, be patient toward all men.

00:23:41.019 --> 00:23:42.419
I wonder this evening,

00:23:42.419 --> 00:23:45.019
I started out by asking some questions,

00:23:45.019 --> 00:23:47.419
have you ever witnessed someone that lacked patience?

00:23:47.419 --> 00:23:48.419
Sure we have.

00:23:49.519 --> 00:23:51.319
Have you ever lacked patience?

00:23:52.519 --> 00:23:55.119
I'm pretty confident that all of us have.

00:23:55.119 --> 00:23:58.419
At some point in our lives, we've lacked patience.

00:23:58.419 --> 00:24:02.919
Is it possible that we could be patient toward all men?

00:24:03.819 --> 00:24:05.119
Well, if it's not possible,

00:24:05.119 --> 00:24:07.419
God would not have instructed us to do so.

00:24:08.319 --> 00:24:10.819
But knowing that God instructed us to do so,

00:24:10.819 --> 00:24:15.119
it's obvious that we can with God's help.

00:24:16.119 --> 00:24:19.619
I use the illustration in the book of Matthew this evening

00:24:19.619 --> 00:24:21.919
for this purpose.

00:24:21.919 --> 00:24:23.819
Don't be like that individual

00:24:23.819 --> 00:24:26.219
that wants people to be patient with them

00:24:27.419 --> 00:24:30.319
and then turn around and not have patience with others.

00:24:31.619 --> 00:24:35.219
It's so common and so easy for us to fall in the trap.

00:24:35.219 --> 00:24:40.219
It's a human tendency that we see on display in Matthew 18.

00:24:41.719 --> 00:24:44.319
Have patience with me, but then I'm gonna go around

00:24:44.319 --> 00:24:47.319
and I'm not gonna have patience with others.

00:24:47.319 --> 00:24:49.119
God's people ought to be different.

00:24:50.019 --> 00:24:52.319
God's people ought to be different.

00:24:52.319 --> 00:24:56.219
And God tells us be patient toward all men.

00:24:56.219 --> 00:25:00.919
I wonder this evening, I know for me, even as I prepared,

00:25:00.919 --> 00:25:03.019
man, I need the help of God.

00:25:04.019 --> 00:25:05.219
You need the help of God.

00:25:05.219 --> 00:25:07.819
We need to be walking in the spirit

00:25:07.819 --> 00:25:10.919
if we're gonna be patient toward all men.

00:25:10.919 --> 00:25:12.819
And let me tell you this,

00:25:12.819 --> 00:25:15.019
you ever hear, my dad uses this terminology all the time.

00:25:15.019 --> 00:25:16.819
I'm not sure if other people use it or not,

00:25:16.819 --> 00:25:19.219
but he says people push his buttons.

00:25:19.219 --> 00:25:21.819
You ever hear somebody use that phraseology?

00:25:21.819 --> 00:25:24.719
And someone said I was looking for the off button.

00:25:26.119 --> 00:25:27.419
Bad decision.

00:25:28.319 --> 00:25:30.219
But what I'm saying this,

00:25:30.219 --> 00:25:32.419
when you seek to try to fulfill,

00:25:32.419 --> 00:25:34.619
as you're walking in the spirit,

00:25:34.619 --> 00:25:36.719
you can guarantee that there are gonna be some things

00:25:36.719 --> 00:25:39.519
that happen where if I could adopt

00:25:39.519 --> 00:25:41.619
and use for a moment that phrase,

00:25:41.619 --> 00:25:43.319
people are gonna push your buttons.

00:25:44.319 --> 00:25:47.819
I wonder this evening how quickly we can get into the flesh

00:25:47.819 --> 00:25:50.019
and not walk in the spirit.

00:25:50.019 --> 00:25:52.619
Because it requires us to be dead to self

00:25:52.619 --> 00:25:54.719
and we walk in the spirit

00:25:54.719 --> 00:25:59.519
because the fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace,

00:25:59.519 --> 00:26:02.519
long suffering, long suffering.

00:26:02.519 --> 00:26:05.719
He says be patient toward all men.

00:26:05.719 --> 00:26:08.119
Oh, that God would help us in this area.

00:26:08.119 --> 00:26:10.819
Say, I'd rather warn the unruly,

00:26:10.819 --> 00:26:12.819
but they're all there, amen.

00:26:12.819 --> 00:26:15.819
And we're responsible to fulfill all of them,

00:26:15.819 --> 00:26:17.919
that we are to warn the unruly,

00:26:17.919 --> 00:26:19.719
we are to comfort the feeble-minded,

00:26:19.719 --> 00:26:22.019
we are to support the weak,

00:26:22.019 --> 00:26:25.519
but we're also commanded to be patient toward all men.

00:26:25.519 --> 00:26:26.919
Father, we love you.

00:26:26.919 --> 00:26:29.219
We thank you for loving us.

00:26:29.219 --> 00:26:31.219
I pray God that you'd help us.

00:26:31.219 --> 00:26:33.019
We acknowledge this evening

00:26:34.219 --> 00:26:37.919
that we cannot in our own flesh, in our own power,

00:26:38.919 --> 00:26:43.019
begin to fulfill this piece of instruction

00:26:43.019 --> 00:26:44.819
that you've given us in your word.

00:26:46.519 --> 00:26:48.419
It's absolutely going to be

00:26:50.419 --> 00:26:53.819
only achievable as we walk in the spirit,

00:26:54.919 --> 00:26:56.919
as we crucify the flesh,

00:26:58.019 --> 00:27:01.219
as we're filled with the spirit of God.

00:27:01.219 --> 00:27:04.919
And I pray, Lord, that you'd help us to daily,

00:27:04.919 --> 00:27:09.219
daily, as Paul said, I die daily,

00:27:09.219 --> 00:27:12.619
daily that we would say, I am crucified with Christ,

00:27:14.519 --> 00:27:16.219
that we'd be emptied of self,

00:27:17.319 --> 00:27:18.819
filled with your spirit,

00:27:20.219 --> 00:27:23.419
that we'd be able to, with your help and by your grace,

00:27:25.019 --> 00:27:28.319
obey this instruction,

00:27:28.319 --> 00:27:30.619
to be patient toward all men.

00:27:31.619 --> 00:27:33.319
I thank you for the privilege of prayer,

00:27:33.319 --> 00:27:34.319
the corporate prayer.

00:27:34.319 --> 00:27:36.919
I pray that you'd bless all that's said and done.

00:27:36.919 --> 00:27:39.819
For it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.

00:27:39.819 --> 00:27:42.119
Does anyone need a prayer bulletin this evening?
