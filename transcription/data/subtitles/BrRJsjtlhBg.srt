1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,739
Second Corinthians, chapter number one, God's grace is sufficient.

2
00:00:05,739 --> 00:00:08,539
Aren't you thankful for that wonderful Bible truth?

3
00:00:08,539 --> 00:00:14,039
I hope that even in the last week that you have experienced the grace of God

4
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:18,620
in your lives, that you have found that God's grace is sufficient.

5
00:00:18,959 --> 00:00:22,459
We find that as we're going to study through this book of Second Corinthians

6
00:00:22,459 --> 00:00:24,860
that we begin here in chapter number one this morning,

7
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,299
we're looking at verses one through eleven.

8
00:00:27,299 --> 00:00:31,600
I've titled the message this with suffering comes comfort.

9
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,299
With suffering comes comfort.

10
00:00:35,599 --> 00:00:37,580
You say, I don't like talking about suffering.

11
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,740
Yeah, but we all suffer.

12
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:42,319
It's important that we understand the Bible truth

13
00:00:42,319 --> 00:00:46,380
that we find in this passage of Scripture with regard to

14
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,180
with suffering comes comfort.

15
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,319
We find that Paul ministered in Corinth.

16
00:00:51,319 --> 00:00:53,119
He knew the church well.

17
00:00:53,139 --> 00:00:56,180
His authority and his apostleship was being questioned

18
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:00,659
by some within the congregation, and thus we read the introduction

19
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:04,620
that we do notice in verse number one of Second Corinthians, chapter one.

20
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:09,699
Paul says Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ

21
00:01:09,699 --> 00:01:14,540
by the will of God, he notes his position in verse number one again.

22
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,440
His apostleship, his leadership, his his authority

23
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,879
was being questioned by some within the church.

24
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:24,180
And so he begins writing this letter under the inspiration

25
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,239
of the Holy Spirit of God.

26
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:29,279
We understand that all Scripture is given by inspiration of God.

27
00:01:29,279 --> 00:01:33,260
And he says, Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ.

28
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:36,279
Notice, he says, by the will of God.

29
00:01:37,059 --> 00:01:40,599
This was not Paul just determining, deciding one day.

30
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,919
I think I'm going to be an apostle.

31
00:01:42,919 --> 00:01:46,860
This was not Paul going and submitting an application

32
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,239
to become the next apostle.

33
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:52,000
No, this was the will of God for his life.

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
God placed a call and then God equipped the apostle

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,639
Paul in this position of being an apostle.

36
00:01:59,639 --> 00:02:03,980
We find that he clearly states that and he makes them understand

37
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:07,139
the truth that this is God's will for his life.

38
00:02:07,139 --> 00:02:12,119
By the way, it's important that we know what God's will is for our lives,

39
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:16,619
that we understand that God has a purpose and a plan for each and every one of us.

40
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:18,839
And we understand that as we study the word of God,

41
00:02:19,119 --> 00:02:24,020
that there are many times in which God will say this is the will of God for you.

42
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:27,520
And we understand the truth of our sanctification,

43
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,759
that in everything we give thanks, understand

44
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:32,520
this is the will of God and Christ Jesus concerning you.

45
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,720
But then God has a plan for you individually.

46
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:37,500
And I'm thankful for that.

47
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,940
And I rejoice in it.

48
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,440
Notice he continues and Timothy, our brother.

49
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,839
Now, Timothy, we believe, had just been there in Corinth,

50
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:49,500
had been ministering there and had opportunity to bring some word back

51
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,699
and what have you.

52
00:02:50,699 --> 00:02:53,460
And so Timothy is mentioned under the church of God.

53
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,600
By the way, aren't you thankful it's God's church? Amen.

54
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,139
It's not my church, not your church.

55
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:02,179
It's God's church, which is at Corinth with all the saints,

56
00:03:02,179 --> 00:03:04,240
which are in all Achaia.

57
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,679
So understand, as he's writing to the church in Corinth,

58
00:03:07,679 --> 00:03:10,619
as he writes the second letter, he had ministered there.

59
00:03:10,619 --> 00:03:12,080
He knew the church well.

60
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,759
He'd already written one letter.

61
00:03:13,779 --> 00:03:16,279
We find that he's now writing this second letter.

62
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:19,720
It seems as if as you study the scriptures, that there's a third letter

63
00:03:20,259 --> 00:03:24,559
that was probably written in between the first and second, but is not scripture.

64
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,860
It does not mean that it was scripture and lost or anything like that.

65
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:30,699
It just was not everything that Paul wrote was scripture.

66
00:03:31,259 --> 00:03:33,699
All scripture is given by inspiration of God.

67
00:03:33,699 --> 00:03:35,600
And this is in the canon of scripture.

68
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:39,080
But we find that the city where the church is in Corinth,

69
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:44,300
but the region is Achaia, as you find at the end of verse number one

70
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,899
and all the saints, which are in all Achaia.

71
00:03:46,899 --> 00:03:50,580
And so we understand, as you study the book of First Thessalonians,

72
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,880
that from them, from the church in Thessalonica,

73
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:57,080
sounded forth the word of God to Macedonia.

74
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:01,020
That's the northern part of the Grecian Empire or the Grecian region,

75
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,619
the region of Greece there.

76
00:04:02,619 --> 00:04:05,520
And we find that he then mentions about Achaia,

77
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,699
which would be that southern province of Greece.

78
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,979
And so we find that he mentions that to the church in Thessalonica as well.

79
00:04:12,179 --> 00:04:13,860
And he's writing here to the believers.

80
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:17,359
Aren't you thankful that there are believers scattered all around the globe?

81
00:04:17,859 --> 00:04:20,200
And he mentions about these that he's writing to.

82
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,640
And he says this in verse two, grace

83
00:04:23,359 --> 00:04:27,239
be to you and peace from God, our father

84
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:30,339
and from the Lord Jesus Christ.

85
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:32,440
I'm thankful for the grace of God.

86
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,640
I'm thankful for the peace of God.

87
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:38,220
We mentioned last week, as we studied entirely dealing with the subject

88
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:42,820
that God's grace is sufficient, his saving grace, but also his enabling grace.

89
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:47,739
And we understand that God is the one who is gracious, who gives us grace.

90
00:04:47,739 --> 00:04:50,579
And we ought to rejoice in the grace of God.

91
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:53,339
But we also see that he mentions the peace of God.

92
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:58,299
He says in peace from God, our father and from the Lord Jesus Christ,

93
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:01,779
we live in a world that's full of turmoil and difficulty

94
00:05:01,779 --> 00:05:05,480
and all sorts of just craziness that's going on

95
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,679
and how we need the peace of God.

96
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,720
He mentions in the book of Philippians that the peace of God,

97
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,880
which passeth all understanding, the book of Colossians,

98
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,519
that were to let the peace of God rule in our hearts.

99
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:24,959
Perfect peace have they whose mind is stayed upon thee.

100
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:29,399
And what a joy to know that our God gives grace and he gives peace.

101
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:32,299
And so we see this introduction that is given.

102
00:05:32,299 --> 00:05:35,540
But as we look at the primary text this morning from verses three

103
00:05:35,779 --> 00:05:38,420
down to verse number 11, we find that Paul,

104
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:42,100
we discover in this portion of scripture that he's informing the believers

105
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,420
about practical Christian living.

106
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,299
Now, it's important that we understand this this morning

107
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,579
because it's important that we know it's absolutely necessary

108
00:05:51,579 --> 00:05:54,299
that we as the people of God, that as believers,

109
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,500
that we move from principle to practice.

110
00:05:59,899 --> 00:06:01,059
Let me say this.

111
00:06:01,059 --> 00:06:02,980
The Bible is not just a book of theory.

112
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:06,820
The Bible is not a book of theory.

113
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:09,980
There are principles that are in the Bible,

114
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:14,739
but we find that the Bible is a book, a divine book, a book from our father,

115
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,179
that he gives us practical instruction

116
00:06:18,459 --> 00:06:23,420
that needs to be implied in the life of every child of God.

117
00:06:23,899 --> 00:06:26,660
We move from principle to practice.

118
00:06:26,679 --> 00:06:29,720
We understand that as we look at the portion of scripture.

119
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,359
In fact, I believe that verse four gives us a great principle.

120
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:33,720
We'll look at it in just a moment.

121
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,799
But then we move forward and we see the practical outworking of that principle.

122
00:06:37,799 --> 00:06:42,799
And that's what we see that here is Paul is writing to these believers in Corinth.

123
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:49,040
He's helping us to understand this aspect of practical Christian living.

124
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:54,320
As I preach and as I teach and as I read and study for my own,

125
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:58,619
as I look at God's word, I'm always looking for what is the application?

126
00:06:58,899 --> 00:07:00,260
What does God have for us?

127
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:05,260
Because it's not just that we have this mountain of facts and mountain of of theory

128
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,859
and what have you, principles,

129
00:07:07,859 --> 00:07:12,859
but we take and we understand that these principles are to be implied in our

130
00:07:12,859 --> 00:07:17,260
lives and we're to live it out in practical Christian living.

131
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:21,260
He begins with praise in verse number three,

132
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,380
and it's so important that we see that.

133
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,679
We'll mention in just a moment,

134
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,200
but we find that Paul, he's no stranger to suffering.

135
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,559
You know about the apostle Paul.

136
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:33,880
You read his life all through the new Testament and you find that he's no

137
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,440
stranger to suffering. He's no stranger to trouble.

138
00:07:36,559 --> 00:07:41,320
We find that although he had experienced trouble and although he'd experienced

139
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:41,839
suffering,

140
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:46,839
we find that he knew the comfort of God in a deep and a personal way.

141
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,799
The comfort of God. Notice the word comfort, comforted,

142
00:07:53,059 --> 00:07:55,500
comforted or consolation.

143
00:07:55,859 --> 00:07:58,619
And all of those words have for the same Greek word,

144
00:07:58,619 --> 00:08:00,140
the same root word in the Greek.

145
00:08:00,299 --> 00:08:04,140
Those four English words are translated from that same root word in the Greek

146
00:08:04,339 --> 00:08:09,260
that those words are used 10 times in verses three through seven,

147
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:15,380
10 times in four verses. He uses the word comfort,

148
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:18,820
comforted, comforted or consolation.

149
00:08:19,059 --> 00:08:23,239
You think God wants us to know something about comfort and understanding it?

150
00:08:23,239 --> 00:08:26,959
Listen, the word comfort means this. It means to call to one side.

151
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:31,679
It means to encourage and strengthen by consolation.

152
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,440
As we look at this word comfort,

153
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,400
biblically speaking and we understand it's the same word that is used in

154
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,520
describing the ministry of the Holy Spirit of God,

155
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:44,520
that he is given the name of being the comforter in John chapter 14.

156
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,059
In John chapter 14.

157
00:08:46,219 --> 00:08:49,380
But we find here that as we begin to think about the comfort, listen,

158
00:08:49,539 --> 00:08:50,460
it's not the,

159
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:55,460
the idea of biblical comfort and the comfort that God gives us as people is not

160
00:08:56,099 --> 00:08:57,460
some kind of sympathy.

161
00:08:59,179 --> 00:09:04,179
It's that God comes along our side to encourage us,

162
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:09,780
to strengthen us through whatever trial or turmoil that we're facing so that we

163
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:15,280
can complete the course that God has for us.

164
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,119
As we begin looking here in this text of scripture,

165
00:09:18,119 --> 00:09:20,960
I want you to notice number one, the experience of Paul.

166
00:09:21,119 --> 00:09:24,840
We see it in verses three through five and really kind of scattered throughout

167
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,799
the remainder of the text that we'll look at this morning.

168
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:31,520
But we see the experience of Paul and we find that it begins with praise.

169
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,640
I mentioned that a moment ago, but notice in verse number three, he says,

170
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,119
blessed be God, literally praise be to God.

171
00:09:39,099 --> 00:09:41,700
How important that we noticed this morning, uh,

172
00:09:41,739 --> 00:09:46,739
that Paul begins with praise and how appropriate would be for you in your life

173
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:51,659
and for me in my life to, to begin with praise, to begin with adoration,

174
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:54,140
to lift high the Lord Jesus Christ,

175
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:57,440
to understand who he is and what he's done for us.

176
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,059
And you understand that praise changes.

177
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:04,939
Praise changes your focus, it changes your perspective,

178
00:10:04,939 --> 00:10:08,219
it changes everything about what you're dealing with.

179
00:10:08,219 --> 00:10:09,059
Why?

180
00:10:09,059 --> 00:10:12,379
Because you're choosing not to just complain

181
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:13,539
and have a pity party.

182
00:10:13,539 --> 00:10:16,819
No, you're choosing to fix your attention upon God

183
00:10:16,819 --> 00:10:18,379
and begin to praise Him.

184
00:10:19,379 --> 00:10:20,279
We find that He says,

185
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:24,459
"'Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,

186
00:10:24,459 --> 00:10:29,459
"'the Father of mercies and the God of all comfort.'"

187
00:10:29,979 --> 00:10:32,699
Notice the two phrases that are used

188
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:33,859
at the end of verse number three,

189
00:10:33,859 --> 00:10:36,399
that He is the Father of mercies.

190
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,379
How often we need mercy in our lives,

191
00:10:38,379 --> 00:10:40,559
we speak much about grace and we read it

192
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:41,959
in verse number two already,

193
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:44,399
and we've spoke about it in great length last week,

194
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,179
but we find that He now mentions

195
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:48,979
that God is the Father of mercies.

196
00:10:50,259 --> 00:10:51,779
But not only the Father of mercies,

197
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:56,779
but the God, notice what it says, of all comfort.

198
00:10:56,819 --> 00:10:58,859
He's the God of all comfort.

199
00:10:58,939 --> 00:11:02,459
And Paul begins to share his experience here.

200
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:05,099
He gives the principle in verse number four,

201
00:11:05,099 --> 00:11:08,899
who, speaking of the God who is the Father of mercies,

202
00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:09,979
the God of all comfort,

203
00:11:09,979 --> 00:11:14,220
who comforted us in all our tribulation,

204
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,779
that we may be able to comfort them,

205
00:11:16,779 --> 00:11:19,059
which are in any trouble by the comfort

206
00:11:19,059 --> 00:11:24,059
wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.

207
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:26,559
This is a great principle in verse number four,

208
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:29,319
that God provides comfort for His people,

209
00:11:29,319 --> 00:11:32,839
who then in turn can provide comfort for others.

210
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:35,540
But Paul, as he deals with this principle

211
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,639
that is stated to us in verse number four,

212
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:39,839
he does not wanna simply look at a principle,

213
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,720
he doesn't wanna simply look at a theory,

214
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,399
he wants the believers in Corinth to understand

215
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,559
that this truth, this principle,

216
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:50,399
this truth about who God is and how God works,

217
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,279
that he wants them to be able to see

218
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:56,639
that this is real Christian living.

219
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,919
This is something that he experienced,

220
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:01,000
it's not something that we just talk about,

221
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,759
hey, our God is able to,

222
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:04,319
hey, our God answers prayer.

223
00:12:04,319 --> 00:12:06,439
The reality is that we can talk about

224
00:12:06,439 --> 00:12:09,160
and we can preach about how God answers prayer,

225
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,759
but you know what's so much more impactful

226
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:16,539
is when God answers your prayer, amen?

227
00:12:16,539 --> 00:12:19,160
When God works in your life, when you see,

228
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:22,399
listen, it's an amazing, why does God use us

229
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,679
to be able to share the gospel with other people?

230
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:27,239
Because we've been saved by the grace of God.

231
00:12:27,239 --> 00:12:29,279
And someone that's been saved by the grace of God

232
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,599
who had no hope, who had no direction,

233
00:12:31,599 --> 00:12:33,619
who had no confidence of heaven

234
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:36,759
is then able to share with someone else

235
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:38,959
what God did for them.

236
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,319
The angels, they cannot share the gospel

237
00:12:42,319 --> 00:12:45,239
of the Lord Jesus Christ as we look at the time

238
00:12:45,239 --> 00:12:47,800
in which we're facing today and what we're dealing with.

239
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,360
Look, Peter talks about how the angels look steadfastly,

240
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,500
but they're not saved like we're saved.

241
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,360
You see, when we look at the comfort that God gives,

242
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:03,839
someone who has experienced that

243
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,239
can then share that experience with someone else

244
00:13:06,239 --> 00:13:08,800
and say, listen, this isn't just theory,

245
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,059
this isn't just principle, this is practical living.

246
00:13:14,199 --> 00:13:17,119
I have gone through some trials,

247
00:13:17,119 --> 00:13:19,039
I've faced some suffering,

248
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:22,160
but oh, let me tell you about the comfort that God gave.

249
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,039
Oh, let me tell you about how God came along my side

250
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:28,199
and how God walked with me and God helped me.

251
00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:31,800
And Paul begins to share this experience we know

252
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,080
in our text of scripture that he experienced

253
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,559
according to verse number five,

254
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:36,919
he talks about the sufferings.

255
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:39,000
Notice, for as the sufferings of Christ,

256
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,099
notice what he says, abound in us.

257
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:46,720
Paul didn't just have one thing that he suffered from,

258
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:49,959
he said the sufferings of Christ abound in us.

259
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:51,360
I've mentioned this before,

260
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,759
and you know it to be the truth

261
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:54,839
if you study throughout the New Testament,

262
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:56,720
that many times Paul suffered

263
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,919
simply because he was obeying God.

264
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:02,279
He was suffering as a result of his obedience,

265
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:05,380
and he says that these sufferings, they abound in us.

266
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:08,639
In just a few verses, he's gonna share not the details,

267
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,199
but the reference of some suffering that he had

268
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,360
while he was in Asia.

269
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,720
We find that in this particular book in 2 Corinthians,

270
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,359
we find that later on, he's going to go

271
00:14:18,359 --> 00:14:20,519
and he's gonna deal in chapter number 11,

272
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:23,239
and he's gonna talk about all of these various things

273
00:14:23,239 --> 00:14:26,119
that he suffered, and he's gonna go through this list

274
00:14:26,119 --> 00:14:27,440
in chapter number 11.

275
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,880
And listen, we look at the Apostle Paul,

276
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,559
and he was acquainted with these things,

277
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:33,160
he experienced these things,

278
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,440
and he speaks of the suffering, the affliction.

279
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,839
Notice in verse five, for as the sufferings of Christ

280
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:43,320
abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ.

281
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,839
What we see in verse six, and whether we be afflicted,

282
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:50,600
it is for your consolation and salvation,

283
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,239
which is effectual, it's effective, it works,

284
00:14:54,239 --> 00:14:55,959
in the enduring of the same sufferings,

285
00:14:55,959 --> 00:14:58,639
which we also suffer, or whether we be comforted,

286
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,200
it is for your consolation and salvation.

287
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,320
Notice in verse number eight, he continues,

288
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,480
he talks about his suffering in verse number five,

289
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,239
his affliction in verse number six,

290
00:15:08,239 --> 00:15:11,119
and verse number eight, for we would not, brethren,

291
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:13,639
have you ignorant of our trouble,

292
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:15,600
which came to us in Asia.

293
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,359
He begins to describe, not the specifics of the trouble,

294
00:15:19,359 --> 00:15:23,720
but the impact of this trouble, and how it affected them.

295
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,519
Notice what he says in verse eight,

296
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,839
and as he continues and expounds upon it

297
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,720
into verse number nine, he says that this trouble,

298
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,440
notice how he refers to it, he says that we were pressed

299
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:38,440
out of measure, we were pressed out of measure.

300
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,959
He says this, above strength, in so much

301
00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:46,359
that we despaired even of life.

302
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,440
The thought of death was real.

303
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,139
If you look at verse number nine, he says,

304
00:15:54,139 --> 00:15:57,839
but we had the sentence of death in ourselves,

305
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,040
and the reality is that you know, and I know,

306
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,000
that there were many that desired to kill Paul.

307
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,720
They did not like what he was doing,

308
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,880
they didn't like the preaching,

309
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,600
they didn't like his ministry.

310
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,959
In fact, there were men that made the decision,

311
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:14,359
they made the covenant, if you will,

312
00:16:14,359 --> 00:16:16,440
that they would not eat, and they would not drink

313
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,320
until they killed Paul.

314
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,480
Paul says, I was pressed out of measure.

315
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:31,079
Above strength, in so much that we despaired even of life,

316
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:33,559
we had the sentence of death in ourselves

317
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:35,179
that we should not trust in ourselves,

318
00:16:35,179 --> 00:16:38,660
but in God, which raiseth the dead.

319
00:16:40,739 --> 00:16:44,579
Paul experienced some things that we see

320
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:47,660
or described as tribulation, suffering, affliction,

321
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,940
trouble, being pressed out of measure,

322
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:53,059
but I want you to understand that Paul

323
00:16:53,059 --> 00:16:55,299
also experienced the comfort of God.

324
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,179
As we know in each of these verses,

325
00:16:58,179 --> 00:17:01,260
that not only does the apostle Paul mention

326
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,579
about the trial or the suffering,

327
00:17:03,579 --> 00:17:06,220
but we find that he's quick to reference

328
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,940
the comfort that only God can give.

329
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:11,179
We find that in verse number four,

330
00:17:11,179 --> 00:17:13,859
he gives that principle, but notice in verse number five,

331
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:15,700
as he talks about the experience,

332
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,940
he says in verse number five,

333
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:20,739
for as the sufferings of Christ abound in us,

334
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:25,739
notice, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ.

335
00:17:27,899 --> 00:17:32,459
Listen, as the sufferings came, there came comfort.

336
00:17:32,459 --> 00:17:34,540
As he experienced the suffering,

337
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,980
he experienced the comfort of God.

338
00:17:38,459 --> 00:17:43,459
As he dealt with the trouble, God stood with him.

339
00:17:43,459 --> 00:17:46,339
God came alongside him.

340
00:17:46,339 --> 00:17:50,980
God encouraged him and God strengthened him.

341
00:17:52,019 --> 00:17:54,760
Reminded of what we read several weeks ago

342
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,419
as we finished up the book of 2 Timothy

343
00:17:57,419 --> 00:17:59,579
and our theme for last year of continue,

344
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,619
that in 2 Timothy chapter four

345
00:18:01,619 --> 00:18:05,459
and in verse number 17 that Paul made this declaration,

346
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:09,179
notwithstanding the Lord stood with me

347
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:12,139
and strengthened me that by me,

348
00:18:12,139 --> 00:18:14,339
the preaching might be fully known

349
00:18:14,339 --> 00:18:16,500
and that all the Gentiles might hear

350
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:21,339
and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.

351
00:18:21,339 --> 00:18:22,859
Paul says, the Lord stood with me,

352
00:18:22,859 --> 00:18:25,419
the Lord strengthened me.

353
00:18:25,419 --> 00:18:27,779
As he's writing to Timothy, his son in the faith

354
00:18:27,779 --> 00:18:30,619
in 2 Timothy chapter four to encourage him

355
00:18:30,619 --> 00:18:32,820
and we find that here, Paul is saying,

356
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,460
yes, I experienced some difficulty.

357
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:38,380
I had some suffering but with suffering comes comfort

358
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:41,020
and I want you to know, believers at Corinth

359
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,380
and I want you to know as it's been preserved

360
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:46,099
for all of God's people this morning

361
00:18:46,099 --> 00:18:49,659
that when you suffer and you experience the suffering,

362
00:18:49,659 --> 00:18:51,340
the trouble, the difficulties

363
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,659
that you can understand this morning

364
00:18:53,659 --> 00:18:57,779
and you can expect to experience the comfort of God

365
00:18:58,779 --> 00:19:01,099
in a real and personal way

366
00:19:02,179 --> 00:19:04,500
because our God knows where we are.

367
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,179
He knows our frame.

368
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:07,859
He knows that we're but dust.

369
00:19:07,859 --> 00:19:09,500
He knows that we're frail

370
00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:13,260
and he comforts us.

371
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,500
We find that not only did he experience the comfort

372
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,659
that only God can give and by the way,

373
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,179
I want you to understand this morning

374
00:19:22,179 --> 00:19:25,260
that God can comfort like no one else can comfort.

375
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:29,859
The reality is that you may have someone in your life

376
00:19:29,859 --> 00:19:34,619
that is a spouse or maybe someone else,

377
00:19:34,619 --> 00:19:37,059
a family member that can provide comfort

378
00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:40,580
but no one, no one can give you the comfort

379
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,219
that you need like God can

380
00:19:45,099 --> 00:19:47,099
because God knows everything about you.

381
00:19:48,859 --> 00:19:51,500
He knows what you can't even express.

382
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,500
The sorrows of your heart

383
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:59,500
that you can't even put to words, God knows

384
00:19:59,779 --> 00:20:00,619
and God.

385
00:20:00,619 --> 00:20:04,319
God can give you the comfort that you need.

386
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:06,219
We find that he experienced deliverance.

387
00:20:06,219 --> 00:20:07,559
Notice in verse 10, it said,

388
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:11,659
who delivered us from so great a death?

389
00:20:11,659 --> 00:20:14,139
Paul experienced that deliverance that he spoke of

390
00:20:14,139 --> 00:20:16,339
in 2 Timothy chapter 4

391
00:20:16,339 --> 00:20:19,339
as he was writing to Timothy.

392
00:20:19,339 --> 00:20:22,899
This morning, so often we can talk about our suffering,

393
00:20:22,899 --> 00:20:24,979
so often we can talk about our troubles

394
00:20:24,979 --> 00:20:27,379
and our difficulties, our afflictions,

395
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:30,579
all that we see that Paul is speaking of here,

396
00:20:30,579 --> 00:20:31,759
but I wonder this morning,

397
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:33,619
how often do we focus on the fact

398
00:20:33,619 --> 00:20:36,159
that God is comforting me through all of that?

399
00:20:37,179 --> 00:20:39,379
That God is the one that is sustaining me,

400
00:20:39,379 --> 00:20:41,299
that he is the one that is strengthening me,

401
00:20:41,299 --> 00:20:45,259
that indeed he is the one that is strong

402
00:20:45,259 --> 00:20:48,579
and his strength is made perfect in my weakness.

403
00:20:50,619 --> 00:20:53,819
We find the experience of Paul,

404
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:55,059
but I want you to see number two,

405
00:20:55,059 --> 00:20:57,899
the encouragement from Paul.

406
00:20:57,899 --> 00:21:00,059
I want you to see in verses six and seven

407
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:03,939
how Paul is seeking not only to share his experience,

408
00:21:03,939 --> 00:21:07,379
but then to encourage these believers in Corinth.

409
00:21:07,379 --> 00:21:09,499
The encouragement from Paul.

410
00:21:09,499 --> 00:21:12,179
Understand with me this morning with great clarity

411
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:14,379
that Paul is not sharing his experience

412
00:21:14,379 --> 00:21:15,919
in order to receive sympathy.

413
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:18,659
Let me explain it this way.

414
00:21:18,659 --> 00:21:23,559
Paul doesn't need sympathy from the believers in Corinth.

415
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:24,739
You know why?

416
00:21:25,419 --> 00:21:26,499
He's got God's comfort.

417
00:21:28,299 --> 00:21:31,459
He's not sharing his experience

418
00:21:31,459 --> 00:21:34,099
so that he can receive sympathy.

419
00:21:35,179 --> 00:21:36,419
If we're not careful,

420
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:39,919
sometimes that's how we deal with things in life.

421
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,459
We pick up the phone or we send a note

422
00:21:42,459 --> 00:21:45,299
or we meet with someone and we share all of our hardships

423
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:46,779
and all of our difficulties

424
00:21:46,779 --> 00:21:49,499
because we want somebody to be sympathetic to us.

425
00:21:49,499 --> 00:21:51,119
We want sympathy.

426
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:53,559
Paul did not need the sympathy

427
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:55,559
from the believers in Corinth

428
00:21:56,439 --> 00:21:58,179
because he had God's comfort.

429
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:03,519
And God's comfort is so much better

430
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:06,279
than sympathy from anybody on this planet.

431
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:11,319
God's comfort.

432
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:12,819
He didn't need their sympathy.

433
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,879
I'm not trying to be unkind this morning,

434
00:22:15,879 --> 00:22:17,819
but I'm simply trying to help us understand

435
00:22:17,819 --> 00:22:21,459
the practical aspect of this passage of scripture.

436
00:22:22,419 --> 00:22:24,559
That when we're hurting,

437
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,559
when we're dealing with suffering and trouble

438
00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:30,319
and affliction and persecution and distress

439
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:32,539
and we're pressed out of measure,

440
00:22:32,539 --> 00:22:34,679
that God comforts.

441
00:22:35,539 --> 00:22:40,279
He comes alongside of us and he promises to do so.

442
00:22:40,279 --> 00:22:41,959
And if you've never experienced it,

443
00:22:41,959 --> 00:22:45,819
I'd simply say I'm sorry because you need to experience it.

444
00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:50,419
And so Paul is seeking to encourage these believers

445
00:22:50,419 --> 00:22:51,259
in Corinth.

446
00:22:51,259 --> 00:22:53,159
Again, he's not looking for their sympathy.

447
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:54,360
He doesn't need it.

448
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:58,039
He simply wants to encourage them with this biblical truth.

449
00:22:58,039 --> 00:23:01,199
We find that he wanted these believers to be aware

450
00:23:01,199 --> 00:23:03,879
of the principle that he had learned in his life

451
00:23:03,879 --> 00:23:06,159
and the experience that he had

452
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,479
from that principle becoming practice

453
00:23:08,479 --> 00:23:12,159
to dealing with the hardships and all of the opposition.

454
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,479
Maybe I think about the apostle Paul,

455
00:23:14,479 --> 00:23:18,479
he would find out in a practical way in his life

456
00:23:18,479 --> 00:23:21,580
how Stephen could be martyred as he stood there

457
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:25,699
and watched and had the grace of God all over his life.

458
00:23:26,979 --> 00:23:28,779
Because Paul stood there.

459
00:23:28,779 --> 00:23:33,739
Stephen's clothes were left at a young man's name, Saul.

460
00:23:33,739 --> 00:23:35,639
Is that what the Bible tells us?

461
00:23:38,059 --> 00:23:40,379
And when Paul, Saul at the time,

462
00:23:40,379 --> 00:23:43,619
witnessed that he saw the grace of God,

463
00:23:43,619 --> 00:23:46,459
he saw a man that was experiencing the comfort of God

464
00:23:46,459 --> 00:23:48,059
when people were stoning him

465
00:23:48,919 --> 00:23:50,519
and he was becoming the first martyr

466
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:52,639
and he prays and all that happens.

467
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:56,039
And then Paul lives after he gets saved

468
00:23:56,039 --> 00:24:00,639
and he then experiences that in his own life,

469
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:03,879
how God stood with him and how God encouraged him

470
00:24:03,879 --> 00:24:05,519
and God comforted him.

471
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:09,239
And we find that God is using Paul

472
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:11,519
to encourage these believers

473
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:14,879
that they would be aware of who God is,

474
00:24:14,879 --> 00:24:17,160
that he is the God of all comfort,

475
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,979
that he is the father of mercies,

476
00:24:18,979 --> 00:24:21,019
that he does come alongside

477
00:24:21,019 --> 00:24:23,820
and he wants them to experience the comfort of God.

478
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,579
Notice what he says in verse six.

479
00:24:27,139 --> 00:24:30,179
And whether we be afflicted, notice what he says,

480
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:33,380
it is for your consolation and salvation or deliverance.

481
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,699
It's not speaking about salvation

482
00:24:34,699 --> 00:24:36,500
as being saved by the blood,

483
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,660
being saved, going to heaven,

484
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,940
talking about deliverance here in the context.

485
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:42,679
But we find here that he says that whether we be afflicted,

486
00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:45,059
it is for your consolation and salvation.

487
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:45,899
Why?

488
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:50,440
Because you're going to see through our experience

489
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,600
and then we are going to be able to,

490
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,479
the principle in verse number four,

491
00:24:54,479 --> 00:24:57,399
that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble.

492
00:24:57,399 --> 00:25:00,979
So we experience this and God allowed us to experience this

493
00:25:00,979 --> 00:25:03,000
so that we could help you.

494
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,380
Does that make sense?

495
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,500
And we find here that he says in verse six,

496
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,839
he continues and says,

497
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:12,839
which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings

498
00:25:12,899 --> 00:25:15,479
which we also suffer.

499
00:25:17,179 --> 00:25:18,660
You're going to suffer.

500
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:19,899
You say, man, I didn't come to church

501
00:25:19,899 --> 00:25:22,260
to find out I was going to suffer.

502
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,419
You didn't have to come to church

503
00:25:23,419 --> 00:25:24,500
to find out you had to suffer.

504
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,339
You know what you do?

505
00:25:25,339 --> 00:25:27,179
You just live life

506
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:29,100
and you find out that they're sufferings.

507
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,859
Am I not right?

508
00:25:30,859 --> 00:25:32,739
You don't have to come to church to hear a preacher tell you.

509
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:35,139
I mean, I'm speaking on the authority of God's word,

510
00:25:35,139 --> 00:25:36,479
but what I'm saying to you this morning

511
00:25:36,479 --> 00:25:39,540
is that you live life and you know that sufferings come.

512
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:43,399
So we look here and we see that he says,

513
00:25:43,399 --> 00:25:45,600
or whether we be comforted,

514
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,919
it is for your consolation and salvation.

515
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:50,760
Again, we suffered for your benefit.

516
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,600
We're comforted for your benefit

517
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,899
because I now can encourage you.

518
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,079
Verse seven, notice what he says.

519
00:25:58,079 --> 00:25:59,720
So important in the whole key

520
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,079
of this passage of scripture this morning.

521
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:06,839
And our hope of you is steadfast.

522
00:26:07,779 --> 00:26:12,779
Now remember hope biblically is a confident expectation.

523
00:26:13,899 --> 00:26:16,660
He said, our hope of you is steadfast.

524
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:21,660
Know this, knowing that as ye are partakers

525
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:28,540
of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the consolation.

526
00:26:31,959 --> 00:26:33,220
I hate to use this phrase

527
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:35,579
because I think it could be taken out of context

528
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,079
and I don't mean it to be,

529
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:40,239
but I hope you can understand why I'm using it.

530
00:26:40,239 --> 00:26:43,000
I find in verse number seven that what Paul is doing

531
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,260
is he's keeping it real.

532
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:47,559
You're gonna suffer.

533
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,239
You're gonna suffer.

534
00:26:50,239 --> 00:26:53,799
Listen, I don't like it when people paint this pie

535
00:26:53,799 --> 00:26:56,160
in the sky kind of a picture of life.

536
00:26:57,199 --> 00:26:59,959
The prosperity gospel preachers that are out there,

537
00:26:59,959 --> 00:27:02,160
hey, just come give your life to Jesus

538
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,320
and everything's gonna be great

539
00:27:03,339 --> 00:27:05,619
and make sure you keep giving me money too, by the way,

540
00:27:05,619 --> 00:27:06,940
and then it will come back to you.

541
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,679
I mean, it's nonsense.

542
00:27:10,139 --> 00:27:11,679
Because as you study the word of God,

543
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:13,139
you know what you find?

544
00:27:13,139 --> 00:27:14,859
That the people of God suffer,

545
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:19,059
but it's for God's glory.

546
00:27:19,059 --> 00:27:20,440
It's for God's glory.

547
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:26,339
And he says, knowing that as ye are partakers

548
00:27:28,019 --> 00:27:33,019
of the sufferings, so shall you be also of the consolation.

549
00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:35,959
Now, Paul knew some things that they were dealing with,

550
00:27:35,959 --> 00:27:39,100
no doubt, that was specific in their lives

551
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:41,699
and some things that perhaps they were even going through

552
00:27:41,699 --> 00:27:43,059
and we're gonna study through the book

553
00:27:43,059 --> 00:27:45,739
and we'll find a number of things that could be referenced,

554
00:27:45,739 --> 00:27:49,339
but the reality is that whether I know specifically

555
00:27:49,339 --> 00:27:52,179
what you're suffering with or that I simply know

556
00:27:52,179 --> 00:27:55,059
that you will suffer as a human being,

557
00:27:55,059 --> 00:27:59,899
the truth is here that Paul says, I wanna encourage you

558
00:27:59,899 --> 00:28:02,739
because you're going to be a partaker of suffering,

559
00:28:02,739 --> 00:28:05,600
but I want you to know that you shall also,

560
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:10,000
shall you be also of the consolation.

561
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,440
You know, without the end of verse number seven,

562
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,799
it would leave us with no hope.

563
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:18,799
Without the end of verse number seven,

564
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,119
it would leave us with no hope.

565
00:28:20,119 --> 00:28:21,959
For God to just simply say to us,

566
00:28:21,959 --> 00:28:23,320
hey, you're gonna suffer.

567
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:28,320
But he says, I'm gonna comfort you

568
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:32,540
because with suffering comes comfort.

569
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:35,320
And oh, how that ought to cause us

570
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,440
as the people of God to rejoice.

571
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,940
You say, but I don't like suffering, neither do I.

572
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,140
I don't think any of us do,

573
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,960
but we get to experience the comfort of God.

574
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,679
Sometimes I wonder as I go through life

575
00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:52,159
and I know that others do as well

576
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:54,839
because people have shared it with me over the years

577
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:57,559
and they look at various circumstances of life

578
00:28:57,559 --> 00:28:59,119
and they say, I just don't know how somebody

579
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:01,119
without God handles this.

580
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,339
Have you ever seen that in life?

581
00:29:03,339 --> 00:29:05,099
You ever experienced that?

582
00:29:05,099 --> 00:29:06,219
So man, what do they do?

583
00:29:06,219 --> 00:29:07,380
Where do they turn?

584
00:29:10,099 --> 00:29:11,700
At one point in our nation's history,

585
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,539
I remember as even as a kid,

586
00:29:13,539 --> 00:29:15,260
before I went to church,

587
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,979
before I got saved, all of that stuff,

588
00:29:16,979 --> 00:29:19,339
that there were times in which people would say,

589
00:29:19,339 --> 00:29:20,900
hey, we're gonna pray for you.

590
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,500
Now people say, I'm thinking about you.

591
00:29:26,679 --> 00:29:27,820
Hey, I'll think about you.

592
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,099
What does that mean?

593
00:29:32,099 --> 00:29:36,520
As the people of God, we know the God of all comfort.

594
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:42,219
And listen, the just and the unjust suffer in this world.

595
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:45,900
But when the just suffer,

596
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:50,020
we experience the comfort of God.

597
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,339
And he comes alongside of us

598
00:29:51,339 --> 00:29:53,099
and we can understand that he has a purpose

599
00:29:53,099 --> 00:29:57,140
and he has a plan and that his way is perfect.

600
00:29:58,059 --> 00:29:59,820
I want you to notice over very quickly,

601
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,119
he holds your place here.

602
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:03,479
but go to First Thessalonians chapter three.

603
00:30:05,439 --> 00:30:06,959
In First Thessalonians chapter three,

604
00:30:06,959 --> 00:30:09,559
I want you to notice what Paul is saying

605
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:12,879
to these believers in Thessalonica.

606
00:30:15,199 --> 00:30:17,919
I wanna read the first five verses of chapter three.

607
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:19,439
I was gonna just grab one verse,

608
00:30:19,439 --> 00:30:21,899
but I want you to see the entirety of the context

609
00:30:21,899 --> 00:30:24,619
and understand that Paul had a brief time

610
00:30:24,619 --> 00:30:27,919
to be in Thessalonica to see this church planted.

611
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,839
He ends the second chapter by speaking about his desire

612
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:32,639
to have come and to be there,

613
00:30:32,639 --> 00:30:35,959
but that he had been hindered by the enemy, by Satan.

614
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:38,119
And so we find in chapter three in verse number one,

615
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:38,959
the Bible says,

616
00:30:38,959 --> 00:30:41,919
wherefore, when we could no longer forbear,

617
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:45,759
we thought it good to be left at Athens alone

618
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:49,639
and sent Timotheus our brother and minister of God

619
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:51,719
and our fellow labor in the gospel of Christ

620
00:30:51,719 --> 00:30:55,539
to establish you and to comfort you concerning your faith.

621
00:30:55,539 --> 00:30:57,679
Now notice how God was going to use,

622
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:00,799
and we'll see this in the book of 2 Corinthians as well,

623
00:31:01,299 --> 00:31:04,519
that at times God uses people to give that comfort,

624
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:05,459
to come alongside.

625
00:31:05,459 --> 00:31:06,439
Notice he says,

626
00:31:06,439 --> 00:31:09,559
to establish you and to comfort you concerning your faith.

627
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:10,399
But what do you do?

628
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:12,079
He sent Timotheus.

629
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:14,619
Timothy was gonna go and come alongside them

630
00:31:14,619 --> 00:31:18,239
and provide that instruction, but also that comfort.

631
00:31:18,239 --> 00:31:20,479
And Paul says he could no longer forbear.

632
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:21,319
In verse number one,

633
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:24,319
he was concerned about these believers in Thessalonica.

634
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:25,319
What was his concern?

635
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:26,359
Notice in verse number three,

636
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:29,239
that no man should be moved by what?

637
00:31:29,239 --> 00:31:30,899
These afflictions.

638
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:33,519
They were suffering.

639
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:36,479
For yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto.

640
00:31:36,479 --> 00:31:38,839
Did you notice that in the end of verse number three?

641
00:31:38,839 --> 00:31:41,999
He says, for yourselves know

642
00:31:41,999 --> 00:31:43,799
that we are appointed thereunto.

643
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:44,639
Unto what?

644
00:31:44,639 --> 00:31:45,959
To afflictions.

645
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:47,839
He says in verse number four,

646
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:51,279
for verily, when we were with you,

647
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:56,279
we told you before that we should suffer tribulation.

648
00:31:56,999 --> 00:32:00,819
Even as it came to pass, and ye know.

649
00:32:00,819 --> 00:32:03,239
For this cause, when I could no longer forbear,

650
00:32:03,239 --> 00:32:05,439
he mentioned that again from verse number one,

651
00:32:05,439 --> 00:32:07,799
I sent to know your faith.

652
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:10,299
Lest by some means the tempter have tempted you

653
00:32:10,299 --> 00:32:13,879
in our labor, be in vain.

654
00:32:13,879 --> 00:32:15,779
I don't have time to read the entirety of the chapter,

655
00:32:15,779 --> 00:32:18,739
but Paul receives a good report from Timothy.

656
00:32:18,739 --> 00:32:20,000
The believers in Thessalonica,

657
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,919
they were going forward.

658
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:24,000
They had experienced the comfort of God.

659
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,179
Yes, they'd been suffering.

660
00:32:25,179 --> 00:32:26,860
Yes, they'd had the affliction.

661
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,000
Yes, they had dealt with this.

662
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,659
But I want you to understand from this passage of scripture

663
00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:31,940
that guess what Paul did?

664
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:35,019
Paul had let them know, he tells them in verse number four,

665
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:36,739
that while I was with you, by the way,

666
00:32:36,739 --> 00:32:38,619
he was only there for a short time.

667
00:32:38,619 --> 00:32:41,039
But one of the things that he taught the believers

668
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:45,159
in Thessalonica was that we should suffer tribulation.

669
00:32:47,139 --> 00:32:50,779
We read it in 2 Timothy as we studied that book last year.

670
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:54,080
All those that live godly in Christ Jesus

671
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,099
shall suffer persecution.

672
00:32:58,039 --> 00:33:01,599
I hope this morning that as we know these truths

673
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:03,599
that we're being encouraged,

674
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:05,559
you say, I'm not encouraged to suffer.

675
00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:10,360
Yeah, but it's the comfort part that should encourage us.

676
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:14,279
Because if the comfort part is left out,

677
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:15,799
there is no encouragement.

678
00:33:16,839 --> 00:33:20,379
If the verse simply tells us that you're gonna suffer,

679
00:33:20,379 --> 00:33:22,519
you're gonna have trouble, you're gonna have distress,

680
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:25,279
but there's no hope of God coming alongside

681
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:27,440
and giving us that comfort,

682
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,919
we just leave here miserable.

683
00:33:33,319 --> 00:33:37,919
But we're encouraged because God is the God of all comfort.

684
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:43,059
We see the experience, we see the encouragement from Paul.

685
00:33:43,059 --> 00:33:45,199
I want you to understand number three

686
00:33:45,199 --> 00:33:46,879
as we close quickly this morning,

687
00:33:46,879 --> 00:33:49,279
the expectation for every believer.

688
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:51,839
What should I expect?

689
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:55,759
As we begin to look at this passage of Scripture

690
00:33:55,759 --> 00:33:59,159
and begin to think about my expectation, your expectation,

691
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:02,519
as we begin to even try to take the principles

692
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:05,119
of this passage of Scripture and apply it in our lives

693
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:07,000
and say, practically speaking,

694
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,259
what does this look like in my life?

695
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,659
We know from our text of Scripture

696
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:14,080
that it's absolutely imperative

697
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,619
that we put our trust in the Lord.

698
00:34:15,619 --> 00:34:17,440
Notice in verse number eight, he says,

699
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,839
for we would not, brethren, have you ignorant

700
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:22,079
of our trouble, which came to us in Asia

701
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:23,479
that we were pressed out of measure,

702
00:34:23,479 --> 00:34:26,119
above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life,

703
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:28,519
but we had the sentence of death in ourselves.

704
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:31,799
Notice this, that we should not trust in ourselves,

705
00:34:31,799 --> 00:34:36,440
but in God, which raiseth the dead.

706
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,440
You know what I find here in this verse of Scripture

707
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,279
in verse number nine?

708
00:34:39,279 --> 00:34:41,720
I find transparency.

709
00:34:44,279 --> 00:34:46,919
Because the right answer is trust in the Lord

710
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:48,880
with all thine heart and lean not

711
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,839
into thine own understanding.

712
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,320
Is that not the right answer?

713
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:54,199
But you know what the reality is?

714
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:55,720
We trust in ourselves.

715
00:34:57,799 --> 00:35:01,399
We trust in ourselves until something comes

716
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:05,720
that's so big and so overwhelming

717
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,600
that we can't trust in ourselves.

718
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:14,799
Paul says, we had the sentence of death in ourselves

719
00:35:14,799 --> 00:35:19,199
that we should not trust in ourselves,

720
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:24,199
but in God, which raiseth the dead.

721
00:35:24,959 --> 00:35:26,440
You know, there are times in which God

722
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:29,160
will allow circumstances in your life and my life

723
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,199
that are so big that we absolutely

724
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:35,679
just can't trust ourselves.

725
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:38,160
You know why?

726
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,479
He wants us to trust him.

727
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,119
What are we dealing with on Wednesday night?

728
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:46,720
In the Lord put I my trust.

729
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,519
I said this, that little word put,

730
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:54,079
it eliminates all passivity.

731
00:35:56,359 --> 00:35:57,199
Why?

732
00:35:57,199 --> 00:35:59,639
Because it's a deliberate decision.

733
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:01,600
If I put something somewhere,

734
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:05,959
I actively, purposefully do it.

735
00:36:05,959 --> 00:36:08,720
I put this here.

736
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,839
It didn't just end up there.

737
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:15,479
I put my Bible on the Lord's supper table, right?

738
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,279
That was not passive.

739
00:36:18,279 --> 00:36:19,199
That was deliberate.

740
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:20,040
Would you agree?

741
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,959
So the psalmist says in the Lord put I my trust.

742
00:36:25,959 --> 00:36:28,479
God wants us to trust him.

743
00:36:28,479 --> 00:36:29,839
Trust and obey.

744
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:33,119
We sing the song.

745
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:34,679
God wants us to trust him.

746
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:40,160
But so often, we trust ourselves.

747
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:45,160
For the day by day things.

748
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:51,639
See, we know that we can't trust ourselves for eternity.

749
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:53,880
Well, we know that.

750
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,320
So we trust him for eternity.

751
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,239
But for tomorrow, I'm gonna go ahead

752
00:37:01,239 --> 00:37:03,440
and try to take care of that one by myself.

753
00:37:04,519 --> 00:37:06,760
I'm just telling you how it works practically

754
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,000
and how we need to grow.

755
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,399
And listen, God will bring things in your life

756
00:37:13,399 --> 00:37:17,760
and in my life where we can't trust ourselves.

757
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:21,440
And by the way, that's a good thing.

758
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,359
See, but I don't want that hard thing.

759
00:37:24,359 --> 00:37:26,679
I understand, but it's a good thing to learn.

760
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,919
It's a good thing to learn.

761
00:37:29,919 --> 00:37:32,399
When you come out on the other side of that storm,

762
00:37:32,399 --> 00:37:36,639
on that difficulty, you've learned what a blessing it is

763
00:37:37,479 --> 00:37:40,600
to trust the Lord and what he's able to do.

764
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:43,199
Listen, he is able to do so much greater

765
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:45,279
than you or I could ever do.

766
00:37:46,519 --> 00:37:51,440
And we find that Paul says that this thing was so,

767
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:56,160
so pressing and we despaired even of life

768
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,760
that we understand the importance of trusting the Lord.

769
00:38:00,959 --> 00:38:04,199
Now notice what he says as we consider this expectation

770
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:05,239
that we'd have.

771
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,079
In verse number 10, he says,

772
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:12,440
who delivered us from so great a death?

773
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:16,279
Now, as we look at that phrase in verse number 10,

774
00:38:16,279 --> 00:38:18,919
to begin this verse, we find that he's speaking

775
00:38:18,919 --> 00:38:20,600
about a past experience.

776
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:25,600
Who delivered us from so great a death?

777
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:30,320
I hope this morning that you have some past experiences

778
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,640
of how God has worked and what God has done

779
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:36,640
and that you can reference those things in your life.

780
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,039
But he goes from past to present.

781
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:42,159
He says, who delivered us from so great a death

782
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:45,320
and doth deliver?

783
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,599
God is still delivering.

784
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:48,239
God is still working.

785
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:49,719
He had this issue.

786
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:52,520
He continues, remember, he said in verse number five

787
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:55,479
that the sufferings of Christ abound in us.

788
00:38:56,839 --> 00:38:59,719
And Paul says, he delivered,

789
00:38:59,719 --> 00:39:03,080
but he's also, he doth and doth deliver.

790
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:06,000
But then he goes into the expectation

791
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,359
dealing with the future.

792
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:12,359
He says, in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us.

793
00:39:16,839 --> 00:39:19,279
You know, it's interesting to see how God works.

794
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,679
And oftentimes, the testimony is the result of the test

795
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:25,400
or the trial, is it not true?

796
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,919
When we begin to read about various aspects

797
00:39:28,919 --> 00:39:32,200
of great miracles of God and great records

798
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:35,039
that God has given us, these accounts in his word

799
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:37,039
that cause us to rejoice so greatly.

800
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:39,960
Listen, you would know nothing about Shadrach, Meshach

801
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,559
and Abednego if there was not a fiery furnace.

802
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,000
But there was a fiery furnace.

803
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,960
And most every child that has grown up

804
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:57,599
in a church like ours has heard

805
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:01,159
and probably heard many times the account.

806
00:40:01,159 --> 00:40:08,479
of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. Why? Because there was a fiery furnace. There's a great

807
00:40:08,479 --> 00:40:17,199
testimony. There's great praise. That's the result of a test or a trial. How many times

808
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:21,639
our young people have heard, how many times if you've taught in Sunday school or in junior

809
00:40:21,639 --> 00:40:28,759
church or in some vacation Bible school, you teach about Daniel praying and Daniel being

810
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:35,159
cast into the den of lions? Again, if there's no den of lions, there's no need to know about

811
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:45,479
Daniel praying. But we read these wonderful accounts because our God delivers. And we

812
00:40:45,479 --> 00:40:51,439
find that Paul says, this is my expectation. My expectation is that he has delivered. He

813
00:40:51,439 --> 00:40:57,559
is delivering and he's going to continue to deliver. His expectation and your expectation

814
00:40:57,559 --> 00:41:05,559
and my expectation should be that God has comforted. He is comforting and he will comfort.

815
00:41:05,559 --> 00:41:12,079
That God is the same yesterday, today and forever. That God will not leave us nor forsake

816
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:16,039
us. That God knows what we're dealing with. He knows what we're facing and he's going

817
00:41:16,039 --> 00:41:20,719
to come alongside us and he's going to provide for us the encouragement and the strength

818
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:29,959
that we need. And this is the expectation that he has. We find that in verse number

819
00:41:29,959 --> 00:41:35,399
three, we're really, we dealt with verse one and two as introductory, you know, salutation

820
00:41:35,399 --> 00:41:41,839
type discussion. But in verses three through 11, really the text this morning, it's amazing

821
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:47,419
to me if I look at this text and think about book ends, if you will. In verse number three,

822
00:41:47,419 --> 00:41:52,779
it's the power of praise, but in verse number 11, it's the power of prayer. Notice what

823
00:41:52,779 --> 00:42:00,219
he says in verse number 11, ye also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift

824
00:42:00,219 --> 00:42:07,259
bestowed upon us by the means of many persons, thanks may be given by many on our behalf.

825
00:42:07,259 --> 00:42:14,399
We find that Paul understood that praise changes things and the power of praise in verse number

826
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:19,639
three as he begins, blessed be God, but he also understands the power of prayer and

827
00:42:19,639 --> 00:42:26,239
how prayer changes things by saying ye also helping together by prayer for us. Let me

828
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:35,039
ask you this, why do we pray? Why do we pray? Simply because we've been told to? Or do we

829
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:41,959
pray because we expect that God hears and we expect that God will answer? That's why

830
00:42:41,959 --> 00:42:52,079
I pray. Listen, prayer is not a religious exercise. It's not rote religion. It's not

831
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:57,999
now I lay me down to sleep. No, no, no. I'm talking to the God of the universe. I'm talking

832
00:42:57,999 --> 00:43:02,239
to my father. I'm talking to the creator. I'm talking to the one that said, let there

833
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:07,239
be light and there was light. I'm talking to the one that said, call unto me and I will

834
00:43:07,239 --> 00:43:12,799
answer thee and show thee great and mighty things, which now know us not. And we find

835
00:43:12,799 --> 00:43:18,279
that we're living in this time that we see the expectation that has been given to us.

836
00:43:18,279 --> 00:43:24,439
And Paul says, I'm praying and I'm asking for you that ye also helping together by prayer

837
00:43:24,439 --> 00:43:33,599
for us. Why? Because God answers prayer and that's the expectation.

838
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:43,079
This morning, God is no respecter of persons. He's no respecter of persons. His grace is

839
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:49,799
sufficient for me. But can I tell you this morning that his grace is sufficient for you?

840
00:43:49,799 --> 00:43:58,479
Can I tell you this morning that God will comfort me in my suffering? God will comfort

841
00:43:58,479 --> 00:44:03,239
me. He'll come alongside me as he did with Paul and as he would for these believers in

842
00:44:03,239 --> 00:44:09,399
Corinth and he'll come alongside me and he'll encourage me and he'll strengthen me. But

843
00:44:09,399 --> 00:44:13,919
can I tell you this morning, he will for you as well. You say, pastor, I'm just dealing

844
00:44:13,919 --> 00:44:21,779
with some things. I'm just suffering. I understand. Our God is the God of all comfort and with

845
00:44:21,779 --> 00:44:30,699
suffering comes comfort. And this is the expectation that these believers in Corinth

846
00:44:30,699 --> 00:44:36,699
should have after they receive the encouragement from Paul. Remember, he didn't share his experience

847
00:44:36,699 --> 00:44:43,619
for sympathy. He shared his experience in order to encourage them. Listen, this morning,

848
00:44:43,619 --> 00:44:49,979
when you have experienced the comfort of God, when you have experienced the grace of God,

849
00:44:49,979 --> 00:44:56,659
you know what you want someone else that's suffering to experience? The same thing. Because

850
00:44:56,659 --> 00:45:03,459
you know that there's nothing you can do for them but there's everything that God can do

851
00:45:03,459 --> 00:45:12,939
for them because he is the God of all comfort. This morning, with suffering comes comfort.

852
00:45:12,939 --> 00:45:18,419
I don't like suffering just like the next person but I'm so thankful that our God is

853
00:45:18,419 --> 00:45:24,179
the God of all comfort. Let's pray. Father, we love you. How we thank you for loving us.

854
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:31,419
We thank you, God, for your word. We thank you that your word is given to us for practical

855
00:45:31,419 --> 00:45:38,899
Christian living. And God, there's not one person under the sound of my voice today that

856
00:45:38,899 --> 00:45:47,179
will live life apart from suffering. We may at this moment, at this hour, we may not be

857
00:45:47,179 --> 00:45:53,939
in the midst of a storm, in the midst of a trial, in the midst of trouble, but God,

858
00:45:53,939 --> 00:46:07,419
we know that suffering will come. But how we rejoice in knowing that the comfort of

859
00:46:07,419 --> 00:46:17,859
God will abound as well. I pray this morning that you would help us, Lord. Come alongside

860
00:46:17,859 --> 00:46:24,299
us. Thank you that you promise you'd never leave us nor forsake us. When things get tough,

861
00:46:24,299 --> 00:46:33,579
when things get hard, friends may forsake us. But God, you'll be right there with us.

862
00:46:33,579 --> 00:46:40,939
God, I pray this morning you'd help us to thank you and to rejoice in knowing these

863
00:46:40,939 --> 00:46:49,459
wonderful Bible truths, but to understand that you've given them to us to be lived out

864
00:46:49,459 --> 00:46:55,059
practically. Would you move and work in the time of invitation? Would you have your will

865
00:46:55,059 --> 00:47:00,939
and way? If there's one here that's not sure of heaven, God, I pray that today be the day

866
00:47:00,939 --> 00:47:06,659
of their salvation. For every child of God, would you help us, Lord, to be responsive

867
00:47:06,659 --> 00:47:10,819
and we'll thank you for it. In Christ's name we pray. Would you stand with me? Heads

868
00:47:10,819 --> 00:47:16,099
are bowed, eyes are closed. Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano and as she does,

869
00:47:16,099 --> 00:47:20,199
the altar is open. If you're not sure of heaven this morning, we'd love to take a Bible and

870
00:47:20,199 --> 00:47:24,739
show you how you can know for sure that heaven is your home. You come down and meet us down

871
00:47:24,739 --> 00:47:27,619
here, we'll take a Bible and show you how you can know for sure that heaven is your

872
00:47:27,619 --> 00:47:31,579
home. Maybe this morning you just need to come and thank God for who He is, that He

873
00:47:31,579 --> 00:47:35,939
is the God of all comfort, that He is the Father of mercies. Maybe you're suffering

874
00:47:35,939 --> 00:47:44,539
and say, God, I thank you that you provide the comfort that I need. As Kimberly plays,

875
00:47:44,539 --> 00:47:45,539
the altar is open.
