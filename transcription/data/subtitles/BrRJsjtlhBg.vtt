00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.739
Second Corinthians, chapter number one, God's grace is sufficient.

00:00:05.739 --> 00:00:08.539
Aren't you thankful for that wonderful Bible truth?

00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:14.039
I hope that even in the last week that you have experienced the grace of God

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:18.620
in your lives, that you have found that God's grace is sufficient.

00:00:18.959 --> 00:00:22.459
We find that as we're going to study through this book of Second Corinthians

00:00:22.459 --> 00:00:24.860
that we begin here in chapter number one this morning,

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.299
we're looking at verses one through eleven.

00:00:27.299 --> 00:00:31.600
I've titled the message this with suffering comes comfort.

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:35.299
With suffering comes comfort.

00:00:35.599 --> 00:00:37.580
You say, I don't like talking about suffering.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.740
Yeah, but we all suffer.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.319
It's important that we understand the Bible truth

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:46.380
that we find in this passage of Scripture with regard to

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.180
with suffering comes comfort.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.319
We find that Paul ministered in Corinth.

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:53.119
He knew the church well.

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:56.180
His authority and his apostleship was being questioned

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.659
by some within the congregation, and thus we read the introduction

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:04.620
that we do notice in verse number one of Second Corinthians, chapter one.

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:09.699
Paul says Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ

00:01:09.699 --> 00:01:14.540
by the will of God, he notes his position in verse number one again.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.440
His apostleship, his leadership, his his authority

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.879
was being questioned by some within the church.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.180
And so he begins writing this letter under the inspiration

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.239
of the Holy Spirit of God.

00:01:25.239 --> 00:01:29.279
We understand that all Scripture is given by inspiration of God.

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:33.260
And he says, Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.279
Notice, he says, by the will of God.

00:01:37.059 --> 00:01:40.599
This was not Paul just determining, deciding one day.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.919
I think I'm going to be an apostle.

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:46.860
This was not Paul going and submitting an application

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.239
to become the next apostle.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.000
No, this was the will of God for his life.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
God placed a call and then God equipped the apostle

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.639
Paul in this position of being an apostle.

00:01:59.639 --> 00:02:03.980
We find that he clearly states that and he makes them understand

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.139
the truth that this is God's will for his life.

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:12.119
By the way, it's important that we know what God's will is for our lives,

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.619
that we understand that God has a purpose and a plan for each and every one of us.

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:18.839
And we understand that as we study the word of God,

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:24.020
that there are many times in which God will say this is the will of God for you.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.520
And we understand the truth of our sanctification,

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.759
that in everything we give thanks, understand

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:32.520
this is the will of God and Christ Jesus concerning you.

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.720
But then God has a plan for you individually.

00:02:35.919 --> 00:02:37.500
And I'm thankful for that.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.940
And I rejoice in it.

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.440
Notice he continues and Timothy, our brother.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.839
Now, Timothy, we believe, had just been there in Corinth,

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.500
had been ministering there and had opportunity to bring some word back

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.699
and what have you.

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:53.460
And so Timothy is mentioned under the church of God.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.600
By the way, aren't you thankful it's God's church? Amen.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.139
It's not my church, not your church.

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:02.179
It's God's church, which is at Corinth with all the saints,

00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:04.240
which are in all Achaia.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.679
So understand, as he's writing to the church in Corinth,

00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:10.619
as he writes the second letter, he had ministered there.

00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:12.080
He knew the church well.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.759
He'd already written one letter.

00:03:13.779 --> 00:03:16.279
We find that he's now writing this second letter.

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:19.720
It seems as if as you study the scriptures, that there's a third letter

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:24.559
that was probably written in between the first and second, but is not scripture.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.860
It does not mean that it was scripture and lost or anything like that.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.699
It just was not everything that Paul wrote was scripture.

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:33.699
All scripture is given by inspiration of God.

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:35.600
And this is in the canon of scripture.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.080
But we find that the city where the church is in Corinth,

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:44.300
but the region is Achaia, as you find at the end of verse number one

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.899
and all the saints, which are in all Achaia.

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:50.580
And so we understand, as you study the book of First Thessalonians,

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.880
that from them, from the church in Thessalonica,

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.080
sounded forth the word of God to Macedonia.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.020
That's the northern part of the Grecian Empire or the Grecian region,

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.619
the region of Greece there.

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:05.520
And we find that he then mentions about Achaia,

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.699
which would be that southern province of Greece.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.979
And so we find that he mentions that to the church in Thessalonica as well.

00:04:12.179 --> 00:04:13.860
And he's writing here to the believers.

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.359
Aren't you thankful that there are believers scattered all around the globe?

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:20.200
And he mentions about these that he's writing to.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.640
And he says this in verse two, grace

00:04:23.359 --> 00:04:27.239
be to you and peace from God, our father

00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:30.339
and from the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:32.440
I'm thankful for the grace of God.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.640
I'm thankful for the peace of God.

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.220
We mentioned last week, as we studied entirely dealing with the subject

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.820
that God's grace is sufficient, his saving grace, but also his enabling grace.

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:47.739
And we understand that God is the one who is gracious, who gives us grace.

00:04:47.739 --> 00:04:50.579
And we ought to rejoice in the grace of God.

00:04:50.579 --> 00:04:53.339
But we also see that he mentions the peace of God.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.299
He says in peace from God, our father and from the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:04:58.299 --> 00:05:01.779
we live in a world that's full of turmoil and difficulty

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:05.480
and all sorts of just craziness that's going on

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.679
and how we need the peace of God.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.720
He mentions in the book of Philippians that the peace of God,

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.880
which passeth all understanding, the book of Colossians,

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.519
that were to let the peace of God rule in our hearts.

00:05:20.519 --> 00:05:24.959
Perfect peace have they whose mind is stayed upon thee.

00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:29.399
And what a joy to know that our God gives grace and he gives peace.

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:32.299
And so we see this introduction that is given.

00:05:32.299 --> 00:05:35.540
But as we look at the primary text this morning from verses three

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:38.420
down to verse number 11, we find that Paul,

00:05:38.579 --> 00:05:42.100
we discover in this portion of scripture that he's informing the believers

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.420
about practical Christian living.

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.299
Now, it's important that we understand this this morning

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.579
because it's important that we know it's absolutely necessary

00:05:51.579 --> 00:05:54.299
that we as the people of God, that as believers,

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.500
that we move from principle to practice.

00:05:59.899 --> 00:06:01.059
Let me say this.

00:06:01.059 --> 00:06:02.980
The Bible is not just a book of theory.

00:06:04.739 --> 00:06:06.820
The Bible is not a book of theory.

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.980
There are principles that are in the Bible,

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:14.739
but we find that the Bible is a book, a divine book, a book from our father,

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.179
that he gives us practical instruction

00:06:18.459 --> 00:06:23.420
that needs to be implied in the life of every child of God.

00:06:23.899 --> 00:06:26.660
We move from principle to practice.

00:06:26.679 --> 00:06:29.720
We understand that as we look at the portion of scripture.

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.359
In fact, I believe that verse four gives us a great principle.

00:06:32.359 --> 00:06:33.720
We'll look at it in just a moment.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.799
But then we move forward and we see the practical outworking of that principle.

00:06:37.799 --> 00:06:42.799
And that's what we see that here is Paul is writing to these believers in Corinth.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:49.040
He's helping us to understand this aspect of practical Christian living.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:54.320
As I preach and as I teach and as I read and study for my own,

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:58.619
as I look at God's word, I'm always looking for what is the application?

00:06:58.899 --> 00:07:00.260
What does God have for us?

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:05.260
Because it's not just that we have this mountain of facts and mountain of of theory

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:07.859
and what have you, principles,

00:07:07.859 --> 00:07:12.859
but we take and we understand that these principles are to be implied in our

00:07:12.859 --> 00:07:17.260
lives and we're to live it out in practical Christian living.

00:07:18.739 --> 00:07:21.260
He begins with praise in verse number three,

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.380
and it's so important that we see that.

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:24.679
We'll mention in just a moment,

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:28.200
but we find that Paul, he's no stranger to suffering.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.559
You know about the apostle Paul.

00:07:30.559 --> 00:07:33.880
You read his life all through the new Testament and you find that he's no

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:36.440
stranger to suffering. He's no stranger to trouble.

00:07:36.559 --> 00:07:41.320
We find that although he had experienced trouble and although he'd experienced

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:41.839
suffering,

00:07:41.839 --> 00:07:46.839
we find that he knew the comfort of God in a deep and a personal way.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.799
The comfort of God. Notice the word comfort, comforted,

00:07:53.059 --> 00:07:55.500
comforted or consolation.

00:07:55.859 --> 00:07:58.619
And all of those words have for the same Greek word,

00:07:58.619 --> 00:08:00.140
the same root word in the Greek.

00:08:00.299 --> 00:08:04.140
Those four English words are translated from that same root word in the Greek

00:08:04.339 --> 00:08:09.260
that those words are used 10 times in verses three through seven,

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:15.380
10 times in four verses. He uses the word comfort,

00:08:15.579 --> 00:08:18.820
comforted, comforted or consolation.

00:08:19.059 --> 00:08:23.239
You think God wants us to know something about comfort and understanding it?

00:08:23.239 --> 00:08:26.959
Listen, the word comfort means this. It means to call to one side.

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:31.679
It means to encourage and strengthen by consolation.

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:33.440
As we look at this word comfort,

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:37.400
biblically speaking and we understand it's the same word that is used in

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.520
describing the ministry of the Holy Spirit of God,

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:44.520
that he is given the name of being the comforter in John chapter 14.

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:46.059
In John chapter 14.

00:08:46.219 --> 00:08:49.380
But we find here that as we begin to think about the comfort, listen,

00:08:49.539 --> 00:08:50.460
it's not the,

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:55.460
the idea of biblical comfort and the comfort that God gives us as people is not

00:08:56.099 --> 00:08:57.460
some kind of sympathy.

00:08:59.179 --> 00:09:04.179
It's that God comes along our side to encourage us,

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:09.780
to strengthen us through whatever trial or turmoil that we're facing so that we

00:09:10.679 --> 00:09:15.280
can complete the course that God has for us.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:18.119
As we begin looking here in this text of scripture,

00:09:18.119 --> 00:09:20.960
I want you to notice number one, the experience of Paul.

00:09:21.119 --> 00:09:24.840
We see it in verses three through five and really kind of scattered throughout

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:27.799
the remainder of the text that we'll look at this morning.

00:09:27.799 --> 00:09:31.520
But we see the experience of Paul and we find that it begins with praise.

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:34.640
I mentioned that a moment ago, but notice in verse number three, he says,

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:38.119
blessed be God, literally praise be to God.

00:09:39.099 --> 00:09:41.700
How important that we noticed this morning, uh,

00:09:41.739 --> 00:09:46.739
that Paul begins with praise and how appropriate would be for you in your life

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:51.659
and for me in my life to, to begin with praise, to begin with adoration,

00:09:51.659 --> 00:09:54.140
to lift high the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:57.440
to understand who he is and what he's done for us.

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:00.059
And you understand that praise changes.

00:10:00.059 --> 00:10:04.939
Praise changes your focus, it changes your perspective,

00:10:04.939 --> 00:10:08.219
it changes everything about what you're dealing with.

00:10:08.219 --> 00:10:09.059
Why?

00:10:09.059 --> 00:10:12.379
Because you're choosing not to just complain

00:10:12.379 --> 00:10:13.539
and have a pity party.

00:10:13.539 --> 00:10:16.819
No, you're choosing to fix your attention upon God

00:10:16.819 --> 00:10:18.379
and begin to praise Him.

00:10:19.379 --> 00:10:20.279
We find that He says,

00:10:20.279 --> 00:10:24.459
"'Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,

00:10:24.459 --> 00:10:29.459
"'the Father of mercies and the God of all comfort.'"

00:10:29.979 --> 00:10:32.699
Notice the two phrases that are used

00:10:32.699 --> 00:10:33.859
at the end of verse number three,

00:10:33.859 --> 00:10:36.399
that He is the Father of mercies.

00:10:36.399 --> 00:10:38.379
How often we need mercy in our lives,

00:10:38.379 --> 00:10:40.559
we speak much about grace and we read it

00:10:40.559 --> 00:10:41.959
in verse number two already,

00:10:41.959 --> 00:10:44.399
and we've spoke about it in great length last week,

00:10:44.399 --> 00:10:46.179
but we find that He now mentions

00:10:46.179 --> 00:10:48.979
that God is the Father of mercies.

00:10:50.259 --> 00:10:51.779
But not only the Father of mercies,

00:10:51.779 --> 00:10:56.779
but the God, notice what it says, of all comfort.

00:10:56.819 --> 00:10:58.859
He's the God of all comfort.

00:10:58.939 --> 00:11:02.459
And Paul begins to share his experience here.

00:11:02.459 --> 00:11:05.099
He gives the principle in verse number four,

00:11:05.099 --> 00:11:08.899
who, speaking of the God who is the Father of mercies,

00:11:08.899 --> 00:11:09.979
the God of all comfort,

00:11:09.979 --> 00:11:14.220
who comforted us in all our tribulation,

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:16.779
that we may be able to comfort them,

00:11:16.779 --> 00:11:19.059
which are in any trouble by the comfort

00:11:19.059 --> 00:11:24.059
wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.

00:11:24.059 --> 00:11:26.559
This is a great principle in verse number four,

00:11:26.559 --> 00:11:29.319
that God provides comfort for His people,

00:11:29.319 --> 00:11:32.839
who then in turn can provide comfort for others.

00:11:32.839 --> 00:11:35.540
But Paul, as he deals with this principle

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:37.639
that is stated to us in verse number four,

00:11:37.639 --> 00:11:39.839
he does not wanna simply look at a principle,

00:11:39.839 --> 00:11:41.720
he doesn't wanna simply look at a theory,

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:44.399
he wants the believers in Corinth to understand

00:11:44.399 --> 00:11:46.559
that this truth, this principle,

00:11:46.559 --> 00:11:50.399
this truth about who God is and how God works,

00:11:50.399 --> 00:11:52.279
that he wants them to be able to see

00:11:52.279 --> 00:11:56.639
that this is real Christian living.

00:11:56.639 --> 00:11:58.919
This is something that he experienced,

00:11:58.919 --> 00:12:01.000
it's not something that we just talk about,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.759
hey, our God is able to,

00:12:02.759 --> 00:12:04.319
hey, our God answers prayer.

00:12:04.319 --> 00:12:06.439
The reality is that we can talk about

00:12:06.439 --> 00:12:09.160
and we can preach about how God answers prayer,

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.759
but you know what's so much more impactful

00:12:11.759 --> 00:12:16.539
is when God answers your prayer, amen?

00:12:16.539 --> 00:12:19.160
When God works in your life, when you see,

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:22.399
listen, it's an amazing, why does God use us

00:12:22.399 --> 00:12:24.679
to be able to share the gospel with other people?

00:12:24.679 --> 00:12:27.239
Because we've been saved by the grace of God.

00:12:27.239 --> 00:12:29.279
And someone that's been saved by the grace of God

00:12:29.279 --> 00:12:31.599
who had no hope, who had no direction,

00:12:31.599 --> 00:12:33.619
who had no confidence of heaven

00:12:33.619 --> 00:12:36.759
is then able to share with someone else

00:12:36.759 --> 00:12:38.959
what God did for them.

00:12:38.959 --> 00:12:42.319
The angels, they cannot share the gospel

00:12:42.319 --> 00:12:45.239
of the Lord Jesus Christ as we look at the time

00:12:45.239 --> 00:12:47.800
in which we're facing today and what we're dealing with.

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:51.360
Look, Peter talks about how the angels look steadfastly,

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:54.500
but they're not saved like we're saved.

00:12:55.360 --> 00:13:00.360
You see, when we look at the comfort that God gives,

00:13:00.679 --> 00:13:03.839
someone who has experienced that

00:13:03.839 --> 00:13:06.239
can then share that experience with someone else

00:13:06.239 --> 00:13:08.800
and say, listen, this isn't just theory,

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:13.059
this isn't just principle, this is practical living.

00:13:14.199 --> 00:13:17.119
I have gone through some trials,

00:13:17.119 --> 00:13:19.039
I've faced some suffering,

00:13:19.039 --> 00:13:22.160
but oh, let me tell you about the comfort that God gave.

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:25.039
Oh, let me tell you about how God came along my side

00:13:25.039 --> 00:13:28.199
and how God walked with me and God helped me.

00:13:28.199 --> 00:13:31.800
And Paul begins to share this experience we know

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:34.080
in our text of scripture that he experienced

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:35.559
according to verse number five,

00:13:35.559 --> 00:13:36.919
he talks about the sufferings.

00:13:36.919 --> 00:13:39.000
Notice, for as the sufferings of Christ,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.099
notice what he says, abound in us.

00:13:44.279 --> 00:13:46.720
Paul didn't just have one thing that he suffered from,

00:13:46.759 --> 00:13:49.959
he said the sufferings of Christ abound in us.

00:13:49.959 --> 00:13:51.360
I've mentioned this before,

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:52.759
and you know it to be the truth

00:13:52.759 --> 00:13:54.839
if you study throughout the New Testament,

00:13:54.839 --> 00:13:56.720
that many times Paul suffered

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.919
simply because he was obeying God.

00:13:59.759 --> 00:14:02.279
He was suffering as a result of his obedience,

00:14:02.279 --> 00:14:05.380
and he says that these sufferings, they abound in us.

00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:08.639
In just a few verses, he's gonna share not the details,

00:14:08.639 --> 00:14:11.199
but the reference of some suffering that he had

00:14:11.199 --> 00:14:12.360
while he was in Asia.

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:15.720
We find that in this particular book in 2 Corinthians,

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:18.359
we find that later on, he's going to go

00:14:18.359 --> 00:14:20.519
and he's gonna deal in chapter number 11,

00:14:20.519 --> 00:14:23.239
and he's gonna talk about all of these various things

00:14:23.239 --> 00:14:26.119
that he suffered, and he's gonna go through this list

00:14:26.119 --> 00:14:27.440
in chapter number 11.

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.880
And listen, we look at the Apostle Paul,

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:31.559
and he was acquainted with these things,

00:14:31.559 --> 00:14:33.160
he experienced these things,

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.440
and he speaks of the suffering, the affliction.

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:38.839
Notice in verse five, for as the sufferings of Christ

00:14:38.839 --> 00:14:43.320
abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ.

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:46.839
What we see in verse six, and whether we be afflicted,

00:14:47.919 --> 00:14:50.600
it is for your consolation and salvation,

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:54.239
which is effectual, it's effective, it works,

00:14:54.239 --> 00:14:55.959
in the enduring of the same sufferings,

00:14:55.959 --> 00:14:58.639
which we also suffer, or whether we be comforted,

00:14:58.639 --> 00:15:01.200
it is for your consolation and salvation.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:04.320
Notice in verse number eight, he continues,

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.480
he talks about his suffering in verse number five,

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:08.239
his affliction in verse number six,

00:15:08.239 --> 00:15:11.119
and verse number eight, for we would not, brethren,

00:15:11.119 --> 00:15:13.639
have you ignorant of our trouble,

00:15:13.639 --> 00:15:15.600
which came to us in Asia.

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:19.359
He begins to describe, not the specifics of the trouble,

00:15:19.359 --> 00:15:23.720
but the impact of this trouble, and how it affected them.

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:25.519
Notice what he says in verse eight,

00:15:25.519 --> 00:15:27.839
and as he continues and expounds upon it

00:15:27.839 --> 00:15:30.720
into verse number nine, he says that this trouble,

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:34.440
notice how he refers to it, he says that we were pressed

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:38.440
out of measure, we were pressed out of measure.

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:41.959
He says this, above strength, in so much

00:15:41.959 --> 00:15:46.359
that we despaired even of life.

00:15:48.959 --> 00:15:52.440
The thought of death was real.

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:54.139
If you look at verse number nine, he says,

00:15:54.139 --> 00:15:57.839
but we had the sentence of death in ourselves,

00:15:57.839 --> 00:16:01.040
and the reality is that you know, and I know,

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:05.000
that there were many that desired to kill Paul.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.720
They did not like what he was doing,

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:07.880
they didn't like the preaching,

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:09.600
they didn't like his ministry.

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.959
In fact, there were men that made the decision,

00:16:11.959 --> 00:16:14.359
they made the covenant, if you will,

00:16:14.359 --> 00:16:16.440
that they would not eat, and they would not drink

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:19.320
until they killed Paul.

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:23.480
Paul says, I was pressed out of measure.

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:31.079
Above strength, in so much that we despaired even of life,

00:16:31.079 --> 00:16:33.559
we had the sentence of death in ourselves

00:16:33.559 --> 00:16:35.179
that we should not trust in ourselves,

00:16:35.179 --> 00:16:38.660
but in God, which raiseth the dead.

00:16:40.739 --> 00:16:44.579
Paul experienced some things that we see

00:16:44.579 --> 00:16:47.660
or described as tribulation, suffering, affliction,

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:49.940
trouble, being pressed out of measure,

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:53.059
but I want you to understand that Paul

00:16:53.059 --> 00:16:55.299
also experienced the comfort of God.

00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:58.179
As we know in each of these verses,

00:16:58.179 --> 00:17:01.260
that not only does the apostle Paul mention

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.579
about the trial or the suffering,

00:17:03.579 --> 00:17:06.220
but we find that he's quick to reference

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:08.940
the comfort that only God can give.

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:11.179
We find that in verse number four,

00:17:11.179 --> 00:17:13.859
he gives that principle, but notice in verse number five,

00:17:13.859 --> 00:17:15.700
as he talks about the experience,

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:16.940
he says in verse number five,

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:20.739
for as the sufferings of Christ abound in us,

00:17:20.739 --> 00:17:25.739
notice, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ.

00:17:27.899 --> 00:17:32.459
Listen, as the sufferings came, there came comfort.

00:17:32.459 --> 00:17:34.540
As he experienced the suffering,

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:36.980
he experienced the comfort of God.

00:17:38.459 --> 00:17:43.459
As he dealt with the trouble, God stood with him.

00:17:43.459 --> 00:17:46.339
God came alongside him.

00:17:46.339 --> 00:17:50.980
God encouraged him and God strengthened him.

00:17:52.019 --> 00:17:54.760
Reminded of what we read several weeks ago

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:57.419
as we finished up the book of 2 Timothy

00:17:57.419 --> 00:17:59.579
and our theme for last year of continue,

00:17:59.579 --> 00:18:01.619
that in 2 Timothy chapter four

00:18:01.619 --> 00:18:05.459
and in verse number 17 that Paul made this declaration,

00:18:05.459 --> 00:18:09.179
notwithstanding the Lord stood with me

00:18:09.179 --> 00:18:12.139
and strengthened me that by me,

00:18:12.139 --> 00:18:14.339
the preaching might be fully known

00:18:14.339 --> 00:18:16.500
and that all the Gentiles might hear

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:21.339
and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.

00:18:21.339 --> 00:18:22.859
Paul says, the Lord stood with me,

00:18:22.859 --> 00:18:25.419
the Lord strengthened me.

00:18:25.419 --> 00:18:27.779
As he's writing to Timothy, his son in the faith

00:18:27.779 --> 00:18:30.619
in 2 Timothy chapter four to encourage him

00:18:30.619 --> 00:18:32.820
and we find that here, Paul is saying,

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:35.460
yes, I experienced some difficulty.

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:38.380
I had some suffering but with suffering comes comfort

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:41.020
and I want you to know, believers at Corinth

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:43.380
and I want you to know as it's been preserved

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:46.099
for all of God's people this morning

00:18:46.099 --> 00:18:49.659
that when you suffer and you experience the suffering,

00:18:49.659 --> 00:18:51.340
the trouble, the difficulties

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:53.659
that you can understand this morning

00:18:53.659 --> 00:18:57.779
and you can expect to experience the comfort of God

00:18:58.779 --> 00:19:01.099
in a real and personal way

00:19:02.179 --> 00:19:04.500
because our God knows where we are.

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:06.179
He knows our frame.

00:19:06.179 --> 00:19:07.859
He knows that we're but dust.

00:19:07.859 --> 00:19:09.500
He knows that we're frail

00:19:11.779 --> 00:19:13.260
and he comforts us.

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:17.500
We find that not only did he experience the comfort

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:20.659
that only God can give and by the way,

00:19:20.659 --> 00:19:22.179
I want you to understand this morning

00:19:22.179 --> 00:19:25.260
that God can comfort like no one else can comfort.

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:29.859
The reality is that you may have someone in your life

00:19:29.859 --> 00:19:34.619
that is a spouse or maybe someone else,

00:19:34.619 --> 00:19:37.059
a family member that can provide comfort

00:19:37.059 --> 00:19:40.580
but no one, no one can give you the comfort

00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:42.219
that you need like God can

00:19:45.099 --> 00:19:47.099
because God knows everything about you.

00:19:48.859 --> 00:19:51.500
He knows what you can't even express.

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:54.500
The sorrows of your heart

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:59.500
that you can't even put to words, God knows

00:19:59.779 --> 00:20:00.619
and God.

00:20:00.619 --> 00:20:04.319
God can give you the comfort that you need.

00:20:04.319 --> 00:20:06.219
We find that he experienced deliverance.

00:20:06.219 --> 00:20:07.559
Notice in verse 10, it said,

00:20:07.559 --> 00:20:11.659
who delivered us from so great a death?

00:20:11.659 --> 00:20:14.139
Paul experienced that deliverance that he spoke of

00:20:14.139 --> 00:20:16.339
in 2 Timothy chapter 4

00:20:16.339 --> 00:20:19.339
as he was writing to Timothy.

00:20:19.339 --> 00:20:22.899
This morning, so often we can talk about our suffering,

00:20:22.899 --> 00:20:24.979
so often we can talk about our troubles

00:20:24.979 --> 00:20:27.379
and our difficulties, our afflictions,

00:20:27.659 --> 00:20:30.579
all that we see that Paul is speaking of here,

00:20:30.579 --> 00:20:31.759
but I wonder this morning,

00:20:31.759 --> 00:20:33.619
how often do we focus on the fact

00:20:33.619 --> 00:20:36.159
that God is comforting me through all of that?

00:20:37.179 --> 00:20:39.379
That God is the one that is sustaining me,

00:20:39.379 --> 00:20:41.299
that he is the one that is strengthening me,

00:20:41.299 --> 00:20:45.259
that indeed he is the one that is strong

00:20:45.259 --> 00:20:48.579
and his strength is made perfect in my weakness.

00:20:50.619 --> 00:20:53.819
We find the experience of Paul,

00:20:53.819 --> 00:20:55.059
but I want you to see number two,

00:20:55.059 --> 00:20:57.899
the encouragement from Paul.

00:20:57.899 --> 00:21:00.059
I want you to see in verses six and seven

00:21:00.059 --> 00:21:03.939
how Paul is seeking not only to share his experience,

00:21:03.939 --> 00:21:07.379
but then to encourage these believers in Corinth.

00:21:07.379 --> 00:21:09.499
The encouragement from Paul.

00:21:09.499 --> 00:21:12.179
Understand with me this morning with great clarity

00:21:12.179 --> 00:21:14.379
that Paul is not sharing his experience

00:21:14.379 --> 00:21:15.919
in order to receive sympathy.

00:21:16.839 --> 00:21:18.659
Let me explain it this way.

00:21:18.659 --> 00:21:23.559
Paul doesn't need sympathy from the believers in Corinth.

00:21:23.559 --> 00:21:24.739
You know why?

00:21:25.419 --> 00:21:26.499
He's got God's comfort.

00:21:28.299 --> 00:21:31.459
He's not sharing his experience

00:21:31.459 --> 00:21:34.099
so that he can receive sympathy.

00:21:35.179 --> 00:21:36.419
If we're not careful,

00:21:36.419 --> 00:21:39.919
sometimes that's how we deal with things in life.

00:21:39.919 --> 00:21:42.459
We pick up the phone or we send a note

00:21:42.459 --> 00:21:45.299
or we meet with someone and we share all of our hardships

00:21:45.299 --> 00:21:46.779
and all of our difficulties

00:21:46.779 --> 00:21:49.499
because we want somebody to be sympathetic to us.

00:21:49.499 --> 00:21:51.119
We want sympathy.

00:21:51.119 --> 00:21:53.559
Paul did not need the sympathy

00:21:53.559 --> 00:21:55.559
from the believers in Corinth

00:21:56.439 --> 00:21:58.179
because he had God's comfort.

00:21:59.159 --> 00:22:03.519
And God's comfort is so much better

00:22:03.519 --> 00:22:06.279
than sympathy from anybody on this planet.

00:22:09.319 --> 00:22:11.319
God's comfort.

00:22:11.319 --> 00:22:12.819
He didn't need their sympathy.

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:15.879
I'm not trying to be unkind this morning,

00:22:15.879 --> 00:22:17.819
but I'm simply trying to help us understand

00:22:17.819 --> 00:22:21.459
the practical aspect of this passage of scripture.

00:22:22.419 --> 00:22:24.559
That when we're hurting,

00:22:24.559 --> 00:22:27.559
when we're dealing with suffering and trouble

00:22:27.559 --> 00:22:30.319
and affliction and persecution and distress

00:22:30.319 --> 00:22:32.539
and we're pressed out of measure,

00:22:32.539 --> 00:22:34.679
that God comforts.

00:22:35.539 --> 00:22:40.279
He comes alongside of us and he promises to do so.

00:22:40.279 --> 00:22:41.959
And if you've never experienced it,

00:22:41.959 --> 00:22:45.819
I'd simply say I'm sorry because you need to experience it.

00:22:46.759 --> 00:22:50.419
And so Paul is seeking to encourage these believers

00:22:50.419 --> 00:22:51.259
in Corinth.

00:22:51.259 --> 00:22:53.159
Again, he's not looking for their sympathy.

00:22:53.159 --> 00:22:54.360
He doesn't need it.

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:58.039
He simply wants to encourage them with this biblical truth.

00:22:58.039 --> 00:23:01.199
We find that he wanted these believers to be aware

00:23:01.199 --> 00:23:03.879
of the principle that he had learned in his life

00:23:03.879 --> 00:23:06.159
and the experience that he had

00:23:06.159 --> 00:23:08.479
from that principle becoming practice

00:23:08.479 --> 00:23:12.159
to dealing with the hardships and all of the opposition.

00:23:12.159 --> 00:23:14.479
Maybe I think about the apostle Paul,

00:23:14.479 --> 00:23:18.479
he would find out in a practical way in his life

00:23:18.479 --> 00:23:21.580
how Stephen could be martyred as he stood there

00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:25.699
and watched and had the grace of God all over his life.

00:23:26.979 --> 00:23:28.779
Because Paul stood there.

00:23:28.779 --> 00:23:33.739
Stephen's clothes were left at a young man's name, Saul.

00:23:33.739 --> 00:23:35.639
Is that what the Bible tells us?

00:23:38.059 --> 00:23:40.379
And when Paul, Saul at the time,

00:23:40.379 --> 00:23:43.619
witnessed that he saw the grace of God,

00:23:43.619 --> 00:23:46.459
he saw a man that was experiencing the comfort of God

00:23:46.459 --> 00:23:48.059
when people were stoning him

00:23:48.919 --> 00:23:50.519
and he was becoming the first martyr

00:23:50.519 --> 00:23:52.639
and he prays and all that happens.

00:23:52.639 --> 00:23:56.039
And then Paul lives after he gets saved

00:23:56.039 --> 00:24:00.639
and he then experiences that in his own life,

00:24:00.639 --> 00:24:03.879
how God stood with him and how God encouraged him

00:24:03.879 --> 00:24:05.519
and God comforted him.

00:24:05.519 --> 00:24:09.239
And we find that God is using Paul

00:24:09.239 --> 00:24:11.519
to encourage these believers

00:24:11.519 --> 00:24:14.879
that they would be aware of who God is,

00:24:14.879 --> 00:24:17.160
that he is the God of all comfort,

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:18.979
that he is the father of mercies,

00:24:18.979 --> 00:24:21.019
that he does come alongside

00:24:21.019 --> 00:24:23.820
and he wants them to experience the comfort of God.

00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:25.579
Notice what he says in verse six.

00:24:27.139 --> 00:24:30.179
And whether we be afflicted, notice what he says,

00:24:30.179 --> 00:24:33.380
it is for your consolation and salvation or deliverance.

00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:34.699
It's not speaking about salvation

00:24:34.699 --> 00:24:36.500
as being saved by the blood,

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:37.660
being saved, going to heaven,

00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:39.940
talking about deliverance here in the context.

00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:42.679
But we find here that he says that whether we be afflicted,

00:24:42.679 --> 00:24:45.059
it is for your consolation and salvation.

00:24:45.059 --> 00:24:45.899
Why?

00:24:45.919 --> 00:24:50.440
Because you're going to see through our experience

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:52.600
and then we are going to be able to,

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:54.479
the principle in verse number four,

00:24:54.479 --> 00:24:57.399
that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble.

00:24:57.399 --> 00:25:00.979
So we experience this and God allowed us to experience this

00:25:00.979 --> 00:25:03.000
so that we could help you.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.380
Does that make sense?

00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:06.500
And we find here that he says in verse six,

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:07.839
he continues and says,

00:25:07.839 --> 00:25:12.839
which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings

00:25:12.899 --> 00:25:15.479
which we also suffer.

00:25:17.179 --> 00:25:18.660
You're going to suffer.

00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:19.899
You say, man, I didn't come to church

00:25:19.899 --> 00:25:22.260
to find out I was going to suffer.

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:23.419
You didn't have to come to church

00:25:23.419 --> 00:25:24.500
to find out you had to suffer.

00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:25.339
You know what you do?

00:25:25.339 --> 00:25:27.179
You just live life

00:25:27.179 --> 00:25:29.100
and you find out that they're sufferings.

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:30.859
Am I not right?

00:25:30.859 --> 00:25:32.739
You don't have to come to church to hear a preacher tell you.

00:25:32.739 --> 00:25:35.139
I mean, I'm speaking on the authority of God's word,

00:25:35.139 --> 00:25:36.479
but what I'm saying to you this morning

00:25:36.479 --> 00:25:39.540
is that you live life and you know that sufferings come.

00:25:40.519 --> 00:25:43.399
So we look here and we see that he says,

00:25:43.399 --> 00:25:45.600
or whether we be comforted,

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:47.919
it is for your consolation and salvation.

00:25:47.919 --> 00:25:50.760
Again, we suffered for your benefit.

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:52.600
We're comforted for your benefit

00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:54.899
because I now can encourage you.

00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:58.079
Verse seven, notice what he says.

00:25:58.079 --> 00:25:59.720
So important in the whole key

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:02.079
of this passage of scripture this morning.

00:26:02.079 --> 00:26:06.839
And our hope of you is steadfast.

00:26:07.779 --> 00:26:12.779
Now remember hope biblically is a confident expectation.

00:26:13.899 --> 00:26:16.660
He said, our hope of you is steadfast.

00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:21.660
Know this, knowing that as ye are partakers

00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:28.540
of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the consolation.

00:26:31.959 --> 00:26:33.220
I hate to use this phrase

00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:35.579
because I think it could be taken out of context

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:37.079
and I don't mean it to be,

00:26:37.079 --> 00:26:40.239
but I hope you can understand why I'm using it.

00:26:40.239 --> 00:26:43.000
I find in verse number seven that what Paul is doing

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.260
is he's keeping it real.

00:26:46.359 --> 00:26:47.559
You're gonna suffer.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.239
You're gonna suffer.

00:26:50.239 --> 00:26:53.799
Listen, I don't like it when people paint this pie

00:26:53.799 --> 00:26:56.160
in the sky kind of a picture of life.

00:26:57.199 --> 00:26:59.959
The prosperity gospel preachers that are out there,

00:26:59.959 --> 00:27:02.160
hey, just come give your life to Jesus

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:03.320
and everything's gonna be great

00:27:03.339 --> 00:27:05.619
and make sure you keep giving me money too, by the way,

00:27:05.619 --> 00:27:06.940
and then it will come back to you.

00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:08.679
I mean, it's nonsense.

00:27:10.139 --> 00:27:11.679
Because as you study the word of God,

00:27:11.679 --> 00:27:13.139
you know what you find?

00:27:13.139 --> 00:27:14.859
That the people of God suffer,

00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:19.059
but it's for God's glory.

00:27:19.059 --> 00:27:20.440
It's for God's glory.

00:27:21.339 --> 00:27:26.339
And he says, knowing that as ye are partakers

00:27:28.019 --> 00:27:33.019
of the sufferings, so shall you be also of the consolation.

00:27:33.619 --> 00:27:35.959
Now, Paul knew some things that they were dealing with,

00:27:35.959 --> 00:27:39.100
no doubt, that was specific in their lives

00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:41.699
and some things that perhaps they were even going through

00:27:41.699 --> 00:27:43.059
and we're gonna study through the book

00:27:43.059 --> 00:27:45.739
and we'll find a number of things that could be referenced,

00:27:45.739 --> 00:27:49.339
but the reality is that whether I know specifically

00:27:49.339 --> 00:27:52.179
what you're suffering with or that I simply know

00:27:52.179 --> 00:27:55.059
that you will suffer as a human being,

00:27:55.059 --> 00:27:59.899
the truth is here that Paul says, I wanna encourage you

00:27:59.899 --> 00:28:02.739
because you're going to be a partaker of suffering,

00:28:02.739 --> 00:28:05.600
but I want you to know that you shall also,

00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:10.000
shall you be also of the consolation.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.440
You know, without the end of verse number seven,

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:14.799
it would leave us with no hope.

00:28:17.359 --> 00:28:18.799
Without the end of verse number seven,

00:28:18.799 --> 00:28:20.119
it would leave us with no hope.

00:28:20.119 --> 00:28:21.959
For God to just simply say to us,

00:28:21.959 --> 00:28:23.320
hey, you're gonna suffer.

00:28:26.559 --> 00:28:28.320
But he says, I'm gonna comfort you

00:28:29.559 --> 00:28:32.540
because with suffering comes comfort.

00:28:33.599 --> 00:28:35.320
And oh, how that ought to cause us

00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:37.440
as the people of God to rejoice.

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:39.940
You say, but I don't like suffering, neither do I.

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:43.140
I don't think any of us do,

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:46.960
but we get to experience the comfort of God.

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:50.679
Sometimes I wonder as I go through life

00:28:50.679 --> 00:28:52.159
and I know that others do as well

00:28:52.159 --> 00:28:54.839
because people have shared it with me over the years

00:28:54.839 --> 00:28:57.559
and they look at various circumstances of life

00:28:57.559 --> 00:28:59.119
and they say, I just don't know how somebody

00:28:59.119 --> 00:29:01.119
without God handles this.

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:03.339
Have you ever seen that in life?

00:29:03.339 --> 00:29:05.099
You ever experienced that?

00:29:05.099 --> 00:29:06.219
So man, what do they do?

00:29:06.219 --> 00:29:07.380
Where do they turn?

00:29:10.099 --> 00:29:11.700
At one point in our nation's history,

00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:13.539
I remember as even as a kid,

00:29:13.539 --> 00:29:15.260
before I went to church,

00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:16.979
before I got saved, all of that stuff,

00:29:16.979 --> 00:29:19.339
that there were times in which people would say,

00:29:19.339 --> 00:29:20.900
hey, we're gonna pray for you.

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:24.500
Now people say, I'm thinking about you.

00:29:26.679 --> 00:29:27.820
Hey, I'll think about you.

00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:29.099
What does that mean?

00:29:32.099 --> 00:29:36.520
As the people of God, we know the God of all comfort.

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:42.219
And listen, the just and the unjust suffer in this world.

00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:45.900
But when the just suffer,

00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:50.020
we experience the comfort of God.

00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:51.339
And he comes alongside of us

00:29:51.339 --> 00:29:53.099
and we can understand that he has a purpose

00:29:53.099 --> 00:29:57.140
and he has a plan and that his way is perfect.

00:29:58.059 --> 00:29:59.820
I want you to notice over very quickly,

00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:01.119
he holds your place here.

00:30:01.119 --> 00:30:03.479
but go to First Thessalonians chapter three.

00:30:05.439 --> 00:30:06.959
In First Thessalonians chapter three,

00:30:06.959 --> 00:30:09.559
I want you to notice what Paul is saying

00:30:09.559 --> 00:30:12.879
to these believers in Thessalonica.

00:30:15.199 --> 00:30:17.919
I wanna read the first five verses of chapter three.

00:30:17.919 --> 00:30:19.439
I was gonna just grab one verse,

00:30:19.439 --> 00:30:21.899
but I want you to see the entirety of the context

00:30:21.899 --> 00:30:24.619
and understand that Paul had a brief time

00:30:24.619 --> 00:30:27.919
to be in Thessalonica to see this church planted.

00:30:27.919 --> 00:30:30.839
He ends the second chapter by speaking about his desire

00:30:30.839 --> 00:30:32.639
to have come and to be there,

00:30:32.639 --> 00:30:35.959
but that he had been hindered by the enemy, by Satan.

00:30:35.959 --> 00:30:38.119
And so we find in chapter three in verse number one,

00:30:38.119 --> 00:30:38.959
the Bible says,

00:30:38.959 --> 00:30:41.919
wherefore, when we could no longer forbear,

00:30:41.919 --> 00:30:45.759
we thought it good to be left at Athens alone

00:30:45.759 --> 00:30:49.639
and sent Timotheus our brother and minister of God

00:30:49.639 --> 00:30:51.719
and our fellow labor in the gospel of Christ

00:30:51.719 --> 00:30:55.539
to establish you and to comfort you concerning your faith.

00:30:55.539 --> 00:30:57.679
Now notice how God was going to use,

00:30:57.679 --> 00:31:00.799
and we'll see this in the book of 2 Corinthians as well,

00:31:01.299 --> 00:31:04.519
that at times God uses people to give that comfort,

00:31:04.519 --> 00:31:05.459
to come alongside.

00:31:05.459 --> 00:31:06.439
Notice he says,

00:31:06.439 --> 00:31:09.559
to establish you and to comfort you concerning your faith.

00:31:09.559 --> 00:31:10.399
But what do you do?

00:31:10.399 --> 00:31:12.079
He sent Timotheus.

00:31:12.079 --> 00:31:14.619
Timothy was gonna go and come alongside them

00:31:14.619 --> 00:31:18.239
and provide that instruction, but also that comfort.

00:31:18.239 --> 00:31:20.479
And Paul says he could no longer forbear.

00:31:20.479 --> 00:31:21.319
In verse number one,

00:31:21.319 --> 00:31:24.319
he was concerned about these believers in Thessalonica.

00:31:24.319 --> 00:31:25.319
What was his concern?

00:31:25.319 --> 00:31:26.359
Notice in verse number three,

00:31:26.359 --> 00:31:29.239
that no man should be moved by what?

00:31:29.239 --> 00:31:30.899
These afflictions.

00:31:32.099 --> 00:31:33.519
They were suffering.

00:31:33.519 --> 00:31:36.479
For yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto.

00:31:36.479 --> 00:31:38.839
Did you notice that in the end of verse number three?

00:31:38.839 --> 00:31:41.999
He says, for yourselves know

00:31:41.999 --> 00:31:43.799
that we are appointed thereunto.

00:31:43.799 --> 00:31:44.639
Unto what?

00:31:44.639 --> 00:31:45.959
To afflictions.

00:31:46.799 --> 00:31:47.839
He says in verse number four,

00:31:47.839 --> 00:31:51.279
for verily, when we were with you,

00:31:51.279 --> 00:31:56.279
we told you before that we should suffer tribulation.

00:31:56.999 --> 00:32:00.819
Even as it came to pass, and ye know.

00:32:00.819 --> 00:32:03.239
For this cause, when I could no longer forbear,

00:32:03.239 --> 00:32:05.439
he mentioned that again from verse number one,

00:32:05.439 --> 00:32:07.799
I sent to know your faith.

00:32:07.799 --> 00:32:10.299
Lest by some means the tempter have tempted you

00:32:10.299 --> 00:32:13.879
in our labor, be in vain.

00:32:13.879 --> 00:32:15.779
I don't have time to read the entirety of the chapter,

00:32:15.779 --> 00:32:18.739
but Paul receives a good report from Timothy.

00:32:18.739 --> 00:32:20.000
The believers in Thessalonica,

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.919
they were going forward.

00:32:21.919 --> 00:32:24.000
They had experienced the comfort of God.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.179
Yes, they'd been suffering.

00:32:25.179 --> 00:32:26.860
Yes, they'd had the affliction.

00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:28.000
Yes, they had dealt with this.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.659
But I want you to understand from this passage of scripture

00:32:30.659 --> 00:32:31.940
that guess what Paul did?

00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:35.019
Paul had let them know, he tells them in verse number four,

00:32:35.019 --> 00:32:36.739
that while I was with you, by the way,

00:32:36.739 --> 00:32:38.619
he was only there for a short time.

00:32:38.619 --> 00:32:41.039
But one of the things that he taught the believers

00:32:41.039 --> 00:32:45.159
in Thessalonica was that we should suffer tribulation.

00:32:47.139 --> 00:32:50.779
We read it in 2 Timothy as we studied that book last year.

00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:54.080
All those that live godly in Christ Jesus

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:56.099
shall suffer persecution.

00:32:58.039 --> 00:33:01.599
I hope this morning that as we know these truths

00:33:01.599 --> 00:33:03.599
that we're being encouraged,

00:33:03.599 --> 00:33:05.559
you say, I'm not encouraged to suffer.

00:33:05.559 --> 00:33:10.360
Yeah, but it's the comfort part that should encourage us.

00:33:11.799 --> 00:33:14.279
Because if the comfort part is left out,

00:33:14.279 --> 00:33:15.799
there is no encouragement.

00:33:16.839 --> 00:33:20.379
If the verse simply tells us that you're gonna suffer,

00:33:20.379 --> 00:33:22.519
you're gonna have trouble, you're gonna have distress,

00:33:22.519 --> 00:33:25.279
but there's no hope of God coming alongside

00:33:25.279 --> 00:33:27.440
and giving us that comfort,

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:31.919
we just leave here miserable.

00:33:33.319 --> 00:33:37.919
But we're encouraged because God is the God of all comfort.

00:33:39.519 --> 00:33:43.059
We see the experience, we see the encouragement from Paul.

00:33:43.059 --> 00:33:45.199
I want you to understand number three

00:33:45.199 --> 00:33:46.879
as we close quickly this morning,

00:33:46.879 --> 00:33:49.279
the expectation for every believer.

00:33:50.399 --> 00:33:51.839
What should I expect?

00:33:53.279 --> 00:33:55.759
As we begin to look at this passage of Scripture

00:33:55.759 --> 00:33:59.159
and begin to think about my expectation, your expectation,

00:33:59.159 --> 00:34:02.519
as we begin to even try to take the principles

00:34:02.519 --> 00:34:05.119
of this passage of Scripture and apply it in our lives

00:34:05.119 --> 00:34:07.000
and say, practically speaking,

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.259
what does this look like in my life?

00:34:10.639 --> 00:34:12.659
We know from our text of Scripture

00:34:12.659 --> 00:34:14.080
that it's absolutely imperative

00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:15.619
that we put our trust in the Lord.

00:34:15.619 --> 00:34:17.440
Notice in verse number eight, he says,

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:19.839
for we would not, brethren, have you ignorant

00:34:19.839 --> 00:34:22.079
of our trouble, which came to us in Asia

00:34:22.639 --> 00:34:23.479
that we were pressed out of measure,

00:34:23.479 --> 00:34:26.119
above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life,

00:34:26.119 --> 00:34:28.519
but we had the sentence of death in ourselves.

00:34:28.519 --> 00:34:31.799
Notice this, that we should not trust in ourselves,

00:34:31.799 --> 00:34:36.440
but in God, which raiseth the dead.

00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:38.440
You know what I find here in this verse of Scripture

00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:39.279
in verse number nine?

00:34:39.279 --> 00:34:41.720
I find transparency.

00:34:44.279 --> 00:34:46.919
Because the right answer is trust in the Lord

00:34:46.919 --> 00:34:48.880
with all thine heart and lean not

00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:49.839
into thine own understanding.

00:34:49.839 --> 00:34:51.320
Is that not the right answer?

00:34:52.199 --> 00:34:54.199
But you know what the reality is?

00:34:54.199 --> 00:34:55.720
We trust in ourselves.

00:34:57.799 --> 00:35:01.399
We trust in ourselves until something comes

00:35:01.399 --> 00:35:05.720
that's so big and so overwhelming

00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:07.600
that we can't trust in ourselves.

00:35:11.119 --> 00:35:14.799
Paul says, we had the sentence of death in ourselves

00:35:14.799 --> 00:35:19.199
that we should not trust in ourselves,

00:35:19.199 --> 00:35:24.199
but in God, which raiseth the dead.

00:35:24.959 --> 00:35:26.440
You know, there are times in which God

00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:29.160
will allow circumstances in your life and my life

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:34.199
that are so big that we absolutely

00:35:34.199 --> 00:35:35.679
just can't trust ourselves.

00:35:37.239 --> 00:35:38.160
You know why?

00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:39.479
He wants us to trust him.

00:35:41.639 --> 00:35:43.119
What are we dealing with on Wednesday night?

00:35:43.119 --> 00:35:46.720
In the Lord put I my trust.

00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:50.519
I said this, that little word put,

00:35:52.119 --> 00:35:54.079
it eliminates all passivity.

00:35:56.359 --> 00:35:57.199
Why?

00:35:57.199 --> 00:35:59.639
Because it's a deliberate decision.

00:35:59.639 --> 00:36:01.600
If I put something somewhere,

00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:05.959
I actively, purposefully do it.

00:36:05.959 --> 00:36:08.720
I put this here.

00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:10.839
It didn't just end up there.

00:36:10.839 --> 00:36:15.479
I put my Bible on the Lord's supper table, right?

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:18.279
That was not passive.

00:36:18.279 --> 00:36:19.199
That was deliberate.

00:36:19.199 --> 00:36:20.040
Would you agree?

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:25.959
So the psalmist says in the Lord put I my trust.

00:36:25.959 --> 00:36:28.479
God wants us to trust him.

00:36:28.479 --> 00:36:29.839
Trust and obey.

00:36:31.239 --> 00:36:33.119
We sing the song.

00:36:33.119 --> 00:36:34.679
God wants us to trust him.

00:36:36.119 --> 00:36:40.160
But so often, we trust ourselves.

00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:45.160
For the day by day things.

00:36:48.679 --> 00:36:51.639
See, we know that we can't trust ourselves for eternity.

00:36:52.919 --> 00:36:53.880
Well, we know that.

00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:58.320
So we trust him for eternity.

00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:01.239
But for tomorrow, I'm gonna go ahead

00:37:01.239 --> 00:37:03.440
and try to take care of that one by myself.

00:37:04.519 --> 00:37:06.760
I'm just telling you how it works practically

00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:11.000
and how we need to grow.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.399
And listen, God will bring things in your life

00:37:13.399 --> 00:37:17.760
and in my life where we can't trust ourselves.

00:37:19.639 --> 00:37:21.440
And by the way, that's a good thing.

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:24.359
See, but I don't want that hard thing.

00:37:24.359 --> 00:37:26.679
I understand, but it's a good thing to learn.

00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:29.919
It's a good thing to learn.

00:37:29.919 --> 00:37:32.399
When you come out on the other side of that storm,

00:37:32.399 --> 00:37:36.639
on that difficulty, you've learned what a blessing it is

00:37:37.479 --> 00:37:40.600
to trust the Lord and what he's able to do.

00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:43.199
Listen, he is able to do so much greater

00:37:43.199 --> 00:37:45.279
than you or I could ever do.

00:37:46.519 --> 00:37:51.440
And we find that Paul says that this thing was so,

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:56.160
so pressing and we despaired even of life

00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:59.760
that we understand the importance of trusting the Lord.

00:38:00.959 --> 00:38:04.199
Now notice what he says as we consider this expectation

00:38:04.239 --> 00:38:05.239
that we'd have.

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:08.079
In verse number 10, he says,

00:38:08.079 --> 00:38:12.440
who delivered us from so great a death?

00:38:13.639 --> 00:38:16.279
Now, as we look at that phrase in verse number 10,

00:38:16.279 --> 00:38:18.919
to begin this verse, we find that he's speaking

00:38:18.919 --> 00:38:20.600
about a past experience.

00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:25.600
Who delivered us from so great a death?

00:38:25.679 --> 00:38:30.320
I hope this morning that you have some past experiences

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:33.640
of how God has worked and what God has done

00:38:33.719 --> 00:38:36.640
and that you can reference those things in your life.

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:39.039
But he goes from past to present.

00:38:39.039 --> 00:38:42.159
He says, who delivered us from so great a death

00:38:42.159 --> 00:38:45.320
and doth deliver?

00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:46.599
God is still delivering.

00:38:46.599 --> 00:38:48.239
God is still working.

00:38:48.239 --> 00:38:49.719
He had this issue.

00:38:49.719 --> 00:38:52.520
He continues, remember, he said in verse number five

00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:55.479
that the sufferings of Christ abound in us.

00:38:56.839 --> 00:38:59.719
And Paul says, he delivered,

00:38:59.719 --> 00:39:03.080
but he's also, he doth and doth deliver.

00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:06.000
But then he goes into the expectation

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:07.359
dealing with the future.

00:39:07.359 --> 00:39:12.359
He says, in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us.

00:39:16.839 --> 00:39:19.279
You know, it's interesting to see how God works.

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:23.679
And oftentimes, the testimony is the result of the test

00:39:23.679 --> 00:39:25.400
or the trial, is it not true?

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:28.919
When we begin to read about various aspects

00:39:28.919 --> 00:39:32.200
of great miracles of God and great records

00:39:32.239 --> 00:39:35.039
that God has given us, these accounts in his word

00:39:35.039 --> 00:39:37.039
that cause us to rejoice so greatly.

00:39:37.039 --> 00:39:39.960
Listen, you would know nothing about Shadrach, Meshach

00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:42.559
and Abednego if there was not a fiery furnace.

00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:50.000
But there was a fiery furnace.

00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:53.960
And most every child that has grown up

00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:57.599
in a church like ours has heard

00:39:57.599 --> 00:40:01.159
and probably heard many times the account.

00:40:01.159 --> 00:40:08.479
of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. Why? Because there was a fiery furnace. There's a great

00:40:08.479 --> 00:40:17.199
testimony. There's great praise. That's the result of a test or a trial. How many times

00:40:17.199 --> 00:40:21.639
our young people have heard, how many times if you've taught in Sunday school or in junior

00:40:21.639 --> 00:40:28.759
church or in some vacation Bible school, you teach about Daniel praying and Daniel being

00:40:28.759 --> 00:40:35.159
cast into the den of lions? Again, if there's no den of lions, there's no need to know about

00:40:35.159 --> 00:40:45.479
Daniel praying. But we read these wonderful accounts because our God delivers. And we

00:40:45.479 --> 00:40:51.439
find that Paul says, this is my expectation. My expectation is that he has delivered. He

00:40:51.439 --> 00:40:57.559
is delivering and he's going to continue to deliver. His expectation and your expectation

00:40:57.559 --> 00:41:05.559
and my expectation should be that God has comforted. He is comforting and he will comfort.

00:41:05.559 --> 00:41:12.079
That God is the same yesterday, today and forever. That God will not leave us nor forsake

00:41:12.079 --> 00:41:16.039
us. That God knows what we're dealing with. He knows what we're facing and he's going

00:41:16.039 --> 00:41:20.719
to come alongside us and he's going to provide for us the encouragement and the strength

00:41:20.719 --> 00:41:29.959
that we need. And this is the expectation that he has. We find that in verse number

00:41:29.959 --> 00:41:35.399
three, we're really, we dealt with verse one and two as introductory, you know, salutation

00:41:35.399 --> 00:41:41.839
type discussion. But in verses three through 11, really the text this morning, it's amazing

00:41:41.839 --> 00:41:47.419
to me if I look at this text and think about book ends, if you will. In verse number three,

00:41:47.419 --> 00:41:52.779
it's the power of praise, but in verse number 11, it's the power of prayer. Notice what

00:41:52.779 --> 00:42:00.219
he says in verse number 11, ye also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift

00:42:00.219 --> 00:42:07.259
bestowed upon us by the means of many persons, thanks may be given by many on our behalf.

00:42:07.259 --> 00:42:14.399
We find that Paul understood that praise changes things and the power of praise in verse number

00:42:14.399 --> 00:42:19.639
three as he begins, blessed be God, but he also understands the power of prayer and

00:42:19.639 --> 00:42:26.239
how prayer changes things by saying ye also helping together by prayer for us. Let me

00:42:26.239 --> 00:42:35.039
ask you this, why do we pray? Why do we pray? Simply because we've been told to? Or do we

00:42:35.039 --> 00:42:41.959
pray because we expect that God hears and we expect that God will answer? That's why

00:42:41.959 --> 00:42:52.079
I pray. Listen, prayer is not a religious exercise. It's not rote religion. It's not

00:42:52.079 --> 00:42:57.999
now I lay me down to sleep. No, no, no. I'm talking to the God of the universe. I'm talking

00:42:57.999 --> 00:43:02.239
to my father. I'm talking to the creator. I'm talking to the one that said, let there

00:43:02.239 --> 00:43:07.239
be light and there was light. I'm talking to the one that said, call unto me and I will

00:43:07.239 --> 00:43:12.799
answer thee and show thee great and mighty things, which now know us not. And we find

00:43:12.799 --> 00:43:18.279
that we're living in this time that we see the expectation that has been given to us.

00:43:18.279 --> 00:43:24.439
And Paul says, I'm praying and I'm asking for you that ye also helping together by prayer

00:43:24.439 --> 00:43:33.599
for us. Why? Because God answers prayer and that's the expectation.

00:43:33.599 --> 00:43:43.079
This morning, God is no respecter of persons. He's no respecter of persons. His grace is

00:43:43.079 --> 00:43:49.799
sufficient for me. But can I tell you this morning that his grace is sufficient for you?

00:43:49.799 --> 00:43:58.479
Can I tell you this morning that God will comfort me in my suffering? God will comfort

00:43:58.479 --> 00:44:03.239
me. He'll come alongside me as he did with Paul and as he would for these believers in

00:44:03.239 --> 00:44:09.399
Corinth and he'll come alongside me and he'll encourage me and he'll strengthen me. But

00:44:09.399 --> 00:44:13.919
can I tell you this morning, he will for you as well. You say, pastor, I'm just dealing

00:44:13.919 --> 00:44:21.779
with some things. I'm just suffering. I understand. Our God is the God of all comfort and with

00:44:21.779 --> 00:44:30.699
suffering comes comfort. And this is the expectation that these believers in Corinth

00:44:30.699 --> 00:44:36.699
should have after they receive the encouragement from Paul. Remember, he didn't share his experience

00:44:36.699 --> 00:44:43.619
for sympathy. He shared his experience in order to encourage them. Listen, this morning,

00:44:43.619 --> 00:44:49.979
when you have experienced the comfort of God, when you have experienced the grace of God,

00:44:49.979 --> 00:44:56.659
you know what you want someone else that's suffering to experience? The same thing. Because

00:44:56.659 --> 00:45:03.459
you know that there's nothing you can do for them but there's everything that God can do

00:45:03.459 --> 00:45:12.939
for them because he is the God of all comfort. This morning, with suffering comes comfort.

00:45:12.939 --> 00:45:18.419
I don't like suffering just like the next person but I'm so thankful that our God is

00:45:18.419 --> 00:45:24.179
the God of all comfort. Let's pray. Father, we love you. How we thank you for loving us.

00:45:24.179 --> 00:45:31.419
We thank you, God, for your word. We thank you that your word is given to us for practical

00:45:31.419 --> 00:45:38.899
Christian living. And God, there's not one person under the sound of my voice today that

00:45:38.899 --> 00:45:47.179
will live life apart from suffering. We may at this moment, at this hour, we may not be

00:45:47.179 --> 00:45:53.939
in the midst of a storm, in the midst of a trial, in the midst of trouble, but God,

00:45:53.939 --> 00:46:07.419
we know that suffering will come. But how we rejoice in knowing that the comfort of

00:46:07.419 --> 00:46:17.859
God will abound as well. I pray this morning that you would help us, Lord. Come alongside

00:46:17.859 --> 00:46:24.299
us. Thank you that you promise you'd never leave us nor forsake us. When things get tough,

00:46:24.299 --> 00:46:33.579
when things get hard, friends may forsake us. But God, you'll be right there with us.

00:46:33.579 --> 00:46:40.939
God, I pray this morning you'd help us to thank you and to rejoice in knowing these

00:46:40.939 --> 00:46:49.459
wonderful Bible truths, but to understand that you've given them to us to be lived out

00:46:49.459 --> 00:46:55.059
practically. Would you move and work in the time of invitation? Would you have your will

00:46:55.059 --> 00:47:00.939
and way? If there's one here that's not sure of heaven, God, I pray that today be the day

00:47:00.939 --> 00:47:06.659
of their salvation. For every child of God, would you help us, Lord, to be responsive

00:47:06.659 --> 00:47:10.819
and we'll thank you for it. In Christ's name we pray. Would you stand with me? Heads

00:47:10.819 --> 00:47:16.099
are bowed, eyes are closed. Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano and as she does,

00:47:16.099 --> 00:47:20.199
the altar is open. If you're not sure of heaven this morning, we'd love to take a Bible and

00:47:20.199 --> 00:47:24.739
show you how you can know for sure that heaven is your home. You come down and meet us down

00:47:24.739 --> 00:47:27.619
here, we'll take a Bible and show you how you can know for sure that heaven is your

00:47:27.619 --> 00:47:31.579
home. Maybe this morning you just need to come and thank God for who He is, that He

00:47:31.579 --> 00:47:35.939
is the God of all comfort, that He is the Father of mercies. Maybe you're suffering

00:47:35.939 --> 00:47:44.539
and say, God, I thank you that you provide the comfort that I need. As Kimberly plays,

00:47:44.539 --> 00:47:45.539
the altar is open.
