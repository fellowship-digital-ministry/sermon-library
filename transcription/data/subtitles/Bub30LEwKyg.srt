1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
Kings chapter number six, we'll be looking at verses 24 through 33, and this is lesson

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,439
number 28, as we've been studying through the life of Elijah and now Elisha.

3
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:15,119
And if you're taking notes this evening, the title for the message is The Syrians Besieged

4
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:17,280
Samaria.

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,879
The Syrians Besieged Samaria.

6
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:26,719
In our text of scripture, we'll look at this, what has happened and the conflict between

7
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:28,600
the Syrians and the nation of Israel.

8
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:33,799
You'll remember from our previous section of the book of 2 Kings chapter number six

9
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:38,279
last Wednesday evening as we studied this portion of scripture, we made note as to the

10
00:00:38,279 --> 00:00:46,159
fact that Elisha prayed and the host of the Syrians that were sent to apprehend him, remember

11
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:49,680
they were smitten with blindness from the Lord.

12
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,759
And you'll recall with me that Elisha was telling the secrets of Ben-Hadad when he was

13
00:00:54,759 --> 00:01:00,279
working with his generals, if you will, and they were devising their strategic plans

14
00:01:00,279 --> 00:01:06,760
for warfare that Elisha was letting King Jehoram, the King of Israel, know the plans.

15
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:13,680
And Ben-Hadad was sure that there was a traitor in their midst and he was told, no, no traitor.

16
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:20,040
It's the prophet of God, Elisha, he's telling the secrets of those things which you speak

17
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,019
even in your bedchamber, can you imagine?

18
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:29,180
We know that as we studied the passage of scripture that Ben-Hadad sends a host of Syrians

19
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:34,699
there to Dothan, that's where Elisha was, and remember the servant of the Lord went

20
00:01:34,699 --> 00:01:39,139
out early in the morning and he saw the great host that had compassed the city and he was

21
00:01:39,139 --> 00:01:45,620
concerned, he said, alas, my master, and we find that he said, how shall we do?

22
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:49,220
And Elisha said, don't worry, there's more for us than there are with them, isn't that

23
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,620
exciting?

24
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:55,779
And he prayed that God would open the eyes of that servant and God opened his eyes and

25
00:01:55,779 --> 00:02:00,300
he saw the great host, the angelic host, the powers of God.

26
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:06,099
As I mentioned last week, what a great truth that is to understand the spiritual battle

27
00:02:06,099 --> 00:02:11,139
that we're engaged in and oh, how even still today we're engaged in spiritual warfare.

28
00:02:11,139 --> 00:02:15,220
I am thankful, the Bible says, of God before us, who can be against us?

29
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:21,500
We are more than conquerors through Christ, but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory

30
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,779
through the Lord Jesus Christ and we can rejoice in that.

31
00:02:24,779 --> 00:02:31,220
He then prayed that God would cause these soldiers to be blinded and God answered that

32
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:36,179
prayer and we find that he, Elisha, led them to Samaria and then prayed that their eyes

33
00:02:36,179 --> 00:02:41,580
would be opened and sure enough, their eyes were opened, they were taken good care of.

34
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,059
Remember Jehoram said, should we kill them?

35
00:02:43,059 --> 00:02:47,660
And Elisha says, no, treat them nice and feed them and send them back and they returned

36
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,899
to Ben-Hadad and what a story they had to tell.

37
00:02:50,899 --> 00:02:56,580
Their whole purpose of going to Dothan was to take Elisha and to bring him back to Ben-Hadad

38
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:03,300
and yet the very person that they were supposed to take captive led them in blindness to Samaria

39
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:10,820
and then back to, of course, Syria to their captain, to their general, if you will, and

40
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:17,860
we find now that we come to the text of scripture that is before us tonight and as time passed,

41
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:23,419
Ben-Hadad, the king of Syria, would gather his army and besiege Samaria.

42
00:03:23,419 --> 00:03:28,100
Notice in verse number 24 it says, and it came to pass after this.

43
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:32,660
Now we do not know the amount of time that passes between verse number 23 and verse number

44
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,820
24.

45
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:37,419
We read in verse number 23 at the end of the verse that it says, so the bands of Syria

46
00:03:37,419 --> 00:03:39,779
came no more into the land of Israel.

47
00:03:39,779 --> 00:03:46,259
It would seem as if you would study the history of Israel and the conflicts between the nation

48
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:47,940
of Israel and the Syrians.

49
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:53,179
They would send bands of men in and it was just a constant conflict and for a period

50
00:03:53,179 --> 00:03:57,940
of time that ceased and we find that there was a period of time that lapsed that came

51
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:02,419
to pass after this that Ben-Hadad, king of Syria, notice what the Bible says in verse

52
00:04:02,419 --> 00:04:08,199
number 24, gathered all his host and went up and besieged Samaria.

53
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:13,160
As we're taking notes this evening, the title for the message again is The Syrians Besieged

54
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:18,559
Samaria and number one if you're taking notes, notice the record of the siege.

55
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:23,320
God provides us a record of what is happening and as we see this, of course it was a military

56
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,859
strategy that was often employed.

57
00:04:24,859 --> 00:04:30,359
You can read throughout history of various military campaigns where an army would come

58
00:04:30,359 --> 00:04:35,200
to a city and they would lay siege against the city and they would cut out anything from

59
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,959
coming in or going out.

60
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:41,239
Basically in essence what they were seeking to do is starve them out and there would be

61
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:47,320
a period of time that would last, no set time as to the length of the siege.

62
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,880
But we find that as we come to the text of Scripture, the Bible gives us the record of

63
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:58,079
this particular siege on this particular day, this period of time and it says that he, Ben-Hadad,

64
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:04,079
the king of Syria, notice he gathered all his host and they came and they compassed

65
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:06,239
the city, they laid siege against Samaria.

66
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:11,640
Now you'll recall with me that Samaria is the capital of Israel.

67
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:17,839
When we speak about Israel in this particular era of history for the nation of Israel we're

68
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:23,239
speaking of the ten tribes of the north, the northern kingdom as we would often refer to

69
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:24,239
it as.

70
00:05:24,239 --> 00:05:30,399
Of course Jehoram is the king of Israel at this particular time in history and we will

71
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:36,880
look in just a few moments and see the wickedness that really would just describe the period

72
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,040
of time in which we're looking at.

73
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:45,760
And we find that this host of Syria that they laid siege against Samaria, the capital city

74
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:50,279
of the northern kingdom of Israel.

75
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:54,839
The Bible says that there was a great famine in Samaria to begin verse number 25.

76
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:59,359
It would seem as we look at the passage of Scripture that the siege lasted certainly

77
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:04,799
for long enough to have a significant impact upon the city of Samaria.

78
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:09,679
In other words, we would say this from a military perspective, the Syrians were successful in

79
00:06:09,679 --> 00:06:11,480
doing what they sought to do.

80
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:15,440
The Syrians, they had laid out, look, they didn't have to go and do battle and fight

81
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,799
with them, they're just going to besiege the city.

82
00:06:17,799 --> 00:06:21,519
They're going to cut out, nothing's coming in, nothing's going out and we're just going

83
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:22,519
to starve them.

84
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:27,119
I mean that's what we're going to do and there's a great famine and they've been successful

85
00:06:27,119 --> 00:06:29,839
at accomplishing what they want to accomplish.

86
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:35,959
Eventually from a military perspective, from the mindset of the Ben-Hadad, the king of

87
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:40,079
Syria, and from that military perspective, really what they're looking for is for the

88
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:43,440
city to just go ahead and just surrender.

89
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,559
And then they can go ahead and have whatever they want to have and do whatever they want

90
00:06:46,559 --> 00:06:47,880
to do.

91
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:53,000
And we find here that this siege, what Syria did to Samaria, they were successful.

92
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,399
The record is given to us, but I want you to see really the result of the siege.

93
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:02,079
As we look in verses 25 through 29, and I should say the results of the siege, I want

94
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:03,679
you to see what the Bible tells us.

95
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:09,480
We see the record that they besieged Samaria, but look at what happens because of this.

96
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:14,799
We've not been in a position, those of us that are gathered here, where we've been in

97
00:07:14,799 --> 00:07:21,359
a city that has been besieged, where we've been in that situation, and we find that as

98
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:27,760
we begin to read in verses 25 down through verse number 29, and read the results as God

99
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:33,559
would tell us what happened, we really see the seriousness of the situation.

100
00:07:33,559 --> 00:07:42,119
I mean, this is a terrible, terrible situation, really, in certain regards, beyond human comprehension.

101
00:07:42,119 --> 00:07:48,160
Things that we probably would just not even, outside of Scripture, outside of reading it

102
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,640
and understanding that God's given us a true record, would be hard for us to comprehend,

103
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:55,480
especially as Americans, being in this country, and even with some of the things that we're

104
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:59,760
dealing with right now, with COVID-19, it pales in comparison to what we're dealing

105
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,760
with this evening.

106
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:06,320
It pales in comparison to what other nations throughout history have had to deal with.

107
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,079
We know that the record is true.

108
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:12,399
When we read the results that are captured here, this, remember, is God's Word.

109
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:14,720
God's Word is truth.

110
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,100
Every single part of it.

111
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,260
Every single detail that God gives us, it's true.

112
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,100
Thy Word is truth.

113
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:24,700
The psalmist said it's very pure, it's very true, and we find that the results are laid

114
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,700
out for us.

115
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:30,500
We mentioned already, in verse number 25, there was a great famine in Samaria.

116
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:35,580
Notice that this great famine is evidenced by a couple of things.

117
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:40,739
Number one, you see that the Bible says, and behold, they besieged it, notice, in verse

118
00:08:40,739 --> 00:08:48,140
number 25, until an ass's head was sold for fourscore pieces of silver.

119
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:54,020
Now, this donkey that is mentioned here in verse number 25, you have to understand he's

120
00:08:54,020 --> 00:09:01,179
an unclean animal, and the head of this particular animal was selling for 80 pieces of silver.

121
00:09:01,179 --> 00:09:03,179
That's pretty serious.

122
00:09:03,179 --> 00:09:09,219
As far as the inflation, if you will, of the commodities, I've never had the brains of

123
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:14,340
a donkey for my dinner, and I hope that I never have to.

124
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:17,020
But for 80 pieces of silver, again, we see the inflation.

125
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:23,940
We see, really, the results of this siege that was laid against Samaria, the effectiveness,

126
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:28,780
in a sense, of what Syria was doing to the city of Samaria.

127
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:33,719
And we find that the Bible tells us not only was this donkey's head sold for fourscore

128
00:09:33,719 --> 00:09:38,140
pieces of silver, this unclean animal, but it says at the end of verse number 25, in

129
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:45,219
the fourth part of a cab of doves dung for five pieces of silver.

130
00:09:45,219 --> 00:09:48,820
And we don't even know what that particular measurement is.

131
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:55,979
There are some that have given their ideas and really assumptions as to the size, the

132
00:09:55,979 --> 00:09:56,979
quantity.

133
00:09:56,979 --> 00:09:57,979
It's really uncertain.

134
00:09:57,979 --> 00:09:59,979
It's a very small portion, no doubt.

135
00:09:59,979 --> 00:10:05,699
But it's doves dung was being sold for five pieces of silver

136
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:10,379
So we noticed this great famine and how it's evidence for us in verse 25

137
00:10:10,899 --> 00:10:14,039
by the cost of goods the commodities the

138
00:10:14,899 --> 00:10:20,019
Inflation if you will and in how there was just nothing notice that they were helpless

139
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:25,179
And I would say hopeless in verse 26 and 27 as we look at the text of Scripture

140
00:10:25,179 --> 00:10:32,579
We see that there's a sense of helplessness and hopelessness the Bible tells us in verse number 26 and as the king of Israel

141
00:10:32,579 --> 00:10:34,019
This is Jehoram

142
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:41,779
As he was passing by upon the wall there cried a woman unto him saying help my lord

143
00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:46,979
Oh king and so you understand that they the the woman that's mentioned here

144
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:53,539
we don't have her name, but we understand that she's calling to the king to Jehoram for help and

145
00:10:54,259 --> 00:11:01,259
We find that it was a hopeless helpless situation and notice how he the king responds

146
00:11:01,299 --> 00:11:06,699
He said if the Lord do not help thee whence shall I help thee?

147
00:11:08,059 --> 00:11:14,999
She needed help the king was not capable of giving any help. He says to her in essence

148
00:11:16,219 --> 00:11:19,859
It's outside of my control. There's nothing that I can do

149
00:11:20,259 --> 00:11:25,019
It would have to be the Lord that would help now, I'm thankful that we know the Lord God Almighty

150
00:11:25,179 --> 00:11:28,339
I'm thankful even as I prayed this evening to start our service

151
00:11:28,619 --> 00:11:33,379
Psalm 121 that the Lord would help us to lift up our eyes into the hills from whence cometh our help

152
00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:37,259
Knowing that our help cometh from the Lord which made heaven and earth

153
00:11:37,299 --> 00:11:44,259
I'm thankful that Hebrews 13 that the Bible says that we might boldly say the Lord is my helper and what a joy

154
00:11:44,699 --> 00:11:49,979
To know the help that God provides and throughout the scriptures we can see so often

155
00:11:50,379 --> 00:11:54,199
How that he is a very present help in the time of trouble

156
00:11:54,199 --> 00:11:57,419
He is able and what a blessing that is

157
00:11:57,419 --> 00:12:04,819
Of course, we'd understand this particular time in Israel's history, especially in the northern kingdom under the reign of Jehoram

158
00:12:04,939 --> 00:12:10,179
there was much idolatry false worship of idols that was taking place and

159
00:12:10,819 --> 00:12:13,699
Here they're going to the king, you know, it's natural

160
00:12:14,259 --> 00:12:17,979
for people to look for help from somebody that they can see someone they

161
00:12:18,139 --> 00:12:22,299
Expect to be able to help and here the king says there's nothing I can do

162
00:12:23,259 --> 00:12:24,619
It's interesting

163
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:31,579
He said something similar if you remember in 2nd Kings chapter number 5 when the king of Syria had sent a letter

164
00:12:31,899 --> 00:12:33,899
with regard to the situation

165
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:38,739
With Naaman and his leprosy and remember the king of Syria said hey

166
00:12:38,739 --> 00:12:43,219
We're gonna send Naaman over there so you can take care of them and Jehoram's like who am I like?

167
00:12:43,219 --> 00:12:44,939
What am I gonna do about this?

168
00:12:44,939 --> 00:12:50,619
In fact, he says the king of Israel says when he received the letter in 2nd Kings chapter number 5

169
00:12:50,619 --> 00:12:52,539
He says behold I have

170
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:53,979
Excuse me verse number 7

171
00:12:53,979 --> 00:13:00,379
Am I God to kill and to make alive that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy and now in

172
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:04,059
Chapter number 6 this woman is saying to the king help us

173
00:13:04,579 --> 00:13:07,939
He says I'm not able notice what he says at the end of verse number 27

174
00:13:08,139 --> 00:13:14,139
He says out of the barn floor or out of the winepress in other words there was nothing

175
00:13:14,899 --> 00:13:15,939
the

176
00:13:15,939 --> 00:13:23,059
Syrians had laid siege against Samaria for whatever duration of time that has passed at this particular point

177
00:13:23,059 --> 00:13:27,739
And they were at the end of themselves. They had no hope they had no help

178
00:13:27,739 --> 00:13:31,659
There were no resources that were left nothing that was available to them

179
00:13:31,659 --> 00:13:37,339
And we find that as we continue to go through the text and see the results of this siege

180
00:13:37,539 --> 00:13:42,299
That we see the tragic details that are given to us in verses 28 and 29

181
00:13:43,379 --> 00:13:47,379
Behavior that really is beyond our comprehension

182
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:54,179
We know that it's true because God's Word says that it is and I'll be honest with you this evening

183
00:13:54,179 --> 00:13:57,899
this is a very sad portion of Scripture to see the level of

184
00:13:58,419 --> 00:14:00,179
just

185
00:14:00,179 --> 00:14:02,819
wickedness I would call it to see how

186
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:10,939
Just severe the situation and circumstances were the Bible says this in verse number 28 and the king said unto her what a let thee

187
00:14:10,939 --> 00:14:12,939
And she answered

188
00:14:13,299 --> 00:14:15,299
This woman said unto me

189
00:14:15,659 --> 00:14:21,459
Give thy son that we may eat him today, and we will eat my son

190
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:28,499
Tomorrow I can't even imagine saying that I can't imagine being in that mindset

191
00:14:28,499 --> 00:14:35,859
The starvation has been so severe because of the siege that's been laid against the city nothing coming in nothing going out

192
00:14:35,939 --> 00:14:42,539
and we find that there's nothing left and we've mentioned already about the the head of the the donkey and

193
00:14:42,939 --> 00:14:49,899
Those things that would give us an evidence of how bad this siege was and we find that these two women

194
00:14:49,899 --> 00:14:56,059
They made an agreement that they would kill and eat the the one son today and tomorrow

195
00:14:56,339 --> 00:15:00,899
They would kill and eat the other son cannibalism, this is horrible, this is wicked

196
00:15:01,939 --> 00:15:08,019
It shows us the seriousness the severity of the siege the seriousness of the situation

197
00:15:08,739 --> 00:15:15,099
Notice what she says she mentions the agreement that was made in verse 28 between her and this other woman in verse number 29

198
00:15:15,099 --> 00:15:19,859
Notice what she says so we boiled my son and did eat him

199
00:15:20,259 --> 00:15:26,099
And I said unto her on the next day give thy son that we may eat him and

200
00:15:26,539 --> 00:15:29,239
She hath hid her son

201
00:15:31,779 --> 00:15:37,819
My heart just is saddened when I read those verses of Scripture I can't imagine

202
00:15:38,819 --> 00:15:40,819
the the level of

203
00:15:41,179 --> 00:15:43,779
despair and just desperation these

204
00:15:44,619 --> 00:15:46,619
Inhabitants of Samaria were in

205
00:15:46,659 --> 00:15:52,819
We find that the Bible gives us not only the record of the siege the results of the siege

206
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:59,219
I want you to notice as we look at the remainder of chapter number six this evening the response of King Jehoram

207
00:15:59,819 --> 00:16:01,819
Now you notice that the king

208
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:08,859
The Bible tells us that he was passing by upon the wall in verse 26 and that's where he kind of get his interaction in

209
00:16:08,859 --> 00:16:10,859
this particular

210
00:16:10,859 --> 00:16:17,979
Situation as it's unfolding with the siege of the Syrians against the city of Samaria and he's receiving this word from this woman

211
00:16:17,979 --> 00:16:22,259
Initially she asked for help and then gives her gives her situation

212
00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:27,659
Explains it and it says in verse number 30 as we begin to see the response of King Jehoram

213
00:16:27,659 --> 00:16:33,859
the Bible says it came to pass when the king heard the words of the woman that he rent his clothes and

214
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:38,459
He passed by upon the wall and the people looked and behold. He had sackcloth

215
00:16:38,979 --> 00:16:40,139
within

216
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:41,779
upon his flesh

217
00:16:41,779 --> 00:16:45,739
We find that there was a reaction a response of despair

218
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:51,059
really, if you think about the sackcloth that is mentioned perhaps even a level of humility and

219
00:16:51,579 --> 00:16:59,259
understanding the the the seriousness of the situation and it says that he rent his clothes and he passed by upon the wall and

220
00:16:59,259 --> 00:17:00,859
the people looked

221
00:17:00,859 --> 00:17:04,939
This was something that was done publicly. This was something that the people of Samaria

222
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:08,539
The the people of Israel there would have seen King Jehoram

223
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:13,899
Responding in this manner and I believe that it reveals to us his level of desperation

224
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:18,259
With regard to the scenario the the seeds that they were dealing with

225
00:17:19,259 --> 00:17:21,259
But notice what he says

226
00:17:22,059 --> 00:17:28,219
We see how he responds in verse number 30, but I want you to notice what he says in verse number 31

227
00:17:28,419 --> 00:17:31,299
He said go excuse me

228
00:17:31,859 --> 00:17:37,019
God do so and more also to me if the head of Elisha

229
00:17:37,819 --> 00:17:45,299
The son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day. You know, he's saying in verse number 31. We're gonna kill Elisha

230
00:17:46,779 --> 00:17:54,019
Let's kill the man of God as if he's the culprit as if he's the reason for all that's taking place

231
00:17:54,699 --> 00:18:02,019
And perhaps it's a thought by which he had experienced the or at least heard of the miracles of

232
00:18:02,579 --> 00:18:09,059
Elisha the the miracles of God that God wrought through Elisha the provision and various other things and we find

233
00:18:09,259 --> 00:18:12,619
of course that he was aware of the healing of Naaman and

234
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:15,899
He saw what happened with the Syrians that came after

235
00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:23,419
Elisha and Dothan in the previous passage of Scripture and now he concludes after he hears what's taking place

236
00:18:23,419 --> 00:18:28,959
He's experiencing this great siege against the city. He's he's irrational

237
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:32,979
He determines what we're gonna do is kill Elisha

238
00:18:33,619 --> 00:18:40,579
He says God do so and more also to me if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him

239
00:18:40,859 --> 00:18:44,940
This day it's very interesting because Jehoram is the son of

240
00:18:45,739 --> 00:18:52,899
wicked Ahab and wicked Jezebel and you remember that Jezebel said in first Kings with regard to

241
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:59,380
Elijah in first Kings chapter number 18, right actually it's in chapter number 19 that she says

242
00:19:00,219 --> 00:19:06,260
After she hears word about Elisha slaying the prophets of Baal. She says this

243
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:13,500
Let the gobs do to me and more also if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by tomorrow

244
00:19:14,059 --> 00:19:15,739
about this time

245
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:22,139
That was in first Kings 19 and verse number 2 when Jezebel is speaking about killing the man of God

246
00:19:22,859 --> 00:19:26,899
Elijah now Jehoram is speaking about killing the man of God

247
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:32,099
Elisha here in 2nd Kings chapter number 6 because of this great famine

248
00:19:32,099 --> 00:19:37,559
That is the result of the the siege that the Syrians have laid against the city of Samaria

249
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:42,679
The Bible tells us in verse number 32, but Elisha sat in his house

250
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:47,239
now it's kind of interesting as I notice the text of Scripture and kind of see the

251
00:19:47,459 --> 00:19:51,039
the way in which the writer would give us some insight as to maybe the

252
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:56,039
The level of reaction of Elisha and really the calm demeanor

253
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:00,079
If you will of Elisha the man of God, this is the

254
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:05,999
he sat in his house, and the elders sat with him, and the king sent a man from before him."

255
00:20:05,999 --> 00:20:08,919
Why did the king send a man?

256
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:13,239
Because he wanted to go get Elisha to bring him back, right?

257
00:20:13,239 --> 00:20:15,119
He was going to kill him, remember?

258
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:18,159
He says that in verse number 31.

259
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:23,839
So we find that the Bible says that, see, in verse number 32, it says,

260
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:26,319
He said to the elders, Elisha says to the elders,

261
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:32,879
See ye how this son of a murderer hath sent to take away mine head.

262
00:20:32,879 --> 00:20:41,199
Isn't it interesting, isn't it just encouraging, how God allowed Elisha to know what was going on?

263
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:46,719
Elisha was the one that had been informing King Jehoram of the plans of Ben-Hadad during the battle.

264
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:49,079
This is recorded earlier in chapter number 6.

265
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:53,039
And now we find that Jehoram says, we're going to kill Elisha,

266
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:57,399
but God allows Elisha to have this knowledge of what's going on.

267
00:20:57,399 --> 00:20:58,599
And then he continues and says,

268
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:02,719
Look, when the messenger cometh, shut the door, and hold him fast at the door,

269
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:06,199
is not the sound of his master's feet behind him?

270
00:21:06,199 --> 00:21:13,039
So in other words, Elisha understands that this messenger has been sent to apprehend him for the purpose of murder.

271
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:18,399
And he says, but his master Jehoram, his feet are behind him, he's coming as well.

272
00:21:18,439 --> 00:21:19,839
In verse 33,

273
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:24,199
And while he yet talked with them, behold, the messenger came down unto him, and he said,

274
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:29,039
Behold, this evil is of the Lord. What should I wait for the Lord any longer?

275
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:33,759
And it's interesting in verse number 33, as you look at that phraseology, really the dialogue,

276
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:38,439
because we see that chapter 7 begins with Elisha responding.

277
00:21:38,439 --> 00:21:42,919
And we'll get into that next week, just very difficult to deal with all of it in one lesson.

278
00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:46,639
And we'll deal with the 7th chapter next Wednesday evening.

279
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,679
But Jehoram is speaking to Elisha and says,

280
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:55,079
Behold, this evil is of the Lord. What should I wait for the Lord any longer?

281
00:21:55,079 --> 00:22:01,999
And I believe that as you look at the context and you understand why Jehoram would say this to Elisha,

282
00:22:01,999 --> 00:22:05,879
and then Elisha would respond in chapter 7, in verse number 1, he says,

283
00:22:05,879 --> 00:22:10,439
Hear ye the word of the Lord, thus saith the Lord tomorrow about this time.

284
00:22:10,439 --> 00:22:15,239
And he's speaking of really the deliverance of God and how God was going to work miraculously.

285
00:22:15,239 --> 00:22:18,159
Again, the subject for next Wednesday evening.

286
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:25,199
But it would seem evident that Elisha had in some way counseled Jehoram

287
00:22:25,199 --> 00:22:33,559
with regard to the reason for this particular siege that they were experiencing under the hands of the Syrians

288
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:39,759
was because of the evil of the wickedness of the nation of Israel.

289
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:43,199
And he says, What should I wait for the Lord any longer?

290
00:22:43,199 --> 00:22:49,559
Perhaps Elisha had encouraged him that God would work and God would deliver,

291
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:54,119
but he's ready to surrender. He's ready to be done with this.

292
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:58,239
And we find that God, no doubt, is working.

293
00:22:58,239 --> 00:23:04,159
And it's interesting to understand as we look at the scriptures and deal with these various things that take place

294
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:08,999
and really the terrible situation in chapter number 6 at the end of the passage,

295
00:23:08,999 --> 00:23:12,479
dealing with this siege against Samaria.

296
00:23:12,479 --> 00:23:18,799
But you understand that the nation of Israel at this time, as I mentioned earlier in the message tonight,

297
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:21,759
they were really idolatrous people.

298
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:27,479
They were serving false gods, idols, and the plurality of their gods.

299
00:23:27,479 --> 00:23:32,679
And God was bringing a level of judgment against them because of their wickedness.

300
00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:39,879
And no doubt God was going to humble them and he was going to show his power.

301
00:23:39,879 --> 00:23:43,359
And he does just that in chapter number 7. He shows his power.

302
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:50,599
I'm not sure all to whom the nation of Israel, Samaria as a city, were looking to help for.

303
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:54,999
There's no record in our text of scripture that they cry out to God for help.

304
00:23:54,999 --> 00:23:58,279
There is the record that they go to the king for help.

305
00:23:58,599 --> 00:24:05,879
But even in that situation, he doesn't cry out to God, at least as not as recorded in the scriptures.

306
00:24:05,879 --> 00:24:09,559
Notice this, and we'll close with this in 2 Kings 3,

307
00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:16,199
just to remind you of the character of Jehoram and also of the wickedness

308
00:24:16,199 --> 00:24:22,439
that would describe this particular era of history in the nation of Israel.

309
00:24:22,439 --> 00:24:24,359
In 2 Kings 3, in verse number 1, the Bible says,

310
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:28,359
Now Jehoram, the son of Ahab, began to reign over Israel and Samaria

311
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:32,599
in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.

312
00:24:32,599 --> 00:24:37,639
We won't take a lot of time here, but you'll remember that Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah,

313
00:24:37,639 --> 00:24:41,559
he would be categorized basically as being a good king.

314
00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:44,359
Judah had several good kings throughout their history,

315
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:47,079
and Jehoshaphat would have been one of them.

316
00:24:47,079 --> 00:24:51,799
But yet up in the northern kingdom in Israel, Jehoram is reigning,

317
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:54,199
and the Bible tells us of him in verse number 2,

318
00:24:54,199 --> 00:24:56,839
that he wrought evil in the sight of the Lord,

319
00:24:56,839 --> 00:24:59,319
but not like his father, not like his mother,

320
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:01,959
for he put away the image of Baal that his father had made.

321
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:03,319
But notice what it says in verse 3,

322
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:07,639
Nevertheless, he cleaved unto the sons of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat,

323
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:12,119
which made Israel to sin, he departed not therefrom.

324
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:14,999
And if you go back, we don't have time to deal with it this evening,

325
00:25:14,999 --> 00:25:18,119
but if you go back to 1 Kings, maybe jot it down in your notes,

326
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:22,279
in 1 Kings chapter number 12, in verses 25 through 33,

327
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:26,439
you will find described for you in that passage of scripture,

328
00:25:26,439 --> 00:25:28,279
the sins of Jeroboam.

329
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:33,639
You will find that there at the time after Solomon's reign,

330
00:25:33,639 --> 00:25:37,479
when you have Rehoboam, king of Judah, Jeroboam, king of Israel,

331
00:25:37,479 --> 00:25:41,879
you will find how that he introduced idolatrous worship,

332
00:25:41,879 --> 00:25:45,399
false worship, all of the new feast days,

333
00:25:45,399 --> 00:25:47,959
and all of those things that they put in place,

334
00:25:47,959 --> 00:25:52,279
so that people would not return to Jerusalem, which was down in Judah,

335
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:54,919
and then perhaps not come back to him.

336
00:25:54,919 --> 00:25:57,719
And so Jeroboam introduced a bunch of those things,

337
00:25:57,719 --> 00:26:02,999
and you find that detailed in 1 Kings 12, verses 25 through 33.

338
00:26:02,999 --> 00:26:04,519
As we look at chapter number 6,

339
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:08,359
and we conclude this passage as we prepare for chapter number 7

340
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:09,639
for next Wednesday evening,

341
00:26:10,199 --> 00:26:12,759
we must understand in this passage of scripture

342
00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:14,919
that God is giving us this record,

343
00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:17,559
and it's a terrible time in Israel's history.

344
00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:20,439
A terrible time during the reign of Jehoram.

345
00:26:20,439 --> 00:26:24,519
I mean, the details, the description of what's happening

346
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:29,799
during this time in which the Syrians besieged Samaria is terrible.

347
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:32,519
It's beyond, at certain levels,

348
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:37,159
our ability to really comprehend that things would go that low

349
00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:40,919
and be that difficult and that problematic.

350
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:43,799
But we find that as we come to chapter number 7

351
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:46,999
that Elisha stands up with great power and great boldness

352
00:26:46,999 --> 00:26:49,559
and says, hear the word of the Lord.

353
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:51,799
I'm so thankful that our God is able.

354
00:26:51,799 --> 00:26:54,599
And our God works miraculously in chapter number 7.

355
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:58,199
I look forward to being able to study it with you next Wednesday evening

356
00:26:58,199 --> 00:27:01,559
and looking at what God does and how God works.

357
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:04,439
But we must understand that we need to turn to the Lord,

358
00:27:04,439 --> 00:27:06,919
that we need to keep our eyes upon him,

359
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:07,879
that he is able.

360
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:09,959
He is able.

361
00:27:09,959 --> 00:27:11,719
And what a great God that we serve.

362
00:27:11,719 --> 00:27:14,119
He is able to do exceeding abundantly above

363
00:27:14,119 --> 00:27:18,359
all that we ask or think, according to Ephesians 3 and verse number 20.

364
00:27:18,999 --> 00:27:22,279
The Syrians besieged Samaria.

365
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:27,399
And we find that the people there in northern Israel,

366
00:27:27,399 --> 00:27:29,239
they were suffering greatly.

367
00:27:29,239 --> 00:27:33,319
And God was getting ready to work miraculously in 2 Kings chapter 7.

368
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:34,199
Let's pray.

369
00:27:34,199 --> 00:27:34,999
Father, we love you.

370
00:27:34,999 --> 00:27:36,199
We thank you for loving us.

371
00:27:36,199 --> 00:27:38,199
Thank you for thy word, the truth of thy word.

372
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:40,199
We thank you for the power of your word.

373
00:27:40,199 --> 00:27:42,839
Lord, I pray that even as we would understand this

374
00:27:43,479 --> 00:27:45,559
just terrible time in Israel's history,

375
00:27:46,199 --> 00:27:49,399
Lord, that we would learn lessons from this passage

376
00:27:49,399 --> 00:27:54,359
and understanding the importance of seeking you and obeying you and doing your will.

377
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:56,999
Lord, that we'd understand that you are able.

378
00:27:56,999 --> 00:28:01,319
Lord, that we would understand the fact that you are a righteous judge

379
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:05,399
and that your judgment is seen in this passage of scripture.

380
00:28:05,399 --> 00:28:09,319
And God, we thank you for Elisha and for his boldness.

381
00:28:09,879 --> 00:28:13,559
Lord, we pray that you would help us to continue to serve you.

382
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:16,839
Lord, keep our eyes upon our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ,

383
00:28:16,839 --> 00:28:18,439
the author and finisher of our faith.

384
00:28:18,439 --> 00:28:22,679
I pray, Lord, that you'd be with our workers for Awana here in just a little while

385
00:28:23,479 --> 00:28:25,159
as they work with the young people.

386
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:27,239
I pray that you would encourage them and strengthen them.

387
00:28:27,239 --> 00:28:30,759
I pray, God, that you would help us this week to be used of thee.

388
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:32,119
And we'll thank you for all that you'll do.

389
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:34,119
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

390
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:34,599
Amen.
