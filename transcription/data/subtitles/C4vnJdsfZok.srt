1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,279
in Timothy chapter number four,

2
00:00:02,279 --> 00:00:04,880
second Timothy chapter number four.

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,800
And we have for this calendar year,

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,319
we've had as our theme continue.

5
00:00:10,319 --> 00:00:11,840
And you see these banners,

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,659
they've been up here all year.

7
00:00:13,659 --> 00:00:16,719
And we switched them out during the missions conference,

8
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:18,399
but our theme for the missions conference

9
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:19,520
was continue as well.

10
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,760
They were just slightly different banners

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,159
and the roadways were lined with flags of countries

12
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:28,319
because we need to continue to take the gospel

13
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:29,600
to all the world.

14
00:00:29,639 --> 00:00:32,119
And we've had this theme continue.

15
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:34,520
And what a blessed thought as we find

16
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,639
in first and second Timothy,

17
00:00:36,639 --> 00:00:40,360
as we've had the opportunity to study through these letters,

18
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,799
of course, books of the Bible,

19
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:46,400
as Paul is writing to his son in the faith, Timothy.

20
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,400
And what is he doing?

21
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,959
Well, he's encouraging him to continue.

22
00:00:49,959 --> 00:00:52,759
And all that's going on in Ephesus,

23
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:55,919
all that he's facing with the false teachers

24
00:00:55,919 --> 00:00:58,639
and hardships and opposition.

25
00:00:58,639 --> 00:01:03,400
And it's all summarized in one word, continue.

26
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,720
And we today have been given that same charge

27
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,500
and that same admonition that we are to continue.

28
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,220
As Paul closes this letter to Timothy,

29
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:16,940
I find that he exalts the Lord Jesus Christ

30
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:21,040
as he rehearses the goodness of God in his life.

31
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,639
I hope that each of us take time

32
00:01:23,639 --> 00:01:25,919
to regularly worship the Lord

33
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,760
and to regularly exalt the Lord

34
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,959
for all that he has done in our lives.

35
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:35,319
Indeed, he is a wonderful savior.

36
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:37,120
Of course, we understand this morning

37
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,760
that each of us have different experiences.

38
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,800
However different our experiences may be,

39
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,599
it is absolutely vital that we acknowledge

40
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:50,319
the good hand of the Lord in our lives.

41
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:54,440
I think about Nehemiah and I think about the situation,

42
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,919
he and Ezra as God would use them

43
00:01:56,919 --> 00:02:00,480
and the way that they recognize God's leadership

44
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,800
in God's hand upon them.

45
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,559
We find that the Apostle Paul,

46
00:02:04,559 --> 00:02:07,800
really verse 17 and 18 will be the real key elements

47
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,320
of our text this morning.

48
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,080
But I wanna begin reading in verse 14.

49
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,360
We ended last week in verse 13 of 2 Timothy chapter four.

50
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,000
So look in verse 14, the Bible says,

51
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,039
Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil.

52
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:23,919
The Lord reward him according to his works,

53
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:25,880
of whom be thou where also

54
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,399
for he hath greatly withstood our words.

55
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:31,500
At my first answer, no man stood with me,

56
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,360
but all men forsook me.

57
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,880
I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge.

58
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,699
As we look at verses 14 and 16,

59
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:41,720
we find that even as Paul is rehearsing

60
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,460
and giving this charge to Timothy

61
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,759
and he tells them in verse 15,

62
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:48,440
of whom that be thou where also,

63
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:53,259
that there will be times that as we live the Christian life,

64
00:02:53,259 --> 00:02:56,220
there will be times that we will be mistreated.

65
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,940
There will be times that we may even be deserted,

66
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:04,339
but we cannot allow those times of difficulty,

67
00:03:04,339 --> 00:03:07,000
no matter how intense they may be,

68
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,660
we cannot allow that to cause us to get bitter.

69
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,300
We look here in the text of scripture

70
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,339
and we find that even as Paul says at the end of verse 16,

71
00:03:16,339 --> 00:03:20,380
he says, I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge.

72
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,660
Instead of being bitter, we can forgive

73
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:27,419
and we can trust the Lord to deal with it in his way

74
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:28,820
and in his time.

75
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,179
And can I tell you this, this morning,

76
00:03:30,179 --> 00:03:33,899
God's way is always right and God's time is always right.

77
00:03:33,899 --> 00:03:37,139
And we can thank the Lord and we can rejoice this morning

78
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:39,380
in knowing that the apostle Paul,

79
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,660
though he dealt with these difficulties

80
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,779
and we know much about the opposition that he faced,

81
00:03:44,779 --> 00:03:47,539
that he could say to Timothy,

82
00:03:47,539 --> 00:03:50,940
I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge.

83
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,259
Doesn't it remind you of what the Lord Jesus Christ said

84
00:03:53,259 --> 00:03:54,699
while he was on the cross?

85
00:03:54,699 --> 00:03:58,020
Father, forgive them for they know not what they do.

86
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,860
Is that not what Jesus said?

87
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,979
We find that also we find Stephen,

88
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:05,240
the first martyr there in Acts chapter number seven,

89
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,699
as he's being stoned to death,

90
00:04:06,699 --> 00:04:09,860
he prays that it would not be laid to their charge

91
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:14,020
and we too can forgive and we must not get bitter

92
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:17,739
over the opposition and the difficulty that we face.

93
00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:19,799
We'll look at verse 17 and 18 in just a moment,

94
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:22,559
but notice in verse 19 down through verse 22,

95
00:04:22,559 --> 00:04:24,760
Paul says, salute Prisca and Aquila

96
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,799
and the household of Anesophorus.

97
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:28,399
Arastus abode at Corinth,

98
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:31,600
but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick.

99
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,839
Do thy diligence to come before winter.

100
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:38,200
Ebulus greeteth thee and Pudens and Linus and Claudia

101
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,500
and all the brethren.

102
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,920
The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit.

103
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,839
Grace be with you.

104
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:44,679
Amen.

105
00:04:44,679 --> 00:04:46,519
I think about these few verses of scripture

106
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:49,839
and often as you read throughout the letters of Paul,

107
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:53,799
you find that many times he references individuals by name.

108
00:04:53,799 --> 00:04:57,660
There are times in which he wants the recipient

109
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,119
of the letter, whether it's a church or an individual

110
00:05:00,119 --> 00:05:02,440
to acknowledge those individuals

111
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:06,040
and to send greetings, to extend greetings

112
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,380
and we find that as the apostle Paul is closing this letter

113
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:12,100
that he mentions individuals by name

114
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,880
and it reminds me this morning of the importance

115
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:19,959
of appreciating our brothers and sisters in Christ.

116
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:20,880
You know, it's a wonderful thing

117
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,839
to have brothers and sisters in Christ.

118
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:25,559
It's a wonderful thing to have a support network

119
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:29,079
that we are the family of God, that we come together,

120
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:32,179
we can bury one another's burdens, amen,

121
00:05:32,179 --> 00:05:33,720
that we can pray one for another,

122
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,519
that we can edify one another,

123
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:37,019
we can encourage one another

124
00:05:37,019 --> 00:05:39,959
and we understand that a church is made up

125
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:42,519
of a variety of individuals

126
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:46,700
and yes, we have our physical blood family relatives

127
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:51,239
but in Christ, the brothers and sisters in Christ,

128
00:05:51,239 --> 00:05:55,559
the family of God is a wonderful blessing

129
00:05:55,559 --> 00:05:59,000
and the apostle Paul is always mindful

130
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,519
of writing and mentioning individuals' names

131
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:06,679
and I wonder this morning how often we thank God

132
00:06:06,679 --> 00:06:09,839
for our brothers and sisters in Christ by name,

133
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:12,600
that we call out their name before the Lord,

134
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,100
that we pray one for another,

135
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,820
that we might even pick up that phone

136
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:20,600
and send a text or an email or a phone call

137
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,500
and let our brothers and sisters in Christ know

138
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:27,079
that we appreciate them, that we are thankful

139
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:31,079
that God has brought us together as a family.

140
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:32,220
What a blessing.

141
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,880
I know that oftentimes today

142
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,119
because of the advancements in technology

143
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,000
that there's not as many that write letters or cards

144
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,420
but what a blessing to be able to get a card

145
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,119
or a letter from someone

146
00:06:45,119 --> 00:06:47,359
and to know that they're praying for you.

147
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,399
We send as a ministry of our church

148
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:53,019
to all of our missionaries for their birthdays

149
00:06:53,019 --> 00:06:55,480
and their anniversaries and then also at Christmastime,

150
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,519
we send cards to them.

151
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:59,200
Now some of them are in restricted areas

152
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,959
where we cannot just drop it in the mail

153
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:01,880
and send it to them

154
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,720
and so we have to send it to their mission board

155
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,619
and sometimes they scan it in and send them an email copy,

156
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:09,459
sometimes they mail it in a package or whatever they do

157
00:07:09,459 --> 00:07:11,940
but regularly over and over,

158
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:16,660
I get feedback from our missionaries saying, thank you.

159
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:19,799
You have no idea how much of an encouragement it was to me

160
00:07:19,799 --> 00:07:20,679
to receive this.

161
00:07:20,679 --> 00:07:24,459
See, thanking God for our brothers and sisters in Christ.

162
00:07:24,459 --> 00:07:26,019
As we look at verse 17 and 18

163
00:07:26,019 --> 00:07:30,579
and really being the key text for our message this morning,

164
00:07:30,579 --> 00:07:32,100
I want you to take a few moments

165
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,760
and I want you to look at the testimony

166
00:07:33,799 --> 00:07:37,200
that the Apostle Paul gives in verse 17 and 18.

167
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,040
Notice the Bible says this, notwithstanding,

168
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,279
he's speaking about Alexander the coppersmith,

169
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:44,320
talking about the fact that no man stood with him

170
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,079
in verse 16, he says this, notwithstanding,

171
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:50,100
notice these words, the Lord stood with me

172
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,540
and strengthened me,

173
00:07:53,459 --> 00:07:56,399
that by me the preaching might be fully known

174
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:59,239
and that all the Gentiles might hear

175
00:07:59,239 --> 00:08:03,040
and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion

176
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:06,399
the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work

177
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:10,320
and will preserve me into his heavenly kingdom

178
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:14,799
to whom be glory forever and ever, amen.

179
00:08:14,799 --> 00:08:16,760
You see how Paul in these two verses

180
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,839
tucked between the introductory statements

181
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:22,260
that we made with regard to his hardship

182
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:25,200
and then remembering his brothers and sisters in Christ,

183
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,920
he just takes these two verses

184
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,880
and really just exalts the Lord Jesus Christ.

185
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,880
And he ends verse 18 by saying

186
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:36,440
to whom be glory forever and ever, amen.

187
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,760
If you read the book of Revelation,

188
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,599
you understand that for all of eternity

189
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,960
we'll be worshiping and praising our Lord

190
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,719
and he is worthy of it.

191
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:46,159
And what a joy that during this time

192
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:49,280
that God has given us to live on planet earth

193
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,179
that we are to exalt the Lord,

194
00:08:51,179 --> 00:08:52,840
that we are to magnify him,

195
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,919
that we're to praise and worship him

196
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:58,599
because he is worthy of our praise.

197
00:08:58,599 --> 00:09:00,280
We find this morning that as we look

198
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,320
at these couple of verses of scripture

199
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,359
within this closing section

200
00:09:04,359 --> 00:09:06,440
of 2 Timothy chapter number four,

201
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:11,380
I've simply titled the message strengthened for service.

202
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,080
Strengthened for service.

203
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,700
Last week we looked at the preceding text

204
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,880
in verse nine through 13 and we talked about Mark

205
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,719
and how the apostle Paul said of Mark,

206
00:09:22,719 --> 00:09:24,200
he's writing to Timothy and he says,

207
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,559
take Mark and bring him with thee, why?

208
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:31,280
For he is profitable to me for the ministry.

209
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,080
And we spent time last Sunday morning

210
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,239
dealing with what is the ministry,

211
00:09:35,239 --> 00:09:38,979
seeking to define the ministry in a simple statement.

212
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:40,359
It's the work of the Lord

213
00:09:40,359 --> 00:09:43,159
and what a blessing to be involved in God's work.

214
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:46,039
And then we said we must not only define

215
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:47,000
what the ministry is,

216
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,219
but then discover what our place in God's work is.

217
00:09:51,219 --> 00:09:54,039
What is discovering our place in God's ministry?

218
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:57,440
And we find that now as we look at this passage,

219
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,039
that Paul is referencing.

220
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:07,339
how he was strengthened for service, how God used him, and we look at the life of the Apostle

221
00:10:07,339 --> 00:10:12,939
Paul and so often we can look through the New Testament and we can read of the work

222
00:10:12,939 --> 00:10:18,379
that he was involved in and we can rejoice in how God used him, but he regularly gives

223
00:10:18,379 --> 00:10:22,599
God all of the honor and all of the glory, why?

224
00:10:22,599 --> 00:10:29,319
Because he recognizes that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing.

225
00:10:29,319 --> 00:10:31,559
And Paul says, I was strengthened for service.

226
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:35,919
He says right there in verse 17, and strengthened me.

227
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:41,399
As we look at this testimony of the Apostle Paul in verses 17 and 18, I want you to consider

228
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:43,359
just a few thoughts with me this morning.

229
00:10:43,359 --> 00:10:46,959
Number one, I want you to understand that Paul was saved.

230
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,279
You say, yeah, yeah, yeah, we know that.

231
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:53,559
No, no, it's important that we acknowledge this truth and we start here because we must

232
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:58,359
acknowledge this morning that everything when we talk about being strengthened for

233
00:10:58,359 --> 00:11:03,119
service that it all begins with salvation.

234
00:11:03,119 --> 00:11:07,839
The service that we're speaking about, the ministry that we're speaking about is God's

235
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:12,959
work and God, as I said last week, God uses his people.

236
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:17,519
He uses those that are saved by the grace of God, those who have been redeemed, those

237
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:22,199
who know for sure without any shadow of a doubt that heaven is their home.

238
00:11:22,199 --> 00:11:25,479
He uses them in his service.

239
00:11:25,479 --> 00:11:27,799
And so we speak about being strengthened for service.

240
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:32,639
We must begin by looking at the reality that Paul was saved.

241
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:38,879
There was a time in his life when his name was Saul, that he was not saved.

242
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,339
He was religious.

243
00:11:40,339 --> 00:11:42,519
He was zealous.

244
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:47,399
He was doing all that he thought he would be doing and should be doing.

245
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:48,759
And he was a religious man.

246
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:51,059
He was a Pharisee of the Pharisees.

247
00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:54,659
He gives his testimony of all that he was doing.

248
00:11:54,659 --> 00:11:59,139
He thought he was doing what he was supposed to be doing.

249
00:11:59,139 --> 00:12:03,899
But as he had authority in his hand and he was on the road to Damascus, a bright light

250
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:08,059
shone and it stopped him in his tracks.

251
00:12:08,059 --> 00:12:15,339
And he hears the voice of the Lord saying, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?

252
00:12:15,339 --> 00:12:19,719
And at that very moment Saul was saved by the grace of God.

253
00:12:19,719 --> 00:12:23,139
He says, who art thou, Lord?

254
00:12:23,139 --> 00:12:24,839
Who art thou, Lord?

255
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:27,079
Then he follows that question up with this one.

256
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,919
What will thou have me to do?

257
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:31,239
Wow.

258
00:12:31,239 --> 00:12:33,679
Saved and surrendered all in the same moment.

259
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:34,679
Amen.

260
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:39,079
And we find that he is saved many times, of course, in just a few chapters in the book

261
00:12:39,079 --> 00:12:40,079
of Acts.

262
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:45,279
When you look at Acts 9, that testimony, that record is given of that experience in his

263
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,279
life.

264
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:50,519
And we find that many times throughout the book of Acts, as God records the ministry

265
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:58,159
of the Apostle Paul, that he stands before many people and he shares that testimony of

266
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:01,119
when he got saved and how his life was changed.

267
00:13:01,119 --> 00:13:04,839
He would write to the church in Corinth and he would say this, therefore, if any man be

268
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:07,359
in Christ, he is a new creature.

269
00:13:07,359 --> 00:13:10,499
Old things are passed away, behold, all things are become new.

270
00:13:10,499 --> 00:13:12,919
And we find that the Apostle Paul, he was saved.

271
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:16,159
Listen, there was a day in his life that he was not saved.

272
00:13:16,239 --> 00:13:18,519
There was a day in my life that I was not saved.

273
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:22,399
There was a time in your life that you were not saved.

274
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:27,359
In fact, Ephesians chapter number 2, if you read the first several verses of that chapter,

275
00:13:27,359 --> 00:13:31,959
the Bible speaks about how we all had our conversation in time past.

276
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:33,639
In other words, what does he say?

277
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:39,719
There was every Christian can look back at some point and see when they were not saved.

278
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:43,999
I talked to a pastor friend just this past week.

279
00:13:43,999 --> 00:13:47,879
He said they had, he had a conversation with somebody and he said, so tell me about when

280
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:48,879
you got saved.

281
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:50,279
And I said, oh, we've always been saved.

282
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:53,759
He said, no, no, no, you can't always be saved.

283
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:54,759
Amen?

284
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:59,259
Because we're born sinners, we're born in need of the Savior.

285
00:13:59,259 --> 00:14:04,959
And there comes a time in our lives, there came a time in Paul's life where he acknowledged

286
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:11,799
the fact that God, who was gracious and merciful, gave him the truth of his need for the Savior.

287
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:17,639
And he understood that personally he needed to be saved.

288
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:24,079
I remember that day in my life when I recognized personally that I needed to be saved.

289
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,439
It wasn't just that someone else needed to be saved.

290
00:14:26,439 --> 00:14:30,519
It wasn't that someone, that I was better than this person or that person or not quite

291
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:31,519
as bad.

292
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:37,399
No, we're all sinners for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.

293
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:41,799
The standard is not your neighbor, your coworker, your relative.

294
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:45,039
The standard is perfection, the Lord Jesus Christ.

295
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:47,919
And we all fall short.

296
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:50,559
The Apostle Paul was saved by the grace of God.

297
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:52,279
He never got over being saved.

298
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:53,799
He wrote about it often.

299
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:58,199
But just within the context of our study this year in 1 and 2 Timothy, I want you to go

300
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:04,239
back to 1 Timothy chapter 1 and I want you to notice what the Apostle Paul says.

301
00:15:04,239 --> 00:15:09,639
The Apostle Paul is writing here and he's speaking and sharing his testimony.

302
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:14,399
And he talks, he mentions in verse number 12, notice he says in 1 Timothy 1 and verse

303
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,399
12,

304
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:19,159
And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful,

305
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:20,599
putting me into the ministry.

306
00:15:20,599 --> 00:15:26,639
Notice, who was before a blasphemer and a persecutor and injurious, but I obtained mercy

307
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,919
because I did it ignorantly and unbelief.

308
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:33,919
That's where Paul's talking about before, this is what I was, but now I receive mercy.

309
00:15:34,599 --> 00:15:35,599
I've been saved.

310
00:15:35,599 --> 00:15:36,599
Notice in verse 14,

311
00:15:36,599 --> 00:15:42,959
And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love, which is in Christ Jesus.

312
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,119
How many of you know the song Amazing Grace?

313
00:15:45,119 --> 00:15:48,599
We sing it often, Mr. Don's favorite song, Amazing Grace.

314
00:15:48,599 --> 00:15:53,959
Not only is God's grace amazing, but it's abundant and God's grace is sufficient.

315
00:15:53,959 --> 00:15:58,879
And we find here that the Apostle Paul, he mentions in verse 13 about the mercy of God.

316
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:01,659
He mentions here in verse 14 about the grace of God.

317
00:16:01,659 --> 00:16:03,699
And then notice what he says in verse 15.

318
00:16:03,699 --> 00:16:05,779
This is a faithful saying.

319
00:16:05,779 --> 00:16:07,019
This is the truth.

320
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:14,459
This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation that Christ Jesus came into the

321
00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:16,659
world for what purpose?

322
00:16:16,659 --> 00:16:22,579
To save sinners of whom I am chief.

323
00:16:22,579 --> 00:16:23,579
That's Paul's testimony.

324
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:30,859
He said, Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners of whom I am chief.

325
00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:34,939
He didn't come to just save that sinner or those sinners or whoever.

326
00:16:34,939 --> 00:16:37,419
No, he came in to save this sinner.

327
00:16:37,419 --> 00:16:38,579
Amen.

328
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:39,579
He made it personal.

329
00:16:39,579 --> 00:16:40,579
He understood.

330
00:16:40,579 --> 00:16:46,099
Notice in chapter two of First Timothy, the Bible says this in verse number four.

331
00:16:46,099 --> 00:16:47,099
Look at verse three with it.

332
00:16:47,099 --> 00:16:51,059
For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God, our Savior, who will have all men

333
00:16:51,059 --> 00:16:53,899
to be saved and to come into the knowledge of the truth.

334
00:16:53,899 --> 00:16:59,699
You know, this morning, the amazing thing, the amazing truth of God's word is that God

335
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:06,499
came into the world to save sinners, but he wants all sinners to be saved.

336
00:17:06,499 --> 00:17:12,739
Paul says here very plainly, who will have all men to be saved, all humanity.

337
00:17:12,739 --> 00:17:19,939
The Lord Jesus Christ, when he hung upon that cross, he paid for the sin of the entire world.

338
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:21,679
And his payment was accepted.

339
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,819
It was appropriate.

340
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:28,619
And we find that he went to that grave and then he rose conquering sin, death in the

341
00:17:28,619 --> 00:17:29,619
grave.

342
00:17:29,619 --> 00:17:31,379
He was alive forevermore.

343
00:17:31,379 --> 00:17:35,299
And Paul, he knew that he was saved.

344
00:17:35,299 --> 00:17:40,579
What a blessing it is to be saved, to know for sure that heaven is our home.

345
00:17:40,579 --> 00:17:43,899
I remember when I was not saved, I didn't get saved until I was 17 years old.

346
00:17:43,899 --> 00:17:45,299
I remember when I was not saved.

347
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:49,339
Some people got saved real young, some older than I was when they got saved.

348
00:17:49,339 --> 00:17:55,419
I'm not sure how old you were, but I hope that today, you know that you're saved.

349
00:17:55,419 --> 00:17:59,219
I remember before I got saved, I remember driving to school.

350
00:17:59,219 --> 00:18:01,159
I was a senior in high school.

351
00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:05,579
My dad was in the Marine Corps stationed out in California, Camp Pendleton.

352
00:18:05,579 --> 00:18:08,839
And I remember going to Fallbrook Union High School and we had to go through the Navy base

353
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:11,939
to get to school in Fallbrook.

354
00:18:11,939 --> 00:18:18,419
And I remember driving and it was a very windy road and hilly and lots of steep places where

355
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:19,699
you could run off the road.

356
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:24,219
And I remember thinking as I would drive that road, that if I crash this vehicle and I die,

357
00:18:24,219 --> 00:18:28,679
I'm going to go to hell because I'm not saved.

358
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:32,320
Because I knew what the Bible had taught and I was rejecting it.

359
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,320
I had not yet received it.

360
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,519
And I remember having those thoughts and oh, those were not pleasant thoughts.

361
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:41,519
They were scary thoughts.

362
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:48,079
But you know, after I trusted Christ as my Savior, I got on my knees in my living room

363
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:49,599
that day.

364
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:53,639
My dad was there by my side and I prayed and I asked the Lord to save me.

365
00:18:53,639 --> 00:18:56,179
And I was born again.

366
00:18:56,179 --> 00:19:00,859
I was saved by the grace of God, not by any works that I couldn't work my way to heaven.

367
00:19:00,859 --> 00:19:02,940
You can't work your way to heaven.

368
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,419
But he saved me by his grace and by his mercy.

369
00:19:05,419 --> 00:19:08,699
And you know, that was August 31st, 1997.

370
00:19:08,699 --> 00:19:11,380
If you know anything about the school year, that's at the very beginning of the school

371
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:12,380
year.

372
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:17,019
And so for the rest of the school year, I had to drive that same road every day to go

373
00:19:17,019 --> 00:19:18,019
to school.

374
00:19:18,019 --> 00:19:21,139
And you know, I never feared that thought once again.

375
00:19:21,139 --> 00:19:25,299
Because I knew that if I did crash that vehicle, if something happened, I was going to go to

376
00:19:25,419 --> 00:19:29,099
heaven because I was saved by the grace of God.

377
00:19:29,099 --> 00:19:30,419
What a blessing.

378
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:35,139
Now that the Apostle Paul was saved, now for us that have been saved by the grace of God,

379
00:19:35,139 --> 00:19:40,859
we ought to have a heart and a desire to tell others about their need to be saved as well.

380
00:19:40,859 --> 00:19:44,940
We're not trying to make somebody, conform somebody into our way of thinking.

381
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:47,619
Listen, we can't twist anybody's arm into being saved.

382
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:51,899
It's a personal decision that they must make.

383
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:55,459
But if we know the truth of God's word, we ought to be desirous that others would be

384
00:19:55,459 --> 00:19:56,820
saved.

385
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,579
We ought to have a burden and a heart for others to be saved.

386
00:19:59,579 --> 00:19:59,859
Why?

387
00:19:59,859 --> 00:20:02,319
because we know the truth of God's Word.

388
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:06,319
Paul said in Romans chapter 1 and verse number 15 and 16,

389
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:09,159
he speaks about being ready to preach the gospel.

390
00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:09,999
Why?

391
00:20:09,999 --> 00:20:12,419
He says he's not ashamed of the gospel in verse 16.

392
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:13,259
Why?

393
00:20:13,259 --> 00:20:15,739
Because it is the power of God unto salvation

394
00:20:15,739 --> 00:20:18,179
to everyone that believeth.

395
00:20:19,379 --> 00:20:21,939
He talks in Romans 9 and in Romans 10

396
00:20:21,939 --> 00:20:26,859
about his deep burden to see people saved.

397
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:30,339
We're not trying to make people Baptists.

398
00:20:30,339 --> 00:20:33,019
We're not trying to make somebody a member of a church.

399
00:20:33,019 --> 00:20:35,579
No, we just want people to know for sure when they die

400
00:20:35,579 --> 00:20:37,559
that they're gonna go to heaven.

401
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:38,399
Why?

402
00:20:38,399 --> 00:20:40,579
Because every one of us is gonna die.

403
00:20:40,579 --> 00:20:43,299
I don't know when and you don't know when.

404
00:20:43,299 --> 00:20:45,779
I remember talking to the man at the bank several years ago

405
00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:47,899
and I told him I was absolutely wonderful

406
00:20:47,899 --> 00:20:49,139
and he said, you're lying.

407
00:20:49,139 --> 00:20:51,019
And I thought, well, that's kind of odd.

408
00:20:51,019 --> 00:20:52,379
I know I've shared this story before.

409
00:20:52,379 --> 00:20:54,979
He was just another customer at the bank.

410
00:20:54,979 --> 00:20:57,019
And I thought, well, that's kind of interesting.

411
00:20:57,019 --> 00:20:58,059
He just called me a liar

412
00:20:58,059 --> 00:21:00,059
because I said I was doing wonderful.

413
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:02,339
And I said, well, excuse me, why do you say I'm lying?

414
00:21:02,339 --> 00:21:04,339
And he said, because no one's wonderful.

415
00:21:05,659 --> 00:21:06,979
And I thought, well, that's kind of sad

416
00:21:06,979 --> 00:21:08,779
that he's never had a wonderful day.

417
00:21:10,139 --> 00:21:11,679
He said, why would you say you're wonderful?

418
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,859
I said, because I'm gonna go to heaven when I die.

419
00:21:14,859 --> 00:21:16,019
He said, you're dying?

420
00:21:16,939 --> 00:21:19,419
I was like, well, look, I don't really like,

421
00:21:19,419 --> 00:21:20,919
not that I know of, right?

422
00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:22,819
The same pastor friend that I talked to this week,

423
00:21:22,819 --> 00:21:24,959
he said, I know I'm gonna die, but I don't know of what?

424
00:21:25,939 --> 00:21:26,759
Because I don't go to the doctor

425
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:27,599
because I don't want to know.

426
00:21:29,399 --> 00:21:30,559
All right?

427
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,679
No, no, the reality is that we all know

428
00:21:32,679 --> 00:21:33,819
that we're gonna die.

429
00:21:34,659 --> 00:21:37,679
We don't know when and we don't know from what,

430
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:38,919
but we're not gonna die.

431
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:42,199
But the reality is that we don't have,

432
00:21:42,199 --> 00:21:45,139
if we've been saved by the grace of God,

433
00:21:45,139 --> 00:21:47,079
we don't have to fear that.

434
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:48,199
Because heaven is my home.

435
00:21:48,199 --> 00:21:50,519
Paul said this, to be absent from the body

436
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:52,359
is to be present with the Lord.

437
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:54,839
So as we look at this passage,

438
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:58,719
we begin by understanding that Paul was saved.

439
00:21:58,719 --> 00:22:00,919
Number two, if you're taking notes this morning,

440
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:03,439
I want you to notice in the text in 2 Timothy 4

441
00:22:03,439 --> 00:22:04,879
that Paul was strengthened.

442
00:22:04,879 --> 00:22:08,199
He says in verse 17, he says, notwithstanding,

443
00:22:08,199 --> 00:22:09,879
though there were those that opposed me,

444
00:22:09,879 --> 00:22:11,659
though no one stood with me,

445
00:22:11,659 --> 00:22:14,119
notwithstanding, the Lord stood with me.

446
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:18,199
By the way, can I say this by just really kind of a thought?

447
00:22:18,199 --> 00:22:20,639
Listen, it's better that the Lord stand with you

448
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:22,739
and no one else than for everyone else

449
00:22:22,779 --> 00:22:26,979
to stand with you and not the Lord, amen?

450
00:22:26,979 --> 00:22:29,219
Listen, sometimes we get caught up into this thing

451
00:22:29,219 --> 00:22:32,539
that the numbers, the majority, the whatever,

452
00:22:32,539 --> 00:22:34,139
listen, the Lord stood with me.

453
00:22:34,139 --> 00:22:37,239
Remember what Moses said, who is on the Lord's side?

454
00:22:37,239 --> 00:22:40,099
We actually sing the song, who is on the Lord's side, right?

455
00:22:40,099 --> 00:22:43,519
And we find here that Paul says, notwithstanding,

456
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:48,519
the Lord stood with me, and notice, and strengthened me.

457
00:22:49,299 --> 00:22:50,859
Praise the Lord.

458
00:22:50,859 --> 00:22:52,979
Paul was saved.

459
00:22:52,979 --> 00:22:54,779
Somebody's talking back there, amen?

460
00:22:54,779 --> 00:22:56,279
Help me preach this morning.

461
00:22:57,299 --> 00:23:00,979
The Lord strengthened me, and so Paul was saved,

462
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:04,139
but Paul was also strengthened.

463
00:23:04,139 --> 00:23:06,079
He suffered much opposition,

464
00:23:07,699 --> 00:23:10,199
but he acknowledges that it was the Lord

465
00:23:10,199 --> 00:23:11,879
who strengthened him.

466
00:23:11,879 --> 00:23:15,499
Yes, I believe that God gave him physical strength,

467
00:23:15,499 --> 00:23:17,379
but more importantly than physical strength,

468
00:23:17,379 --> 00:23:20,379
you know what, God gave him spiritual strength,

469
00:23:20,379 --> 00:23:22,179
and we need that spiritual strength.

470
00:23:22,179 --> 00:23:26,979
We need to be strengthened in our spirit, in our inner man.

471
00:23:26,979 --> 00:23:28,739
We find that if you hold your place here

472
00:23:28,739 --> 00:23:32,139
and turn to the book of 2 Corinthians chapter four,

473
00:23:32,139 --> 00:23:33,739
I want you to notice a couple of thoughts

474
00:23:33,739 --> 00:23:37,259
that Paul gives here with regard to this strength

475
00:23:37,259 --> 00:23:39,159
that he received.

476
00:23:39,159 --> 00:23:40,939
In 2 Corinthians chapter number four,

477
00:23:40,939 --> 00:23:43,139
he begins in verse number one,

478
00:23:46,499 --> 00:23:49,499
2 Corinthians four and verse number one,

479
00:23:49,499 --> 00:23:53,019
therefore, seeing we have this ministry,

480
00:23:53,019 --> 00:23:57,459
notice as we have received mercy, we faint not.

481
00:23:58,339 --> 00:23:59,179
We faint not.

482
00:23:59,179 --> 00:24:00,279
We've received mercy.

483
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:02,459
He continues, and we're gonna jump through.

484
00:24:02,459 --> 00:24:03,659
Look at verse number seven.

485
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:07,619
He says, but we have this treasure in earthen vessels,

486
00:24:07,619 --> 00:24:09,899
that the excellency of the power may be of God

487
00:24:09,899 --> 00:24:11,659
and not of us.

488
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:12,659
Notice what Paul says.

489
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:16,819
We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed.

490
00:24:16,859 --> 00:24:19,099
We are perplexed, but not in despair,

491
00:24:19,099 --> 00:24:21,259
persecuted, but not forsaken,

492
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:24,419
cast down, but not destroyed,

493
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:26,259
always bearing about in the body

494
00:24:26,259 --> 00:24:28,439
the dying of the Lord Jesus,

495
00:24:28,439 --> 00:24:29,879
that the life also of Jesus

496
00:24:29,879 --> 00:24:32,339
might be made manifest in our body.

497
00:24:32,339 --> 00:24:34,779
For we which live are always delivered unto death

498
00:24:34,779 --> 00:24:37,179
for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus

499
00:24:37,179 --> 00:24:40,019
might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.

500
00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:43,299
So then death worketh in us, but life in you.

501
00:24:44,459 --> 00:24:46,219
We having the same spirit of faith,

502
00:24:46,219 --> 00:24:47,299
according as it is written,

503
00:24:47,299 --> 00:24:49,859
I believed and therefore have I spoken.

504
00:24:49,859 --> 00:24:51,539
We also believe and therefore speak,

505
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:55,739
knowing, verse 14, that he which raised up the Lord Jesus

506
00:24:55,739 --> 00:24:59,019
shall raise up us also by Jesus

507
00:24:59,019 --> 00:25:01,979
and shall present us with you.

508
00:25:01,979 --> 00:25:04,419
For all things are for your sakes,

509
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:06,099
that the abundant grace might,

510
00:25:06,099 --> 00:25:07,659
through the thanksgiving of many,

511
00:25:07,659 --> 00:25:09,899
redound to the glory of God.

512
00:25:09,899 --> 00:25:12,819
For which cause, notice he says this again, we faint not.

513
00:25:12,819 --> 00:25:14,339
He says that in verse one.

514
00:25:14,339 --> 00:25:16,419
He talks about in verses eight

515
00:25:16,419 --> 00:25:18,139
down through verse number 11,

516
00:25:18,139 --> 00:25:20,619
all of these difficulties that he faced,

517
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:24,459
but he says once again, for which cause we faint not.

518
00:25:24,459 --> 00:25:27,779
But though our outward man perish, verse 16,

519
00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:32,779
yet the inward man is renewed day by day.

520
00:25:34,619 --> 00:25:38,779
That spiritual strength that God gives his people

521
00:25:38,779 --> 00:25:40,859
for the work that he's called us to do,

522
00:25:40,859 --> 00:25:42,779
strengthened for service.

523
00:25:42,779 --> 00:25:44,899
Listen, the enemy wanted Paul to quit.

524
00:25:44,899 --> 00:25:47,059
The opposition wanted Paul to quit.

525
00:25:47,059 --> 00:25:48,939
You know what the opposition in Ephesus

526
00:25:48,939 --> 00:25:50,019
wanted for Timothy to do?

527
00:25:50,019 --> 00:25:50,859
To quit.

528
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:53,979
That's why the charges continue.

529
00:25:55,019 --> 00:25:57,939
And God will strengthen us for service.

530
00:25:57,939 --> 00:25:59,739
You ever hear somebody say, I just can't do it.

531
00:25:59,739 --> 00:26:01,419
I just can't go on.

532
00:26:01,419 --> 00:26:04,979
I can do all things through Christ, which strengtheneth me.

533
00:26:04,979 --> 00:26:06,619
You ever read that verse before?

534
00:26:06,619 --> 00:26:07,539
Amen.

535
00:26:07,539 --> 00:26:09,739
Philippians chapter four, verse 13.

536
00:26:10,779 --> 00:26:12,299
What a joy.

537
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:15,059
That verse has been put on mugs and cups

538
00:26:15,059 --> 00:26:17,659
and shirts and banners and all over the place

539
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:18,899
and people market it,

540
00:26:18,899 --> 00:26:21,299
but sometimes the believer, the Christian,

541
00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:23,659
forgets the very truth,

542
00:26:23,659 --> 00:26:25,379
that I can do all things through Christ,

543
00:26:25,379 --> 00:26:27,299
which strengtheneth me.

544
00:26:27,299 --> 00:26:31,059
Thank God for his strength and Paul was strengthened.

545
00:26:31,059 --> 00:26:32,779
The Bible says in second Corinthians,

546
00:26:32,779 --> 00:26:33,659
you're there in chapter four,

547
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:34,899
look over in chapter 12,

548
00:26:34,899 --> 00:26:36,299
just a few pages over

549
00:26:36,299 --> 00:26:38,139
and look at second Corinthians chapter 12.

550
00:26:38,139 --> 00:26:41,139
Notice what Paul says here about this truth

551
00:26:41,179 --> 00:26:42,859
of being strengthened.

552
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:48,859
In verse number eight of second Corinthians chapter 12,

553
00:26:48,859 --> 00:26:50,739
the Bible says for this thing,

554
00:26:50,739 --> 00:26:54,339
this thing is the thorn that he mentions in his flesh.

555
00:26:54,339 --> 00:26:55,179
In verse number seven,

556
00:26:55,179 --> 00:26:57,979
for this thing I besought the Lord thrice,

557
00:26:57,979 --> 00:26:59,339
that it might depart from me.

558
00:26:59,339 --> 00:27:02,099
And he, the Lord said unto me, Paul,

559
00:27:02,099 --> 00:27:05,259
my grace, God's grace is sufficient for thee.

560
00:27:05,259 --> 00:27:06,099
Notice what he said,

561
00:27:06,099 --> 00:27:10,779
for my strength is made perfect in weakness.

562
00:27:11,459 --> 00:27:13,859
Paul was strengthened by the Lord.

563
00:27:13,859 --> 00:27:16,500
He says, as he's writing here to Timothy,

564
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,379
as he's exalting the Lord,

565
00:27:18,379 --> 00:27:22,619
he's mentioning about the way in which God strengthened him.

566
00:27:22,619 --> 00:27:24,579
He said, notwithstanding again,

567
00:27:24,579 --> 00:27:26,259
in second Timothy four and verse 17,

568
00:27:26,259 --> 00:27:28,579
the Lord stood with me and strengthened me.

569
00:27:28,579 --> 00:27:30,379
Notice that by me,

570
00:27:30,379 --> 00:27:33,019
the preaching might be fully known

571
00:27:33,019 --> 00:27:36,139
and that all the Gentiles might hear.

572
00:27:36,139 --> 00:27:39,899
And I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.

573
00:27:39,899 --> 00:27:42,099
It's a very interesting reference

574
00:27:42,099 --> 00:27:43,379
at the end of verse number 17

575
00:27:43,379 --> 00:27:45,339
of being delivered out of the mouth of the lion.

576
00:27:45,339 --> 00:27:47,699
We understand that Peter would write

577
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:49,219
in first Peter chapter number five,

578
00:27:49,219 --> 00:27:53,579
that our enemy is like a roaring lion, right?

579
00:27:53,579 --> 00:27:56,379
The enemy, Satan, he's like a roaring lion.

580
00:27:56,379 --> 00:27:59,379
Therefore, Peter says, be sober, be vigilant

581
00:27:59,379 --> 00:28:02,859
because your adversary, the devil is a roaring lion,

582
00:28:02,859 --> 00:28:05,699
walketh about seeking whom he may.

583
00:28:05,699 --> 00:28:06,739
You know what that word is?

584
00:28:06,739 --> 00:28:10,299
Devour, devour.

585
00:28:10,299 --> 00:28:11,779
He doesn't just wanna trip you up.

586
00:28:11,779 --> 00:28:13,779
He doesn't wanna just discourage you a little bit.

587
00:28:13,779 --> 00:28:16,019
He wants to devour you.

588
00:28:19,299 --> 00:28:22,619
And he says, I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.

589
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:25,059
Listen, he was strengthened for service.

590
00:28:25,059 --> 00:28:27,939
We find that he was saved, but he was strengthened.

591
00:28:27,939 --> 00:28:32,339
He says that by me, the preaching might be fully known

592
00:28:32,339 --> 00:28:34,579
and that all the Gentiles might hear.

593
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:36,739
The Apostle Paul understood the call

594
00:28:36,739 --> 00:28:38,299
that God placed on his life.

595
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:41,179
And the Apostle Paul knew that there was nothing

596
00:28:41,179 --> 00:28:44,579
that he could do in of himself with his own power

597
00:28:44,579 --> 00:28:47,380
to fulfill the work that God gave him.

598
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:51,779
He needed that supernatural strength.

599
00:28:51,779 --> 00:28:52,619
You know, it's interesting.

600
00:28:52,619 --> 00:28:56,899
Moses said, these people, they're too many for me, Lord.

601
00:28:56,899 --> 00:28:59,219
Too many for me to bear.

602
00:28:59,219 --> 00:29:00,140
You know what God says?

603
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,500
I'll be with you.

604
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,539
What a joy.

605
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:06,779
Paul understood the call that God placed on his life.

606
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:09,380
He understood the ministry that he had been given.

607
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,579
And we've spoken about that many times

608
00:29:11,579 --> 00:29:12,940
over the last couple of weeks,

609
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:15,099
as he says in verse six and seven,

610
00:29:15,099 --> 00:29:16,659
even of the same chapter,

611
00:29:16,659 --> 00:29:18,179
that I am now ready to be offered

612
00:29:18,179 --> 00:29:20,299
in the time of my departure is at hand.

613
00:29:20,299 --> 00:29:21,739
I have fought a good fight.

614
00:29:21,739 --> 00:29:24,419
I have finished my course.

615
00:29:24,419 --> 00:29:25,459
I have kept the faith.

616
00:29:25,459 --> 00:29:28,099
He knew the ministry that God gave him,

617
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:30,459
but he recognized that it was also the Lord

618
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,739
that strengthened him.

619
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:37,859
God saved me and God strengthens me.

620
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:39,380
I hope that you're experiencing

621
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:42,179
the strength of God in your life.

622
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:44,260
I hope that you're recognizing this morning

623
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:47,500
that without him, truly, we can do nothing.

624
00:29:48,539 --> 00:29:50,140
Without him, I can do nothing.

625
00:29:51,099 --> 00:29:54,500
But his strength as he works within us

626
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,940
and he enables us to do his work.

627
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:59,019
What a joy.

628
00:29:59,019 --> 00:30:03,579
We find not only do we look at those references in the book of 2 Corinthians,

629
00:30:03,579 --> 00:30:07,339
but we're reminded about the wonderful truth, and we won't take time to turn there,

630
00:30:07,339 --> 00:30:12,059
but in Ephesians chapter 6, verses 10 through 17, where Paul starts this way,

631
00:30:12,059 --> 00:30:17,259
be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might.

632
00:30:18,619 --> 00:30:22,299
He goes on to talk about the fact that we wrestle not against flesh and blood,

633
00:30:22,299 --> 00:30:27,339
but against spiritual wickedness in high places, and we're engaged in a spiritual battle,

634
00:30:27,339 --> 00:30:32,699
and we need spiritual strength. We need the strength that only God can give,

635
00:30:34,059 --> 00:30:37,579
and I'm thankful this morning that God strengthens his people.

636
00:30:38,139 --> 00:30:43,019
I hope that you've experienced it in your life. I know personally I've experienced it in my life.

637
00:30:43,739 --> 00:30:49,899
I've experienced how God has strengthened me, how he's strengthened my inner man.

638
00:30:49,899 --> 00:30:55,179
He says day by day there in 2 Corinthians chapter 4. Why? Because we get into the Bible every day,

639
00:30:55,259 --> 00:31:01,899
and we get that spiritual strength that we get from feasting on the word of God. What a blessing.

640
00:31:03,179 --> 00:31:06,699
So we find that Paul was saved, that Paul was strengthened.

641
00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:09,739
Number three, I want you to notice that Paul was secure.

642
00:31:10,779 --> 00:31:15,179
He was secure. What do I mean by that? I want you to note the confidence that Paul

643
00:31:15,179 --> 00:31:22,219
mentions in verse number 18, and what a joy it is for Paul to have known and for us to know today

644
00:31:22,219 --> 00:31:28,459
that the creator of the universe is our savior, and that we are secure in him.

645
00:31:28,459 --> 00:31:33,179
Notice what Paul says. Not only does he mention about I was delivered out of the mouth of the

646
00:31:33,179 --> 00:31:39,979
lion, that's referencing at the end of verse 17 a past experience in God's provision, strength,

647
00:31:39,979 --> 00:31:46,939
God's security, God's provision for him, but now he says in verse 18, notice what he says,

648
00:31:46,939 --> 00:31:56,139
and the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and shall, notice, and will preserve me

649
00:31:56,139 --> 00:32:02,859
unto his heavenly kingdom, to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen. Do you see the confidence

650
00:32:02,859 --> 00:32:08,939
of Paul in verse 18? I mean, Paul's not writing this with a, I hope this is going to be the case.

651
00:32:08,939 --> 00:32:15,259
No, he's writing it with great confidence. He says this, he says, and the Lord shall deliver

652
00:32:15,259 --> 00:32:23,739
me from, notice, every evil work, and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom.

653
00:32:23,739 --> 00:32:30,699
You think about the security that we have in Christ. What a joy. You know, security is an

654
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:38,459
important thing for humans, to have security. I think about children having the security of their

655
00:32:38,459 --> 00:32:44,459
parents. I think about the importance, even as we understand that, and those of us that have

656
00:32:44,459 --> 00:32:50,379
children can understand the benefit, how sometimes our children, when they were little,

657
00:32:50,379 --> 00:32:55,899
maybe they were fearful, they lacked security, but your presence gave them some security.

658
00:32:58,219 --> 00:33:02,059
They were scared of the dark, maybe, and you said, it's okay, just hold my hand, I'm with you.

659
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:07,579
They were scared of some other thing, whatever it might be, and we find that as we look at that

660
00:33:07,579 --> 00:33:12,779
truth and then we think about our lives, listen, there are times in which we face uncertainties.

661
00:33:14,539 --> 00:33:21,819
But our God knows all things, and he has revealed to us in his word the fact that we are secure

662
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:29,659
in him. And we find in this passage, he says, that the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work,

663
00:33:29,659 --> 00:33:35,179
and then, notice, will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom. And you think about your life,

664
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:41,579
and you think about my life, and we can think about the bookends, if you will, from salvation.

665
00:33:42,459 --> 00:33:47,019
Whatever day it was that you got saved, and if you're not saved today, that today is the day of

666
00:33:47,019 --> 00:33:52,139
salvation. But whatever day it was that you got saved, and then there's going to become a time

667
00:33:52,139 --> 00:33:57,579
of glorification when we go to see the Lord. And I don't know when that's going to be, you don't

668
00:33:57,579 --> 00:34:02,139
know when that's going to be. Death can come knocking on our door at any time, but also we

669
00:34:02,139 --> 00:34:07,099
have the wonderful promise that Jesus could come at any time. Listen for the trumpet, the songwriter

670
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:15,019
said, for Jesus is coming, amen. And we find this morning that between salvation and glorification,

671
00:34:15,019 --> 00:34:20,859
it's the Christian life, it's the process of sanctification, and it's living here and running

672
00:34:20,859 --> 00:34:27,339
this course, this race, and the Christian life, and all that we face. And we have this truth that

673
00:34:27,339 --> 00:34:36,619
we are secure in the hand of God. What a joy that is to know the security of the Lord.

674
00:34:38,059 --> 00:34:43,819
I remember when we first moved into our condo in Manassas, when we lived there,

675
00:34:45,019 --> 00:34:50,059
I remember it was a new development. And so, of course, after you move in, you have all sorts of

676
00:34:50,059 --> 00:34:53,979
folks that come into the community. And one of those groups of people that like to come to the

677
00:34:53,979 --> 00:34:58,139
community after you move in, and especially in a new development, are security system folks,

678
00:34:58,139 --> 00:35:01,979
because they want to get a lot of jobs of being able to sell security systems to all these new

679
00:35:01,979 --> 00:35:07,179
potential customers, and so on and so forth. And Holly answered the door. I was here at the office,

680
00:35:07,179 --> 00:35:12,299
and she answered the door and talked to that salesman that day. And I share the testimony

681
00:35:12,299 --> 00:35:21,499
just because of the faith, the simple faith. And the salesman was a little pushy and tried to

682
00:35:21,499 --> 00:35:25,419
push her on the fact that she needed this system. And she said this, she said,

683
00:35:25,499 --> 00:35:31,659
my father gives us security. And the guy looked at her like she was crazy, like, who's your dad,

684
00:35:31,659 --> 00:35:35,259
right? Like, what are you talking about your father? And she said, well, we're saved. And the Bible

685
00:35:35,259 --> 00:35:41,739
says that safety is of the Lord. Praise the Lord, the security that he provides us, we are secure

686
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:47,899
in his hand. And as we go through this life, and we face various trials and tribulations and

687
00:35:47,899 --> 00:35:54,619
difficulties, Paul was encountering great opposition in his life. He's writing knowing that he's going

688
00:35:54,619 --> 00:36:01,259
to face a martyr's death, but he knows that he's in the hand of God. You know what's awesome about

689
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:06,139
knowing you're in the hand of God? Everything that happens in your life and in my life has to get his

690
00:36:06,139 --> 00:36:12,539
permission. It goes through his filter. Think about that for a moment. If you're a child of God this

691
00:36:12,539 --> 00:36:17,259
morning, if you've been saved by the grace of God, you know that heaven is your home, you are secure

692
00:36:17,259 --> 00:36:22,939
in the hand of God, and everything that happens in your life and everything that happens in my life,

693
00:36:22,939 --> 00:36:28,699
God knows about it and God allows it. You say, what about this difficulty? You mean to tell me

694
00:36:28,699 --> 00:36:34,219
that God allowed that? Yeah, because God works through the difficulties. You know, God teaches

695
00:36:34,219 --> 00:36:42,939
us lessons in time of difficulty that we could learn in no other setting. It's true. How do the

696
00:36:42,939 --> 00:36:47,899
disciples know that Christ had the power to calm a storm if they never encountered a storm?

697
00:36:47,899 --> 00:37:01,499
Anyone? No. How would we know if we did not have the record that we read in the Gospels of the

698
00:37:01,499 --> 00:37:07,979
miracles of the Lord Jesus Christ that he has the power? Remember what they said, what manner of man

699
00:37:07,979 --> 00:37:16,219
is this that even the winds and the waves obey him? He is God in flesh, and he simply stood as they said,

700
00:37:16,219 --> 00:37:24,059
Master, carest thou not that we perish? Peace, be still. He has the power over the storm. Do you know

701
00:37:24,059 --> 00:37:28,939
if you read the entirety of that portion of Scripture, you understand that they were secure

702
00:37:28,939 --> 00:37:38,299
and safe on the shore, and Jesus instructed them to go to the other side. You know that he knows

703
00:37:38,299 --> 00:37:42,859
everything. He knows the end from the beginning. He knows all things, and in instructing them to go to

704
00:37:42,859 --> 00:37:50,619
the other side, you know what happens? They encounter a storm on purpose. You want more

705
00:37:50,619 --> 00:37:55,739
examples? Well, what about when God called Abraham and he sends him, and you know that as soon as

706
00:37:55,739 --> 00:38:04,059
Abraham gets to where he gets, you know that there's a famine? God was proving him. What about

707
00:38:04,059 --> 00:38:09,819
the truth when we look at John chapter number 11? He whom thou lovest is sick. Lazarus, they don't

708
00:38:09,819 --> 00:38:14,859
even name his name in the beginning of the text, just simply he whom thou lovest is sick.

709
00:38:17,499 --> 00:38:21,339
Did Jesus allow that sickness? Absolutely. He said it was for the glory of God.

710
00:38:23,979 --> 00:38:31,259
Master, if you'd been here, he'd not died. Oh no, I'm on time. I'm going to show you. Do you believe?

711
00:38:32,699 --> 00:38:37,339
If you just believe, oh, we believe that if you were here, you could have healed them.

712
00:38:37,339 --> 00:38:43,979
In fact, the mourners that were gathered, they said as Jesus wept in John 11 and verse number 30,

713
00:38:43,979 --> 00:38:48,539
following that text, it says that those mourners, they said, well, if he had been,

714
00:38:48,539 --> 00:38:53,739
he healed the guy that was born blind, John chapter number 9. And surely if he was here,

715
00:38:53,739 --> 00:38:58,619
he could have healed. But Jesus is right on time. Why? None of them believed that he could raise

716
00:38:58,619 --> 00:39:05,979
Lazarus from the dead. But you know what he did? Move that stone. Oh, he stinks. He's been dead

717
00:39:05,979 --> 00:39:17,179
for four days. Lazarus, come forth. See the trials in our life are for God's glory and for our growth.

718
00:39:18,219 --> 00:39:21,499
And I understand that when we're going through the midst of the storm,

719
00:39:22,379 --> 00:39:27,499
it's not always easy to acknowledge that. I understand that. But we must

720
00:39:28,459 --> 00:39:37,419
stand upon the truth that God has given us. And Paul says, I'm secure. I'm saved. I've been

721
00:39:37,419 --> 00:39:43,099
strengthened, but I'm secure. Let me read a couple of verses in closing. Go to John chapter number 10.

722
00:39:43,179 --> 00:39:49,739
John chapter number 10. What a great portion of Scripture.

723
00:39:58,059 --> 00:39:58,939
John chapter number

724
00:39:58,939 --> 00:40:02,299
10 beginning in verse number 27, the Bible says this,

725
00:40:02,299 --> 00:40:07,799
my sheep hear my voice, and I know them and they follow me.

726
00:40:07,799 --> 00:40:12,899
By the way, you notice what he says, my sheep hear my voice.

727
00:40:12,899 --> 00:40:15,299
Are you saved?

728
00:40:15,299 --> 00:40:17,399
That's how you become one of his sheep.

729
00:40:17,399 --> 00:40:20,799
Remember what David said, a very familiar passage in Psalm 23,

730
00:40:20,799 --> 00:40:25,499
the Lord is my shepherd.

731
00:40:25,499 --> 00:40:28,699
My sheep hear my voice.

732
00:40:28,699 --> 00:40:33,199
And he says this, and I know them and they follow me.

733
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:38,459
Notice in verse 28, and I give unto them eternal life,

734
00:40:38,459 --> 00:40:40,899
and they shall never perish.

735
00:40:40,899 --> 00:40:45,459
Neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.

736
00:40:45,459 --> 00:40:47,599
Isn't that a beautiful truth?

737
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:49,559
The security that we have in Christ.

738
00:40:49,559 --> 00:40:53,359
He gives us, when we trust Christ as our Savior,

739
00:40:53,419 --> 00:40:55,519
when we're saved, we become his sheep,

740
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:57,919
as we see the truth here in verse 27.

741
00:40:57,919 --> 00:41:00,459
And he says this, I give unto them eternal life.

742
00:41:00,459 --> 00:41:01,699
The wages of sin is death,

743
00:41:01,699 --> 00:41:05,299
but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ,

744
00:41:05,299 --> 00:41:06,959
our Lord, Romans chapter six.

745
00:41:06,959 --> 00:41:08,219
And we find here that he says,

746
00:41:08,219 --> 00:41:09,519
I give unto them eternal life,

747
00:41:09,519 --> 00:41:11,759
and they shall never perish.

748
00:41:11,759 --> 00:41:14,259
Neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.

749
00:41:14,259 --> 00:41:15,659
And so think about this,

750
00:41:15,659 --> 00:41:18,119
and we'll read verse 29 in just a moment.

751
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:19,819
I'm secure in the hand of God.

752
00:41:20,819 --> 00:41:22,059
He says in verse 29,

753
00:41:22,059 --> 00:41:24,919
my Father which gave them me is greater than all,

754
00:41:24,919 --> 00:41:27,359
and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.

755
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:29,479
I and my Father are one.

756
00:41:29,479 --> 00:41:31,419
What a beautiful truth

757
00:41:31,419 --> 00:41:33,679
of the security that we have in Christ.

758
00:41:34,879 --> 00:41:37,419
The security that we have in Christ.

759
00:41:37,419 --> 00:41:38,779
I hope this morning

760
00:41:39,879 --> 00:41:43,259
that you not only understand the security for heaven,

761
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:46,319
the fact that if you get saved,

762
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:48,759
that you become a child of God and heaven is your home

763
00:41:48,759 --> 00:41:50,719
and you can have that security.

764
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:53,899
If you read the book of 1 Peter in chapter one,

765
00:41:53,899 --> 00:41:55,099
you find that he talks about

766
00:41:55,099 --> 00:41:57,419
that we have an inheritance that's undefiled,

767
00:41:57,419 --> 00:42:01,419
that fadeth not away, that's reserved in heaven for us.

768
00:42:01,419 --> 00:42:04,219
And I mean, what great truth that is given to us

769
00:42:04,219 --> 00:42:08,299
with regard to the security of salvation.

770
00:42:09,259 --> 00:42:12,959
God didn't say that his gift was temporary life.

771
00:42:12,959 --> 00:42:14,759
He didn't say that it was probationary life.

772
00:42:14,759 --> 00:42:18,059
He said that his gift is eternal life.

773
00:42:19,719 --> 00:42:22,459
And I am a possessor of eternal life

774
00:42:22,459 --> 00:42:24,319
because I've been saved.

775
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:26,199
But I want you to understand that God wants you

776
00:42:26,199 --> 00:42:29,999
to acknowledge the fact that you're secure

777
00:42:29,999 --> 00:42:33,159
until that moment of glorification.

778
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:35,459
From salvation to glorification,

779
00:42:35,459 --> 00:42:38,259
this Christian life, however many days and years

780
00:42:38,259 --> 00:42:39,599
that God would give us,

781
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:42,699
that I'm still secure in the hand of God.

782
00:42:43,699 --> 00:42:45,399
Do you remember the life of Job?

783
00:42:46,719 --> 00:42:47,959
Remember the life of Job?

784
00:42:48,999 --> 00:42:51,059
I won't take the time to go there this morning,

785
00:42:51,059 --> 00:42:53,259
but if you read the opening book

786
00:42:53,259 --> 00:42:55,359
or the opening chapter of the book of Job,

787
00:42:55,359 --> 00:43:00,359
you find that Job dealt with some crazy stuff.

788
00:43:02,759 --> 00:43:04,899
You think you had a bad day or a bad week?

789
00:43:04,899 --> 00:43:07,219
Just go read Job, seriously.

790
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:12,419
But you know what we find when we read the book of Job?

791
00:43:12,419 --> 00:43:14,259
The enemy had two things.

792
00:43:14,259 --> 00:43:16,159
The enemy, number one, had permission,

793
00:43:17,159 --> 00:43:19,259
and number two, had limitations.

794
00:43:21,519 --> 00:43:25,459
And our enemy today still has limitations.

795
00:43:25,459 --> 00:43:27,759
If you read in the book of Revelation,

796
00:43:27,759 --> 00:43:29,899
you read in the ninth chapter

797
00:43:29,899 --> 00:43:31,959
when you're going through the time of the tribulation

798
00:43:31,959 --> 00:43:33,459
and all that takes place,

799
00:43:33,459 --> 00:43:36,419
they're given specific restrictions or limitations

800
00:43:36,419 --> 00:43:38,459
on what they can and cannot do.

801
00:43:39,959 --> 00:43:41,419
We have an enemy.

802
00:43:41,419 --> 00:43:42,719
Our enemy wants to devour us,

803
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:45,719
but our enemy is a defeated foe.

804
00:43:45,819 --> 00:43:48,519
And therefore, Paul is able to say

805
00:43:48,519 --> 00:43:51,479
in 2 Timothy 4 and verse number 18,

806
00:43:51,479 --> 00:43:52,919
with great confidence,

807
00:43:52,919 --> 00:43:57,059
and the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work.

808
00:43:57,059 --> 00:43:59,279
It doesn't mean that there's not gonna be opposition.

809
00:43:59,279 --> 00:44:01,559
It doesn't mean that there's not gonna be those

810
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:03,379
that would come against me and oppose me,

811
00:44:03,379 --> 00:44:05,459
but the Lord, he will deliver me

812
00:44:05,459 --> 00:44:08,419
and he will preserve me into his heavenly kingdom.

813
00:44:08,419 --> 00:44:10,219
Listen, he then ends with,

814
00:44:10,219 --> 00:44:15,079
to whom be glory forever and ever, amen.

815
00:44:15,079 --> 00:44:19,179
This morning, simple message as we close

816
00:44:19,179 --> 00:44:21,919
this series throughout this calendar year

817
00:44:21,919 --> 00:44:23,479
on 1 and 2 Timothy.

818
00:44:25,479 --> 00:44:28,839
But it's a message that is applicable to each of us.

819
00:44:28,839 --> 00:44:30,219
We must answer the questions,

820
00:44:30,219 --> 00:44:33,319
number one, have we been saved?

821
00:44:33,319 --> 00:44:35,439
See, we see that Paul was saved.

822
00:44:35,439 --> 00:44:36,739
Have you been saved this morning?

823
00:44:36,739 --> 00:44:40,279
Do you know for sure that heaven is your home?

824
00:44:40,279 --> 00:44:41,519
There was a time in your life

825
00:44:41,519 --> 00:44:43,239
where you recognized that you were a sinner

826
00:44:43,239 --> 00:44:46,179
and that he, Christ, is the only savior.

827
00:44:46,179 --> 00:44:48,139
You can't get to heaven by your good works.

828
00:44:48,139 --> 00:44:51,079
You can't get to heaven because of who your parents are

829
00:44:51,079 --> 00:44:52,699
or grandparents are.

830
00:44:54,199 --> 00:44:55,899
The only way to heaven, Jesus said,

831
00:44:55,899 --> 00:45:00,279
no man cometh unto the father but by me.

832
00:45:00,279 --> 00:45:02,499
Have you been saved this morning?

833
00:45:02,499 --> 00:45:05,599
You know for sure, I mean without a shadow of a doubt,

834
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:07,739
that heaven is your home.

835
00:45:07,739 --> 00:45:10,879
If you've been saved and you're a child of God,

836
00:45:10,879 --> 00:45:13,539
have you experienced the strength of God?

837
00:45:13,539 --> 00:45:16,539
Have you been strengthened by the Lord?

838
00:45:16,539 --> 00:45:18,519
I mean, you've acknowledged in your life

839
00:45:18,519 --> 00:45:20,479
that he's strengthened you in the inner man,

840
00:45:20,479 --> 00:45:23,339
that we have this ministry and we faint not.

841
00:45:23,339 --> 00:45:24,179
Why?

842
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:26,479
Because we've been strengthened.

843
00:45:26,479 --> 00:45:29,179
Be strong in the Lord and the power of his might.

844
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:33,679
I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.

845
00:45:34,879 --> 00:45:37,479
Have you experienced God's strength in your life?

846
00:45:38,379 --> 00:45:42,739
And then are you living a life of security?

847
00:45:42,739 --> 00:45:46,479
Are you living every day knowing that you're secure

848
00:45:46,479 --> 00:45:48,639
in the hand of God?

849
00:45:48,639 --> 00:45:51,939
And when that trial comes, when that difficulty comes,

850
00:45:51,939 --> 00:45:53,779
do you have the faith?

851
00:45:53,779 --> 00:45:57,739
Do you have the perspective that God has allowed this

852
00:45:57,739 --> 00:45:59,579
and he has a purpose for this

853
00:45:59,579 --> 00:46:02,339
and he's going to receive glory through this

854
00:46:02,339 --> 00:46:07,079
and I'm going to grow through this and God has a purpose?

855
00:46:07,079 --> 00:46:09,579
First Peter chapter number one continues

856
00:46:09,579 --> 00:46:11,639
after speaking about all of the benefits

857
00:46:11,639 --> 00:46:13,179
and the security that we have,

858
00:46:13,179 --> 00:46:16,219
that if need be, you're in manifold temptations,

859
00:46:16,219 --> 00:46:17,979
that you have these trials,

860
00:46:17,979 --> 00:46:21,319
but they grow us and they develop us.

861
00:46:21,319 --> 00:46:22,979
What a joy.

862
00:46:22,979 --> 00:46:24,739
Because there are certain things that I have learned

863
00:46:24,739 --> 00:46:27,479
on this Christian life, this Christian journey,

864
00:46:27,479 --> 00:46:30,239
that I learned in times of difficulty

865
00:46:31,879 --> 00:46:35,579
that no other classroom would have been able to teach me.

866
00:46:36,539 --> 00:46:38,479
Those same truths.

867
00:46:38,479 --> 00:46:40,739
Then the classroom of difficulty.

868
00:46:41,679 --> 00:46:45,979
This morning, the apostle Paul's exalting the Lord.

869
00:46:45,979 --> 00:46:49,739
He says, to whom be glory forever and ever, amen.

870
00:46:49,739 --> 00:46:52,919
You know, if you're saved, it brings glory to God.

871
00:46:52,919 --> 00:46:55,639
When you're strengthened by the Lord,

872
00:46:55,639 --> 00:46:57,279
it brings glory to God.

873
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:58,119
Why?

874
00:46:58,119 --> 00:46:59,719
Because you don't sit back and say, look at what I did.

875
00:46:59,719 --> 00:47:03,579
No, God strengthened me for it, amen.

876
00:47:03,819 --> 00:47:06,379
And when we're secure, we don't provide our own security,

877
00:47:06,379 --> 00:47:08,479
it's his security that he gives us.

878
00:47:08,479 --> 00:47:09,879
And so in each of those things,

879
00:47:09,879 --> 00:47:11,939
you know who's receiving the glory?

880
00:47:11,939 --> 00:47:12,979
God.

881
00:47:12,979 --> 00:47:15,339
So through salvation to glorification,

882
00:47:15,339 --> 00:47:17,379
you know who's to be glorified?

883
00:47:17,379 --> 00:47:18,739
God.

884
00:47:18,739 --> 00:47:21,779
I hope this morning that your life and my life

885
00:47:21,779 --> 00:47:23,719
is bringing glory to God.

886
00:47:23,719 --> 00:47:25,379
If you're not saved this morning,

887
00:47:25,379 --> 00:47:27,419
the very first point that we dealt with,

888
00:47:27,419 --> 00:47:29,439
we'd love to take a Bible.

889
00:47:29,439 --> 00:47:30,639
During our time of invitation,

890
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:34,139
we have it at the end of every service that we have.

891
00:47:34,139 --> 00:47:35,179
We'd love to have you come

892
00:47:35,179 --> 00:47:37,939
and be able to take a Bible, a lady with a lady,

893
00:47:37,939 --> 00:47:38,779
a man with a man,

894
00:47:38,779 --> 00:47:40,279
and show you what God's word says

895
00:47:40,279 --> 00:47:43,299
about how you can be saved.

896
00:47:43,299 --> 00:47:44,199
So that you can know for sure.

897
00:47:44,199 --> 00:47:47,799
If you have any doubt whatsoever, get it settled.

898
00:47:47,799 --> 00:47:50,799
Because he is a wonderful savior.

899
00:47:50,799 --> 00:47:51,639
Let's pray together.

900
00:47:51,639 --> 00:47:52,799
Father, we love you.

901
00:47:52,799 --> 00:47:54,239
How we thank you for loving us.

902
00:47:54,239 --> 00:47:56,539
We thank you God for the privilege

903
00:47:56,539 --> 00:47:59,479
of being able to gather this morning.

904
00:47:59,479 --> 00:48:03,639
We thank you God for your provision for us.

905
00:48:03,639 --> 00:48:05,139
Giving us a Bible.

906
00:48:06,379 --> 00:48:08,779
Giving us truth.

907
00:48:08,779 --> 00:48:11,139
God, I pray that you'd work in hearts and lives

908
00:48:11,139 --> 00:48:14,079
in this moment of invitation as only you can.

909
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:16,139
We pray that through all that's done, Lord,

910
00:48:16,139 --> 00:48:17,579
every decision that's made,

911
00:48:17,579 --> 00:48:19,539
that you alone would be glorified.

912
00:48:21,039 --> 00:48:22,019
We'll thank you for it.

913
00:48:22,019 --> 00:48:23,139
In Christ's name we pray.
