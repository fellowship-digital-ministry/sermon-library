1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,559
41 this evening, Genesis chapter 41. We'll be looking at verses 44 through 53

2
00:00:05,559 --> 00:00:09,760
and then next Sunday evening we'll finish up Genesis chapter number 41.

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,920
It's kind of interesting if you think about Genesis 41 to this point in our

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:14,600
study

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:19,360
as we enter into the 44th verse tonight. Up to this point Joseph

6
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:23,040
has been released from prison. Remember we start at the passage of Scripture and

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,280
he's still in prison. Pharaoh had a dream

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,680
no one could interpret the dream and the butler remembers, oh yeah

9
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,840
I was in prison you were angry with me and there was a man there

10
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,880
and he was able to interpret my dream and the baker's dream and they both came

11
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,959
to pass just as

12
00:00:36,959 --> 00:00:40,919
he said they would and we find that Pharaoh sent and

13
00:00:40,919 --> 00:00:44,720
called for Joseph with haste and Joseph is released from prison.

14
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:49,720
Joseph tells Pharaoh the dream. Not only does Joseph tell Pharaoh the dream

15
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,959
but remember he provides counsel to Pharaoh

16
00:00:52,959 --> 00:00:57,040
with regard to what has to happen really over the next 14 years.

17
00:00:57,319 --> 00:01:02,520
The dream that Pharaoh had really was God revealing to Pharaoh

18
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,360
what was going to happen in Egypt over the next 14 years.

19
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,400
We find that the Bible spoke of God

20
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,279
doing this work and that it would come to pass soon. It would shortly

21
00:01:13,279 --> 00:01:17,800
be brought to pass according to verse number 32 and we find that he, Joseph,

22
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:22,239
after giving the interpretation and the counsel to Pharaoh

23
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:25,959
that he is promoted to second in command over all of

24
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:30,199
Egypt. Wow, what a chapter. I mean so many amazing

25
00:01:30,199 --> 00:01:34,000
things that take place in such a short period of time

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,239
to begin Genesis chapter 41. It reminds me

27
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:40,879
of God's timing and God's timing is amazing

28
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:45,760
and when God is ready, when God's time is right

29
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:50,239
and he brings it to pass and what a blessing. There are times in which we

30
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:51,720
could be waiting and we're

31
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,639
waiting and we're waiting and it seems like what's going on

32
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:00,440
but when God is, when things are taking place in God's timing

33
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:04,160
it's perfect and it happens just as he wants it to happen.

34
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:09,960
We find this evening as we look at our text of scripture in verses 44 through 53

35
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:15,080
that God will provide us really an overview of the first seven years

36
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:19,199
of the famine. Of course we know after the first seven years or those seven

37
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:21,720
years of famine, we know, excuse me, the seven years of plenty,

38
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,679
we know that those seven years of plenty would be followed

39
00:02:24,679 --> 00:02:28,960
by seven years of famine and so these few verses of scripture

40
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,080
cover seven years of time,

41
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,199
the seven years of plenty. Now it's interesting because up to verse number

42
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:36,919
43

43
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:40,520
all of those events that I just told you happened very quickly

44
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,800
and here we find in just a handful of verses that God

45
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,080
is going to give us an overview of those seven years of plenty

46
00:02:48,279 --> 00:02:52,639
and in doing so God gives us some information with regard to Joseph

47
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:56,080
and what has been taking place. Joseph,

48
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,600
in this text of scripture, we find that he is given

49
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,800
an Egyptian name, he's also given an Egyptian bride

50
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:08,160
and God blesses, he has two children. Notice in verse number 44

51
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,360
the Bible says, and Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh

52
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,839
without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot

53
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,240
in all the land of Egypt. And Pharaoh called Joseph's name

54
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,839
Zaphnath-Paneah and he gave him to wife Asenath,

55
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:28,279
the daughter of Potipharah, priest of On

56
00:03:28,279 --> 00:03:31,800
and Joseph went out over all the land

57
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,919
of Egypt. The Bible tells us in verse 46 that Joseph was 30 years old when he

58
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:37,600
stood before Pharaoh, king of Egypt

59
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,800
and Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh and went throughout all

60
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:45,759
the land of Egypt. If you draw your attention down to verse number 52

61
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:49,520
the Bible says the name of the second called he Ephraim, this is the second child

62
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:53,039
and notice what it says, for God hath caused me to be fruitful

63
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:57,559
in the land of my affliction. I've titled the message this evening from that verse

64
00:03:57,559 --> 00:03:58,639
of scripture there

65
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:02,360
in verse number 52, fruitful in the land

66
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:06,399
of affliction. Fruitful in the land of affliction. Many times when we think

67
00:04:06,399 --> 00:04:09,800
about the land of affliction we do not think of it as being a place that would

68
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,919
produce fruit, that would be a fruitful place. In fact,

69
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,480
we think about the land of affliction or times of affliction in your life, in my

70
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,040
life,

71
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,239
we don't think of them in very pleasant terms and an idea of

72
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:25,519
looking at this passage of scripture, God helps us to learn

73
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:29,200
some important truths. As I begin to look at this passage

74
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:33,760
let me just say this by way of introduction, the name that Joseph

75
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:38,799
called, or that Pharaoh gives Joseph, the Egyptian name Zaphnath-Paneah,

76
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:44,119
the exact meaning is unclear and I'll admit that you can look at a number of

77
00:04:44,119 --> 00:04:46,480
different commentaries and theologians. In fact,

78
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,480
the meaning of Joseph's

79
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:53,799
Egyptian name has been debated amongst theologians and amongst

80
00:04:53,799 --> 00:04:59,320
Jewish rabbis for centuries, but it seems as if as you look at this and you

81
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,359
look at some things

82
00:05:00,359 --> 00:05:05,320
that this name Zaphnath-Paneah, and it really makes sense when you think about

83
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,480
this meaning,

84
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:10,119
and again there's a lot of debate and some have different opinions as to what

85
00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:10,720
it means,

86
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,839
but it seems that it carries this meaning, God speaks

87
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:20,839
and he lives. Now it could be God speaks and he giveth life,

88
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:25,160
but that idea, and I want you to think about that just for a moment,

89
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:29,079
as Pharaoh, a polytheistic,

90
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:34,600
idolatrous individual that he himself was looked at as being some level of

91
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,600
deity

92
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:40,359
by the people of Egypt, and yet as he stands there he has no

93
00:05:40,359 --> 00:05:44,320
way of having this dream interpreted, he is troubled,

94
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,559
and Joseph comes in and Joseph says, remember,

95
00:05:47,559 --> 00:05:51,359
he says, it is not in me, God shall give Pharaoh

96
00:05:51,359 --> 00:05:55,799
an answer of peace, and when God uses Joseph

97
00:05:55,799 --> 00:06:00,920
to share with Pharaoh the interpretation of the dream and to give him counsel,

98
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,160
Pharaoh could have picked any Egyptian name

99
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:09,679
to give Joseph, but it seems as if there's a consensus

100
00:06:09,679 --> 00:06:13,720
with this meeting that God speaks

101
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,119
and he lives. Isn't that precious?

102
00:06:17,119 --> 00:06:20,320
To think about the influence and impact

103
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:25,399
that Joseph could have in the life of Pharaoh because he stood there with

104
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:26,519
boldness

105
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:31,600
and he stood there in humility, I believe that his only concern, I mentioned this a

106
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,679
couple of weeks ago,

107
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,440
his only concern was for the glory of God, and when you and I are only concerned

108
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,640
for the glory of God, it's amazing what God can do

109
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:45,839
in and through our lives. As we look at the text of Scripture tonight, we begin

110
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:46,119
to

111
00:06:46,119 --> 00:06:50,920
look at these verses of Scripture, I believe that there are two principles

112
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,799
that God

113
00:06:51,799 --> 00:06:55,959
really brings into focus for us as you read through the verses,

114
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:59,200
and I hope tonight that we can consider these two principles

115
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:02,679
and seek to make application in our lives. Number one,

116
00:07:02,679 --> 00:07:05,720
I believe that we see in this passage of Scripture

117
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:10,000
the principle of preparation, the principle of preparation.

118
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,040
Why do I say that? Well, we read verses 44 and 45 already

119
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,880
and we find that Joseph is elevated to this position. The Bible tells us in

120
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,200
verse number 46,

121
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:23,200
I read it a moment ago, but notice it says, and Joseph was 30 years old

122
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,040
when he stood before Pharaoh, king of Egypt. It's interesting to me that in

123
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:31,200
this particular age, being 30 years old, he is elevated to a position of great

124
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,040
power,

125
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:36,760
but also a great responsibility. I want you to think about the power that he has.

126
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,880
Only Pharaoh would have more power

127
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,320
over all the land of Egypt, but then I want you to think about the

128
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,040
responsibility

129
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:49,799
that would be entrusted to Joseph. I mean, a great deal of responsibility

130
00:07:49,799 --> 00:07:54,000
is given to Joseph in placing him in this particular

131
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,399
position. I believe that as we look at this portion of Scripture, we begin to see

132
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:00,119
what's happening. Notice the Bible says

133
00:08:00,119 --> 00:08:04,200
that Joseph, at the end of verse number 46, he went out from the presence of Pharaoh

134
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,600
and went throughout all the land of Egypt. The Bible says in verse 47, in the

135
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,200
seven

136
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,839
plenteous years, the earth brought forth by

137
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:17,839
handfuls. Now this is aligned with what Joseph said would happen when Joseph

138
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:19,279
gives the interpretation.

139
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:23,000
He tells Pharaoh that there would be seven years of plenty

140
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:26,679
and we find that it's exactly what's taking place. The Bible says that during

141
00:08:26,679 --> 00:08:27,760
those plenteous years,

142
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,839
the earth brought forth by handfuls.

143
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:34,000
Notice in verse 48, and he gathered up

144
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,719
all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt,

145
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,760
and laid up the food in the cities, the food of the field,

146
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,799
which was round about every city, laid he

147
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:49,799
up in the same. And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea very much until

148
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:50,559
he left

149
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:54,320
numbering, for it was without number.

150
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,479
Do you see the responsibility of this position that Joseph has?

151
00:08:58,479 --> 00:09:02,080
If we begin to think about the responsibility, no doubt having a

152
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,559
position like this

153
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:07,320
and having the power, but also having the responsibility

154
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,440
to gather up during these years of plenty,

155
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,719
no doubt there would be some that would not be happy with Joseph with regard to

156
00:09:14,719 --> 00:09:18,039
that which he was doing. There would be certainly

157
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:21,239
a number of people that he would have to

158
00:09:21,239 --> 00:09:26,080
delegate responsibility to, that he would have responsibility entrusted to

159
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,559
them.

160
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:30,000
He had a great deal of responsibility laid

161
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,880
upon his shoulders, but I would submit to you this evening that God was

162
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,440
preparing Joseph for this very moment

163
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:40,719
for years. The principle of preparation.

164
00:09:40,719 --> 00:09:45,200
See, in Genesis chapter 37, we are first introduced to Joseph

165
00:09:45,239 --> 00:09:49,760
when he is 17 years old. We don't know, we really don't know anything biblically

166
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,479
scriptural

167
00:09:50,479 --> 00:09:55,599
about Joseph's life prior to that event in Genesis 37 when he comes on the scene

168
00:09:55,599 --> 00:09:56,760
as a 17-year-old,

169
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,000
but I want you to think about Joseph when he first comes on the scene at 17

170
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,840
years old, it seems as if Joseph already at that point in his life had proven to

171
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:11,039
be both faithful and trustworthy. Joseph was in a position, remember the Bible

172
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:16,399
tells us that he brought back the evil report of his brothers. He understood the

173
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:21,559
difference between right and wrong, good and evil. Oh today we have people that

174
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:27,479
are much older than 17 that seem to not have any idea of morality and the

175
00:10:27,479 --> 00:10:32,479
difference between right and wrong, good and evil. And we find that Joseph, he

176
00:10:32,479 --> 00:10:37,279
observing their behavior, he knew of their evil report or their evil behavior

177
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:42,479
and he brought back that evil report. So as his brothers depart, we find that it's

178
00:10:42,479 --> 00:10:47,159
Joseph who is given the responsibility to go see what your brothers are doing.

179
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:51,360
Bring me word again. And we find that this is the responsibility that is

180
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,479
entrusted to him and at that point in his life we find that Joseph is

181
00:10:55,479 --> 00:11:01,400
immediately obedient to what his father had instructed him to do. His dad calls

182
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,319
him and says here son here's what I want you to do. Now we already know that his

183
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:08,000
brothers didn't like him. His brothers were upset because of the dreams and all

184
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,279
that had taken place and his brothers are are not kind towards him. They could

185
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:18,400
not speak kindly to him and we find that here he goes out to find his brothers to

186
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:22,639
fulfill the responsibility that had been given to him from his father and it's

187
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:28,279
there where he's taken and put into a pit and eventually sold into slavery. We

188
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:35,800
find that he comes to Egypt and he's there in Egypt, 17 years old, about 17. We

189
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,680
find that's where we're introduced to him in Genesis 37. It seems as if all those

190
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,680
events take place pretty quickly and we come to Genesis chapter 39 and we find

191
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:48,360
that he's bought by one named Potiphar. And of course we find that Joseph

192
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,199
immediately when he comes into the place of being in Potiphar's house, he's

193
00:11:52,199 --> 00:11:55,480
elevated to a position of responsibility and he has the

194
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:02,879
responsibility to take care of, to be a minister there in the house of Potiphar

195
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:11,240
to be a steward. God's preparing Joseph. God's preparing him and we find that

196
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:15,399
Joseph after a period of time being the steward in Potiphar's house, we know that

197
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:19,399
he's lied about and he's falsely accused and he finds himself in prison and guess

198
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:24,320
what God's doing in Joseph's life in prison? He's preparing him. He's preparing

199
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:30,440
him. So nearly 13 years, about 13 years have passed since Joseph has been in

200
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:37,279
Egypt and all along the way God is preparing Joseph. God does a work of

201
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:43,600
preparation in his servants. By the way I'm thankful for the work of preparation.

202
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,880
I'm thankful for how God will lead and work in individuals lives and God has

203
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:54,720
particular purposes and wills for our lives and he desires that he would

204
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:00,399
prepare us for the task that he has for us to do. The problem is how do we deal

205
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:06,399
with the time of preparation? How do we handle that season of preparation when

206
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:11,839
God is shaping us and molding us and preparing us? Are we faithful? Are we

207
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:16,279
obedient to what God has called us to do so that we're learning what we're

208
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:20,600
supposed to learn? Because that principle of preparation is so important

209
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,800
in our lives, God is preparing us. I wonder tonight what is God preparing us

210
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:31,000
for? God has a plan and a purpose for you and your life and there are times in

211
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,600
which we have that opportunity even as Joseph did to go through a period of

212
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:42,759
preparation. And as Joseph would be entrusted with this great position of

213
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:47,320
not only power but great responsibility, we find that God had been preparing him

214
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:51,880
all along the way. Turn to the New Testament, if you will, the book of Luke. I

215
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:55,080
want to hold your place there in Genesis 41, but I want to show you two verses.

216
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,039
You're familiar with the verses no doubt in the book of Luke, but I want you to

217
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:01,759
look at Luke 16 and then we'll look at a verse over in Luke 19. And I want you to

218
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:05,820
consider with me the time, the principle that we see here of preparation. I am

219
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:10,039
thankful that through the the overview that I just provided you with all along

220
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:16,320
the way in Joseph's life, we find that he was faithful. And because he was

221
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:22,399
faithful, God was molding him and God was shaping him and he was in a position

222
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,640
that when Pharaoh says, okay Joseph, you're the one, you're the one that's

223
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:31,799
going to be in this position, that Joseph was ready for the task that was given to

224
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:36,000
him. Notice in Luke chapter 16 and verse number 10, the Bible says, he that is

225
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:43,839
faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much. And he that is

226
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:52,079
unjust in the least is unjust also in much. You know, a good indicator of the

227
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:56,079
faithfulness of individuals is how do they handle the little things that are

228
00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:00,279
entrusted to them. The things that people might say, well that's really not that

229
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:05,500
big of a deal, but no, it is a big deal. And we learn to be faithful in the

230
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:11,380
little things and God will entrust us with bigger things. God will give us that

231
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:15,820
responsibility. Why? Because he's preparing us even through those times.

232
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:20,579
Joseph finds himself in Potiphar's house. What am I doing here? Why have I

233
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:24,700
been sold here? And God's preparing him and he's faithful and God is with him

234
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:29,660
and he's doing what he's supposed to be doing and he's the steward and he's so

235
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:36,980
able to do what God has given him to do that even the Potiphar, the ruler of the

236
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:41,899
home, he doesn't even know what's going on. He didn't trust at all to Joseph, the

237
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:47,380
prison guard. He does the same thing. Joseph is faithful in that which is

238
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:53,100
least and God gives him great responsibility. Notice in Luke chapter

239
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:59,899
19 and verse number 17. Luke 19 and verse number 17, this is a passage, we

240
00:15:59,899 --> 00:16:04,459
could really look at the entirety of it from verse 11 down through verse 27 of

241
00:16:04,459 --> 00:16:08,859
the truth of being faithful, but I want to just draw your attention to verse 17

242
00:16:08,859 --> 00:16:12,140
and we'll get back over to the book of Genesis. Notice it says here,

243
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:16,619
and he said unto him, well thou good servant, because thou hast been faithful

244
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:26,140
in very little, have thou authority over ten cities. Faithful over little. You

245
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:29,940
know what God's doing when he entrusts us with those little things? He's

246
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:35,459
preparing us. He's preparing us. And I don't know exactly what he's preparing

247
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:39,459
each and every one of us for, but it's very interesting how God works in the

248
00:16:39,459 --> 00:16:44,660
season of preparation. I'll use a personal illustration and when I was

249
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:47,339
working in the corporate world, I remember working in the corporate world

250
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:50,739
for a number of years and I had studied. I knew that God called me to the

251
00:16:50,739 --> 00:16:54,980
ministry and I knew that that's what God wanted me to do. I was working in our

252
00:16:54,980 --> 00:17:00,100
church doing all that the pastor would allow me to do with regard to ministry

253
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:05,019
and opportunities and things were going well there, but I knew God had called me

254
00:17:05,019 --> 00:17:10,980
to pastor and I was working in the corporate world and honestly things were

255
00:17:11,019 --> 00:17:14,899
going absolutely wonderful from a corporate perspective with regard to

256
00:17:14,899 --> 00:17:18,500
promotions and all of those types of things, but I knew that's not where God

257
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:24,660
had me forever. I knew that God called me to the ministry. And yet during that time,

258
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:30,019
because of a principle that was taught to me by a spiritual mentor of

259
00:17:30,019 --> 00:17:35,179
understanding that God is able to prepare us through every season of life,

260
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:41,500
that I determined that even while I was there, I was going to seek to be the best

261
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:46,540
that I could be for the Lord and learn what I could learn so that God could use

262
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:53,820
that time for whatever the future would be. And it's amazing to me, and I give all

263
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:58,619
the glory to God, it's amazing to me on the opportunities that the Lord allowed

264
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:05,019
me to have in the corporate world that have been such a blessing and a help

265
00:18:05,019 --> 00:18:09,980
when it comes to pastoring. Things that they don't teach you in Bible college,

266
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:13,179
things that they don't teach you in seminary, things that you don't have any

267
00:18:13,179 --> 00:18:18,220
classes on certain things, and the opportunity that I had in that

268
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:25,299
particular season of life in a time of preparation. And because of the influence

269
00:18:25,299 --> 00:18:30,420
in my life that was given to me that, hey, I know that this is not where you're

270
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:34,099
going to be forever, I know that you believe God's called you to pastor, but

271
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:40,020
in this place, learn what God has for you to learn. It's a season of preparation.

272
00:18:40,739 --> 00:18:46,580
And how I thank God for how he prepared and the things that he taught me.

273
00:18:47,619 --> 00:18:53,539
As we look in the book of Genesis in chapter 41, I believe that here we see a principle

274
00:18:53,539 --> 00:18:59,299
of preparation that Joseph, now at 30 years old, he is entrusted with this great position

275
00:18:59,299 --> 00:19:06,179
and he has great responsibility, he has great power, but God had been preparing him all along.

276
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:09,780
It's not as if Joseph just, bam, you're going to be second in command. No, there was

277
00:19:11,219 --> 00:19:18,340
he was 17 when he first there is introduced to us in Genesis 37. So 13 years of preparation

278
00:19:18,979 --> 00:19:24,900
before he goes to the place, the position that we read of him having here. By the way,

279
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:29,380
I think that if Joseph could stand here and give testimony, he'd be able to tell us that

280
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:37,059
through those 13 years, God was preparing him for the task that was at hand. And what a blessing.

281
00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:41,299
I see another principle in our text of scripture, not only a principle of preparation,

282
00:19:41,299 --> 00:19:47,059
but I see the principle of perspective. Perspective. You know, everyone has a different

283
00:19:47,059 --> 00:19:51,940
perspective in life. Everyone has a different perspective when it comes to circumstances

284
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:57,299
and events that take place in our lives, even in the lives of others. And we begin to

285
00:19:57,299 --> 00:19:59,940
look here and we find even as I've mentioned for the time...

286
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:04,660
title of the message this evening, Fruitful in the Land of Affliction, we find that here

287
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:10,020
God gives us some glimpse with regard to the principle of perspective. I believe that it's

288
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:14,840
revealed to us Joseph, as I mentioned by way of introduction, had been given an Egyptian

289
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:20,140
name and he had been given an Egyptian bride, yet when his two sons are born he gives them

290
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:28,100
Hebrew names. And in giving them Hebrew names and understanding the meaning of the names,

291
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:35,580
we find that it helps us to be able to learn about Joseph's perspective. What is his perspective

292
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:39,860
with all that he's dealt with, with all that he's endured? The Bible tells us in verse

293
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:46,180
number 50, and unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came. So in those

294
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:52,200
first seven years of plenty, we find that Joseph was blessed by the Lord to have two

295
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:58,460
sons, it says, which Asenath, the daughter of Potipharah, priest of On, bear unto him.

296
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:03,760
And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh. Notice what he says when we see

297
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:10,800
the firstborn that is named here, Manasseh, the name means forgetfulness. It means to

298
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:15,720
forget. Now it doesn't mean to forget like you forgot what was on your grocery list.

299
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,279
Alright, how many of you ever forget what's on your grocery list? You understand what

300
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:23,380
I'm saying? And we got so many tools that help us to remember things and yet we seem

301
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:27,639
to forget things. And I have the opposite problem with a grocery list. I add things

302
00:21:27,639 --> 00:21:31,360
to it. I go down the cookie aisle and I'm like, oh yeah, we need those cookies and we

303
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,980
need ice cream. And Holly says that wasn't on the list, but it just got in the cart somehow,

304
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:41,120
you understand. But that's not what it means when we're talking about forgetfulness. It's

305
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:47,279
this purpose of forgetting, this intentional forgetting something. Notice what he says,

306
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:57,080
For God, said he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house. Now I

307
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:01,840
don't believe that he's meaning all of the positive things and the good things because

308
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:06,080
obviously there's some good things that he learned. He learned about Jehovah God. We

309
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,960
find that even in giving his testimony and standing before Pharaoh and standing before

310
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:16,919
his brothers as we go through the remainder of Genesis, we find that he continues to give

311
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:24,440
glory to God. He did not forget the God of his father. He did not forget those truths

312
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:31,160
that he was given. But I want you to understand that Joseph is saying that this idea of forgetfulness,

313
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:34,320
that God made me to forget all my toil and my father's house. You know there were a lot

314
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:45,680
of bad things that happened to Joseph. Right? We've studied them. Hated by your brothers.

315
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:51,080
I mean to the point where they can't even speak kindly to you. This is a hatred at a

316
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:55,880
whole nother level. We think about the selling into slavery. I mean they were going to kill

317
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:59,460
him and then they decided no let's not kill him because we can actually get some money

318
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:04,520
for him so why don't we sell him into slavery. And even as they had determined that they're

319
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:08,919
going to put him in that pit so they could kill him, they're sitting there eating. I

320
00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:13,639
mean they have no care or concern whatsoever. And here's the thought tonight when we think

321
00:23:13,639 --> 00:23:20,839
about the principle of perspective. The negatives that are in our past, they must not rob us

322
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:26,040
of our opportunity for today. See there are some negatives in each of our lives. There

323
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:30,279
are some negatives in Joseph's life. There were some things that happened to him that

324
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:34,880
if he determined that that was going to be the focus of his attention, if every day of

325
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,400
his life he was going to just focus upon the fact that my brothers did me wrong, that my

326
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:44,680
brothers did this and my brothers did that and this is not fair and this is not right,

327
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:51,800
Joseph would not be second in command. He had to forget that stuff because those negatives

328
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:58,680
would hinder Joseph from being able to do what God had for him to do. I want you to

329
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,320
think about the principle. Turn to the book of Philippians if you will. Again hold your

330
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:05,279
spot here in Genesis but turn to the book of Philippians and I want you to look at Philippians

331
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:10,559
chapter number 3. I want you to think about what Paul says in this portion of scripture

332
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:14,720
and there's so much rich truth in Philippians chapter number 3. I wish we could study all

333
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:20,220
of it this evening but I want to draw your attention to some things that Paul says with

334
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:26,279
regard to even what we find here in the life of Joseph in Genesis chapter 41 when he names

335
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:33,760
his firstborn Manasseh, the idea of forgetfulness. Notice that Paul says this in verse number

336
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,760
10, I'll start there, that I may know him and the power of his resurrection, the fellowship

337
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:43,959
of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death. So he reveals to us his desire

338
00:24:43,959 --> 00:24:49,200
to know the Lord in a very intimate way, not just knowing about God but knowing him personally

339
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:54,799
and intimately. If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead, not as

340
00:24:54,799 --> 00:25:00,320
though I had already attained, either were already perfect, but I follow after, if then

341
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:06,320
I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus. And then notice

342
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:14,119
verse 13, brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended. But this one thing I do,

343
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:20,640
forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which

344
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:27,320
are before, I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ

345
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,600
Jesus. You know, there are a lot of people today that are crippled because of the things

346
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:40,559
that happened to them in the past. They're crippled, figuratively speaking, because of

347
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:45,959
the things that happened to them in the past. They've not forgotten them. They're holding

348
00:25:45,959 --> 00:25:53,360
on to them. They're bothered by them. The Bible teaches in the book of Hebrews the danger

349
00:25:53,360 --> 00:26:00,019
of a root of bitterness. You know what often happens when we cannot forget those negatives

350
00:26:00,019 --> 00:26:11,059
in the past is we get bitter. We get bitter. And bitterness will absolutely destroy you.

351
00:26:11,059 --> 00:26:17,899
It will destroy you. Someone said bitterness will destroy the vessel in which it's stored

352
00:26:17,899 --> 00:26:27,899
more than the vessel in which it's poured. Bitterness will destroy you. Joseph could

353
00:26:27,899 --> 00:26:34,459
have been bitter over the things that happened in his life, over the treatment that he experienced.

354
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:43,540
I've only focused on his brothers, but think about Mrs. Potiphar as she lied and had him

355
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:51,299
imprisoned. I mean, you think about Joseph coming into Egypt and all the events that

356
00:26:51,299 --> 00:26:54,940
happened to lead him there. And then he's in the house of Potiphar. And I mean, even

357
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:59,700
though he's purchased as a slave, I mean, he's pretty successful and he's become the

358
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:03,299
steward of the house and things are going well. But then Mrs. Potiphar lies about him

359
00:27:03,299 --> 00:27:08,980
and he finds himself in prison. Man, there's some things that he could get bitter about.

360
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:17,019
Listen, be careful about bitterness. Many people today are crippled because of things

361
00:27:17,019 --> 00:27:22,559
that happened in their past. They just can't get over them. Can I say this? Be careful

362
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:32,339
about psychologists and psychiatrists. I'm not either one. Anytime I'm asked to give

363
00:27:32,339 --> 00:27:38,959
counsel, I seek to give biblical counsel and I do it often. However, I would say this.

364
00:27:38,959 --> 00:27:46,119
Sometimes they just want to dig up things in the past and never really resolve them.

365
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:51,040
Never really resolve them. And it can become very dangerous. And what I'm saying to you

366
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:54,679
this evening is that when we look at this principle of perspective, where's your focus

367
00:27:54,679 --> 00:27:59,959
tonight? What are we focused on? If we just want to focus on the hurt and the harm and

368
00:27:59,959 --> 00:28:05,519
the bad things that happened to us in our past, it will cripple you from doing today

369
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:12,399
what God has for you to do today. We can't live in the past. We can't change the past.

370
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:16,519
It doesn't matter how angry we are. It doesn't matter how bitter we are about the things

371
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:23,519
that happened to us. We cannot change them. Amen? You can't. You can't change them.

372
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:33,840
As we see the firstborn son, Joseph called his name Manasseh. Forgetfulness. For God

373
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:41,080
said he hath made me forget all my toil and all my father's house. I believe it's because

374
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:46,940
of the name of the firstborn that we're able to read of the secondborn. I believe it's

375
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:50,720
because of the perspective that I'm going to forget those things, the negatives, and

376
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:57,159
I'm not going to let those hinder me from doing what God has for me. I find that in

377
00:28:57,159 --> 00:29:03,679
the 52nd verse we're told about the secondborn and it says here that he, the name of the

378
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:15,640
second, called he Ephraim. For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.

379
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:24,119
I mean, what a perspective that Joseph has. Listen, he calls it what it is. It's a land

380
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:29,280
of affliction. We don't have to sugarcoat things. We can call them what they are, but

381
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:33,440
the reality is that even in the midst of what looks like and as we would look at this

382
00:29:33,479 --> 00:29:37,880
portion of scripture and look at all of the events in the life of Joseph, we could say

383
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:42,679
yeah that's a land of affliction, but he says, but God made me to be fruitful. And so Ephraim

384
00:29:42,679 --> 00:29:48,280
means fruitfulness. It means fruitfulness. God hath caused him to be fruitful in the

385
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:52,080
land of his affliction. And I want you to think about being fruitful. God has called

386
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:58,679
us to be fruitful. Has he not? Turn to the book of John, if you will, John chapter number

387
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:00,039
15, and I want you to look.

388
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:05,879
here at the truth of this idea of us as God's people being fruitful people.

389
00:30:05,879 --> 00:30:12,119
We find here that Joseph says, God hath made me, he hath caused me to be fruitful in the

390
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:16,399
land of my affliction.

391
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:21,879
What enabled Joseph to be fruitful in the land of his affliction was his perspective

392
00:30:21,879 --> 00:30:26,999
on understanding, as we looked at that firstborn son Manasseh, that forgetfulness.

393
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:32,159
Man, if he just focused and just stayed on all of that and just determined that's where

394
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:36,559
he was going to live, he would not be fruitful.

395
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:42,459
John 15, notice in verse number one, I am the true vine, Jesus is speaking.

396
00:30:42,459 --> 00:30:45,759
My father is the husbandman.

397
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:52,279
Often Jesus would use illustrations and analogies that people could easily relate to.

398
00:30:52,279 --> 00:31:00,359
And here he's using this very familiar teaching and truth with regard to agriculture, if you

399
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:01,359
will.

400
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:04,879
And he says, I am the true vine, and my father is the husbandman.

401
00:31:04,879 --> 00:31:10,159
Every branch in me that beareth not fruit, he taketh away.

402
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:16,579
And every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.

403
00:31:16,579 --> 00:31:21,359
So who are the branches that are in Jesus?

404
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:25,519
We are, Christians, disciples, followers of Christ.

405
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:26,519
Do you track?

406
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:27,519
You see what's going on?

407
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,719
Listen, he is the true vine.

408
00:31:29,719 --> 00:31:34,639
He'll say in just a little while, I am the vine, ye are the branches.

409
00:31:34,639 --> 00:31:39,559
And he says here, every branch in me, and so we know that we are the branches if we've

410
00:31:39,559 --> 00:31:43,359
trusted Jesus Christ as our personal Savior, we are the branches.

411
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:51,319
And he says, every branch in me that beareth not fruit, he taketh away.

412
00:31:51,319 --> 00:31:56,039
That's a little bit scary.

413
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,039
You know why?

414
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:00,359
Because God's purpose is that we'd be fruitful.

415
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:04,799
What good is a fruit tree if it doesn't produce fruit?

416
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:05,799
They would understand this.

417
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:08,839
You've got a fig tree, and it doesn't produce figs.

418
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:11,719
How long are you going to keep the fig tree around?

419
00:32:11,719 --> 00:32:15,439
Three years, four years, 14 years, 22 years, no, eventually you're going to cut that thing

420
00:32:15,439 --> 00:32:20,519
down and you're going to plant something else because it's not producing fruit, correct?

421
00:32:20,719 --> 00:32:29,279
And the Bible says here, and every branch that beareth fruit, notice it says he purgeth

422
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:30,279
it.

423
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:37,039
Now, I'm not an arborist, I'm not an agricultural guru, but I understand, I've done some study

424
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:42,679
and I understand the picture that Jesus is giving, and I understand the purpose of pruning.

425
00:32:42,679 --> 00:32:44,119
You know what happens when you prune?

426
00:32:44,119 --> 00:32:47,239
You get more fruit.

427
00:32:47,239 --> 00:32:51,919
You've got to cut it back, and when it grows, it produces more fruit.

428
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:55,439
I pruned these crape myrtles out here a couple of years ago, and some of you are ready to

429
00:32:55,439 --> 00:32:56,439
kill me.

430
00:32:56,439 --> 00:32:57,839
Pastor, you killed the trees.

431
00:32:57,839 --> 00:33:02,599
No, no, I did some research and I did it how they said to do it.

432
00:33:02,599 --> 00:33:07,759
I'm not an arborist, but we didn't pay somebody to do it, and I just chopped them things up,

433
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:08,759
man.

434
00:33:08,759 --> 00:33:09,759
You know what, Tim?

435
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:11,839
They came back and they were beautiful.

436
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:15,999
I mean, they just blossomed and flourished.

437
00:33:15,999 --> 00:33:22,199
Here he says, that every branch that bear fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth.

438
00:33:22,199 --> 00:33:25,759
Notice what it says, more fruit.

439
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:29,279
Verse 3, now you're clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.

440
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:34,799
You can look at that in Ephesians 5 and 26 and see the ministry of God's word and cleansing.

441
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:42,439
Notice verse 4, abide in me and I in you, as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself

442
00:33:42,439 --> 00:33:44,879
except it abide in the vine.

443
00:33:44,879 --> 00:33:48,679
No more can ye except ye abide in me.

444
00:33:48,679 --> 00:33:52,319
The principle of abiding is so critical.

445
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:57,679
He says, abide in me and I in you, as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself.

446
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:00,039
We know this.

447
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:05,199
When Holly first got home from down in North Carolina, the first time when she was here

448
00:34:05,199 --> 00:34:10,639
for the scripture assembly, she arrived home and I had some roses waiting for her.

449
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:11,639
Amen?

450
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:14,119
All you husbands take notes and write things down.

451
00:34:14,359 --> 00:34:17,439
I had some roses, I had a card and I had some chocolate.

452
00:34:17,439 --> 00:34:20,519
I tried to cover all those boxes, amen?

453
00:34:20,519 --> 00:34:24,999
And I had it there waiting for her and then she was going to leave to go back to North

454
00:34:24,999 --> 00:34:30,439
Carolina and those roses got put down and guess what happened to those roses?

455
00:34:30,439 --> 00:34:31,439
They died.

456
00:34:31,439 --> 00:34:32,439
Why?

457
00:34:32,439 --> 00:34:34,239
Because they were cut from the vine.

458
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:39,999
I mean, they were beautiful and then they died.

459
00:34:39,999 --> 00:34:45,239
And I noticed that before she got home, I was going to have to deal with those roses

460
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:52,719
and I didn't deal with them on the Monday and then Tuesday I said, I got to take care

461
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:56,599
of that but I had some other things going on and I just kind of left it there and Wednesday

462
00:34:56,599 --> 00:35:01,039
I walked downstairs and I said, what is that smell?

463
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:02,239
You know what those roses started to do?

464
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:03,239
They started to stink.

465
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:08,559
How many of you know roses smell good when they're alive and when they're fresh, right?

466
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:15,639
But they died and they stunk, I had to throw them away.

467
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:18,659
We know this but notice Jesus saying this is us.

468
00:35:18,659 --> 00:35:19,839
He wants us to be fruitful.

469
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:25,499
Joseph says, God hath made me to be fruitful, he hath caused me to be fruitful in the land

470
00:35:25,499 --> 00:35:28,639
of my affliction.

471
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:32,839
I mean in the difficulties, God hath caused me to be fruitful.

472
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:36,119
Notice in verse number five, I am the vine, ye are the branches, he that abideth in me

473
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:38,119
and I in him, the same bringeth forth.

474
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:39,679
What does it say?

475
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:43,439
Much fruit, for without me ye can do nothing.

476
00:35:43,439 --> 00:35:48,799
If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch and is withered.

477
00:35:48,799 --> 00:35:52,099
Men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned.

478
00:35:52,099 --> 00:35:56,359
If ye abide in me and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will and it shall be

479
00:35:56,359 --> 00:35:57,359
done unto you.

480
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:05,479
Notice in verse eight, critical verse of Scripture, herein is my Father glorified that ye bear

481
00:36:05,479 --> 00:36:10,559
much fruit, so shall ye be my disciples.

482
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:14,639
You know God wants us to be fruitful.

483
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:22,319
He said to, when he issued that call to the disciples, they're on the Sea of Galilee,

484
00:36:22,319 --> 00:36:29,399
the call to Peter, he says, follow me and I will make you fishers of men.

485
00:36:29,399 --> 00:36:35,679
When we begin to look at John 15 and thinking about this principle of perspective with Joseph

486
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:41,159
back in Genesis chapter 41, and he says, God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land

487
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:47,319
of my affliction, and I say God has intended for us as his people to be fruitful people.

488
00:36:47,319 --> 00:36:53,639
And when we bear much fruit, see, it's fruit, more fruit, and much fruit, as you study through

489
00:36:53,639 --> 00:36:59,999
John 15, and he says that if you bear much fruit, he says, herein is my Father glorified

490
00:36:59,999 --> 00:37:00,999
that you bear much fruit.

491
00:37:00,999 --> 00:37:03,359
I want God to be glorified.

492
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:08,799
So we've got to abide in him, and we have to allow God to work through our lives.

493
00:37:08,799 --> 00:37:14,119
Listen, we cannot hinder what God is seeking to do in our lives today because we're so

494
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:19,999
focused on the hardships and the difficulties that happened at some time in our past.

495
00:37:20,319 --> 00:37:27,319
Joseph says when Manasseh is born, God has caused me to forget.

496
00:37:27,319 --> 00:37:30,599
God has caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.

497
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:36,919
Listen, this evening, we're going to face some affliction, some difficulty.

498
00:37:36,919 --> 00:37:40,799
You say, pastor, you're telling me I'm facing it right now.

499
00:37:40,799 --> 00:37:41,799
I understand.

500
00:37:41,799 --> 00:37:44,639
Turn to the book of 1 Thessalonians, if you will.

501
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:50,559
I want to just journey real quickly through just a few verses of Scripture, and I hope

502
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:53,439
that this helps us tonight.

503
00:37:53,439 --> 00:37:56,039
We consider the principle of preparation.

504
00:37:56,039 --> 00:37:58,039
God is working to prepare us.

505
00:37:58,039 --> 00:38:02,839
Listen, don't despise the time of preparation.

506
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:09,039
Don't neglect a season of preparation in your life because we need that.

507
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:11,319
God's preparing us for something.

508
00:38:11,319 --> 00:38:13,559
You think about this principle of perspective.

509
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:15,319
Perspective is so important.

510
00:38:15,319 --> 00:38:21,079
In 1 Thessalonians chapter number 3, Paul had already mentioned in chapter 1 how that

511
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:27,239
they came to them with much difficulty as they brought the gospel, and that was what

512
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:28,239
they were dealing with.

513
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:31,639
And if you go back to the book of Acts, you can study and see on that journey all of the

514
00:38:31,639 --> 00:38:32,639
hardship that they faced.

515
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:36,759
But as you come to the third chapter, notice that the Bible says in verse number 3 that

516
00:38:36,759 --> 00:38:40,019
no man should be moved by these afflictions.

517
00:38:40,019 --> 00:38:48,859
Listen, there were some difficulties that the people in Thessalonica were facing.

518
00:38:48,859 --> 00:38:51,019
There were some persecutions that they were dealing with.

519
00:38:51,019 --> 00:38:56,019
There were some afflictions, and Paul says that no man should be moved by these afflictions.

520
00:38:56,019 --> 00:39:01,259
Listen, God is God, and He's on His throne, and He has a purpose, and even in that time

521
00:39:01,259 --> 00:39:05,019
of affliction, God can use you and can cause you to be fruitful.

522
00:39:05,019 --> 00:39:10,019
He says, knowing for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto.

523
00:39:10,019 --> 00:39:14,019
Notice in 2 Thessalonians chapter number 1, and then we're going to come back to 1 Thessalonians

524
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:20,099
because I want you to see the perspective and the opportunity that we can be fruitful

525
00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:23,579
even in the midst of affliction.

526
00:39:23,579 --> 00:39:27,859
In 2 Thessalonians 1 and verse number 4, the Bible says so that we ourselves glory in you

527
00:39:27,859 --> 00:39:33,940
in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations

528
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:36,699
that ye endure.

529
00:39:36,699 --> 00:39:38,539
They were suffering.

530
00:39:38,539 --> 00:39:42,380
The church in Thessalonica, the believers, they were dealing with persecution and all

531
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:46,940
these hardships and things that were taking place, and Paul says that you have patience

532
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:51,859
and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure.

533
00:39:51,859 --> 00:39:55,979
He said in chapter 3 of the first book, he says that no man should be moved by these

534
00:39:55,979 --> 00:39:59,940
afflictions, but I want you to go all the way back to the first chapter of 1 Thessalonians.

535
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:02,300
First Thessalonians.

536
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,240
And I want you to see that a people,

537
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,880
a church that was facing persecution,

538
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,440
affliction, and difficulty,

539
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,120
that God had allowed them to be fruitful

540
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:15,640
even in a season of difficulty and affliction.

541
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,680
The Bible says in verse number seven

542
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,720
of First Thessalonians one,

543
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:22,460
actually back up to verse number four, if you will,

544
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:24,560
knowing, brethren, beloved, your election of God

545
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,040
for our gospel came not unto you in word only,

546
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,840
but also in power and in the Holy Ghost

547
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,440
and in much assurance, as you know what manner of men

548
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,080
we were among you for your sake.

549
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,400
And ye became followers of us and of the Lord,

550
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,980
having received the word in much affliction

551
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:41,400
with joy of the Holy Ghost.

552
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,960
Now notice this, so that ye were in samples

553
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,960
to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia.

554
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:51,240
Verse number eight, for from you sounded out

555
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,600
the word of the Lord, not only in Macedonia and Achaia,

556
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,560
but also in every place your faith to God

557
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,680
were to spread abroad, so that we need not

558
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,000
to speak anything, for they themselves show of us

559
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,280
what manner of entering in we had unto you,

560
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,200
and how you turned to God from idols

561
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:07,060
to serve the living and true God.

562
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,639
The church at Thessalonica had a great testimony.

563
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:14,440
I've said this over the years, there's no perfect church,

564
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,480
but the church at Thessalonica is a model church.

565
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,920
And as you study through the two epistles

566
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,940
to the Thessalonians, you find that they're a model church,

567
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:27,000
and here Paul is saying at this last part

568
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,800
of chapter number one, that even though

569
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,200
they had dealt with affliction,

570
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,760
and even though they had dealt with this persecution,

571
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,520
these persecutions and tribulations,

572
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,880
and all that they were dealing with,

573
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,319
that they were still fruitful, for notice it says,

574
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:39,840
for from you, in verse number eight,

575
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,080
sounded out the word of the Lord,

576
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,520
not only in Macedonia and Achaia,

577
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,360
but also in every place your faith to God

578
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,279
were to spread abroad, so that we need not

579
00:41:47,279 --> 00:41:48,480
to speak anything.

580
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,200
It's almost as if Paul is saying,

581
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,380
we go to share the gospel in a region,

582
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,520
but you've already shared the gospel there.

583
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,880
Now think about that for a moment.

584
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,200
In the midst of their affliction,

585
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,800
and their persecution, and their difficulties,

586
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,880
and all they were dealing with,

587
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:05,000
they were still sending out the truth of the gospel,

588
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,959
they were still doing what they were seeking

589
00:42:06,959 --> 00:42:10,360
to be fruitful, God was using them to be fruitful,

590
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:13,460
even in a time, a season of affliction.

591
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,520
I've heard many testimonies over the years

592
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,779
of people that have dealt with great hardships,

593
00:42:21,779 --> 00:42:25,500
be it physical or otherwise,

594
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,900
and they share testimonies of,

595
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:31,320
in that season of great difficulty and of affliction,

596
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,339
how God used them to be able to share the gospel

597
00:42:33,339 --> 00:42:36,339
with someone, and they got saved.

598
00:42:36,339 --> 00:42:39,660
That's amazing to me, that God would work in that manner.

599
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:43,059
See, this evening, we think about

600
00:42:43,059 --> 00:42:46,500
the principle of preparation,

601
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,860
it's important that we understand,

602
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:50,419
and we go through that season of preparation,

603
00:42:51,059 --> 00:42:53,059
for God has a purpose and a plan for us.

604
00:42:54,619 --> 00:42:57,820
And when he's ready to open that door,

605
00:42:57,820 --> 00:43:00,059
did we get all the preparation we were supposed to get?

606
00:43:00,059 --> 00:43:02,760
Are we ready to do what God has for us to do?

607
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:05,619
See, because when the opportunity arises,

608
00:43:05,619 --> 00:43:08,979
that's not time to prepare, that's time to do.

609
00:43:08,979 --> 00:43:10,020
Does that make sense?

610
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:13,979
But then the principle of perspective,

611
00:43:13,979 --> 00:43:15,740
what do we focus on?

612
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:18,040
Do we focus on how bad things are?

613
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:19,540
How terrible, how we were wronged,

614
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:20,940
and how this happened and that happened,

615
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:24,900
and I just can't imagine this person didn't do this,

616
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:26,339
or this person didn't say hi to me,

617
00:43:26,339 --> 00:43:29,300
and this person, I mean, we get mad about silly things.

618
00:43:30,139 --> 00:43:32,100
Seriously, honestly.

619
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:36,979
Somebody came to me about five weeks ago and said,

620
00:43:36,979 --> 00:43:38,460
Pastor, are you mad at me?

621
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:40,580
I said, no, why would I be mad at you?

622
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:43,139
Well, you didn't say hi to me last week.

623
00:43:43,139 --> 00:43:44,180
I'm very sorry.

624
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:49,220
And it was a great conversation, everything was resolved.

625
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:50,740
But what I'm saying is that,

626
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:53,139
it wasn't that I didn't say hi because I was mad,

627
00:43:53,139 --> 00:43:54,619
we had a problem with the sound thing,

628
00:43:54,619 --> 00:43:56,779
my lapel wasn't working, and I was back there

629
00:43:56,779 --> 00:43:58,020
trying to get things fixed up,

630
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:00,260
and working with whatever was going on,

631
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:04,339
and I think it wasn't my lapel, it was my iPad.

632
00:44:04,339 --> 00:44:06,900
Because Joseph says, you just need to get a new one.

633
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:09,740
But the reality is that sometimes the devil

634
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:12,540
can use super little things to just mess us up.

635
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:14,580
Seriously.

636
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:17,580
And what's our perspective?

637
00:44:18,339 --> 00:44:21,660
Listen, Joseph had a whole lot of bad things.

638
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:24,220
He said, God, he calls me to forget.

639
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:28,739
And therefore, God's called me to be fruitful

640
00:44:28,739 --> 00:44:30,059
in the land of affliction.

641
00:44:31,059 --> 00:44:32,540
See, sometimes we're in the land of affliction

642
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:35,779
when it's a time of great distress and just difficulty,

643
00:44:35,779 --> 00:44:38,299
and we think that means that we have a pass

644
00:44:38,299 --> 00:44:39,660
to just kind of do nothing.

645
00:44:40,739 --> 00:44:42,380
Well, I got all this stuff going on,

646
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:46,899
and God understands, and it's just,

647
00:44:46,899 --> 00:44:49,580
woe is me, pity party.

648
00:44:51,059 --> 00:44:54,179
Joseph said, God, let me be fruitful.

649
00:44:55,339 --> 00:44:57,019
God hath called me to be fruitful

650
00:44:57,899 --> 00:44:59,580
in the land of my affliction.

651
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:03,779
I don't know tonight what everyone is dealing with,

652
00:45:03,779 --> 00:45:07,179
but I know we have a God who if we keep our attention

653
00:45:07,179 --> 00:45:09,820
and our perspective on him,

654
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:13,140
that even in the midst of difficulty and affliction,

655
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:15,459
he can cause us to be fruitful.

656
00:45:15,459 --> 00:45:17,820
He can use us for his honor and for his glory.

657
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:23,700
There's a world that was directly impacted

658
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:30,140
because of Joseph's faithfulness and fruitfulness.

659
00:45:31,779 --> 00:45:34,019
People's lives were spared

660
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:38,459
because there was a great famine that was coming,

661
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:43,500
and because Joseph understood the preparation,

662
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:45,940
Joseph had a right perspective.

663
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:50,299
When the opportunity came, God used him.

664
00:45:50,299 --> 00:45:52,059
God calls me to be fruitful.

665
00:45:52,059 --> 00:45:54,860
Tonight, I hope that God would help us

666
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:58,940
to have that perspective that Joseph had,

667
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:00,739
that we'd understand the preparation

668
00:46:00,739 --> 00:46:02,420
that God is taking us through.

669
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:03,260
Let's pray.

670
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:04,580
Father, we love you.

671
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:06,179
We thank you for loving us.

672
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:09,100
We thank you that you're God,

673
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,779
and though at times we don't understand

674
00:46:10,779 --> 00:46:12,820
all that's taking place, we can trust you.

675
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:14,140
We can rest in you.

676
00:46:15,019 --> 00:46:19,700
God, help us to understand the seasons of preparation

677
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:22,220
that you would guide and lead us through,

678
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:24,820
and I pray that in those moments of preparation

679
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:28,380
that you would help us to get all

680
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:29,899
that we're supposed to get,

681
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:33,540
that we would be prepared for the opportunities

682
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:35,100
that you present us with.

683
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:41,739
I think about this perspective of Joseph

684
00:46:41,739 --> 00:46:44,540
and the principle that we see here,

685
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:47,339
the naming of his two sons,

686
00:46:47,339 --> 00:46:49,580
and God, I pray that you'd help us to look to Jesus,

687
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:51,739
the author and finisher of our faith,

688
00:46:51,739 --> 00:46:53,459
help us to have an eternal perspective,

689
00:46:53,459 --> 00:46:55,500
not a temporal perspective,

690
00:46:55,500 --> 00:47:00,500
help us to not focus upon those things that are hurtful,

691
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:04,700
but God, help us to focus on you

692
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:08,980
and how you can cause us to be fruitful,

693
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:10,779
even in the land of affliction.

694
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:13,860
I pray that tonight you would move and work

695
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:16,580
in hearts and lives as only you can.

696
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:19,739
I pray, Lord, that we would not only see

697
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:23,100
the life of Joseph recorded for us,

698
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:25,739
but we would apply truth in our lives

699
00:47:25,739 --> 00:47:29,179
that would cause us to be used in like manner.

700
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:30,619
We give you the glory for all that you'll do,

701
00:47:30,619 --> 00:47:32,380
for it's in Christ's name we pray.
