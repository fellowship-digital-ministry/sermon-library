WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.559
41 this evening, Genesis chapter 41. We'll be looking at verses 44 through 53

00:00:05.559 --> 00:00:09.760
and then next Sunday evening we'll finish up Genesis chapter number 41.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.920
It's kind of interesting if you think about Genesis 41 to this point in our

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:14.600
study

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.360
as we enter into the 44th verse tonight. Up to this point Joseph

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.040
has been released from prison. Remember we start at the passage of Scripture and

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.280
he's still in prison. Pharaoh had a dream

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.680
no one could interpret the dream and the butler remembers, oh yeah

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.840
I was in prison you were angry with me and there was a man there

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.880
and he was able to interpret my dream and the baker's dream and they both came

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:36.959
to pass just as

00:00:36.959 --> 00:00:40.919
he said they would and we find that Pharaoh sent and

00:00:40.919 --> 00:00:44.720
called for Joseph with haste and Joseph is released from prison.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.720
Joseph tells Pharaoh the dream. Not only does Joseph tell Pharaoh the dream

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.959
but remember he provides counsel to Pharaoh

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:57.040
with regard to what has to happen really over the next 14 years.

00:00:57.319 --> 00:01:02.520
The dream that Pharaoh had really was God revealing to Pharaoh

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.360
what was going to happen in Egypt over the next 14 years.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.400
We find that the Bible spoke of God

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.279
doing this work and that it would come to pass soon. It would shortly

00:01:13.279 --> 00:01:17.800
be brought to pass according to verse number 32 and we find that he, Joseph,

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.239
after giving the interpretation and the counsel to Pharaoh

00:01:22.239 --> 00:01:25.959
that he is promoted to second in command over all of

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:30.199
Egypt. Wow, what a chapter. I mean so many amazing

00:01:30.199 --> 00:01:34.000
things that take place in such a short period of time

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.239
to begin Genesis chapter 41. It reminds me

00:01:37.239 --> 00:01:40.879
of God's timing and God's timing is amazing

00:01:40.879 --> 00:01:45.760
and when God is ready, when God's time is right

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.239
and he brings it to pass and what a blessing. There are times in which we

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:51.720
could be waiting and we're

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.639
waiting and we're waiting and it seems like what's going on

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.440
but when God is, when things are taking place in God's timing

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.160
it's perfect and it happens just as he wants it to happen.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.960
We find this evening as we look at our text of scripture in verses 44 through 53

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:15.080
that God will provide us really an overview of the first seven years

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.199
of the famine. Of course we know after the first seven years or those seven

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:21.720
years of famine, we know, excuse me, the seven years of plenty,

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.679
we know that those seven years of plenty would be followed

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:28.960
by seven years of famine and so these few verses of scripture

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.080
cover seven years of time,

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.199
the seven years of plenty. Now it's interesting because up to verse number

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.919
43

00:02:36.919 --> 00:02:40.520
all of those events that I just told you happened very quickly

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.800
and here we find in just a handful of verses that God

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.080
is going to give us an overview of those seven years of plenty

00:02:48.279 --> 00:02:52.639
and in doing so God gives us some information with regard to Joseph

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:56.080
and what has been taking place. Joseph,

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.600
in this text of scripture, we find that he is given

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.800
an Egyptian name, he's also given an Egyptian bride

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.160
and God blesses, he has two children. Notice in verse number 44

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.360
the Bible says, and Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.839
without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.240
in all the land of Egypt. And Pharaoh called Joseph's name

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.839
Zaphnath-Paneah and he gave him to wife Asenath,

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:28.279
the daughter of Potipharah, priest of On

00:03:28.279 --> 00:03:31.800
and Joseph went out over all the land

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.919
of Egypt. The Bible tells us in verse 46 that Joseph was 30 years old when he

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:37.600
stood before Pharaoh, king of Egypt

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.800
and Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh and went throughout all

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.759
the land of Egypt. If you draw your attention down to verse number 52

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:49.520
the Bible says the name of the second called he Ephraim, this is the second child

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.039
and notice what it says, for God hath caused me to be fruitful

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:57.559
in the land of my affliction. I've titled the message this evening from that verse

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:58.639
of scripture there

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:02.360
in verse number 52, fruitful in the land

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.399
of affliction. Fruitful in the land of affliction. Many times when we think

00:04:06.399 --> 00:04:09.800
about the land of affliction we do not think of it as being a place that would

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.919
produce fruit, that would be a fruitful place. In fact,

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.480
we think about the land of affliction or times of affliction in your life, in my

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.040
life,

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.239
we don't think of them in very pleasant terms and an idea of

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.519
looking at this passage of scripture, God helps us to learn

00:04:25.519 --> 00:04:29.200
some important truths. As I begin to look at this passage

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.760
let me just say this by way of introduction, the name that Joseph

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.799
called, or that Pharaoh gives Joseph, the Egyptian name Zaphnath-Paneah,

00:04:39.399 --> 00:04:44.119
the exact meaning is unclear and I'll admit that you can look at a number of

00:04:44.119 --> 00:04:46.480
different commentaries and theologians. In fact,

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.480
the meaning of Joseph's

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.799
Egyptian name has been debated amongst theologians and amongst

00:04:53.799 --> 00:04:59.320
Jewish rabbis for centuries, but it seems as if as you look at this and you

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.359
look at some things

00:05:00.359 --> 00:05:05.320
that this name Zaphnath-Paneah, and it really makes sense when you think about

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.480
this meaning,

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.119
and again there's a lot of debate and some have different opinions as to what

00:05:10.119 --> 00:05:10.720
it means,

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.839
but it seems that it carries this meaning, God speaks

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:20.839
and he lives. Now it could be God speaks and he giveth life,

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:25.160
but that idea, and I want you to think about that just for a moment,

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.079
as Pharaoh, a polytheistic,

00:05:29.079 --> 00:05:34.600
idolatrous individual that he himself was looked at as being some level of

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.600
deity

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:40.359
by the people of Egypt, and yet as he stands there he has no

00:05:40.359 --> 00:05:44.320
way of having this dream interpreted, he is troubled,

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.559
and Joseph comes in and Joseph says, remember,

00:05:47.559 --> 00:05:51.359
he says, it is not in me, God shall give Pharaoh

00:05:51.359 --> 00:05:55.799
an answer of peace, and when God uses Joseph

00:05:55.799 --> 00:06:00.920
to share with Pharaoh the interpretation of the dream and to give him counsel,

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.160
Pharaoh could have picked any Egyptian name

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:09.679
to give Joseph, but it seems as if there's a consensus

00:06:09.679 --> 00:06:13.720
with this meeting that God speaks

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.119
and he lives. Isn't that precious?

00:06:17.119 --> 00:06:20.320
To think about the influence and impact

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:25.399
that Joseph could have in the life of Pharaoh because he stood there with

00:06:25.399 --> 00:06:26.519
boldness

00:06:26.519 --> 00:06:31.600
and he stood there in humility, I believe that his only concern, I mentioned this a

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:32.679
couple of weeks ago,

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:37.440
his only concern was for the glory of God, and when you and I are only concerned

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.640
for the glory of God, it's amazing what God can do

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:45.839
in and through our lives. As we look at the text of Scripture tonight, we begin

00:06:45.839 --> 00:06:46.119
to

00:06:46.119 --> 00:06:50.920
look at these verses of Scripture, I believe that there are two principles

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:51.799
that God

00:06:51.799 --> 00:06:55.959
really brings into focus for us as you read through the verses,

00:06:55.959 --> 00:06:59.200
and I hope tonight that we can consider these two principles

00:06:59.399 --> 00:07:02.679
and seek to make application in our lives. Number one,

00:07:02.679 --> 00:07:05.720
I believe that we see in this passage of Scripture

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:10.000
the principle of preparation, the principle of preparation.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.040
Why do I say that? Well, we read verses 44 and 45 already

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:17.880
and we find that Joseph is elevated to this position. The Bible tells us in

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.200
verse number 46,

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:23.200
I read it a moment ago, but notice it says, and Joseph was 30 years old

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:27.040
when he stood before Pharaoh, king of Egypt. It's interesting to me that in

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:31.200
this particular age, being 30 years old, he is elevated to a position of great

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.040
power,

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:36.760
but also a great responsibility. I want you to think about the power that he has.

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.880
Only Pharaoh would have more power

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:42.320
over all the land of Egypt, but then I want you to think about the

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.040
responsibility

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:49.799
that would be entrusted to Joseph. I mean, a great deal of responsibility

00:07:49.799 --> 00:07:54.000
is given to Joseph in placing him in this particular

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.399
position. I believe that as we look at this portion of Scripture, we begin to see

00:07:58.399 --> 00:08:00.119
what's happening. Notice the Bible says

00:08:00.119 --> 00:08:04.200
that Joseph, at the end of verse number 46, he went out from the presence of Pharaoh

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:08.600
and went throughout all the land of Egypt. The Bible says in verse 47, in the

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:09.200
seven

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:12.839
plenteous years, the earth brought forth by

00:08:12.839 --> 00:08:17.839
handfuls. Now this is aligned with what Joseph said would happen when Joseph

00:08:17.839 --> 00:08:19.279
gives the interpretation.

00:08:19.279 --> 00:08:23.000
He tells Pharaoh that there would be seven years of plenty

00:08:23.079 --> 00:08:26.679
and we find that it's exactly what's taking place. The Bible says that during

00:08:26.679 --> 00:08:27.760
those plenteous years,

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.839
the earth brought forth by handfuls.

00:08:30.839 --> 00:08:34.000
Notice in verse 48, and he gathered up

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.719
all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt,

00:08:38.719 --> 00:08:41.760
and laid up the food in the cities, the food of the field,

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:44.799
which was round about every city, laid he

00:08:44.799 --> 00:08:49.799
up in the same. And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea very much until

00:08:49.799 --> 00:08:50.559
he left

00:08:50.559 --> 00:08:54.320
numbering, for it was without number.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:58.479
Do you see the responsibility of this position that Joseph has?

00:08:58.479 --> 00:09:02.080
If we begin to think about the responsibility, no doubt having a

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.559
position like this

00:09:03.559 --> 00:09:07.320
and having the power, but also having the responsibility

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:10.440
to gather up during these years of plenty,

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:14.719
no doubt there would be some that would not be happy with Joseph with regard to

00:09:14.719 --> 00:09:18.039
that which he was doing. There would be certainly

00:09:18.039 --> 00:09:21.239
a number of people that he would have to

00:09:21.239 --> 00:09:26.080
delegate responsibility to, that he would have responsibility entrusted to

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:26.559
them.

00:09:26.559 --> 00:09:30.000
He had a great deal of responsibility laid

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.880
upon his shoulders, but I would submit to you this evening that God was

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.440
preparing Joseph for this very moment

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:40.719
for years. The principle of preparation.

00:09:40.719 --> 00:09:45.200
See, in Genesis chapter 37, we are first introduced to Joseph

00:09:45.239 --> 00:09:49.760
when he is 17 years old. We don't know, we really don't know anything biblically

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:50.479
scriptural

00:09:50.479 --> 00:09:55.599
about Joseph's life prior to that event in Genesis 37 when he comes on the scene

00:09:55.599 --> 00:09:56.760
as a 17-year-old,

00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:00.000
but I want you to think about Joseph when he first comes on the scene at 17

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.840
years old, it seems as if Joseph already at that point in his life had proven to

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:11.039
be both faithful and trustworthy. Joseph was in a position, remember the Bible

00:10:11.039 --> 00:10:16.399
tells us that he brought back the evil report of his brothers. He understood the

00:10:16.399 --> 00:10:21.559
difference between right and wrong, good and evil. Oh today we have people that

00:10:21.559 --> 00:10:27.479
are much older than 17 that seem to not have any idea of morality and the

00:10:27.479 --> 00:10:32.479
difference between right and wrong, good and evil. And we find that Joseph, he

00:10:32.479 --> 00:10:37.279
observing their behavior, he knew of their evil report or their evil behavior

00:10:37.279 --> 00:10:42.479
and he brought back that evil report. So as his brothers depart, we find that it's

00:10:42.479 --> 00:10:47.159
Joseph who is given the responsibility to go see what your brothers are doing.

00:10:47.159 --> 00:10:51.360
Bring me word again. And we find that this is the responsibility that is

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:55.479
entrusted to him and at that point in his life we find that Joseph is

00:10:55.479 --> 00:11:01.400
immediately obedient to what his father had instructed him to do. His dad calls

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:04.319
him and says here son here's what I want you to do. Now we already know that his

00:11:04.319 --> 00:11:08.000
brothers didn't like him. His brothers were upset because of the dreams and all

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.279
that had taken place and his brothers are are not kind towards him. They could

00:11:12.279 --> 00:11:18.400
not speak kindly to him and we find that here he goes out to find his brothers to

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:22.639
fulfill the responsibility that had been given to him from his father and it's

00:11:22.639 --> 00:11:28.279
there where he's taken and put into a pit and eventually sold into slavery. We

00:11:28.279 --> 00:11:35.800
find that he comes to Egypt and he's there in Egypt, 17 years old, about 17. We

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:38.680
find that's where we're introduced to him in Genesis 37. It seems as if all those

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:42.680
events take place pretty quickly and we come to Genesis chapter 39 and we find

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:48.360
that he's bought by one named Potiphar. And of course we find that Joseph

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:52.199
immediately when he comes into the place of being in Potiphar's house, he's

00:11:52.199 --> 00:11:55.480
elevated to a position of responsibility and he has the

00:11:55.480 --> 00:12:02.879
responsibility to take care of, to be a minister there in the house of Potiphar

00:12:02.879 --> 00:12:11.240
to be a steward. God's preparing Joseph. God's preparing him and we find that

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:15.399
Joseph after a period of time being the steward in Potiphar's house, we know that

00:12:15.399 --> 00:12:19.399
he's lied about and he's falsely accused and he finds himself in prison and guess

00:12:19.399 --> 00:12:24.320
what God's doing in Joseph's life in prison? He's preparing him. He's preparing

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:30.440
him. So nearly 13 years, about 13 years have passed since Joseph has been in

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:37.279
Egypt and all along the way God is preparing Joseph. God does a work of

00:12:37.279 --> 00:12:43.600
preparation in his servants. By the way I'm thankful for the work of preparation.

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:48.880
I'm thankful for how God will lead and work in individuals lives and God has

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:54.720
particular purposes and wills for our lives and he desires that he would

00:12:54.720 --> 00:13:00.399
prepare us for the task that he has for us to do. The problem is how do we deal

00:13:00.399 --> 00:13:06.399
with the time of preparation? How do we handle that season of preparation when

00:13:06.399 --> 00:13:11.839
God is shaping us and molding us and preparing us? Are we faithful? Are we

00:13:11.839 --> 00:13:16.279
obedient to what God has called us to do so that we're learning what we're

00:13:16.279 --> 00:13:20.600
supposed to learn? Because that principle of preparation is so important

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:24.800
in our lives, God is preparing us. I wonder tonight what is God preparing us

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:31.000
for? God has a plan and a purpose for you and your life and there are times in

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.600
which we have that opportunity even as Joseph did to go through a period of

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:42.759
preparation. And as Joseph would be entrusted with this great position of

00:13:42.759 --> 00:13:47.320
not only power but great responsibility, we find that God had been preparing him

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:51.880
all along the way. Turn to the New Testament, if you will, the book of Luke. I

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:55.080
want to hold your place there in Genesis 41, but I want to show you two verses.

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:58.039
You're familiar with the verses no doubt in the book of Luke, but I want you to

00:13:58.039 --> 00:14:01.759
look at Luke 16 and then we'll look at a verse over in Luke 19. And I want you to

00:14:01.759 --> 00:14:05.820
consider with me the time, the principle that we see here of preparation. I am

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:10.039
thankful that through the the overview that I just provided you with all along

00:14:10.039 --> 00:14:16.320
the way in Joseph's life, we find that he was faithful. And because he was

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:22.399
faithful, God was molding him and God was shaping him and he was in a position

00:14:22.399 --> 00:14:26.640
that when Pharaoh says, okay Joseph, you're the one, you're the one that's

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:31.799
going to be in this position, that Joseph was ready for the task that was given to

00:14:31.799 --> 00:14:36.000
him. Notice in Luke chapter 16 and verse number 10, the Bible says, he that is

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:43.839
faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much. And he that is

00:14:43.839 --> 00:14:52.079
unjust in the least is unjust also in much. You know, a good indicator of the

00:14:52.079 --> 00:14:56.079
faithfulness of individuals is how do they handle the little things that are

00:14:56.079 --> 00:15:00.279
entrusted to them. The things that people might say, well that's really not that

00:15:00.279 --> 00:15:05.500
big of a deal, but no, it is a big deal. And we learn to be faithful in the

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:11.380
little things and God will entrust us with bigger things. God will give us that

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:15.820
responsibility. Why? Because he's preparing us even through those times.

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:20.579
Joseph finds himself in Potiphar's house. What am I doing here? Why have I

00:15:20.579 --> 00:15:24.700
been sold here? And God's preparing him and he's faithful and God is with him

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:29.660
and he's doing what he's supposed to be doing and he's the steward and he's so

00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:36.980
able to do what God has given him to do that even the Potiphar, the ruler of the

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:41.899
home, he doesn't even know what's going on. He didn't trust at all to Joseph, the

00:15:41.899 --> 00:15:47.380
prison guard. He does the same thing. Joseph is faithful in that which is

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:53.100
least and God gives him great responsibility. Notice in Luke chapter

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:59.899
19 and verse number 17. Luke 19 and verse number 17, this is a passage, we

00:15:59.899 --> 00:16:04.459
could really look at the entirety of it from verse 11 down through verse 27 of

00:16:04.459 --> 00:16:08.859
the truth of being faithful, but I want to just draw your attention to verse 17

00:16:08.859 --> 00:16:12.140
and we'll get back over to the book of Genesis. Notice it says here,

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:16.619
and he said unto him, well thou good servant, because thou hast been faithful

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:26.140
in very little, have thou authority over ten cities. Faithful over little. You

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:29.940
know what God's doing when he entrusts us with those little things? He's

00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:35.459
preparing us. He's preparing us. And I don't know exactly what he's preparing

00:16:35.459 --> 00:16:39.459
each and every one of us for, but it's very interesting how God works in the

00:16:39.459 --> 00:16:44.660
season of preparation. I'll use a personal illustration and when I was

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:47.339
working in the corporate world, I remember working in the corporate world

00:16:47.339 --> 00:16:50.739
for a number of years and I had studied. I knew that God called me to the

00:16:50.739 --> 00:16:54.980
ministry and I knew that that's what God wanted me to do. I was working in our

00:16:54.980 --> 00:17:00.100
church doing all that the pastor would allow me to do with regard to ministry

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:05.019
and opportunities and things were going well there, but I knew God had called me

00:17:05.019 --> 00:17:10.980
to pastor and I was working in the corporate world and honestly things were

00:17:11.019 --> 00:17:14.899
going absolutely wonderful from a corporate perspective with regard to

00:17:14.899 --> 00:17:18.500
promotions and all of those types of things, but I knew that's not where God

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:24.660
had me forever. I knew that God called me to the ministry. And yet during that time,

00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:30.019
because of a principle that was taught to me by a spiritual mentor of

00:17:30.019 --> 00:17:35.179
understanding that God is able to prepare us through every season of life,

00:17:35.179 --> 00:17:41.500
that I determined that even while I was there, I was going to seek to be the best

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:46.540
that I could be for the Lord and learn what I could learn so that God could use

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:53.820
that time for whatever the future would be. And it's amazing to me, and I give all

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:58.619
the glory to God, it's amazing to me on the opportunities that the Lord allowed

00:17:58.619 --> 00:18:05.019
me to have in the corporate world that have been such a blessing and a help

00:18:05.019 --> 00:18:09.980
when it comes to pastoring. Things that they don't teach you in Bible college,

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:13.179
things that they don't teach you in seminary, things that you don't have any

00:18:13.179 --> 00:18:18.220
classes on certain things, and the opportunity that I had in that

00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:25.299
particular season of life in a time of preparation. And because of the influence

00:18:25.299 --> 00:18:30.420
in my life that was given to me that, hey, I know that this is not where you're

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:34.099
going to be forever, I know that you believe God's called you to pastor, but

00:18:34.179 --> 00:18:40.020
in this place, learn what God has for you to learn. It's a season of preparation.

00:18:40.739 --> 00:18:46.580
And how I thank God for how he prepared and the things that he taught me.

00:18:47.619 --> 00:18:53.539
As we look in the book of Genesis in chapter 41, I believe that here we see a principle

00:18:53.539 --> 00:18:59.299
of preparation that Joseph, now at 30 years old, he is entrusted with this great position

00:18:59.299 --> 00:19:06.179
and he has great responsibility, he has great power, but God had been preparing him all along.

00:19:06.179 --> 00:19:09.780
It's not as if Joseph just, bam, you're going to be second in command. No, there was

00:19:11.219 --> 00:19:18.340
he was 17 when he first there is introduced to us in Genesis 37. So 13 years of preparation

00:19:18.979 --> 00:19:24.900
before he goes to the place, the position that we read of him having here. By the way,

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:29.380
I think that if Joseph could stand here and give testimony, he'd be able to tell us that

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:37.059
through those 13 years, God was preparing him for the task that was at hand. And what a blessing.

00:19:37.059 --> 00:19:41.299
I see another principle in our text of scripture, not only a principle of preparation,

00:19:41.299 --> 00:19:47.059
but I see the principle of perspective. Perspective. You know, everyone has a different

00:19:47.059 --> 00:19:51.940
perspective in life. Everyone has a different perspective when it comes to circumstances

00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:57.299
and events that take place in our lives, even in the lives of others. And we begin to

00:19:57.299 --> 00:19:59.940
look here and we find even as I've mentioned for the time...

00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:04.660
title of the message this evening, Fruitful in the Land of Affliction, we find that here

00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:10.020
God gives us some glimpse with regard to the principle of perspective. I believe that it's

00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:14.840
revealed to us Joseph, as I mentioned by way of introduction, had been given an Egyptian

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:20.140
name and he had been given an Egyptian bride, yet when his two sons are born he gives them

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:28.100
Hebrew names. And in giving them Hebrew names and understanding the meaning of the names,

00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:35.580
we find that it helps us to be able to learn about Joseph's perspective. What is his perspective

00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:39.860
with all that he's dealt with, with all that he's endured? The Bible tells us in verse

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:46.180
number 50, and unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came. So in those

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:52.200
first seven years of plenty, we find that Joseph was blessed by the Lord to have two

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:58.460
sons, it says, which Asenath, the daughter of Potipharah, priest of On, bear unto him.

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:03.760
And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh. Notice what he says when we see

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:10.800
the firstborn that is named here, Manasseh, the name means forgetfulness. It means to

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:15.720
forget. Now it doesn't mean to forget like you forgot what was on your grocery list.

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:19.279
Alright, how many of you ever forget what's on your grocery list? You understand what

00:21:19.279 --> 00:21:23.380
I'm saying? And we got so many tools that help us to remember things and yet we seem

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:27.639
to forget things. And I have the opposite problem with a grocery list. I add things

00:21:27.639 --> 00:21:31.360
to it. I go down the cookie aisle and I'm like, oh yeah, we need those cookies and we

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:35.980
need ice cream. And Holly says that wasn't on the list, but it just got in the cart somehow,

00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:41.120
you understand. But that's not what it means when we're talking about forgetfulness. It's

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:47.279
this purpose of forgetting, this intentional forgetting something. Notice what he says,

00:21:47.279 --> 00:21:57.080
For God, said he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house. Now I

00:21:57.080 --> 00:22:01.840
don't believe that he's meaning all of the positive things and the good things because

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:06.080
obviously there's some good things that he learned. He learned about Jehovah God. We

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:10.960
find that even in giving his testimony and standing before Pharaoh and standing before

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:16.919
his brothers as we go through the remainder of Genesis, we find that he continues to give

00:22:16.919 --> 00:22:24.440
glory to God. He did not forget the God of his father. He did not forget those truths

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:31.160
that he was given. But I want you to understand that Joseph is saying that this idea of forgetfulness,

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:34.320
that God made me to forget all my toil and my father's house. You know there were a lot

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:45.680
of bad things that happened to Joseph. Right? We've studied them. Hated by your brothers.

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:51.080
I mean to the point where they can't even speak kindly to you. This is a hatred at a

00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:55.880
whole nother level. We think about the selling into slavery. I mean they were going to kill

00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:59.460
him and then they decided no let's not kill him because we can actually get some money

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:04.520
for him so why don't we sell him into slavery. And even as they had determined that they're

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:08.919
going to put him in that pit so they could kill him, they're sitting there eating. I

00:23:08.919 --> 00:23:13.639
mean they have no care or concern whatsoever. And here's the thought tonight when we think

00:23:13.639 --> 00:23:20.839
about the principle of perspective. The negatives that are in our past, they must not rob us

00:23:20.839 --> 00:23:26.040
of our opportunity for today. See there are some negatives in each of our lives. There

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:30.279
are some negatives in Joseph's life. There were some things that happened to him that

00:23:30.279 --> 00:23:34.880
if he determined that that was going to be the focus of his attention, if every day of

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:39.400
his life he was going to just focus upon the fact that my brothers did me wrong, that my

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:44.680
brothers did this and my brothers did that and this is not fair and this is not right,

00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:51.800
Joseph would not be second in command. He had to forget that stuff because those negatives

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:58.680
would hinder Joseph from being able to do what God had for him to do. I want you to

00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:01.320
think about the principle. Turn to the book of Philippians if you will. Again hold your

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:05.279
spot here in Genesis but turn to the book of Philippians and I want you to look at Philippians

00:24:05.279 --> 00:24:10.559
chapter number 3. I want you to think about what Paul says in this portion of scripture

00:24:10.559 --> 00:24:14.720
and there's so much rich truth in Philippians chapter number 3. I wish we could study all

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:20.220
of it this evening but I want to draw your attention to some things that Paul says with

00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:26.279
regard to even what we find here in the life of Joseph in Genesis chapter 41 when he names

00:24:26.279 --> 00:24:33.760
his firstborn Manasseh, the idea of forgetfulness. Notice that Paul says this in verse number

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:37.760
10, I'll start there, that I may know him and the power of his resurrection, the fellowship

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:43.959
of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death. So he reveals to us his desire

00:24:43.959 --> 00:24:49.200
to know the Lord in a very intimate way, not just knowing about God but knowing him personally

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:54.799
and intimately. If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead, not as

00:24:54.799 --> 00:25:00.320
though I had already attained, either were already perfect, but I follow after, if then

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:06.320
I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus. And then notice

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:14.119
verse 13, brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended. But this one thing I do,

00:25:14.119 --> 00:25:20.640
forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:27.320
are before, I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:31.600
Jesus. You know, there are a lot of people today that are crippled because of the things

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:40.559
that happened to them in the past. They're crippled, figuratively speaking, because of

00:25:40.559 --> 00:25:45.959
the things that happened to them in the past. They've not forgotten them. They're holding

00:25:45.959 --> 00:25:53.360
on to them. They're bothered by them. The Bible teaches in the book of Hebrews the danger

00:25:53.360 --> 00:26:00.019
of a root of bitterness. You know what often happens when we cannot forget those negatives

00:26:00.019 --> 00:26:11.059
in the past is we get bitter. We get bitter. And bitterness will absolutely destroy you.

00:26:11.059 --> 00:26:17.899
It will destroy you. Someone said bitterness will destroy the vessel in which it's stored

00:26:17.899 --> 00:26:27.899
more than the vessel in which it's poured. Bitterness will destroy you. Joseph could

00:26:27.899 --> 00:26:34.459
have been bitter over the things that happened in his life, over the treatment that he experienced.

00:26:34.459 --> 00:26:43.540
I've only focused on his brothers, but think about Mrs. Potiphar as she lied and had him

00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:51.299
imprisoned. I mean, you think about Joseph coming into Egypt and all the events that

00:26:51.299 --> 00:26:54.940
happened to lead him there. And then he's in the house of Potiphar. And I mean, even

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:59.700
though he's purchased as a slave, I mean, he's pretty successful and he's become the

00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:03.299
steward of the house and things are going well. But then Mrs. Potiphar lies about him

00:27:03.299 --> 00:27:08.980
and he finds himself in prison. Man, there's some things that he could get bitter about.

00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:17.019
Listen, be careful about bitterness. Many people today are crippled because of things

00:27:17.019 --> 00:27:22.559
that happened in their past. They just can't get over them. Can I say this? Be careful

00:27:22.559 --> 00:27:32.339
about psychologists and psychiatrists. I'm not either one. Anytime I'm asked to give

00:27:32.339 --> 00:27:38.959
counsel, I seek to give biblical counsel and I do it often. However, I would say this.

00:27:38.959 --> 00:27:46.119
Sometimes they just want to dig up things in the past and never really resolve them.

00:27:46.119 --> 00:27:51.040
Never really resolve them. And it can become very dangerous. And what I'm saying to you

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:54.679
this evening is that when we look at this principle of perspective, where's your focus

00:27:54.679 --> 00:27:59.959
tonight? What are we focused on? If we just want to focus on the hurt and the harm and

00:27:59.959 --> 00:28:05.519
the bad things that happened to us in our past, it will cripple you from doing today

00:28:05.679 --> 00:28:12.399
what God has for you to do today. We can't live in the past. We can't change the past.

00:28:12.399 --> 00:28:16.519
It doesn't matter how angry we are. It doesn't matter how bitter we are about the things

00:28:16.519 --> 00:28:23.519
that happened to us. We cannot change them. Amen? You can't. You can't change them.

00:28:23.519 --> 00:28:33.840
As we see the firstborn son, Joseph called his name Manasseh. Forgetfulness. For God

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:41.080
said he hath made me forget all my toil and all my father's house. I believe it's because

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:46.940
of the name of the firstborn that we're able to read of the secondborn. I believe it's

00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:50.720
because of the perspective that I'm going to forget those things, the negatives, and

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:57.159
I'm not going to let those hinder me from doing what God has for me. I find that in

00:28:57.159 --> 00:29:03.679
the 52nd verse we're told about the secondborn and it says here that he, the name of the

00:29:03.679 --> 00:29:15.640
second, called he Ephraim. For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.

00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:24.119
I mean, what a perspective that Joseph has. Listen, he calls it what it is. It's a land

00:29:24.119 --> 00:29:29.280
of affliction. We don't have to sugarcoat things. We can call them what they are, but

00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:33.440
the reality is that even in the midst of what looks like and as we would look at this

00:29:33.479 --> 00:29:37.880
portion of scripture and look at all of the events in the life of Joseph, we could say

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:42.679
yeah that's a land of affliction, but he says, but God made me to be fruitful. And so Ephraim

00:29:42.679 --> 00:29:48.280
means fruitfulness. It means fruitfulness. God hath caused him to be fruitful in the

00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:52.080
land of his affliction. And I want you to think about being fruitful. God has called

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:58.679
us to be fruitful. Has he not? Turn to the book of John, if you will, John chapter number

00:29:58.679 --> 00:30:00.039
15, and I want you to look.

00:30:00.039 --> 00:30:05.879
here at the truth of this idea of us as God's people being fruitful people.

00:30:05.879 --> 00:30:12.119
We find here that Joseph says, God hath made me, he hath caused me to be fruitful in the

00:30:12.119 --> 00:30:16.399
land of my affliction.

00:30:16.399 --> 00:30:21.879
What enabled Joseph to be fruitful in the land of his affliction was his perspective

00:30:21.879 --> 00:30:26.999
on understanding, as we looked at that firstborn son Manasseh, that forgetfulness.

00:30:27.679 --> 00:30:32.159
Man, if he just focused and just stayed on all of that and just determined that's where

00:30:32.159 --> 00:30:36.559
he was going to live, he would not be fruitful.

00:30:36.559 --> 00:30:42.459
John 15, notice in verse number one, I am the true vine, Jesus is speaking.

00:30:42.459 --> 00:30:45.759
My father is the husbandman.

00:30:45.759 --> 00:30:52.279
Often Jesus would use illustrations and analogies that people could easily relate to.

00:30:52.279 --> 00:31:00.359
And here he's using this very familiar teaching and truth with regard to agriculture, if you

00:31:00.359 --> 00:31:01.359
will.

00:31:01.359 --> 00:31:04.879
And he says, I am the true vine, and my father is the husbandman.

00:31:04.879 --> 00:31:10.159
Every branch in me that beareth not fruit, he taketh away.

00:31:10.159 --> 00:31:16.579
And every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.

00:31:16.579 --> 00:31:21.359
So who are the branches that are in Jesus?

00:31:21.359 --> 00:31:25.519
We are, Christians, disciples, followers of Christ.

00:31:25.519 --> 00:31:26.519
Do you track?

00:31:26.519 --> 00:31:27.519
You see what's going on?

00:31:27.519 --> 00:31:29.719
Listen, he is the true vine.

00:31:29.719 --> 00:31:34.639
He'll say in just a little while, I am the vine, ye are the branches.

00:31:34.639 --> 00:31:39.559
And he says here, every branch in me, and so we know that we are the branches if we've

00:31:39.559 --> 00:31:43.359
trusted Jesus Christ as our personal Savior, we are the branches.

00:31:43.359 --> 00:31:51.319
And he says, every branch in me that beareth not fruit, he taketh away.

00:31:51.319 --> 00:31:56.039
That's a little bit scary.

00:31:56.039 --> 00:31:57.039
You know why?

00:31:57.039 --> 00:32:00.359
Because God's purpose is that we'd be fruitful.

00:32:00.359 --> 00:32:04.799
What good is a fruit tree if it doesn't produce fruit?

00:32:04.799 --> 00:32:05.799
They would understand this.

00:32:05.799 --> 00:32:08.839
You've got a fig tree, and it doesn't produce figs.

00:32:08.839 --> 00:32:11.719
How long are you going to keep the fig tree around?

00:32:11.719 --> 00:32:15.439
Three years, four years, 14 years, 22 years, no, eventually you're going to cut that thing

00:32:15.439 --> 00:32:20.519
down and you're going to plant something else because it's not producing fruit, correct?

00:32:20.719 --> 00:32:29.279
And the Bible says here, and every branch that beareth fruit, notice it says he purgeth

00:32:29.279 --> 00:32:30.279
it.

00:32:30.279 --> 00:32:37.039
Now, I'm not an arborist, I'm not an agricultural guru, but I understand, I've done some study

00:32:37.039 --> 00:32:42.679
and I understand the picture that Jesus is giving, and I understand the purpose of pruning.

00:32:42.679 --> 00:32:44.119
You know what happens when you prune?

00:32:44.119 --> 00:32:47.239
You get more fruit.

00:32:47.239 --> 00:32:51.919
You've got to cut it back, and when it grows, it produces more fruit.

00:32:51.919 --> 00:32:55.439
I pruned these crape myrtles out here a couple of years ago, and some of you are ready to

00:32:55.439 --> 00:32:56.439
kill me.

00:32:56.439 --> 00:32:57.839
Pastor, you killed the trees.

00:32:57.839 --> 00:33:02.599
No, no, I did some research and I did it how they said to do it.

00:33:02.599 --> 00:33:07.759
I'm not an arborist, but we didn't pay somebody to do it, and I just chopped them things up,

00:33:07.759 --> 00:33:08.759
man.

00:33:08.759 --> 00:33:09.759
You know what, Tim?

00:33:09.759 --> 00:33:11.839
They came back and they were beautiful.

00:33:11.839 --> 00:33:15.999
I mean, they just blossomed and flourished.

00:33:15.999 --> 00:33:22.199
Here he says, that every branch that bear fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth.

00:33:22.199 --> 00:33:25.759
Notice what it says, more fruit.

00:33:25.759 --> 00:33:29.279
Verse 3, now you're clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.

00:33:29.279 --> 00:33:34.799
You can look at that in Ephesians 5 and 26 and see the ministry of God's word and cleansing.

00:33:34.799 --> 00:33:42.439
Notice verse 4, abide in me and I in you, as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself

00:33:42.439 --> 00:33:44.879
except it abide in the vine.

00:33:44.879 --> 00:33:48.679
No more can ye except ye abide in me.

00:33:48.679 --> 00:33:52.319
The principle of abiding is so critical.

00:33:52.319 --> 00:33:57.679
He says, abide in me and I in you, as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself.

00:33:57.679 --> 00:34:00.039
We know this.

00:34:00.039 --> 00:34:05.199
When Holly first got home from down in North Carolina, the first time when she was here

00:34:05.199 --> 00:34:10.639
for the scripture assembly, she arrived home and I had some roses waiting for her.

00:34:10.639 --> 00:34:11.639
Amen?

00:34:11.639 --> 00:34:14.119
All you husbands take notes and write things down.

00:34:14.359 --> 00:34:17.439
I had some roses, I had a card and I had some chocolate.

00:34:17.439 --> 00:34:20.519
I tried to cover all those boxes, amen?

00:34:20.519 --> 00:34:24.999
And I had it there waiting for her and then she was going to leave to go back to North

00:34:24.999 --> 00:34:30.439
Carolina and those roses got put down and guess what happened to those roses?

00:34:30.439 --> 00:34:31.439
They died.

00:34:31.439 --> 00:34:32.439
Why?

00:34:32.439 --> 00:34:34.239
Because they were cut from the vine.

00:34:34.239 --> 00:34:39.999
I mean, they were beautiful and then they died.

00:34:39.999 --> 00:34:45.239
And I noticed that before she got home, I was going to have to deal with those roses

00:34:45.239 --> 00:34:52.719
and I didn't deal with them on the Monday and then Tuesday I said, I got to take care

00:34:52.719 --> 00:34:56.599
of that but I had some other things going on and I just kind of left it there and Wednesday

00:34:56.599 --> 00:35:01.039
I walked downstairs and I said, what is that smell?

00:35:01.039 --> 00:35:02.239
You know what those roses started to do?

00:35:02.239 --> 00:35:03.239
They started to stink.

00:35:03.239 --> 00:35:08.559
How many of you know roses smell good when they're alive and when they're fresh, right?

00:35:08.559 --> 00:35:15.639
But they died and they stunk, I had to throw them away.

00:35:15.639 --> 00:35:18.659
We know this but notice Jesus saying this is us.

00:35:18.659 --> 00:35:19.839
He wants us to be fruitful.

00:35:19.839 --> 00:35:25.499
Joseph says, God hath made me to be fruitful, he hath caused me to be fruitful in the land

00:35:25.499 --> 00:35:28.639
of my affliction.

00:35:28.639 --> 00:35:32.839
I mean in the difficulties, God hath caused me to be fruitful.

00:35:32.839 --> 00:35:36.119
Notice in verse number five, I am the vine, ye are the branches, he that abideth in me

00:35:36.119 --> 00:35:38.119
and I in him, the same bringeth forth.

00:35:38.679 --> 00:35:39.679
What does it say?

00:35:39.679 --> 00:35:43.439
Much fruit, for without me ye can do nothing.

00:35:43.439 --> 00:35:48.799
If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch and is withered.

00:35:48.799 --> 00:35:52.099
Men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned.

00:35:52.099 --> 00:35:56.359
If ye abide in me and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will and it shall be

00:35:56.359 --> 00:35:57.359
done unto you.

00:35:57.359 --> 00:36:05.479
Notice in verse eight, critical verse of Scripture, herein is my Father glorified that ye bear

00:36:05.479 --> 00:36:10.559
much fruit, so shall ye be my disciples.

00:36:10.559 --> 00:36:14.639
You know God wants us to be fruitful.

00:36:14.639 --> 00:36:22.319
He said to, when he issued that call to the disciples, they're on the Sea of Galilee,

00:36:22.319 --> 00:36:29.399
the call to Peter, he says, follow me and I will make you fishers of men.

00:36:29.399 --> 00:36:35.679
When we begin to look at John 15 and thinking about this principle of perspective with Joseph

00:36:35.679 --> 00:36:41.159
back in Genesis chapter 41, and he says, God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land

00:36:41.159 --> 00:36:47.319
of my affliction, and I say God has intended for us as his people to be fruitful people.

00:36:47.319 --> 00:36:53.639
And when we bear much fruit, see, it's fruit, more fruit, and much fruit, as you study through

00:36:53.639 --> 00:36:59.999
John 15, and he says that if you bear much fruit, he says, herein is my Father glorified

00:36:59.999 --> 00:37:00.999
that you bear much fruit.

00:37:00.999 --> 00:37:03.359
I want God to be glorified.

00:37:03.359 --> 00:37:08.799
So we've got to abide in him, and we have to allow God to work through our lives.

00:37:08.799 --> 00:37:14.119
Listen, we cannot hinder what God is seeking to do in our lives today because we're so

00:37:14.119 --> 00:37:19.999
focused on the hardships and the difficulties that happened at some time in our past.

00:37:20.319 --> 00:37:27.319
Joseph says when Manasseh is born, God has caused me to forget.

00:37:27.319 --> 00:37:30.599
God has caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.

00:37:30.599 --> 00:37:36.919
Listen, this evening, we're going to face some affliction, some difficulty.

00:37:36.919 --> 00:37:40.799
You say, pastor, you're telling me I'm facing it right now.

00:37:40.799 --> 00:37:41.799
I understand.

00:37:41.799 --> 00:37:44.639
Turn to the book of 1 Thessalonians, if you will.

00:37:44.639 --> 00:37:50.559
I want to just journey real quickly through just a few verses of Scripture, and I hope

00:37:50.559 --> 00:37:53.439
that this helps us tonight.

00:37:53.439 --> 00:37:56.039
We consider the principle of preparation.

00:37:56.039 --> 00:37:58.039
God is working to prepare us.

00:37:58.039 --> 00:38:02.839
Listen, don't despise the time of preparation.

00:38:02.839 --> 00:38:09.039
Don't neglect a season of preparation in your life because we need that.

00:38:09.039 --> 00:38:11.319
God's preparing us for something.

00:38:11.319 --> 00:38:13.559
You think about this principle of perspective.

00:38:13.559 --> 00:38:15.319
Perspective is so important.

00:38:15.319 --> 00:38:21.079
In 1 Thessalonians chapter number 3, Paul had already mentioned in chapter 1 how that

00:38:21.079 --> 00:38:27.239
they came to them with much difficulty as they brought the gospel, and that was what

00:38:27.239 --> 00:38:28.239
they were dealing with.

00:38:28.239 --> 00:38:31.639
And if you go back to the book of Acts, you can study and see on that journey all of the

00:38:31.639 --> 00:38:32.639
hardship that they faced.

00:38:32.639 --> 00:38:36.759
But as you come to the third chapter, notice that the Bible says in verse number 3 that

00:38:36.759 --> 00:38:40.019
no man should be moved by these afflictions.

00:38:40.019 --> 00:38:48.859
Listen, there were some difficulties that the people in Thessalonica were facing.

00:38:48.859 --> 00:38:51.019
There were some persecutions that they were dealing with.

00:38:51.019 --> 00:38:56.019
There were some afflictions, and Paul says that no man should be moved by these afflictions.

00:38:56.019 --> 00:39:01.259
Listen, God is God, and He's on His throne, and He has a purpose, and even in that time

00:39:01.259 --> 00:39:05.019
of affliction, God can use you and can cause you to be fruitful.

00:39:05.019 --> 00:39:10.019
He says, knowing for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto.

00:39:10.019 --> 00:39:14.019
Notice in 2 Thessalonians chapter number 1, and then we're going to come back to 1 Thessalonians

00:39:14.019 --> 00:39:20.099
because I want you to see the perspective and the opportunity that we can be fruitful

00:39:20.099 --> 00:39:23.579
even in the midst of affliction.

00:39:23.579 --> 00:39:27.859
In 2 Thessalonians 1 and verse number 4, the Bible says so that we ourselves glory in you

00:39:27.859 --> 00:39:33.940
in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations

00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:36.699
that ye endure.

00:39:36.699 --> 00:39:38.539
They were suffering.

00:39:38.539 --> 00:39:42.380
The church in Thessalonica, the believers, they were dealing with persecution and all

00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:46.940
these hardships and things that were taking place, and Paul says that you have patience

00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:51.859
and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure.

00:39:51.859 --> 00:39:55.979
He said in chapter 3 of the first book, he says that no man should be moved by these

00:39:55.979 --> 00:39:59.940
afflictions, but I want you to go all the way back to the first chapter of 1 Thessalonians.

00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:02.300
First Thessalonians.

00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:04.240
And I want you to see that a people,

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:06.880
a church that was facing persecution,

00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:09.440
affliction, and difficulty,

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:12.120
that God had allowed them to be fruitful

00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:15.640
even in a season of difficulty and affliction.

00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:17.680
The Bible says in verse number seven

00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:19.720
of First Thessalonians one,

00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:22.460
actually back up to verse number four, if you will,

00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:24.560
knowing, brethren, beloved, your election of God

00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:27.040
for our gospel came not unto you in word only,

00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:28.840
but also in power and in the Holy Ghost

00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:31.440
and in much assurance, as you know what manner of men

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:34.080
we were among you for your sake.

00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:36.400
And ye became followers of us and of the Lord,

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:38.980
having received the word in much affliction

00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:41.400
with joy of the Holy Ghost.

00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:44.960
Now notice this, so that ye were in samples

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:47.960
to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia.

00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:51.240
Verse number eight, for from you sounded out

00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:53.600
the word of the Lord, not only in Macedonia and Achaia,

00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:55.560
but also in every place your faith to God

00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:57.680
were to spread abroad, so that we need not

00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:00.000
to speak anything, for they themselves show of us

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.280
what manner of entering in we had unto you,

00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:04.200
and how you turned to God from idols

00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:07.060
to serve the living and true God.

00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:10.639
The church at Thessalonica had a great testimony.

00:41:11.639 --> 00:41:14.440
I've said this over the years, there's no perfect church,

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.480
but the church at Thessalonica is a model church.

00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:21.920
And as you study through the two epistles

00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:24.940
to the Thessalonians, you find that they're a model church,

00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:27.000
and here Paul is saying at this last part

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.800
of chapter number one, that even though

00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:30.200
they had dealt with affliction,

00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:32.760
and even though they had dealt with this persecution,

00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:34.520
these persecutions and tribulations,

00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:35.880
and all that they were dealing with,

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:38.319
that they were still fruitful, for notice it says,

00:41:38.319 --> 00:41:39.840
for from you, in verse number eight,

00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:42.080
sounded out the word of the Lord,

00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:43.520
not only in Macedonia and Achaia,

00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:45.360
but also in every place your faith to God

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:47.279
were to spread abroad, so that we need not

00:41:47.279 --> 00:41:48.480
to speak anything.

00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:50.200
It's almost as if Paul is saying,

00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:52.380
we go to share the gospel in a region,

00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:54.520
but you've already shared the gospel there.

00:41:55.520 --> 00:41:57.880
Now think about that for a moment.

00:41:57.880 --> 00:41:59.200
In the midst of their affliction,

00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:00.800
and their persecution, and their difficulties,

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:01.880
and all they were dealing with,

00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:05.000
they were still sending out the truth of the gospel,

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.959
they were still doing what they were seeking

00:42:06.959 --> 00:42:10.360
to be fruitful, God was using them to be fruitful,

00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:13.460
even in a time, a season of affliction.

00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:17.520
I've heard many testimonies over the years

00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:20.779
of people that have dealt with great hardships,

00:42:21.779 --> 00:42:25.500
be it physical or otherwise,

00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:27.900
and they share testimonies of,

00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:31.320
in that season of great difficulty and of affliction,

00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:33.339
how God used them to be able to share the gospel

00:42:33.339 --> 00:42:36.339
with someone, and they got saved.

00:42:36.339 --> 00:42:39.660
That's amazing to me, that God would work in that manner.

00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:43.059
See, this evening, we think about

00:42:43.059 --> 00:42:46.500
the principle of preparation,

00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:47.860
it's important that we understand,

00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:50.419
and we go through that season of preparation,

00:42:51.059 --> 00:42:53.059
for God has a purpose and a plan for us.

00:42:54.619 --> 00:42:57.820
And when he's ready to open that door,

00:42:57.820 --> 00:43:00.059
did we get all the preparation we were supposed to get?

00:43:00.059 --> 00:43:02.760
Are we ready to do what God has for us to do?

00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:05.619
See, because when the opportunity arises,

00:43:05.619 --> 00:43:08.979
that's not time to prepare, that's time to do.

00:43:08.979 --> 00:43:10.020
Does that make sense?

00:43:11.339 --> 00:43:13.979
But then the principle of perspective,

00:43:13.979 --> 00:43:15.740
what do we focus on?

00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:18.040
Do we focus on how bad things are?

00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:19.540
How terrible, how we were wronged,

00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:20.940
and how this happened and that happened,

00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:24.900
and I just can't imagine this person didn't do this,

00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:26.339
or this person didn't say hi to me,

00:43:26.339 --> 00:43:29.300
and this person, I mean, we get mad about silly things.

00:43:30.139 --> 00:43:32.100
Seriously, honestly.

00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:36.979
Somebody came to me about five weeks ago and said,

00:43:36.979 --> 00:43:38.460
Pastor, are you mad at me?

00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:40.580
I said, no, why would I be mad at you?

00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:43.139
Well, you didn't say hi to me last week.

00:43:43.139 --> 00:43:44.180
I'm very sorry.

00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:49.220
And it was a great conversation, everything was resolved.

00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:50.740
But what I'm saying is that,

00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:53.139
it wasn't that I didn't say hi because I was mad,

00:43:53.139 --> 00:43:54.619
we had a problem with the sound thing,

00:43:54.619 --> 00:43:56.779
my lapel wasn't working, and I was back there

00:43:56.779 --> 00:43:58.020
trying to get things fixed up,

00:43:58.020 --> 00:44:00.260
and working with whatever was going on,

00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:04.339
and I think it wasn't my lapel, it was my iPad.

00:44:04.339 --> 00:44:06.900
Because Joseph says, you just need to get a new one.

00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:09.740
But the reality is that sometimes the devil

00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:12.540
can use super little things to just mess us up.

00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:14.580
Seriously.

00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:17.580
And what's our perspective?

00:44:18.339 --> 00:44:21.660
Listen, Joseph had a whole lot of bad things.

00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:24.220
He said, God, he calls me to forget.

00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:28.739
And therefore, God's called me to be fruitful

00:44:28.739 --> 00:44:30.059
in the land of affliction.

00:44:31.059 --> 00:44:32.540
See, sometimes we're in the land of affliction

00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:35.779
when it's a time of great distress and just difficulty,

00:44:35.779 --> 00:44:38.299
and we think that means that we have a pass

00:44:38.299 --> 00:44:39.660
to just kind of do nothing.

00:44:40.739 --> 00:44:42.380
Well, I got all this stuff going on,

00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:46.899
and God understands, and it's just,

00:44:46.899 --> 00:44:49.580
woe is me, pity party.

00:44:51.059 --> 00:44:54.179
Joseph said, God, let me be fruitful.

00:44:55.339 --> 00:44:57.019
God hath called me to be fruitful

00:44:57.899 --> 00:44:59.580
in the land of my affliction.

00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:03.779
I don't know tonight what everyone is dealing with,

00:45:03.779 --> 00:45:07.179
but I know we have a God who if we keep our attention

00:45:07.179 --> 00:45:09.820
and our perspective on him,

00:45:09.820 --> 00:45:13.140
that even in the midst of difficulty and affliction,

00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:15.459
he can cause us to be fruitful.

00:45:15.459 --> 00:45:17.820
He can use us for his honor and for his glory.

00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:23.700
There's a world that was directly impacted

00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:30.140
because of Joseph's faithfulness and fruitfulness.

00:45:31.779 --> 00:45:34.019
People's lives were spared

00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:38.459
because there was a great famine that was coming,

00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:43.500
and because Joseph understood the preparation,

00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:45.940
Joseph had a right perspective.

00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:50.299
When the opportunity came, God used him.

00:45:50.299 --> 00:45:52.059
God calls me to be fruitful.

00:45:52.059 --> 00:45:54.860
Tonight, I hope that God would help us

00:45:54.860 --> 00:45:58.940
to have that perspective that Joseph had,

00:45:58.940 --> 00:46:00.739
that we'd understand the preparation

00:46:00.739 --> 00:46:02.420
that God is taking us through.

00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:03.260
Let's pray.

00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:04.580
Father, we love you.

00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:06.179
We thank you for loving us.

00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:09.100
We thank you that you're God,

00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:10.779
and though at times we don't understand

00:46:10.779 --> 00:46:12.820
all that's taking place, we can trust you.

00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:14.140
We can rest in you.

00:46:15.019 --> 00:46:19.700
God, help us to understand the seasons of preparation

00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:22.220
that you would guide and lead us through,

00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:24.820
and I pray that in those moments of preparation

00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:28.380
that you would help us to get all

00:46:28.380 --> 00:46:29.899
that we're supposed to get,

00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:33.540
that we would be prepared for the opportunities

00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:35.100
that you present us with.

00:46:37.540 --> 00:46:41.739
I think about this perspective of Joseph

00:46:41.739 --> 00:46:44.540
and the principle that we see here,

00:46:44.540 --> 00:46:47.339
the naming of his two sons,

00:46:47.339 --> 00:46:49.580
and God, I pray that you'd help us to look to Jesus,

00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:51.739
the author and finisher of our faith,

00:46:51.739 --> 00:46:53.459
help us to have an eternal perspective,

00:46:53.459 --> 00:46:55.500
not a temporal perspective,

00:46:55.500 --> 00:47:00.500
help us to not focus upon those things that are hurtful,

00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:04.700
but God, help us to focus on you

00:47:06.260 --> 00:47:08.980
and how you can cause us to be fruitful,

00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:10.779
even in the land of affliction.

00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:13.860
I pray that tonight you would move and work

00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:16.580
in hearts and lives as only you can.

00:47:16.580 --> 00:47:19.739
I pray, Lord, that we would not only see

00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:23.100
the life of Joseph recorded for us,

00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:25.739
but we would apply truth in our lives

00:47:25.739 --> 00:47:29.179
that would cause us to be used in like manner.

00:47:29.179 --> 00:47:30.619
We give you the glory for all that you'll do,

00:47:30.619 --> 00:47:32.380
for it's in Christ's name we pray.
