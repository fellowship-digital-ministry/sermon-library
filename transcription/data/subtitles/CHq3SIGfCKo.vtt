00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.679
I want you to pray for Brother Tony this morning.

00:00:01.679 --> 00:00:02.960
He's not feeling well,

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.300
and dealing with some pain this morning.

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.480
And so if you'd pray for Brother Tony,

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.880
I know he'd appreciate that.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.119
2 Timothy chapter number three,

00:00:10.119 --> 00:00:12.000
we'll begin looking in verse number 13,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.640
and then go down through chapter number four

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.799
in verse number five this morning.

00:00:16.799 --> 00:00:18.920
And as we've been studying through the books

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.399
of 1 and 2 Timothy for this calendar year

00:00:21.399 --> 00:00:23.360
with our theme of continue,

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.340
we're getting near the end of the calendar year.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.200
So we're getting near the end of our study

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.000
through 1 and 2 Timothy.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.120
And I've greatly enjoyed the opportunity

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.279
to preach through these books.

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.240
And we come to the third chapter

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.560
of the book of 2 Timothy,

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.919
and we find that the characteristics of the last days

00:00:38.919 --> 00:00:40.639
have been revealed to us.

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:43.279
And then we were reminded last week

00:00:43.279 --> 00:00:46.400
of the life and ministry of the Apostle Paul,

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.840
and how he said you've fully known my doctrine,

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.159
my manner of life, my purpose, my faith,

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:54.240
my long suffering, charity, patience,

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.159
persecutions, and afflictions.

00:00:56.159 --> 00:00:59.639
He begins to share with Timothy his own experience

00:00:59.639 --> 00:01:03.139
and what he endured for the cause of Christ,

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:06.160
and how he saw the Lord deliver him

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.080
through all of those afflictions.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.839
And what a great testimony the Apostle Paul has and had,

00:01:12.839 --> 00:01:15.559
and we're thankful for the work that God did

00:01:15.559 --> 00:01:17.360
in and through his life.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.760
The Lord wants us to have our eyes wide open

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.099
with regard to all that we will face in these last days.

00:01:24.099 --> 00:01:26.080
We find that he says in verse number one,

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.040
this know also that in the last days

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.559
perilous times shall come.

00:01:30.559 --> 00:01:33.879
We think of verse number 13,

00:01:33.879 --> 00:01:36.160
the first verse of our text for this morning,

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.360
but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse,

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.220
deceiving and being deceived.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.480
You understand this morning

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.160
that our world's not gradually getting better.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.279
It's getting worse and it's getting worse,

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:50.919
and evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse,

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:53.720
deceiving and being deceived.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.919
And we find that God wants us to have our eyes wide open.

00:01:56.919 --> 00:01:58.919
He wants us to know these things.

00:01:58.919 --> 00:02:00.879
He's provided us with this information

00:02:00.879 --> 00:02:02.839
so that we would not be ignorant,

00:02:02.839 --> 00:02:05.519
but it's important for us to understand

00:02:05.519 --> 00:02:09.000
that the information that God has provided to us in his word

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.960
specifically within the context of the message this morning

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.600
and the text this morning,

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.580
God has not provided this information to us

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.039
so that we would become discouraged.

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:21.080
He's not provided this information to us

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.160
so that we would become detoured

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.559
from doing what God has called us to do.

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:29.520
The unfortunate thing is that at times we can take

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.759
and we can come to a passage like this,

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:33.679
and we could ask ourselves a question

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:35.800
that's asked thousands of years ago,

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.860
what can the righteous do?

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.419
If we've been told that this is the characteristics,

00:02:42.419 --> 00:02:44.779
these are the characteristics of the last days,

00:02:44.779 --> 00:02:46.199
and that evil men and seducers

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:48.039
are gonna wax worse and worse,

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:50.360
then why even try?

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.559
Why even live for the, I mean, is it really worth it?

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:55.259
And we can have that approach,

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:58.660
but understand that God's not giving us that information

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.559
so that we would respond that way.

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:03.880
He's not, Paul is not informing Timothy

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.399
so that Timothy quits and gives up and leaves town.

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:11.479
No, God's telling Timothy through the apostle Paul,

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:13.839
here's what your battle is in Ephesus,

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:16.940
here's what you're facing as you seek to minister

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.660
and serve God in the place where he's placed you,

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.179
and understand, continue.

00:03:22.179 --> 00:03:24.539
I mean, don't give up, don't give in,

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:27.300
don't get discouraged, don't become detoured.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.779
No, just keep on keeping on.

00:03:29.779 --> 00:03:31.779
And we find that it is important

00:03:31.779 --> 00:03:34.820
that we have the proper approach and response

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.179
to what God gives us.

00:03:36.179 --> 00:03:37.759
We ask ourselves this question,

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:39.460
what is a believer to do

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.660
in the midst of great wickedness and hostility?

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.940
We live in a time of great wickedness.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.940
We live in an hostile environment.

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.440
And so what is it that we're to do?

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.139
Well, I've titled the message this morning, Press On.

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:55.500
Press on, our theme is continue.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.860
I was gonna use that word,

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.320
but that was the title that we used

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.899
for the first message of this calendar year.

00:04:00.899 --> 00:04:02.600
And so press on.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.020
And you remember what the songwriter said,

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.619
onward, forward, right?

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:12.899
Listen, as a child of God, as a believer this morning,

00:04:12.899 --> 00:04:15.339
as a soldier in the Lord's army,

00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:18.779
and we spent five weeks dealing with chapter two

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:21.100
and various aspects of what it means

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.399
to be a good soldier of Jesus Christ,

00:04:24.399 --> 00:04:27.619
there is no retreating in God's army.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.079
It is press on.

00:04:30.079 --> 00:04:32.239
It is onward, forward.

00:04:32.239 --> 00:04:35.220
We remember the truth that Jesus gave

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.700
when he said to Peter and to the disciples that were there,

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.100
he said, I will build my church,

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.140
and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.220
I want you to understand this morning

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.820
that God is still on his throne.

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.160
I want you to understand this morning

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.160
that Jesus is still actively building his church.

00:04:57.339 --> 00:04:58.940
When the church is done,

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.859
when Christ is done with the church,

00:05:00.859 --> 00:05:02.339
the bride of Christ, listen,

00:05:02.339 --> 00:05:04.679
the bridegroom cometh for the bride,

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:06.619
and we're raptured out of here,

00:05:06.619 --> 00:05:08.579
and the church age has ended,

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.980
but until then, Jesus is building his church.

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.619
Jesus did not give that promise in Matthew

00:05:16.619 --> 00:05:18.779
to Peter and to the other apostles

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:20.299
that he would build his church

00:05:20.299 --> 00:05:22.279
only for a certain period of time,

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:24.779
only in the first century, only in Jerusalem.

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:27.339
No, he said, I will build my church,

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:29.820
and I believe that Jesus is still today

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:34.420
actively working on building his church.

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:38.459
By the way, I'm thankful to be part of a church.

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.700
I'm thankful to understand

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:45.420
that God has given us this gift of a church.

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:46.540
The body of believers,

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.940
remember, the church is not a building.

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.380
It's the individuals that are saved and baptized

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.640
and have voluntarily joined themselves together

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.299
for the purpose of carrying out the Great Commission

00:05:56.299 --> 00:05:57.619
and glorifying God.

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:02.339
What a blessing to be part of a church.

00:06:02.339 --> 00:06:03.380
We find this morning,

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:04.820
as we look at our text of Scripture,

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.299
beginning in verse 13, the Bible says,

00:06:06.299 --> 00:06:09.260
but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse,

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.339
deceiving and being deceived.

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:15.019
But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned

00:06:15.019 --> 00:06:16.720
and hast been assured of,

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.540
knowing of whom thou hast learned them,

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:22.040
that from a child thou hast known the Holy Scriptures,

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.220
which are able to make thee wise unto salvation

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:27.420
through faith, which is in Christ Jesus.

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:31.100
All Scripture is given by inspiration of God

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.779
and is profitable for doctrine,

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:34.100
for reproof, for correction,

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:35.859
for instruction in righteousness,

00:06:35.859 --> 00:06:37.940
that the man of God may be perfect,

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.339
throughly furnished unto all good works.

00:06:41.339 --> 00:06:43.299
I charge thee therefore before God

00:06:43.299 --> 00:06:44.660
and the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:46.220
who shall judge the quick and the dead,

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.119
it is appearing in his kingdom,

00:06:48.119 --> 00:06:50.100
preach the word.

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.019
Be instant, in season, out of season,

00:06:52.019 --> 00:06:53.820
reprove, rebuke, exhort,

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:55.480
with all longsuffering and doctrine,

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:56.619
for the time will come

00:06:56.619 --> 00:06:59.339
when they will not endure sound doctrine.

00:06:59.339 --> 00:07:00.940
But after their own lust,

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.079
shall they heap to themselves teachers

00:07:03.079 --> 00:07:04.859
having itching ears,

00:07:04.859 --> 00:07:07.260
and they shall turn away their ears from the truth

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.920
and shall be turned unto fables.

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.619
But watch thou in all things,

00:07:11.619 --> 00:07:12.899
endure afflictions,

00:07:12.899 --> 00:07:15.239
do the work of an evangelist,

00:07:15.239 --> 00:07:18.660
make full proof of thy ministry.

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:20.179
As we look at this text of Scripture

00:07:20.179 --> 00:07:23.019
with the thought this morning of press on,

00:07:23.019 --> 00:07:25.959
I wanna share two basic truths with you

00:07:25.959 --> 00:07:28.660
that I hope will help us as we live

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:31.980
in the midst of a hostile environment,

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:33.700
in the midst of great wickedness,

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:35.940
in the time that has been described

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:37.420
as being perilous times,

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:39.459
that God would enable us

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:41.920
and help us to press on,

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.579
to continue for the cause of Christ.

00:07:44.579 --> 00:07:46.179
Because we find that Paul,

00:07:46.179 --> 00:07:49.619
the theme of our entire year this year

00:07:49.619 --> 00:07:51.940
comes from verse number 14,

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:55.980
but continue thou in the things

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:57.859
which thou hast learned

00:07:57.859 --> 00:07:59.459
and hast been assured of

00:07:59.459 --> 00:08:02.619
knowing of whom thou hast learned them.

00:08:02.619 --> 00:08:04.019
And so we find that as we come

00:08:04.019 --> 00:08:05.299
to this passage of Scripture

00:08:05.299 --> 00:08:07.940
and we kind of take and deal with this subject

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:09.059
of press on,

00:08:09.059 --> 00:08:11.459
number one, I want you to recognize this,

00:08:11.459 --> 00:08:15.000
that we have been equipped to press on.

00:08:16.019 --> 00:08:18.820
I'm thankful for the equipping of God.

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:19.959
I'm thankful this morning

00:08:19.959 --> 00:08:21.899
that God did not just leave us

00:08:21.899 --> 00:08:24.380
and say, go ahead, figure it out.

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:26.380
No, I'm thankful that the Holy Spirit of God

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:27.799
is the earnest of our inheritance,

00:08:28.739 --> 00:08:29.579
that the Holy Spirit of God,

00:08:29.579 --> 00:08:30.399
if you're saved this morning,

00:08:30.399 --> 00:08:31.239
indwells you,

00:08:31.239 --> 00:08:32.719
you have the ability to be filled

00:08:32.719 --> 00:08:34.000
with the Spirit of God,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.840
controlled by the Spirit of God,

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:39.000
to have the power of the Holy Spirit upon you

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
so that you can do what God has called you to do.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.239
And we begin to look at this passage of Scripture

00:08:44.239 --> 00:08:45.799
and we must understand

00:08:45.799 --> 00:08:47.919
that the equipping for pressing on,

00:08:47.919 --> 00:08:50.760
we're dealing with a spiritual truth this morning.

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:53.320
We understand that God used the Apostle Paul

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.320
to write to the church at Ephesus

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.719
and told them we wrestle not against flesh and blood.

00:08:58.719 --> 00:09:01.559
We're engaged in spiritual warfare.

00:09:01.559 --> 00:09:04.000
They can call it whatever they want to call it,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.320
but the reality is that we understand as Bible believers

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.640
that we're dealing with spiritual warfare

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.659
and our weapons are different

00:09:11.659 --> 00:09:13.479
than the weapons that they would use.

00:09:13.479 --> 00:09:15.159
Our weapons are not carnal.

00:09:15.159 --> 00:09:16.760
Our weapons are spiritual,

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:19.840
to the pulling down of strongholds.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.520
That's what God tells us in 2 Corinthians.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:25.559
And so we find this morning that God has equipped us.

00:09:25.559 --> 00:09:29.400
It's not by your own power, by your own strength.

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.559
No, it's the power of God.

00:09:31.559 --> 00:09:33.159
It's the strength of God.

00:09:33.159 --> 00:09:37.520
Be strong in the Lord and the power of His might.

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:40.479
And so we find this morning that we notice the equipping

00:09:40.479 --> 00:09:43.960
specifically of Timothy here,

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:45.559
as the Apostle Paul highlights,

00:09:45.559 --> 00:09:49.400
but then also I think about how God has equipped us.

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:50.739
I want you to consider,

00:09:50.739 --> 00:09:53.640
as we think about this subject of equipping,

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:57.140
notice the instruction that Timothy received

00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:59.859
along with the influence that he received.

00:09:59.859 --> 00:10:01.939
There was instruction that Timothy received.

00:10:01.939 --> 00:10:04.699
Notice it says, but continue thou, in verse 14,

00:10:04.699 --> 00:10:06.179
in the things which thou hast learned

00:10:06.179 --> 00:10:07.459
and has been assured of,

00:10:07.459 --> 00:10:09.379
knowing of whom thou hast learned them.

00:10:09.379 --> 00:10:10.619
We're gonna get to that in just a moment,

00:10:10.619 --> 00:10:11.939
but notice in verse 15,

00:10:11.939 --> 00:10:15.519
and that from a child thou hast known the Holy Scriptures,

00:10:15.519 --> 00:10:17.979
which are able to make thee wise unto salvation

00:10:17.979 --> 00:10:21.459
through faith which is in Christ Jesus.

00:10:21.459 --> 00:10:24.659
Begin to understand the instruction that Timothy received,

00:10:24.659 --> 00:10:27.099
the influence in Timothy's life.

00:10:27.099 --> 00:10:30.459
And Paul says in verse 15 that from a child

00:10:30.459 --> 00:10:32.499
thou hast known the Holy Scriptures.

00:10:32.499 --> 00:10:34.299
Understand with me this morning

00:10:34.299 --> 00:10:37.979
that Paul did not have the initial influence

00:10:37.979 --> 00:10:40.419
and instruction in Timothy's life.

00:10:40.419 --> 00:10:42.959
It was his grandmother and his mother.

00:10:42.959 --> 00:10:45.259
And we find in 2 Timothy chapter one,

00:10:45.259 --> 00:10:48.239
if you just turn back a few pages there in your Bible,

00:10:48.239 --> 00:10:52.179
we find that Paul deals with that and he addresses that.

00:10:52.179 --> 00:10:55.179
Notice in verse number five of 2 Timothy one,

00:10:56.179 --> 00:10:59.739
Paul says, when I call to remembrance

00:10:59.739 --> 00:11:04.659
the unfeigned faith that is in thee.

00:11:04.659 --> 00:11:07.399
So we understand that Paul's talking about Timothy.

00:11:07.399 --> 00:11:11.099
Now understand that word unfeigned,

00:11:11.099 --> 00:11:15.199
it means not counterfeit, not hypocritical.

00:11:15.199 --> 00:11:16.979
This was the real deal.

00:11:16.979 --> 00:11:18.779
This was real faith.

00:11:18.779 --> 00:11:23.539
This was Timothy truly believing God that God is able.

00:11:23.539 --> 00:11:26.179
And so Paul says, when I call to remembrance

00:11:26.179 --> 00:11:28.259
the unfeigned faith that is in thee,

00:11:28.259 --> 00:11:31.379
but notice he says, which dwelt first

00:11:31.379 --> 00:11:35.099
in thy grandmother Lois and thy mother Eunice,

00:11:35.099 --> 00:11:38.499
and I am persuaded that in thee also.

00:11:38.499 --> 00:11:40.859
And so we see the generational impact,

00:11:40.859 --> 00:11:43.639
the generational influence, the instruction

00:11:43.639 --> 00:11:46.459
that Timothy received and that from a child,

00:11:46.459 --> 00:11:50.259
notice, thou hast known the Holy Scriptures,

00:11:50.259 --> 00:11:52.939
which are able to make thee wise into salvation

00:11:52.939 --> 00:11:54.939
through faith, which is in Christ Jesus.

00:11:54.939 --> 00:11:57.379
But we understand that from a child

00:11:57.379 --> 00:11:59.379
thou hast known the Holy Scriptures.

00:11:59.379 --> 00:12:01.639
How did he know them as a child?

00:12:01.639 --> 00:12:04.259
Well, we get insight from this introduction

00:12:04.259 --> 00:12:07.859
in chapter number one that he had a saved mom

00:12:07.859 --> 00:12:11.139
and a saved grandma and they taught him,

00:12:11.139 --> 00:12:14.519
they instructed him in the ways of the Lord.

00:12:14.519 --> 00:12:17.679
As best we can tell from the record in the book of Acts,

00:12:17.679 --> 00:12:20.719
Timothy had a dad that was lost.

00:12:20.719 --> 00:12:22.159
You know what that tells me?

00:12:22.159 --> 00:12:23.759
That tells me for those children,

00:12:23.759 --> 00:12:25.159
those teens that are struggling,

00:12:25.159 --> 00:12:28.199
that I have a lost parent, I have a home.

00:12:28.199 --> 00:12:30.279
Listen, it's best if both parents are saved,

00:12:30.279 --> 00:12:32.919
but you understand that's not always the situation,

00:12:32.919 --> 00:12:35.239
and even if that's not the situation,

00:12:35.239 --> 00:12:38.559
Timothy was still used of God in a great way.

00:12:38.559 --> 00:12:40.839
We can't think that God would write us off

00:12:40.839 --> 00:12:42.319
because of something like that,

00:12:42.319 --> 00:12:45.939
but I'm thankful that God had an influence

00:12:45.939 --> 00:12:47.799
through a grandmother and a mother

00:12:47.799 --> 00:12:50.999
in the life of Timothy, and Timothy knew

00:12:50.999 --> 00:12:54.639
the scriptures, and as Paul would meet Timothy,

00:12:54.639 --> 00:12:59.639
and as Paul would begin to go out together as a team,

00:12:59.659 --> 00:13:02.519
we find that Paul then really, in a sense,

00:13:02.519 --> 00:13:05.999
became a mentor in Timothy's life.

00:13:05.999 --> 00:13:08.599
Notice in verse number six of 2 Timothy 1,

00:13:08.599 --> 00:13:10.959
the Bible says, wherefore, I put thee in remembrance

00:13:10.959 --> 00:13:13.919
that thou stir up the gift of God,

00:13:13.919 --> 00:13:17.999
which is in thee, by the putting on of my hands.

00:13:17.999 --> 00:13:20.199
Now, it was not some supernatural,

00:13:20.199 --> 00:13:22.019
he put on hands and he gave them a gift,

00:13:22.019 --> 00:13:23.919
but it was that signification,

00:13:23.919 --> 00:13:26.679
just like we would talk about laying hands on someone,

00:13:26.679 --> 00:13:30.399
we're acknowledging that God has placed a call

00:13:30.399 --> 00:13:34.479
in someone's life, and they're responding to that call,

00:13:34.479 --> 00:13:36.719
and so here we find the gift of God.

00:13:36.719 --> 00:13:37.759
Who gives the gift?

00:13:37.759 --> 00:13:38.959
Well, the Holy Spirit.

00:13:38.959 --> 00:13:41.359
We find that in the book of 1 Corinthians,

00:13:41.359 --> 00:13:44.439
he giveth to all men severally as he will,

00:13:44.439 --> 00:13:47.779
and so we find that Timothy had been gifted

00:13:48.559 --> 00:13:50.379
by the Lord, he had been instructed and influenced,

00:13:50.379 --> 00:13:53.459
and then Paul becomes his mentor.

00:13:54.299 --> 00:13:56.219
I want you to think about the significance

00:13:56.219 --> 00:13:59.499
as we understand the equipping and understanding

00:13:59.499 --> 00:14:02.779
how Paul and Lois and Eunice,

00:14:02.779 --> 00:14:07.299
how God used them to equip Timothy,

00:14:07.299 --> 00:14:09.379
but all the while, what are they doing?

00:14:09.379 --> 00:14:12.019
They're pointing him in the ways of the Lord.

00:14:12.019 --> 00:14:13.939
They're using the Holy Scriptures.

00:14:13.939 --> 00:14:15.979
That's what the Bible tells us in verse 15,

00:14:15.979 --> 00:14:18.739
that from a child thou hast known the Holy Scriptures.

00:14:18.739 --> 00:14:21.899
You know what's gonna give you unfeigned faith?

00:14:21.899 --> 00:14:22.739
The Bible.

00:14:24.219 --> 00:14:27.059
So then faith cometh by hearing,

00:14:27.059 --> 00:14:31.059
and hearing by the word of God, amen?

00:14:31.059 --> 00:14:32.299
That's where you're gonna get faith.

00:14:32.299 --> 00:14:33.659
That's where my faith increases.

00:14:33.659 --> 00:14:35.459
That's where your faith increases,

00:14:35.459 --> 00:14:38.500
and that unfeigned faith that we find

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:40.619
that is mentioned in chapter number one,

00:14:40.619 --> 00:14:43.199
we receive some further insight

00:14:43.199 --> 00:14:45.259
as we come to this passage of Scripture,

00:14:45.259 --> 00:14:46.579
and we find that the Bible says

00:14:46.579 --> 00:14:49.099
what you're able to make thee wise unto salvation.

00:14:49.099 --> 00:14:50.379
You know what we understand?

00:14:50.379 --> 00:14:53.939
The truth of salvation is contained in the Old Testament,

00:14:53.939 --> 00:14:55.699
not just the New Testament.

00:14:55.699 --> 00:14:58.899
I understand this morning that we often use the Roman's road

00:14:58.899 --> 00:15:01.259
and we deal with that, but I wanna remind you

00:15:01.259 --> 00:15:03.099
that in 1 Corinthians chapter 15,

00:15:03.099 --> 00:15:08.099
the great passage there on the resurrection,

00:15:08.299 --> 00:15:10.739
remember that Paul, as he begins that passage,

00:15:10.739 --> 00:15:15.739
he said that Christ died according to the Scriptures,

00:15:16.219 --> 00:15:18.259
and that he was buried and he rose again

00:15:18.259 --> 00:15:20.519
according to the Scriptures.

00:15:20.519 --> 00:15:22.259
What Scriptures are we referring to?

00:15:22.259 --> 00:15:24.059
He's referring to the Old Testament,

00:15:24.059 --> 00:15:26.539
and we find that the Old Testament reveals,

00:15:26.539 --> 00:15:28.679
it makes us wise unto salvation,

00:15:28.679 --> 00:15:31.379
and yes, I'm thankful for the progressive revelation

00:15:31.379 --> 00:15:33.419
that we have the whole Bible now,

00:15:33.419 --> 00:15:36.019
but you understand that you can take the Old Testament

00:15:36.019 --> 00:15:39.459
and you can lead somebody to Christ from the Old Testament.

00:15:39.459 --> 00:15:41.339
You can show them that they're a sinner

00:15:41.339 --> 00:15:42.659
and that they're in need of a savior

00:15:42.659 --> 00:15:44.939
and that the Messiah is Jesus.

00:15:44.939 --> 00:15:48.099
Listen, when Paul reasoned with them out of the Scriptures

00:15:48.099 --> 00:15:50.219
that this Jesus is the Christ,

00:15:50.219 --> 00:15:51.919
he was using the Old Testament.

00:15:53.239 --> 00:15:54.699
That's what he had available.

00:15:54.699 --> 00:15:57.899
And so this morning, we can rejoice in understanding

00:15:57.899 --> 00:16:00.839
this instruction and influence in the life

00:16:00.839 --> 00:16:03.979
of young Timothy, and as he's going through

00:16:03.979 --> 00:16:06.899
and he's being mentored and he's growing in grace

00:16:06.899 --> 00:16:10.259
and knowledge of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ,

00:16:10.259 --> 00:16:14.019
it's this equipping that is being given to Timothy

00:16:14.019 --> 00:16:19.019
so that he can press on in the days of adversity,

00:16:19.139 --> 00:16:21.619
in the evil days, in the perilous times.

00:16:21.619 --> 00:16:24.459
Can you think this morning of someone

00:16:24.459 --> 00:16:27.279
that has instructed you, that has influenced you,

00:16:27.279 --> 00:16:30.539
someone that has invested in you

00:16:30.539 --> 00:16:32.739
so that they might enable you,

00:16:32.739 --> 00:16:36.699
God use them to help you grow in your life,

00:16:37.539 --> 00:16:41.299
in your Christian walk, so that you too could press on

00:16:41.299 --> 00:16:44.159
in a time of adversity and great difficulty.

00:16:45.139 --> 00:16:49.339
We find not only is this equipping reference

00:16:49.339 --> 00:16:52.739
with regard to the influence and the instruction

00:16:52.739 --> 00:16:55.099
that Timothy received in his life,

00:16:55.099 --> 00:16:59.479
but I see also that God equips us through his word.

00:16:59.479 --> 00:17:01.979
Because the text of Scripture is one of the texts

00:17:01.979 --> 00:17:06.379
that we so often go to with regard to the inspiration

00:17:06.379 --> 00:17:08.859
and the profitability of God's word.

00:17:08.859 --> 00:17:10.899
In verse 16, it's a known Scripture,

00:17:10.899 --> 00:17:13.379
a verse that many of us have memorized.

00:17:13.379 --> 00:17:15.739
And we talk about as a Baptist,

00:17:15.739 --> 00:17:20.079
that the Bible is our sole authority for faith and practice.

00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:21.739
And here, a verse of Scripture

00:17:21.739 --> 00:17:25.819
that we'd often turn to in verse 16, all Scripture.

00:17:25.819 --> 00:17:27.099
How much?

00:17:27.099 --> 00:17:28.299
All of it.

00:17:28.299 --> 00:17:29.819
Remember, all means all, right?

00:17:29.819 --> 00:17:31.299
And that's all that all means.

00:17:31.299 --> 00:17:36.299
He says, all Scripture is given by inspiration of God.

00:17:36.899 --> 00:17:40.339
And so we find the means by which God gives his word.

00:17:40.339 --> 00:17:42.879
Remember, that holy men of God spake

00:17:42.879 --> 00:17:45.099
as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.

00:17:45.099 --> 00:17:48.899
It is not just that Isaiah or Jeremiah or Paul

00:17:48.899 --> 00:17:52.179
or any other human penman to God's word

00:17:52.179 --> 00:17:54.139
decided on some certain day,

00:17:54.139 --> 00:17:56.719
you know what, I think I'm gonna write Scripture today.

00:17:56.719 --> 00:17:57.559
It's not how it worked.

00:17:57.559 --> 00:17:58.859
It wasn't the will of man.

00:17:58.859 --> 00:18:00.739
It was God breathed.

00:18:01.719 --> 00:18:03.919
And God gave the word.

00:18:04.919 --> 00:18:06.759
Praise the Lord for that.

00:18:06.759 --> 00:18:08.199
And we find that it says,

00:18:08.199 --> 00:18:10.759
not only is all Scripture given by inspiration of God,

00:18:10.759 --> 00:18:13.559
but it says, and is profitable.

00:18:13.559 --> 00:18:16.959
Have you found that God's word is profitable in your life?

00:18:16.959 --> 00:18:19.359
Oh, I'm so thankful for God's word.

00:18:19.359 --> 00:18:22.639
It tells us these areas in which God's word is profitable

00:18:22.639 --> 00:18:27.039
for doctrine, for reproof, for correction,

00:18:27.039 --> 00:18:29.479
for instruction in righteousness.

00:18:29.479 --> 00:18:31.459
We're gonna deal with verse 17 in just a moment,

00:18:31.459 --> 00:18:33.359
but let's break down verse number 16,

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:36.919
because we know that Timothy knew God's word from a child.

00:18:36.919 --> 00:18:38.640
We see that in verse 15.

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:41.640
And we find that now in verse 16,

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:45.640
that God is saying, listen, my word is profitable.

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:47.159
My word is profitable.

00:18:47.159 --> 00:18:49.479
I'm thankful we could speak all day

00:18:49.479 --> 00:18:51.679
about how great God's word is

00:18:51.679 --> 00:18:54.279
and how it's been inspired and it's preserved

00:18:54.279 --> 00:18:57.079
and it's perfect and it's just powerful.

00:18:57.079 --> 00:18:58.599
I mean, it's profitable for us.

00:18:58.599 --> 00:19:00.000
What a blessing to think about

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.979
all of the aspects of God's word.

00:19:03.599 --> 00:19:04.440
But when we come to this verse

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:05.619
and we see that the Bible says

00:19:05.619 --> 00:19:07.779
that God's word is profitable,

00:19:07.779 --> 00:19:10.539
notice first of all, it says for doctrine.

00:19:11.419 --> 00:19:13.440
Why do you believe what you believe?

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:16.739
You ever have somebody question you on that?

00:19:16.739 --> 00:19:17.940
Why do you believe that?

00:19:19.399 --> 00:19:20.739
Listen, if your answer is

00:19:20.739 --> 00:19:22.959
because that's what my church teaches,

00:19:22.959 --> 00:19:24.820
it's not a good answer.

00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:28.179
If your answer is, well, that's what my pastor said,

00:19:28.179 --> 00:19:29.380
it's not a good answer.

00:19:30.219 --> 00:19:32.339
Why do I believe what I believe?

00:19:32.339 --> 00:19:35.700
Well, God's word is profitable for doctrine.

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:37.579
You know, doctrine is important.

00:19:37.579 --> 00:19:39.579
Doctrine matters.

00:19:39.579 --> 00:19:41.219
There's some today that are running around

00:19:41.219 --> 00:19:42.579
with the idea of, you know,

00:19:42.579 --> 00:19:44.140
doctrine really isn't that important.

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:46.219
We don't really need to major on that too much

00:19:46.219 --> 00:19:47.500
and we can kind of put some of...

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:49.260
No, doctrine matters.

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:50.739
You know, many times throughout the scriptures,

00:19:50.739 --> 00:19:53.739
you read about sound doctrine

00:19:53.739 --> 00:19:56.820
and the importance of having doctrine that is right.

00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:58.640
And how do we get our doctrine?

00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:00.140
How do we get our beliefs?

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:04.140
Well, from God's Word, because God's Word is profitable for doctrine.

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:08.140
And how is it that we're able to know as we begin to think about this truth

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:13.140
with regard to it being profitable for doctrine, but it also says for reproof.

00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:18.140
You know, there are some things that you believed before that are not right,

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:22.140
and the Bible reproves you.

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:24.140
It's good for reproof.

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:28.140
And we think about that rebuke, those that are in error.

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:33.140
Listen, before I got saved, I had some beliefs that were contrary to what this book teaches.

00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:36.140
How about you? Did you have beliefs that were contrary to what this book...

00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:39.140
You know one of the things that I believed before I ever got saved?

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:43.140
I believed that if you were good enough, somehow at the end it would all just kind of work out.

00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:46.140
I believed that. I don't know why I believed that.

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:48.140
I never sat in a class where anyone taught me that.

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:50.140
It was just different things that I heard here and there.

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:52.140
And I really just kind of had that idea.

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:56.140
And then all of a sudden, somebody shares the Bible with me

00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:58.140
and shares the Word of God with me,

00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:01.140
that it's not by my own works of righteousness,

00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:03.140
for by grace are you saved through faith,

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:05.140
and that not of yourselves, but of the gift of God,

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:07.140
not of works, lest any man should boast.

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:10.140
And it was like I got punched right between the eyeballs

00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:14.140
and thought, you know what? What I've been believing is not right.

00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:17.140
It reproved me.

00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:21.140
You know, there are some things that you can believe that are still not right,

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:25.140
and God's Word is what reproves us.

00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:28.140
It's good for, notice, doctrine.

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:32.140
It's profitable for doctrine, but also for reproof.

00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:35.140
And then it says this, for correction.

00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:40.140
Now think about this. I'm reproved, but at the same time I'm corrected.

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:44.140
No, that's wrong thinking, and here's the right thinking.

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:48.140
That's not right according to the Bible. That's wrong.

00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:51.140
And here's the correct way to think.

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:53.140
I believe to think about this this way.

00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:59.140
Listen, you understand this morning, the Bible is always right.

00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:02.140
So you know what that means?

00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:06.140
We're wrong at times, because the Bible is always right.

00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:09.140
You say, well, I always thought. No, no, no, no.

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:12.140
What did God say? Amen?

00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:15.140
Because the Bible is always right.

00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:19.140
And it's good, it's profitable for correction.

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:22.140
It corrects us.

00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:27.140
We do not correct it.

00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:30.140
We don't correct the Bible. The Bible corrects us.

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:36.140
Listen, if we come to a place and our thinking is different than what God's Word says,

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:42.140
then what needs to happen is my thinking needs to become aligned with what God's Word says.

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:48.140
I do not seek to change God's Word to align with my thinking.

00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:50.140
Does that make sense this morning?

00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:53.140
Do you know there are people that have done that?

00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:56.140
There are Bible translations that exist today.

00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:59.140
There are cults that exist today.

00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:02.140
Listen, you understand, I normally don't call things out from the pulpit in this way,

00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:07.140
but I'll tell you, the Jehovah Witnesses used to use the King James Bible.

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:11.140
But you know what the problem was with the Jehovah Witnesses and the King James Bible?

00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:17.140
The problem was that what they taught and what they believed didn't line up with what the Bible said.

00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:20.140
And so all of a sudden, somebody would start reading the Bible,

00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:24.140
and they'd say, well, but you're saying this, and the Bible says this.

00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:28.140
So you know what they did? They wrote their own Bible, the New World Translation.

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:33.140
I mean, listen, this is nothing new. You can go almost anywhere on the Internet and find that.

00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:36.140
Now, they won't admit it to you, but that's what they did.

00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:41.140
And so they wrote a new Bible to align with their teaching.

00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:44.140
That's not how it works.

00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:48.140
Because the Bible, all Scripture, is given by inspiration of God.

00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:51.140
You say, well, I always thought, you know, just follow your heart.

00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:55.140
Do you know that God's Word says don't follow your heart?

00:23:55.140 --> 00:24:00.140
Your heart is wicked, deceitful.

00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:03.140
You know how many people, I mean, Christians that are, just follow your heart.

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:07.140
Where did you, the Bible forbids us to follow our heart.

00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:11.140
We're to follow God. We're to follow His Word.

00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:17.140
And so God's Word is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction.

00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:22.140
Notice at the end of verse number 16, for instruction in righteousness.

00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:25.140
That idea of training and teaching.

00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:31.140
Do you remember that Jesus said this when He gave the Great Commission in Matthew's record?

00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:35.140
He says this, that we're to go and we're to preach the Gospel.

00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:38.140
We're to give the truth of the Gospel. We're then to baptize.

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:44.140
And teaching them all things whatsoever I have commanded thee.

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:47.140
What is that? Well, that's discipleship.

00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:50.140
That's training. That's teaching.

00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:54.140
That's helping people. Listen, God's Word is profitable for instruction.

00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:57.140
We need instruction.

00:24:57.140 --> 00:25:00.140
We need God's Word to instruct us.

00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:06.140
And we come to this passage of Scripture and we consider the equipping that Timothy received,

00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:13.140
but also the equipping that we too have also received in the fact that God has preserved His Word for us.

00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:18.140
And we have the Bible this morning and God's Word is profitable for us.

00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:22.140
And listen, we can understand what is right.

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:24.140
We can understand what is wrong.

00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:28.140
We can understand how to get what is wrong right.

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:31.140
And we can understand how to stay right.

00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:33.140
Why? Because we have a Bible.

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:43.140
I'm telling people today that they have the idea that the morals of a culture, of a society are dictated by the people.

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:47.140
No, our morals are dictated by God's Word.

00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:50.140
What is right? What is wrong?

00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:55.140
We find that God's Word is profitable, but I want you to notice verse 17.

00:25:55.140 --> 00:26:08.140
This is that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.

00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:16.140
This word, throughly furnished, by the way, a lot of people misquote it and say thoroughly, but it's throughly.

00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:24.140
The idea of these words, throughly furnished, literally mean to be fully equipped with nothing lacking.

00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:26.140
That's what it means.

00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:30.140
When it talks about perfect, it's not talking about sinless perfection.

00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:32.140
It's talking about being complete in Christ.

00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:37.140
And we find here that it says, listen, God's Word is profitable for all these things.

00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:39.140
Why? Because it is God's Word.

00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:47.140
Because all Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and therefore it's profitable for the doctrine, reproof, correction, instruction.

00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:55.140
But then we find that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.

00:26:55.140 --> 00:27:02.140
That God's Word fully equips the child of God for everything that we will face in life.

00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:05.140
We come to a situation in life.

00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:11.140
What is it that we do? How do we handle the circumstances and the situations that we face?

00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:21.140
We better run to God's Word and seek what God's truth is to guide us and direct us in the path that we should go.

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:24.140
You say, well, it doesn't say it in black and white.

00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:34.140
There are principles in God's Word that are applicable in a broad array of situations and circumstances that God's people will face in life.

00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:45.140
And we take those principles, and from the principles that God gives us, we determine the will of God and the path by which we go.

00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:48.140
We're fully equipped.

00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:50.140
You know what's sad?

00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:59.140
Statistics tell us that people that have been saved for decades, I mean professing Christians,

00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:04.140
admit to have never reading the Bible cover to cover.

00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:07.140
They've never read the whole of Scripture.

00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:15.140
There are testimonies of people that say they go to church every week, they identify as being a Christian, a born-again believer,

00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:20.140
but they do not read the Bible regularly.

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:26.140
They neglect, I mean, they're on their social media, they're watching their Fox News,

00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:32.140
and they're listening to this report, and that report, and so on and so forth, but they're neglecting this book.

00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:37.140
The statistics are out there.

00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:46.140
I don't put everything in statistics, but there's something about statistics that should cause us to be concerned,

00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:48.140
to have some level of alarm.

00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:52.140
And I do not put my head in the sand when you look at the statistics and say,

00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:56.140
well, we're exempt from all of that. None of us are in that situation.

00:28:56.140 --> 00:29:01.140
No. The reality is that there are times in which people take their Bible,

00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:05.140
and they stick it on a shelf somewhere, and they dust it off on Sunday morning,

00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:07.140
and they bring it back to church with them.

00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:09.140
But they're not reading it throughout the week.

00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:17.140
So guess what? You're lacking the equipping, because it's God's Word.

00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:20.140
I believe that as you look at this and you think about the equipping,

00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:26.140
the instruction of a grandmother, of a mother, the instruction and the mentorship of Paul,

00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:30.140
we could think about it in the category this morning of being in church.

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:35.140
You know, when we willingly—I'm talking about with no good reason.

00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:38.140
We just decide that we're going to miss church for some reason.

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:41.140
We're missing out on the equipping.

00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:44.140
We're missing out on what God has for us.

00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:49.140
So I can just catch it on livestream. I can just catch it on YouTube. I can just whatever.

00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:55.140
No, no. There's something so much more to gathering together as a people of God

00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:59.140
than just catching some kind of YouTube video down the line.

00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:00.140
Talk to you soon.

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:02.980
It's totally different.

00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:07.840
In this morning, Timothy was equipped to press on.

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:12.840
And I would say to you that God has given us all things that pertain unto life and godliness.

00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:19.340
God has given to us everything we need in order to be equipped to press on.

00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:23.500
He didn't just drop us in a desert somewhere and say, evil men and seducers are gonna wax

00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:26.580
and worse and worse, it's perilous times and good luck.

00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:29.340
No, that's not what God did.

00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:31.260
God's equipped us.

00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:33.420
You say, but it's hard.

00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:36.460
There's fighting, there's turmoil, there's opposition.

00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:39.620
Yes, Paul dealt with that in the previous text of Scripture.

00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:42.420
I preached it last week.

00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:49.020
But God's equipped you and he's equipped me and he's equipped his people to press on in

00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:52.700
the face of all of those things.

00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:56.060
And how grateful we ought to be this morning.

00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:58.500
Are we equipped to press on?

00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:01.260
Are we accepting what God is giving us?

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:06.540
Are we taking the Bible, are we seeking as we read the Bible to try to correct it?

00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:09.260
Or are we allowing the Bible to correct us?

00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:14.380
When we come to a passage of Scripture that kind of hits us and kind of rattles us and

00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:20.620
shakes us that, man, I've not been doing what I should be doing or I've been doing some

00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:24.980
things I shouldn't be doing and we come to passages of Scripture like that, do we allow

00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:28.780
God's Word to change us or do we excuse the behavior?

00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:33.020
When I come to a passage of Scripture that tells me that God hears me when I complain

00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:37.060
and God's not happy, he's not pleased with my complaining, do I say, well, that was for

00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:41.860
the Israelites and that was for then and this is different because I have some...

00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:44.100
No, no, no.

00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:47.420
God hears us.

00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:51.580
God said in everything give thanks for this is the will of God and Christ Jesus concerning

00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:52.580
you.

00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:54.260
Well, you don't know how bad it is.

00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:55.460
No, no, no.

00:31:55.460 --> 00:32:00.220
You don't know how good God is, amen?

00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:06.260
Because as bad as it is, as bad as your circumstance might be, you're still going to heaven if

00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:08.260
you're saved.

00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:11.140
No man can take that from you, amen?

00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:13.300
By the way, no one can take your joy.

00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:14.860
That's what the Bible says.

00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:16.180
But you know what you do?

00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:18.060
You give up your joy.

00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:19.060
You give up your joy.

00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:23.980
There are things that are joy thieves, sin is a joy thief.

00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:28.220
That's why David says, restore unto me the joy of thy salvation.

00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:33.100
But Jesus says that your joy might be full, that you might have that joy.

00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:36.140
Listen, God gave us peace.

00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:39.660
Jesus said, my peace give I unto thee.

00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:41.540
Not as the world giveth.

00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:42.980
His peace is a perfect peace.

00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:45.660
His peace is a peace that passeth all understanding.

00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:51.020
But the reality is that if we take and we step back from God's word and say, well, that's

00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:54.940
just coming from a different perspective and you don't understand what I'm dealing with

00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:59.300
and I have a right to be angry and I have a right to complain and I have, you've missed

00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:01.700
the point.

00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:03.940
You don't know how good God is.

00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:07.940
And by the way, you don't know how God is working.

00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:12.940
You understand this morning that in John chapter 11 that Jesus hears word that Lazarus, he

00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:18.740
whom thou loveth, is sick.

00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:22.020
And Jesus delays his departure.

00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:24.100
Why?

00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:30.420
Because Jesus was up to something miraculous, something they'd never seen before.

00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:34.820
A man that has been dead for four days, going to raise him from the dead.

00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:40.300
Do you know that there are times in your life, in my life, that God is working in circumstances

00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:46.260
and situations and He's maybe, maybe He's allowed something to happen to bring somebody

00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:49.380
into my life, to bring a person.

00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:51.900
You say, man, why did my car break down?

00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:54.740
This isn't, why did my appliance break?

00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:56.060
Why did this happen?

00:33:56.060 --> 00:34:01.180
Why did I sprain my ankle again or break this or need dental work?

00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:05.140
Have you ever thought that maybe God would allow those things so that you could be His

00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:09.580
witness to those individuals?

00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:12.100
Missionaries shared a testimony with us years ago that we supported.

00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:15.740
They're not on the field anymore, but they shared a testimony of being in a situation

00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:21.580
where their washing machine broke and there was no one remotely close to where they were

00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:25.700
that they could either buy a new washing machine or get it repaired.

00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:30.060
They were in a very remote area, it was a very difficult situation, and they were praying

00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:33.380
and they were seeking and trying to figure out how to handle this thing.

00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:38.100
And eventually, after some time, they found out about a repair serviceman that was a few

00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:42.980
hours away that they could get in contact with and bring them in to be able to take

00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:44.100
care of this.

00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:49.660
And make a long story short, after that repair individual got there to work on their washer,

00:34:49.660 --> 00:34:54.500
they shared the gospel with them, the man got saved, and they found out that that man

00:34:54.500 --> 00:35:03.140
had a mother that had been praying for 15 years that he would get saved.

00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:08.500
What happened if that repairman showed up and the Christian just complained the whole

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:11.740
time about, do you know, I have loads of laundry.

00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:12.740
I got kids.

00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:13.740
I got this.

00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:14.740
I got that.

00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:17.460
And I haven't been able to…

00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:19.500
How do we deal with things in life?

00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:21.180
God has a purpose.

00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:23.540
God has a plan.

00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:30.580
And we only know that through getting into this book, through being equipped with the

00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:34.140
truth of God's Word.

00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:36.020
Timothy was equipped, we are equipped.

00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:42.500
Number two, not only have we been equipped to press on, but we have been encouraged to

00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:43.500
press on.

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:47.700
Notice, if you will, as we enter into the fourth chapter, and remember that chapter

00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:54.740
divisions are there as a result of ease of finding passages of Scripture, but I really

00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:59.620
find some continuity between these verses of Scripture.

00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:07.500
And we find that Paul, after telling Timothy of the truth with regard to the perilous times

00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:14.120
and his own experience and then giving him this charge that he gives to continue in verse

00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:19.700
number 14 and speaking about the influence in his life and the equipping that he's received,

00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:26.420
he then encourages him, I charge thee to begin chapter number four, therefore before God

00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:32.420
and the Lord Jesus Christ who shall judge the quick and the dead at His appearing and

00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:33.420
His kingdom.

00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:37.260
Listen, we've been encouraged to press on.

00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:41.820
The first encouragement I believe that we receive for pressing on is that Jesus is coming

00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:42.820
again.

00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:47.900
You read verse number one of the Bible says that the Lord Jesus Christ who shall judge

00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:52.340
the quick and the dead at His appearing and His kingdom.

00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:56.900
We begin to think about this and understand, and of course we've made known, I mentioned

00:36:56.900 --> 00:37:00.820
it just a few weeks ago, the aspects of the return of Christ.

00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:05.460
There's a rapture that takes place when the church is called out of here, followed by

00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:10.380
seven years of tribulation, followed by the return of Christ when we come back with Him

00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:13.460
and we're going to have the battle of Armageddon and all that's going to take place and then

00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:18.980
Christ is going to set up His kingdom here on earth, the millennial kingdom and reign

00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:20.860
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:26.180
And we find that this truth of judgment, the truth that's given there, but we're reminded

00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:29.500
of the fact that Jesus is coming.

00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:36.300
What a joy, what an encouragement to the believer to understand that our Savior is coming.

00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:41.620
We don't know the day, we don't know the hour, but we can rest assured that our Savior is

00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:42.820
coming.

00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:48.220
We find that the disciples there in Acts chapter number one, when they saw the ascension, they

00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:53.580
stand and they're looking steadfastly into heaven, but they hear those words, this same

00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:59.620
Jesus which you've seen go up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner.

00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:00.620
And what were they to do?

00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:04.660
Well, they're to be busy about doing what God told them to do and what He just told

00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:08.500
them to do was to be witnesses.

00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:15.860
And I believe that as you read the book of Acts, one of the reasons that you see the

00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:22.460
gospel being preached and the word going forth and the world being turned upside down

00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:27.260
is because there was a group of believers that understood Jesus is coming back.

00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:31.220
They didn't know when, but they were encouraged that their Savior was returning.

00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:37.260
I think about the truth of verse number one and how I'm encouraged, listen, the reality

00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:41.940
this morning when we speak about the rapture for the people of God, the children of God,

00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:48.700
when we speak about that rapture, I simply ask this, are you ready or will you be ashamed?

00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:52.260
Because really the Bible gives us both of those aspects.

00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:56.460
The Bible talks to us about it in 1 John chapter two at the end, at the beginning of 1 John

00:38:56.460 --> 00:39:00.739
chapter number three, that we could be ashamed at His appearing.

00:39:00.739 --> 00:39:06.179
I hope this morning that there's not one person sitting here this morning that would be ashamed

00:39:06.179 --> 00:39:07.619
at the appearing of the Lord Jesus.

00:39:07.619 --> 00:39:12.540
I mean, if He came back right this moment, would you be ashamed?

00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:17.580
I hope that you'd be ready, you'd be ready for the coming of the Lord.

00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:26.100
To understand that He is coming, that encourages me to press on, that encourages me to do what

00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:31.100
He's called me to do, to be faithful until the end.

00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:33.619
Because He's coming, He's going to return.

00:39:33.619 --> 00:39:38.540
This is a priority that is given in verse number two on the preaching of God's word.

00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:43.700
The Bible says, preach the word, be instant in seas and out of seas, and reprove, rebuke,

00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:46.220
exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.

00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:52.299
The priority that's here, the importance for Timothy to always be ready, to be fully prepared.

00:39:52.299 --> 00:39:56.660
Now we understand this morning that this is a letter written to Timothy.

00:39:56.660 --> 00:40:00.179
We understand that in such a letter that's written to Timothy.

00:40:00.179 --> 00:40:04.219
God is speaking to Timothy as the position

00:40:04.219 --> 00:40:07.459
that he had there in Ephesus and his responsibility

00:40:07.459 --> 00:40:10.419
of preaching the word and all that would take place

00:40:10.419 --> 00:40:13.459
even as we conclude it, the third chapter,

00:40:13.459 --> 00:40:15.219
that the man of God may be perfect,

00:40:15.219 --> 00:40:17.059
throughly furnished unto all good works.

00:40:17.059 --> 00:40:19.499
But we find this morning that when we look

00:40:19.499 --> 00:40:22.539
at the interpretation, we find that it's a letter,

00:40:22.539 --> 00:40:25.059
a book that's written specifically to Timothy,

00:40:25.059 --> 00:40:27.619
but God chose to preserve it.

00:40:27.659 --> 00:40:31.299
And so in so doing, there are many applications.

00:40:31.299 --> 00:40:34.179
And I believe this morning that yes, Timothy,

00:40:34.179 --> 00:40:37.019
and yes, every pastor, even often as we refer

00:40:37.019 --> 00:40:39.699
to these books as being the pastoral epistles,

00:40:39.699 --> 00:40:41.779
that every pastor ought to be ready

00:40:41.779 --> 00:40:44.059
and prepared to preach the word.

00:40:44.059 --> 00:40:46.179
Can I say for every child of God

00:40:46.179 --> 00:40:48.739
that we ought to be ready to give an answer

00:40:48.739 --> 00:40:50.679
for the hope that lieth within us?

00:40:50.679 --> 00:40:54.099
That we ought to be ready to give the word.

00:40:54.099 --> 00:40:56.059
When somebody says to you, what do you believe?

00:40:56.059 --> 00:40:57.459
Why do you believe?

00:40:58.299 --> 00:40:59.139
What do you think about this?

00:40:59.139 --> 00:40:59.959
What do you think about that?

00:40:59.959 --> 00:41:03.179
How often those types of conversations come up,

00:41:03.179 --> 00:41:06.019
and they wanna know what you believe about a certain thing,

00:41:06.019 --> 00:41:09.339
and what's your opinion on, and they fill in the blank.

00:41:09.339 --> 00:41:11.499
Listen, it really doesn't matter what your opinion is.

00:41:11.499 --> 00:41:13.259
It doesn't really matter what my opinion is.

00:41:13.259 --> 00:41:16.379
All that matters is what God said.

00:41:16.379 --> 00:41:19.139
And I must know what God said.

00:41:19.139 --> 00:41:21.259
When Paul is writing to Timothy,

00:41:21.259 --> 00:41:23.899
and Timothy is going to deal with those false teachers,

00:41:23.899 --> 00:41:24.979
and he's gonna deal with everything

00:41:24.979 --> 00:41:26.619
that's going on at Ephesus,

00:41:26.619 --> 00:41:29.979
and seek to try to give the truth there,

00:41:29.979 --> 00:41:32.899
he needed to preach the word.

00:41:32.899 --> 00:41:35.779
It's the word that will change somebody's mind.

00:41:35.779 --> 00:41:37.899
Your cue arguments don't matter.

00:41:41.099 --> 00:41:42.559
You say, that's offensive.

00:41:42.559 --> 00:41:44.899
I'm sorry, I don't mean to be offensive.

00:41:44.899 --> 00:41:47.899
I'm just simply saying, you need the Bible.

00:41:47.899 --> 00:41:49.379
It's the Bible that's powerful.

00:41:49.379 --> 00:41:51.959
It's not your words, it's not my words.

00:41:51.959 --> 00:41:55.579
It's not in waxing eloquent and doing all of that.

00:41:55.579 --> 00:41:58.539
Paul says that he had the power of God

00:41:58.539 --> 00:41:59.939
when he goes to Corinth.

00:41:59.939 --> 00:42:03.139
He didn't try to give them all these words.

00:42:03.139 --> 00:42:05.259
In fact, in 1 Corinthians chapter one,

00:42:05.259 --> 00:42:07.499
and then even going into chapter number two,

00:42:07.499 --> 00:42:09.419
he says, listen, in chapter two, verse four,

00:42:09.419 --> 00:42:12.139
my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words

00:42:12.139 --> 00:42:15.279
of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the spirit of power

00:42:15.279 --> 00:42:17.500
that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men,

00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:19.539
but in the power of God.

00:42:20.919 --> 00:42:21.819
Listen, it's God's word.

00:42:21.819 --> 00:42:24.019
God's word changed my life.

00:42:24.019 --> 00:42:26.139
God's word's still changing my life.

00:42:27.339 --> 00:42:28.599
Can God use people?

00:42:28.599 --> 00:42:31.000
Can God use illustrations and analogies

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:32.019
and so on and so forth?

00:42:32.019 --> 00:42:33.659
Sure, but I can tell you this,

00:42:33.659 --> 00:42:35.699
I've listened to preaching before

00:42:35.699 --> 00:42:38.299
that was one verse of scripture followed by story

00:42:38.299 --> 00:42:41.979
after story after story after story after story.

00:42:41.979 --> 00:42:43.379
And you know what I remember?

00:42:43.379 --> 00:42:44.299
The story.

00:42:48.679 --> 00:42:50.339
God said, preach the word.

00:42:50.339 --> 00:42:52.859
I'm not trying to attack anyone or criticize anyone.

00:42:52.859 --> 00:42:55.500
I'm simply saying, God said, preach the word.

00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:57.559
You gotta know the Bible.

00:42:57.559 --> 00:42:59.699
It's gotta be in your heart.

00:42:59.699 --> 00:43:04.179
He equipped us and then he encourages us to press on.

00:43:04.179 --> 00:43:06.379
Notice in verses three and four,

00:43:06.379 --> 00:43:08.099
the Bible says, for the time will come

00:43:08.099 --> 00:43:10.779
when they will not endure sound doctrine,

00:43:10.779 --> 00:43:12.979
but after their own loss shall they heap to themselves

00:43:12.979 --> 00:43:14.339
teachers having itching ears,

00:43:14.339 --> 00:43:17.259
and they shall turn away their ears from the truth

00:43:17.259 --> 00:43:18.859
and shall be turned into fables.

00:43:18.859 --> 00:43:22.019
Now, if I could just illustrate this just for a moment

00:43:22.019 --> 00:43:25.419
in this way, in chapter number three,

00:43:25.419 --> 00:43:28.539
God says to Timothy, in the last days,

00:43:28.539 --> 00:43:30.199
perilous times are gonna come.

00:43:30.199 --> 00:43:33.099
Verse 13, evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse,

00:43:33.099 --> 00:43:34.639
deceiving and being deceived.

00:43:36.299 --> 00:43:38.279
Then in chapter four and verses three and four,

00:43:38.279 --> 00:43:39.699
he says, the time's gonna come

00:43:39.699 --> 00:43:41.739
when they're not gonna endure sound doctrine.

00:43:41.739 --> 00:43:43.539
They're gonna, according to verse number four,

00:43:43.539 --> 00:43:45.859
turn away their ears from the truth

00:43:45.859 --> 00:43:47.659
and shall be turned into fables.

00:43:47.659 --> 00:43:50.619
So if you think about those two bookends, if you will,

00:43:50.619 --> 00:43:52.419
that there's perilous times,

00:43:52.419 --> 00:43:54.859
evil men and seducers are gonna wax worse and worse,

00:43:54.859 --> 00:43:56.659
they're not gonna endure sound doctrine,

00:43:56.659 --> 00:43:58.579
they're gonna turn away from the truth,

00:43:58.579 --> 00:44:00.899
and in the middle of that, you know what God says?

00:44:00.899 --> 00:44:01.739
Press on.

00:44:03.259 --> 00:44:04.219
Continue.

00:44:04.219 --> 00:44:05.059
Why?

00:44:05.059 --> 00:44:07.379
It doesn't matter what their response is.

00:44:07.379 --> 00:44:10.619
You're not doing it for the response.

00:44:10.619 --> 00:44:13.299
You're doing it for the Savior.

00:44:13.299 --> 00:44:16.820
What you do must be motivated out of love for God.

00:44:17.899 --> 00:44:19.779
And because I love him, I love him

00:44:19.779 --> 00:44:21.100
because he first loved me,

00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:23.320
but if I love him as I ought to love him,

00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:24.779
yes, I'm gonna love people,

00:44:24.779 --> 00:44:26.979
but loving people and preaching the truth

00:44:26.979 --> 00:44:28.940
and doing what God's called me to do

00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:32.359
is not dependent on the response.

00:44:33.419 --> 00:44:35.919
You know how many times the response is negative?

00:44:37.019 --> 00:44:38.979
Does it mean that we just quit and give up and say,

00:44:38.979 --> 00:44:41.079
well, no, I must be focused on the fact

00:44:41.079 --> 00:44:43.660
that I'm doing it for Jesus.

00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:45.339
I'm doing it for my Savior.

00:44:45.339 --> 00:44:47.619
I'm doing it for the one that loves me.

00:44:47.619 --> 00:44:49.320
I'm doing it for the one that we sang

00:44:49.839 --> 00:44:51.799
about this morning, amazing love,

00:44:51.799 --> 00:44:56.799
that thou, my God, should die for me.

00:44:56.799 --> 00:44:59.399
Man, I can't, it's hard to wrap my mind around that

00:44:59.399 --> 00:45:01.199
every time we sing that song.

00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:05.359
The God of the universe,

00:45:05.359 --> 00:45:07.279
the one who said, let there be light,

00:45:07.279 --> 00:45:08.259
and there was light,

00:45:08.259 --> 00:45:10.720
the one who formed you, that created you,

00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:12.979
he died for you.

00:45:13.919 --> 00:45:14.940
What love.

00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:19.979
The encouragement here in 2 Timothy chapter four

00:45:19.979 --> 00:45:22.339
in verses three and four is that, listen,

00:45:22.339 --> 00:45:25.339
the response of the people should not discourage us.

00:45:26.739 --> 00:45:29.859
Again, God informed us, God made us aware of it,

00:45:29.859 --> 00:45:32.820
but we must remember that we serve the Lord

00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:37.299
and that one day we will stand before him.

00:45:37.299 --> 00:45:38.979
And as we serve Christ and we know

00:45:38.979 --> 00:45:40.539
that we'll stand before him,

00:45:40.539 --> 00:45:43.339
I'm encouraged to keep on keeping on.

00:45:44.299 --> 00:45:46.380
You know, it's easy to press on

00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:48.419
when there's a whole group of people behind you

00:45:48.419 --> 00:45:50.539
and everybody's just cheering you on

00:45:50.539 --> 00:45:51.820
and all that kind of thing,

00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:53.459
and I mean, things are going great

00:45:53.459 --> 00:45:56.320
and everything's kind of quote unquote perfect.

00:45:57.459 --> 00:45:59.299
It's a different thing when you kind of feel like

00:45:59.299 --> 00:46:02.419
you're having that wilderness experience.

00:46:02.419 --> 00:46:03.759
It's a different thing when you're having

00:46:03.759 --> 00:46:06.220
that valley experience,

00:46:07.779 --> 00:46:11.739
but we've been encouraged to press on, to press on.

00:46:13.539 --> 00:46:15.259
In verse number five, the Bible says,

00:46:15.259 --> 00:46:18.720
but watch thou in all things, endure afflictions,

00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:20.339
do the work of an evangelist,

00:46:20.339 --> 00:46:23.359
make full proof of thy ministry.

00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:27.059
We must determine to be faithful

00:46:27.059 --> 00:46:29.220
to do what God has called us to do.

00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:34.380
I know that we've said this often from the pulpit,

00:46:36.259 --> 00:46:38.639
but so many people struggle with answering the question,

00:46:38.639 --> 00:46:39.579
why am I here?

00:46:41.019 --> 00:46:42.559
But can I tell you that there's even times

00:46:42.559 --> 00:46:44.959
in which God's people struggle with,

00:46:44.959 --> 00:46:45.959
what does God want me to do?

00:46:45.959 --> 00:46:47.239
Why am I here?

00:46:47.239 --> 00:46:48.739
What is my purpose?

00:46:51.679 --> 00:46:53.699
God wants us to bring honor and glory to him

00:46:53.699 --> 00:46:54.839
through all that we do.

00:46:55.799 --> 00:46:57.959
Whether therefore you eat, drink, or whatsoever you do,

00:46:57.959 --> 00:46:59.739
do all to the glory of God.

00:47:02.919 --> 00:47:05.160
Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost

00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:06.519
which is in you, which you have of God,

00:47:06.519 --> 00:47:07.899
and you're not your own?

00:47:07.899 --> 00:47:09.440
For you're bought with a price.

00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:11.799
Therefore, glorify God.

00:47:11.799 --> 00:47:14.519
Your body and your spirit, they're his.

00:47:14.519 --> 00:47:16.279
1 Corinthians 6, 19 and 20.

00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:20.440
We need to be faithful.

00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:23.720
We're encouraged here to press on.

00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:26.139
You know the sad thing is,

00:47:28.039 --> 00:47:30.059
probably this morning, every single one of us

00:47:30.059 --> 00:47:33.940
can think of someone that quit along the way.

00:47:34.919 --> 00:47:36.199
They became a casualty.

00:47:37.239 --> 00:47:38.359
They didn't press on.

00:47:39.359 --> 00:47:42.479
I can tell you right now of pastors that quit.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.679
I can tell you of a man that was a pastor in a church

00:47:46.679 --> 00:47:48.160
and decided that it was more lucrative

00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:49.320
to go work for Chick-fil-A,

00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:51.500
and today he's working for Chick-fil-A.

00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:52.339
Quit.

00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:55.880
You say, that doesn't make any sense.

00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:58.320
It happens to people from the pulpit to the pew.

00:47:59.579 --> 00:48:00.660
No one's exempt.

00:48:02.759 --> 00:48:06.399
But we must determine that we're gonna press on.

00:48:06.399 --> 00:48:07.799
When things get challenging,

00:48:08.199 --> 00:48:10.160
when things get difficult,

00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:12.759
when we're kinda squeezed, if you will,

00:48:12.759 --> 00:48:13.959
what are we gonna do?

00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:20.720
This morning, in the midst of great wickedness,

00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:23.039
an environment that is hostile

00:48:23.039 --> 00:48:24.859
towards biblical Christianity,

00:48:25.919 --> 00:48:27.979
we must determine that we're gonna press on.

00:48:27.979 --> 00:48:29.479
We've been equipped to do so.

00:48:30.359 --> 00:48:32.979
We've been encouraged to do so.

00:48:32.979 --> 00:48:36.320
This morning, are we gonna press on?

00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:37.239
Are we gonna press on?

00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:41.159
Not by our own strength, but in his power.

00:48:41.159 --> 00:48:42.279
Are we gonna press on?

00:48:42.279 --> 00:48:44.159
Are we gonna say, listen, I'm just gonna keep on doing

00:48:44.159 --> 00:48:46.880
what God's called me to do until Jesus comes back.

00:48:47.839 --> 00:48:49.080
And it doesn't matter.

00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:50.779
We sing the song with the kids,

00:48:50.779 --> 00:48:53.640
but so often, we fail to be able to live it out

00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:56.140
in our own lives, though none go with me.

00:48:57.599 --> 00:49:01.239
Still, I will follow.

00:49:01.239 --> 00:49:02.080
Why?

00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:06.039
Because I have decided to follow Jesus.

00:49:06.039 --> 00:49:07.559
We say, following Jesus is easier

00:49:07.559 --> 00:49:10.359
when other people are with me, I understand.

00:49:10.359 --> 00:49:12.559
But then, none go with me.

00:49:12.559 --> 00:49:17.039
Still, I will follow, because God has equipped us.

00:49:17.039 --> 00:49:18.719
Listen, you've been equipped this morning.

00:49:18.719 --> 00:49:20.559
You say, I don't feel equipped.

00:49:20.559 --> 00:49:22.159
Maybe you've neglected some things

00:49:22.159 --> 00:49:24.179
that are available to you

00:49:24.179 --> 00:49:27.119
that have left you feeling ill-equipped.

00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:30.440
You've been encouraged to press on.

00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:33.640
So the question for Timothy,

00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:35.679
and the question for us this morning,

00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:38.279
is will we press on?

00:49:38.279 --> 00:49:39.119
Let's pray together.

00:49:39.119 --> 00:49:40.559
Father, we love you.

00:49:40.559 --> 00:49:41.799
We thank you for loving us.

00:49:41.799 --> 00:49:43.799
We thank you for your word,

00:49:43.799 --> 00:49:45.919
for the truth that's contained therein.

00:49:45.919 --> 00:49:49.159
We thank you, God, for the equipping.

00:49:49.159 --> 00:49:53.960
We thank you for the encouraging that you give us.

00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:56.559
Lord, I pray that you would help us this morning.

00:49:58.679 --> 00:50:00.000
Maybe there's someone that says,

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:05.639
don't feel equipped. I've neglected my Bible reading. I've neglected my church attendance.

00:50:05.639 --> 00:50:12.199
I'm not equipped for this." God, would you help them this morning to make some decisions

00:50:12.199 --> 00:50:19.200
that will help them be equipped spiritually. The encouragement that we receive, the encouragement

00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:25.239
that Timothy received. Lord, help us to receive that encouragement. Just determine that we're

00:50:25.239 --> 00:50:31.280
going to serve you until the day that you come. We're going to live for Jesus. I pray

00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:35.200
God that in this moment of invitation that you have your will in way, that you'd work

00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:42.439
in hearts and lives as only you can. God, you would help us, enable us to press on.

00:50:42.439 --> 00:50:45.599
Well thank you for it. In Christ's name we pray. Would you stand with me? Heads are bowed,

00:50:45.599 --> 00:50:49.799
eyes are closed. Kimberly's going to play quietly on the piano and as she does, the

00:50:49.799 --> 00:50:50.799
altar is opened.
