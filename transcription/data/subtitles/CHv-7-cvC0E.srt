1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,239
Genesis chapter 46 and we are making progress through the book of Genesis.

2
00:00:06,239 --> 00:00:14,079
Amen. There's only 50 chapters. We are near the end and this evening is message number 94.

3
00:00:14,079 --> 00:00:18,000
And so if you've been here for the study through the book of Genesis,

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,799
this is the 94th sermon that I have preached from the book of Genesis.

5
00:00:22,799 --> 00:00:27,000
I have thoroughly enjoyed it. I've been encouraged, strengthened and challenged.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,840
I trust that you have as well. By God's grace and with God's help,

7
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,279
we'll look at the entirety of Genesis 46 this evening.

8
00:00:34,279 --> 00:00:37,799
There's 34 verses. I do not plan to read all of them.

9
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:42,040
We'll make reference to all of them. But notice, if you will, beginning in verse number one

10
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:47,319
of Genesis 46, the Bible says, And Israel took his journey with all that he had

11
00:00:47,319 --> 00:00:52,919
and came to Beersheba and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac.

12
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:58,360
And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night and said, Jacob, Jacob.

13
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:07,160
And he said, Here am I. And he said, God said, I am God, the God of thy father.

14
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:14,519
Fear not to go down into Egypt, for I will there make of thee a great nation.

15
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:20,760
I will go down with thee into Egypt, and I will also surely bring thee up again.

16
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:25,319
And Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.

17
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:31,319
Before we dig into chapter 46, very quickly a review of chapter 45 that we studied two weeks

18
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:36,599
ago. We find that it's in Genesis chapter 45 that the record is provided to us where

19
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:42,279
Joseph reveals his identity to his brothers. Of course, we know that there was a series of

20
00:01:42,279 --> 00:01:48,199
events that led up to this revelation. And Joseph, as he revealed himself to his brothers,

21
00:01:48,199 --> 00:01:52,680
he explains to his brothers the duration of that great famine. He says there's only

22
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,199
been two years of famine, and there's going to be a total of seven, so there's five more

23
00:01:56,199 --> 00:02:02,440
years of famine. And we find that he also discloses to his brothers the purpose that

24
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:09,000
God had in sending him to Egypt. In fact, Joseph made it very plain in Genesis 45 as

25
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,559
he reveals his perspective of life and understanding that God is in control.

26
00:02:13,559 --> 00:02:16,679
And though the brothers had sold him into slavery, he says,

27
00:02:17,399 --> 00:02:24,600
God sent me. God sent me before you for this purpose of preserving life. And we find that

28
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:31,160
as Joseph had an opportunity to reveal himself and reveal his perspective, he then gives to

29
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:38,199
his brothers a plan. The plan included returning back home and bringing all of the provision that

30
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:43,960
had been provided and letting his father know that he was still alive. And then, not to stay

31
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:48,759
in the homeland, but to return. And he tells them that as they would return back to Egypt,

32
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:54,679
that it was there that Joseph would care for them. What a gracious, gracious chapter that we

33
00:02:54,679 --> 00:03:01,559
read of and begin to see the picture of forgiveness and restoration and reconciliation. And what a

34
00:03:01,559 --> 00:03:08,119
blessing. The chapter ends, chapter number 45, it ends with the brothers arriving. And no doubt,

35
00:03:08,119 --> 00:03:13,160
as Jacob was awaiting their return and his anticipation was that they were coming back

36
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:17,800
with food, with sustenance, because there was a great famine and they needed food. But yet,

37
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:22,759
we find that he would see that there was a great host and all of the wagons and so on and so forth.

38
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:29,399
And they hear the news, they deliver the news to Jacob that Joseph is alive. It's absolutely

39
00:03:29,399 --> 00:03:35,800
amazing as you see that the Bible tells us in verse 27 that the spirit of Jacob, their father,

40
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:44,600
revived. I mean, this is an amazing account. And he says, it is enough. Joseph, my son, is yet alive.

41
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:52,119
I will go and see him before I die. In Genesis chapter 46, the passage in which we'll be studying

42
00:03:52,119 --> 00:03:58,600
this evening, really the highlight of the entire chapter is the reunion between Jacob and his son

43
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:03,639
Joseph. As we begin to dig into this passage of scripture, I want you to see just a few thoughts

44
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:09,559
tonight. Number one, if you're taking notes, and I've titled the message this, a family reunion,

45
00:04:09,559 --> 00:04:15,880
a family reunion. Notice with me, if you will, number one, promises for the journey. Understand

46
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:20,760
with me that Jacob and the family, they were going to take a journey and we find that as they would

47
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:28,279
take this journey that God meets with Jacob and God gives Jacob some promises. I'm so thankful for

48
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:34,279
the promises of God. We sing, standing on his promises. We understand that God's word is full

49
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:39,880
of great promises. In fact, Peter says that they're exceeding great and precious promises

50
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:45,320
in 2 Peter 1 and verse number 4. And we think about all the wonderful promises of God and we

51
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:50,119
come to this passage of scripture and we understand that there's this journey that's going to take

52
00:04:50,119 --> 00:04:57,880
place. But before the journey is even started, we find that God appears to Jacob and God gives him

53
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:03,399
some promises. Promises for the journey. Notice with me, we've read the verses already, but notice

54
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:09,160
that God begins when he says, he calls in verse number 2, Jacob, Jacob, and he says, here am I.

55
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:17,880
And notice how God begins, I am God. I am God. Isn't that amazing? To understand who he is,

56
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:25,000
to understand that he is the creator God, that he is the sustainer, he is the giver of life,

57
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:33,000
he is the omnipotent one, he is the God of the impossible, and he says to Jacob, I am God.

58
00:05:33,799 --> 00:05:39,320
And then he gives Jacob some promises. Notice as he's beginning to speak to him, he says,

59
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:46,600
fear not to go down into Egypt. And so we find that as Jacob is receiving this vision from the

60
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:53,799
Lord, that God tells him that there's no need to fear. Now that seems to indicate to me that God,

61
00:05:53,799 --> 00:05:58,920
knowing all things new, that within the heart of Jacob, there was an element of fear. There was a

62
00:05:59,799 --> 00:06:05,480
aspect in this journey that was causing him to fear. He was in the place that God had promised

63
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:12,920
as a land for the descendants of Abraham, for his family, and yet he's going to leave and go to

64
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:17,959
Egypt. And God says, fear not. By the way, God knows your heart. He knows when we're dealing

65
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:23,160
with fears, and he meets us where we are, and he says to you, and he says to me this evening,

66
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:28,359
and we find throughout the Scriptures, I mean, throughout the Bible, there are many references

67
00:06:28,359 --> 00:06:37,399
where God says, fear not. Fear not. And notice these wonderful promises. He says this,

68
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:46,760
for I will there make of thee a great nation. Do you notice those two words, I will? I will.

69
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:52,760
God gave a promise to Jacob in this passage of Scripture, promises for the journey,

70
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:58,279
and he says, I will there make of thee a great nation. Where is there? Well, Egypt, the place in

71
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:06,279
which Jacob and his family would be traveling to, and he says, I will there make of thee

72
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:11,799
a great nation. What a great promise that God gives. And by the way, it's only God that can

73
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:17,160
make such a promise. It's only God that can speak with regard to the future, because he knows all

74
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:23,799
things. He's outside of the realm of time. He is alpha and omega, the beginning and the ending,

75
00:07:23,799 --> 00:07:30,679
and we find that as he would give this promise, he says, I will there make of thee a great nation.

76
00:07:30,679 --> 00:07:35,959
He's speaking in the future tense of what God will do. By the way, he's the giver of life,

77
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:43,399
and he's the one that can say, I will make of thee a great nation, and he's made this promise. We find

78
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:50,279
that he does not end there. Notice in verse number four, he says, I will go down with thee into

79
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:55,959
Egypt. I want you to think about the significance of this promise in verse number four, when he

80
00:07:55,959 --> 00:08:02,279
speaks about his presence being with Jacob. What a joy it is to know the presence of the Lord.

81
00:08:02,359 --> 00:08:08,600
What a joy. The psalmist says that in his presence is fullness of joy. We have the promise, as New

82
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:14,519
Testament believers, we often run to in Hebrews 13, where God said, I will never leave thee nor forsake

83
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:21,399
thee. And here, as Jacob is embarking on this journey, and he's preparing to lead his family,

84
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:27,880
God appears to him, and God gives him some promises for the journey. He says, I'm going to be with you.

85
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:33,719
I'm going to build, I'm going to make of thee a great nation there in Egypt, but he says, I will

86
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:41,479
go down with thee into Egypt. And then notice he says in verse number four, and I will also surely

87
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:50,840
bring thee up again. And I want you to notice the end of verse number four, when he says this,

88
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:59,559
and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes. Can you imagine as Jacob would hear

89
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:07,640
those words, as God is giving him promises for the journey? And we understand that Jacob had

90
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:13,719
a heavy heart because of his son, believing that Joseph was dead for all of these years. And then

91
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:21,159
he hears the words from his sons at the end of chapter 45, that Joseph is yet alive. And we find

92
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:29,320
that God then gives Jacob this promise that Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.

93
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:35,640
This evening, as I consider promises for the journey for Jacob in verses one through four of

94
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:41,080
Genesis 46, I'm reminded this evening that you and I are on a journey. It's a journey that we often

95
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:47,400
call life. We understand that on this journey of life, that there are valleys and there are

96
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:55,880
mountains. There are times of blessing and there are times in which we seem as if it's just a time

97
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,880
of difficulty, a time of uncertainty. And we find that

98
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:04,200
God has given us promises for the journey.

99
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:09,920
We find that just as Jacob as he would embark on this journey physically speaking and understanding

100
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:15,800
the context of Genesis 46 and he would leave Beersheba and he would go to Egypt that God

101
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:20,960
gave him promises that would help him along the way.

102
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:25,900
You know this evening this book is full of promises that God has given you and God has

103
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:30,260
given me to help us on this journey of life.

104
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:35,380
Oh how we need to know the promises of God, how we need to claim the promises of God because

105
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:40,820
on this journey of life these promises have been given to us so that they would strengthen

106
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,620
us, so that they would enable us on this journey.

107
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:49,180
I think about Jacob as he would receive these promises and if the journey became difficult,

108
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:55,220
if it was wrought with some adversity, if the climate wasn't very conducive and all

109
00:10:55,220 --> 00:11:00,100
of those things, he had some promises and you know what he could do with those promises?

110
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,260
He could count on them.

111
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:04,700
He could know that they were sure, why?

112
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:08,980
Because God started by saying, I am God.

113
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:13,220
God's given you some promises and there are times that your journey is going to be difficult.

114
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:18,020
My journey is going to be difficult but we have promises and we have those promises.

115
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:22,580
I think about the promise, the last one that we see in verse number four about Joseph.

116
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,340
Man you think that would motivate Jacob?

117
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,580
You think that would encourage him?

118
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:31,300
You think that would give him a level of expectancy and anticipation of arriving in Egypt and

119
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:36,940
seeing his son and having this promise and this evening I understand, listen, God says

120
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,940
I'm with you.

121
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:42,940
He's given us promises for the journey.

122
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:46,340
We need to know those promises, we need to claim those promises.

123
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:51,180
Standing on the promises, they're not going to fail.

124
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,420
Not one promise is ever going to fail.

125
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,260
What a blessing to know the promises.

126
00:11:55,260 --> 00:12:00,940
Number two, as I look at this portion of scripture, I see this protection for the journey.

127
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:01,940
Protection for the journey.

128
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:06,740
Notice in verse number five, the Bible says, and Jacob rose up from Beersheba.

129
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:11,779
God had spoken to him, God had given him the promises as we just read and the Bible says

130
00:12:11,779 --> 00:12:16,419
that he rose up and the sons of Israel carried Jacob, their father, and their little ones

131
00:12:16,419 --> 00:12:21,700
and their wives in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him and they took their

132
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:28,460
cattle and their goods which they had gotten in the land of Canaan and came into Egypt.

133
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,419
Jacob and all his seed with him.

134
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:34,500
We find the Bible begins to tell us in verse number seven, his sons and his sons' sons

135
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:40,220
with him, his daughters and his sons' daughters and all his seed brought he with him into

136
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,220
Egypt.

137
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:45,380
And these are the names of the children of Israel which came into Egypt, Jacob and his

138
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,380
sons.

139
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,700
And it begins to list beginning in verse number, the end of verse number eight all the way

140
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:56,940
down through verse number 25, it gives us the names, the census, if you will, of those

141
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,980
that journeyed.

142
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:02,660
But I want you to think about the protection for the journey this evening and I want you

143
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:08,779
to see that in verse number five, the Bible tells us, verse five and six, that the departure

144
00:13:08,779 --> 00:13:11,559
for this journey is recorded for us.

145
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:14,980
By the way, on every journey that you take, every trip that you take in life, there's

146
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,139
a departure.

147
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,779
By God's grace, there's an arrival.

148
00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:25,300
We find that the Bible tells us here in this text of scripture, at the end of verse number

149
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:29,419
six, and came into Egypt.

150
00:13:29,419 --> 00:13:36,980
We see also in verse number 26, it says, and all the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt,

151
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:42,860
which came out of his loins beside Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were threescore

152
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:43,860
and six.

153
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:44,860
Sixty-six.

154
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:51,779
It's not really that big of a group of people, but we find that as they journeyed that God

155
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:58,820
provided the protection, protection for the journey.

156
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:05,139
The course, the path that they would travel, the journey in which they would embark on,

157
00:14:05,139 --> 00:14:08,500
no doubt there would be difficulties along the way.

158
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,180
Just with any journey that you and I take, there's the potential for difficulties.

159
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:17,059
There's the potential for hazards along the way, but God provides them with the protection

160
00:14:17,059 --> 00:14:18,059
that was necessary.

161
00:14:18,059 --> 00:14:22,220
It reminds me that safety is of the Lord.

162
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:27,020
This evening, we need to understand that God fulfilled the promise when he said to him

163
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:31,339
in verse number three, fear not to go down into Egypt, for I will there make of thee

164
00:14:31,339 --> 00:14:32,339
a great nation.

165
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:39,300
I will go down with thee into Egypt, and Jacob and his family, they arrive in Egypt.

166
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,700
And what a blessing.

167
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:46,820
To consider this evening the safety of the Lord, the protection of God, and that God

168
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,239
gives us protection for the journey.

169
00:14:49,239 --> 00:14:55,820
There are times in our life that we very distinctly see God's hand of protection in our lives.

170
00:14:55,820 --> 00:15:00,260
Just this week, we had some things that happened within some of the folks within our congregation

171
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:04,500
that you have the opportunity to see the protective hand of God.

172
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,660
I'm thankful for God's protection.

173
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:10,660
I'm thankful this evening that when I look at this portion of Scripture and I think about

174
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:15,380
the context and understanding the historical account, that Jacob and his family literally

175
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:20,980
took a journey from Beersheba to Egypt, that God gave them some promises.

176
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:27,619
And when we understand and make application that our journey, God's given us some promises.

177
00:15:27,619 --> 00:15:32,339
That they had protection and God has protected us.

178
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:37,339
Someone told me recently, and I was so encouraged and blessed, and I shared it with Holly and

179
00:15:37,339 --> 00:15:41,739
what a blessing it was, and I won't say the person's name so that they would not be embarrassed,

180
00:15:41,739 --> 00:15:48,140
but I was told by someone else how that this individual prayed our family safely back and

181
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,540
forth from Manassas for 10 years.

182
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:53,980
You know how that blessed my heart when I heard that?

183
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:58,020
You know how many accidents are on 66 every single day?

184
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,820
We saw a real bad one just the other night.

185
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,820
We're coming back from a basketball game, and we saw a real bad one.

186
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:03,820
It just happened.

187
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:06,540
I mean, all kinds of emergency vehicles were going, and we thought, man, there must be

188
00:16:06,739 --> 00:16:09,940
something real major that was going on, so we tried to look it up, and you can just see

189
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:15,179
when you try to look it up how fatal accident, fatal accident, on this day, on this day,

190
00:16:15,179 --> 00:16:19,700
on this day, God's protection.

191
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:22,739
Sometimes we just kind of take it for granted.

192
00:16:22,739 --> 00:16:28,980
But here, Jacob and his family, they had protection, and it's God that gave them the protection.

193
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,420
We must be mindful.

194
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:33,820
We must be thankful for God's protection in our lives.

195
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,540
A larger place here in terms of the book of Psalms, if you will, Psalm 73.

196
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:42,540
I want to look at a quick reference here in Psalm 73 as I try to package together these

197
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:49,739
first two thoughts from Genesis 46, promises for the journey and protection for the journey.

198
00:16:49,739 --> 00:16:55,260
And really, this passage in Psalm 73 will lead us to our final thought this evening

199
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:59,300
as we conclude Genesis chapter 46.

200
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,700
This is a Psalm that's ascribed to Asaph.

201
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:06,380
Those with me will look at verse 23, and I want you to think about this as we make

202
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:10,860
application with regard to the promises for the journey, protection for the journey.

203
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:19,920
The Bible says in Psalm 73, verse 23, nevertheless, I am continually with thee.

204
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:23,300
Thou hast holden me by my right hand.

205
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:29,260
Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory.

206
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:32,820
Keep that thought in mind for our final conclusion this evening.

207
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:37,619
Verse 25, notice what the psalmist says, Whom have I in heaven but thee?

208
00:17:37,619 --> 00:17:40,220
There is none upon earth that I desire beside thee.

209
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:48,100
My flesh and my heart faileth, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.

210
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,860
For lo, they that are far from thee shall perish.

211
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:55,420
Thou hast destroyed all them that go a-whoring from thee.

212
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:58,920
But it is good for me to draw near to God.

213
00:17:58,959 --> 00:18:05,640
I've put my trust in the Lord God that I may declare all thy works.

214
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,000
I'm thankful for God's guidance and direction.

215
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,800
I'm thankful for God's presence in this journey.

216
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,119
God's given us promises.

217
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:17,119
God's given us protection.

218
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:19,119
And we ought to rejoice in that this evening.

219
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:26,239
Just as we see in the life of Jacob and his family, these souls that left Beersheba and

220
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:32,559
traveled to Egypt, and what a blessing, and how those promises would give them the strength

221
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:37,599
as they would trust that God would do what he said he would do, the protection along

222
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:39,239
the way.

223
00:18:39,239 --> 00:18:44,160
We find this evening, even as I mentioned at the end of verse 24 of Psalm 73, and afterward

224
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,359
receive me to glory.

225
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:51,440
I want you to notice as we continue in Genesis 46, number three, if you're taking notes,

226
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,880
the phenomenal reunion.

227
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,640
I just used the word to have a pee, to be honest with you.

228
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,020
But it is a phenomenal reunion that takes place in Genesis 46.

229
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:06,400
As we look at the end of the portion of this chapter, I want you to see what happens.

230
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,000
The Bible tells us in verse number 26, I read it a moment ago, that they arrived there in

231
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Egypt.

232
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:18,799
It says in verse 27, and the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt, were two souls.

233
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:23,720
All the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt, were threescore and ten.

234
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:30,799
And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face unto Goshen.

235
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,979
And they came into the land of Goshen.

236
00:19:32,979 --> 00:19:39,039
Notice verse 29, and Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father

237
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,119
to Goshen, and presented himself unto him.

238
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:47,320
And he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.

239
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:52,880
It's a wonderful reunion that God gives us a glimpse, a picture of what happens here

240
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,280
in Genesis 46.

241
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:58,760
And as we could paint the picture and understand what's taking place, and really what a sweet

242
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,880
reunion this is.

243
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,000
is that Jacob, no doubt along the journey

244
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,420
and how many days it took, we do not know for certainty,

245
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:09,880
but we know that the duration of this journey,

246
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:14,380
I believe that Jacob was anticipating his arrival.

247
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,560
I believe that Jacob was looking forward

248
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,980
to how many more days.

249
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:20,640
You ever been on a trip and the kids say how much longer?

250
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,040
And you hear it all the time.

251
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,240
And how much longer?

252
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,160
How much longer?

253
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,000
How much longer?

254
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,640
Road trips are just so enjoyable.

255
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,800
Brother Pierre loves road trips, right?

256
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,760
And we used to tell our kids 20 minutes, 20 minutes.

257
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:36,160
And, but the reality is that I believe

258
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,800
there's a great measure of anticipation.

259
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,640
Why?

260
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,640
He's going to see his son.

261
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,440
He thought he was dead,

262
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,140
but he found out he's alive.

263
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,240
He's anticipating this reunion.

264
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,840
I believe on the other end that Joseph,

265
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,800
he knew that he sent his brothers back home.

266
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:01,840
He knew that he sent them home with goods and provision,

267
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,400
but also with instruction to return.

268
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,960
How many of you have ever shared your ETA

269
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,960
with your cell phone to someone

270
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,640
that you were going to visit?

271
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,720
You can send your little map thing and send,

272
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,740
here's my ETA and you can share your trip route,

273
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:17,640
so on and so forth.

274
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,840
You've done that.

275
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:22,540
Listen, they didn't have that back then, right?

276
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:25,400
There was no way of them being able to communicate

277
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,920
about this opportunity having, yeah, my, I won't say,

278
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,480
but the reality is that they didn't have that.

279
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,080
So what's Joseph doing?

280
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,160
I think Joseph's anxiously awaiting.

281
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,000
I think every day Armando,

282
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,800
he's looking out to see if they're coming.

283
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,920
He's anxiously awaiting, why?

284
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,080
Because he's going to see his dad.

285
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,640
You know what he said every single time

286
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,160
when he meets with his brothers?

287
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:55,760
He asks specifically, how's father?

288
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,080
How's my dad?

289
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,920
He doesn't say it that way, but he's inquiring.

290
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,720
He wants to know.

291
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,240
And we find here that as we look at this passage

292
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:09,160
of Scripture that Jacob, he's anticipating their arrival.

293
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:12,080
Joseph is anxiously awaiting their arrival.

294
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,040
And we read that Jacob sends Judah ahead in verse 28

295
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:19,279
and Joseph was making ready his chariot in verse 29.

296
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:21,440
And the Bible says that he went up to meet Israel,

297
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,800
his father, to Goshen.

298
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,080
Notice the Bible says, and he presented himself unto him

299
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,040
and he fell on his neck and he wept on his neck.

300
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:33,440
Notice this, a good while.

301
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,480
I don't know how long a good while is.

302
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,720
It's just a good while.

303
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:43,559
I think it was an embrace that was just so sweet.

304
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,600
Why?

305
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,960
Because neither one of them thought

306
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,600
they'd see each other ever again.

307
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:58,160
God gave them the opportunity to have this reunion.

308
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,880
Jacob, as we know in the text of Scripture,

309
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,760
is overwhelmed with gratitude for the Bible says

310
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,360
in verse number 30, after they had this embrace

311
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,559
and after they have had this reunion,

312
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:12,240
that in verse number 30, it says that Israel said

313
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:17,240
unto Joseph, now let me die since I have seen thy face

314
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:23,360
because thou art yet alive.

315
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,720
You know, God gives them 17 years.

316
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,720
It's pretty amazing.

317
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,279
Joseph, as best we can tell, was 17

318
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:32,440
when he was sold into slavery.

319
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,720
And then after Jacob would arrive there in Egypt,

320
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,040
he gets 17 years.

321
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:41,160
And we see though the gratitude and the expression

322
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,279
that is made of Jacob with this delight

323
00:23:44,279 --> 00:23:46,000
of being able to see his son,

324
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,919
it's as if there's this completeness,

325
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:51,680
this fulfillment, if you will, let me die.

326
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,520
Why?

327
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,880
Because I've seen you, you're alive.

328
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,000
And as we think about this passage of Scripture

329
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,520
and as we've sought to make application this evening,

330
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:03,040
we mentioned about the promises for the journey.

331
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,559
God's given us promises for our journey.

332
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:09,120
We mentioned about the protection for the journey.

333
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,639
God's given us protection for our journey.

334
00:24:11,639 --> 00:24:16,640
But we see this grand reunion between Jacob and Joseph,

335
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,720
but really the entire family comes.

336
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,640
And I want you to understand this evening

337
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,080
that one day there's gonna be a grand reunion.

338
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,360
It's called heaven.

339
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,800
You sing the song, when we all get to heaven,

340
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,119
what a day of rejoicing that will be.

341
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:37,399
I want you to understand this evening

342
00:24:37,399 --> 00:24:40,279
that the greatest thing about heaven is Jesus.

343
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:43,080
The greatest thing about being in heaven

344
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,920
is the fact that we'll see our Savior face to face.

345
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,959
But I want you to understand this evening

346
00:24:47,959 --> 00:24:50,239
that just as we look at this text of Scripture

347
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:51,959
and we see the promises for the journey,

348
00:24:51,959 --> 00:24:54,320
we see the protection for the journey,

349
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,200
God's given us promises, God's given us protection,

350
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,679
and there's this reunion that takes place.

351
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,239
And one day there's gonna be a grand reunion.

352
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,360
I called it a family reunion.

353
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,760
And oh, it's gonna be a family reunion.

354
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,320
I want you to hold your, well, yeah,

355
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,679
hold your place here in Genesis 46.

356
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,179
Turn to the book of 1 Thessalonians, if you will.

357
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,760
In 1 Thessalonians chapter number four,

358
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,520
as we think about this wonderful truth this evening

359
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,920
and we seek to make application,

360
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,440
remember the psalmist said,

361
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:30,339
as you're turning to 1 Thessalonians chapter number four,

362
00:25:30,339 --> 00:25:31,839
we read it just a moment ago,

363
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:33,959
but the psalmist said in Psalm 73,

364
00:25:33,959 --> 00:25:37,640
and afterward, receive me to glory.

365
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,440
Paul said this, to be absent from the body

366
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,360
is to be present with the Lord,

367
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,720
having that assurance that we'll be with our Savior.

368
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:49,720
In 1 Thessalonians chapter four,

369
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,320
beginning in verse number 13,

370
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,920
the Bible says, but I would not have you

371
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,440
to be ignorant, brethren,

372
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,800
concerning them which are asleep,

373
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,459
that you sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.

374
00:25:58,459 --> 00:26:01,440
Those are those that have died in Christ,

375
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,320
the believers that have died,

376
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:06,320
that they have gone home to be with the Lord,

377
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,920
and Paul says that you sorrow not,

378
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,459
even as others which have no hope.

379
00:26:10,459 --> 00:26:13,760
We mentioned just this past Wednesday evening,

380
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,800
as we're studying through the end of chapter five

381
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,360
of the book of 1 Thessalonians,

382
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,899
about comforting those that are weak in spirit,

383
00:26:19,899 --> 00:26:21,559
those that are feeble-minded,

384
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:24,360
and how some of the things that these believers

385
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,000
in Thessalonica had encountered,

386
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,360
and death of loved ones being one of them.

387
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,080
But Paul, as he continues, he says,

388
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,839
this in verse 14, for if we believe

389
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:34,959
that Jesus died and rose again,

390
00:26:34,959 --> 00:26:37,279
and we do, we believe that truth,

391
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:40,320
it's biblical truth, even so,

392
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,520
them also which sleep in Jesus

393
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:45,000
will God bring with him.

394
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,600
Notice in verse 15, for this we say unto you,

395
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,600
by the word of the Lord.

396
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,559
This is not Paul just trying to give a motivational speech.

397
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:56,360
This is not Paul just trying to rah-rah

398
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,720
and try to encourage, no, he's saying,

399
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:01,200
I'm speaking this by the word of the Lord,

400
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,399
that we which are alive and remain

401
00:27:03,399 --> 00:27:04,720
unto the coming of the Lord

402
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,480
shall not prevent them which are asleep.

403
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,480
That means that we're not gonna go before them.

404
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,279
He gives the order of the resurrection in the next verse.

405
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:14,839
Notice in verse 16, for the Lord himself

406
00:27:14,839 --> 00:27:17,480
shall descend from heaven with a shout,

407
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,920
with the voice of the archangel,

408
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,360
and with the trump of God,

409
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:24,300
and the dead in Christ shall rise first.

410
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:28,700
Then, verse number 17, we which are alive and remain

411
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:33,220
shall be caught up together with them in the clouds

412
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,779
to meet the Lord in the air,

413
00:27:34,779 --> 00:27:37,020
then notice this, and so shall,

414
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:39,100
what's the next word in your Bible?

415
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:41,140
What we, the very next word,

416
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:46,140
and so shall we ever be with the Lord.

417
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:52,080
There's gonna be a grand reunion one day.

418
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,080
There's some folks that have had some loved ones

419
00:27:54,899 --> 00:27:57,000
that have gone on to eternity before you.

420
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:03,080
Your heart can be heavy for those loved ones.

421
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,640
You know, it's a wonderful truth of God's word

422
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,520
that if they're saved, we're gonna see them once again.

423
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,200
I mean, the greatest thing about heaven,

424
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,000
I wanna make sure I keep it within the focus of our minds,

425
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,200
the greatest thing about heaven

426
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,040
is not simply that there's gonna be a reunion,

427
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,559
it's that Jesus is there,

428
00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:19,619
that I'm gonna see my heavenly father,

429
00:28:19,619 --> 00:28:21,720
that you're gonna see your heavenly father,

430
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,720
just as Joseph had the opportunity to see

431
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,200
his earthly father,

432
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,920
we find that we'll see our heavenly father,

433
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,279
we'll see our savior,

434
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:33,080
we'll see the one who died for us and rose again,

435
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,359
but all of the same,

436
00:28:34,359 --> 00:28:36,380
listen, if you read the book of Revelation,

437
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:38,160
you get to chapter four and five,

438
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,760
and what a scene in heaven.

439
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,640
I mean, the throne room of heaven,

440
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,400
God gives us a glimpse into,

441
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,679
in Revelation chapter number four and five,

442
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:50,239
a glimpse into the throne room of heaven.

443
00:28:50,239 --> 00:28:54,880
Oh, what a day of rejoicing that will be.

444
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,599
There's gonna be a grand reunion one day,

445
00:28:56,599 --> 00:28:57,720
listen, this world,

446
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,840
I said on Wednesday night,

447
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,260
this world is not my home,

448
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:03,359
I'm just a passing through, amen.

449
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:06,239
Listen, we're pilgrims and we're strangers,

450
00:29:06,239 --> 00:29:08,260
we understand that we live in this world,

451
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,799
but we're not of this world,

452
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:12,160
and as we look at Genesis chapter 46

453
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,520
and understanding the historical context

454
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,239
and being able to gather

455
00:29:16,239 --> 00:29:18,919
from that passage of scripture what happens,

456
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,160
but then let's make some application for us,

457
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,599
because you're on a journey and I'm on a journey,

458
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:27,979
but God's given us promises,

459
00:29:27,979 --> 00:29:30,200
just like he gave Jacob promises

460
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,160
to start this passage of scripture

461
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,440
in Genesis 46 verses one through four,

462
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,960
God said, I am God,

463
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,559
and here's what I am going to do.

464
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:41,599
You've been given some promises,

465
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:43,960
you better know them and you better claim them.

466
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,340
I mean, just get in the book

467
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:48,799
and get those promises and just begin to claim them.

468
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:53,700
And then God's given protection to Jacob

469
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,559
and to his family as they journeyed.

470
00:29:57,059 --> 00:29:58,619
God's given us protection.

471
00:29:58,619 --> 00:30:01,099
God's ways are perfect.

472
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:03,339
God makes no mistakes.

473
00:30:03,339 --> 00:30:06,939
And when God's ready for us to go to heaven, we're going to go to heaven.

474
00:30:06,939 --> 00:30:10,899
We're going to take a final breath here on earth and we're going to be transported

475
00:30:10,899 --> 00:30:13,019
into the very presence of our God.

476
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:14,019
Hallelujah.

477
00:30:14,019 --> 00:30:19,499
Honestly, I'm hoping that Jesus comes back before I take my final breath and die a physical

478
00:30:19,499 --> 00:30:20,499
death.

479
00:30:20,499 --> 00:30:23,139
I'm hoping that Jesus comes back.

480
00:30:23,139 --> 00:30:24,719
Listen for the trumpet.

481
00:30:24,719 --> 00:30:26,179
Jesus is coming.

482
00:30:26,179 --> 00:30:28,879
So many people looking around this year.

483
00:30:28,879 --> 00:30:29,879
Things that are going on.

484
00:30:29,879 --> 00:30:30,879
Do you see this?

485
00:30:30,879 --> 00:30:31,879
Do you see that?

486
00:30:31,879 --> 00:30:32,879
It's got to be close.

487
00:30:32,879 --> 00:30:33,879
So on and so forth.

488
00:30:33,879 --> 00:30:36,839
Listen, we just need to be busy doing what God's called us to do, because he's going

489
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:38,679
to come at the right time.

490
00:30:38,679 --> 00:30:39,679
On time.

491
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:40,679
He's not going to be a minute late.

492
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:43,079
He's not going to be a minute early.

493
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:49,119
But I want you to know that just as Jacob and his family, they arrive in Egypt and there's

494
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:54,399
just a great reunion that takes place.

495
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,859
One day there's going to be a great reunion.

496
00:30:56,859 --> 00:31:01,419
When we all get to heaven, what a day of rejoicing that will be.

497
00:31:01,419 --> 00:31:03,539
We'll see our Savior face to face.

498
00:31:03,539 --> 00:31:04,539
Oh, what glory.

499
00:31:04,539 --> 00:31:09,499
You know, sometimes I hear people talk about heaven and they talk about streets of gold

500
00:31:09,499 --> 00:31:10,859
and this, that, and the other thing.

501
00:31:10,859 --> 00:31:17,859
Listen, all those things are fine and good, but all those things without Jesus, it's nothing.

502
00:31:17,859 --> 00:31:19,819
It's nothing.

503
00:31:19,819 --> 00:31:23,379
What makes heaven heaven is Jesus.

504
00:31:23,379 --> 00:31:25,839
And one day we're going to be there.

505
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:29,159
And you know, we're going to rejoice forever and ever.

506
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:32,759
Sometimes the clock can become an enemy to church.

507
00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:37,839
Say, man, it's time has gone by, we got to get out, things to do, so on and so forth.

508
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:39,119
And we're going to be outside of time.

509
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:45,719
We're just going to be rejoicing and worshiping and singing praise and having this grand reunion.

510
00:31:45,719 --> 00:31:48,279
You ever have a family reunion?

511
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:51,319
I remember as a kid having a family reunion.

512
00:31:51,319 --> 00:31:56,419
You go to those family reunions and as a kid you don't know any of the people.

513
00:31:56,419 --> 00:31:58,339
What's going on?

514
00:31:58,339 --> 00:32:02,339
Pinch your cheeks and all that kind of nonsense, right?

515
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:06,059
Then I've not gone to a family reunion in years, it almost seems, and I don't mean this

516
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:10,419
to sound dark, but it almost seems like for some families and it's happened in our family

517
00:32:10,419 --> 00:32:16,419
that funerals almost become a family reunion.

518
00:32:16,419 --> 00:32:21,299
But I want you to know for the people of God, for brothers and sisters in Christ, the redeemed,

519
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:23,879
we're going to be in heaven one day.

520
00:32:23,879 --> 00:32:25,879
What a reunion that's going to be.

521
00:32:25,879 --> 00:32:32,799
Listen, live for Jesus, live to please Him, live to tell others about Jesus.

522
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:33,799
Why?

523
00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:36,879
Because if they die without Him, they're not going to be there.

524
00:32:36,879 --> 00:32:39,319
They're not going to be there.

525
00:32:39,319 --> 00:32:42,039
The Bible makes it very plain and very clear.

526
00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:43,519
There's one way to get to heaven.

527
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:45,080
Jesus is the only way.

528
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:49,360
He said, I am the way, the truth, and the life.

529
00:32:49,419 --> 00:32:52,860
No man cometh unto the Father but by me.

530
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:59,339
It's a joy to have brothers and sisters in Christ from every nation, tribe, language.

531
00:32:59,339 --> 00:33:00,860
I mean, it's going to be a grand reunion.

532
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:05,519
We're going to worship God for all of eternity, it's going to be awesome.

533
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:10,619
We see Jacob, we see Genesis 46, but we make some application for our lives, claim the

534
00:33:10,619 --> 00:33:16,899
promises, recognize His protection, and look forward to great anticipation to the day that

535
00:33:16,899 --> 00:33:19,339
we meet our Savior face to face.

536
00:33:19,339 --> 00:33:20,339
Let's pray together.

537
00:33:20,339 --> 00:33:21,519
Father, we love You.

538
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:22,720
We thank You for loving us.

539
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,239
We thank You, God, for Your Word.

540
00:33:25,239 --> 00:33:32,080
And as we have opportunity to be able to see historically this event that You've recorded

541
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:40,879
for us and how grateful we are for Your promises that You gave to Jacob and how they sustained

542
00:33:40,879 --> 00:33:41,879
him along the way.

543
00:33:41,879 --> 00:33:47,299
We thank You for Your protection that's obvious through the text of Scripture and their arrival

544
00:33:47,299 --> 00:33:48,299
to Egypt.

545
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:55,179
And then we see that reunion and, Lord, how our heart rejoices to even imagine that event

546
00:33:55,179 --> 00:33:56,500
that took place.

547
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:02,899
And God, I pray that You would help us this evening, Lord, to understand that You've given

548
00:34:02,899 --> 00:34:05,139
us many promises in Your Word.

549
00:34:05,139 --> 00:34:07,779
Help us to know them and to claim them.

550
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:11,220
I pray that they would sustain us in this journey called life.

551
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:17,899
And God, I pray that we would acknowledge, rejoice in Your protection that You give us.

552
00:34:17,899 --> 00:34:24,619
Lord, I pray that we'd live every day anticipating Your soon return, looking forward with great

553
00:34:24,619 --> 00:34:29,699
excitement and anticipation of that wonderful day that we'll see You face to face.

554
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:35,540
God, I pray that You would be glorified in and through our lives, that You would have

555
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,540
Your will and way.

556
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:40,380
I pray this evening, Lord, that as we have an opportunity to have a time of invitation,

557
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:44,979
I pray, Lord, that You'd help us to just kind of thank You, Lord, for the promises and for

558
00:34:44,979 --> 00:34:45,979
Your protection.

559
00:34:45,979 --> 00:34:51,100
Lord, that we would desire to live for You all the days of our lives, that there's someone

560
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,100
here that's not saved.

561
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:56,540
Lord, I pray that You'd help them to see their need for Christ, that before it's eternally

562
00:34:56,540 --> 00:35:01,100
too late, they would place their faith and trust in the finished work of Jesus.

563
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:05,199
This moment of invitation, I pray, God, that You'd move and work, guide and direct as only

564
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:06,199
You can.

565
00:35:06,199 --> 00:35:10,139
And we're certain to thank You for what You'll do, for it's in Christ's name we pray.

566
00:35:10,139 --> 00:35:11,139
Amen.

567
00:35:11,139 --> 00:35:11,139
