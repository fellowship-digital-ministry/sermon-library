WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.239
Genesis chapter 46 and we are making progress through the book of Genesis.

00:00:06.239 --> 00:00:14.079
Amen. There's only 50 chapters. We are near the end and this evening is message number 94.

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:18.000
And so if you've been here for the study through the book of Genesis,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.799
this is the 94th sermon that I have preached from the book of Genesis.

00:00:22.799 --> 00:00:27.000
I have thoroughly enjoyed it. I've been encouraged, strengthened and challenged.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.840
I trust that you have as well. By God's grace and with God's help,

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.279
we'll look at the entirety of Genesis 46 this evening.

00:00:34.279 --> 00:00:37.799
There's 34 verses. I do not plan to read all of them.

00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:42.040
We'll make reference to all of them. But notice, if you will, beginning in verse number one

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.319
of Genesis 46, the Bible says, And Israel took his journey with all that he had

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:52.919
and came to Beersheba and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac.

00:00:52.919 --> 00:00:58.360
And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night and said, Jacob, Jacob.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:07.160
And he said, Here am I. And he said, God said, I am God, the God of thy father.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:14.519
Fear not to go down into Egypt, for I will there make of thee a great nation.

00:01:14.519 --> 00:01:20.760
I will go down with thee into Egypt, and I will also surely bring thee up again.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.319
And Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:31.319
Before we dig into chapter 46, very quickly a review of chapter 45 that we studied two weeks

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:36.599
ago. We find that it's in Genesis chapter 45 that the record is provided to us where

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:42.279
Joseph reveals his identity to his brothers. Of course, we know that there was a series of

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:48.199
events that led up to this revelation. And Joseph, as he revealed himself to his brothers,

00:01:48.199 --> 00:01:52.680
he explains to his brothers the duration of that great famine. He says there's only

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.199
been two years of famine, and there's going to be a total of seven, so there's five more

00:01:56.199 --> 00:02:02.440
years of famine. And we find that he also discloses to his brothers the purpose that

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:09.000
God had in sending him to Egypt. In fact, Joseph made it very plain in Genesis 45 as

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.559
he reveals his perspective of life and understanding that God is in control.

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:16.679
And though the brothers had sold him into slavery, he says,

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:24.600
God sent me. God sent me before you for this purpose of preserving life. And we find that

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:31.160
as Joseph had an opportunity to reveal himself and reveal his perspective, he then gives to

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:38.199
his brothers a plan. The plan included returning back home and bringing all of the provision that

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:43.960
had been provided and letting his father know that he was still alive. And then, not to stay

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.759
in the homeland, but to return. And he tells them that as they would return back to Egypt,

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:54.679
that it was there that Joseph would care for them. What a gracious, gracious chapter that we

00:02:54.679 --> 00:03:01.559
read of and begin to see the picture of forgiveness and restoration and reconciliation. And what a

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:08.119
blessing. The chapter ends, chapter number 45, it ends with the brothers arriving. And no doubt,

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:13.160
as Jacob was awaiting their return and his anticipation was that they were coming back

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.800
with food, with sustenance, because there was a great famine and they needed food. But yet,

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.759
we find that he would see that there was a great host and all of the wagons and so on and so forth.

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:29.399
And they hear the news, they deliver the news to Jacob that Joseph is alive. It's absolutely

00:03:29.399 --> 00:03:35.800
amazing as you see that the Bible tells us in verse 27 that the spirit of Jacob, their father,

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:44.600
revived. I mean, this is an amazing account. And he says, it is enough. Joseph, my son, is yet alive.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:52.119
I will go and see him before I die. In Genesis chapter 46, the passage in which we'll be studying

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:58.600
this evening, really the highlight of the entire chapter is the reunion between Jacob and his son

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.639
Joseph. As we begin to dig into this passage of scripture, I want you to see just a few thoughts

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:09.559
tonight. Number one, if you're taking notes, and I've titled the message this, a family reunion,

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:15.880
a family reunion. Notice with me, if you will, number one, promises for the journey. Understand

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.760
with me that Jacob and the family, they were going to take a journey and we find that as they would

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:28.279
take this journey that God meets with Jacob and God gives Jacob some promises. I'm so thankful for

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:34.279
the promises of God. We sing, standing on his promises. We understand that God's word is full

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:39.880
of great promises. In fact, Peter says that they're exceeding great and precious promises

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:45.320
in 2 Peter 1 and verse number 4. And we think about all the wonderful promises of God and we

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:50.119
come to this passage of scripture and we understand that there's this journey that's going to take

00:04:50.119 --> 00:04:57.880
place. But before the journey is even started, we find that God appears to Jacob and God gives him

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:03.399
some promises. Promises for the journey. Notice with me, we've read the verses already, but notice

00:05:03.399 --> 00:05:09.160
that God begins when he says, he calls in verse number 2, Jacob, Jacob, and he says, here am I.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:17.880
And notice how God begins, I am God. I am God. Isn't that amazing? To understand who he is,

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:25.000
to understand that he is the creator God, that he is the sustainer, he is the giver of life,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:33.000
he is the omnipotent one, he is the God of the impossible, and he says to Jacob, I am God.

00:05:33.799 --> 00:05:39.320
And then he gives Jacob some promises. Notice as he's beginning to speak to him, he says,

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:46.600
fear not to go down into Egypt. And so we find that as Jacob is receiving this vision from the

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:53.799
Lord, that God tells him that there's no need to fear. Now that seems to indicate to me that God,

00:05:53.799 --> 00:05:58.920
knowing all things new, that within the heart of Jacob, there was an element of fear. There was a

00:05:59.799 --> 00:06:05.480
aspect in this journey that was causing him to fear. He was in the place that God had promised

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:12.920
as a land for the descendants of Abraham, for his family, and yet he's going to leave and go to

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.959
Egypt. And God says, fear not. By the way, God knows your heart. He knows when we're dealing

00:06:17.959 --> 00:06:23.160
with fears, and he meets us where we are, and he says to you, and he says to me this evening,

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:28.359
and we find throughout the Scriptures, I mean, throughout the Bible, there are many references

00:06:28.359 --> 00:06:37.399
where God says, fear not. Fear not. And notice these wonderful promises. He says this,

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:46.760
for I will there make of thee a great nation. Do you notice those two words, I will? I will.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:52.760
God gave a promise to Jacob in this passage of Scripture, promises for the journey,

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:58.279
and he says, I will there make of thee a great nation. Where is there? Well, Egypt, the place in

00:06:58.279 --> 00:07:06.279
which Jacob and his family would be traveling to, and he says, I will there make of thee

00:07:06.279 --> 00:07:11.799
a great nation. What a great promise that God gives. And by the way, it's only God that can

00:07:11.799 --> 00:07:17.160
make such a promise. It's only God that can speak with regard to the future, because he knows all

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:23.799
things. He's outside of the realm of time. He is alpha and omega, the beginning and the ending,

00:07:23.799 --> 00:07:30.679
and we find that as he would give this promise, he says, I will there make of thee a great nation.

00:07:30.679 --> 00:07:35.959
He's speaking in the future tense of what God will do. By the way, he's the giver of life,

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:43.399
and he's the one that can say, I will make of thee a great nation, and he's made this promise. We find

00:07:43.399 --> 00:07:50.279
that he does not end there. Notice in verse number four, he says, I will go down with thee into

00:07:50.279 --> 00:07:55.959
Egypt. I want you to think about the significance of this promise in verse number four, when he

00:07:55.959 --> 00:08:02.279
speaks about his presence being with Jacob. What a joy it is to know the presence of the Lord.

00:08:02.359 --> 00:08:08.600
What a joy. The psalmist says that in his presence is fullness of joy. We have the promise, as New

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:14.519
Testament believers, we often run to in Hebrews 13, where God said, I will never leave thee nor forsake

00:08:14.519 --> 00:08:21.399
thee. And here, as Jacob is embarking on this journey, and he's preparing to lead his family,

00:08:21.399 --> 00:08:27.880
God appears to him, and God gives him some promises for the journey. He says, I'm going to be with you.

00:08:28.519 --> 00:08:33.719
I'm going to build, I'm going to make of thee a great nation there in Egypt, but he says, I will

00:08:33.719 --> 00:08:41.479
go down with thee into Egypt. And then notice he says in verse number four, and I will also surely

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:50.840
bring thee up again. And I want you to notice the end of verse number four, when he says this,

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:59.559
and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes. Can you imagine as Jacob would hear

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:07.640
those words, as God is giving him promises for the journey? And we understand that Jacob had

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:13.719
a heavy heart because of his son, believing that Joseph was dead for all of these years. And then

00:09:13.719 --> 00:09:21.159
he hears the words from his sons at the end of chapter 45, that Joseph is yet alive. And we find

00:09:21.159 --> 00:09:29.320
that God then gives Jacob this promise that Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:35.640
This evening, as I consider promises for the journey for Jacob in verses one through four of

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:41.080
Genesis 46, I'm reminded this evening that you and I are on a journey. It's a journey that we often

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:47.400
call life. We understand that on this journey of life, that there are valleys and there are

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:55.880
mountains. There are times of blessing and there are times in which we seem as if it's just a time

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:59.880
of difficulty, a time of uncertainty. And we find that

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:04.200
God has given us promises for the journey.

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:09.920
We find that just as Jacob as he would embark on this journey physically speaking and understanding

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:15.800
the context of Genesis 46 and he would leave Beersheba and he would go to Egypt that God

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:20.960
gave him promises that would help him along the way.

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:25.900
You know this evening this book is full of promises that God has given you and God has

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:30.260
given me to help us on this journey of life.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:35.380
Oh how we need to know the promises of God, how we need to claim the promises of God because

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:40.820
on this journey of life these promises have been given to us so that they would strengthen

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:43.620
us, so that they would enable us on this journey.

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:49.180
I think about Jacob as he would receive these promises and if the journey became difficult,

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:55.220
if it was wrought with some adversity, if the climate wasn't very conducive and all

00:10:55.220 --> 00:11:00.100
of those things, he had some promises and you know what he could do with those promises?

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:02.260
He could count on them.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.700
He could know that they were sure, why?

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:08.980
Because God started by saying, I am God.

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:13.220
God's given you some promises and there are times that your journey is going to be difficult.

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:18.020
My journey is going to be difficult but we have promises and we have those promises.

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:22.580
I think about the promise, the last one that we see in verse number four about Joseph.

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:24.340
Man you think that would motivate Jacob?

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:25.580
You think that would encourage him?

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:31.300
You think that would give him a level of expectancy and anticipation of arriving in Egypt and

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:36.940
seeing his son and having this promise and this evening I understand, listen, God says

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:38.940
I'm with you.

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:42.940
He's given us promises for the journey.

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:46.340
We need to know those promises, we need to claim those promises.

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:51.180
Standing on the promises, they're not going to fail.

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:53.420
Not one promise is ever going to fail.

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:55.260
What a blessing to know the promises.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:12:00.940
Number two, as I look at this portion of scripture, I see this protection for the journey.

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:01.940
Protection for the journey.

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:06.740
Notice in verse number five, the Bible says, and Jacob rose up from Beersheba.

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:11.779
God had spoken to him, God had given him the promises as we just read and the Bible says

00:12:11.779 --> 00:12:16.419
that he rose up and the sons of Israel carried Jacob, their father, and their little ones

00:12:16.419 --> 00:12:21.700
and their wives in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him and they took their

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:28.460
cattle and their goods which they had gotten in the land of Canaan and came into Egypt.

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:30.419
Jacob and all his seed with him.

00:12:30.419 --> 00:12:34.500
We find the Bible begins to tell us in verse number seven, his sons and his sons' sons

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:40.220
with him, his daughters and his sons' daughters and all his seed brought he with him into

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:41.220
Egypt.

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:45.380
And these are the names of the children of Israel which came into Egypt, Jacob and his

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:46.380
sons.

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:49.700
And it begins to list beginning in verse number, the end of verse number eight all the way

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:56.940
down through verse number 25, it gives us the names, the census, if you will, of those

00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:58.980
that journeyed.

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:02.660
But I want you to think about the protection for the journey this evening and I want you

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:08.779
to see that in verse number five, the Bible tells us, verse five and six, that the departure

00:13:08.779 --> 00:13:11.559
for this journey is recorded for us.

00:13:11.559 --> 00:13:14.980
By the way, on every journey that you take, every trip that you take in life, there's

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:17.139
a departure.

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:19.779
By God's grace, there's an arrival.

00:13:19.779 --> 00:13:25.300
We find that the Bible tells us here in this text of scripture, at the end of verse number

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:29.419
six, and came into Egypt.

00:13:29.419 --> 00:13:36.980
We see also in verse number 26, it says, and all the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt,

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:42.860
which came out of his loins beside Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were threescore

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:43.860
and six.

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:44.860
Sixty-six.

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:51.779
It's not really that big of a group of people, but we find that as they journeyed that God

00:13:51.779 --> 00:13:58.820
provided the protection, protection for the journey.

00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:05.139
The course, the path that they would travel, the journey in which they would embark on,

00:14:05.139 --> 00:14:08.500
no doubt there would be difficulties along the way.

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:12.180
Just with any journey that you and I take, there's the potential for difficulties.

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:17.059
There's the potential for hazards along the way, but God provides them with the protection

00:14:17.059 --> 00:14:18.059
that was necessary.

00:14:18.059 --> 00:14:22.220
It reminds me that safety is of the Lord.

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:27.020
This evening, we need to understand that God fulfilled the promise when he said to him

00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:31.339
in verse number three, fear not to go down into Egypt, for I will there make of thee

00:14:31.339 --> 00:14:32.339
a great nation.

00:14:32.339 --> 00:14:39.300
I will go down with thee into Egypt, and Jacob and his family, they arrive in Egypt.

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:40.700
And what a blessing.

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:46.820
To consider this evening the safety of the Lord, the protection of God, and that God

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:49.239
gives us protection for the journey.

00:14:49.239 --> 00:14:55.820
There are times in our life that we very distinctly see God's hand of protection in our lives.

00:14:55.820 --> 00:15:00.260
Just this week, we had some things that happened within some of the folks within our congregation

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:04.500
that you have the opportunity to see the protective hand of God.

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:06.660
I'm thankful for God's protection.

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:10.660
I'm thankful this evening that when I look at this portion of Scripture and I think about

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:15.380
the context and understanding the historical account, that Jacob and his family literally

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:20.980
took a journey from Beersheba to Egypt, that God gave them some promises.

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:27.619
And when we understand and make application that our journey, God's given us some promises.

00:15:27.619 --> 00:15:32.339
That they had protection and God has protected us.

00:15:32.339 --> 00:15:37.339
Someone told me recently, and I was so encouraged and blessed, and I shared it with Holly and

00:15:37.339 --> 00:15:41.739
what a blessing it was, and I won't say the person's name so that they would not be embarrassed,

00:15:41.739 --> 00:15:48.140
but I was told by someone else how that this individual prayed our family safely back and

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:50.540
forth from Manassas for 10 years.

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:53.980
You know how that blessed my heart when I heard that?

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:58.020
You know how many accidents are on 66 every single day?

00:15:58.020 --> 00:15:59.820
We saw a real bad one just the other night.

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:02.820
We're coming back from a basketball game, and we saw a real bad one.

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:03.820
It just happened.

00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:06.540
I mean, all kinds of emergency vehicles were going, and we thought, man, there must be

00:16:06.739 --> 00:16:09.940
something real major that was going on, so we tried to look it up, and you can just see

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:15.179
when you try to look it up how fatal accident, fatal accident, on this day, on this day,

00:16:15.179 --> 00:16:19.700
on this day, God's protection.

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:22.739
Sometimes we just kind of take it for granted.

00:16:22.739 --> 00:16:28.980
But here, Jacob and his family, they had protection, and it's God that gave them the protection.

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:30.420
We must be mindful.

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:33.820
We must be thankful for God's protection in our lives.

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:36.540
A larger place here in terms of the book of Psalms, if you will, Psalm 73.

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:42.540
I want to look at a quick reference here in Psalm 73 as I try to package together these

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:49.739
first two thoughts from Genesis 46, promises for the journey and protection for the journey.

00:16:49.739 --> 00:16:55.260
And really, this passage in Psalm 73 will lead us to our final thought this evening

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:59.300
as we conclude Genesis chapter 46.

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:01.700
This is a Psalm that's ascribed to Asaph.

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:06.380
Those with me will look at verse 23, and I want you to think about this as we make

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:10.860
application with regard to the promises for the journey, protection for the journey.

00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:19.920
The Bible says in Psalm 73, verse 23, nevertheless, I am continually with thee.

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:23.300
Thou hast holden me by my right hand.

00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:29.260
Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory.

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:32.820
Keep that thought in mind for our final conclusion this evening.

00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:37.619
Verse 25, notice what the psalmist says, Whom have I in heaven but thee?

00:17:37.619 --> 00:17:40.220
There is none upon earth that I desire beside thee.

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:48.100
My flesh and my heart faileth, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:50.860
For lo, they that are far from thee shall perish.

00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:55.420
Thou hast destroyed all them that go a-whoring from thee.

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:58.920
But it is good for me to draw near to God.

00:17:58.959 --> 00:18:05.640
I've put my trust in the Lord God that I may declare all thy works.

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:09.000
I'm thankful for God's guidance and direction.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.800
I'm thankful for God's presence in this journey.

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:15.119
God's given us promises.

00:18:15.119 --> 00:18:17.119
God's given us protection.

00:18:17.119 --> 00:18:19.119
And we ought to rejoice in that this evening.

00:18:19.119 --> 00:18:26.239
Just as we see in the life of Jacob and his family, these souls that left Beersheba and

00:18:26.239 --> 00:18:32.559
traveled to Egypt, and what a blessing, and how those promises would give them the strength

00:18:32.559 --> 00:18:37.599
as they would trust that God would do what he said he would do, the protection along

00:18:37.599 --> 00:18:39.239
the way.

00:18:39.239 --> 00:18:44.160
We find this evening, even as I mentioned at the end of verse 24 of Psalm 73, and afterward

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:45.359
receive me to glory.

00:18:45.359 --> 00:18:51.440
I want you to notice as we continue in Genesis 46, number three, if you're taking notes,

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:52.880
the phenomenal reunion.

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:56.640
I just used the word to have a pee, to be honest with you.

00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:01.020
But it is a phenomenal reunion that takes place in Genesis 46.

00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:06.400
As we look at the end of the portion of this chapter, I want you to see what happens.

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:11.000
The Bible tells us in verse number 26, I read it a moment ago, that they arrived there in

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000
Egypt.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:18.799
It says in verse 27, and the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt, were two souls.

00:19:18.799 --> 00:19:23.720
All the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt, were threescore and ten.

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:30.799
And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face unto Goshen.

00:19:30.799 --> 00:19:32.979
And they came into the land of Goshen.

00:19:32.979 --> 00:19:39.039
Notice verse 29, and Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father

00:19:39.039 --> 00:19:42.119
to Goshen, and presented himself unto him.

00:19:42.119 --> 00:19:47.320
And he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:52.880
It's a wonderful reunion that God gives us a glimpse, a picture of what happens here

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:54.280
in Genesis 46.

00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:58.760
And as we could paint the picture and understand what's taking place, and really what a sweet

00:19:58.760 --> 00:19:59.880
reunion this is.

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:03.000
is that Jacob, no doubt along the journey

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.420
and how many days it took, we do not know for certainty,

00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:09.880
but we know that the duration of this journey,

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:14.380
I believe that Jacob was anticipating his arrival.

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:16.560
I believe that Jacob was looking forward

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:17.980
to how many more days.

00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:20.640
You ever been on a trip and the kids say how much longer?

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:22.040
And you hear it all the time.

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:23.240
And how much longer?

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:24.160
How much longer?

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:25.000
How much longer?

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.640
Road trips are just so enjoyable.

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:28.800
Brother Pierre loves road trips, right?

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:32.760
And we used to tell our kids 20 minutes, 20 minutes.

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:36.160
And, but the reality is that I believe

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:38.800
there's a great measure of anticipation.

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:39.640
Why?

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:42.640
He's going to see his son.

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:44.440
He thought he was dead,

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.140
but he found out he's alive.

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:52.240
He's anticipating this reunion.

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:54.840
I believe on the other end that Joseph,

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:57.800
he knew that he sent his brothers back home.

00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:01.840
He knew that he sent them home with goods and provision,

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:04.400
but also with instruction to return.

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:07.960
How many of you have ever shared your ETA

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:09.960
with your cell phone to someone

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:11.640
that you were going to visit?

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:13.720
You can send your little map thing and send,

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:16.740
here's my ETA and you can share your trip route,

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:17.640
so on and so forth.

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:18.840
You've done that.

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:22.540
Listen, they didn't have that back then, right?

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:25.400
There was no way of them being able to communicate

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:28.920
about this opportunity having, yeah, my, I won't say,

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:33.480
but the reality is that they didn't have that.

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:36.080
So what's Joseph doing?

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:39.160
I think Joseph's anxiously awaiting.

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:41.000
I think every day Armando,

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.800
he's looking out to see if they're coming.

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:45.920
He's anxiously awaiting, why?

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:48.080
Because he's going to see his dad.

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:49.640
You know what he said every single time

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:51.160
when he meets with his brothers?

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:55.760
He asks specifically, how's father?

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:57.080
How's my dad?

00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:59.920
He doesn't say it that way, but he's inquiring.

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:01.720
He wants to know.

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:04.240
And we find here that as we look at this passage

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:09.160
of Scripture that Jacob, he's anticipating their arrival.

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:12.080
Joseph is anxiously awaiting their arrival.

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:16.040
And we read that Jacob sends Judah ahead in verse 28

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:19.279
and Joseph was making ready his chariot in verse 29.

00:22:19.279 --> 00:22:21.440
And the Bible says that he went up to meet Israel,

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:22.800
his father, to Goshen.

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:26.080
Notice the Bible says, and he presented himself unto him

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:30.040
and he fell on his neck and he wept on his neck.

00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:33.440
Notice this, a good while.

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:35.480
I don't know how long a good while is.

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:37.720
It's just a good while.

00:22:38.559 --> 00:22:43.559
I think it was an embrace that was just so sweet.

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:46.600
Why?

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:48.960
Because neither one of them thought

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:50.600
they'd see each other ever again.

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:58.160
God gave them the opportunity to have this reunion.

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:00.880
Jacob, as we know in the text of Scripture,

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:03.760
is overwhelmed with gratitude for the Bible says

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:07.360
in verse number 30, after they had this embrace

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:09.559
and after they have had this reunion,

00:23:09.559 --> 00:23:12.240
that in verse number 30, it says that Israel said

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:17.240
unto Joseph, now let me die since I have seen thy face

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:23.360
because thou art yet alive.

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:25.720
You know, God gives them 17 years.

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:26.720
It's pretty amazing.

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:30.279
Joseph, as best we can tell, was 17

00:23:30.279 --> 00:23:32.440
when he was sold into slavery.

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:35.720
And then after Jacob would arrive there in Egypt,

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:37.040
he gets 17 years.

00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:41.160
And we see though the gratitude and the expression

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:44.279
that is made of Jacob with this delight

00:23:44.279 --> 00:23:46.000
of being able to see his son,

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.919
it's as if there's this completeness,

00:23:47.919 --> 00:23:51.680
this fulfillment, if you will, let me die.

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:52.520
Why?

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:53.880
Because I've seen you, you're alive.

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:58.000
And as we think about this passage of Scripture

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.520
and as we've sought to make application this evening,

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:03.040
we mentioned about the promises for the journey.

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:06.559
God's given us promises for our journey.

00:24:06.559 --> 00:24:09.120
We mentioned about the protection for the journey.

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:11.639
God's given us protection for our journey.

00:24:11.639 --> 00:24:16.640
But we see this grand reunion between Jacob and Joseph,

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:20.720
but really the entire family comes.

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.640
And I want you to understand this evening

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:25.080
that one day there's gonna be a grand reunion.

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:27.360
It's called heaven.

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:32.800
You sing the song, when we all get to heaven,

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:36.119
what a day of rejoicing that will be.

00:24:36.119 --> 00:24:37.399
I want you to understand this evening

00:24:37.399 --> 00:24:40.279
that the greatest thing about heaven is Jesus.

00:24:40.279 --> 00:24:43.080
The greatest thing about being in heaven

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:45.920
is the fact that we'll see our Savior face to face.

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:47.959
But I want you to understand this evening

00:24:47.959 --> 00:24:50.239
that just as we look at this text of Scripture

00:24:50.239 --> 00:24:51.959
and we see the promises for the journey,

00:24:51.959 --> 00:24:54.320
we see the protection for the journey,

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:57.200
God's given us promises, God's given us protection,

00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:59.679
and there's this reunion that takes place.

00:24:59.679 --> 00:25:02.239
And one day there's gonna be a grand reunion.

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:06.360
I called it a family reunion.

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:08.760
And oh, it's gonna be a family reunion.

00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:10.320
I want you to hold your, well, yeah,

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:11.679
hold your place here in Genesis 46.

00:25:11.679 --> 00:25:14.179
Turn to the book of 1 Thessalonians, if you will.

00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:17.760
In 1 Thessalonians chapter number four,

00:25:19.679 --> 00:25:22.520
as we think about this wonderful truth this evening

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:24.920
and we seek to make application,

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:26.440
remember the psalmist said,

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:30.339
as you're turning to 1 Thessalonians chapter number four,

00:25:30.339 --> 00:25:31.839
we read it just a moment ago,

00:25:31.839 --> 00:25:33.959
but the psalmist said in Psalm 73,

00:25:33.959 --> 00:25:37.640
and afterward, receive me to glory.

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:41.440
Paul said this, to be absent from the body

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:43.360
is to be present with the Lord,

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:46.720
having that assurance that we'll be with our Savior.

00:25:48.279 --> 00:25:49.720
In 1 Thessalonians chapter four,

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:51.320
beginning in verse number 13,

00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:52.920
the Bible says, but I would not have you

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:54.440
to be ignorant, brethren,

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:55.800
concerning them which are asleep,

00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:58.459
that you sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.

00:25:58.459 --> 00:26:01.440
Those are those that have died in Christ,

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:03.320
the believers that have died,

00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:06.320
that they have gone home to be with the Lord,

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:07.920
and Paul says that you sorrow not,

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:10.459
even as others which have no hope.

00:26:10.459 --> 00:26:13.760
We mentioned just this past Wednesday evening,

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:15.800
as we're studying through the end of chapter five

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:17.360
of the book of 1 Thessalonians,

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:19.899
about comforting those that are weak in spirit,

00:26:19.899 --> 00:26:21.559
those that are feeble-minded,

00:26:21.559 --> 00:26:24.360
and how some of the things that these believers

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:26.000
in Thessalonica had encountered,

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.360
and death of loved ones being one of them.

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:31.080
But Paul, as he continues, he says,

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:32.839
this in verse 14, for if we believe

00:26:32.839 --> 00:26:34.959
that Jesus died and rose again,

00:26:34.959 --> 00:26:37.279
and we do, we believe that truth,

00:26:37.279 --> 00:26:40.320
it's biblical truth, even so,

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:42.520
them also which sleep in Jesus

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:45.000
will God bring with him.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.600
Notice in verse 15, for this we say unto you,

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:50.600
by the word of the Lord.

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:53.559
This is not Paul just trying to give a motivational speech.

00:26:53.559 --> 00:26:56.360
This is not Paul just trying to rah-rah

00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:57.720
and try to encourage, no, he's saying,

00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:01.200
I'm speaking this by the word of the Lord,

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:03.399
that we which are alive and remain

00:27:03.399 --> 00:27:04.720
unto the coming of the Lord

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:07.480
shall not prevent them which are asleep.

00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:09.480
That means that we're not gonna go before them.

00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:12.279
He gives the order of the resurrection in the next verse.

00:27:12.279 --> 00:27:14.839
Notice in verse 16, for the Lord himself

00:27:14.839 --> 00:27:17.480
shall descend from heaven with a shout,

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:18.920
with the voice of the archangel,

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:20.360
and with the trump of God,

00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:24.300
and the dead in Christ shall rise first.

00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:28.700
Then, verse number 17, we which are alive and remain

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:33.220
shall be caught up together with them in the clouds

00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:34.779
to meet the Lord in the air,

00:27:34.779 --> 00:27:37.020
then notice this, and so shall,

00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:39.100
what's the next word in your Bible?

00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:41.140
What we, the very next word,

00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:46.140
and so shall we ever be with the Lord.

00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:52.080
There's gonna be a grand reunion one day.

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:54.080
There's some folks that have had some loved ones

00:27:54.899 --> 00:27:57.000
that have gone on to eternity before you.

00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:03.080
Your heart can be heavy for those loved ones.

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:05.640
You know, it's a wonderful truth of God's word

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:08.520
that if they're saved, we're gonna see them once again.

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.200
I mean, the greatest thing about heaven,

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:13.000
I wanna make sure I keep it within the focus of our minds,

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.200
the greatest thing about heaven

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:16.040
is not simply that there's gonna be a reunion,

00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:17.559
it's that Jesus is there,

00:28:17.559 --> 00:28:19.619
that I'm gonna see my heavenly father,

00:28:19.619 --> 00:28:21.720
that you're gonna see your heavenly father,

00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:23.720
just as Joseph had the opportunity to see

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:25.200
his earthly father,

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:27.920
we find that we'll see our heavenly father,

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:29.279
we'll see our savior,

00:28:29.279 --> 00:28:33.080
we'll see the one who died for us and rose again,

00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:34.359
but all of the same,

00:28:34.359 --> 00:28:36.380
listen, if you read the book of Revelation,

00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:38.160
you get to chapter four and five,

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:40.760
and what a scene in heaven.

00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:42.640
I mean, the throne room of heaven,

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:45.400
God gives us a glimpse into,

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:47.679
in Revelation chapter number four and five,

00:28:47.679 --> 00:28:50.239
a glimpse into the throne room of heaven.

00:28:50.239 --> 00:28:54.880
Oh, what a day of rejoicing that will be.

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:56.599
There's gonna be a grand reunion one day,

00:28:56.599 --> 00:28:57.720
listen, this world,

00:28:57.720 --> 00:28:58.840
I said on Wednesday night,

00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:00.260
this world is not my home,

00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:03.359
I'm just a passing through, amen.

00:29:03.359 --> 00:29:06.239
Listen, we're pilgrims and we're strangers,

00:29:06.239 --> 00:29:08.260
we understand that we live in this world,

00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:09.799
but we're not of this world,

00:29:09.799 --> 00:29:12.160
and as we look at Genesis chapter 46

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:14.520
and understanding the historical context

00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:16.239
and being able to gather

00:29:16.239 --> 00:29:18.919
from that passage of scripture what happens,

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:22.160
but then let's make some application for us,

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:24.599
because you're on a journey and I'm on a journey,

00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:27.979
but God's given us promises,

00:29:27.979 --> 00:29:30.200
just like he gave Jacob promises

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:32.160
to start this passage of scripture

00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:34.440
in Genesis 46 verses one through four,

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:36.960
God said, I am God,

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:39.559
and here's what I am going to do.

00:29:39.559 --> 00:29:41.599
You've been given some promises,

00:29:41.599 --> 00:29:43.960
you better know them and you better claim them.

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:45.340
I mean, just get in the book

00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:48.799
and get those promises and just begin to claim them.

00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:53.700
And then God's given protection to Jacob

00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:55.559
and to his family as they journeyed.

00:29:57.059 --> 00:29:58.619
God's given us protection.

00:29:58.619 --> 00:30:01.099
God's ways are perfect.

00:30:01.099 --> 00:30:03.339
God makes no mistakes.

00:30:03.339 --> 00:30:06.939
And when God's ready for us to go to heaven, we're going to go to heaven.

00:30:06.939 --> 00:30:10.899
We're going to take a final breath here on earth and we're going to be transported

00:30:10.899 --> 00:30:13.019
into the very presence of our God.

00:30:13.019 --> 00:30:14.019
Hallelujah.

00:30:14.019 --> 00:30:19.499
Honestly, I'm hoping that Jesus comes back before I take my final breath and die a physical

00:30:19.499 --> 00:30:20.499
death.

00:30:20.499 --> 00:30:23.139
I'm hoping that Jesus comes back.

00:30:23.139 --> 00:30:24.719
Listen for the trumpet.

00:30:24.719 --> 00:30:26.179
Jesus is coming.

00:30:26.179 --> 00:30:28.879
So many people looking around this year.

00:30:28.879 --> 00:30:29.879
Things that are going on.

00:30:29.879 --> 00:30:30.879
Do you see this?

00:30:30.879 --> 00:30:31.879
Do you see that?

00:30:31.879 --> 00:30:32.879
It's got to be close.

00:30:32.879 --> 00:30:33.879
So on and so forth.

00:30:33.879 --> 00:30:36.839
Listen, we just need to be busy doing what God's called us to do, because he's going

00:30:36.839 --> 00:30:38.679
to come at the right time.

00:30:38.679 --> 00:30:39.679
On time.

00:30:39.679 --> 00:30:40.679
He's not going to be a minute late.

00:30:40.679 --> 00:30:43.079
He's not going to be a minute early.

00:30:43.079 --> 00:30:49.119
But I want you to know that just as Jacob and his family, they arrive in Egypt and there's

00:30:49.119 --> 00:30:54.399
just a great reunion that takes place.

00:30:54.399 --> 00:30:56.859
One day there's going to be a great reunion.

00:30:56.859 --> 00:31:01.419
When we all get to heaven, what a day of rejoicing that will be.

00:31:01.419 --> 00:31:03.539
We'll see our Savior face to face.

00:31:03.539 --> 00:31:04.539
Oh, what glory.

00:31:04.539 --> 00:31:09.499
You know, sometimes I hear people talk about heaven and they talk about streets of gold

00:31:09.499 --> 00:31:10.859
and this, that, and the other thing.

00:31:10.859 --> 00:31:17.859
Listen, all those things are fine and good, but all those things without Jesus, it's nothing.

00:31:17.859 --> 00:31:19.819
It's nothing.

00:31:19.819 --> 00:31:23.379
What makes heaven heaven is Jesus.

00:31:23.379 --> 00:31:25.839
And one day we're going to be there.

00:31:25.839 --> 00:31:29.159
And you know, we're going to rejoice forever and ever.

00:31:29.159 --> 00:31:32.759
Sometimes the clock can become an enemy to church.

00:31:32.759 --> 00:31:37.839
Say, man, it's time has gone by, we got to get out, things to do, so on and so forth.

00:31:37.839 --> 00:31:39.119
And we're going to be outside of time.

00:31:39.119 --> 00:31:45.719
We're just going to be rejoicing and worshiping and singing praise and having this grand reunion.

00:31:45.719 --> 00:31:48.279
You ever have a family reunion?

00:31:48.279 --> 00:31:51.319
I remember as a kid having a family reunion.

00:31:51.319 --> 00:31:56.419
You go to those family reunions and as a kid you don't know any of the people.

00:31:56.419 --> 00:31:58.339
What's going on?

00:31:58.339 --> 00:32:02.339
Pinch your cheeks and all that kind of nonsense, right?

00:32:02.339 --> 00:32:06.059
Then I've not gone to a family reunion in years, it almost seems, and I don't mean this

00:32:06.059 --> 00:32:10.419
to sound dark, but it almost seems like for some families and it's happened in our family

00:32:10.419 --> 00:32:16.419
that funerals almost become a family reunion.

00:32:16.419 --> 00:32:21.299
But I want you to know for the people of God, for brothers and sisters in Christ, the redeemed,

00:32:22.279 --> 00:32:23.879
we're going to be in heaven one day.

00:32:23.879 --> 00:32:25.879
What a reunion that's going to be.

00:32:25.879 --> 00:32:32.799
Listen, live for Jesus, live to please Him, live to tell others about Jesus.

00:32:32.799 --> 00:32:33.799
Why?

00:32:33.799 --> 00:32:36.879
Because if they die without Him, they're not going to be there.

00:32:36.879 --> 00:32:39.319
They're not going to be there.

00:32:39.319 --> 00:32:42.039
The Bible makes it very plain and very clear.

00:32:42.039 --> 00:32:43.519
There's one way to get to heaven.

00:32:43.519 --> 00:32:45.080
Jesus is the only way.

00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:49.360
He said, I am the way, the truth, and the life.

00:32:49.419 --> 00:32:52.860
No man cometh unto the Father but by me.

00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:59.339
It's a joy to have brothers and sisters in Christ from every nation, tribe, language.

00:32:59.339 --> 00:33:00.860
I mean, it's going to be a grand reunion.

00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:05.519
We're going to worship God for all of eternity, it's going to be awesome.

00:33:05.519 --> 00:33:10.619
We see Jacob, we see Genesis 46, but we make some application for our lives, claim the

00:33:10.619 --> 00:33:16.899
promises, recognize His protection, and look forward to great anticipation to the day that

00:33:16.899 --> 00:33:19.339
we meet our Savior face to face.

00:33:19.339 --> 00:33:20.339
Let's pray together.

00:33:20.339 --> 00:33:21.519
Father, we love You.

00:33:21.519 --> 00:33:22.720
We thank You for loving us.

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:25.239
We thank You, God, for Your Word.

00:33:25.239 --> 00:33:32.080
And as we have opportunity to be able to see historically this event that You've recorded

00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:40.879
for us and how grateful we are for Your promises that You gave to Jacob and how they sustained

00:33:40.879 --> 00:33:41.879
him along the way.

00:33:41.879 --> 00:33:47.299
We thank You for Your protection that's obvious through the text of Scripture and their arrival

00:33:47.299 --> 00:33:48.299
to Egypt.

00:33:48.299 --> 00:33:55.179
And then we see that reunion and, Lord, how our heart rejoices to even imagine that event

00:33:55.179 --> 00:33:56.500
that took place.

00:33:56.500 --> 00:34:02.899
And God, I pray that You would help us this evening, Lord, to understand that You've given

00:34:02.899 --> 00:34:05.139
us many promises in Your Word.

00:34:05.139 --> 00:34:07.779
Help us to know them and to claim them.

00:34:07.779 --> 00:34:11.220
I pray that they would sustain us in this journey called life.

00:34:12.139 --> 00:34:17.899
And God, I pray that we would acknowledge, rejoice in Your protection that You give us.

00:34:17.899 --> 00:34:24.619
Lord, I pray that we'd live every day anticipating Your soon return, looking forward with great

00:34:24.619 --> 00:34:29.699
excitement and anticipation of that wonderful day that we'll see You face to face.

00:34:29.699 --> 00:34:35.540
God, I pray that You would be glorified in and through our lives, that You would have

00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:36.540
Your will and way.

00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:40.380
I pray this evening, Lord, that as we have an opportunity to have a time of invitation,

00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:44.979
I pray, Lord, that You'd help us to just kind of thank You, Lord, for the promises and for

00:34:44.979 --> 00:34:45.979
Your protection.

00:34:45.979 --> 00:34:51.100
Lord, that we would desire to live for You all the days of our lives, that there's someone

00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:52.100
here that's not saved.

00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:56.540
Lord, I pray that You'd help them to see their need for Christ, that before it's eternally

00:34:56.540 --> 00:35:01.100
too late, they would place their faith and trust in the finished work of Jesus.

00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:05.199
This moment of invitation, I pray, God, that You'd move and work, guide and direct as only

00:35:05.199 --> 00:35:06.199
You can.

00:35:06.199 --> 00:35:10.139
And we're certain to thank You for what You'll do, for it's in Christ's name we pray.

00:35:10.139 --> 00:35:11.139
Amen.

00:35:11.139 --> 00:35:11.139
