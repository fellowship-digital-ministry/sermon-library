1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,640
chapter tonight, Genesis 48, it's only 22 verses,

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:08,039
and this is message number 97 through the book of Genesis,

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,880
and we are near the very end,

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,840
and chapter 49 and then chapter 50.

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,120
I do not believe that I will be able to get

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,200
through chapter 49 in one message,

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,799
it's probably gonna take two,

8
00:00:20,799 --> 00:00:24,000
and then probably two for chapter 50 as well,

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
but we are nearing the end,

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,079
and I have been praying about where to go

11
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:31,379
on Sunday evenings for our new series,

12
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:32,880
it's been a long time that we've been

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,720
in the book of Genesis, and obviously message 97,

14
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,700
but also we had some other things going on

15
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,000
on Sunday evenings, different periods of time,

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,400
I did a period of time where we did

17
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,880
Ask the Pastor on Sunday night, and what have you,

18
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,360
and so it's been a number of years

19
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,119
that we've been sending through the book of Genesis,

20
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:51,439
and by the way, let me say this,

21
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:53,959
I'm thankful for, we heard testimonies tonight,

22
00:00:53,959 --> 00:00:55,599
Brother Mark and Brother Isaac,

23
00:00:55,599 --> 00:00:57,200
they both said about God's word,

24
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,080
I'm thankful for Genesis to Revelation, amen,

25
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,959
and all God's word is profitable,

26
00:01:02,959 --> 00:01:04,440
the Bible says all scripture is given

27
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,519
by inspiration of God, and is profitable

28
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:10,559
in the context of 2 Timothy chapter number three,

29
00:01:10,559 --> 00:01:12,639
we know that Paul says to Timothy,

30
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:17,000
and that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures,

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,120
what's he talking about, he's talking about

32
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,559
the Old Testament, which are able

33
00:01:19,559 --> 00:01:22,919
to make thee wise unto salvation,

34
00:01:22,919 --> 00:01:26,599
and what a blessing, Paul says to the folks

35
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:28,879
in Rome, to the people in Corinth,

36
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:31,319
that God's word, that which was written aforetime,

37
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:34,360
was written for our learning, written for our admonition,

38
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,480
and I am thankful for the Old Testament,

39
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,319
God gives us very important principles,

40
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:43,000
and I am thankful for those principles,

41
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,959
and what a blessing to have God's word.

42
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:48,760
In Genesis chapter 47, we spent two weeks

43
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,400
looking at that portion of scripture,

44
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,720
and through Genesis 47, we learn

45
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,120
that God used Joseph to take care of his family,

46
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,839
and of course, we know that Jacob was called for by Joseph

47
00:02:00,839 --> 00:02:03,440
as the brothers went back with the goods,

48
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,239
and said, Joseph is alive, and he said to return,

49
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:09,399
and we find that as they were preparing to depart,

50
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:12,679
that God appeared to Jacob in chapter number 46,

51
00:02:12,679 --> 00:02:14,479
and said, go, and I'll be with thee,

52
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:17,440
and in that place, I will build of thee a great nation,

53
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,080
and we find that God was doing just that,

54
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,839
and we read of that in chapter 47,

55
00:02:21,839 --> 00:02:24,720
we learned how God provided for his people,

56
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,279
they received a place, and they received the best place,

57
00:02:28,279 --> 00:02:30,080
according to Genesis 47,

58
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,279
and we find that not only did they have a place,

59
00:02:32,279 --> 00:02:34,039
but they received provision,

60
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:37,080
and they had their needs taken care of,

61
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,320
I'm thankful that as our shepherd,

62
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,759
that God gives us all that we need,

63
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:44,559
he provides for us, he is a good God,

64
00:02:44,559 --> 00:02:47,639
he is a good shepherd, and I'm thankful for that.

65
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:51,080
We find, the Bible tells us, there in Genesis 47,

66
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,279
the end of the chapter, in verse 28,

67
00:02:53,279 --> 00:02:58,279
that Jacob lived there in Egypt for 17 years.

68
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,559
As we enter into Genesis chapter 48,

69
00:03:00,559 --> 00:03:02,559
we find that the text of scripture begins

70
00:03:02,559 --> 00:03:05,919
by informing us that Jacob is sick,

71
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:08,199
we find that this sickness that is mentioned

72
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:11,000
is obviously a serious situation,

73
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,600
for upon hearing of the news,

74
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:17,600
Joseph gets a word of the circumstances of the situation,

75
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:20,039
he gets his two boys, Ephraim and Manasseh,

76
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:22,639
or Manasseh and Ephraim, oldest youngest,

77
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:24,240
we find that he gets his two sons,

78
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,520
and he heads over, I would say this,

79
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,880
to have a visit with his dad.

80
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,639
We find that the text of scripture,

81
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:32,119
the details of this meeting,

82
00:03:32,119 --> 00:03:34,520
are provided here in Genesis 48.

83
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,320
I'll begin reading in verse number one,

84
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,320
the Bible says this, and it came to pass

85
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,639
after these things, after those 17 years

86
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:43,600
in which they were there in Egypt,

87
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,160
that one told Joseph, notice the message,

88
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,759
behold, thy father is sick,

89
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:52,960
and he, Joseph, took with him his two sons,

90
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,000
Manasseh and Ephraim, and one told Jacob

91
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,639
and said, behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee,

92
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:04,639
and Israel strengthened himself and sat upon the bed.

93
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:07,240
We'll read the entirety of the text this evening,

94
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,800
but I wanna give you, you know, it's amazing,

95
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,880
the Bible is an awesome book, it's a living book,

96
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,679
and I said this this morning,

97
00:04:14,679 --> 00:04:16,359
but I'll say it again this evening,

98
00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:20,040
the best commentary on the Bible is the Bible.

99
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,720
I don't know who originally coined that phrase,

100
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,160
I know that I heard Clarence Sexton say that

101
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,440
a number of times during his ministry,

102
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,679
but the Bible is an awesome book,

103
00:04:29,679 --> 00:04:32,480
it's a living book, it is God's word,

104
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,000
and I want you to hold your place here in Genesis 48,

105
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,600
but take with me just for a moment

106
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,600
over to Hebrews chapter number 11.

107
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,519
In Hebrews chapter number 11,

108
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:45,720
God gives us just a simple verse of scripture

109
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,799
that really in this simple verse of scripture,

110
00:04:48,799 --> 00:04:51,359
I believe that great light is shed

111
00:04:51,359 --> 00:04:55,440
upon the meeting that we read of in Genesis 48,

112
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,799
and we find that in Hebrews chapter 11,

113
00:04:57,799 --> 00:05:01,040
many of us would refer to this passage of scripture

114
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,320
as the great hall of faith, if you will,

115
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,279
and we read of all of the great things

116
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:08,799
that were accomplished, and we find that in verse 21,

117
00:05:08,799 --> 00:05:12,000
notice what the Bible says in Hebrews 11 and verse 21,

118
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
by faith Jacob, when he was a dying,

119
00:05:17,559 --> 00:05:20,799
blessed both the sons of Joseph.

120
00:05:20,799 --> 00:05:22,600
That's what we're talking about in Genesis 48,

121
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,440
that is, Genesis 48 is the record

122
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,160
of what is being referred to here

123
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,559
in Hebrews chapter 11 and verse 21,

124
00:05:30,559 --> 00:05:32,880
when Jacob is going to die

125
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,600
and he blesses the two sons of Joseph.

126
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,880
The other blessings are recorded in Genesis 49

127
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,480
for the other sons, but the sons of Joseph in chapter 48,

128
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,480
notice this next phrase that says,

129
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:50,040
and worshiped, and worshiped,

130
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,399
leaning upon the top of his staff.

131
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:57,839
Why did he have a staff?

132
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:00,119
Because he wrestled with the Lord one night

133
00:06:00,119 --> 00:06:04,239
and God touched his thigh, right?

134
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:08,519
And I believe that for the rest of his days, he had a limp.

135
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:14,000
And he remembered, I preached on this

136
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,799
when we dealt with that passage of scripture,

137
00:06:15,799 --> 00:06:17,000
but it really comes up again

138
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,399
as we look at this tonight in Genesis 48,

139
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:22,880
and so we see that he's leaning upon his staff,

140
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,119
and it's not just because of his old age,

141
00:06:25,119 --> 00:06:28,119
it's not just because of the health circumstances

142
00:06:28,119 --> 00:06:29,440
that are leading to his death

143
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,519
that we're speaking of in Genesis 48,

144
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:34,760
but we find that he had that staff for a long time,

145
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,480
and it was a reminder of an event

146
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,519
that took place in his life,

147
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:41,399
but I want you to see also that in Hebrews 11, verse 21,

148
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:45,799
it says that he worshiped, that he worshiped.

149
00:06:45,799 --> 00:06:48,480
Now, I like that, I was beginning

150
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,200
as I was preparing this week

151
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,399
and looking through this portion of scripture in Genesis 48,

152
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:55,239
and I was reminded of Hebrews 11,

153
00:06:55,239 --> 00:06:57,720
and I'm thinking as I'm reading through the context,

154
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,839
turn back to Genesis 48, if you will,

155
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,480
and as you're reading through the context,

156
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,679
if you're not careful, you can look at Genesis 48

157
00:07:04,679 --> 00:07:08,480
and just look at a meeting between a father and a son,

158
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,880
and two grandsons, and you can look at a discussion,

159
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,959
an interaction that's taking place,

160
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:17,959
but indeed, God says he worshiped, he worshiped.

161
00:07:19,359 --> 00:07:23,000
By the way, God is worthy of our worship.

162
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,559
He alone is to be worshiped.

163
00:07:25,559 --> 00:07:27,799
The word worship means chiefly and eminently

164
00:07:27,799 --> 00:07:32,799
the act of paying divine honors to the supreme being.

165
00:07:35,119 --> 00:07:37,700
Of course, we know that is our Lord and Savior.

166
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,660
I'm so thankful that the God of the universe is my father.

167
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,899
Isn't that awesome?

168
00:07:41,899 --> 00:07:43,380
You think about that, our heavenly father,

169
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,059
the God of the universe, the one who said,

170
00:07:45,059 --> 00:07:47,859
"'Let there be light,' and there was light."

171
00:07:47,859 --> 00:07:49,700
And we find that in Genesis 48,

172
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,779
as God gives us the record of this interaction

173
00:07:52,779 --> 00:07:55,220
and the people that are there,

174
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,440
the setting, the conversation,

175
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,579
but the Bible says that he worshiped.

176
00:08:00,579 --> 00:08:02,820
Keep that in mind as we go through the text this evening.

177
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:06,100
I've titled the message really here in verse number 14.

178
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,940
The Bible says, in Israel,

179
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,700
Jacob stretched out his right hand

180
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,660
and laid it upon Ephraim's head,

181
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:15,320
who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head.

182
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,619
Notice it says, guiding his hands wittingly,

183
00:08:18,619 --> 00:08:20,820
for Manasseh was the firstborn.

184
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:21,859
And I've just titled the message,

185
00:08:21,859 --> 00:08:24,859
Jacob guided his hands wittingly.

186
00:08:24,859 --> 00:08:26,660
As we look at this portion of scripture,

187
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,779
I want you to notice a few thoughts this evening.

188
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:31,059
Number one, notice his praise.

189
00:08:31,059 --> 00:08:34,840
Notice the praise of Jacob in this text of scripture.

190
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,799
We find that Joseph arrives,

191
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,320
Jacob is told that Joseph is coming,

192
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,080
and it says that Israel, in the end of verse number two,

193
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,760
that he strengthened himself and sat upon the bed.

194
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,159
And notice in verse three,

195
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:50,559
this is where we begin to see the praise of Jacob.

196
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:53,760
It says, and Jacob said unto Joseph,

197
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,520
notice how he's praising the Lord,

198
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,119
and by the way, praise is part of worship.

199
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:04,520
We find that the Bible says that Jacob says to Joseph,

200
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:09,520
God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz,

201
00:09:09,599 --> 00:09:11,880
and the land of Canaan, notice what he says,

202
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,140
and blessed me.

203
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,799
And, notice verse number four,

204
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:21,159
and said unto me, behold, I will make thee fruitful,

205
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:23,559
and multiply thee, and I will make of thee

206
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:26,799
a multitude of people, and will give this land

207
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:31,520
to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession.

208
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,679
And so we find that in verse number three and four,

209
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:37,719
that Jacob, Israel, as he's meeting with his son

210
00:09:37,719 --> 00:09:41,919
and his grandsons, as he's nearing the end of his life,

211
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:46,919
he's going to die, the Bible says that this meeting begins

212
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,159
with praise.

213
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:52,039
That Jacob is looking back to the past,

214
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:55,479
he's looking at what God has done for him,

215
00:09:55,479 --> 00:09:57,919
and how God has worked in his life.

216
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:00,239
He says, God appeared to me.

217
00:10:00,239 --> 00:10:04,779
he says, God blessed me, he said, God has promised me.

218
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:07,279
Notice, if you will, in verse number 15,

219
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,559
the Bible says this after he guides his hands

220
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:13,959
wittingly in verse 14, the Bible says in verse 15,

221
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:16,419
and he blessed Joseph and said,

222
00:10:16,419 --> 00:10:21,419
God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk,

223
00:10:21,599 --> 00:10:23,139
the God, notice what he says,

224
00:10:23,139 --> 00:10:28,139
which fed me all my life long unto this day.

225
00:10:28,139 --> 00:10:31,139
You know what Jacob's doing?

226
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:34,859
He's recognizing the blessings of God.

227
00:10:34,859 --> 00:10:37,179
He is praising the Lord.

228
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:39,579
He's taking the opportunity.

229
00:10:39,579 --> 00:10:44,579
And by the way, our kids ought to hear us praise God, amen.

230
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,459
Our grandkids ought to hear us.

231
00:10:46,459 --> 00:10:47,459
If you have children,

232
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:49,419
if you are blessed to have grandchildren,

233
00:10:49,419 --> 00:10:50,979
they ought to hear you praise the Lord.

234
00:10:50,979 --> 00:10:53,399
They ought to know that God is real in your life.

235
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:55,379
They ought to know that God's answering prayer,

236
00:10:55,379 --> 00:10:58,619
that God's working and what God has done.

237
00:10:58,619 --> 00:11:00,319
Listen, the kids in our church,

238
00:11:00,319 --> 00:11:01,899
they need to hear it from their parents

239
00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:02,859
and from their grandparents,

240
00:11:02,859 --> 00:11:05,299
but they need to hear it from other church members.

241
00:11:05,299 --> 00:11:06,999
The Bible speaks of in the book of Titus

242
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,059
about the aged women and the aged men

243
00:11:09,059 --> 00:11:11,019
and the roles and the responsibilities

244
00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:13,299
and how we invest in that next generation

245
00:11:13,299 --> 00:11:15,539
and they're able to see that our God is real

246
00:11:15,539 --> 00:11:19,919
and our God works and our God, he is worthy of our praise.

247
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:21,739
And we find this evening that is,

248
00:11:21,979 --> 00:11:26,259
I want you to think about Joseph and Manasseh and Ephraim

249
00:11:26,259 --> 00:11:28,819
entering into the presence of Jacob.

250
00:11:28,819 --> 00:11:33,379
These grandsons of Jacob, of Israel's grandsons,

251
00:11:33,379 --> 00:11:36,959
these boys were born in Egypt.

252
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,979
All they knew was Egypt.

253
00:11:40,939 --> 00:11:43,499
In just a few moments, we're gonna continue to read,

254
00:11:43,499 --> 00:11:45,459
we find that really what Jacob does

255
00:11:45,459 --> 00:11:47,579
is he adopts these boys as his own

256
00:11:48,479 --> 00:11:52,139
for the purpose of the blessing that he's going to give.

257
00:11:52,139 --> 00:11:54,539
But I want you to recognize that as Jacob

258
00:11:54,539 --> 00:11:58,579
is speaking to his boys, to his son and to his grandsons,

259
00:11:58,579 --> 00:12:02,019
he wants them to know the God of the universe.

260
00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:04,139
He says, notice how he begins.

261
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:06,059
He says to Joseph, but the boys are there.

262
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,059
Now, I understand that Jacob,

263
00:12:08,059 --> 00:12:09,339
as we go through the text of scripture,

264
00:12:09,339 --> 00:12:11,419
he actually is not fully aware

265
00:12:11,419 --> 00:12:13,059
that the boys are there for this meeting.

266
00:12:13,059 --> 00:12:14,619
He finds out a little bit later.

267
00:12:14,619 --> 00:12:17,499
His eyesight, he cannot see, all right?

268
00:12:18,219 --> 00:12:19,139
So he's told that Joseph is there,

269
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:23,099
but I want you to think about what Manasseh and Ephraim heard.

270
00:12:23,099 --> 00:12:28,099
God Almighty, God Almighty appeared to me.

271
00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:32,819
God promised me, he blessed me.

272
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:37,579
God has taken care of me, he has provided for me.

273
00:12:37,579 --> 00:12:39,579
It's important for a next generation

274
00:12:39,579 --> 00:12:43,179
to know how God has provided for us.

275
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:46,819
Listen, I understand that God has given many people

276
00:12:46,819 --> 00:12:49,219
a good career and a good opportunity

277
00:12:49,219 --> 00:12:51,939
and so on and so forth, but we better recognize

278
00:12:51,939 --> 00:12:56,379
that it's God's hand of blessing, amen?

279
00:12:56,379 --> 00:12:57,779
Deuteronomy says it's God

280
00:12:57,779 --> 00:12:59,859
that gives you the ability to get wealth.

281
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:05,419
And we better recognize that it's not just in our ability

282
00:13:05,419 --> 00:13:07,859
and our talents, no, God gave us those talents

283
00:13:07,859 --> 00:13:10,819
and those abilities, he gave us those opportunities,

284
00:13:10,819 --> 00:13:14,459
and we find that Jacob says that God fed me

285
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:17,419
all my life long unto this day.

286
00:13:17,419 --> 00:13:21,259
I mean, those are good lessons for Joseph

287
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:24,699
and for Manasseh and Ephraim as he's praising the Lord,

288
00:13:24,699 --> 00:13:28,459
as he's worshiping here in this meeting

289
00:13:28,459 --> 00:13:30,059
with Joseph and his boys.

290
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,859
We see the praise, I've said this

291
00:13:32,859 --> 00:13:35,579
for my second thought this evening, his present.

292
00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:38,559
We see that really the praise is dealing with the past,

293
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:41,019
but notice in the present what's taking place.

294
00:13:41,019 --> 00:13:44,899
In verse number five, it says, and now thy two sons,

295
00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:46,819
thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh,

296
00:13:46,819 --> 00:13:48,859
which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt

297
00:13:48,859 --> 00:13:50,859
before I came unto thee into Egypt,

298
00:13:50,859 --> 00:13:52,959
notice what he says, they are mine.

299
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,539
As Reuben and Simeon, they, speaking of Manasseh and Ephraim,

300
00:13:58,539 --> 00:14:01,739
they shall be mine.

301
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:06,459
And thy issue, which thou begettest after them,

302
00:14:06,459 --> 00:14:08,319
shall be thine and shall be called

303
00:14:08,319 --> 00:14:11,759
after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.

304
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:12,959
You know, when they divide the land,

305
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:17,959
there's the tribe of Manasseh and the tribe of Ephraim,

306
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,559
because Jacob says they are mine.

307
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:22,919
He adopts them.

308
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:26,039
But notice as it continues, he says in verse number seven,

309
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:28,519
as for me, when I came from Paddan,

310
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:32,279
Rachel died by me in the land of Cana in the way,

311
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:36,079
when yet there was but a little way to come unto Ephrath,

312
00:14:36,119 --> 00:14:38,799
and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath,

313
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:41,000
the same as Bethlehem.

314
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,679
And Israel beheld Joseph's sons and said, who are these?

315
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:45,599
He could not see, we're gonna see that in a moment.

316
00:14:45,599 --> 00:14:47,319
In verse nine, Joseph said unto his father,

317
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:50,319
they are my sons, whom God hath given me in this place.

318
00:14:50,319 --> 00:14:52,199
And he said, bring them, I pray thee unto me,

319
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:53,479
and I will bless them.

320
00:14:53,479 --> 00:14:54,919
And so it's very interesting,

321
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:58,199
Jacob is saying the things about Manasseh and Ephraim

322
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:01,759
really without having the visual understanding

323
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:03,160
that they're there present.

324
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,679
He's not saying what he said in the previous verses

325
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:07,639
just because of their presence.

326
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:10,119
He's saying it because he's prophesying

327
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:13,319
about what will be.

328
00:15:13,319 --> 00:15:16,199
And we find that now he says, the boys,

329
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:17,319
he says, bring them to me.

330
00:15:17,319 --> 00:15:21,839
In verse number 10, now the eyes of Israel were dim for age

331
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,599
so that he could not see.

332
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,359
And he brought them near unto him

333
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:28,119
and he kissed them and embraced them.

334
00:15:28,119 --> 00:15:31,759
Can you imagine in your mind's eye that setting?

335
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,959
I think that's a sweet moment

336
00:15:34,359 --> 00:15:37,759
just a human relationship type of moment.

337
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,319
But notice the Bible says in verse number 11,

338
00:15:40,319 --> 00:15:42,279
and Israel said unto Joseph,

339
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:44,639
notice what he says when he's rejoicing again

340
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,199
with regard to his present,

341
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:48,039
he speaks as we think about his praise

342
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:50,880
with regard to the past and what God has done,

343
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,359
but God was still working and blessing.

344
00:15:53,359 --> 00:15:55,519
In verse 11, Israel said unto Joseph,

345
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,000
I had not thought to see thy face.

346
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,119
No doubt, Jacob had no thought

347
00:16:02,119 --> 00:16:04,759
that he would ever see Joseph again.

348
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:07,039
In his mind, Joseph was dead.

349
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:10,359
He'd been told a story.

350
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:14,519
He'd been led to believe a lie.

351
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:17,239
The brothers bring back a coat of many colors

352
00:16:17,239 --> 00:16:19,000
that was dipped in blood

353
00:16:20,239 --> 00:16:22,639
and simply said, do you know whose this is?

354
00:16:23,599 --> 00:16:26,959
They were certain that Jacob would be able

355
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,319
to recognize that coat of many colors.

356
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,959
And Joseph, the owner of that coat,

357
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,279
the one that Jacob had bestowed that coat upon,

358
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:39,000
he says, Joseph, no doubt as rent in pieces

359
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,160
an evil beast hath devoured him.

360
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:46,000
And he had no thought that he would ever see his son again.

361
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,199
And he says in verse number 11, notice,

362
00:16:48,199 --> 00:16:49,919
think about the praise and the setting.

363
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,959
He said, I had not thought to see thy face

364
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:56,959
and lo, God hath showed me also thy seed.

365
00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:01,160
Not only has God blessed me to be able

366
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,119
to see you, my son, again,

367
00:17:03,119 --> 00:17:07,199
but I've had the opportunity to see your children.

368
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,039
Now remember, he was there for 17 years.

369
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:15,479
This is when he's sick and he's going to die.

370
00:17:15,479 --> 00:17:18,799
I don't know, the Bible does not record for us

371
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:22,720
those 17 years, the details of any interactions

372
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,319
between Joseph and Jacob and his family.

373
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,039
We have no idea, God doesn't give us all of that,

374
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:32,599
but we find that for 17 years, Jacob lived in Egypt.

375
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:35,919
And Jacob says, I didn't think I'd see you

376
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,239
and God's been so good to me to allow me

377
00:17:39,239 --> 00:17:40,799
not only to see your face again,

378
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,679
but to see grandchildren.

379
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,679
That's a blessing.

380
00:17:45,639 --> 00:17:49,799
And again, Jacob is recognizing God.

381
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:51,399
He's worshiping the Lord.

382
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:54,359
I want you to notice as we continue reading

383
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:58,160
throughout the end of the chapter, his prophecy.

384
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,440
We see the prophecy, the blessing, if you will,

385
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,519
in verse number 12, the Bible says that Joseph

386
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:05,199
brought them out from between his knees

387
00:18:05,199 --> 00:18:07,959
and he bowed himself with his face to the earth

388
00:18:07,959 --> 00:18:11,119
and Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand

389
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:14,799
toward Israel's left hand, Manasseh in his left hand

390
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:18,519
toward Israel's right hand and brought them near unto him.

391
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:20,119
And so in your mind's eye this evening,

392
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:23,440
if you could picture that Jacob is here

393
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,519
and Joseph is here and Joseph's going to present

394
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:29,319
his two sons to his father.

395
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:32,160
And Jacob is sitting, the Bible said that he got himself,

396
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,000
he strengthened himself and got on the side of the bed there

397
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,039
and the Bible says that Jacob is there

398
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,359
and so his left is here, his right is here,

399
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:42,719
but Joseph takes Ephraim and he puts Ephraim

400
00:18:42,719 --> 00:18:45,679
to the left hand of Jacob.

401
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,599
And he puts Manasseh to the right hand of Jacob.

402
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:49,919
Now why is that?

403
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,279
Well, because the right hand in that culture

404
00:18:52,279 --> 00:18:54,239
would signify the blessing.

405
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,279
And we find that the Bible tells us

406
00:18:58,279 --> 00:19:02,599
that as Joseph put them in that position,

407
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:05,640
remember, Jacob could not see.

408
00:19:06,719 --> 00:19:09,839
So Joseph takes it upon himself to put the boys

409
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:13,320
in the order in which he believes they are to be.

410
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,880
And the Bible says in verse 14,

411
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,159
and Israel stretched out his right hand.

412
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:21,599
And notice it says that he laid it upon Ephraim's head.

413
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:26,159
So he does like this, he doesn't go like this,

414
00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:27,880
he goes like this.

415
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:33,000
And then the Bible says, who was the younger

416
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,239
in his left hand upon Manasseh's head.

417
00:19:36,239 --> 00:19:38,279
So he has his hands like this.

418
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:41,839
And we find that the Bible says,

419
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:45,359
guiding his hands wittingly.

420
00:19:46,239 --> 00:19:49,880
For Manasseh was the firstborn.

421
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:54,880
So Manasseh's directly across from his right hand,

422
00:19:55,159 --> 00:19:58,440
but that's not the one that's received the blessing.

423
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,640
It's Ephraim that's to receive the blessing.

424
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,240
And we find that it says that he guided his hand.

425
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,800
This was not some mistake.

426
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,320
In fact, Joseph, if you look, it says in verse 15,

427
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,600
and he blessed Joseph and said,

428
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,640
God, before whom my fathers, Abraham and Isaac, did walk,

429
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,180
the God which fed me all my life long until this day,

430
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:18,360
the angel which redeemed me from all evil,

431
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:22,120
bless the lads and let my name be named on them

432
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,360
in the name of my fathers, Abraham and Isaac,

433
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,200
and let them grow into the multitude

434
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,200
in the midst of the earth.

435
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,080
Do you see, remember, in verse number four,

436
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:33,360
he said, they're mine, I'm adopting them, they are mine.

437
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,440
And we find that he says, let my name,

438
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,840
in the name, let my name be named on them.

439
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,560
That they would understand that they're not Egyptians.

440
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,280
Right, that's what he's saying.

441
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:50,200
They're Hebrews, they're to be my descendants,

442
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,280
and Jacob's name changed to Israel.

443
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,100
And we find that it says in verse 16,

444
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,640
that it says that let them grow into a multitude

445
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,480
in the midst of the earth.

446
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,640
And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand

447
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,840
upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him.

448
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,040
And he held up his father's hand to remove it

449
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,760
from Ephraim's head into Manasseh's head.

450
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,520
And Joseph said to his father, not so, my father,

451
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,880
for this is the firstborn,

452
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:17,360
put thy right hand upon his head, in verse 18.

453
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,700
So we find that Joseph is standing here,

454
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,800
he puts the sons out in the order

455
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,400
in which he believes it's to be.

456
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,920
And we find that after Jacob is blessing the boys,

457
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:30,840
and Joseph recognizes, no, no, no, you have it wrong.

458
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,280
And he's gonna try to remove the hand

459
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,920
and put them in the right place.

460
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:40,380
Notice the Bible says in verse 19, and his father refused.

461
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:45,760
Notice what he says, he says, I know it, my son.

462
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,280
I know it.

463
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:52,480
He also shall become a people, and he also shall be great.

464
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,420
But truly, his younger brother shall be greater than he.

465
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,200
And his seed shall become a multitude of nations.

466
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,640
It says in verse 20, and he blessed them that day,

467
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,200
saying, in thee shall Israel bless,

468
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,720
saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh.

469
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,960
And he set Ephraim before Manasseh.

470
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,720
And Israel said unto Joseph, behold, I die,

471
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,720
but God shall be with you and bring you again

472
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,080
unto the land of your fathers.

473
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,040
Moreover, I have given to thee one portion

474
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,440
above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand

475
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,560
of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.

476
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,600
As we look at this prophecy, if you will, the blessing,

477
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,320
we find that the younger Ephraim shall be greater,

478
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,000
and we find that he, Jacob, was guiding his hands wittingly.

479
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
He is in this position.

480
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,400
Remember, we spoke about the original praise,

481
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,400
and he's speaking about the past and the present,

482
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,200
but then we see the prophecy,

483
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,680
and he's prophesying about what will be.

484
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:51,960
He has confidence in the God that he serves

485
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,240
as to what God is going to do.

486
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,120
And we find that it's certainly true.

487
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,160
If you turn to the book of Numbers, Numbers chapter one,

488
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:03,440
notice what the Bible tells us in Numbers one.

489
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,600
Numbers chapter one, I want you to see a couple of things.

490
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,280
We'll look in chapter one and two,

491
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:14,440
but in Numbers chapter one, notice in verse number 33.

492
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,440
Numbers one and verse 33, it says,

493
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,560
those that were numbered of them,

494
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:27,240
even of the tribe of Ephraim, were 40,500.

495
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,160
Now, that's the tribe of Ephraim.

496
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,000
He's the younger, but he was the one

497
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,840
that was to receive the blessing,

498
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,600
and we find that it says that it was 40,500.

499
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,680
In verse 34, the children of Manasseh,

500
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,600
by their generations, after their families,

501
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,880
by the house of their fathers,

502
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,720
according to the number of their names,

503
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,320
from 20 years old and upward,

504
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,640
all that were able to go forth to war,

505
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,840
those that were numbered of them,

506
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:52,120
even of the tribe of Manasseh, were 32,200.

507
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:55,720
So 32,200, a difference of 8,300.

508
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,320
Ephraim has the larger tribe.

509
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,800
In chapter number two, in verse number 18,

510
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,960
Israel and their camp and how they would be set up

511
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,240
is outlined for us in Numbers chapter two,

512
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,680
as they would be set up around the tabernacle,

513
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,600
and we find that in verse number 18,

514
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,480
it talks about the west side, and notice what it says.

515
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,040
On the west side shall be the standard

516
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,400
of the camp of Ephraim, according to their armies,

517
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,480
and the captain of the sons of Ephraim

518
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:27,040
shall be Elishamah, the son of Amahud,

519
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,280
and his host, and those that were numbered of them

520
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:34,280
were 40,500, and by him shall be the tribe of Manasseh,

521
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,560
and the captain of the children of Manasseh

522
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,440
shall be Gamaliel, the son of Padazar,

523
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,360
and his host, and those that were numbered of them

524
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,540
were 32,200, and also it was the tribe of Benjamin

525
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,740
that would be there on the west side.

526
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:50,280
But again, we find that even as you look

527
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:54,520
at this prophecy from Jacob in Genesis chapter 48,

528
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,120
and the blessing that is given,

529
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:01,120
we find certainly that Manasseh would not have the place,

530
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:04,440
though he was the firstborn, it would be Ephraim

531
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,720
that received that blessing.

532
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,560
We go through all of this, and we find this evening

533
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,880
that as Jacob is looking, as we look through

534
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,680
this text of scripture, and look at the interaction,

535
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,640
but when we couple it with the truth

536
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,400
of Hebrews 11 and verse 21, we find that throughout

537
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:25,400
this interaction, Jacob worshiped, he worshiped.

538
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,640
As I begin to think about Jacob worshiping,

539
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,160
I believe that really we could look at it in three phases

540
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,920
as I've already mentioned as we've gone through

541
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,980
the thoughts this evening, but Jacob worshiped God

542
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:41,840
for what he did, for what God did.

543
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:47,240
Jacob worshiped God, he praised God for what God was doing,

544
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:51,280
and then he also worshiped because of what God will do.

545
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,600
Begin to think about our own lives,

546
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,880
and begin to think about worship

547
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,320
and the importance of worship,

548
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,680
and I said this on Wednesday evening,

549
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,440
and I've said it before from the pulpit

550
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:04,120
that not all that's called worship today is truly worship.

551
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,560
A lot of places around the country today

552
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:10,040
that had a service at a place that they called church

553
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,000
and said that they were worshiping,

554
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,520
but I would say to you that it really wasn't

555
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:18,840
biblical worship, see because God is a spirit,

556
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,240
according to John chapter number four,

557
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,120
and they that worship him must worship him

558
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,780
in spirit and in truth.

559
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:27,000
You think about the Old Testament,

560
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,600
what a great picture God gives us in the Old Testament.

561
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,040
The people of Israel could not just decide

562
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,340
to approach God any way they chose to.

563
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,360
They had to approach God on God's terms.

564
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,320
They had to approach God God's way.

565
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:46,400
God prescribed the way for his people

566
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,520
to approach him and to worship him,

567
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,380
and when they did not follow the prescribed way,

568
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:55,720
it was met with judgment.

569
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,960
In fact, there were times in which you find

570
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,820
even in the Old Testament when the people of God,

571
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:06,600
the children of Israel, sought to worship God,

572
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,040
but their heart wasn't right with God.

573
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:13,800
You know what God says of those outward expressions?

574
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,120
He says, I don't want them.

575
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,800
Don't bring your offerings, don't do, why?

576
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,360
Because your heart is far from me.

577
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:25,040
See, God knows our heart, God knows,

578
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,360
and when we gather together for worship

579
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,600
and we speak about worship and the importance of worship,

580
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,160
I want you to look at a couple of passages with me

581
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,340
and consider the importance of worship,

582
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:38,020
and as the Bible tells us in Hebrews 11,

583
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:42,540
that in this setting, Jacob worshiped.

584
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:43,540
What was he doing?

585
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,300
He was acknowledging God.

586
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,020
You know, sometimes what happens if we're not careful

587
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:52,100
is we can get to the end of our life

588
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,940
or even in the midst of our life,

589
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:56,380
not even being in Jacob's position

590
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,780
of being at the end of his life,

591
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,380
but we can be in the middle of our life

592
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,500
at some point in our life,

593
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:03,660
and we can try to tell other people how good we are

594
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:06,020
and how, man, how we've made it

595
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:09,180
in all of these successes that we've had in our lives,

596
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:12,640
and look at my life and look what I've accomplished.

597
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:18,600
But Jacob, he says, let me tell you what God has done.

598
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,340
Let me tell you how God met with me.

599
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:23,660
Let me tell you how God blessed me.

600
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,060
Let me tell you how God promised me.

601
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:28,940
Let me tell you how God provided for me.

602
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:35,260
Let me explain to you what I expect God to continue to do.

603
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,100
Why?

604
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,140
Because God always honors his word.

605
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:41,340
He always does what he says he's going to do.

606
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,059
Turn over, if you will, to 2 Chronicles.

607
00:28:43,059 --> 00:28:44,660
I want you to see a passage of scripture

608
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,380
in 2 Chronicles 29,

609
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:49,100
and it's a period of time in Israel's history

610
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,619
where they have revival under the ministry,

611
00:28:51,619 --> 00:28:55,420
really the leadership, Hezekiah is the king of Judah

612
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:58,260
at this particular time in Judah's history.

613
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:02,580
We find that they have revival during his reign as king.

614
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:04,340
It's not the only time we find

615
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,580
that Judah had revival.

616
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:08,140
They had revival during the time of Jehoshaphat.

617
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:11,500
They had revival during the time of Josiah.

618
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,100
But we see here in Hezekiah's reign,

619
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,940
it's very interesting what happens.

620
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,140
And as we begin to,

621
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,660
we're just jumping right in the middle

622
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,140
of a passage of scripture

623
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:23,260
and how they were cleansing the house of the Lord

624
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,619
and all that they did.

625
00:29:24,619 --> 00:29:26,859
And the Bible begins to talk about this revival.

626
00:29:26,859 --> 00:29:28,059
And I want you to pick it up with me

627
00:29:28,059 --> 00:29:29,739
in 2 Chronicles 29.

628
00:29:29,739 --> 00:29:32,780
And I want you to see what God's people did

629
00:29:33,619 --> 00:29:34,940
and how they worship.

630
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,179
The Bible says in verse 28,

631
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:38,900
and all the congregation worshiped

632
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,780
and the singers sang.

633
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,660
You know, singing is part of worship.

634
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,780
Singing is part of worship.

635
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,260
When we sing, we're not trying to bring

636
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:52,859
any kind of acknowledgement, recognition to ourselves.

637
00:29:52,859 --> 00:29:56,380
No, the real true heart of those that are singing

638
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,739
ought to be to worship our God,

639
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:00,980
to sing praise.

640
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,980
He's unto His name.

641
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:06,480
The Bible says that we're to sing

642
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,720
and to make a joyful noise unto the Lord.

643
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,940
We find that the Bible says that they were singing,

644
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,580
they worshiped and the singer sang

645
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:18,420
and the trumpeters sounded.

646
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,260
Amen?

647
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,260
I told Tim this morning,

648
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:22,260
we've not had the trumpet for a couple of weeks.

649
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,340
And I said to Tim, I said,

650
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:26,060
man, it was good to hear the trumpet this morning.

651
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:26,900
Amen?

652
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:27,720
I enjoy that.

653
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,980
I get to hear it more than all of you

654
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,340
because I sit right in front of them

655
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,740
and that thing's pointing right at me,

656
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:32,580
but I love it.

657
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,400
I play the trumpet.

658
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,480
I don't play it that well.

659
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,020
I quit playing it for a lot of years.

660
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,740
And I said to Tim just a couple of weeks ago,

661
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,200
I better start getting back to it

662
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,740
because he's gonna be leaving soon

663
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,720
and we gotta have a trumpet

664
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,980
because I've gotten used to it.

665
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,880
Somebody else wants to learn how to play the trumpet,

666
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,720
please let me know

667
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,480
and we'll give you that opportunity.

668
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,320
Amen?

669
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,180
But it says that the trumpeters sounded

670
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:55,640
and all this continued notice

671
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:58,580
until the burnt offering was finished.

672
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:01,060
And when they had made an end of offering,

673
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:03,540
listen, you know when we give an offering to the Lord,

674
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:05,060
we're worshiping God.

675
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,020
The time of our service,

676
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:11,660
when we have our time of passing and offering play,

677
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,500
understand with me this evening

678
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:16,560
that that's part of worship.

679
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,060
It's part of worship.

680
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,740
I know that there's a lot of people

681
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:23,260
that send a lot of criticisms to church

682
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:26,460
and to Christians that they just want our money.

683
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,980
Has nothing to do with that.

684
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,420
It's a matter of worship

685
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:34,100
and it's a matter of obedience is what it is.

686
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,540
And what a blessing to be able to worship the Lord,

687
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:41,240
to give back to him a portion of what he's blessed us with.

688
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,520
The time of offering,

689
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,580
and I hope you can understand this,

690
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,580
I've sat in services over the years,

691
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:49,260
it really has always bothered me.

692
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:52,620
We've not had it much here because of,

693
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,500
well, I'm the pastor,

694
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,740
and so therefore I don't behave this way

695
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,620
and I don't really invite guest speakers to come

696
00:31:58,620 --> 00:31:59,780
that would behave this way.

697
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:01,000
But I remember seeing for years

698
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,020
while I was in Bible college

699
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,420
and serving in other ministries,

700
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:05,220
where guest speakers would come in

701
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,360
and during the entire song service and offering,

702
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,540
they'd just be sitting there talking.

703
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:11,820
It just drives me crazy.

704
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,860
Because then you're gonna get up and preach

705
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:16,500
or they'd be working on their sermon.

706
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:20,060
Listen, man, you had yesterday to work on your sermon.

707
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:22,580
And last week, and most of the evangelists,

708
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,780
if anyone's gonna watch it tonight,

709
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:25,820
they preach the same sermon over and over, amen?

710
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:27,660
I'm just teasing, just teasing.

711
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:31,500
But the reality is that it's not a time for talking.

712
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:35,260
It's not a time for, no, no, it's worship.

713
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,340
It's worship.

714
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:40,460
I don't wanna miss the singing.

715
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,020
I enjoy the singing, why?

716
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:44,780
Because the singing prepares my heart.

717
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:48,420
It's an act of worship, but it's also preparatory.

718
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:52,000
And we find that as we look here in the offering time,

719
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,720
what a blessing to be able to give back to God.

720
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,400
It says, the king and all that were present with him

721
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,760
bowed themselves and worshiped.

722
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,520
Verse 30, moreover, Hezekiah the king and the princes

723
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:05,600
commanded the Levites to sing praise unto the Lord

724
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,160
with the words of David and of Asaph the seer.

725
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,560
And they sang praises with gladness

726
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:13,920
and they bowed their heads and worshiped.

727
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,920
I believe that it was done decently and in order.

728
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,200
In fact, we understand that the New Testament tells us

729
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:23,240
that our God is a God of order.

730
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,840
He is not the author of confusion.

731
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,760
He's a God of order.

732
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,440
And we're to worship Him orderly, decently in an order.

733
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,800
We find that here in 2 Chronicles,

734
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,320
there's a great revival during Hezekiah's time.

735
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,600
And we see how they're worshiping the Lord.

736
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,120
He's worthy of our worship.

737
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,740
I want you to notice over in Malachi, if you will,

738
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:45,200
and we're gonna get our way over to the New Testament

739
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,040
here in just a moment.

740
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,920
But look at Malachi with me just for a moment.

741
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,600
Malachi chapter one.

742
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,960
Notice what the Bible says in Malachi chapter one.

743
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,420
In verse number six.

744
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,720
Malachi chapter one, verse number six.

745
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,920
Last book of the Old Testament

746
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,720
just before the Gospel of Matthew.

747
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,800
Malachi chapter number one, verse number six.

748
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:17,680
A son honoreth his father and a servant his master.

749
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,880
If then I be a father, where is mine honor?

750
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:26,140
If I be a master, where is my fear?

751
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:27,560
Sayeth the Lord of hosts unto you,

752
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,480
O priest that despise my name.

753
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,780
And you say, wherein have we despised thy name?

754
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:32,620
Notice what he says,

755
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:36,580
ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar.

756
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:40,480
And ye say, wherein have we polluted thee?

757
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,040
In that you say, the table of the Lord is contemptible.

758
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,000
Notice in verse eight,

759
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,520
if you offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil?

760
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:53,680
And if you offer the lame and sick, is it not evil?

761
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,880
So there was prescribed,

762
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:02,080
in the book of Leviticus, there's a prescribed order

763
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:05,520
of what type of animals to be brought for a sacrifice.

764
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,240
And here what's happening is saying,

765
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,120
listen, are you gonna bring a blind or a lame?

766
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,620
What would be the significance?

767
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:15,620
Well, that one is not of any profit or benefit to me,

768
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:18,300
so I'm just gonna offer that to the Lord.

769
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:22,940
No, no, we're to take our best to the Lord, amen.

770
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:25,140
Notice what he says in verse number eight.

771
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:29,700
He says, offer it now unto thy governor.

772
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,300
Will he be pleased with thee?

773
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,860
Or accept thy person, sayeth the Lord of hosts.

774
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,180
I mean, that's convicting.

775
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,480
He's saying, you're trying to bring me these offerings

776
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:42,100
and saying that you're worshiping,

777
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,580
but you're not bringing them the way

778
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,780
that you're supposed to.

779
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:48,980
You don't bring me a blind or a lame.

780
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,220
Offer it to your governor, are they gonna accept it?

781
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:53,900
The answer is obvious, no.

782
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:56,440
By the way, most of them wouldn't have brought that

783
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,380
to the governor.

784
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,380
It would be shameful to do such things.

785
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,900
But yet they'd bring it to God.

786
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:07,720
I'm thankful as you look through

787
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:10,220
and understand in verse 14, notice what God says.

788
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:12,780
We've skipped some verses here, but it says this.

789
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,580
Well, let me read verse 11.

790
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:16,920
For from the rising of the sun,

791
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,900
even under the going down of the same,

792
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:22,320
that my name shall be great among the Gentiles.

793
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,660
And every place in sin shall be offering to my name

794
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:25,900
and a pure offering.

795
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,780
For my name shall be great among the heathen,

796
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:28,740
sayeth the Lord of hosts.

797
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:31,020
In verse 14, see they had profaned it.

798
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:32,420
Verse 14, though, notice it says,

799
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,980
but cursed be the deceiver,

800
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:35,500
which hath in his flock a male,

801
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:39,100
and voweth and sacrifices unto the Lord a corrupt thing.

802
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,620
Notice where he says, for I am a great king,

803
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:43,820
sayeth the Lord of hosts,

804
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:46,260
and my name is dreadful among the heathen.

805
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:48,900
He's worthy of our best.

806
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,580
He really is.

807
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:53,020
And we find that the book of Revelation

808
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:57,660
gives us a glimpse into worship in heaven.

809
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,160
One day we're gonna get to heaven.

810
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,060
I don't know when it's gonna be,

811
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,140
but one day we're gonna get to heaven.

812
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:05,480
Revelation chapter four and five,

813
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,580
give us a little taste, if you will,

814
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:12,700
a little view into the throne room of heaven.

815
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,460
We find in Revelation four and five,

816
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:17,120
there's gonna be a lot of worship going on.

817
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,860
And I know, I think it was Brother Meshon,

818
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:22,100
he said it maybe one of the last times he was here,

819
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,780
he said that we ought to prepare for it now

820
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:26,660
because we're gonna worship God forever,

821
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,980
and so we ought to get used to it now.

822
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,220
And again, worship isn't running around,

823
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:35,060
loud music, dark lights, smoke, all this kind of nonsense.

824
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:36,980
I talked about some stuff on Wednesday evening

825
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:39,340
that they did in a number of churches around America

826
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,160
on Super Bowl Sunday.

827
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,140
It's absolutely blasphemous what they were doing.

828
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,780
Kicking Bibles around the stage.

829
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,660
Are you kidding me?

830
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:51,780
Literally said, as they opened up a service,

831
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:55,060
and by the way, the preachers came out through a tunnel

832
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:59,140
with smoke coming up like they were some kind of celebrity.

833
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:00,540
What in the world?

834
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:02,980
Blasphemous.

835
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:06,060
There was a man dressed as a referee,

836
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,500
and here's the thing that was amazing,

837
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:11,340
they're all dressed, not their best,

838
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:12,180
but you know what was happening?

839
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,580
The commentators, quote unquote,

840
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,020
they're in suits and ties.

841
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:17,900
Isn't that interesting?

842
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,300
They're in suits and ties,

843
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,700
and then these folks come out,

844
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,020
and they say to the pastor,

845
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,220
they're gonna do a coin flip,

846
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,620
and they say this, quote,

847
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:32,300
do you want to kick or receive the Bible?

848
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:36,700
I can't even imagine saying those words.

849
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,740
I'm simply quoting them.

850
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:43,060
The pastor said, I'll receive it,

851
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:47,820
and they literally set up like a kickoff on the platform

852
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:50,140
and kick the Bible across the stage.

853
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,020
Unbelievable.

854
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,060
That's not worship.

855
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,420
That is not worship.

856
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:59,780
Our God is to be worshiped.

857
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:03,740
Listen, it's not about the size of a crowd.

858
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:06,420
The people in those auditoriums were going crazy.

859
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:11,340
Looked just like the people in the stadiums,

860
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,500
to be honest with you.

861
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:14,900
You know what those people were worshiping?

862
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:18,100
Not the creator God,

863
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:20,540
they were worshiping an idol.

864
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:22,900
Right?

865
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:25,300
In the stadiums, they're worshiping an idol.

866
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:27,180
That's what they're doing.

867
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:29,140
Bring that stuff into the house of God.

868
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:30,860
Crazy.

869
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:34,540
The house of God is the pillar and ground of truth.

870
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,180
Amen?

871
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:37,740
If I ever say we're gonna have a Super Bowl thing,

872
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:39,500
just fire me.

873
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,900
I mean, seriously.

874
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:46,580
The reality is that when we approach a holy God,

875
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,580
we approach him on his terms,

876
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:52,580
and we approach him his way.

877
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:57,100
He is a thrice holy God.

878
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,460
He is to be reverenced.

879
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:03,140
He's to be honored and to be glorified.

880
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:05,460
He's to be worshiped.

881
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:08,780
I don't know if you've ever heard somebody say, when I see God, you're not going to do

882
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:14,300
anything but fall on your face.

883
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:17,340
I want to know who...no, no, no, no, no, no.

884
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:19,060
Change your thinking.

885
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:23,400
You're going to simply fall on His face, in His presence, and He's worthy.

886
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:28,780
Revelation 4, notice in verse number 10, the 4 and 20 elders represented of the church

887
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:35,060
fall down before Him that sat on the throne and worship Him that liveth forever and ever.

888
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:40,740
And cast their crowns before the throne, saying, Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory

889
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:47,260
and honor and power, for Thou hast created all things, and for Thy pleasure they are

890
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:49,540
and were created.

891
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:54,020
Chapter 5, and I saw in the right hand of Him that sat on the throne a book written

892
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:56,980
within and on the back side, sealed with seven seals.

893
00:40:56,980 --> 00:41:02,140
And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book

894
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,900
and to loose the seals thereof?

895
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:07,900
And no man in heaven nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book,

896
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,340
neither to look thereon.

897
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:10,340
And I wept much.

898
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:11,340
Why?

899
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:15,900
Because no man was found worthy to open and read the book, neither to look thereon.

900
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,660
And one of the elders said unto me, Weep not.

901
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:25,640
Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the

902
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:29,700
book and to loose the seven seals thereof.

903
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:33,660
And I beheld, and lo, in the midst of the throne and on the four beasts, in the midst

904
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:39,460
of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes,

905
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:42,860
which are the seven spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth.

906
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:46,860
And He came and took the book out of the right hand of Him that sat upon the throne.

907
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:51,380
And when He had taken the book, the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down

908
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:56,400
before the Lamb, having every one of them harps and golden vials full of odors, which

909
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,260
are the prayers of saints.

910
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:06,420
Notice verse 9, and they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book and

911
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:12,280
to open the seals thereof, for Thou wast slain and hast redeemed us to God by Thy blood out

912
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:19,780
of every kindred and tongue and people and nation, and hast made us unto our God kings

913
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:24,120
and priests, and we shall reign on the earth.

914
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:28,160
And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts

915
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:33,780
and the elders, and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands

916
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:40,960
of thousands, saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power

917
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:46,680
and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing.

918
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:50,700
And every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and such

919
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:56,100
are as in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing and honor and glory

920
00:42:56,100 --> 00:43:02,060
and power be unto Him that sitteth upon the throne and unto the Lamb forever and ever.

921
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:04,020
And the four beasts said, Amen.

922
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:12,280
The four and twenty elders fell down and worshipped Him that liveth forever and ever.

923
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:16,480
Fourteen verses in chapter five, but man, what a scene.

924
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,480
We're going to be there.

925
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,480
Hallelujah.

926
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,920
Listen, we're going to worship Him.

927
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:29,040
But you don't have to wait until then to worship God.

928
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:37,220
Worship in a, if you just read Genesis 48, it just seems like a meeting between a father

929
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:41,400
and a son and a couple of grandsons.

930
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:46,440
And yes, he's talking about what God has done and the past and what He's doing in the present,

931
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:54,380
what He's going to do in the future, but Hebrew says that He worshipped this evening.

932
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:56,280
We need to worship our God.

933
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,680
He is worthy of worship.

934
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:02,240
He alone is to be worshipped.

935
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:06,620
Our children and our children's children, a generation that would rise after us need

936
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:08,940
to see that we're worshipping God.

937
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:10,740
We worship Him because of what He's done.

938
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:15,160
You know, He's done some amazing things, He really has.

939
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:19,480
We worship Him because of what He's doing.

940
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:25,520
I know that it's a dark hour that we live in, but God's still working.

941
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,500
God's still on His throne.

942
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:30,380
People are still getting saved.

943
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:32,020
God's still at work.

944
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:36,940
We need to worship Him for what He's doing and then, oh, we can worship Him knowing what

945
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:40,840
He's going to do because one day He's coming back for us.

946
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:45,060
One day we're going to see Him face to face, we were singing about a little bit this evening,

947
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:48,860
when we all get to heaven, what a day of rejoicing that will be.

948
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:51,700
But you know, we can have a little bit of that here on earth.

949
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:53,260
We can worship Him.

950
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:56,660
He's worthy of our worship.

951
00:44:56,660 --> 00:45:01,940
This week, we come together for corporate worship, Sunday morning, Sunday evening, we

952
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:06,540
worship the Lord, the prayer and Bible study, worshipping the Lord on Wednesday.

953
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:10,220
But you know, you need to worship God every day in your life.

954
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:11,940
Worship God.

955
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:12,940
Worship Him.

956
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:15,180
He's worthy.

957
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:19,820
You don't have to necessarily come to a corporate meeting place to worship God.

958
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:23,020
You can worship God in your individual life.

959
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:28,980
It's a great thing to come together corporately and collectively worship God.

960
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:32,980
Singing with you is so much better than singing by myself.

961
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:33,980
It really is.

962
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:39,980
It's just a sweet thing when you hear the saints of God singing out the great hymns

963
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:40,980
of faith.

964
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:41,980
Man, it's encouraging.

965
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:45,860
You come to a place like this and you hear the singing, man, it encourages you.

966
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:46,860
Why?

967
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:51,780
Because we're worshipping God and He's worthy of our worship.

968
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:55,620
The Bible says that Jacob, he worshipped.

969
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:57,220
This evening, I hope that we'd be challenged.

970
00:45:57,220 --> 00:46:02,420
Yes, we see the historical context and it's a blessing to see that God recorded that for

971
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:03,580
us.

972
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:04,580
But tonight, how's our worship?

973
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:07,460
How are we doing worshipping the Lord?

974
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:08,460
Let's pray together.

975
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:09,460
Father, we love you.

976
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:10,540
We thank you for loving us.

977
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:12,300
Thank you for the Bible.

978
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:19,660
Thank you for what you have done in our lives individually, families that are gathered here

979
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:26,020
this evening, what you've done in their lives, as a church, what you've done in our history.

980
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:28,540
Thank you for what you're doing today, how you're working.

981
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:33,580
Thank you for adding to the church today, having someone join this morning.

982
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:35,620
God, we're thankful.

983
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:36,940
We've had baptism this year.

984
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:38,580
We've had salvation this year.

985
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:43,460
Lord, we just thank you for what you're doing and how you're working and we give you all

986
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:46,860
the honor and all the glory for it's due unto your name.

987
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:49,580
You are worthy.

988
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:51,300
God we thank you for what you will do.

989
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:54,140
We know that you have a plan.

990
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:58,380
You've revealed much of your plan to us, though we don't know the timing for several things,

991
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:05,660
we know you have a plan and God we look forward to one day being in your presence, worshipping

992
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:06,660
you.

993
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:13,660
We read that text of scripture in Revelation 4 and 5 and how our heart longs to be in your

994
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:17,940
presence, to worship you, to see you face to face.

995
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:23,660
God I pray that until that time you would help us to worship you in spirit and in truth

996
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:30,820
here in our lives with the days that you give us, to worship you in our own personal daily

997
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:33,780
lives, to worship you corporately and collectively.

998
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:39,500
Lord, there'd be a generation that would come behind us that would see that our God is real

999
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:45,300
and that he is worthy of worship and that he is the one that determines how we approach

1000
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:46,300
him.

1001
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:50,300
I pray God that you'd move and work as only you can and we'll give you the honor and glory

1002
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:51,300
for it.

1003
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:52,700
For it's in Christ's name we pray.

1004
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:53,700
Would you stand with me?

1005
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:54,700
Heads are bowed, eyes are closed.

1006
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:57,820
We have a brief moment of invitation this evening.

1007
00:47:57,820 --> 00:47:59,620
As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.
